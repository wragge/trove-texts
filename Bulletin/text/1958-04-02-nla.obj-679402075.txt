THE AUSTRALIAN BABBITT
E. O. Schlunke has long been
known to readers of “The Bulletin” or
his books as an exponent of the poetry
and comedy of the Australian earth,
a field in which he comes close to the
master of this kind of writing, Brian
James. He had also a territory quite
of his own in his comedies of the
Italian prisoners-of-war.
But the surprise of his new book,
The Village Hampden (Angus and
Robertson), is to see this humorist of
the earth emerging as the satirist of the
Australian Babbitt: the get-rich-
quickers who dominate the cities today
and, so Schlunke informs us, infest not
only the country towns but even the
sacred farmlands.
Our Babbitt is, of course, a various
fellow, just as he was in America, for
almost everybody in Sinclair Lewis’s
novel was one kind of Babbitt or
another.
Sometimes he is three jolly country-
men who come to Sydney for a bowling-
tournament and a spree, two of whom
find they have to be rather better
Rotarians than they want to be when
the third has a heart-attack and they
feel obliged to support his wife and
family. Sometimes he is not a Babbitt
at all, but a salt-of-the-earth farmer
who sells his farm and makes an
uneasy attempt to settle among the
Babbitts of Sydney’s North Shore (just
round the corner, no doubt, from the
present reviewer).
Sometimes, as in that most reward-
ing comedy of the grazier who shot
the “cowboy,” he has degenerated into
a bodgie, only to be recognised as one
of the Clan Babbitt because he is a
city slicker and does not know which
end of a sheep is which —which is,
anyhow? Sometimes, getting very close
to the basic type, he is a smalltown
businessman who owns a nasty big
shiny car and makes love to other
men’s wives and is quite properly
murdered with an overdose of a blood-
pressure drug by an aggrieved husband.
Sometimes —more than once —he is a
woman who, for the sake of Society,
seduces her husband from the land or
gets drunk on gin and spills his serum
for destroying paddy-melons.
Sometimes, away up at Wagoona,
which seems to be about as far west
as anybody would want to go, or even
a little further, he is a Sydney radio-
man who makes cheap wisecracks, gets
drunk in hotel-lounges and chases any-
thing in skirts; or a professor of
economics who, as surprisingly as the
English Babbitt in “Babbitt,” cuts
loose late at night after many drinks
and sings comic Scotch songs; or a
Government departmental chief who
thinks that suffering farmers are
statistics.
Most of all, and, though he seems
to come from somewhere out west,
there isn’t anybody in Sydney who
wouldn’t recognise him; he is the flash,
rich, belligerent young businessman,
full of too much food, too much easy
money and too much brass, who, on
his eight-day trout-fishing holiday,
takes the rough mountain-road against
the advice of the locals, does-in his
gearbox and then for his whole eight
days, alternately fuming and bribing
and importantly ringing-up Sydney, has
to wait in well-deserved agony while
the silent mechanics in the local garage
—in the midst of attending to really
urgent jobs for noble farmers —fix the
car. A very funny, painful and
accurate story this is.
Various as they are, these Babbitts
have a fundamental similarity: they
have too much money and they have
no souls: they love neither the earth
nor the arts.
If Schlunke were writing a “serious”
sociological novel instead of a set of
delightful short-stories the book would
no doubt be received as a satire on
our post-war prosperity and its
creatures. That is, in fact, what it is.
But the most pleasing thing of all about
it is that Schlunke has seldom forgotten
that the artist, however much he may
desire to reform or scarify society, must
also and at all times be an entertainer;
and these stories are nearly all highly
entertaining—comedies, with a bite to
them.
THE SAWFISH
Isn’t it ominous that Nature has not yet
cleared
Away the carpenter models of her
evolution.
So, the sawfish still threshes in the shoals,
and should be feared
As the first pattern of a saw. When chaos
Rules, after the last bomb, the solution
Of the bomb’s rebuilding will be there. It
would pay us
To catch alt sawfish, first. What a haul
Of sea-things will be necessary, not to
leave us a trace
Of hand-tools. God, what a slaughter
and burning!
Even the hammerhead shark with its
maul;
The sawfish with his saw ; not a trace
Of such tools must we leave. Or, learning
From such prototypes as auger-shells,
pipe-fish, at fish-schools,
We shall build up the terror again, for
our remnant of fools.
Q.
JOHN BLIGHT.
Desert Battlefields
In Middle East Journey (Angus and
Robertson) John Laffin continues his
pilgrimage around the battlefields
where Australians fought in World
War II; a pleasant way of writing
travel-books, at least for the reader who
doesn’t have to share the heat, flies,
hostile Egyptian Customs-officials and
other pests of the Middle East.
Laffm’s difficulty in making such
a book, apart from the pests, is that
wars leave so few traces. In fact, it
makes one wonder why we have them.
There are, of course, the cemeteries
and the memorials. Here and there
may be an abandoned tank not yet
souvenired by the Bedouin, a booby-
trap or a minefield with which the
Bedouin can, and do, and did while
Laffin was there, blow themselves up.
Sometimes there is a name scrawled
upon a wall; and, mostly in rumor but
at least once in alarming fact (Laffin
traced the father back in Australia but
wisely decided not to tell him the good
news), there are the illegitimate
children, of whom Laffin thoughtfully
remarks that they are “very often the
result of a hasty, ill-considered union”
—what else they could be the result of
is hard to imagine. And that is about all.
But there is a certain melancholy
interest in reading merely of the silence
and emptiness of these battlefields
once so crowded and clamorous; and
of what relics do remain Laffin certainly
makes the most: the bayonet one
Brownlow of the 6th Division left

NEW-STATE URGE
IT is scarcely astonishing that the
Sydney press found little space to give
to reporting the twelfth convention of
the New England New State movement
held at Newcastle on March 20-21.
The fulminations of these confer-
ences against centralised State Govern-
ments tied to metropolitan interests
have in the past few years become so
routine, and the personalities involved
have remained so much the same, that
they have seemed ineffective.
The atmosphere of these gatherings
often has been one of despair; but
there was no despair among the
members of that one in Newcastle. In
fact, it was the most hopeful assembly
of its kind yet held and the first which
seemed to attract support from the
Newcastle business and professional
community.
There is no doubt that the city is
both growing metropolitan and feeling
metropolitan and increasingly impatient
with the shabby treatment that it
receives from the Sydney Government
and public authorities concerned with
production and transport. The port
of Newcastle itself has scarcely had
any attention paid to its major develop-
ment for the past 40 years, and it is
even now having little attention from
the awful muddle of fourteen or so
authorities which have a hand in its
control, though Mr. Cahill has been
frightened into making a packet of
promises.
The city has an exceptionally good
daily newspaper. It has become
a university town. Its heavy industries
are growing on an immense scale, yet
there is a feeling that State pressure
is by underground means doing its best
to shift the centre of the iron-and-
steel industries to the South Coast.
Behind and north of Newcastle lie
90.000 square-miles of the richest land
in Australia, sheep and dairying and
mineral, served by a scandalous
railway-system operated on a basis of
destructive competition which has
almost killed coastal shipping and ports
and which aims to kill the great road-
transport companies which have
grown-up in the New England area.
This region has a population of
700,000, with country towns and cities
reaching out vigorously to acquire
modem amenities, but debilitated by
the continual leechlike sucking of
Sydney, to serve which all railways are
organised.
Its 22 electoral representatives, the
majority regimented permanently
against the Labor Government in
Macquarie Street, can do nothing
against the 55 members who represent
metropolitan constituencies on both
sides of the House.
The list of the grievances of the
thriving area that was produced to
the convention by its president, Mr.
Phil Wright, were, of course, local, but
they were representative of the kind
which are rapidly making new States
an issue in N.S.W. and Queensland.
Mr. Wright instanced as specimens
of recent squandering expenditure
round the Sydney metropolitan area
the £3,000.000 spent on the go-slow
building of the Sydney Circular Quay
railway-station, the £6,500.000 on the
duplication of the Sydney-Penrith line,
the £15,000,000 that went on the electri-
fication of the Sydney-Lithgow line, the
proposed £40,000,000 on a satellite-
town at Dapto on the South Coast, the
tens of millions on the Warragamba
Dam purely for city water-supply.
By contrast, attention was called to
the history of the proposed Maryvale-
Sandy Hollow railway, which was
described to the conference as a
“nauseating scandal”:—
Recommended in 1911, authorised in
1927, begun in 1937, the project was
abandoned to the wallabies in 1949 after
£2,360,000 had been spent on earth-
works and tunnels and only £900,000 was
needed to complete the job.
Lack of funds could not have been
the reason, it was pointed out, since
the job was made derelict at the
moment when the Government was
launching the £l 5-million Lithgow-
Sydney electrification scheme. On the
money wasted on the Sandy Hollow
project the taxpayers must find the
interest, about £lOO,OOO a year, till
Doomsday. And this condition of
affairs exists despite the fact that the
railway was recommended on every
ground and particularly as an essential
emergency-link for defence.
The roll of instances in which large
country towns have been left almost
without water-supply during the recent
drought, the failures to give the country
what it considers its adequate propor-
tion of houses, the crawling pace and
neglect of economy in such projects
as the construction of the Keepit Dam,
ail had an airing.
The same atmosphere is beginning
to pervade the politics of both the
south of N.S.W. and the centre and
north of Queensland.
Queensland seems especially ripe for
subdivision. Its rude forefathers of
the Griffith-Mcllwraith era 70 years
ago would be astonished to find
that it had not already taken place.
There is little or nothing in common
between the far north and the south of
the State. The north is as far away
from Brisbane as Brisbane is from
Melbourne or Adelaide. The homo-
geneous region north of the rich
Mackay area has shown more real
growth and development of solid and
permanent wealth since the war than
any other part of the continent.
Townsville is a natural site for a
northern capital, as it is for a northern
export-outlet. The minerals of Mt. Isa,
the bauxite of Weipa, the wool and
meat of the west, the sugar of the
coastal area, the dairying of Atherton,
assure the future of the region, which
certainly has a common interest with
the Central District which is being
developed through the linking of the
Weipa project to Blair Athol coal.
But it has nothing to bind it to
Brisbane save the legirons of the State
railways, with their weird differential
freight-systems designed to assure that
staple production shall be carried over
maximum journeys for the benefit of
the socialised transport-system.
Feeling about subdivision, of which
the probability was acknowledged in
the Commonwealth Constitution Act
nearly 60 years ago, is certainly very
lively in the north since the entry into
power of a Government headed by a
Country-party man. Most politicians
are ready at least to give lip-service to
it, though they are apt to shy before
reaching the point at which precept
gives place to practice.
The committee on the Common-
wealth Constitution, which has been
touring the country for some months
and whose report is ripe for debate in
Parliament before the present year is
out,.undoubtedly has heard a good deal
about the subject. The Parliamentary
discussions of that report should give
an opportunity for a serious considera-
tion of the whole question of regional
development and otherwise.
The man-in-the-streef is wary of any
change which will provide morp Gov-
ernments. He finds the present lot a
superfluity of riches and would willingly
dump a large section of existing civil
servants and conflicting powers into the
deepest part of the Pacific Ocean.
The electors would listen to proposals
for changes only with firm assurances
that they would be economical in the
end. This makes the whole question
difficult to- handle.
It will, however, have to be handled
within a reasonably short time because
of the growing unwieldiness of State
Administrations, if because of nothing
else.


AN OLD SHIPMATE’S FAREWELL


PLAIN ENGLISH
For the High-jump
The banking bills having been rejected
by the Senate, the Commonwealth
Government is now in a position to ask
for a double-dissolution of Parliament —
if it wants one —and resolve the banking
issue at the polls.
Mr. Menzies has shown himself in no
hurry to announce his intention, though
his mind probably is already made up.
He could hold the election on a double-
dissolution any time from June to
August. An early election, with a poll
held quickly before Labor could mass
its forces, would leave the winning
side to bring down the Budget. This
course has some advantages, since it
would ease the internal position in the
Government parties by deferring the
necessity of reconstructing the Ministry
until the results had gone up. It also
seems a fairer way to the winning side.
Labor, after having cast a doleful and
indignant eye on the document prepared
by its novice member, Mr. Cope, which
shows the nature of the swing needed for
the A.L.P. to win control of the House
of Representatives, feels no optimism
about the outcome, and it looks almost a
certainty that the Menzies Government
\vould go back.
On the other hand, the Government
might think it an advantage to bring
down a popular Budget—as it certainly
can do if the drift in the economy does
not go further —reduce taxation, placate
industry and foreshadow a considerable
development- and housing-programme.
The issue on which a double-dissolu-
tion would be given would, of course, be
banking.
The wSenate position is naturally a
considerable factor in deciding the
Government’s course. A double-dissolu-
tion would send that House to the
country on an even footing between the
parties and would also give Labor a
chance, if it thought it wise, to replace
some of its sick men.
On the other hand, if Parliament is
left to die naturally, the Government
would go the country with only 13
retiring Senators against Labor’s retiring
17 —they go out on June 30 next year.
This, under existing circumstances, will
give Menzies a very substantial
advantage at the Senate poll— : at least on
the mathematical face of the figures,
especially with the Democratic Labor
party and the Gair party in the lists.
Within the Labor party in the key
State of N.S.W. there is more than
normal anxiety about whether State or
Commonwealth is first for the high-
jump. The lavish preparations Mr. Cahill
is making for N.S.W. representation in
New York suggests that he is going to
jump right out of the window before any
of the fun starts. But whether he remains
State leader or not, each section of the
party in N.S.W. is rather anxious to be
first, in the election field.
The problem is that whoever goes first
will probably be able to scrape-up
sufficient funds for the fight, and that
Whoever goes last will have to be
content with the leavings.
In Queensland, “official” Labor would
like some time to elapse before an
election, since this would provide a chance
to heal the breach with the Gair
followers and allow some of the
enthusiasm of electors for the Liberal-
C.P. Government to wear-off.
Lost of the Stalinists
With the exit of Bulganin, the last of
the Stalinists goes from high office, except
for Voroshilov, who has no longer any
significance—and Khrushchev.
Bulganin himself has never been more
than a figurehead since Khrushchev took
over the control of the party-secretariat
in succession to Stalin. Vigorous efforts
have been made to cloak the truth of
the position. Bulganin has been used as
a front to suggest that the Government
of the U.S.S.R. is predominant and that
the Communist party is merely an ordi-
nary political party ; but the system has
proved too cumbersome and unwieldy to
be workable in international relation-
ships. It has been found necessary,
apparently, to clear the way so that there
can be no delay and obstruction due to
having to pass matters through the
Governmental filter in time of crisis.
Khrushchev seems to have been bent
all along on reaching this situation. The
Eight Little Nigger boys of Communism
who were left when Big Brother perished
—how nobody even yet knows, but many
guess—have one by one been got rid
of. Beria, Malenkov, Molotov, Zhukov,
the great figures of power in Hungary
and Poland, have fallen one after another,
along with Stalin’s immediate entourage.
Save for Voroshilov, then a very well-
known figure, and Mikoyan, the mysteri-
ous Armenian,- not one remains of the
names that were known to the observers
of Russian affairs in 1937.
Russia, after preaching to the world
about the immense changes which had
taken place in its Constitution and the
liberal democratic outlook which had
marked them, has returned to the status
quo of the evil days of the early ’thirties:
it is now once more a one-man dictator-
ship, cruel, ruthless and unscrupulous, in
which all authority is based on force.
It is, in fact, once more on the only
basis on which any country can live under
Communism.
Oil Refinery for Adelaide
South Australian Premier Playford, it
seems, just can’t stop collecting new
developmental projects. Within the last
month he has added four tp his bag.
First came the announcement that
Ampol’s new 32,000-ton tanker would
be built at Whyalla, the B.H.P. shipyard
being enlarged for the purpose. A week
later B.H.P. confirmed that it would
establish a complete steel-plant at
Whyalla at a cost of £3O million. Not
to be outdone, G.M.-H. weighed-in with
an announcement that they planned to
spend £7£ million on a new plant at
Elizabeth and extensions to the existing
plant at Woodville. Latest news is the
decision ’ of Vacuum Oil to build a
refinery near Hallett’s Cove, on St.
Vincent Gulf, about 20 miles south of
Adelaide.
Giving details of the projected
refinery, Vacuum officials said no date
for beginning the construction job had
yet been fixed, but survey work would
begin at once. Present plans provide
for a catalytic reformer, a distillation
unit and facilities for producing bitu-
men. During the construction period
up to 1500 men will be employed, and
when the refinery goes into production
it will provide permanent jobs for 300.
There is no intention of building a
port at Hallett’s Cove ; crude-oil will be
pumped from tankers to refinery by an
underwater pipeline. The depth of water
at the anchorage—6oft.—was one of the
factors determining the site of the
refinery; it will enable super-tankers
of up to 80,000 tons to service the
refinery.
The S.A. Government’s contribution
to the will probably include a
spur-line from the existing Willunga
railway, provision by the Housing Trust
of sufficient homes for the work-force
employed and possibly a powerhouse to
be fuelled by residuals fmm the refinery.
The Adelaide refinery will be the
fifth full-scale oil-plant to be built in
Australia since 1953. Its location on the
cliffs near Hallett’s Cove is not far from
the spot where Professors David and
Howchin discovered some of the first
traces of glacial action in Australia.
The New Axis
Almost imperceptibly in North Africa,
in the Middle East and in Indonesia,
along an axis which cuts the length of
Australia’s main communications with
Europe, crisis is developing which may
influence the future fo Australia.
Nobody notices much the loss ef
British control of the Mediterranean
(now virtually in America * hands, but
threatened by Russian air-forces), the loss
of Suez so long as it is open, the chaos
in Indonesia because it is having only
internal effects for the moment, or, at
the other end of the line, the wars in
Tunis and Algeria, which seem foreign
to British Commonwealth politics.
Only when these areas have settled
down and the strength of the holders
is sufficiently established for them to
dare to dictate terms will the effects on
this country be obvious.
All these areas are in flux, nothing
politically definitive having been effected
in them. Behind the scenes in every
one of them the essence of the future
developments is oil. The Indonesian
situation is governed primarily by the
fight of the Communist bloc for control
of oil and rubber as essentials. The
Middle Eastern fight in arid desert
fringed with a little fertility is based
on oil, the more intense because the
place is a world crossroads and a


point of departure from Europe for the
East and Australia and for Africa.
The Tunisian-Algerian fight has
achieved new significance because of
the discovery of oil in the background
of the Sahara.
In each of these areas there is violence
under the shadow of Communism, and
the forces of evolution or revolution
are partly on strings pulled from Moscow
via the Afro-Asian or Arab blocs. The
Kremlin, playing on racial hates or
individual greed or ambition, has bred
war, murder, the breaking of old ties,
the dissolution of old securities, some
of them of world import in these
countries. How far the rot will go
depends on the firmness of Western
policies and the unities of Western
peoples, which Cannot be depended on
while Europe itself is in flux and the
American ambition for oil-control also
governs United States foreign policy as
it seems to do.
Nasser is not the ultimate in Egypt
and Syria ; nor are the little Arab king-
doms, new and as disparate as an angry
whirl of sand, the ultimate in the political-
molecular structure of the Arabian
States.
The only hard bit of indigenous stone
remaining in that area is the granite
structure of Turanian Turkey, which
lives as much alone as it can, toughen-
ing its muscles.
Nasser and his Syrian and Yemeni
friends are merely, at this stage, bits of
soft material which are being squeezed
into the form that the Kremlin desires
while deluding themselves that they are
self-squeezed.
In North Africa west of Suez there
has been war, bombing of towns, ultima-
tums between France and her old
African colonies. And over the battle-
fields the voices of radio-stations, guided
and directed and financed from Moscow,
ring-out day and night, uttering their
poisonous slogans about “colonialism”
and “imperialism,” stiring-up color
against color and race against race, pro-
moting the atmosphere of hate and
unrest, destruction, murder and distrust
in which Communism spawns.
Over the horizon where Western
policies are made everybody appears
to be distracted by some other issue—
European common-market, disarma-
ment-talks, the American elections.
The Vanishing Pub
It becomes increasingly apparent each
month in Victoria that the new Par-
liament to be elected next month will
have to come to the assistance, in quite
a substantial way, of the publican pro-
viding food and accommodation as well
as drink.
Hotels are disappearing from the old
Melbourne scene at a remarkable rate.
Three ceased trading in March, including
the Saracen’s Head in Bourke Street and
the Cosmopolitan in Swanston Street —
the third was a large hotel on the city-
edge of South Melbourne—and a fourth
has been sold and will close its bar soon.
Bourke Street, once one of the beeriest
thoroughfares in the nation, in recent
years has lost the Victoria (despite a
superb cuisine), the New York, Rubira’s,
Bull and Mouth, Jimmy Richardson’s and
Parer’s. Antonio’s, a watersiders’ hotel
in Flinders Street, Walter Scott (Eliza-
beth Street) and Temple Court (Queen
Street) and some others are recent
casualties.
Although retailers in Sydney are
occasionally reported to be looking to the
suburbs for new business, in Melbourne
it is every man for himself in the struggle
for advantageous retail-space in the city ;
and the prices they are prepared to pay
make hotel-keeping comparatively small
beer at the price the hotel-site will bring.
This real-estate is also keenly sought for
office-buildings and occasionally by
banks for branches.
It is now difficult to amass a fortune
in any but the most successfully con-
ducted large hotels, and many publicans
' claim that despite the high ingoing they
can make only a comfortable living. Pub
profits have been deeply cut by the in-
crease in licensing-fees and excise and
the steadily increasing number of licensed
clubs.
The issuing of club-licences in country
towns has a sharp effect on the local pub.
Fifteen country hotels have shut in the
last few years ; some have been burned-
down and have not been considered
worth rebuilding at current prices; such
extensive alterations have been ordered
in others that the owners have found it
more economic to surrender the licence;
but chiefly the town club has been
responsible.
The licensed local club is regarded as
little more than a drinking-shop. It is
not required to meet the costs of the
publican, to provide food or accommoda-
tion, and members usually may take
away bottled beer at any time. These
clubs provide a service for the local
citizens, but they offer nothing for the
travelling public.
Since the Licensing Court was estab-
lished with Judge Fraser on the bench
in June, 1954, about 60 club-licences have
been granted. The judge has been wary
in granting them because the results soon
became apparent, and now, for these
reasons, and other minor causes, the
accommodation-position in Melbourne
and some country centres may soon be
acute as the old-fashioned pub disappears.
The Licensing Court has also granted
few licences to grocers, since the bottled-
beer trade is an important source of
revenue to the pub and the loss of it
might prove the final blow in closing
some neighboring hotels.
In his last report Judge Fraser drew
attention to the packing of hotel-bars
as competition declined, and to the loss
of bedroom accommodation, and he pro-
posed the division of hotels into those
which provided a bar-service only and
paid a comparatively high licence-fee and
others which offered good meals and
accommodation at a lower licence-fee.
The new Parliament might well con-
sider this elementary justice. It has been
suggested by a judge who turns-up fre-
quently in the public bars to see for
himself what is happening in them, travels
extensively in the country, and is intensely
interested in making the new Act work
in the common interest.
TV and Politics
[By “Ex-ACT”]
Politics is likely to get curiouser and
curiouser with the slow but certain inter-
vention of television. It has been used
in the U.S. for several years, of course,
with etfects rather difficult to assess.
The 1952 Presidential campaign was
the first full-scale TV election, and in that
period the national interest in the tele-
vised political conventions which selected
the candidates was intense. The two
candidates themselves became inured
during their travels to the omnipresent
cameras.
Adlai Stevenson was quite at ease
from the first, but “Ike” began by glaring
into the lens, and by resisting the make-
up experts as long as he could. However,
they got him into training fairly quickly,
and the scenes of his enthusiasm and that
of his followers on election-night were
something to see.
The TV-screens on that night also cut
by an estimated two-thirds the crowd
which normally gathers in Times Square,
New York, to see the strip of newslights
around the old “New York Times” office
spell-out the results.
Now Britain has had its first televised
election-meeting (in the by-election
campaign which shocked the Conserva-
tives and gave the Liberals some hope of
revival), and in Australia there have been
discussions both about the part TV will
play in the coming Federal and State
campaigns, and eventually in the tele-
casting of Parliamentary proceedings, in
part or in whole.
In Britain, the famous meeting in the
Rochdale electorate brought the candi-
dates to the firesides of the electors who
certainly wouldn’t have stirred out to sit
in a draughty hall to listen to anybody.
Whether the same technique will prove
useful in Australia, and whether it will
mean the downfall of the candidates of
least prepossessing appearance, remains
to be seen.
Television programmes can’t be
planned or screened in a day or two, and,
except for the national leaders, not many
of the members of Parliament would be
likely to gain good Hooper ratings in
opposition to Hopalong Cassidy on some
rival channel.
Then there is the question of expense.
If the commercial stations are to be
used by the parties, in addition to the
possible complete TV-coverage of the
policy-speeches, then all funds, including
those needed for other media (to use the
advertising jargon) will be sadly depleted.
Perhaps the Liberals will think it
worth subsidising Labor to put Dan
Curtin on the screens, and maybe Labor
will try to sneak-in some shots of the
Government benches in the Senate on a
warm evening. It’s all very interesting
speculation especially for the TV-
stations looking at their balance-sheets.

which touched on the Swiss chalet stand-

War I the chalet stood in one of the
terrace-gardens of Cobham Hall, Kent,
seat of the Earl of Darnley. Half of the
hall was an A.I.F. convalescent-hospital
for officers; about 1500 convalesced
there. If the chalet has been moved back
to Gadshill then it is its third move.
Prefabricated, it was brought from
Switzerland and erected in a shrubbery
lying on the other side of the Dover
Road from Gadshill. The shrubbery was
reached by a subway beneath the road ;
Dickens had it excavated specially for the
purpose. In the summer Dickens did
much of his writing there instead of in
the library at Gadshill. He wrote that
when he sat at his desk in the upstairs-
room of the chalet, “up among the
branches of the trees,” he could see
reflected in five mirrors “the leaves
quivering at the windows, and the great
fields of waving com, and the sail-dotted
river.” The river, of course, was the
Thames.

glance for a particular sign became one
of anxious concentration. Inspections
completed, the position was getting
uncomfortable on the run home when
dusk and a rural patch arrived together.
With a muttered “’scuse-me, sir,” the girl
stopped the car and sprinted across to
the bushes. Returning, red-faced and
with eyes averted, she jumped into the

back to base. She’d gone 10 miles before
she noticed she had no passenger. There

memory has lost its title. The heroine,
one of the Cole girls, had put-up with
most of the tribulations that can befall a
heroine of melodrama, when the final
scene revealed her bound to the pole in a
bear-pit. Kids in the audience, hardened
to most blood-and-thunder, shrieked

that infests the Haymarket and Surry
Hills and style themselves the ‘Bummer
Gang’.” Asked to explain the meaning of
that term, the constable replied that it
meant a rescuing-party. “If any one of
them gets into a row,” he added, “his
fellow - bummers will assist him.”
Although familiar with most of the titles
of old-time pushes, I hadn’t previously
heard of the Bummer Gang; nor did I
know that the word “bummer” (which
I’ve always taken to mean a cadger, a
“bot”) was once applied to a pushite who
went to the rescue of a mate in distress.

me. But I was still humming the old

on the tram, I take off my hat and let him
'have his pick—then, when I feel he is
getting slightly exasperated, I produce the
correct one from my pocket! ”
“Cegar”: ’Twas a beautiful launch, a
thirty-footer, boasting just about every
marine refinement and a few more
besides. The sun shone, the waves waved,
and the owner, nautical cap tilted at the
Beatty angle, stood at the wheel. Every-
one on the-pier was as impressed by the
launch as by the crew —owner’s girl-
friends, dressed more naughtily than
nautically, and draped on the cabin-roof.
The boat made a wide circling movement
around the pier-head to the plaudits of
the onlookers. Encouraged, the owner
decided to give them a thrill. He swept
under the pier, intending to shoot out on
the other side. Clearance on the far side,
however, was much less than he estimated
and the whole of his crew made a clear-
ance into the briny. When the boat
emerged, the gallant skipper was doing a
solo run. By the time he’d circled the
pier-head and come back, the water was
full of young men filled with an over-
powering urge to rescue the bikini-belles.

OUT OF THE FILES
The Manager,
Bilku Knitting Machine Co.
Dear Sir,
Recently I purchased one of
your alleged machines with
the object of making myself
independent of my women-
folk. Wishing to begin on
something simple, I tried my
hand out on a knitted woollen
tie, following faithfully the-
instructions and the pattern
given.
It was a ribbed pattern. If
7 had as many broken ribs as
the completed article had to
every inch there would be
nothing- to stop my epiglottis
from dropping straight on to
my pelvis. Also,, there seems
to have been a mistake as to
quantity of wool to be used,
for when I put the finished tie
around my collar I was able to
tuck the ends into the tops of
my socks.
The tie in its present state is
useless. I therefore request an
immediate reimbursement for
all the wool wasted, caused
through your company’s gross
negligence. Please forward the
£2 10s. at your earliest con-
venience.
Yours faithfully,
Sebastian Z. Swufflecronk.
Mr. Sebastian Z. Swufflecronk.
Dear Sir,
Regarding your complaint of
the 24th inst., before we can
meet your claim we would
need to obtain further infor-
mation germane to the alleged
failure of the knitting-machine
we supposedly supplied you
with. As soon as we . receive
your accurate replies to the
questions set-out hereunder we
will be in a better position to
determine where the putative
fault or faults lay. These are:
(g): Was the wind blowing
from the n.-n.-w. at the time?
(b) Had you, immediately
prior to starting the knitting,
gargled your throat?
(c) Did you feed the wool
into the machine quickly?
(Were it fed-in too quickly you
would have heard a distinct
burp.)
(d) : Was either the machine
or you oiled at the time you
were supposedly operating it?
Yours faithfully,
Cadwallader Cudd,
Manager.
The Manager,
Bilku Knitting Machine Co.
Dear Sir,
In reply to yours of t£e 25th
inst. regarding my complaint
of the 2nd idem, I supply here-
under the answers, seriatim,
appropriate to the questions
you put:
(a) : Because the steadier the
clearer.
( b ) The use of the word
“gargle” is forbidden in our
house, due to my wife’s strong
religious views.
(c) : If it were skinnier, yes.
id) : Thick cirrus cloud at
the time unfortunately pre-
cluded my making an accurate
observation.
In the meantime I am trying
my hand at a pair of long
woollen underpants, and I trust
that the instructions given for
the making of these will prove
more satisfactory than those
for which you euphemistically
refer to as a tie in the extrava-
ganza which you flatter by the
name of advertisement.
Trusting the information
supplied will enable you to
determine how your alleged
machine came to misfunction
so badly.
Yours faithfully,
Sebastian Z. Swufflecronk.
Mr. Sebastian Z. Swufflecronk.
Dear Sir,
Reference yours of the 29th
ult. Whilst it is naturally
pleasing for the company to
see its product put to as wide
a variety of uses as possible,
we feel you would obtain far
more satisfactory results were
you to try a garment more
simple in make yet equally
useful for you personally than
underpants. We therefore
suggest that you try making a
snappy spencer-bodice with a
really ducky scalloped edge.
You could attempt the under-
pants later, for we feel that
your wife—for whom they are
obviously intended—will appre-
ciate your by - then more
advanced craftsmanship.
Apropos of the reimburse-
ment which you requested, this
will be put to the next meeting
of the full board of directors,
which will take place as soon
as Mr. Entwhistle Snerf, our
managing - director, returns
from his 12-months’ overseas
tour, which he began last
Thursday.
Yours faithfully,
Cadwallader Cudd,
Manager.
The Manager,

Dear Sir,
I took the valuable advice
contained in your letter of 12th
ult. and tried-out your alleged
machine in the making of a
pair of woollen underpants. I
meticulously followed the
pattern and instructions con-
tained in the booklet which
came with the thing, and I beg
to report the following results:
The top of them fitted me
so tightly around the throat
I had to be slit out of them
quickly on trying them on,
otherwise I might have been
strangled. The fork dragged
along the floor as I walked.
Also, one leg was 2in. below
the thigh, whilst the other was
Min. beyond my big toe. If
I had measured four toma-
hawk - handle - lengths around
the hips there would still have
been enough room in the
seat of them to conceal
an overnight-bag. Other-
wise they were a perfect
fit.
Incidentally, I would
like to be informed by
return - post if the
mechanical contrivance I
bought from you is suit-
able for peeling onions,
re-tailing shirts, sharpen-
ing knives, mixing drinks,
cancelling cheques,
polishing shoes or as any
other aid to tedious
manual labor. Perhaps it
is possible to knit with it, but
at present I am not prepared
to invest in a bicycle-pump,
an electronic-brain, a sextant
and a theodolite, without which
accessories it apparently can’t
knit.
Yours faithfully,
Sebastian Z. Swufflecronk.
Mr. Sebastian Z. Swufflecronk.
Dear Sir,
You are apparently under a
misapprehension regarding the
usefulness of the underpants
you made on your machine.
Were you able to break away
from your 1894-model think-
ing and study the latest
fashion-trends you would be
aware that woollen underpants
\yith strangulable necklines,
70in. seats and remarkably
odd-length legs are the very
latest mode —a style which
owes its popularity to its lack
of monotony and the fact that
it cuts away from stuffy con-
vention.
Regarding your other ques-
tion, it is possible, we believe,
for our machine to be used
efficiently as a combined gravy-
strainer, potato-masher and
sock-stretcher.
Yours faithfully,
Cadwallader Cudd,
Manager.
The Manager,
Bilku Knitting Machine Co.
Dear Sir,
You can cut all further
cackle except on one note —
and that one signed jointly by
the governor of the Common-
wealth Bank and the Secretary
to the Treasury. I demand
refund immediately of the
money I wasted on excessive
quantities of wool for the tie,
as claimed previously.
Yours faithfully,
Sebastian Z. Swufflecronk.
Mr. Sebastian Z. Swufflecronk.
Sir,
With reference to your last
eight letters. On turning-up
our records we find that the
only customer of ours by the
name of Swufflecronk was a
Sebastian X. As this doesn’t
tally with your second initial,
it must have been another
person altogether to whom we
supplied one of our machines.
We therefore must disclaim
all responsibility for any failure
of your machine, which so
patently did not come from
this establishment.
We regard the matter, there-
fore, as finally closed.

POLITICAL POINTS
If Playford followed Cahill’s example
and opened a New York office it wouldn’t
be long before General Motors, U.S. Steel
Corporation, Duponts and Standard Oil
found that* their headquarters had been
shifted to Adelaide.

Victorian Transport Minister Warner
raised a hullabaloo when he claimed it
would be seven years before an under-
ground rail-link could be begun in
Melbourne. Then he announced the
formation of a new committee co-
ordinating all interests to push ahead
with the project. A new committee has
always been an effective device for
shutting-up critics, as an earnest of
Cabinet interest and action and an oppor-
tunity to let them talk their heads off.
But this time the critics say they don’t
want a new committee ; they want a new
tube.

The rural committee of the N. S.
Wales Liberals, which comprises 23
farmers from many parts of the State, has
recommended that at the next State
elections the party should advocate the
abolition of the f.a.q. system of market-
ing ' wheat. David Fairbairn, M.H.R.
for Farrer, who moved the resolution,
told the committee that N. S. Wales
farmers had difficulty in selling their
wheat abroad because grain with a
protein-content varying from 7 per cent,
to 17 per cent, was all lumped-in together.
Separation on the lines of the new
South Australian method is advocated ;
this entails segregating wheats according
to variety and district. The suggestion
is that different districts should be pro-
vided with lists of the varieties which
would be acceptable from them, both
here and abroad.
• •
Labor M.H.R.s are agitating for an
increase in pensions. Not age- or invalid-
pensions—Parliamentary pensions.
• •
Officers of the Victorian Railways have
been studying haulage-costs and have
come up with the warming assurance
that they are lower than in any other
State, that the maintenance-cost of diesel-
electric locos is lower than in many U.S.
networks and that altogether the Vic-
torian Railways is maintaining its lead
as the most efficient State system. And
as for the deficit, that runs a new record
every month.
Although Melbourne City Council
elections will not be held until August,
non-Labor opponents of the Civic Group
already are in the field getting strong
candidates and offering advice and
helpers by advertisement in some wards.
The Civic Group won control of the
council by claiming itself young and
non-Labor ; but its members are them-
selves now creeping onward and the
mere proclaiming of a non-Labor outlook
isn’t likely to inspire ratepayers against
another non-Labor candidate.

Opposing the Fire Brigade Assessment
Act in the N., S. Wales Legislative
Council, E. L. Sommerlad (C.P.) said
the approach to the problem of financing
fire-services in Australia was wrong. It
was inequitable that insurance companies
should pay 75 per cent, of the costs and
the Government and municipalities only
one-eighth each. Forty per cent, of all
property was uninsured, and so made
no contribution through premiums to
fire-brigade maintenance, although it still
enjoyed the protection of the service.
The system of financing through
premiums was really a tax on thrift to
help those who would not look after
themselves.
Sommerlad quoted a British royal
commission on fire-services which said
there seemed to be no more reason for
the fire-departments of insurance com-
panies to subsidise fire-brigades than for
their marine-departments to subsidise
lighthouses or the burglary-departments
to subsidise the police. Come to think
of it, there doesn’t, either. Fire-services
in the U.K. are now a municipal respon-
sibility, with a subsidy from the U.K.
Government.

A U.K. Treasury bulletin reports a
remarkable increase in personal savings
in Britain over the past six years. This
movement began in 1952 when the rate
jumped from an average of about 2 per
cent, in the years 1948-51 to about 6 }
per cent 7 . This rate was maintained in
the next two years, then rose to 8 per
cent, in 1955 and 10 per cent, in 1956.
For the first nine months of last year
it was around 11 per cent.
This rate, says the Treasury bulletin,
may not compare unfavorably with that
ruling in the decades before 1914, and
• it is certainly higher than that prevail-
ing in the United States. The increase
has helped finance the investment boom
and has greatly strengthened Britain’s
economy.
• •
Labor antics over the Landlord and
Tenant Bill were of the off-again, on-
again, gone-again, Flannigan variety.
First Billy Sheahan accepted Liberal
M.L.A. Black’s amendments and thanked
the Opposition for its co-operation. Then
the Labor Council raised merry-hell and
Labor zone-conferences demanded instant
action to reverse this betrayal of the
tenants to the landlords. There was talk
of caucus revolt and 12 back-benchers
called for a special meeting of caucus to
discuss the amendments. A deputation
from the Labor Council and the State
A.L.P. executive called on Ministers
breathing various brands of fire.
After all that the protests collapsed;
the amendments were introduced in the
Legislative Council, approved and passed.
The barney that was to have been staged
in caucus was then transferred to the
Trades Hall, where the deputation had the
apparently difficult job of explaining
what Cahill and Co. had explained to it.
• •
Roy Morgan’s Gallup poll on whom-
do-you-want-to-lead-youj-party showed
Menzies still strong in Liberal circles
(77 per cent.) and the Doc. well ahead of
all others in A.L.P. favor (57 per cent.).
But the D.L.P. voters apparently prefer
to be a leaderless legion. Their tally
read: McManus, 3 p.c. ; Joshua, 3 p.c.;
Menzies,. 3 p.c.; Evatt, 2 p.c. ; Gair,
2 p.c. ; Ward, 1 p.c.; Fraser, 1 p.c.;
others, 1 p.c. The other 84 per cent, just
didn’t know whom they wanted. Nor,
apparently, did most of those who
thought they did.

Ampol’s 32,000-ton tanker to be built
at Whyalla will be the largest vessel ever
built in Australia,' but it may not hold
that honor for long. lan McLennan,
chief general-manager of 8.H.P., says his
company is considering designs for a
40,000-ton ore-carrier. If proceeded with,
it will pose some difficulties for port-
authorities. Even the 19,000-tonners now
under construction at Whyalla present
problems; McLennan says there is
no port in Australia into which they
could go fully loaded. Presumably he
means no port to which iron-ore would
be likely to be taken. The big ships are
to be used exclusively between Yampi
Sound and Port Kembla; the inner
harbor at Port Kembla is being dredged
to accommodate them.

One of the results of the division of
Germany is that the Duden dictionary,
the classical authority on the spelling
and meaning of German words, is appear-
ing now in two different versions. A
comparison shows that many words in
the Soviet-controlled zone are taking-on
different meanings, a not-unfamiliar
phenomenon to students of Communism.
For example, “internationalism” is
defined in East Germany as “the idea of
a common struggle among the working-
classes in all countries,” and “democracy”
as “a form of government, the nature of
which is determined by whatever class
is in power.” Many other changes give
reason for thought, not the least being
the conflicting definitions of “atheism-”
In the West it is described as “denial of
the existence of God”; in the East as a
“scientifically founded denial of the
existence of God.”


Cahill leaves for America on Saturday
to open his Government’s New York
office and to initiate a drive to attract
American industries to N. S. Wales. There
seems to be a strong suspicion that he’ll
also have a .good-look-round to see
whether the job of bossing the N.Y.
office is congenial enough to retire to.
Now why should people think things
like that?

The beautiful friendship of B. and K.
has come to an end, with K. taking-over
B.’s job as Prime Minister of Russia and
retaining his own as secretary of the

the horrible personality-cult that K.
abhors so much.

Leslie Arthur Wood, Leader of the
Opposition and the A.L.P. in the
Queensland Parliament, died suddenly
at his home at Toowoomba on Saturday.
Only 50, he had represented North
Toowoomba since 1950; he became
leader of the A.L.P. when John Duggan
lost his Seat last August.
• •
Capture by the Liberals of the Torring-
ton seat in the House of Commons means
the British Government’s third by-
election defeat in two months. Under the
first-past-the-post voting-system Liberal
Mark Bonham Carter, grandson of one-
time Liberal Prime Minister Asquith, was
elected with 13,408 votes to his Conser-
vative opponent’s 13,189. A Labor
candidate scored 8697.
British Liberals arri hailing the victory
(which increased their representation
from 5 to 6) as a sign that the party is on
its way to a major revival. That’s very
wishful thinking, but will most likely
mean a big crop of Liberal' candidates
at the next general election. They are
not likely to win a great number of seats,
but their intrusion could be the means of
the Conservatives losing a lot of seats
to Labor—the Rochdale by-election was
an illustration of this. It’s a wonder
Macmillan and his party-managers haven’t
started thinking of preferential voting and
a pact with the Libs., who would stand
to gain much from p.v.

A by-product of the chain-store war
has been a reduction in price of sample-
bags at the Royal Easter Show. There
was a time when these were sold at a
nominal charge 'as an advertising gesture,
but since the war they have been
unabashed moneymakers. This year
some of the bags seem to be selling really
below cost.

Joske’s Divorce Bill, introduced as a
private-member’s bill last session, has
given way to a Government bill, now in
course of preparation. Menzies says
the new bill will not be treated as a party
matter; Government members will be
tree to vote as their consciences dictate.
Menzies says Joske’s work has been
of great value to, those preparing the new
legislation.

It was reported last week that while in
New York Cahill would discuss with
American tunnelling-experts the feasi-
bility of boring a tunnel under Sydney
Harbor. He won’t have much spare time
between now and Saturday, but it might
be worth his while getting in touch with
the geology school at Sydney University
to find out all that is known about the
rock-structure underlying Sydney Harbor.
And while in New York he shouldn’t miss
the chance of haying a look at the Lincoln
tubes under the Hudson River which are
similar to the “pipeline tunnels” suggested
by Sydney engineer D. R. Carter qnd
rejected by Cahill. The first Lincoln
tube has been in use for over 50 years ;
the third was opened less than a year ago.

Seventeen years ago John McEwen was
within an ace of becoming Leader of the
Federal Country Party and Deputy Prime
Minister. In a ballot for the leadership
he tied with Earle Page ; a second ballot
gave the same result and Arthur Fadden
was nominated to break the deadlock.
Last week, as a result of the resignation
of Fadden, McEwen stepped into the two
jobs he so narrowly missed in the early
years of World War 11.

Bringing out Britons! Single men and
women and childless couples between 21
and 45 are now eligible to apply for
assisted passages from the United King-
dom without being obliged (as they have
been in the past) to secure Government
or private sponsors. They will have to
find their own accommodation arid jobs,
but may apply for temporary lodgings in
Government hostels. Announcing this,
Immigration Minister Downer said the
scheme was an extension of the existing
assisted-passages scheme under which
British families were able to come to
Australia.

“Ex-ACT": When the Prime Minister
was asked about a publisher’s announce-
ment that his firm would publish R. G.
Menzies’ memoirs when he wrote them,
“probably after his retirement from
politics,” he was a little coy. He said
he’d read the announcement “with
fascinated interest,” and added that he
hoped the day was a long way off,
although it depended on the electors.
Quoting Henry V, he added that the
purpose of memoirs was to “remember
with advantages.” He didn’t amplify
that comment.

ANOTHER LANDLORD-AND-TENANT AMENDMENT


PERSONAL ITEMS
On Sunday (March 30), at the Garden
Island Chapel, a plaque was unveiled in
memory of Johnny Bull, Captain (E),
R.A.N., the most popular general-
manager Garden Island has ever had.
He joined the R.A.N.C. in 1919, and died
in harness in December, 1956. His book
of R.A.N. poems may never be pub-
lished, which is a pity, but many of them
are well-known by his messmates ; and
one line, “Bang went his M.V.0.,” from
a piece written in H.M.A.S. Australia
returning to the U.K. with the Duke of
Gloucester, went resounding through the
R.A.N.

From “A.W.”: Leslie Sage, who died
suddenly in Sydney, was an outstanding
organist and teacher: I think if he’d
given-up his teaching-practice and stuck
solely to organ-playing he would have
become widely known, perhaps famous.
But he wasn’t after glory ; he was more
than content to see his pupils succeed.
Generous with his time (I recall how he
invariably extended my piano-lessons by
a half-hour and more), he had a knack of
putting-over his musical ideas, frequently
by illustrations at the piano. His organ-
extemporisations were touched with
genius.

Mr. Justice Finlay, senior puisne
judge of the New Zealand Supreme
Court, retires with a. new job in hand —
he has been appointed to advise the N.Z.

Reps, by the National Government last
year. Sir George (his knight-bachelor
was in the 1955 New Year’s honors-list)
MR. JUSTICE FINLAY
was born in Thames (N.Z.), served two
terms as Mayor of Te Kuiti, where he
practised law in partnership with W. J.

William Hull, a slim, dark, 28-year-old
Canadian here on a Carnegie Fellowship
from the Commonwealth Study Centre at
Duke University, North Carolina,
dropped in at The Bulletin last week
to pick-up a cartoon which, he thought,
illustrated the lighter side of his study—
broadcasting. More specifically, he’s
inquiring into the problem of ministerial
responsibility in such public corporations
as the 8.8. C., our A.B.C. and the
Canadian show, the C.B.C. The Com-
monwealth Study Centre, set-up at Duke
University a few years ago, seems at first
glance a curious phenomenon. But, as
Hull commented, it has proved a remark-
ably useful one for students from British
Commonwealth countries.

Last week’s crop of visitors to 252
George Street also included Colin
Wardele, 30, and Pat Bellamy, 52, both
from Wave Hill, N.T. They drove down
and will drive back —fairly soon, Pat
said. They’re getting a bit tired of the
crowds and the hard pavements. Wave
Hill, a bit under 8000 sq. miles of country
500 miles by road south-west of Darwin,
runs Shorthorns, breeds most of its herd-
bulls on the property, and buys some
good Shorthorns for this key herd from
Queensland. Pat quoted with amuse-
ment N.T. author Tom Ronan’s list of
the Territory’s principal exports and
imports as follows:
Exports: civil servants on leave or
transfer, beef-cattle, absconding debtors,
stolen horses (to W.A.), and hot air for
the southern press.
Imports: beer, civil servants, 10-
gallon hats, beer, journalists, people with
a grievance, stolen horses (from Queens-
land), beer, royal commissions, wife-
deserters, overproof-rum and more beer.

Stories about the lighter side of Army
life depend a good deal, as a rule, on the
sympathetic memories of the audience,
but Edwin Stanly (that’s right; no “e”)
Sutton, general-manager of E.R.L. and
very much an Old Digger type, before he
left in the Himalaya for San Francisco
unleashed a brace of genuinely funny
ones in The Bulletin office. A
foundation-member of Sydney Legacy 1
and a former vice-president, he went
away with the Ist Light Horse, was with
Fourth Divvy. Arty, in 1916, in command
'of a battery in T 7, came home on 1914
furlough in TB, and was C.O. of the 18th
Field Regiment for a time —before being
EDWIN SUTTON
grabbed for high-priority work as a
civilian —in War 11.
A recent reluctant convert to bowls
(at Killara Golf Club), he is now
an enthusiast. No sport, he says
—looking back on a fair range,
from football vto tennis —has given
him more pleasure; and a good
part of the pleasure comes from the
company. In America he’ll look in on
Bowser, Inc., whose products—meters,
petrol-pumps, and the like —E.R.L.
manufacture under licence in Australia.

“T.G.A.”: The report from Welling-
ton (N.Z.) of the death of Dr. Humphrey
Bede Oxenham recalls that famous
Sydney University Rugby Union team of
50 years ago.
It is indeed doubtful if a finer combina-
tion has been seen since those days of
1907-9. Many will recall the gruelling
tussles when 15,000 yelled themselves
hoarse when the ’Varsity played
Newtown and the rest on University
Oval. - «
The full line-up was as follows:
Backs: J. Verge, N. Barker, H. B.

Henry Alfred. Laurence Allibon is 67,
and that’s late enough, he thinks, to
give-up the general-secretaryship of the
Victorian Automobile Chamber of Com-
merce, a job he has held since 1929. He
was also foundation-secretary of the
Australian Automobile Chamber of Com-
merce, which was formed in 1943, and
one of the founders of the V.A.C.C.
Insurance Co.
Although he now settles for a quiet game
of golf at Huntingdale, Henry Allibon


years ago had a formidable reputation as
a left-hand bowler for Kew and Williams-
town, and one of the highlights of the
First World War; in which he served with
the Fifth, was being seconded to an
officers’ training-school at Cambridge,
being discovered by an Indian team and
getting-in three months’ cricket.
He has a nine-year-old daughter, so,
although free from his desk, he won’t
have time for overmuch golf.

After 38 years with Australian
Fertilisers, Ltd., managing-director T. H.
Williams called it a day on Monday
(March 31); retiring also from the board
of the associate company, A.C.F. and
Shirleys Fertilisers, Ltd., Queensland.
Secretary of the company when it was
formed in 1920, general-manager from
1930 until 1955, when he became
managing-director, Williams has seen big
changes in land usage, which, in turn,
have been reflected in the company’s
turnover —from £193,000 in 1922 to
£2,500,000 in 1957.

“Maitri”: Ernest Bryce, who has
passed on while holidaying in Britain,
was a Wealthy man who devoted much of
his money to worthy causes, took good
care his name never appeared on sub-
scription-lists, and supported a charity
only after he had personally investigated
it. Of late years he had given a good
deal to refugee-children Organisations.
Born in Hamburg, Germany, he came to
Australia many years ago, and was a fine
citizen of this country.
His property at Killara is an extra-
ordinary place to find in a Sydney
suburb ; it has some acres of virgin bush.
Only in front of the house, where trees
have been levelled to make way for a
lawn bordered by native shrubs, has any
concession been made to normal
suburban custom. Otherwise the place is
forest, timber crowding in on the dwell-
ing. Damage to the roof caused in
storms by falling trees was accounted a
natural hazard. To fell a tree because
of possible danger to the house was
unthinkable. At the bottom of this
private forest (where it borders on Lind-
field Park) is a playground of lyre-birds ;
one of the few places around Sydney
where they can be seen. Bryce was an
active member of just about every society
concerned with the preservation of
indigenous flora and fauna.
A great traveller, every year or so
Bryce and his wife would shut-up house
and next thing you’d hear was that,
despite his weak heart, they’d made
their way off the beaten track to the
hinterland of Turkey, to the Gobi
Desert or the Andes.

John L. O’Brien, an American visitor,

the U.S. is not exclusively inhabited by
Hollywood starlets, millionaires, cow-

tourists would like to see in Australia is
Australians and Australiana, not poor
imitations of Manhattan—the outback,
the Melbourne Botanic Gardens, the art-
gallery, a hospitable Australian family,
the native fauna and so on. No doubt
he has a fair idea of what Americans
want for their travel-dollars; he is
passenger traffic-manager of Matson

ABORIGINALITIES
VERY SMART BUGS
MILLER’S POINT, Sydney, has
become infested with a cockroach-
plague described by the City Health
Officer, Mr. C. Fegan, as one of the worst
in Sydney’s history.
This ancient, obnoxious insect has been
with us since swarms of its ancestors
came ashore from Governor Phillips First
Fleet. Of course, its own history goes
back much further than that —an esti-
mated 216-million years or so, making it
probably the earth’s oldest air-breathing
creature now living.
Through all those distant prehistoric
ages the world has been alternately
cooked, frozen, flooded, dried to a chip,
split by volcanoes, sunk beneath the seas
and erupted again. None of the turmoil
seemingly worried the cockroach. He
outlived most of his primeval companions
and came down through the aeons of time,
even thumbing his nose at evolution.
The shiny-backed, nimble fellow who
scuttles away among the pans when you
switch on the kitchen light is physically
the same cockroach that worried the
dinosaurs of the carboniferous age. It Is
friendless and unpopular largely because
of its scavenging and dirty habits. Prow-
ling after dark in search of food, it leaves
behind a foul smell from the liquid it
spits out to soften the morsel to be eaten.
Not fussy, it will sample anything it
comes across. With the digestion of a
concrete-mixer, a whole family of cock-
roaches can live comfortably for months
on a few bookbindings. Although
delicacies such as flour, honey and bread
are preferred, it will not turn up its nose
at a diet of whitewash, bootpolish, ink,
or leather.
If really hungry it has been known
to nibble at the eyelashes or fingernails of
Sleeping humans.
The cockroach has also repeatedly
proved itself partial to beer —particularly
one of its 1200 known species which is
common in North Queensland. This is
a giant variety, growing 3in. long and
weighing half-an-ounce. Dozens of them
will suicide in half-an-inch of beer
inadvertently left in a bottle overnight.
They have been also known to devour the
beer-sodden whiskers of a bearded drunk
after he dropped into alcoholic slumber
along some quiet bush track.
The Queensland variety, with a little
patient training, are also ideal subjects
for cockroach-racing. According to its
devotees, it is a fascinating sport long
popular in Egypt, India and China.
Specially bred insects (at their best at two
years) are raced on a track marked by a
light rope smeared with bread and honey.
In good condition a racing cockroach can
cover 50yds. in less than a minute.
r pHE cockroach multiplies and prospers
despite a frightening array of
enemies—humans, animals and insects —
all bent on destroying it. Men crush it
underfoot or knock it out with chemicals.
Lice and fleas drive it crazy. Wasps,
frogs, birds, dogs and cats eat it or, if
not hungry, like to kill it for fun.
That the cockroach is still around after
216-million years of such treatment proves
it must have developed living to a very
fine art. Long ago it learned intelligent
regulation of its love life, saving its
energies for developing a family in the
spring. The female cockroach lays about
16 eggs in a small leather-like case with a
built-in zipper arrangement of notches at
the top. Until the babies are born, the
mother carries the case around with her
by attaching it to her tail. After birth
the family lives as a unit in a snug nest
that is sacrosanct as far as neighboring
cockroaches are concerned.
Even if it is bursting with provender,
once taken over by one cockroach clan
the home and its contents are their pro-
perty and others who arrive merely wave
greetings and pass on to find another
place for themselves. The survival of the
breed has undoubtedly been due to these
peaceful habits and respect for others’
rights. Cockroaches never battle among
themselves. Wars such as the human race
indulges in are unknown and impossible.
The commonsense of the breed is evi-
dent in all its habits, as when scientists
once kept a collection of them alive
without food for 76 days. Heaped plates
were then placed before them. Without
exception they carefully dieted and
regulated their intake until their stomachs
could cope witi! the change.
THE physical make-up of the cockroach
has also helped it along the road to
survival. Its vision is phenomenal, with
no fewer than 1800 lenses making-up its
complicated eye-structure.
With its six nimble legs, it can take off
as though jet-propelled at the first hint
of danger. Its flat body can squeeze
into inaccessible cracks and hideouts. It
can be pushed under water and emerge
after 20 minutes with no other concern
but attending to its bedraggled
appearance.
Even a serious accident generally leaves
the cockroach unconcerned. If its
nose is lopped-off by an enemy, it merely
grows a new one. Legs and other lost bits
and pieces of the cockroach body are
similarly replaced with a hundred times
the efficiency of a human plastic surgeon.
The only thing the cockroach can’t
stand with equanimity is cold. At 35°F.
it is decidedly uncomfortable. At 23° it
dies. Ideal cockroach-temperature is
somewhere between 70° and 80°. Lower
it much below that and cockie starts look-
ing for new quarters.
Despite general revulsion at the insect,
cockroaches have from ancient times
been reputed as valuable in a variety of
quack remedies and cures.. Taken in a
drink, powdered cockroach has been des-
cribed as a panacea for dropsy. Some
herbalists use it in pills and prescribe it
as a digestive aid in sauces and salads.
Come what may in the future atomic
age, it seems long odds-on that if any
creatures survive on this planet the cock-
roach will be among them.

The two rear teats are thus slightly more
accessible to a tall calf, and although

“Kelms”: The fact that ants in
Abyssinia were repelled by eucalyptus
boughs (B. 5/3/’5B) emphasises the
eucalypt’s prior claim over the wattle as
Australia’s national flower. The acacias
are a large genus and some of them are
native to this conti-
nent ; but Abyssinian
ants wouldn’t find
anything strange in
them because they
occur naturally there
as well as in other
localities scattered
around the globe.
Gum - arabic, for
instance, comes
from Acacia Senegal,
which grows over a
large part of North
Africa, including
Ethiopia.- Eucalypts
also make up a large
genus, but most, in
fact practically all,
occur naturally only
in Australia. Those
Abyssinian spe c i-
mens were intro-
duced around some
of the cities there,
and apparently the
ants haven’t become
accustomed to them
yet. Another argu-
ment in favor of
the eucalypt as the
genus from which
our national flower
should come is that
amongst its great
variety occur some
of the world’s prettiest blooms. Once

blooms through Perth and was stopped a

sunset they lean to the west. Anyway,
I’d prefer to back “Wusslean’s” opinion
about sunflowers —their stems may not
twist or turn, but for most of the day the

at the front gate. Fortunately David

rummaging under his desk, preparatory to
joining the other kids in the playground.
Never before did his heavy features
appear so agreeable ; a transfer effected,

swivelled to the rffde tongue of tie poking

my tree-shinning days we never pierced
both ends of the egg. The needle was

“Buster”: Another method of “blow-
mg” an egg whilst making only one hole
in it is by using a heated bottle and
rubber washer. The washer is put over
the top of the bottle and the egg perched
on this. The washer will seal-off the air,
and as the bottle cools the vacuum will
draw the contents out of the shell.

Bacalao : Here is the classical
method of blowing birds’-eggs. The
egg is pierced on the side and with a
rotating movement a clean, round hole
is bored with a drill which has a hexagon-
sided point. Then a fine wire is carefully
inserted to break the yolk and the egg
gently shaken. Holding the egg, hole
downwards, a blowpipe with a bent end
is held to one side of the hole. A steady
pressure of air quickly empties the
contents. A small piece of cottonwool
impregnated with an insect-repellent is
then inserted, a piece of paper gummed
over the hole and the specimen is ready
for its case. As colored and marked
birds’-eggs fade in strong sunlight, they
are k e Pl in special cabinets. In most

SUNDAY IN WALCHA, 1866
[Extracts from an old manuscript, the author
of which is believed to b'e “the reckless Mrs.

N.S.W.]
’Twas on a Sabbath morning,
And brightly shone the sun ;
The bells would soon have rung foe
church
But alas they had not one.
And forth towards the holy Fane
The young and aged press;
Some go to shew their love for God
And some to shew their dress.
And foremost on his light-brown steed
That bounded like a fawn
Came Athol’s Duke, the young, the gay
And gallant Henry Gawn.
He paused to greet the fair ladies
And then pranced proudly by
With a winning smile upon his lips
And a lovelight in his eye.
Next came fair Agnes, fragile, tall
And gliding like a swan,
Whose fairy feet scarce seem to touch
The ground she walks upon ;
And by her side her sister tall
The queenly Minnie Hands,
With her last new Sydney bonnet on
And prayer-book in her hand.
Then came Jhe gay deceiver,
The far-famed Alfred Wauch,
The most accomplished lady-killer
Walcha ever saw.
Then who rides up so gallantly
Upon her sleek grey mare
With Sydney Swelltops’ billy on
And close-cropped curly hair?
’Tis the lady-killer’s sister
As great a flirt as he,
The all-accomplished wild and gay
And reckless Mrs. C.

And then came back again.

With solemn air and slow;

And then looked down below.
All are gone in; the church is hushed,
The summer sunlight falls
Upon its little quiet tower
And on the grey stone walls;
Upon the painted window

The pattern of it something like

Business, Robbery, Etc.
SHARE PRICES SLACKEN
CJOMEWHERE between the
beginning of February and
Easter each year there has
usually been a setback in the
Australian sharemarkets. Last
year it occurred in March, and
the same in 1956 ; in 1955 the
market kept rising almost con-
tinuously from January to July,
after which there was a steep
fall.
Whatever the reason or
variety of reasons—for this
“Ides of March” complex that
seems to affect the sharemarket,
it is a phenomenon that The
Bulletin commented upon
over 20 years ago. At that
time the overt causes were
different each year, but the
underlying reasons could have
been similar.
Last week—the last week in
March, 1958 —the Australian
sharemarkets took a dip after
rising almost steadily from the
setback that occurred just
before Christmas. Prior to that
there had been a sustained rise
during 1957 until September,
when evidence of drought!
momentarily but severely
shook the confidence of
investors.
- In March, prior to the
decline last week, the industrial
sharemarkets had regained all
the ground they had lost during
the ebb-and-flow in market
strength since the setback of
last September.
The boom in the best indus-
trials has been criticised on
these pages for the past year.
The low yields offering have
been pointed-out, and the more
difficult state of the economy
has been emphasised. In B.
19/3/’5B, at the market’s 1958
peak, it was said: “In the face
of all the circumstances, one
wonders how long the present
overall sharemarket-strength
can be maintained.”
It is difficult again to pinpoint
the particular reason for the
end-of-March setback to the
Australian sharemarkets, even
though one might be able to
detail several potent reasons as
to why the brisk rise that began
early in 1958 should never have,
occurred at all.
Something to whichrthe per-
sonal investor needs to
accustom his mind is the
influence of the institutional
investor on the market. This
influence tends to be a general
one, and rather indiscriminate.
Fixed trusts, staff provident
funds and insurance and
assurance concerns can afford
to take a longer view in buy-
ing shares than the small
investor usually can, and fixed-
trust buying in particular often
sends prices of good-quality
shares up to a point where.
their yield is unremunerative.
Against the contrasting back-
ground of strong buying-
support by such investors the
“Wed better review Clinton's expense-account
Australian economy as a whole
has decidedly suffered a reverse
over the past nine months, most
of our problems stemming
from the fall in wool prices and
the drought or ne~.r-drought
which prevailed over many
parts of Australia.
There has been a drop in
export prices for most com-
modities besides wool, and
metals have been particularly
affected. The break in metals
occurred quite early in the
piece, and, as suggested here at
the time, were a pointer to the
trend of the world market for
other raw materials.
Unemployment has become
a world-wide topic since
Christmas, and, although it is
by no means serious in Aus-
tralia, there are more people
unemployed now than at any
time during the preceding
year. This state of affairs has
affected some businesses,
especially retailers.
There has been an economic
“pinching” in most parts of
Australia since the end of the
1956-57 financial year. One
exception has been the
Queensland sugar industry;
but elsewhere, from the mines
at Broken Hill, Mt. Isa, Mt.
Lyell and Rosebery to the
wheat and wool districts, the
cattle-stations and a variety
of manufacturing industries
and the building-trades, there
have been price and other
difficulties to encounter.
Rutile-mining has suffered a
slump, and the speculative
activity in prospecting for oil
and uranium has fizzled right
out.
These things, though, didn’t
become known only last
week. They have been
chalked on the economic
blackboard for months past.
It is true that the overall pic-
ture didn’t show-up in the
balance-of-payments until the
first quarter of this year ; but
few authorities who studied
the position previously were
in any doubt but that the
seemingly favorable trade-
balance for July-December
was no guide to the likely
result for the full year.
Another curious feature of the
timing of the break in the
market, if not of the break
itself, was that it followed so
soon after the reduction of
the Bank of England’s
discount-rate from 7 p.c. to
6 p.c.
This was thought, by some
commentators as likely to
influence British investment
more Australia’s way than
had been the case since the
rate went to 7 p.c. last
September.
On March 24 Sraniforth
Ricketson, chairman of Capel
Court Investment Co., told his
shareholders that “we in Aus-
tralia may well see a definite
and probably continuing
downward trend in interest
rates.”
This, too, would normally
be a “bull” point in the share-
market. But Mr. Ricketson
based his opinion partly on
the belief {fiat “not all inves-
tors who have become accus-
tomed to having opportunities
of obtaining successive issues
of ordinary shares on advan-
tageous terms will be prepared
to commit their funds for a
term of years to company
notes or debentures —even
where share -. options are
attached. Many will un-
doubtedly prefer to seek the
greater security available in
the gilt-edged market, - and
hold their funds there until
the economic horizon becomes
clearer.”
A little earlier a Sydney
sharebroker, in a circular, had
advised a swing from equity-
shares to good fixed-interest
securities because he could not
visualise a static market, and
at that time thought Austra-
lian equity-shares were priced
at least highly enough.
Although Mr. Ricketson
visualised easier credit condi-
tions in Australia as a result
of central-bank policy and
similar factors, it is difficult,
at this stage, to expect a
greater abundance of capital
in Australia under world
economic conditions now
prevailing.
With export values down it
is likely that Australia at this
moment is creating less real
capital than it did during the
1956-57 financial year. Any
increase in the availability of
capital during the rest of this
year is likely to arise from
release of frozen bank-funds
and the like, and from —per-
haps —a fall in demand for
capital in certain quarters.
All of which, on analysis,
makes the outlook for equity-
shares on the Australian Stock

Exchanges look more clouded
than was the case during 1957
and emphasises the point that
some sharemarket reassess-
ment of the “boom in the
best” was really some months
overdue.
A General Fall
THE decline in share prices
which coincided with the
closing days of March was
fairly general in coverage, and
few of the recognised leaders
escaped.
8.H.P., which, ex-rights and
ex-div., had moved up to 445.
6d., slipped back to 425. 3d.,
and still was priced to give a
yield of just under 4 p.c. on
the current 8| p.c. div. basis.
With capital-expenditure an-
nounced two years ago and
the proposed outlay on the
Why alia steelworks now
added to it, it seems unlikely
that dividend-distributions will
be at all generous for the next
five years or more. The
ploughing-back of profits is
likely to remain a persisting
feature of B.H.P. finance for
some years to come.
The ords. in 1.C.1. took a
tumble of a couple of shil-
lings in last week’s fall,
C.S.R., British Tobacco and
nearly all the front-rankers
were marked-down, the banks
being no exception. Among
the comparatively few shares
which rose during the first
days of the setback there was
no particular pattern, except
that cos. which sprang
pleasant surprises on their
shareholders, such as
Mcllraths, naturally experi-
enced support rather than
selling-pressure.
The break in Australian
share prices followed at about
a fortnight’s distance the
fairly sharp fall on the New
Zealand Stock Exchanges,
which is discussed in more
detail in a report from a
Wellington correspondent on
page 31 of this issue of The
Bulletin.
Canning Basin Structures
[From Li. Owen]
TN a letter which appears in
A the current number of
the “Australian Journal of
Science,” two palaeontologists,
Writing from the University
of Western Australia and with
the permission of West Aus-
tralian Petroleum Pty., Ltd.,
amplify and elaborate the
stratigraphical information with
reference to the Canning Basin
which has been given in the
Wapet press-releases.
From the work done by
them, and by other specialists
who have worked in the area,
it is now accepted that the white
and grey “vuggy” dolomite
encountered at 2860 ft. to
3006 ft. in Dampier Downs No.
1 bore is of Lower Ordovician
age. It is, in fact, probable
that a hiatus exists, immedi-
ately underlying the Lower
Permian (Grant formation) at
2625 ft. in this well, which cuts
out the whole of the Carboni-
ferous and Devonian—as well
as the Silurian, which is not
known to exist in W.A. —and
the Upper Ordovician. At a
moderate estimate, this gao
represents a time-lapse of the
order of 200-million years.
In Roebuck Bay No. 1 well,
a similar hiatus occurs at
3354 ft., although the beds
underlying the Permian there
may be (doubtfully) of
Devonian age for the upper-
most 300 ft.
This contrasts, very
strikingly, with the column
penetrated in the Grant Range
well, where the Permian was
bottomed at the depth of
7900 ft. and the well then con-
tinued in shales, siltstones and
fine sandstones of Upper
Carboniferous age to the point
where drilling was stopped at
12,915 ft. without any signifi-
cant change in lithology.
This indicates that in the
100 miles or so of westing
which separates Grant Range
from Roebuck Bay—a column
of strata, at least 5000 ft. thick,
has been cut out.
The site of Dampier Downs
No. 1 bore is not on the direct
line from Grant Range to Roe-
buck Bay but lies south of it
about 60 miles w.-s.-w. of
Grant Range.
The explanation put forward
for the disappearance of this
huge column of Upper Carboni-
ferous beds in a comparatively
short distance is that Grant
Range was drilled on a trough,
now known as the Fitzroy
Deep and estimated to contain,
in parts, a total thickness of
sedimentary beds exceeding
30,000 ft.
I take it that the same
explanation is offered for the
results obtained in Cape Range
No. 2, which drilled through
11,000 ft. of almost unchanging
siltstone.
Similar thicknesses occur,
however, under specific sedi-
mentary and tectonic condi-
tions, in some South American
oilfields and in other regions
in which I have worked, and
the “trough” or “graben”
theory there is by no means uni-
versally applicable. In such
cases it is notable that the
exceptional thicknesses under-
lie surface structural “highs,”
just as they do in Grant Range
and Cape Range—to quote two
W.A. examples.
To me, one very significant
piece of information is that all
the Ordovician conodont fossils
recovered from cores, in the
Roebuck dolomite between
3920 ft. and 3930 ft., were
“frosted,” indicating movement
and reworking. I hope that
portions of the cores from
which these frosted specimens
were recovered are still avail-
able for examination; these
should provide data which—if
correctly interpreted—will give
valuable clues as to the

4714 ft. on March 25. This,
together with the Roebuck Bay
and Dampier Downs results,
suggests that the expectation of
striking oil has moved down
into the Cambrian. The in-
formation suggests, also, that
the Samphire Marsh well is
located on what is, at least,
a local structural high. This
gives rise to hopes that the geo-
physical data here are more
than the reflection of topo-
graphical “highs” in the pre-
Cambrian basement.
Company Accounts
[From “J.W.F.”]
HTHE recent information that
-*■ Australian Stock Exchanges
have amended their listing
requirements for unsecured
notes, and have prepared
standard forms for companies
to follow when issuing interim
reports and preliminary state-
ments of annual accounts,' is
welcome news, but I am of the
opinion that Stock Exchanges
should go much further in their
demands, particularly in
regard to the almost universal
lack of information in respect
of profits and losses of the
individual subsidiary companies
in the annual reports of the
parent organisations.
The total number of shares
which I hold, even if lodged
in one lump for sale with the
“odd-lots” broker of the
Exchange, would not cause a
perceptible flicker of his eye-
lid, yet to me they provide as
much interest as if I held
enough shares in each of the
companies concerned to force
myself onto their respective
boards.
My protest is that, in annual
reports, information as to indi-
vidual earnings of subsidiaries
or their individual dividend con-
tributions to the parent com-
pany are rarely given. Perhaps
I would be more correct if I
said that they are never given.
In the majority of cases the
chairman’s only relative
comments are along lines as
follows: —•
All subsidiaries but one contri-
buted to the combined net profit,
or
seven subsidiaries out of the nine
declared dividends during the year
under review.
I for one would be content
if the pictorial cartwheel show-
ing thick spokes denoting
wages, stores, and taxation, and
thin spokes for dividends and
moneys retained in the business,
were dropped from the report,
and I would cheerfully forgo the
story of progress, as given by
colored graphs, showing in
succeeding years total sales
made, total wages paid, total
miles flown, total areas planted,
total power generated, etc., if
in the space thus saved I could
be given in columnar form the
year’s gross earnings, working-
expenses, depreciation, taxation
and net profit and/or loss of
each subsidiary and the parent,
with a grand-total column
giving the combined figures as
required by statute.
It would not tax the ingenuity
of the usual bright accountancy-
student to so arrange the figures
as to show also dividends paid
and received, capital profits,
amounts written-off intangibles,
etc., and the increases or
decreases in the individual
reserves and undistributed
profits of each and every one
of the subsidiaries and parent.
I am quite aware that each of
the subsidiaries is a proprietary
company and not obliged to
give details of its trading, but
—well, why not do so in the
interests of its actual owners,
the shareholders in the parent
companies?
Whilst in the mood, may I
inquire why purchasers of
shares in many instances have
to wait an unconscionable
length of time between dispatch
of accepted instruments of
transfer and the receipt of new
certificates? If the delays are
due to the necessity to await
a meeting of the directorate
to authorise the issue of the
new certificates, then in many
instances the directors meet
evidently only at two-monthly
to three-monthly intervals.
Lastly, why do companies
making high percentages of
profit on capital, paying reason-
able dividends and adding
appreciably to reserves, con-
tinue to carry on the asset side
of their balance-sheets com-
paratively small intangible
assets, such as preliminary
expenses, goodwill, share-issue
expenses, value of rights under
agreement, etc. I know that
from an accountancy viewpoint
they are entitled to do so ; or
maybe they would advance as
a reason “remembrance value”;
but why unnecessarily clutter-
up accounts with so much
“deadwood”? I know of one
company, adding appreciably
to reserves each year, which still
carries as an asset a payment
made in respect of restriction
of service even though the
party to whom the payment
was made is now dead.

ART
Artbursts
R.A.S. Art Show
Whether or not one agrees
with art - competitions in
principle, there is something to
be said for the principle of
exhibiting paintings by Aus-
tralians at a Royal Show.
Artists, after all, no less than
breeders of cattle and pigs and
poultry, are producers . . . The
idea might even be extended to
writers: the spectacle of Pro-
fessor Hope, say, or Mr. Frank
Clune, declaiming from his
own works, like Charles
Dickens, to enthusiastic
crowds would be a cheering
one ; and, no doubt, it would
all rebound to the benefit of
Australian literature . . .
The crowd inspecting the
exhibition on the top floor of
the polka-patterned Arts and
Crafts pavilion at Sydney
Showground on Friday was
not a notably enthusiastic one
—one of two gentlemen voiced
loud astonishment at prices
which indicated that, in a few
cases, the artist valued his work
as high as the price of a good
cow —but it was, anyway, a
crowd, and that is more than
can be said for some of the
gatherings at city art-shows.
But this exhibition is also a
competition, with quite accep-
table prizes, amounting to £7OO
in the “rural” division, £5OO in
the “industrial” division, and
interest naturally centred on
the prizewinning paintings.
A. J. Murch’s “New England
Landscape” won first-prize in
the one, H. Flugelman’s “Brass
Foundry” and R. Fluke’s
“Steel Plant” shared first place
in the other.
It is entirely in the spirit of
stock - and - agriculture shows
to quarrel with the judge’s
decision, but it is hard to
criticise James Cook for pick-
ing Murch’s painting. It is a
windswept, darkening, hill-top
landscape with a somewhat
stylised lamb and ewe in the
foreground ; the< painting, in its
breadth and richness, and also
in the figures of the animals,
recalling the work of English
painters of rural scenes in the
18th century. But Lance
Solomon’s “Way to the Dam,”
(which didn’t get a place),
although the subject-matter
was less appropriate for the
competition (bush, but a type
of country common on this
side of the Blue Mountains),
seems, within a narrower com-
pass, to have more to say.
This, with its patch of burning
blue sky, its slender, tenderly
defined trees, its intense view
-—looking into the bush, so to
speak, instead of across it or
down on it —its balance and
style, if not one of Solomon’s
best paintings, is a very fine
piece of work:
Second prize in this section
went to “Ulawarra Landscape,”
by L. Rees, an impressive and
technically interesting impres-
sion of stone fences and sombre
country, massive shapes, an
emphasis on the geological
skeleton of the land rather than
the tender skin ; in fact, more
like sculpture than painting.
T. J. Santry’s “Landscape,”
which took the third prize, is
the sort of conception which
needs inspired painting and,
perhaps, luck, to come off.
Instead of a dazzling riot of
color, against which the figure
of a woman and child in the
foreground and the house in
the background are seen in a
light which, so to speak, both
pinpoints and obscures them,
the prevailing impression is of
lumpy, faceless figures and a
coarse blend of color. But one
could sympathise with the
intention.
In the industrial section,
judged by Douglas Dundas, R.
Fluke’s flat black-on-gold
pattern, shot with multi-colored
globes, is, within the fairly
severe limitations Of this
medium of artistic expression,
very good. It is decorative, it
has balance and harmony and a
sort of dull richness ; it is, at
any rate in my opinion, superior
to H. Flugelman’s “Brass
Foundry,” a view of men work-
ing in a lurid light, which,
where it should be demonic, is
merely florid.
“Rectification Section” by
J. Phillips, very highly com-
mended by the judge, has more
force and character than either
of the paintings placed above
it. It is an unusual view-of a
plant, with a massed, hard
glitter of automobiles below
a curving sweep of machinery.
It is vivid and concise, and
these, after all, are qualities
worth noting in a field of
human activity in which most
of us find little of the sublime
and the beautiful, and from
which very few artists
have so far selected any-
thing memorable to say.

Contemporaries
The Contemporary Art
Society at David Jones’s, Syd-
ney, has courageously given up
half its wall-space to a Rocke-
feller travelling exhibition of
“Contemporary Print-Making
in the U.S.” from the Museum
of Modern Art, New York:
works by 40 artists including
Will Barnet, Frasconi, Kohn,
Seong Moy, Karl Schrag,
Gabor Peterdi and Adja
Yunkers.
Apart from the interest of
the various kinds of prints,
which show very high tech-
nical quality, the effect of the
exhibition is to show, as did
the French exhibition, a firm-
ness of drawing, a control of
color and design and, above
all, a lightness of touch rarely
to be found among the Sydney
painters, many of whose works
still flounder in seas of paint as
crude as sump-oil.
For that reason, as well as
for its engaging title, it was
pleasing to come across Edgar
Aavik’s “In Concupiscence,” a
watercolor with a similarly
light touch. Ronald Steuart’s
bushfire, pretentiously entitled
“Ignipotent,” also sought for
lightness and, in rather a chalky
way found it; but Steuart can
do this sort of impression much
better in watercolor; and
straightforward water colors
better still.
Most of the paintings are
large abstract designs in stereo-
typed patterns. Raimund Gum-
pertz’s “Metamorphosis,” which
looks vaguely like a white
lizard, Dahl Collings’s “Palimp-
sest” with its bright quotations
from the palette, and lan
Wells’s “Barn Fire” animated
with zigzag horses are pleasant
enough offerings ; but the paint-
ings most clearly showing an
original force are, as usual in
recent months, those by
Thomas Gleghorn.
♦♦♦ ♦♦♦ +♦<•
Two contrasting view-
points are on show at the
Australian Galleries in Mel-
bourne. Murray Griffin’s lino-
cuts in color of brolgas, Major
Mitchell parrots, birds-of-
Paradise and other fauna are
sharply defined, definite, in-
cisive and detailed down to
the last feather. What the
birds lack is atmosphere to
breathe in. William Frater’s
trees, hills, skies and bush-
roads are vague, indefinite and
indecisive and there is a
slight murkiness, even in the
brightest sunlight, suggestive
of smog. As a tentative con-
sideration, if Mr. Griffin
borrowed some of Mr.
Frater’s air, and Mr. Frater
some Of Mr. Griffin’s definite-
ness, they might come together
on the common ground of
Nature.
Stage and Music
“lolanthe”
Gilbert’s satirical digs at the
House of Peers, which so sig-
nally failed to amuse Queen
Victoria, were given added
weight in the Firm’s production
of the opera at Sydney Royal
by two capital characterisations.
Terence O’Donoghue’s Earl
Tolloller and Eric Thornton's
Earl Mountararat were given,
by gesture and voice-inflection,
just the right degree of vague-
ness as to their Parliamentary
duties as to be in themselves
laughable. And they sang their
numbers with admirable clarity
and resonance.
The longest and most difficult
patter-song in all Gilsullivan —
the Lora Chancellor’s classical
description of a nightmare—
was steamed-through at high
speed by Grahame Clifford
with nary a word-casualty ; and
in every other respect he suc-
ceeded in quite wrecking the
dignity of the incumbent of the
Woolsack.
Jane Martin was an appealing
lolanthe, and her song of
suppliance to the Lord Chan-
cellor had a note of genuine
dramatic urgency to it. Roslyn
Dunbar played-off the two
scions of nobility agkinst her
chosen Arcqdian lover as to
the manner born, but vocally
she was slightly below her best
form.
Evelyn Gardiner, a Fairy
Queen of plump attraction,
sang “O Foolish Fay”—one of
Sullivan’s loveliest airs with
no little feeling. Kevin Foote
sang well as Strephon, but
needed to unbend a little.
The March of the Peers was
given a good mock-dignity, and
their chorus-work was reason-
ably good. The chorus of
fairies was slightly below
them in quality.

“A King in New York”
This latest Chaplin film
does nothing to lessen the
comedian’s ✓ reputation as the
screen’s most versatile genius.
He wrote the screen-play and
the incidental music (which
captures the light mood
admirably) and directed the
film. And he demonstrates
again and again his penchant
for coming-up with some
original touches to point-up his
satire.
The story concerns a comic-
opera European King who
bolts to the U.S, with the con-
tents of the national “peter”
and his Prime Minister, who
double-crosses his Royal
master and shoots-through to
South America with the loot.
The impecunious monarch,
while waiting to hear from the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commis-
sion regarding an invention of
his, restores his shattered
finances by unwittingly appear-
ing on TV, plugging com-
mercials —a field which gives
Chaplin scope for some of his
best comedy.
He has naturally used the
film as the vehicle for a
few hearty side-swipes at
some American institutions,
McCarthy’s committee com-
ing in for quite a few. But
the satire on the whole is
good-humored. His richest
ridicule is aimed at neurotic
teenage rock-’n’-roll addicts,
blare of jazz-bands in restaur-
ants, and, above all, the gyvo
and hooey associated with
high-pressure TV-advertising.
Some memorable touches
of typical Chaplin slapstick
include an occasion when,
descending in a skyscraper-
elevator, he idly pokes a
finger in the nozzle of the fire-
•hoze and, not being able to
release it, has to take the
entire hose with him into the
McCarthy commission....
There is another when, with
his Ambassador, he goes for
quietness into a restaurant
where a pianist is playing soft
classics; then a revolving stage
whisks a jazz-band’s drummer
a few inches from his head,
the din giving him a chance
for clever miming in trying
to tell the waiter what he
wants.
Another thing that Chaplin
can generally produce is a sur-
prise in casting. His leading
lady, Dawn Addams, is a
winner; and his 12-year-old
son Michael, as a schoolboy
genius who spouts politics at
the drop of a hat (there’s a
good crack here at fuzzy-
minded educators who hold
that children should in no
circumstances be repressed),
shows up well in his first role.
At Sydney Mayfair.

“The Rising of the Moon”
John Ford, himself an Irish-
man, directs this Irish trilogy
with keen insight into the
Hibernian character.
The first comedy has Cyril
Cusack as a police-inspector
of a village who goes to bring
to gaol a huge, gaunt peasant
(Noel Purcell) who has
cracked the head of a man
who had called him a liar,
with some illicitly-distilled
potheen on the side. The
character-work of these two
members of the Abbey Players
is brilliant.
The second comedy turns
on the various delays to a
little branch-line train at a
station where it is scheduled
to stay only one minute, with
a prize goat, a- football team,
an English aristo pair and a
matchmaking, > middle - aged
woman contributing to the
proceedings. Here again are
rich characterisations.
The third story, a comedy-
drama, is set in the time of
the Black-and-Tans, with the
rescue from the gallows of a
young Irish patriot supplying
both exciting drama and some
deft humor. In all three the
camera-work, is outstanding.

“The 5.10 From Yuma”
Directing of style and
character, well-developed ten-

Glenn Ford, held for the
murder of a stage-coach
driver, has his gang strategi-
cally placed for his rescue
from the law ; Van Heflin is
the man who pledges himself
to bring him to justice. The
struggle of minds between the
two is well conceived and
worked-out.

“I Accuse”
Europe’s greatest cause
celebre, the case of Captain
Dreyfus, goes under the
microscope in this film, directed
by Jose Ferrer, who also takes
the role of the staff-officer
falsely accused of treason on
forged evidence, stripped of
his rank and sent to Devil’s
Island.
The story Is clearly retold
and moves at good pace, and
no liberties are taken with the
known facts. The film’s one
weakness is that the second
court-martial, because of the
lack of dramatic impact, comes
as rather a tame anticlimax;
and it is not until the real
traitor, Major Esterhazy,
makes confession to the crime
by way of an autobiography
published in London, that
Dreyfus is finally exonerated
and honored.
A fine gallery of portraits
emerge. Apart from Ferrer,
who makes Dreyfus a meticu-
lous and efficient officer later
bewildered by disaster, there
is Anton Walbrook, as the
dissipated Esterhazy; Leo
Germ, as Colonel Picquard,
the only man on the staff to
befriend Dreyfus; Donald
Wolfit, as the ferociously
bigoted General Mercier;
Felix Aylmer, splendidly serene
and logical as Dreyfus’s
counsel ; and Emlyn Williams,
as Zola, whose read-
ing of his open letter to the
French President in Clemen-
ceau’s paper “L’Aurore” is one
of the dramatic highlights of
the film,

"THE DOLL” IN NEW YORK
r TO us students of Australian
literature from the New
York area, it was surprising to
find that a play, which we found
exceptionally good reading,
could have succeeded so
brilliantly in London, and
could have been treated as it
was by New York’s drama-
critics. While disagreement
between Broadway and the
West End is not uncommon, we
do believe that those criticisms
levelled at “The Doll” by the
New Yorkers reflect certain
attitudes which have little
place in sound literary criticism.
The reasons that have been
given by John Chapman and
co. for their general attitude
towards Ray Lawler’s work
vary from not being able to
understand some of its “Aus-
tralianisms” to maintaining that
the play was dramatically tepid.
Ignorance of Australian slang
and the subsequent inability of
the play to establish rapport
with a foreign audience might
lead some to say that the play
was too special for all but an
English or Australian audience.
The success of O’Casey and
Synge on the Broadway stage
does not seem to support such
a thesis, however.
A second aspect of the in-
ability of “The Doll” to com-
municate with the Broadway
critics may be attributed to the
fact that some New-Yorkers
find it difficult to conceive- of
white men cutting sugar-cane.
What this has to do directly
with the play, we do not know.
In a theatre where versimilitude
is overemphasised, the fact
that most of the sugar used in
the United States comes from
the West Indies or Hawaii, and
the subsequent tacit generalisa-
tion that only colored peoples
cut cane, reveals a kind of
provincial outlook that certainly
has no place in dramatic
criticism.
More important, however,
are those criticisms which have
been made against the play
itself. Even in Australia, critics
knew that the acting, while
good, was not always up to
Broadway or London
standards. Let us hope that
Rita Hayworth, James Cagney
and Burt Lancaster can make
up for any deficiency that was
felt in the stage production by
bringing that professionalism
to the screen version which was
so completely lacking in, let
us say, “Robbery Under Arms.”
Charges that the play gets off
to a slow start, and fails to
jell until the third act, in which
the illusory world which
Lawler has tried to create in
the first two acts is broken,
have more than some basis in
fact. While there is not much
action in the overt sense during
the first two acts, this lack is
more than compensated for by
the author’s attempt to re-create
a world of unconventional
middle-aged people failing to
resurrect once more an arrange-
ment which gave them pleasure
in their younger days., It
would seem that the critic who
had difficulty in understanding
the speech of the actors and
the critic who found it diffi-
cult to conceive of white men
being cane-cutters would have
appreciated the time given them
to become accustomed to the
Australian situation before the
fireworks began.
Nonetheless, the charge of
tameness which was levelled
against the play does hold
weight with regard to Broad-
way’s present concept of
“dramatic action.” “Dramatic
action” on Broadway today, as
exemplified by the relatively
recent successes of “A
View from the Bridge,”
“Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof,” “Long Day’s Journey
into Night” and “Compulsion,”
is largely equivocated with the
revelation of drug-addiction,
homosexuality, drunkenness
and incest. A situation in which
four people live together out of
wedlock for almost 17
summers and the ways in which
their practice has almost
become institutionalised, would
seem tame after an evening of
Tennessee Williams.
Enough has been said about
the depravity of taste on Broad-
way, and these Americans will
say little more about it. Still,
just as this preoccupation with
extreme forms of anti-social
behavior is present on Broad-
way, also present is a sub-
stantially richer diet of good,
new, serious dramatic entertain-
ment than has recently been
found in London. New York
drama-critics thus have less
“My ridiculous barber —he cant even lose a
minor argument !”
reason than their London
colleagues to welcome an over-
seas production.
“The Summer of the Seven-
teenth Doll” entered the Broad-
way sweepstakes at a time when
the influence of Eugene O’Neill
was still at its height.
There were four O’Neill
plays running on and off
Broadway last year, these
being the musical adapta-
tion of “Anna Christie,” “New
Girl in Town,” and the three
later dramas, “Moon for the
Misbegotten,” “The Iceman
Cometh,” and “Long Day’s
Journey Into Night.” This
revival of interest in O’Neill
was symptomatic of a general
revival of serious drama.
“Look Homeward Angel,”
“Look Back in Anger,” “The
Maids,” and “The Rope-
dancers” are among the best
of the newer additions to the
field. It may only be conjec-
tured that London welcomed
“The Doll” because good
dramatic plays have been few
and far between.
In other words, New York’s
specific criticisms of the play
seem to be peripheral, but the
frame of reference against
which their prevailing attitude
was formed, qualified only by
this strange preoccupation with
the sensational, should make
Australians realise that Lawler’s
play is a good one, but not a
great one.
The comparison between
Lawler and O’Neill, however
tacit, should be understood as
a compliment to “The Doll.”
More important, however, this
comparison, if articulated by
Australian dramatists and
critics, should provide the
means by which future Aus-
tralian dramas of greater artistic
significance can emerge.

Maurice D. Schmaier.


The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Henry Jones Co-operative, Ltd.
SIXTEEN months have passed since
the chairman of Henry Jones
Co.-op., Ltd., asked shareholders to be
patient “for another year or two” before
expecting additional benefits. Meanwhile,
the sharemarket, like the chairman, js
mindful of the fact that, in the appropriate
circumstances, the level of earnings
and the massive reserves built-up by the
co. could “quite reasonably justify a more
generous distribution.”
Acting on this belief —and, perhaps,
disregarding to some extent the co.’s con-
servative approach to financial matters
as well as the less-buoyant conditions
prevailing in the jam-making and
canning industries —the market has
shown few signs of accepting the one-
for-six par issue, planned for next June,
as the sum total of the short-term
rewards accruing to shareholders, pricing
the f.-p. £1 ords. at 61s. 3d. to return
£3 ss. 4d. from a 10 p.c. div.
When the new-issue scrip (if taken-
up) participates in divs., the yield on a
10 p.c. basis would rise to £3 12s. 3d.,
while a 15 p.c. div. on the enlarged
capital, or a one-for-two bonus-issue,
would lift the return to £5 Bs. sd. As
capitalisation of portion of the existing
reserves would render shareholders liable
for taxation, any bonus-issue would
probably be preceded by a revaluation of
fixed assets (for which there appears to
be ample scope), or the reconstruction of
the co.
All in ords., share-capital was last
altered in 1953, when a one-for-six par
issue raised the total on the share-register
to £2,115,000. The div.-rate has been
steady at 10 p.c. for 18 years.
A holding co., Henry Jones controls
a chain of subsidiaries Which, in turn,
own 21 large jam and fruit-canning
factories and numerous auxiliary plants in
Australia, New Zealand and South
Africa. The Tasmanian subsidiary is the
largest exporter of fresh fruit in Aus-
tralia and, in addition to its canning-
business, owns ships, timber-mills, box-
factories and orchards, acts as shipping-
agent and is the sole distributing-agent
for the only large-scale carbide-manufac-
turer in Australasia, the Australasian
Commonwealth Carbide Co., Ltd. The
group, which has an annual turnover of
approximately £15,000,000, also turns out
its own cans and boxes.
Competition in export markets,
together with the upward trend in local
manufacturing - costs mainly sugar,
fruit, wages, freight, etc. —narrowed
profit-margins last term, while a2B p.c.
jump in stocks suggests that the increase
in output was considerably greater than
the “slight” improvement in total sales.
Earnings from both Australian and over-
seas sources declined over the year:

holders and providing £453,510 (down

Although the profit, written after mak-
ing “ample provision for any foreseeable
contingencies,” was the lowest recorded
since 1952 it still represented a highly
satisfactory 25.2 p.c. on share-capital,
compared with an average of 30.8 p.c.
over the four preceding years, or 7.3 p.c.
on total shareholders’ funds.
The solid financial structure can be
seen from the balance-sheet, visible
reserves figuring at over two-and-a-half
times the size of paid capital and current
assets at 2.8 times current liabilities:

tion in the suspense account covered the
net £290,589 added to the book-value
of fixed assets and a £154,500 improve-
ment in working-capital (£3,824,082).
While the £716,700 increase in stocks,
shown at a (cost-or-under) value below
that accepted by the taxation authorities,
and the accompanying £665,014
contraction in holdings of cash, etc., left
working-capital in a less liquid form, the
need for fresh capital is not obvious from
the accounts and the board has yet to
inform shareholders of its reasons for
seeking additional funds.
Australian export and production
figures for both jam and canned-fruits
over the six months to December 31 last
were a little higher than those - for the
latter half of 1956 and early forecasts
suggest that the coming fruit-crops will be
better than those of last season. Never-
theless there seems to be small chance of
a significant increase in turnover in the
current term, and the level of earnings
may depend largely on the extent to
which manufacturing-costs can be kept in
check.
Conservative book-values gave the £1
ords. a net tangible backing of 71s. Bd.

Australian General Insurance
SHAREHOLDERS in most well-
established and successful insurance
offices can see a high degree of security
for both capital and income, and the
sharemarket acknowledges this fact, in
the case of Australian General Insurance
Co., Ltd., by pricing the co.’s Jss.
contribs. at around 485., to return
£3 18s. Id. 4 p.c. from a p.c.
distribution.
Australian General Insurance is
currently offering its members one new
share at par for every four already held,
a few “fights” to the new issue changing
hands last week at 30s. Receipt of the
15s. application-money, due on April 15
next, will give the co. a paid capital of
£187,500 in £1 ords. paid to 155., the
board preferring to issue new scrip rather
than reduce the uncalled liability
attaching to the “old” shares. The last
increase in paid capital was in 1954, when
a call of ss. a share brought in £50,000.
In common with other leading acci-
dent offices the co. regards investment-
income as the chief source of dividends,
and, on this basis, the addition to share-
capital is unlikely to affect the p.c.
div.-rate, last term’s investment-income
equalling 13.8 p.c. on capital as it will
stand on completion of the current issue.
Writing fire, marine and accident busi-
ness throughout Australia, the Sydney-
controlled A.G.I. has more than doubled
its premium-income over the past five
years, gross premiums . rising by
£103,435 to £867,514 last term (to
December 31) with reinsurances leaving
net premium-income £72,424 stronger at
£626,112. All departments contributed

However, the greater volume of
business involved the addition of
£30,000 (up £25,500) to the reserve for
unexpired risks (to bring it to an adequate
41 p.c. of net premiums) leaving the
underwriting-surplus £827 lower at
£14,661, and it was a £1153 improvement


in investment income (£26,029) that
nudged net profit forward by £326:

Queensland Cement and Lime Co.
■pNCOURAGED by the existing and
potential demand for’ cement in; the
northern State, Queensland Cement and
Lime Co., Ltd., announced last year
that it planned to lift plant-capacity from
300,000 tons to 500,000 tons of cement
annually by the installation of a third
large kiln. The new kiln is expected to
be completed in 1960. The board has
yet to reveal its plans for financing the
heavy outlay involved, but it seems
probable that shareholders will be asked
to help.
The co. is currently reaping the benefit
of a £1,000,000 expansion-programme
completed late in 1953, when a new
kiln, along with ancillary equipment,
became fully operational, lifting plant
capacity by 100,000 tons of cement a
year.
The sole manufacturer of cement in
Queensland for many years, the co.
holds a 17 p.c. share-interest in North
Australian Cement, Ltd., which com-
menced cement-production at Townsville
(Q.)T in 1954.
Since 1949 the annual output of cement
from Queensland Cement’s works at
Darra (near Brisbane) has risen from
around 150,000 tons to approximately
250,000 tons, but, aided by substantial
additions to share-capital, net earnings
have grown at a far more spectacular
rate, leaping from £21,431 to £170,419
over the same period.
Increased by a one-for-one par-issue
in 1952 and a one-for-three bonus-issue
in 1955, paid capital reached £1,567,561
late last year, on payment of a final
call on scrip issued, one-for-five, at par,
in 1956. There are 44,878 £1 8 p.c. first
prefs. and 187,122 £1 6 p.c. prefs., the
pref. div.-rates advancing point for point
with the ord. div.-rate when the latter
exceeds 6 p.c. Pref. shareholders also
enjoy the right to participate in new
issues. Average div.-rates over the last
five years have been 11.4 p.c. first pref.,
and 9.5 p.c. second pref. and ord.
The price of cement produced in
Queensland compares favorably with the
prices ruling in most other States, and,
with North Australian Cement selling
70,725 tons and Queensland Cement a
record 247,658 tons of cement (up
23,588 tons) over the year to July 31
last, no cement was imported into
Queensland from either Australian or
overseas sources during the last financial
year.
Greater efficiency in manufacture,
coupled with the larger output, helped
the co. to increases in the cost
of labor, coal, electric-power, etc., last
term without altering selling-prices, and
at the same time lift net earnings by
£22,411, or 15 p.c.:

Reckoned after allowing £160,305 (up
£14,386) for depreciation and making
“full provision” for taxation, the
£170,419 profit covered the minimum
pref. divs., 6 p.c. on average ord. capital
and 6.8 p.c. on total average capital
(pref. and ord.). In addition to net earn-
ings, a £20,000 provision “against pos-
sible losses of a subsidiary” was brought
to light, the full amount being trans-
ferred to reserves.
For the fourth successive term the
actual rates of distribution were first
prefs., 12 p.c., second prefs. and ords.
10 p.c., a liberal div.-policy (hardly a
disadvantage when seeking large sums
of fresh share-capital) limiting the
growth of reserves.
The financial structure was strength-
ened by the £200,227 put up by share-
holders during the year, and, with the
provision for depreciation exceeding the
£109,144 outlay on fixed assets, working-
capital increased from an inadequate
£39,978 to £340,693 :

The higher output and turnover were
reflected by heavier stocks (up £155,691)
and book-debts (up £91,648), the new
share-capital and retained earnings pro-
viding the funds necessary for these
movements as well as for the £65,375
reduction in creditors —under which
heading sundry creditors, bank-over-
draft, tax-provision and accrued charges
are combined in the published accounts.
Over the “last few years” Queensland
Cement has increased its sales at the
rate of approximately 10 p.c. each year
and the board, “taking into account all
factors, including the potentiality in
the Northern Rivers (district) of N.S.W.
and New Guinea,” is of the opinion
“that this rate of increase will continue.”

rent term, the net tangible asset backing

Creamoata, Ltd.
A DISQUIETING drift in earn-
ings which in Creamoata, Ltd.,
reflected a malady more or less endemic
for several years among Australian flour-
and cereal-millers, was arrested and
reversed last year.
Record turnover-figures, in themselves
no guarantee of higher profits in this
finely-balanced industry, were accom-
panied by wider margins on flour-
products and oatmeals. Sales of offals
and by-products such as bran and pollard
in the form of stock-foods, an indis-
pensable adjunct to the milling economy,
also improved, but these lines were pro-
portionately less profitable, due to rising
ingredient-costs and intensified competi-
tion. The packaged-products and plant-
food divisions continue to come along
well, according to the board.
Like its confreres in the industry,
Creamoata relies upon overseas markets
to maintain production at an economic
volume, and draws about 40 p.c. of its
revenue from this source. Competition in
recent years has tended to he fierce, and
local exporters have had to contend with
near-dumping practices of American,

Canadian and occasionally
French flour-milling interests,
cutting profit-margins rather
fine in the process. The home
demand for flour is relatively
stable, moving somewhat less
than pari passu with the growth
of population.
Australian flour-millers last
year turned out 87,000 short-
tons of flour more than
in the previous year, but the
statistician records that produc-
tion-figures \yere still 63,000 s.t.
below the peak levels of
1,721,000 s.t. reached in both
the 1951-52 and 1952-53 terms.
And 2900 tons less of oatmeal
products were processed last
year, compared with the 1956
output of 18,300 tons; best
year was 1948-49 (23,000 tons).
Nevertheless, Creamoata has
steadily improved its share of
available markets, although the
traditionally less - profitable
home market has tended to
become predominant in recent
years. The unpredictable nature
of the industry is shown by
the following table, in which

The preponderance of home
sales in latter years has put a
severe strain on credit facilities,
but the financial picture is im-
proving rapidly, and £35,485
was added to working-capital in
the course of the year. Bank-
overdraft has been worked-
down by £111,877 to £100,044
since 1955, while stocks have
shown a healthy decrease.
Output of flour-mills in
N.S.W. and Queensland,
where export - permits were
discontinued last year in the
face of a threatened crop-
failure, is expected to be
well below last year’s level,
and Victorian millers should
be kept working at capacity in
consequence; however, the
sharemarket doesn’t display
great enthusiasm for Cream-
oata’s scrip, pricing the stock
at 3s. 6d. a ss. unit, compared
with 2s. 6d. twelve months ago.
Yield is uncertain, but would
be 5.7 p.c. from a repetition of
the 4 p.c. Net tangible assets
backing is 6s. Bd. for each
stock-unit.

r T'HE unpretentious (and un-
informative) annual reports
of this money-spinning Rock-
hampton merchant and agent
don’t disguise the underlying
strength which has carried the
co. through good times and bad
without much inconvenience to
shareholders.
Since the beginning of the
century paid capital has
advanced to £312,000 from
£93,750 with the aid of only
£11,250 in actual cash sub-
scriptions. Average handout
since the inception of Walter
Reid’s public career in 1901
has been over 10 p.c., and in
the last decade 17.3 p.c.
Between 1910 and 1918
reserve-capitalisations came
thick and fast, amounting to
£150,000 ; but thereafter share-
holders had a long wait for
further benefits. A reduction of
capital, was effected in 1945,
when 4s. a share was returned,
reducing paid capital to
£200,000 and the status quo
was restored in February,
1955, when a bonus-issue was
made by writing-up the 16s.

Over the last three years,
dividend has been at the rate of
15 p.c. plus a 3 p.c. bonus, an
intimation that the continuance
of the 18 p.c. is dependent on
seasonal factors. Based on
visible assets, net- tangible back-
ing for the shares seems con-
siderably understated at 745. 4d.
(consolidated accounts), and
the sharemarket hopes that
further capital - movements
cannot be long delayed, pricing
the scrip at 665. to return a

closely bound-up with those
of the grazing and farming
fraternity, and the yearly report
states laconically that “expan-
sion continues, and, helped by
satisfactory prices for wool, the
year’s trading is up to expecta-
tions,” and that “cattle prices
have been remunerative, whilst
running-costs associated with
the pastoral industry continue

Last year the parent's net
profit conveniently edged
forward sufficiently to cover the
unchanged dividend on the

small surplus. This was after
setting aside £18,976 for depre-
ciation (parent’s accounts) on
the lumped-together properties

providing an unstated amount
for taxation. The consolidated
balance-sheet shows a taxation
reserve of £183,066, nearly
three times last year’s visible

explained additions” to reserves
have long been a feature of the

Conditions throughout Queens-
land for the first eight months
of the current term were mixed,
but generally unfavorable, the
dairying industry in particular
being very hard-hit by the
protracted drought, while the
long-term effect on grazing
industries is difficult to gauge.
Whether any repercussions will
be transmitted through Walter
Reid to shareholders remains to
be seen, but the recent interim
doesn’t hint at any change ; and
the co. is not lacking in inner
resources.
Ravensthorpe Copper
'T'HE effects of the “un-
expectedly” large fall in
overseas copper prices on the
fortunes of Ravensthorpe
Copper Mines, N.L., have been
aggravated by the failure to
open-up the Westralian copper-
mine within the time originally
estimated, and, once again, the
co. is faced with a shortage
of liquid funds.
As a result, shareholders
have been asked to put up
another Is. per 10s. share (or
£77,187), to bring the paid-up
value of the scrip to 7s. Calls
each of Is., were made in
February and August of last
year.
Last November, when
forecasting a weekly produc-
tion of 1000 tons of under-
ground ore by December
1957, the directors expressec
the belief that this rate of
output would be sufficient to
ensure an operating - profit
“after meeting the cost of all
necessary development work.”
Since then the “spot” price
of copper on the London
Metal Exchange has dropped
by approximately £l2 10s.
ton; while production would
appear to have fallen below
estimates.
However, new faces of
“good-grade ore,” now being
opened-up, are expected to
provide the quantity of under-
ground ore necessary for pro-
fitable production of concen-
trates.
Representations are being
made with a view to the co.
participating in the local (Aus-
tralian) agreement relating to
copper prices, and, if success-
ful, will result in a substantially
higher return than that now
being received from overseas.
Paid to 6s. and subject to the
Is. call, the scrip was offered
for sale at 6d. last week.
Candid Information
[From L. Owen]
'THE third annual report.
covering the activities of
Interstate Oil, Ltd., for the
year 1957, includes a series of
candid statements about the
petroleum prospects of areas
in which the company has held
an interest but has now given-
up. In fact, the chairman’s
statement might, with advant-
age, be taken as a model by
some of the other organisations
engaged in the search for oil
in Australia.
Not surprisingly, the results
of considerable geological
work carried-out on the Great
Barrier Reef were “not suffi-
ciently encouraging to warrant
the expenditure of the further
large sum required for addi-
tional testing.”
The Queensland portion of
the Carpentaria Basin, in addi-
tion to geological survey, had
its sedimentary column tested
by drilling at Weipa (3243 ft.)
and at Wyaaba (2822 ft.) with-*
out revealing any indications of
the presence of oil or gas, and
has been abandoned and the
option allowed to lapse.
An appraisal of the results
of geological investigations in
the Mount Gambier (S.A.)
district and s.-w. Victoria is
not published, but it is stated
that a renewal of the licence
held in S.A. has not been
sought and that work will be
concentrated in the Victorian
section during 1958.
With reference to the River
Murray Basin, the authorities
to prospect in both the Vic-
torian and the N.S.W. sections
have been surrendered, “as it
is considered that other parts
of Australia offer greater
promise of success.”
Following the completion of
five shallow wells, drilled to
the basal glauconitic sandstone
of the Tertiary in Gippsland,
the right to carry-out “drilling-
operations on portion of the
licence area” has been granted
to Dome Oil and Minerals
Syndicate on condtion that “in
the event of oil or gas being
discovered in payable quanti-
ties Frome Lakes would be
entitled to a 51 p.c. interest in
a company to be formed to
develop the area.”
It is pointed out, however,
that the abandoned areas
“represent only a fraction of
the possible oil-bearing basins
in Australia” and that Frome-
Broken Hill Co. Pty., Ltd. —in
which Interstate holds approxi-
mately one-third of the issued
shares —“has adopted a pro-
gramme for 1958 to continue
the search in Victoria and to
extend it to areas elsewhere in
Australia which, due to
previous commitments, had not
so far been investigated.”
That part of the Australian
public which is interested in
oil prospects —and every Aus-
tralian should be, owing to the
overriding importance of the
discovery of commercial
“pools” of oil to the economy
and strategic safety of the
Commonwealth —may look for-
ward, therefore, to factual
appraisals of these “areas else-
where,” uncolored by hysteria
or unwarranted optimism.

"JACKSUL,” BRISBANE
MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
ON March 11 N.Z.’s Minister
of Finance, Mr. Nord-
meyer, speaking at a dinner
given by the Auckland branch
of the Society of Accountants,
said that N.Z. was “in for a
period of recession.”
The next day the chairman of
the Southland Frozen Meat and
Produce Export Co., Ltd., Mr.
J. Gilkison, said: “I’m afraid
it’s a slump, not a recession.”
The immediate effect was to
drain a good deal of strength
out of the sharemarket. As
increasing numbers of sellers
appeared, buyers became un-
certain, coy and hard to please
and in many cases limits were
pared-down.
In the week following Mr.
Nordmeyer’s statement price-
falls outnumbered rises by
four to one. Many shares lost
all their gains of the last few
months.
It was the sharpest and most
widespread reverse suffered by
the N.Z. sharemarket for a
long time.
The break was not un
expected by those close to the
market. There had been plenty
of warnings that some down-
ward adjustment of the general
level of share prices was likely.
Since the change of Govern-
ment at the end of last year
many investors had seemed to
allow the idea of possible gains
from the operation of import-
control to obscure their view of
the rather sombre economic
background.
Controls and Share Prices
The help which import-
control might give to some
manufacturers attracted dis-
proportionately more attention
than the handicap which it
might impose on some other
businesses ; and the possibility
of upward pressure on share
prices as. a result of inflationary
aspects of Labor’s policy was
given more weight than the
possibility of downwarc
pressure arising later from in
creased controls and, probably
taxation.
Share prices reached a peak
in mid-February. Increasin
public discussion of unfavorabl
economic factors brought th
first signs of a change at the end
of the month, when the weekl
ratio of price-rises to price
falls, which had been runnin
at about three-to-one, fell ol
sharply to one-to-one.
There was thus an under
current of uneasiness, and Mr
Nordmeyer’s statement tippec
the scales.
If the prevailing marke
sentiment in the last few month
has been unduly optimistic
there is no good reason why i;
should now swing to the
opposite extreme.
“Evil Magic”
Investors would be unwise
to allow themselves to be
stampeded by the evil magic o:
slump talk.
Mr. Nordmeyer made it
plain that, when he paic
“recession,” he meant just tha
—not “depression.” He addec
that the country was sound in
heart and had a bright future.
There is no evidence to support
any suggestion that the facts are
otherwise.
The genuine investor, hold-
ing shares in sound companies,
has no need to worry about
some readjustment of market-
values. He will participate in
the growth which an annual
population-expansion of 2.3
per cent, is certain to bring.
Bank-rate and Wool
The lowering of the British
Bank-rate appeared to be
responsible for a significant and
cheering recovery in wool
prices at the Auckland sales.
The chairman of the N.Z.
Wool Commission said recently
that total wool receipts for the
current. season could be £22-
million less than last season.
He pointed-out, however, that
if, as estimated, the average
wool price this season -is 20y
per cent, below that for 1956-
57, it will still be only 6 per
cent below that for 1955-56 —
a more appropriate comparison,
as last season’s price was un-
expectedly and exceptionally
high. ;
In his talk to accountants,
Mr. Nordmeyer said that there
was no immediate prospect of
an improvement in overseas
funds which would justify the
opening of the door to a freer
flow of imports.
The drop in export prices, he
added, would mean problems
for the Government in other
directions. Farmers and some
traders would pay tax on a
lower income this year than
last, and the amount that the
Government received in
Customs duty and sales-tax
would inevitably diminish. This
was unfortunate because
Government expenditure this
year would have to be increased
in some directions.
The inference is plain:
Higher taxes!
Dumped Butter
In an appeal to British trade-
unionists to support N.Z.’s%
protest against the dumping of
dairy produce in the U.K., the
president of the N.Z. Federa-
tion of Labor, Mr. F. P. Walsh
said: “This is the most menac
ing economic crisis in N.Z
since the depression of th
early ’thirties.”
He recalled that in 1947 N.Z
made a gift of £l2|-million
cash together with £l-million
worth of food to the U.K
Government to help it out of
its balance-of-payments diffi
culties and that, throughout the
war, N.Z. sold its produce to
the U.K. at prices considerably
lower than those paid to othei
countries.
If the appeal to the U.K
Board of Trade fails, the
guaranteed price for dairy
produce may have to be
reduced by more than the
per cent, a year authorised by
law at present.
There have been indications
recently that dairy-industry
leaders may be resigned to that
prospect—provided the reduc-
tion is made as part of an over-
all national readjustment.
But any attempt to reduce
wages is certain to meet with
strenuous and bitter opposition.
In the past wages have lagged
behind rising costs, and it may
be claimed, with some reason,
that they should lag behind fall-
ing prices, at least for a time.
A little more work is the
obvious and sensible prescrip-
tion for N.Z.’s ills. Mr. Walsh,
of the Federation of Labor,
has suggested to the Industrial
Advisory Council that all mid-
week racing and sporting events
should be banned.
“I think we would be better
off as a nation doing a little
more work rather than going to
the races during the week,” he
said, with some truth.
Cool Reception
The proposal has, under-
standably, had a cool recep-
tion from sporting organisa-
tions. A Rugby spokesman
said it would sound the death-
knell of most sports. No over-
seas team could visit N.Z. on
a one-match-a-week basis. The
president of the Racing Con-
ference: “I think the less said
the better at the moment.”
The fact remains that N.Z.
must choose between producing
more or taking a cut in its
standard of living.
Most thoughtful persons will
agree with the general secretary
of Federated Farmers, Mr. A.
P. O’Shea, who said recently:
“If we want more goods we
will have to put in more effort,
and the best way would be by
the proper acceptance of the
shift system. It should be
possible to work the 40-hour
week over the whole seven days
without penal rates for Satur-
day and Sunday.”
Mr. O’Shea emphasised that
expansion of enterprise requir-
ing extra capital for new plant
should not be encouraged. The
Government should use its
machinery to weed-out those
industries which add little or
nothing to the national wealth
or which may even be a drain
on it. The aim should be to
increase production with exist-
ing facilities.


CONSCIENCE
By R. S. PORTEOUS
ON the seaward side of
island the great
breakers pounded over
the reef, expending
their relentless force in clouds
of misty spray that drifted high
up the wooded slopes of Mount
Moahua to scorch and wither
the most exposed leaves so that
trees and shrubs assumed an
attitude of defeat, leaning
tiredly away from the persis-
tent trade-winds. “What’s the
use of battling against it all?”
the deformed limbs seemed to
say.
There was a greyness in the
lifting rollers, a hint of rest-
lessness as if the sea, tiring of
weeks of blue serenity, were
working itself into a mood that
would batter the life out of
some of this ever-encroaching
coral and hurl it far up the
beach. Perhaps, if the mood
developed, it might even add the
bleached bones of some care-
less mariner and his ship to the
heaps of glistening white coral-
fragments marking the limits of
high-water.
But around in the anchorage,
tucked securely under Moahua’s
protective lee and guarded by
the embracing arms of coral
reefs, the blue-green waters lay
calm and untroubled.
Occasional catspaws of wind
riffled across the smooth sur-
face, but they had no power to
disturb the depths. The fronds
of the coconut-palms along the
foreshore rattled gently in the
breeze and only an occasional
cloud broke the wide expanse
of blue sky.
There was an atmosphere of
peace and security here. You
could sense it in the way the
launch lying alongside the
flimsy little jetty rubbed her-
self contentedly against the
piles, feel it in the laughing
chatter of the natives lining
the jetty to say their farewells
to relatives and friends already
cluttering the deck of the
launch.
Nothing to worry about here,
<4hose laughing brown faces
said. In good time the Barinda
would cast-off and carry them
and their household-goods to
their various destinations. She
might sail at nine-o’clock, her
scheduled time of departure,
or she might not start to warm-
up her diesels until noon. It
all depended on the whim of
her owner-skipper.
Lofty Logan might pull out,
leaving some fat old mother
panting and wailing along the
path from the village while
her crate of fowls and her
prized pig sailed without her, or
he might dally in the village
until his engineer came to tell
him the last passenger and the
last bit of cargo had been
aboard for two hours.
This morning it looked as if
she would sail on time, for at
ten minutes to nine the stutter-
ing roar of her diesels coming
to life temporarily drowned the
chatter of her passengers.
STANDING alone in the
shade of a coconut-palm
Captain Angus Fergusson found
himself unable to share the
general happy-go-lucky air.
Instead of feeling lighthearted
he was feeling disturbed,
worried and even a little
annoyed with himself. In fact
his conscience was troubling
him. He watched the Barinda
pull out from the jetty, the
noise of her engines now
drowned by the high-pitched
screams of farewell, and his
shaggy eyebrows came down in
a scowl of disapproval.
He had recognised the tall,
scantily - clad figure in the
Barinda’s wheelhouse and he
was fairly sure Lofty Logan
had recognised him. Slowly,
heavily, he made his way along
the beach to his. brother's
bungalow.
“That launch, Barinda,” he
said over his morning drink ;
“how long has she been in these
waters, Alec?”
“A couple of years. Might
be a bit longer. Time slips by
in these islands.” Alec Fergus-
son smiled. “I know her
skipper, Lofty Logan, has be-
come quite a notoriety. You
should hear some of the stories
they tell about him and his wild
doings.”
Walking to the edge of the
veranda and knocking the ashes
from his pipe Captain Fergus-
son said, “Lofty Logan used to
be quite a character in another
place. I could tell you a few
stories about him. Keep you
entertained all night if I got
started on the subject. A first-
class seaman, but feckless and
reckless. Afraid of nothing.
Even the angry parents of some
of his girls couldn’t scare him,
and Lord knows there were
enough of ’em.” He rammed
a fresh load of tobacco into his
pipe. “Do you happen to
know where his launch is
registered now, or when she
was last surveyed?”
“No idea. From all I hear
of Lofty I’d be surprised if
he’d bothered to register her
anywhere.”
“What d’ye mean, man?”
The tone was incredulous. “If
the man’s plying for hire he’s
bound by law to register his
vessel and have her surveyed.”
Watching his younger brother
Alec Fergusson thought how
alike the two of them were —
grey-haired, heavily-built men
with angular features lined by
age and weather. A casual
acquaintance might mistake
them for twins, though Angus
was nearly four years his
junior. Perhaps his habit of
worrying unnecessarily had
aged him. The poor fool was
obviously worrying now over


something that didn’t concern
him.
“Look, Angus,” he said,
“what does it matter to you
whether he’s registered or not?
You’re retired now, Harbor-
master of Nowhere. And in
any case your territory never
extended to these islands.
You’ve come here to rest and
watch me grow coconuts.
Forget Logan. He may be a
hard case, but he’s popular
with the natives and he’s giving
them a good launch-service.”
Captain Fergusson muttered,
“Until he drowns ’em!” and
stumped out.
nrWO days later, returning
from the island store, Alec
asked, “Did you listen to the
midday news, Angus?”
“No. Clean forgot to switch
the wireless on.” Angus grinned
a little sheepishly. “As a matter
of fact I dozed off. Anything
special?”
“The Barinda’s missing.”
“What?” The statement
brought Angus out of his low
canvas chair in one surprisingly
agile movement.
“Missing. Overdue, they
called it. She left here for
Atahiki Island on Wednesday
morning and hasn’t been heard
of since. Even allowing for
the fairly heavy head-sea that
was running she should have
made Atahiki before dark.
They’ve had a plane out search-
ing for her today. The Admini-
stration - launch has been
ordered to join in the search
now. She’s due in here this
afternoon.”
His hands clasped behind his
back, Captain Angus Fergus-
son paced moodily up and
down the veranda before ask-
ing, “Who would be aboard
this Administration launch?”
“Her coxswain and two
native crew-members. And if
there was one available I should
think they’d have a patrol-
officer with them. Technically
he’d be in charge.”
“Do you think they’d give
me a passage?”
“I imagine they’d be only too
pleased to have you. But why
should you go careering off
on a trip like that?' They may
be away for days and it’ll be
damnably cramped and uncom-
fortable, to say the least of it,
Angus. You’re just sticking
your nose into something that’s
no concern of yours.”
“It’s just this much my con-
cern,” Angus stated, solemnly:
“If the Barinda has foundered
with any loss of life I’m guilty
of murder.”
Ignoring his brother’s ques-
tions he walked off to the
beach.
The Administration launch
came in that afternoon and, as
Alec had predicted, she had a
patrol-officer on board. A keen,
energetic young Queenslander,
he welcomed Captain Fergusson
with enthusiasm. He was a
lanky youngster, so tall that in
spite of hunching his shoulders
he kept bumping his fair head
on the deck beams of the
cramped launch-cabin. His
nose was red from constant sun-
burn and his eager blue eyes
showed a touch of diffidence or
shyness. Obviously he was new
to the job.
“Gee, Captain,” he said, his
pleasure showing in his engag-
ing grin, “that’ll be beaut, if
you can spare the time. Tom
Hopkins, the coxswain, doesn’t
know these waters very well.
He’s off. his regular beat here,
and I’m afraid I’m not much of
a seaman. In fact, I —er —
well, to be quite honest, I get
seasick as soon as it gets
rough.”
He straightened-up, bumped
his head and reeled back from
the impact. “Damn those
beams! I’m always doing that.
Got great lumps all over my
skull.” He ran his fingers
through his fair hair and
extended the other hand shyly.
“My name’s Jones. Rodney
Jones.”
“I’m pleased to meet you,
Rod.” Captain Fergusson
grasped the hand warmly. “I’m
sure we’ll be able to help each
other. I take it you’ve got
charts aboard so if you supply
all the local information I’ll do
the navigating. We’ll leave for
Atahiki first thing in the morn-
ing, eh?”
“Yes, I thought of shoving-
off at daybreak.” Rodney
spread a chart on the cabin-
table and studied it rather
vaguely. “What do you think
happened to the Barinda,
Captain?”
“That’s a difficult question,
Rod. I’m told that the day she
left the wind shifted from sou’-
east to south, blowing at about
forty miles an hour. That
would kick up a nasty cross-
sea.”
“Enough to sink a big launch
like the Barinda?”’
“Definitely not if she was
well found and capably
handled. I’m sure she was
capably handled, but I have
good reason to suspect she was
not as well found as she should
have been.”
Abruptly Captain Fergusson
changed the subject.
They didn’t sail for Atahiki
next morning. As they were
preparing to turn-in they picked
up a news-broadcast that set
every tongue in the Islands
wagging and made headlines
in every newspaper in the
Pacific.
A SMALL steamer, the S.S.
Torburn, had sighted and
boarded the Barinda twenty
miles north of Muji Atoll.
Although she had two-feet of
water in her engine-room she
appeared to be undamaged
and was not making any more
water.
There was not a soul on
board, nor was there anything
to explain why or how her
people had abandoned her. Her
dinghy was still securely lashed
to her deck. The Torburn had
made a short search of the
vicinity and was now towing
the Barinda to port.
“Twenty miles north of Muji
Atoll! ” Rodney exclaimed
incredulously. “But that’s more
than fifty miles off her course
from here to Atahiki! Why,
it’s north of here, and the
Barinda was heading south-
east. How could she possibly
get up there?”
“That’s one of the first things
we’ve got to find out, but since
my pet theory has been proved
wrong I hesitate to form
another.”
The coxswain joined in the
discussion then, and during the
next hour they had theories
aplenty. Rodney leant strongly
towards Russian submarines.
There had been several reported
sightings of mystery subs
recently, he pointed out. None
of them had been satisfactorily
explained by the authorities
although they admitted the
subs were not ours or
America’s.
“Strange subs snooping
around like that couldn’t be up
to any good,” he reasoned.
“They could board a launch
like the Barinda, take off her
passengers and crew, and scuttle
her.”
“But they didn’t scuttle her,”
Captain Fergusson pointed out.
“She’s still afloat.”
The coxswain favored some
monster of the deep—giant
octopi or sea-serpents.
“There’s more things down
there than any of us knows
about,” he hinted darkly. He
was a wizened little man,
quietly capable of handling his
launch and his two native crew-
members, but obviously
intensely superstitious. “Look
at the Marie Celeste. None of
the shrewd ’eads ever explained
wot took them people. And
there Wasn’t no Russian sub-
marines sneakin’ about in them
days.”
Excitedly Rodney exclaimed,
“He’s right there, Captain.
Scientists say there are
enormous octopi in the depths.
What if hunger or something
drove them to the surface?”
The coxswain nodded
gloomily. “A mate o’ mine as
was bosun in foreign-goin’
ships told me a few tales. Told
me one about findin’ a big
junk abandoned in the China
Sea. A flat calm it was, and
when they boarded ’er there
was dishes of fresh-cooked rice
all set out as if the crew was
just sitting down to a meal, but
there wasn’t a soul on board.
There was a smell —every man
in the boardin’-party noticed it
—like somethin’ ’orrible drug
up from the bottom of the sea.”
“Beche - de - mer or some
other savory Chinese dish?”
Captain Fergusson suggested.
“No, there was big trails of
slime on the deck and the
second-mate in charge of the
boardin’-party pointed out that
the smell was cornin’ from
them. He asked for volunteers
to ’elp ’im take the junk in to
Hong Kong, but no one would
’ave it on. They couldn’t get
off that there junk quick
enough.”
“Bloodcurdling! ” Captain
Fergusson turned away to hide
the twinkle in his eyes. “And
now I think we should turn-in.
We’ve got to get an early start
in the morning, but it’s obvious
-we’ll have to change our plans
and search for survivors in the
vicinity of Muji Atoll.”
For a long time he lay awake,
racking his brains for the
answers to several questions.
Why had passengers and crew
abandoned a vessel that was
not sinking? And how, since
the dinghy was still lashed to
the deck, had they abandoned
her? Then there was the matter
of the water in her. Why had
she flooded to a depth of two-
feet and then stopped taking
in water?
There was not a sensible,
seamanlike answer to any of
the questions.
VyHEN Lofty Logan cleared
TT the shelter of Kimarau
anchorage he was not feeling
his usual cheerful self. From
here to Atahiki his course was
east-south-east, almost straight
into wind and sea. The sea
could not be called dangerous ;
it was steep and uncomfortable,
but he’d pushed the Barinda
into worse many a time.
Yet today it worried him. He
had recognised the solitary
figure under the palm-tree and
the recognition made him feel
guilty and uncomfortable.
Probably for the first time in
his carefree life Lofty’s con-
science was troubling him. He
had come to these islands to
escape this man, and now it


looked as though his past had
caught up with him.
' Very feelingly he growled,
“Curse the bloody old vulture!
What the hell’s he doin’ so far
off his beat?”
Tony, his half-caste engineer,
looked at him in surprise.
“Who’s that one, Lofty?”
“Nothin’ to do with you,”
Lofty told him irritably. “You
get below and make sure them
engines is runnin’ right. We’ll
be punchin’ this sea all the way
across and we don’t want no
sick engines slowin’ us down or
we won’t get there till mid-
night.”
Alone in the wheelhouse he
let his thoughts drift back to his
dealings with Captain Fergus-
son. The old bloke, he admitted
grudgingly, had been anything
but a vulture. As harbor-
master of that North Queens-
land port he had been fair and
even generous in his official
attitude to the launch-owners
who came under his control.
His annual surveys were
thorough, he overlooked no
defect, yet he was always willing
to compromise with a hard-up
owner provided the launch was
made seaworthy.
“You’re in for some heavy
expense, Lofty,” he had said
when he made his last survey
of the Barinda. “Some of the
planking up for’ard will have
to be renewed and when you
get it off I want to have a look
at the stempost. I’ve an idea
the rot has got into it.”
The announcement rocked
Lofty to the calloused soles of
his big bare feet. Fitting a new
stempost was a job for the
port’s only shipwright, a hard
man who had already
threatened to sue him for the
cost of the last job he had done
on the Barinda.
“You don’t reckon she’d go
another year, Captain?” Lofty
had suggested. “I’m a bit
pushed for the ready just now,
but I got a coupla good jobs
cornin’ off that’ll put me in
the big money next year.”
A faint smile had softened
Captain Fergusson’s face.
Lofty was always broke,
always counting on some job
to put him in the big money.
Strangely enough the jobs
usually materialised, but the
money was spent before the ink
was dry on the cheques. A
feckless scoundrel, was the way
Captain Fergusson described
Lofty. Nevertheless he
admitted he was fond of him
and that he was the best
seaman on the coast.
In the end he had agreed
that certain temporary repairs
would make the Barinda sea-
worthy for another twelve
months. Signing the certificate
of seaworthiness he had
repeated, “Twelve months,
Lofty. And remember, that
stempost comes out next year
or' your Barinda will be tied-
up. Better give the girls a rest
and start saving.”
Two months later Lofty
dropped anchor in Kimarau.
If he played his cards right,
he told himself, he could open
up a nice little inter-island
business here, and unless he
went looking for publicity the
authorities wouldn’t worry him.
As soon as he goti a bit of
capital together he’d give the
Barinda a general overhaul,
new stempost and all.
As he peered ahead, search-
ing for the faint mass of
Atahiki, he grinned ruefully.
Nearly two and a half years in
the islands and the overhaul
was still only a promise. Hell,
why worry about it now? He’d
get it done straight after
Christmas for sure.
But as the morning dragged
on he found it increasingly
difficult to remain unworried.
The Barinda was pounding
heavily, deluging herself from
stem to stern as she flung her
bows high in the air, rattling
the wheelhouse-windows each
time she crashed them down
into the troughs. Glancing
over the side Lofty doubted if
she was making five knots.
Automatically he checked the
discharge from the bilge-
pump. That was important.
The -old Barinda didn’t make
much water when she was lying
at anchor, but in a heavy head-
sea it seeped in so fast that the
bilge-pump seldom sucked dry.
Lofty would
have handed the wheel
over to Tony and turned in,
untroubled by the pounding.
He could sleep through any-
thing, and his happy-go-lucky
nature allowed him to dismiss
the laboring of his ship as
something inevitable as
inevitable as the misery of the
passengers huddled aft in a
wet, seasick mass. Ultimately
the Barinda would battle her
way to the shelter of an
anchorage where the
passengers would dry them-
selves out and recover.
But today he found himself
unable to leave the wheelhouse.
Each Heavy crash of the bows
brought up the picture of
Captain Fergusson standing
under the palm-tree. “That
certificate was for twelve
months, Lofty,” he seemed to
be accusing. “And it was for
restricted waters. It didn’t
cover you here even when it
was valid.”
Shrugging his bare shoulders
impatiently, Lofty growled,
“Aw, what the hell’s it got to
do with him, anyway?”
“Talkin’ to me or talkin’ to
y’rself again?” Tony had
come up from the engine-
room and was standing behind
him.
“Shut-up,” Lofty snapped.
“What’s eatin’ y’, Lofty?”
Tony persisted. “Why don’t
y’ get y’r ’ead down for a
hour or two? I’ll take ’er
along. I’ve took ’er through
worse seas than this.”
“Get this into y’r thick black
skull” —Lofty’s irritation was
becoming increasingly obvious
—“when I want y’ to take ’er
I’ll tell y’.”
Tony wedged himself into a
corner of the wheelhouse,
rolled a cigarette and lit it.
For a few minutes he smoked
nervously, sensing his skipper’s
worry, even sensing that it was
in some way connected with
the safety of the ship. Yet the
Barinda seemed to be behaving
•normally. Chucking herself
about a bit, but, then, she
always did when she was
punching into a head-sea. Stood
to reason, didn’t it? A ship
had to go either over them or
under them, and the Barinda,
like any sensible ship, preferred
to go over them. A wonder
Lofty didn’t wake-up to him-
self.. One thing, he couldn’t
go crook about the engines;
they were running perfectly.
Still, since he wasn’t wanted
here, he might as well go down
and check things over. He
tossed his cigarette-end into the
sea and went below.
Ten seconds later, his eyes
protruding like gleaming
billiard-balls, he was grasping
Lofty’s shoulder and yelling,
“Lofty, she’s sinkin’! The
water’s up over the engine-
room floor!”
Lofty smashed the clutching
hand aside, snarled, “Take the
wheel,” and leaned out over
the rail. When one glance
confirmed the fact that the
bilge-pump was working to full
capacity he dived below.
For once Tony had not
exaggerated. The water slosh-
ing to and fro over the floor-
boards would have been ankle-
deep if it had remained
stationary.
Lofty wasted no time search-
ing for the leak. He knew
where the water was coming
in. Right up for’ard, in the
chain-locker, the heavy pound-
ing was at last springing the
planks, tearing away their
grip on the rotting stempost.
That bloody harbormaster had
put a jinx on him! God, a few
mqre crashes and the planks
might spring wide apart, open-
ing up a gap that would let
the whole ocean come pouring
in.
“Hard a’starb’d,” he yelled,
hurling himself into the wheel-
house. “Head her back for
Kimarau.”
No time for the niceties of
seamanship, such as waiting for
a lull before easing her around.
One more head-on crash could
be the end of her.. Atahiki, he
noted, was showing up clearly
ahead, much more clearly than
the faint loom of Kimarau
astern. They were, as the air-
men used to say, beyond the
point of no return. Yet their
only hope was to turn and
run, point the damaged bows
away from the battering of the
seas and hope the old girl
would stay afloat until they
reached shelter. Moreover,
they would make better time
running with wind and sea
behind them.
“Gimme the wheel,” he
ordered, thrusting Tony aside.
“Dig up buckets, saucepans,

When An Ageing Electorate Begins to Grow Young
Reversal of a Trend
POLITICIANS are never backward
in claiming for their own party
credit for the introduction of social
reforms, though they often have to
use a very elastic yardstick .to justify
some of their claims. The simple argu-
ment that such-and-such a measure was
placed on the statute-books by the Bloggs
Government is regarded by members of
the Bloggs party as full and satisfactory
proof that their party alone deserves the
credit for it. The Maggs party, however,
may hold very different views, maintain-
ing its right to be regarded as the real
originator of the reform on the grounds
that, but for its constant needling of the
Bloggsites, that party would never have
done anything about it. Moreover, what
is good for the Bloggses is also good
enough for the Maggses, so the Maggs
party naturally claims full credit for its
own legislation and the Bloggs party just
as naturally claims to have done the
pioneering and agitating that finally
stirred the Maggses into action.
Who Started It?
TN Australia the pattern is no different
from anywhere else. Federal old-age
pensions, for example, are claimed by
both ‘ sides. The Liberals can, and do,
point out that it was a Liberal Prime
Minister, Alfred Deakin, who legislated
for old-age pensions in 1908, but Labor
men are able to reply that the Deakin
Government was a minority Government,
kept in office by the goodwill of Labor ;
they argue that the pensions-bill was the
pay-off for Labor support.
But the issue is by no means as simple
as that. There were State old-age pen-
sions before the Deakin ten-bob. Victoria
was first in the field, the Turner Govern-
ment’s pension scheme coming into opera-
tion in January, 1901. New South Wales
(under Premier See) followed suit seven
months later, and the Kidston Govern-
ment in Queensland instituted a pensions
plan in 1908, just in time to be super-
seded by the Federal scheme. None of
the three State Governments responsible
for the reform was Labor —though pos-
sibly the Maggs-Bloggs principle was at
work.
A similar conflict, though not quite so
confused, occurs in the case of child-
endowment. This was introduced as a
Federal measure by the Menzies Govern-
ment in 1941, but it had already been in
existence for some years in N.S.W.,
having been initiated by the Lang Labor
Government.
An outsider with a detached view of
things might come to the conclusion that
no political party is really responsible
for any reform, but that the one that
introduces a new measure has merely had
its head close to the ground and has
realised, ahead of its opponents, that the
electorate is ready for the change.
There’s a lot to be said for the argu-
ment. Most ideas have been tossed around
for a long time before a political party
decides they are safe enough to risk its
future on. The influence of dominant
individuals and parties is important in
Shaping the ideas and giving them an
articulate voice’ but in the long-run a
democracy not only gets the sort of Gov-
ernment it wants; it also gets the sort of
laws it wants.
Public Opinion
npHIS applies more so since the
coming of universal adult-suffrage,
but the great reforms of the early part of
the nineteenth-century —the abolition of
the slave-trade ; the first Factory Acts ;
the ending of child-labor in mines ; the
beginning of State education —although
due in great part to the zeal of devoted
individuals, would never have come about
without the support of public opinion.
And if the character of the electorate
determines a community’s laws it follows
that changes in the character and com-
position of the electorate must be reflected
in its political outlook, its Parliament,
and ultimately in its laws.
For many years sociologists have been
talking of the ageing population of the
Western world due to the effect of a
declining birthrate on the one hand and
a falling deathrate on the other. There
has been considerable speculation on the
possible effect of this trend on the
economy—and fears that the stage might
be approaching when a seemingly ever-
growing pension- and social-service struc-
ture would prove too heavy a burden
for the wage-earning sector of the com-
munity, which would be growing propor-
tionately smaller every year.
Dr. Frank G. Dickinson, director of
economic research for the American
Medical Association, who spent several
months in this part of the world last year,
has made a close study of age-trends and
has arrived at two very interesting con-
clusions. In effect he says that the
problem posed by an ageing electorate is
not merely a by-product of the changing
age-structure ; it is the direct result of
the conscious striving of the electorate
for security. An electorate composed
largely of young people is not concerned
with the problems of old-age—these are
too remote from its own concerns. But
to an ageing electorate such problems
have a personal application.
A Younging Electorate
TVICKINSON claims that “during the
past half-century there is much
evidence that the influence of older voters
on legislation has been greater than their
number merited, because the proportion
was rising.” Because of this rising trend
politicians took more notice of their
problems. He considers that the ageing
population has been one of the prin-
cipal forces behind the move towards
the Welfare State, apparent in Australia,
New Zealand, Britain, America and most
Western countries in the past 25 years,
and particularly since the war.
While in Australia Dickinson inter-
viewed politicians of all parties. Most
were surprised at the figures he quoted
to show the extent of the ageing, but they
were in general agreement as to its effect
on social legislation. What they found
hard to believe was his claim that since
1910 there had been a shift of close on
15 votes in a hundred from the younger
(under 50) to the older group. Dickinson
insists, however, that by 1961 the peak-
percentage of older voters will have been
reached and that it will prove to be 15
per cent, higher than in 1910.
This brings us to his second conclu-
sion: that from that year onwards Aus-
tralia will have a “younging” electorate
—the first country to show a reversal of
the ageing trend, though he expects New
Zealand (1962), Fr&nce (1965), America
(1970) and the United Kingdom (after
1978). to show the same tendency. The
reason for this is that the deathrate has
become more-or-less static, but the birth-
rate from the early war-years onward
has shown a remarkable recovery. The
result of this younging of the population
has already been felt in the primary and
secondary schoQls; its impact on the
electorate Will begin to be felt .in the
1960’5, at first gradually, but with steadily
increasing weight.
A younging electorate, Dr. Dickinson
considers, will “put a brake on the trend
towards the Welfare State and lessen the
-clamor for the guaranteed future, the
riskless society.” It will be more con-
cerned with its immediate problems—
adequate housing and education for its
children —and with present progress
rather than future security. If the doctor
is right, then those politicians who base
their policy on the assumption that the
electors rate security above everything
else will have to put their ears to the
ground and listen again.

The A.J.C. will distribute
upwards of £62,000 in prize-
money during the four days of
its autumn carnival, which will
open next Saturday. Main
attractions on the first day will
be the £6OOO Doncaster Handi-
cap, one mile, the £5OOO Sires’
Produce Stakes, 7 furlongs, the
£3OOO St. Leger, 1| mile, and
the £2500 Autumn Stakes, I{-
rnile (w.f.a.). The £12,500
Sydney Cup, two miles, will be
run next Monday.
SELECTIONS Doncaster
Handicap: GRENOBLE, 1 ;
SQUANDER LAD, 2;
TERANYAN, 3. Sydney Cup:
STRAIGHT DRAW, 1 ;
MARKSMAN, 2r; PUSH-
OVER, 3.
It is nine years since a
favorite won the Doncaster
Handicap. The last was Bern-
brook (4 to 1) in 1949. During
the past 27 years the only
winning favorites, apart from
Bernbrook, were Kingsdale
(6’s), in 1943, Gold Rod (4’s),
1939, Hall Mark (9/2), 1935,
and Winooka (3’s), in 1933.
The Sydney Cup also has
tricked takers of the odds, as
over the period named there
were five winning favorites
only.
The autumn of 1957 will be
remembered for the easy
defeat of 6-to-l-on Todman
in the A.J.C. Sires’ Produce
Stakes. Tulloch, who has
since risen to be Australia’s
champion, won that classic at
6 to 1, with Prince Darius
third. Both the winner and
the third-placegetter have since
figured regularly in. the head-
lines. Tulloch is expected to
add next Saturday’s St. Leger
to his imposing list of wins.
Short-priced winners of the
Sires’ Produce in recent
seasons were: Gay Sierra (10
to 9 on), Kingster (3’s), Lind-
bergh (7 to 2), Pure Fire (5 to
4), Ocean Bound (5 to 2), True
Course (5 to 2), Field Boy (11
to 4), Riptide (3’s), and
Temeraire (2’s on). Most of
these didn’t start favorite.
Next Saturday’s race for the
best two-year-olds should be
keenly contested, with Sky-
line, Bold Pilot, Man-of-Iron
and Melbourne’s Nilento
likely to share the big end
of the stakemoney. Skyline
could prove the winner.
The St. Leger looks like
proving an easy task for Tul-
loch, whose jockey, George
Moore, previously won the
classic on Sea Sovereign and
on Playboy (both trained by
Tulloch’s mentor, T. J. Smith).
Darby Munro, now enjoying
a run of success as a trainer,
won five St. Legers as a
jockey. They were on Read-
ing, Mayfowl, Vigaro, Aristo-
crat, and Hydrogen. Jim Pike,
now assisting Jack Green with
his team, had three wins in
the classic Phar Lap,
Strephon and Peter Pan —but
Maurice McCarten topped all
latter-day horsemen With six
winners—Lucrative, Mosaic,
John Wilkes (dead-heat), Gold
Rod, Veilmond and Limerick.
Tom Hales had seven wins in
the St. Leger in the 'Bo’s.
Most racegoers left War-
wick Farm with their minds
made up that the Doncaster
Handicap and the Sydney
Cup would be won by the
popular pair, Grenoble and
Straight Draw. Grenoble won
the Liverpool Handicap with
8.12, or 71b. above his Don-
caster weight, while Straight
Draw made a gallant effort to
win the mile - and -a- half
Autumn Handicap with 9.7, or
81b. above his Cup impost.
Grenoble’s win was most
convincing and it seems diffi-
cult for any Doncaster aspirant
who followed him home at
the Farm to reverse the posi-
tions on Saturday. Trainer
Frank Lewis hopes to win
his first important event with
Grenoble, who is at peak
form, and on latest perform-
ances is the logical selection
for the mile. Chief dangers
should be Squander Lad, who
didn’t race at the Farm,
Teranyan, who finished second
last Saturday, and Commedia.
Theodric and Troy seem
lightweight hopes.
Fire Flash beat Straight
Draw in the Autumn Handi-
cap by a nose, with Marks-
man, a neck away, third. All
three .figure among the fan-
cied Sydney Cup horses, with
Straight Draw a warm
favorite. Looked at from any
angle, the Melbourne Cup
winner appears to have next
Monday’s two-miler in the
bag. Fire Flash carried 8.7,
or 21b. above his Sydney Cup
weight, but he’s doubtful at
16 furlongs. Marksman’s 7.4
at the Farm represented 41b.
above his handicap weight, to
enable G. Podmore to take
the mount. Podmore is
expected to be on that pro-
mising young stayer in the
Cup, and, as at Warwick
Farm, will ride him at about
7.4, or four over the Cup
impost. He looks a show in
view of the moderate-class
field, bar Straight Draw, and,
perhaps, Melbourne stayer
Pushover, who finished fifth
to Fire Flash after being at
the tail of the field in the early
part of the race. She drops
from 9.3 to 8.9, which is a
concession not to be regarded
slightly. Marksman has a
staying background which will
help his Cup chance.
Winner of 10 races to date,
three-year-old filly Gay Satin
is the best of the progeny of
the imported sire Rock and
Rye. She could be . another
Evening Peal. She didn’t win
her first race —a Hawkesbury
Maiden —until last October,
and has now won 10 races in
about five months. Her few
opponents in the A.J.C.’s £4OOO
Adrian Knox Stakes, \\ mile,
on the final day of the autumn
fixture have the job ahead to
lower her colors. Gay Satin,
in training at Rosebery, some-
times looks too tired to get out
of her own way. But when
trainer Sid Nicholls sets her to
gallop fast she puts on a turn
that doesn’t suffer by com-
parison with the best workers
at that course —and they include
Grenoble, Teranyan, New
Spec, Gay Port, and other
brilliant gallopers. In her latest
success Gay Satin beat Golden-
way by a head, after conceding
her a start from the top of the
straight in the Sappho Stakes.
She has won from six to 10
furlongs, both in Sydney and
in Melbourne.
Man-of-Iron’s nose defeat by
New Gem in the Second Fair-
field Handicap prevented owner
Bob Carter and Randwick
trainer, Harry Plant, from land-
ing a double at Warwick Farm.
Ginger Nell won the First Fair-
field rather impressively, and
Man-of-Iron just failed to
catch New Gem, on whom A.
Mulley appeared to ride a
casual finish ; he later told the
stewards his mount lugged out
in the straight. It was New
Gem’s third successive win and
more seem on the way. Earlier
in the season Ginger Nell won
a Randwick sprint by six
lengths. Her sire Bold Buc-
caneer (imp.) has made a good
start, as other winners in this,
his first season, include Bold
Pilot, Sea Hound, and Bris-
bane’s Tobermory Bay. He is
well represente3 at the coming
Randwick yearling • sales.
Ginger Nell cost 2000gns. as a
yearling. On the dam’s side she
is related to Never Say Die, an
English Derby and St. Leger
winner.

It was unusual to see
Tulloch making all the running
in the Chipping Norton Stakes
at Warwick Farm, but
champions can adapt them-
selves to any form of racing.
Tulloch had one of the easiest
wins of his career, which
embraces 26 starts for 18 firsts,
seven seconds and one third —
a remarkably fine record. He
has won £57,948 in stakes.'
Present plans are for Tulloch
to start in the A.JjC. St. Leger
next Saturday and the Queen
Elizabeth Stakes a week later,
then enjoy his winter rest
before returning to training
for spring racing. Redcrqze
heads the list of winners in
Australia and New Zealand
with £71,481 followed by
Rising Fast £66,765. Tulloch
is now third on the list, having
gone ahead of Phar Lap, who
won £56,425 in Australia.
Shannon won only £18,987 of
his £84,648 in this country.
The rest was won in America,
where Phar Lap also won one
event, the Agua Caliente

The Melbourne Racing
Club, which conducted last
Saturday’s meeting at Caulfield,
“It’s like everything else—once in a while' you find
a child-prodigy .”
will stage its Easter meeting
at Flemington next weekend.
Main race on Saturday will be
the Victoria Handicap over
seven furlongs; on Monday,
the 10-furlongs Sandown Cup.
On Tuesday the Moonee Valley
Racing Club will conduct a
charity meeting at the Valley.
Incidentally, work is going
forward well on the M.R.C.’s
own course at Sandown Park,
some 15 miles out of Mel-
bourne. The tracks have been
sown, and preliminary work
started on the landscape of the
course which, when completed,
will be the most advanced in
Australia. If all goes accord-
ing to plan, the club will be
ready to race by 1961 at the
latest.
Although he is now a six-
year-old, the Carbon Copy
horse, Shadow Play, is racing
better than ever before. He
ran the 10 furlongs of the
Shannon Handicap at Caul-
field' in 2.2 9-10, particularly
smart time on a track dead-
ened by a couple of days’
rain. The track and Austra-
lian record is 2.1 3-5, held by
Livorno. At his previous start
Shadow Play raced home
strongly to defeat the good
Sydney horse, Lindbergh, at
Moonee Valley, and before
that ran well in top-company
in the Alister Clark Stakes.
Ten furlongs, no more and no
less, seems to be Shadow
Play’s distance. Throughout
his career he has won seven
races, and each one of them
has been a 10-furlong event.
Caulfield trainer Basil
Conaghan started two young-
sters in the first division of
the Balwyn Handicap, a six-
furlong event for two-year-old
colts and geldings, and his
charges finished first and
second. The winner was
Monasterevan, a New
Zealand-bred gelding by Pride
of Kildare out of Baldora.
The gelding is the first horse
raced by his owner, W. R.
Dickenson, who paid 1000
gns. for him at the N.Z.
sales. There was a lot to like
about Monasterevan’s win.
He was racing first-up after a
spell, and was forced to race
three and four wide until the
field straightened-up. In the
run home he came right
away to win well. He had
only two starts before he was
spelled and finished second
both times, to good performers
Altergo and Kelvin Valley.
Against the class racing at
present, Monasterevan could
run up a string of wins.
Conaghan’s other charge,
second-placegetter King Leo,
is owned by a quartette of
women. Three of them,
Mesdames Beaver, Fry berg
and Lancaster, are wives of
paddock-bookmakers, and the
fourth, Miss Jill Webb, is a
city businesswoman. King
Leo has won in the country,
and could give the ladies a
metropolitan win.
After running four, minor
placings from his previous
seven starts, Society Beau
broke through for a win in
the second Balwyn Handicap.
Possibly with the hope of get-
ting a better price, trainer H.
Cousens replaced Bill Wil-
liamson, who had ridden the
colt at its previous start,
with his apprentice, Teddy
McGrath. That move failed,
inasmuch as the colt was
always at odds-on, but never-
theless Williamson had a hand
in the win. He told McGrath
that the horse disliked making
a turn, and would do his best
only if allowed to run wide
into the straight. That is
exactly how the boy rode the
winner. He allowed his mount
to make the turn wide-out,
but well-balanced, and in the
run along the straight Society
Beau easily picked up the
leaders for an impressive win.
Ron Hutchinson’s double at
Caulfield —he rode Solbeam in
the Eltham Handicap, and
Renounce in the Riversdale
Trial —showed why he is rated
one of the country’s best riders
over a distance. ' In both races
he brought his mount along
with a perfectly-timed run to
smother the opposition. If a
horse has the stamina to run
a distance, Hutchinson’s exact
judgment of pace guarantees
that the horse will be doing its
best at the business-end of a
race.
A galloper to catch the eye
in the second Balwyn was the
St. Magnus gelding, Hoogli.
Lightly raced, Hoogli was a
long way out of his ground
until the last furlong, but he
finished particularly- well into
third place. The St. Magnus
stock like a bit of ground, and
Hoogli might turn out a good
performer when the two-year-
old events are run over a
distance.'
Although he is rising 10,
Noble Law is still the most
dashing ’chaser in Melbourne.
Burdened with 12.4, and con-
ceding from 201 b. to 431 b. to
the opposition in last Saturday’s
Kenilworth Steeplechase, the
son of Duke John easily out-
jumped' and outstayed the field.
Peerless jumping rider Brian
Smith completed a double “hat-
trick” on the winner. It was
his third successive win in the

Kenilworth Steeplechase, and
his third win in as many mounts
during the week. He had won
at Traralgon on the previous
Tuesday, and at Bendigo on the
Wednesday.
Noble Law was retired from
racing at the end of last jump-
ing season. His owner,
furniture-retailer Rupert Steele,
said last Saturday that the
aged gelding fretted away from
the racing scene and that he
would be kept in work as long
as he maintained his zest for
racing.
Solbeam, who won the 10-
furlongs Eltham Handicap for
three-year-olds at Caulfield,
shaped like a horse who could
develop into a useful stayer.
In the last bunch with half-
a-mile to go, Solbeam put in
a sustained run that carried
him to a comfortable win. A
good-looking chestnut, Sol-
beam is by the imported Helios
out of Moonbeam. His only
previous success was in a
country maiden event, but, like
most of his sire’s stock, he
obviously needs a distance. The
Helios breed improves with
racing—horses like Wodalla,
Sunworship and Sunium were
not of much account until their
fourth year—and Solbeam next
season could be a good-class
handicapper.

“Sawtell”: The Hyperion
horse High Peak has been a
great success at the stud in
Australia, particularly as a
sire of smart two-year-olds
and sprinters. Now his
daughters look like putting
him on the map as a sire of
brood-mares, while he is still
relatively young. Recent
winners Lady Replica and La
Strada, and other smart fillies
Chavey Note and Shell Pink,
are all from High Peak mares.
“Bicky”: Top Victorian two-
year-old colt Nilento, which in
its short career has run-up four
wins and a creditable second
to Misting in the V.R.C. Sires’
Produce Stakes, has been ridden
in all its races by Caulfield
jockey Ken Smith. No stranger
to champions, Smith in his
apprenticeship days 15 years
ago won many races on that
grand mare Tranquil Star,
winner of the Caulfield Cup
and many w.-f.-a. events. To
distinguish himself from Keith
Smith, the cross-country jockey,
Ken Smith always uses his
Christian-name for riding
purposes.

“Bullaway”: While champion
W.A. rider Frank Treen is
making a name for himself in
Melbourne, Victorian Frank
Flannery is busy booting home
the winners in Perth. Another
Victorian, W. A. Smith, who
couldn’t make the grade in
either Melbourne or Perth, is
doing very well since moving
to N.Z.

“Veryl”: The omission of
Victorian hurdler John Chit-
tick from the Empire Games
team has displeased Victorians.
Chittick has won the Austra-
lian 120yds.-hurdles title for
the past two years. This year
he beat N.S.W.’s Berry Prim-
rose (with both recording the
same time, 14.45ec.); but Prim-
rose, because of more con-
sistency over the season, is
the hurdler picked for Cardiff.
The Victorians’ displeasure is
understandable ; yet Primrose,
by his consistent form, has
fully earned a trip. Problems
like this must always arise in
picking a team; after all,
when two batsmen are con-
tending for one place in a
Test-team, it’s not always the
one with the higher average
for that season who is chosen.
With Primrose not competing,
Chittick won the 120yds.
hurdles at last Saturday’s
Empire Games meeting at
Olympic Park, Melbourne;
and at the same meeting
another Cardiff reject, Gary
Bromhead, won the 100yds.

Sunday there was held in aid of

N.S.W. what was billed as “the
biggest professional athletic

Jack Carr, this year’s winner
of the Bendigo “Thousand,”
Terry Clarke, and Melbourne
V.F.L. footballer and winner

years, whipped through the
match in only 81min.; some of
the earlier matches of the

smin., had been marathons. The
doubles-title was won by Mark

in the season reached, and were
defeated in, the finals of the

singles was won by Lorraine
Coghlan.

“Old Pivot”: A full team
of Tasmanian 'footballers,
down to the 20th man, have
invaded Melbourne to try to
make the final training-lists of
V.F.L. clubs. They come from
the three major Leagues on the
Speck. However, as it is
centenary carnival year of
’Rules and Tasmania is compet-
ing in the top division, it is
unlikely any of the island’s
leading players will be cleared.
“Nedrium”: In recent years
Australian Rules has been the
missionary football-code, with
attempts to expand in N. S.
Wales and Queensland and with
plans for export to N.Z.,
Pakistan and U.S.A. It’s had
some success, too, in Queens-
land particularly around
Townsville, Mt. Isa, Mary
Kathleen and Cairns. Which
makes it all the more surprising
to see Rugby League pitching
for public support in Denili-
quin, in the N.S.W. Riverina.
Deniliquin was mentioned as a
Rules stronghold as far back as
Joe Furphy’s time (see his
Rigby’s Romance). Driving-
force behind the new League
move appears to be Sydney-
siders posted to the region by
State departments.
“Old School Boy”:
“Nauticus” (B. 12/2/’5B) refers
to that all-time gentleman Rev.
Mullineux as being captain of
the English Rugby Union team
of 1905. I think it was around
1898 he was here. Harding was
captain of the 1904 British
team. I am sound on that
point, as I had a game against
them. Mullineux’s team played
against the G.P.S. schools in
Sydney, and he made the team
and game of Rugby beloved by
them.

In Chicago on March 25
“Sugar” Ray Robinson, at 37,
regained the world middle-
weight crown, which he had
lost last September, from
Carmen Basilio. It was a
narrow points-decision over
15 rounds, and both boxers
had “had” it at the end: It
is 12 years ago, back in '1946,
since Robinson won the world
welterweight title. He first
won the middleweight title,
from Jake La Motta*, in
February, 1951, and has held
it five times. No other boxer,
in any division, has ever
before held a world title that
many times. Even if he may
not still have all his old
punching - power, Robinson
must be acknowledged one of
the greatest boxers, pound for
pound, of all time.
“Keima”: A brother-and-
sister combination is going to
the Empire Games (the famous
swimsters John and lisa
Konrads); but there are also
two brothers going. They are
Queensland boxers Ollie and
Wally Taylor, who have been
Australian amateur champions
(Ollie, bantamweight; Wally,
feather) for the past two years.
* • • •
“Atala”: Two aboriginal
boxers were in the running
for the Empire Games team:
Jeff Dynevor (Q.), a flyweight,
and Robert Weetra (S.A.),
a lightweight. Unfortunately
both were injured in their
respective States’ champion-
ships, and could not compete
in the Australian titles in
Sydney, from which the Empire
Games team was picked. Had
they been selected, they would
probably have been the first
aborigines picked in an Empire
Games team.
“Veryl”: I see where it is
claimed that, at Melbourne
Stadium on Mar. 14, Italian
featherweight Joe Grazziano
set a world-record when he
k.o.’d Ray Keith in llsec.
Keith walked into a right-cross
as he reached the centre of the
ring. I suppose it would be
just about a record short
stoush. Still, over the years and
years of ring history through-
out the world there must surely
have been other fights which
also didn’t get past one hit.

Brief outline of the cricketing
career of Australian Test-player
Richie Benaud?
Born at Koorawatha (N.S.W.) on
Oct. 6, 1930, he played his first
first-grade match, for the Sydney
club of Cumberland, at the age of
16, a team-mate and fellow legspin-
bowler being his father, Lou
Benaud, his early cricketing mentor.
He played his first Sheffield Shield
game (against Queensland in Sydney)
“Are you sure you aren't just saying that to me because
there's no one else?"
in Jan., 1949, but made only 2
and did not bowl. He was omitted
from the first two Shield matches
in 1949-50, but then won back his
place, and has never since been
omitted except through injury. He
captained N.S.W. in a couple of
matches in 1955-56.
His first Test was against the West
Indies (the fifth Test in 1951-52, in
which he made 3 and 19 and took
1-14 in the second innings). He
was 12th-man in the first Test against
South Africa in 1952-53, then played
in the other four. In England in
1953 he played in the first, second
and fourth Tests, failing badly each
time, and was omitted from the
other two. Since then he has held
his Test place, and in all has played
32 Tests, including the five in South
Africa this season.
A high-scorer and consistent
v.icket-taker in Shield-cricket and
other first-class games, his Test per-
formances were for long very dis-
appointing. Some of his outstand-
ing Test efforts have been: 121 in
the fifth Test against West Indies
(June, 1955), one of the fastest Test-
centuries ever made; a hard-hitting
second-innings 97 in the second 1956
Test against England, which helped
Australia on to its only Test-win that
scries; 122 in the first Test against
South Africa this season; and his
100 and 4-70 and 5-84 in the fourth
lest of the series. After taking
5-82 in the fifth Test he reached
100 wickets and 1000 runs in Tests.
And he’s always been a very good
fieldsman.
One of Benaud’s most remarkable
innings was his second-innings 135
against T. N. Pearce’s XI at Scar-
borough (Sept., 1953), which
included 11 sixes and nine fours.
Only two other first-class innings
have been played in which 11 sixes
have been hit.

Some particulars of Hugh D.
Mclntosh ?
Born in Sydney on Sept. 10, 1876,
and educated at St. Mary’s Marist
Brothers’ College, his career began
“sleeping in wet doorways as a
tinker’s boy” (to quote “El V.’s”
obituary in B. 11/2/’42). “Under
the burly exterior of hard experi-
ence he was a wistful sentimentalist,
always hero-worshipping some
prototype he’d selected as a pat-
tern —aspiring to figure as a Wil-
liamson or Ziegfeld, or else as a
newspaper lord.” Theatrical entre-
preneur, boxing-promoter, news-
paper-proprietor and N.S.W.
M.L.C., he was associated execu-
tively with many charitable and
soldiers’ organisations, and with
many hospitals. He refereed the
famous Burns-Johnson fight in
Sydney in 1908, which he had pro-
moted, The Bulletin (31/12/’08)
pronouncing him a good ref—“he
knew the game from A to Z.” A
controversial figure, he was criti-
cised and disliked in some quarters.
But he was also respected—here,
for instance, is Nellie Stewart, in
her My Life’s Story (1923): “When
I hear some Sydney people talk
slightingly of this big man I can-
not bear it —for he is a man all
through. . . . When my life seemed
broken beyond all possibility of
comfort, when I felt I wanted to
creep quietly to some corner and,
die, Hugh D. Mclntosh comforted
and sustained me. . . . Nor did he
end only in talk” —he gave her a
big part in the long-running “Chu
Chin Chow.” Hugh D. Mclntosh

Brief details of the beginning and
aims of the Australian Elizabethan
Theatre Trust?
in 1949 the Commonwealth
Government invited Tyrone Guth-
rie to tour Australia and report
on the best method of establish-
ing an Australian theatre. His
views on the state of the home-
grown theatre at that time were
not entirely flattering to Australian
hopes, but theatre enthusiasts
refused to give up their dream for
the speedy creation of a national
theatre. The Trust was the natural
expiession of a deeply-felt urge in
Australian life; it was decided to
commemorate the 1954 visit to
Australia of the Queen and Prince
Philip by launching an appeal for
funds to establish a theatrical Trust.
The object of this appeal was sum-
marised as follows: “Our aim is to
provide a theatre of Australians by
Australians for Australians.”
A fund of £90,000 was raised from
private persons and institutions
throughout Australia, many ot
whom became sponsoring mem-
bers by donating £5OO or more. To
this was added a grant of £30.000
from the Commonwealth Govern-
ment. A board of directors was
appointed, representing 1400 mem-
bers contributing annual subscrip-
tions of £5 each. The Trust was
incorporated under Royal Charter
and Her Majesty graciously con-
sented to become its Patron. From
the outset it was decided to attempt
to raise the standards of Austra-
lian theatre to that of the finest
overseas companies. The Trust is
concentrating on an Australian
drama-company; an Australian

scale); assistance to promising
playwrights and training of young
artists.
In order to present continuing
tours of high-standard drama and
opera, the Trust determined in the
first place to include a percentage
of thoroughly popular entertain-
ment in its projects. During the
initial years of its work, the Trust
applied to State Governments and
city councils for financial assist-
ance. This appeal was met by all
the States'and by the city councils
of Sydney, Melbourne and Bris-
bane, an annual subsidy of over
£40,000 being voted towards sup-
port of the Trust’s aims. (Infor-

Brief Answers
A.L.: Suggest you contact the
Registrar-General in your State.
J.S.: (1) Sidney J. Bakers
Australia Speaks (1953) says a
“ho&plater” is “a person who
drives a car that is painted to look
like a taxi and operates mainly at
night to avoid detection.” (2) An
“eggshell blonde” is a bald person.
M.S.B.: If you post your
MS. with a covering letter to a
publisher, the work will be con-
sidered and you will be told
whether it is acceptable for
publication. The publisher may or
may not be prepared to give you
any criticism. What about asking
the opinion of someone in your
own town whom you know to be
a reader of good novels? If his
opinion is encouraging, you might
try Angus and Robertson, Ltd.,
Sydney, or the Jacaranda Press,
Brisbane... .H.F.8.: (1) Write
your local Town Clerk. (2) Accord-
ing to Chas. Gardner, jnr., execu-
tive-secretary of the U.S. Advisory
Committee on Weather Control,
writing’ in Water, the 1955 Year-
book of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, “scientific rainmaking”
in the U.S.A. began in 1946 when
Dr. Vincent J. Schaefer sprinkled
particles of dry-ice from an aero-
plane and produced precipitation.
A little later Dr. Bernard Vonnegut
used silver-iodide as the precipita-
tor. The scientific basis of rain-
making, continues Gardner, is
“artificial nucleation” —that is, tlje
supplying of artificial nuclei, or
particles, to clouds thought to lack
enough natural nuclei. Most of
the large commercial “cloud-
seeders” in the U.S.A. use silver-
iodide. (3) Gardner states in the
same article that “artificial nuclea-
tion has had a big impact on the
nation lU.S.A.], particularly in the
West,” and that many States in
LJ.S.A. had passed legislation to
do with rainmaking or had
legislation pending. (4) No, there
seems no ground for that belief.
(5) R. G. Casey, Minister in
Charge of the C.5.1.R.0., said in
Washington last October that Aust
tralia was leading the world in
research on man-made rain, and
that Australian scientists expected
to solve within a few years all the
problems of artificial rainmaking.

"BAN THE BOMB"
T ARGE popular movements
■*-' having become increasingly
rare in latter years, the British
public—as represented by the
press, anyway —seems slightly
surprised at" itself over the
dimensions and variety of
campaigns to keep Britain out
of the nuclear-weapons race —
or, as it is commonly expressed
by Communists and others, to
“ban the H-bomb.”
New Jerusalems?
Surveying the anti-H-bomb
field, “Manchester Guardian”
comments that “one of the
striking things about this
country [Britain] in the last
10 years has been the absence
of an obvious Jerusalem for
London “Daily Express”
“MR. MACMILLAN! TAKE
AWAY THAT CAGE-
CAN’T YOU SEE IT’S
IN FUR IA TING THAT
POOR MAN-EATING
TIGER!”
men to seek, or of a deep
revulsion from an acknow-
ledged evil. Can it be that
(setting aside the brief and
traumatic Suez crisis) we are
now witnessing the revival of
Jeiusalem-seeking in the agita-
tion against the use, possession,
and testing of nuclear
weapons? If so, the conse-
quences may be far-reaching.
“What is certainly happen-
ing is an upsurge of dissent over
foreign- and defence-policy. It
has happened quickly over the
last few months, and it takes
several forms. First, a group
within the Labor Party, largely
identified with the ‘Victory for
Socialism’ movement,, has set
up an unofficial H-bomb
Campaign Committee; its
members avowedly dissent from
official Labor policy on nuclear
weapons. Among them are
several familiar dissenters of
the Labor Left, like Mr. Zilli-
acus, Mr. Swingler, and Mr.
Harold Davies.”
“Multitude of Groups”
There are also, the “Man-
chester Guardian” notes, a
national Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament which, launched
less than two months ago, drew
5000 people to the Central
Hall, Westminster, and several
overflow meetings; and “a
multitude of groups, from the
Twickenham Council for the
Abolition of Nuclear Weapons,
which has elicited from Mr.
Khrushchev a telegram nearly
1600 words long, to the Alder-
maston March Committee, a
body devoted to Gandhian
principles of non-violence
which proposes to organise at
Easter a four-day march on
the atomic-energy establish-
ment at Aldermaston in Berk-
shire.”
The “Manchester Guardian”
lists the main non-political body
as the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, of which the
President is Bertrand Russell,
While the executive committee
includes Canon L. J. Collins,
Michael Foot, Arthur Goss,
Sheila Jones, journalists James
Cameron and Ritchie Calder,
Howard Davies (treasurer of
the United Nations Associ-
ation), Kingsley Martin, J. B.
Priestley, Professor J. Rotblat
and Lord Simon of Wythen-
shawe.
“The purpose of the cam-
London “New Statesman”
"YOU AND YOUR CRAZY IDEAS”
paign,” the “Manchester
Guardian” adds, “is ‘to demand
a British initiative to reduce
the nuclear peril and to stop
the armaments-race, if need be,
by unilateral action by Great
Britain’ ”:
“Its fundamental aim, in
short, is that Britain should
renounce nuclear weapons
through what Canon Collins
calls ‘the conversion of the
British people to a new way
of thinking’.”
“Appalling Moral Problem”
Despite the “popular” nature
of the campaign against nuclear
weapons, however, British
editorial comment would seem
to be largely against it. London
“News Chronicle,” for instance,
comments that “It is unfair to
accuse those who accept the
policy of the deterrent of being
‘in favor’ of the Bomb.
Mistakenly or not those who
agree with Mr. Macmillan and
Mr. Gaitskell do so because
they believe it offers the best
hope of maintaining peace—
not because they relish a
nuclear armory.
“The H-bomb poses an
appalling moral problem. But
that problem is set in political
circumstances which it is reck-
less to ignore. There is nothing
courageous, good or wise in
regarding the mushroom cloud
as a moral abstraction. Merely
to denounce it and refuse to
have anything to do with it is
useless.
“The task before British
statesmen and the British
people is not to wash their
hands of the responsibilities of
world politics. It is to shoulder
those responsibilities and try to
improve the horrible situation
in which man finds himself.
“That is why this newspaper
[“News Chronicle”] believes
that nuclear neutrality is
moral abdication. There is a
strong case for this country
[Britain] sharing the burden of
nuclear weapons with her
allies. But merely to contract
out of Nato, which a renunci-
ation of H-bombs would
involve, would increase the
dangers of conflict.”
Priestley and Russell
In another typical view,
London “Daily Mail” pays
particular attention to the
views of Priestley and Professor
Russell :
“If the nations retain nuclear
weapons they risk annihilating
war. If they abandon them we
British expose ourselves to
submergence in the Communist
world. This is the dilemma,
and at the moment it is
insoluble. Until those who
shout of our wickedness in
retaining the bomb can show
us the way out they had better
be silent.
“Mr. J. B. Priestley says:
‘Our possession of nuclear
weapons and our threats to use
them degrade us.’ Yet it is
only 10 years since his fellow-
campaigner Bertrand Russell


Eailh in the
Eulur-c
i
At the eve of another Easter, I believe it is
time for us as Christians to take stock of ourselves
and the world around us.
Today’s upsurge of science sharpens the
challenge to religion. As the Queen Mother
reminded us during her visit to Australia, we live
in an age of spiritual crisis.
But has there ever been a time, since that first
Easter, when the Christian Faith was not in
challenge?
Look back to the. time when Christ was
crucified. The world was then oppressed by
conquerors. That was the time in which faith in
the Resurrection was born. Look across the years
of the early Christian Church, small and struggling
and with overwhelming power ranged against it.
Consider the centuries of conflict and
persecution through which the Faith has passed, to
survive and spread. The Christian sees in this the
hand of a Divine Power raised to protect belief
in Christ against every force that has been gathered
to assail it.
But the challenge today is not bounded by
what comes out scientific discovery. It comes
also out of the indifference of many Christians to
the practice of what they profess in Creed: as though
they were prepared to say “I believe” and to let it
go at that.
And meanwhile, in an awakening Asia, for
example—in a huge section of humanity which
Christian teaching has barely touched—forces of
unbelief are at work among hundreds of millions
whose young people could be won from their own
forms of religion to a denial of all but the material
end of man.
There, then, is the greatest test of spiritual
strength that Christianity has known. And here,
in Easter, is the Christian’s assurance that the issue
can never be misted in doubt or fear.
For here we recall how Supremely it has been
shown that the spirit of man is immortal and can
never be destroyed.

was advocating a preventive
war against Russia. Was that
‘degrading’?
“Professor Russell says:
‘lt is absolutely necessary if
mankind is to survive for the
H-bomb to be banned every-
where.’ Yet even before the
first nuclear explosion he said
the West should rearm rapidly
and, ‘ in certain circumstances,’
use the H-bomb first.
“In 1949 he said he would
‘prefer a third world war, an
atomic war, to Russian domina-
tion.’ Does he think atomic
war more moral than nuclear
war?
“Mr. Priestley writes: ‘lf
this country [Britain] walked
out of the nuclear-arms race
and declared that it would
defend itself, if necessary, with
anything it could lay its hands
on, from shotguns ,to bombs
made out of corned-beef tins,
it would be a safer place than
it is today.’
“We [Brijtain] did something
like that in 1940, when we had
little but pikes to stave off
the Germans. That did not
please Mr. Priestley, who
criticised the ‘shadow-show’ of
a national war-effort.
“We quote these publicists at
length in order to ask: ‘Could
we really entrust the destinies
—London "Daily Mail”
CAREFUL!
of Christian civilisation to the
ideas of such counsellors?’”
“Ignominy Begins Here”
Summing-up most of the
arguments against the “nuclear
neutralists,” London “Time and
Tide” notes that “once again
the air is ringing with the cries
of the ’thirties”:
“Once again people are
attending meetings, after years
of almost total political apathy,
and once again the Labor Party
is torn by a struggle between
leaders who are not altogether
lost to reality and a mass of
followers who have ceased to
think at all. Nor is blindness
to be found solely among those
who vote Socialist; there are
plenty of Tories, and more
Liberals, who hope to remove
danger by laying down the
shield we hold against it.
“The waves of pacifism which
sweep the country every now
and then in the 20th century
are no more rational or respec-
table than the recurrent waves
of jingoism which swept it
in the 19th. It would be putting
it mildly to say that the anti-
H-bomb army is composed of
very heterogenous units, but
it is difficult to avoid the
suspicion that many of them
have a common bond in plain
and ignominious fear. Fear is
contagious and that is where
our greatest present danger lies.
“The attitude of the con-
sistent pacifist is comprehen-
sible. He is as much opposed
to taking life in war as he is
to losing his own. By the logic
of his position he must accept
the chance that an unarmed
Britain might be totally sub-
jected to Communism with
Christian children brought up
as atheists—not only that, but
brought up to be soldiers as
well. A Communist conquest
would mean the end of pacifism
itself. This is what he must
be ready to face. It is a very
hard creed.
“However, consistent pacifists
are few The mass of those
%ho now protest their horror
of nuclear weapons kept the,r
equanimity quite easily, as long

nuclear arms and bases, but are
quite content to let the United
States continue to protect us,
bearing all the risks alone. A
good many people are puzzled
to know why Mr. Khrushchev
so pointedly snubbed Britain
when he sent out his messages
of agreement to a meeting of
Foreign Secretaries. The
explanation may be simple
enough: perhaps he has
decided that Britain is going
weak and may safely be
ignored.
A Russian Victory?
“So much for the fatuity
of giving a ‘moral lead’ to the
world. It is almost inconceiv-
able that this ancient delusion
should still survive, for nobody
has yet explained how it is
possible to give a moral lead
to people without morals. A
Britain which had made her-
self militarily helpless would be
regarded by Russia as being as
good as in the bag and our
voluntary helplessness would
be regarded in the Kremlin as
an immense victory in the
ceaseless campaign to isolate the
United States.
“Washington would take
the same view, with conse-
quences dire to ourselves. The
people who want to ban the ,
H-bomb also want to ban un-
employment and think it would
be rather nice to ban inflation,
too. But they would have both
in full measure if they ever
succeeded in forcing America
to write Britain off completely
as a broken ally.
“That will not happen. The
danger of this mounting cam-
paign is not that it will succeed
m stripping our country bare
of all effective defence but that
it will fuddle and confuse the
minds of our own people and
weaken our standing and
influence in the world by
making our closest allies
wonder if we can be relied
upon.
“Britain simply cannot
afford to become a nuclear
neutral. This is not a matter
of empty prestige, as some
allege, but of our own vital
interests and of common loyalty
to our allies. Britain in fact
will not become a nuclear
neutral, however frantic the
clamor grows. But, if it does
grow, the damage will be grave.
When Ernest Bevin was
Foreign Secretary he com-
plained of being stabbed in
the back. If he were still
Foreign Secretary he would find
more pungent words for
agitators who are doing their
best to convince both friend
and enemy that we are going
either weak in the wits or weak
in the will.”

native soil. American yearn-
ings for traditions older than
their own are being further
stirred by a U.S. enterprise
whidi advertises:
“Remember a square-inch of
Scotland makes a unique and
intimate gift for your friends.”
In a comment possibly tinged
with Caledonian respect for
such astuteness, Edinburgh
“Scotsman” notes that the
American concern is intent “on
selling an acre by the shores
of Loch Lomond piecemeal to
those citizens of the United
States whose romantic hearts
yearn for the least modicum of
Caledonian soil”:
“Now an acre works out —■
incredible as it may seem to
those who have never troubled
to do the necessary arithmetic—
at something over six-and-a-
quarter-million square-inches.
So, at a dollar a square-inch,
this favored part of the ‘bonnie
banks’ is going to be, as the
promoters themselves might
well say, quite a proposition.
“Of course their clients are
not restricted to a single
square-inch. But, even allowing
for bulk purchases, the assump-
tion must be that quite a tidy
proportion of the population
of the United States are
prepared to demonstrate the
animated nature of their souls
by subscribing a dollar or more
to the proposition that they
should say to themselves, ‘This
is my own, my native land! ’
‘‘We cannot but be flattered
at this very practical demon-
stration of the native American
assessment of the strength of
Scottish sentiment in the United
States. We would scarcely
ourselves have dared to put it
quite so high, despite the un-
doubted fact that every
American who visits these
shores unhesitatingly lays claim
to a tartan-worthy forebear.
“Nor can we be averse,
within reason, to allowing a few
million Americans to secure,
if not a foothold, then at least
a toe-hold on certain selected
fractions of Scottish earth.
“The only doubt we have
in the matter is concerned with
where this practice is going to
stop. The Americans have a
well-established reputation as
go-getters. Once they have
gone and got one Scottish
acre they may become set on
getting in, as it were, on the
ground floor in Scotland, and
turn poor Caledonia into a
fractionised enclave of the
United States.
“We could never consent thus
to be minced into millions of
dofiar-areas, however golden
the gleam of the dollar may be
to those who must deal in
devalued sterling.”
The Last Battleship?

editorial salute to the Wiscon-
sin, which —leaving not a single
battleship in commission under
the American flag—“has gone
to Bayonne, where great ships
lie quiescent in their plastic
cocoons like elephants who
have gone to their legendary
graveyards to die”:
“The battleship of iron and
steel passed through strange
forms into the massive vessel
of our da % culminating in thb
huge Japanese Musashi and
Yamato, which carried guns of
nearly JBin. calibre. But
although the war for which the
two Japanese giants were built
did see surface battleships fight-
ing one another in line battle—
notably at Cape Matapan and
Surigao Strait —the recall had
already sounded.
“The first notes might have
been heard clearly on July 21,
1921, when the Ostfriesland, a-
German dreadnought that had
survived Jutland, went down
under the assault of Billy
Mitchell’s bombers.
“World War II added many
examples to that lesson —
Taranto, Pearl Harbor, the
sinking of the Prince of Wales
and Repulse, and finally the
aerial destruction of the huge
Musashi in the battle for Leyte
Gulf and of her sister-ship
Yamato off Kyushu with nearly
2500 men and most of her
escort in two hours of bombard-
ment from the air.
“There have been* other
omens as the submarine and its
torpedo increased in size, range

forceful was the instant dis-
appearance of the Arkansas, in

Malta
Three comments on Malta’s
problem of “integration” into
the United Kingdom:
Edinburgh “Scotsman” :
“Recent talk in Malta about
independence has not served
to help matters. The Maltese
themselves must realise that it
is only by retaining the British
connection that they can main-
tain their standard of living.
Realisation of this fact was
probably the main explanation
of the proposal for integration
which was agreed upon at the
round - table conference in
1955. Since then, largely
because of the accumulating
economic problems of the
island, relations have tended
to become strained, and the
revision in the British defence-
programme has aggravated the
difficulties.”
London “Daily Telegraph”
“The likelihood that Parlia-
ment would accept integration,
with the election of three
Maltese M.P.s to Westminster,
has been growing less and less
ever since the round-table con-
ference (not unanimously)
recommended the scheme. But
the Government stands com-
mitted to it —if Malta wants it.
Rejection by the Maltese Prime
Minister, Mr. Mintoff, would
save the Government from
having to introduce a measure
certain to be contested—and,
it may be added, would be
received with relief by a large
section of Maltese opinion.”
“One of four outcomes from
these long negotiations with
Malta is possible ; and it is
time that the British Govern-
ment set them down in order
of preference. The best out-
come would still be if Malta
could be integrated into the
United Kingdom, on terms no
less but also no more
favorable than is any other
development-area like South
Wales; but Mr. Mintoff
apparently will not integrate
unless he gets more favorable
terms than that.
“Another course would be
politely to offer Malta com-
plete independence. This is a
possibility that the British
Government should regard as
its second preference. There is
no longer any great value to
the Navy in having the base
on the island under British
political control; if Malta
became independent it would
still be bound to lease the base-
facilities to either Britain or
Nato, merely in order to
buttress its economy. Indeed,
blandly to offer independence
to Mr. Mintoff might be the
quickest way to persuade him
to accept a fair scheme of
integration instead.
“The third, and less desirable,
course would be to give Mr.
Mintoff all the money he wants.
Even here a distinction should
be drawn between the less-
serious error of merely offer-
ing excessive development-
loans for a year or two ahead
(which he probably could not
fully spend anyway), and the
much bigger mistake of under-
taking to keep a lot of
redundant dockyard-workers in
full and immobile employment
iq their present jobs.
“The fourth and worst course
would be to do none of these
things and to allow Malta to
become another Cyprus.”
Various Voices
Viscount Kilmuir ( Britain's
Lord Chancellor): “So long as
the West possesses two assets
—the bombs and the ability to
get them through the Russian
defences they are bound to
restrain Soviet calculations. If
they were jettisoned, the might
and force of Soviet conven-
tional arms could be used as a
counter—or an instrument—
against the West whenever
desired. There is no answer to
the argument which has hitherto
been accepted by all parties
that it is better to run the
London “Daily Mirror"
“HELLO THERE! IRONED OUT YOUR LITTLE LOCAL DIFFICULTIES?”
prepared to embrace Com-
munism willingly. All were
originally subdued by fear,
force or fraud.”
Professor Max Beloff:
“People don’t act by moral
example in international affairs,
We have only two things in
common with the Russians:
neither of us wants to be
obliterated, and neither wants
to P a y for a heavy armaments-
programme. We should build on
those things.”
Britain's Foreign Secretary,
Selwyn Lloyd: “A good deal of
remote risk of nuclear war than
to face the consequences of
stripping ourselves of the pro-
tection of the nuclear deter-
rent.”
Lord Hail sham: “Com-
munism is not simply a
political theory. It is a
dynamic doctrine of world
revolution. Communism has
never been prepared to leave its
advance to the democratic
process. If it had, it would
never have advanced at all.
No nation, not even Russia
and China, has ever been
agitation is going on to make
people believe that the whole
trouble nowadays is nuclear
weapons. That is complete
fallacy. The trouble is world
war whatever the weapons with
which it is fought. If a world
war were to be waged with the
new rockets, aircraft and inter-
continental missiles and all the
rest of it, that would mean the
end of ordered civilisation as
we know it, even if not a single
nuclear weapon was used. Do
not be led away into the belief
that conventional world war is
something to be tolerated.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Personality Tests
“Campbell Joe” (B. 5/2/ ’5B)
need not worry about psycho-
tests ever becoming general in
Australia. We must, of course,
see that our migration-policy
avoids a build-up of a poly-
genetic population similar to
that of the U.S.
The average Australian is
sufficiently normal and well
adjusted to forge ahead under
his own personal direction.
Roughly there are only two
classes in American com-
munities —the directeds and the
directors ; those who get ulcers
and those who give ’em.
To maintain the correct
balance and keep up the supply
of top-executives, selectivity-
tests are universally applied in
industry and commerce.
The fellow who has a quick
look at the papers and realises
that the squiggle-and-wriggle
diagrams and the Kinsey-type
questionnaire are designed to
locate the docile doers acts
promptly. .
He screws the papers up,
strides up to the rostrum and
sticks them up the supervisor’s
jumper. This type is assessed as
top-executive material without
further investigation.
With the others it is a ques-
tion of reaction to fear. There
is no sentiment in U.S. business.
The test may show a high I.Q.
and a complete freedom from
dormant psychoses, but unless
you are a yes-man at all times
you have no future. In all
offices, from the President’s
down, the hat-peg is just inside
the door ; you keep on walk-
ing when you’re fired.
One week without pay and
the average American worker
—white-collar or tradesman
—is in serious trouble. His
commitments fix that for him.
Fear of such a situation
developing breeds an adulatory
attitude towards his superiors.
He’ll accept any test to get a
job or keep in it.
An Australian may try a test
from curiosity. If he doesn’t
like it he’ll say what you can
do with it, and the job as well.
Back in 1940, as head of a
large training-centre, I carried-
out some tests for the Common-
wealth Office of Education.
These people had prepared a
comprehensive series designed
to completely “sort-out a
recruit for the Armed Services.
To prove the ability-disparity
likely to be found under
such circumstances, a team of
officers, including some tall
poppies, was matched against
a camp permanent detail
cook’s offsiders, sanitary
squads, etc.
The camp men won easily,
“All right —YOU try and remember !”
with some attempts to disguise
ability thrown-in.
A special investigation
showed these fellows were all
accountants and figure-men.
They had deliberately selected
the menial jobs in order to be
able to operate as the camp's
s.-p. bookmakers!
The officers generally gave
only a fair response to the test.
They all, however, subsequently
did a magnificent job as leaders
in the field. So what? Old
Opencut (S.A.).
School-age
Agree with “Plain Aus-
tralian” (B. 12/3/’5B) that the
admittance-age of children to
schools should not be reduced
from five to four-and-a-half
years. Apart from added
pressure on accommodation
and teaching-staffs, it isn’t'
always in the child’s interests
to begin disciplined learning
too early. Some educationists
strongly advocate raising the
admittance-age to six years, as.
in most Scandinavian coun-
tries and some English
counties, arguing that often
both the sensitive and the less-
mentally-alert type of child of
the four-five group grows
weary of and rebellious to
learning before more receptive
years are reached.
Most parents, of course, are
opposed to this, and hold that
the infancy of the child would
thereby be tediously prolonged.
P. O. M. C. (N.S.W.).
Trams
P.O.M.C. (B. 26/2/’5B) is
so right. Buses do not move
people with the same facility
as do trams. Didn’t you
Sydney people, a few years
ago, conduct a test on suc-
cessive Saturdays at Rand-
wick? Buses one Saturday
and trams the next? And
didn’t the trams win hands-
down as “load-removers”?
We ordinary citizens of
Melbourne have no particular
fondness for buses. The
Tramways Board put on
double-decker buses in Bourke
Street —out to Northcote,
Preston, 7-miles-odd when
the cable trams went out. The
result was an uproar.
Every municipality along
the route complained. It took
the Tramways Board very few
years to find out that the
double-decker bus, modelled
on the London job, was; a
complete and utter failure. Do
you want to buy one for a
week-end shack? Well, if
there is one left, you can have
it.
London has always been
thrown at Melbourne as the
reason why they should have
buses—“ Good enough for
London, good enough for
you.” Rubbish!
London’s surface - traffic,
including these marvellous
buses, moves at 4.5 m.p.h.
Melbourne trams have an
average speed of 11.2 m.p.h.
“P.0.M.C.” says that “trams
are admittedly more obstruc-
tive to the road-traffic than
buses.” Did he ever watch
a “clutch” of buses pulling
into the kerb in Bourke Street?
The fifth one was nearly in
the centre of the road!

Bauxite Deposits
Australia will be interested, in
comparing its great Weipa
(N.Q.) bauxite discovery with
the other major post-war dis-
covery of bauxite deposits—in
Jamaica. These first came into
production in 1952, with two
American companies and one
Canadian operating.
In 1956 the Americans
exported some 2\-
million tons of ore
worth £4,600,0005tg.;
the Canadian Aluminium,
Ltd., co. exported around
200,000 tons of the far-
more valuable alumina
(aluminium - oxide pro-
cessed from the raw
bauxite) worth £5,800,000
stg.
In 1957 alumina-
production doubled to
435,000 tons, worth over £ll-
- stg.—most of the out-
put going to Canada. Develop-
ment is still progressing
rapidly.
An interesting side-develop-
ment is the cattle-ranching and
other agricultural developments
being carried-out by the mining
companies on parts of their

leases which will not be worked
for several decades. These
farming activities have proved
very successful and employ over
500 men, compared with 1000
employed directly on bauxite -
or alumina-production.
As the Jamaica deposits are
remarkably similar to those
of Cape York —including open-
cut mining, climatic conditions
and initial lack of port facilities
—then one could suppose that
once mining begins at Weipa,
development will be at much
the same rate. Economists cal-
culate that the Cape York
deposits will be in a very
favorable competitive position
compared to the Caribbean and
West African deposits as far as
the big market of Western
North America is concerned.
One can also hope that cattle-
raising will also be developed as
a sideline in Cape York. —
A. Austin (Yorkshire, Eng.).
South-east Asia
I agree with “Peter Simple”
(B. 5/3/’5B) that all this talk
about gratitude for Colombo
Plan aid and “bonds of friend-
ship” is idealistic —or at least
unrealistic nonsense ; but
that’s as far as our agreement
goes.
For one thing, Indonesians
have no apparent ambition to
“spread their influence” in Aus-
tralia, and the Communistic
influences at work here are not,
to any significant degree, reach-
ing us through Indonesia.
We must realise, however,
that for a couple of centuries
such Europeans as were not
actually exploiting any Asiatics
within reach were benefiting
passively from the activities of
those who were. It is useless
our telling these people that
rulers of their own races always
had, and always would have,
exploited them more ruthlessly
than any Europeans ; or that
English-speaking people, at
least, have had a change of
heart.
Asians and Africans are not
unreasonable in believing that
Europeans “freed” their
colonies because they were no
longer able to hold them and
that our present solicitude for
the welfare of our under-
privileged neighbors comes
from fear of their increasing
military power. They didn’t
nee d the Communists to tell
them that.
So far so good ; but, without
any reservations, we must spend
thought and money in helping
to raise living - standards in
undernourished communities.
If we don’t do something to
teed those people the Com-
“You KNOW you're not allowed down there!"
munists will —as they are doing
in China and Communist
domination, from being a
“risk,” will become an accom-
plished fact. In any case, if
China gets control of much
more rice-growing country the
Communists will be in a posi-
tion to starve the rest of South-
east Asia into submission—if
we let them catch us napping.
Trade being an economic
necessity, the more Asian
living-standards improve the
better markets Asia will pro-
vide for our meat, coal, Holdens
—and rice.
If we Australians are to
justify our ownership of so
much of the earth’s soil, we
must make it grow food for
the earth’s people. Rice is one
thing we can grow in quantity
on land not producing much at
present. Let’s get on with that
job.
I cannot see that better
understanding of each other
need harm either us or our
neighbors. Misunderstanding
due to ignorance can —especi-
ally if wilfully fostered by poli-
ticians —build-up antipathies
which may lead to restriction of
trade and intercourse and to
those conditions which feed
wars.
Australia is fortunate in that
it has never held colonies in
Asia, and so has not incurred
the active hatred of any of
those peoples now struggling
with their new freedoms. If
we can persuade Asians that
our views on immigration and
West New Guinea are reason-
able, and if we help them with
their food problem for a
generation or so; and if we
mind our own business while
doing so, we may in time build-
up a real goodwill among
neighbors with whom we must
trade and treat in any case if
we are to survive. We may even
acquire a prestige and influence
in this area out of proportion
to our population. Jas.
Macansh (Q.).
Universities and Writers
A university education may
not improve natural genius (B.
12/2/’5B), but it has its advan-
tages, even for a gifted writer.
Consider two noted writers
on English country
life and its problems,
both of whom pro-
tested strongly
against rural trends
of their respective
times William
Cobbett and Harold
Massingham.
Cobbett was self-
educated and had no
regrets that he had
never been to a uni-
versity. Indeed, he
desp i s e d them.
Massingham was a
product of West-
minster and Oxford.
Cobbett was a pro-
lific and omnivorous
author who could
make the dullest sub-
ject interesting. He
even wrote a very
readable grammar.
He was intemperate
in controversy.
George Saintsbury,
the critic, said of him: “A
shrewd man, naturally, and by
no means an ill-informed one
in some ways, there was yet
no assertion too wildly con-
tradictory of facts, no assump-
tion too flagrantly opposed to
commonsense for him to
make when he had an argu-
ment to further, or a craze to
support.”
In-controversy, Cobbett was
frequently guilty of conduct
as childish as it was unchival-
rous. For instance, he hated
‘The Times.” Discovering
that a certain Anna Brodie
owned some shares in that
newspaper, he used to refer to
it in his writings as “that drab


Anna B r o d i e ’ s rubbish,’*
though poor Anna had no
influence on the policy of the
paper.
Massingham, like Cobbett,
was a prolific writer, varied in
subject, and a vigorous con-
troversialist. He felt deeply
about the things he criticised.
Yet he never descended to
vulgar abuse and he was a far
closer reasoner than Cobbett..
If Cobbett had been a pro-
duct of Westminster and
Oxford he might have written
less racy prose, but it is safe
to say that he would have
shown less vulgarity and
would have argued with more
point.— Morris the Tinker
(N.S.W.).
Universities and Great Men
In .saying that Shelley was
probably the greatest English-
man of his epoch and possibly
one of the great men of all
time I was merely quoting
Shaw, and I would sooner
take him as an authority on
Shelley than the literary critic
Saintsbury, whom “Cunedda”
(B. 12/3/’5B) quotes with such
approval. I doubt if anything
Saintsbury said will be-remem-
bered, not even his English
Prose Rhythm, which I read
in my literary adolescence and
which I have never since been
able quite to get out of my
system.
Saintsbury’s idea was that
the distinguishing quality of all
great utterances in English
literature was their poetic
rhythm, i.e., it was not what
they said that was important,
but how they said it. If he
had concerned himself more
with what Shelley said than
with how he said it, he could
not have come to the conclu-
sion if the poet had lived
in a period of radical rule he
would have been a high Tory.
Oxford kicked Shelley out, not
because it objected to his
poetry, but because, in his life
and writings, he violated every
conventional value which it
shared with the lowliest laborer
in the kingdom.'
“Cunedda” compares Shelley
with Wordsworth, Southey and
Sir Walter Scott, to the detri-
ment of Shelley. Scott was a
great historical novelist, but he
did not regard himself as a
seer. He called himself an
antiquarian. He recreated the
past. Shelley was a beyond-
man ; he visualised the future ;
he was the seerlike type of
individual who saw what might
be and he tried to realise it in
the present.
However, what started this
discussion was “J.C.M.’s”
mentioning Shelley as an
example of a writer whose
mind was broadened by a
university education. If Oxford
broadened Shelley’s mind it
certainly didn’t mean to. —

Communism and China
“R.R.D.’s” article (B.
12/3/’5B) should be read with
your leader in the same issue—
as no doubt was intended.
There is one gleam of light
in all the gloom—the suggestion
that Australia might form a
bridge between the Old World
and the New.
I do not expect the Chinese,
unless provoked, to start a
major war while they seem to
be gaining their objectives, even
if slowly, by peaceful means.
Of course, they may be obliged
to fight in a war touched-off
by their allies; but for some
time to come Chinese forces
would be dependent on Russia
for much of their heavy
material, and it might not suit
the Kremlin to have the
Chinese come out of a war too
easily victorious.
China needs time —a lot of it
—to develop her potential for
war or peace, and her leaders
are too astute to be mere cats’-
paws for Russia. If a decade
or two of peace and progress
show that Communism can fill
empty bellies better than other
“isms” can, then Communism
will rule Asia. The Chinese
realise that. Why, then, should
they elect to have their cities
atomised and precious machines
smashed in someone else’s war?
That is at least a point of
view which should appeal
to the Chinese leaders if it were
put to them tactfully, and if
they were assured of our sincere
goodwill and of reasonable co-
operation in their mighty task
of organisation and develop-
ment. We, for our part, must
reconcile ourselves to the
certainty that China will
dominate Asia within 50 years ;
nothing we can do will preveni
that.
Why should we try? Apart
from humanitarian considera-
tions, a modernised, prosperous
Asia should give Australians

many opportunities for pro-

employment and benefit to us
all.
It is imperative that Aus-
tralians’ ideas about Asia
generally and China in
particular be adjusted to
present-day reality. We need
systematic education on that
subject. The Chinese are fine
people, and it is an accident of
history that for the time being
they are allies of our potential
.enemies.
It is no concern of ours what
social or political system they
set-up for themselves, so long
as they don’t try to force that
system upon us or our other
neighbors. That, of course, is
what they have been doing;
but a modification of that
aggressive policy may quite
possibly be brought about
through better understanding
of each other by Chinese and
Australians. So we need our

Peking. — Chelmcroft (Q.).
More Frenzied Finance
I have a small ledger-account
with the W.A. Government
Railways of £5. Inward freight
is charged against this, and
regulations say that the account
must be paid each month.
Recently I got a bill for 4s. As
the department had £4 16s. of
my money, and the freight-bill
is only about £1 or so most
months, I didn’t take this very
seriously. The railways did,
however, and I was dunned in
no uncertain fashion. Finally
I sent them another £5, asking
that. when freight - charges
absorbed a reasonable propor-
tion of this a bill be sent to me.
The second £5 would then be
renewed, leaving the first fiver
as interest-free capital for the
department to invest in some
profit-making concern, which,
for all I know, it had already
done.
What happens to the very
considerable amount of cash
which must be on hand in
the form of these “ledger
accounts”? Surely it is put to
useful ends somewhere? It is,
in effect, interest-free capital.

Dailey - Scarlett concerning
this oratorio, and Handel’s
writing generally, have been
answered by Mr. Nicholls, he
has left untouched three
important points:
(1) It was claimed that one
at least of the recent perform-
ances in Sydney was “The
Messiah” as Handel wrote and
heard it. This claim was cer-
tainly unfounded. Twenty-
odd oboes and a similar
number of bassoons were a
commonplace of Handel’s
orchestra. It would be
unthinkable to use such a
number today. Nor, I am
sure, was any continuo used,
“It’s the cow that jumped over the moon !"
and even if it had been, who
knows what Handel or his
deputy would have supplied?
Mr. Nicholls has indeed
taken up this point, but the 40
reeds need emphasis!
(2) “Handel was an Italian”
—of course, in style. His birth
and training were in Germany
and he became a naturalised
Englishman. One is uncertain
what this “Italianism” is meant
to imply. In t Handel’s time
Italian music was associated
with the names of Corelli,
Vivaldi and the two Scar-
lattis, and was nearly as intel-
lectual as German music
became in the 18th and 19th
centuries. If the statement is
intended to imply that the
standards and style of “La
Donn’ e mobile,” “Home to
our Mountains” or “Santa
Lucia” are to be applied to
the “Messiah,” it is of course
sheer nonsense. If not, it Is
quite irrelevant.
(3) Handel’s oratorios were
put out as “entertainment.” It
is difficult to treat this state-
ment temperately. As applied
to “Messiah,” and especially
to Part 2 —the Passion Music
—unless the word meant
something quite at odds with
its modern meaning, again we
have sheer nonsense, and
worse. It is possible that in
the vagaries of English religion
since Handel’s time some of
the emotional wallow has been
unfairly loaded on to
oratorios. But even this must
not obscure the fact that
Handel himself was an
intensely pious man, at least
on one side of his nature. He
was definitely not the man to
write, for “entertainment” (in
the modern sense), “He Was
Despised,” or the group of
choruses which follow, or
“Thy rebuke hath broken His
heart” and “Behold and See.”
Nor do his settings of the
triumphal choruses of Revela-
tion suggest entertainment, but
rather his own testimony that
in writing the “Hallelujah” he
“did see the heavens opened,
and the Great God sitting
throned before mine eyes.”
Allowing for differences of
subject, much of the foregoing
applies also to “Israel in
Egypt.” R. y. Head

No red herrings, “Trans-
porticus” (B. 19/2/’5B). My
comments did not assail the
N.S.W. Railways on the sub-
ject of its rolling-stock.
The gravamen of my
comments, with concrete illus-
trations, was the unfairness of
the railways in charging first-

preserved a record of the civil

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
CLASSING THE CLIP
IT is amazing how many
squatters, as soon as shear-
ing is over, forget all the
things they said during the
shearing: “Yes, I’ll put in
a fanlight over the classer’s
table for you before next
shearing.” “I’ll get rid of
those two old wool-rolling-
tables and get two new big
Speaking on the sub-
ject of modem methods
of transporting stock
from one country to
another, Dr. Ham-
mond, a world-
renowned animal-
research authority,
recently stated that
fertilised ewes’-eggs had
been sent from England
and transplanted to
ewes in South Africa,
using a female rabbit
as a transport medium.
If this remarkable
method of sending

the world.
ones.” And “I’ll have two or
three new wool-bins for you
before next year.”
You return next shearing—■
there is still no fanlight over
the classer’s table, and in the
late winter’s afternoon you are
still “guessing” away in the
half-gloom.
The two wool-rolling-tables
are more tottery and seem
smaller, and instead of having
those promised extra bins you
find one of your old bins
chock-a-block with super.
Yet there have been umpteen
wet days since last shearing
when his men have been sitting
on their tails in the same shed,
yaftiing.
Shearing and the classing of
the clip on any Merjno
property is the culmination of
the year’s work, planning and
expense. It is the main source
of income for the owner. Yet
some squatters could not be
more casual about their shdds
and the equipment ill them.
The lighting is often as dim
as in some dubious night-club,
and it’s the classer who cops it
from the woolbrokers when
they find “dogs” in the top-
line.
We know it’s the classer’s
privilege to stop shearing if he
thinks it is too dark to handle
wool, but under the shearing-
contractor system this takes a
bit of courage.
If he moans to the grazier
about those awful, old and
small tables, the classer will be
regarded as a crank. But those
two small tables inevitably lead
to over-skirting as the fleeces
droop over the sides. Lighter
and better skirting would pay
for those two nefr tables in
one week.
It’s pretty hard, too, to run
a clip out properly with only
about three bins. To keep your
lines reasonably straight you
are forced —through shortage
of bins—to dump many fleeces
in the pool-bin. If you had
an extra bin or two you could
make a reasonable line of
bales throughout the whole
shearing. More foolish, un-
necessary expense for the owner
in pooling-costs.
Many owners do nothing to
support the millet industry in
Australia, judging by their
reluctance to buy enough new
brooms for shearing. Some
brooms produced year after
year are so small and worn that
the shearers pinch them for
car-brooms. It’s impossible to
keep a shed clean without
plenty of good new brooms.
How the sheep are to be
brought in, what paddocks,
what age, what flock numbers,
has to be dragged out of the
squatter. “What’s coming in
next boss?” you have to ask,
three or four times a day. It's
not idle curiosity you are
plotting and plannning to do
the best for his wool. Some
owners are very good and will
tell you how they intend to
muster, what ages, and size of
mobs and what paddocks may
be burrier or dustier than
others. Armed with this in-
formation, you can really plot
a campaign.
The classer a staff wool-
valuer —at one of Australia’s
leading studs lamerited in the
shed last year: “Blimey, you’ve
got to be Mandrake at this
joint. They »bring ’em in any
old how, grown sheep, hoggets,
weaners—all small mobs of
three- or four-hundred. You’ve
just got to blend it up as best
you can. All they think about
is their paddocks!”
In the old, more leisurely
days, classers could take their
time at cut-outs and clean-ups.
If you took a couple of hours’
shearing-time these days for a
real clean-up between mobs
there would be a suicidal or
murderous shearing-contractor
and the shearers would be
“swarming” (having a meeting)
or demanding waiting-time.
If you are employed by the
contractor and want to be
employed by him again, at cut-
outs you kick it together and
hope for the best. The
“greasies” don't lose a blow.
If you are engaged by the
woolbroker you have more
chance of doing a better job
and get less pushed around,
but you don't make many
cobbers with contractors or
shearers. Only the “rousies”
like clean-ups. They can get a
bit of a bludge.
Another point which wants
emphasising. Owners using
shearing contractors should
insist that the contractor's
claSser is competent; that he
is well trained-, and has the
essential wool-store experience
necessary for preparing the clip
for trade requirements.
One grazier came to town
last year in a great state. “My
classer arrived drunk in an old
bomb. I’m sure he's no good.
What will I do?” He was no
good a graduated piece-
picker. It cost the owner £l6O
for reclassing in Sydney.
Many owners, too, or their
sons, do their own classing, and
have delusions of. grandeur
about their knowledge of wool.

woolbrokers. is intense. A

perhaps, lose his business by-
saying on the show-floor,

WEAKSTAPLE.
Schools for Stock
“Wasley”: The high educa-
tional standard of Australia’s
children could well be extended
to its flocks and herds. Admit-
tedly the training of animals
such as horses for harness and
cows for the stalls has been
done well and successfully for
many generations, but it is
apparent that we could benefit
by even greater attention to
educating some of our valuable
animals on how to eat.
The need is greatest with
weaner-sheep, which often die,
or at least decline badly,
because they will not go into a
stubble or eat supplementary
fodder.
For this reason it is always
wise to leave a few older sheep,
such as wethers, with the
youngsters, but other devices
can be used also. For instance,
sheep can be taught to eat
meadow-hay by getting them
used to an attractive supple-
ment such as lucerne first, and
gradually reducing the propor-
tion of it until the ration is
wholly meadow-hay.
Although molasses and salt
have been used to encourage
sheep to take silage, by far the
easiest and best method is to
mix oats with the ration for a
start. After a few days the
flock is eating-up the silage
which it would have rejected
before such teaching methods
were used.
When bringing sheep on to
a wholly grain ration, especi-
ally wheat, it is very important
to begin with a few ounces a
day and work up gradually
to the full amount. Under this
system, the animals can eventu-
“Having any success with your delta-wing type ?”
ally take a whole week’s
supply in one measure, whereas
much less than this would have
been fatal before the initial
teaching began.
For this reason it is wise to
begin handfeeding before the
need becomes urgent. Once
educated, the animals can take
the full ration as soon as it
is needed most.
Tobacco Research
“N.”: Less than five months
after the opening of C.5.1.R.0.’s
Tobacco Research Institute at
Tinaroo Creek, Mareeba (N.Q.),
its director, Dr. David Goodall,
is off on a tour of similar
research - institutions in 15
countries.
In staffing, appointments,
and salaries, the C.5.1.R.0.
show is streets ahead of its
local poor relation, the
tobacco-research station at
Parada, 20 miles south-west of
Mareeba. Parada is operated
by the Queensland Department
of Agriculture and Stock.
Far-northern State officials
are not happy about the great
contrast between the go-ahead
Commonwealth Institute and
their own show, started years
before. Money for both now
comes from the one barrel—
the Tobacco Industry Trust
Account. But C.5.1.R.0. seems
to have the key to the barrel.
No round-the-world trips for
Maury Finlay, officer-in-charge
at Parada. In the State set-up
every penny has to be counted.
It speaks volumes for the
tolerance of the State
researchers that relations
between the two staffs are so
good. State and Federal agri-
cultural scientists have only
recently begun regular seminars
to keep in touch as much as
possible with what’s going on
next door.
C.5.1.R.0. got results about
20 years ago at least, its
plant-pathologist H. R. Angell
did, by extreme persistence,
in the seedbed control of blue-
mould. Nothing much else has
been evolved since then of
great practical value ; certainly
no field-control of blue-mould.
Most blue-mould work in
the' far , north is now being
done by State plant-pathologist
Bill Pont, whose headquarters
are at Kamerunga horticultural-
research station, near Cairns.
Should Pont happen upon a
practical field-control of the
scourge, it will be interesting
to see if growers and manufac-
turers, who contribute to the
Industry Trust Account, insist
on Parada and allied State
instrumentalities becoming less
the Cinderellas of the industry.
C.5.1.R.0. is there, of course,
not to produce practical field-
advice for growers, but to
undertake basic research into
the tobacco-plant; and the
C.5.1.R.0. workers should not
be stampeded into switching
from their defined field.
All the same, the present
balance in fund allocation
seems a little uneven.
Silage Stores
“Kanva”: A feature of the
recent fodder - conservation
season has been not only the
amount of silage cut, but also
the many ways of storing it.
The pit remains supreme for
the drought-reserve, but the
stack, silo and bun have been
joined by the clamp for over-
head-storage.
Whereas the portable clamp
has its advantages for making
small stacks, which will be eaten
by the end of autumn, the
large, more permanent clamp is
just the thing where the game
is fully mechanised.
One grazier made his clamp
simply by pushing up two long
lines of earth and filling the
space between with chopped
silage. When feeding-out, a
front end-loader fills trailers,
which can be taken around the
paddocks in tandem behind a
tractor and their contents
spilled off where they are
-needed.
Weeding Onions
“Agricola”: Onions are a
paying proposition, but most
farmers shy off them because
they are so hard to keep free
of weeds.
The old business of weeding
by hand was a back-breaking
job, taking more labor than the
average farm could find.
Chemical weed-killers are
coming to the rescue. Trials
by the Queensland Department
of Agriculture have shown that
these preparations can reduce
hand-weeding to one very light
one.
Weed-killers can be used
before or after the onion- and


weed-seeds germinate. The
trials have shown that C.M.U.,
applied at the rate of no more
than Hlb. per acre, gives good
control of weeds for at least
four months. This preparation
is applied before the seeds
germinate, generally about two
or three days after planting. If
it is decided to spray for weeds
after the onions are above the
ground D.N.0.C., potassium-
cyanate, or P.C.P. may be
used.
In the trials, D.N.O.C. gave
good results when used at the
rate of 1 to lygals. per acre.
V. Wagner, chief agronomist
for the department, stated that
D.N.O.C. gave excellent weed-
control for three months, but it
was best to spray the young
plants when they were in the
3-to-4-leaf stage. This is
generally about six weeks after
they appear above the ground.
Wagner also advised spray-
ing first thing in the morning,
when the wind is calm.
Sulphate-of-ammonia must be
added to the spray. The
amount to add is shown' on the
label on the container.
Potassium-cyanate was used
at the rate of 10 to 151 b. to
the acre. The recommended
time for spraying is when the
plants are in the hook-stage,
about two to four days after
the seeds have peeped through
the ground. Best results were
obtained when the spray was
applied to moist soil. The
manufacturer supplies a wetter
with the chemical, to be used
if the earth is very dry.
In the trials a 2 per cent.
P.C.P. oil-emulsion spray gave
satisfactory results. It was used
when the young onion-plants
we,re in the 3-or-4-leaf stage.
Some farmers don’t favor this
preparation because it damages
the plants. However, it was
found that they recovered in a
matter of several weeks, and
the yield was the same as in
the other trials.
These chemical sprays will
kill all the common weeds
which make the onion-grower’s
life a misery. To get the best
results, the sprays should be
used when the weeds are very
small.
Balloon Barrage
“Blighty" : Balloons are
being tried in the Mildura
district to keep starlings away
from fruit. They cause about
£lO,OOO a year damage there.
Over Geoff Dowty’s property
at South Merbein birds have
been seen to veer away from
the vicinity of a sft.-diameter
balloon flying 40ft. above the
drying-rack. It is hoped that
the balloon will keep the birds
from attacking fruit on the
tiers.
Most starlings go to Mildura
from other areas during the
picking season. Blockies hope
that the balloons will keep the
birds at home.
Salt for Sheep?
“Bertie”: The old argu-
ment about whether sheep need
salt-licks is turning in favor
of a negative answer. “Sheep
need salt because they like it”
was never more convincing
than “Men need beer because
they like it,” and it is now
felt that if sheep get much
more than their daily need of
.|oz. a head of salt the mineral
could do them more harm than
good.
Improved-pasture, and, often,
natural waters, supply sheep
with all the salt they normally
need. One exception is when
“Here’s another good one I learnt in the Boy Scouts."
grain is being fed to flocks
Which have no access to
calcium-rich foods such - as
lucerne, good clover-hay or
burrs. In such cases, \\ per
cent. of ground-limestone
should be added to the ration.
One way of doing this is to
put the lime in a salt-lick.
Salt can also be used as a
“carrier” for other minerals,
such as cobalt, which are
known to be deficient in an
area. However, it is unwise
to feed minerals in this way
unless you are sure that there is
a deficiency.
On the other hand, salt is
needed for flocks and herds in
alpine country, where they
become “salt-hungry,” and
their craving for the mineral
can be used to advantage at
mustering.
Evicting Bees
“B-herd”: A surprising
number of bees live in human
dwellings. They elect to set up
business there because the
space between the weather-
boards and the inner lining is
secure, clean, warm and dry,
which is just about all a
swarm could wish for. Their
landlords are, for the most
part, unwilling and even down-
right hostile, but there’s not
much anyone caln do about
a swarm disappearing through
a crack in the champfer board
or a nail-hole in the fibro.
They stay on for years.
Crises in their wellbeing occur
at painting and renovating
times. As soon as the painters
become a nuisance to the bees
with their scrapers and sanding-
machines, the bees hunt them
and —unless a co-operative bee-
herd can be located —an effec-
tive stalemate is set up which
seems likely to go on for ever.
Bees behind fibro frighten
even a competent beeman.
More than one 700-colony
man has given up in despair,
and so lost his reputation,
chasing such swarms. If the
bees that have been cyanided
in their sleep could be resur-
rected and set on a stand they’d
gladden the heart of the
greediest apiarist in Australia.
However, like every touchy
job, a bit of intelligent thought
and a lot of know-how gives
the edge to the operator. First,
location: if a hive goes in at
x it doesn't necessarily follow
that the nest is at x. Quite often
the bees travel three or four
feet in any direction. Try and
get a direction from the workers
if the entrance allows it.
If the dwelling is fibro, place
an ear to the wall about where
you guess the cluster is, and
tap the wall sharply. If
you’re somewhere near, you’ll
hear the alarm note sounded by
the cluster. It’s slight you
must know what kind of a
sound you’re listening for —but
to the experienced ear it’s
definite.
With timber, the task is
easier. Take ar chance and
remove a board, and, if neces-
sary, look with a torch and a
mirror. Location made, the
next step is to expose the
cluster to manipulation. Sounds
easy, but here’s where they
reach for the cyno g a s.
Carpenters build houses to last
and opening-up sections is not
as easy as opening a tin of
jam. The operator must be
sure that when he opens-up
the colony he has scope to
control it.
If it’s otherwise, he finds the
bees' have moved through a
knot-hole or a crack in the
joists or any escape-avenue no
larger, possibly, than a bad
mortice, before he’s got the
job half-started. You can’t pull
down a house, the infuriated
owner plucking at your sleeve
the while, for a swarm of bush-
bees. Pass the gas.
Best place to tackle the hive
is from the inside lining. If
it’s masonite, remove the
coverstrips and lever the whole
section. Same applies to fibro.
Replacement is simple. Lining
boards delay the job. With the
cluster exposed, smoke quietly
and immediately size-up the
escape chances. Block every
outlet, no matter how small,
with bag or similar material.
Drive the- bees from the honey
gently and remove. Cut the
brood out and tie in empty
frames.
By this stage the bees will
have clustered if no escape
offers. Place the brood-frames
in the prepared hive-body and
with a billy-lid, or fruit-tin,
capture the bees. To the new-
chum it sounds dangerous, but
allowing gentleness to be the
guide, the job is fairly easy.
Working in a confined space
makes the job irritating.
Sometimes the bees won’t

cluster. If the operator strikes
this trouble—and it’s not un-
usual —he outsmarts the bees
by returning the brood-frames
to the approximate position
originally occupied by the
cluster. The space is confined,
but he needs to set three or
four combs back to allow
cluster-space. He then covers
the exposed area with a blanket
or whatever is handy and
knocks-off.
The bees will return over-
night and work over the brood-
combs. They will attach the
brood to the frames and the
queen will settle in laying. In
the morning the operator
merely lifts the frames out care-
fully, making sure not to dis-
lodge the clinging bees, and
places them in the hive. Give
them till evening to settle in,
and after dark remove to
distant locality.
A word to the beginner—this
first-location shift needs to be
two miles or more away, other-
wise the bees return to the
house and make war on every-
one. Later they can be moved
to any position. In the house
they were a nuisance, in a hive
in the garden they become a
never-ending source of both
pleasure and honey.
Misfletoe Hormone

lypts and associated species,

ferably after rain. November
and December are the best
months.
When applied at \ per cent,
strength, 2, 4-D kills the mistle-
toe without damaging the tree.
The spray is not suitable for
fodder-trees, including kurra-
jong and wilga.
Deep Litter
“Van”: Deep litter needs
attention for maximum benefit.
A common fault is to throw a
heap of sawdust into a shed
and let it take care of itself.
Opinions differ as to the best
way to build litter up. Some
experts favor the slow layer-by-
layer method, others are for
getting it in quickly. It depends
a great deal on the moisture-
content of the sawdust, but in
all cases lime is useful to take-
up moisture and sweeten the
litter.
We use deep litter for both
pigs and poultry—litter for the
pigs being 2ft. deep and for
poultry Ift. deep—and put the
sawdust into the house in one
operation. Lime is added fre-
quently, and forked-in. Lime
is not expensive and more than
repays the slight trouble of
putting it on.
Some farmers report poor
results with deep litter, their
animals being unhealthy and
unthrifty. It is possible they
have not used a depth of saw-
dust sufficient to absorb the
moisture and remain friable.
Failure to turn the litter fre-
quently can result in the litter
getting a hard crust and a sou r
smell.
In wet weather care should be
taken to lime any excessively
wet area and fork the area
over. It helpful to move
drinking- and feeding-vessels at
intervals, as this stops constant
compaction on the one spot.
Well-kept litter virtually
breathes life, and it is a healthy
and labor-saving way of rearing
stock in large numbers. Also,
from an animal-health point of
view, it is a fact that worms
are less active in deep litter than
they are in the ground.

North-west Queensland ridges
we have been using hexadecanol
(cetyl-alcohol) in rafts for
almost a year, and after a very
dry period we think its use is
effective. But, as in all new
ideas, some adjustments are
necessary. “Okie’s” shooters
are always with us traffic-
signs, telegraph-insulators and
the like are all targets for the
bloke with a rifle.
Shooting on conserved water
such as excavated dams or tanks
is a recognised bush sport, and,
in many cases, a necessity.
Nearly every dam I have seen
over a wide strip of Australia’s
hinterland has its population of
water-fowl. You usually see
that nuisance, the shag; a
long - necked, sharp - beaked,
crash-diving menace that takes
a mort of shooting. A few
ducks, and the usual clutter
of water-hens, plus an odd
pelican and that lively artful
dodger, the dab-chick.
The shooter’s eye is attracted,
to the raft where the shags, in
pairs, do their roosting and
digesting, which latter process
soon fouls the raft, and, in
course of time, builds a layer
of manure which must weight
the raft down more than cal-
culated by the makers.
Only a complete nitwit, one
imagines, would shoot at the
raft, so it seems fair to con-
clude that shots at the shags
are those which puncture the
raft. Those rafts equipped with
polythene - floats are not
affected, as there is no buoyancy
lost by a hole or two. The
fine nylon cord used to moor
rafts by some owners is a
danger to water-fowl and
carcasses of birds killed by the
cord must foul the water and
break the film of hexadecanol
on the water. We use a fin.
nylon rope, which can be seen
better than the fishing-line
cord.
The attention of makers is
called to the necessity to evolve
a raft which will prevent birds
roosting. One thinks that the
idea used by poultrymen on
their chicken-feeders would be
the easiest to adopt. This gadget
has a gable-roof with a roller
on the apex. Birds landing on
the roller just roll off, as there
is nothing they can grip. Over
to you, manufacturers.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(20/3/’58)
Heavy rain is indicated on the south coast of Queens-
land during April, with reasonably good rain 'occurring on
the balance of the coast. These rains may be associated
with cyclonic activity. The rest of Queensland may get
only light to moderate, patchy rains, poor in the west and
far south-west.
The north and central coasts of N.S.W. should receive
heavy rains during April, with reasonably good rain on the
south coast. These rains may be associated with cyclonic
activity and rough weather. Poor rain for other parts of the
State.
Apart from moderate rain in portion of the western
division, rainfall will probably be poor in Victoria during
April. However, good general rains should commence in
May, with heavier rains in June and July.
Rainfall probably poor in most of South Australia during
April, although moderate rain is likely in the lower north.
Good rains should occur in the agricultural areas during
May, with general rains in the whole of the State during
June.
General rains are indicated in Western Australia during
April, although the lower south coast may get only light
rain. Moderate to good rains are likely in the agricultural
areas during May.

Exhibits in the Arts and Crafts at the
Royal Easter Show were, in the majority
of sections, of high standard —in some,
extremely high; only in a few cate-
gories was there a falling-off, and in
these failure to achieve imaginative
design was the chief fault.
The cynosure was undoubtedly the
cake-icing and -decorating section, and
the attention it attracted was richly
deserved.
First-prize winner, Mrs. B. Chard,
contrived an exquisite creation; a
replica of a double-bed with gilt bed-
head and -feet, its pink quilted satin
carried a grey spread on which were
sprays of flowers in a petit-point design.
From beneath this peeped layers of white
lace-frill. A mat, complete with a cat
and bail of wool, and a bedside-chair
with an old lady sitting in- it completed
the ensemble.
Second prize went to Mrs. E. Lackey
ftjr her sq uare cake in two shades * of
green, which had sailing-craft on Sydney
Harbor as the chief motif; well-known
harbor landmarks were on each side,
making a charming effect. A round
cake with a beautifully neat bunch of
native-flowers on it gained third prize
for Mrs. M. J. Houghton.
Woollen knitteds showed more
imagination as to pattern than formerly,
the first-prize taker, Mrs. E. A. Boschen,
gaining nice effect with a very fine yoke
contrasting with an otherwise loosely-
knitted pink dressing-jacket. The
second-prize winner, Mrs. I. Unstead,
used a delicate mauve shade tastefully.
In the section exclusive to 60s-and-
over Mrs. J. Holland’s man’s grey sleeve-
less pullover gained top honors, with
Mrs. I. O. Wilcocks’s long-sleeved one
in blue-grey running a close second.
High-quality craftsmanship and up-
to-date designs distinguished the 2-ply
knitteds, in which Miss C. E. Wilsdon's
lady’s cardigan in a lovely tangerine
shade scored heavily.
Tapestries in wool were notable for
the wide variety of design and theme,
which, however, didn’t stop two com-
petitors from choosing the same
subject: Frans Hals’s “Laughing
Cavalier,” one of which, by Mrs. N. T.
Teasdale, was runner-up to Mrs. A.
Colter's well-balanced ballet-scene in
mauves, greens and browns.
One entry in the wool flower-rug sec-
tion was a replica of Sydney’s Opera
House-to-be —but it failed to take the
Judge’s eye. First prize went to a
contemporary design in white, tan-
gerine and black on a green background.
A feature of Miss C. Payne’s winning
in the silk-embroidery section was
the delicate scalloped buttonhole-work
a nd the rolled hem on her pure-silk
trousseau-set on which blue birds
fluttered.
Violets and gardenias seemed to be
the favorites among entrants in the
French - flower - making exhibits, the
standard ranging from the mediocre to
the superb. Mrs. M. Satow’s first prize
stood right out —a brilliant simulation of
cream carnations which had deep-red
serrated edges, and an exotic tiger-lily.
Embroidered linens generally showed
lack of adventure in design.
Today (April 2) at 5.45 p.m., wedding-
bells will peal for Judy Milner, only

St. John's Church, Wahroonga. Recep-
tion will be held at Girraween,
Killara. Before leaving Franks ton

father is a bank-manager, Judy was a
trainee-nurse; John is a dentist. The

“Easter Parade” was the appropriate
title for the display given by 1450 school-
girls, ranging in age from 11 to 14 (the
youngest performers in the nine years this
attraction has been featured) at the Show.
Once again Miss Jean Harte came up with
admirably-contrived routines and intri-
cate designs of streamer-weaving, which
somewhat astonishingly always goes off
without a seeable hitch. A medley of
Strauss waltzes —which lend themselves
perfectly to these effects —the “Washing-
ton Post” March, and the theme-tune of
the title, gave the well-disciplined girls,
with each group in different-colored
dresses, full scope for their rhythmical
movements and neat pattern-making.
Spectacle was raised in voltage with
the two torch-dances in the darkened ring
—an effect which always brings the house
down. But perhaps the most magical
effect of all was that gained by what
has now become established practice:
when, as a finale, all the lights are
quenched, and at a signal the giow from
countless matches and cigarette-lighters
from among the vast concourse joins with
that from the torches of the girls.

anything that’ll hold water.
Rouse the mob out —women
and kids and all —and start
’em bailin’. Tell ’em if they
don’t bail like hell we’ll sink.
That’ll cure their seasickness.”
TTNDER Tony’s frenzied
driving the passengers did
their poor best, but with hope-
lessly inadequate gear they
made little impression on the
inrush of water.
There was only one leaky
bucket aboard, and within an
hour it had been lost over-
board. Lofty didn’t even curse
the unfortunate native who
slipped and dropped it; he was
having difficulty in retaining
his own footing. The wind had
shifted to the south and was
now churning the ocean into a
confused jumble of breaking
seas.
Shortly before five the port-
engine cut out and a few
minutes later the starboard one
gave up the struggle. That,
Lofty knew, was inevitable
with the water rising steadily.
Engines couldn’t run sub-
merged.
No engines, no bilge-pump,
and the water pouring into
her! What a bloody mess!
Kimarau was* less than ten
miles away, but it might as well
have been fifty. Even if the
Barinda stayed afloat for a
few more hours the change of
wind would carry her far to
leeward of the island. She’d
pass more than five miles off
it, Lofty estimated, clinging to
the useless, bucking wheel for
support as the Barinda swung
broadside-on to the wind. God,
she could roll! Even with the
deadweight of water in her
she was dipping her gunwales
under.
Seas broke aboard and
crashed in a seething welter
clear across the reeling deck.
Hang on to something sub-
stantial or get swept over-
board! Get swept overboard
or go down with the ship!
Take your choice. There was
no other alternative, for even
if they managed to launch the
dinghy it wouldn’t last five
minutes in this sea. Besides,
it could only carry five people
in <jalm water, and there were
nineteen adults and quite a
bunch of kids on board.
The passengers had ceased
bailing and were now clinging
together in a screeching, panic-
stricken mob, the whole tangled
mass in danger of being hurled
or swept overboard.
“Break it up! Break it up,
you useless bloody galahs! ”
Lofty roared.
Clawing his way from one
hand-hold to another he kicked
and punched a semblance of
reason into the mass and
forced individuals to * haul
themselves into the meagre
shelter available. While their
strength lasted and while the
Barinda remained afloat they
would now be reasonably safe.
But how long would this
helpless wooden hulk stay
afloat? Would she settle down
until her deck was awash and
float indefinitely with only her
superstructure showing or
would she go right on down to
the bottom? Lofty didn’t
know. He wondered why Tony
had not come to his assistance
when he was fighting to restore
order, and it was some time
before he remembered kicking
his engineer into the shelter of
the deckhouse. If there were
degrees of terror among the
rabble on board, then the big
half-caste was certainly the
most terror-stricken of all.
Dragging himself back to
the wheelhouse Lofty noticed
that it was raining heavily.
Kimarau was blotted out and
they were alone in a grey
turbulence of breaking seas,
rolling sickeningly and drifting
away from their last hope of
shelter, towards one of the
emptiest stretches of ocean in
the South Pacific. Not one
island in their line of drift,
Lofty thought despondently.
Just miles and miles of
churned-up seawater with a few
hungry sharks waiting beneath
the waves.
Aloud he said, “You’ve had
a pretty fair spin so far, Lofty,
but it looks like you’ve ’ad it
this time, you and all them
poor boongs. Sooner or later
the old girl’s gonna sink and
then the sharks’ll ’ave a real
blow-out.”
lashing rain
and no easing of wind or
sea. No silent night this, but
a chaotic blackness filled with
the crashing of waves and the
creaking and groaning of the
waterlogged ship as she reeled
clumsily from the onslaught.
And drifting through all the
hideous racket came a weird,
crooning undertone, the united
moaning of the terrified
passengers.
Once, risking his life with
every move, Lofty worked his
way around them, cursing ones
he bumped into in the dark-
ness, yelling encouragement in
obscene pidgin at others. He
doubted whether his presence
registered with any of them,
so wrapped in their own misery
were they. Still, they were his
passengers and he must show
them he was doing his best
for them.
Twice he tried to check the
water-level in the engine-room,
but with the lighting-system
ruined he found it impossible.
In that noisome black cavern
he could only sense the huge
volume of water surging from
side to side as the Barinda
rolled. Impossible even to
distinguish its noises from the
crashing of the seas on the deck
overhead. To step down into
that seething cauldron was to
invite a broken limb as the
surge hurled him against one
of the many steel projections.
It might have been midnight
or it might have been much
later —he had no means of
telling the time —when Lofty
caught a glimpse of Something
far out to leeward. In a pale
shaft of moonlight filtering
through the clouds it looked like
distant palm-trees rising above
the waves. They vanished as
the light faded, showed up
again as it brightened momen-
tarily and then vanished again
behind the rain. But they
were palms! There could fie
no mistaking them in that
second beam of moonlight.
OTRIVING to visualise an
outspread chart, Lofty
suddenly yelled, “Muji! Muji,
by God!”
Lonely Muji Atoll, marked
"Is there one anywhere ?"


only as a dot on the chart, well
to the nor’-east of Kimarau!
No one visited it because it had
nothing to offer. Small, low-
lying and uninhabited, it did
not even boast an anchorage.
A single line of coconut-palms
struggled for existence along
its warped backbone and
beneath them a coarse creeping
grass strove to bind and retain
the white coral sand.
That was Muji Atoll,
regarded merely as a menace
to navigation, seen by few and
wanted by none.
Until now. Now it loomed
to Lofty as a heavenly strip of
solid land, something he had
given up hope of seeing again,
a wonderful exchange for a
sinking hulk. In his next
glimpse of it he judged it to be
directly to leeward, so that,
small as it was, the chances of
the Barinda piling-up on it
were more than fair.
With agonising slowness they
lurched towards it, until Lofty
could see the surf breaking on
the beach. His elation was
ebbing now as he watched the
line of drift sloavly change.
Clearly the current was taking
a hand, and under its influence
the Barinda would be swept
slowly but surely past the islet.
She would pass close, close
enough for a reasonably good
swimmer to make the beach,
and these islanders were
brought up in the water. Some
of the weakest might drown in
the heavy surf, but most of
them would struggle ashore. In
any case it was their only hope
of survival. * . Estimating the
distance, Lofty knew that if
he dived overbbard then he
could do it with ease. Work-
ing his way aft he again began
kicking his passengers into a
sense of awareness.
. “Up and over,” he yelled.
“Come on, swim for it.”
It was difficult to make them
understand, more difficult to
persuade them to leave their
doubtful safety and leap into
the angry sea. In desperation
he began dragging them to the
rail and pushing them over-
board.
It was work for a super-
man, but during this critical
period Lofty was a superman.
Groping in the reeling dark-
ness, working mainly by
instinct, he pulled and heaved
until he had dumped each
screaming burden over the
side. The last person Jo go
was his engineer.
Lofty didn’t realise who it
Was until he got the struggling
figure to the rail and heard the
agonised plea of, “No, Lofty,
no! Not me! Not Tony!”
Even in the darkness he
could see the white eyeballs
rolling in terror as the big
half-caste clung frantically to
the rail.
“You useless yella boong!”
Disgust and hatred revived
Lofty’s ebbing strength and he
lashed out savagely. The
smashing impact of his fist
drew a scream that died to a
splutter as Tony released his
grip and slid into the sea.
Gasping for breath, Lofty
groped his way along the deck,
satisfied himself that no one
was left, and dived overboard.
“TT all adds up,” Captain
A Fergusson told his brother
the evening the Administra-
tion launch returned from the
search.
“We picked up one survivor
on Muji Atoll and he was in a
bad way, physically and
mentally. They tell me he was
the Barinda’s engineer. Any-
way, he had great gashes all
over him from being flung on
the sharp coral by heavy surf,
and he was practically raving.
A lot of what he told us didn’t
make sense. He said the water
began pouring into the Barinda
so fast they couldn’t cope with
it. It swamped both engines
and left them adrift in what he
claims were the biggest seas
he’d ever seen.
“That, of course, was wild
exaggeration. He paints him-
self as the hero of the drama
and Lofty as the villain. Lofty,
he says, went stark, raving
mad, bashing and kicking his
passengers for no reason except
panic. Finally he hurled them
all overboard in mid-ocean.
Our dusky hero then dived to
the rescue. After spending
hours trying to support women
and children and watching them
drown one after another he was
eventually washed up on Muji.
“Believe as much as that as
you like. But I knew Lofty
well, and whatever his faults,
he didn’t lack guts. It’s my
belief that he sighted Muji that
night and did his best to save
his passengers by getting them
to swim for it. His methods
of persuasion may have been
rough, but at least they’d be
efficient.”
“Hold on a minute,” Alec
put in. “Why would he force
his passengers overboard when
the launch was in no danger
of sinking?”
“I’m coming to that. When
we got back we learned that
the authorities had beached the
Barinda and pumped the water
out of her. The only serious
damage they found was in the
discharge-pipe from the engine
cooling - system. Rust and
vibration had caught up with
it and it had broken off inside
the engine-room.
“You realise what that
means, don’t you? While the
engines were running they were
sucking seawater into their
cooling-systems and discharg-
ing it inside the ship instead
of overside. The bilge-pump
couldn’t cope with a flood like
that, but once the engines
stopped the big inrush of water
stopped, too. The only leaks
then would be the normal ones
of an old launch working in a
seaway, and as the sea eased
even they would take-up.
“You’re wondering why
Lofty or his engineer didn’t
spot the trouble. My guess is
that when he saw the water
surging about in the engine-
room the engineer lost his
head. It would look pretty
terrifying with the launch
rolling heavily, and the
engineer struck me as being a
big windbag.
“And as for Lofty, I’d say
he didn’t stop to investigate.
He’d recognised me on the
beach, and his mind was on a
weakness I had ordered him
to have repaired two years ago.
He assumed that he’d left the
repairs too long, that the
planking up for’ard had sprung
and there was nothing he could
do about it.
“In other words, his
conscience was troubling him.
I know mine was.”
HOSPITAL NIGHT
Years, and patience, and simple pain may leaven
Dry noncommittal plaster while the Cross hails heaven;
But the cry to the Father has accomplished nothing
at all.
Before this hour’s child old prophecy shakes his head.
Someone murmurs a little, dithers in bed:
Against that frail call
Are imminent the siege-works of a huge nightfall.
Trees, drawn up, rustle in the steep time of gloaming;
Crude green gathers itself to a darkness, dreaming
Of perished ice-world summers, of birds unwieldy and
tame.
Darkness is astir, pondering, touching
Kingship with the first Dark in a trunk’s crouching.
Darkness lays claim
To the plight of an age, limbs and travail and name.
Someone calls again in his sleep, and my thought is
pain,
Pain, till chanticleer will carol truce again
To the faceless joustings of green and green by an
old cell,
With time roundabout, and laboring shapes of sin;
To the knotted fists of lightning, or tilting rain;
To the wind’s lapse and swell
—Old diehards of whom the birds shiver to tell.
They have taken down the day’s wasted extended light
But now a star is uttered in the long night,
Pitched beyond cabals of storm and freebooting tree.
For these, isled upon centuries, are murmuring,
murmuring ever
Of good or evil becoming a darkness; but never
Darkens this free
And ruminant glitter of star and memory.
It is timeless, the star. It is you, my father, beloved
friend,
Come to me in the guile and darkness of a day’s end,
As a lonely intense blue burning, near nor far.
The stone is rolled up: too early yet to say
Whether a darkness is decision or rises the day;
But out of war
I labor, breathing deeply, and wander towards your
star.
England.
FRANCIS WEBB.


behind, with his name carved on the
hilt, to be souvenired by the Mayor of
Bardia; the names of NX40557 E. J.
O’Donnell, Emmaville, and J. Hoare,
9 Div. Petrol Co., and NX27914 S.
Cruickshank, Orange, still decipherable
on the walls of a wrecked building in
the Piazetta Ammiraglio Aubry in
Tobruk; the proud legend, among other
faded names on the same wall, that
“Selley Was Here”; a cellar full of
wine in Derna, unaccountably over-
looked by the conquerors; the story of
a Major Jordan, still remembered by
the Greeks who fed and sheltered him
for two years; and, in many ways the
liveliest relic of the lot, a person named
Bill who, after the collapse of the
Greek campaign, married the farmer’s
daughter at the place where he had
been sheltering and subsequently
inherited the farm —the locals know
that he has had some connection with
Australia but think of him as a Greek.
Further, beyond the relics, the
journey gives the author the oppor-
tunity to recall some of the battles,
great and small, and, particularly, to
retell the exploits of the V.C.s Kibby,
Gratwick, Gurney, Edmonson, of
Tobruk, and, in Syria, Gordon and
Cutler —those incredible stories of men
who walked through massed machine-
gun fire as lesser men might walk
through a hailstorm.
And further, there is, of course, the
opportunity for ordinary travel-writing:
the sights of Egypt, such as they are;
the enviable discovery of a great deal
of sin in Rome, where the present
reviewer could never find anything but
art-galleries; an equally surprising
sojourn among the Mafia in Sicily; and
a visit to the Australian writers George
Johnston and his wife, Charmian Clift,
on their remote Dodecanese island.
Altogether, because of the scarcity
of relics, it makes rather a thin book;
but one which, nevertheless, will be
agreeable reading for any Australian
and almost compulsory for those who
knew the Middle East when the battle-
fields were not so quiet.
T. S. Eliot Essays
T. S. Eliot’s new collection of
essays, On Poetry and Poets (Faber),
shows how the most brilliant and
severe of critics may not escape the
malice of time.
“I can never bear to reread my
own prose-writing,” he says, in his essay
on Yeats; but every now and then
he remembers, or someone reminds
him of, something he has said:—
I remarked many years ag0....
that “In the seventeenth century a
dissociation of sensibility set in
and this was due to the influence
of Milton and Dryden”.... .but I now
incline to agree with Dr. Tillyard
that to lay the burden on the
shoulders of Milton and Dryden
was a mistake.
Then again, one remembers a refer-
ence somewhere in his “Selected
Essays” to “the science of criticism”;
but here, without reference to previous
statements, he says:—
We are in danger even of
pursuing criticism as if it was a
science, which it can never be.
And the wheel has indeed come full
circle when we find T. S. Eliot con-
cluding:—
These last thirty years have been,
I think, a brilliant period in literary
criticism in both Britain and
America. It may even come to
seem, in retrospect, too brilliant.
Who knows?
But it must not be supposed that
the new essays are less admirable than
the old, less the best in their field
today. The old wit is there with its
flashes of insight, as in “What Is
Minor Poetry?”:—
It isn’t that I need time to make
up my mind: I need time in order to
know what I really felt at the
moment.
Or on Byron:—
... . with all bis bogus diabolism
and his vanity of pretending to
disreputability he is genuinely super-
stitious and disreputable.
Some of these essays are already
well known: those on Virgil in “What
Is a Classic?” and on “Poetry and
Drama.” There are two on Milton;
one on Dr. Johnson as critic and poet;
and on Yeats’s less-pleasant poems
being his most pleasing; and he has
resuscitated from 1926 an essay in
which he resuscitated Chief Justice Sir
John Davies, who died in 1626. It
is puzzling to find Sir John in this
company until one sees the answer in
the footnote; time and again in his
prose you find Eliot printing some
reference that will tell you where he
got one of his poems; in this case, a
few lines by old Sir John:—
And if though, like a child, didst
fear before,
Being in the darke....
remind him of nine lines of Dante;
and it is to the footnote-translation of
Dante, one suspects, that we are
indebted for republication of the
complete essay:—
From his hands who fondly loves
her ere she is in being, there issues,
after the fashion of a little child
that sports, now weeping, now
laughing, the simple, tender soul . . .
Or, as Eliot puts it himself, in his
poem “Animula”: —
Issues from the hand of God the
simple 50u1.....
Away From It All
Mermaid Singing (Michael Joseph)
is the narrative, impressionistic and
gracefully-written, of how two young
Australian journalists (Charmian Clift
and her husband, George Johnston),
“despairing about the treadmill of
Fleet Street and the impossibility of
finding time for creative writing,”
suffocated by the fog in the Bayswater
Road and depressed by the English
winter, uprooted themselves and their
two young children and fetched up on
Kalymnos, a little-known island in the
Dodecanese Archipelago (chosen
because of a chance encounter with a
friend who was presenting a 8.8. C.
feature on this island).
It was no lotus-eating sojourn, for
they worked six days a week on their
novel; and it was certainly no idyll,
for Kalymnos is bare and impoverished,
relying solely on sponge-fishing for its
livelihood —a hazardous, often tragic,
occupation on the part of some 1500
out of a total population of 14,000.
They had come to Kalymnos “to
seek a source, or a wonder, or a sign,
to be reassured in our humanity.” This
was the reaction, expressed by one of
the “lt seems
funny to these fellers here. All these
fellers here don’t want nothin’ but to
get away. They all want to get to
Australia Ain’t nothin’ here but
sponges, Mister George.” Workers in
Australia, they recounted with amaze-
ment, had four meals a day, not one.
Despite troublesome beginnings, they
stayed and quickly made friends. It
is a man’s world on Kalymnos (though
property descends through the female
line) with the women in seemingly
perpetual childbirth; tlie sexes are
segregated from a veyy early age; the
moral code is severe and rarely broken;
and the religion not only is all-
pervading but also embraces rites and
incantations that have been carried
over from pagan times.
Joyce's Problem-children
Of A Census of Finnegans Wake, by
Adaline Glasheen (Faber), Richard
Ellman says in a foreword: —
Joyce is quoted as having asked
of his readers only that they devote
their lives to reading his works. The
Glasheen “Census” may enable them
to spend less than a lifetime in
comprehending “Finnegans Wake.”
And indeed it looks pretty complete.
It begins with a section-by-section
synopsis of the action; then a tabula-
tion of “Wbp Is Who When Every-
body Is Somebody Else”; and then it
becomes a 146-page dictionary of
names used in the book, with some-
thing about them, under which are
printed the variants into which Joyce
tortured and punned upon them, set


THE SCHOLARLY MOUSE and Other Tales
by Dal Stivens
This new collection of Dal Stivens offers a wide variety of tales and stories.
Some about animals and some about humans ; some are tall tales with
that special fantastic brand of humour which made The Gambling Ghost and
Ironbark Bill so popular ; in others we come back to reality with serious and
light-hearted stories about everyday life. 15/- (post Id.)

against the page-numbers and lines of
their appearance in the book (Is there
only one edition? No special edition
is specified).
Take the Dublin brewer-family of
Guinness; on different pages, from 4
to 621, Joyce has Guenesis, Guinnghis
Khan, Guineas, Ser Artur Ghinis,
Arthurgink, Everguin’s, juinnesses,
guidness....
Shem and Shaun rate almost two
pages of comment and reference; so
does Issy, Anna Livia’s daughter, a
combination of Isabel and Isolde;
Anna Livia herself has more than
three pages.
The dictionary also prints the ballad
of Finnegan’s Wake; Finnegan, it
seems, was a hod-carrier who got tipsy,
and “fell from the ladder and broke
his skull”: —
They tied him up in a nice clean
sheet,
And laid him out upon the bed,
Wid a gallon of whisky at his feet,
And a barrel of porter at his head.
His friends assembled at his wake.
Missus Finnegan called out for
lunch:
At first they laid in tay and cake,
Then pipes and tabaccy and whisky
punch....
Then Peggy O’Connor took up the
job,
“Arrah, Biddy,” says she, “yer
wrong, I’m sure.”
But Biddy gave her a belt in the gob
And laid her sprawling on the
flure....
After which Finnegan is splashed with
whisky thrown about in the ruction,
and rises from the dead . . .
Anyway, it looks as though there
will be less excuse, now, for anyone
not understanding this most difficult
of books.
Reviewed Briefly
Brunning’s Australian Gardener,
revised by Ernest E. Lord, has been
republished by Robertson and Mullens
in its 34th edition: which is quite a
number of editions. It runs to 500
pages, has a new set of illustrations,
deals with flowers, shrubs, trees and
vegetables, includes native plants and,
in short, will do very nicely.

Boys’ Book of Flight: David le Roi
(Iliffe). With an introduction by Peter
Twiss, the fastest man in the world
(1132 m.p.h.). Nothing fuddy-duddy
about this book; about the oldest plane
m it is a Comet, and it works on
through P.l twin turbo-jets and
crescent-wing four-jet bombers to the
latest in helicopters and French Atar
Volant P-2’s that go straight up; flying
filling - stations, rockets and even
satellites—of which a picture is shown,
published before news of sputnik’s
successful launching. The section-
drawings of a Rolls-Royce turbo-jet,
etc., are calculated to send the young
(and old) pop-eyed.

My Game: Lew Hoad, with Jack
Pollard (Hodder and Stoughton).
Hoad’s life-story, from babyhood
through to his second victory at
Wimbledon (1957) and his turning
professional straight after. There it
ends, apart from the concluding
chapters of hints on the game. An
absorbing book for everyone interested
in tennis, with Hoad, of course, almost
all the time on the book’s centre-court.
A few points emerge from the story:
(1) that Hoad is an exceptionally fine
tennis-player—though that was known
before; (2) that he, or his collaborator,
is rocky on proper-names—Dr. Skougal
for Scougall, the Sydney specialist,
Frankstown for Frankston, suburb of
Melbourne, Alrick Mann for Man,
former U.S. captain, etc.; (3) that he is
big enough still to acknowledge the
help he got on his way uo from
groundsman Aub (“Griffo”) Griffiths
and tramguard Joe Harris, his early
mentors; and (4) that Hoad takes Hoad
just a little bit too seriously.

New reprints of classics include
Boswell’s Journey of a Tour to the
Hebrides (which is just about the best
of Boswell, clear, gay and full of
movement) in Everyman’s Library;
and Conrad’s Almayer’s Folly and Last
Essays (in remarkably readable type
for such a packed volume) in the
Nelson Classics.

Scottish Short Stories: edited by
Fred Urquhart (Faber). This replaces
a previous selection. The best here is
probably R. B. Cunningham-Graham’s
“Beattock for Moffat,” in which a sick
Scot is being taken from London by
his brother and Cockney wife to die in
Scotland; the wife and brother talk
about the beautiful new hearse across
the sick man dozing in the train . . .
Edward Gaitens is very good on the
party to welcome home the ship's
steward; Orgill Mackenzie makes a
very sensitive picture of birth, marriage
and death in a farming community;
Robin Jenkins leaves an impression of
impressionist painting in the bright
colors of “Flowers”—the little girl, the
heather, the drowned airmen. In
“Smeddum” Lewis Gibbon shows a
tough widow’s way with her family,
and in “Jenny Stairy’s Hat” Margaret
Hamilton has a clear vision of the
wasted life of a charwoman. But the
big names, Linklater, Cronin and
Buchan, are a disappointment, maybe
because the other stories, though they
are mostly sketches, are so much less
commercial.
* * * *
Thoughts in the Wilderness: J. B.
Priestley (Heinemann). Essays
reprinted from “The New Statesman,”
in which the author says that he is in
the political wilderness, neither Left
or Right; advocates (“partly for devil-
ment”) matriarchy as a form of gov-
ernment; criticises Billy Graham as “a
typical clean young American who
drinks his orange-juice and coffee”;
notes that the English are at the mercy
of TV and other forms of mass-
suggestion ; and reproves Dr. Lea vis
for criticising Fielding, Lytton Strachey
and J. B. Priestley.
* * * *
Gulbenkian: John Lodwick (Heine-
mann). A biography of the oil-
millionaire, “Mr. Five Per Cent.,”
concocted by a novelist from the
recollections of his secretary. Anybody
who was “the richest man on earth”
can hardly fail to be interesting, but it
must be said that, popping in and out
of Lodwick’s wordy prose like a jack-in-
the-box, Gulbenkian as a living human
figure remains as much a mystery here
as ever. The reader who can dive
through fifty fathoms of fluff will
discover a few strange, submarine
events.

Who'll be the bunny this Easter?
Highways and byways will again be jammed this Easter,
with happy families off for a few day’s fun. Little will
they think of the traps that are waiting for them. Man-
made hazards like level crossings, soft edges, narrow
bridges and dangerous curves.
Last Easter, one person died on Australian roads
every 3 hours and someone was injured every 9
minutes. Not all these people were victims of bad
roads. But let’s face it - our roads are studded
with death traps, and people will die until we do some-
thing constructive about it.
What Australia needs is a bold national roads
programme. We have the engineers, the manpower and
all the requirements to build first class roads. There’s
urgent need for an Australian National Roads Authority
to co-ordinate the plans of existing State and local
government road-making bodies.
Good roads don’t cost they pay !
When you think of
better roads, think of
the big yellow machines
that help build them.
