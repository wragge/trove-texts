THE CASTLE OF CARRICKFERCUS.
“ Time’s gradual touch
Has mouldered into beauty many a tower,
which when it frown’d with all its battlements
was only terrible.” —MASON.
CJITUATED on an isolated rock in Belfast Lough, Carrickfergus
° Castle is said to derive its name from Feargusa, or Fergus, who
was lost in this vicinity some two thousand years ago. This
twelfth-century stronghold is one of Ireland’s best-preserved relics
and is on a site which has been fortified since the time of the
Dalaradians, and has consistently occupied a prominent position
in the annals of the country. Carrickfergus Castle was built by
the celebrated John de Courcy in 1178, under a grant from Henry
11. From the ancient nearby township of Carrickfergus came the
father of Andrew Jackson, President of the United States. The
elder Jackson emigrated in 1765 and founded a farm in the
wilderness of North Carolina.

SITWELL AND FLAGG.
Two autobiographies, one English, one
American —The Scarlet Tree, by Osbert
Sitwell, and Roses and Buckshot, by
James Montgomery Flagg—show a
variation in national outlooks that no
entente cordiale may Dnclge. Hie /Ameri-
can viewpoint may understand and even
accept the English outlook; under no
terms will the English outlook ever
accept or understand the American. %
This is Sitwell’s second volume of
memoirs and he has now reached the age
of nine. But the tempo of the writing
is so slowed down by a meticulous
stylism that time factors become slightly
confused. If a writer insists on record-
ing every chocolate given him by his
grandmother, one’s interest in the nicety
of the recording is apt to go a little flat.
To be sure, the grandmother herself
is well drawn, as are the portraits of
various aunts and the writer’s father
and mother, but the writer himself, as a
small boy, evades presentation. The
careful stylism overlays its subject matter.
One is not reading about a small boy
of nine, but about a middle-aged literary
man’s re-creation of such a lad, and I
submit that maturity’s effort to recon-
struct the mental states of its nonage is
always false and not very interesting.
That is why stories of suffering childhood
are the most obnoxious of literary exer-
cises. We can get at the boy only tnrough
a record of his actions, and at the man
on what selection of those actions his
memory stored away. Sitwell presents
himself as a very sensitive small boy
terrified of the dark and tormenting him-
self with fears of hell, k but the wilful
evocation of fear as a pleasurable thrill
is normal in all childhood.
It is only when an action is recorded
that we get a hint that Osbert Sitwell was
a rather spoilt and self-willed young
brat, and to be commended, autobio-
graphically, as such. His father, it is
revealed to us, had a trick chair made
which collapsed when anyone sat in it,
and precipitated the sitter on the floor.
Having marked his father prepare this
chair for a visitor, Osbert secretly
changed, chairs-, so that his father crashed
on his backside to the 'diversion of all
present. A worthy retort on the dynastic
potency of a father, and well worth re-
cording; but, with one or two hints of
the like nature, that is all we get of
Osbert as a boy.
I do not quarrel with Osbert Sitwell's
carefully modulated style. But a false
quantity is immediately apparent in re-
lating that style to Sitwell’s outlook on
art generally, which is utterly at variance
with both his own art and his outlook on
life itself. He professes the creed of the
ultra-modernist, and has approval only
for such preposterous clowns as Picasso,
Modigliani, Cocteau and the like, and
can puff on record Cocteau’s absurd
caption on Stravinsky’s “Le Sacre de
Printemps” as “one of the noblest events
in the annals of art.”
Yet Sitwell’s own work, with its precise
attention to detail, its careful presenta-
tion of background and personality, the
fidelity with which even a strawberry is
placed before the reader’s eyes, is directly
derivative from the art of such painters
as Frith, Augustus Egg, Martineau and
the early Millais— l an art which, in spite
of the sentimentality of much of its sub-
ject-matter, was built on a sound tradi-
tion of picturemaking, and which will be
“revived” and studied by the studio world
.once it has struggled out of its present bog
of primitivism. Osbert Sitwell’s values
in present-day art are those that are be-
ing parroted in every little group of
splodgers in every large city of the world,
and are therefore not the evidence
of an exclusive taste in Osbert Sitwell,
but are merely a flaccid subjection to the
mob movement of his decade in art.
Fj om Osbert Sitwell’s modulated prose,
good as it is, one turns to James Flagg’s
personal narrative with the sense of hav-
ing got out of a .slightly mouldering Eng-
lish country house into the violence and
coloi and action of the whole American
scene; into that restless vitality which is
today the world’s energy centre. And
whereas I had been dipping into Osbert
Sitwell’s work at leisured intervals, I had
to read Flagg’s book at a sitting. It
tells an intimate personal story of the
writer’s life, it covers an immense number
of personalities, and is told with that
compactness of phrase in which statement
also conveys opinion and analysis. As
an example: ,
My sister Margaret, for whom I hadn’t
the slightest use, was a beautiful and utterly
selfish typical American girl. She married
a couple of Englishmen. One was a good-
looking rotter, a Cambridge man, rich and
very smart. He had never packed "a suit-
case or ridden in a bus in his life. Mar-
garet explained that he was round-
shouldered as the result of driving a car
all the time. She divorced him for excel-
lent reasons but she had to oe slapped in
the presence of the butler besides. That
was the law then. I think A. P. Herbert
had the English divorce laws made a spot
less medieval at a later date.
Pondering the methods of these two
autobiographies, 1 am convinced that
recording the episode is the only way of
bringing the event or the personality
starkly in front of the reader. No precise
analysis of motives can convey the reality
of an event with the precision of its bare
statement, as witness the two great masters
of self-revelation, Pepys and Boswell.
You don’t need to read a laborious bio-
graphy of Sir William Penn to find out
what sort of man he was when Pepys can
present him to you life-size in a para-
graph ;
drank some brave wine and then
homewards again and in our way met with
two country fellows on one horse, which I
did, without much ado, give way (o, but
Sir W. Penn, would not, but struck them,
and they him, and so passed away, but
they giving him some high words, he went
back again and struck them off their horse
fn a simple fury, and without much honor,
m my mind.
Style, as a conscientious literary exer-
cise, is apt to impede the revelation of
an actuality. It gets between the reader
and the event recorded. A carefully-
painted academic portrait can never con-
vey the salient characteristics of a per-
sonality the way a swift and possibly
malicious pencil sketch may do.
And James Flagg, as an artist, can
practise both methods with a perfect
control of his medium. Flis portrait of
Use Hoffmann is a finely-handled piece
of brushwork, sure in its translation of
form and textures and the spacial depth
of its background ; a graceful and charm-
ing presentation of a desirable girl, and,
in a certain brooding intensity of her
eyes, strangely prophetic of the girl who
was later to end her life with a dose of
cyanide of potassium. From the sus-
tained concentration of a finished paint-
ing Flagg can turn to the masterly chalk
study of Frank Crowninshield, or the
satanically ruthless quick pencil sketch
of Albert Dome. And for autobio-
graphical purposes, the sketch of Dome is
the right medium.
Flagg uses words with just as much
assurance to convey a candid portrait:
A 1 Dome commenced his warm toler-
ance of me by hating my guts, A 1 is a
ferocious-looking man, five-ten by five-ten,
Man Hill if not Man Mountain. He looks
like the spirit of Westbrook Pegler, only
more kindly, like a pirate of the Spanish
Main. He is black and hairy, like a pros-
perous tarantula. He has so many underlid
eyelashes that his eyes look upside down.
... .A 1 Dome is a good man, but by
Godfrey, he doesn’t look it. If you sud-
denly met him in an alley full of barrels
on a dock at three a.m., and a ray of
light flashed on his face three feet away,
you would say to yourself “This is it,” and
faint.
I had the pleasure of meeting James
Flagg briefly while in America, and I
regret constantly that I did not see more
of him, for I liked him on sight and had
always greatly admired h'is power as a
portrait draughtsman. I found, meeting
him, that he had that personal quality
which, as a people, only Americans pos-
sess as a national asset —the power to
communicate their personalities with ease,
with frankness, without affectation, and
without any consciousness of doing so.
It is something they do as naturally as
breathing and which makes for the most
charming of all ,social virtues.
I believe this to be the great idiosyn-
cratic variation between Englishmen and
Americans, for just where an Englishman
shuts up like a clam the American most
frankly opens out the revelation of his
being. And James Flagg’s autobiography
exemplifies this national quality of
mind to perfection. It is frank over
the presentation of friends and the con-
flict of personality, and it handles that
most difficult of all personal revelations,
the intimate complexities of a love affair,
with perfect taste, and without a hint of
conscientious exhibitionism. As a tech-
nical achievement, the autobiography is
told with the same sure and vigorous
touches which are the masterly quality
of Flagg’s portrait studies.

"Ships and Men."
In Ships and Men (Harrap) W, J.
Bassett-Lowke and George Holland sub-
mit an unorthodox note on transporta-
tion: —
In the early days transportation was a
highly-valued privilege and was carried out
with *a surprising measure of kindness, con-
sidering the age. It was a protest against
the brutal laws which provided the death
penalty for everything and as a rule was
only awarded after a strong appeal. Later,
of course, it became terrible, mostly
through the brutality of the men who ad-
ministered it, not the system itself.
There is a brief reference to Captain
Cook, a still briefer to Tasman; but
otherwise astonishingly little of special in-
terest to Australia and New Zealand. The
book is “a record of man’s sea-goings,
from the first fearful launchings of the
coracle down to our day of ‘all civilisa-
tion clamped down in a vast steel shell’
—the Queen Elizabeth,” and among the
chapters on the great navigators one
would have expected more on the
Spanish who approached Australian
waters, and something, surely, about the
great canoe voyages of the Maoris to
New Zealand. The book, surprisingly dry
for such a wet theme, is cramped—too
limited in scope, too bare in detail.
Still, it is interesting as far as it goes.
At least in outline it tells the history of
navigation from the earliest times, and
the informative account of the changes in
the design of ships—from Greek and
Roman times to the sailing ships of
the Elizabethans and the modern liner
—is illustrated by fascinating sketches
and photographs of ship models.
An item of news:
An international tribute is now planned
in the form of a great Memorial to Chris-
topher Columbus, which is to be built on
the island .territory of the Dominican Re-
public near the first settlement of the Euro-
pean in the New World. The winning de-
sign in an open competition, in which 450
architects from 48 countries submitted
drawings, is by Joseph Lea Cleave, now
head of the Architectural School in the
Edinburgh School of Art. The scale model
shows an immense structure, cruciform in
plan, a mile in length, and massive in its
masonry, set in a great park which will
occupy 2000 acres. In its central chapel
the honored bones of Columbus will be
enshrined. Above, shining its|beams from
a revolving beacon over the waters of
the ocean which he crossed, the light on
the tower will be a symbol of the illumina-
tion of his discovery in a world darkened
by ignorance and superstition.
On the whole, it seems that the monu-
ment will be on a somewhat grander
scale than the terracotta statue of Cap-
tain Cook that stands so forlornly behind
its iron railings opposite the picture
theatre at Randwick, Sydney.
BECALMED.
Above and below the ship, this blue:
No cloud, no island, and which of two
Suns was celestial, submarine?
Each sailor shrugged. Who’d ever been
South of the Line... who knew .... who
knew?
There was a vessel in the sky —
Towering above, or below the eye?
If only something would drift past,
Seaweed or cloud to foul its mast.
Why should it, too, becalmed thus, lie?
Below and above, the seeming sea
Like a great, eye which dreamily
Sees nothing, and by nothing is seen ;
A waking that may t may not, have been.
Which of us now is you, is me?
Everything double under the sun ;
And doubly doubled to choose which one
Is under which, which one above.
“God, if the counterpart would move.”
But movement there or here is none.
“Silver’s a man is full of cunning;
Monkey, he is on the taffrcdl running;
Agile, he props and dives right in.
One rises to meet him with a grin.
Head strikes head with a smack that’s
stunning.
“No more Silver, he’s under the sea;
Or up in the sky, or where is he?”
QUEENSLAND.
Lost in the ether, south of the Line;
The eight bells rang, but we heard nine:
And where are we, and where are we?
Lord, it is dark. The two suns met
In a blaze of flame we won't forget:
And which ate which, we could not say ;
But night came on and at close of day
We cheered “All’s not proved double
yet.”
Too soon, too soon! The moon that
rose
Split into two, like silver shoes:
One walked the sky, one walked the sea;
But which walked which was strange to
me:
For south of the Line, who knows...
who knows?
“This is the other half,” I said.
“Since Egypt, here they’ve buried the
dead.
Under the earth and south of the Line.”
The eight bells rang and we heard nine.
“We are they whom the mermaids wed.”
Doomed on a ship that is dead,
becalmed;
In a winding sheet of blue, embalmed.
“Friend, it is doubly strange I feel.
No one will credit our plight was real;
‘A trick,’ they’ll say, ‘These men were
palmed.’ ”
F. JOHN BLIGHT.
Lines of Communication.
In The Thin Red Lines (Standard Ar
Book Co.) Charles Graves endeavors to
make a connected story out of the entries
in an official Cable and Wireless war
diary. Even though it deals with a highly
technical business with a peculiar
language of its own, his narrative is ex-
citing, and pretty well substantiates the
claim made in the opening chapter:
Without Cable and Wireless, the Big Three
could never have encompassed the de-
struction of the Axis. World War II was
fought at breakneck speed. Momentous
campaigns were completed in six weeks.
More miles were covered by advancing and
retreating armies than ever before in history.
All which was largely due to the immensely
stepped-up speed of communications —radio
being essential for the tactical handling of
troops and cables for strategy.
As it is primarily concerned with send-
ing telegrams, the Cable and Wireless
diary proudly records than in 1945,
amidst all the chaos, it transmitted more
than 720,000,000 words on its sensitive
apparatus, as against 231,000,000 words
in an average peace year.
During the war 10,000 men and women
of 57 different races, working in more
than 70 countries and on the seven
oceans, maintained the 355,000 miles of
Imperial Cable and Wireless systems.
There were 155,000 nautical miles of
submarine cables, 150 wireless circuits
and 200 stations which had to be kept in
touch with one another. Dozens of re-
pair ships were obliged to present sitting
shots for submarines while they mended
broken and cut cables. Miracles of im-
provisation were performed at places as
far apart as Ascension, Malta, Mauritius,
Cyprus, Jamaica, Cocos and Porthcurno
in Cornwall, while in places like Casa-
blanca managers had to be ready to
spread their wings if the political situa-
tion altered.
These events were all duly recorded in
the war diary kept at official headquarters
at Electra House in London until it was
bombed out of existence and the control
centre shifted elsewhere. Then Pearl
Harbor happened. Singapore’s last words
were transmitted, the “Nothing More”
signal came from Java, and in a few
short weeks the companies’ Far Eastern
system had contracted to Darwin, where,
it is recorded, after the first air raid
“amid all the wreckage and destruction
the glass siphon of the recorder instru-
ment [to Java] was still hanging un-
broken on its fibre attached to the silk
thread, though severed from its alu-
minium cradle.”
Cocos Island had led a charmed life.
A Japanese bomber blew the station to
perdition, but the staff had reserve equip-
ment and an underground shelter which
filled with water when the tide rose on
the shallow islet, and a few hours later
were talking again to Melbourne. Lon-
don H.Q., knowing that the Japs would
intercept it, then sent a radio message to'
Batavia to the effect that the staff at
Batavia were to destroy their instruments
because Cocos had been permanently put
out of action. A few hours later the
Cocos men were cheered by hearing
Tokyo Radio jubilantly reporting that
the island had been split in two ; the
station continued to carry the bulk of
the Australian traffic right up to the
surrender.
When the tide turned the companies
hastened after the advancing forces in
Italy, Greece and France with a special
Blue Train so that eminent correspon-
dents could file their dispatches in time
for the first editions and relatives could
be informed of the safety of their sons
and husbands in p.-0.-w. camps. One
hundred and fifty youngsters fresh from
school were trained in Australia, New
Zealand and Britain to man recaptured
stations in the Far East. Liberated
p.-0.-w. and civilians were allowed to
send free messages to their relatives all
over the world.

History, Heritage and Environment:
H. B. McNicol (Faber). Chiefly for
schoolteachers. The author thinks that
history, as at present taught, is non-
sensical and suggests a remedy. His
syllabus for secondary schools would
run from pre-history and Greece and
Rome, in the first year to “the political
machine,” finance, trade, the Empire, the
two Great Wars v etc., in the fifth year.

The mightiest rampart ever built by man, the Great Wall of
China, has stood guard over this ancient land for over 20
centuries, winding its way 1,500 miles over mountains and plains.
Begun in the year 214 8.C., it stretches along the north-western
boundary of China, and was intended as a barrier against invasion.

What member of Parliament introduced the
Bill for the abolition of capital punishment in
Queensland? When was it passed and what
was the voting? Did it go before the Upper
House ?
It was first introduced in 1916 by J. A.
Fihelly, Minister without portfolio in the Ryan
Ministry. The bill passed its second reading
in the Leg. Assembly by 37 to 14. The motion
for its second reading in the Leg. Council was
negatived on the voices. The Bill was again in-
troduced in 1922 by J. Mullan, Attorney-General
in the Theodore Ministry, passed its second
reading in the Assembly by 33 to 30, and was
assented to on July 31, 1922. There was no
Leg. Council on the second occasion.

Particulars of the Sacco-Vanzetti case?
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, two
Italians, were in 1921 found guilty of the
murder of a paymaster at South Baintree,
Massachusetts, U.S.A., in April, 1920. The
verdict was disapproved by many who bejieved
the men had been unjustly sentenced owing to
their radical political views, and, a new trial
having been refused, postponement of execution
was secured and the case carried to Governor
Fuller, who in 1926 appointed a committee to
investigate the matter. The committee’s de-
cision was that they had received a fair trial,
and the two men were executed in Charlestown
prison on August 23, 1927.

How can I identify the spotted diamond-bird,
and what are its habits?
It is small and active, colored black and
buff, patched with red and yellow, and with
little white spots. Its loud, monotonous call,
resembling “sleep, baby,” is commonly heard
in Southern Australia. It lives on insects. Tun-
nelling into a bank, it builds a domed nest of
grass or bark strips, and lays four or five white
eggs.

Is plywood ( waterproof) suitable for a l\ft.
v-bottom launch with an 8-10 h.p. engine used
for outside work and kept continuously out
in the weather?
Yes, plywood is a good material for boats,
though it is difficult to - obtain in Sydney at
present. Later large stocks will -be available.
For a boat such as you want to build rather
heavy plywood is suggested, say fin. It should
give good service for years if properly used and
all edges are covered. Plywood crumbles at
the edges if they are exposed to the weather
and to knocks. A plywood deck should be
covered with canvas in the usual way. Sug-
gest you get in touch with one of the plywood
mills, say Frederick Rose, Rosebery, N.S.W.
The manager is a boating man and always glad
to give advice on plywood and its uses in boat-
building.

"Long life to the grape, for
when summer is flown,
The age of our nectar shall
gladden our own." BYRON
Lord Byron, aristocrat, intellectual and traveller,
was naturally a connoisseur of living. Stormy of
temperament, impatient with the world and its
ways, he appreciated the soothing influence of a
mellow wine—such a wine as we have today in
each of the Tintara range—Gold Label Port, Gold
Label Muscatel, Amontillado Sherry, Cabinet Claret,
Old Castle Reisling, the Tintara Sparkling Wines—
Champagne, Hock, Moselle, and Burgundy—and
Tintara Old Brandy.
I oken wonder what the vintners buy
One half so precious as the goods they sell.
—Omar Khayyam.

The terrible scent of He 11....

PRELUDE TO aV INDUSTRY.
"COR generations the British Commonwealth has given asylum to
refugees from every country, and it is interesting that the hospitality
offered in England to the Huguenots nearly three centuries ago was the
first step towards the foundation of a great British business; and one,
moreover, destined to have far-reaching effects on the standards of life
throughout the world.
Within a century of settlement in England, a descendant of one of those
Huguenot families laid the foundations of what we now know as
Courtaulds, Limited, originally a silk business and later the first firm in
the world to make a commercial success of rayon.

JOE WAITE'S LANTERN
BY BRIAN JAMES
No. 10 of "The Cookabundy
Chronicles”
NEAR the top end of Baker’s Gully
was Joe Waite’s place, ingeniously
constructed of poles and hessian,
a palace by comparison with its
neighbors. A terrible old man was Joe.
In ordinary conversation he roared, so
that most people agreed with whatever
he said, and their obviously insincere
acquiescence annoyed Joe and made him
roar louder still. In argument he snorted
and bellowed, and when he considered
he had scored a point he gave a perfect
hurricane of a laugh that was even worse
than his bellowing.
His face was round, red and fierce —
sometimes very fierce. He had a short,
clipped and very neat beard, a big mouth
that snapped shut like a steel trap, and
distinct bunches of muscles at the angles
of his jawbone developed by roaring
and bellowing, no doubt.
He was just
on seventy
and, since he
rarely drank,
never smoked,
nor lived in
that state de-
scribed as “ir-
regular,” the
old-age pen-
sion was ample
for his needs.
And Joe lived
well on his
pension, for he
was a really
good cook. He baked bread in a camp-
oyen, he roasted beef or mutton, and he
consumed green vegetables—something
quite unorthodox this —in great quantity.
So Joe always looked fit and well-
nourished and robust.
There was no economic necessity for
Joe to dig for gold; but old habits are
hard to overcome. Joe decided to put
down a shaft in Mrs. O’Meara’s horse
paddock.
Mrs. O’Meara was strongly opposed
to the venture. She did not want shafts
put down anywhere in her property, for
her husband had in his lifetime spent a
small fortune in having all the holes
filled in and the place made into a farm.
Such considerations meant nothing to
Joe, and, as he said, he’d like to see any-
one trying to stop him digging just where
he liked. Just like to see them, that’s
all. He fairly bellowed this at Mrs.
O’Meara, who mildly hoped Joe would
fill in the shaft when he was finished
with it.
At this Joe gave a terrific snort that
seemed to indicate that filling in shafts
was a menial and servile drudgery and
much beneath him. Also, in a fresh
bellow, he mentioned two weapons that
made entry into horse-paddocks—or vine-
yards or orchards as far as that went —
a very simple matter. These were his
Miner’s Right and his friendship with
the Minister of Mines.
The Minister, it seemed, was a most re-
markable man, bellicose and vindictive,
so that should one overcome Joe him-
self, in his mining schemes—a high im-
probability—there was the Minister rant-
ing, roaring and rearing in the back-
ground. The mere thought of it was
enough to take the fight out of anyone.
Joe represented the Minister as a friend,
and let it be understood that he was in
almost daily communication with him—
by letter, of course. Perhaps Joe slightly
exaggerated in all this, for later on it
was discovered that the Minister said he
had never heard of Joe.
Be that as it may, when Joe mentioned
—in a triumphant bellow —the formidable
name of the Minister it caused all oppo-
sition to wilt. It went like this: “I say
that I will write to the Honorable Minis-
ter tonight!” Then he laughed his woe-
to-the-vanquished laugh.
No wonder, then, that Joe was able
to start his shaft in that horse paddock,
/’ e
HE pegged out his claim with scrupu-
lous attention to detail. Heaven only
knows how many claims Joe had pegged
out in his time —nearly all of them rank
duffers.
Being very wide of beam, Joe made a
very wide shaft —almost square really,
and had a heap of mullock out of all
proportion to depth. At ten feet he
took in a partner —no less a person than
old Charlie Box.
Charlie entered into this unequal alli-
ance against all his remaining instincts ;
but for years he had had a fancy to put
down a shaft in that horse paddock. And
almost on the very spot where Joe was
sinking. No one knows how the partner-
ship commenced, though its termination
became fairly general property.
From the outset Charlie was made to
feel his inferiority—a state he deeply
resented. But Charlie was not on intimate
terms with the terrible Minister and
there were political differences.
In a way, the end came over what was
known as a false bottom: true bottom
is bedrock, but s in sbme places there is a
band of hard clay, or pipeclay, and on
it is washdirt. Sometimes, this false
bottom is immensely rich in its wash-
dirt, far richer than true bottom, which
might be quite hungry. Again, it is
sometimes the other way about.
Joe was down below —a matter of
about twenty feet or so. He announced
that he had struck bottom, and that there
was no wash. Charlie audibly communed
with-himself, among other things saying:.
“Begawd, the man’s mad!”
“What did you say?” from below.
“I said, it’s another thirty feet to
bottom.”
There was an awful snort up the shaft.
Then, “We’ll put in a drive.”
“No drives for me, begawd!” Charlie
replied with admirable pigheadedness.
Then he added, before another snort or
bellow could drown his voice, “All the
gold about here—all shotty and coarse
gold, too —came from true bottom.”
“I said'that we’d put in a drive, and by
God we’ll put in a drive.”
“If you want to mess up the shaft
properly with your bloody drives, you
can have it on your own,”
From below came sounds that indi-
cated a preference for being on one’s
own —that is, if having company meant
having Charlie.
Charlie got his coat from the end of
the logging, retrieved a spill of tobacco
from between the logs and walked down
the gentle slope to the gully.
Joe came right out of the shaft, where
the matter of balancing himself had been
a hindrance to his oratory, stood on the
mullock heap and gave Charlie a parting
blessing: “Hell sweat you!” When Joe
invoked Hell to sweat people it generally
meant that as far as he was concerned,
he was finished with them.
FOR a time, Joe worked alone again,
and put in a drive, and carried some
sugarbags of most unlikely looking stuff
to a waterhole. He spent much time and
care reducing the pulp to liquid mud,
and had the reward of not a single color.
In some way,, which was not at all clear,
he blamed old Charlie for the failure.
And here en-
tered Andy Mc-
Nair often re-
ferred to along
the Cookabundy
as the Black Bull.
Sometimes he was
alluded to as
“Wenn’s Black
Bull,” which was
a libellous sort of
nickname, as it
had direct refer-
ence to that remarkable resemblance of
two of the Wenn boys to Andy.
Andy and Joe became fast friends,
largely because they fervently hated al-
most everyone else: and there was, too,
a genuine coincidence of views on many
vital matters. They exactly agreed that
old Charlie was one to be despised, both
for his ignorance and his politics.
Joe and Andy, after rooting about in
two unsightly-looking drives, decided,
after all, that they would go on to rock
bottom. This they did in a sort of hope
that they would get no gold—and prove
old Charlie something worse than a liar.
In the sequel they were entirely success-
ful —there was no wash at all on the
bottom. It was therefore a double-duffer
—and couldn’t have been so but for
Charlie.
Joe now interviewed Mrs, O’Meara
at a distance of half a mile or so. Ordin-
ary distance meant little to Joe, an
advantage really, for the other party
had no chance at all of replying.
“We are starting in the vineyard next
week,” he roared.
Mrs. O’Meara trembled at the pros-
pect. Yet she thought there were certain
restrictions on the right of entry to
ground used for cultivation.
Then the air trembled again as Joe
demanded, “What did you say? Speak
up—l can’t hear you.”
Mrs. O’Meara had really said nothing.
That vineyard was very beautiful in her
eyes—a jewel, set in the steely-grey of the
box. saplings.
Joe repeated his demand, and hearing
no reply went into one of his terrific
chuckles. Vineyards meant nothing to
Joe.
BUT Joe didn’t begin that shaft —in
spite of all the backing that the
Minister was so ready to give him.
Nor did Mrs. O’Meara go to Dawson,
the solicitor, to see about an injunction.
Joe just disappeared.
At first people thought Joe had gone
to town for some reason or other, or
that he had gone somewhere else, and
would turn up again, as gusty as ever.
A few days went by, and Joe didn’t
turn up, and an almost eerie silence had
settled over Baker’s Gully, Someone
suggested that something must have hap-
pened to Joe —though it seemed highly
improbable that anything would be game
to happen to Joe. Still, no one had seen
Joe, and it might be better to let the
police know about it.
Old Sergeant Sim came out from Sum-
merlea. It was a bright autumn day, and
the sergeant enjoyed the outing. He
went to Joe’s hut, and looked about him
for some little time. Then rode down the
gully, munching a very fine quince he
had found on some «trees growing wild
in a big clump near some old-time home,
long since disappeared. Sergeant Sim
liked quinces, especially if they had a
“touch of frost to them” and had plenty
of jelly round the core.
A fine old officer was Sergeant Sim,
but near the end of the service tether
now. His black beard was well specked
with grey, but he was as straight as ever,
almost, and his steady grey eyes, that
had looked on much danger, were clear
and steady still —and direct and honest,
too.
In a way, it was almost startling to
meet with the old sergeant, for he was
really a legendary figure now —heaven
alone knew how many bushrangers, cattle-
duffers, murderers and others who special-
ised in big and desperate crimes he had
arrested. In only one branch of crimes
he did not distinguish himself greatly: he
never seemed able to track down the
illicit stills that were operated in certain
lonely parts of the district.
He finished his quince as he neared the
O’Meara home. No, he told Mrs.
O’Meara, there was no sign of Joe at
the hut. It looked queer to him.
The bed in the hut was made up—not
slept in since Saturday, when Joe was
last seen; Saturday’s bread was in the
gin case not touched; there was a stew
in the saucepan near the galley. Joe
could hardly have come back on Satur-
day night,
Joe, he understood, had gone, as
usually he did, over to Wilton’s place, on
Saturday night. Yet his lantern was in
the hut. There was no moon, and Joe
would hardly go that dangerous walk
through the old holes without a lantern.
And yet the lantern was in the hut. It
was surprising how much the sergeant
saw in that slow, easy way he had.
Mrs. O’Meara was much distressed.
Joe had been a trial, but it was hard to
think that he might suddenly have come
to his end. She thought he must have
fallen down a shaft.
Sergeant Sim admitted the probability
of Joe’s falling down a hole, but he did
think the lantern should have gone down
with him. Of course, if Joe hadn’t taken
his lantern last Saturday it would make
falling down a hole a lot easier. Young
Tim O’Meara, however, was certain Joe
had taken his lantern —he had seen Joe
going towards Two Rocks late on Satur-
day afternoon, and he was positive Joe
had the lantern then.
Saying again that it was a queer show,
the sergeant cantered off. He headed
across the creek and fetched up at Billy
Rosen’s. When anything big happened,
or when anything valuable was lost, or
when anyone was missing—in fact, on
any sort of occasion at all, it was custom-
ary to go along to Billy Rosen’s. And
to make a search of his cellar. But the
most conscientious search failed to bring
Joe to light, and reluctantly and possibly
a little unsteady and overwrought at his
failure Sergeant Sim at last departed.
He went back to Mrs. O’Meara’s, which
was not on his way to town at all, and
announced that the “quince had made
him shick,”
No, the sergeant wouldn’t lie down
inside —preferred the shed; would much
rather die there. He lay on some corn
sacks in the shed and snored horribly.
The younger O’Meara children sneaked
up from time to time and peeped through
the cracks, and felt proud in a fearful
fashion of having the sergeant in the shed.
They were much impressed at the terrible
effects of quinces.
During the night, however, the sergeant
recovered and departed for Summerlea
with no more ado. ;
IN good time next morning the sergeant
was back, and Jacky, the Queens-
land tracker, was with him. They found
no trace of Joe, and the sergeant decided
on a search party for the next day.
Next day the search party gathered
at Joe’s hut —the biggest search party
ever seen thereabouts; at least four
hundred strong. Men from many miles
around turned up. It would almost
seem that Joe was a popular character
and much beloved. But it wasn’t that at
all. More likely it was a kind of curiosity,
childish and morbid, to see what had be-
come of Joe. Just as children might
creep up fearfully to look at a dead lion.
Not that anyone really believed that
Joe could be dead. There was some-
thing so solid and substantial about Joe;
he had his feet based so firmly on life
that one couldn’t imagine him dead.
Every shaft thousands of these all
told—-was carefully looked into; every
tunnel and “monkey” shaft, too. And so
was the bush, especially the thick patches
of young pine and tea-tree. But not a
trace of Joe. Then they went over it all
again, and they widened the circles, and
exchanged areas, and dragged all the
dams and water holes again. But no Joe,
Old Charlie Box got about with a look
of miserable guilt on him. Charlie was
sure he was suspected of murdering Joe.
“Begawd! ” he confided to Mrs.
O’Meara, “begawd, woman, they all think
I did it. Killed Joe and threw him, down
a shaft.”
“But what shaft?” said Mrs. O’Meara.
“They say they have searched every
shaft.”
“That’s just it,” said Charlie, “What
shaft? You see I didn’t really kill Joe
at all, and know nothing about it; but
it doesn’t seem to make any difference.”
And old Charlie thrust his hands down
and down inside his pants, as was his
way in distressing situations, till, as some-
one pointed out, “it didn’t look decent
at all.”
Charlie couldn’t be comforted, nor was
he reassured by Adolf Himmelman, who
had come over with Billy Rosen and a
supply of liquid refreshment. Adolf
didn’t join in the search, but criticised
keenly all who did. And breathed from
time to time dark and subtle hints that
Joe had undoubtedly been murdered, and
that the murderer was not far to seek. He
fairly glared through his bushy brows at
old Charlie Box. And that actually made
old Charlie feel guilty.
Jim Bower had come over to join in
the search. Jim had probably seen Joe
not more than half-a-dozen times since
Joe had come to Baker’s Gully a few
years before. But Joe was an old mate,
a sturdy character, and the world could
ill afford to lose its sturdy characters. He
commended Joe’s straightforwardness
and manly expression of opinion
“You knew where you stood with him;
not many like him /”; which was true
enough.
Simpson Butler also came out from
town to help. There is always some-
thing singularly touching in the sight of
a Member of Parliament in the process
of physical exertion, and to see Simpson
Butler puffing and panting through a thick
tea-tree scrub on a heavy up-grade was
a lesson to more than one that there was
a lot more in politics than ever they
had thought.
Young Friar came out for half a day
in the interests of the “Argus” and got
a great deal of cojay for the paper —and
might even have got more if he hadn’t
interviewed the liquid refreshments.
However, he printed a very vivid ac-
count of the “grim search pursued with
unrelenting vigor over those deserted

GERMANY, KEY TO THE PEACE.
As reported in cables, an “international
committee,” with Britain, France, Bel-
gium, Denmark and Holland represented
(Lord Vansittart among the British dele-
gates), has found a “network of Nazi
organisations” in Germany and else-
where, working for “the economic libera-
tion of Germany as a preliminary to
political liberation and the establishment
in Berlin of a strongly centralised German
Government.”
The committee’s report—evidently
timed to have an effect on the German
peace treaty discussions, due to open in
Moscow early in March —was promptly
described by the Governor of the U.S.
zone, Lieut.-Gen. Clay, as “over-hasty.”
Many reports of “denazification” and
other troubles (including those caused by
negro troops) have been appearing in
American papers, suggesting some im-
patience with the job, while other reports
have suggested that such organisations as
the Vansittart committee mentioned
would be almost an inevitable result of
those troubles and present conditions in
Germany. •
The account of the negro troubles —a
sore point with Germans, regarding the
French use of black occupation troops,
after the last war—-was given in an angry
report submitted by George Meader,
counsel to the U.S. Senate War Investiga-
tion Committee. Parts of it published in
December deserved attention both as a
picture of prevailing conditions and as a
signpost to possible German feelings.
Reporting that “a major difficulty in Ger-
many has been the disproportionately
large number of negro troops used in the
occupation duties,” Mr. Meader went on
to tell a shocking story of the 70 per
cent, venereal rate among the negroes,
their beating up of a German mayor be-
cause, though he had nothing to do with
it, a house to which they were taking
German women was raided, and other
such behavior.
As well, Mr. Meader reported caustic-
ally on the “displaced persons,” largely
some 200,000 Jews, who he said had
been sent into the U.S. # zone as part of
a carefully-organised and well-financed
plan—organised and financed “by Ameri-
can sources.” “These persons, for the
most part penniless, do not desire to
work ; they expect to be cared for and
complain when things are not as they
think they should be.” He stated, that
crimes of violence among the “displaced”
were numerous, including for the first
half of the year “4116 thefts, 219 homi-
cides and 890 assaults.” Such things
have their effects.
“Apathetic and Hopeless”
By all first-hand accounts, conditions
have now reached a stage calling for
prompt action to avert worse troubles
than the occupying Powers have yet run
into anywhere. In Germany, a N.Y.
“Times” correspondent finds, they are
dealing with “a land of stagnation,” its
people “apathetic and hopeless.” He
suggests that “if Germany could be uni-
fied it would go a long way toward mak-
ing it possible for her to maintain herself
\vithout the assistance of her conquerors,”
in regard to which he pointed out that
while at present British and American
taxpayers “are in the anomalous position
of paying reparations to a conquered
enemy,” Russia and France —especially
Russia “find the job of occupation a
profitable one.”
The N.Y, “Times” man reported that,
exclusive of food, the Soviets had been
taking an estimated 70 per cent, of the
industrial products from their zone as
reparations and are using a large part
of the remaining 30 per cent, for their
army of occupation. “In addition they
have removed about 50 per cent, of the
industrial capacity.”
With the occupation the
Russians could be expected to attempt
at the Moscow meeting to prolong the
present arrangements in Germany in-
definitely, and the report on the Nazi net-
work would in that case be a most timely
help. But the. moves to unify Germany
are not all coming from the American-
British side; France has been reported
the only one of the occupying Powers
opposing it; and the Soviet international
review “New Times” has given as the
Russian view, since the turn of the year,
that “Germany must be unified politically
and economically if the division of the
country into spheres of influence is to be
avoided,” that unifying the very thing
the Vansittart committee report might
have aimed to prevent.
Other considerations, too —chief among
them the parlous state of existence to
which the Germans have been reduced
and the effect that this might have on
their future outlook and definitely is hav-
ing in preventing any revival of the indus-
try that is needed if Britain and America
are not to go on footing a huge bill and
other countries are to get reparations—
are considered much more likely to affect
the Moscow peacemaking than such
things as the Vansittart committee’s find-
ings. In fact, “World Report” has de-
clared that; —
The situation in Germany is now so bad
that Russia, Britain and the United States
are finding it necessary to submerge their
differences and revive the German economy.
....Soviet officials, having stripped their
zone of Germany, fear they may have killed
the goose that lays the golden eggs at a
time when they badly need the eggs in
Russia. The British and Americans are
running into growing criticism over the
high cost of occupation. Meanwhile, the
Germans are running out of food, coal and
hope.
Action Pressingly Urgent
Whatever conflict of other views there
may be among them, close observers of
the protracted peacemaking are generally
agreed on two main points: (1) that the
whole structure of the peace—the possi-
bility of its lasting and of the victor
countries continuing to have the will and
the unity to see that it does last —will
depend on the nature of the treaty that is
made for Germany; and (2) that the
job of making that treaty, meanwhile
doing something to arrest the grim de-
terioration in Germany, has become
pressingly urgent.
They would add, also, that another
prime essential will be safeguards to en-
sure that whatever terms are agreed to
will this time be faithfully enacted by all
parties to the treaty. London “Times”
—like many others driven to hedging a
bit these days on earlier faith in Russia
—recently gave Professor Findlay Shirras
(who has been director of public revenue
and general finance in the British section)
the rare privilege of a full-column letter
dealing with the breaking of the Potsdam
Agreement. As typical of what Professor
Shirras points out was solemnly agreed to
at Potsdam:
“During the period of occupation Ger-
many shall be treated as a single economic
unit,” and for this purpose there will be
an “, e 9 u^a ble distribution of essential com-
modities between the several zones, so as
to produce a balanced economy throughout
Germany...
Professor Shirras’s long list of the
similar solemn undertakings that have
since all been completely ignored makes
a crushing comment on faith in treaties
and the contracted word. Had the agree-
ment been fulfilled it would have meant,
in Professor Shirras’s view, “the eventual
emergence of an independent and in-
dustrially prosperous but completely dis-
armed Germany, with beneficial results
on the rest of Europe and the world.” The
peace, in fact, would by now be taking
definite shape. Instead, the already
serious deterioration, both in German
conditions and in peaceful relations among
the controlling countries, has steadily
worsened. The German conditions and
what they are leading to have been vividly
described in a “Saturday Evening Post”
article by Dr. Karl Brandt, the anti-
Nazi German writer who has lately been
agricultural adviser to the American
Military Government in his former
country;
Tbe most important single fact about
beaten Germany today is that its people
are starving—slowly, quietly, in different
degrees in different localities, but starving
nonetheless and through that starvation
moving toward a complete economic revo-
lution which can prevent any permanent
peace in Europe while we live.
Health Collapse
That is endorsed, and the urgency of
the position emphasised, in a “Wall-street
Journal” article by William Henry
Chamberlin, who reports that of the
Euronean countries he visited “Germany
— St. Louis (U.S.) “Post-Dispatch."
“A POLICEMAN’S LOT. ...”
alone showed indications of deterioration,
rather than improvement, since the end
of the war”:
So the discussion of the German problem
is taking place in an atmosphere of ex-
treme urgency. If Germany turns into
a hopeless starving slum the whole atmos-
phere of European reconstruction will be
poisoned.
Chamberlin points to the possibility of
“an almost unmanageable problem of
nation-wide breakdown of health and
workipg capacity”:
It is later than we think in Germany.
If we want to avert a collapse in Central
Europe that would have a most disastrous
effect on all schemes for European re-
construction. .. .we must act quickly. Show-
ing the German people how they and their
children can eat without being compelled
to kill stray dogs would be an infinitely
more' promising way of laying the foun-
dations of democracy in that country than
indulging in periodic spasms of “denazi-
fication” activity. •
The fear of a serious health collapse
before the peacemakers have reached
agreement on a German treaty has the
support of many who have lately been in
Germany. It is why President Truman
has sent Mr. Hoover there on a special
food mission—something that cannot
await the treaty that may eventually
emerge from the preliminary discussions
in London and Berlin, the coming Mos-
cow meeting of Foreign Ministers and
any later bargaining (in handing over to
General Marshall, former U.S. Secre-
tary of State Byrnes said “it would take
two years to make the treaty with Ger-
many”). A London “Times” special
correspondent, referring to the influenza
epidemic which was expected in Ger-
many last winter, but which did not
occur, warns that “that luck may not be
repeated,” and in the present desperate
condition of the country “once an epi-
demic started it would be hard to check.”
The same correspondent mentions that
“tuberculosis has increased sharply”; he
shows a twofold increase last year on
the previous year’s figures.
U.S.-British Polic>
In that grim setting of a whole big
nation bordering on a state of utter col-
lapse Mr. Byrnes delivered at Stuttgart
as one of his last and most important
statements of American foreign policy a
speech the essentials of which can be
accepted as British policy also. It
amounted to telling the German people
—and, of course, Russia—what the
general stand of America (and Britain)
would be at Moscow. The more im-
portant points are here included in con-
densed extracts;—
Upon proper solution of the problems
involved in the reconstruction of Germany
will depend not only the future wellbeing
of Germany but the future wellbeing of
Europe and the world.
It is not in the interest of the German
people or in the interest of world peace
that Germany should become a pawn or
a partner in a military struggle for power
between the East and the West.
The United States will not agree to the
taking from Germany of greater reparations
than was provided by the Potsdam Agree-
ment.
The time has come when the zonal
boundaries should be regarded as defining
only the areas to be occupied for security
purposes by the armed forces of the
occupying Powers and not as self-contained
economic or political units. That was the
course of development envisaged by the
Potsdam Agreement which the American
Government intends to follow to- the full
limit of its authority.
We favor the economic unification of
Germany. If complete unification cannot
be secured, we shall do everything in our
power to secure the maximum possible
unification.
The American Government is unwilling
to accept responsibility for the needless
aggravation of economic distress that is
caused by the failure of the Allied Con-
trol Council to agree to give the German
people a chance to solve some of their
most urgent economic problems. So far
as many vital questions are concerned, the
Control Council is neither governing Ger-
many nor allowing Germany to govern
itself.
Germany must be given a chance to ex-
port goods in order to import enough to
make her economy self-sustaining. Re-
covery in Europe, and particularly in the
States adjoining Germany, will be slow
indeed if Germany with her great resources
of iron and coal is turned into a poor-
house.
It was never the intention of the Ameri-
can Government to deny to the German
people the right to manage their own in-
ternal affairs as soon as they were able
to do so in a democratic way with genuine
respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms.
The purpose of the occupation did not
contemplate a prolonged foreign dictator-
ship of Germany’s peace-time economy or
a prolonged foreign dictatorship of Ger-
many’s internal political life. The Potsdam
Agreement expressly bound the occupying
Powers to start building a political de-
mocracy from the ground up.
It is the view of the American Govern-
ment that the German people throughout
Germany, under proper safeguards, should
now be given the primary responsibility
for the running of their own affairs. The
United States favors the early establish-
ment of a provisional German Government
for Germany.
Claims for Territory
Declaring pointedly that, “as long as
there is an occupation army in Germany,
American forces will be part of that oc-
cupation army,” Mr. Byrnes re-
garding the assigning of German terri-
tory to other countries, that apart from
the transfer of Konigsberg and the area
adjacent to it to the Soviet Union, a re-
vision of the frontiers in Poland’s favor
(“However, the extent of the area to be
ceded to Poland must be determined
when the final settlement is agreed upon”)
and the ceding of the Saar territory to
France —except for these transfers, “The

United States will not support any en-
croachment on territory which is indis-
putably German or any division of Ger-
many which is not genuinely desired by
the people concerned. So far as the
United States is aware, the people of the
Ruhr and the Rhineland desire to re-
main united with the rest of Germany.
And the United States is not going to
oppose their desire.”
Since Mr. Byrnes laid down that out-
line of U.S. policy in Germany, London
“Times” has published a map showing
that all but one of the seven countries
bordering oh Germany —the exception
Denmark —have put in claims for slices of
German territory, Poland has pegged out
something like a fourth of Germany’s
agricultural land; the other claims are
for small areas, though Germans would
consider them all highly important and
definitely German.
Whether or not these are allowed at
the Moscow and subsequent peacemak-
ing, one thing quite definite already is
that Germany will eventually emerge
united. The aim of dividing the
country into separate States, which once
had some following, is no longer men-
tioned, and instead of the Morgenthau
plan for turning the whole country into
an agricultural area without industries —
derided out of existence in Morgenthau’s
own country as “the goat-pasture policy”
—it is now generally agreed that, as a
London “Times” editorial comment has
put it, “If Germany, with a larger popu-
lation in a smaller area is to prosper she
must eventually (failing mass emigra-
tion) have not less industry than before
but more.” And the “Times” considers
it a positive essential of the peace that
Germany should prosper—being kept dis-
armed, of course.
The Great Test
On a united Germany, “World Re-
port” states that “the prospect for agree-
ment seems better now than at any time
since Potsdam.” It adds, however, that
“Disagreement will come on what is to
be done with the Germany thus united.
Russia wants a Communist Germany.
The U.S, would prefer a federated and
democratic Germany. Britain’s Labor
Government wants a Socialist Germany
capable of acting as a buffer between
Britain and Russia.” But that is an issue
in the German problem that the Germans
themselves will decide. The “Times”
sees them as already definitely taking a
hand in beginning to shape the future
Germany; “the stage has been passed
in which only the actions and intentions
of the Allies matter and the efforts and
opinions of the Germans themselves are
immaterial.”
The main aim at Moscow will remain
that voiced by Mr. Bevin—that “nothing
will be done which will enable Germany
to become a military Power again” ; that
everything possible wifi be done to pre-
vent that happening. At Moscow, as a
N.Y. “Herald Tribune” writer sees it:
At one and the same time they can
eliminate Germany as a source of war and
by the very settlement of this awful problem
immeasurably lessen the tensions, the fric-
tions and the rivalries between them that
today constitute the second possible source
of war. With Germany as a war-maker
out of the picture, and with stability estab-
lished between the East and the West, a
serious war is unthinkable.
“The German question,” this writer
concludes, “is the great test, and easily
the most difficult the victorious allies
have yet faced.” It is the key to the
whole peace; the Moscow meeting next
month therefore the most important one
to date.
CANADA SPIES’ BIG
HAUL.
Describing his difficulty in securing a
copy of the Canadian Royal Commis-
sion’s report on the Soviet spy activities
in Ottawa and elsewhere. Sir Ernest
Graham-Little, a member of the House
of Commons, stated in a letter to London
“Daily Telegraph”: “The report, I am
informed by a reliable correspondent, is
readily obtainable in Australia, where it
has caused profound anxiety.”
Sir Ernest should change his corres-
pondent: probably not one Australian
in 50,000 has set eyes on the report. It
has not been put into even limited public
circulation; the general idea probably is
that it is a Secret Document. There has
not even been published an extensive
summary, such as has been given in
London “Nineteenth Century and After.”
A particular, if minor, point of interest
to Australia —since from here a group of
sympathisers calling themselves an “Aus-
tralian Association of Scientific Workers”
and also the Fellowship of Australian
Writers cabled impudent demands for
the release of the English traitor Nun
May—is that that hero of the Soviet fifth-
column was as guilty as could be. The
Royal Commission report states that Nun
May ,
was in a position to get samples of
Uranium 235 enriched and Uranium 233:
he did get them and did deliver them to
Lt. Angelov. These samples were con-
sidered so important by the Russians that
upon their receipt Molinov [a member of
the Soviet Military Attache’s staff in
Ottawa] flew to Moscow with them.
The working methods of the spy ring
—in which Nun May went under the
— St. Louis (U.S.) “Star Times.”
PUT HUMPTY-DUMPTY TOGETHER AGAIN?
prophetic name of Alek —are of wider
interest. As related in the 733-page Royal
Commission report, the Canadian Com-
munist party “not only supplied personnel
with adequately ‘developed’ motivations,
but provided the organisational frame-
work wherein recruiting could be and
was carried out safely and efficiently."
Appointed Soviet Military in
Canada, Colonel Zabotin
found already in existence in Ottawa,
Montreal and Toronto numerous study
groups where Communist philosophy and
technique were studied and where writings
of Marx, Engels, Lenin and later authors
were read and discussed. To outsiders
these groups adopted various disguises, such
as social gatherings, music-listening groups
and groups for discussing international
politics and economics. In some at least
of these groups dues were collected and
money used for various purposes includ-
ing assistance to Communist party leaders,
and, the purchase of Communist literature.
These study groups were in fact “cells”
and were the recruiting centres for agents,
and the medium of development of the
necessary frame of mind which was a pre-
liminary condition to eventual service of
the Soviet Union in a more practical way.
With the necessary working organisa-
tion thus provided by the Communist
party, “within a short period of time
what had been merely a political study
group, made up of Canadian scientists as
members of a Canadian political party,
was transformed on instructions from
Moscow into an active espionage or-
ganisation working against Canada on be-
half of a foreign Power.”
One important feature of the Royal
Commission’s report deserves to be
specially noted —that, far from securing
only “insignificant data,” as the brazen
Soviet admission of the guilt falsely
stated, the spy ring made a very rich haul
indeed. • “Much secret and valuable in-
formation,” the official report states,
“was handed over. Some of it is so secret
still that it can be referred to only
obliquely and with the greatest care, and
this is especially so in the case of certain
information shared by Canada, the
United Kingdom and the United States.”
As well as recording the valuable informa-
tion supplied by Nun May, the Royal
Commission reported:
Next to the atomic bomb it would appear
to us that the development of radar was
perhaps the most vital Work accomplished
by the English-speaking democracies in the
technical field during the period in ques-
tion Information of the greatest im-
portance in this field was communicated
to the Russians by agents.
The work done in connection with anti-
submarine devices, Asdic, is as important
as the work done on radar —some authori-
ties say it is more important. Much of
it is still in the Top Secret category. The
information before us leads us to the con-
clusion that much, and very possibly all,
of the information available in Canada on
this subject has been compromised.
The advances made in Canada by
Canadians in developing and improving
explosives and propellants were outstand-
mg... .The very names
of many formulas are
still supposed to be
secret: the production
methods even more
so. But the names
and much of the sec-
ret information were
given to the Russians.
Another develop-
ment in which Canada
played a leading role
is the “V.T. Fuse,”
the name being a code
name.... The wiring
details and the de-
tails of manufacture
are still classified as
secret... .One of the
agents upon whom
we are reporting had
the wiring diagram of
this fuse.
Much vital techni-
cal information,
which would still be
secret to the authori-
ties of Canada, Great
Britain and the United
States, has been made
known to the Rus-
sians by reason of
the espionage activi-
ties reported on here-
in... .We should em-
phasise that the
bulk of the technical
information sought by
the espionage leaders
related to research
developments which
would play an impor-
tant part in the post-war defence of Canada,
the United Kingdom and the United States.
In addition to the directly military infor-
mation, the spy haul tracked down by
the Royal Commission included
information on production, location of in-
dustries, transportation and planning. It
included also information regarding a wide
variety of financial matters and matters
pertaining to international trade and com-
mercial policy. It is sufficient to say that
the amount of material in this category
which was banded over was very great
indeed, and that much of it was classified
as Secret or Top Secret. Regarding the
evaluation of this material, we will say
only that this information appears to have
been such as would be designed to facili-
tate detailed estimates of Canada’s post-
war economic and military potential.
In addition to material on technical,
scientific and economic subjects, the espion-
age leaders also sought—and obtained from
agents in the cipher division of the De-
partment of External Affairs and in the
registry of the Office of the United King-
dom High Commissioners at Ottawa —
political information. Much of the political
information obtained was classified as Top
Secret and related not only to the policies
of the Canadian Government, but to those
of the Governments of the United King-
dom and the United States.
“The most important thing,” the Royal
Commissioners stated, “is the agreement
of certain Canadian Communists to work
under foreign orders in a conspiracy
directed against their own country.” Not
only Communists, it should be added, but
their “fellow-travellers” as well, for, as
the report notes, suitable “helpers”—
“scientific workers” and the like —were
discouraged from open membership of
the Communist party or were encouraged
to keep their membership secret.
An odd sidelight of the case is that all
its highly important revelations went
within an ace of not being known at all.
Gouzenko, the cipher clerk who gave
the Soviet game away, actually for two
days hawked in vain around Canadian
Government offices and an Ottawa news-
paper office the incriminating documents
he had selected from the Russian Em-
bassy files. He could find nobody who
would believe him! Eventually, finding
that he was being watched, and after men
from the Russian Embassy had tried to
get into his apartment, he took refuge in
the adjoining apartment occupied by a
Royal Canadian Air Force n.c.o. who,
told that “the Russians were going to kill”
Gouzenko and his wife, brought in the
police. Gouzenko handed over his docu-
ments and asked to be taken into “pro-
tective custody,” and the exposure of the
Soviet spy ring and, still more im-
portantly, its Communist “fifth-column”
workers was at last on the way.
DRAGNET DIGEST.
A Determined Princess Elizabeth. —lt is
generally accepted in America that Princess
Elizabeth is certain to marry Prince Phillip
of Greece. Opposition to the match is there
assessed as chiefly Communist —“about the last
thing,” says a London correspondent of the
Chicago “Sun,” “that would deflect this young
woman from her objective.” The correspondent,
Frederick Kuh, sketches a character of the
Princess closely resembling Froude’s picture of
the other Elizabeth. “Unlike the princess in
some fairy tales,” writes Kuh, “Elizabeth is
not the meek wilting type, but knows what she
wants and is unlikely to be deterred from
getting it by political hubbub.” The attempt
of the Communist “Daily Worker” to “torpedo
the proposed marriage,” describing it as
“another move to strengthen Britain’s hold on
Greece as an Imperial outpost in the Mediter-
ranean,” Kuh considers ‘‘is likely to be as
effective as a peashooter against the whole
Royal Air Force.”

Soviet Atomic Lag. —ln a cynical American
view, Soviet Russia would be quite willing to
bargain demobilisation of its huge armed
forces for destruction of U.S. atom-bomb
plants and stocks, because if this was brought
off “it would take the U.S. more than a year
to rebuild, whereas the Russian forces could
be mobilised again in a matter of weeks.” On
the Soviet lag a German winner of the Nobel
award in chemistry, Professor Otto Hahn, re-
cently stated that “the Russians possess only
one or two medium-capacity 7 cyclotrons for
producing nuclear fission, whereas the United
States possesses at least a dozen high-powered
installations.” The Russians, Professor Hahn
said, are “working feverishly to catch up.”
He added that two of Germany’s best atom
researchers were now working, “voluntarily or
involuntarily,” for Moscow.

Ford Proposes Labor Laws.— After puncturing
the John L. Lewis bubble, Mr. Truman spoke
strongly against any rush into vindictive labor
laws, but there is still very widespread feeling
in favor of restrictive legislation. On this,
Henry Ford 2d (as they style him in America)
suggests that “Congress should enact labor
laws that will put unions under the same
responsibility to the public that is now imposed
on industry,” that “unions should be required
to make ‘ample’ financial reports,” and that
“the tenure of office of union leaders should
be a minimum of two years.” By general
report, legislation aimed at weakening the big
unions and arresting their monopoly growth
is as good as certain.

Light Rations in Russia. —Writing in Scripps-
Howard newspapers, Eugene Lyons states that
in a study of living standards in 34 countries
before the war recently published in Washing-
ton by a group of leading economists “Soviet
Russia stood 28th on the fist, just above China
and India,” and “since the war, of course,
conditions have become unavoidably worse.”
Lyons adds that “In some regions, sudr as
the Ukraine and White Russia, the end of
U.N.R RA. relief will mean literal starvation
for many millions.”

Big Brother Appeal. —ln London Lord
Huntingfield, as chairman, has launched a Big
Brother Movement appeal for £50,000 to
“enable the organisation to develop its plans
for settling more British boys in Australia under
the care and guidance of prominent citizens.”
Up to the war the organisation had, since it
was started in 1925, sent 2076 lads to Aus-
tralia. _ “There is no doubt,” Lord Hunting-
field said, “the Big Brother Movement is a
practical answer to the challenge which Aus-
tralia has to meet that of increasing her
population and effectively occupying her terri-
tory.” The secretary in London, Lieut.-Col.
H. N. M. Clegg, back from a visit to Aus-
tralia, reported that he found here “unbounded
enthusiasm at the resumption of the movement.”

A NATION AND ITS FRIENDS.
A phrase much abused in Canberra
usage is “the - nation.” It came into
fashion with the advent of the Curtin-
Evatt Government in October, 1941. It
was popularised and vulgarised by pub-
licity men and radio announcers. Who
can forget the A.B.C. formula: “The
Prime Minister of the Commonwealth,
the Right Honorable John Curtin, address-
ing the nation, used these words....”
There was a time when Australia did
possess a sense of nationhood, held so
robustly that it was unnecessary to re-
mind its inhabitants two or three times
a day of its existence. It was born, as
real national spirit always is, of convic-
tions and beliefs and common aspira-
tions, cherished so strongly by all that
they seemed to belong to the blood of
every Australian. The convictions
and beliefs were firmly based on
racial pride, and on the recog-
nition of the right of the Australian
people to become inheritors of the
British way of Parliamentary govern-
ment and the British system of common
law, and under them to develop their own
greatness, side by side and in partnership
with the Mother Country.
In the years before World War I no
Government would have thought of doing
anything in the way of loosening essen-
tial bonds with Britain or of breaking
with British methods of government, nor
would any Government have suggested
any measure which might lead to the
tainting of racial purity. Never was con-
tention so warm between the British and
Australian Governments as when the
Federal instrument of government was
being shaped. But the spectacle of a
Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Minister
dragging his leash at the head of a pack
of gringo republics and acquiescing in
foreign interference in the domestic affairs
of a member of the British Common-
wealth —as has been done to the grave
injury of South Africa, and so of Aus-
tralia —would have been unthinkable.
There were Labor Ministers in 1914
and 1915. Had one of them in either
year imported a large number of foreign
Jews from Shanghai, some of them born
in enemy countries, his career would
have been over for ever from the moment
the facts became public. So would the
careers of all his colleagues had their
Government —as this “Government” ha?
done—permitted young Australian girls Jo
leave the country to breed half-castes in
kris-ruled, betel-chewing Javanese vil-
lages or —again as this Government has
done—allowed the murder of Australian
soldiers, going about their lawful occa-
sions in an ostensibly friendly country
and butchered in cold blood by savages,
to pass without demanding punishment,
compensation or even explanation.
Those were days when pride of nation-
hood was in every Australian and when
all the world had reason to be conscious
of it, since it was expressed through
action and essential policy which did not
need a grandiose “Foreign Office” nor
a horde of roving spokesmen abroad to
make them felt.
. In those days Australian diplomacy
achieved common action inside the British
family of nations, while pressing its
interests to the limit, sometimes in hot
debate. Australian strength and eloquence
were sufficient to get us our own way
and to change the course of international
affairs to suit ourselves, as was proved
by the victories of Mr. Hughes at Ver-
sailles in the matters of the Pacific islands
and the Japanese demand for unrestricted
entry to Australia. Whatever was done
was in keeping with a general recognition'
of the Commonwealth’s right to speak
as a nation without any need to stress it
unduly and advertise it like a brand of
pickles.
Long before Dr. Fvatt entered Parlia-
ment the Commonwealth had achieved
recognition of its constitutional privilege
of managing its own affairs, internal and
external, as had the other great white
Dominions, The Joint Committee of the
Lords and Commons had, in consider-
ing the Wcstralian secession petition, laid
it down that the Imperial Parliament,
whatever its undoubted legal rights,
should not legislate upoh any subject
concerning the Australian Constitution
without Australian consent, a principle
inherent in the Constitution Act itself.
The Commonwealth already had asserted
its right to carry on its own diplomacy
and to appoint Ministers abroad. The
right of its Ministers of State to advise
the King without the intervention of the
British Dominions Office and to have a
Governor-General of its own choosing was
well established. If its Parliament had,
within its competence* passed legislation
repugnant to British law and not oper-
able outside its own ambit there would
have been no quarrel about it. If the
Australian people had proved a desire for
secession they could have had their way.
Yet despite all this it is brazenly as-
serted again and again that, until Dr.
Evatt gave this country “nationhood” by
having the Statute of Westminster Adop-
tion Act passed by Parliament, this
country was not its own mistress but a
mere glorified colony whose rights were
not even defined.
All that the passing of the Adoption
Act did, without in any way increasing
the country’s freedom of action, was to
put its relationships in bonds, to en-
courage ignorant haters of the British
connection in an illusion that the
Commonwealth had gone the way of
Eire and to create in the “minds” of
Ministers the idea that they must twist
the Lion’s tail and thwart vital Dominion
interests to prove the extent to which they
had achieved Australian “nationhood”
and independence.
In adopting the Statute of Westminster
the present Canberra crowd did some-
thing which all Governments, a “Labor”
Government inducted, had hesitated to
do, for good reasons.
Mr. Bruce, Mr. Latham and Sir Neville
Howse, V.C., were very cool about the
scheme (it was fathered by General
Hertzog). So, four years later, was Mr.
Scullin, who, as Prime Minister, declared
that there was “nothing to be gained and
a great deal to be lost by attempting to
crystallise our relation too closely within
the confines of any formal document.” So
was Mr, Menzies, who, as Attorney-
General in the Lyons Government,
echoed and elaborated Mr. Scullin’s view
in 1938, remarking that it was “highly
dangerous, to say the least of it, to en-
deavor to reduce to a written formula,
and therefore to rigid and legal terms, a
relationship some of the supreme value
of which has been its very vagueness and
elasticity.”
The dangers inherent in inflexible
arrangements with the Mother Country
are not common to all the Dominions.
Canada, N.Z. and South Africa have con-
stitutions which render them sovereign,
either by law or convention or both,
within their territories. The scope of the
Commonwealth’s constitutional sove-
reignty is limited to powers derived from
the Imperial Statute directly, and in-
directly through the referendum provi-
sions of Section 128. The British Parlia-
ment retains at least a formal share in
Australian government.
On matters on which it has no express
authority, the Australian Parliament
cannot legislate save through referendum
or by the statutory consent of the Im-
perial Parliament. In 1937 the Imperial
Parliament amended the Australian Con-
stitution by statute to enable Australia to
give effect to the provisions of the Geneva
Convention for the amelioration of the
condition of the wounded and sick in
armies in the field.
Moreover, while Australia, in Dr.
Evatt’s view, accepts the King as King
of Australia, an entirely different entity
from the King of England, the Common-
wealth Parliament apparently has no
right to choose its King and certainly no
statutory say in the appointment of a
Regent when one becomes necessary—
the Regency Act of 1937 was passed by
the Imperial Government for the
Dominions as well as Britain, and the
Westminster Statute has not altered the
position.
The Council which acts for his Majesty
while he is on his tour of South Africa
and which might have been called on
to deal with Mr. Chifley’s recommenda-
tion of a Governor-General is wholly
the creation of the British realm. In it
Australia has no hand; on it, no choseri
representative. Furthermore, the ultimate
power to interpret Australian constitu-
tional laws rests outside Australia in the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
And the six States of the Common-
wealth are still sovereign within the limits
prescribed or reserved for them in the
Commonwealth Constitution. Indeed,
they are as closely linked to Britain as
the Commonwealth itself, since their
laws provide for appeal from their
higher courts to the Privy Council
and their actions are governed by con-
stitutions derived from and at least
legally subject to the British Parliament.
They are also in a sense more national
than the Commonwealth because of
their control of Crown lands, which, in
some States, form the bulk of their terri-
tories, land being the basis of all power
and nationality.
For all the bluster of demagogues the
cold fact is that while we depend on
British markets for our goods, while the
British Navy and Air Force defend our
trade channels, while Britain is the main
source of our defence methods and
materials, and while Australian defence
forces of necessity are integral with
British forces, as they now are more
nearly than ever before, there could be
nothing save disaster in any loosening of
the bonds of association- between this
country and Britain and the sister
Dominions.
The danger at this stage of history is
not that any break will be brought about
deliberately from Canoerra as a result of
the Government’s excess of national con-
sciousness. Rather it is that the rapid
divergence of Australian governing
methods from British constitutional prac-
tice may lead to Britain drawing away
from association with a concern whose
methods are becoming foreign to its ideals
and adverse to its policies.
It is, for instance, utterly repugnant to
British thought that the King should have
been placed in the position of having to
appoint, to exercise the executive power
and the legislative potver assigned to him,
a rank partisan who, 15 years ago, was
dismissed from the service of the Crown
for having been a party to “illegal action.”
It must likewise be repugnant to the
British Parliament, which jealously guards
its powers and dignity as an inexhaustible
fountain of legislative power and as a
final court of appeal in all lands over
which it has any jurisdiction, to associate
itself in legislative authority with the
Cabinet at Canberra which surrenders its
powers to a secret junta or to any strik-
ing union which cares to assume them
and which has robbed Parliament of
prescriptive prerogatives, such as control
of finance. Under “Labor” the Budget
is now presented for mere registration,
after Caucus —a body unknown to the
Constitution—has sanctioned its most
secret details.
It would be a sad day for Australia if
the links with Britain were further
weakened or if they broke under the
strain. With loss of the present intimate
relationship would go much that makes
for Australia’s prosperity and safety.
Our country would become, in that case,
in reality, what Mr. Chifley and his col-
leagues appear to be bent upon making
it —a lonely small State, like Eire, odd-
man-out with all its white neighbors,
without the population to provide for its
defence without the claims of in-
tegral constitutional association to back
its right of priority to assistance should
the need arise again.
Is the Empire Breaking Up?
There are no doubt accumulating in
many quarters sermons, speeches and
essays on the old theme that it is in the
nature of empires to dissolve or decay.
The British empire has never been with-
out these jeremiads, though in the past
they had no discernible influence op the
course of events.
Our empire, that proud work of time,
was built up by men who, though often
poor, never gave a thought to the
40-hour week, double pay for Sun-
day work, “social security,” or other
features of the now-fashionable regi-
mented life. It survived the loss of the
American colonies (which prompted a
standard poet to mourn it as “a mutilated
structure, soon to fall”) and .the attacks
of Bourbon kings, Napoleon, the last
Kaiser, Hitler and Tojo. It may even
survive its “Labor” Governments, though
they are doing it a power of harm.
As has been here pointed out, nearly
every highflown Babu or dandy colored
coon who condescends to call at 10
Downing-street seems to go away with
a promise of a piece of the empire.
The British garrison has been with-
drawn from Cairo and the Mediterranean
fleet from Alexandria, of immense service
in two great wars. The Sudan is to be
given up as soon as it is decided, some-
how, whether the Sudanese are to be
independent or whether their country is
to be joined to Egypt. A murderous mid-
night war, designed to drive the British
from Palestine and prolonged by “Labor”
feebleness (left to themselves the occupy-
ing forces could settle the business in a
fortnight), is raging in that unhappy
land. Plans for the abandonment of
India have been so far advanced that Mr.
Nehru has set up the simulacrum of “a
sovereign independent republic.” Ceylon
has been handed over, in the main, to
natives in the hope—expressed, if not felt
—that they will dutifully work their pas-
sage towards Dominion status. Malaya
remains, though “anti-Fascists” are busy
there, and the situation is in no way likely
to be improved by “Labor’s” arrange-
ment with the Burmese “nationalists” or
Communists—in these cases, apparently
synonymous terms.
This arrangement has been blessed in
the Commons by Mr. Attlee himself. “It
means,” he said, “that the Burmese have
the right to decide whether or not to stay
within the British Commonwealth”—
they have never been within the British
Commonwealth, but he wouldn’t say
“Empire” for the world. “Does the
statement mean that we pay and we go
or only that we go?” Mr. Churchill
asked in one of his tremendous sentences.
There was no reply.
Inevitably these British “Labor” re-
treats have weakened the position of
friendly nations with possessions in the
part of the world to which Australia
belongs. Witness the report of a com-
mittee of Dutch Parliamentarians on
developments in Indonesia, which Country
they fear “may become an outpost of the
Soviet empire”;
The Premier, Sjahrir, is unconditionally
on the side of the U.S.S.R. Indonesian
nationality, political liberty and even
sovereignty take second place with him.
The situation in Indo-China, according
to the “Times” correspondent at Saigon
and the French High Commissioner,
Admiral Thierry d’Argenlieu, is as bad
or worse. “The French in Indo-China,”
the “Times” correspondent says, “are on
the defensive and there is little they can
do to halt the fighting except capitulate
to the Communist party and leave Indo-
China, which they are not prepared to
do.” And the Admiral, emphasising that
the Vietnamese Government is a
Communist show, states that Indo-China
has become “another battleground be-
tween the Western democracies and
Marxism”;
Communism is now advancing, in South-
east Asia because of disagreements among
the Western nations.
Australia is one of these battlegrounds.
Not in the Indo-China sense, for “Aus-
tralian” Communists are too careful of
their hides to risk armed conflict with a
fighting people still loyal to the British
connection ; but they know tricks worth
two of that. Though doubtless in con-
stant communication with Vietnamese, as
well as the Hukbakalaps df the Philip-
pines and the other savages they call “our
Indernesian comrades,” they have no
need as yet to resort to methods of vio-
lence in this country. For the time being
they can get what they want by trading
on the cowardice of “Labor” Govern-
ments and turning to their own base pur-
poses its scurvy attitude to Britain, evi-
denced last week not only by the Mc-
Kelly-gang appointment, but by the im-
portation of another mass of Jews born
in the same foreign countries as the Jews
who are waging the murder war in Pale-
stine.
With the white-livered acquiescence of
the Federal “Labor” Government, these
Communists have assumed a wicked pro-
tection of their “Indernesian comrades,”
on whose crime-roll is the unpunished
murder of three Australian officers; and
they have encouraged White Australian
girls to consort with coons, with results
damaging to the prestige of the white man
throughout Asia. Similarly, also with
the connivance of the Federal “Labor”
Government, they have strangled Aus-
tralia’s trade with the Dutch East Indies
and tied up a procession of Dutch ships,
even refusing distressed vessels the age-
old humane services of the sea. And they
have brought transport and other essen-
tial services, regardless of whether
or not they are Government-owned,
to a standstill again and again,
always with impunity and always with
threats of further outrages when internal
or public pressure forced a resumption.
In the latest instance they have trans-
ferred to Australia for continent-wide
application a wharf strike started against
the N.Z. Labor Government, and marked
in the beginning by the tying up in
Sydney of an N.Z. Government ship
laden with urgently needed timber.
The ultimatum to Australia was issued
by the general secretary of the Water-
side Workers’ Federation, a Manchester
Irishman. If he had a real Government
to contend with, this ruffian would be
prosecuted under the Crimes Act, and on
conviction —the necessary evidence he has
himself furnished—bundled aboard a
naval corvette and dumped in his country
of origin, where he would soon sink
into insignificance.
Yes, the situation of, and the outlook
for, the British empire look rather bad.
Yet, as has happened so often in the
past, appearances may be deceptive. The
“Labor” Governments, though their
strength looks formidable, are suffering
from internal weaknesses and may not last
out their terms. And when the Babus and
dandy colored coons have exhausted
themselves and their' unfortunate coun-
tries,' there may be a general appeal to
the British to return. For “the word
of an Englishman” is still powerful in
Asia and Africa, and justice and fair
dealing are enshrined among memories
of “British imperialism” which will not
fade.


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Lowest Tammany Job.
On the nomination of a 1917 striker a
1914-18 non-starter has been appointed
Governor-General, as such charged with
the exercise of the executive power and
(with Parliament) the legislative power of
the Commonwealth and with “the com-
mand-in-chief” of its “naval and mili-
tary forces” (God save the mark!).
When notified of his appointment the
1914-18 non-starter was, and had been
for nearly six years. Premier of one of
the six States, and was still a pledged
member of the N.S.W. “Labor” party —
so-called because it is devoted to the
booze and gambling interests —as he had
been for nearly 30 ypars. In short, a
rank partisan, and it was an insult to the
King to place him in the position of hav-
ing to take a rank partisan as his repre-
sentative, especially in view of the rank
partisan’s record.
In 1931-32 the rank partisan, as a
member of the Lang Ministry, was con-
cerned in the measures which resulted in
the closing of the N.S.W. Government
Savings Bank, to the great injury of many
of the King’s loyal subjects. He was a
party to default in payment of interest on
N.S.W. Government loans constitutionally
required under the Financial Agreement
(the loans were supported in Britain be-
cause they werb listed as trustee securi-
ties), and on loans provided by the Com-
monwealth Bank. He listened without
protest to bitter attacks on Britain, one
made by a politician whom he was to re-
ceive into his own Ministry.
And, in common with his colleagues,
he resisted the operation of the Financial
Agreement Enforcement legislation,
though it had been declared consti-
tutional by the High Court, and had thus
become Australian law. As Minister
of Justice (yes, Justice) he was impli-
cated in a savage attempt to extort a
capital levy from mortgagees, Australian
and British ; in Professor Keith’s words,
“so wholly unjust that it is impossible to
regard it as intended for any other pur-
pose than to compel action by the
Governor in order to give the people an
opportunity of showing their attitude to-
wards the Government and the Empire.”
In the end, again in common with his col-
leagues, he was dismissed by the
Governor, Sir Phillip Game—himself, of
course, appointed by the King. The
Governor pointed out that public servants
had been ordered by the Government of
which the rank partisan was a member to
“commit a direct breach of the law’ ;
and, addressing the Premier of whom the
rank partisan was a docile instrument,
the Governor said:
I feel it my bounden duty to remind
you that you derive your authority from
his Majesty, through me, and that I can-
not possibly allow the Crown to be placed
in the position of breaking the law of the
land.
Now, with unconscionable arrogance
Mr. Chifley has placed the Crown in the
position of having to accept as its deputy
at Canberra a man who, with his col-
leagues, was dismissed from his Minis-
terial post for breaking the law of the
Commonwealth.
Many Labor men, as well as all the
members of the Opposition parties, who,
on the evidence of general elections, rep-
resent nearly half the electors, if not now
more than half, object to the elevation oi
this Mr. McKell. The truth is that Aus-
tralia has fallen into the hands of a
crowd which is bent on destroying the
office of Governor-General, which doesn’t
care two straws for the King or for
Britain or the British connection, and
which has inflicted a low Tammany job
on King and country as a sequel to other
low Tammany jobs, the beneficiaries in
all cases being “Labor” politicians.
Down to the Dirt.
No one reading of the activities of Com-
munists and fellow-travellers in these
parts can fail to be impressed by the
number-with Irish names* To give only
a few of many examples, at the head
of the Communist party is a Mr.
Sharkey. The Ironworkers’ Federation
rejoices in a Flanagan and a Donegan.
In the maritime unions and associated
concerns there are four Healys.
One of the Healys arrived ftom Ireland,
via Maoriland, under another name —
McCracken. When he changed it to Healy
he went after an appointment as secre-
tary of the Brisbane Trades and Labor
Council, and, getting it, he took “our
Indernesian comrades” under his protec-
tion, at the same time becoming active in
the boycott of Dutch ships.
In a libel action against the Brisbane
“Courier-Mail,” which he lost, the jury
haying presumably weighed his police
record, Healy, formerly McCracken,
described himself as an atheist. Why did
this fellow choose to become Healy in-
stead of Smith, Jones, Robinson, Camp-
bell or Hogben? He has given no public
explanation, but the explanation may be
guessed.
Being capable of anything, Communists
have raised the sectarian issue. It suits
them to pose as having leaders who have
been converted from the errors of
Catholicism to the truths of Commun-
ism. They have thus secured no incon-
siderable appeal to Protestant zealots in
the unions and in the constituencies.
There is a type of Protestant who hates
Franco more than he hated Hitler. This
kind of support has sometimes misled
Communist candidates in the constitu-
encies, to their astonishment and chagrin,
but it is still serviceable in the unions.
In Europe a mortal struggle is going on
between Communists and Catholics. It
suits Moscow agents to transfer this issue
to a country in which it is entirely out
of place. They have been advantaged
by the fact that Catholic “Labor” poli-
ticians and union leaders in astonishing
numbers (not all, of course) have shown
no more fight than there is in a frilled
lizard, having, in fact, been found willing
to go with the Communists part or most
of the way.
The vast majority of people in Aus-
tralia who hate Communism and would
count everything lost if this country be-
came a servile appanage of Soviet Russia

In Wau Today.
An old resident goes back:
There is something in the way of human
habitation left, but it’s a something no good.
The battered traces of our occupancy are hidden
in crotalaria, secondary growths and pit pit,
but the beauty of its pre-whiteman state has
not returned.* It looks sick and is sick. Bullet-
holed and rusted corrugated iron is salvaged
and domiciles for the returning captains of
industry are created on sites where once
stood clean comfortable dwellings smiling at
the pine-clad mountains. These new structures
do not smile ever; they cower under a mantle
of battered iron and sisalkraft. Yet even while
this doubtful progress is taking place rot and
decay make sturdy progress in other directions.
Bridges are falling into the creek beds, fences
into the undergrowth; roads are becoming im-
passable, kunai and other vegetation steadily
covering up unsightly devastation. And not a
soul in sight to arrest the decline.
To see the callous disregard of this country’s
phenomenal productivity one would imagine
the world’s markets glutted with all require-
ments and nobody anywhere in need. We are
told Australia needs softwoods to build homes
for returned fighting men. Up here we have
countless millions of feet of it —a high-quality
stuff —standing within easy distance of the coast
and in a climate where reafforestation is a simple
science. Yet we are not allowed to cut a
tree down to sell in Australia and we are by
regulation prohibited from owning a vessel
large enough to carry a log out of the country.
If it is the intention of the Government to
hand the country back to the natives it is blindly
succeeding. But where is the sense of it all?
Trouble here is lack of production and no
markets. The old trading gangs are back on
the job but operating only on a cash basis.
The returned Territorians are living on their
capital—never very substantial —and to me it
looks as though chaos is the inevitable result.
There are about six Government officials to
every private individual.
Sounds a bit off, doesn’t it? But we can
still grow kankan and taro, kill a pig occasion-
ally and top off with the best bananas and
pineapples in the world. My wife brought
heaps of lap-lap back with her, and if the worst
comes to the worst we can sit here and watch
the result of Eddie Ward’s biological experi-
ment.
The natives hold over a million in cash and
till they’ve spent it they won’t consider a return
to work.
Indians in South Africa.
When the Australian delegates at U.N.0.,
“acting under instructions from Can-
berra,” abstained from voting on the
matter of the status of Indians in South
Africa and by their abstention allowed
the vote to go against South Africa, they
did more than let down a sister Dominion.
They permitted a precedent to be estab-
lished for the interference of U.N.0.,
which, as Field-Marshal Smuts has
pointed out, is a two-thirds colored
organisation, in the domestic affairs of
any member State.
All political parties in South Africa
are at one on this issue, as on the other
question of the continuance of the present
system of control of South-West Africa.
Dr. Malan, leader of the Nationalist
party, and Mr. Sullivan, the Labor leader,
have both endorsed the attitude taken by
Smuts in New York that the problems
of the Indian community in South Africa
are the concern of South Africa alone.
Forty years ago, when most of the
Indians were indentured laborers, a case
might have been made out for India to
concern herself with their conditions and
welfare—Gandhi and others did in fact
do so and the indenture system came to
an end —but today the position is vastly
different. Eighty-five per cent, of the
Indiahs in the Union were born there and
if their Indian descent is sufficient reason
for Nehru to invoke the interference of
U.N.O. then no country can be free
from similar busybodying —certainly not
Australia.
South Africa’s Indian problem is really
Natal’s problem, since the great majority
of the Union’s 280,000 Indians live in
that province. The men were allowed to
bring their womenfolk and the present-
day population is engaged in diverse
occupations—at the last census the main
headings were agriculture, commercial,
industrial, personal service and trans-
port, in that order. Free schooling is
provided for 35,000 Indian children and
the annual expenditure on education, £lO
per child, is not far below average ex-
penditure in Australia. The Universities
and the professions are open to Indians
on the same basis as Europeans, There
are Indian lawyers, doctors and teachers
practising their professions without hin-
drance.
The attitude of the Union Government
is that it has no intention of oppressing
or victimising the* Indian but that it is
determined that European civilisation
must prevail in the Union. This until
lately was also the policy of Australian
Governments towards colored people in
and out of the Commonwealth, Natal
is an integral part of the Union, developed
by European enterprise. In the labor
necessary for that development the Indian
immigrants helped, but the planning, the
initiative and the vision required were
all European, and it is unthinkable
that the whites in Natal should be pre-
pared to allow their Western culture to be
gradually submerged beneath a trans-
planted Indian one. At present white
and Indian populations of the province
are almost equal in number —there are
also about 2,000,000 Bantu natives —and
the Indian natural increase is much higher
than the European, so the equal rights
claimed for the Indians would inevitably
bring this about.
The vast majority of the Indians who
came to South Africa belonged to the
“untouchables.” They and their descend-
ants enjoy in South Africa a degree of
freedom and security they would never
have achieved in their homeland, and
South Africans feel that they have nothing
to reproach themselves with in their
treatment of their Asiatic minority. They
also feel that it is an impertinence for
Nehru’s India to concern itself with the
matter before it has even begun to solve
its own minority problems.
Australians, bred in the tradition of a
White Australia, would be overwhelm-
ingly in favor of the stand taken by
Smuts —if their “Government” told them
the facts. But in this, as in many other
things vital to this country’s future, the
“Government” tells nothing and leaves
its “policy” to the caprices of one man.
And under instructions from that man
Australian delegates at U.N.O. allowed
South Africa to be outvoted by the
colored and parti-colored nations.
Australia for the white man! For how
long?
Ports of Idle Ships.
When a variety of people, ranging from
the president of a Harbor Board to
various sea-captains, complained about
the time it took to turn a ship round in
ports like Townsville, Cairns and Mackay,
largely because of wharfie strikes and go-
slow methods, the secretary of the Towns-
ville wharfies got up on his hindlegs and
let out the usual roar of contradiction and
denunciation.
But the Townsville Harbor Board had
before it a table showing these figures;
Hours of work: Pre-war, 8 a.m. to 10
p.m.; during the war, 24 hours a day;
at present, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 6 p.m. to
midnight provided night labor is available,
1 a.m. to 7 a.m.—-in emergency only.
Hourly Hourly

Coal Ship to truck by
basket .. ... . • 10 5

The Board, which was contemplating
the spending of large sums on port im-
provements, shuddered as it reflected
that this could mean only that more, and
more ships would avoid the place, as
they are already avoiding Townsville and
other ports. Gloomily it decided to call
a conference of shippers, Harbor Board
and wharfies.
It was then the wharfies’ secretary
hopped in. “Challenging” the Board
president to divulge the source of his
figures, he cited a couple of isolated cases
to “prove” that loading was faster than
before the war, muttered something
about “gross” and “net” working rates
(whatever they are) and produced an
assertion by one of the Healys (the Man-
chester Irishman who has since given
notice of an “overtime strike” to secure
concessions already offered) that Aus-
tralian cargo-handling rates are faster
than in “England, America or New Zea-
land.”
Ail of which, aside from the wintry
smiles it may raise, doesn’t alter facts
which are bothering Queenslanders night
and day: (1) ships are avoiding their
ports as much as possible, (2) when one
does venture in nobody knows when it
will get out again.
Beaten on Points.
A punctured balloon has nothing on
Commo union heads when their bluff
is called by resolute men.
In 1946, when the Commo-led Queens-
land meat strike was called, members of
the Federated Clerks’ Union at Lakes
Creek meatworks stayed at work, their
spokesman being C. A. Swindells. Later
on, all meatworks clerks who had refused
to strike were suspended by their union
for 14 days, and in that 14 days nomina-
tions were called and closed for union
offices. Swindells nominated.
The union executive banned his nomi-
nation on the ground that he was under
suspension and therefore ineligible. A
postal vote of union members defeated
the ban. The bosses rejected the nomi-
nation again.
Thereupon Swindells and his supporters
announced that they would apply to the
Industrial Court for deregistration of the
union. When the union bosses heard of
that they collapsed in three seconds flat
and at a hurried gathering endorsed the
Swindells nomination by 12 to 2. And
the members elected him to the council
of the union—as a delegate from the
central and central-west districts.
Verily is a man with backbone a pain
in the neck to petty tyrants.

CARRERAS LTD. - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL PINTS
When it was thought that the appoint-
ment of McKell as Gee-Gee would be
announced on Australia Day, Sydney
Sunday papers went out of their way to
be kind to him. The expected not hav-
ing happened, “S. M. Herald” was em-
boldened to give a condensed history of
the gentleman’s land transactions, in
two parts. Meanwhile it advised
Chifley to drop him, using obse-
quious terms: “By retrieving the mis-
takes sincerely made the Prime Minister
would gain in prestige.” He could not
possibly have done so, and sincerity is not
in the picture. Sydney journalism may
make no end of an appeal to beach brats
and bookmakers, but courage is no part
of its equipment.
Cataract of misinformation from
Chifley’s press department in attempted
justification of the McKelly job:—■
Sir Bernard Freyb'urg (sic), Governor-
General of N.Z., is native-born,. Sir Pat-
rick Duncan was South African born. So
■was Mr. Gideon B. van Zyl, present Gover-
nor-General of South Africa, who was M.P.
for Sea Point at the time of his appoint-
ment.
Freyberg was bom in London and was
a British soldier for 25 of his 57 yeap.
Duncan was a native of Banffshire, Scot-
land. Ans Van Zyl—a major by the way
—was not “M.P. for Sea Point at the
time of his appointment.” He had been
Administrator of the Cape Province for
three'years, 1942-45.
Two boilermakers disagree about a
third: .
H. Grant, secretary of the Sydney branch
of the union: “The Labor party’s policy
is abolition of such a post. Governors-
General are only figureheads carrying out
no useful purpose. Every boilermaker I
have spoken to, including some who have
worked with Mr. McKell, think the same
way as I do—that it is a sell-out of Labor
policy .V
J. ' O’Toole, Federal secretary of the
union: “We are highly delighted that a
member of our organisation has been
appointed to such an honorable position.”
The gentleman referred to may now ex-
pect an expulsion order from the N.S.W.
branch and a letter of congratulation
from the Federal body.
The arrival of the Hwa Lien party of
Jews from Shanghai unfortunately coin-
cided with the kidnapping of two British
officials in Palestine (one was manhandled)
and with preparations for the introduc-
tion of martial law. While Customs men
were going through the “refugees’ ” lug-
gage, a job which took four days, papers
announced that thrice fortunate members
of the Hwa Lien crowd were “already
settled in flats and cottages secured in
advance for them by relatives.” There-
upon a decent-looking youngster paraded
Martin-place, Sydney, bearing a placard
which read;
Can You Save My Marriage? A Home
for My Wife and Baby Daughter will do
the Tripk. Refugees arriving this week
found flats. Why can’t a returned soldier?
Calvell might know.
From “0.P.H.”:
Apropos of the struggle for the N.S.W.
Premiership, it was like old times to read in
U S. jyi- Herald” that “some Ministers and
members scathingly denounced a prominent
member of the party, in close, association with
the A.L.P. executive, for openly canvassing
for one candidate.” Just on 27 years ago,
when ’State “Labor” got a majority of one
at the polls, the heads drew up a Ministerial
ticket, and those left off it drew up another.
This particular job was done the night before
the ballot, the conspirators gathering under
a tree of knowledge in Centennial Park. Two
of these worthies managed to get their names
on both tickets, and thus reached office. One,
their associates afterwards declared, rushed
back to the No. 1 ticketers with the full story,
but enlightenment did not come till -it was
too late to do anything about it, beyond
swearing as horribly ns Marlborough’s soldiers
in Flanders.
Senator Courtice, Chifley’s Minister of
Commerce, is out with a statement that
sugar rationing may be lifted as soon as
the jam season ends. The man couldn’t
have heard of the Queensland drought or
the wharf strikes in his State which have
tied up thousands of tons of the stuff,
and he must have wondered who was
having him on when a C.S.R. man re-
torted that unless Courtice’s Govern-
ment was “considering repudiating con-
tracts with the British Ministry of Food
we cannot understand the statement.”
Still, there’ll be a lot of this sort of talk
presently, for four “Labor” Govern-
ments are to face their electors, and
“Labor” is desperately in need of some-
thing to sweeten them.
. With ships on the Australian register
persistently disappearing from one cause
and another. Seamen’s Union Commu-
nists are being compelled to modify their
hold-up policy, one feature of which was
refusal of the number of mariners stipu-
lated in the award or its equivalent under
National Security Regs. When the
Government-owned freighter Delamere
was in Brisbane, Elliott, the Communist
secretary of the union, found it necessary
to sign on as a fireman himself; and he
hadn’t been to sea for many years. With
Elliott stoking to thp best of his ability,
the Delamere. struck a full gale for 24
hours, with heavy seas and rain, and
Elliott limped ashore at Sydney a very
angry man, blaming not only the weather
but Queensland coal: “One shovelful was
coal and two were ash.” So retributive
justice doesn’t spare even Communist
union secretaries.
Defying U.N.0., the Union Parliament
has decided to go on ruling “German
South-west” as if U.N.O. had never
existed and also to “reject the request that
South Africa negotiate with the Nehru
‘Government’ on Indian problems in the
Union.” Said Smuts, “Our Asiatic Land
Tenure and Indian Representation Act
must stand if Durban is not to become
a second Bombay,” and Malan, the
Opposition-lfeader, said “If the United
Nations interfere with our sovereignty
the question whether South Africa should
remain a member of U.N.O. must be
thoroughly examined.” That goes, also,
for Australia, when U.N.0., at Nehru’s
instance, interferes in' the White Aus-
tralia policy, as it will. The Australian
“Government” may have cause to regret
that it didn’t side with South Africa, in-
stead of cravenjy turning the sister
Dominion down.
Teddy Needham, “Labor” M.L.A. for
Perth, has had to deny a nefarious rumor
that he was not going up for re-election.
Compared with Joe Silver Collings and
other “LaJbor” worthies, Teddy is absurdly
young—only 72 in the book. He was
M.L.A. for Fremantle in 1904-05 and
was one of the 1906 vintage of Senators.
Of the 17 others elected that year only
Pearce remains aboye ground, and of the
1906 Reps, nearly all are dead, the sole
survivor in politics being the perennial
and inexhaustible Billy.
Elected as an Independent in, 1941,
Storey, M.L.A. for Hornsby (N.S.W.),
joined the Liberals last year, but failed
in the party selection, ballot last week.
However, the Lib. Constitution admits
of .his going up again as “endorsed” can-
didate, the other man, Blaxland, being
the “selected” candidate. This is a much
better arrangement than the discarding of
a member by the votes, of a parcel of
irresponsibles, but there are still many
Libs who don’t care for preselection in
any form.
One of those columnists, reporting that
Martin, the N.S.W. Attorney-General, was
in N.Z. (what grand times Sydney Labor
Ministers have!), asserts that divorce-law
reform will be part of the. Labor election
programme. It never has been and never
will be. The same applies to Federal
Labor, Since 1904 there have been seven
Federal “Labor” Governments, and not
one has availed itself of the constitutional
power to pass divorce apd marriage laws.
Yet all the time there has been need for
them; in fact, an unanswerable case for
uniformity.
, It is like the Trade to expect the r*ich
reward of 10-o’clock closing without
offering the public some consideration.
In unused rooms in Sydney alone, it could
accommodate thousands of houseless ser-
vicemen, forking in with their organisa-
tions, but this simple and necessary pro-
vision, which would be gladly availed of,
did not occur to it. One of the Trade’s
troubles is stupidity, and it has stupid
advisers.
Marshall’s first job as U.S. Secretary
of State was to tell the Communist Polish
Government in a stern communication
that it had failed to carry ouHts solemn
pledge of free elections. The pledge was
given at Yalta and was expressed in most
specific terms. The gang at Warsaw,
egged on by the other gang at Moscow,
betrayed the Polish people and the allied
and associated nations in the most shock-
ing fashion, with crimes of violence
added. It will pay dearly for its perfidy
when the German peace treaty is written.
The Legion of Ex-Servicemen has be-
come active in the cause of the broken
men of the Eighth Division. One of
them with bitter memories of Sandakan,
Outram Road and Changi has in his
misery turned on the self-styled Saviors of
the Country, saying they “never had any
time for a serviceman, even when he was
saving their hide.” Imagination is not
expected of this mob, but it might at least
show some heart, if it has any.
While a beginning was being made at
Canberra with the setting up of a South
Seas Commission ‘‘to promote native
welfare,” a Mr. Moss Hyams, of Sydney,
cast up at Brisbane with the report that
he and friends were establishing “a huge
gambling casino” in New Caledonia. It
is scarcely conceivable that “a huge
gambling casino” would “promote native
welfare,” but Australia can scarcely ob-
ject on that score or apy other. Four
of its five “Labor” Governments run
lotteries, and the fifth wants to.
Sydney housewives,‘having had meat-
less, gasless and soapless weeks, have now
had milk supplies cut. It wasn’t so severe
a blow, however, since Sydney expects
less in the jug and billy every time there’s
a dry week-end in autumn. That, appar-
ently, is what the Milk Board is for.
Anyone loafing around Sydney
Botanical Gardens on Thursday might
have seen the British refrigerated ship
Perthshire being moved upstream by tugs.
She had come from Queensland meat
ports, where trouble in getting her space
filled led the skipper to go off pop:
We may return to England without being
fully loaded There is no special reason
why vessels like mine should come to Aus-
tralia at all for frozen meat; they can be
more profitably employed working between
the United Kingdom and Argentina.
A significant statement, but unlikely to
stir either the Commo crowd or the
Ghifley crowd.
It could only happen here:
In December the ship Sarpedon was dis-
charging cargo at Sydney before going' on to
Brisbane when Chinese crew members, got at
by the usual Comraos, found they didn’t like
the anchor color ok something and walked off.
They were prosecuted, so the Commo-led
wharfies’ union declared the cargo black.
Presently the Qupngs were put -aboard and the
ship took them to Singapore. There the Bris-
bane cargo was transferred to the Glenartney
and carried to Brisbane, where —no longer
“black” —it was unloaded. The moral seems
to be that no Asiatic need go short of a
brother while Corn's run, Australia.
Getting off to an early election start
Pie, leader of the Q.P.P., said that the
“Labor” Government, if returned, in-
tended to provide defeated and retired
members with life pensions of £3OO p.a.
after six years in Parliament. He wondered
if Premier Hanlon would have the
“courage” to announce it as part of
“Labor” policy.. Why not? Everybody
* knows that high pensions for beatenj
State “Labor” politicians and good jobs
for beaten Federal ones are now among
those “ ‘Labor’ principles.”
According to a lady who is on'the
strength of their Commo-led union, Syd-
ney lottery-office clerks are “fed up.”
Their conditions are, in fact, “terrible,”
and unless the “Labor” Government
abolishes Saturday-morning work they’ll
hold a stop-work meeting. A state of
affairs calculated to stir the sympathy of
every man in the drought country toiling
round the clock to keep his stock alive
and every housewife desperately trying
to feed and clothe her family. Still, no
matter how “terrible” conditions in Gov-
ernment employment become, nobody
ever leaves it.
Queenslanders on holiday in southern
Queensland districts have had another
eye-opener about their Transport Act.
Floods having stopped trains, the Gov-
ernment was forced to permit buses to
be used, and the stranded people dis-
covered that the jdurney home was much
faster and more comfortable than it
would have been in the bumbling old
Government trains.
Announced from London that the
Board of Trade has put a sudden stopper
on the importation of Australian books
other than non-fiction. Nasty; but per-
haps the Boafd heard of the impending
publication in book form of “9. M.
Herald’s” prize novels and desired to save
the sorely-tried British people from
horrors which they are in no, condition to
bear with fortitude. Or the British Gov-
ernment may be getting a bit of its own
back for Canberra’s mean enticement of
its essential tradesmen.
The British Parliament reassembled on
January 21 to deal with one of the
heaviest programmes of bills which it
has ever faced —Conscription and
Transport, Agriculture, Town and
Country Planning, Electricity, Pen-
sions Increase, Malta Reconstruction
(£20,000,000 is to be added to £10,000,000
voted during the siege), Redistribution of
Seats and some other measures. It will'
take six months’ solid work to cover it
all and, of course, many members of
both sides of the House have put in
months of committee work already. If
the Canberra crowd did six months’ solid
work in the next five years the electors
would die of shock.
For years past fish-starved Brisbaneites
have been mocked by a neon sign outside
the Government-run fishmarket at Vic-
toria Bridge. Displaying the picture of
a fine fat snapper, it twinklingly exhorts
them to Eat More Fish. Meanwhile, the
Fish Board does all that it can think up
to discourage fishermen from keeping
supplies going. The recent flood in the
Brisbane River must have seriously a'n-
noyed the Board when it brought down
splendid supplies of bream, rpullet, crabs
and prawns, strangled to helplessness
by the fresh water and collected
free of all market charges by hundreds
of eager citizens armed with hand-nets,
gaffs, baskets and even bare, hands. At
a rough estimate at least a hundred tons
of first-rate fishfood must have evaded
payment within three days.
Plans have been completed by the Vic-
torian Housing Commission to accommo-
date 2822 people on John Wren’s Ascot
racecourse at a cost of £1,150,000; over
£4OO per person, including babies. Hous-
ing Minister Barry calls it a great contri-
bution to the relief of the housing short-
age.
One little nation which is sad about
Indian “independence” is Nepal, which is
anxious that its stout soldiers shall not
be deprived of the right to serve the
British Raj. Gurkha pre-war strength of
20 battalions rose to 40 battalions during
the war, and the little brown men won
more V.Cs. in proportion to strength
than any other British Imperial or Com-
monwealth force. They have reverted to
pre-war establishment, and are being
used mainly to guard the North-west
Frontier and keep order in India. One
thing is certain —they won’t fight for
Nehru.

‘Pitt St.”: Some time ago I corrtmented
in these columns on the foolishness of
allowing Sydney’s widest and best
thoroughfare. Martin-place, to become a
sort of landing ground for airline and
road-tourist buses. It’s become worse
since then. Now the pedestrian, having
successfully got by crowds of people
standing round their luggage outside the
various transport offices, still has to dodge
small crowds around the tables of lottery-
ticket sellers and customers of street-
photographers, to say nothing of the
frequent cigarette, chocolate and restaur-
ant queues which block the pavement.
Any day I’m expecting to be asked to
show a pass or something before I’m let

“Findy”; In the war for the shekels

most of the milestones of the life of man
seem to have been exploited. Births,

golden weddings, diamond weddings,
deaths, funerals and in memoriam notices
are included in the Hatched, Matched and
Dispatched columns of most dailies, and
the other day I spotted a new one—a

“0.G.”: While sharing “Ike Hollar’s”
pang of regret that many of the church
bells destroyed by bombs in England will
not be restored (B. 15/1/ ’47), I think his
imagination was playing tricks when he
wrote of “Adelaide drowsing in the sun
with the church bells singing in peace-
timing harmony.” In all South Australia
there is only one active peal of bells, that
of St. Andrew’s, Walkerville, Adelaide
Town Hall has a set, but they can’t be
rung owing to the chiming mechanism of
the clock. Frederick Lakeman left
£lO,OOO for a peal at St. Peter’s Cathe-
dral ; it is now in position but
will not be heard until after the dedica-
tion next June. A few years ago St.
Augustine’s, Unley, went for a set of
tubular bells, mechanically operated, and
Brougham Place Congregational has re-
cently begun to broadcast recordings of
famous peals, but pealing bells have
never been a background for Adelaide’s
Sabbath calm.

“Honk”: When a policeman points to-
wards the kerb and bellows “Pull over,”
thfe motorist usually sinks mentally to the
size of his throttle-button. He sits there
wishing he could disappear down his
petrol-feed, and waits as the law strides
majestically across, holding a notebook
at the end of its long arm. Encircled by
a sea of leering faces the driver hope-
. lessly shows hfis licence, mutters “Thank
you, officer,” and starts off again, usually
in reverse. All the way home he will be
cursed by other motorists for crawling
along at five miles per. He can usually
take food again after a few days, and
really robust cases have been known to
smile at the end of a fortnight. This,
however, would not be so with the un-
happy motorist in Pasadena (U.S.A.)
whose world began to collapse about him
whep he bumped into the back of a truck.
When asked by the John on duty how
good nis brakes were, he replied, “I’ll

“G.M.”: The A.I.F. had no monopoly
on efficiency when it came to wills
(“Xenfexer,” B. 22/1 /’47). The war had
been in progress three years when the
R.A.A.F. decided it was time I made out
a will. Having done this before enlisting
it was only necessary for me to sign a
declaration to the effect, giving the
address of my next-of-kin who held the
document. Fourteen months after my
discharge, I received a large registered
envelope containing this newsy declara-
tion, and a covering letter asking me to
acknowledge receipt! My wife, who has

Camsa”: As a “Daily Express” staff-
man, let me correct “Niloc” (B. 15/1/’47)
in his assessment of how our cricket
writer reports a Test. Deadline for dis-
patch of cables is noon to catch the last
(4 a.m.) edition in London ; thereafter he
has all day to look at the match without
typing a word. In the evening he sends
his comment, limited to about 300 words
a day. With three Reuter’s Agency men
on the job, plus beam and short-wave,
special cricket writers do hot cover de-
tails like fall of wickets and ball-to-ball
descriptions. Frequently the “Daily Ex-
press” cricket writer doesn’t use the press
box, and he rarely uses his typewriter.
Moreover, he writes cricket all the year
round for a newspaper with a circulation
of nearly 4,000,000 a day, and one with
the reputation of paying fabulous salaries
to specialists, so presumably he does
know something about the game. Two of
his observations disclose cricket common-
sense: he commends our scoreboards to
English clubs and he condemns Aus-
tralian crowds for massing opposite the
pitch instead of at the ends-—the best
position from which to follow the play.
A London paper, with its average of five
pages a day, gives less space to an entire
Test match than Australian papers give
to one day’s play. It is local scribes
with columns and columns to fill who
clutter and clatter in the press box.
Vantas”; That W. G. Grace letter
was a fake (“Findy,” B. 25/12/’46). It
was the invention of a Melbourne journa-
list, Richard Egan Lee, known as “The
Human Skeleton.” Grace had a short way
with reporters, and probably Lee had
suffered. If so, he more than squared
the ledger with the letter, which was
written for a joke. Grace was kept busy
for years denying authorship, but, as he
was unpopular in this country, it is doubt-
ful whether many believed him. Lee’s
reference to Grace’s “pecuniary interest”
was an unkind cut, but it is probable
that in his time Grace made more money
out of the game than any professional.

“Captain Pintle”; February 5 will be
the 144th anniversary of the strangest sea
(mystery in Australian history. On that
day in 1803 Dr. George Bass sailed from
Sydney in the brig Venus to carry out ex-
ploration work on the west coast of
South America. Neither the Venus nor
any of her company was ever heard of
again. Rumors of the capture of the
ship by the Spaniards and enslavement
of her company in Peruvian mines were
put about in later years, but were unsup-
ported by any reliable evidence. Bass
was then 40. Eleven years later Flinders
died in England, also at 40, a broken man
after more than six years of military
captivity in Mauritius by the French.

“Puyyaka”: “Hacksaw’s” dissertation
on twins (B. 22 /1 / ’47) and the “well-
known phenomenon” of their sticking to-
gether and copying each other’s habits
would gain loud ha-ha’s from one pair
of my acquaintance. One of them is
6ft. 2in., of slim, graceful build and pos-
sessor of a fine tenor voice. The other,
born 20 minutes later, is sft.* 7in., with a
chest like a bull and a basso to match.

gingery, and his outlook on liquor and
tobacco liberal in the extreme. Both

“McGlum”: On Ambon and Hainan I
saw many brave acts, but for sheer perve
a Dutchman earned first prize. Jap
papers were the only source of news
available, and they were as scarce as
hen s teeth. When the Allied landing
in France was expected the Dutch-
man was on a work-party at Jap H.Q.
Latrines, rubbish-bins and incinerators
yielded nothing in the way of news, and
then someone reported a sheet in the
Big Shot’s office. Dutchy went after it.
He crawled through the half-open door,
only to see a shining pair of jackboots
right under his nose—the notorious Cap-
tain Kondo was asleep in his chair.
Dutchy kept crawling, reached his objec-
tive, grabbed, heard the warning whistle
from his mates and dived through the
open window with a terrific clatter just
as a running Jap burst through the door.
The Jap was bashed for rudely disturb-
ing Kondo, and we got the paper. In
no time the translation came through and
we learned that the Normandy landing
was a fact.

“V. Cluse”; Somebody at the boarding-
house up the road taught his pup to
retrieve the morning paper from the front
lawn. After its duty one morning the
pup went for a walk, saw other papers
on other lawns and retrieved them, too.
Jephson and his neighbors, searching for
their papers, discovered a heap of them
on the boarding-house lawn. They
thought it was amusing and called the pup
affectionate names. But after five or
six trips up the road for his paper Jeph-
son stopped laughing and protested to the
large young man who owned the pup.
The argument waxed until the large young
man said, softly and hopefully, “You
wouldn’t be talkin’ fight, would you?”
Jephson withdrew. He thought of# the
police, the nuisance inspector and other
things, but feares ridicule. For a while,
like his neighbors, he arose early enough
to beat the pup to the paper, but the in-
justice of the thing rankled. One even-
ing Mrs. Jephson asked him to carry to
the front gate a large bag full of waste
paper, to be collected by a hospital salvage
carter. Jephson looked at the bag, called
his offspring and for an hour they worked
on that waste paper. Next morning a
vast heap of rolled papers appeared on the
boarding-house lawn and since then the
pup has been strictly confined to the rear
of the premises.

“S.S.”: The two troop trains were
halted side by side. One was going
north with Aussies, the other was bring-
ing Yanks down. Remarks were bandied
back and forth until one of the Yanks
asked the inevitable question: “Any
whisky?” Blue said he thought he could
rustle some up, and he withdrew his head
and went on a search. Returning presently
with a full bottle, he handed it over
and received 20 dollars in payment. The
two trains proceeded on their way. Blue
sat with the fistful of notes in his hand,
laughter issuing from his dial. “Cold tea,”
he said. “Twenty dollars for a bottle of
cold tea. How’s their form? - ” When his
mates’ mirth had quietened down, Blue
said: “We’ll whack up the roll now.”
He peeled off the outside note, a dollar
bill. The rest were all marked “Play
money” —they were from some toy bank
set.

“R.M.”: Arnold Wall’s verse (B.
22/1/’47) asks: “Who likes cabbage?”
Cabbage is a name with a special mean-
ing in the clothing trade, slop-suit branch.
Using the designer’s pattern the number
of garments the cutter should get from
any given quantity of material is known,
but by an almost imperceptible narrowing
of a sleeve or a trouser leg, by cribbing
a fraction of an inch in length here and
there, the savings amount in time to an
unbroken roll of cloth known as cabbage
which a cutter who knows his onions
can sell to a blackmarketeer. Who likes
cabbage?

“Jasby”: One of the last places one
would look for humor is among the pages
of the Manual of Military Law, but in
the section devoted to specimen charges
I have found - several items that deserve
at least a grin. I suppose I should
despise, but instead I sympathise with,
the imaginary soldier who
when under the enemy’s fire, fell but of
the ranks, ran away, and secreted himself
under a bank.
And I admire the resource of the other
fictitious bloke who
during an attack left the ranks without
orders from his superior officer on pretence
of taking to the rear Lieutenant Blank, who
was wounded.
I’m all for the chap who
while serving in Egypt assaulted Hassan
Fellaheen, an inhabitant of Egypt.
And, having sampled some pretty poor
Army grub in my time, I can’t help feel-
ing that the private who
assaulted a sutler who was bringing into
camp bread and vegetables for the use of
the troops
probably had good reason for his action.
There may be more than meets the eye in
the charge of “disgraceful conduct of a
crdel kind” made against Private Blank.
Just what led up to the moment when he
“cruelly ill-treated a cat by throwing it
against the wall”? Then there’s the case
of the bombsie who,
when placed in the custody of Police-
constable Drip, struck with his waist-belt,
on the head, the said police-constable.
After all, what are waist-belts for? Which
brings me to my favorite private, the
hero who,
• When personally ordered by Captain Dash,
upon Commanding Officer’s parade, to take
up his rifle and fall in, did not do so,
divesting himself at the same time of his
waist-belt, and saying “I’ll soldier no mtfre,
you may do what you please!”
There can’t be many Diggers who haven’t
felt like that on C.O.’s parade.

“J.D.”; * Another aptitude test (B.
15/1/’47). Discharged after service with
the Commandos in the Northern Terri-
tory, Timor, N.G. and Borneo, the
youngster wrote home. “Fair dinkum,
Mum, you wouldn’t read about it. They
have had me sticking pegs into little
holes, fitting bits of different shaped wood
together, and all manner of other kin-
dergarten tricks. Wonder what they will
do to me if they find out I was too dumb
to have ever been passed into the army
at all.”
A TACTFUL VISCOUNT.
“Viscount Bruce, before deciding to be ‘of Mel-
bourne,’ submitted his choice of a title to the Mel-
bourne City Council for the approval of that body.”
A graceful gesture, Stan, worth emulation
Whenever possible, although it’s clear
Such methods of obtaining approbation
Aren’t always open to a brand-new peer.
When Nelson chose to make The Nile a vital
Part of his rank, he couldn’t, safe to assume,
Call on the river to endorse his title
Or Kitchener do ditto with Khartoum.
Most new-fledged noblemen on such occasions
Pitch on some pleasant place to feed their
pride
With which they know —or cherish fond per-
suasions—
Their ancestors ware once identified,
Some word with Norman or with Saxon flavor
Tickles their fancy. Not for them the task
Of finding if the spot regards with favor
Their choice. There may be no one there
to ask.
Still, in the face of Bruce’s exhibition
Of tact, won’t Gowrie feel a twinge of shame
For never seeking Canberra’s permission
To make it an appendage to his name?
A mere formality, since acquiescence
Can always confidently be foretold,
And who is there that grudges costless presents
Which, even if you wished,* you couldn’t
withhold?
In climbing, Stan, to the exalted station
That now you fill, with all thereby that’s
meant,
You may have introduced an innovation,
Sponsored, for all I know, a precedent.
Yet there’s a brother Viscount, one Mount-
batten
Scheduled “of Burma,” whom ’twill hardly
please
To think he blundered, before getting that in
His list, in net consulting the Burmese.
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Bamekaw”: Mention of “potential
officers” (B. 15/l/’47) reminds me of a
discussion between my C.O. and his
staff. The unit had bcten asked to send
an n.c.o. with “intelligence, initiative and
qualities of leadership” as a candidate
for an officers’ school. The R.S.M. was
first named. “Certainly not,” said the
Old Man, “the unit revolves round him.
Couldnlt do without him. What about
the staff clerk?” “No chance,” said the
adjutant. “He’s got the Q-store sewn
up. Too good a man to lose.” “Well,
there’s Sgt. Basher, one of our best in-
structors,” “If ever this unit goes into
action,” said the C. 0., “I want men like
Basher in it. Can’t have the men under
nitwits.” “How about Cpl, Bamekaw?
He’s a uni. product.’’ The adjutant ob-
jected again. “Key man in the orderly-
room. Must keep him.” So it went on.
Eventually someone said “There’s only
that dopey lance-jack left; the drongo
we’ve got off-siding for the hygiene cor-
poral. He’s surplus on the W.E.” “Just
the man we can spare,” said the Old
Bloke. “Give him his second stripe, and
tell him to be ready to march out at 0800
tomorrow.” Thus was another officer and
gentleman made.

“Butt Bott”: A regular monthly event
which appears to have become a part of
the calendar is the backing and filling
of apologists for the tobacco shortage.
In January it opened with an announce-
ment that supplies for February would be
105 p.c. of the basic year for cigarettes
and 90 p.c. for tobacco. Just when every-
body began to look for the increase, a
retailers’ organisation said it wasn’t so,
and anyway retailers’ supplies were often
well below the quantity annouhced by the
manufacturers. There was a barney, duly
written up in the press, but it made not
the slightest difference to the poor old
public. It is as hard as ever it was to
buy smokes legitimately, as easy as ever
it was to buy ’em on the blackmarket.
The Government? It collects its thump-
ing tax whenever and however a packet
changes hands.

“Snowball”: Q.Ms, are notorious for
their reluctance to issue anything new,
but the cove I’m thinking about beat
them all. On Bougainville our C.S.M.*
Old Fred—only 30, but 10 years older
than the rest of the mob —was looking
for a spot for Coy. H.Q., when he set off
a booby trap. Two months in hospital
saw his multiple wounds in good shape,
except for one in the leg, which refused
to heal. A trip back to thfe mainland,
countless X-rays, and thousands of grains
of sulpha drugs couldn’t improve it, and
there was talk of amputation. A final
probe was decided upon, and out came
the seat of the trouble —a portion of
Fred’s jungle-green trousers, which hadn’t
shown on the X-ray. And I’m told the
Q.M. refused to issue a replacement with-
out actually seeing that the trousers were
unfit for further wear.

“Clooter”: When my morning papers
began to tell me ab’out a deeply secret
operation in which the C.S.I.R. was
alleged to be dropping “dry-ice” pellets
on clouds in order to precipitate rain,
with hints of armed fighter ’planes on
guard and desperate attempts by reporters
to “get the story,” I thought there was
a familiar ring about it. Then some-
body suggested that the big hailstorm
which hit my city on New Year’s Day,
smashing thousands of windows and roof-
ing tiles, was really the experimenters at
work, and somebody else remarked on
the subsequent drought and suggested that
the carbon dioxide in the upper air had
created a vacuum and sucked all the
clouds away to Antarctica or somewhere.
Nobody had really sighted the mystic
’plane or found a C.5.1.R., man, in dis-
guise or otherwise, sneaking about with
pockets full of “dry ice,” but the story
persisted until last week, when a C.S.I.R.
spokesman said it was “all moonshine
and that the newspaper stories had re-
(
“ You’ve taught me a lot , professor , but I think I could teach you
something.”
suited in a lot of trusting cockies writing
in with demands for the spraying of “dry
ice” over their areas. It was then that
the familiar ring became a gong and into
my head rushed memories of Russian
scientists and their false teeth for cows,
sheep which shed their wool every year,
perennial wheat, other “triumphs of
Stalinist thought, hoorah!” and the ap-
pointment of that well-known scientist
Don Mountjoy, an ardent admirer of the
Russkis, as an “officer” of the C.S.I.R.
Could there be a connection?

“Pink Tape”: We owe Germany
grudges over other matters than those
usually mentioned. When Von Luckner
was in Australia he demonstrated his
strength to some admirers by tearing a
telephone book in halves. ( Thereafter
young bloods from Sydney to Alice
Springs suffering from booze and vain-
glory invited their friends to the nearest
telephone booth to watch them do the
same. The silly habit has persisted, to the
great inconvenience of people who want
to use the books for the orthodox pur-
pose. The P.M.G. might make a bit of
extra money and serve public convenience
by placing a penny-in-the-slot cabinet with
a phone book inside in association with
every public phone. Vandals have cheap
souls and would probably jib at parting
up a penny.
“O’Took”: Having been singularly
free from industrial trouble for two
weeks, Darwin returned to normal when,
with the arrival of s.s. Murada,
the wharfies went out on strike.
Trouble arose over sanitary -conditions ;
as pointed out by the local union-con-
trolled rag, public health was being

menaced by inadequate washing facilities
preventing wharfies from washing their
hands before handling foodstuffs —if
that’s not worth 7s. 6d. as a joke idea my
sense of humor’s gone blunt. The strike
dragged on till Friday, when, with two
days of double pay ahead, the wharfies
decided to return to work. However, by
this time the shipping firm had moved
the Murada out into the stream, where she
stayed for the week-end. Came Monday
■and the prospect of badly-needed sup-
plies being unloaded, but all labor in the
town took the day off as a means of
hurrying along Arbitration Court pro-
ceedings 2000 miles away. In the morn-
ing, union m'embers slouched through
the streets waving hessian banners in-
scribed with slogans about shorter hours
and higher pay. After the “procession”
union leaders dismissed the men and a
general movement was made for the pub,
where a good day was had by all. And
now we’re to have a new £420,000 wharf.
Well, it’ll be just as good to strike on as
the old one.

“Curtain Raiser”; Amateur actors (B.
22/1/’47) don’t always lack resource. In
a piece put on in Melbourne,
Beresford Fowler, entertaining a visitor,
asked him what he would have
to drink and he chose whisky. No cold
tea was available, so the daughter of the
house returned with a bottle and a de-
canter both containing water. “I couldn’t
find the whisky, dad,” she said, “so I
brought the gin,” and pouring a small
portion out of one receptacle she filled
the glass up from the other. On another
occasion the villain was to fall dead when
a shot sounded offstage. The stage re-
volver was out of order and Beresford
rushed out into Collins-street and called
in a policeman from his beat. The re-
sultant report nearly shattered the tiny
playhouse.

“D’Artagnan”: The Rising Sun badge
worn by the soldiers of two wars is com-
monly believed to have been designed
for the first A.I.F. In the design now
known this is possibly correct, but its
immediate ancestor was the badge
adopted for the First Australian
Commonwealth Contingent, afterwards
the First Australian Commonwealth
Horse, a mounted regiment recruited
in N.S.W. towards the end of 1901.
It sailed in March, 1902, and saw
only a couple of months’ service. Capt.
Cox Taylor (afterwards Colonel on the
General Staff) was adjutant, and he and
Capt. Soane (Q.M. of the permanent
staff) designed the badge, which had a
crown with a frieze of alternate bayonets
and sabres. I remember Major-General
Hutton discussing it with Lieut.-Col.
Lyster, C.O. of the Regiment, Major M.
A. Lee, Capt. Cox Taylor and Capt.
Soane—l was on duty in the orderly-room.
General Hutton made a facetious com-
ment to this effect: “Well, Lyster, your
badge is all right, but it does somewhat
seem as though you were pinching a
badge from the people of the Rising Sun
—the Japanese.” In view of later events
it would appear that we have made good
our claim to the badge.

“Loc”: In the biggest round-up in
America’s history—it occurred during the
week after Pearl Harbor —the F. 8.1.
carried out 26,000 raids, and unearthed
nfearly 5000 firearms, over 300,000 rounds
of ammunition and enough dynamite to
make quite a sizable bang. Those aliens
not actually corralled were ordered to
hand in any doubtful items which they
possessed, and the Government sat back
awaiting the arrival of such things as
radio-transmitters, cameras and maps of
military installations. These duly turned
up, but with them came goods ranging
from bows and arrows to a pint of
cough mixture. Amongst the oddments
were boys’ chemistry sets, hunting jackets,
cases full of rubber-bands, two toy
balloons, and a supply of cap-pistols that
ran into thousands. Now the Depart-
ment of Justice is trying to give this
“contraband” back to its original owners,
but can find few takers. .

“C. Sandy”: “Puyyaka” (B. 15/1/’47)
omitted crime detection from the uses of
hyoscine. The drug, in association with
morphia, brings about a mental state
which makes the patient unable to tell
a lie. At times in susceptible individuals
it has undesirable effects in that, even in
as low a dose as 1-150 grain, it causes
forgetfulness. Given in a case of hic-
cough, in which it acts like a charm, one
patient, forgetting that he had driven into
town with the car shod with four new
tyres, returned home by train and went to
bed. At 3 a.m. he awoke with memory
restored and put in a frantic ’phone call
to the G.P. to get on the track of his
deserted car,

“Spasebo”: There is another aspect of
Russian rhusic besides that of her great
composers which may have been affected
by political changes (B. 22/1/’47). Cross-
ing Siberia and Russia in 1914 I heard
music from Vladivostok to Petrograd. It
was the music of the people, which has also
been the inspiration of men like Tschai-
kowsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and others. It
was sung by peasants and soldiers, who
would break spontaneously into song on
every possible occasion, apparently with-
out any direction. Every man seemed to
know his part and the music was by no
means simple. I heard the folk songs
of the nation from one end of the coun-
try to the other and the tyranny of the
Tsars didn’t seem to suppress the singers.
I can’t help wondering how the Soviet
workers would sing now after a few
years, of modern industry and mass pro-
duction. I recently heard some of the
marching songs of the Red Army over
the air and apart from a few traditional
airs they sounded like “Roll Out the
Barrel” and “Tipperary.”

“C. 8.”: The case of the man from
Noradjuha (Vic.) who shifted his house
to Horsham only to find that there was
a house on the allotment he owned and
believed to be vacant recalls a similar
example of misinterpreted plans and titles
which occurred in Melbourne. A Mil-
dura resident bought a suburban block
during one of the city’s recurrent land
booms. Twenty years later he was down
in Melbourne and thought he would go
and have a look at his land. He was
astounded to find a Catholic school
flourishing on it. There had been a mis-
take in the surveying, a reasonable
arrangement was come to and the school
remained where it was. The man at Hor-
sham still has his house on wheels and
nowhere to put it.

“Strict Veg.”: Just-dead Andrew Vol-
stead, the Minnesota Congressman who
originated the amendment which brought
in prohibition and produced an era of
violence unprecedented in U.S. history
and a special class of criminal, was quoted
in a Melbourne cafe argument as an ex-
ample of the benefits of cold tea he
lived to 87. A returned airman chipped
in with a story. He was quartered in an
Italian village when an old man, alleged
to be 120 and a total abstainer, died. A
politician with un-Italian ideas on drink
and diet was delivering an oration at the
graveside, and citing deceased as an ex-
ample of the fact that absention from
wine was a recipe for longevity, when a
tall figure stumbled through the cemetery
gates and collapsed on the footpath.
“Disgusting,” said the politician. The
man’s dead drunk. Somebody remove
him.” “You can’t do that,” whispered a
townsman. “He’s like that every day of
his life. Hb couldn’t have attended the
funeral sober and he has a right to be
here. He’s the dead man’s elder brother.”
MONTY’S RECIPE.
“In an address at Sandhurst, Field-Marshal Mont-
gomery said that the main obstacle to full under-
standing between Britain and Russia was the language
difficulty. It had been decided, therefore, that Sand-
hurst students should learn Russian.”
You pedants who insist that Greek and Latin
Are vital subjects for receptive youth.
Along with various ’ologies, paste that in
Your hats for an indisputable truth.
Whether you’re pacifist or mildly jingo,
It doesn’t signify a tinker’s cuss;
You’ve got to understand the Russian lingo
To understand the Russ.
There seems no valid reason why the teaching
To merely military schools should be
Confined. The process surely should be reaching
To several other hives of industry.
Our budding diplomats and our potential
Evatts —can they negotiate for us
Without the knowledge Monty deems essential
To comprehend the Russ?
Maybe with an enlarged vocabulary
Maloney, whom we sent across the globe,
Might have returned from his itinerary
More of a Russophile than Russophobe.
If Slav with French and German could be tabled
For modern studies what a stimulus
’Twould give to means whereby we are enabled
To measure up the Russ!
Still, it’s an insufficient preparation
For mutual understanding, I should say,
A poor suggestion for co-operation,
The remedy that only works one way.
If talks with Molotov could be conducted
Better, were Russian speech within our powers,
Couldn’t his crowd in fairness be instructed
To get a grip on ours?

THE SERVICE MAN
The Dwindling R.A.N.
“Ek Dum”: Rear-Admiral Farncomb,
one of the two flag-officers appointed
from among Jervis Bay graduates, came
home last week in the sea-tired Bataan,
newest of the Tribal-class destroyers, in
which he has been flying his flag on the
China coast and in Japanese waters.
As commander of the Australian Far
Eastern Squadron he has little to rejoice
over.
“Australia,” he remarked, “is com-
mitted to keeping one cruiser and one de-
stroyer in Japanese waters, and we have
only two cruisers and six destroyers to
maintain that force. In addition, we have
our frigates in New Guinea waters and
doing jobs around Australia, and we must
keep ships at sea for training purposes.
Crews of all ships have been reduced
to three-fifths of their war-time strength.
The rear-admiral might have added
that all Australia’s cruisers are now out
of date, having been reconstructed again
and again, sometimes after heavy enemy
battering and long straining voyages. One
of them had one of her turrets of eight-
inch guns removed during the latter part
of the war. All not obsolete are obsoles-
cent, and should see the end of their
service within the next three or four years.
No provision has been made to re-
place them. The present naval building
programme is a feeble thing.
Britain and Atoms.
“Ek Dum”: Poor old Britain! Miser-
able old John Bull struggling with debts
and hunger, “Palestinians,” “Govern-
ments” of the Chifley type and a horde
of jealous “allies”!
The Americans won their war; the
Russians won their war ; and now Aus-
tralia, whose “Government” went down
on its bended knees and begged Britain to
send 25 divisions at once to defend our
soil in 1942, has {vide Mr. Makin)
wrested “world leadership” from Britain.
The Australian “Government” does not
think it worth while to send Britain a
little food as a national gift, though it
eagerly accepts and makes political capi-
tal out of British gratitude for the million
pounds raised by public subscription in
Australian cities in a cause which the
“Government” opposed.
Yet every now and then a gleam shines
through which raises doubts as to whether
the poor old war-weary, bomb-battered
little island, with the weight of all the
world’s troubles and the curses of. all the
world’s tyrants and demagogues upon its
head, is really done.
This suspicion arises again and again
as one regards its performances in war.
For years before 1939 Germany was
rocking with laughter at British policy in
the air. Silly old John Bull appeared to
b& doing nothing at all. But when the
test came it was discovered that he had
invented radar; he had every kind of
prototype aircraft in the air ready for
adjustment to whatever conditions sug-
gested the best line of development; he
had had rocket guns for years before the
Russians were boasting of their crude
efforts ; above all, he had a Navy, in such
condition that it proved the deciding
factor in the war, as has been admitted by
Grand Admiral Doenitz, and set the
standards for all World War II naval
methods. And now, in the Vanguard, he
has the world’s most powerful fighting
ship.
Atom Development
The first atom bomb was built by the
Americans and dropped by the Ameri-
cans. But the, scientific development of
the work had been done not by either the
Americans or by Professor Oliphant
alone, but mainly by a large battery of
European scientists (nearly all British)
who had the principles well laid down be-
for the U.S.A. came into the picture.
It would have been impossible under
war-time conditions of congestion in
Britain to carry on even large-scale pilot-
plant experiments there. The U.S.A. was
chosen because of its resources, technical
and otherwise, and because of its wide-
open spaces, just as Australia has been
chosen for long-distance rocket experi-
ments because of its wide spaces and long
distances without population.
And it has now been stated in the Lon-
don “Daily Express”—and so far not
denied—that uranium in large quantities
is already being processed for use in a
plant, to be built by the atomic-energy
commission in Yorkshire or Scotland,
which will produce about a fourth of
Britain’s electrical power from uranium.
And if that is on the tapis, Britain’s
atomic position is certainly all right.
Almost on the same day there was a
significant admission from the American
aircraft industry: the Old Dart was 18
months ahead in producing jet-propelled,
large-scale liners and had achieved a lead
too long to be overtaken.
At the same time it became known
that British shipyards were building nearly
one-half the world’s shipping under con-
struction, peace-time ships needing to be
built to last.
One effect of the war has been that
many countries, such as Norway, are
turning more and more to the British for
ships. As things are going the United
Kingdom is steering towards playing, in
ten years, a more dominating naval and
mercantile marine role than ever.
War in North China.
“Ek Dum”: After months of patient
attempts to bring the Chinese National
Government and the Chinese Com-
munists together the United States Gov-
ernment has decided to let the Chinese
fight it out.
This was inevitable, since the Com-
munists had no intention of compromis-
ing, whatever was done, unless they could
compromise on such terms that they
would have the upper hand and ulti-
mately destroy all other parties.
The Chinese Communist movement is
held up by the still-abounding Leftist
writers as a spontaneous emission of
“He's a beef-tea addict—the cad."
Chinese politics. Actually, it was or-
ganised in Russia before the war —a
lengthy report on what was being done
was presented to the All-Russian Com-
munist Conference in 1939 by M.
Manuilsky, who is not a Chinese. M.
Mapuilsky had previously been concerned
in an outburst of Bulgarian Communist
feeling which found its outlet in numerous
assassinations and attempted assassina-
tions and in the blowing-up of Sofia’s
principal cathedral. These days M.
Manuilsky is a “good” Ukrainian, repre-
senting that not-very-independent repub-
lic in the councils of the United Nations.
And he may yet find himself mixed up
in spontaneous plans for bloodshed in
India or Australia. It is strange how
Russian politicians move about.
The Chinese Communists have never
intended that there should be anything
but war, but war at the right time when
Russia was able to help them. .
Immediately on the announcement of
the withdrawal of American troops, save
for a few guards totalling about 2000
marines, the Communists struck. The
U.S.S.R. had avoided the direct responsi-
bility for arming them by allowing them
to obtain all the arms they required ffom
the Japanese in Manchuria. , This will
make it difficult to sheet home responsi-
bility to Moscow, though—as in Korea
and Java and, indeed, wherever Com-
munists operate—Moscow’s wholehearted
help is given often under a cloak of pro-
testations of love and affection for the
regime which its agents and friends are
seeking to destroy.
Cutting Off Peking
The Communists did not wait till the
Americans had left. They struck at the
two 4ft. Sin. gauge railways which run
southward or to the sea—the one on
which the U.S. troops would have to
move out goes to Tientsin directly, and
provides the most direct line of com-
munication with all ports further south—
Tsingtau, Lienyunkang (Lao - Yao),
Shanghai and Hangchow; also with
Nanking, the capital, which lies to the
north-west of Shanghai, on the southern
bank of the Yangtse.
The Reds are trying also to cut the
more western railway which travels via
Kai-feng, the Hankow Lake district, to
Ch’ang-Sha and Canton. This railway a
few months ago was still broken for
hundreds of miles south of Kai-feng as
the result of Japanese operations.
Neither railway is a very remarkable
asset, but by Chinese standards both are
the core of north-south military com-
munications, since immense waterways
and innumerable canals are hampering to
road transport and roads are abominable
or non-existent. •
Both sides are very short of aircraft.
The only section of the railway system
which is double-line is that between
Peking and Tientsin.
Hostilities began on January 31, the
Communists throwing overboard all the
agreements of the past year and declar-
ing open war, with an announcement by
Wang Ping-nan, one of their leaders in
Yenan: —
We are confident that we can impose
our political demands on the Government
by force of arms. There willbe no more
mediation between the Communists and the
Government. The only way out is to fight.
What happened then proved that
preparations for a campaign must have
been proceeding for a long time and on
a large scale, and that the Communists
had never had any intention of making
peace but were merely playing for time
to arm.
On Three Sides
The Peking-Tientsin railway had been
cut about 80 miles from the northern
capital within 24 hours of the announce-
ment from Yenan. And almost simul-
taneously the Hankow railway was cut
at Shih-chia-chuang, about 125 miles
from Peking, on the more western Han-
kow line. Attacks were proceeding along
nearly 100 miles of this line.
A third prong was operating against
the Peking to Ku-pei-kow railway, 15
miles north of Peking.
The objective obviously is to surround
and capture the northern capital. On
January 31 heavy fighting was beginning
on the Peking-Tientsin line, and the posi-
tion in the other sectors was obscure.
It will take two or three w«ks to de-
termine the measure of the combatants.
The ultimate decision depends largely on
how the Central Government behaves and
whether it can justify, by its political
course of action, help from the U.S.AI
It is the first open war which has
broken out in a major country since
U.N.O. was formed, and it will be in-
teresting to observe the repercussions in
that peculiar institution.
Defending White Australia.
“Ek Dum”: Crazy about the League,
when there was a League, to the extent
of accepting it as “the cornerstone” of our
defdhce and foreign policies, “S. M.
Herald” now hails U.N.O. as the hope
and salvation of the wprld. Strange
rumors are abroad that this doctrine is
being preached in semi-public gatherings,
though without direct reference to hauling
down the British flag.
One straw which shows the way the
wind is blowing was the special position
given to a Letter to the Editor. Written
by a Mr. Zieman, and printed at the foot
of the second editorial column, with
large headlines, this missive remarked
that “proceedings at the U.N.O. Assembly
and statements and publications by vari-
ous persons in India and South-east
Asia all point to the fact that these coun-
tries will not allow Australia to continue
with her low density of population.”
It was suggested that in order to
counter the claim that our North is not
being effectively occupied, “Australia
should hand over the Northern Territory
to U.N.O. as a permanent base and
training ground for an international
army.” And Mr. Zieman said “Australia
should lose no time in making her offer,
as this is the definite way of countering
the claim of our northern neighbors to
the right of free entry.”
„ “Some,” Mr. Zieman added blithely,
may hold up their hands in horror at
the thought of Russian soldiers stationed
in our North, but there are many ways
of viewing this”;
The Russians, having mixed with people
from all over the world, would return, to
their own country with ideas very different
from those which now prevail behind the
Iron Curtain. An international army to be
effective should always be in being.
Russian soldiers, when abroad, of course,
are rarely allowed to mix with anyone.
But apart from this the correspondent’s
idea is magnificent. To Mr. Zieman, and
presumably to his editor, if it were
adopted, the “Government” would have
a clear excute not only not to introduce
compulsory training, but to abolish the
defence force altogether, since there would
be no need for a* defence force if the
Russians, Indonesians and the Seventh
Swat Lifeguards from Nehrustan were
ready to do the work. This would en-
able the five Defence Ministers to con-
centrate full defence against irate house-
wives.
All that should be insisted upon is
that American standards of pay should
prevail among all international forces in
Australia and that they should bring
their own tucker and wharfies, since these
are unavailable here at present. The
high pay of the forces would bring money
into the country and assure a high inter-
national marriage rate, thus achieving a
pepper-and-salt complexion for the
country and the solution of the White
Australia policy. (Judging by its No. 1
prize-winning novel, this would have
“S. M. Herald” approval.)
The presence in the country of our
gallant allies the Russians would enable
the Communist party to operate with
greater confidence and to open 50 new
funds to promote friendship with them,
and would make it possible for members
of the Federal “Labor” party to support
the C.P. openly instead of clandestinely.
Moreover, the services of Mr. Mountjoy,
ex-M.H.R., might be co-opted as liaison
officer.
And since the operations of U.N.O. to
date have proved that nothing can be
done by it without immense expenditure
—its obscure education committee is
spending more than the League did as a
whole—and without endless conferences
employing enormous staffs, it would
solve the Jewish immigration problem,
since all the world’s shipping would be
employed in carrying delegates and docu-
ments, and the Jews would have to swim.
This would assure that only the best
physical types arrived here.
The establishment of a military capital
at Alice Springs would be the makings
of the Tennant Creek gold industry and
might even induce the Government to
instal a battery that will work. It would
give birth to a healthy Australian gold-
lace industry, every Russian officer from
subaltern upwards wearing about a
hundredweight of it these days. It would
also settle the blackmarkets in southern
capitals, since every blackmarketeer
would make a beeline for Mt. Gillen on
the first military payday.
The millennium could be completed by
the transfer of the “S. M. Herald” office
to Ryan’s Well or Ti-Tree. There it could
be published in an area where its ideas
would be appreciated, and where it would
enjoy the kind of company conformable
to its sentiments.. This might be heartily
applauded in the south, which would
begin to have some respite from s.p.,
comics and find-the-ball and social docu-
ments about Surry Hills. ,
The fact is that the best defence of
continued peace in Australia would not
be the presence of a polyglot mob of
Cossacks and foreign askaius in the north,
but a tight, well-publicised understanding
that if conditions which any member of
the British Commonwealth of Nations
considers worth war arise, Australia will
be beside the nation involved. And
that any infringement of Australia-first
principles should be subject to similar
support from the rest of Jhe British Com-
monwealth.
Russians, Nehru and Indonesians are
all powerless so long as this country
stands by its principles and so long as
there are a British Navy, a British mer-
cantile marine and a British Air Force.
Without the equals of these all the people
at present covetous of Australian soil
are powerless.

When the York airliner Star Glitter
touched down at Auckland on Sunday
with a new record of 59 htmrs flying time
from Britain to New Zealand, it added
one more to a string of records held by
Toowoomba-bom Donald Bennett. Back
in 1938 he made a record crossing of the
Atlantic in the pick-a-back plane Mer-
cury, and in 1940 he flew a seaplane from
Dundee to South Africa —a world record
for seaplanes and the first non-stop flight
to South Africa. He was also the first
to fly direct from Britain to Canada.
Bennett was one of the founders —as
flying superintendent—of the Atlantic
Ferry'organisation, which grew into Ferry
Command, and was later A.O.C. Path-
finder Force, to whose skill and heroism
the efficiency of R.A.F. bombing in the
latter stages of the war was largely due.
In 1944 he was promoted air vice-mar-
shal, at 34 the youngest R.A.F. man to
reach that rank. Turning to politics he
won the Middlesboroiugh East by-election
in 1945 as a Liberal, but lost it at the
general election later in the year. After
resigning from the Air Force, he became
chief executive of British-South American
Airways, on whose behalf the Air Glitter
made the present flight with 21 pas-
sengers.
H. G, Horner, just retired from the
position of general manager of 2GB
Radio, has been in the broadcasting game
for 20 years, which is going back a con-
siderable time in radio. Born in Kent,
he tried his luck on the land in New
Zealand, and also spent some time in
Canada before coming to Australia.
He went from Sun Newspapers to the
managership of 2BL, when that station
was privately owned; back to the Sun
and back again to broadcasting and,
in 1930, to A.B.C. as manager for N.S.W.
After seven years with the national
stations he switched again to commercial
radio. Horner claims that the biggest
kick he ever got out of radio
was when he arranged the broadcasting
of Morse signals from Kingsford Smith’s
Southern Cross during the first Pacific
flight. Messages went direct on the air
and were followed by a studio trans-
lation.
Heth’s drawing of the winner of the
1947 Wynne Prize shows that, like
Gruner before him, Lance Solorrton isn’t
one of the artistic tribe that runs wild in
hair and whiskers. He is 34, married,
and lives at Canley Vale, where the outer
suburbs of Sydney begin to lose them-
selves —mercifully—in gum-trees. Slight
in build and quiet in manner, he gives, as
do his paintings, an impression of re-
strained and growing power ; he believes
that an artist has to feel his subject “in
his bones” before he can do it justice. The
Wynne award, is Solomon’s second official
recognition, the first being the award of
ARTIST.
the Travelling Scholarship in 1939 ; but,
as is usual, jt has been chiefly the appre-
ciation of private connoisseurs that has
enabled him to Jive by his art. The Syd-
ney Gallery has one of his pictures, Mel-
bourne ndne; but Howard Hinton, who
can always be relied on to recognise an
original talent and who bought the first
landscape Solomon sold in an exhibition,
has sent a dozen to the collection at
Armidale (N.S.W.). The Wynne Prize oil
was painted in the Merriwa district in the
north-west of N.S.W.
Australia seems ,to produce cricketers
and singers as easily as it produces rab-
bits. Leading tenor at Covent Garden
this season is Kenneth Neate, the
“singing policeman,” who learnt to sing
by studying gramophone records of cele-
brated tenors at his home in Sydney.
With him in the company is Olive Dyer,
who Studied at the Conservatorium in
Adelaide, and a member of the chorus is
Elizabeth Harbutt, of Sydney. Harold
Williams sang recently at the Albert Hall
in “Elijah” under Malcolm Sargent, and
Joan Hammond is back from her Aus-
tralian tour, while Madame Grandi, the
Tasmanian-born girl who forgot her own
language while training in Europe, is
singing the leading role in “La Tosca.”

lie lectures on atomic energy in Adelaide
and Melbourne, made a trip to Canberra
to discuss the proposed National Re-
search University and found time to fly
to Mount Painter, in South Australia’s
north, for a quick look-over the uranium
deposits there. Oliphant seemed fairly
impressed with the Mt. Painter field not
so impressed with his Canberra visit. At
any rate, in Adelaide he offered some criti-
cal remarks about Government-controlled
research and its effects on the march of
knowledge, and just before boarding the
Qantas plane in Sydney he made it quite
clear that Britain would continue to be
the scene of his labors.
“El Verdugo’s” send-off:
With the retirement of Frederick Morley
Cutlack, associate editor, the last of the old
guard . leaves the “S. M. Herald” office.
Cutlack would have been considered a mere
juvenile in the days of “our Sir James” —he
is 60, and at the height of his powers. He
has been a fine servant to the “Herald” and
to Australian journalism. Born in Sussex, he
had his education in Adelaide and his basic
newspaper training on the “Register.” Going
to London, he joinfed the “Daily Chronicle”
staff before being pressed into service by the
Commonwealth Government and sent out in
1913 to report the voyage of H.M.A.S. Aus-
tralia and the little fleet which in 1914 without
doubt saved this country from attack. His
articles were excellent journalism which might
well have won him the position of chief Aus-
tralian war correspondent next year, but he
did no regular war journalism until 1918-19,
serving meantime in King Edward’s Horse,
the R.F.A. and Third Div. Intelligence. At
the end of that war he was called to the
English Bar. He was attached to the Aus-
tralian Imperial Conference Staff in 1923 and
from then onward his life was with the Fair-
faxes. Until the New Order arrived it had
been taken for granted that he would succeed
Brunsdon Fletcher in the editorship. The
nearest he got to it was to act on occasion
during the absence of the editor. Cutlack
accompanied the Latham Mission to Japan in
1934. He wrote the eighth—and best—volume
of the Australian World War I History on the
Flying Corps.
Melbourne University is losing its
Registrar, J. F. Foster, who goes to the
job of secretary of the Universities Bureau
of the British Empire in London. He
•holds to the belief that the Empire’s
academic cloisters should be considered
as a single unit so that staff appointments
could be made from one to the other in-
stead of inside each institution. Generally
speaking, there is a one-sided traffic, men
who have made their mark in some Aus-
tralian university usually waltzing off to
Cambridge or Oxford, to be replaced by
some junior lecturer from those hallowed
seats of learning. J. F. Foster has been
Registrar of Melbourne for eight years.
He has done the hat trick in the matter
of duxes, having been dux of his State
school. South Melbourne College and
Wesley. Since he started registraring the
Melbourne University’s undergrad popu-
lation has more than trebled. There are
9000 young men and women drinking at
the fount of knowledge and a staff of
over 1000 ladling it out to them. ,
“Becks” on a man from Minnesota:
With the swing away from the Democrats
in the last Congressional elections the nomina-
tions for Republican candidate for President
possess more importance than they have for
many years as the man finally chosen Will
almost certainly become America’s next Presi-
dent. This gives interest to Harold Edward
Stassen’s announcement that he intends seek-
ing the nomination. The election won’t be
held until late in 1948, but Stassen’s early
disclosure of his intentions is in keeping with
his record. Early in 1942, half-way through
his second term as Governor of Minnesota, he
announced that he would be running for a
third term. More than that, he told electors
that if returned he would resign after four
months to join the Navy. Minnesota gave him
his third term, and into the Navy he went,
serving on Admiral Halsey’s staff with the
Third Fleet until Roosevelt asked him to go
to the San Francisco Conference. Now in
his fortieth year, of mixed Norwegian, Czech
and German ancestry, Stassen has come a
long way from the market-gardening property
which his father still works on the outskirts
of St. Paul, Minnesota.
Ambition, hard work and a bent for keep-
ing his own counsel and going his own road
are the secrets of Stassen’s success. He
worked his way through law school in a variety
of jobs—in a grocer’s shop, as a baker’s off-
sider, an adding-machine puncher and a Pull-
man conductor. There’s a legend that he told
his fellow-students that he would be State
Governor at 35. He beat his estimate by four
years and during his first year in office was
chosen as chairman of the Governors’ Confer-
ence. Stassen has given his friends many
shocks, but the biggest was at the Republican
Convention in 1940, when at the last minute he
came out for Willkie, although the majority
of his delegation was supporting Vandenburg.
His support helped Willkie quite a lot, but
later the two fell out .when Stassen wrote a
critical review of One World.
If Stassen gets the nomination he will be
a good drawcard for the Republicans. A
young man—he’ll be 40 next April—with years
of public life behind him, and a mid-Westerner
who believes in international co-operation, he
should make a strong appeal to middle-of-the-
road men who are tired of Truman, but don’t
want a dyed-in-the-wool Republican as President.
St. Ann’s College for Women in the
Uni. of Adelaide begins to take shape
with the appointment as principal of
Florence Mary Harding, M.A., of Can-
terbury (M.L.). Miss Harding has since
been doing post-graduate work in Edin-
burgh, where she earned a Ph.D., getting
experience also as Maths mistress at
Cheltenham and house mistress at
Abbotts Bromlay. Dr. Helen Mayo and
Dr. Violet Plummer have perhaps worked
hardest for St. Ann’s in Adelaide, but it
was a £lO,OOO bequest by the late Sydney
Wilcox which made it possible. It will

“Chevroford”: At least one Victorian
had a laugh at the story of the “first”
landing on Rodondo, the 1200 ft. island
off Wilson’s Promontory. He is W. R.
Crole, a Newhaven crayfisherman, who
clairhs to have set his foot on the barren
rock at least once a year for the last
decade. All his sons and some of his
crew know the islet quite well, and Crole
himself was deputed to explore it in
1934 for wreckage of the missing air

the Great Optimist whatever two fos-

man who raised laughs when he founded
the Chapman Prospecting Expedition and
set out during the depression to look for
gold in the waterless Never Never. He
struck it lucky at the Granites. He
reckons there is unbelievable wealth

tricts. It ended when he got leave from
the service to join the Armored Division
in September, 1941, but the tanks
keep him away from New Guinea for
long—he was back within the year as a
member of that little-known and less-
advertised service whose work, invaluable
to the Allied cause, is so well recorded in
Eric Feldt’s The Coast Watchers. After
the Jap landings at Lae and Salamaua,
Williams spent some months with a party
in the country around the Lower Watut
River, downstream from Wau, but his
real job of work came later when, with
Malcolm Wright and Peter Figgis and a
couple of natives, he was put ashore near
Baien Bay in New Britain with the task
of watching the Jap supply route from
Rabaul to Lae. Williams insists that
their performance in New Britain was in
no way exceptional—just the ordinary
day’s work of all the coast-watchers.
That is possibly so, but, it earned a
D.S.C. for Wright and a M.C. apiecfe for
Williams and Figgis, Still, that sort of
thing doesn’t mean much to men of the

cent, of its pre-war field staff of 78 won

and sideboard and the dinner-table deco-
rated with low bowls of multicolored
gladioli, when vice-presidents and com-
mittee members of the Myer Women’s
Association farewelled their president,
Helen Macdonald, who left by Skymaster
for an extended business trip abroad;
her travelling will take her to America,
England and to the Prague Fair. She
expects to be away most of 1947.
Helen was an inspiration to her com-
mittee and to the 300 women who belong
to the association. All through the war
years valiant work was done. They raised
£ll,OOO for the Lord Mayor’s Food-for-
Britain Appeal and also raised and spent
£2OOO pounds on a ward at the Heidel-
berg Military Hospital. Later they
adopted this ward, and every week girls
visit the patients and take with them
parcels of good things. Helen and her
committee also donated £6OO towards the
St. John’s Recreation Hall at the hospital.
A function early in the war in aid of
the people of Greece brought in many
hundreds of pounds, and 3000 toys were
sent to the children of Great Britain,
while Melbourne children through Legacy
were given 2000 toys. For her dinner-
party, Helen wore a most attractive black
frock, featuring a bertha-collar of jet
with a deep fringe of black beads adding
a new note. Her small black hat was
of tulle and beads. Among the gifts she
received was a corsage of gardenias and
a gold fountain-pen ; a pen that doesn’t
need to be refilled for three years.
With the city sweltering in midsummer
heat, it is hard to concentrate on winter
fashions, but Australia’s greatest industry
comes into its own with the new hand-
knit designs women will wear and love
next winter. Sweaters used to be just for
warmth, and knitting and crocheting
sounded very dull. But now that’s all
changed. A sweater can be just as
glamorous as the flimsiest and frilliest of
blouses, and needles and wool are no
longer dull.
Lovely is the lacy-knit pattern featur-
ing an off-the-shoulder sweater that
is worn with a long skirt at the end of
the day. And sequins and colored beads
make a black sweater a thing of delight
to wear at cocktail parties with a short
black ballerina skirt. A fiat little
crocheted gold collar and bow dolls up
a plain black dress or gives added charm
to a black sweater. Scarves, too, are on
the dressy side when trimmed with pearls,
and a green scarf knitted in a plain stitch
takes on new glamor when sewn with
bands of gold material. Even bags are in
the picture ; they are knitted or crocheted
to match gloves and sweater. And for
the blustery days of winter, there are caps
and matching scarves to keep the cold out
and the warmth in. In the same collec-
tion are dinner- and evening-gowns made
<»f soft wool jersey, wool crepe and
angora. They are draped, shirred or
form-fitting, and all hang in graceful folds
to the floor. Cocktail frocks show the
new uneven hemline ; up at the front and
slightly longer at the back, and ringing
the changes on one simple black frock,
but using different sets of accessories, is
a game any woman enjoys. It’s good for
the budget and the coupons.
Beatrice Oakley, well known in Mel-
bourne for her singing, turned her talents
in a new direction, when recently she
produced Humperdinck’s opera, “Hansel
and Gretel,” for the Melbourne Repertory
Theatre. Beatrice commenced her singing
career at the age of 16 and two years
later won the Melba Scholarship. She
was chosen to sing with the last J.C.W.
Italian Opera Co., and she sang the
leading soprano part in “Carmen” and
appeared with Grandeforte and Bruno
Cartagna. Etta Bernard, who sang the
role of “Hansel,” studied singing in Eng-
land from 1934 to 1940. She sang at
Covent Garden with the British Opera
Co., at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre,
and with the Coronation Choir in 1937,
She has done much broadcasting work
with the 8.8. C., and is well known to
A.B.C. listeners. Musical director for
“Hansel arid Gretel,” Edith Harrhy, has
had a distinguished career. She passed
her first music exam, at six. Her work
overseas brought her into contact with
Clara Butt, Landon Ronald, Coleridge
Taylor, Edward German and many
others. She has written several light
operas ; one was produced at Melbourne’s
National Theatre, and raised £2OO for
Red Cross.
Embassy Lodge, Toorak, was the setting
for a buffet dinner-party given by Mr.
and Mrs. A. D. Weeks. Guest of honor
was Terry Garland, who is the sister of
the hostess. Terry chose a frock of black
crepe and her small hat, which sat far
back on her head, was of black velvet
roses. Mrs. Weeks was also in black, but
trails of red roses in her hair were
bright relief. Among the guests were
Mrs. Bill Cook, who will leave for
America on February 16 to visit friends,
and Vi Temple Smith, who chose a white
ensemble. Artist Vernon Jones was with
his wife, charming in grey crepe, the small
shoulder cape of her frock embroidered
in white, while pink and mauve flowers
trimmed her misty grey hat. Also pre-
sent were the Stan Waleys, Mrs. Waley
in a navy-and-white-printed frock. Stan
amuses himself and his friends with cook-
ing up Continental dishes. L. G. Mont-
gomery, much sunburnt, was an amusing
guest. The guest of honor, in telling some
of her experiences, said the greatest thrill
she ever had was seeing one of the
frocks she had designed worn by the
former Lady Clive.
Athol Shmith took this picture of Terry
Garland, who has been a guest at many
parties given in her honor. Terry left
recently by Skymaster on a trip to
America, England and France and expects
to be away from Melbourne for six
months. Terry is very decorative, dresses
with a flair and is a very keen business-
woman. She also finds time to run a
home, care for a baby and be keenly in-
terested in the welfare of the 50 girls
who are in her employ. Her favorite
recreation is cooking and her most suc-
cessful dinner-parties are those when
guests are encouraged to go into the
kitchen and produce one of the courses.
Christ Church, South Yarra, one of
this city’s loveliest old churches, was the
setting for the marriage of Mary Ballan-
tyne (Peggy) Sanderson, third daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Sanderson, Billa-
bong Station, Marsden (N.S.W.), and
Marne-street, South Yarra, to Lieut. Peter
Craig Latham, 8.C.0.F., younger son of
Chief Justice Sir John Latham and Lady
Latham As she walked down the aisle
with her father, the bride’s very lovely
bridal gown was effectively displayed. It
was fashioned of white duchess satin, the
skirt full and flowing, and the whole
line of the frock cut on princess style.
Godets of chantilly lace were set into the
skirt, which ended in a short train. The
fitted bodice had little satin sleeves and
chantilly lace was introduced into the
low-cut neckline. Billowing over the train
was a filmy tulle veil, lent by Mrs. Phillip
Hudson, and kept in place by a wreath of
orange blossoms. The bride carried a
small round bouquet of gardenias and
tuberoses. The bridegroom’s sister,
Freda, was the only attendant, and her
frock, cut on bouffant lines, was of pale-
blue nylon, adorned with bands of ruched
net in matching shade, embroidered ■in
tiny cream, pastel gold-and-green rose-
buds. Bertram Whiting was best man
and the Rev. J. A. G. Hudson performed
the ceremony.
The reception was held at Mr.
and Mrs. T, J. Hudson’s home,
Grantham, South Yarra. Grantham was
built when Victoria was still a part of
N.S.W. Set high on a hill, the grassy,
tree-shaded lawns slope down to the
Yarra, and here guests wandered after
they had been received by the bride’s
parents and Sir John and Lady Latham.
Mrs. Sanderson chose a pale pastel crepe
romaine frock and her hat was trimmed
with greeny-grey flowers ; Lady Latham’s
frock of French floral georgette was worn
with a black hat, trimmed with pastel
roses. Commodore Showers, accom-
panied by his wife, cool and charming in
a floral ensemble, came from Flinders
Naval Depot for the wedding. U.S.A.
Consul-General Richard Boyce was with
his wife, and her smart navy-blue outfit
was relieved by the swathings of pink
veiling worn about her hat.
From Sydney
Daniel Webster himself never pleaded
more eloquently than does Commander
Robert Jackson, R.A.N., plead the cause
of the misplaced people of the world,
that great army of unoccupation, flung
out of their normal existence as citizens
of their various lands by World War 11.
Through the commander’s eyes and
graphic words one morning last week a
group of intent listeners caught a glimpse
of those thousands of men and women in
camps in various parts of Europe waiting
day after day, month after month, year
after year, for the chance to go out into
the world to lead busy normal lives. If his
eloquence can send a phoenix soaring from
dead ashes then the success of the work
of the International Refugees Organisa-
tion, which takes up where U.N.R.R.A.
leaves off, is ensured.
Listening to Commander Jackson you
realise that the work of U.N.R.R.A. has
been far-reaching. The Administration
has done a great task, and an example
of smooth and efficient organisation was
that in July of last year it was moving
supplies at the rate of that done by the
U.S. Army at the peak of the war.
By the time this is in print Commander
Jackson (senior deputy director-general
of U.N.R.R.A.), is flying to China
to have a last look at conditions there.
From China he goes to Europe *and to
London by way of the U.S.S.R. His mes-
sage to the world in brief is; The people
in happier lands cannot escape helping
the men and women and children made
wretched by the war. It is not only a
duty, it is a driving necessity if there is
to be peace in the years to come.
Madge Elliott and Cyril Ritchard gave
a grand farewell lunch test Wednesday.
The Australia went gay with the meat
coupons and had among prize displays a
saddle of beef. Madge and Cyril, who go
off to New York next week, have been
working hard and gathering in the shekels
up to the last minute —their final matinee
was last Friday, and the usual crowded
house simmered with appreciation and
sizzled over into loud applause. When
they gave their party all the cast of their
show at the Royal had a cut of the joint,
and then the members of the company
returned the compliment by rallying
around Cyril and Madge in actress
Dorothy Dunkley’s flat at King’s Cross.
In this picture you see Sister Nora
Heritage, of Hobart (Tas), who has been
awarded the R.R.C. for service during
the war. For seven and a half years now,
Sister Heritage has been looking after the
war’s Sick and wounded. She has seen
service as a member of the Queen Alex-
andra Imperial Nursing Service in
many lands: Malta (for three years),
Cairo, Suez, Normandy, Scotland, Ireland,
Germany. Now this courageous Tas-
manian has returned to the British Middle
East Hospital at Suez after some months
of leave in Australia, She is a sister of the
late Brigadier-General Heritage. Nursing
is a sort of tradition with the Heritage
women. Miss K. T. Heritage (a sister) is
one of the nursing profession, and now
niece Keitha, whose father is a well-
known Launceston lawyer, has been
appointed to the A.A.N.S.
Lots of interesting people climbed the
steps to David Jones’s gallery for Eliza-
beth Durack’s show last Friday. The
Gallery’s genial directer, Will Ashton, in-
troduced the official opener, Bernard
Smith. Bernard is of the National Gallery
staff, and, though a bit nervous, hit the
nail on the head when he described the
paintings as “narrative” in quality. There
is unstressed pathos in these paintings of
our Australian brothers and sisters of
the north. The heat and something of the
helplessness of Broome grips the atten-
tion. Women mostly liked the black-and-
white sketches. Mrs. Tom Bateman
lingered over a child’s head titled “The
Orphan.” Mrs. Tom, having a wedding
anniversary, was radiant in softest blue.
Another pretty and. well-dressed woman
was Mrs. E. P. Houghton. With
her was a young Fielding Jones girl.
Play-writer Max Afford was there with
Mrs. Afford. She is just back from Mel-
bourne and goes off to Queensland next
week on work in connection with the film
“Sons of Matthew.” Mrs. Max is de-
signing costumes for both it ffnd “Cobb
and Co.” Then there was organist Alice
Bryant, whose organ recitals have been
such a feature of recent Town Hall Sun-
day concerts.
There was slim Abbey Clancy (sister-
in-law of the artist), who is doing a good
job with U.N.R.R.A. The painter’s
brother and his wife were there, and
Elizabeth Durack herself, very attractive
in white, the skirt knife-pleated all
around.
No doubt there will be a great exodus
of opera lovers from the city on the
evening of Sunday, February 9. The
attraction will be the presentation of
“Pagliacci” in the grounds of Werrington
Hall, Werrington Park, People who fol-
low these matters up say that this will
be the first time in Australia that opera
has been conducted in the open air.
Werrington Hall breathes the lavender of
old days and old ways. The property was
a grant in 1806 to Mary Putland (later
Lady O’Connell), daughter of Governor
Bligh. The opera will be directed by con-
ductor Wando Aldrovandi. The Golden
Fleece Child Centre, a branch of the
Kindergarten Union, will benefit.
Directions for finding Werrington Park
are printed on the back of each invita-
tion. By the Great Western Highway you
travel 15 miles beyond Parramatta. This
brings you to the township of St. Mary’s,
which you toss behind, and two and a
half miles further on you enter the port-
cullis of the historic spot. It does sound
a journey beyond scooter power. Visitors
can’t make any mistake ; the homestead
is on a hill and a flag will be flying in
the breezd
Members of the Overseas Club are
looking forward to the return from Eng-
land of Kathleen Gaden. Kathleen, who
has been the well-liked secretary of Over-
seas in Sydney for some years, has had
leave of absence for about 18 months.
While in London Kath has been attached
to the staff of Australia House.
The women’s badge of the Royal Agri-
cultural Society for 1947 (the first
R.A.S. since 1939) is a dashing
brooch of gilt and red enamel. With its
arrival come pleasing visions of a bigger,
brighter and better Easter Show than
ever before. The display of model homes
and the overseas exhibits are expected to
create deep interest. So they will '•if the
sighing post-war onlooker can hope
for a home and a few imported
luxuries before he is too aged
and doddering to enjoy them. But
women will be happy feasting their eyes
on the tiered fruits of the earth in the
hall of plenty as they used to, before
the war, taxation, ceiling prices, butchers’
strikes, transport strikes and no gas.
Their happiness will be mingled bitter-
sweet, for when again will they be able
to choose from the riches of the north,
the south, the east and the west of this
blessed land, and, choosing, blend them
into nourishing and strengthening meals
for their families?
Well-known bride-to-be Carma Nathan
will become Mrs. Jack Minnett at St.
Jude’s Church in the family’s home town
of Bowral on February 15. Nuptials
too, for Wendy Yates and Robin Pagan
in St. Michael’s, Vaucluse, on the

Those of us who remember the great
white shining ships of the Matson Line
lying at the Quay feel a sense of pride in
the war achievements of the Lurline, the
Monterey, the Mariposa, the Matsonia,
all old Sydney friends. These ships did
for the Pacific run —carrying soldiers and
equipment—what thoSe two stately-
Queens, the Elizabeth and the Mary, did
for the Atlantic and Middle East transport
of fighting men and resources. A booklet
to read carefully and place among the
war annals you cherish is Ships in Grey,
the story of Matson in World War 11.
Accompanying the story of each liner
is the photograph of its gallant captain,
all old friends of travellers between
Sydney and San Francisco. ’The story of
the rescue of passengers and crews of the
stricken Tahiti and the Santa Elena make
stirring reading. Then there is the tribute
to the Freighter Fleet: “the faithful work-
horses of the world’s sea-lanes —present
at every invasion from Guadalcanal to
the Normandy Beach-head.” Fifteen of
the Matson-operated fleet were among
those that didn’t come back, their only
epitaph a brief U.S. Navy announcement.
Not only ships, men, too. Sixty-four
Matson Line employees lost their lives in
the South Pacific shambles. And this
brings us to the dedication of this booklet,
which is to
All Matson 'personnel, serving both in
the armed forces and within the Matson
organisation, afloat and ashore, for their
valuable contribution to the war effort.
And now, why don’t Australian shipping
lines tell the story of their ships, big and
little, in World War II?

Earnings of the trading banks, oldest and
largest of which is the Wales, have ex-
hibited a stubbornness long overcome by
most other traders. According to Com-
monwealth Bank statistics average net
earnings of the trading banks for 1946
were no more than 4.1 p.c. of share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves com-
bined) ; a meagre return for the wide
range of services rendered and the risks
incurred. It is below the comparable
figure for other financial institutions and
2\ p.c. less than average profit of a wide
range of other traders.
Last tenfi’s slight improvement
(£16,478) in the Wales’s net earnings and
fractional lift in the div. (from 6 p.c. to
6i p.c., final quarterly payment being at
the rate of 6 \ p.c. p.a.) might, be taken
as belated official recognition of the facts
jifst referred to.
As a war-time (National Security) mea-
sure bank earnings were kept at about the
1939 level. Since the war the banks have
been brought within the framework of
official control by legislation designed to
regulate the nature and purpose of their
advances, the rates of interest they can
charge for loans and pay on deposits,
the volume of their investments in Gov-
ernment and other securities and the pro-
portion of their deposits to be “frozen”
on special account with the Common-
wealth Bank the newly-embellished
agency for policing Government eco-
nomic policy on the money side.
Hence this caution by the chairman:
This somewhat higher profit should not
necessarily be regarded as the beginning of
a new era of higher net earnings. Operations
of the banks are subject to restrictions and
controls, and future earnings will he related
to the method of operation of those
controls.
The £569,385 of profit was 6.5 p.c. on
capital, or a mere 3.7 p.c. on share-
holders’ funds ; and shareholders are en-
titled to a fair return on their money, in-
cluding that portion of it labelled re-
serves.
On the market the co.’s £4O shares paid
to £20 —the other £2O is a reserve liability
payable only in the event of liquidation
—were jammed at the old official ceiling
of £34 15s. at end 1946. In the free
market the figure advanced to £4O 15s,
by the middle of Jan., but eased to
£39 10s. at the close of the month. The
return at £39 10s. is 3.3 p.c. on a p.c.
div. basis, which is about the average
return over the whole banking field, or
less than is to be had from long-dated
Government securities. The investor at
£39 10s. who looks for only 3J p.c, on
his money counts on the div. going to
p.c.
This appears a reasonable anticipation,
considering the present low ratio of ad-
vances to deposits. But the cut in over-
draft rates from 4f p.c. to 4\ p.c. as
from the beginning of 1947 will partly
offset the benefit of any immediate
growth in advances. The whole position
is, as already stated, subject to official
controls, which are now being operated
in the interests of cheap money, which' is
a long-term policy with the Government!
Still, there are indications that this policy
is approaching, if it has not already
arrived at, jhe point where the blessings
are no longer unmixed.
The improvement in last term’s earn-
ings came mainly from the growth of
£7,098,674 in advances, which were still
only 33.9 p.c. of deposits as against 79.1
p.c. at the close of accounts in 1939 : j —

Continued ’ expansion of deposits (up
£19,287,503), which have nearly doubled
over the last seven years, chiefly reflects
the effects of credit expansion associated
with war finance. What needs to be re-
membered is that rising bank deposits do
not indicate increasing real wealth unless
they are accompanied by a corresponding
creation of additional real assets. In-
cluding the statutory deposits, which re-
turn only 0.75 p.c., the growth in low-
interest-bearing liquids was £13,265,367.
Add to the statutory deposits the holdings
of Treasury bills (£7,500,000) and Gov-
ernment securities (£39,618,500) and it is
obvious that the co. is extending more.
assistance to Governments than to trade
and industry at the moment.

The abolition of controls made no dif-
ference to the price of this co.’s f.-p.
pound shares, which fetched 51s.'9d. on
the market in Dec., as against 51s. last
week-end —the old official ceiling was
525. 9d. At 515., the return is 3.1 p.c. on
an 8 p.c. div. basis. So the investor who
looks for a shade under 4 p.c. on his
money counts on a 10 p.c. distribution,
which ought to be within reach, as soon
as coalminers and other workers cease
jamming the economic machine by stop-
work and go-slow tactics.
This co. (paid capital £760,433) and
Kandos (paid capital £673,862) are equal
partners in Australian Portland Cement
(paid capital £2,000,000), and have been
since 1930, when, seeing trouble ahead in
the industry, they' decided to get into
double harness, and handed over their
production plants to the operating co.
The two plants now have a combined
capacity of some 500,000 tons cement
p.a.—the one at Fyansford (Vic.) 300,000
tons, and the other at Kandos (N.S.W.)
200.000 tons. As soon as circumstances
permit a fourth unit is to be installed at
Fyansford, lifting capacity there to
375.000 tons p.a., which is well in advance
of probable demand, the chairman says.

Everything depends upon the position in
the operating co„ over whose figures the
curtain is kept drawn. Such indications
as there are suggest a healthy state of
affairs.
The partnership has been a profitable
one. Slump out of the way, enough was
earned to enable this holding co. to pay
10 p.c. again, followed by a run of
p.c. divs until 1941. The rate'dropped to
Hi p.c. for the next term, and then 8 p.c.
for each year since. The following table,
showing Australian cement production,
partly explains what happened;

Demand on defence account passed its
peak about four years ago, since when
production has dropped by little less than
one-quarter. Profits have dropped by
nearly one-third, owing to the extra
burden to taxation and rising costs. The
operating co. sent along 6 p.c. for each
of the last four years as against 9 p.c.
previously.
Last term production increased,
but was little more than half plant
capacity, owing to shortage of coal
and industrial disputes. The heavier
consumers of cement —public works,
including road construction, etc., and
factory, office and flqt building—are
not at the head of the list of building
priorities. Until the slack in the home-
building programme is taken up, there
seems little prospect of large-scale re-
sumption of other forms of building and
construction. How far such an expansion
will eventually benefit investors depends
mainly upon movements in prices and
costs. Bigger production should help to
reduce costs, and therefore improve the
profit, per ton, provided costs don't
advance too rapidly meanwhile. Prices
are controlled by official edict.

Insurance shares have been one of the
principal fields for investors in search of
security combined with long-term pros-
pects. Sydney Stock Exchange share-
price, index shows a rise of 21 p.c. for
the banks and insurance group from mid-
-1939 to end 1946, and a further rise of
21 p.c. in the free market during Jan.,
1947. This is the greatest rise of any
group for January, and for the longer
period the increase was surpassed, only
by retail stores.
The largeness of reserves in rela-
tion to capital, the periodical issue
of bonus shares, the steadiness of
divs., which in many cases are covered,
or nearly covered, by returns from a
wad of gilt-edge and near-gilt-edge
securities, leaving the underwriting
surplus, ror most of it, available t‘o swell
investments and returns therefrom, are
attractions which have placed sound in-
surance scrip y high in the investment
category.
Though underwriting runs into bad
patches at times, premium income is
expansive, and overall the law of averages
works well. The official pursuit of cheap
money and steep rise in taxation have
restricted the growth of interest eamin'gs
of recent years, and their effect will persist
for some time. Among other things this
means a wider spacing of benefits.
This 74-year-old Auckland-controlled
fire, marine and accident office, with
world-wide connections, has yielded
shareholders some rich harvests. Of the
£1,031,640 of capital £907,000-odd has
■ come from reserves, which at end Aug.
last were nearly five times larger than
capital. So the two combined need turn
in only a shade over 5 p.c. to show 20 p.c.
on capital alone. The last gift was in
1927, when £257,910 of bonus scrip was
scattered. Under more settled conditions
the time for further gift-giving might be
considered at hand. But in these very un-
certain days the cautipus board may
prefer to wait until the outlook is a little
less clouded.
On Australian ’Changes buyers have
lengthened their bid for the co.’s f.-p. 10s.
shares from the old official ceiling of
765. 9d. to 80s. without attracting sellers.
At 80s. the immediate return is only
2.5 p.c. on a 20 p.c. div. basis. The in-
vestor who looks for no more than 3£ p.c.
on his money counts on a one-for-one
gift issue and a 14 p.c. div., which would
then call for £288,859, Net earnings
averaged £545,519 over the last six years.
Last term the co. further expanded its
connections, especially in the Middle East
and Africa, and business was resumed in
Burma and the Philippines. Net premium
income stepped up £109,273; —-

prising feature is the saving of £122,789

for. Net return from all sources was thus
a juicy 55.5 p.c. on capital, or 9.4 p.c. on
shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves
combined). That leaves out of the reckon-
ing an unexplained reduction of £5189 in
reserves.
The very solid protection for both

There has been a change in the investment
policy, more attention now being given to
mortgages (up £322,086), which show a
better return than is to be had from Gov-
ernment securities (down £343,912). Cash,
etc., was further strengthened by £139,727.
Norseman Gold, N.L. (paid capital

Norseman (W.A.), recorded a loss of

pared with a loss of £39,176 for the pre-
vious year. That was after charging
£10,351 of the total spent on develop-
ment (£25,477) to capital, writing £1372
off shares in Norseman Associated, and
allowing £9BBl for depreciation. The
loss, wliich reduced the credit at p. and 1.
to £3378, is subject to an unspecified Gov-
ernment indemnity against loss on pyrite
production. Last term’s loss was wholly
orf account of treatment of low-grade

From London: C. J. Turle, chairman
of Hampton Areas, Ltd,, operating on
freehold Block 59 near Coolgardie
(W.A.), told shareholders at their recent
annual roll-up that on his own respon-
sibility he had placed 25,000 unissued
shares at 255. premium, together with an
option over a similar number at 30s. lor
a period bf 12 months. He said some
of the funds not immediately required
had been invested in other Australian
mines. Co. now had, in addition
to investments, £20,000 cash in London
and Australia, less recent expenditure on
development. More capital would be re-
quired to develop the co.’s holdings, for
wliich purpose a subsidiary had been
formed with a purely nominal capital of
£lO,OOO stg. It was intended to increase
the capital to £500,000, and British Trea-
sury consent to an issue up to £225,000
had been applied for, Westralian Mines
Department had unofficially expressed its
willingness to support this application,

London - controlled Youanmi Gold
Mines, Ltd., has returned 2s. 6d. (stg.) a
share to those' on its pref. register. A
further distribution is expected later. Co.
was floated with a capital of £700,000 in
1934. In the following year it had a
5000-to-a-month ore-treatment plant at
work, and by 1938 had added,a sulphide
section of similar capacity. No dividends
have been paid, and because of dis-
appointing developments at depth work
ceased in 1942. Part of the plant was
then requisitioned for war purposes.
Later the mine, including 350,000 tons of
2.Bdwt. tailings, 50,000 tons of 3dwt.
mixed calcined and raw residues, and
some mining stores, were sold by tender.

Westralian Minister for Mines, Bill
Marshall, wants the Commonwealth gold
tax abolished. Its continuance, he says,
means that large quantities of low-grade
ore will be left in the ground. Since the
tax came into operation in 1939, Wes-
tralia’s contribution has exceeded
£4,000,000, and Marshall estimates that
when the industry gets into full swing
again it will pay roughly a million a year
in tax —nearly double the current figure.
¥ ¥ * ¥
Westralia’s 1946 gold production at
616,964 fine ounces was best since 1942,
when the yield was 848,1800 z. The 1946
result was achieved in the face of diffi-
culties. Rising costs was one. In 1947
mineowners face a new wages claiih
which, if granted, will further increase
the cost burden. Each upward jump in
mining expenditure automatically places
some marginal-grade ore beyond the pay-
able limit. Employment .in the industry
in 1946 was well below peak-year level,
though it improved by 50 p.c. on the
1945 total. Prospecting also increased.
This activity was stimulated by the Gov-
ernment making available its geologists
for consultation, and by new intensive
surveys.

Backed by a report from Dick Wilson,
former State Mining Engineer, an effort
is being made by Perth interests to float
the old Springfield and other lead mines,
north of Geraldton. With lead at £AB7
a ton, the promoters estimate profits of
from 745. to 3125. per ton of ore treated.
Some critics consider the estimates opti-
mistic.

SUNDRY SHOWS
MURAL AND SCULPTURE.
William Dobell and Andor Meszaros
have captured a deal of newsprint lately,
for reasons not exclusively artistic. The
one with his mural at the Sydney
restaurant, Savarin’s, the other with his
statue of King George V, which was un-
veiled by the Duke of Gloucester at the
King George V Memorial Hospital.
Dobell’s painting is not a mural,
in the strict sense of the word, having
been painted and then fixed to the wall.
Its subject matter —a full-blooded King’s
Cross species of Saturnalia-r—seemed in-
congruous beside an empty hall and bare
white - covered tables; but, then,
restaurants are always dismal places when
deserted. In the full swing of dining
the decoration should look much more
effective —and a mirror opposite it gives
it a pleasing, gleaming reflection. A great
painting would have made the restaurant
incongruous.
The painting itself is gleaming—
its virtue and its defect. There
is lightness and gaiety—and yet the
gaiety is more fleeting than vital.
In a reproduction the effect is better than
in the original, for what, in that, might
seem to be promising minor figures and
background prove to be vague effects,
painted in as though the artist lacked the
strength of conception and composition
to carry through a large-scale, major job;
the relating of minor figures to a focal
point of expression.
Women and sailors jitterbugging—
carnival up-to-date—are placed in the
centre of the picture, but do not dominate
it; they do not appear to be enjoying
themselves, for all their feverish activity.
Two women are limber and lively, in
white dresses of indeterminate pattern,
and a little Wraith-like. Outside this
group the decline is rapid ; sailors, girls,
hags and odd characters contort and turn
into many-colored blurs. There are red
and yellow and shadows, and a tinge of
green gives the sky a dismal leer. In the
bottom corner left a yellow kangaroo dog
is aghast at finding himself in King’s
Cross.
There is little beauty in this work,
though it is pleasing. Its virtue is the
study of character—you might recognise
some of the figures walking past, say,
a milk bar in Darlinghurst-road, by
a twist of the head, and a thrust of the
foot, and the poise of a cigarette. But
this, valuable though it is as a flash of
perception, is only a limited conception.
The Meszaros statue is white and
stands outside K.G.V. —the King
George Memorial Hospital for Mothers
and Babies, to give it its full title
—and tones very well with the
blue and white columns and layers
of that noble building. The hospital itself
is a fine memorial to the old King, stand-
ing just opposite Prince Alfred Hospital
in Missenden-road, and within it are the
best and latest aids to medical science.
Gleaming passages: lifts that move
silently and so swiftly that one travels, as
it were, by surprise. And an operating
theatre of shell-like structure which looks
like something out of Brave New World.
Before all this, flanked by neat lawns,
stands the statue, looking very like a
snow-man ; or a white-washed Egyptian
mummy; or a conventionalised fish.
The statue may fairly be called arrest-
ing, for at an early hour in the morning
more than one lounger was regarding it
with expressions which were, if not rapt,
at least amazed. And purses, hurrying
between P.A. and K.G.V., who should
surely have been inured to the sight,
occasionally faltered, looking at it full-
face. On closer inspection the head is
bowed, with blunt, dead, sad features (the
bluntness, it is alleged, is to counteract
the effects of wind and water erosion),
the hands are stiff, one grasping a
sceptre, and the whole is clad in a kind
of shroud.
Sydney, admittedly, has many ugly
forms of conventional sculpture—histori-
cal figures holding hands aloft and point-
ing and flourishing documents—and, apart
from the beautiful Archibald Fountain
in Hyde Park and the Shakspeare Group
near the Mitchell Library, and some iso-
lated pieces by ‘Lambert, Hoff and
Murch, the older school of sculpture has
done little to beautify the city. But the
Meszaros statue does even less.
The statue was presented by the Stirling
Henrys. It is always pleasing to see private
citizens supporting the arts and decorating
their city.
Ena Joyce.
Ena Joyce, a young painter, has one or
two promising paintings in her exhibition
at (he Macquarie Galleries, and a num-
ber of paintings and drawings which
show that she is still searching for a
formula of expression. And, in the pro-
cess, is often astray.
Some paintings have a slick, unsure
kind of luminosity—very fleeting and
meaning practically anything. Some
landscapes are clearly influenced by
Continental modes. And in drawings,
the artist shows a deter-
mination t<6 reveal the profundity of
solidity, ancl does it, as may be expected,
ponderously.
“Portrait of Gwen” has bright paint,
but the character is low-toned ; the face,
the set of the mouth, the expression in
the eyes—a matter of nuances —are in-
sinuatingly captivating. But the back-
ground is rough, there is rough paint
everywhere, aijd the shape of the head
seems to be deliberately distorted in order
to give the portrait a spurious, negative
force.
This, again, is a characteristic of Ena
Joyce’s work—a rather naive falsification
—most commonly seen in her female
nudes. Even when anatomically correct
they are seldom lovely.
There is a shadow of ugliness about
“Standing Bather”—but only a shadow.
Otherwise it is, against a smeary
and “arty” background, a spirited image
of a woman, looking something like a
female Byron about to plunge into the
Hellespont.
“Reclining Nude” is a direct excep-
tion : strongly derivative—it resembles an
inferior Bunny in a Renoir-influenced
mood—it has color and grace. Also, sig-
nificantly enough, size; a rough mea-
surement .made it 3ft. 7in. by 3ft. lin.
Some of the work need not have been
exhibited. It is interesting, doubtless, to
see* the rough, experimental outline of
work by Old Masters. Not so interest-
ing to see “Sketch for Portrait of Gwen.”
And other drawings which looked like
sketches for something or other.
The Jack of nursery-rhyme legend may
well take the blame for “Jack’s Cottage,”
a murky daub; but Miss Joyce has
affixed two lamentable children, hugging
each other and apparently lamenting. -
Brahms Miscellany.
Looking like completely happy
goannas and lying around in their hun-
dreds outside the Conservatorium, Syd-
ney music-lovers are now lapping up
the A.B.C.’s Brahms Festival. And with
a cooling southerly blowing across their
faces, and the stars and palm-trees over-
head, even the “Brahms Miscellany,”
which came through the amplifiers on
Saturday night, must have sounded ex-
cellent. Inside the Conservatorium the
effect throughout the performance was
not quite so good.
The opening item was the Sonata No.
3 in D minor, for violin and piano.
Soloists Phyllis McDonald and John
Douglas Todd handled its intricate move-
ments beautifully. They were followed
by soprano Ruth Pearce Jones, vvith an
able accompanist in Warner Baer. Miss
Jones sang Brahms lieder and was par-
ticularly good in the story of the little
German salamander, who could have
kept cool even in the Conservatorium.
Then interval and an opportunity to
watch the devoted goannas drinking tea
from their thermos flasks. After which
Laurence. Godfrey Smith gave an un-
inspiring performance in two of Brahms’
Intermezzos (A major and B flat) and
his Rhapsody in B minor, and the A.B.C.
Sydney Singers then chanted 12 of the
“New Love Song Waltzes,” bringing the
miscellany to a vigorous though unhappy
end.
Ella Shields at the Tiv.
Hie amazing thing about Ella Shields’s
impersonations (at Sydney Tiv.) is not
so much their perfection ip air, manner
and detail, but their consistent freshness
—a remarkable feat since the acts have
been put on for the benefit of all corners
of the globe for quarter of a century. At
any rate the cherubims, or whatever they
are, on the Tiv. ceiling were nearly
shaken from their perches by the thunder
of applause which greeted and fare-
welled each of Miss Shields’s appearances
on the stage.
Miss Shields isn’t the only plum in
the Tiv.’s current confection. The best
of a good bill are the Two Marvettes,
whose strength and grace is almost
casual; the Three Marcellas, whose eccen-
tric dancing makes their bodies seem like
something mechanical gone awry; the
Flying Ashtons, including a youngster
who seems to belong more # to the air
than the earth, and Les Ritchie, Colin
Croft and Jack Murray, with “The Green
Eye of the Little Yellow God” ; not for-
getting the Tiv.’s lovelies, showing the
right amount of torso decorated with cos-
tumes as fresh as flowers.
At the Talkies.
“My Darling Clementine” (Plaza).
It is the best western shown here
since “Destry Rides Again.” When
Henry Fonda takes over sheriff duties in
the picturesque old town of Tomb-
stone the local undertakers start digging
holes and don’t have a chance to mop
their brows until Henry gets the girl.
Incidentally, they break all records set
by Wallace Berry when he was in those
parts. One of the many good scenes in
the film is given by Alan Mowbray, a
travelling Shakspearean actor, who
seems a little out of place standing on a
bar-room table done up in Hamlet regalia
and holding up a bottle of the local
“pizen” as the skull murmuring “Alas,
poor Yorick” as he makes its contents
vanish. However, the locals him
and show the warmth of their feeling
by shattering the remains of Yorick with
a few well-placed 45’s. Victor 1 Mature
gives the best acting in the film, but
makes the usual mistake of Hollywood
bad men by tuming'good in the end ; and
duly comes to grief while helping to eli-
minate Walter Brennan and family —-
grim types —in a scene in which chips of
plaster seem to be falling from the Plaza
roof.
"Harvest Gold."
From Mervyn B. Murphy, Director:
The Bulletin’s review of the Australian
rural documentary film “Harvest $old” (B.
1/1 / ’47) calls for a reply. It has been said
*that Australia is a land of gum-trees, with an
expert under every tree. The film reviewer
C.S. ’ must be such a one, for in setting
himself out to expose the inaccuracies and
weaknesses of the film, he proves himself to be
at complete variance with an army of acknow-
ledged experts. 1 C.S.” says the producers
deserved better advice there exists a vast
and yawning opportunity for some observant
bushwhacker to start himself in business as a
sort of technical adviser to filrasmiths ”
Admittedly we did not go to a “bushwhacker”
for advice, but we did go to the practical
farmers in the areas in which the scenes were
shot, and also to the appropriate Common-
wealth and State Departments, whose experts
vetted the script, selected locations and gave
technical advice and co-operation throughout
the period of production.
The “secret of how to strip ripe wheat at
night,” which baffles your reviewer, is appar-
ently common knowledge to modern farmers,
for the scenes in question were photographed
around 8.30 p.m. in the Tamworth district.
Farmers supervised the stripping and bagging
of wheat with headers, and stated that they
would not hesitate to strip their own crops
at night, under circumstances similar to that
called for/ in the script. The only requisite
is a night on which the air is not laden with
moisture.
And surely “C.S.” must have left his glasses
behind, or else reviewed from hearsay, fgr I
tender herewith contact photos from the original
film negative as factual proof that (a) The
“tramstop post” is a hitching-post in the main
street of Campbelltown. (b) The “suburban
street” is the main thoroughfare of one of
Australia’s oldest towns, Campbelltown. (c)
The “gas stoves” used by the wheatgrowers’
wives as per photos are unmistakably fuel
stoves. (d) The “orchard tractor” is quite
unsuitable and rarely ever seen on an orchard.
It is a high-powered tractor being sold to wheat-
farmers in Australia.
Far be it from me to resent criticism. Tie
intelligent, constructive kind is something which
Australian film producers have learned to re-
ceive in a proper spirit of appreciation. But
surely it is important for a reviewer who sets
himself up as an authority' on wheat-farming
to be able to distinguish a hitching-post from
a tramstop post.
Up till now Australian film producers, tech-
nicians and players have kept the flag flying
under heartbreaking conditions, with appalling
lack of adequate facilities. Governmental and
industrial enterprises are beginning to encour-
age us with sorely-needed support. Is it too
much encouragement to ask of film reviewers
that they check their observations and their
gratuitous advice at least as carefully as the
“filmsmiths” before rushing into print?
“C. 5.,” in reply;
Whether “experts” in appropriate Common-
wealth and State departments afe unassailable
authorities is a moot point. The “secret of how
to strip ripe wheat at night” can be left to
growers, none of whom needs telling that it
can be done only when the straw is dry and
brittle— -a condition far from common. The
real point was the film-makers’ argument that
because a man used horses his crop was later
than anybody else’s, and when a “cyclone”
was reported all the tractor-men had to rush
in to save it for him. Silly and unnecessary.
The smaller matters of the hitching-post in
Campbelltown—an outer Sydney suburb far
removed from the wheat country—and the fuel-
stoves (a photograph sent as “evidence” shows
a coal-scuttle beside one of them) and the
“orchard tractor” can be granted as points
against the reviewer, but the main criticism
stands. As a Bulletin writer I am as
anxious as anyone else to see Australian films
progress. My criticism was constructive in that
it showed obvious mistakes. It is the function
of no honest paper to give praise and ignore
faults just because a film—or anything else
for that matter—is an Australian product.
“Harvest Gold” was well photographed and
fairly well acted. Let it go at that.

SORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MIĹ RUM.
If her win in the 13-furlongs Moorabhm
Handicap at Mentone on Saturday was as good
as it looked, Cherie Marie should be tough for
the best of them from now on. The Oaks
winner beat nothing much in the Moorabbin,
but she made them look like another kind of
animal, racing away to a six-lengths win in
bettering the course record by 2i secs.
It was a vast improvement on anything she
had shown this season, but the quality of the
opposition often counts a lot in such cases,
in this it is indicated by old Dominate
being topweight and heavily-backed favorite;
he finished second, a length ahead of The
Buzzard mare Early Love.
<0 • • • A ••
A more convincing win—because she beat
a pretty good lot of her age, giving them
plenty of weight—was registered by the three-
year-old Manitoba filly Amelia in the 10-
furlongs Chelsea Handicap. Carrying 9.2,
with Red Fury, 8.6, next in the weights,
Amelia won very easily by three lengths from
the improving Hellespont filly St. Marion, with
about another three to the Actor colt Drury
Lane. Amelia should certainly pay her way
in the next month or two.
Another 'good Mentone win was Black Law’s
defeat of Doughboy, Void and others in the
mile Warrong Welter first division. Queens-
land-bred, by Mr. Standfast-How Sweet, Black
Law was bought in Brisbane for a large sum
by O. Porter, whose string also includes Cherie
Marie. Solidly backed at 5 to 2, with Finlaiig
next in the betting at sevens, Black Law got
there by only a head and had to survive a
protest, but nonetheless it looked as if the
best horse won, and, as it was his first run
since, the Caulfield Cup, he should do even
better.
When the Beau Pere gelding Oriental was
last taken to Melbourne some big plunges
went astray on him, but they got some of it
back when he narrowly beat the hot favorite,
Gay Queen, in (he six-furlongs J. L. Reilly
Stakes. A three-year-old High Title filly, Gay
Queen was definitely a good thing beaten. She
failed by only half a head to cut down the
winner and was clearly in front in the next
stride. Hispano was a length and half away
third. It was a fairly good field, but Gay
Queen’s run made the winner’s performance
look dubious form to follow.
The Warrong second division was con-
vincingly won by the Kinderscout four-year-
old gelding Lord Baden, nicely accounting for
Encircler and Lady Antog. In the other Men-
tone events Colin’s Pride, a Collingwood-Edna
Robin colt, won the six-furlongs Bass Juvenile,
defeating the heavily-backed Vrondi and Perm,
and Salmint was a neck too good for Wan-
garatta, with Jolly Miller a far distant third,
in the Summer Hurdle.
* * * #
With crowds these days back to something
nearer normal, a little course like Moorefield
becomes again as pleasant as any, and in the
S.T.C. meeting there on Saturday it lived up
to its old happy title of Punters’ Paradise.
That was odd in respect to the first winner
particularly. Though there was no form, nor
apparently anything else, to go on, the New
Zealand-bred colt Tomboy was favorite at
threes when betting opened for the first went,
a five-furlongs scamper for maiden two-year-
olds. There isn’t so much money about now
as there was, but there was enough of it
to send the colt (he’s by Ringmaster-Midinette)
out at 5 to 4, and, ridden by N. Sellwood,
he nicely held off the Golden Sovereign filly
Nell Gwynne to win by half a neck, with Sun-
brown third.
Sellwood, who, like the rest of them from
up there, has been riding in capital form since
he came down from Queensland, made it a
double when he landed Manargo the winner of
a division of the six-furlongs Trial from Prince
Midas and Lord Rex, but already the cold
official eye was on him, and on another good
one of the Queensland contingent, G. Moore,
as well. Both were subsequently outed for a
couple of months, on' the unusual count of
both committing the same offence at the same
time: between them they were held to' have
made a sandwich-filling of Beau Brummell in a
division of the mile Novice. Beau Brummell
would probably have been” beaten in any case,
but with the two veering on to him from either
side in the straight hen most likely have got
it on a protest against both if he’d managed
to run third. As it was, Moore’s mount
Tamasha Sellwood’s mount Herbert River
a head, with Dancing the same narrow margin
away third. Tamasha'has had a change of
trainers and may be about to run up to his
good looks.
The other divisions of the Novice and the
Trial went respectively to the four-year-old
Harinero mare May Mist (F. Williams), an
easy winner from Pitt and Tyche, and the five-
year-old Piccadilly mare Rose Glory (J. O’Sulli-
van), who downed King Hal and Lord Dundee
in even easier fashion. A big mare and
a strqpg galloper, Rose Glory should be
capable of winning in better company. Her
time wasn’t good, but she was cantering.
All the five winners mentioned were well
backed; the books had their turn in the six-
furlongs Flying, won by Yankee Lad (F.
Walker), from the deadheaters Dutchman and
Columnist. It was a capital finish, Yankee Lad
getting there by only a head, and Count Cosmo
being also in the bunch. Yankee Lad is . a
four-year-old horse by Brazen. The other well-
performed Brazen in the field, Brazier, ran
like a "very tired animal, and has had enough
for the present. A feature worth noting was
the heavy backing of Columnist, despite top
weight and a distance much shorter than he
likes. Though Moorefield is a very tricky
course, form shown there has a way of coming
good on other tracks.
A moderate lot turned out for the 10-fur-
longs Moorefield Handicap, the aged Morse
gelding Marcontine (A. Ward) winning it run-
ning away from Double March and Darnley.
The mile Welter completing the bill was won
by the four-year-old Pentheus horse Pearl
Trader, from Craftsman and Bon Terre. The
last-named should win soon, perhaps at Can-
terbury over a bit further distance. Titanic’s
inglorious run should be forgotten; he got
away very badly.

Good new blood continues to arrive from
England, the latest importations being In-
genious, a three-year-old Hyperion colt, for
F. W. Hughes, and an unnamed yearling by
Casanova from Trimavera for Pat Osborne.
J. F. and G. Fleming, who bred the A.J.C.
Derby winner Concerto, have secured Nice
Day, a son of the Derby winner Mid-day Sun
and Belle Adventure. Nice Day has won, in
England at up to a mile and a half In
"NO ball!”
addition the British Blpodstock Agency pur-
chased five colts at the Newmarket sales on be-
half of various Australian owners for an aggre-
gate cost of 13,900 guineas. The most expen-
sive of them are Alwassat, a three-year-old by
Hyperion at 4200 guineas, and Friar’s Fancy,
a five-year-old by Sychwood Abbot-Fascinator
at 3100 guineas.
* * * *
Fourth Test: —-
The toss won, England’s openers, Hutton
and Washbrook, went in determined to put a
solid score on the board and be hanged to such
nonsense as entertainment. They made a pretty
good fist of it, too, with 137 up, before Wash-
brook (65) went to a nice catch by ’keeper
Tallon off Dooland’s bowling. Hutton lifted
his score to 94 before McCool got him 1.b.w.,
but Edrich and, once more, Hammond both
failed, 17 respectively, and the first day
ended with 4* down for 239.
Hammond was a hard-luck victim to a clink-
ing Toshack delivery breaking back from the
off. Ten of Toshack’s 18 overs on the first day
were maidens.
With 460 on the board and two Australian
wickets, including Bradman’s, down for 24
at the end of the second day, England was in
a better position than at any stage of the other
three Tests. Bradman, going in late in the day
after M. Harvey had been bowled by Bedser
for 12, went for a duck to the same bowler.
The English total was mainly a grand knock
by Compton, who hit up 147 before he went
c. and b. Lindwall, and a solid 67 by Hard-
staff before Miller bowled him. Adding the
three tail-enders to his bag, Lindwall finished
with 4 for 52. Dooland bagged three for 133;
Miller, Toshack and McCool one each.^
Only twice in the present Tests has the first-
wicket partnership exceeded a hundred, and
both were made by Hutton and Washbrook—
-138 at Melbourne and 137 at Adelaide. Aus-
tralia’s partnerships have been 9 at Brisbane,
24 at Sydney, 32 and 68 at Melbourne, and
18 at Adelaide.
In 51 Test innings Bradman has had only four
“ducks” and has scored 4389 runs, av. 93.38.
The other times he failed to score were at
Melbourne in 1932 (b. Bowes), at Brisbane
(c. Fagg, b. Allen) and Sydney (c. Allen, b.
Voce) in 1936. ,
Douglas Wright’s “duck” was his sixth in
12 innings this tour —quite a respectable clutch.
But Wright’s job in the team isn’t to brood
over the “ducks” he makes; he’s there to
make others get ’em.-
* * * ♦
“Old Mat”: Add to the list of Australians
(B. 22/1/’47) called early into Test cricket:
Ferris and McCabe (19); Syd Gregory (20);
Macartney, Trumper, Harry Trott and Hans-
ford (21); Murdoch and Armstrong (22); Old-
field, Spofforth, Graham and Reg. Duff (23);
Darling, Ponsford and Noble (24). Don Blackie
(45), H. Ironmonger (40) and Clarrie Grimmett
(33 —old-timers who played with him in Sydney
grade cricket swear he was older) were re-
warded in their autumn days.
* * * *
Victoria trounced N.S.W. in the Sheffield
Shield match at Sydney. Leading by 27 on the
first innings (356 to 329), Vic. declared at 450
for three wickets made in 354 minutes (417 were
scored in a day, Miller hitting 206 not out in
241 minutes). Five outright wins in as many
matches gives Vic. an unbeatable 25 points for
the Shield.
» * * •
Proposed cricket laws:
After a couple of years’ investigation and
seeking the advice of cricketers everywhere the
M.C.C. has -prepared a final draft of its pro-
posals for the revision of the Laws of Cricket,
which will be submitted to a general meeting
at Lord’s in May.
Mainly they’ve concentrated on removing
present ambiguities and rearranging the laws
into a logical sequence under five headings:
(1) Players, umpires, scorers; (2) Implements
of the game and the ground; (3) Care and
maintenance of the pitch; (4) Conduct of the
game; (5) Duties of the umpires.
The laws have been reduced from 60 to 47,
with a few alterations, about the most notable
of which deals with the question of a bail
which has been merely dislodged without falling
to the ground. The new law says that for the
wicket to be considered broken the bail must
be removed completely frpm the top of the
stumps; if, however, the bail falls and lodges
between two of the stumps the wicket is to
be considered “down.”
Another welcome move is directed against
excessive pad play. The present law, reading,
“If the striker kicks the ball wilfully no run
shall be scored,” has been altered to “If the
striker wilfully deflects the ball with any part
of his person no runs shall be scored and the
batsmen may not change ends.”
Umpires will be given special authority to
stop as “unfair play” the practice of a bowler
running down and damaging the wicket after
he has delivered the ball. At long last also
the M.C.C. has provided an actual definition
of the nebulous term “pitch,” which they've
named as “the area of ground between the
bowling creases sft. in Width on either side of
the line joining the centre of the wickets.”
* * * *
Best effort on the second day of the
A.A.A. championships at Perth, from an
Olympic viewpoint, was the high jump
of 6ft. 6|in. by the young Westralian
J. Winter, £in. better tfian Metcalfe’s
figures made at Sydney in 1933, and an
extra-good leap on the fairly sandy
Perth ground. Other Westralians
to win were C. Green (440yds. hurdles in
54.15ec.) and K. Allen (hammer throw of
156 ft. 10|in.). Victorian successes were
J. Stevens (880yds, in Imin. 55.25ec.), K.
Doubleday (hop, step and jump of 47ft.
lOiin.), G. Knott (mile walk in 6min.
31.45ec.), J. Bartram (220yds. in 22.55ec.)
and mile medley relay in 3min. 31.2 sec.
N.S.W. wins were by G. Campbell (three
miles in 14min. 31.25ec.) and K. Pardon
(discus throw of 138 ft, 3iin.). N.S.W.;
retained the Richard Coombes Shield with
eight wins ; Vic had six, W.A. four and
S.A. one.
« ♦ ♦ . ♦
As well as Westralian high-jumper J.
Winter, another good young Olympic
prospect has shown up in J. Marshall.
Already holder of practically all Vic-
torian swimming titles, the 16-year-old
Marshall added the 2£o yards freestyle
Australian championship to his list in the
national-title events at Adelaide. Mar-
shall downed the N.S.W. champion F.
O’Neill, with American Fred Taioli third,
* * * *
Winding up a carnival day at Cam-
bridge (Eng.), Caius College defeated 15
sportsmen of Oxford in a of “foot-
the-ball,” which must be a rare sport.
Three balls, one blue, one red and one
yellow, were used, necessitating a triple
kick-off after the teams had been escorted
on to the field by a pipe band. Also there
were three referees or “controllers.” Fail-
ing to geUsa decent lash at any of the
balls Oxford had the worst of it, which
cost them a kilderkin of ale for the vic-
tors. For the benefit of those not versed
in ye olde British measures, a kilderkin
is equal' to two firkins or, in basic Aus-
tralian, “an eighteen.”
* * * *
Rip Bunker (7.12) was fatally hurt in
his encounter with N.S.W. flyweight
champion Jimmy Hogg (7.13) at Leich-
hardt. Recovering after early battering,
Bunker had Hogg reeling in round eight
and also won the ninth, but that was his
last flurry. A heavy punch to the temple
shook Bunker, and he was helpless
against the ropes when, in the twelfth, the
ref. stepped in, Hogg having eased up.
Bunker collapsed and was taken to
hospital in such a critical state that a
brain specialist had to be called in to
operate; but the lad failed to pull
through.
* # * ♦
On what they’ve shown, the couple of
cullud pugs brought out by Freddy Coch-
rane aren’t of much account, both having
been trounced in Melbourne, where Eddie
Miller (9.4 i) made an exhibition of
Willie Roach (9.3) on Saturday night.
Miller was momentarily down to a wild
swing in the ninth round and to another
in the eleventh, but he won so easily that
it would take 50 teams of elephants to
pull a gate for a Roach-Patrick encounter.

The lOU’s in Living Standards
The “Labor” Governments in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand have placed
great emphasis upon “social security” in
their planning and policy. Before the
war Maoriland’s Savage and Fraser Gov-
ernments spent most of their time chang-
ing the economic and social systems of
the country, and in Australia during and
since the war the Labor Government, first
led by Mr. Curtin and then by Mr.
Chifley, has inflated the price of social
services tremendously. “Social security,”
indeed, 'is now costing the taxpayers a
sum larger than all pre-war Common-
wealth departmental expenditure.
Simultaneously with the social-security
programme, -both the Maoriland and
Commonwealth Governments have com-
mitted themselves to a policy of “full
employment,” even though the Chifley
Ministry protests that it has not received
constitutional power adequate to carry
out its aims to the best advantage. How-
ever restricted may be present efforts to
ensure “full employment,’,’ certain it*is
that what is being done is costing the
country a great deal through taxation,
the same as social services. And very
often there is an additional cost to in-
dustry, passed on to the people by way of
higher prices, through having to defer to
the Government’s policy as regards em-
ployment regardless of efficiency. A
shorter working week, higher wages and
more holidays are also in fashion.
A third part of the “Labor” policy in
Australasia has been to bring about the
socialisation of some essential functions,
•more particularly banking. In New Zea-
land the biggest trading bank has re-
cently been over by the Govern-
ment, while, of course, the Central Re-
serve Bank has always been a Govern-
ment-dominated concern. In Australia
the Commonwealth Bank is now con-
trolled by the Treasury, ip the ultimate,
and the trading banks are subject to
central-bank direction in matters of
major financial policy.
So a great deal has been done by
“Labor” in the South Seas to further*
State ownership or control of essential
functions and to curb the initiative of
private enterprise, while, through a sys-
tem of income-redistribution (by .taxa-
tion) and credit-expansion, the amount of
money in the hands of wage- and “bene-
fit”-receivers has inflated greatly. • t
But the plain, undeniable outcome of
the whole programme has been a heavy
fall in per capita production and a rise in
costs, entirely frustrating the objective of
higher living standards for the popula-
tion and jeopardising the industrial and
economic structure of each country.
This startling truth has prompted the
issue of warnings from several sections
of the Labor party, the first being that
from F. P. Walsh, economic adviser to
Maoriland Labor interests. Mr. Walsh
stressed the fact that the only way to
increase living standards was by the pro-
duction of more goods and services. And
he advised, as an immediate policy, not
a plan of deflation to cure the unbalanced
relation between the quantity of money
available and goods, but a programme of
greater production to beat the evils of
inflation, at the same time raising living
standards. The best way to bridge the
gap between money and goods was by
productive effort, he said, adding, “if we
do not close this gap by our own efforts
it will be closed by an inflation of prices,
perhaps by a deflation of money and in-
comes.” The battle for minimum wages
had been won in New Zealand ; now the
battle was for production. “We are
asked,” said Mr. Walsh, “to contribute
something more to the economic system
than our labor; we are asked to play a
part in solving, its problems and improv-
ing its efficiency.”
This sane Labor man summed up the
position thus: “The only solution to our
problem is increased production. I stress
again the point that if we are to have
higher standards of living we must have
more goods and services. Our m ove ment
is no longer just fighting for wages. We
want to increase actual standards of liv-
ing. To do this we must increase pro-
duction. Real standards come from pro-
duction, not from the printing of a note-
issue.” Mr. Walsh might have added:
“Or from elaborate social - security
arrangements op front full-employment
schemes that do not have as a primary
function the efficient production of de-
sirable goods and services.”
The obvious failure of production to
keep in step with (a) wage-payments and
“ 'S always like it. After I tidy up I caan't never find anything .”
social-security distributions and ( b ) the
manpower engaged in the “full-employ-
ment” programme must give serious-
minded members of the Labor party food
for thought. Up to date the economic
plannings of “Labor,” both in New Zea-
land and Australia, have been a failure
—they have not, in other words, achieved
the higher standards of living and pros-
pects of economic security that their
sponsors forecast. It is true that the war
added to the economic and production
difficulties of the situation, but it is
equally true that war emergency facili-
tated revolutionary economic and social
changes that would havp met with politi-
cal opposition and delay in peace-time.
The theory of socialism that prompts
at least a large part of “Labor’s” policy
both in Australia and New Zealand has
brought severe disappointment. Wage-
earners have accepted all that has
been “given” to them mostly in
the form of mortgages against their
own future production without ac-
cepting responsibility in return; and
while the discretion and disciplinary
powers of their private employers
have been reduced, the dictator-
ship of the trade-union boss over them
has grown by • contrast, and often the
wage-earner has to bow before the
tyranny of regimented minorities, such as
the Communists.
Politically and economically Australia
and New Zealand are sadly finding them-
selves halfway along the road to no-
where. Under a state of semi-socialism
production has failed, and many of the
beneficiaries (in a paper-money sense)
under Labor’s social programme have
bjeen guilty of wanton misbehavior
against the State on the industrial front.
Discredited radicals in the Labor
movement any day now are likely to be
heard demanding full socialisation of in-
dustry as being necessary to achieve pro-
duction objectives and to redress previous
failures. There will be pleas that it takes
years of re-education of the people and a
full programme of socialism in order to
achieve success. But there will be others,
within Labor and outside of it, who will
jib at the thought of such a desperate
revolution, and will prefer to stand by
democratic principles and free enterprise,
subject to social security in proportion to
the nation’s productivity and to wage-
control by competent and impartial
tribunals.
Already it looks as though, in Aus-
tralia, Labor is dividing into two forces
—one that urges still more radical mea-
sures in order to pull success out of
failure and another that is inclined to
retreat somewhat and try to consolidate.
In any case inadequate industrial pro-
-8 duction has become No. 1 political issue.
It is hurting tens of thousands of people
to realise that the Government lOU’s
they hold have to be met by themselves.
The Australian sharemarket has shown,
on the whole, remarkable stability since
quotations for all stocks were freed early
in January. Many observers forecast a
fall in the market soon after the first
upward rush ; but, though there has been
an understandable reaction from the
highest points reached, and a justifiable
drop in the case of retailer stocks, steadi-
ness has been the keynote of dealings in
the main. After a wide demand still ex-
isting for almost all production the pros-
pect ahead of industry is full activity as
soon as labor is willing—and in all sanity
we must plan on labor eventually coming
back to commonsense. With reasonable
profit-margins allowed by the Prices
Branch and taxes reduced the proprietary
side of industry would then appear to be
in line for a reaping of the profits which
have for so long been denied it. In any
case the depreciation in our currency has
to be allowed for in valuing business en-
terprises and shares in them.

In the textile group of Stock Exchange
investments Bradford Cotton has become
probably the most interesting. Its capital
has shown prodigious expansion over the
past 10 years, but capitalisation has by no
means outrun the growth of the actual
value of the assets or the earning-power
of the organisation. The co. has had its
share of troubles on the labor side—
scarcity of female mill-hands has been
one of the restricting factors in present
earning—but the co. has succeeded in
maintaining a 10 p.c. div. for the past
seven years. It bought control of Austral
Silk and Cotton Mills, Victoria, early in
the war, and it has established Bradford
Cotton Spinning Mills in the same State,
as well as Bradford Cotton Weaving
Mills. Then there is C. and D. Mills
(canvas and duck) as well as the parent
in N. S. Wales, and Sanforising Services
of Australia, which preshrinks the cotton
cloths turned out. A New Zealand sub-
sidiary is part-owned by Felt and Textiles.
There are 741,889 fully-paid ords. issued
on the parent’s register, as well as 370,945
contribs paid to 2s. 6d., and £153,104 of
6 p.c. pref, money. The fully-paid ords.
are at 535. in the market, at which figure
the yield is £3 15s. per cent, on a 10 p.c.
div. basis, £4 14s, per cent, if the pre-war
rate of 12j p.c. is restored. Much depends
upon the availability of labor. There is
a huge market for the co.’s products. It
has not yet been made quite clear as to
what purpose the contributing capital,
when called, will be put.
* * * *
Yarra Falls shares have been»among
those fairly readily available at below the
maximum pegged price for 1946. Highest
sale last year was at 545. 9d. Last week
there was turnover at 495. The co. has
been affected severely by labor scarcity
both at the Abbotsford plant and at the
Globe Mills in Sydney, and that is mainly
the reason for the fall in the dividend
from the steady pre-war 10 p.c, to 9 p.c.
now. The co., however, remains the
leader among Australian woollen textile
cos., and its products have become the
standard of the trade. When labor con-
ditions become freer the co. will
have wide marketing opportunities, and
it should be helped on the competitive
side by the fact that at June 30 last it had
stocks on hand valued at £978,746. Wool
since then has taken a steep rise. This
stock position may prove neither an ad-
vantage nor a disadvantage so far as the
home market is concerned, the Govern-
ment granting a subsidy to offset higher
cost of raw wool, but there should be a dis-
tinct benefit to the co. as regards exports.
5{J %
Savings-bank deposits in the Common-
wealth stood at £653.8 million on Dec. 31.
This represents a fall of £l3 million from
the peak reached at the end of August.
Much of the decline has occurred in
N. S. Wales savings. One reason for it
has been the greater spending of war-time
accumulations by the people ; another has
been the slackening in deferred-pay and
other types of service income, loss of pay
caused by strikes, and a reduction in
Federal Government expenditure. Be-
cause “full employment” has not been
accompanied by a corresponding growth
in the real national income there has been
a feeling for some time that artificial con-
ditions surrounded the growth in the pub-
lic’s savings, and a setback has been ex-
pected. It is likely, in addition
that when production does rise to a satis-
factory level there will still be a tendency
for savings-bank deposits to fall by reason
of the opportunity that will open up for
spending on desired goods, homes, etc.

, 2,7 th August, 1946.
The books and accounts of the Rural Bank Department and Advances for Homes Department of the Rural Bank of New South Wales
have been examined and audited, for the year ended 30th June, 1946, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 29 and 30 of the Government
Savings Bank Act, 1906, and my report has been forwarded to the Colonial Treasurer.
In conjunction with my report I have to state that, in my opinion, these Balance Sheets correctly set out the financial position of the
Rural Bank Department and Advances for Homes Department as at 30th Jane, 1946, according to the best of my information and to
the explanations given to me and as shown by such books and accounts ,
SYDNEY, 7th January, 1947. E. H. SWIFT, Auditor General for N.S.W,
High Export Income, Low Output
Australia’s unprecedently large export _
income at the present time is principally
the result of big wool shipments at higher
prices ; but flour exports are bringing in
a greater income, too, while rabbitskins,
preserved meats, eggs, tinned milk, woven
and knitted textiles, metals and metal
manufactures, iron and steel have become
almost major items on the list. Butter and
sugar have failed to return to pre-war
levels either in volume or value in our
export figures, seasonal conditions being
largely to blame.
During the six months to December
31 wool sold in the Comonwealth totalled
1,180,350 bales (1,471,320 bales were
appraised in the same period of the pre-
ceding year), bringing in £34.8 million,
compared with £30.3 million for the larger
number of bales appraised in 1945.
Average price per bale in the latest half-
year was £29 Is, lid. for greasy, com-
pared with an appraised price of
£2O 9s. sd. in 1945. Greasy, in other
words, is up 44.8 p.c. a pound so far this
season, and scoured wool 59 p.c.
Export figures are not so up-to-date
as brokers’ totals; but to the end of
November, 1946, we shipped 495 million
lb. of greasy wool, compared with 235
million lb. for the same part of 1945, and
313 million lb. in 1938. Value of all
wool sent away was £52 million for the
five months of 1946, £23.6 million 1945.
A good deal of export wool may be com-
ing out of stocks held here fey Joint
Organisation, some of which may be
already paid for by overseas interests;
but on current brokers’ figures alone it
is clear that our overseas funds should
rise steeply for some time to come, parti-
cularly as imports are not increasing at
the same rate. The total clip for the year
is now estimated at 3,107,878 bales, and
only a little more than a third of it has
been sold, much less shipped.
Present wool clip is not a record, but
the industry has maintained production
well, considering seasonal and other diffi-
culties. Wool remains the solid core of
our export income, and it is a greater
source of dollars than ever. The United
States took 152 million lb. of wool in the
five months to November (about 500,000
bales) compared with 94 million lb.
(about 300,000 bales) in the preceding
period. Value of all exports to the U.S.A.
in the latest period was £22.7 million,
compared with £7.5 million in the 1938
period. We are also picking up useful
currency through our exports (flour,
canned foods, etc.) to British Malaya,
to which our exports in the latest
five months were close on £ll mil-
lion, compared with £2.5 million 1938.
Altogether, in the five months to the
end of last November Australia’s favor-
able overseas balance amounted to £47.6
million sterling, or about £6O million
Australian. There are indications that
this balance will go on building up for a
period, though we are in urgent need of
overseas products, the obtaining of which
would naturally increase the cost of
imports and reduce the favorable balance.
It is already likely that tea will cost us
more in the near future. But the outlook
so far as volume of essential imports is
concerned is not very. favorable. Both
Britain and the United States are experi-
encing production difficulties, and other
countries are very often worse off, or,
like Sweden, picking their markets selec-
tively for various reasons, one being the
need for rehabilitating neighboring Euro-
pean countries.
There have been times in the past when
it would have been to Australia’s ad-
vantage to cut down on imports of nearly
every kind. Now, however, we are in
vital need of certain imports, particularly
in the way of machinery and factory
plant, motor vehicles, cotton clothing,
other textiles and furnishing drapery.
The credit position of the country, too,
might be the better off if we could con-
vert part of our overseas funds into goods
available on the Australian market, seeing
that a continual danger within this
country nowadays is credit inflation and
commodity underproduction.
In spite of our high export income, the
local market is undersupplied with most
manufactures. Wage-earners are not pro-
ducing at pre-war rates in spite of “full
employment” ; they are repeatedly strik-
ing for higher pay, a shorter working
week and more holidays. Inflation thus
remains menacing, but price-control
weighs heavily on many businesses, dull-
ing incentive, especially when allied with
high taxation. At the present time the
pastoralist who has wool should be doing
well out of wool, on the whole, though he
will be taxed heavily ; the rest of the eco-
nomy will be at sixes and sevens, largely
because of labor indiscipline and insuffi-
cient Government regard for the interests
of private industry and appreciation of in-
dustry’s value to the community,
“Joint Organisation” held 4 b 406,600
bales of Australian wool on June 30 last
—3,449,700 bales in Australia, 881,700
bales in Britain and 75,200 bales in the
United States. During the six months to
Dec. 31 last Australian brokers received
2,462,202 bales into store, sold 1,180,350
bales, shipped 5248 bales for sale over-
seas, and had 1,276,604 bales in store
awaiting disposal at Dec. 31. Average
price of greasy wool sold was £29 Is. lid.
a bale during the six months, compared
with £2O 9s. sd. for the corresponding
period of the preceding year. During
1945-46 total sales of Australian wool,
current clip and out of store, totalled
5,124,300 bales, while N.Z. wool sold to
the extent of 1,365,000 bales and South
African to 1,687,800 bales. Some pur-
chasing countries, France in particular,
appear to be building up stocks. A
special loan of £12,500,000 sterling is being
granted by Britain to France in order to
finance wool purchases during 1947,
* * * *
In the two years to August 31, 1946,
the Disposals Commission sold surplus
stock and war materials for receipts of £66
million, including £lO million from over-
seas buyers. By the end of 1946 total sales
are reputed to have exceeded £BO million.

The price of Australian tin going into
home consumption has been increased by
£35 a ton for concentrates,’or about £5O
a ton for the metal, making roughly £433
a ton for the metal, compared with £475,
Australian currency, for tin in London.
Premiums that were being paid to “high-
cost producers” in Australia have now
been withdrawn. Nearly all production
is used in the home market.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: I was whirling the hurley
on the Terrigal beach for Blue-bay
Brannigan, a large man with the kind of
fingers which sandworms can’t escape,
and we entertained pleasant anticipations
of a feed of whiting. A small crowd of
holiday-makers had gathered round eye-
ing the proceedings and emitting noises
of astonishment every time Blue-bay
yanked a worm from the sand. One chap
was full of questions, and he duly learned
that Blue-bay had been catching worms
all his life, that they were the bait for
whiting and that most of the warm flat
eastern beaches had them. “What’s the
biggest one y’ ever caught?” he asked.
Blue-bay pondered and replied “Well, I
once got a eight-footer up Yamba way.”
“Aw, that’s nothin’,” said our* inter-
locutor. “When we was diggin’ the Syd-
ney docksite the scoops pulled ’em up
as thick as broomhandles.” Blue-bay
stood up slowly and squinted at the sun.
“Time we wasn’t here, mate,” he mur-
mured. “If this bloke starts fishin’ he’ll
be catchin’ whales on bardi grubs before
we know it.” And, leaving the ex-dock-
digger bogged in his own imagination, we
drifted.

“Sou’-west”; Fish bait has its cycles
of fashion. I recall a time when the
Westralian skipjack (trevally to Eastern-
ers) could be caught at Fremantle only
with a bait compounded from boiled
mutton (tinned) and pollard. The meat,
as a result of the boding under pressure
necessary for successful canning, was so
soft that it could be worked up to a sort
of putty with the pollard. Demand
became so great that Fremantle store-
keepers took to ordering whole cases of
that variety of “tinned dog.” The present
generation of skipjack anglers never
heard of such a bait. They use prawn
and “cray.” Nevertheless, the old bait
hasn’t lost its attraction. With boiled
mutton and pollard I recently went out
with a party and got the catch of the
day.

“Jemalong Jim”: Suicide by magpies
allowing themselves to be run down by
motor-cars on country roads may be a
new fashion among Victorian carollers
(B. 29/l/’47), but it’s been common in
N.S.W. for years, and it has been com-
mented upon by Aboliars before. With
Waroo Walters I once spent the best part
of a week investigating the thing on the
roads around Cootamundra. We arrived
at three conclusions: (a) the fowls were
after the fine grit on the roads; (6)
they’re so used to immunity from man
that they don’t believe any man would
“Go for your life! He's a shark-eating fellow from Sydney."
deliberately run over them; and (c)
they’re so puffed up with pride in their
speed on the wing that they completely
mistime their take-off.

“M.U.R.”: I’ll never jeer at women
motor-drivers (B. 29/1/’47) again. It’s
about five miles from my place to town
by main road, and when the car broke
down for want of a part I went out on
the road and waited for a lift. Along
came Codfish Collins, the engineer, who’d
been driving cars for donkey’s years, and
I climbed in. He chucked his gears in
and left them to sort themselves out,
tore along at a full 15 m.p.h., hugging the
crown of the road, yelled at every oncom-
ing car which passed within a chain, was
off and on the pavement at every corner,
rode foot-brake and clutch pedals all the
way, seldom took his hand off the horn
and drove in a perpetual state of tension.
I did the journey home with the flapper
daughter of a neighbor who considered
anything under 45 m.p.h. as crawling, and
I enjoyed every mile of it.

“Notaden”: The ancient fable about
lightning never striking twice in the same
place has again been disproved, A pine-
tree on a farm near Lismore (N.S.W.)
was hit during each of three successive
recent storms within a very few weeks.
The first stroke lopped off its top, the
second split it down the centre, the third
splintered the upper half of the trunk.
Jt had never been struck before, and
although numerous alternative targets
were offered by surrounding trees, none
of them shared its fate. A similar hap-
pening occurred in Victoria in the late
’9o’s, when a 40-year-old Norfolk Island
pine was struck four times within three
months, the last stroke destroying it com-
pletely. None of 20-odd similar trees in
the same row had ever been struck, nor
had they been 20 years later, when cut
down.
“Nor’-west”; *So that “Overfanders”
film “becomes an epic” because it depicts
the driving of a whole 1000 head of cattle
from the Ord River to the Queensland
coast, and that in 1.942. In June, 1883,
the Duracks, along with Kilfoyle and
Hayes, drove 5000 head in the reverse
direction and over a much greater dis-
tance. A start was made from the tri-
angle formed by the junction of the
Thompson River with Cooper’s Creek
(S.Q.) In the van went Jerry* Durack,
with 1300 head; a day’s march behind
came Johnny, his brother, with 1200; a
couple of days behind, Kilfoyle and
Hayes with their 1200; Mick Durack
and his young brother brought up the
rear with the last 1200. Much of the
route was over country seldom trodden
by a white man, and a lot of it was
known only to abos. Time taken, two
years and nine months. That drive
brought the cattle to the W.A. Kimber-
leys for the stocking of the Argyle, the
Lissadel and the Denham stations.

“Bad Australian”: I have often heard
it said the platypus is fast approaching
extinction, but where is the evidence?
They are found in practically every
coastal stream from Cape York Penin-
sula, through Queensland, N. S. Wales
and Victoria to South Aus.; in every
stream and permanent lagoon on the vast
watershed of the Murray, and in Tas-
mania as well. I have shot specimens in
the Burnett (Q.) just above tide-water
and in a mountain pool in the Southern
Dividing Range, 4000 ft. above sea-level;
and I have heard of them at a much
greater height. The animal is very
wary and difficult to approach, and
is seldom seen between sunrise and
sunset, except in close, cloudy weather.
The difficulties and disappointment
experienced by amateur observers in
attempting to catch a glimpse of him
appear to have led to the erroneous con-
elusion that Paradoxus is on his way out.
He has no aquatic enemy except, possibly,
the Murray cod. And as the main
entrance to his nest is located below
water-level, he is safe from attack by
dog, fox, cat or other land animal, and
should any of them attempt to dig him
out the underwater exit affords him a
safe and sure means of escape. Given
protection from his only dangerous
enemy, man, the platypus has a much
greater chance of survival than any other
member of our unique fauna.

“C.E.”: Len, riding up, spotted Dad
Wilson slumped over his cowyard gate,
a picture of gloom. “It’s me dawg,” Dad
explained. “Lent ’im t’ old Pearson f’r a
few days, an’, cripes, a man’s lorst with-
out ’hn. Keep lookin’ round f’r ’im at
meal-times when I finish me bones, an’
listenin’ f’r ’im in the night when the
cows feed a bit close. I tell y’, the place
just ain’t the same.” He stopped to gaze
aimlessly round the empty yards. “Aw,
well, it’s only till the day after t’morrer,”
he sighed, “An’ I bet I don’t lend ’im
again.” “How does the wife take it?”
asked Len. “Miss him round the place,
too?” “Yair,” Dad mused. “I s’pose she
.., er... eh? Aw, cripes—she don’t
even know,” he added. “She’s stoppin’ in
town this week t’ be near the doc. Funny,
y’ know, ’ow I keep f’gettin’ Mum ain’t

“West”: Crossing a kind of common
near Wellcamp (Q.) with our mob of
hornies we had trouble with a few
poddies and old milkers, evidently in-
dignant at our mob’s encroachment on
their domain. Suddenly there came
careering down an old boy, who seemed
to favor everything on a big scale —red
bushy beard, huge steel-studded blucher-
boots, old draught mare. He pulled up
with a flourish. “Mind if I look over
yer mob?” he asked. I told him to go
ahead. He trotted down through the
centre of the mob glancing from side to
side, wheeled and came back. (He must
have had a good eye ; there were 1100 in
our mob and it took him no more than
10 minutes to look through them!) “No,”
he said. “Nothin’ in them. O’ course
I didn’t expeck to find any in your mob.”
“Then you’ve lost some stock?” I said.
“Yeah,” he replied. “Some thievin’
hound of a drover pinched three o’ me
poddies ’bout four years back. But
they’ll turn up one o’ these days.”

“N.7Y.”: I once saw a blue heeler
tackle a lady donkey. Accustomed to
handling horses and cattle as they came
—at any pace, under any conditions—she
beat the donk.; but it wasn’t till she’d
been staggered and knocked breathless.
There’s an art in a donk.’s kick. They
don’t telegraph their punches, as a horse
or a cow does ; they lash from a standing
start, from ground level. In addition to
that unleashed lightning there’s also the
elasticity of the donk.’s body and legs
Next to a donk. I’d place the camel as a
quick-delivery artist. He’s a bit slow
but when he gets there he lands heavy.

“Horseless Horseman” ? “Lazarus” (B.
15/1/’47) is right; goannas swallow eggs
whole. At Tammit homestead (mid-
Murray) an egg-eating go. came along
once and we couldn’t get him. Then one
day he died in the yard. On opening
him up to get the fat a station-hand
found a china egg in his stomach.

Mat’s Mate”: The talk had got on to
shooting at running targets with a rifle,
and first'one and then another told of
prowess at the art. “That’s all right,”
said Mat. “But you’re talkin’ about
things that run mostly straight ahead.
All y’ gotta do is judge the pace and aim
at their nose an’ y’ got ’em. But try
shootin’ a bronzewing pigeon on the
wing. That’ll stop y’. Them birds is
fast an’ they zigzag from side t’ side like
lightnin’. Any man can drop one of
them with a rifle while it’s flyin’ has got
somethin’ t’ skite about.” There was a
silence. Then it dawned on one of them
that Mat was actually claiming to be able
to do it. “Hey,” he said, “how do you
go on ’em, Big-’un?” Mat grinned his
slow grin. “Well,” he said, “I reckon I
ain’t bad. I can’t guarantee t’ bring ’em
down, but I’ll bet y’ every time I aim at
one I’ll hit either the zig or the zag.”

“B, A. Ker”: Raddle’s education must
have been sadly neglected if he honestly
thought he could have a few games of
snakes and ladders in half an hour
(“X.E.D.,” B. 25/12/’46). Through three
torrential days two mates and I
“squatted” in a deserted humpy. All the
former tenant had left were a game of
snakes and ladders and half a tattered
Bible. If anybody had told any one of
us that we would wrangle over the right
to read a Bible we’d have told him to
stick to raspberry sodas; but after the
first day things developed that way. To
give it a sporting flavor we agreed that
the winner of a game should have the
reading matter until another winner
arose. Several games finished within a
couple of hours, but one hadn’t finished
at the luncheon adjournment. Interest
was maintained only by placing a levy
of threepence on every snake slipped
down, and a bounty of a penny for every
ladder climbed. The jackpot grew sub-
stantial —every time victory looked in
sight the last snake (the one about ninety-
five) brought one or other of us back
almost to tors, 'if Fred hadn’t conceived
the idea of altering the rules so that you
slid up snakes and down ladders we
might have still been there,

“Gravelsnatcher”; The egg came be-
fore the chicken, I know, because al-
though eggs can be produced without the
assistance of chickens—the Army turned
them out by the thousand—l’ve never
struck a chicken whose descent couldn’t
be traced directly to an egg. But which
came first: the honey flow, or the in-
sects which, harvesting it, fertilise the
flowers that produce it for that purpose?
Each owes its being to the other, the
insects because the nectar is their sole
source of food, and the nectar because,
the insects being its sole reason for ex-
istence, without them it would quickly
be displaced by an intolerant nature. It’s
hard to imagine either of two so com-
pletely interdependent quantities existing
without the other, unless both are mutu-
ally assisted adaptations. The fore-
runners of nectar-bearing plants could
quite easily have employed winds for
conveying pollen, and the insects may, at
some time, have subsisted on a totally
different diet, succumbing gradually to the
attraction offered with such advertisement
by the plants. But how could the plants
know that their experiment would be a
success, since conceivably they were the
first manufacturers of sweetness? Did
they experiment with other attractions
first? There seem to be some grounds
for attributing to plants an intelligence
with which they are not usually credited.
A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW.
We climbed the incline to Red Hill; the
panorama ran
From Michelago in the south around to Quean-
beyan.
Canberra sprawled beneath our feet —a geo-
metric spate
Of ovals, squares .and parallels where loosely
congregate
Officials and Ambassadors; where Senators and
Reps.,
By turning Bills to Acts, direct a nation’s
social steps.
An air of calm and quietude lay on the grassy
steep;
I placed a “Hansard” ’neath my head and
promptly fell asleep
A hundred years, meseemed, had passed. Un-
like Van Winkle, I
Had grown no long-outmoded ziff; but feel-
ing strangely dry
I headed for the nearest pub and, halting half-
way down,
Discovered some amazing change had fallen
on the town.
Its leafy vistas had become a mesh of narrow
lanes
O’erhung with pointed roofs of tiles; by evil-
smelling drains
Played yellow post-Canberra kids; their Mongol
mothers wore
The blouses and the wooden clogs of Sino-
Singapore.
No racecourse, links or cricket ground; no
tennis court, no square
Or bathing pool or tulip bed was present any-
where.
I hailed a passing taxi-cab: “Go to the House,”
I said.
The driver with a servile grin inclined his
shaven head
And whisked me to an eating place, where on
a gilded sign
Announcements of long soup were set and
dim sims extra fine.
There, through a pale American, I gathered
that Event,
In nineteen ninety-nine about, had ended Par-
liament !
“Air yew a stranger here?” he said —I dared
not speak the truth,
I told him I had seen the place in very early
youth,
But it was altered out of sight; thereat my hat
I found
And, bolting from the restaurant, began to look
around
That striking Austral-Asian town which, one
perceived anon, >
Presented all the features of a suburb of
Canton.
In sooth, my friends, I failed to find on'e land-
mark of the age
Of Menzies, Evatt, Lang and Ward and Calwell
and Earle Page!
No proud officials poured at five from public
buildings where •
The Application Forms were filed. “Advance
Australia Fair”
Not once I heard, but in its stead a still more
fearsome tune,
Like tomcats on a darkened roof complaining
to the moon.
No footprints left on sands of time by legis-
late shoes
Were visible; and nowhere stood a bust of
Billy Hughes.
Of Chifley not a whiff remained; nor of that
statesman who
Had won a war by shortening pants a careful
inch—or two.
The Immigration Office? No! A pawnshop,
in its place,
Behind a window-pane displayed, alas, the
Speaker’s mace!
In shopping centres slant-eyed girls sold sugar,
rice and tea
To slant-eyed buyers and their wives—which
goods were coupon-free.
In wayside stalls the chopsticks clicked; while
from a lane near by
Uprose in wailing dingo tones a sad fish-
vendor’s cry.
The ancient odors of Foo-Chow prevailed
where’er I walked,
And phantoms of the What-Had-Been and
mocking shadows stalked.
I wakened from that occult trance —inspired
perchance by fears
That all might not go well with us the next
one hundred years;
For while we talk and talk and talk, old
Time’s compelling brow
Has' frowned a warning to the land —“Wake
up! And do it now!”. . .
The memory of this vision strange on sunny
Lookout Hill
I have not from my mind effaced—l doubt I
ever will.

“Bufo”: There is much to be said for
scorpions as pets. They do not bark or
miaow at night and never spill their seed
or water over the carpet. Nor do they
screech, swear, tear holes in the curtains
or have kittens in the shirt drawer. They
are no trouble to feed —one of the pantry
blowflies or a couple of silverfish from
one’s Sunday suit Will keep the pet con-
tented for days. They are admirably
affectionate mothers —at least until the
babies leave the maternal back to fend
for themselves. Then mother is liable to
eat them, but lots of other mothers would
like to do the same if they had been
looking after a family of 30 for weeks
together. But to any prospective scorpion-
lover let me give one word of warning.
They have absolutely no head for drink.
To Bill, the best-mannered scorp. I ever
met, I offered a friendly drop of rum
on the end of a twig as he sat at the
burrow entrance after sunset. He sucked
it eagerly and waved his claws for a re-
peat. Refused a third, he dashed into the
burrow and in less than five minutes
backed out gripping his unfortunate wife,
Emmeline. Before I could intervene he
had completed a substantial meal from
the poor lady’s back, and by next morn-
ing both were dead.

“Red Hot”: Canecutters on the
Clarence River (N.S.W.) have nothing to
learn from the “sloggers” at Victoria
Mill (B. 1/1 / ’47). Last season the top
gang of five men cut 6713 tons of cane,
averaging 9.8 tons and £3 ss. Id. a man
per day. Three other gangs were not
far behind —six men averaged 9.3 tons
and £2 19s. lid., seven men 8.8 tons and
£2 16s. 3d., five men 8.3 tons and £2
14s. 4d, In three cases, including the
top gang, a cook was employed. Two
severe floods preceded the harvesting of
this crop.

“Bogaduck” in a sceptical mood;
I won’t have tha|®Brn about the water

stood up to a really scientific test. Most of
the “tests” which its believers quote merely
prove that water can be struck in lots of places,

whether a man walks along with a stick or
not. Professor Kerr Grant, of Adelaide, a
man with a keen sense of humor, declared that
he had never seen anything funnier than a
mob of dowsers led across a paddock, one
at a time, selecting different spots but not
t „ Place where the big
trunk mam irom the Happy Valiev reservoir
ran under the ground. Where the rod is used,
water is struck in 72 per cent, of cases. So
it is where you sink your well or put down
your bore by blind stabbing. But where
geologists make the choice you’ll get drinkable
water in 88 per cent, of cases.
One of my job's in the Army was selection
of sites for water points near camps. In
sandhill country I would first look for a spot
where aborigines had camped—revealed usually
by discarded stone tools lying round and a
kitchen midden of ashes, bones and shells.
Knowing that natives never camped far from
water, I would find where their well had been.
Along dry creeks with sandy beds I would
look for spots where there was a good growth
of trees like redgums or swamp gums on the
banks, or for spots where dingoes and horses
had been digging up the sand to get a drink.
Yabbie burrows with pellets of mud outside
were good signs. On open country I looked
for grassy flats and studied the contours.
Some of the supplies were a bit brackish and
scanty but I never had a failure. I was often
pitted against a dowser and the bets always
made me richer and him wiser. For leading
you to a waterhole or spring there are two
guides which will never let you down —wild
pigeons, especially the bronzewing, and the
black cockatoo.

Alpine Willie”: The old recipe for
boiling a lump of quartz with cockatoo —
when a fork slips easily into the gibber
the fowl is fit for serving—has been tried
without success on the gang-gang of this
tribe. After steadily cooking for three
days the flesh had softened to the texture
of old motor tyre, and prolonged jaw
massage produced the delicate flavor of
a gumtree log. Alf carved a wing each
with the hacksaw and minced the breast
by holding it to the emery wheel for half
an hour. The remains still decorate the
vicinity of the staghound’s kennel. That
ravenous animal has since been unable
to masticate anything more solid than
skim milk.

“Shamuseen”: A Spartan shrub of
s.-w. Queensland is the emu apple, so
named from the belief that passage
through the emu’s digestive tract is essen-
tial to germination of the seeds. These
are of granite toughness, and boiling or
burning seems only to caseharden them
further. Though the belief may be either
superstitious or scientific, it is a fact that
the shrub occurs in only emu-infested
country and the bird relishes the fruit.
The plant defies all attempts at domestic
cultivation, and since the shrub occurs
usually in the midst of emu droppings it
seems feasible that it requires the power-
ful gastric juices of that bird to soften
the tough husks of the seeds by chemical
action.

“Flathead”: It was pay-day and we
were downing our weekly beer-issue; all
the boys are certain that we saw the
centipede. After it had made its entrance
to our tent under the flap facing Jacqui-
not Bay, New Britain, Lofty did the
atrocious deed by lifting the insect with
a stick and coiling him round the top
of the kerosene lamp. The “center”
bucked into the air and landed on the
floor in two sections, each of which
headed off in a different direction. Then
we discovered the fact that even now has
us worried. All along the back of both
sections was a line of luminous blobs,
giving the effect of a couple of miniature
trains with their lights on. Is there such
an insect?
« * * *
“C, Coral”: One pre-war activity in
which the islanders of Torres Strait gave
great service was associated with the
Coast Watchers. As a member of that
organisation it was my duty to keep ears
and eyes open for anything out of the
ordinary ; and my old friend Jimmy Susu
and his crowd of relatives assisted to the
utmost. Strange craft, unexpected white
or Asiatic visitors, floating wreckage and
bottles, mysterious night signals at sea, all
tr . u- , Jn i v f rirwnr HpH
came into the bag, to be duly forwarded
to Naval Intelligence headquarters,
Accredited reports of the first Japanese
sam p ans operating in the Strait, as well
i.
as mysterious craft thought to be
Jap submarines, came through this
channel. Accustomed to accurate obser-
vndnn the islander was able to give fairiv
vation, me islander was ame ro give x y
complete details of what hq saw, and
officials in the department praised this
aspect of Jimmy’s help,, On one occasion
a floating object of hitherto unknown
acquaintance was seen by a trochus cutter,
The boys swam to it, made careful in-
spection, and, concluding that it must
be a mine, attached the anchor coir and
all other rope they had. Cautiously they
towed it to a sandbank some miles away ;
then they made a sketch of the outfit
(including the lettering on one section),
and came in and “made report.” It was
a German mine. A naval party from
T.I. came out and did the killing, com-
plimented the boys on their action and
surprised them by handing over a fiver
as a reward. “My word!” said Jimmy
to me afterwards, “s’pose we find a mine
every day, he more better than getting
trochus! ”

“Plankton”: The apparent inability of
“turtles” to move backwards when caught
in a fence seems to be in similar case to
the heifer I found dead because it hadn’t
the sense to step back when it chanced to
put a hind hoof behind a small forked
stump. At Moreton Bay (Q.) 6ft.
sea-snakes often found in fishermen’s
nets quite easily pass their very small
heads and slim necks through the meshes,
but their Sin. thick bodies are much
too big. They never attempt to with-
draw, and consequently the men have to
pull them out backwards. Such occur-
rences are due not to any physical
peculiarity, but to the fact that a creature
of low intelligence is incapable of mental
adjustment to enable it to cope with un-
usual circumstances. Mention of the
unusual recalls that I have noticed mille-
pedes, or “thousand legs,” can go into
reverse with as much facility as they can
go forward.

“Geordie”: “Overange” (B. 1/1 /’47) is
right in debunking the claim that Jacky’s
powers of observation are super-normal.
The abo.’s quite commendable abilities
are due to his intensive training from
very early youth, and could be acquired
by his white brothers under the same
scheme of compulsory education. My
first year in Australia was spent wander-
ing in the wilds with a white bushman.
To my city-bred eyes his powers of direc-
tion-finding seemed miraculous, but they
were taken for granted by the old hands,
who had the same powers in common.
One night a thief sneaked all the cutlery
from under our wagon. The goods
were recovered by my mate after four
hours of tracking through rough
scrub. The only person surprised was the
thief, who thought the feat was possible
only to an abo., and who swore he would
never again trust to the blindness of a
>vhite man.

“M.H.”: “Zake” and his long cobber
(B. 8/1 / ’47) must live in a very back-
ward district. Long ago we covered
meat-ant nests with bags, bark, straw,
bullock hides and bushes. Later came
potassium cyanide ; a piece about as big
as a hen egg dissolved in a gallon of
water and poured over the nest would
kill every ant that walked over it as long
as any moisture remained. Now we have
arsenic pentoxide, used in solution. Pour
a pint or so down each hole and in a day
or two the nests will be deserted.

“Lower Tops’!”: It greatly interested
me to read that on January 10 three men
and three Geelong College boys were put
ashore on Rodondo, a 1200 ft.-high
mountain-peak-like island, six miles south
of the Wilson’s Promontory lighthouse,
which is passed by every vessel running
between Melbourne and Sydney. The
party, according to writers in the Mel-
bourne “Herald,” was the first to land
on the island, described as a “lost world”
containing strange flora and fauna,
Since between “The Prom.” and Flinders
Island, a distance of 70 miles, there are
a score of islands, identical in formation
with Rodondo, which, except for sheer
granite cliffs and hordes of sea con-
tain nothing of note, those who know
the strait were not surprised when a week
later the “explorers” returned to the
Promontory lighthouse and reported they
had discovered no water —which they had
anticipated by taking a distilling plant—
and only the usual mutton-birds. These
“Herald” writers don’t seem to have
heard of the Bass Strait sealers, who as
far back as 150 years ago began landing
on the islands and islets in the strait, in-
cluding Rodondo, to club and skin seals.
As late as 1910 strait men still living
were put ashore on Councillor Rocks,
40 miles south-east of Rodondo, and a
far worse spot, to seal under licence. Yet
a 66-year-old shark fisherman, A. G.
Smith, of Port Albert, who carries the
mail to the lightkeepers at the Promon-
tory, was written up as the only man
who could have put the party on
Rodondo!
* * * *
“Wandana”: Fishing from a 12ft.
boat at Bridport (Tas.) a man hooked
a “snapper shark” (as they are now
called) about 3ft. 6in. As he be-
gan to clean it for market 27
young ones up to nearly a foot hopped
out. Thrown into the water, they swam
off immediately, although perhaps the
fisherman might have yarded them for
future markets. There is a big demand
now for: “gummy” sharks ; the flesh sells
well, and possibly later on the Chinese
market for shark fins may be reopened.
In pre-war days North Queensland fisher-
men got good prices for shark fin and
other soup-making products.
♦ * * •
“Ken”: Pulled up on the range road
one night behind a powerful truck tow-
ing a six-roomed house on jinkers,. The
unusual caravan had halted at a bend
where a couple of 12in. white-painted
guide-posts at the side of the road barred
further progress. I couldn’t get past, so
I settled down prepared for a long wait
and an interesting lesson in modern
transport methods. But obviously the
hauliers had met similar situations be-
fore. After a guarded inquiry* as to
whether I was a Main Roads man, they
went to work with a couple of good
sharp saws and lopped off the posts about
a foot from the ground. The house
moved past, they carefully replaced the
posts on the stumps and skew-nailed
them on to keep them firm. A little putty
and a dash of white paint to camouflage
the scars of the operation completed the
job, and traffic was resumed after a
hold-up of little more than 15 minutes.

“Gryllus”: “Dronestung’s” suggestion
(B. 22/1/’47) that it would be possible to
evolve a strain of stingjess bees by gene-
rations of careful breeding is a few mil-
lion years out of date in this part of the
world. Of our nine indigenous Australian
species all are devoid of stings. Yet this
deprivation has not prevented them
through countless centuries from estab-
lishing their great nest-colonies, keeping
their queens alive and productive, and
storing greater quantities of honey than
are to be found in any average nest of
the imported stinging species when they
have gone wild.
BUTCHER BIRD.
Skirl of insects, drowsy chirpings on the languid
air are falling,
Fowls are shuffling in their dust-holes where
for coolness they have sought;
But there’s menace up the gully in the butcher-
bird’s grim calling—
“ Twenty-one chickens, oh, twenty-one chickens
I’ve caught, caught, caught!”
Wings a-shadow —then there’s flurry in an
overhanging sally
And the sparrows in a hurry plunge and
vanish swift as thought;
And the wicked little butcher flaunts above his
gruesome tally—
“ Twenty-one chickens, oh, twenty-one chickens
I’ve caught, caught, caught I”
Starts the thoroughbred old rooster, and his
weather-eye is cocking,
And his manly throat he’s clearing, and with
warning it is fraught;
And the hens relay the caution, while above
the butcher’s mocking—
“ Twenty-one chickens, oh, twenty-one chickens
I’ve caught, caught, caught I’ ?
Here’s an orange from the orchard and I pelt
the damned marauder,
And he’s gone—the fowls are dusting and
their lord’s no more distraught;
But the butcher flings his challenge from
beyond the orchard border —
"Twenty-one chickens, oh, twenty-one chickens
I’ve caught, caught, caught I”

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY IM SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
A National Land Policy.
Before a returned soldier
may take part in a land ballot he must
satisfy a board of practical men of his
qualifications and ability to manage a
property. It would be an excellent thing
for Australia if these requirements were
extended to every application to buy or
lease agricultural or grazing land, and if
other requirements were demanded of
present owners and lessees.
Here in Australia the man on the land.
is favored by Nature more than any-
where else in the world, and this has
tended to make us careless and shiftless.
We have our droughts, but in normal
seasons we rely on natural pastures to
carry our stock, to fatten them, rear their
offspring and grow wool.
An animal will produce meat or wool
according to how it is fed, and a well-
bred animal will give quicker and better
results than a mongrel. Six months of
flush feeding will pile on the condition
and grow a well-nourished fleece. But if
the following six months are rainless and
natural pastures fail the animals can sur-
vive only by drawing on their fat, while,
for lack of protein, the growth of wool
will be checked and its quality will de-
teriorate. Such checks on young stock
during the growing stage leave constitu-
tional defects that mark those animals
for life. Their growth remains stunted,
and they will never compare in size or
productivity with stock well fed during
the growing years.
In many parts of Australia natural
pastures are insufficient in winter to
carry more than a fraction of their sum-
mer stocking, yet attempts to supple-
ment this regular protein deficiency are
left in the hands of a few. Conservation
of fodder is still on far too small a scale.
In their wild state animals are free
to roam and choose their own pasture.
When rains fail and grass gets scarce
they instinctively move on in search of
better feed. But when a man puts a mob
of sheep into a paddock their move-
ments are restricted by fences, and when
they have eaten the paddock bare they
have got to stay until the man comes
along and shifts them. Man is entirely
responsible for the lives and welfare of
his stock, and any man who, wilfully or
through sheer bad management, allows
stock to perish is a menace to the country.
The pastoral industry would be better
off with fewer gamblers. The gamblers
realise that occasional bad years are in-
evitable, but instead of making provi-
sion for them they gamble on getting
enough out of a run of good seasons to
carry them through the droughts. They
will quote So-and-So, who hand-fed
u broke, and declare openly
that when the natural resources of their
properties fail the stock will have to do
the best they can ; they will not be hand-
fed.
As a result of drought N. S. Wales has
seen its sheep numbers drop by
10,000,000 in one year. War-time short-
ages of labor, fodder and transport were
partly responsible, but even in other cir-
cumstances many hundreds of thou-
sands would have been left to their fate.
Overstocking is more prevalent and
does more damage than the more spec-
tacular rabbit and grasshopper plagues.
Slowly people are beginning to realise
that something must be put back into the
soil to balance what is being taken out.
We still suffer from the old snobbery of
gauging a man’s importance by the num-
ber of sheep or cattle he owns, instead of
by their quality and productivity. It has
been proved beyond all doubt that three
acres reckoned capable of carrying three
sheep will produce more wool of greater
value from two sheep. This advantage
“ I s'pose if it Wasn’t for pigs there Wouldn’t be no pork.”
is further demonstrated in the better
growth and constitution of the two, their
better resistance to parasites and ability
to rear better lambs.
Generally speaking, the value of iand
in Australia is governed by rainfall.
Nevertheless, we have seen what water
conservation and irrigation will make of
a desert, and our chief hope of increas-
ing our country’s population lies in mak-
ing water available so that we may be
independent of the vagaries of Nature to
some extent. But it is essential not only
to make water available but to insist on
its being used intelligently.
During a recent drought two large ad-
joining stations with river frontages were
each limited to pumping the same
quantity of water from the river for
irrigation. One property lost a large
proportion of the 3000 sheep it kept, in
spite of additional feed purchased to fill
in the gaps. The other property fed 7000
with the aid of irrigation. It had an ex-
cellent lambing and a clip of normal
standard.
The spacious nineteenth-century days
of grazing have given way to the less
picturesque but more efficient combina-
tion of grazing plus farming. Science has
helped to overcome many of the stock-
owner’s problems, and will continue to
do so, but it is for the grazier to see that
he can keep touch and make use of the
scientist’s work.
There are hundreds of men on the land
who for a variety of reasons just can’t
get ahead of it. Although their neigh-
bors on the other side of the fence are
doing well, these chaps never seem to be
out of trouble. They are no good to
themselves, to the storekeeper or to Mt
Chifley. Would it not be far better for
all concerned if these properties were
resumed for soldier-settlement instead of
taking big properties that are being run
successfully and chopping them into ex-
perimental sections?
It is time that we had. a land policy
with a national character. Efficiency and
success are penalised by crippling taxa-
tion, while the bloke next door who
doesn’t make enough to pay tax on get's
sympathy and a subsidy.
Technical Terms.
“West”: Not every grazier knows,
though every grazier should know, the
true meaprng of many technical terms
used in connection with wool. Subjoined
is a list of those used most frequently
and generally.
Condition: The amount of grease or
yoke naturally present in raw wool; thus
heavy condition, light condition, etc,
Sound Staple: One which will not
break when a tension of 6 or 71b. is
applied. That is the approximate ten-
sion exerted when wool is being combed.
Tender Staple: Wool which will not
stand the combing tension.
Strong Wool: Often confused with
“sound” wool, it is used toi denote wool
of a rather coarse texture. “Strong”
wool is the opposite to “fine” wool.
Color: Refers to discoloration, brought
about mainly by heavy and prolonged
rain.
Wasty: Thin wool lacking body,
generally caused by adverse seasons.
Earth Waste; Refers to earth or sand
in the fleece.
Count: Term used mainly by manu-
facturers. It is used to denote the num-
ber of 560-yard hanks that can be spun
from one pound of combed “top” (i.e.,
64’s count means that 64 hanks can be
spun from one pound of “tops”).
Top: A term not often met with by
the grazier, but a short explanation of its
meaning will serve to amplify the defini-
tion of “count.” “Top” is applied to a
continuous band or ribbon of “combed”
fibres, laid parallel in an untwisted con-
dition ready for the drawing and spin-
ning operations. The “combing” process
removes all short and weak fibres, which
are termed “poil.”
Yield: Means the yield of scoured
wool after all impurities have been re-
moved.
Character: The evenness of the crimp
or wave, which indicates good breeding.
Herd Improvement.
“Archaps”: The herd - improvement
plan introduced in 1938 by the Maoriland
Dairy Board has enabled valuable data
to be collected. The board states that the
rate of improvement in per-cow produc-
tion has gradually diminished over the
past 20 years, and is at present practically
stationary. Observed improvement in
individual herds had been due mainly
to improved feeding through top-dressing,
better pasture management, etc., with an
associated increase in the length of lac-
tation, and to the rapid change in breed
composition of herds, rather than to
selection and elimination of low pro-
ducers.
Data show that the proven bull is all-
important because (a) to secure an im-
provement it is necessary that the 17 to
20 p.c. animals culled each year should
be replaced by animals of higher pro-
ducing ability ; (b) improvement possible
on the basis of selection of replacements
from higher-producing dams is very slow
—on the average only 15 p.c. of the dam’s
advantage is passed on to the progeny.
Expansion in herd numbers by about a
million cows since 1920 has limited the
scope available for selection, and as not
more than 30 p.c. of cows have so far
been tested, two-thirds of the farmers do
not know which are their highest-pro-
ducing cows.
The 1078 sire surveys conducted to
date indicate that only one in three of
the bulls has improved production in the
herd in which he has been used.
The board recommends, inter alia, that
the aim of breed societies should be to
have every pedigree calf sired by a proven
bull; that every pedigree herd should be
continuously recorded, the owner to
have the option of excluding any cow
from the annual herd average by cancel-
ling her registration ; sire surveying of as
large a proportion as possible of the
sires in use in the industry. While those
sires are still living, the use of the best
proven sires as as possible in
grade and, pedigree herds,
by the widespread use of artificial in-
semination ; the establishment as soon as
conditions permit of artificial insemina-
tion centres in the main dairying areas; in

A Pledge to the
Rimaty Producers
of Australia.
THE pent-up needs of primary producers,
restrained through years of war, have, by their
immensity, brought a tremendous problem to manu-
facturers of equipment in every part of the country.
Sources of supply In both raw materials and labour
do not nearly respond in a manner adequate to meet
the enormous demand.
Give us the raw materials and we shall fashion
the tools of primary production. That is a promise
for the future which explains tha delays of the past.
As conditions improve so will the output of our
assembly lines.
We are firmly resolved to give our best brains
and energy to the vital job of contributing to a
prosperous post-war period for the primary producer
whom it has been our privilege to serve for nearly
SO years.

purposes ; continuous recording of as high
a proportion as possible of herds to pro-
vide production data; running selected

indication of the bulls’ worth as early
as possible ; retention of herd sires in
the industry until such time as the merit
of their progeny has been determined ;
judging of dairy stock, at shows to be
placed on a sounder basis.
Lime and Potash.
“Myrr”: In some Vic. districts pastures
need more than super, for optimum de-
velopment. Poor soils in the Kilmore-
Wandong area and acid soils around
Inverloch require a lime dressing as well
as super. Experimental plots have been
established in each of these areas, and
the Department of Agriculture invites
local farmers to make regular inspections
to learn some of the results of field trials.
On the Wandong plot, super, without
lime gives poor results, whereas the
effects of super, and lOcwt. of agricul-
tural ground limestone to the acre have
been outstanding. Lime has also pro-
duced marked results on the sour plains
country around Inverloch near Western
Port, but on the better soils in this dis-
trict super, alone gives quite a good result,
although an addition of lime gives a
further benefit.
The Department has found that potash
makes for improved pasture growth in
soils which have been subjected to re-
peated cropping and mowing of the
pasturage, but recommends rotation of
the conservation paddocks, feeding back
the conserved fodder and the spreading
of farmyard manure to counteract
further the ill-effects of repeated mowings.
Raising Turkeys.
“Bennie”: Turkeys do well on a farm,
because they have ample range, which
allows them to get plenty of their natural
food in the form of grass and insects.
Low-lying wet areas are unsuitable.
Turkeys thrive best on light-soiled undu-
lating areas. Their natural roost is out
in the open, but in areas where there is
not a suitable belt of timber to give the
necessary protection some housing
methods have to be employed.
Houses should be built to permit a free
circulation of air. Lofty dwellings, open-
fronted, are the best, but if foxes and
dingoes are about more protection is
necessary. According to the number of
turkeys to be housed, build a shed in
the middle of the run, facing it north
and leaving an open space between back
wall and roof. The average turkey re-
quires a floor space of 14 square feet.
Construct movable perches about 3ft.
high all on the same level and about 3in.
or 4in. wide. Being sensitive, turkeys re-
quire encouragement to lay in new areas.
Build nests around the enclosure and try
to make them look as natural as possible.
Covering the tops and sides with bushes
is very effective.
Under North Queensland conditions
the best breed is the American Bronze,
a large and hardy bird.
Pressure for Bores.
“Atlanta”: Three artesian bores on
Elder, Smith and Co.’s Ambathalla
station, between Charleville and Adavale
(C.Q.), which ceased to flow in recent
years, have been brought to production
by using compressed air to replace natural
pressure. An air compressor powered by
a 20-h.p. Diesel engine drives air dov/n
a 200 ft. length of piping bolted inside the
bore casing, and this pressure is sufficient
to force water to the surface and flow
the drains with even greater volume than
before the bore stopped.
A series of small earth tanks along
each drain holds sufficient water to supply
the sheep while the equipment is moved
by tractor and wagon to the next bore.
Concrete foundations have been laid at
each bore in preparation for unloading
and functioning of the equipment.
Good Value.
“Handy Hints for the Farm” is the
winnowing of years of contributions to
the M.O.L, pages by practical farmers
and land workers. There are more than
1000 tips on pretty well every aspect of
farm work and they can hang on the
wall and be always available for Is. (Is.
2id. posted) from any newsagent or direct
from The Bulletin, 252 George-street,
Sydney.
Hints for the Farm.
“C.A.A.”: When horses have got at
the wheat purgative treatment should be
given as soon as possible by means of a
ball containing five drachms of aloes or
one pint of linseed oil with loz. turpen-
tine. This may be followed within about
four hours by four drachms of sodium
bicarbonate mixed with enough treacle
to make a paste and spread on the
tongue.
“E.M.R.”: An acre of lucerne or
clover is sufficient for 20 to 25 growing
pigs; this should save about \\ tons of
concentrates. If 90 p.c. of this saving is
grain it is approximately £l2 worth. The
saving is even greater if it means saving
your breeding pigs from slaughter be-
cause grain isn’t available.
“Xob33”: Hoeing is most essential in
the garden following rain. If it is not
done the surface soil hardens and bakes,
shutting out the air necessary for rapid
plant growth. Don’t hoe immediately
after the rain, wait till the surface soil
has dried; it is then that the loosening
retains the moisture in the ground as well
as allowing the air to percolate through
the soil.
“E.H.S.”: Oilstones frequently develop
an uneven surface through unequal wear.
When this occurs scatter a little emery
or fine sharp sand about as coarse as No.
2 sandpaper on an even-faced piece of
iron, add a little water and rub the stone
on it, renewing the emery or sand and
water as required, finishing with the addi-
tion of water without the abrasive. The
job takes from five to ten minutes, ac-
cording to condition of the stone.
“W. Court”: We’ve kept foxy dogs
and sold their pups for seven or eight
years. Sort out the culls soon after the
litter is born and drown them to save
the mother. Something solid like sacking
should be used on the kennel floor ; if
straw is used the pups will crawl under-
neath and be crushed or smothered by
the mother. Cut their tails early, using a
sharp razor. Encourage them to drink
milk out of a saucer at three weeks
and feed them scraps of raw meat as soon
as they will eat it.
“L.D.W.”: The air-tubes of milking
machines are often neglected during
cleaning in the dairy because it is thought
that milk could not possibly enter them.
This is wrong. These pipes, owing to
some of the milk spray being drawn into
them, will become very smelly after a
couple of months’ use. Suck through a
couple of gallons of warm water to which
half a teaspoon of hypochloride steri-
liser is added and then follow up with a
gallon of boiling water. This procedure
should be followed at least once every
two months to keep the pipes thoroughly
clean.
“Bill C.”: With all small crops it’s
essential to take precautions against
disease and insects. Branches dragging
on the ground give pests an easy foot-
hold. Bruising of stems or branches in-
vites the entry of pests or disease spores.
When tying up plants on stakes don’t
tie binders tightly; allow ample room
for stem expansion. Remember, too,
that a binder that is loose today may be
strangling in a month’s time,
“Bennie”: When the mercury in a
thermometer is divided hold the ther-
mometer in an upright position over a
slow heat. Run the mercury up in the
tube until the separation disappears in
the slight enlargement at the apex. Be
careful not to overdo it and break the
tube. As soon as the mercury joins re-
move the bulb from the heat, continuing
to hold it in an upright position until
the mercury fully recedes in the tube.

scenes.” He was able, too, in the state
of public interest, in the search, to give
an historical account of the gold dis-
coveries on the Grey Box and the gullies
running into it. “Old-timer,” “Pros-
pector,” “Turon” and “Old Bendigo”
spent months and months subsequently
correcting, adding to and refuting the
substance of Friar’s articles, and malign-
ing each other in the process.
But they didn’t find Joe. And so Joe
was elevated to the distinct honor of
being a mystery.
Certainly people “saw” him, as people
always do in such cases. Joe was seen
by reliable witnesses hundreds of miles
away, and carrying his swag; he was
seen in another direction altogether, and
travelling with a circus ; he was distinctly
noticed in a coach “with a very young
woman —and good-looking too.” Some-
one heard him testifying in the Salvation
Army in Sydney—it was Joe all right,
for he fairly bellowed when he talked of
what the “devil done for me —hell sweat
him! 1 ”
But Joe didn’t come back. And too
many people had seen him for anyone
of them to be believed.
Sim, as a simple duty,
'■ kept up the search. When Queens-
land Jacky was not with him he often
went over to Billy Rosen’s.
He generally called at Mrs. O’Meara’s
after such a visit to Billy’s. It seemed
that the old sergeant was highly sus-
ceptible to sunstroke, and an hour or
two in the shed was the only remedy.
“Shun-stuck” he called it.
At last the sergeant gave up the search,
and it was presumed that Joe was dead.
Only Andy McNair did not give up
hope. He mooned about Baker’s Gully in
a pathetic sort of way. Joe was pro-
bably the nearest approach Andy had
ever made to real friendship. Cattle
horned the hessian of Joe’s hut till most
of it hung in tatters from the poles, and
this hurt Andy beyond measure, as
though the cows were heartless; and
also to blame for Joe’s non-appearance.
Certainly that hut was mournful to look
upon, as indeed is any human habitation
when it is deserted and decayed. Mrs.
O’Meara got the boys to go up one day
and pull it down, and make a fire of the
lot. After that even Andy considered
that Joe was really gone.
Andy went no further in the matter
of a shaft in the vineyard. Injunction
orders were not needed now.
And yet old Sergeant Sim had been
right about the lantern that had per-
formed the incredible feat of walking
home. An early model of hurricane
it was, very trimly kept and well polished.
Perhaps Sergeant Sim had a good idea
of what had happened on that Saturday
night, when Joe had last used the lantern.
And, all things carefully considered, it
perhaps did not seem worth while to
pursue the line of inquiry too far. Cer-
tainly, the sergeant did say, one day at
Billy Rosen’s (it was the wet day when
he was so savagely attacked by the sun),
that he thought of looking over some
ploughed land somewhere or other. But
then he was suffering severely from sun-
stroke at the time, and it is doubtful if
anyone took much notice or understood.
But it was rather peculiar that the
Wilton boys should have ploughed their
creek paddock on a Sunday morning,
though the Wiltons were always doing
peculiar things. It wasn’t till years after
that anyone seemed to remember the cir-
cumstances at all. By then it was ancient
history, and mixed up, as history often
is, with a deal of conjecture.
Someone then said that it was a great
pity that a good detective hadn’t been
about at the time of Joe’s disappearance.
He would have cleared up the mystery
in no time. There was no great desire
for justice in the wish, and certainly no
affection for Joe ; rather it was the satis-
fying of curiosity.
On the fatal Joe had
gone over to Wilton’s and carried, as
Tim O’Meara had declared, his lantern
with him. He never returned.
Joe had known old John Wilton for
many years; in fact they had been ship-
mates as very young men on the old sail-
ing ship that brought them and many
others to the goldfields, then at their
height. Two men more dissimilar could
hardly be found anywhere. John was a
mild man, always ready to be agreeable
and be at peace with people. In this he
had plenty of practice, for his wife was
a big raw-boned woman who was always
finishing a war with someone, or starting
one, or in the middle of one. How John
married himself to such a woman no
one ever knew, but he actually seemed
proud of her: there is a genius in mild-
ness and peacemaking, as in all things.
Joe went over every Saturday to play
euchre. That anyone should play any-
thing with Joe seemed as something
among the rarer and higher miracles.
Yet it was so. Joe and Mrs. John, old
John and his brother Sam. Sam was
even milder than John —in fact so mild
that his intellect just ran to an under-
standing of euchre.
It is hard to say whether Joe liked
most the game or the fierce quarrelling
with Mrs. John. They quarrelled loudly
over the cards, and the game was really
between them—the other two were just
useful to hold the cards and complete
the game. They were used to Joe, and
didn’t mind his ways.
But on the night in question young
Sid Holt was at Wilton’s. A flash young
fellow was Sid, and Joe hated him for
that, and also most unreasonably for
Sid’s being sweet on one of the Wilton
girls. ,
IT seemed, according to Joe, that Sid
I should have been much ashamed and
abashed at being born so recently—no
one really worth while had been born
after Joe reached the age of ten. Also
Sid was a “hairless-faced boy,” and as
such should be kept in his place.
Sid not unnaturally resented all this,
and answered Joe in kind, in spite of old
John’s “Don’t you be minding him, Sid.”
But Sid told Joe he was a liar, a fat liar,
an old liar, a bloody liar.
Joe sprang into action something
like an untrained elephant trying to dance
a complicated jig. He fell heavily and
struck his head on a projecting stone of
the wide fireplace.
“Serve him right,” said Sid. “That’ll
teach him.”
Evidently Toe was having a good
lesson of it, for he didn’t get up. Nor
did he reply when John asked if he was
hurt at all.
It took some time to realise that Joe
was dead—stone dead. It was terrible,
and old John broke down, and cried.
Sam wasn’t much affected, and went on
shuffling the cards in his enthusiastic way.
First thought was a doctor. But Sid
said a doctor could do nothing. And a
doctor meant police. Sid thought it
“looked bad” even though Joe was
entirely to blame. Sid wasn’t at all
sorry for Joe, but he didn’t want to get
into trouble over the old cow. No one,
Sid said, would believe any story they
could tell.
Better to make Joe disappear. Make
it look as if Joe had gone back home.
Old John was left out of the family
council —largely managed by Mrs. John
and Sid—and Sam didn’t count. One of
the boys hurried to Joe’s hut with the
lantern, and hung it on its accustomed
nail. Sid and another of the boys took
Joe in a barrow to the creek paddock.
That was far safer than an abandoned
shaft. And so that no marks of new soil
and sub-soil might betray, the paddock
was ploughed next day—that was Sid’s
idea, too. A crop of late oats was put in.
All very simple, no one to say or know
anything, beyond that Joe had left at the
usual time. Which was quite strictly true.
How much of this Sergeant Sim had
surmised would be hard to say—probably
quite a deal. No doubt he was well
satisfied in his own mind that whatever
happened to Joe was no fault of the
Wiltons’. Sergeant Sim would not coun-
tenance anything really criminal. But in
this case he reckoned it best to leave
well alone.
What did it matter anyway? Joe had
finished his wanderings at last—Ballarat
to Gympie and back again, and all the
rest. And it was a matter that even the
Minister could not remedy.
So no one else ever discovered where
Joe was —and those that knew tried to
forget.

Bedroom Scene.
“A Frenchman at Abbeville went to bed for
18 years because he was ‘tired and wanted
time to think.’ ”
It was after enduring his first six
months of the “peace” that my Uncle
Ptolemy found his sensitive nature could
stand it no longer and decided that bed
offered the only refuge from the discom-
forts of the world. It would also, my
uncle pointed out, give him the chance
to catch up on some reading.
The wallpaper, which consisted of ob-
solete copies of the electoral roll, kept
him going for a week or so, but we got
tired of moving his bed from wall to wall
and propping it on chairs so he could
read the bits higher up. We finally got
him interested in the Encyclopaedia
Britannica. Although he complained that
the plot was disjointed, he stuck to it
nobly. . , ‘
After a month of hibernation uncle be-
came very independent and got himself
a kerosene stove for making odd cups
of tea. During what the newspapers
euphemistically called “industrial
trouble” his bedroom, offering as it did
the only oasis in a heatless house, be-
came quite a social salon.
My aunt, a house-proud little soul,
was upset by the untidy appearance
which uncle’s bed unavoidably presented
while he was in it, and did her best to
efface him with a thick bedspread when-
ever we had visitors. Uncle benevolently
co-operated by lying as flat as possible
for hours, though this had a notable
effect on a complexion that had always
been on the blotchy side.
Uncle’s genius for self-effacement was
his undoing. It was not until we got a
rather terse letter from the steam laundry
to which we sent his sheets that we missed
him, and by that time it was too late to
do anything about it.
After that uncle worried about things
no longer ; he was quite hard-boiled.

“The Story Thus Far.”
Synopsis of a cheerful prize-winning
serial novel:
Levv Gubriuss, a 74-year-old Lett, by
calling a cocaine pedlar, who boards with
the O’Bronstein family in their one-room
garret next to a blood-and-bone factory
in a Sydney slum suburb, has betrayed
Hilda, the 16-year-old daughter of “Ma”
Spigetti, a 20st. epileptic Italian woman,
whose fisherman husband has sworn to
“get” Shawn, the 18-year-old son of Tim
O’Bronstein, for having sawn the legs off
his cat. Tim, an eccentric hunchback,
who is a “cockatoo” for a big Darlington
two-up school, becomes involved in an
affair with Marianne, the sub-normal
daughter of a. Bush Baptist lay preacher.
When her newly-born baby’s body is
found strangled with a corset string and
sawn in halves Marianne is arrested, but
at her trial is acquitted when her counsel
proves that it would have been a physical
“He'll never make a glass-blower until he
gets cured of them hiccups."
impossibility for her to have successfully
used a saw, as she is crippled in both
arms. Marianne immediately afterwards
becomes deranged and calls down a ter-
rible curse on Tim O’Bronstein.
Lew’s illegitimate son Con, a hypo-
chondriac, is, like Shawn, an s.-p. book-
maker in a small Fay, their clientele
mostly drawn from the inmates of the 27
houses of ill-fame that mostly comprise
their street. The bitter hatred between
the two young men is deepened by the
fact that Con pays out on the prices
quoted by the Sydney “Morning Herald,”
while Shawn pays out on those quoted
by the rival morning sheet.
One day Lew is discovered by Shawn
in the act of clandestinely selling cocaine
to schoolgirls. Angered that he is
taking from them money with which they
could have been buying metho from him,
Shawn smashes a bottl§ on the pavement,
jabs the broken end into Lew’s face and
twists it, gouging his eyes out. The en-
raged schoolgirls fall on Shawn and kick
him to death. At the ensuing wake
Rabbi McGinty solemnly declares that
the curse put upon Tim has been visited
upon his son.
The O’Bronsteins, long poverty-stricken,
fall into desperate straits. With only Tim
and his other five sons, all wharfies, work-
ing, they get in for Mrs. O’Bronstein
to keep house only £49 a week, plus what
they “lift” from the wharves. At one
stage the only things in the house between
the O’Bronsteins and utter starvation are
meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, muscat and
beer.
Con, on hearing of Shawn’s blinding
of his father, has one of the brainstorms
to which he is subject and, lying in
wait one night for Tim, slashes his throat
with an ice pick. Tim lingers for two
months between life and death and is
slowly recovering when his half-brother,
Manny, an escaped leper, arrives at the
house and demands to be hidden. He
says he has just murdered two nurses
and a warder. “Snorks” Mul-
ligan, a blood-and-bone mixer
at the factory next door, over-
hears through an open window
the confession, and blackmails
the O’Bronsteins, Colleen
O’Bronstein, who is the factory
manager’s kept woman, has
Mulligan sacked. Mulligan gets
“Butch,” the half-witted son of
the Spigettis, to “lay” for
Colleen with a meat chopper,
and the next day her terribly
mutilated body is found in the
council’s garbage-tip. When
the police arrive to arrest Mul-
ligan, they find he has been
smothered in a bin of blood-
and-bone, and the escaped leper
Manny and the half-wit are
there indulging in sadistic
orgies on the body.
Mrs. O’Bronstein hears the
news of Colleen’s death just as
the t.-p. collector for the firm
of undertakers who buried
Shawn are threatening to put
her in a debtors’ prison if she
doesn’t pay up. Her mind becomes
unhinged and she murders the col-
lector. As she stands 'at the garret
door with the bloody bill-hook still held
in her nerveless hand “Ma” Spigetti
comes to tell her that Mick, her eldest
son, has fallen down a hatchway and
broken his two arms, two legs, eight ribs
and his skull, and that Con is on his way
to the hospital with a knuckle-duster and
a piece of lead piping to “finish him off.”
Now read on! Today’s instalment
gives a beautiful description of a morgue.

Population
North and north-west of our conti-
nent there are a thousand million people
whose numbers are increasing far more
rapidly than our own. The Dutch East
Indies alone have 70 millions, French
Indo-China a further 25 millions, and
the Philippines nearly 15 millions. We
have not millions. And even this total
exaggerates the true position, as nearly
half ‘the number lives within the precincts
of five capital cities.
Actually little has been done to provide
for the extension of our holdings during
the past hundred years or so. The only
pioneering movements were made by our
early settlers in search of gold and
account for the few internal settlements
which ultimately became towns and
cities, such as Bathurst, Orange, Cobar,
Broken Hill, Young, Wyalong, Ballarat,
Bendigo, Kalgoorlie and Mt. Isa. In
many cases mining has been replaced by
agricultural or pastoral interests, and
many years ago railway systems were
established to link up various outposts.
But that, is practically all that Gov-
ernment has ever done towards filling the
empty spaces.
Population has actually decreased in a
great number of places since the mining
days. Young, then known as Lambing
Flat, once had between 50,000 and 60,000
people; today there are fewer than 5000.
Sofala now has a mere 100 homes;
at one time it had nearly 30,000 in-
habitants. Cobar is but a shadow
of its former greatness.
To entice immigrants to come to Aus-
tralia is only tinkering with the job of
populating our continent. Most new
arrivals simply settle in the already con-
gested areas, adding to the existing con-
fusion. Wider vision is necessary. Ex-
perts should be engaged to plan new
industries in the interior, arrange for
water supply and other necessities, build
townships and establish communications.
This will cost millions of pounds, but
it would be money better spent than on
unifying railway gauges, or, as has re-
cently been suggested, on building a
scenic drive around the foreshores of
Sydney Harbor.— Cet (N.S.W.).
Address Wanted
If any Bulletin reader knows Santa
Claus’s present address, please let me
know. I am a coal-strike victim, and I
need his help. This par. is being written
by the light of a tuppence-ha’penny
candle, equivalent to the old farthing dip
—a flickering trial to my dwindling eye-
sight. Since the middle of last year it
js all I can use.
Prior to that, I had been content
with kerosene lamps for household and
reading purposes, but since July, 1946, I
have found it impossible to buy a lamp-
glass. “They aren’t making them any
more,” I learn from my grocer—“the
manufacturers have had to let their
furnaces go cold during coal strikes, and
then have to tear them down and practi-
cally rebuild them to start operations
again. It’s too costly for repetition, so
until the Federal Government will
guarantee there will be no more coal
strikes, they are not going to make them.”
I don’t blame the glass manufacturers,
but would be profoundly grateful for a
solitary lamp-glass. I wonder how many
others are awaiting impending blindness
and how many coalminers are using
candles in their homes? —Wotcher
(Q.).
An Australian-Jewish Viewpoint
With your denunciation of terrorism
in Palestine (B. 8/1/’47) I have no
quarrel; and I share your contempt for
those Palestinian and American Zionists
who indulge in anti-British propaganda
which, let me add, is hurting not the
good name of England but the good
name of Jewry.
I cannot see how the trends of political
Zionism affect Australia’s migration
policy. Refugees who seek to enter Aus-
tralia obviously have no interest in the
Jewish State; they want to come here
because their relatives are here; and
their relatives came here in pre-war
years in preference to settling in Palestine,
To saddle these people with responsibility
or sympathy for the Palestine outrages
is illogical; and to suggest that Aus-
tralian Jews are “being swamped” is to
attach to a noisy minority of local
Zionists an influence which until now
has existed only in their own imagina-
tion.
X agree entirely with your argument
that all migrants should measure up to a
certain standard of intelligence, health
and character, and that first priority of
shipping belongs to the families of ex-
servicemen. In my experience, however,
the average Jewish refugee measures up
to the required personal standard, and I
cannot see how migration via China
affects accommodation on ships from
England. *
Many people disapproved of Mr.
Forde’s methods as Minister for the
Army, but nobody suggested that the
A.I.F. should be disbanded in conse-
quence. By all means let us insist that
Mr. Calwell stop balancing on two
stools, but for heaven’s sake don’t let
us suggest that 10,000 men, women and
children are a sinister and all-menacing
army. Yes, some of these people will
open frock shops; and some will buy
blocks of flats ; and some will offend
your susceptibilities and mine with their
foreign ways and accent. But some of
them will be capable of producing a
Monash, a Reading, a Baruch or an
Isaac Isaacs. On the average, they’ll be
neither better nor worse than any block
of migrants we are likely to receive.—
Bijou (W.A.).
Hospitals for the Insane
The administration of Victoria’s con-
gested and increasing mental institutions
sadly needs improvement, but a recent
Melbourne “Herald” campaign against
them won’t help to solve the problem.
That paper’s reporter focused attention
on Kew, the vast asylum within a couple
of miles of Melbourne. It was repre-
sented as something resembling the Bed-
lam Dickens depicted.
A thing that really needs correction is
the giving of working patients the same
diet as invalid patients so that they
haven’t the stamina to do work in the
fields and elsewhere. But the suggestion
of slavery and sweating is ridiculous. In-
mates want to work from sheer bore-
dom. It would be absurd to pay them
more than the scheduled ten shillings a
month.
Some criticism is warranted. Every
patient, in point of fact, should
have an individual attendant, but there
are upwards of 1500 unfortunate crea-
tures in Kew alone, and no Government
would contemplate for a moment supply-
ing a staff equal in numbers to the in-
mates. One attendant has to manage 40
patients, so what can he do?
The worst suggestion of the “Herald”
was that Kew should be demolished and
a model modern asylum built elsewhere,
ft took eighty years to build Kew up,
and mental cases couldn’t get a better
environment. The huge block of build-
ings is set in fields which are magnifi-
cently farmed and cultivated; but the
fact that it is in the middle of a fashion-
able residential area is the real bugbear,
which was never mentioned. The Kew
council wants the land for subdivision,
and this is nine-tenths the cause of the
agitation against the asylum, which only
needs a little money spent on it to be
made thoroughly efficient. Pawang
(Vic.).
“A Confidential Loan”
I have had one—“had” is right.
Amount advanced, £5; interest, £1;
principal and interest, to be repaid in
24 weekly instalments of ss.
If I retained the £5 during the whole
period the rate would be 20 per cent,
per annum, but as the average amount I
owe during the currency of the loan is
only £2 10s., the rate is really 40 per cent.
I suppose it’s legal and all that, and
I’ve got only myself to blame for not
grasping the fact that I’m only getting
the use of the cash for half of the time
and lending it to, the lender for the other
half.
If my arithmetic is wrong perhaps some
expert in economics will correct me. If
my figuring is right it proves that I am
one of the “mugs,” and explains why so
many people are thriving on “confi-
dential” loans.— Mug (S.A.).
Feeding Sydney
Catering for the family meals continues
to be difficult for the Sydney housewife.
Apart from shortages through strikes, she
has to contend with rations, coupons,
queues, non-delivery, short supplies,
quotas and the most annoying “sold out”
notices.
The troubles of the individual house-
holder are a reflex of conditions which
apply to wholesale catering for the
city’s requirements. We overlook the
fact that shortages occur only in goods
that are perishable, such as meat, milk
and vegetables—for which reserves can-
not be held. The market problem is very
big indeed, To feed nearly a million and
a quarter people with say a quarter-pound
of meat each day requires over 300,0001 b.
of meat. Allowance of half a pint of
milk to each person per day necessitates
the delivery of 75,000 gallons. It is not
possible to tally the huge quantities of
vegetables controlled by seasonal grow-
ing.
A vast prearrangement is necessary to
maintain regular daily requirements, for
which food has to travel great distances.
Milk, butter and cream come from the
dairying districts 100 miles away—and yet
must remain fresh for use. At the present
coupon rate of 6oz. per week, about
70,0001 b. of butter is used each day.
For meat requirements some 200-head
of cattle and about 2000 sheep or lambs
“I believe a man should make his business his hobby.”
have to be slaughtered daily—and in
some cases these are on their way to the
abattoirs for nearly a week beforehand.
The trek of these animals involves
a great amount of labor and cost for
freight, agistment, yarding, selling,
butchering and distribution to all
localities.
The problem of feeding Sydney is likely
to get more difficult as the population
goes on increasing, and efforts should be
made to decentralise our industries. It is
obvious that cost of living must be
cheaper where the goods are produced,
where transport is no problem and where
the supply is always sufficient. — Chas-
turn (N.S.W.).
East and West
Fusion of the two cultures would result
in more material advantages for the
Eastern people, also enlightenment in
knowledge of science and a fairer deal
for certain sections, particularly for the
women. But we ourselves have yet to
learn the secret of using our material
advantages and knowledge in such a way
that life is ampler for their possession.
Western art is a science of representa-
tion of form. Eastern art excels in color,
stresses rhythm and strives to depict the
essential spirit of things invisible to our
senses. Where we paint in details of
surroundings, the Eastern artist dispenses
with them altogether in order to give a
sense of grandeur or a hint of thfe infinity
of life.
In architecture the Eastern peoples
work from the landscape itself and fit the
building into its surroundings, but
Western peoples plan the building first
even if it means altering the landscape
to suit.
Ideas depicted in Eastern prints cannot
be understood without a complete study
of their literature and life.
Our art is not brought into our ordi-
nary life in the .same way. Our archi-
tecture is not diffused into the landscape
and art is not associated with things in
common use.
We are concerned with the glorification
of man, his achievements, his desires and
his sufferings, but the Eastern artist never
loses sight of man’s place in the scheme of
things. He reaches out to ideas of uni-
versal life and hints of the infinite in the
presence of unseen powers.— Septimus
Warwick (Q.).
German Internees
Here in a Victorian internment camp,
after over seven years of close con-
finement, German civilian internees are
still being held behind barbed wire. This
fact discounts statements that the last of
the Italian and German internees have
been repatriated on the Orontes.
Many preparations were made at this
camp for our transfer home on that boat,
and internees temporarily released had
been ordered to report back in view of
their impending repatriation. These in-
structions were cancelled, and about
the same time the camp commandant
informed us that we had better
unpack, as there would be no repatria-
tion of civilian internees as yet. This,
after we had been led to believe that at
long last our imprisonment would end
and after our relatives had been informed
over German wireless stations that
their sons, brothers, fathers held in Aus-
tralia would be leaving for home by the
end of this month.
The mental anguish caused our people
and ourselves by this added suspense and
prolonged separation it is beyond my
power to put into fitting words.
This is not a complaint, but a cry for
mercy. We, a group of about 100 men
who have but the one wish to be reunited
with our kinfolk in Germany, are still
confined in an internment camp under
strict military discipline and supervision.
We have been kept in constant suspense
ever since the Anglo-German exchange
agreement covering qivilian internees was
signed in 1944. What is the meaning of
high-sounding words such as the four
freedoms if we are denied that most
fundamental of all freedoms we long for
most?
After all, we are human beings and
not just so much dirt, even if we do
belong to a breed that is not particularly
liked at present. Is it not enough that a
world has collapsed around us, that our
homes have been destroyed and our
families scattered without adding to this
misery by the mental torture that we and
our folks are made to suffer? Will not
the Australian conscience revolt at the
thought that right in their own country
men are being driven to despair?
When the delegate of the International
Red Cross bade us farewell before re-
turning to Geneva, the last man officially
to represent our interests in this
country laid down his office.— Hans
Krumpeter (Vic.).
Blackmarket
Blackmarkets , have the same vices
whether they are the outcome of private-
er “nationaC-profiteering motives. They
may be run by individuals who
batten on the difference between demand
and supply, or they may be “imple-
mented” by politicians who work under
Parliamentary authority to raise funds
for social services. In both cases neces-
sary commodities in short supply are
raised in price and a rake-off is secured.
Whether the overcharge is used to buy
champagne for a private blacketeer or to
raise the salaries and multiply the perks
of legislators does not matter to the
victim, neither does it affect the morality
of the marketing.
Taxation, when imposed for any reason
other than the welfare of the com-
munity as a whole, when it is spent un-
justly, unwisely, or carelessly, is simply a
form of blackmarket disguised in red
tape.— Stung (S.A.)
Penalties being imposed for black-
marketing offences are far too light to
have any effect. Not only is there black-
marketing in the sale of goods in short
supply, but there is blackmarketing in
the labor market, too, and this causes as
much trouble as any other form.
Fines are useless. The law should pro-
vide for a term of imprisonment with
hard labor. —W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
Bureaucracy in Excelsis
Melbourne citizens have had a classic
example of the working of bureaucracy.
An American ship brought a cargo of
44-gallon petrol drums, to facilitate the
storage of which several thousand super
feet of timber was carried. Builders esti-
mated that there was sufficient timber to
provide weatherboards and uprights for
20 houses, but despite protests from
builders and housing organisations, some
of whom offered to pay duty, Customs
officials refused to allow the timber to
be left here. The plea was that it was
soiled, and must therefore be back-loaded
and taken away with the vessel. — Plain
Australian (Vic.).


Wasted River
Although in the Murray we have one
of the finest waterways in the world, now
navigable all the year round for at least
1000 miles, and giving place only to the
Nile and th(e Mississippi-Missouri for
permanently navigable length, its waters
are idle so far as water transport is con-
cerned. We have discarded the cheapest
form of transport, river transport, for the
most expensive. Government-owned rail-
ways.
It has been said that modern methods
demand quick movement and that the
river is too slow, but in that case it is
strange that water transport is still
favored in other parts of the world.
Greater use of the Murray would not
only mean cheaper transport, but its re-
vival would encourage more inland
settlement. The U.S. has 11,000 miles of
navigable rivers and canals, and uses
them. On England’s 4000 miles of canals
there are employed 5000 men on tug-
boats and barges, which carry over
50,000,000 tons a year.
There are two sound ways for de-
veloping our inland, both of which aim
at cheaper transport, the key to the
position. One is to reduce motor-trans-
port costs by reducing indirect taxation
and the petrol tax —this would not affect
the aggregate, as the traffic growth
would compensate for it. The second
way is to develop water transport. Since
wool and wheat often lie in sheds for
months, and sometimes years, what’s the
hurry?— Camsa (S.A.).
Kindergarten Headache
There seems to be no limit to the
amount of the public’s time and money
that State Governments are prepared to
squander. Three years ago amidst a
blaze of publicity the Queensland Gov-
ernment started a plan to train kinder-
garten teachers through the State Educa-
tion Department.
Two girls were sent to Melbourne for
initial training, and more to the Queens-
land Training College. The girls were in-
terested and enthusiastic. After gradua-
tion at the end of last year they awaited
their postings to kindergartens. The
Government, however, had overlooked
that aspect; no new kindergartens had
fieen built for, the batch of teachers.
A couple were placed in existing public
kindergartens— two. The other girls now
have to do the normal teaching course
to fill ordinary teaching positions. They
are all disillusioned, with three years of
hard study wasted. While private kinder-
gartens are suffering from a shortage of
teachers, the Government will not release
the girls to positions where their training
could be used.—l. D. (Q).
Eighth-Division Subsistence
A Canberra gentleman is reported to
have said that men of the Eighth Division
have no legal claim on the Army for
subsistence for time spent in Jap. prison
camps; but the legal aspect of the case
is unimportant.
The fact is that a division of the A.1.F.,
proud, zealous, healthy, brave men,
through events beyond their control, be-
came prisoners of a barbaric enemy for
3} years. They were forced to work as
coolies and slaves, suffering indignities
and cruelties such as no large body of
whites had ever known before. The con-
ditions under which they lived, and died,
are terrible beyond description, and press
accounts of the atrocities committed upon
them are but a tiny part of the whole
heartbreaking story.
The work these men did for the Japan-
ese was nearly always of military import-
ance and it hurt them like hell to know
that they could be made to help the
enemy in that way. The Japs paid them
nothing, yet gave money to officers who
remained in camp.
Surely when one considers this pay-
ment of yen to commissioned ranks
(although it was only right), it would
be a simple matter for Canberra when
studying reparations to demand that all
p.-0.-w. be paid for their labor at civilised
rates. If we are to teach the Jap demo-
cracy, he must be taught that prisoners
have a right to wages. The Italian, the
German and the Jap held in this coun-
try did not go unpaid. Tfiey had money,
clothing and food, and cost the nation
millions of pounds. Australians in Jap
hands got no amenities, no letters from
home, no Red Cross parcels, no clothing
issues, no rest periods.
Since these men came home they have
had a raw deal. There have been few
signs from Canberra that Australia ever
had an Eighth Division or that the nation
was proud of its courage and fortitude.
Decorations and citations were deserved
in a thousand places. None was given.
An inquiry should have been held into
the disasters of Ambon, Java, Rabaul,
Timor and Malaya, but the Government
has avoided the issue.
Paying the Eighth Division subsistence
now would be no more than just. Repat.
can prove that the p.-0.-w. has had the
most difficulty readjusting himself to
normal living. The money might help to
keep him going until he finds himself. —
Sgt. Damocles (Vic.).
Commonwealth Employment Service
Where is it? An ex-army student went
to the office in Melbourne and asked for
help in the way of a part-time job. A
desk bureaucrat said to him “That’s
against our policy. Full-time employ-
ment is our aim.”
The fact that the student could very
well do with part-time work to help him
along did not enter into the question.
He could do full-time training and so get
subsistence, but completion of the course
would find him with a head full of theory
but no practical experience and in com-
petition with fellows who, being younger,
would get the jobs. He decided to fall
back on part-time training, some of it by
correspondence.
This man was 17 when he joined the
A. and was a returned soldier before
he reached his 20th birthday. To join up
he dropped schooling which was to fit
him for the work he wanted to do tfien
and wants to do now. —J. V. H. (Vic.).
Whyalla and the Ironworkers
J. P. Brazel (B. 25/12/’46) had to ad-
mit some of the concessions granted
to residents of Whyalla by the 8.H.P.,
but failed to acknowledge that they
were gained without union pressure. He
could have added that it is the policy
of his union to make clear the fact to its
members that any conditions gained,
without the usual “glorious,” well-
organised struggle, contain a well-
hidden plot directed at the freedom of
the workers. This Ironworkers’ Associ-
ation, Communist-controlled as it is,
has led many people to believe that it
will be successful in smashing what it
calls the great capitalistic combine, the
B. and thus free Australia from its
grip of steel.
It is well known to the more level-
headed residents of Whyalla, a,great many
of them apod unionists, that their town
is destined to be, in the near future, one
of the greatest industrial centres in the
southern hemisphere, as well as a
workers’ paradise, Australian style.
The town came into nation-wide
prominence a few years ago with the
opening of a shipyard closely followed by
the blowing-in of. a blast furnace. Any-
one who saw the birth of the Australian
steel industry at Newcastle and Port
Kembla has no fears as to the future of
Whyalla. The nucleus of a steel industry
has already been formed, but added to
this is an industry which has never be-
fore been successfully put into operation
in this country. This time it is already
well on the road to success.
Few people in Australia realise the sig-
nificance of shipbuilding and the oppor-
tunities it offers to practically every type
of trade. The almost simple process of
rivetting together steel plates does not
make a ship. What about engines, boilers,
engine-room fittings, deck fittings, rig-
ging and the like? These are all neces-
sary, and if B.H.P. runs true to
form they will all be manufactured on
the spot. What about furniture, sheets,
blankets, cutlery, crockery and kitchen
utensils? A large freighter’s requirements
are comparable with those of a modern,
well-equipped hotel. A successful ship-
building industry would require quanti-
ties large enough to induce suppliers to
manufacture them locally.
The Ironworkers argue that the indus-
try won’t last —“it started with the war and
it will finish with the war.” How wrong
they are! Consider the achievements of
the first five' years’ work—four L.D.V.
naval vessels, two 8000-ton ore carriers,
four 10,000-ton cargo vessels, four
2500-ton cargo vessels. And alt that
was done with inexperienced, green labor.
The future programme is even more ex-
tensive ; it includes the largest cargo
vessel ever built in Australia, a 12,500-ton
ship, to be launched this year. B.H.P.’s
personal shipping requirements total
some 80,000 tons, with a large Gov-
ernment order as well, so there is enough
work to keep tlje present number of em-
ployees well occupied for ten years.
Again the union argues’ that we can’t
compete with the old-established ship-
yards in other countries unless the poor
downtrodden worker, is flogged along on
a starvation wage. Wrong again. It has
already been proven that, with modern
equipment and methods, competent ad-
ministration and skilful, enthusiastic
workers, steel can be produced in this
country as cheap as or cheaper than any-
where else in the world. Why not ships?
The Clyde, home of shipbuilding, has
supplied the key men who are passing
on their knowledge to young Australians
who will create a new Clyde in this
country. The superintendent of the yard,
a Scotsman who, after many years in
Australia, considers himself an Austra-
lian, is determined to make a success
of the project. All this, together with the
good workmanship of the skilled and un-
skilled workers, will produce the finest
and cheapest ships in the world.
Whyalla is not dying. It is a tree just
planted, with its steel furnaces, plate
mills, machine-shops and foundries just
beginning to grow.— Yagoo (S.A.).
The remarks of the secretary of the
Pirie-Whyalla Ironworkers’ Union (B.
23/12/’46) are typical of the attitude of
union officialdom. No mention of the
good work done at Whyalla. It seems
almost that B.H.P. is under an obligation
to find jobs for ironworkers and to pro-
vide them with anything they ask for
without in any way expecting some self-
help from individual members pf the
union—some pride in their work, some
pride in their homes, some pride in them-
selves. Conceit there is in abundance.
It is clear that, consciously or uncon-
sciously, modern unionism is breeding
budding Mussos and Hitlers, who use
coercion as a means of achieving their
purpose. Too many people overlook the
fact that Musso and Hitler both started
as obscure careerists; both embraced
socialism ; both gained power and used
coercion to increase that power; both
then resorted to unscrupulous methods to
“discipline” any who opposed them. Simi-
lar tendencies are very noticeable in Aus-
tralian unionism. What the outcome will
be is difficult to say, but the prospect is
by no means pleasing for the majority of
Australians. — Ebony (W.A.).
Visual Education
The objections raised by “L.J.” (B.
22 1 1 1 ’47) to the use of films in the class-
room are valid only .where the film is of
poor quality and used as an end in itself.
They recall similar objections to the use
of educational broadcasts.
Solid preparation before the “session”
and recapitulation at its conclusion make
the broadcast incidental to, but a high-
light of, the treatment of a topic in the
classroom. Much the same procedure is
followed with films, but films have in
addition the great advantage of visual
appeal. There is no doubt that a film
produced with discretion and imagination
is more effective in gaining and
sustaining the interest of children than is
the average teacher.
Walt Disney set the standard with his
instructional films for the armed forces,
made during the war. Victorian educa-
tionists, in particular Professor G. T.
Browne, know these films well and are
enthusiastic about them. Victorian
teachers are hoping that films employing
a similar technique will be available some-
time soon for use in the classroom, and
results are expected to please even such
a pessimist as “L.J.” —M. O’N. (Vic.).
Bretton Woods
It is quite obvious, even now, that
Bretton Woods will play a very small
part in world affairs.
The main argument used by those who
are opposed to Australia signing is
that under the rules of voting America
“In future you'll find yourself locked out if you're not back by midnight."
holds 32 per cent, of the voting power,
whilst the British Empire (with Australia
and New Zealand included) has only 27
per cent. The old cry goes up, “We will
be dominated by American capitalism.”
The grave danger, in reality, is that we
may be dominated by Russian Com-
munism, although Russia refuses to join
Bretton Woods.
U.N.O. has last say in world affairs,
great or small, the Big Three having
power, through U.N.0., to veto any de-
cisions made by Bretton Woods or any
other body. If Russia decided to sign the
Bretton Woods pact, she would, with the
help of her satellites, hold a very strong
hand. She would possibly gain control
and thereby dictate trade policy to the
rest of the world. But Russia will not
waste time and send a delegate to Bretton
Woods while, through U.N.0., she can
arrive at the same ends.
Australia has nothing to gain by sign-
ing the agreement, unless Bretton Woods
gets' the power to veto U.N.O. decisions
on trade matters. Of course, if that were
Russia would break her neck
to sign up.— Dajarra (N.S.W.).
A National Theatre
“A.D.” (B. 12/1 /’47) wants one because
it is “anomalous” not to have one while
we possess a national gallery and a
national library. He quotes France,
which has several national theatres, as
a bright example to be follo.wed. Would
“A.D.” claim that dramatic art and
appreciation are greater in France than
in Britain, which has no national theatre?
In every country where art, literature
and other means of self-expression have
been nationalised other evils have fol-
lowed. Germany nationalised everything
from the stage to sports. We know what
happened.
Every national theatre inevitably be-
comes a mouthpiece for political propa-
ganda, a home for sinecure-hunters and
a financial white elephant.— Super (S.A.).
Eureka
“Nexa” (B. 15/1/ ’47) will be interested
to know that the Eureka Stockade
incident doesn’t rate very high in the city
of origin. The local Corns, for reasons
mentioned by “Nexa,” have endeavored
to carry the incident beyond its import-
ance. One Sunday every year they
stage a “rally” at the monument origi-
nally erected to mark the spot where the
first “pitched battle” (!) took place on
Australian soil. According to the Corns
it was the birthplace of the Australian
revolution, and they sing the Red Flag
while Lalor turns in his grave.
The Com. “rally” is a dull affair,
poorly attended. A parson, preferably
pink, is always chosen to speak alongside
the worker’s champions in an attempt to
lend tone to the proceedings. Hb is the
only outsider at the “rally.”
Last year the City “Council” toyed with
the idea of banning a preliminary
“March on Eureka,” but realising what a
harmless, insipid show it had been in the
past, took no action. — Passun (Vic.).
X-rays for All
The latest manifestation of “Labor”
regimentation is a proposed scheme for
X-ray of every man, woman and child in
Australia as a precaution against t.b.
One type of human, when he becomes
upset over something, runs to sickness
and, generally speaking,, has no difficulty
whatever in manufacturing the symptoms.
According to the doctors, most people
have had traces of t.b. some time in their
life and most have got over it without
knowing they had had it. If the type
of person who runs to sickness goes to
a doctor or a State institution and X-ray
plates reveal that he has t.b., he is con-
firmed in his sickness. His tendency then
is to become obsessed with his symptoms ;
he feels completely excused from having
to do anything else; and he inclines to
get more sick in order to confirm the
diagnosis. If he had never been told
about it he would probably have re-
covered.
If the Federal Government’s scheme
will benefit anybody* it will be the
doctors. The effect on a large portion
of the public will be much the same
as going to a fortune-teller has on a
hysterical person. — Pawang (Vic.).
