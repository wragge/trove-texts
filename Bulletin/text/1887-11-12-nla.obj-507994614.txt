SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1887.
The Australians for Australia.
Oliver Cromwell, England’s intelligent
despot, was an enthusiastic if rough re-
former, whose example New South Wales
electors would secure marvellous benefit by
following. “For shame! get you gone!
Give place to honester men ; to men who
will more faithfully discharge their trust,”
he said to England’s contemptible Parlia-
ment on the 20th April, 1653, when, with
these words and a file of soldiers, he
dismissed from their positions the trai-
torous crowd who had forfeited their
right to legislative position. They were the
degraded remnant of a bygone and disgrace-
ful era. Some of them had been of service
in time past, but their only remaining re-
commendation was the somewhat dubious
record of former achievements. They were
become an obstacle to national progress ; a
barrier against the achievement of national
greatness. A similar state of things now ob-
tains within New South Wales. An im
potent Assembly plays an empty farce of
legislation in the presence of a disgusted
paople ; with its present personnel it has de
graded beneath the level of public contempt,
and is practically useless, save for the pur
pose of blocking a national instinct of pro-
gression of which it has no knowledge and
with which it has, and can have, no sym-
pathy, Its “leading” members base their
renown -and draw their power from the
blotted and blurred records of a past which
speaks more eloquently of their shame than
to their credit; and the rest found
their repute upon the blind and gener
ally corrupt subserviency with which they
cringe to and fawn upon the “lead-
ing ” members who can only lead back
towards the dark, dismal and disgraceful
past. But all are aliens to a national senti-
ment which is rapidly growing in strength
despite the efforts of the Legislature to
restrain the ideas and thoughts of the people
within the narrow hounds of the rum-sta ; ned,
leg-ironed period of our history. Dr.
Cameron Lees was perfectly right in de-
claring that the taint of convictism was
noticeable in New South Wales : it runs
breast-high in the Assembly, and is rank and
oppressive in the Council. Not that any of
the members of either Chamber have ever
been among tbe chain-gangs, however much
certain of them might have deserved such an
experience, but in their thoughts and expres-
sions they betray the demoralisation wrought
in the “copper-top” and “silver-tail” era.
They review the free and fair present with
minds that belong to the time when the
whole colony was one gigantic gaol. Not
■only in sentiment but in point of character,
■or rather the want of it, are they as a body
unworthy of the electors whom they profess
to represent. Disgraced and fraudulent
insolvents sit with men who have carved
fortunes out of every species of infamous
trade. Politically notable men with morals
borrowed from the buried cities of the
Biblical era, rub shoulders with men whoso
known mental deficiency is the only thing
that is known about them—men with the
gross minds of the bourgeoisie and the im-
becile brains of a decayed aristocracy.
Habitual drunkards whose record is verdi-
grised with the occasional mania of delirium
tremens sit with hopeless lunatics of the
prohibition order. And the broad arrow of
jobbery, of corruption, or of political*
swindles is indelibly stamped on the habits
of nearly all. Many of them only abstain from
robbing at the instigation of others because their
time happens to be fully occupied in planning
and executing robberies of their own.
* * *
Review of the members individually of
either House would prove the foregoing
generalisation to be perfectly just and per-
fectly true. It is not possible for a journalist
to compile a black-list of the infamies and
crimes of some of the members, nor to im-
pute the plain motives of manifold political
actions ; therefore the evidence submitted
must necessarily fall short of the foregoing
averments: but enough can still be shown to
prove the wisdom of directing public atten-
tion to the urgent necessity of abolishing
the present class of legislators and bringing
in a new crowd who will not altogether dis-
grace the country. Foremost in any such
review the idol of the daily Press, Sir
Henry Parkes, must appear. His record as
a private citizen may best be gathered from
the annals of the Insolvent Court ; his
liabilities in his two bankruptcies and the
present assignment prove his utter reckless-
ness in speculations, and his carelessness in
casting upon “friends” the burden of his
losses. He has received nearly £20,C00 as
salary from the State, but his extravagance
has dissipated sums far exceeding that
amount. And his political history is on a
par with such business transactions. It is
admitted even by his admirers that his power
for nearly two decades has been drawn from
the carefully-fanned flame of sectarian
bigotry ; latterly his sway has been the
outcome of a popular delusion made
possible by the blunders and malpractices
of his opponents, Admittedly he
has alternately championed and opposed
every great public movement, and he has
been idolised and denounced in turns by
every daily paper in Sydney. There is no-
thing in his Parliamentary career sufficiently
creditable to atone for the disgrace of his
semi-political business transactions. Next
to him may be counted Mr, “Cocky”
Burns, whose capacity may best be gauged
by his hideous blundering with the finances
of this year. Of any other public fame he
may have we do not now write ; it is weary
work describing nothing. “ Honest ” John
Sutherland merits a pitying allusion. What
he may have been once it is not necessary to
describe ; what he is now need hardly be
stated. Let his age and his growing infir-
mities be an excuse for the fact that Parkes
cannot trust him to answer a question in
the House or receive some deputations in
his own office, although he (Parkes) asks
the public to trust this poor, tottering
creditor of his with Ministerial office. Next on
the list of Ministers is the “ Hon.” Garrett,
whose boast it has been that his avowal of
one day is not to be regarded by him on the
next. The degradation of New South Wales
politics could hardly receive stronger proof
than Milburn Creek Garrett's retention of
office. The public memory Is short, bub it
is not capable of forgetting the public career
of this man. And no greater shame could
be fixed upon Parkes and Garrett than the
shame of their present union. Each has
vehemently and sincerely described the
other in terms impossible except to those
who speak from behind the shield of Parlia-
mentary privilege. In so doing they were
probably right. It may be that each recog-
nised in the other his own political alter ego,
and on such grounds alone can the reason
of their present union be discovered. Francis
Abigail is a worthy member of the Parkesian
crew. Having won some public support
by bis supposed vigour in detecting jobbery
he was lifted to office, and almost imme-
diately opened his official career by perpe-
trating the Bulli job, whereby a proved in-
competent—Mr. Mackenzie, to wit—was
maintained In a position which he had justly
forfeited. Professing large sympathy with
the “ poor man,” Abigail yet allows it to
be stated that he is a director of the usurious
Australian Banking Company, whose treat-
ment of the necessitous we have previously
described. But Abigail may console him-
self with the thought that he will not be the
most contemptible member of the Parkes
crew so long as Messrs. Clarke and Roberts
are his colleagues. The latter pair are well
enough known to pass without lengthy de-
scription. The one a traitor to the political
principles he used to profess ; the other a
lucky rum-seller, whom the C.M.G, ribbon
adorns as appropriately as the blue ribbon
adorns a prize onion. The Hon. Inglis is
happily suited in his present political com-
panions ; to him fluency of speech seems to
have been given for the special purpose of
revealing an astonishing paucity of wisdom.
Of him the best that can be said is that he
has never been accused of perpetrating any
gross job—mild praise indeed for a Minister.
Of B. R. Wise many good things were
prophesied. His advent was to have marked
the dawn of a brighter and purer day in
politics. He, a high-born, nobly-nurtured
English youth, was to have inspired mem-
bers, by the force of his example, to honester
and more honourable efforts. But the fact
has been otherwise. To the foolishness of
youth he has joined, in his public perform-
ances, the covetousness of old age ; instead
of lifting politics above suspicion, he has
caused, by unwise action, suspicions to
darken and deepen : his honourable instincts
seem, since his accession to office, to have
been overborne by a form of disingenuous-
ness which affixes a new stain upon our
public life. There is nothing in point of poli-
tical honour to distinguish him from any one of
his colleagues.
♦ # •
Contemptible from any point of view as
the New South Wales Ministry are, there
are few members of the present Opposition
who can afford to denounce them. G. R.
Hibbs was too recently branded by Accoun
tant Thomson to have recovered his fitness
for membership ; and even if that matter
and the matter of dumpears and his late
wonderful conversion to Protection were
forgotten, he has rendered no public service
for which he could be worthily remembered.
At the best he is but a reckless blunderer.
Mr. J. P. Abbott has wits keen enough, but
he has missed his destiny in coming to
Parliament, where his whole record has
been one of blustering, hesitancy, cowar-
dice and evasion. And so we might go
through the whole list of members right
down to John Haynes, and by so doing
show that the Parkes Ministry, despicable
as it is, is really in its personnel not much
below the average of the whole House. The
monotony of such a work is sufficient rea-
son why it should not be undertaken. Nor
would it be possible to find expressions
capable of describing the microscopic politi-
cal abilities of such men as Tonkin, Black,
Holborow, Ball, and their intellectual
peers. It must ever remain a mystery why
such men were able to delude the electors
who have committed to them the trust of
representation.
* * *
The causes of present political degeneracy
in New South Wales are not necessary to be
now stated. On previous occasions we have
shown that sectarian strife, sedulously
fomented by the Premier himself, and the
absence of any clear leading issues, are chieily
responsible for the existing state of Parlia-
mentary degradation. Our present purpose
is rather to show the necessity of making a
clear sweep of the ragged and politically
dirty crowd who are now endowed
with legis’ative power, in order that men of
true Australian sentiment may have oppor-
tunity of guiding the affairs of this great
continent. In no other colony are the legis-
lators so vile as in the mother colony of
the Australias, but all the Parliaments are
at fault regarding the larger interests of
Australia. Each Parliament seems to glory
in perpetuating mean, narrow, intercolonial
jealousies, and every Australian Minister,
without a single exception, appears to be
more or less devoted to the work of main-
taining this territory as a mere province of
England—a market for her goods, a rubbish-
heap for the refuse of the United Kingdom.
The openly-purchased Imperial gew-gaw of
knighthood is more valued by Australian
“ statesmen ” than tbe highest approval that
can be awarded within one own States : the
“ Well done !” of a Rosebery more regarded
than the applause of all our own citizens.
The statesman who is capable of placing
England second to Australia does not now
exist in these lands : the Minister who can
find any higher pleasure than that of
grovelling to a duke is not yet
visible. “ Australia for the Austra-
lians ” is a motto that should ever
be esteemed, but “ The Australians for
Australia ” is no less important. Under
the prevailing policy this land is the water
shed of a stream of wealth and power which
flows on to the United Kingdom. The life-
blood of the Australias is drawn by the Im-
perial vampire ; the true interests of these
colonies is made to subserve Imperial pur-
poses. Electors must rise to a right sense of
their responsibilities in these matters ; when
they do so the shoddy legislators of New
South Wales, and the narrow-minded Imperia l
lackeys of the other States, will be under
the necessity of confining their attention to
business which concerns themselves alone.
The broad lines of a true and patriotic Aus-
tralian policy are beyond their narrow range.
To as yet unknown Washingtons must be
left the task of guiding our States to their
manifest destiny : of fostering that national
sentiment which, by its growth, shall over-
bear and destroy the narrow and mean
questions which now are subjects for the
profitless wrangling of our parochial poli-
ticians.
The Usurer: the Workman’s Enemy.
“The Chairman (Mr. John Hukley, M.P.) now ad-
dressed the meeting at considerable length, pointing out the
satisfactory position of the Company, and congratulating the
shareholders on the very successful results of their first
year’s operations, and stating his conviction that a great suc-
cess was assured to the Company as it was established, and
filled a publicly-required and long-felt necessity. Whilst to
our shareholders he could safely affirm from the knowledge he
had acquired of the Company's operations, that the future divi-
dends would be such as to somewhat surprise them, at the same
time adhering to what must be considered (from the tem-
porary convenience afforded) only fair and legitimate rates
to borrowers. Referring to the Company as a field for in-
vestment, he was strongly of the opinion that nothing safer
could possibly exist, as the advances were made solely upon
sound and tangible securities with large valuation margins,
a policy which, if strictly adhered to, could not but always
result satisfactorily and profitably to our shareholders.”—
Extract from the report of the Australian Banking. Co.,
Limited.
A periodical called the Australian Building
Societies and Mortgage Companies’ Gazette
last week ventured upon the fearsome task of
defending the action of Hon. Frawncis Habigail,
N.S.W, Minister of Mines, in posing as figure-
head of the “ Australian Banking Company ”—a
pawnshop which grinds the faces of the poor.
And the Gazette does not write at random. Its
information is declared to be at first hand, a repre-
sentative of the paper having obtained the state-
ment of defence from Abigail himself. The first
excuse put forward on behalf of the Minister is
that he “ was induced to identify himself with
the Company on the importunate solicitation cf
several friends who represented to him that its
object was to render assistance to a large class of
Impecunious people who would otherwise be
preyed upon by the 60 per cent, gentry.” As to
this plea we can only say that The Bulletin on
the 22nd October showed the Hon. Abigail that
the “60 per cent, gentry” were tender-hearted
philanthropists compared with the institution
which he has the disgrace of directing—an institu-
tion which was so rapacious and remorseless as to
actually charge a poor workman interest at the
rate of at least 120 per cent, on a loan secured by
bill of sale over his horse and cart. If Abigail
was ignorant of the methods of the Company at
first, he must know all about them now, yet
to-day (Bth November) his name still appears on
the directorate in the “ Back’s ” advertisements.
The apologist Gazette continues: “In his
absence from Sydney, and (we understand) with-
out his consent, he was elected a director; but
has not had leisure to attend more than one or
two meetings of the board.” This is very paltry
and very thin. If he was elected “ without his
consent,” his acceptance of office, shown by his
attendance at board-meetings, is equivalent to
previous consent. He was elected on the 28th
July, and he has been advertised as a director
every day since then, yet his apologist claims for
him that the election was made “ without his
consent ” ! Ye gods, what an excuse 1 And,
moreover, the Gazette will not dare to deny,
even upon the strength of first-hand information,
that Mr, Abigail, during some months past,
has been registered as the holder of 500 shades
in the “ Bank.” He, at any rate, will bene-
fit, or was in a position to benefit by
the extortionate sums wrenched from needy bor-
rowers. The plea that he only attended one or
two board meetings outs both ways. If he, being
a director, so "grossly neglected his duty to the
public regarding this institution which, by ap
pearing as a director, he recommended, his offence
of negligence is not less shameful than participa-
tion in the “bank’s” management would have
been. Every director is responsible to the public
for the bona-fides of the company over which he
presides ; whether, by his neglect, he permits
improper proceedings to result, or whether he is
directly a party to such proceedings is practically
immaterial to inquire : he is morally responsible,
and legally responsible also, in either case. “He
who permits oppression shares the crime.” And
the broad fact that Abigail still permits his name
to bo advertised on the directorate sweeps away
all the sophistries of the Gazette. To plead ig-
norance in the face of our article of the 22nd
October is absolutely absurd. Further we
are told that Mr. Abigail has “already written
to the manager demanding an explanation,
and has jjalso requested the auditors of
the company—who are certified professional
accountants—to reply to “our quoted strictures
on the A. B. Coy’s, system of book-keeping.” But
as Mr. Abigail’s name is still on the directorate
it is only fair to conclude after the lapse of. 17
days that the explanation—which we would very
much desire to peruse—has been supplied and has
been deemed sufficient; regarding the system of
book-keeping followed, as evidenced by the
balance-sheet, our article of last week should
sufficiently show the breadth of criticism to
which that system is liable. As a further excuse,
the Gazette reprovingly urges that it is unfair to
hold a director responsible for the details of
management, and goes on to state that extreme
care is necessary in the selection of a manager.
There might be palliating force in this point, ex-
cept for two reasons: first, because it was not
the details but the principles of management
which The Bulletin reprobated, and second, the
Gazette does not show that extreme care
was taken in the selection of a manager.
Abigail’s apologist should have shown that
the illustrious Mr. Malcolm was selected with
extreme care, and that his whole commercial
career was complete justification for his appoint
ment. These facts, doubtless, could have been
proved, but no effort in that direction was made
by our critic. Lastly, Tits Bulletin is charged
with having condemned Mr* Abigail Unheard.
Whether that is true or not, he seems to hate
become fully reconciled to the situation. There
is heavy responsibility involved in publishing a
groundless charge: we accepted that responsi-
bility with full knowledge of its weight. But If
Mr. Abigail has been unjustly treated, we are
willing to publish his defence to the extent of one
whole page of The Bulletin. We will not play
any larks with his M.S., but will correct all the
spelling, and, if he desires it, touch up the gram-
mar a bit. The space is entirely at his disposal.
We have no grudge against him : true, he owes
The Bulletin £25 for having shown that he once
posed as a Protectionist, but we have forgiven him
that amount. If ho can prove that he is clear
in the matter of the Australian Banking Com-
pany a fount of minion is at his disposal—minion
is the type that would fit him best. But until he
does furnish that proof, and until his cO director,
John Hurley, M.L.A.— John Hurley, who
once introducad into an Australian Parliament an
Anti-usury Bill—we shall regard them both as
men who have degraded, by their connection with
this concern, the positions they hold, and have
betrayed public confidence in their reliability.
The three golden balls should not be permitted to
grow upon the legislative sceptre: a pawnbroker
whi’e in business would not be selected as a
member; no man should be in the seat of a
Minister during the morning who might, by reason
of his position as director of a pop-shop, have to
check 100 per cent, bills of sale over second-hand
sewlngmachines or vegetable-carts in the afternoon.
Public confidence and popularity is apt to depart
from men who direct 100 per cent, loan and
pawnshops and hold shares therein, and for these
reasons it is necessary that Messrs. Francis
Abigail and John Hurley should at once pubilcly
announce any defence they may hai o regarding the
transactions of which we have written.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
What is the “Godly" Press giving
us?
We call the immortal gods to witness that the
S.M. Herald winks a wicked eye at the practice
of cock-fighting on the Sabbath day. Read this
startler
“ Perhaps you have never seen a pit when the birds were
game and the backers confident ?"
We would smile at the naive assumption. But
read on.
“ Such exhibitions are brutal.no doubt—Oh ! rest tran-
quil ; lam not going to defend them; only, you see, if birds
will fight, and if men will back them, why—fowls have
fought and men have betted since the beginning, and will
probably continue fighting and betting to the end."
This from Saturday’s issue, and written by a
flippant wretch who affected to perceive two
butchers—in what, we presume, was cold blood —
carrying birds to the cockpit on a recent Sunday
morning! The descent to hell is easy, but who
of those who knew and groaned over the Herald
of old would credit such a fall from grace 1 We
will never look in the face of Dr. Jefferis again
without distrust of that faraway look in his holy
eyes—>
As though he saw through time and space,
A cock-fight in a distant place.
But that is not all. The old lady had the bearing-
rein off completely on Saturday. Here’s another
slice of her. Talking of Cameron Lees, who
smartly wrote in the Scotsman that we were as
proud of our harbour as if we dug it out our-
selves, we get this in an editorial:—
“ If this had appeared anonymously we would say it was
written by a careless, shallow, ignorant, credulous, muddle-
headed globe-trotter "
This diarrhoea of adjectives is too bad. To heap
up qualificatives in this unscientific way is jejune
and crude, but it is distinctly bald-headed all the
same. It lends a tender human interest to
Herald reading. Even the gentle cow-boy didn't
leap at a bound to his mastery of invective, and
neither the Herald nor the cow-boy can touch us
when we take the lid off. But it’s hopeful—re-
assuringly hopeful. We have some epithets on
file in this office to which our contemporary may
one day be very welcome, if it persevere. But we
give these quotations to lead up to something that
comes after in another part of the same glittering
issue. There was another unhappy wretch flogged
the other day, and mirdbile dictu ! —the Herald
disapproves. The Bulletin has condemned this
relic of convictlsm from the first; bub then we
always had a sneaking weakness for cock-fighting
and lurid epithets. We did so distinctly on the
ground, ami ngst others, that the creatures flogged
were fitter subjects for an asylum or a hospital.
But hear the Herald ! The victim is called a
“ weak, pitiful creature,” not a brutal ruffian this
time. At the thirteenth stroke the doctor ordered
him down. Our excerpt says that “mentally-
diseased persons,” fib subjects for the opinion of
“ medical experts,” are usually the flogger’s vic-
tims ; and that we sometimes
11 torture the miserable victims of mental disorder. But then
they are generally poor and friendless people, so it doesn’t
matter.’
From this the sequence—the patent ingenuity of
leaving such men at the mercy of magistrates,
acting independently of a jury—
Ha“ It is an extraordinary thing, when you come to think of
it, the powers we put into the hands of a couple of men
whom we only value at £BOO a year .... You will
generally find that the accused is expected to make out his
innocence instead of the prosecution being called upon to
prove his guilt."
All this is quite true, bub how did The Herald
find it out 2 Was it by reading The Bulletin 2
This is not the only direction in which this paper
has educated its contemporaries, and though it
flatters us to see that our seed has not been cast
upon barren soil, we cannot bub grieve with the
judicious at the manner in which the Aged has
fallen away. There is enough frivolity, slang-
whanging, and commonsense in last Saturday’s
Issue to make the remains of dead-and gone sub-
scribers turn in their untimely graves.

An Australian Horror.
Judge Windeyer is coming back refreshed and
ready for further labours in the way of thinning
out criminals from the population of New South
Wales, and on his return the case of the convict
Newman, whose life sentence forms a part of the
gay farce of Mount Rennie, will be considered
afresh. Circumstances have at last led the au-
thorities to tacitly, if not openly, confess that this
wretched boy had no share in the alleged outrage
which, thanks to the effusive testimony of a pave-
ment-trotter and a guttersnipe with a smudged
character, added to the brutality of the New
South Wales law and the miserable incompe-
tency of Governor Carington, handed over four
children to the hangman, and, having had no trial
hitherto, Newman is now to be indulged in the
luxury of an informal inquiry into the merits of
his case. The other alleged violators of Mary Jane
Hicks, formerly of Sydney, and now of a New Zea-
land reformatory, had at least some semblance of a
trial—as the word “trial” is understood in New
South Wales; Newman had none. He had no
counsel except such as was assigned him by the
Crown, and assigned counsel have no money to
spend in getting up evidence. He was slow,
stupid, and partially deaf; he had no idea of the
system of subpoenaing witnesses, and he had no
one to look after this matter for him ; and when
he came into Court he looked round with the
helpless aspect of a caged animal In the presence
of deadly danger, , expecting that somehow
or other the witnesses on whom he relied
would spontaneously arrive and be ready
to save him. So ignorant was he of
the nature of his position that he did
not even appeal to his own assigned coun-
sel, but addressed himself piteously to the lawyer
Paid by or on account of some of his more for-
tunate companions. “I want my witnesses,” he
wailed, helplessly; “I want my witnesses, and
they’re not here. Can't you do anything to help
me ?’’ The empty farce of verbally summoning
the witnesses was gone through, but name after
name was called out and no one answered, and
then the prisoner, stunned, bewildered, and utterly
helpless to move on his own behalf, sab
down— -and then stood up to be sentenced to
death. No doubt if he had appealed loudly
enough the police would have been de-
spatched to look up the missing evidence,
and had this been done the daily Press would
have declared that the demands of justice were
fully satisfied. If one or two policemen had been
sent out at the last moment in search of evidence
to destroy their own carefully-prepared case for
the gallows, it would have been the utmost that
could have been done to save a boy’s life from
the hangman. But even this little was left
undone, and the energies of the force were ex-
pended only on the work of smothering the ugly
Past record of Mary Jane Hicks, and bringing
that worse than dubious character in a white-
washed condition to the witness-box, and in try-
lnB to keep Stanley straight for the few weeks
he was wanted, and choking off the tales which
that flying Munchausen related about his ad-
ventures when he was kidnapped and marooned
at Newcastle. Amid all the se adverse circum-
stances Newman went like a dumb, driven victim
to the slaughter. His deafness rendered him
unable to fully hear the evidence brought
against him, and his assigned lawyer’s de-
fence consisted of little more than an
appeal for mercy on the ground that
his client had had no chance and no real trial.
Had the case been one where £lO cr less was in-
volved it would have, no doubt, been adjourned
to admit of the witnesses being found and brought
forward, but human lives go fast in New South
Wales, and cash goes very slow. In the informal
trial which followed, the Cabinet was equally di-
vided, and Lord Carington —the fount of mercy,
and the holder of the Queen’s prerogative—ulti'
mately went with the section which voted for a
savage vengeance unprecedented in the history of
civilisation. Newman escaped the gallows, and
was sent in chains to life-long penal servitude, be-
cause his doomed companions, before stepping
on to the gallows, testified positively to
his Innocence, and what is asked on
his behalf now is a fair enquiry in which he will
not be pitted, virtually single-handed, against the
police, the Crown lawyers, the smirched damsel
of the pavement whose ugly antecedents were
covered up that her evidence might bear the
additional weight which attaches to an unspotted
character, the whitewashed Stanley, who dare
not collect the testimonial subscribed on his be-
half, and whose mysterious arrest for forgery—
with his subsequent discharge—is yet unexplained,
and the whole weight of the daily Press howling
for blood —blood at any price. It is too late to
talk of the miserable lads who were hanged in such
haste lest the country should repent of what had
been done, and it can only be hoped that
the deep damnation of that holocaust may
serve as an example which will save the lives of
others. Australia might borrow something from
the much-ridiculed judicial system of America in
cases like this. The Chicago Anarchists who,
after months spent in appeals, are at last to be
hanged for their acts of a year ago, will be exe-
cuted because, rightly or wrongly, the great bulk
of the sentiment of the country Is decidedly
against them. Had even half that time been
allowed to the Mount Rennie convicts, New South
Wales would have had time to grow ashamed of
the slaughter she was about to commit in defence
of—not female virtue—but the merchantable
article which the harlot vends at every street
corner of a great city.

Protection and War.
A desperate random kind of argument much
affected by modern Freetraders is that war is
caused by Protection. The exact meaning of this
mysterious assertion has never been explained
closely enough to be reached by guesswork, but
the converse of the statement —that war causes
Protection, has riveted itself on the outside edge
of a slab of solid truth. After terrific, wasteful,
and ruinous wars most nations have been forced
to go in for a solid, all-round system of Protection.
But, far from discrediting the policy, as the
“ Freetrade grincer,” the Hon. Wise, desires it to
do, this fact is in reality a magnificent testimony
to the righteousness and benefits of Protection.
For if this policy is the only one capable of sus-
taining a ruin-stricken nation, it is evident
enough that Freetrade, if good at all, is only good
when the nation is in so prosperous a state as to
be able to sustain any policy. But war, be it re-
membered, is not the only thing capable of com-
mercially debasing a nation, and as the devasta-
tion of battle is the cause alleged by the local
Cobdenites which has rendered Protection a ne-
cessity in the States, Germany, and France, so it
may happen that the devastation of other in-
fluences—Freetrade, for instance—may render the
former policy a necessity for New South Wales.
Precedents of this kind are abundant. Canada
was driven to Protection when Freetrade had
driven her industries into the States ; the States
were forced to protect themselves when English
competition had achieved the ruin of Ameri-
can internal trade. Each of the Austra-
lasian colonies is in one of the various
stages of a similar evolution ; and Eng-
land herself, crippled in her home trade,
and retrograding in her every industry, is rapidly
verging towards a similar state of tilings. Her
ruined farmers have been urging a Protective
tariff for years past; her manufacturers are now
seeking for protection against the foreigner in
colonial markets; and her are to-
day raising a vehement voice against the bastard
system of Mill and Cobden which is rapidly
achieving the ruin of their industry. And, in view
of these facts, we are not wildly anxious to deny
the fact that ruin and depression in any nation
are usually followed, and abolished, by a Protec-
tive policy. We give the Calico Jimmies the full
benefit of that truth, but, as a kind of set-off,
would claim their unwilling attention to that
other no less evident fact, that in the history of
any nation it will certainly be found that sooner
or later Freetrade is followed by ruin and depres-
sion. This is so in the history of New South
Wales. The ruin which has compassed some
trades, the depression which has long resided
upon others, and the Great Deficit Bird which
casts its gloomy shadow on a fertile land, are
in very truth the causes which shall shortly in-
duce electors to disperse the Freetrade crowd to
the uttermost ends of the political earth, in order
that other and wiser rulers may grant to the State a
patriotic policy of Protection to native industries.

The Victorian Chinaman.
The Victorian Government has resolved to take a
preliminary step towards dealing with the spotted
leper. Their latest ukase sets forth that no more
naturalisation papers are to be issued to the alien
who eats his chow-chow beneath the shadow of
the Victorian flag, and the legal fraud by which
the soiled dog-eater and kitten-soup man from
afar off is turned into an Australian without even
being washed is thus done away with at once and
for ever. The tripe-coloured dodger will shine no
longer at the polling booth as a “ Blitish citizen,”
and when he comes to Melbourne in order to
“ oatohee him stamp ” for a few short years and
then return to his native flowery land, he will
have to dispense with the disguise in which he
has been wont to cover his yellow soul, and
appear in his own natural character. He has
been tried as a white man, and he has even en-
deavoured at times to persuade himself that he
was one by calling himself Donald Macfherson,
or John Ah He Smith, or he has changed his
Afh Lin into A. Flynn, but Victoria has grown
weary of him in this capacity, and as he is also
making the colony pretty tired in his own natural
aspect he may regard this ukase as a hint that the
time is near when he will have to flee. Perhaps
when he is prohibited equally as a Chinaman, an
Australian, and a Hongkong Englishman, he may
enjoy a short though merry existence as one of
the lower animals by coming in on all fours and
paying his dog-tax, but if he resorts to this expe-
dient it will only serve him for a time. Victoria
w|ll soon get tired of his midnight bark, and it
will probably be found that he is worse as a dog
than he was as a parody on a human being.
Coming, as it does, so soon after the visit of the
blusterous General Ho, the decision of the Victorian
Government ought to serve a useful purpose as a
warning to the opium-chewing Asiatics who have
put their trust in the promises of that petticoated
warrior, and if the other Australian colonies will
promptly follow the example thus set them, hispur-
pose of fitting Australia for the Chinese will prove
somewhat less feasible than ho lately imagined.
The Chinaman’s attempt to turn himself into a
white Australian by a legal fiction is insult added
to injury, and we trust a sense of the extent of
the insult will accelerate his expulsion. Besides,
the transition is too violent to be good for him.
Let him go back to his Middle Kingdom and turn
himself into a monkey, and work slowly up
the Darwinian scale as the white man himself
had to do. Then let him come back to Australia
a million years hence and try again.
The Late Oarl Feilberg.
The outline of events which go to make up the
limited biography of our friend and brother jour-
nalist, Carl Feilberg, editor of the Brisbane
Courier, appeared in these columns several
weeks ago, and have been more or less inaccurately
repeated in other newspapers. Nothing resembling
the real man, such as the inner circle of his friends
knew him, has appeared elsewhere, or is likely to
appear. He was small In stature, and rendered
smaller by a stoop that was almost a hunch. His
little head was covered with close black hair and his
face by a thin moustache and beard. He wore spec-
tacles, being almost blind of one eye and very short-
sighted of the other. This resulted from his once
well-known fracas with an American in Cook-
town, who revenged himself for an exposure oj
his malpractices in Feilberg’s paper by a sudden
attack with a whip-handle struck violently across
the brow and eyes. Feilberg was stunned and
made helpless on the spot, but a few days later,
when he had sufficiently recovered to see a few
yards before him, the plucky little man challenged
his assailant to fight him over a handkerchief 1
The American left Cooktown ruined, and is since
dead. Feilberg was an interesting example of a
genuine cure of phthisis. He had a large cavity in
one lung when he landed in Australia, and his several
years' stay in the Barcoo as storekeeper on a
station left him with no further respiratory trouble
than a short wind and incidental phlegm spitting.
He was a Dane by breedingand birth, and never for-
got or forgave the Prussian invasion. His hatred of
Germany amounted to an idee fixe, and he made
every paper he wrote in a vehicle for denunciation
of Bismarck and the Prussians. His contempt
of the Irish (by whom in Queensland he was
known as “that damned Feilberg”), which also
arose from his early acquaintance with individuals
of the nation, was of a similar character. He
believed them to be utterly incapable of self-
government ; but it says something for his love of
the light that when, some two years ago, he was
brought into contact with one on whose observa-
tion he thought he could rely, and who emphati-
cally denounced the iniquities of the Lsnd laws
in Ireland, he allowed his paper to be led round
and admit this. His visws on the Land question
in Queensland were based on the settlement of
peasant proprietors by land-grants. He wrote every
article against Dutton’s Land Act himself, and it is
not too much to say that he ruined any reputation
the man or the measure bad enjoyed. He was a
moderate Protectionist after his return from Vic-
toria, and was slowly modifying the Courier’s
Freetrade platform when he fell under the in-
fluence of an American alleged disciple of Henry
George, and the platform was restored, The
circle of his friends was a very small one, and
this, it is to be added, was his wish. His life was
spent In his home and at his office. On Sunday
mornings and afternoons those who shared his in-
tellectual life were wont to sit in his broad
verandah, discussing things more or less ve-
hemently, while the whole small circle might be
seen at his fortnightly Sunday-evening “At
homes.” His religious views were, in a quite un-
dogmatical sense, agnostic. He felt that the
Christian miracles and dogmas were discredited,
and the force of its ideas mostly played out, and
he was hostile to the parsons in consequence, as
more or less spiritual quacks. He was a president
of a secular vigilance lodge in the crisis of the
educational question But he had no belief in
any of the modern creeds, and held
that the look-out into the future was a
sad one. His opinions in all things were
most decided, and enunciated with an amus-
ing certainty, but he could not be unaffected by
any new or better knowledge that was brought
before him, and this would presently appear in
modifications and even occasional conversions.
He was utterly simple and unaffected, and the
kindliest of the kindly- He was loved in the
office for his obstinate loyalty in defence of any-
one attacked or in a scrape. His ceaseless little
charities were all done in the dark, and had the
extra merit of coming from a purse that was
never too full. As a journalist, he was neither of
the old school nor of the new, but represented
here, as in his spiritual beliefs, a period of tran-
sition. He conducted hla paper after the played-
out model of the London Times, and the Brisbane
Courier, like the Melbourne Argus and the
Sydney Herald, was a shining example, from
the reader’s point of view, of a maximum of
trouble required to get a minimum of news.
Feilberg had not the gift of personal attraction—
nay, rather the reverse—to strangers and acquain-
tances. But those few who got to know him
well found also that they had got to love him.
He passed quietly away in his sleep, alone, no one
suspecting the end was so close, and the world is
the poorer for his going.

We were prostrated with grief on learning that
Spurgeon had seceded from the Baptist Union
because its younger members are beginning to
lose faith in the doctrine of everlasting torment.
The news came upon us like a hundred of bricks,
knocking the Irish question, the New Hebrides
difficulty, and the Imperial Institute clean out of
our bewildered brain, A certain sense of impend-
ing evil went all down our back. We have suf-
fered from want of appetite, dimness of sight,
and general debility ever since. Out here in Aus-
tralia, forsooth, one can afford to take most of the
European troubles in a philosophical spirit, but it
is painful to hear of anything serious happening
to the dear old mother land. And our idea is
that if Spurgeon has really given up the
Baptist Union on account of his reverence for that
fine old institution, hell, the fate of England is
sealed. The Constitution must rapidly go bung.

A London cablegram in last week’s Australian
daily papers says that Lord Selbornb avers he
cannot support Gladsione in his Irish policy, as
it “ practically means spoliation and anarchy.”
“ Spoliation ” —a good word. The dictionary
tells us that the word “ spoliation ” means,
amongst other things, an act of plundering, rob
bery, deprivation. Now Lord Selborne, the
pensioner, has been “plundering” the Britisl
Exchequer for the past 14 years, of five thousanc
pounds sterling per annum as a reward for having
served under this same Gladstone as Lord Chan
cellor of England for eighteen months ! Seventy
thousand pounds sterling he has thus "dtprived’
the British Treasury of. He was an English bar
rister before his “ennoblement,” and known as
Roundell Palmer, We like to hear a greedy
lawyer-pensioner talk of “ spoliation.”

Aquilla Sharply, a sober and moral member ol
the Y.M.C.A., bought a little plot of land in the
genteel suburb of Toorak (Melb.), and built thereon
a pleasant villa residence. Aquilla smoked not,
neither did he drink—gambling of any sort he
held an abomination in the sight of the Loard.
But having read somewhere in the Blessed Book
that marriage is a holy state, this steady-going
young Christian wooed and won a maiden who
would soon have become Mrs. S,, If Providence
hadn’t otherwise arranged. Aquilla’s method of
preparing a home for his future bride was sim-
plicity itself. At nightfall, after reading the
usual chapter, he would slip his Bible in his
pocket and prospect the neighbourhood He
found that the Loard provided timber, window -
sashes, doors, venetian-blinds, galvanised iron,
mantelpieces, grates, and other necessaries for
whomsoever chose to collect them from unoccupied
and unguarded premises. In answer to fervent
and prolonged prayer, Aquilla even discovered a
horse and buggy by the roadside, also a bicycle
and a wheelbarrow. The bicycle he rode to
Y.M.C.A. meetings, and the wheelbarrow was a
source of much comfort when he went col-
lecting the herbs and flowers that grew
in other men’s gardens. The horse and
buggy were special blessings from on
high, enabling Aquilla to remove furniture on
easy terms. Now It was a looking-glass ho
brought home—then a sofa and an easy-ehair—
anon the bridal bedstead. But when domestic
arrangements were completed, and all was in
readiness for his love, lo ! the Loard put it into
Aquilla’s heart to remove a darned incriminating
pair of carriage-wheels from a stranger who
sojourned near. They were identifled, investiga-
tions were made, and one by one people came
forward to claim bits of the villa residence. By
this time the young man was wearing the mar-
tyr's crown in quod, charged with larcenies. It
was a clear case of religious kleptomania (on his
counsel’s own showing) and yet they gave Aquilla
four years’ hard. And thus “ a most rigid, moral
and exemplary life ” Is blasted in its early spring-
time, while thousands of drinking, smoking,
gambling young villains who never go to church
are furnishing on the hire system and flourishing
in sin.

J. L. Purves, the Melbourne barrister, is very
much disturbed by the presence of French con
victs in the New Hebrides. They can put no
briefs in his way, and they offend his Imperia
instincts altogether. To a man like Purves, who
knows what “ bounce” will accomplish and bully
ing bring about, it is incredible that France is
allowed to stick to the New Hebrides in spite of
earnest protests from the Australian Natives
Association, He can’t think what England is
doing—ignoring Graham Berry, slighting Ser
vice, and even closing its ears to the roar 01
Alfred Deakin. And in his dilemma Purves
has lifted up his voice and prayed for “ one briei
day of that great and glorious Jew who led the
fortunes of England some little time ago.” “ I
they still had (this is Purves' professional opinion
without a fee) the man who took Egypt, who
seized Cyprus, &0., &c.—if England had that man
for but one hour—she would have the New
Hebrides ; and if there was not a man of thal
stamp in England, then let them get one in Aus-
tralia by all means.’’ Be-e-autiful 1 But we can-
not enjoy another five minutes of Beaconsfibld
because he is dead, and Sir Salmon Wilson lives
in ’is ’ouse. Neither do we think that England
has any more great and glorious Jews on hand.
So there's nothing for it but to look around the
local market for the stamp of man we want.
Purves it is.
4.
The tenth-rate pseudo-Jingolstic “Imperialism,”
which certain snobbish influences have brought
about in the Queensland Defence Force, has had
some pretty comments already, and there are
more to follow. Colonel French, an “ Imperial
Service ” officer who bosses the “ Land Forces,”
has several times come into collision with the
civil authorities owing to his supercilious, over-
bearing ways, but so far the private friendship of
Sir Samuel Griffith has pulled him through.
The Gayundah, the Queensland gunboat lying
idly month by month in the river below Brisbane,
has been turned into nothing more than a floating
club for its “Imperial Service” officers, who
think it is the correct thing to treat all colonials
with the genuine British bounce. Then Lieutenant
Hbsketh was found to have entered upon some
queer pecuniary transactions, including the bor-
rowing of money from his men, and was
dismissed. And now another officer is asked
to refund the Government £lO9 and resign. Both
the Lieutenant and the officer last referred to
of course, talked big about “Imperial Service
rules,” and all that, and Hesketh had the colossal
cheek to deny the jurisdiction of the court that
convicted him. Now, is it not about time “ Im-
perial service ” officers should be made to under-
stand, once for all, that they are simply employes,
like the Civil servants, or anyone el6e, and that, if
they do not behave themselves, they will be sent
packing further ? It has been an open secret for
long in Brisbane that the mismanagement of the
Queensland “ Naval Department” was frightful,
and that the accounts would not bear auditing.’
Instead of attending to the work at the office, the
place was turned into a sort of smoking and
lounging-room for the “ officers ” and their female
sassiety friends. The “Imperial service '
people seem to have an idea that they ought to
be the objects of peculiar consideration. The
gods alone know why! A more useless, badly
painted, figure-headed fet of idling obstructionists
is nowhere to be found in the inhabited globe.
Wherever they have had the chance they have
thrown cold water on all improvement and exten-
sion of the Defence Force as a really national
institution. The British Army is not a first-class
model to begin with and to go on with. These
British officers we are honoured with are for the
most part not first-class members of it. All the
British Army has done these 17 years has been to
timidly imitate the German, and the “ Imperial
officers” who come to Australia are generally
those who had no chance of making a splash at
home. Colonel French is a theoretic soldier who,
so far as we can ascertain, has never seen war,
and the same is true of the Queensland naval
officers. This crowd must be shown that we only
employ them to earn their wages by real work, or,
if they won’t do it and won’t keep civil tongues in
their heads, why they may go to England
again.

A Marylebone (Eng.) magistrate has stated

Signs of the times. The redaction of the

the Governor of South Australia,
The Evening News is preparing to “turn

The Age is afraid that Gladstone will dis-

that’s behind Gladstone.
Haynes, M.P., seems to pride himself on
the fact that he has never been outside N.S.W.
This is a merit he shares in common with the

In a post-guzzling oration the other day
in London Sir Graham Bsrry said that the union

slant-eyed gentlemen starting a large store and
stinking cabbage and leprosy-distributing depot in
Wanganui."
Ninian Melville, M.P., objects to the
N.S.W. Premier “grunting and groaning” in the
House. Melville, as an experienced undertaker,
knows that the symptoms are not genuine, and
that’s what riles him.
A Sydney paper, wishing to compliment

In N.S.W., nowadays, every alleged

“ Parkes and the Queen.” One of the causes of
the great Wolsey’s downfall was his unfortunate

Two hundred and fifty Chinamen have

The report of the evidence given before
the Commission appointed to enquire into the
purchase, for £29,000, by the Parkes Government,
of a piece of land at Circular Quay, Sydney,

Walker, Victorian Commissioner of Cus-
toms, holds that tombstones are luxuries and
liable to import duty. Walker will now probably
propose an excise duty on coffins. We should like
to hear Undertaker Melville, M.P., of the N.S.W.

The N.S. W. Government have picked out
the best-paid officials as those who are to travel

private boxes nearly all the year round 1 ”
“New South Wales may yet pay dearly

Morehead, M.L.A. of Queensland, is a
man of considerable language, and his speech is a
running river of gruesome compliment. He got
to loggerheads recently with the Minister for

actions of his predecessors ”
Here is a staggering fact. Every day the
politicians of N.S.W. waste in dilly-dallying over
the bringing in of “anew Rabbit Bill,” at the
very lowest computation 250,000 rabbits are born.
On the basis of the price to be paid in future for
rabbit-killing—viz , Ijd per head—this means
between £l5OO and £l6OO daily 1
In some of the N.S.W. gao’s the prisoner
who weakly announces himself as a Deist is
“ punished” by being preached at by the minister
of some more fashionable persuasion ; and the
Minister for Justice thinks it would be a clear
“ waste of time and money ” to bother about any
convictions save those duly arrived at in court.
Says the Melbourne Age in a leading
article :—“ Even if our armies are recruited from
the sweepings of the gin-shop and the gaol, they
fought at the Soudan as wall as they ever fought
at Waterloo and the Crimea ; and have they not
turned out heroes like Gordon and generals like
Wolseley.” Hum I wa wonder which of these was
swept out of a gin-shop and which out of a gaol ?
Those who talk bosh about the advantages
Australians derive from a political connection
with England are hereby requested to explain in
what way it is an advantage to be called upon to

mere bargain, what are we to look for in a matter
of rule ?
Under the head of “ Amusements ” in a
Sydney daily journal wa find advertised amongst

John Haynes, M.P. It is most apropos that the
Mudgee man should ha advertised as an “ amuse-

all the holy water blessed in the colony since the
first pair of leg-irons landed won’t wash out the
iniquity.
Fiji boasts of a recent enactment by which
the indulgence of the nigger In “heathen prac
tices” brirgs down on him fine, imprisonment,
and public flogging. This law is not entitled
“ The Bashed Cannibals’ Conversion Act,” but it
ought to be. Or else “ The Skinned Heathen’s
Shortest Road to Heaven.” How would that do ?
Or “ The Ignorant Niggers’ Flogging and Salva-
tion Bill."
A correspondent of a N.Z. paper writes as
follows :
11 Like many young men who take an interest in politics, I
should like to know how it is Freetraders manage to avoid
the following question—Seeing that a first-class quality of
wheat can be purchased in India at 9d. per bushel and
landed in N.Z. at 3d per bushel freight, or Is. per bushel in
all, how do the Freetraders propose to save our wheat-
growers from ultimate ruin 1 I have just arrived from India,
and know the price I have mentioned to be correct."
When England and not Australia is in
question the Argus can admit that the agitation
for a greater share of the rights of existence to the
working classes is a sign of moral elevation, not
degradation. The newspaper in question is show-
ing signs of conversion, which are comforting, if
genuine. Perhaps some day it will acknowledge
that people in general, besides wool growers and
smuggling merchants, have rights even over here.
A little notice in a Sydney paper informs
us that “ Murrlll Creek Station on the Lachlan
has been sold in Melbourne." Now why, oh,
Pulsford, is it that every time a valuable N.S.W.
squatting property goes into the market it is sold
in protected Melbourne, instead of in Sydney, the
flourishing capital of New South Wales, and why
do almost all the wealthy N.S.W. squatters reside
in the benighted colony of tariffs and financial
darkness 1 We would be glad to know.
Parkea, it is easy to see, is really sick of
his State-house scheme, and is “sorry he spoke.”
Any reference to the projected edifice in which he
was wont to take such premature pride riles him
terribly. The proposal now sits right down on bis
manly chest every night, and nothing would
please him better than to see the scheme, as well
as the subject, buried for ever in the black vaults
of eternal oblivion. The State-house, for all
practical purposes, is dead as real Freetraade.
Pardonable curiosity is being exhibited in
the Victorian Parliament over the question of
Chief-Secretary Deakln’s expenses during his re-
cent trip to London. The audit commissioners
I discovered that a sum of £l6OO set down for
“forage" had been absorbed for “travelling ex-
penses,” and there are grounds for believing that
this item indicates the key to the mystery. After
all, more euphemistic names than “ forage ” have
been given to ministerial malversations before to-
day.
The Parkes Relief Fund is not a boom.
When it started it was asserted that £25,000 could
easily be raised in a single week, and yet a whole
month of uproarious begging has only brought in
a mean, miserable £lOOO, halt of which has been
contributed in a dozen large sums contributed by
individuals directly interested. Hence the tears
which fall upon this printed page; hence, also,
the snufiiings and the nose blowings, and the
anguish which is being drowned in the fiery tide
of drink.
Considerable surprise was recently mani-
fested in Melbourne over the fact that while the
London correspondent of the Argus referred to
perpetual pensions as having been bestowed “ on
Court Courtesans and their offspring ” ; the ditto
ditto of the Age quoted with approval an article
in the Standard, in which the local optionists are
held up to opprobrium and derision. It is more
than probable that the double mistake arose
through the man in London putting the letters into
the wrong envelopes.
By confessedly treating the political
offender O’Brien, M.P., as one of “the lowest
criminals,” Balfour is teaching Russia and other
Powers a curious lesson without considering how
soon they may batter the instruction. By-the-bye,
did Howard, the Philanthropist, leave any lineal
descendants ? and it he did, what are they doing
in England just now? It is forgotten that
Kossuth was, as only a political offender, treated
by the British authorities with the most dis-
tinguished consideration.
Shepherd Jeffaris says “ there’s a decided
effort on the part of the ecclesiastics of a leading
church to exorcise direct and continuous influence
in politics, and an equally decided tendency on
the part of a class of politicians to court this in-
fluence as a force to help or retard their own de-
signs.” How innocent the good pastor is ! Doesn’t
he know that while the Romans openly preach
politics from their altars, all other denominations
preach theirs in Orange Lodges ? Every clergy-
man who is an Orangeman is ex officio the chap-
lain of his lodge.
The Celtic Home Rule Club Is the latest
political organisation in Melbourne. Its object is
to bring the influence of the Irish of Australia
and their sympathisers to bear as far as possible
on the question of Irish nationalism and to combat
the sodden Conservatism of the Argus and the
“ respectable ” press in general. At the Argus
office, of course, the new association is regarded
as a league of bomb-throwing assassins and
Fenians, but the names on the committee-list are
a sufficient guarantee that the Club does not
intend to blow up the premises of that heavy old
journal just yet.
Me. Patterson, M.L.A. for Castlemaine
(Vie.), was very severe on Mr. Pearson, Minister
of Education, the other night. Whatever else

Mr. M. H. Davies would probably object to our
saying what these things are, or wish us to with-
draw them. But we cannot help thinking in this
conjunction of a Bathurst politician who when
some educated candidate—this was years ago-
referred in his speech to Matthew Arnold, inter-
rupted him with “D a him I Who’s Mat-

Under the accursed blight of Protection
(sa v oasm) several woollen mils have recently been
founded in Melbourne, and the eat iblishment at
Wiiltamstown has just received the bonus of
£5OOO offered by an asinine Government steep ad
in financial darkness (also sarcasm) for the first
10,000 yards of worsted cloth produced in the
colony. When will any factory in the enlightened
land of New South Wales (the word “enligtttened”
is put in by way of derision) go and do likewise.
The mother colony ought to do something to
show that she is progressing, even if she should be
reduced to offering a Government bonus for the
1 first 10,000 people ruined by a pawnbroking estab-
lishment in which a freetrade]Minister is a share-
holder.
“ John Potts ’’ is not the kind of name
that can more than half-fill the trump of immortal
fame. His initials would crush the life out of a
Washington, and it is probably owing to this fact
that the Anti-Chinese apostle who owns the cog-
nomen has not yet succeeded in evicting the hatred
Celestial from this fair land. Mr. P. has written
a pamphlet about his anti-Chinese trip through
Queensland, but from this production we learn
little except that Mr. P. was several times
hungry and frequently thirsty during his tour.
We grieve mightily thus to write of one who is
working in a good cause, and we grieve further
because, judging from the style of his brochure,
we are inclined to believe that he is not the sorb
of youth who is ever likely to benefit that causa
to any very considerable extent.
The explanation offered in defence of the
granting to Pyrotechnist Pain of the right of ad-
vertising on tne Sydney Government tram-motors
—“ viz , that any other citizen who would bring to-
gether (in the people's Domain) a concourse of
8000 or 10,000 persons would undoubtedly have the
same privilege ’’—was a mere evasion of the ques-
tion, for neither Pain nor anyone else ever guaran-
teed any concourse of the kind. And even if such
guarantee were given the gross wrong done to the
public by demanding from them admission to their
own property would remain intact. In the words
of Edmund Burke, “ men may be sorely touched and
deeply grieved In their own privileges as well as
in their purses. Men may lose little in property
by the act which takes away all their freedom.
When a man is robbed of a trifle on the highway
it is not the twopence lost that constitutes the
capital outrage.”

The Referee
For Beach’s sake it is to be hoped he does
not hold his younger rival Hanlan as oheap as
most of the Australian dailies and the majority of
the general public do. The former seemed quite
surprised last week at Hanlan rowing clean over
George Brett in a short spin. On public form
Beach must win, but Hanlan can scarcely be such
a cripple of his old self as to cause surprise when
he rows over an amateur —though the latter be a
good one. One thing is certain—it will pay Han-
lan to win if he can.

If Beach is as forward in his work as the
dailies make out, he will be as stale as a week old

There was some right-down-to-the-ground
slogging at Foley's on Saturday night. Fitz and
Williams, both powerfully-builo young fellows,
went through 24 rough-and-tumble rounds before
a draw was declared. Fouls innumerable were
passed over by the referee of the evening, who
appeared to tolerate anything but biting and
gouging. Gorman and Meadows had a slashing
six rounds in the opening bout of the £5O middle-
weight competition. Meadows, a scientific boxer,
hurt his right hand in the third round, and, for
the remainder of the contest, fought Gorman with
the left hand only. Meadows dealt severely with
the powerful Gorman, and was declared the
winner. Next Saturday night the competition
will be concluded.

Two remarkably clever descriptions of the
race for Melbourne Cup have become historical.
One was called “ A White Heat,” and was written
by that eccentric genins Herbert Palmer, of the
Melbourne Press and the Salvation Army. The
other was a metrical account of the great contest
written in imitation of the “Falls of Leflore,” by
Marcus Clarke. It was published in 1871, when
Haricot won the Cup.

One of the queerest satires on the ad-
ministration of the law in N.S.W. is found in the
fact that a policeman, one Jones, who drew Dun-
lop in one of Tattersall’s sweeps won £4500 by the
success of that horse in the Melbourne Cup.
Policeman Jones is said to have fainted with ex-
citement at the hotel where he had been awaiting
the result of the race. Sweeps are illegal in
N.S.W., yet everybody knows perfectly well that
“ Tatttrsall ” has this year handled no less than
£90,000, the commission on which, at 10 per cent.,
gives him the handsome little income, so far, of
£9OOO, besides the interest on money In hand,
which would help to pay expenses. " The fact
that people will gamble whatever may be the law
is fully recognised by the Continental nations
whose Governments take care to afford guarantees
for the bona fidcs of all advertised lotteries. In
Australia this result has been partly brought about
by the survival of the fittest lottery, which
seems to distribute its favours with impartiality.
The winner of the £4500 prize in another of
Tattersall’s £lO,OOO sweeps was a carter. How-
ever, it is time the present sweep-law were either
enforced or abrogated. The Victorian authorities
seem to have succeeded in abolishing public racing
sweeps in their territory—and, furthermore,
in diverting much of the sweep-money into the
pockets of the bookmakers. It must be added
that most of the Victorian racing-lotteries were
rank swindles, just as the bulk of the N.S.W.
minor sweeps were rank swindles.
Lady Parkes is ill.
Last week a distinguished ” N.S.W.
politician gave to the Sydney Soup Kitchen and
Night Refuge a donation of five shillings. To the
Parlies testimonial fund he gave nearly a hundred
times that amount.
Mr. Charles Metcalfe, who is known as
having been, among other things, one of the best
amateur half-mile runners that New South Wales
has produced, was last week married at Goulburn
to Miss Rodd, the popular young lady of Sydney
tennis celebrity.
The recent fall in Bank of New Zealand
shares has proved a perfect god-send to several
well-known Sydney and Melbourne speculators,
who, having bought right and left when the stock
was at its very lowest, are now in clover.
Most of the Bathurst (N.S.W.) aristocracy
would seem to have backed the wrong horse for
the Melbourne Cup. Almost every buggy and
carriage which enters the town now has a nice
pile of home-made butter in the boot, which is
sold for 6d. a pound. This enables the Upper
Ten to keep the wolf from the door—and wolves
appear to be rather plentiful out West at present.
Only a score of auditors rolled up to hear
Premier Parkes lecture at the New Masonic Hall,
Sydney, the other night, on Parliamentary
Government. “ The grandest figure in the Aus-
tralian political world ” was frozen out and the
gate-money returned. The fact is that nobody
wants to hear Sir ’Enry on the theory of parlia-
mentary government. ' They know too well what
his practice is.
Mr. “Tommy” Foster, son of Mr. Waiting
Judgeship Foster, has been temporarily appointed
to the vacant N.S.W. Crown Prosecutorship. As
the young gentleman is understood to have in-
herited his respected pa’s intense hatred for gin
and sich, the appointment must be regarded as
satisfactory. The conferment on a lemonade-man
of a N.S.W. Crown Pros Tutor hip must, how-
ever, be regarded as a ruthless and iconoclastic
trampling upon the traditions of the office.

The strange old story of “ Cymbeline,”
which dates from the days when our esteemed
forefathers went about in bathing attire, and
when blue men with spiked clubs dined on un-
ccoked meat under the forest shade, is drawing
good houses at Sydney Criterion. The exigencies
of stage art make it Impossible to adhere strictly
to fact in a drama of this description, and eo
Cymbeline is represented as a monarch in gay
togs, with a palace and a throne and an arched
gateway and an army in elegantly-coloured shirts,
and his daughter wears dainty costumes and
jewellery of barbaric workmanship. It is best to
forget, of com ae, that the British monarch of that
forgotten era had hardly any clothes at all, and
instead of being perched on a throne, had merely
the right to camp on a dry spot while his fol-
lowers sat down in the bitterly cold slush of anti-
quity, and that his troops were painted a sky
colour and caked with mud. Facts of this kind
are better left out. Also some othei' facts in
“Cymbeline ” have been toned down, as they in-
clined, in their original form, to injure the sensi-
bilities or the ladies whose dresses are cut so low
that their tenderest feelings arc exposed to the
air. Shakespeare’s language, at times, was
of the kind that men are flogged for using
in New South Wales, and therefore he re-
fiulres to be edited a lot. The part of Imogen
1011, of course, to Miss Essie Jen} ns, whose beauty,
pathos, and hair all combined to make it one of
her best performances; ar and Plain Bill Holloway,
in brass armour, was better than usual as Leona-
ius, though he was somewhat ponderous, and put
his foot down with a vigour which made the
“mountain pass in Wales” totter and reel. Miss
Jennie Maynard, though blessed only with a
microscopic part, looked as if she would some day
play leading characters. Belarious, as wrestled
with by Mr. Robert Inman, showed a solemn old
nobleman to the best advantage, and Mr. Richard
Stewart and Miss Ni'a Steele, as his two sons,
completed a gallant trio. Our natural benevolence
alone prevents us saying that we cared very little
for Cloten, and that the Romans were a seedy
crowd-every man of them, so we will conceal
our sentiments beneath the gaibof hypocrisy and
make no remarks concerning them. The scenery
was good, if the Romans weren’t, and scenery Is
worth more than Romans any day,
** * *
That skimpy little comedy called “ Written
in Sand," at Sydney Royal, did very little towards
relieving our now chronic biliousness. If we had
chanced to have our family hyaena with us, we
would have cheerfully turned it loose on the stage,
and then we would have laughed in fiendish glee
as we watched it lunch upon the leading features
of the one-act show, and start down the street
with the torn-off head of the darksome villain in
the black suit, held between its teeth. “ Written
in S wad ” is not a very good comedy or a very bad
one it is an irritating medium article, which
is good enough for a man in excel-
lent health, but which harrows the soul
of the pork • fed critic. Following it
however, came that delirious farce, “ Nita’s
First," and the baby was thrown about even more
recklessly than usual, and torn up by the roots,
and cast to the four winds of heaven, and left
about in cabs, police stations, and workhouses.
But it was a fraud of an Infant at the best, for at
critical momenta it took to barking in its cradle,
and we never yet met a baby—unless it were a
dog baby—that had acquired that habit. If a
rat had come on the stage we are inclined to think
the alleged offspring would have got out of its
bassinette and chased it with its tall flourishing
in the air, and thereby imparted a blase and aim-
less aspect to the scenes of turmoil which ensued.
Fortunately, however, the treacherous and flabby
little pachyderm was scared into silence by the
frantic demonstrations of a man who pretended to
bo the dog’s uncle, and the proceedings went on to
the entire satisfaction of the audience. Even our
pork dinner ceased from troubling after a while,
and we felt vainly in our pockets for a flower to
throw at Miss Isabel Morris in token of our undy-
ing admiration. Amid a good company, which
did its bast all round, it is difficult to make dis-
tinctions. Miss Watt-Tanner, Miss Isabel Morris,
and Miss Docy Mainwaring (as a rusty old maid
with a horse countenance) did a lot for the piece,
but, in spite of the smallness of her part, we give
our vote to the last-named lady for the sake of
her modest and unobtrusive gruesomeness. Mr.
Hans Phillips, as the cheeky boy in the turn down
collar, tied fully half the remaining laurels round
his noble brow, and Messrs. Anson and Beck
scrambled for the rest, and got them. “ The Red
Lamp ” is to appear shortly at the Royal.
** * *
“ Held by the Enemy,” that rolling tide
of warlike devilment, still ranks as the best play
before the Sydney public, and the exhauded
scientist, whose head is splitting from his efforts
to calculate the quantity of food necessary to lift
a male adult 10,000 feet finds surcease from
sorrow in watching Mr. Nelson Decker being
Clown up. He blows up better than any other
actor of our acquaintance, and we trust that as he
scuds along the weary paths of existence amid
bombs, crackers, shells and other explosives, he
®ay always find something soft to fall upon, and
may not knock his head against anything as he
goes up.

, The presence of three bones and three

Owing to the spread of refinement and

gospel, the proprietors of the Manly Aquarium an
nounced a glorious shark and-stal light for Sun
day last, as a prelude to the concert. The pro
ceedings were a great success, and the combatant
chewed off each other’s features on the blessed
Sawbath in a way that was satisfactory to all the
ladies and gentlemen present. Next Sunday, it is
rumoured, a Congregational minister in bathing
costume is to fight six large catfish in a tank o 1

That universally popular actor, Mr. H. R,
Harwood, is shortly to be married in Melbourne
to Miss Docy Stewart, a lady who has made her-
self a favourite, not only on account of her own
talents, but because she is the sister of the ador-
able Nellie whose Yum-Yum can never pass
away. Miss Dooy Stewart occupies a leading
place as a pantomime and burlesque artiste, and
is a native of the City of the Scrumptious Har-
bour. The hideous blight of the N.S W, tariff
system has, however, forced her to seek happi-
ness in another land. Protection keeps the pretty
girls in the country, while Freetrade scatters
them abroad over the earth to gladden other
shores, and all it gets in exchange is hump-backed
thieves with one leg shorter than the other.

The cablegram last week
that Jenny Lind is dead reminds
one of Ihs celebrated libel action
brought by her husband, Gold-
schmidt, against Public
Opinion, which, with other
papers, inadvertently copiec
from an American organ, editec
by a lady, a paragraph averring
that he had separated from hh
wife after squandering her
money. That was all, but it was
enough to cram the court-house
with duchesses, marchionesses,
and countesses, many of whom
attested to the unhappy relations
existing between the songstress
and her hubby. But the real
fun didn’t come in until plaintiff
was placed In the witness box.
In reply to the few questions
put to him, he swore : “ In place
of squandering my wife's for-
tune, I trebled it by judicious
speculation ; I never gambled ;
I never drank; I don’t play
billiards; I don't even smoke.”
He almost at once got a verdict
for £7OO, and, to lessen the costs,
the proprietors of the other six
offending newspapers each sent
a cheque for a like amount.
The lot was givento the London
charities.

Melbourne shows had a
good time last week, in accord-
ance with annual custom. Not
quite so good as they might have enjoyed if the
books had left more spare cash in the market, but
pretty lively considering. Theatres at Cup time
fetch ’em anyhow-either as outlets for winnings
or as antidotes to gloom. Generally the latter.
At the Princess’s the fascinating fable of “La
Mascotte” had peculiar attractions for stone-
brokers, and biz. was brisk enough for the Trium-
virate to renew their bill until this Saturday.
“ Modern Wives ” still holds on at the Bijou, and
there is joy in the Opera House over the “Com-
bination,” which draws uncommonly well. “ Fly-
ing Scud,” with Dunlop (or a quadruped faintly
resembling it) specially engaged, has been warmly
appealing to prevailing passions at the Nugget,
and a fair share of the golden harvest is
steadily gathered in by Coghill Brothers and
Silk Stockings. Wild rumours are abroad that
money was refused at the Waxworks on Cup
night, and they say that the figures can prove
this. But a wax image is never to be relied on.
All this while Italian opera is winding Itself down
at the Royal, and finally stops next week. If
“LaGioconda” (first time in Australia) catches
on as expected, it will about see the season
through. Mr, Slmonsen has anticipated this
blessed consummation by arranging a change of
cast for every second night.

“ The School for Scandal,” on a scale of
splendour running quite 60 ounces to the pound,

The Empire Hotel, at the corner of Pitt
and Hunter streets, is one of the new institutions
of Sydney. It is a splendid building, with a com-
modious bar, a fine bill lard-room containing two
of Alcock's best tables, comfortable smoking
rooms, and a labyrinth of lofty, elegantly fur-
nished apartments above. Tnera are sitting-
rooms, bath rooms, on each floor, and a lift
connects the upper storeys with the basement.
The kitchen is placed in modern fashion at the
top of the building. The Empire is already noted
for its excellent table and first-class liquors, and
should speedily become a favourite resort of
visitors from the country and the adjacent
colonies.

polite tableman, “ abdominal cramp.” Small

Judge Owen, who has recently sacrificed
himself for £2000 a year and a seat on the Equity
Bench as Chief Judge in that jurisdiction in
N.S.W., was entertained at what is alleged to
have been quite a toaey feed at Gunsler’s, on
Saturday night. Saturday night is a really gpod
time for a Bar banquet—doesn’t interfere with
business, for a senior barrister can always recover
in one day, while It doesn’t matter whether the
average junior keeps unsober for a fortnight,—
nothing would interfere with his business much.
Of course the affair was livelier than a train-col-
lision. A barrister is to a bot'le of champagne
as a bull-seal is to a young shark, and when the
reason for encircling the fluid is the recognition
of the most popular judicial appointment upon
which the Southern Cross has ever shone, the
ceremony isnecessarily performed with enthusiasm
verging upon ecstacy. Yet, in spite of all these
inducements, we have grounds for stating that
every one of the company was capable of calling
for a cab when the joyous gathering dispersed.

was presently on his legs: “If your Worship

a good defence.” “What is it?” says Abbott;
do you deny the dog was there 2” “ No, may it
please the Court,” deprecatingly replied the
attorney; “far be it from me, sir.” “ Then the dog
was registered, I suppose ?” suggested the beak.
No, your \\ orship,” said Richards, “I'm sorry
it wasn’t, and in the light of subsequent events,
I deeply regret that such was the case." “ Then
the defendant must be fined,” thundered Beak
Abbott. “Oh, no, your worship, you won’t do
that—l submit that your worship, when you've
heard the defence, cant do that." “ Then let’s

Suicide, in common with other necessaries
ot life, is getting cheaper. Miss Taylor, of Mel-
bourne, tried the other day to carve her head off
with a penknife, and the magistrate, after care
fully considering the case, resolved that the ends
of justice would be met if she paid her cab-fare to
the hospital. This is as it should be. Suicide is,
in the strictest sense of the term, a private enter-
prise, and as it is generally undertaken by per-
sons of small capital, it should not be expected to
pay more than fair working expenses. The prac-
tise of imposing heavy fines taxes the unsuccess-
ful suicide most unfairly, and allows the pros-
perous one to go free, and, moreover, it introduces
a discouraging element of uncertainty into the
business, which destroys public confidence in the
corpse. A moderate fixed duty might not be ob-
jectionable, but the present system is little short
of disgraceful. What we would suggest is that all
intending suicides should be examined and stamped
by a proper officer, and any person committing sui-
cide in an unstamped condition might then be dealt
with as an unlicensed entertainment. At present
it is not uncommon to see a lady hauled out of
the water in an insensible state, and
kidnapped to a strange hospital by a
policeman to whom she had never even
been introduced, and the officer who thus inter-
feres with a matter in which he has no concern,
Instead of being reprimanded, is generally deco-
rated with a medal as if he were a prize dog at a
show. Under a proper financial system, however,
a despairing individual who had been sufficiently
stamped should be apologised to and thrown in
again, and any suicide who is annoyed by uniusti-
flable interference should be authorised to swim
ashore and lodge a complaint with the authorities.
Other improvements might be suggested, but
whatever system may be ultimately adopted it is
certain that the present haphazard method must
be speedily done away with, and the suicide, like
the man who is struck by lightning, or the patient
who has apoplexy in the street, must be protected
from the olficiousness of amateurs who, without
possessing the slightest technical knowledge, pre-
sume to interfere with the comfort of respectable
citizens.

la there a man living who has never read
the pretty little Sunday-school story of the youth,
born of poor but honest parents, who left his
home at an early age to seek his fortune in a
strange land, in the hope that he might one day
return loaded down with riches, and gladden the
heart of his poor old mother when she was on her
last legs and had lost all her teeth ? He carried
with him a bible in his breast pocket, and a
Sunday-school ticket tied up in a red nose-wipe,
and after many years he came back in a tail-coat
and a hard hat, and knocked at the old cottage
door and found an Irishman living there who told
him to go to heaven. Then he discovered that the
old woman was in the workhouse, and he straight-
way went and fetched her home in a yellow ker-
ridge and two horses, and she lived to the age of
102 respected by all who knew her. It is a good
old yarn, and it has just come true once more.
Many years ago a Spanish youth came out to Aus-
tralia sucking his crucifix, and started to make
money, and after a long period of toil he went
back rich to his native land and hunted up his
long-lost mother. She didn’t know him, of
course, but she gave him lodgings for the night,
and told him about her absent son, and he told
her that he also had a mother, and that he was
going home with a fortune to gladden her declining
years, and then he gave her a purse filled with
gold, and went to bed thinking how he would sur-
prise her in the morning by falling into her arms
and screaming “ Mother 1” But this climax never
came off. He didn’t fall into her arms in the morn-
ing—in the middle of the night he fell out of bed
with his head split open. The fond relative whom
he had come back across the sea to repay for all her
loving-kindness had gone for him and divided
him up with a meat-axe, and his Australian home
saw him no more. Then she took all his coin and
buried him in the cellar, and went and had a
glorious drunk with the money- and let the secret
out, and was convicted. This is a terrible warn-
ing to Australians who get rich and go home to
their mothers. It is safer to let the old woman
slide.

A serious financial question is just now
agitating the usurious circles of Sydney, and a
money-lender seems likely to lose £2O before the
sky clears again. The pore, smitten creature does
business on a basis of o per cent, (per month),
interest deducted in advance, and things made
agreeable for all parties, and this is the first time
he ever made a bad debt, A country clown with
long legs called on him and wanted to borrow £lOO
on the security of certain deeds, the loan to be
repayable in two years, and when it was explained
to him that the interesht would be £l2O in all he
said it looked rather steep, but he supposed it was
all right. The three-ball man assured him that
monish was tight, and he said he had been tight
himself and knew what it was like, and then he
signed the mortgage and handed over his deeds.
Next the accommodator of the human race ex-
plained that the interest was deducted in advance,
and the customer smiled cheerfully at this, and
considered that it would make things much easier
when the time came for paying up. But his smile
died away when the Jebusite put on an evil grin
and asked him for £2O, and he said he hadn’t 20s.
of loose cash in the world, and the Jew said,
Holy Moses 1 it vas a shwindle, and he would sue
him for the dwenty ; if he shtand such losses his
peeziness would go proke. Then the borrower
asked where in the whole colony was his loan
of £lOO if he had to begin by paying away £2O,
and his jaw dropped when he was reminded that
he had signed an agreement by which the interest
was deducted in advance, and that after deduct-
ing as much ot it as could be deducted from £lOO,
he had still £2O to pay, and was also required to
square up the original advance at the end of two
years. He said he hadn’t had any advance
and that there was a liar in the shop, and
the broker said that when he had paid
the £2O he would have had the ad-
vance all right, and, great Abraham! did
he want to sheat a poor old man? The bor-
rower melted a little at this, and said perhaps it
would be better to give him back the deeds and
let the transaction ce off, as the:e seemed to be a
misunderstanding, and the lender said he would
give them back on receipt of £220. What in
heaven did he want £220 for ? Veil, vhasn't
there £lOO for the loan mit the Interest taken off
in advansh, and then there vash £l2O for the
interesht mitout the loan added to it, and even
then ha would be £2O out, and he would
end his daysh in the workhoush, for he losht the
commission and the shtampsh. Where in sheol
did the commission and the stamps come in ?
Well, washn’t there commission of 2?, per shent

What loin? Living Moses! the loan of £lOO,

country-man, “ either jou give me that £lOO or

will! ’’ “ S’help me, you’ve got the £lOO and you
owesh me £2O for the interesht, and now you
vanish to preak my premises h. Poleeshl Murder!”
and the Hebrew backed into a corner and waved
the ruler in a panic. Then there was a free and easy
struggle all over the office, but before it was half
through a constable came in and grabbed the bor-

rower, and hauled him away to gaol. He got
three months for assault and attempted robbery,
and his land has meanwhile been sold for arrears
of interest, and the “ uncle ” thinks he'll be about
square provided he can recover that £2O when his
victim comes out of prison. Failing that, he
means to “ shue " him for it, and he has despon-
dently written off the commission and the stampsh
as a bad debt. It is the only item on the wrong
side of the profit and loss account, and he looks
at it sadly every day and says he will shertainly

The aged chestnut about the “ lambed-
down ” shearer is on the wing in the Far West.
A giddy old fool recently deposited a £5O-note
with the landlord of a fusel-oil asylum, and it
rained snakes for 12 days and 12 nights. At the
end of that time his relatives came altsr him, and
found him sitting on a lithograph of Her Gracious
Majesty the Queen, and having dragged the pal-
sied old derelict off the sketch, they asked for the
trifle of change. Then they learned with amaze-
ment that their doddering uncle had poured £53
worth of liquor into his face in less than a fort-
night, or about 180 drinks a day, and that there
was a balance owing to the publican. A jury
afterwards taxed the bill down to £l5. From
this story it becomes evident that a great reform
is wanted in the back-blocks. The shearer, no
doubt, must get tight, but the system of getting
tight wants alteration, and when we get into
the 'Ouse we intend introducing a Bill to
provide for this. Under the N.S.W. Shearers’
Cheap Booze Act every bush publican shall be re-
quit ed todeposit with the local magistrate an annual
tender for keeping shearers tight for any period
from one to 14 days, and when a shearer wants to
make a beast of himself he shall be compelled to
apply to the Court, and then a contract shall be
drawn up specifying how long he is to he kept
drunk, how drunk he is to be kept, and all the
rest of the details. The magistrate shall then
take charge of all his assets, out of which he
shall pay the amount specified in the contract,
and during the currency of the agreement the
patient shall be inspected daily by the
police to sea that he is as drunk as he
ought to be. A small commission may be levied
for inspection—say 2J per cent. When the pro-
ceedings are completed the shearer shall be re-
moved to the lookup, and there boarded, at the
rate of Is. per day, until he is sufficiently re-
covered to travel, when he shall be washed and
have his dog fed to the satisfaction of the Bench
and the balance of his money handed over to him,
and the contract under which he got drunk shall
be filed in the office of the Clerk of Petty Sessions.
A minute of the proceedings shall also be sent to
the adjoining districts, in order to prevent him
getting tight more than 30 days in any year
within a radius of 200 miles. This measure, we
are convinced, would supply a long-felt want in
this thirsty land.

The busy season for sunstrokes and the
found-drowned approaches amain, and it behoves
us to lift up our voice in warning to the stout,
elderly gentlemen who hasten to lave in the
rippling flood, leaving the only clothes they have
out with them upon the emerald sward at the
mercy of the centipede, the rude, intrusive bull-
ant, and the predatory larrikin. To be left out in
the hot, murmurous woods, miles from home,
with nothing to protect the complexion from the
rays of a summer sun but a few eucalyptus-twigs
and a turn-down collar, is the most delicate posi-
tion we can conceive for a man of sensitive
temperament and exaggerated obesity. We call
to mind the sad story of a portly little man who
filled the honourable and responsible position of
superintendent to a one-horse chapel in a small
Victorian township. One sultry day in December
he headed a Sunday-school picnic out in the
wild woods, and, being very susceptible to heat,
’ere noonday he was almost baked, and deter-
mined to have a swim in spite of all and
sundry. So, following the river up, far beyond
the hum of revelry, he disrobed and plunged
headlong in the tide. The good man had not been
in soak many minutes when about a r core of
frisky heifers came gambolling along, and started
to sport with his wardrobe. They rushed It all
about the place, and, sorting it out, each selected
a scrap, and diligently butted or chewed, just as
their fancy directed them. With the energy of
despair the superintendent flew up the bank, and
tried to induce the juvenile cows to browse on
more succulent items than his scraps of apparai;
but one bovine, more blithsame than her com-
panions, rushed to his embrace, and her frontal
lobes colliding with his diaphragm, he was bom-
barded down the bank again, and, ’ere he could
recover himself, a brindled heifer was careering
across country with his go to meeting coat
dangling on her short horns, followed by another
with one leg of his linen pants in her first stomach
whilst the other leg flaunted in the breeze. After
chasing other live stock that had taken to sundry
portions of his raiment, for two weary hours, the
worthy superintendent recovered a turn down col-
lar and half a boot. Our portly hero did not return
to tie picnic party ; it hunted for him, but as his
own class of young ladies assisted in the search,
he hid in a hollow tree, and waited till the huge,
purple sun had fallen in the West, Then he
wandered up-stream till he struck a farm. Ic was
painful indeed for a man of his fine feelings to
have to skirmish round the outskirts of a farm-
house in the gloaming, watching for an oppor-
tunity to offer an unsympathetic, boorish rustic,
his kingdom for a chaff-bag ; but stern necessity
urged him on, and late that night the superin-
tendent d jdged home tohisanxious family, attired
in a suit lent him by a long thin settler, who,
hearing of his visitor’s connection with the Sunday-
school, wisely determined to exact security for
the loan —and got it in the shape of the good
man’s gold-padded set of teeth.

It is reported that in King David’s latter
days, when his blood had grown thin and his head

culty by imposing a tax on Syria-cured bacon.

Let the moral hotelkeeper lend his volup-
tuous ear to this tale Away in the mountainous
wilds of Gippsland a little one-horse company was
going about in a one-horse way, playing two-night
seasons at each stopping place, and at last they
arrived with their flour-sack of properties at Dead
Man’s Hollow, or some such place, and put up at
O’Hoolihan s pub. There were six of them—three
hard, dogmatic barnstormers and their wives, the
latter being all described in the bill as “Miss,” in
accordance with the wonted custom, and
O’Hoolihan listened with awe when he heard the
leading man rehearsing in his bedroom and saying
gimme death in preference to disgrace, while his
wife fell with a hard, dry, thumping sound on the
floor as she tried a new attitude for a faint.
Next night O’Hoolihan occupied a front seat, but
as the play went on he began to glare at the
actors, then at tbe bill, then all around him, and
finally in the middle of the last act he jammed his
hat down nearly to his shoulders and left. When
the company came home they found thei»
bedroom doors locked, and when they asked
what sort of game this might be, O’Hooli-
han arose solemnly, and placed a play-
bill on the table. “ That’s why yer doors are
locked,” he said with awful sternness: “Now
either them young wimmen goes into one room
and ye three play-actors into another, or out ye
go. Ye’re smart now, ain’t ye ; ye thought ye’d
pass yerselves off fur dacent married folks, but
there's yer own bill forninst ye to show what ye
are.” The company threatened to heave the
mangled remains of O’Hoolihan over the cliffs,
but the landlord's moral character only grew
stronger under these difficulties. “Oh 1 they're
yer woives, are they,’ he said ironically—“then
I'd have yen know that this is a respectable hotel
and a pious community, thanks be to God, and out
ye go." And out they did go, Hamlet first on his
head. lago and Macbeth on top of him, while
their wives fled of their own accord, and their
tights and other properties came through the
window. And as the company stood in the
muddy street with the drooping skies shedding
tears upon their heads a contemptuous voice in-
side was heard to remark, “ Yer woives, indeed ;
I'd loike to duck the shameless hussies ! ”

The way of the commercial traveller seems
to be hard in these times, judging from the re-

for granted that the parsons of W are, as per usual,
wolves in sheep’s clothing, I feel justified in offering good ad-
vice and consolation, viz., ‘ Day not up for yourself treasures
upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt,’ &c ; also,
‘ Take no heed for te-morrow, saying what shall I eat or
what shall I drink ’ (rum. of course.) Moreover to wit:

thrice blessed are the poor, for the parsons let them rest, but
“go through” the rich man, and cry, “ The Lord gave and
the Lord hath taken it away ; blessed be the name of the
Lord.’ I hope these random readings from the old and new
version will make you look backwards, onwards, upwards, or
anywhere but to me for money. If I ever get hold of the
stuff it will be invested in missionary work, said work to con-
sist of giving bread, beef, and blankets to the starving

word five times a min-
ute, and in the course
■of a speech lasting an
hour uttered the word
,5 ‘ gentlemen” 300 times!
When, some years
ago the late Marcus
Clarke gave a bogus
detailed account of a re-
cently-erected scientific
apparatus in Melbourne
Herald office, by which
the race for the Cup
could be witnessed with-
out leaving the office,
(poor Moxon, the accoun-
tant, was for days be-
.seiged by callers who
wanted to be allowed to
inspect the machine. On
another occasion, Hard-
log (now a water-rate
collector in Melbourne)
wrote another scientific
-skit for the same paper,
under the name of “ Dr.
Gnidrah" (his name re-
versed), and subsequently
received letters from
professors in Germany,
: requesting further infor-
<mation.
The late police-ser-
geant Abraham Fenton,
of Collingwood, Mel-
'bourne, was an enthu-
siastic amateur preacher,
and for 20 years ran a
conventicle of bis own in
’Saokville-street, Colling-
wood. When a drunk or
a “ vag.” came before
- the local beaks it was
always a good line to
promise to ‘ 1 take the
> pledge from Sergeant
'Fenton, yer Worship,
and go to church reg lar
—like to Saokville-street,
yer Worship." The surest
road to promotion for a
Collingwood policeman
was to drink Yan Yean,
and go to the Rev. Fen-
i ton’s bethel. A few
years ago every sergeant
of any length of service
about Melbourne was
made a sub-inspector,
but Fenton was left
severely alone. Chief
Commissioners Standish
and Chomley knew very
well that no large body
of men could stand the
austere and ascetic Abra-
ham.
In reportorial circles the utmost surprise
r is expressed at the readiness with which the edi-
tors of the Sydney dailies allow Bishop Barry to
write begging advertisements in the news columns
of the papers.
Mr. Schey, MR, of NS W., thinks
• there should be some particular Centennial links
at Botany Bay, because “ most of our forefathers
landsd there.” In this delicate matter it is beat
' for each man to speak for himself.
Sir Robert Wisdom, K.0.M.G., is on bis
--way back to Australia, fully restored to health.
By-the-way, Bob Wisdom’s big brother, who is
■ something in the N.S.W. Railway Department, is
a shining light in the Never-touch-its.
The Barcaldine (Q.) publicans have boy-
cotted the local paper forsaking that there were too
many publichouses in the town. They consider that
stopping the editor’s grog is striking the Archi-
medean lever in its most vulnerable part.
Meade, the lately-deceased crier of Mel-
bourne Court, started study years ago with Hodges,
thebarriatar. Poor Meade, however, only developed
into a Court crier, while the keen-witted Hodges
became one of the leaders of the Common La w
Bar.
It is pretty plain that Mr. C. A. Good-
chap, the present N.S.W. Commissioner of Rail-
ways, who has as much Parliamentary influence
as any man in Australia, is to get the chairman-
ship of the N.S.W. Railway Board under the new
regime.
It is the immediate duty of the N.S.W,
Crown Law authorities to take such steps as will
in future prevent “ Crown Prosecutor ” being re-
garded as a mere synonym for delirium tremens.
Habitual drunkenness should not be tolerated
even in the hangman.
The colonel of a Western (N.S.W.) regi-
ment of volunteers—a “Soudan hero”—works at
his trade as a saddler, and is not ashamed of it.
His charger accompanied him to the scene of pos-
sible slaughter and returned with him—the only
horse that did return.
Pcrcival Ball, the Melbourne sculptor,
who has been commissioned to execute a statue of
Wallace for Ballarat Botanic Gardens, is in some-
what of a quandary. He is not quite certain
whether he should represent the Scottish hero in
the act of scratching himself.
“Painted Soldiers ” was the term applied
6ome few years since by Sir Henry Parkes to the
N.S.W. Permanent Force of artillery. We no;e
that the head—the figure-head in this instance—
of the painted soldiers aforesaid has now sub-
scribed £lO to the Parkes tribute.
A Parisian gentleman has had a couple of
card-cases made out of skin cut from the corpse
of the murderer Pranzini. Dr. Brouardel, who
dissected Pranzini, was “ charmed with his
strength and symmetry. The rogue,” he said,
“was built to live a hundred years.”
In a Western (N.S.W.) town there is—in
the humble but useful capacity of maker of a
well-known baking-powder—a nephew of the late
Lord Iddesleigh. And at a back-blocks public
house we met the third son of a wealthy duke, in
the humble but useful capacity of ostler.
Teetotaller Nimmo, the Victorian Minis-
ter of Works, recently christened a dredge the
Jilt
“ME TOO.”
HENRY PARKED: “ALAS I AM A RUINED MAN!”
N.S.W. : “WELL, YOU’VE HAD PLENTY OF MY MONEY."
“ John Nimmo," after himself. There are two
excellent reasons why he should have done so. A
dredge works in the water and stirs up a good
deal of mud —and so does godfather Nimmo.
A further indignity has been heaped upon
the head of poor old Pontius Pilate, They want
to make out that he was born in Scotland, while
his father was Roman governor of Perthshire.
One thing is certain, anyhow—Pontius was
cautious enough to have come from the Far
North.
K. Donovan, owner of Dunlop, the Mel-
bourne Cup winner, keeps an hotel in Elizabeth-
street, Melbourne, where all the R.C. priests
from the country put up. On Sundays Mr.
Donovan wields the conductor's baton in a
suburban church choir. Who says sport and
gospel won’t mix ?
“Dr.” John O’Connell, a well-known
medicine man of the fakir order, aged 85, died in
Sydney last week of “ natural causes ” —to wit.
old age and Dr. Creed’s progress report on quack
doctors. This “ doctor,” however, died poor, a
his “ secretary ” swore he had less than £1 to hi
credit in the bank.
The Rev. J. S. Walters (Unitarian), is
| probably the only Victorian clergyman who dares
! to acknowledge openly that he visits Flemington
course. However, several members of the black-
j cloth brigade were seen on the lawn on Cup-day,
the most prominent being the burly and jolly Mr.
Fellowes, of Toorak.
The lambton (N.S.W.) people the other
night testimonialised citizen Croudace. Alderman
Higgs orated on the occasion, and took occasion to
remark that “ the meeting that night was to do
honour to and recognise the efforts of one, who, so
to speak, took the bull by the horns and made the
wilderness to blossom as the rose."
Mr. Isaacs, the Melbourne barrister, is
one of the coming leaders of the common law Bar.
Only a few years ago he was a clerk in the Pro-
thonotary’s office. While there he read up hard,
and has now more solid law in his head than
some men who have been at the Bar for 30 years.
He is a Hebrew, and was born at Beechworth.
The convict Newman’s case will not be
considered by the N.S.W. Executive Council un-
til Judge Wir deyer returns from his long globe-
trotting expedition. Newman has had to wait for
Judge Windeyer before now—when that amiable
and dignified luminary adjourned the court a
couple of times pour chauffer Vestomac in com-
pany with Governor Oaring ton and a lot of alder-
manic feeders.
Tne shareholders in that famous Queens-
land gold mine, the Day Dawn P.C., have just re-
ceived the money for which their property was
sold in England. There were only nineteen share-
holders, six of whom represented three-quarters
of the interests. Some of the cheques were stag-
gerers ; two got £103,000, while four received the
trifling sums of £51,000, £38,000, £25,000, and
£19,000 respectively.
Patrick Jennings, -John M‘Elhone, and
John Norton are three more or less distinguished
N.S.W. politicians. Well, last week three non-
politicians named Patrick Jennings, John
M’Elhone, and John Norton were fined for
drunkenness at the Sydney Central Police Court.
A new sort of ioke, this—taking the names of the
great in vain. We shall next find some unprln-
clpled drunk giving his name as Alfred Barry or
E. J. H. Knapp.
Says the Narrabri (N.S.W.) Herald: —
“Mr. Gus. Williams, J.P., took his seat on the
Bench for the first time on Saturday, and in the
absence of the members of the Bar was compli-
mented by Sergeant Meagher on behalf of the
police, upon his appointment as a Justice of the
Peace ” The Blnch congratulated by the foorce I
Won’t the six hundred and odd disappointed ap-
plicants for J.P.-ships grind their teeth when they
think of Gus. William's glory I
The most recent globe-trotter guest of
Governor Loch is handicapped with the names
George Edward Stanhope Molyneaux, Lord Per-
Chester. He is 21 years of ago, and heir-apparent
to his father the Earl of Carnarvon, and a lineal
descendant of the polite Earl of Chesterfield. It
was this polite Chesterfield, by the way, who said,
when a young lady slipped in a ball-room and fell
flat with her face to the ceiling, “ Never mind,
my dear, practice makes perfect.”
The Mayor of Venice this year is a de-
scendant of Dante, and bears the same name—
Dante Alighieri. He has, so far, shown no signs
of possessing any poetical abilities. The Mayor
of Sydney traces his descent in a direct line from
the inspired bard who wrote “ Hire up, William
Riley,” and bears the same name—Riley. We
have not heard that he has shown any of the
genius of his immortal ancestor, either. Perhaps
he writes poetry in secret, and is ashamed to have
it known.
When the great divorce case Malpas v.
Malpas was being heard in Melbourne, A. P. Sulli-
van, the N.S W. squatter, denied that he was
justly made a co-respondent. “Now, Mr. Sulli-
van,” said Purves in cross-examination, “ suppose
you had an intrigue with a friend’s wife and were
made co respondent in a divorce suit, what would
you do ? Would you deny your guilt, or betray
the lady?” “Mr. Purves,” replied Sullivan, “I
can’t give you an answer to that question. You
put to me a state of circumstances so impossible
that I am utterly unable to give an answer.”
Old Billy Cummins, who at one time
owned a lot of land about Bathurst (N.S.W.)
and represented East Macquarie in Parliament,
took a contract at per yard to make the road bo-
tween the city and Kelso, and a right good job be
made of it, for it is now, after the lapse of many
years, one of the best in the colony. The Govern-
ment—the contract was very loosely drawn —
wanted to pay per lineal yard, but Billy demurred,
and claimed on the square, and got it. Which re-
calls a story told of an eminent English manufac-
turer, who has a handle to his name. He was
the owner of the whole town near his works, save
one little bit which belonged to a Quaker. The
big man wanted this piece, and agreed with the
owner for it, the price being that amount of sove-
reigns which could be placed upon the ground.
When the calculation was being made the manu-
facturer wanted the sovs. laid flat; the Quaker
wanted them edgeways, to which the big man
wouldn’t assent. “ Then,” said the Quaker, “ the
town belong* to thee and to me "
The Old Wi f e and the New.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He sat beneath the curling vines
That round the gay verandah twined,
Ills forehead seamed with sorrow's lines,
An old man with a weary mind.
His young wife with a rosy face,
And brown arms, tinted by the sun,
Went flitting all about the place—
Master and mistress both in one.
What caused that old man's look of care?
Was she not blithe and fair to see ?
What blacker than her raven hair —
What darker than her eyes might be 1
Were her curved lips not ripe and red,
And white as pearls her flashing teeth ?
Who e’er saw such a handsome head
Pinged round with such a raven wreath ?
Had she no heart whose tendrils he
Could thrill, or one that nothing melts I
,(Such hearts there are), or, could it be,
She had a heart —for someone else I
Who knows ? The old man bent his head ;
The sunlight on his gray hair shone.
His thoughts were with a woman dead
And buried, years an<jl years agone
The good old wife who took her stand
Beside him at the altar-side—
An,d walked with him, hand clasped in hand,
Thyopgh Joy and Sorrow till she died—
Then she wp,s fair as heart’s desire,
hmd gay, and supple-limhed, in sooth,
And in his veins there leaped like fire
The hot red blood of lusty youth.
She stood by him through shine and shac(e,
And, when hard-beaten, at his best.
She took him like a child and laid
His aching head upon her breast.
She helped him make a little home—
Where once were gum-trees gaunt and stark.
And bloodwoods waved green-feathered foam—
Working froirfdawn of day till dark,
Till those tall forest-trees did frame
A vineyard that the gods might bless,
And what was savage once became
A Tadmor in the wilderness.
And how at their first vintage-time
She laughed and sang—you see such shapes)
On vases of the Grecian prime—
And danced a reel upon the grapes.
And ever, as the years went on,
She kept all things with thrifty hand,
Till never shone the sun upon
A fairer homestead in the land.
Then children came—ah me I ah me !
Sad blessings that a mother craves !
That old man from his seat could see
The shadows playing o’er their graves.
And then he closed her eyes at last,
Her gentle, useful, peaceful life
Was over—garnered with the past:
God rest thee gently, Good Old Wife 1
His young wife has a rosy face,
And laughs, with reddest lips apart,
But cannot fill the empty place
Within that old man s lonely heart.
His young wife has a rosy face,
And brown arms, tinted by the sun,
Goes flitting all about the place,
Master and mistress both in one.
But though she sings, or though she sighs,
He sees her not—he sees instead!
A gray-haired Shade with gentle eyes—
The good old wife—long deal—long dead.
He sits beneath the curling vines,
Through which the merry sunrays dart,
His forehead seamed with Sorrow’s-lines,
An old man with a broken heart.

FRECKLES.— These unsightly subcutaneous discolora-

is generally due to a darkening of the epidermis in small

larger surface (“Tan or Sunburn”), while permanent
Freckles (or Lentigo) are deeper seated, and remain even
after the epidermis is completely removed. Clements

Society
At the V.R.C, Spring meeting of last
year, when the Hon. James White’s racing star
was in the ascendant, it was beautiful to observe
such of the old English nobility as happen to be
temporarily located in this beastly country walk
with him into the paddock to see his horses
saddled. The successful owner’s society was in
great demand at that time, and the “ nobs ” loved
him dearly. But this year, after Derby and Cup
days’ results had proved the Hon. James to be
temporarily out of luck, it was particularly
noticeable that the Government House party were
not a little bit interested in him or his horses.
They had dropped their money over the ‘ ‘ blue
and white,” and felt in no mood to be even plea-
sant to their former protege. The outside public
also lost heavily by the successive defeats of
Trident, Morok, Abercorn, Enigma, Cranbrook,
and Lava, nevertheless there was a big cheer
from flat, hill, and stand when, on Thursday,
Carlyon got home in front of Algerian—the more
fancied of the pair. Mr. White seemed very
pleased to find that the vulgar crowd could be
enthusiastic at his poor little win purely out of a
kindly feeling towards the old colours. Hales, too,
brightened up for the first time during the meet-
ing, in which he was generally overlooked in
favour of the great god, Gorry,
# * *
“ Lady Loch regrets that she will be un-
able to receive visitors at Government House on
Thursday next.” This announcement appears so
regularly in the Melbourne dailies that we fear
her ladyship is feeling awfully bored by local sas-
siety. At first the “ popularity” game was amus-
ing enough. On Thursday mornings the Go-
vernoreES underwent a course of dumb-bell exer-
cise, and braced up her muscles for a handshaking
match. But by degrees she wearied of the un-
grammatical adulation of a crowd of heavy-
weight females in their best gowns. The same old
twaddle was repeated each successive Thursday,
until dear Lady Loch knew what every woman
would say to her next. In sheer weariness of spirit,
she tried an “ indisposition ” for some few weeks.
And when that excuse had been worn threadbare,
Lady L grew reckless, until now she merely
“regrets that she will be unable,” &c., without
troubling to give any reasons.

On Oaks Day, at Flemington, no vice-
regal femininity put in an appearance, and the
Lawn was as deserted as a cemetery at midnight.

After wrestling with a few hundred re.
ports of swagger balls and high-toned weddings
in the daily papers, we have discovered the grand
secret of toilet literature. Maidens on the right
side of five-and-twenty are always “ prettily
dressed.” Young matrons are “ charmingly
robed,” and well-preserved middle age is “ be-
comingly attired." But when you read that a
lady was ‘ handsomely costumed ” you can bet
your last dollar that she is in a fair way to cele-
brate her centenary year.

| JThe way of the transgressor being in any
case more or less hard, nobody will be sorry to
hear that the estate of ex-Banker B. Holt will
not only pay all claims against, but will give Holt
at least £lO,OOO by the time he completes his
sentence. Holt’s assets are being carefully looked
aft er by level headed friends, whose efforts in the
direction of saving the ex-banker from absolute
financial ruin are being greatly aided by the
splendid success, present and prospective, of
Rosehill racecourse, in which the erring banker
has an interest.

A recent visitor to the colonies, a Free
Kirk “ meenister” named Cameron Lees, writes
to the Scotsman, running us down more viru-
lently than anyone since Arthur Sketchley. The
rev. doctor is evidently brimful of the proverbial
national regard for the “saxpence”; he found
travelling here very saxpens ive [ls this a goak?—
Ed. B.], and consequently viewed everything,
even Pinchgut, with a jaundiced eye. He com
plains of the water, as if a Scotchman, and a
“meenister” too, could possibly be a judge of
such a thin and flavourless beverage. The
whisky, however, was to his taste, possible be-
cause, owing to the silly Australian custom of
“ shouting” for strangers, he could get gloriously
exhilarated for nothing Let us pitch the doctor a
stave. “ Yiob Alpine MacCallum Mohr, a strain
on your pipes.” (Mac is The Bulletin’s bag-
piper.)—
To the Rev. Dr. Cameron Lees.
When again for the pen you’ve the nationa
itching,
Beware! lest you’re earning, not kudos, but
switching;
For ’bis said, and with truth, that you, reverend
doctor,
Have of frightful misstatements and fibs been

' Alfred Bennett, of the E, News, having
monopolised the Sydney matrimonial market and
the baby‘shamble, the S.M. Herald has started
into another line of business, and hopes by
keeping only the best brands and by attention to
business and civility to customers to merit a con-
tinuance of the patronage of its friends and the
public generally. This is an ad. from the Herald
which we respectively submit for the considera-
tion and consultation of Primate Barry, Cardinal
Moran, James Fairfax, Pastor Jefferis, and John
M’Elhono

2 p.m. yesterday left Ocean-street 'bus and then

Very Parisian!
The will of Father Stack, late of Vic-
toria, who died in Prance the other day, was
proved in Melbourne last week. The estate —all
personalty—was sworn at £14,798. Of this sum
the testator left £13,198 to various hospitals and
other charities in Victorian districts where he had
been stationed from time to time. He bequeathed
nothing to any distinctive Catholic charity except
the St. Vincent de Paul’s Orphanage, South Mel-
bourne, in which suburb he had resided for many
years after his retirement from clerical duties.

The first Sydney newspapers were of a
very primitive order. Thus the Sydney Gazette
of Thursday, February 20, 1823, contains the fol-
lowing announcement “The ship Brixton,
Capt. Lusk, arrived from London on Sunday,
16th. She left England on September 15bh, Just
six months on the voyage. Passengers: Mrs.
Rowe, wife of Mr. Solicitor Rowe ; Mrs. Emmett
and daughter, wife and child of Mr. Wm.
Emmett, who begins to be colonised from his long
residence among us. these gentlemen are id be
congratulated upon the long-looked-for arrival
of their wives."
* * *
The Rev. Inglis, of Ballarat, is going
“ home ” with a hatful of sovereigns presented to
him by his loving congregation. Ballarat Star
says “ Mr. Inglis’ labours date back nearly 30
years, and have been marked by such a spirit of
Catholicity and self-denial as to win for him the
sympathy of all classes.” Just so. Mr. Inglis
carried his Catholicity and self denial to such a
pitch as to—some years ago—prefer preaching the
sermons of others instead of his own. He called
them his own, however, merely as a matter of
form. This is one of the most touching instances
of unselfishness we know of. By the way, it may

not be generally known that it is the custom in the
Presbyterian Church to increase the salary of
ministers £l5 a year for every child born to them.
Mr, Inglis has carried off this premium thirteen
times. There's not much self-denial about that.
It is better to be in the church than on the Press.
A journalist is generally mulct about £l5 a year
for every addition he makes to the collective in-
tellect and hunger of the ear.h. And his family,
if he lives long enough, usually runs from 11 to

The public awaits with much curiosity the
arrival in Sydney of that expensive bauble,
Boehm’s latest statue of the Queen —or rather,
the Queen’s latest statue, by Boehm. It will be
erected just outside the Insolvency Court; Parkes’
statue will probably bs set up one of these days
just inside the Insolvency Court. Boehm’s work
aforesaid, we may safely predict, is to show us
what Queen Victoria, the dreadfully plain, dumpy
little Dutch-built lady of four feet eight or nine,
a not now, never was, and never will be, either
In this world or the next. Leading artists who
cared more about their heads than their reputa-
tions, paused ere faithfully drawing or modelling
Henry the Eighth's repulsive obesity in his own
time; and, as it is claimed for Art that she is
eternal, we may be quits certain of seeing Vic-
toria Regina lengthened as if drawn out by the
rack, and attenuated as it by a course of ten
thousand Turkish baths.

The Anglican Primate threatens that such
members of his church as may advantage them-
selves of the unloosing provisions of the new
free-and-easy Victorian and New South Wales
divorce-laws will be deprived of the right
of being re married by any C. of E. priest. Ac-
cording to this, the Primate is only prepared to
obey the Queen, who is also the Defender of what
remains of the Faith, so long as H.M. does every-
thing he wants her to do. We shall see. It may
be all very well to excommunicate individuals,
but it isn’t so nice for the clergy to excommuni-
cate the wedding fees.

This is the sorb of slobber that Sydney
D.'t, publishes for the women, and then in another
column demands for them the franchise :
‘ Yoit certainly looked very bad, dear,’ said Helen. ‘Do
you think it would be too dreadful to offer Sir Adrian tea at
a quarter to four ? ’ with a glanCa at a fine old eight-day
clock. ‘Do you ever take tea, Sir Adrian i, '
‘A teapot is the favourite companion of my studious
hours,’ answered Adrian ‘ May I ring the bell for you ? 1
‘Yes, please; and you wont laugh at us and call us
washerwomen for wanting tea so early ?'
'lpromise to do neither; but were my brother here I
would not answer for him. He is very severe on my womanish
passion for the teapot.’
' Is he very different from you? ’
‘ Altogether different.’
‘And yet you are twins. I thought twins were always
alike.'
1 1 believe we are alike in person, except that Valentine
is handsomer, stronger and bigger than I. But it is in tastes
and character we are unlike. Yet, perhaps, after all, it is

A man advertises in the Argus (Melb.) of

Albert Park. See how
teeth seem to plague the

molars had dropped out.
Suppose further that.
being too ashamed to look for his lost gums in the
mud, with a few and hurried words of muttered,
not to say mumbled, adieu, Edwin had fled. We
don’t believe anything of this sort took place in
the Albert Park misfortune, but the Argus ad-
vertiser wants his teeth, and seems determined to
let people know.

The Lithgow (N. S. W.) police-officer, whose
prosecution of a workingmen’s club for ‘ * illegally
selling liquor,” seems to have rested on no better

snubbing. Lithgow, by the way, is the place
where a woman under arrest was lately made to
scrub out her cell before she was tried. Too many
policemen scarcely try to conceal their contempt

A Governor, whenever he visits, whether

Here is a little gem from Max O’Rell :
“ In his daily litanies the Scotchman enters into the most
tnfling details with careful forethought j the list of favours
he has received, and for which he has to return thanks; the
list of the blessings he wishes for, and will certainly receive,
for God cannot refuse Mnl anything—all this is present to
his prodigious memory. He dots his i’s, as we say in France;
and if by chance he should happen to employ a rather far-
fetched expression, he explains it to the Lord, so that there
shall be no danger of misunderstanding what he asks for—
he corners Him. Thus I was one day present at evening
prayers in a Scotch family, and heard the master of the
house, among a thousand other supplications, make the fol-
-1 owing‘ O Lord, give us receptivity; that is to say, O Lord,
the power of receiving impressions.’"
Some day, perhaps, Max will come out to Aus-
tralia and size up the colonists. He won’t be so
much worried by prayer out here.

The shareholders of the old Magdala Com-

happy. For 20 years they wrestled with the
depths of the earth till they got their claim down
2500 feet, and then they put down a 500-fcot bore,
making 3000 feet in all, and never a cent did they
get. At last, when they had spent £130,000 and
dared not go down any further for fear of ge .ting
right into perdition and giving the Evil One a
chance t o get out and rush the property, they gave
up, and sold their hole in the ground for what it
would fetch. Then the new owners went and

The New Victorian Speaker, Mr. M. H.

Davies—a “cross between a parson and a local

At present there is at Sydney University

She attends the same classes and dissects in the
same room, and on the same body as the male
students ; attends the same work in the hospital

There is no provision for separata courses of

For some reason or other the Earl of
Buckinghamshire does not seem to belong to the
Melbourne Government House “set.” He scrupu-
lously avoided the vice-regal enclosure at Fiem-

a curb nod. His lordship, however, seems to be
very popular among the better class of Melbourne

The barbers of London have held a con-
vention for the purpose of discussing the present
epidemic of bald-headed men. One artist In hair
thought that beards were at the root of the
trouble, and another pub it down to the criminal
neglect of our infallible restorer at 2s. 6d. per
bottle. But the general idea seemed to be that
the steady falling off in the human wool-crop is
“ due to the great intelligence of the man of the
present period,” producing a certain weakness of
the head-akin. Being a bald-headed cuss ourself,
and holding a poor opinion of Parkes, we are
inclined to favour this last theory something con-
siderable.

Yet we are also inclined to believe that
matrimony is accountable for absence of hair,
especially when it is absent in big round patches.
Billiards, too, is very bad for the top of the
head, and so is backing stiff ’uns. There was not
much horse racing and billiards in our grand-
fathers’ time, and though they got married, they
were not so much married as the present genera
tion. We could write pages and pages about
bald-heads as bearing on the Social Parley ques-
tion, but there is only just time to catch our
train. In conclusion, we will give a word of
advice to young men : If you wish to preserve a
good 'ead of ’air, don’t wear your ’ats in the
hofiice. It is an assumption of authority which
slowly, but surely, widens the parting.

The latest yarn about “ a certain British
peer who suffers from kleptomania,” is that he
purloined his countess’s false teeth and hid them
in a boot. His valet (who empties the boob every
night and restores stolen property to its rightful
owners) thought that those teeth belonged to
another lady and sent them off to her by special
messenger with one of the politely-worded notes
which he is always supplied with against similar
emergencies. It was not until the Countess had
enquired for her teeth and the messenger had
been kicked by the other lady’s husband that
things were straightened out.
♦ * *
Perhaps the most ridiculous feature about
this yarn is the careful suppression of the certain
peer’s name. If a plain Jones or Smith sneaked
somebody’s “mouth’’ and put it in his boot, or
took away silver spoons from a dinner party and
dropped them in his water-jug, the papers would
cut small jokes about these eccentricities until
we were sick But the Earl of D ’s (there
now I) mania is covered up. His political
maunderings are accepted as pearls of wisdom
we are inflicted with long leaders on his sound
common sense and moderate views. And when
he winds up a brilliant speech in the House by
carrying off all the available umbrellas belonging
to dozing dukes then sassiety shuts its eyes and
the press is silent Bahl If ever the “certain
British peer” comes to Sydney and “lifts” our
glass eye when we’re not looking his name and
titles shah be printed on the front cover of The
Bulletin in six-inch capitals.

Acorrespondenbwritea us from Melbourne:
“ The difference between the cock on and the cook off his
own dunghill was beautifully exemplefied the other day in a
case heard before the Supreme (hurt A well-known bully-
ing lawyer had been for nearly an hour cross-examining a
medical witness, and into that hour he managed to cram
more insinuations, gibes, and sneers than even ho is usually
capable of. The lawyer, in fact, was in great form and
fairly surpassed himself. At the close of the cross-examina-
tion the court adjourned for lunch, and our legal friend
blissfully unconscious of any danger, made for Menzies’’
where the big man of medicine was awaiting him The
scene that ensued will not be very readily forgotten by the
three or four score of witnesses—the terrible wrath of the
irate doctor, the livid features of the whilom valorous
man of horsehair, and the crowd that had instinctively
formed a ring round them ; but the cock was off his dung-
?U 11 1 ni rl waa down, and even the shower of adjectives
that fell like hail from the Irishman s ready tongue failed to
make him ‘forget himself' One of the crowd who, without
a movement of his facial muscles had watched the whole
affair, remarked as the barrister at last succeeded in making
his escape: ‘Well, well I aint 'ad such fun since
pa died. Then, suddenly altering his mind he turned
to -.x. th ?™ d ?, ot ? r an ? , shook h ™ warmly by the hand
with, Well done, sir; but you should have given him ust
one. His example was followed by a score of strangers.
The advocate did not forget the above little incident in his
speech, but the judge saw through it, and, in his summing-
up, dressed him down very warmly, adding that nothing but
personal spite could account for the learned gentleman's vin
dictiveness, and the Akgxjs, the next morning, gave a ver-
batim report but for these remarks, which were carefully ex
oised—that, no doubt, comes of being briefed by a naner
From one point of view, all this is very satisfactory, but from
another tis anything but so. In the absence of cock-fighting,
rat-pits, and bull-baiting, which the extremely moral people
of Victoria have forbidden, the spectacle of legal bullies
badgering a nervous and defenceless woman in the witness-
box, with irrevelant and brutal questions, has afforded a
constant, cheap, and congenial entertainment ”

There was one terribly painful feature
about the legal scandal which made things so
warm in Sydney last week. When the Court got
demoralised through the Crown Prosecutor coming
in drunk and hiccuplng over the table, a good
deal of confusion arose, and the jury rushed the
judge’s, lunch and demolished the lot. It wasn’t
much, either, among so many. What the judge
did when he found everything gon«', barring the
bones, is not known. Probably hs sent the
gaol-flogger out for a tart. A great deal
of fuss is being made over the fact that a Crown
lawyer was drunk in Court, but the papers that
are now trying to palm off such an incident upon
the public as a unique item of intelligence ought
to get a pinch for stale news.

Bev. G. Walters, of Melbourne, lectured
on “ Woman’s Influence in Society ’’ a short time
back, and, in a moment of poetic frenzy, observed
that it was “ woman’s mission to war upon war ”
The local Herald printed the lecture, but knocked
all the inspiration out of It by making the clergy-
man utter the prosaical, matter-of-fact remark,
■“ it is woman's mission to war upon man ” But
we must not abuse the poor printer. He put in
what was most natural. As a married man, he
had probably been there himself.

Sir Henry Lock came out strong last week
iu the shape of a race-ball, aid Melbourne
Government House was thronged by 1500 guests,
all eager, excited, and tolerably sober. The ball-
room was decorated with flags, banners, shields,
bayonets, cutlasses, scalps, and grass, intermingled
with shrubs and various kinds of mule provender,
and the entire house was adorned in addition
with flowers borrowed from the Botaaioal
Gardens, Chinese lanterns, and gas. The hair,
ac-o diog ti the D T. report, was generally worn
high on the head, which is about as good a plac i
to wear it as we know of, and keeps it from get-
ting into the taturs. The best-dressed women, it is
further stated, wore traineddresses andharmonious
petticoats, and the corsages were in the Y form.
Among the guests were a nnrquis and mar-
chioness, two earls, one countess, two plain lords,
one female described as “ Lady,” a baronet, an
admiral, and a gallant officer-not the grocery
officer who commands the local fall-back militia
out West, but a genuine individual whe howled
for blood in India, and thought nothing of sticking
two black soldiers and braining a rebel cook and
chambermaid behind the kitchen door before
breakfast. The gaudy scene was shaded off by
supper which ensued about midnight, a I idy, as
a rule, doesn’t look so nice when she is eating as
at some other times, but this rule doesn’t apply to
countesses, for they don’t make the gobbling noise
over their food which is characteristic of some
low-priced personages. The proceedings closed
without any fatalities.

A Sydney commercial went .N T orth and
reached a town which had an hotel but no sample-
room. After exploring the place without success,
he then consulted the landlord and got a better
show. The latter said there was no hall as “he
knowed on,” bub there ivas a church, and as the
parson was a good sorb of fellow, the commercial
might have that, especially as it had not been
consecrated. The parson was applied to and he
proved to be a good fellow. Ha raised no objec-
tions, and the commercial got the church on con
dition that he cleared out by Sunday. After
doing a good turn ot business he proceeded on the
Saturday to the gospel-shop to pack up his
samples On the way he met the parson and told
him his intentions. “ Oh, never mind that,” was
the reply; “come and have a glass of wine
which was excusable considering the heat. The
pair adjourned to the landlord’s hostelry, and
wine followed whisky and whisky followed wine
with such rapidity that the commercial voted the
thing slow, and suggested cards. The thing was
no sooner said than done, and a new pack was
produced. The pair sat there all the afternoon,
and darkness did nob see them parted. Next
morning—Sunday—they were still playing, but at
half-past ten the tinkling bell ot the church gave
them a surprise. “By , there is the
bell! ’ said the clergyman, jumping up, “ I must
be off. ’ And off he want, and preached a rattling
good sermon. This is not the first instance of a
“ sky-pilot” rushing off card-stained to the pulpit,
but our present parson is advancing with the spirit
of the age, and doesn’t make a gambling shop of
tte vestry.
Newspaper Chaff.
The rival editors at Lithgo w have been chaffing
each other. J P. T. Caulfield, the Boy Poli-
cial, of the Mercury, has abandoned the “ Tit
Bit ” column, in which he slogged mysteriously
at people who seemed to consist of nothing but
initials, and let the light in on the amatory in-
trigues of the local “ hunky kid,” the slavey at
the pub., and the “ bloke” round the corner. The
Poet Farrell, of the Enterprise, congratulates
him in the following gorgeous f verses
“ We’re unmanned —so much emotion
Weighs us down, we can but weep—
Ah! our tears would fill the ocean,
O verflow the briny deep !
We have never felt so solemn—
Never known such stress of pain
For that treasured ‘ Tit Bit’ column
We shall never see again !
“ Think of that, alas ; but think of
What the ruthless Boy has done—
Never more our lips shall drink of
That pure fount of wholesome fun—
Never more a happy truant
From the weary tasks of Thought,
Shall we revel in the fluent
Paragraphs by slaveys wrought I
“ Never more, as to a bridal,
Shall we skip to meet the boys
(Ah! it makes us suicidal
Thinking of those bygone joys);
Never, keen as famished vultures,
Shall we swoop upon the heap

And obtain one on the cheap !
‘ ‘ Ah ! such blows as this have been our
Cruel, bitter, changeless fate !
So we sadly muse as in our
Silent room we ruminate
As across our memory flit bits
Of the ecstacy gone by,
The exceeding comic Tit Bits
That have almost made us die !
“ How we’ve pondered on the riddle
Of who that slim chap could be
With hair parted down the middle,
On whose amatory knee
Bob the Chucker’s girl was sitting
At the party at the Flat I
How with sides with laughter splitting
We’ve endeavoured to get at
“ What the red-haired girl was doing
All that Sunday on the hill,
Or why Wall eyed Peter’s wooing
Seemed to be at a standstill,
Or why Ikey didn’t tackle
Long Mulrooney at the Ball,
Or what any of the cackle
Could have been about at all I
“ How the choice things here unmuzzled
Oft have put us in a fog,
How Jack Slack has left us puzzled,
And the girl from Hollow Log 1
How we’ve hungered for the paper,
Waiting through a weary week
Just to know what was the caper
Mary cut at Yorkey’s Creek I
“ But, alas ! these things are over,
Never more while life shall last
Shall we read of Sarah's cove, or
Billy’s girl—their day is past ;
Never more, ah, never, never
Shall we chuckle as we read
Various malty items clever
In this multifarious screed !
“ How we’ve wallowed in and gloated
O i the dazzling wit that flashed
From the paragraphs devoted
To the ‘mashers’ and the ‘mashed.’
Many a time—ah, many and many—
Have we wilted with delight
Over things that Sal or Annie
For this column used to write 1
“ Here the housemaid, all dishevelled
Resting from the mop and broom
Shafts of cunning scorn has levelled
At that rascal Joe the Groom.
Here the female cook indignant,
Leaving good ‘ Titbits ’ to burn,
Has essayed with quill malignant
To give Bob the Boots a ‘ turn I ’
“ Here the Editor full often
* Socked it on ’ to ‘ chaps ’ and ‘ blokes
Till our brain began to soften
Working out the hidden jokes.
Here, in days gone by, we’ve revelled
In the graceful verbal flow
Of the crushing charges levelled—
Though at whom we did not know.
“ This, all this, will uever gladden
These our eyes again on earth.
Is it wonder that we sadden,
Or is this a time for mirth ?
Why should not our grief be v. cal
At the loss of these loved Bits
Wherein many a person local
Many a time has gotten ‘ fits ? ’
“ Let us study the position,
Let us look at it and weep—
He who gave us all a ‘ dishing ’
Has for ever gone to sleep.
He who slogged has put his shirt on,
He who writ lain down his pen
And a Tit Bit about Gurton
Shall be seen no more of men !
“ This thought tears our heart to ribbons,
And may send us on the drink—
Never more will Dr. Gibbons
See his name in Tit Bit ink.
While this earth whirls in its orbit
Fleeing wildly round the sun,
Hint of Henry Proudfoot Corbett
In the Tit Bits shall be none I
“ Never syllable of ‘ Masher ; ’
Not another word about
Brisbane Doyle or Dr, Asher,
Johnny Connell, Hughes, or Clout!
Nothing more—a rusty pin sent
Through our flesh would cause less pain—
About J. C. Jones or Vincent
Shall be seen in there again !
“ Never shall we read and learn ’em
These light hearted flippant things—
Vale ! Vale in eternam,
Tit Bits; Dust are clowns and kings,
Dust are ‘ mashers’ and their ‘mashes ; ’
Blokes ’ and ‘ donahs,’ fools and wise,
All things here are dust and ashes
Save the Litiigow Enterprise.
“ Vale ! Bitter though your loss is
This is certain—ye are gone,
We have all to bear our crosses ;
Let us try to worry on !
Dearest Tit Bits, how we miss thee.
None but loving hearts can tell—

Evening News can write as well)

We condole with you, and say

May the Mercury be lit! ”

As Hyndman’s crowd have done,
That Royalty is but a snare,
Delusion, and so on.
Yet we, Australia’s loyal sons,
Heed not such traitors’ tales,
We charge our glasses and our guns
And empty them—for “ Wales ! ”

Let virtuous Stead disclosures make,
And give the world a shock,
Such scribes as he can never shake
That faith which firm as rock
Australia’s loyal children feel
In the eldest of the males
Whom “ Vicky ” bore to Albert leal—
The glorious Prince of Wales.
Chorus—Hail, &c.
Let Mordaunt and Lord Colin slide,
We care not what they say,
The Prince their stories has denied
On oath, hip ! hip ! ! hooray ! ! !
And if the letters that he wrote
Give colour to such tales,
Nathless will shout Australia’s throat -
“ God bless the Prince of Wales.”
Chorus—Hail, &c.
Though tradesmen tell their tedious tales
How Bertie’s bills go bad,
Our royal chick don’t mind their wails
He’s used to them, egad.
He does not care a single damn
For bankrupt courts or gaols,
Why should ha ? John Ball standeth gam,
And pays the bills for “ Wales.”
Chorus—Hail, &c.
Let pious parsons pray and preach
“ God bless the Prince of Wales,”
While demagogues may loudly screech
Of starving London's wails.
Our loyal hearts may feel consoled—
Gaunt Famine’s tiger nails
Shall never fix their fiendish hold
On the noble Prince of Wale?.
Chorus—Hail, &c.

Another illusion gone. Out of the 46.000

there wasn’t a Jew on the earth who hadn t
money to lend at five minutes' notice. Probably
these pauper Jews have anticipated the advies of
Mr. Theodore Fink and given their attention to
literature and art, instead of pa vynjbrjkinz and

these Bitters Invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USB.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals, diluted with same quantity of water. For

ABOUT THEM.
Messrs. E. Rowe and Co.
With thanks for forwarding mo a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried.
Yours faithfully,
HENRY CHARLES CURTIS,
M.R.C.S. England.
Port Adelaide, October 30 1886.
Gentlemen, —1 hae great pleasure in recom-
mending Row’s Dan elion Bitters. I have been
suffering for several years with Liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them,—
Yours,
O. R. UPJOHN, J P.
Tamworth, August 21, 1886,
Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned:—
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“lam glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflicted as I have
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain. Dear Sirs,
“ Respectfully yours,
“MARY TERRILL,

Bilious affections, liver com-
plaints, SICK HEADACHES, DYS-

RANDERSON’S LOZENGES.- A mild, prompt,
and effective remedy. There Is scarcely any
disease in which purgative medicines are not re-
quired, and much sickness and suffering might be
prevented were they more generally used. No
person can feel well while a costive body prevails ;
neglected and injurious symptoms soon show the
sufferer that disease is gaining upon the body, and
fatal results often follow which might have been
prevented by timely and judicious use of RAN-
DERSON’S LOZENGES. For they correct the
whole system, quickly dissolve in the stomach,
being more mild, prompt, safe and uniform in
their operations than most aperient medicine. As
a family medicine to keep always by you in case
of sickness they are invaluable. Old and young
alike may take them, being pleasant and agreeable,
so that children are saved the unpleasantness of
taking medicine. Sold by all Chemists and
Druggists.

ILLUSTRATED HISTORY
BOTANY BAY.
AUSTRALIAN HISTORY FOR AUSTRALIANS.
Every year in Australia sees another stage in the formation of a population as different from
that of thirty or forty years ago es that of the United States of to-day is from the early
Spanish settlers, or the Pilgrim Fathers of New England. A history of Australia has not
been written for the new people—yet. These new people are the nucleus of the coming Aus-
tralian nation-not the descendants of old Imperial officialdom, or of the people whom that official-
dom ruled. Unfortunately, however, the traditions of the past survive in Australia, while the
events that fathered those traditions are forgotten. The result is that Young Australia finds
itself dominated by the surviving remnant of a class whose history will make the Australian people of
the near future burn their records and pray for a tidal wave.
♦ U *
A look-out on Australia to-day will disclose a strange state of things. Upwards of three millions
of people, in one of the finest countries in the world, have a chance in the struggle for existence
the peer of which no other spot on the globe save Eden has ever seen. But these three millions of
people, with their popular democratic institutions, are governed in the interests of a small class by a
little knot of me a who rule in the name of the people but cn the lines of the strictest and nar-
rowest conservatism. We have in Australia our manhood suffrage, vote by ballot,
the jury syftem, popular legislatures, and all the marks of an advanced political
spirit. Yet side by side with these we have rankly flourishing and openly encouraged, all
the inequality of secial conditions, the invidious class distinctions, the great monopolist property
in land, the old feadal spirit in our property laws, and the mark of the same old familiar bloody
hand in’ our penal legislation, that the free institutions we have just named were deliberately In-
vented by English Liberals as political weapons to destroy.
* * *
The crude anomalousness of all this is patent. But it only requires to be looked at through the
history of the past to be at once whistled down the wind. We have clothed the ass’s body of
social conditions and feudal-law traditions In the lion’s hide of pseudo-democratic Institutions.
When the lion is expected to roar, we only hear the other animal bray. We are still
ridden by the influence and ruled by the lineal descendants of the squalid officialdom of the
grisly past. The whistle of the lash and the clank of the convict’s chain are still distinctly heard,
though fifty years have passed away since transportation ceased, and a democracy of freemen
has been settled by immigration in Australia. The reason is, in a word, that the men of the class
that came into existence under the Imperial regime made the most of their time. They founded
family fortunes, and became territorial magnates and lords of the soil. They seized on the owner-
ship of land, and established the principle of such ownership, and so consolidated a power and an
influence that have enabled them to hold their position up to the present, and to buy up the dangerous
leaders of democracy, body and soul.
* * *
Australian public spirit touched its highest level in Victoria under Graham Berry when he
swept the country from end to end on an election cry for the bursting-up of big estates. That is
the pivot on which the Australian politics of the future will turn. But the question will never
stand out in a white I’ght until Young Australia learns who the founders of big estates and vested
Interests were, and how these estates and interests grew. Young Australia will never learn
Ihcil until the history of the past is candidly and fearlessly told. But when it is so told, and the
lesson learnt, then Young Australia will have also learnt the profound truth that these colonies
will never get rid of the taint of a squalid officialdom, built up by the exercise of gaolers’ authority
over a herd of cruelly abused wretches whose crimes were outweighed by their expiation, until
the Imperial connection which rivets the past on the present for us becomes an exploded myth,
and these colonies of ours form federated states under an independent Australian flag. The Im-
perial connection keeps the Past in its place. While it continues the public life of Australia
will continue to be ridden by the horror of the past—the nightmare of our history—as Sinbad
the Sailor was by the Old Man of the Sea. Australia's own history, fairly told, alone can strip
the bandage from her eyes. When that is once done the Imperial connection must go.
* • *
This is why The Bulletin is going to tell the history of Australia from its own point of view.
The past has been veneered over by wealth from the gold discovery, and by free Institutions that
came full fifty years before their time. The Bulletin is going to scrape off that veneer. It
is time that the theories of the people who want to engraft British feudalism on Australia were
tested by a cataclysmic visitation of fact. Flying literary visitors like J. A. Froude mercilessly in-
struct us in our domestic concerns in the light of a ten days’ experience of one side of one
narrow colonial class alone. Two or three Australian politicians meet in the cabin of an
English admiral and concoct a conspiracy by which British militarism shall be engrafted upon
our system for ever and a day. Shotted rifles menace a public meeting because those who
object to an address to the Queen on her Jubilee outnumber those who don’t. Politicians who
claim to hold democratic faiths threaten drastic legislation to crush the advocates of unpopular
views which are unpleasant to the ear of official authority. And a surviving representative of
Vandemonia proposes in his old age “ a whiff of grape ” as his prescription for Young Australia
when she writhes under the intolerable burden of her Old Man of the Sea. All this would be a
screaming farce if it were not so gruesomely serious. Oar people s ignorance of our own people
Is abysmal. We have had poets and politicians, preachers and pseudo-patriots, penal laws and
public institutions of a c’asa the like of which—thank the gads!—have never been seen before
since the crust hardened on the earth. These phenomena spring from certain pre-existing causes.
If the hair of the reader should happen to stand on end when we tell him what these grisly causes
were, we are not to blame. We did not make our history. We only tell it. We merely flay the
carcase cf the hybrid and moribund monstrosity now on our demonstrating table, and dissect the
congested organism underneath.

Watch Words
FROM THE PRESS,
The “WATERBURY” has been more highly
spoken of by the Press than ANY OTHER WATCH
ever produced. The following are selected from
hundreds of similar notices :
The Watchmaker (Land). —“Guaranteed to
give a maximum of results in timekeeping at a
minimum of cost.”
Manchester Examiner— “A splendid time-
keeper.”
Manchester Courier— “ They are admirable
timekeepers.”
Birmingham Post—“ Keeps accurate time, and
is a good-looking and handy watch.”
Glasgow Herald— “A good timekeeper.”
Glasgow Citizen—” A good timekeeper."
Leeds Mercury— “ Keeps excellent time.”
Sheffield Telegraph—” Never has a better
article been produced for the money.” .
Newcastle Chronicle— “ Areal timekeeper.”
Bristol Times and Mirror - “Handsome in
appearance, and a marvel of horological mechan-
ism.”
Bristol Observer —“ A surprisingly good
watch.”
Northern Evening Express— “ A marvel of
cheapness, and a good timekeeper.”
Halifax Times—” A real watch, of good
appearance, and which will keep excellent time.”
Edinburgh Express—“ lb keeps time wonder-
fully.”
Pictorial World—” Our own experience is
that the watch is perfectly reliable.”
Freeman’s Journal (Dublin ) —“Serviceable
to all. Altogether a capital article.”
Dublin Evening Telegraph—” Extremely
good timekeepers."
Belfast News Letter— “An excellent time-
keeper.”
Belfast Northern Whig— “Anexcellent and
reliable timekeeper.”
Weekly Times (Land.)—' “The famous Water -
bury—a favorite all over the world for accuracy
and good appearance.”
CAN ANY OTHER WATCH PRODUCE
TESTIMONIALS SUCH AS THESE?
IF IT CAN, LET IT TROT
’EM OUT.
TWO ORGANS.
Regulate first the stomach, second the liver; especially the
first, so as to perform their functions perfectly, and you will
remove at least nineteen-twenthiethe of all the ills that man-
kind is heir to, in this or any other climate. Dr. Soule’s
American Hop Bitters is the only thing that will give per
fectly healthy natural action to these two organs. “Maine
Farmer."
New South Wales —This colony at the present time
assists a larger number of Emigrants from Great Britain
than all the rest of Australia put together. The climate be-
ing hotter than in other parts, disease here assumes a sub-
tropical character and we find Fevers of all kinds, Diarrhoea,
Dysentery, Cholerine and Cholera pmrail at certain periods
The Chinese in New South Wales have long since learnt,
thanks to a kind-hearted nobleman who employs many
hundred Celestials, that the easiest and most successful
method of cutting short and curing these diseases, is at once
to take a dose of Freeman’s Chlorodyue which in the majority
of cases arrests the further progress of the malady, or to con-
tinue it according to the directions until the disease is cured
—Sold everywhere throughout the Colonies. Insist upon
having “ Freeman’s " only. Reject substitutes as they are
worthless. Trade mark, an Elephant.*

Consumption, Bronchitis and General Debility
will yield quicker to the regular use of “Scotts Emulsion
of Cod Liver oil with Hypophosphites,” than any
other remedy known to Medical science. Read the following:
“I have prescribed 'Scott's Emulsion’ and have also taken
it myself, and can fully endorse the opinion that it is both
palatable and efficient, and can be tolerated by almost any
one, especially where Cod Liver Oil itself cannot be borne.

A LAND-GRABBER FRIGHTENED.
A man stopped at Bonrke a few days ago and
thus addressed an old fellow who stood with his
arms resting on a fence: ‘Do you live here?"
“Don’t see me dying, do you?” “Ah, you are one
of the funny men I have heard about in this
neighborhood. I want to know the names of
several people. Where is J. B. Honeysuckle?”
“Dead.” ‘ Ah, what was the matter with him”
“Sick.” “ What kind of sickness?” “Dry fever.”
“Let’ssee” (consulting a scrap of paper). “ Where
is T. W. Snicker?” “Dead ” “What did he die
of?” “Dryfever.” “Humph! Wheracanl find Sim
Snodgrass?” “In the graveyard.” “Dry fever?”
“Yes,” “Do you know anything about Bill
Slivers?” ‘ Just laid him out.” “ What was the
matter with him?" “Dry fever.” “My friend
I came into this neigborhood to buy land.” “We've
got the finest country on earth. Yes right here,
I’ve got 800 a. that I’ll let you have cheap.” “How
does it shape?” “Al." ‘How is the water?”
“Best in the world." “Land rich?” “Yes.”
“Tan you get any St. Louis Lager Beer in the
place?" “Any quantity. Some just landing,’’
“ How is the neighborhood in the way of health?”
“Finest you ever saw.” “No chills?” “Not
one. In early days there was just one case ; he
shook himself to death. He lies two and a-half
miles above any burying ground.” “ What about
those fellows that died with dry fevers?” “ Oh,
them fellows ; why, you see we had a terrible dry
spell here the past three years, and it was time
they did die.” “ I don’ want any land this time.
Come and join me in a glass of that famous St
Louis Lager Beer. I leave by the next train.”

MRS. PARTINGTON SAYS
Don't take any of the quack rostrums, as they are regimental
to the human cistern; but put your trust in Dr Soule’s
American Hop Bitters, which will cure general delapidation,
costive habits, and all comic diseases. They saved Isaac
from a severe attack of trip d fever. They are the ne plus

We are on the job In Upholstery, and simply
invite our friends to call, as space will not admit
of chronocling a few special bargains where so
many prize bargains abound.
But our confidence in the matter of bargains in
Upholstery, is so strong that great though the
temptation is to avail ourselves no farther of the
press, yet what we have done, what we are doing
and what through great, marvellous, October we
will do, is excuse sufficient to break through al
resolves.
Suites for Drawing-room in solid Wal-
nut, and spring set, frames all
close braced, upholstered in
very best manner In own
factories, and covered in Tapes-
try of silk and wool, gimped and J
corded, and finished In first-class
style, for the sum of £l2 10 0
Will bring more money under the hammer. Could
not —and here let us say it’s worth the while of
those who read the statement to go through
Sydney houses and judge for themselves, the
above suite could not be got in Sydney a brown
cent less than £lB 10s. Yes, the suite is of 9
pieces. But hold on searchers after “ bargains"
we will give you a surfeit of them at Lawler’s dur-
ing this great October sale.
Look at this ye joyful widowers' who purpose
furnishing again.
Suite of 9 pieces, upholstered on the
premises, webbed from frame in
best manner, and with best web,
spring set and upholstered in
olive terry, the small chairs hav-
ing upholstered panelbaoks, ... £8 10 0
How is it done! Well, that’s not the lookout of the
buyer. Let the buyer buy, and buy quickly,
whilst bargains of the kind are before him, or as
sure as the sun will shine to morrow he’ll have to
plant down his sweet little £l2 12s. for the suite
above referred to at Lawler’s at £8 10s.
The £24 10s, suites in Tapestry and plush—and
where can such a selection of frames and furniture
coverings be seen—yes, those charming suites will
only be £lB 10s. during this sale.
There are some 20 suites upon the floor at £35,
which will be sold during this sale at £25 10s.
But those who want the best Dining-room suite
in Sydney, massive, bold, handsome, glorious,
something in solid Walnut and in real morocco,
here’s a line worth coming to look at.
Massive Dining-room suite in solid
Walnut, upholstered through-
out in curled horse hair, and
covered in real best morocco.
Value, £9O but at October’s
sale, £57 10 0
This could not be repeated, so there’s no use of say-
ing that It could. The frames alone are worth
£3O.
And sideboards and Dinner waggons and Tables
to match.

those who read we say bear this important fact
in mind that we offer no old stock, ill-fashioned
and damaged, for the simple reason we have none.

Poor old Juggernaut is not half the man
he used to be. His celebrated Festival is dropping
down to the level of our Guy Fawkes Day, and
instead of dozens of naked natives flinging them-
selves under the wheels of his Car it has become
necessary to hire coolies willing to pull Jug. along
for a consideration. All the grand heathen cus-
toms wither under the cynical stare of civilisation.

and generous nature. The religious feelings of
the Johns have become blunted by chunks of road-
metal, and Christian attacks on their wheelbar-
rows. They loaf on to the little matin front of
the porker, and take their bit of crackling with a
derned agnostical grin.
In the early, pre-railway, King Cobb days
a certain bishop and a fellow-passenger, whose
name began with a large O, were travelling on a
Western (N.S.W.) road. Towards evening the
driver pulled up slick opposite a swollen, impass-
able creek and close to a wayside shanty, where
they got out to camp for the night. His lordship,
by way of starting a conversation and at the same
time maintaining his dignity, observed : “I say,
Pat, you’d be a long time in the old country
before you slept in the same room as a bishop.”
“ Bedad, I believe so," replied Pat; “ and by the
same token I’m thinking that you’d be a long
time inthe ould country, too, before they’d make
a bishop of yez.” His lordship engaged in silent
prayer for the rest of the night.

sideration.
Things are getting hot in Europe, and it
Is becoming doubtful whether it would pay better
to he Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria or one of
Parkes’s creditors.
The last straw. The other day we saw a
Chinaman going around selling soap. After this
we shall not be surprised to see an onion travelling
with otto of roses.
A flag-pole fell out of a first floor window
in Bourke-street, Melbourne, the other day and
struck a pressman on the arm. He claimed
damages and got them. If it had struck him on
the head, the ether side would have been entitled
to damages.
A Sydney pawnbroking business Is adver-
tised for sale in the E. News. In view of recent
disclosures, we are prepared to name more than
one politician whom this ought to suit.
The Church of England Syr ods in Aus-
tralia sre held on the lines of Parliament. Quite

A Sydney suburban nuisance-inspector
has lost an action against the boss of a vicious
dog because the gentle animal didn’t bite him “ in
a public place.” The public place of a nuisance
inspector Is, we suppose, his nose.
A young fellow found a purse containing
£9OO at Bondi the other day, and the owner came
along and rewarded him with one shilling. There
can be no doubt as to which of these two will
make the most sucoeesfol politician.
Magistrate Abbott disposed of 126 cases
in 102 minutes at Sydney Central Police Court
the other day. With a little more practice Mr,
Abbott will be able to adjudicate at the rate of

The anniversary of the battle of Inker-
