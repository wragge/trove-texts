It doesn’t matter whom you
see light up "Ten to one, it’s
a CAPSTAN." During thirty
years these famous Virginian
cigarettes have grown in
popularity to the point where
the vast majority of smokers
in every walk of life prefer
CAPSTANS. Such popularity
must have a very sound foun-
dation. That foundation is
based on Wills’s guiding prin-
ciple—" The utmost in quality
at the lowest possible price."

band Fiction
I know of nothing on the current shelves
hat seems more worthy to be called grand
ction than the early part, of Pearl S. Buck’s
he Good Earth (Methuen; 7s. 6d. net).
r p to about page 200 it is prose narrative
)ld with classic restraint, and sometimes
.en with austerity. But though it is aloof
id majestical, with the chill winds of its
ortli China setting blowing through it, it
irs and moves with the life of living
■oplo; primitive and raw people; Chinese
orkers of the soil; so surely, idiomatically
re on the page that it is surprising to
am that the writer is not herself Chinese,
t is a mission-worker among them. Taking
is as evidence, she must be a good mis-
oner. She has understanding. Her
iine.se woman. O-lan, seems transcribed
ther than created, a transcription of the
mitive such as is seldom equalled. O-lan’s
my philosophy, her angular body, her
tient child-bearing, her working in the
Ids with a hoe—this seam of gold alone
ikes Tin Good Earth a real and vital
vel. It is not all. The novel is the saga
Wang Lung, his slow, fateful advance
un owning a small plot of the wind-bitten
id to securing bit by bit a drug- and
•man-bankrupted estate, until he is a
in of importance, able to desert O-lan’s
d and irrstal the light lady Lotus in the
ler court, and send his sons to school, and
: be stirred by thinking of the times when
few birds salted with their feathers on
•resented plenty in his hut, or of the hole
the mud wall where he and O-lan hid
hr little silver, or of his standing outside
.e door sniffing and hearing the child-
iaring going on inside without benefit of
idvvife. Now a flood that covers all the
id merely makes idleness; even such a
night as that in which they had got
wn to eating grass—some to eating their
n children—could not shake him now.
en. of course, they had to flee by way
the fire-waggon to the city in the south,
i live there one way and another until
revolutionary disturbance enabled them
do a little looting and get back to their
n land, Wang Lung with some gold,
an with a hidden bag of jewels. Wealth!
d W" ang Lung had gone close to selling
daughter, and they would have found
% she was a halfwit and killed her,
poor mouse! Wang Lung is fine; very
il done; but O-lan is the success, and
;:t to her the setting, as visible in drought
•n plenty. All this applies to the first
t oi the book. At about page 200 the
ter falls into a pitfall that was never far
ay; her natural English lapses into undis-
sed Bible parody;—
nd lie reaped his wheat and Ihe rains came and
young green rice was set into the flooded fields
again it was summer.
nd, listening, he heard the murmuring of a man’s
e, and it was the voice of his own son.
ad she cried more loudly at this and protested
t the hungriest, hunter of money’s worth
uld find enough before parody takes
itrol to easily overbalance it and the
snuation of the story that goes with it.
‘sly Chapters
There are, as indicated, touches grisly
High in The Good Earth; but they
uciong. Those in the wildly-constructed
A otehook of Malle Launds Brigge, by
Rainer Maria Rilke (Hogarth; 7s. 6d. net),
are, bv comparison, merely such stuff as
the effects in a stage thriller. According to
the blurb writer, this first book of Rilke’s
to be translated into English is a master-
piece of creative art and delicate portraiture,
and also an important psychological docu-
ment. I am glad of all that assurance: it
is good to feel that perhaps one is wrong
in thinking any given book both pretentious
and dull. But such an opinion may not be
peculiar when the book consists chiefly of
this sort of truth and beauty (if you don’t
like decomposition you needn’t read these
extracts; the comp., poor beggar, has to);—
Perhaps one of his blood-vessels had burst; per-
•aps, just at. this- moment, some poison that ho had
long dreaded had penetrated a ventricle of his heart;
Pei haps a huge abscess had risen in his brain like
a sun, changing the world for him
n-nrnc then ’ was this girl with the rotting
? w j! at was °n ">y right I could not make
11 aftel ' some time. It was a huge, immovable
S’ - a , d a t f ? ce an,T a lar ge> heavy, inert
! n fl’ JFij? s , ld ! ® f lhe face that I saw was empty,
liute without features and without memories!; and
iTwas grflesome that its attire was like that of a
corpse dressed for the coffin.
Or, to pass over some quite boggy matter,
now are these for three similes from half
a page?—
Now it grew out of me like a tumor
It Was there like a huge, dead beast
nut the big thing gathered and grew before mv
face, like a warm, bluish boil.
The curious work
—it is presented as
entries nervously
made in a note-
book—is said to be
thinly - disguised
autobiography. In
places it is vivid enough, and it certainly
gives a clear picture, of sorts, of the writer.
Whether any writer at all is worth looking
at through his own made screen of sores and
dirty bandages and disease is another ques-
tion. Rilke is dead now; he must have
been horribly sick when he wrote this
unhappy book.
More of the Grisly
There is a fair amount of the horrible,
too, in Vanished Fleets (Bles; 16s. net),
wherein Tasmanian journalist A. J. Villiers
delves into the early maritime records of
Hobart and brings to light material for nearly
a score of chapters in which the grisly, the
exciting and the primitive are roughly
mixed. Here, though, the horrible is not
introduced for morbid effect; it is atmo-
sphere to the wild and rugged action. Vil-
liers has the knowledge of the sea that
comes only to one with the salt in his blood.
He has a good eye for the picturesque, and
when he stirs himselt he can make his words
give out the swing and surge of the sea
and the fighting on it. There is good read-
ing in The stories of Jurgen Jurgenson, who
was sailor, whaler, explorer, privateer, naval
officer, spy, author, dramatist, preacher,
revolutionist, gambler, prisoner, convict
doctor, police constable, editor, exile pro-
spector, vagabond and King of Iceland
(apparently he was like the greater Jurgen
and would try anything once). Captain
Kelly’s fight with Maoris is another good
patch, and the writing, at its best, is as
colored as this:—
The port was cosmopolitan then, with nothing of
the sleepy Colonial air about it, or the quiet spirit
of the grim pioneer. The dregs of the earth came to
the quaint old streets of Hobart Town; around the
taverns of the waterfront —and the whole town was
then little more than waterfront—Mexicans with
tings in their ears and knives in their shirts drank
hilariously, quarrelled madly, fought bitter]v, lurched
drunkenly, together with pale-faced Nordics, slow to
tight but quick in thirst; Spaniards jostled African
negroes—great, handsome, muscular follows, invalu-
able on shipboard—and derelict Englishmen (and
splendid Englishmen, too; paid for the drinks of
Peruvians, and Finns, and Germans, and Hollanders,
and Turks, and Irishmen, and loud-voiced Americans;
and suffered sometimes, with a bored air, to accept
a return of the compliment. When the whalers were
in port there was life! The ale flowed in the
gutters, and afterwards blood, too; and the village
policemen, if they were wise, retired to a game of
bowls; and vice ran wild and licentious, and the
'‘Good old days” were bad indeed. Life was cheap,
then, and beer and women were plentiful and not
expensive.
Villiers has written better sea books, or at
least, better balanced ones. The cribbing
of yards of the old document stuff in the
raw makes it seem a patchwork, instead of
the fine unity his ability ought to have
achieved. For he is one of the best sea-
writers alive.
Some Omnibuses
Much in a heap several interesting omni-
bus books have fallen from various publish-
ers. Easily the best of them, I think, is
the Collins-printed complete Oscar Wilde
in one volume, selling here at 15s, 6d. The
print is good, the book a neat size: as fine
a bit of work at that house has dond for
years. The omnibus Shaw, done by Con-
stable, and selling here at about £l, . is not
nearly so good a job, though at that price
a book holding all Shaw’s plays—right up
to The Apple ('art-— has the sound of a
bargain. I personally dislike the double-
column printing; also, I believe the best of
Shaw to be in his prefaces. Those literary
gems are absent! Beverley Nichols’s three
best jobs. Twenty-Five, Are They the Same
at Home? and The Star-Spangled Manner,
are bound into one volume by Cape, selling
here at about 10s.; and for those who like
ir plentiful and like it varied Gollancz
offers what he calls The Holiday Omnibus,
priced here at about 11s., and containing
Elmer Rice’s satire on the movies, A Voyage
to Purilia (antidote even for a Rilke note-
book); the novels The Purple Cloud , by
F. Sheil, and The Mystery of Orcival, by
Emile Gaboriau; short stories (Eleanor
Smith, Dorothy L. Sayers, L. A. G. Strong.
Martin Armstrong); three chapters from
life-stories ( Life of Sir Edward Marshall
Hall, Bengal Lancer, and The Kangchen-
junga Adventure)-, a play, The Barrets of
H vmpole Street; and Humbert Wolfe’s book
of poems, This Bhnd Rose. It ought to
make booksellers’ work easy even in Aber-
deen.

TINTARA
important source is the journal of that
mighty man of God the Rev. Thomas Wil-
liams, Wesleyan Methodist missionary in
Fiji from 1840 to 1853. Mr. Henderson,
who is Emeritus Professor of History at
Adelaide University, has done his job extra-
ordinarily well. He gives the missionaries
full credit for their manifest sincerity and
the appalling difficulty of their task. Their
nerves frazzled by daily scenes of horror-
murder, wholesale assassination, cannibal-
ism, boys walking past them calmly chew-
ing the meat from human bones —they were
not in a condition to view the South Sea
islander objectively, even if their education
and theological beliefs had equipped them
for the task. It is unfair to judge the
mistakes they made in the light of present-
day experience; but the results of their
efforts can be summed up, without much
prejudice, in Bertrand Russell’s well-known
phrase “The Evil that Good Men Do.”
A recent conference of Australian church
bodies re-confirmed a determination to go
on proselytising Brown Brother, whenever
and wherever found. A report of the de*
bate on the resolution shows that the ideas
on the subject of missionary aims are much
what they were in the Rev. Williams’s day.
The conventional notion is that the wicked
trader was busily engaged debauching the
native with gin and syphilis when the mis-
sionary arrived and proceeded to undo
the evil work; but it is possible that,
except, for the syphilis—and even in spite of
it, perhaps—the trader would have proved
a better friend of the native if he had been
left alone by his brother of the cloth.
Of the laymen who have spread Western
civilisation amongst the heathen, some have
been good and wise, like Brooke and Raffles;
others have been bad, like Marshal Dsendels
and the beachcombers of popular romance;
but all, with the exception of the Portu-
guese, have been distinguished by one thing
—they didn’t care tuppence for Brown
Brother’s soul. If the trader had been left
to his own devices he would soon have
got a bad conscience and allowed his Gov-
ernments to pass laws stopping him playing
merry hell with the native girls and the
native economic laws. But no Christian
Government dared stop a missionary play-
ing merry hell with that far more susceptible
thing—the native’s mind. There are hun-
dreds of examples of Christian Governments
preventing their subjects exploiting the
commercial innocence of their colored
dupes, but it is difficult to imagine a
Christian Government, even on medical
advice, decreeing that the native should
return to his pristine state of- healthy
nakedness, or, on the advice of sociolo-
gists, ordering him to go back to his
tribal gods or to revert from psalm-singing
to his ancient ritual dancing and
religious festivals. The missionary barged
;» where the trader would not have dreamed
of treading and proceeded to transform
the native’s psychology. He gave Brown
Brother a sense of sin and a sense of shame,
and frightened him into the missionary con-
venticles by blood-curdling threats of
Hell. He used Western medicine quite
cynically to demonstrate the superior
powers of Jehovah over the witch-doctors
of the tribe. His operations led, as he
himself admitted, to producing in the native
a complete anarchy of soul. This anarchy
led to such violence that the British Gov-
ernment was compelled to take over
Rotumah to suppress a civil war between
Roman Catholic converts and proselytes
of the Protestant sects.
Java is a convenient argument for the
other side. Here the trader has never
allowed the missionary to intervene to any
great extent, and even where he has the
results have been small, for the indigene
happens to be a Mohammedan, and is at
least as proud of the Crescent as the mis-
sionary is of the Cross. The effect of
the absence of missionaries from Java is
that the native retains his self-respect, his
native dress, many of his arts, crafts, customs
and laws and a great deal of his natural charm,
even in face of the latest offensive from
Hollywood. Moreover, the Government,
having no alien European moral and ethical
standards to consider, can go ahead and
educate him in non-theological knowledge,
encourage his normal desire for cleanliness
along scientific lines, and otherwise help
him to remake his cosmos to meet his
modern needs. Java, with its 35 millions
and its rising birth-rate, is a monument to
the trader and the lay administrator; the
monument to the missionary are sundry
South Sea islands where remnants of a once-
vigorous race are coughing their lives away
in sac suits and Mother Hubbards and with
the fear of the Christian Hell in their eyes.
The whole picture is perhaps not quite
as bad as this. Considerable enlightenment
has come to missionary thought with the
sad experience of the years, and the South
Seas a century ago presented problems
beyond the solution of the available wisdom
of the time. But there is sufficient truth in
if to make it worth the missionary bodies’
while to include a study of Henderson-’s
book -in the curricula of their gospellers.
M.G. SKIPPER.
A Satchel of Books
The Green Ship, by Gordon Volk (Skeff-
ington; 7s. Od. not), contained £1,000,000
worth of treasure, and had reposed in a cave
on the South African coast since 1700. Near
by lived a homicidal Boer farmer with an
army of trained baboons. He hadn’t realised
that the ship was on his property till a
mixed bag of heroes and villains arrived from
England in quest of its contents. Then the
slaughter started. Read on from here if you
are a healthy, bloody-minded small boy. The
present critic called it a day.
Beauty and the Beast, by Charles Wood-
ington (Elkin Mathews; 7s. Gd.). Short
stories bursting with an adolescent conscious-
ness of sex and faulty psychology. It is diffi-
cult to feel sympathy for a modern hero who
throws up his girl because her mother made
her pose in the nude for an artist at the
age of 15. “I can’t understand it,” he con-
tinued slowly. “I wouldn’t let a man paint
me like that, much less a woman.” Tut, tut!
Fly Away Home, by Nancy Morison
(Sampson Low; Robertson and Mullens;
7s. Gd.). A second impression and deserves
several more for its truth and humor. The
writer has studied her Bohemian and musical
London and draws an effective contrast
between her conventionally brought-up but
tolerant heroine and the hero, who is a con-
vincing portrait of the artistic temperament.
The pair part after a helpful and virtuous
three months together, leaving the reader to
decide whether they were right or wrong in
doing so.
When God Dropped In, by Dale Collins
(Herbert Joseph; 25.), is the first of the
Fountainhead series. The Almighty arrives
in a blue sac suit, and smokes Collins’s
cigarettes and drinks his whisky. The some-
what strangely-assorted pair then indulge
in a discussion on the riddle of existence, in
which trite expression is given to what Berg-
son, Bernard Shaw and other philosophers
have said on the subject. There is
no suggestion that the Deity has had any
higher sources of information than what a
hasty reader of those authorities could assimi-
late'in the course of a busy journalistic life,
so a really priceless opportunity of having
the problem settled once for all was neglected
by the Australian novelist.
H. de Vere Stacpoole’s Pacific Gold (Col-
lins ; 7s. Gd. net), though the work of a
high-class tradesman, is machine-made
throughout. The quaint, lovable old sea-
captain, his religious nevvy, the San Fran-
cisco millionaire who borrows dollars from
strangers, the crooks, the movie magnates, they
are all stock characters; and the Marathon
tiff between the hero and heroine, during
which, though neither makes the shadow of
a wounding remark, both suffer deeply, is a
stock situation. Set against these defects,
however, an exciting plot, a number of
charming descriptions of North Pacific
scenes, and some inspired writing about ships
and yachts, and the result is a worth-while
novel. The “gold” which the treasure-hunters
pursue, by the way, is ambergris.
The Conqueror, by Georgette Heyer
(Heinemann; 7s. Gd. net), sets forth, on a
basis of history seasoned with a deal of
mostly romantic fiction, the career of Duke
William of Normandy from his birth until
he became King of England. The work shows
some dexterity and industry, but the atmo-
sphere compares poorly with that of a
Ilereward the Wake. The figures prance and
glitter; they are ' not real. A dedication
refers to the “historic manner” dear to the
authoress, but it is not altogether clear what
her conception of the histoi*ic manner is. In
the Battle of Hastings, however, the word
“destrier” is used again and again where
most people would be content to write “war-
horse” or “charger,” and this may throw
some light on it.
Shadow Show, by Beatrice Sheepshanks
(Low; Robertson and Mullens; 45.). Lorna
Alison leaves Bali for London to avoid the
amorous attentions of her uncle, Van Heep.
She finds Londoners just as susceptible as
Dutchmen in the tropics, and when a stage
manager wants to make her his mistress she
returns to Java, where she marries a man
20 years older than herself. A well-told
and entertaining tale in which romantic love
is such an overmastering passion that the
mosquitoes and other disabilities of the
tropics sink into insignificance. They are
never mentioned, in fact, which places the
book as a story of the white man in the
tropics in a class entirely on its own.
Fame’s Fetters, by Leila S. Mackinlay
(Mills and Boon ; 7s. Gd. net), tells how Paula
Clavering, ran away from her Mayfair home
leaving a note for her father and mother.
“I am going- away only for my art’s sake,”
she explained. She joins the “Cheery-o’s”
on tour. Come the talkies, and “The
Cheery-o’s” have to disband. So she gets a
job in vaudeville. Later she becomes “The
Masked Singer” at a London night club,
where she is identified by her horrified
parents. And so to her engagement to a
rising young barrister; —
From the ashes of a short hut glorious career as
“Polly Corinne“ Paula rose to a new life.
By love the fetters of fame had been broken.
A brightly-written yarn with some vivid pic-
tures of stage life.

“Lao-dah”: An American edition of
Norman Lindsay’s “Redheap” has been pub-
lished by the Cosmopolitan Book Corpora-
tion under the title of “Every Mother’s
Son.” It is described as “the great novel
of adolescence —full-blooded, honest, vital,”
and Burton Roscoe says of it; “Probably
the most important novel of the year—
earns shelf-room alongside ‘Old Wives’ Tale’
and ‘Of Human Bondage.’ ” It is an inter-
esting question whether a book under a new
title is not a new book. If it were, there
is a case for its being resubmitted to the
Australian censor, giving Forde an oppor-
tunity of repairing his mistake.
“Lao-dah”: Australians are amongst the
foremost and most astringent of literary
critics in highbrow circles in London at
the moment. Two of the chief contributors
to the ultra-modernist “Calendar of the
Arts” have been Bertram Higgins and J. W.
Turner, and their essays were included in
“Scrutinies,” Si symposium compiled from
the review. A second volume of “Scrutinies”
published last year, contained work by Jack
Lindsay, Brian Penton, Higgins and Con-
stant Lambert. After 10 years abroad Hig-
gins has redescended on Melbourne, and
contemplates enlightening his fellow-
countrymen on the verses of T. S. Eliot
and others as soon as he can find a con-
venient platform.

GETTING BACK TO WORK.
We are having too much economics; every
stump sprouts a theory. We are spending
our mental and other energies over too wide
a field. Discussion of whether gold has
outworn itself as a standard of value or
whether a goods standard is feasible may be
very interesting, but it doesn’t bring our
unemployed back to profitable employment;
and compared with that nothing else matters
very much. No doubt to the seaman the
type of ship, the type of engine, the type
of compass and a thousand other such things
are tremendously important. But it is no
time to discuss them when the ship is on
the rocks and its crew and passengers are
in danger.
We have at least 300,000 people out of
work. Why? If they could be transported
in a body to, say, the North Coast of N. S.
Wales, and provided with a few tools and
seeds and cows, they would' all soon be at
work and supporting themselves.. They
would discover that there was employment
for eveiy single man and woman of them —
employment in providing for their own
wants. Wherever they are to-day they have
the same wants, and there are the tools
and the seeds and the cows in abundance;
also the land. Probably the chief reason
why they are not using these things—why
they are doing nothing—is that the place
is overrun with schemes and policies. We
are trusting to something else except work
to save us; and nothing else will do it.
“But,” it is answered, “it will not pay
us to employ labor. The price of our export
products is too low.” Now, that difficulty
has to be met. In the first place, nothing
that we can do will increase export prices.
There is no hope in that direction. The
theorists can talk on the subject till they
are blue; and while they talk we starve.
As we cannot get over the difficulty we
must get round it.
If those 300,000 unemployed were trans-
ferred in a body to the North Coast and
there formed a self-contained community—
if they had no debts to pay abroad and
neither imported nor exported—they could
make their wages £5 a day if it pleased
therm But obviously if wages were £5, and
the producers had a surplus of, say, butter,
they could not hope to sell it overseas on
the £5-a-day standard. Thus they would
require two rates of pay—one for goods
consumed at home, and the other for goods
exported. And that, of course,' is imprac-
ticable, because, for one thing, it can’t
be told in advance which particular pound
of butter will be sent away and which one
will be used at home.
The Protectionist met the difficulty in
another form years ago. He found that if
he did not raise a tariff wall and shelter
behind it, he would either have to abandon
the idea of local manufactures or work at
approximately the same price as the
cheapest foreigner. He decided that it would
pay him to put up the price against him-
self: that if he exported £1 and bought a
foreign article, the country would have only
the foreign article; whereas if he put up a
tariff and spent £2 on a local article, the
country had both the £2 and the article.
The point is, to what extent and by what
process can we apply the same principle to
necessary exports? For the necessity of a
certain amount of exports will have to be
admitted—unless, of course, we repudiate
or default. At present rates of exchange we
must sell at least £40,000,000 of goods for
delivery abroad in order to pay our public
and semi-public interest bills. How can
we keep up the price of the product used
for home consumption while making the
price of that part exported low enough to
find a market abroad?
Years ago we were faced with that diffi-
culty in regard to sugar. It was a variable
crop, and either a large surplus or a small
deficiency was possible. If there was a
surplus it could only be sold abroad at a
price which would not pay expenses; and the
few who sold abroad would face a heavy
loss. Rather than do that, they would
throw their product on the local market,
glutting it and lowering the price. To en-
able good wages to be paid in the industry,
the Government bought all the crop at a
fixed price, fixed also the price for the sale
of refined sugar in Australia at a figure sub-
stantially in excess of the purchase price,
and used the balance to wipe out any loss
there might be on the overseas marketing of
the surplus. Subsequently -the plan, with
modifications, was extended to butter and
eggs; in Queensland it has been adopted
also with wheat. In effect, it is a tax upon
the community for the maintenance of
prices above world’s parity; but, as with the
protective duty, the community at once
puts the tax back in its own pocket.
The extent to which this system can be
applied to our products whose chief market
is abroad is a matter for consideration. This
aspect was some time ago discussed by The
Bulletin in relation to wheat, and the
conclusion come to that the most convenient
plan for helping the farmer was through a
sales tax. Home consumption amounts to
about 30,000,000 bushels; with an export of
90.000,000 bushels, w r e could add 4d. to the
farmer’s price for every Is. 4d. of tax col-
lected on the home consumption. An addi-
tion of 4s. to the price of wheat consumed
at home would give the farmer Is. on the
basis of one bushel used at home for every
three exported. No tax on home consump-
tion could make an appreciable difference
to the price the wool-grower would get for
his exports. But against that has to be set
the fact that the labor cost in wool-produc-
tion is almost negligible.
It is possible that some less complicated
plan for giving protection to the indis-
pensable primary producer can be devised.
If it is available it should be welcomed.
The necessary thing is to get some plan
into operation. Other nations are doing
it; it is stated that in France the home-
consumption price of many home-grown
products is three times greater than world’s
parity. Already, as we have seen, we have
followed the practice to some extent, be-
ginning with sugar. It is true that the sugar
bonus has been vigorously fought in the
south. But that is not so much due to the
principle as to the two circumstances that
Queensland alone benefits and that too little
of the advantage goes to the farmer and
too much to the field and mill labor. An
extension of the principle to wheat, wool,
meat and fruit would spread the benefits
fairly evenly over the whole Common-
wealth.
When the sales tax on wheat was pro-
posed certain Labor bodies denounced it.
They were not going to have the cost of
living raised against the working man, they
said. But the trouble is that three out of
every eleven of them are not working men,
and the eight who are working are being
heavily taxed to keep the three out of work.
There is no sense in that. Surely it is far
better to devise a scheme by which the
whole eleven can tax themselves into
employment; and that is the whole basis of
the Protectionist policy.
HAS OUR REIGN OF TERROR
BEGUN?
There is a mysteiy here which should be
solved. The Lang Government is insolently
pursuing a policy in brazen enmity to the
one which its leader put before the country
less than a year ago. In ordinary circum-
stances this would produce emphatic pro-
tests within the party. But-if there have
been protests they have not been heard.
Lang has changed his direction; he has made
a complete right-about turn. And the whole
party in the Assembly follow him, keeping
step with him, though plainly often quite
in the dark as to what the next step is
to be.
Now, that would not be very remarkable
if the rank and file of Labor men made the
same right-about turns. Such changes might
conceivably have taken place as to natu-
rally produce complete somersaults. But
the astonishing thing is that only the Labor
members in the N.S.W. Assembly unani-
mously follow Lang in his twists and turns.
There are three other Labor Premiers in
Australia—Scullin, Hogan and Hill. They
are all in complete disagreement with Lang.
But of all the members of the Labor party
in the N.S.W. Assembly there is not one
who supports these three Labor Premiers;
they all support Lang. These three
Premiers are wrong; Lang is so right that
he commands the support not merely of a
majority but of every single one of the
Labor members in the N.S.W. Assembly.
That alone would be astonishing; but
there is something more astonishing. There
are 80-odd members of the Leg. Council of
N. S. Wales, of whom 50 were nominated
by Labor Governments. Many of these 50
are still members of Labor bodies—men
like Edward Grayndler, gen. sec. of the
A.W.U., Australia’s greatest union. On
what was declared to be a vital bill the
other night only 17 of these members could
be found to support the Lang Government.
The others denounced the measure and
voted against it. But not a single Labor
member of the Leg. Assembly raised so
much as a protesting squeak when the bill
was before their Chamber; every Labor
member of the Assembly ranged himself
behind Lang.
But there is something more astonishing
still. The Labor party has long been one
throughout Australia, and the Federal
authority has been supreme. Some months
ago Lang and the leaders of Labor’s Fed-
eral executive got to loggerheads, and Lang
and his group openly flouted and defied the
Federal authority. Now, Lang may be right
or the Federal authority may be right;
the astounding thing is that every single
Labor member of the N.S.W. Assembly
sided with Lang, and every single one of
them declared the Federal authority wrong.
That Lang should command a majority
—even an overwhelming majority—of the
Labor Caucus in the N.S.W. Assembly is
not beyond understanding. But that he and
the “inner group” of the Trades Hall should
have such a hold upon the Caucus that
not a single member of it will take sides
with all the other Labor Premiers and
Governments, with the majority of Labor
nominees in the Council and with the
Federal executive authority of the Labor
party is more than surprising—it is mirac-
ulous.
Or it would be miraculous if it were
not probably due to what, if it is not a
crime, ought to be made one. The fact
is N. S. Wales has permitted a system of
extra-Parliamentary government to develop
and alongside it a system of terrorism.
There is not a free agent within the Labor
party in the Assembly. There is not one man
who dares to speak his mind fully and freely
and frankly. Even the Caucus is not its
own master. There is a body outside and
unknown to Parliament which instructs
the Caucus. Who instructs this extra-
Parliamentary body nobody knows but some
suspect. This “inner group” holds—or
makes the mob think it holds—the political
life of every member of the Caucus in the
hollow of its hand.
Every little while it is announced that the
party is seething with revolt. It is nothing
of the sort. It dare not even seethe. For
the most part it is cynically complaisant.
Its members are no better or no worse than
most men. They have a good job—an
infinitely better job than most of them ever
had or ever will have again—and they are
prepared to make sacrifices to keep it.
There are few men who would not do that.
There are few men who are not .doing it.
The real crime against the State, and
especially against the democratic institu-
tions of the State, is being committed out-
side Parliament. Here is a group of men,
owning no allegiance to the people and
deriving no authority from them, who are
subverting our Parliamentary institutions
and by intimidation are interfering with
the rights of members, which are the rights
of the people. If such a body attempted
to thus influence so much as one member
of a jury of 12, it would stand a very
good chance of going to gaol for anything
up to five years. But either there is no law
to prevent interference and intimidation
at the fountain-head or those in authority
are themselves the helpless subjects of
this new Reign of Terror.
SUGGESTIONS FOR AN IMPROVED
AUSTRALIA.
Australia has too many electors, and the
way to improve the quality is to reduce the
quantity. There aren’t enough good electors
to go round. Most offences, down to a
third conviction for assault and/or bad
language and a dozenth conviction for
drunkenness, should involve five years’ dis-
franchisement, and great care should be
exercised to prevent mental defectives be-
coming electors at all.
The voting age should be raised—perhaps
to 24 or even 25. A white human being
may be qualified to manage his or her own
affairs at 21, and a white human orphan
may start of necessity managing much
earlier than that. But it doesn’t follow that
he or she is qualified to manage other
people’s affairs—a nation’s affairs—at 21.
A person may be too young, or too old, or
too middle-aged for the job of ruling, but
being too young is most frequent.
There should be more States in Aus-
tralia, some of the existing ones being quite
unmanageable. There should be more State
capitals, they and their vicinity being the
only places where population shows much
tendency to accumulate. And there should
be more State legislatures. They are
cheaper than local administration by Labor
conferences is likely to be. Perhaps 4s. sd.
per head per year might be saved (on
paper) if both Federal and State Parlia-
ments were abolished, and trades union
congresses and secretaries had full control.
An additional 12s. fid. per head per annum
wjuld be saved (on paper) if the police
force was wiped out for being uncivil to
Communists, but it would be replaced by
gangs of armed thieves and thugs, so the
economy wouldn’t pay. The State legis-
latures are bad, but they would be better
if the members were selected by better
selected people.
Unification is certainly not wanted. It
is a scheme for making Australia into one
vast and bloated political estate devoid of
landmarks. It would be the reversal of
all that Australia has striven for since be-
fore 1825, when the setting up of Tasmania
as a separate institution indicated that
Chaos was about to begin settling down.
There is nothing on earth resembling the
proposed Unified Australia, unless it be the
Unified Antarctic Continent, and there is
no demand for it. The nation which has
produced Lang and Beasley, and the
wrecked N.S.W. Government Savings Bank,
and the Lang repudiation is in no position
to teach the world the art of government.
The improved legislatures should have
no fixed vacations, and should be liable
to sit eveiy day including Sunday. The
tendency of the worst Ministries to-day is
to do without a Budget and without Par-
liamentary interference, and to run the
country’s business by regulations. Only by
persistent sitting has the Senate been
able to prevent the Scullidore Cabinet
making some absolutely new laws, all of its
own, about preference to Beasley’s par-
ticular friends in the waterside industries—
in fact, a monopoly for them, and disquali-
fication for all whom the Communist bosses
object to.
The power of Ministers to annul or re-
duce sentences or to order the release of
arrested persons without trial has become
a scandal, and calls for abolition. It is
probable that after its abolition another
scandal will arise instead, but the existing
one should be abolished all the same. The
wholesale distribution of pardons brings in
money and votes, 'and rotten Ministers
make big profits out of it. Also the svstem
creates a privileged caste of criminals who
can threaten weak Ministers with political
extinction if their privileges are not recog-
nised. The power to cancel or reduce sen-
tences should be in the hands of a non-
political court of appeal.
The right of Ministers to create new
billets in the Public Service and to make
appointments thereto should be strictly
limited. The size to which the evil has
grown was recently illustrated when the
Lang Ministry made 90 new appointments
in one act, and the 90 promptly proceeded
to deserve a continuance of their good luck
by declaring their adhesion to the “Lang
plan” of finance, though nobody knows very
clearly what the “Lang plan” is to-day and
much less what it may be to-morrow.

What Are We Waiting For?
The political crisis in N. S. Wales has been
notable for the supreme confidence of the
Lang Government that it has the whole-
hearted support of the people in carrying
on with its present policy—whatever that
policy may be. Opposition to it by a
nominee Upper House and a Governor
nominated by authorities overseas is natu-
rally exasperating to high-principled poli-
ticians and their backers, eager to urge on
the Millennium even though the country
goes broke in the process. For this reason
the taxpayers and unemployed, many of
them waiting to know when they may re-
cover their money from the wrecked savings
bank, have perforce to stand by while
the more important question whether the
Lang Government has the Divine Right
to run the State as it pleases is settled.
Mr. Lang has personally informed the
Governor of Mr. Lang’s infallibility, but
without, apparently, greatly impressing his
audience. Mr. Willis in London has also
helped by whispering in the ear of the
Dominions Office and the press of the world
that all N. S. Wales loves Mr. Lang. By
way of further sheeting home the thes”’
two fledgling Labor politicians, Mess
Kinsella and Landa, have carried throu
the Leg. Assembly what is practically ' i
instruction to the Imperial authorities th
it is the absolute duty of a Dominic
Governor to accept the advice of Mr. Lan
no matter what Mr. Lang’s advice may be.
But surely there is a much easier way for
the Langsters out of their afflictions.
Instead of barging with Governors and
Imperial Secretaries of State who may, after
all, be stupid people incapable of seeing
the Grail pursued so steadfastly by the
Galahad from Auburn, why not put aside
these shackles and appeal to the great heart
of the people which beats only for Mr.
Lang?
Mr. Lang’s one excuse for not doing this
is that the country is so enthusiastically
in his favor that the anti-Lang factions
would be practically obliterated. But why
not get rid of these blights—not to say
blighters? That done, there would follow,
as in Queensland years ago. when Ryan
and Theodore won to power, the abolition
of the Second Chamber, the “rearrange-
ment” of electoral boundaries, and other
constructive acts contributing to a long
and prosperous reign for the Labor party
and its camp-followers. Everything in the
garden would then be lovely, with lashings
of the most succulent fruit begging to be
picked. *
What is Mr. Lang waiting for?
How the Dole Pays Me Best.
This comes from Broken Hill; The Bulle-
tin has made inquiries and is satisfied that
the facts are as stated:—
Because, so I' was told, I was known as a good
worker, I was offered a job at 15s. a day out of
my turn. Now, as a married man with a family of
four to support, I was bound to do for them and
myself the best passible; so I had to reason this
way: 15s. a day is equal to £4 10s. a week; but
the work is rationed, so I would lose every fourth
week, and that reduces the wage to £3 7s. 6d.
Lang won’t calculate it that way, so, as I am paid
fortnightly, I lose 4s. 6d. in unemployment tax.
Our hospital charge takes another 6d., and the
union, with subs, and levies, accounts for another
35., so that the wage would be down to £2 19s.
6d. before the wife got a look at the envelope. Then
there would be an average loss of half a shift a
week (Christmas and Easter holidays and Labor
Day account for 16 days, with, say, 10 days a year
for sickness and minor injuries—jars, crushed lingers,
and so on, inevitable in the class of work I would
be doing), so the effective wage is brought down
to £2 12s.
As I would he working, the landlord would natur-
ally expect his rent (15s. a week) ; so there would
be only £1 17s. for food, clothing, etc. I turned
the job down—and thus one more “good worker”
became an acknowledged loafer. On the dole I do
not have to pay rent, because the landlord knows
I know I was charged (and paid) l above a fair rent when
working, to cover such periods as this; and, any-
how, he dare not apply for an eviction order, as
he is a small business man and is therefore peculiarly

HIS CLEAR MANDATE.
“That’s my clear mandate from the people; and if you stop me accomplishing it, Mister Governor, you’re gone a million, see!”
susceptible to a boycott, which can be jambed on
pretty hard in these parts. I get more fuel than
I could possibly buy, and the dole gives more and
better food than would reach my table if I had
to work and pay for it. Clothing comes from some-
where or other, and as “a good worker’’ I get
sufficient odd jobs to give me more pocket money
than I had when earning- considerably above the
155.-a-day job offered me.
To get the same living as I and my family are
getting now would require from £6 to £6 10s. a
week, and so long as I can get the dole I am not
going to work any more till I get that wage.
I have talked to my mates, who think the same
as I about it; so the job will most likely go to
some single chap, who would do better on that wage
than the dole, or more probably to one who wants
to give his lady love a home until they, too, have
a family large enough to make work unprofitable.
Somebody did say something to me about ethics,
but I don’t know what the word means. T can’t
afford a dictionary, and I haven’t the time to go
to the library. But
God Save Lang!
The Federal Budget.
The Federal Treasurer produced his Budget
for 1931-32 last week, in striking contrast
to Lang, of N. S. Wales, who produced his
Budget for 1930-31 less than a month ago.
Theodore published his proposals for the
year a fortnight after the year opened;
with characteristic contempt for the people
who are pawns in his game, Lang mentioned
his proposals for the year only a fortnight
before the year ended.
It was a mixed story that Theodore had
to tell. In the past year, and apart from
loan works, the Government had spent
£10,756,899 more than it had collected. For
that excess expenditure the Government had
to depend on the banks, as well as for the
inherited deficit of £6,458,723, brought for-
ward from June 30, 1930, and the £3,834,149
of interest on debt due by N. S. Wales to
Britain for which Lang has deliberately
defaulted—a proceeding which of itself alone
demands of the Governor his prompt dis-
missal. As at June 30, 1930, Australian
Governments had come at the Australian
banks for no less than £33,075,000, two-thirds
of it on behalf of the States; and now there
is a further £22,268,000 which the Gov-
ernments have got from them by way of
overdrafts. This in addition to whatever
sums political highwaymen have lifted from
the people’s savings banks.
In view of these figures, very severe cuts
in all expenditure were imperative. Higher
taxes will not balance things, because every
higher tax now pushes a few more businesses
over the border-line, and either ends them
altogether or makes them unprofitable.
Theodore’s revenue estimates have l’arely
been realised; yet even he expects this year,
in spite of higher rates, to get only
£13,200,000 from direct taxation as against
£18,652,179 collected last year. With
primage raised to 10 per cent, on some lines,
the sales tax lifted to 6 per cent., additions
to ordinary and special income taxes, and
• uch cuts as will carry out the contract
made between the Premiers, a deficit of
£5,176,300 is still anticipated.
All that can be said is that it is a promise
of less bad things. But it is still far from
satisfactory; and there is no hope of good
which even the half-way niggei' at Colombo
regards with a sniff.
A home-made debt, if there must be a
debt, which seems doubtful, should be the
first plank of a sane political platform.
Other things will follow.

Elector and Possible M.P.
His Honor addressed the prisoner as fol-
lows : :
John Fitzclarence Smith, the charges which the
police have proved against you are habitual consump-
tion of methylated refreshments, vagrancy in a
general sort of way, bad language with violence,
consorting with criminals when they will allow you
to, being notoriously insanitary, and failing to sup-
port your wife and children (if any). You have
had property in your possession reasonably suspected
of being stolen, and what property wasn’t in your
possession you had doubtless exchanged for the means
of continuing a degraded and hog-like career of
sleeping out and being found on premises where
you had no business to be. You have done no work
within the memory of the oldest policeman. This
is your 247t1i conviction, and a persistent course of
binding you over in your own recognisances to be
a reformed blot on the landscape has produced no
good result. If you continue much longer you will
probably be jugged as a habitual criminal. At the
same time I am pleased to assure you that these
defects in your character, and any others that may
develop later on, won’t necessarily incapacitate you
from keeping your place on the electoral roll, and
helping to select the country’s lawmakers, and being
one of them yourself. Some day, if your species
multiplies, you may even send a methylated majority
to Parliament. It is our proud boast that the Legis-
lature must be thoroughly representative of the
people whether they pay anything towards its upkeep
or not. I don’t suppose you will attain to the
Upper House, but if it is abolished the whole field
of politics will be open to you to graze in.
Accidents in Mines.
The sons are punished for the sins of the
fathers still. The history of accidents in
British mines is foul reading. Until 115 years
ago there was no such thing as an inquiry
of any kind; and it took another 40 years
of ceaseless agitation to make inspection
adequate and the official inquiry effective.
Indeed, it was not until 1850 that accidents
were even systematically reported.
One curious survival of that agitation is
still with us. Ostensibly because an acci-
dent showed that danger was lurking around
(especially in coalmines), and to express
sorrow and sympathy, men got into the
habit of knocking off in- a working when
a mate was killed: sometimes at once, some-
times on the day of the funeral, sometimes
both. Behind what was often a camouflage
the purpose was plain: to show the owners
that it didn’t pay to have accidents. With
the adoption of safety measures the old
practice fell almost into disuse: in the
golden days of Australian mining—the ’nine-
ties and the first years of this century—the
metal mines entirely forgot it. That, how-
ever, was followed by a new era: the era
of class consciousness, when the more the
owner was pin pricked the better. So the
rule that all hands must knock off when a
fatal accident occurred in a mine was restored.
A holidaj’ more or less did not matter
much when metals were fetching boom
prices; to-day, with only two or three base-
things until a wave of confidence sweeps
back over the country. And we might as
well look for a shower of gold as for confi-
dence while Lang is in' power and the wholly
unauthorised sovietisation of the Mother
State is in full progress.
♦
The Cheap Home-made and the Costly
Imported.
In the pre-Federation days of mixed tariffs,
N. S. Wales, as the State which was intoxi-
cated with importing ideas, tended to
import its debt; while Victoria, inclining
more and more to Protection, leaned
towards the locally-manufactured article.
The other States took ho very definite
stand. As a result there are striking varia-
tions in the oversea interest bills of the
various States. These are the six of them
at the end of June, 1930, apart from the
unknown quantity, interest on casual over-
drafts, cadges, misappropriations and steals:

The London or New York interest has to
be paid by the export of gold, of which the
local supply is now only a drop in the
bucket of the demand (the drop is nearly
exhausted and the bucket has grown out of
all knowledge), or by the export of goods
which oversea people can be persuaded to
buy for gold. Sometimes they are very hard
to persuade, especially people in New York.
In a time of adverse exchange, like the
present, £IOO borrowed oversea at 6 per
cent, costs really 8 per cent., the extra £2
being exchange, brought about by the exces-
sive importing habit. A 6 per cent, im-
ported debt may cost £8 net for the use of
£IOO for one year, as it is doing now. A
6 per cent. Australia-made debt may cost
£4 net for the use of £IOO for one year,
being the nominal £6 less taxation. There
is always some taxation to come off the
local £6, for the Australian bondholder is a
lawfully taxable Australian subject, and in
bad times the lawful taxation may be
heavy.
N. S. Wales, as the State whose political
fossils stood for the Freetrade and import-
ing idea, is naturally the State with far the
largest oversea debt, the largest oversea
interest bill, and the largest calamity to
face by reason of the lamentable exchange
problem. Also the State with the braggart
Freetrade tradition is the first and only one
to go basely and shamefully bankrupt and
leave its burden to its neighbors, the five
non-repudiating States of the Common-
wealth, and especially to Victoria, the State
with Protectionist traditions. On the other
hand, Protectionists were naturally the first
to realise that it is worth while to keep such
an industry in the hands of our own people.
Not only do our own people take £4 net in
these hard times when others demand £B,
but they accept payment in a currency
which London and New York despise, and
metal mines working full time in all Aus-
tralia. every penny added to the costs per
ton makes some ore definitely unprofitable.
This question of lost time has thus become
of the first consequence; for overhead costs,
including interest on capital invested, run
on whether the mine is at work or idle.
The point has lately arisen at'Mt. Isa, in
Queensland, where an Australian co. with
Anglo-American backing has'spent nearly
three millions of money on a very large
low-grade silver-lead show, and must work
on a vast scale at very low costs to even
pay its way; and if it can’t do that nothing
is more certain than that it will close down.
In works of this class and magnitude con-
tinuous operation is essential: the furnaces
must work all round the clock, week in.
week out. To keep them supplied it is
almost as essential that there shall be no
complete break underground; yet to the
consternation of the co., the local branch
of the A.W.U. “upholds the previous decision
re stoppages of work, and has no intention
to depart from the old custom.”
Well, customs are none the better for
being old; the question is, Have the con-
ditions which produced the old custom
changed? Is it any longer necessary for all
hands to lose a day’s work and imperil their
job altogether in order to get safety mea-
sures adopted underground? When this
custom was adopted there was no other
way open to the miners: they had not got
the franchise, and did not win it for many
years. To-day they not only have it, but
have had their own Government in office
most of the time the last 15 years. So there
is no more reason for maintaining this “old
custom” than there would be to hire a
watchman to go round the city streets crying
the hours.
Our Futile Agents-General.
Sydney “Labor Daily” commented last
week on a cable suggesting that Agent-
General Willis was being ignored in
London:—
As the accredited representative of the New South
Wales Government, his credentials would at any time
since his arrival have ensured whatever audience he
desired with British Ministers.
The fact is—and the discovery nearly
broke self-respecting C. G. Wade’s heart—
Agents-Generals have no status in England
whatsoever, and no functions. A Minister
might happen to pass a word with an A.-G.
at a party, or in the street, but for him to
give one an official audience would be a
gross breach of etiquette liable to lead to
all sorts of trouble. The High Commis-
sioner’s office is the only channel through
which the States can communicate with
Britain. To do Willis justice, he hasn’t
claimed that he has been allowed to state
the case for Lang or his Plan. Only that he
is “making most valuable contacts with
financiers and business men, and hopes,
shortly, to speak at a dinner of Labor
members.” No A.-G. can do more. The
most useful one any Australian State has
sent since Federation was a Tasmanian who
got some fruit orders for his Speck.


SERVICE
The establishment of a Bank does not in itself establish a Banking
Service. It provides only the machinery which is to be operated by
man for the service of man. The human factor is the vital spark
that gives life to a mere aggregation of buildings, books and currency,
and makes of them a friendly, helpful service for the convenience of
the people.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank extends its facilities throughout
the length and breadth of Australia, through Branches and Post-office
Agencies, and trained officers translate those facilities into understand-
ing human service to the thrifty.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Owing to the illness of Henchman, J„
appointed by the Queensland Chief Justice
to take the Mungana case against Theodore,
Goddard, Reid and McCormack, the date for
the hearing has been advanced from July
13 to July 20. With the Budget and the
conversion loan to attend to, as well as the
sheaf of measures arising out of the Mel-
bourne conference, Theodore must have wel-
comed the respite.
The Vic. Education Inquiry Board is
expected to recommend some substantial
savings in technical and high schools and
in administration generally. Including per-
centage deductions on teachers’ pay there
will be probably a cut of £550,000 or a trifle
more. The outlay in 1929-30 was approxi-
mately £3,000,000.
Professor Berriedale Keith, who has writ-
ten a book in which he discussed Slang’s
shindy with ex-Governor De Chair, was men-
tioned during the Assembly debate on the
powers of Governor Game. “He is the most
bitter partisan in the Empire,” shouted Slang.
“The most destructive cyclone for over 40 years
passed over N.S. Wales last week.”
THE CITIZEN : “I hope this one’ll blow over
without swamping the Upper House.”
“What he says is not true. He is anti-Labor ;
he is_ impudent; he is Berriedale Thief,
not Keith.” Again : “He takes the reputa-
tion of the great Labor party away.” But
that’s impossible. The age of miracles is
past.
_ The most damning commentary on Prohibi-
tion yet published here has come from the
Australian-born Dr. Henry Howard, pastor
of the Fifth-avenue Presbyterian Church,
New York, for the past five years. He says
briefly that very much more in the way of
intoxicants is now consumed in the U.S.A.
than ever before, that the annual drink bill-
lias risen from 1800 million to 2800 million
dollars, and that there are 43,000 “speak-
easies” in New York alone. Australians who
have gone to America, subsidised by one
side or the other, to report on Uncle’s
experiment saw what they wanted to see.
The Rev. Howard has seen what he didn’t
want to see and lived in the midst of it.
Lower-paid unmarried officers of the Vic.
public service who escaped percentage deduc-
tions in 1930-31 will be docked 114 per
cent, from July 5 under the Hogan retrench-
ment scheme. The lowest-paid employee is
the female junior-teacher on £74 p.a.; she
and her fellow-workers will contribute, but
no mar Tied men under £2OB will be touched.
The percentages keep on mounting to 30 per
cent, on £5OOO, which is what Chief Railway
Commissioner Clapp collected. The Supreme
Court Judges will voluntarily forego 26 per
cent.; W. 11. Irvine is not drawing his
C.J.’s pay of £3OOO p.a. while he is Acting-
Governor.
Reduction of the cotton bounty by 20 per
cent, threatened to bear heavily on the
growers, since the staple is at a very low 7
price. However, after conferring with the
Queensland Cotton Board, the spinners in
Sydney decided to shoulder 50 p.c. of the
reduction in respect of cotton bought from
the board, as long as prices remain as at
present, and 100 p.c. if values continue down-
ward until spot stands at sd. per pound.
The sum involved is considerable; bounty
payments last year amounted to £105,000.
Adding- exchange and deducting repara-
tions, Britain’s extension of the Hoover plan
to Australia-—a “generous” gesture, as Theo-
dore says—is equivalent to a reduction of
four millions in Commonwealth expenditure.
As this wasn’t foreseen at the Melbourne
conference, the Federal Treasurer might
well have moderated his
taxation proposals, or made
some of them conditional on
the actual concession of the
four millions. As it is,
primage duty rises from 4
per cent, to 10 per cent., and
sales tax from 24 per cent,
to 6 per cent., while the
general exemption on “earn-
ed” income is reduced from
£3OO to £250 without any
lowering of rates. Also the
special tax on property in-
come is increased from 74
per cent, to 10 per cent, —
2s. in the £. Ordinary tax
on property income is
already 3s. 5-7 d. in the £
up to £6500. and ss. in the
£ on any , excess, in each case
with 8 per cent, added;
N.S.W. State tax on pro-
perty is 3s. (id. in the £ on
the first £5500. and ss. in
the £ on the excess; State
unemployment tax is Is. in
the £ (Slang wants to make
it 55.) ; Federal land tax
and municipal rates have to be paid
as well. And now Slang: is doubling his
child-endowment tax, hitherto £1 in the
£lOO of wages and salaries, and applying it
to industries regulated by Federal awards—
in effect making employers pay for myriads
of mythical children. It is not yet a crime
to own property and employ labor in N. S.
Wales, but possibly it soon will be.
The N. S. Wales deficit, after eight months
of Lang and three months of liis plan (i.e.,
bilking the public creditor and scabbing on
the other States), is now admitted to be
£8 939,400. Yet Slang hasn’t “restored
widows’ pensions” on the old scale, or “re-
moved the legislation by which civil-service
salaries w-ere reduced,” or “found the money
to complete all those incomplete works in
which many millions are lying idle,” or gone
in for “a vigorous policy of road construc-
tion which will absorb many thousands of
our unemployed,” all which things, and
many others besides, he promised in his
policy speech. “Labor offers a policy of
construction embracing sound economy and
prudent finance” —this was Slang’s closing-
assurance to his dupes. “On polling-day the
electors will vote for restored prosperity,
sound finance and happy homes.” And
so they did, or thought they did; and
now a deficit of nearly nine millions
has been planted on the State which
is being sued as a defaulter, which has
120,000 unemployed, and whose Savings Bank
has had the shutters up for three months.
Thank God we live under democrats like
Lang and Theodore instead of under Stuart
tyrants! Green notes that in 1626 British
freeholders said, “If they had but two kine
they would sell one of them for supply to
his Majesty—in a Parliamentary way.”
Their readiness to pay 10s. in the £ for an
elected Parliament was more impressive than
it may seem. Capitalists of those days were
taxed about 2s. 6d. in the £ on an average;
workers weren’t taxed at all. Under our
“Defence expenditure, cut heavily last year, is
to be hacked again from £3,896,800 to £3,085,200.
There are to be no camps, training is to be reduced,
and all the physical instructors are to be sacked.”
MINISTER CHILEY : “This is the ideal we’re
working up to, General. Perhaps he’ll
be our 1932-33 model”
glorious system N.S.W. manual workers are
paying in taxation, visible and otherwise,
not less than ss. in the £, and some capi-
talists are paying up to 17s. 6d. But look at
their recompense. The Legislative Assembly !
There is to be a by-election for one of
the Adelaide seats in the State Assembly,
the unhappy Edwards having at last
resigned; and one Collaton has nominated
against the Labor candidate as a supporter
of the Gang plan. Further, the “Labor Daily”
announces that members of the Beasley
group, all N.S.W. men, are to “take part in tin-
campaign.” The salaries of these worthies
go on while they thus neglect their duties —
never more important thau now—and pro-
ONE TREASURER TO ANOTHER:- “Here, let me have a
go at him!”
sumably they ride as deadheads. Then-
leader, Beasley, though a mere Assistant
Minister and a Sydney resident, drew £320
in expenses in a trifle over 16 months, so it
comes natural to the group to make the
public pay for the propagation of Gangism.
When Slang announced cheery Mr. Whid-
don as the State lottery director last month,
he said the little job would be done on the
cheap—“with a staff of a dozen or so.”
Last .-week a photograph showed the new
Mogul surrounded by a devoted staff of 130.
All who have studied the ways of depart-
mentalists recognise that this is but a faint
shadow of what the concern will become.
Inside a year 1300 should be having tea,
powdering their noses and giving impudence
to information-seeking gamblers at tin-
gamblers’ expense. Federation, which was
to have “cost no more than the price of a
dog license,” set the standard and pace.
The new census gives the population of
England and Wales as a little under
40,000,000, an increase of about 2,000,001
since 1921: and that of Scotland a;
4.800,000 —or some 80,000 less than it
was 10 years ago. The tally for Ireland,
now vaguely supposed to be the most pros
perous or least hard-up section of the
British Isles, isn’t to hand, but if the slow
decline in population has been arrested it
will be the first time for many a long decade,
On the records since censuses began. 130
years ago, it would seem that Ireland has
room for lots more people. It is hard to
realise that in the hungry forties of last
century its 8,000,000-odd represented half
the population of Great Britain and more
thau thrice that of the Scotland of the period.
The Government that wrecked the Savings
Bank has had the infernal cheek to depute
a select committee, headed by the bankrupt
Stuart-Robertson, to “inquire into the
methods of the private banks.” The
committee began taking evidence when.
the Savings Bank had been closed for
10 weeks, during which time not a
word of explanation or information had
been vouchsafed to the million depositors;
but it got no change out of the first two
witnesses examined. One was the manager
of a co-operative society of fruitgrowers at
Young, who angrily declared that, as a result
of relying on the Savings Bank and a Gov-
ernment guarantee, “120 of our growers have
not received a farthing for their crops.”
Another was the Government Statistician,
who said that 14.6 p.c. of N.S.W. unionists
were unemployed in the first quarter of 1930
and 25.8 p.c. after five months of Lang. The
committee then decided that it had heard
enough for a week or two.
In its last ordinary session Queensland
1 arLament passed _ an Act empowering the
Law Society to introduce a system of
fidelity guarantee against loss by misappro-
priation of clients’ money. The fund has
been opened, all practitioners contributing,
and the society is now financially responsible
for the honesty of the profession. Queens-
land is the first State to take action of the
kind.
The population of Italy forges ahead; the
census shows that the reinvigorated king-
dom, with over 42 million people, has out-
distanced France in the last few years and is
running neck-and-neck with Britain. It is
still a long way behind Germany (624
millions), and neither is within coo-ee of Rus”
sia, which is estimated to contain 147 mil-
lions or so. How many Italians there are in
America, particularly the Argentine, and
other parts of the World is difficult to com-
pute; the total must be formidable. But
Mussolini has put a brake on immi-
gration besides exhorting his compatriots
to keep their cradles full. There is some-
thing about Italian virility that suggests
the nation will play a far bigger part in the
history of the future than that which it
has filled for centuries- past.
Sydney's ex-Town Clerk, W. G. Layton,
who retired the other day on a handsome
pension and some equally handsome tributes-!
to his efficiency and tact from every aider-
man, broke the silence imposed upon him
for years by saying that Town Hall admin-
istration was rotten, and would continue
to be so until business men took a
public-spirited interest in civic life and
party politics were eliminated therefrom.
The testimony is valuable coming from
a man who has been behind the scenes
for so long, even if it contains nothing
that wasn’t perfectly well known, but it has
naturally stirred up a tempest of indig-
nation among the gentlemen who bade Lay-
ton farewell with such sadness and such a
wealth of testimony to his worth. A brick-
bat like this before the bouquets have hardly
had time to wither!
Queensland Parliament is about to be
asked to pass a Police Offences (Consort-
ing) Act like the one which has proved so
successful in breaking up criminal organisa-
tions in N.S.W. Moore’s State has been
invaded in some force by Ma State criminals
who have found Sydney too hot for them.
At the same time there does not seem much
danger of local development of gangs such
as have flourished so long in the Bridge City.
What a wonderful Federation this is ! A
paper with an Australian-wide circulation
may almost be said to take its life in its
hands every week. If, for instance, it were
to circulate in N. S. Wales information
regarding the Queensland Government’s
Golden Casket lottery, it would be liable to
fine and imprisonment. If it were to print
particulars of a N.S.W. charity art union,
of which the Government has approved, tin-
law of Vic. would fall upon it. It if were
to print particulars of the lottery with which
Lang hopes to relieve N.S.W. hospitals of
their distress, the law of S. Aus. would fall

upon it —or might: it has the right to,
anyway. Some day somebody with a few
thousands to burn will go to law and find
out whether the whole silly business is not
an unconstitutional obstacle to free inter-
state trading; meantime it gives a few un-
productive flies a chance to collect a salary,
buzz furiously and make a public nuisance
of themselves.
“Bildad”: The proposition of N.S.W. Gov-
ernor Game that the incurable haters in
politics should get together in a friendly
way and arrive at an arrangement led to
a squashy sound like an exploded caterpillar.
It was Lang putting his boot on the idea,
and it was a very good use to make of the
ungainly object. Rival political leaders have
come to a satisfactory compromise over a
single concrete question, or two parties have,
coalesced against a third one, or they have
joined hands and shared the loaves and
fishes until dissatisfied independents grew
into a party and beat the coalition. But
when several parties are divided over mat-
ters really worth while the fight must go on
to a finish. The difference between Lang
and Game is that Lang says Game must do
as Lang tells him, and Game says the
opposite. So his Ex. has a chance to prac-
tise his own theory by inventing a com-
promise that will be satisfactory to both
men and to their employers. Drab and color-
less people of no fixed principles can arrive
at an agreement over almost anything, but
the pacification thus arrived at isn’t worth
having.


SOCIETY
"And it's

WIMBLE'S INKS"
“J.D.”: Touching the abolition of the
terms “port” and “starboard” in favor of
“left” and “right.” On our way back from
the War in the old Beltana routine
guards were necessary, and this is how Sgt.
Bob McEwan explained the position: “Men

sundown. For the benefit of those who
do not understand the terms, I might say
that the port is the left side and the star-
board the right side of the sharp end of the
boat.”
* * * *
“U.S.A.”: Now that the N.S.W. Govern-
ment has withdrawn the proceedings against
“Art in Australia” it may be in order to
suggest why the sage of Springwood is often
in trouble. He resembles Clara Bow. who,
to quote Paramount’s production-director
Schulberg, “has been warned several times
that unfavorable publicity was jeopardising
her position,” and who, according to “N. Y.
World,” “is expected shortly to announce
the abandonment of her career.” As the
“It” boy of Aussie art, Lindsay has had
a great spin, but the well-advertised always
create critics - (most of whom have been dis-
appointed in blurb themselves), and when
the latter see a chance to use their knives
in the form of police informations, etc., they
jump at it. Miss Bow is no naughtier than
other Hollywoodites, and Mr. Lindsay is
more virtuous than most Sydneyites, by all
accounts, but no one will make the Holy
Joes believe it, or stop spitting maledictions
at their work—work which most, of the
holy ones have never seen. Miss Bow is
reported to be seeking admission to a nun-
nery. What salesmanship if Mr. Lindsay
decided to end it all as a Trappist!
* * * *
“Junius”: It is difficult to say wherein lies
the irresistible lure of Parliament for some
men. Westralia has had some quee>’
examples, notably a citizen
who had a seat in the first
Assembly under responsible
government nearly 40 years
ago, and who has never
missed an opportunity since
of trying to get back am
never succeeded. How many
elections he has contested no-
body knows —probably he him-
self has lost count long ago
—but the tally is certainly
well over a score, and his
hobby, even though accom-
panied by a thrifty habit of
always keeping down election
exes, to the minimum, must
liave cost him a small for-
tune. I recall another man
who got in only at his seventh
try. But a third, who served
a couple of terms in the years
after Federation, was in some
ways the most remarkable of
all. He was a storekeeper
who could neither read nor
write without difficulty, and
who was never more than a
butt for his fellow-members
and a vote in divisions. Yet
he spent 10 years trying to
get into Parliament and an-
other 10 trying to get back
there; to him it was the sum-
mit of all earthly ambitions. It wasn’t for
the social distinction, and he didn’t need the
money, but the craving lasted till death.

“E.M.L.”: At the boys’ school where I
exhaust my nervous energy, one young hope'
ful sought to excuse his non-performance of
homework with, “Please sir, I couldn't do
me ‘ekka.’ I went for a drive!” “A drive
at night-time?” said the mystified master.
“Surely you’re a bit young for joy-rides.”
“Yes, sir,” urged the suppliant, “I didn’t
get home till four o’clock this morning. Y’see,
I went round on the sanitree-cart.”

“Itoga” : A much older Digger than either
Duncan (“Dad”) Allan or Pte. H. J. Gibb
managed to get to England, though not to
the front. This was John
Marsden, a Queenslander in
the 42nd Battalion. Army
doctors bowled him out as
“too old for active service” ;
a London newspaper fea-
tured the case under the head-
ing : “Seventy-three-year-old
Soldier Unmasked.” Mars-
den closed his tailoring busi-
ness in Brisbane to join up
at 72; he was a great-grand-
father when he was passed as fit, after
having dyed his hair and given his age as
44. But for that final examination he would
certainly have reached Flanders.

“Strand”: Judging by a recent cable Aus-
tralia House has suffered the fate of medie-
val. Venice. The transport experts, by
introducing one-way traffic westward from
Fleet-street and eastward from Charing
Cross, have isolated the Queen of the Strand
as effectively as Vasco da Gama isolated the
Queen of the Adriatic when he discovered
a sea route to India. Australia House was
worth every penny of the £1,000,000 it has
been valued at when the ’buses travelling
east discharged and took up passengers at
its southern entrance. The arrangement
meant a permanent crowd for its chief shop
windows. Under the new system both east-
and west-bound traffic leaves it away to the
right, with the result that its value for shop
and office purposes is decreased by at least
50 per cent. Some idea of its plight may
be gathered here by imagining what would

Hughes, say, had been High Commissioner,
he would probably have got wind of the
pending death-stroke, and forced the autho-
rities to withhold it by sheer pertinacity and
‘offensiveness. Miracles can be worked with
the qualities for which Mr. Hughes is famous
in suave old London.

“Inner Temple” : The Bishop of Salisbury
(Dr. Donaldson, who used to be Archbishop
of Brisbane) startled the Canterbury Con-
vention with this: —
It is impossible for the Church publicly to dis-
tinguish between the innocent and the guilty, as a
large part of the blame sometimes rests not on the
adulterous partner but'on the partner whose conduct
was the real cause of the other’s sin.
A lawyer would have said, not “sometimes,
but “in 50 per cent, of cases.” Here are
some examples taken from life: —
Moneyed wife goes abroad (the odds are two to
one against - a permanent marriage when the wife
has money) and stays there. Gregarious husband
acquires lady friend and is caught by wife’s agents.
Frivolous wife forms infatuation after she and
work-crazy husband have drifted apart. Husband
agrees to be caught for sake of children. (“No
one minds that kind of thing in a man.”)
Husband and wife get sick of each other. He
agrees to be caught, as she won’t.
Collusion presents certain difficulties in
England where “hotel evidence” is required.

theless, 'whereas only 577 divorce decrees
were granted in Britain in 1913, the figures
for last year were just on 5000. The .Judi-
cial Proceedings Act (1926), by which full
reports of divorces were banned, is chiefly
responsible. About half these cases were
probably collusive. In Australia, where
desertion is a ground, not less than 90 per
cent, are collusive.

“P.X.”: One Laborite was called to the
N.S.W. Leg. Council so long ago that the
Sydney papers, in making up tlieir lists the
other day, forgot that he was brought in
as true-blue Labor —and, indeed, may be
still. Forty years ago Nicholas Buzacott
was a young journeyman wheelwright at
Broken Hill, in the days when Labor had
no official newspaper there. Nicky and two
or three others undertook to keep a weekly
going with free contributions; so “Barrier
Truth” was born: later professional editors
were Bob Ross (now of Melbourne) and
George Black, M.L.C. (Sydney). When the
first Labor party was asked to nominate
a few M’s.L.C. militant Broken Hill had to
have a representative; and Nicky Buza-
cott was rewarded for his honorary services
to “Barrier Truth.” Thirty-five years later
Dickson, present head of “Truth,” was also
called to the Council; and now, as a rule,
Buzacott and Dickson, the old and the
young, nicely cancel one another.

“T.S.M.”: “Colonel Slick” (B. l/7/’3D
has been mixing his bridges. Sydney’s arch
has never had a look in against suspension
bridges. The 1675 ft. span of the Kill van
Kull bridge near New York beats Sydney
by 25ft.; with approaches it is 8275 ft. long.
San Francisco is busy preparing for a sus-
pension span of 4200 ft. Finally, if you want
a high dive, the roadway over the Arkansas
River at Royal George gives you a drop
of 1260 ft.

“Spare Corp”: Further to the subject of
voluminous official reports (B. 8/7/’3l),
when the cold first started to nip my feet
in France I tore some flannel into strips,
soaked them in oil and wrapped them round
the affected members, with satisfactory re-
sults even when the snow was deep on the
ground. My discovery so much impressed
an officer that lie induced me to put the
idea on paper. My specific, with his en-
dorsement, was pushed on to the C. 0., who
pushed it on further. Meanwhile, m the
line defects in the scheme became apparent;
the oiled strips of flannel curled up anti
hardened, becoming worse .than useless, i
had almost forgotten my ill-success as an
inventor until, handling war records m ijon-
don in 1919, I came across a file —a pon-
derous tome of reports and recommendations
—of which my initial statement was Page 1.
From a glance through I formed the impres-
sion that effective provision might have been
made to keep the troops’ feet warm if the
war had lasted another five years.

“Centurion”: Major-General Bruclic. of
the C.M.F., mentioned during a lecture that
he had seen banners of German troops who
had taken part in the defence of Gibraltar
hung up in the local cathedral. These were the
Hanoverian levies, which afterwards, under
Kemp, earned undying fame in the Penin-
sular wars and at Waterloo. They were the
first British troops armed with rifles, and
were usually employed as an advanced screen
in opening or opposing attacks. At Water-
loo they were with the Guards in the immor-
tal defence of Hougoumont, and wore the
basis of what afterwards became the Rifle
Brigade. Their weapon was a heavy, short-
barrelled muzzle-loading rifle with a round
ball. This had to be wrapped in a piece
of greased felt known as the “patch” and
hammered down through the grooving by a
wooden mallet banging on the iron ramrod.
A contrast to the Lee-Metford breech-loader
which their successors used with such effect
at Mons, only a few miles from Waterloo,
90 years later.
* * * *
“Isharagi”: The Victorian railway brass-
hat who overheard the operator’s message to
the next station that he was on his rounds
(B. S/7/’3l) may have been an excellent
sound-reader, but such proficiency wouldn’t
be gained by being “Sparks” on a troop-
ship. The buzz of wireless, which is inter-
preted into dots and dashes by the length ot
sound, is quite distinct from the click of
the land-line sounder, which records its dots
and dashes by the periods of silence between
clicks. A buzzer reader is not well trained
for the sounder, and generally takes some
time to adapt himself to the different class
of signal.

“ Jeames”: According to Sydney “Tele-
graph” :
In the N. S. Wales golf championship Jim Fernet
hooked a short iron shot. A prominent member cf
the judiciary who was following the match said:
“The boy is over-swinging. I’ll go and tell him so’’ ;
and he insisted on doing so, in spite of his friend’s
remonstrance.
“What does it matter?” inquired Ferrier,
and proved it didn’t matter by winning the
championship. Lord Russell, of Ivillowen,
behaved like the Sydney judge at a bridge-
table when the game was in its infancy, and
the recipient of his unsought advice, a
cocksure young Guardsman, wasn’t so civil
as Ferrier. “Shut up.” he said curtly.
“You’re not in your dashed old police court
now.” He went on to demonstrate that the
L.-C. Justice of England didn’t know what
he was talking about by taking the game and
rubber.

“T. Essbie” : More local color. A story in
the “British Weekly” (1/1/’3l) tells of a
landowner in Central Queensland who divided
bis time between “riding to the sheep ’ and
“attending to the sugar-canes”—on the same
“farm.”

“Addis Ababa”: The Emperor of Abys-
sinia, an enlightened monarch who runs a
newspaper and writes his own leading articles,
attributes his country’s troubles to “drink-
shops, cafes and dancing partners, which
sap the virility of his young men and cause
them to barter their arms for dissipation.
The complaint is about as old as the world.
Juvenal put “alea” (dice) in front of the
“vina, Venus” that had reduced so many
young Roman patricians of his time to indi-
gence The Emperor is content to follow
Frangois Villon with his “ Tout aux tavcrncs
et aux fillcs,” and Ortheris who “lost his
tip on the bloomin’ trip along of the women

escaped the enervating influences of two-up
and the ponies.
RIVAL CLAIMANTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There were 700 applicants for the position of
mounted constable in the Northern Territory. One,
who admitted having no experience in such work,
pointed out that his grandfather was a policeman;
another mentioned that he was engaged to a police-
man’s sister.”
They yearn on prancing steeds to ride
As champions of law and order
Throughout the region wild and wide
Between Westralia’s starboard side
And Queensland’s occidental border.
Each deems he holds the sort of hand
To render his selection proper;
One’s grand-dad was a bobby, and
The other has expressly planned
To wed the sister of a copper.
’Tis in their blood, or nearly so,
The apprehension of offenders,
From crooks that on the warpath go
In alleys dim when lights are low
To fractious drunks on noisy benders.
Their kin have grappled city prigs
And they aspire to ring the changes
By queering cattle-duffers’ jigs
And hunting contumacious nigs
About the far Macdonnell Manges.
One’s grandsire bold his whistle blew
To set the larrikins a-scatter
Around The Rocks or in the ’Loo,
Whichever was their rendezvous —
It obviously doesn’t matter.
And if the other may not bring
Ancestral claims whereon to linger,
Surely he did his bit to swing
The job that day he slipped a ring
Upon a peeler’s sister’s finger.
Johns of the wild these twain would be.
Whose deeds may furnish many a thriller,
Upon a beat that stretches free
Right from the Arafura Sea
To Alice Springs and Chambers Pillar.
Which has the pull I can’t decide —
In puzzles it remains a topper—
The candidate whose destined bride
Is to the force so near allied
Or he whose grand-dad teas a copper?

“Taltingan”: It has been years since
Neddy the horse has had such a good opinion
of himself. Year by year he saw the motor-
car and -truck get more dependable; year
by year he saw the roads changed to suit
the rival. Now for the past three months
he has found himself called to lift the rival
out of its troubles, said troubles’ other name
being Mud. A police inspector going home
across the dreary, droughty plains between
Condobolin and Broken Hill looked out in
the moonlight upon water as far as the eye
could reach, and still half-asleep fell back
on his pillow fully believing that he was at
sea. In the morning he woke with a start
to find himself in a train and not a steamer.
Between Broken Hill and Tibooburra, where
most times you can die of thirst, a mail
lately ran eight days late: twice the mail-
car had to be abandoned and horses rounded
up. And a couple of stockbuyers, making a
round trip from Wilcannia up the Paroo,
had to fall back three times on the camel, in
a flooded country too dry as a rule even for
the horse. Where there isn’t water out there
at present there’s grass—and no money to
buy anything to eat it.

“Clerk”: The Benalla (Vic.) Bench
scratched its hgad over a queer assault
case the other day. The plaintiff, a prospec-
tor of 65, told aggrievedly how he had
approached a local farmer, who was potter-
ing around at night-time in his cowyard,
to “buy some bread.” The response was a
punch on the jaw, occasioning hos-
pital treatment for three weeks. The de-
fendant declared that in the dark he had
mistaken his visitor for a Communist or
something equally disreputable. He had, he
continued, glimpsed what he thought to be
a revolver si' ’cing out of the stranger's

“Yes, I found him a bit of a cold fish, too.”
pocket, had warned him hoarsely to stand
back (presumably at the same time as the
other chattily introduced the subject of bread
purchase), and had then decided to “hit
first.” Which he did, subsequently discover-
ing that the suspected revolver was a pipe.
The two Jay Peas, after some fruitless dis-
cussion. adjourned the case.
“T. Ingoldsby” : Periodically some schoolboy
gets what are termed “the cuts” laid on a
trifle harder than his parents reckon strictly
judicial, and the upshot is a police-court
case. The latest occurred in the Speck, where
a doctor was called to depose to the injuries
inflicted on an obstreperous 10-year-old.
The witness opined that some violence had
been used; he admitted, in cross-examination,
that some persons “bruised very easily,”
but pointed out that in this case the distinct-
ness of the marks, days afterwards, took the
force out of this explanation. Which recalls
that when “Stalky and Co.” were comparing
cutaneous damages after being severally
dealt with by their headmaster they found
that their respective stripes differed in no
respect, and all showed “a certain clarity of
outline that stamps the artist.” Apparently
the same clarity was perceptible in the Speck
case, although the artist there was a school-
marm.
“Viau”: What does it matter if the horses
to be commemorated in the Melbourne War
Memorial were “conscripts”? A drinking-
trough and fountain, erected at Barstaw, in
Surrey, to the memory of 400,000 horses
killed and wounded in the South African
War is inscribed, “In a cause of which they
knew nothing.” That phrase seems to make
their service all the more worthy of com-
memoration.
“Retired Gun”: It is an axiom with those
who live by knavery that the surest way
to make a mug bite is to impress him with
the idea that he is tak-
ing an illegal advantage
of someone or some-
thing. Brisbane had an
instance of this when a
number of bargain-
hunters succumbed to
the blandishments of a
furtive individual who
sold them rol’- of
tailors’ suitings at
prices that seemed ridi-
culously low, seeing
that the cloth was
stamped as super-
quality English. Dis-
covering that it was
not, the purchasers set
the law in motion, and
the offender was duly
lagged. Then came
shock No. 2. The Cus-
toms Act lays down,
that all goods sold
under pretence that
they are smuggled—and
that was the salesman’s
explanation in this instance —shall be for-
feited. As a result the bargain-hunters lost,
not only the money paid, but the goods paid
for.

‘■Whitehall”; The April census shows the
population of London to be more than
8,000.000. New York, which had 6 930.446
in 1930, is London’s only rival, but it can’t
catch up, being on an island and only able
to bloat in an upward direction. The Chan-
nel is the sole obstacle to London’s progress
east and south, and, though it is a long way
off, the gaps arc being filled. You can travel
for 16 miles from the heart of the city to
Coulsdon, on the road to Brighton, and see
nothing hut suburban houses, which means
that Brighton will eventually be a suburb
of the metropolis in fact as well as name.
And the same to the north and west. Already
the population of the city and outer suburbs
is over 12,000,000, or two and a half times
that of all Scotland.

“Point Puer” : A novel method of punish-
ment for juvenile delinquents is reported
from Armidale (N.S.W.), where, half a
dozen youths, convicted of petty thefts from
storekeepers, were released on condition that
they “attended church every Sunday, never
left their homes at night except with their
parents, and kept away from picture shows.”
The first reformative agency, of course, is
merely an old one revived, dating from the
days of white sheets and penitential tapers,
when the offender was held up to the eye of
the whole community in his rdle of chastened
sinner. The final embargo suggests that pic-
ture-show proprietors may yet find them-
selves in the position of publicans who in
some Australian States are still seiwed with
prohibition orders. There is nothing to pre-
vent the errant youths from browsing on
Deadwood Dick literature before or after
church; nevertheless the results of this latest
development in penology may have some
interest —if they are ever ascertainable.
“Mells” : A philanthropist has bequeathed a
sum of money to provide an annual prize
for proficiency in pronunciation of English
at one of Sydney’s great public schools. A
laudable idea, no doubt; but who is to
decide what is right pronunciation? In
hundreds of cases the very dictionaries are
non-committal, and the highest authorities
seldom unanimous. In the end it will be
found that overwhelming common usage too
often over-rides all academic rules. Does
one Englishman in a thousand nowadays
pronounce the word “allies” as his grand-
father did in the days of the Crimea? When
Pope wrote “Here, thou, great Anna, whom
three realms obey, Doth sometimes counsel
take and sometimes tea,” was “obey” pro-
nounced “obee,” or “tea” “tay”? What

is correct pronunciation and what isn’t is
generally settled by the will of the majority
—the educated majority anyhow—with
scant regard for the canons. Incidentally,
pronunciation is distinctly influenced by cli-
mate, and it will go' on changing until Eng-
lish is a dead language—and probably after.

“S.T.S.”: Nadda for culture! It is a
very ’wayback spot in S.A., but its institute
library reports that, having to accept wheat
for subscriptions because of bad times, “the
response to the appeal exceeded all expecta-
tions —90 bags were received, practically
every farmer in the district contributing.”
“Lay By” : Of course it had to come. The
lodge doctor has long made time-payment
corpses a commonplace, and time-payment
funerals have followed as the night the day;
and now the Presbyterian Hospital at
Chicago has made the time-payment baby
possible. Prospective parents make the
usual preliminary deposit adapted to the
scale of treatment required, and the balance
is paid off by weekly instalments. There is
no mention of what happens if payments
cannot be kept up, but there is a cheering
intimation of the fact that there will be no
extra charge for twins.

“A. Jack”: Touching the death of a Bris-
bane fitter in a bathtub when he had a
naked electric wire in his hand (B.
24/6/’3l), a fatality from an even simpler
cause occurred at South Broken Hill a week
or so ago. A lad of 16 was playing football
with his cobbers when the ball struck and
broke a high-tension wire, which fell on him.
There was sodden ground underneath, and
the impact of 2400 volts burned him so
badly that he would have died even if the
shock had not killed him.
“Metax”: “R. Volt” (B. 24/6/’3l) is not
quite accurate in quoting a case of simple
electrolysis as an indication that water is
an excellent conductor of electricity. Actu-
ally, the water must be adulterated, usually
with an acid or an alkali, because in itself
water is a poor conductor. Mellor goes a
little further in “Modern Inorganic Chemis-
try” by stating that “pure water is said to
be a non-conductor of electricity.” Never-
theless most ordinary water contains suffi-
cient impurities in solution to render it
more or less conductive.
“J.S.P.”: Almost coincidently with the
news of Prof. Picard’s altitude record (B.
17/6/’3l), the “National Geographic Maga-
zine” publishes details of marine investiga-
tion at hitherto-unheard-of depths. The
descents were made by Beebe and Barton
in a steel sphere weighing two tons, lowered
by a steam winch, the explorers keeping in
telephonic communication with their ship.
The greatest depth reached was 1400 feet.
Some of the most eurioys physical data
recorded were those with regard to the spec-
trum. When only 50 feet down red looked
black, and at 450 feet the spectrum con-
sisted almost wholly of violet. What
impressed the observers most was the “un-
earthly” color seen at depths below this,
“the deepest, blackest blue imaginable.”

“Jack Point”: The yarn about Diggers
swapping tunics to get a drink at the only
battalion canteen at Tel-el-Kebir reminds
me of a similar experience in New York.
Going over rather late in the piece via
Panama Canal, we were a week waiting
there for a convoy, and were allowed plenty
of shore leave. Uncle had not then gone
dry, but there was a prohibition against
serving liquor to his own troops; hence a
party of Diggers and Doughboys could fre-
quently be seen exchanging tunics for an
obvious purpose. The Yanks were pretty
well cashed up, and many a thirsty Digger
profited thereby. The contrast when return-
ing the same way a couple of years later
was mournful—the Pussyfoots had had
their way in the interim and the boot-
leggers hadn’t had time to get properly into
their stride. It took more than an Aus-
tralian tunic to work the oracle then.

“Quilp”: An American who had dissi-
pated a fortune and was further depressed
by the death of a friend devised an unusual
but not altogether unknown method of
suicide at Nice by sinking a quart-bottle of
brandy at one draught. There are probably
few men, if any, who would survive such an
experiment in these degenerate days, although
Person (1759-1808) might have managed it;
some stories almost as unbelievable are told
about that Greek scholar's capacity for
strong waters. There was a celebrity (of
a sort) on the Westralian goldfields 30
years ago who was credited with the feat of
swallowing a bottle of neat whisky at a
draught, but that was only an Imperial pint.
By way of Bacchanalian variations he would
bite a mouthful out of a glass after finishing
its contents, an accomplishment that made
him unpopular with publicans.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: Rhodes's dream of an African
Transcontinental has been forestalled b
line from Angola in Portuguese West A
to the seaboard of what was once Ge
East Africa. After functioning with the
gian Congo railways, it was complete
linking up with the Northern Rhodesiar
British East African systems at Kilir
the distance as the crow flies being s
2000 miles. It was formally opened on
July 2, the anniversary of the founding of
the Congo Free State.
* * *
“Nakhoda”: The terrors of the press-
gang were very real much later than the
time of “Smollett” (B. 17/6/’3l). When
Ross, subsequently Governor of (Cocos,
visited London to make arrangements for
occupying the atoll, he only escaped its
attentions by bursting open the door of a
house and introducing himself to a parlorful
of perfect strangers. One of the young-
ladies of the family made more than a
momentary impression on him, and he re-
turned later and asked her father for her
hand in marriage. Their descendants mar-
ried Malay women and still rule the islands
where the Emden met her destiny.
“Shep” : The impression of the size of the
Navy’s swallow (B. 17/6/’3l) has doubt-
less been largely fostered by the lesser ranks,
whose perpetual moan is that, regardless of
length of service, good conduct or anything
else, strictest prohibition is enforced on
them, whilst the youngest officer aboard is
entitled to quaff his toasts in the ward-roofh
with the rest. Democratic we love to style
ourselves, arguing over the size of officers’
wine bills, and yet if a thirsty tar openly
hauls aboard a lifesaver for the morning-
after it’s a serious crime, punishable by
clink. There might have been reason, for
this in Nelson’s time, but if military bar-
racks can decently run a wet canteen, I
can’t fathom why no one below the rank of
warrant officer aboard a warship is expected
to have a thirst.
* * * Sit
“Cap’n Reece” : When the Americans came
into the war and needed officers to increase the
naval and mercantile personnel, they trained
them in large batches on dry land, and
after a short and intensive course sent them
to sea to pick up the practical side of navi-
gation. Russia seems to be working on the
same lines, for the cables tell us that a
comrade of 36 who has just been appointed
C in C. of the Russian Navy graduated
from the naval school just four years ago,
having previously been a railway porter.
It may turn out all right. There is no
reason why a railway porter should not
make an admirable admiral." Writer lias
known admirals who would certainly have
fitted in all right as railway porters.
v * * *
“Thermos”: Householders who say hard
things of the gas companies when the
monthly account comes in are perhaps not
aware that there is necessarily a greate'-
consumption of the commodity in winter
than in summer. Our meter-reader, chal-
lenged by my wife, explained the 50 per cent,
increase in the June account by the simple
statement that in winter the water was
colder and more gas was called for in the
process of cooking. Argument was still in
progress when I left home.

Westralian Agent-General Billy Angwm,
who took tlic chair the other day at a welcome-
home to ex-Govefcnor Campion, is the only
Laborite who has landed the job during the
State’s three Labor Administrations. Xhc
first of these was so stuck for a mail that
it induced the Premier whom it had just
displaced (Walter .Tames) to accept the
billet, and the second, having no eligible
about the premises, generously, extended the
term of another erstwhile political opponent,
Newton Moore. But when Labor found it-
self once more in power with a vacancy to
fill, Angwin got his reward for 20 years of
Parliamentary service and a return to. his
homeland at the same time. He is a cautious
and well-balanced Cousin Jack, who knows
England quite as well as he knows Aiis-
tralia. if not better, for he took root m the
first port, Fremantle, on his arrival in this
country and never moved from it.
One who lived in a very much higher
intellectual stratum than most of us are
forced to inhabit, and who has now left the
world of matter, was Alexander McAulay,
research professor of mathematics at Tas.
Uni. until two years ago, when he went blind.
It has been said there were only five men in
the world at the time Einstein launched his
theory of relativity who could check the
mathematical proofs of it. Prof. McAulay
was one. of them, and wrote a treatise on
the subject. His principal claim to endur-
ing fame lies in his discoveries in connection
with quaternions, especially in their appli-
cation to physics. In this- field he devised
a new mathematical tool comparable in use-
fulness to the calculus; it is given to the
world in the latest issue of the “Encyclo-
paedia Britannica.” McAulay was also one
of those who explored the strange region
that cannot be measured by the three dimen-
sions. to the geometry of which his “Prob-
lems of Non-Euclidean Space” is an im-
portant contribution. Outside the domain
of pure mathematics he interested himself in
electro-magnetic research, and took a prac-
tical and useful interest in tlic development
of hydro-electric power in the island of his
adoption. An Englishman by birth, and a'
graduate of Cambridge, he commenced his
teaching career at Melbourne Uni., joining
the Tas. Uni. at its inception in 1893. His
son is physics prof, at Hobart. The elder
Prof. McAulay died at 68.
Prof. B. W. Chapman, who has been
awarded the Melb. ’Varsity’s Ivernot
Memorial Medal for “distinguished engineer-
ing achievement in Australia,” was a Mel-
bourne boy who went through Wesley Col-
lege, crossed over to Adelaide 41 years ago
and has been connected with the Uni. there
ever since, first as lecturer, later for 24

George Barber,
who last week
celebrated the
30th anniver-
sa r y of his
election to the
Queens land
Assembly, has
held his seat
for a longer
unbroken period
than any other
member. He
has contested
13 elections, and as party secretary has
served under 10 Labor Premiers. Bun-
daberg put him in the Assembly and
has kept him there. A Lowestoft laddie,
he began his working life as a fisher-
man apprentice on the Dogger Bank,
and later served before the mast on many
seas. For some years after leaving the sea
he was an officer in the Salvation Army.
He turned to politics when a worker in the
Millaquin sugar-refinery.
Probably the oldest Methodist minister in
Australia was Enoch Gratton, 93 at the end,
in Adelaide. lie worked in England with
Booth before the Salv’army was thought of;
since 1883 he had been in South Aus. Much
of his clerical toil was done among the deaf
and dumb, and he kept it up till the finish.
Edward Parnell Kinsella, who proposed
the N. S. Wales Leg. Assembly resolu-
tion that the Governor must act on
the advice of his Ministers, is a serious
young politician with a debating-society
manner. Born at Glen Innes, he entered
the Lands Department a trifle over 20
years ago, enlisted in the 2nd Battalion,
A.1.F., in 1914, served through the Gal-
lipoli campaign and later gained a commis-
sion on his transfer to the 54th Battalion.
After the war he went back to the Lands
Department, and was in the securities
section of the Digger Settlement branch.
He found time to study law at Sydney Uni-
versity, was admitted as a barrister in
KINSELLA, ML.A., Lang’s latest
champion.
1927, and became M.L.A. for George’s River
—one of the new electorates—last October.
James Bennetts, Sydney’s efficient Super-
intendent of Traffic, can look back to the
days when 25 traffic cops were considered
enough for the place. His first job when he
joined the branch was to determine the
safety of all public vehicles, largely hansom
cabs and omnibuses, and it came easy to one
who had served his time as a coachbuilder.
Born at Peak Downs (Q.j in 1873, Ben-
netts entered the force in 1897, was broken
into police work in the ’Loo and at Rand-
wick, and shifted to the traffic branch, then
a new thing, in 1900. Registration of
motor vehicles, licensing of motor-drivers
and such matters have been handed over
to the Transport Trust, but the duty of con-
trolling traffic on the streets still remains a'
police function,
Lieut.-General John William Parnell, who
died in Melbourne last week at 71, was
champion athlete of Wesley College in his
youth, and a double blue at Melbourne Uni.
Most of his life was spent in military and
engineering service, instructional and admin-
istrative. He was successively Commandant
in Tasmania, Queensland and Victoria in
the pre-war years, and during the war he
occupied a similar position at Duntroon.
He was Administrator of Norfolk Island
from 1920 to 1924, when he resigned through
ill-health.
John V. Tillett, N. S. Wales Crown
Solicitor, who died last week after a long
illness, was the perfect public servant. His
family circle may have known what liis poli-
tical views were; no outsiders did. He served
each Government as it arrived with the
same whole-souled devotion, and his vast
knowledge, general as well as legal, and skill
in applying it never failed to stagger his
mostly bone-headed masters. A more modest
man never lived, and that surprised the poli-
ticians, too. Tillett had a number of hobbies.
As clever with his hands as Norman
Lindsay or the late “Hop,” he created
a number of wooden objects, including a
couple of rowing-boats. He had read widely,
had great social charm, and was a wit.
But few saw much of him outside his family
and the Crown Law Office where he had
worked since he joined the public service
35 years ago. He was born at Liverpool
(N.S.W.), and had lived there most of his
63 years.
Passed out, at 81, the widow of Richard
Seddon. Maoriland’s notable Premier of
nearly a generation ago. Mrs. Seddon, who
outlived her husband by 25 years,. # was Vic
torian-born, the daughter of Captain Stuait
Spotswood, of Williamstowu.
“Inner Temple”: Wilfrid Barton, K.C.,
is the only Australian who will figure m
the pending appeal of the N.S.W. Bovern-
ment to the Privy Council. He is aPPeai-
ing for the Legislative Council, and will
have Sir John Simon, K.C., whose
he has often been, against him. Barton, who
has only recently taken silk, is one of the
late “Toby’s” brilliant sons: another, E.A.,
is at the N.S.W. Bar. Wilfrid Barton was
a scholar and a Rugby blue at Hxfoid, ana
earned a crust on one of the Northclifto
tabloids while fighting for a place at the
crowded London Bar. He specialises in
Privy Council work, has chambers opposite
the famous Inner Temple Chapel, and has
been tipped as a future K.B.D. Judge.
Harold Saltmarshe, recently dead in
Queensland, was for many years a well-
known figure in the State, to winch
hq came from his native Yorkshire _ m
the late ’eighties. After some cattle-station
experiences he was attracted to Westralia by
the gold discoveries of the ’nineties, returning
to try his hand at a gold-sluicing proposition
on the Russell River, in N.Q. Farming in
Southern Queensland next occupied him, and
finally he settled at Southport to spend the
rest of his days. An old Charterhouse boy,
he once played a good game of cricket, and
as the years went on underwent the
cricketer’s usual conversion to golf.
Aaron Hoskin, who has been named chair-
man of the Queensland Wheat Board, has had
many years’ experience of farming and graz-
ing in western Queensland; he first joined
the board some three years ago as the repre-
sentative of the Maranoa division. He has
travelled extensively. His wanderings took
him into Asia Minor and Egypt with
archaeological exploration parties under
Sir Flinders Petrie; he was at Kar-
mish at the same time as Lawrence, who later
gained fame in the Hedjaz, and was with the
Germans working at Babylon before the
war.
Edward Fancourt Mitchell, Iv.C., has com-
pleted 50 years as barrister, though he wasn’t
“called” till 26. After a brilliant career at
Cambridge (M.A., LL.B.) lie joined the
Inner Temple, and later became a member of
the Victorian and N.S.W. Bars. He is one of
the most esteemed members of his profession
in Australia and a very high constitutional
authority. H'e has never gone in for politics,
though his father was President of the Vic.
Legislative Council, but he has done price-
less work for the public during the past 30
years in the form of addresses and news-
paper articles on the Federal Constitution in
times of crisis. His most debated opinion
was one given originally to a conference of
farmers’ unions in Melbourne shortly after
the war—that any such amendment of the
Constitution as the initiative and referen-
dum, or unification, would require an
EDWARD MITCHELL, K.C.
affirmative majority in all the States and
an Imperial Act. No lawyer disputes it
now. Mitchell is a zealous churchman, the
father of four daughters, and a golfer.
With a possible Federal election looming,
the eagles are gathering. Wentworth
(N.S.W.) in particular is attracting a num-
ber of aspirants; one of them is Dr. Purdy,
Sydney’s city health officer. The doctor,
who won to colonel’s rank and a D.S.O.
during the Boer War and the Big Upheaval,
is an international authority on sanitation,
and has held many important appointments.
If elected he would go far to fill the gap
left in the Reps, by the death of Neville
Howse.

civil action Queensland Government v.

Mordaunt Finuey, manager of the Aus-
tralian Bank of Commerce. Melbourne, who
died suddenly last Thursday, began banking
when a lad of 14 at Mooroopna, near Shep-
parton, where he entered the Commercial.
He rose to be its chief officer in Queensland,
and when the Australian Bank of Commerce
was formed from the old Joint Stock Bank
ho was made manager in Sydney. He came
to Vic. in 1916 to take charge of the Mel-
bourne branch.
The N.S.W. Leg. Council lost a member
in James Edward Hoad, who died last week
at 73; 15 months ago he was knocked down
by a motor-car in Macquaric-street and'the
accident had lasting effects. He was born
at Tumut and most of his life was spent at
Junee, which one of his sons, Kenneth Hoad,
now represents in the Assembly. For years
he was a power in the A.W.U., and he was
appointed M.L.C. in 1925.
Had an 86th birthday in Adelaide, and
still going strong, Canon Slaney Poole, who
came from Kent and Cambridge to S.A. in
1867, and has been there as padre and Uni-
versity lecturer ever since, except for a few
years as rector of St. Peter's at Ballarat.
The late Judge Poole was his son.
One of the Ma State’s oldest solicitors was
Nathaniel Emanuel, who died at Neutral
Bay last week. He was born in Goulburn
in 1846 and admitted in 1870 ; he practised
in Tumut, where he also filled many public
offices until his retirement in 1916. His
father, Samuel Emanuel, was an M.L.A. in
the ’sixties; the son nearly became one—he
stood twice for Parliament and was beaten
on the second occasion by only eight votes.
Mt. Isa will have ‘a solid backing of
Broken Hill men to help solve its problems.
W. A. V. Piper, who went through his
School of Mines course with E. T. Hender-
son and worked with him through the long
battle with zinc at the Proprietary, is alread.v
there, and so is Alan McAskill. who will find
the building of new plant much easier than
devising means of keeping the Junction
North outfit in good going order. B. B.
Oliver is the latest to go to the. Isa metal-
lurgical staff. He was too young to have a
hand in zinc extraction, and war service
held him back a bit, but he is a likely young
man. In Broken Hill he will be missed
most by the local branch of the Returned
Soldiers’ League, of which he has been presi-
dent.
“Jeames”: The famous printing firm of
Sir William Waterlow, who has just died,
was responsible for the speediest bit of note-
inflation in English history. In December.
1914, it printed at Watford and delivered
to the Bank of England £15.000,000 worth
of Treasury notes in just on four days. Few
Britons have seen a gold £ or 10s. piece
since. Last year a crook tricked Waterlow
and Sons into. printing a parcel of bogus
Continental notes. It cost the firm over a
million sterling, and broke, Waterlow’s heart.
He was a solicitor but never practised.
Colonel Walter Scriven, who answered the
last roll-call in Adelaide recently, at 75,
came to South Australia from London in
1877, and the tannery business occupied him
for the rest of his life. He began soldiering
at 14 with the City of London Cadet Corps,
and joined up with the S. Aus. forces in
due course, mostly with the Garrison Artil-
lery. In the Boer War he commanded the
sth S.A. contingent.

Low prices for our staples came close
on the heels of drought in central
and far-west Queensland, where this
Rockhampton merchandising and agency
concern has strong connections. Hence last
year’s sharp contraction in turnover was
aggravated by a heavier crop of bad debts;
the fall in exes, lagged behind the drop
in merchandise values, and the extra
loading for taxes pressed heavily on the
attenuated earnings, and promises to press
heavier still.
The slip. in the year’s gross profits was
£32,197: —

Exes., including bad debts, were £9589
lighter, leaving a net shrinkage of £22,608.
Thus, after openly striking off £1502 for
depreciation, shown as written off in the
table, the final figure was 6.4 p.c. on capital
as against 14.8, 17, 13.1, 19.3 and 20.2 p.c.
back to 1926.
But the board has long prepared for such
times as the present; the internal reserve
for doubtful debts is still intact, and suffi-
cient to meet every contingency, the chair-
man says. So only the bonus (2J p.c.) was
dropped,' leaving the div. at 10 p.c.; thus
shareholders were rightly treated to a little
of the fat accumulated in the rich years:
and after that reserves were £6710 in excess
of capital at May 31.
The year’s duller trading released more
working capital, which was invested outside
the business :

The holding in Commonwealth and State
loans was increased by £50,000, raising it
to £200,000, and £20,723 was added to pro-
perties and other investments (£114,291).
Though the cash balance is substantial, an
early trade recovery may mean inconvenient
realisation of some of the Government secu-
rities in order to carry larger stocks and
book debts.
It is doubtful whether the 10 p.c. div. will
be maintained. However, owing to the fall
in the cost of living 9 p.c. is now worth as
much as 10 p.c. was two years ago in Rock-
hampton. The market prices the pound shares
at 30s. Allowing for the final div., the return
at that figure is 6.9 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div.
basis, or 5.5 p.c. on an 8 p.c. distribution.
The backing is 445. 6d. in net tangibles.

It lias been a tough struggle from the start,
10 years ago, when an accumulation of im-
ported stocks broke down the market, just
as the Auckland plant was ready. Also
domestic affairs in tlie industry were un-
satisfactory, and continued so until about
three years ago, when differences were
patched up. The board, however, never lost
its faith in the future of the industry, and,
with much help from the hank, bought a
freezing works at New Plymouth in 1924
and installed another super, plant there.
During the next half-dozen years steady
growth in turnover necessitated additions to
both works, a run of divs. averaging 6.3 p.c.
were paid, and the original deficit of £50,041
had been transformed into reserves of
£33,007 at the dost* of accounts in 1930.
Last year the use of super, was restricted
by reduced buying power of the farmers,
prices eased, and, putting the 1930 figures
on an annual basis, there was a slip of
£30.557 in gross profits (£54,575). Exes.
(£49,926, including provision for bad debts
and depreciation) were £8656 lighter, leav-
ing the net result at 1.7 p.c. on capital com-
pared'with 10.1, 10.5, 6.7, 9, 10.4 and 9.8 p.c.
back to 1925; so shareholders went hungry.
To what extent an early revival of turn-
over can be looked for it is difficult to say;
it is largely a question of prices, the trend
of which is downward. Still, the Govern-
ment’s decision to assist farmers in the
purchase' of top-dressing, and the recent 10
p.c. wage cut in award rates, should mean
much to the super, cos., though margins pro-
mise to be slender and the cry of the tax-
gatherer more voiciferous. Dividend pros-
pects will depend largely upon the reduction
of costs through increased efficiency.
The next table further reflects the year’s
troubles, and the bulkiness of the debt: —

Though the stocks item was reduced by
£18,463, debtors’ balances were £17,299
lighter and £6599 net was struck off the
book value of fixed assets, only £1447 was
knocked off the overdraft and £21,130 off the
amount coming to sundry creditors. Thus
the £115,227 by which liabilities exceeded
the more or less liquids was £13,155 heavier
than at the previous balance. Until the
overdraft is substantially reduced the posi-
tion will remain unattractive.
The pound shares, priced at par a year
ago, now fetch 13s. in the market. At that
figure a 4 p.c. div. would return 6.1 p.c.
The backing is 225. lid. in net tangibles, all
fixed assets, worth what they can earn.

This is another of the once-prosperous
timber-traders now putting up a desperate
fight for existence, Certainly it has met with
more than the ordinary difficulties of the
industry. Owing to the early failure of
its Frazer Island venture, and the fluctuat-
ing fortunes of the Patrick line of steam-
ships, £70,000 was struck off the book value
of shares in other cos. in 1925, thus almost
eliminating the item. Then the more general
use of reinforced concrete and competition
from imported timbers made the business
so unprofitable that, during the four years
to the close of accounts in 1928, trading
and net capital losses combined amounted
to £196,093. The slate was cleaned by rub-
bing out £100,317 of reserves and making
two slashes at capital—one of ss. per share
in 1925 and another of Is. 6d. two years
later. A further Is. 6d. was returned in
“cash not required for business purposes.”
This left capital at £176,819 in 294,698 fully-
paid 12s. shares.
A year ago the board thought it saw
enough promise in the outlook to pay a small
div. But slump and the overbuilt state of
Sydney have brought about paralysis of the
construction trades; and with it has come
a crop of bad debts. Thus a loss of £11,257
showed up for the last term, making the
deficit on shareholders’ account £10.354 at
March 31. That is leaving the depreciation
reserve (£30,567), to which £1786 was
added during the year, out of the reckoning.
There is nothing to worry about in the
finances: —

The year’s reduction of £12,698 in debtors’
balances, and of £.12,097 in the book value
of stocks, was largely absorbed by the loss.
The amount coming to creditors was reduced
by £9840, and £2524 net was added to fixed
assets and £2128 to cash.
Owing to casualties in the trade, stocks
are being thrown on to the market at cut
prices, and there is little prospect of the co.
avoiding a trading loss for the current term.
Though the turnover of the survivors should
ultimately benefit, there appears to be a
le.an period ahead.
The 12s. shares are on offer at Is. 6d.
They are covered by net tangibles with a
book value of 11s. 3d., excluding 2s. per
share depreciation reserves.
East African Coffee
This co. is still in the development stage.
It has a paid capital of £150,000, is in the
same stable as Victoria Nyanza Sugar, and
was promoted by the late George R. Mayers
in 1928. Coffee-trees are not revenue pro-
ducers until three years old, and do not come
into full bearing until the sixth year.
The co. holds some 8500 acres, mostly on
a 99-year lease, in the Nandi and Kiambu dis-
tricts, East Africa, and has 1398 acres
planted with coffee-trees. Some of these have
been infected by pests recently, but no
serious trouble is anticipated in this respect.
The outlook in the industry is clouded by
over-production, and heavy stocks in Brazil,
which supplies over 70 p.c. of the world's
requirements. These stocks have broken down
prices, of course; thus good-quality Kenya
coffee, which sells at a better figure than
Brazilian, is now averaging around £BO per
ton as against £l3O only 18 months ago.
Because of this and the unavoidably heavy
cost of handling a small crop (63| tons) the
co. registered a loss of £1620 for the 12
months to August 31. 1930, reducing the
p. and 1. credit to £582; that was after
charging £13,678 to development account,
raising it to £44,026. Preliminary exes,
figure at £3260.
Here is the position as balance-sheet figures
disclose it

To finance the outlay on development, com-
plete the Kiambu factory and wipe £33,135
off the debt to the Mayers family (£11,940),
the board borrowed £9521 from Victoria
Nyanza, drew upon cash, etc., for £44,396
and upon book debts for £12,999, thus leav-
ing the debt £19,552 in excess of the more
or less liquids when the books closed.
The co.’s financial position and conditions
in the industry threaten to restrict the rate
of development for a while. Hence the hydro-
electric scheme has been hung on the peg;
but the drier plant at Nandi is to be com-
pleted.
The pound shares, which fetched 435. two
years ago, were recently priced at 17s. Includ-
ing the development account (ss. lid. per
share), the net asset backing is a shade over
par.

When this co. set up in the real-estate,
home-building and -finance business at
Perth in 1925, money (mostly other people’s)
was being scattered freely, and wages, rents
and capital values were climbing; thus sales
were easy. The co. plunged into debt to
finance expansion of the business, attractive
results were exhibited and liberal divs. were
paid. Shareholders got p.c. for each
of the first three years, followed by 8 p.c.
in 1929, when the profit claimed was 19.5
p.c. on av. cap. as against 22.1 p.c. and 15.5
p.c. in the two preceding terms.
But it is doubtful whether all the profits
had been realised when claimed. Acting on
expert advice, the board has now adopted a
more correct method of presenting the figures,
taking credit in the p. and 1. account for
actual cash receipts only. Thus there was
a sharp drop of £21,548 in last year’s gross
earnings (£10,827), and, after striking off
£2197 on account of repossessions and £384
for bad debts, a loss of £5328 showed up.
As against tliis there is a profit suspense
account of £12,264, some or all of which
may be turned into hard cash—whether it
includes £4713 of the previous year’s carry
forward that disappeared without comment
is not clear from the published figures.
To assist and protect a paid capital of
£122,978 in 184,118 £1 shares, of which
148,807 are called to 12s. 6d., there were
reserves, including the suspense account,
with a book value £7OOO in excess of intan-
gibles (£16,192) at Dec. 31. The outside
debt then totalled £134,738, or £14,550 more
than at the previous balance. Chief assets
are loans on mortgage and under contracts
of sale and unsold land. Hence the co.’s
earnings and prompt payment of its own
commitments depend mainly upon satisfac-
tory sales and regular repayments by pur-
chasers ; and there may be trouble ahead
there.
Last year the co.’s. property purchases ran
into £38,496, of which only £4902 had been
paid at the close of accounts. . Including the
balance with mortgages, the net increase in
that item was' £25,499, as the following com-
parison of balance-sheet figures shows: —
1928. 1929. 1930.
Paid capital .. .. £77,539 £104,745 £122,978

Thus, with £18,233 of fresh capital, £3032
added to the overdraft and a reduction of
£8916 in sundry debtors’ accounts, the board
was able to wipe £13,981 off the amount
coming to sundry creditors, mainly for build-
ing contracts, add £23,700 net to the book
value of freeholds and put out an extra
£19,358 on loans, Including loans, of which
£113,734 are secured by mortgage and £69,025
by contracts of sale, the book value of the
more or less liquid surplus was £53,241
when the books closed, or £5324 less than
at the previous balance.
The figures show net tangibles equal to
20s. lOd. per pound of paid capital.

At the .close of last accounts over two-tliirds
of this little soft-drinks co.’s £72,534 of
capital was represented by fixed deposits,
mortgages, Commonwealth bonds and some
book debts. So, despite the abrupt contrac-
tion in returns from its own trading, it was
able to show a profit of 7.1 p.c. on capital
as against 14.3, 12.4, 11.5, 11, 11.8 and
11 p.c. back to 1925. The 2 p.c. bo
dropped, leaving the div. at 8 p.c.; t
turnover still contracting, costs stubb
taxation heavier, a repetition of th
need not be expected until things b
look up.
Substantial savings due to in
methods of manufacture and distribut
reported, and finances are snug:—

The more or less liquid surplus (£55,733)
improved £l6Ol last year. Since 1927 the
book value of plant has been cut nearly in
halves, £12,384 more being written off than
was spoilt on the item.
The co. has a splendid history. It set up
21 years ago with a capital of £38,507. Five
years later £21,393 of bonus scrip was dis-
tributed, freehold and plant being written up
£11,444 for the purpose, and the div. dropped
from 10 p.c. to 7 p.c.; in 1922 a par issue
raised capital to its present figure, and a
run of 10 p.c. divs. followed.
The pound shares are covered by 265. Id. in
net tangibles, of which 15s. 7d. is surplus
liquids. They seldom come on to the market.

(1) To adopt and carry into effect the agreement prepared
by the Company's Solicitors entered into by George
L. Adams, Vendor, of the one part, and Trustee to
be appointed for and on behalf of the Company of
the other part, for the purchase of the secret formula
and process as for the conversion of Megasse mainly
into Kraft and high-grade white paper-pulp. To adopt
and carry into effect such other agreements that may
be referred to in the prospectus of the Company to
be issued.
(2) To establish a manufactory for paper-pulp at
Mackay and other centres in Queensland.
(3) To do such acts and to conduct such enterprises as
may be in furtherance of or incidental to the main
objects of the Company.
QUALIFICATION OF DIRECTOR:
The qualification of a Director is the holding of 1000 Shares in the Company,
as set out in the Memorandum and Articles of Association now being compiled.
THE OKTRAND BLEACHING PROCESS.
Mr. George L. Adams has secured the rights of the
Ortrand Bleaching Process for Australia, thus placing the
Company in a position to manufacture paper from jute
fibres, tarry ropes, old canvas, strings, spinning refuse, rags,
brown heart in timber, and various waste products obtainable
in large quantities at low cost for treating in readiness for
the raw material paper-pulp.
THE HYDROLOID PAPER-MAKING PROCESS
has proved entirely satisfactory in the manufacturing of
all classes of parchment. It includes newsprint to banknotes.
The chief characteristics of the paper are: Resistance to
breaks in foldings; it can be boiled; it is water- and grease-
proof, and easily printed; the print cannot be rubbed
off, and it is not possible to get an offset from the
printing. It is also an improved protection against
forgery.
The Company has been fortunate in securing the services
of Dr. Karl Griebb, of Stuttgart, an Industrial
Scientist, to come to Australia in charge of the process and
plant production.
SPECIAL NOTE OF GREAT INTEREST.
The process does not injure the staples of materials, and the result in loss of substance of not more than 25% as
against 50% under usual methods represents a considerable sum of money saved in cost of the raw material.
THE INDUSTRY WILL PRACTICALLY END IMPORTATION OF PAPER. THUS
RETAINING HUGE PROFITS IN AUSTRALIA.
WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF ORDER FOR PLANT IT CAN BE IN WORKING ORDER. There is no space
to deal with the methods of manufacturing various grades of paper-pulp, or with the plant and paper mills to be erected.
Complete details are available on application to the secretary (pro tern.).

The Hated
Middle Class
The object of the Communist
party is to dispossess the “capi-
talist” of all he has—to abolish
private property.
The International party no
longer aims at doing this by revolu-
tion involving bloodshed. It has
found a better way—a way of
doing it gradually through taxa-
tion and expropriation.
What progress with this plan is
the Moscow party making in Aus-
tralia ?
This, the most important ques-
tion before Australia to-day, especi-
ally for all who hold any sort of
private property at all, is discussed

Solicitors for the Petitioner,
134 Liverpool Street, Sydney.
when the co. secured the Australian rights to a
well-known make of Dutch safes, locks, etc.,
the name became Lips (Australia), Ltd.; it
was changed to the present title in 1925 to
remove any doubts as to the Australian
character of the organisation. The public
came in on the strength of a prospectus that
figured net profits of £19,500 p.a.; and paid
capital became £102,023 in 48,556 8 p.c.
cum. prefs. and 53,467 ords. The value
placed upon goodwill, etc., was £25,935, and
preliminary exes, made off with a further
£2905.
Though boom conditions were producing
extraordinary activity in the building trade,
on which the co.’s earnings largely depend,
estimates went all awry from the jump, and
small losses have alternated with slender
profits from year to year. So, excepting the
half ration which the prefs. got in the first
year, shareholders have gone hungry, and
£32,347 of the £53,467 of ordinary capital
was represented by intangibles at Dec. 31.
That is disregarding arrears of pref. divs.
amounting to £18,196. The least discourag-
ing aspect of the figures is the comparatively
small loss last year, notwithstanding the
violent change in trading conditions.
Moreover, there was a slight improvement
in the financial position:—

A reduction of £5806 in book debts enabled
£5818 net to be snipped off the outside debt.
Including stocks, the more or less liquid sur-
plus (£16,821) was £1162 stronger than at
the previous balance.
Nevertheless, drastic reconstruction appears
inevitable, with heavy if not entire loss of
ordinary capital, only £2924 of which was
intact at Dee. 31, if the arrears of pref. divs.
are taken into account. In the circumstances
it is too much for the prefs. to hope for full
payment of these arrears. The future of their
investment depends upon the co.’s ability or
otherwise to develop profit-earning capacity.
At the close of accounts the cover for the
prefs. was 28s. 8d. in net tangibles.
Mareeba Tobacco Debentures
This is an attempt by Amalgamated
Forests, Ltd., one of the Moulton brood, to
interest the public in tobacco-growing at
Mareeba, in the Cairns district, North
Queensland, by the issue of so-called deben-
tures. As generally understood a debenture,
like a mortgage, implies the existence of
special protection for both capital and
interest. No interest is offered in respect of
these Mareeba debentures, nor is there any
guarantee in respect of capital redemption,
or that the dividends spoken, of will be
realised.
The co. is offering 5600 debentures at
£10 apiece. For this price it undertakes to
plant 10 perches with tobacco, and generally
to care for and market the products until
Dec. 31, 1942. Debenture-holders are thus
asked to put up £160 per acre. The co. gets
in bright and early for the plums, taking
10 p.c. of the gross proceeds of each harvest.
From whatever is left, after this and all
exes, in connection with marketing, etc.,
have been paid, it takes another 10 p.c.
The remaining nine-tenths of the net profit
is handed to Australasian Trustees and
Executors, Ltd., another of the Moulton
family, which lias undertaken the job of
trustee for the debenture-holders.
The prospectus figures that, with tobacco
averaging 3s. per pound, net profits will be
sufficient to enable the trustee to pay a
total of £60, including a “cumulative dividend”
of 10 p.c. p.a. in respect of each £10 debenture
by Dec. 31, 1942. That is equal to an aver-
age of 50 p.c. p.a., with your original capi-
tal (£10) back as well, all within 10 years,
notwithstanding the downward trend of
prices generally, the stubbornness of costs
and the growth in taxation. There is no
mention of any contract for the sale of the
output.
But, of course, they are only estimates.
They are based on an annual production of
8501b. of tobacco per acre from 350 acres
for nine years. Cultivation of a propor-
tionate part is to begin within 12 months
from the date of issue of each debenture, and
planting during the next planting seasou
thereafter. The debenture is not issued until
fully paid, and, on the instalment plan,
this may be from nine months to 22 months
after application. Though Mareeba promises
well as a tobacco-growing centre, one big
danger in these so-called debenture schemes
is overcapitalisation. The 10 p.c. “cumula-
tive dividend” in this case means nothing.
Apart from whatever may be contained in
the trust deed, the only security offered
debenture-holders, in respect of both their
capital and dividends, is the rough guesses
of an impudent prospectus; whereas they
shoulder all the risks worth mentioning.
The prospectus does not say definitely
what is to become of the land after
Dec. 31, 1942; presumably it is retained by
the co. The title deeds to the freehold are
to be deposited with the trustee as a guaran-
tee that the co. will do the cultivating,
planting and marketing and collect its 10
p.c. on sales, etc.
Incidentally, the sole brokers are E. S.
and R. C. Moulton, Ltd., a concern formed
by E. S. Moulton, of Queensland, and which
in turn fostered Queensland Forests, Ltd.,

Savings Bank of N. S. Wales
The Commonwealth Bank Board, having
spent most of the past month digging into
the affairs of the G.S.B. of N. S. Wales,
sent to the Federal Government last Friday
the terms on which it is prepared to absorb
the suspended institution. Assets are easy
things to take over: what the board had to
remember was that every deposit is a
liability, and that many of the assets repre-
senting these liabilities, including forced and
voluntary loans to the Government, are
frozen hard. It may be that all the assets
will turn out to be worth 20s. in the £; but
many of them can only be liquidated slowly.
It seems certain, therefore, that, while
arrangements may be made to release small
deposits, in the hope that the bulk of them
will come back to the bank, part of the
larger deposits will have to be funded for
varying periods.
Political considerations have, it is held,
governed the granting of advances in the
Rural Bank and Homes Department; and
it is understood that the board has not been
able to regard these as banking proposi-
tions. If the guarantee of the Government
of N. S. Wales was as good as it once was,
there would be a simple way to overcome
that difficulty; but unfortunately it isn’t.
The board is the guardian, before all, of
the interests of its own depositors, and it
cannot imperil them even to save another
similar institution.
Addressing a meeting of Zinc Corp. share-
holders in London the other day, Sir Robert
Horne made some encouraging remarks
about gold-mining in Australia. These
doubtless had special reference to Gold
Mines of Australia, Ltd., most of the shares
in which are held by New Consolidated Gold-
fields, the National Smelting Co. of London,
North Broken Hill, Electrolytic Zinc and
Zinc Corp. Gold Mines of Australia has
been investigating the Mt. Coolon goldfield
in Queensland, one of the few remaining
regular producers in the northern State. A
lot of money has been spent testing this
property, over which the co.’s option expires
on July 31.

Oriomo Explorations has taken up a
further gold-dredging area of 600 acres
immediately north of the block of river flats
in the Gainsbrough district (N.Q.) which
Placer Development is investigating. Rights
have also been secured over the Orient gold-
mine, and exemption from labor conditions
has been grantend pending preliminary inves-
tigation of the dredging area.
* # * *
To see Lake View and Star’s new £300,000
crushing and treatment plant to completion
New Consolidated Goldfields has agreed to
advance the co. up to £100,000. The first
of the two crushing sections —it can deal
with SO tons of stone per hour —is complete,
and the second will be pushed ahead when
alterations to the Chaffers’ shaft are finished.
Thus crushing will be concentrated on the
Chaffers’ lease, adjacent to the flotation
plant. Two wet ball mills, each capable of
putting through 250 tons per 24 hours, have
been completed, and the new classifier, tube
mill and flotation machines will be ready
presently. Hopes are that by the end of
October the plant will be dealing with 20,000
tons monthly, increasing later to 30,000 and
then to 40,000 tons. The saving in power
costs alone is figured at £23,000 p.a., and
when the maximum output is reached work-
ing costs are expected to be got back to a
little over 20s. per ton.

Kalgoorlie mine amalgamations are again
being discussed in Two groups are
spoken of, one comprising Lake View, Horse-
shoe, Gt. Boulder and Perseverance, and the
other Associated, South Kalgurli, North
Kalgurli, Hainault and Enterprise. A few
of the directors concerned are opposed to
amalgamations, and want things left as they
are, at least during their lifetime. But
a gradual reduction in the grade of ore,
which seems likely, and the consequent neces-
sity of bigger tonnages, will probably enable
those who are hollaring for amalgamations
to come out on top. Either that or good-
bye to any divs. worth mentioning.
* * * *
Lady Central mine, Meekatharra, has been
under notice recently through reports of
good developments and yields—the last
return being 811oz. from 231 tons. On the
advice of W. Bestwick, Adelaide, the "King
of Creation Co. has taken an option over
the show. Yields have been consistently
good, and if there is a fair tonnage remain-
ing in the mine, prospects would be decent
even though grade fell off a bit.
* * * *
Following the lament of Great Boulder
Prop.’s mine manager regarding the low
average grade of the ore, the declaration of
a 3d. div. came as a pleasant surprise to
shareholders. Apart from South Kalgurli,
divs. from W.A. mines have been remark-
ably few of recent years. But when North
Kalgurli, Lake View and Star and Wiluna
get into their stride cheques may be more
plentiful.

Prospecting in the Larkinville district,
0- B. Frank has discovered a lode winch
promises more volume than most or the
recent W.A. finds. At a depth of 20it.
there is Bft. of stone worth up to announce.
Takuapa, formed in Sydney 11 years ago
to work a Siamese tin-dredging proposition,
reports a loss of £6190 for the 12 months
to Dec. 31, as against a profit of ±4-,2<u
the year before. The 9244 tons of oxide
recovered averaged £B3 155., or £4O less than
the previous year’s average. Thus revenue
was £36,977 lighter at £77,512; exes, made
off with £83,703, including £15,204 for de-
preciation and £11,686 of debenture interest.
But £83,591 was brought into the accounts
so, after paying a nmepenny div. (£9675), a
p. and 1. credit of £68,026 remained. An
additional area containing 880,000 cubic
yards has been bought at Takuapa, reducing
the surface rights to be acquired to 3,400,0U0
cubic yards. The new dredge on the Ban
Pru property is making satisfactory progress.

mented by £IOO,OOO of 12i P-C- debentures
Outside liabilities totalled £17,378; book
debts, cash, etc., £14,968. The pound shares

Muang Tin, floated in Sydney some four
years ago to work a Siamese property,
claimed £471 net for the year ended Dec. 31;
no allowance was made for depreciation.
Starting the year with low recoveries, t ie
dredge ended 1930 by cleaning up 330 tons
of t. 0., which realised £26,658. It is intended
to make anew issue of debentures to retire
the existing £20,000-worth of 10 per cents.,
due in Sept., and to pay off sundry creditors
(£16,173 at Dec. 31), mainly the balance
owing on the dredge and for spare parts.

LOAN CONVERSION QUESTIONS.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) What penalties will he enforced for
non-conversion? (2) Is it likely that un-
announced additional penalties will ue later
imposed? (3) Why do the whole press
refrain from giving us information as to the
alternative? (4) My desire is to preserve
my capital without loss , and to that ena
interest is secondary. Is my attitude not
a general one, and if so will the conversion
not faiU—ditd. „„
(1) and (2) The scheme provides for a
p.c. tax on the interest of unconverted bonds.
Converted loans will be free from the pre-
sent super-tax (7$ p.c.) and from further
taxation by Commonwealth or any State,
but will be subject to existing taxes other
than the 74 p.c. Unconverted loans will be
liable to any tax which necessities may dic-
tate in addition tb present taxes and the 2o
p.c. tax. (3) The alternative of taxation
is kept well in the background because it is
hoped to preserve the “voluntary” character
of the loan, the idea being that the moral
effect of a successful “voluntary” loan will
be much greater than that of a compulsory
loan —especially in Britain. (4) Principal
can be preserved just as well by conversion
as by non-conversion. It is the interest that
conversion cuts down, not the principal. In
most cases, indeed, principal is added to: the
holder of £IOO of any stock carrying over
5 p.c. will get more than £IOO of the new
4 p.c. issue. Thus conversion will appa-
rently suit this inquirer very well—much
better, anyway, than he apparently thinks.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
In 1924 I took out a house-purchase policy
for £SOO with an office recently established,
annual premium being £23 10s. The policy
provides for payment of £SOO in 1944 or at
death, hospital fees up to 30s. per week, pay-
ment of premium in event of total disability,
loan of £SOO at 64 p.c. on approved free-
hold secured by first mortgage if funds are
available after the policy has been five years
in force. After paying seven yearly pre-
miums (£164 10s.) lam offered a surrender
value of £32 18s. What do you think of
it?— 42l3.
The best way to answer such questions is
to quote actual experience with one of the
front-rank offices: in this case it was the
A.M.P. The surrender value of an endowj
ment policy for 20 years effected at age 25
for £SOO was £125 7s. Id. ; cash value ot
£69 18s. reversionary bonuses, £4O 17s. 4d.;
total surrender value, £166 4s. sd. Annual
premium was £23 9s. 2d. Total premiums
paid, £164 4s. 2d. Meantime, of course,
the policy-holder had had cover for £SOO
plus reversionary bonuses.
Our gold backing for notes is roughly 25
p.c. What is wrong with the Commonwealth
Bank paying £8 Bs. per ounce for gold pro-
duced in Australia? This would result in
a large increase in gold output, also improve
the note backing, if production was high
enough, to 50 p.c. I enpect there is a catch,
but where?— 423la.
When the Commonwealth Bank issues
notes it has hitherto required a 25 p.c. gold
backing. But the other 75 p.c. hasn’t been
issued against thin air. If you have had
£1 worth of gold you couldn’t take it in to
the C.B. and get a £1 note against the gold
and £3 against nothing. There is a great
deal of talk about issuing notes against
products. Asa matter of fact something of
the sort is always done: you can get only
one £1 note for £1 worth of gold; to get the
other three £ notes which the bank is
entitled to issue, you must lodge value or
security of some sort. If a man was paid
£8 Bs. per ounce for gold, it would mean
that one £1 note would be issued against gold
and another £1 note against no value what-
ever; and that would be inflation pure and
undefiled.
Desirable qualities in mica for industrial
purposes ? —4302.
Freedom from cracks, faults or holes;
absence of magnetite, quartz inclusions, and
impurities resulting from decomposition or
surface infiltration. Property of splitting
along the cleavages must be well developed ;
sheets should be flexible, resilient, trans-
parent and of a uniform softness. Regarding
transparency a standard thickness of 2mm.
is used as a guide in determining whether
the grade should be “wine colored,” “smoky”
or “spotted.” Faults, even though in
miniature, interfere seriously with the
perfect splitting of the sheets. ‘ The absence
of magnetite is very essential where the
mica is used for electrical insulation.
Brittleness is generally a bad feature; fine
quartz grains make the sheet useless for
certain parts in electrical machinery in
which uniformity in texture is absolutely
necessary. Other impurities, such as clay
and oxide of iron, lower the electrical
resistance. Softness is required in mic,
used for electrical appliances constantly n
motion, and is a valuable quality; soft mict
is also adapted to the making of m&gnett
condenser plates and appliances connect'd-
with wireless work.

ANY SUGGESTIONS TO OFFER?
wife and family, his clothing, medical atten-
tion and modest luxuries. In short, do what
one will, a man, if lucky enough to be
employed at all, must work hard, live hard
and go into debt.
I am tired of moderation and hard work.
If there really is any Moscow gold knocking
about I should like to get next to it. I
would willingly preach and, to the best of
my ability, practise something a whole lot
worse than Communism if by so doing I
could get enough money to keep my wife and
kids in decency and comfort. So, if you know
who has charge of the distribution of these
funds, please let me have his address. But
be quick, for shortly there will up here be
nobody left unconverted. —Yours, Barcoo

Our National Waste
Dear Bulletin, —City-dwellers, whose in-
comes have decreased from 25 p.c. to 75 p.c.,
are still paying about the same for
their necessaries as they did before the
slump. Yet they could increase their “real
incomes” with ease in all sorts of directions
if they cared, and at the same time help
the primary producer, who alone can get the
country out of its present mess in the long
run. Take one line, orange jam—quoted be-
cause oranges are in season. It costs Is. 6d.
a jar in the thousands of superfluous little
shops that clutter most of the Melbourne
and Sydney suburbs. Anyone can make it
as follows: 51b. sugar, Is. lOd.; 5 oranges,
5d.; 2 lemons, Id.; 2£ hours’ gas, (id.; total,
2s lOd. This gives six pots at something
under 6d. apiece. There are hundreds of
other directions in which income could easily
be doubled or trebled. For example, soup-
making. No French or German household
would dream of buying its soup in a tin
filled in the U.S.A., as 95 per cent, of our
householders do ; the family stockpot is the
basis of the family soup, and it costs hardly
anything. Most of us will have to fall back
on some of these sensible practices before
we are finished. For that matter, home-made
clothes of home-woven cloth, as substitutes
for the expensive articles we have been im-
porting, are not beyond the bounds of imagi-
nation. —Yours etc., H. SiNGEMOiNE.
Gutter Parliaments
Dear Bulletin,— One British M.P., Mc-
Govern by name, defied the authority of the
Speaker. After repeated warnings his
removal was ordered, and as he offered resist-
ance he was bundled out. Several of his
friends rendered him more or less active
assistance. At no time during the incident
was there anything more unseemly than the
affront to the dignity of the House. Yet
McGovern was suspended for the session,
while his supporters had to make an abject
apology to the Speaker. Following on that,
the Labor party executive passed McGovern
out of the Parliamentary Labor party, and
declared him ineligible for nomination at
future elections.
Compare the attitude under similar circum-
stances of some Australian Parliaments,
notably that of N. S. Wales. Frequently
members indulge in abuse and badinage,
which, if uttered in a public and unprivileged
place, would land them in the nearest police
station. Libel, civil.and criminal, is a com-
monplace, and the grossest accusations and
insinuations are bandied to and fro. Only a
year or so ago a shocked house listened to
an exchange of accusations between two
Labor members —one of them an ex-Minister
of the Crown —which was of a nature so
obscene that it could not be printed even
in a press summary. Yet, in this, as in
other instances almost as revolting, nothing
more has been demanded than a formal with-
drawal. Action on the lines taken by the
British Government would do much to pui-ge
The Deadly Dole
Dear Bulletin, —One very bad feature
of the “Deadly Dole” not touched on in
B. l/7/’3l is the deterioration of many ot
its recipients. In this district, when the
rotten system first started, it was rushed
almost solely by those who had hitherto
spent most of their lives in avoiding work,
and was welcomed by them as an easy means
to a very desirable end. The decent, hard-
working ' class, wanting work and looking
askance on charity in any shape whatever,
tightened up their belts to the limit before
shamefacedly applying for their tickets,
and their denunciations of the system, de-
spite the fact that it alone stood netweem
them and starvation, were loud. “Why can t
the cows give us a day’s work a week an
let us earn our bit of tucker?” was heard
on every hand. However, that w r as all a
little time back, and one doesn’t hear any
demands for work now, or' denunciations ot
charity either. These fine young fellows
have lost their self-reliant, independent out-
look. They no longer regard charity as an
abomination and a reproach to their man-
hood, but are firmly persuaded that the first
duty of the State is to provide them with
the means of living. Odd jobs that a tew
months ago were rushed are now, in many
instances, coldly declined unless the wage
offered is well in excess of the value ot
their “ticket.” The Opposition parties, par-
ticularly the C.P., should waste no timfe
in telling the people where they stand ib
regard to this debauching system. A flat
declaration that, while no one would be
allowed’to starve during the difficult times
ahead, work from those capable of perform-
ing it in return for the means of living would
be demanded, would lose them some votes,
hut gain them many more. More important
still, it would give these fellows, whom 1
have always regarded as the finest human
material on earth, a chance of regaining
their souls. —Yours etc., N. D. Rae.
A Suggested Bargain
Dear 8.,—1 suggest that the next time
the banks and insurance offices are asked
to voluntarily join in a loan or reduce
interest or anything of the sort, they demand
the expulsion of Garden .and every other
known Communist or reputed Communist
agent or advocate as their price.—Yours,
Anticom.
The Larger Cause of Our Depression
Dear B., —The past years of prosperity
gave rise to a huge trade war whose results
were high expenses and credit trading of
every conceivable form. Now trade is
left with a disastrous heritage —the economic
waste that is represented in the vast differ-
ence between cost of producing an article
and its selling price to the public. About.
20 p.c. of the "people are doing actual pro-
ductive work; the remaining 80 p.c. are
engaged in the safeguarding, handling and
distribution, etc., of the others’ product. About
60 p.c. of the people are in wrong positions,
and if they could be put to productive work
the country would produce four times the
quantity of goods at no further cost. A
certain article well known to me costs to
produce 12s. 6d. to 155.; to warehouse, 305.;
to retailer, 635. Bd.; to public, 955. 6d.
The high cost of living lies not in the
production but in the distribution of goods.
Therefore I would (1) institute an absolutely
cash basis of trading, enforced by remov-
ing all legal claim to unsecured credits;
registered traders to be given seven days
grace, and any default to constitute fraud.
And (2) fix expenses limits for the various
trades —similar to an M.P.’s election expenses.
—Yours, Geo. Lee.
The Great Hope
Dear Bulletins,—The causes of some of the
economic troubles that beset all the nations
are becoming apparent, and there are the
beginnings of concerted action to remove
those causes. The Great War, welter of evil
though it was. banded some nations together
in a common cause, and, to that extent, made
for mutual sympathy and tolerance. The
Great Depression, bridging the rift made by
the Great War, seems to be powerfully
extending that process. No nation, we have
been shown, can live for itself alone. It
must help others to help itself.
The world still has a lot of hard nuts
to crack, outstanding among them the pro-
blem of unemployment. The key to that
isn’t obvious, perhaps because it isn’t a
matter of one key but of a dozen, some ol
which are already to our hands. But that
problem will be solved; it is a challenge
to civilisation, and civilisation answers its
challenges.
For Australia, ahead of the bog we are
ploughing through just now, there is great
hope. Not because our territory is rich in
what the loanmongers used to describe as
our “great, natural resources”—these are
neither better nor worse than they ever
were from a purely material standpoint-
hut because we have been taught sharply
that we can’t sit on top of a pile of natural
resources, however rich, and get wealthy by
talking about them. There are all the mak-
ings of a good living in this land for four
times its present population, but the only
way to get it is to work for it and put
brains into the job.—Yours. Avon.
High Costs Make Bolsheviks
Dear Bulletin, —Up here, we learn that
some liighly-salaried blidiot has stated that
the cost of living has fallen, and thereupon
wages are lowered ; but we discover that we
still have to pay Is. for lib. jam. 6d. for lib.
rice and Sd. for one loaf of bread. The blidiot
bleats again and once more wages are
lowered; but those prices still remain and
we still have to pay 2s. for 80 gallons of
muddy drinking water and 14s. for 501 b.
flour.' Once more we are told that the cost
of living has fallen, and once more wages arc
lowered; but, all prices remain the same,
excepting for tobacco and tea, which have
gone up.
If one works on a station he has, if quite
competent and exceedingly lucky. 50s. weekly
with which to support his wife and children
and buy his own clothes and tobacco. If
one works on the basic wage he has, after
keeping himself in camp, 565. weekly for his
these gutter Parliaments of their undesir-
able elements, or at least keep them within
the bounds of decency.—Yours, Round Turn.
Crown Land Purchasers
Dear Bulletin, —Here is a chance for
Governments to prove their willingness to
assist without ' appreciably affecting their
income. Through decreased value of produc-
tion, land values have slumped; but that
portion of many holdings (C.P.’s, etc.) due to
the Crown remains unaltered. This is un-
fair • the Crown ought to bear its share of
the burden. Are we not justified in expect-
ing from Governments an act of grace equal
to that which they have asked from the bond-
holders?—Yours, Back Swallow.
A Parable of Four Tanks
Dear Bulletin,—ln the various discus-
sions on economic problems arising out of
the world’s financial troubles there has been
very little attention paid to the mechanics
of our system of production. These are
comparatively simple. Imagine four tanks.
One, above all the others, can be labelled
“raw materials” or “natural resources, ’ or
any other tag that covers the source of all
wealth. This leads into tank No. 2, which con-
tains capital, or, as the socialists would put it,
the “means of production, distribution and
exchange.” Attached to this is a pump (the
credit system) which is the _ heart of the
whole business. In connection with this
pump is an expanding and contracting device
(bank loans), which can be manipulated to
regulate the flow to tank No. 3 (wages),
which in turn flows into tank No. 4 (pro-
ceeds of sold commodities). Tank No. 4,
whenever its level is high enough, flows back
into tank No. 2 (capital), and to enable
it to function in that respect as regularly
as possible it is fitted with an expanding
and contracting device (bankruptcies), which
shrinks when the credit-pump expander is
distended and swells when the credit-supply
regulator is contracted. That’s the whole
box and dice, except that there is an unstop-
pable leak in the capital tank (depreciation)
which is occasionally widened by means of
a tool called “war-waste and other dam-
foolishness.” The wages tank also has a
leak, which is getting bigger, called “losses
through unemployment.” This is the most
serious defect of the machine from a mechani-
cal standpoint, as this tank, unlike No. 2
and No. 4, has no equalising device, and is
not in direct connection with Tank No. 1.
Unless this leak is reduced, or, better still,
stopped entirely, the time will come when
the whole machine will cease to function,
necessitating drastic reconstruction. —I am,
etc., Plumber Bill.
Ten Bales of Wool
Dear Bulletin, —How can farmers help
employ the 100,000 N. S. Wales worklcss
when six bales of my wool sent in this month
(June) is valued by brokers at £lO the iot,
or about 335. per bale? There were two
bales each of fleece wool, crutching and lambs,
costing me in shearing and cartage £9 15s.
I would hate to see a return to those bad old
days of the early nineties of last century
when a strong man would offer his services
for 12s. 6d. per week and be glad to get
it; but costs must come down. —Yours,
Borambil.
Russia and Australia
Dear Bulletin,— lf Australia does not
become a Communistic state by legislation
she may become one by force. Russia is
out to undercut the world in an endeavor
to make herself supreme. She wishes con-
trol of the world’s markets. Australia is
essentially a primary producer. Under the
British flag Australia would be a menace
to Russia; Australia communised under
Russia would put Russia in a position where
she could dictate food-terms to most of the
world.
We see riots in Sydney with Russians at
the head in each. We see Russian propa-
ganda everywhere—l presume paid for by
Russian money. We see mystery ships com-
ing into our harbors. We hear of Russian
football teams wishing to come to Australia
during winter months —summer in Vladi-
vostok. We hear of activities in the Rus-
sian naval and air forces. What is easier
than to produce chaos in our capital cities
and for 40,000 troops to land and take con-
trol? The feeding is simple—let the Aus-
tralians in the cities starve until organised
food supplies are obtained from the coun-
try ! The question to answer is not so much
how this can be done, but how would we
get them out if it did happen. And if the
scheme did fail, what’s 40,000 men to
Russia ?—Yours, A. A.
Decentralising Wool Sales
Dear B., —The “mystery deep and dark'
that “Brisbane Tepys” (B. l/7/’3l)
imagines lies behind the failure to_ hold
wool sales at Gladstone and Townsville is
a simple matter of £ s. d. That and the
natural reluctance of -buyers to go to the
wool as long as the wool will come to them.
Before sales could be held in a new centre
much money would have to be spent on the
erection of stores with suitable show floors,
and it is very unlikely that, any of the wool-
broking firms w T ould think of that to-day
with their reduced earnings and increasing
taxation. An attempt was made five years
or so ago to get sales started in Townsville,
but it proved a “flop,” principally ow r ing
to the two reasons given above. In our pre-
sent circumstances the _ best suggestion- is
to make the best of things as they are. —
Yours, Lass.
Our Boys
Dear B., —Every year many boys leave
school, and- parents are at their wits’ end
how to find jobs for them.
Large numbei’s of lads were brought from
overseas, ostensibly as farm assistants,
though many drifted to the towns. The
Scout and Little Brother organisations
looked after them, taking care of them when
out of work and doing much to secure jobs
for them. But I have yet to learn of any
organisation prepared to push the interests
of our own Australian boys and obtain places
for them, more particularly on farms. From
a good knowledge of the intelligence and
capabilities of Australian and British boys,
I say without hesitation that the local-born
are much ahead. Then why have we not
numbers of them on our farms? To be sure,
farmers are under a cloud at present, but
that will go; indeed, the clouds are lifting
already. We want these boys in the coun-
try. There they will be producers; at present
they are merely a problem. We have great
open spaces wanting man-power, and these
boys of ours will provide the best of
man-power. Get them into the country, look
after them there, and only a small percentage
will drift into our overcrowded cities.
Won’t someone take the necessary steps to
bring about this move back to the country ?
—Yours, Curlew.
Woods and Scouts
Dear B., —Australian woods got a fine
boost amongst the rising generation at the
Scoutcraft exhibition in Adelaide. For the
best collection of Australian woods the
honors went to the Port Augusta lads with
S 6 timbers representative of all the States —
well got up and mounted, and the blending
of the tints was very effective. The adjudi-
cator questioned the boys in regard to the
uses of the woods and localities of their
growth. , , , ~
Many of these boys, who till lately could
not distinguish oregon from jarrah, can now
name offhand at a glance many of our Aus-
tralian woods. I recommend similar com-
petitions : they let our lads know how
lavishly nature has endowed us. —Chips.

More mutterings of a Theatrical Icono-
clast :
Having, for the first time since their in-
ception, set out to sit through a whole
evening at the talkies, I have come to the
conclusion that the decay of the old creeds
is producing the inevitable effect in the
growth of a new religion. It goes under
the mysterious name of “Unit Entertain-
ment.”
The religious atmosphere was evoked when
I entered the theatre through an avenue or
"Entered through an avenue or arcade of
high priests.”
arcade of high priests dressed in a fashion
that would have suggested once that
the show was under regal patronage. The
inner court of the temple was plunged in
darkness, and there was a faint thrill of
incense in the air—another appeal to the reli-
gious reflexes. By five-past eight everybody
was in his seat. There was no late-coming.
The congregation was hushed, and appa-
rently expectant. Then music was heard,
distant, invisible. The sounds grew louder,
and presently the players rose to view from
subterranean depths playing a “Medley of
Empire Songs” very badly. Simultaneously
the sleek head of a gentleman emerged from
a decorated drainpipe on the o.p. side, to-
gether with a pure gold Wurlitzer. That
was Unit 1.
Then a crimson curtain gracefully divided,
a second curtain went soaring skywards, a
third curtain followed, and as the last veil
dropped I craned forward, expecting to see
some vision of shuddering beauty or perhaps
an archangel. Instead, I saw a square of
asbestos, on which, in slow succession, the
moving finger of a searchlight wrote
“The Directors of Bunion Theatres
In Conjunction with
Bluff, Bluestone, Ltd.,
Have pleasure in
Presenting
the Fivehundred and Fiftysixth
Theatre Splendiferous
Unit Entertainment.”
I sat back, expecting to see something. Fol-
lowed the announcement: —
“.Australian Super Super News Reels,
Australia, Ltd., Gazette Extraordinary,
Direction Ben Jonson, photographed by
John Milton, vocalisation by William Shaks-
peare.”
The light went out and came on again,
revealing a moving photograph of a flock
of sheep. I had seen real live animals on
the stage. There were real pigs in “Pigs
Is Pigs” and a real dog in “Dracula.” But
there was dramatic justification for their
appearance. Never before had I seen a
flock of sheep, as sheep, presented to an
audience as entertainment. That was Unit 2.
Unit 3, according to my programme, was
a cornet solo by Mr. Oblate Spheroid, speci-
ally arranged for the Theatre Splendiferous
from Gems of the Great Classics, by Mr.
Oblate Spheroid. Once more the auditorium
was plunged in darkness, and once more the
searchlight reappeared. It groped along the
orchestra, and finally discovered Mr. Oblate
Spheroid himself, standing there ready with
his instrument, a beatific smile on his face,
his diamond shirt-stud flashing like a sema-
phore. Mr. Spheroid put his cornet to his

lips and played Dvorak’s “Humoreske,”
with many improvements. Slight applause.
Darkness. Unit 3 was over.
Unit 4 was Educational. After the usual
announcements we were shown the enter-
tainment value contained in a drop of water,
unsuspected until the great era of amuse-
ment inaugurated by the motion-picture in-
dustry.
Unit 5 was an acrobatic turn that would
have been booed off in the old days by any
self-respecting vaudeville audience.
Unit 6 was the weekly news gazette by
the grand, marvellous, super-magnificent,
huge, big, little Theatre Splendiferous corps
of news gazette photographers. It consisted
of a picture of a girls’ association annual
picnic, such as no average theatregoer ever
imagined could be included in the category
of “entertainment” until this great era of
super amusement inaugurated by the terrific,
super stupendous cinema industry, etc.
The next happening was the interval —
beg pardon, Intermission.
Nobody moved during the Intermission. 1
gathered that they were all praying for the
further success of the Great, * Big, Benefi-
cent motion-picture industry. The devotees
in the front row of the stalls were resting
their aching eyes in readiness for a fresh
effort of religious asceticism. I was re-
minded of the yogis sitting on nails in India.
Unit 7 was another rendition of the works
of the Greatest Composers by the Theatre
Splendiferous Orchestra.
Once more the theatre was plunged in
darkness. The air became thick with sup-
pressed excitement. The veils before the
asbestos altar divided and flew skyward;
the searchlight leapt forth again. Something
was going to happen. The screen became
agitated. Letters rained upon it. They up-
ended themselves like regiments rising from
their trenches. They flung themselves at
it from all sides. They tumbled downwards.
They impinged upon it, burst and exploded
in majestic polysyllables.
“The Directors of Bunion , Theatres in
Conjunction with Bluff, Bluestone, Ltd.,

Talkie Month. Electrifying Blue Ribbon
Diversity Entertainment,

Darkness! I held my breath.
“Commencing AN EXTENDED SEASON
NEXT SATURDAY!”
I breathed again. That was something I
had escaped, anyhow.
Unit 8. The screen once more became
incredibly loquacious. This was the first pro-
duction of Efftee Films, Mr. Thring’s enter-
prise. It consisted of the farewell speech
of a State Governor. I learnt for
the first time that Lord Somers was 43
diffident feet in height. Also that his voice
reproduced perfectly, and that he was a
“Mr. Oblate Spheroid ... .a beatific smile
on his face.”
supreme master of platform platitudes. He
spoke at extraordinary length on the need
for inter-imperial trade and the necessity
for organisation of our great natural re-
source*,.
When I began listening to Lord Somers I
was a monarchist. At the third mention of
the Empire Marketing Board I became a
revolutionary socialist-republican, and by
the time the gubernatorial shadow had shyly
faded from my vision I was an ardent advo-
cate of a Reign of Terror, in which all aiders
and abettors of the form of entertainment
euphemistically known as “talkie shorts”
would follow each other to the guillotine.
Unit 9 was the great picture of the even-
ing. I glanced at my watch. It was five
to ten. Polysyllables, interspersed with
proper names of every known nationality
and some new ones, were beginning to crash
against the screen, but I was making for
the exit. If I hurried I still had time to
hear Lily Moore at the Tivoli tell that one
about the commercial traveller and the
typist.
Yes, the talkies are a religion. Nowhere
but in a great Age of Faith would a Satur-
day-night audience of average citizens sub-
mit to being educated on the subject of
drops of water, instructed on the functions
of the Empire Marketing Board and thrilled
by the doings of a sdioolgirls’ picnic.
The brilliant revival of “My Lady’s
Dress,” at Sydney Royal, has special in-
terest in the first Australian appearance of
Iris Darbyshire. Miss Darbyshire is a very
effective actress, with no physical or vocal
characteristics pronounced enough to prevent
her slipping easily into any rBle. That she
is not completely successful is the fault of
Knoblock and Mr. Harvey.
Knoblock wrote the play, and if he bad
maliciously intended to find actresses out he
couldn’t have invented a better test. The
leading lady has to be a London wife who
has just bought a 75-guinea dress, and then
in rapid succession an Italian peasant girl,
the wife of a sick weaver in France, a
Dutch maid of the lfifiO vintage, a crippled
Cockney girl, adulterous wife to a trapper
in Siberia, the Loudon wife again buying the
dress, in the same scene a mannequin,
and finally back once more to the opening
boudoir. Miss Darbyshire was completely
successful in the lighter of these very varied
roles. Her best was in the Dutch scene,
a nicely-laundered splash of comedy, in which
Knoblock not only sends his people back a
few hundred years but gets a capital extra
effect by going back there himself. The
scene is near-seventeenth-century dramatic
craftsmanship as well as seventeenth-century
setting. It might have been lifted whole
from any one of half a dozen early drama-
tists. But such marks of stagecraft are all
over the play. If Knoblock did set out to
give leading lady and leading man a poser
he has the excuse that he at least asked
them to do nothing in their sphere that he
hadn’t already done in his own. The play
“Forty-three diffident feet
of State Governor.”

Her uneven-
ne s s might
not have been
noticed at all
if Mr. Harvey had only had the graci-
ousness to be uneven also. , But, apparently,,
he isn’t capable of that. From the
flippancy of the Dutch scene to the savage
tragedy of the peasant scene, he man-
ages it all with superb ease and confidence.
It is contagious acting. You feel that he
can’t let you down, and he doesn’t. Per-
haps his night’s work is easier than Miss
Darbyshire’s. It is on broader lines. There
are wider differences of physical appearance
and mental character among his men than
among her women, or it may be only his
finer art making it appear so. He has to be
the husband of the woman who bought the
75-guinea dress in the first scene, and also
fill the other opposite rSles of an Italian
hawker, a tippling French weaver, an ex-
quisite of old Holland, a Cockney, a Siberian
trapper, and Jaequelin of the ragshop in New
Bond-street, all broad types. _ His French
tippling is a trifle weak, but in the rest his
work ranges from very good to brilliant. He
not only does things with clothes, gesture
and voice; somehow he seems to grow taller
and shorter at will. It is acting of a really
superior kind. Playing up to Knoblock must
be hard enough, but playing up to Mr. Har-
vey is a test to take the glitter out of any-
thing but a diamond. Miss Darbyshire just
happens to be not quite a diamond.
The entertainment altogether is first-class.
It makes two plays in Sydney that are really
worth looking at (the other is “The Con-
stant Nymph,” being done by amateurs at
the Savoy). In the dressy piece Coral
Brown further advances her claims to recog-
nition as a young actress of something more
than promise. She is a trifle hard, but con-
sidering her stage age, and her other age,
too, she does wonderfully well. John Fern-
side suffers from the fact that his voice is
unadulterated Barcoo whether he is using
it to simulate the Australian, the Italian or
the Russian manner. The pretty big cast
also includes Harvey Adams, Pirie Bush,
Kate Towers and a bagful of others.

A fascinating show of the week was the
recording of a lyrebird’s vocal efforts on a
talkie screen under the Film House, Sydney.
They included a fine range of bird calls —■
thrush, etherealised kookaburra and some
not so easy to identify. A. H. Chis-
holm, who introduced the quarter-hour’s
entertainment, suggested to the radio people
years ago that the lyrebird should be broad-
cast, but that fell through, chiefly owing to
the difficulty of inducing the singer to per-
form at an advertised time. However, the
Dandenong recording, already referred to,
was broadcast by 2UW, also with an intro-
duction by Chisholm, and it will probably
be turned into a gramophone record. It is
the most captivating movie short that
present writer has ever heard.

Whenever a concert audience breaks in
with applause at the end of allegro or an-
dante cantabile, an infamous crime is sup-
posed to be committed in the' ears of the more
musical, or, at any rate, more knowledgeable.
When it happened in the course of Grieg’s
Sonata in C minor at Sydney Town Hall
last ,week Balokovic politely called a halt,
tapped the pianistic Baron on the shoulder,
and together they did the bowing turn which
is as graceful as anything else in their grace-
ful performance. The very-musical sniffed,
craned its necks and otherwise registered its
well-bred contempt. Quite rightly. Music
should not be interrupted in this way. It
has its purple passages, its exquisite
moments like all other poetry, but it is also
a whole, to be enjoyed as such. Very good.
A little later Balokovic’s bow burst a fiddle-
string part way through a fairly short item.
Balokovic dashed off, returned with another
fiddle, indicated to the Baron the place
where the interruption had occurred, and
played on from there. In this case the
ultra-musical applauded with enthusiasm.
It deserved applause as a nice example of
economy. Its artistic merits seem a little
more doubtful. But Balokovic’s fiddling as
a whole does not. In spite of the struggle
playing appears to be to him, music comes
from his fiddle with uncommon ease. Addi-
tionally, he has a rugged personality that
improves with acquaintance.

St. George and the Dragon,” had a success-
ful try-out at a gathering of the Melbourne
Music Club at Kelvin Hall. The plot is
a . delightful bit of fooling; the musical set-
ting sincere and sound. The nonsense was
reminiscent of the T.O.Y. shows, for the
audience had to imagine much, including
that the actors were yokels and the scene
a barn, that the King of Egypt arrived upon
a prancing steed, and so on. St. George
was represented as a swaggering gentleman
who, slew not only the dragon but a Turkish
knight and a giant, swaggering a bit more
after each victory. He hobnobbed with the
Egyptian king, and won the king’s daughter
by liis prowess. There, was also a kindly
Father Christmas fussing around with the
query, “Is there a'doctor to be found?” and a
medico materialising to resurrect with his
huge bottle, of “allecumpane” all the corpses,
who,. after repudiating ' the demanded fee,
all joined joyfully in the folk .song and dance
which rung down the curtain. Mr. Hart’s
music .catches the atmosphere very cleverly,
though, owing to the size of the hall, the full
weight of orchestral score was not used. The
six players, Lennox Biewer, Alan Brudenell,
Harold Malins, Ray Harding, Colin Mac-
Rae and Eric Jones, possessed good vocal
powers and a keen sense of the humor of
the work. There was also a first perform-
ance of “There and Back,” a one-act
operatic skit, by the German Paul Hinde-
mith. These amusing musical pieces will be
repeated at the Town Hall International
Gala on August 7 and 8.

day night Jessie Masson further demon-
strated her capabilities as a pianist. The
Concerto No. 2 in G minor of Saint-Saens
gave her plenty of scope for expressive play-
ing, and, for exhibiting the delicate charm
of touch which was a feature of her earlier
recital. The orchestra supported her well
most of the time, but there were shaky spots.
The Beethoven Symphony No. 5 in O minor
was missed by the latecomers. It opened the
programme, and doors were closed until it
ended. A bit of Russian flavor was given
the second half of the programme, with the
Rimsky Korsakov overture “La Grande
Paque Russe” and the beautiful cantabile
for strings from the D major quartet pf
Tschaikowsky. “Shepherd’s Hey,” by
Grainger, completed the cocktail.

J. Beresford Fowler: The Melb. dramatic
critic, in his notice of the revival of my
play, “Greater Love” (B. l/7/’3l), says:
“One of the improvements was the resigna-
tion by the leading man of the part of
‘Tiger’ Miller, the heroic Anzac, and his
appearance as the ex-schoolmaster, Jace Far-
quhar.” As a matter of fact, through un-
toward events, I was forced to double the
two parts mentioned. I thank the critic
for his unwitting tribute to my make-up.
Seldom has it so completely baffled him.

LIFE INSURANCE SUPPLEMENT.
HOW LIFE INSURANCE
BEGAN.
What was in the mind of William Gib-
bons when in 1583 he went among the
underwriters at the Royal Exchange in
London and invited them to take a risk
on his life nobody now knows. All that is
certain is that William Gibbons wanted
£383 6s. 8d.—a large sum in those days—if
he should die within 12 months; and he
got the risk covered for 8 per cent. Even
his age we don’t know. The policy was
signed by 16 underwriters for various pro-
portions of the risk, and presumably Wm.
“Perhaps he knew he was racing Death.”
Gibbons went on his way happy. Perhaps
he had a presentiment; perhaps he knew
that he was racing with Death and that
the Scythe would beat him on the post.
At any rate, he died just before the policy
expired; and then the underwriters disputed
the claim because, they said, lunar months
were meant and not calendar. But the
Courts brushed that pretty little defence
aside, and the money was paid to the
beneficiaries.
No doubt others tried to do what Wm.
Gibbons did—up to a point, at any rate—
but there are no printed records of the
transactions. In 1699, however, some enter-
prising person, who probably would be called
a go-getter nowadays, struck an idea. He
promoted an association of 2000 healthy
members who undertook to pay ss. entrance
fee, Is. quarterly for expenses, and ss. on
the death of a member; and for these con-
tributions each was to be entitled to £5OO,
less 3 per cent., on his death. The scheme
was successful for some years. But obvi-
ously there were drawbacks to this flat-rate
assessment .plan; for the age of the member
was not taken into account.
At that time there were no tables showing
what expectation of life a person had at
various ages. There were registers of births
and deaths; but they were veiy imperfect.
It was only in 1821 that even a census of
Britain was first taken. In England the
first man who attempted anything in the
way of a life table was John Graunt, and
he was a haberdasher. His interesting
compilation purported to show “how many
of a hundred die within six years, how
many the next decade, and so on for
every decade till 76 years.” That was as
far back as 1661. But John Graunt’s table
was more interesting than helpful; and no
practical use seems to have been made
of it. Much later Halley’s table was pre-
pared. Looking around for data, Dr. Halley,
the distinguished astronomer, decided that
Breslau, in Germany, kept the best vital
statistics, as we should call them now, and
it was his expectation of life table, known
as the Breslau, which the Equitable Society
of London used in 1762 when it proceeded
to be the pioneer of life insurance. Later,
numerous tables were compiled, based
always on local knowledge; and thus
we have the Northampton table, probably
the first of any consequence compiled in
England, and the Carlisle table, the latter
so painstaking and covering so wide a range
of data that it was used for very many
year’s, and is still quoted.
But the new “associations for the distribu-
tion of losses” took a long while to become
popular; and Australia was over 70 years
old before it attempted anything of the
kind. And even when in 1849 the A.M.P.
was formed it regarded itself as only a sort
of friendly society; it had no capital, so its
handful of members were, their own insurers.
But it had either a great deal of good luck
or good management in the selection of
risks; for it did not have a claim for nearly
four years, and by that time it was quite
well able to meet its liability. Had there
been a run of claims early in its career the
story of this fine old society might have
been very different; indeed, there might not
have been much of a story at all, and life
insurance in Australia would not have had
its splendid start. As it was, at the end
of the first five years, the A.M.P. had only
226 policies in force.
Ten years later the Victoria Life and
General Insurance Co. was formed. But
that was quite different; it had some shai’e
capital and wealthy backing. But it never
became popular; the mutual principle, as
embodied in the Sydney institution, had
made a strong appeal to the people. But
there were great difficulties in the way:
how could a mutual office, without capital,
get a start, and how could it be sure of
weathering the first few years of its life ?
This stood in the way-until the tremendous
enthusiasm of Colonel Templeton overcame
all obstacles and the, National Mutual
was born in 1869. Thus encouraged, the
Australian Widows’ Pund was formed in
Melbourne in 1871, the Colonial Mutual in
Melbourne in 1873, the Temperance and
General in 1876 (those were the days of the
great teetotal revival) and the City Mutual
in Sydney in 1876.
Then arrived a man with a very large
vision; and his name was James Patrick
Garvan. He believed that a co., properly
handled, could give as good bonuses, as a
mutual co. and still make a profit for its
shareholders; and he saw, also, that the
share capital subscribed would be an extra
protection for the policy-holders. He was
well known in business and in politics (he
was twice a Minister); and he had no great
difficulty in launching the Citizens Life Co.
That was in 1886, and it was the opening
of a new era in Australian life insurance.
The success of the office—very gradual at
first but greatly accelerated later—pre-
sently received very material assistance
from industrial assurance, a branch of the
business which the Prudential of London
had pioneered in 1848. The Citizens
acquired a small ready-made industrial busi-
ness from the City Mutual; and, favored
with a succession of exceedingly capable
managers, it has done so well both for its
shareholders and its policy-holders that at
least 30 companies have been registered
during the past 20 years to attempt to do
what the Citizens (now the Mutual Life
and Citizens) has done. The M.L.C. divi-
dend, which for many years stood at 90
per cent, and is now 100 per cent., has no
doubt been the magnet to draw much capi-
tal into these cos. Most of the subscribers
were soon to discover that it was not the
co-operative form of insurance which was
responsible, for the M.L.C.’s great success:
it was the brains behind it, combined with
a unique opportunity.
A few, of course, blessed with more capi-
tal or more experience or higher ideals have
survived and are going the right way. Con-
spicuous among these are the Australian
Metropolitan, registered in Queensland in
1895, with a good industrial connection;,
the A.P.A. (Australian Provincial Assur-
ance), with a paid capital of £357,028, which
got on the rocks in its early years (it was
born in Sydney in 1912), but was rescued
by the tremendous efforts of its new chair-
man, E. S. Paul, and now has nearly three
millions in net tangibles; and Assurance and
Thrift, registered in Sydney in 1909, the
infant and special care of W. R. Dovey,
one of the most cautious of Sydney actu-
aries. " -
Mutual and proprietary offices work these
days in harmony, each realising the merits
of the other. Indeed, / there is probably
more harmony between them than there
once w T as between the mutual offices. Thus
you will find in the ’seventies the National

smallest investor in Australia can command
the assistance of the country’s highest
authorities on all investment matters. He
can command as much attention, moreover,
as the rare and infrequent millionaire.

“You simply continue making the deposits, and the £2OOO will be
payable at your death, together with bonus additions from the
commencement of the contract.”
“But surely this Guaranteed Income of £2O a month would cost a
lot of money f”
“No. , For a man like yourself, aged 35 next birthday, only sd.
a day is added to the premium for an ordinary £2OOO policy. For
a younger man it is <iven less.”
“This Guaranteed Income of £2O a month would save my wife the
worry and risk of investing my life-assurance money. Is that the
idea f”
“Yes. If your wife invested £2OOO safely she would receive only
5 p.c. or 6 p.c., whereas the M.L.C. Guaranteed Income policy
would give your wife a return of 12 p.c.—a regular monthly cheque
for £2O until your present youngest child is grown up.”
“And then my wife would receive £2OOO cash?”
“Yes. When your children are grown up, £2OOO will be sufficient
to provide for your wife’s personal needs during her old age.”
“It would he a great relief to me to know that my wife and children
weve guaranteed an income of £2O a month if anything happened
to me. But supposing I live to a good old age, how could I get
the benefit of my regular deposits with the M.L.C. ?”
“At 65 years of age, or thereabouts, you could transfer your policy
to an annuity, which would give you a guaranteed income for the
rest of your life.”
“I read in the ‘Bun’ that the M.L.C. had a very good year's
business during 1930. How did you manage it?”
“Because efficient management keeps our expense rates low and
our bonuses high. Another reason is that people appreciate
the. safety of our investments, which are spread throughout the
British Empire. The M.L.C. is the first Australian Company to
specially feature this Guaranteed Income Policy, which has become
very popular in Great Britain and America.”
“I would like to own a £2O-a-month Guaranteed Income Policy,
but my income is much smaller than it was. We are having a
hard time to meet expenses.”
“You find it hard to meet expenses with your present income;
but, if something happened to you, could your wife earn enough
money to give your youngest boy the education he needs to give
him a fair start in life?”
“No. I’m afraid my wife would be in serious difficulties if any-
thing happened to me.”
“If you make up your mind to save the premium each week, your
wife will never be faced by these difficulties. To make it easier
for you, because of present conditions, the M.L.C. will accept
monthly premiums until business conditions improve. Does that
solve your difficulty?”
“That is exactly what I want.”
“Then I shall arrange for you to be examined by our Doctor, to
make sure that you are still eligible to receive one of these
£2O-a-month Income Policies.”

and he knows that on a given date, or upon
a certain event which he doesn’t care to
think too much about, a given sum will
be available. He knows also that a sum
called bonuses will be added to the given
sum. He knows further that the money
he pays in is invested; and sometimes
when he sits down and figures it out he
thinks that perhaps he could do just as
well himself: if he paid in so much every
year, then at 5 or 6 per cent, compound
interest he would have so much in 40 years;
and the offices don’t promise him that
much, even with bonuses added to the
face value of the policy. The young man
who can give his wife and children (born
and unborn) a guarantee that he will live
for 40 years and that nothing will ever go
wrong with his investments during all that
period can afford to insure himself in that
“Liable to slip ingloriously
on a piece of orange-peel.”
way. Nobody
'else can. And
the young man
who gives such
an. assurance is
liable to slip
ingloriously on
a piece of
orange-peel at
the very
moment he is
telling h is
wife that he
is complete
master of his
fate. The
a s t o n i shing
thing that the life office does is to hand the
widow the full face value of the policy even
though her husband should be killed within
a few days of the issue of the policy, and
after paying only a few pounds or even
shillings. No other investment in the world
can approach that. How can the insurance
office do it?
Well, the founders of the office find out
three things: (1) How long may a person
of a certain age be expected to live? In
other words, how long, on an average, do
persons of that age live? Fortunately, the
world has been keeping records for many
years, and it has those figures for almost
every country. (2) How much must a
man pay in per quarter or per annum to
reach £IOO in 10, or 20, or 30 years, or
whatever the period may be which a man
of his age lives, on an average? (3) How
much would it cost per cent, of premiums
to run a life office?
As to No. 2 you will have to assume
something. If your instalments earn only
3 per cent., obviously the money will take
longer to reach the £IOO than if they earned
5 per cent.; so in making up its “premium
tables” the office has to fix on a rate of inter-
est which it thinks it will be able to earn
right through. The lower the rate of inter-
est assumed, the higher the premium re-
quired to produce £IOO in a given time.
The “office loading”—that is, the contribu-
tion for expenses—has to be added to that
premium.
Now the human factor comes in. The
office adopted a table of the average length
of life to be expected of men at various
ages. But by careful selection of those offer-
ing, you may weed out the bad “risks,”
and thus you may bring up your average by
years. Now that means a lot. It means,
first, _ that you have perhaps 25 annual
premiums from the average of insurers at
a certain age instead of 23: that is to say,
you get two more premiums than you
figured on and also have two more years in
which the acumulated premiums earn inter-
est. These extra collections and earnings
provide bonuses.
Also a certain rate of interest was assumed.
But if a higher rate is earned, then obviously
there will be a surplus. This also is avail-
able for bonuses; good offices also put some
of this surplus ■ into a contingencies fund
of one kind or another to make good any
losses the office may incur through an
investment here and there turning out
badly. Profits made on the sale of invest-
ments are also available for this reserve
and these bonuses.
Finally there is the amount which has
been incorporated in the premium to pay
office exes. If these exes, can be cut down,
the part saved will also be available for
bonuses.
In some countries it is compulsory for
the policy-holder to draw his bonus in cash.
We don’t do that here. Our offices say:
“If you want the cash, you can have it.
But if you don’t apply for it (and we
advise you not to), the amount will be used
to buy paid-up insurance. That is to say,
a certain definite sum will be added to the
face value of your policy.” In 1899 a small
investor decided that he could afford a
policy for £IOO, involving premiums of about
£2 9s. a year. When he died last year he
had paid in all £75 19s. in premiums. The
bonuses, built up as described, amounted to
£9l 165.; so that for his £75 19s. his widow
got . £l9l 16s. And she would have got £IOO
plus whatever bonuses had been earned up
to that time had he died soon after the
policy was issued.
This is how even the smallest policy-
holder gets the benefit of the experience
and knowledge of experts in the business
of investment. But he gets more than that.
He gets the safety of ’“spread risks.” A
small investor must put all his eggs in one
basket: he hasn’t enough eggs to put in
half a dozen places. So if there is one
failure he loses all. When he trusts one
of the great life offices his money i s invested
in a thousand different things, and the
failure of one of them scarcely matters
at all.
HOW LIFE OFFICES HELP THE
UNFORTUNATE.
For many years after life insurance was
first introduced, the policy-holder was not
entitled to withdraw from the contract
without forfeiting the premiums he had
paid; and Australian offices are said to have
been the first to adopt a new and much
more liberal practice. At any time after a
policy has been issued, an ascertained
amount ought to be in the hands of the
office towards the total which must be paid
when the policy becomes a claim through
death or maturity. A good many people
who want to draw this reserve or surrender
value after paying in for a few years are
disappointed with the amount they are
offered. They calculate what they have
paid, reckon up roughly the interest that
this money should have earned and want
to know why they get, in the case especially
of a young policy, so much less than the
total amount their calculations have
reached. They forget two important things;
first, the cost of getting the policy and
managing the business; second and more
important, that had they died within a few
months of the issue of the policy the full
amount of it would have been paid, even
though the premium paid might not have
covered the cost of canvassing for ‘the
policy and the medical and other expenses
of issuing it.
It is to the great advantage of the
policy-holder that insurance business is not
a gamble. If it were, there would always
be a danger of the policy-holder being
unable to get his money. The whole
business is run on such lines that every
event which it is humanly possible to anti-
cipate and provide for is anticipated and
provided for, so that the policy which be-
comes a claim at the most remote date
may be as sure of getting the full amount
due as the policy , which is paid out this :
year or next. The only difference between
the policy which becomes a claim early and
that which becomes a claim late, is' that
the latter gets the advantage of the bonuses
added to the value of the policy during
the longer life of the policy: ...
Other practices have been adopted gener-•
ally to meet the special needs of individual
policy-holders. In some cases altered cir-
cumstances make it impossible or incon-
venient for policy-holders to continue
payment of the premiums. In such cases
practically every office, while urging the
policy-holder to make an effort to continue
the premiums, will issue a fully-paid-up
policy for the amount which the reserve
or surrender value would reach, with
interest accretions, by the time the policy
matures or when it may be expected
(according to the expectation of life table)
to become a claim. Various offices adopt
somewhat different methods of computing
both surrender values payable in cash and
the amount of the paid-up policy; but the
foregoing is the general basis of calculation.
In other cases, to meet special circum-
stances, offices will use the cash value of
bonus and eventually the surrender value
to keep a policy alive; in still other cases,
where ready money is wanted and there is
a hope of presently paying off the debt,
“With a lighter step and a loan.”
the policy-holder deposits his policy and
an IOU, and marches off with a lighter step
and a loan. The latter may reach, at its
maximum, the surrender value; though bor-
rowing to anything like that extent is
discouraged.
COMMUNISM AND THE LIFE
OFFICES.
The greatest mistake J. T. Lang ever
made in his political life was when he either
broke the N. S. Wales Government Savings
Bank or allowed it to go broke. Up to
that time the campaign against “the great
financial interests” had been going along
swimmingly. Somebody had once more
dug up “the goods standard,” and had got
“the great financial interests” nicely mixed
up with the gold standard, so that the said
interests were made to carry all the sins
ascribed to gold. Also they were made
responsible for most cases of hardship in
Australia, because nine times out of ten the
sufferer is pretty sure he could have pulled
through if only he had been able to borrow
a few pounds more or a few thousands more.
So the great financial interests were finding

dependents through unpreparedness, or the devastating inroads of

The P. & C. provides just such protection, and gives, in addition,
the extra benefits of co-operative assurance, the safety of a solidly-

WISE is that young wife who puts this question to her husband until
he answers it with a cheery “Yes.”
Adequate life insurance is a source of comfort to man and wife it is a
builder of confidence and character—it lifts anxiety from their shoulders
and gives them the right to live caret-free.
Let us give a concrete example. Here is the state of a policy of a man who
decided in 1890, when he was 3 7 years of age, to invest a sum equal to
I 1/6 a week in an A.M.P. policy:——
Sum assured . . • • £lOOO 0 0
Bonuses to 31st December, 1930 . . . . 1257 4 0
Total sum assured . . . . £2257 4 0
Are YOU covered to that extent? Thousands of men will leave double
that sum to their families, but the man of moderate income who does this
much can look every man in the face, and feel that he has done his duty.
Let us show you how little it will cost you. Write, telephone or call on

themselves thoroughly disliked and the
camouflaged Communists were beginning to
get in splendid work on behalf of the
“social revolution” —and then Lang either
broke the bank or let it break! It was,
as we have said, a shocking mistake: it
reminded tens of thousands of people that
they were capitalists, too, and that it was
the aggregation of their savings which con-
stituted the great financial interests; that,
in short, instead of the great financial inter-
ests being fat millionaires with faces of
brass and hearts of chilled steel, these

nity. Many a
plain citizen
who thought
he was cursing

preparing t o
tear him to
rags must have
felt very
bitter when he
found that the
“bloated capi-
talist” whom
he had been
deluded into
attacking, was
no other than
himself.
It was par-
ticularly
necessary for the camouflaged Com-
munist to proceed circumspectly in
Australia, because nowhere else in the
whole world has the savings habit
been more widely practised. Towards the
end of the Great War there was tremendous
activity in certain centres of Europe, includ-
ing Britain, organised by the handful of
people who had just successfully launched
the Russian Soviet Republic. One Australian
politician who happened to be in London
was “felt” as to the prospects of Revolu-
tion in Australia. He had with him the
figures prepared in those days by Ivnibbs
for the Commonwealth “Year-Book.” He
produced the statistics relating to Savings
Banks and Life Insurance Offices. “That
is the sort of country Australia is,” he told
them. In other lands the liberator of the
people may mount his soapbox and cry:
“Awake! Arise! Join in the Great Revo-
lution! What have you to fear? You have
nothing to lose but your chains!” “Oh,
haven’t we?” the owners of the 4,937,428
savings bank deposits in Australia will
reply; and the same mocking answer will
rme from the holders of the 889,521 ordi-
ary and 1,564,081 industrial policies in
oistralia (figures from the “Official Year-
•ook of Australia, 1930”).
Some people have grown very nervous
bout Communism in Australia. They point
•ut that experience has shown that a mere
handful of well-directed enthusiasts can
get control of millions: it is said that less
than 300,000 Communists imposed Bolshev-
ism upon the hundred millions of Russia.
But those millions had, in fact, nothing to
lose, and at least were told that, they had
something to gain—a share in the plunder,
for instance; especially a share in the great
estates. By one ruse and another astute
and unprincipled tacticians may bring Aus-
tralians right up to the edge of the preci-
pice.' But they will not get them to
plunge over. A man does not throw his
savings bank pass-book or his insurance
policy into the fire so lightly as that: the
tremendous commotion which very properly
followed the closing of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Savings Bank the other week shows
how precious to the small investor are the
few pounds he has managed to save. And
what more natural when we remember the
tremendous sacrifices which the saving of
those first few pounds entails!
Nevertheless, there is perhaps not a life
insurance office in Australasia which has
not received many anxious inquiries from
policy-holders during the past few months.
Was the whole world falling about their
ears? Would they wake up presently to
find themselves in the same position as the
depositors in the Savings Bank of N. S.
Wales? They had been making provision
for their own old age or the widowhood of
their wives and the dependency of their
children. Wasn’t it all a mistake? Hadn’t
they better take the surrender value before
the crash came—take it and make the best
use they could of it?
We have already discussed what are the
chances of great trouble coming to us
through the country passing to the control
of the Bolsheviks. In one State, perhaps
two, they might momentarily seize posses-
sion—if the public did not wake up in time.
But beyond that the thing has not the
smallest hope whatever: to believe anything
else is to believe that these millions of
savings-bank depositors and life-insurance
policy-holders set no value upon their pos-
sessions. And, as we have said before, what
followed the closing of the State Savings
Bank of N. S. Wales shows that the defen-
sive fury of the disposessed property-owner
is almost in inverse ratio to the size of the
possession: the smaller it is the more zeal-
ously will it be defended.
INSURANCE IN BAD TIMES.
That man is fortunate who hasn’t friends
who thought they were “comfortable” two
years ago but to-day are struggling to keep
their heads above water. In 1928 they
believed their families were reasonably well
provided for. This one had built up a pro-
gressive business from which he was obvi-
ously drawing handsome profits. To-day
he is hard at work keeping the doors open.
If he can weather the storm he will, he
believes, be quite comfortable again; mean-
time he knows that if he should die the
whole thing will go to pieces and his family
will be in want. Another one, in a fair
salaried position, had put all his savings
into shares. If he died the family would
have to realise some of the scrip in order
to live, because the cos. have ceased to pay
dividends. And every share sold would have
to be sacrificed. A third, who owned a
cottage and several vacant allotments, mort-
gaged the home to build a second and a
third cottage, each being in turn mortgaged;
and all his savings have gone into the
reduction of the debt. He is still in a job,
and keeping up the interest; but hardly any
rent is coming in. If he should die he can
see the family losing not only the two cot-
tages which he had intended as provision
for old age, but the family home as well.
In general, a man feels utterly helpless
in these circumstances. He has been caught
in the wheels of circumstance, and is being
flung where they will.
You have awakened in the middle of the
night to remember that the fire insurance
on your home has run out. To-morrqw,
first thing, you will pay the premium. It
was never so important that nothing should
happen to the home as it is during this
night. If the place should be destroyed,
you would be utterly broke, your family
homeless, with nothing to buy so much as
a stick of furniture. If, however, you can
get through without accident till ten o’clock
to-morrow, the garden will bloom again.
That is the position of tens of thousands of
men to-day. If they can only hang on till
the depression
lifts! The fear
that haupts
them is that
they may not
be able to do
it.
The man
who has made,

insurance pro-
vision is the

to-day. When

ness” meant. In the ordinary course
of events this two hundred, or five hundred,
or thousand, as the case might be, would
not be payable for another 20 years. But
behind. that comforting thought was the
still more comforting thought that, if the
claim should be made to-morrow, the full
amount of the policy was there, ready,
waiting. The bonus notice which had
reached. him meant not only that the
amount of the policy with all past bonus
additions was available, but a new valu-
ation had shown that, in spite of every
adverse circumstance, profit was still being
made to be added to the heap.
And this door to happiness is not only for
those who have been wise enough to well
cover themselves by insurance in the past.

for a substan-

Mr. Lang or
the vacilla-

Those things
are serious
still, of course,
but every
minute wasted
does not seem now quite so important—
quite so fearfully loaded with tragic possi-
bilities.
HOW TO SELECT AN OFFICE.
There are, broadly, two types of office—
the purely mutual and the proprietary or
co-operative. The mutual office has no
shareholders; and this means that it has no
share capital. This cuts both ways. While
it has no share capital to support its poli-
cies, it also has no share capital to feed with
dividends. In the mutual office there are
no shareholders to make a definite contract
with policy-holders: under no circumstances
can policy-holders get more than they have
themselves, as a body, paid in, plus interest
on the funds and profit on the sale of
investments. On the other hand the funds
of an office may grow so large that any
practicable share capital might offer a very
small protection. Still, whatever the capi-
tal may be it is available to the last farth-
ing to ensure the fulfilment of the contract.

The question of management is perhaps
more important. The contention of the
proprietary office is that those in control
have a direct financial interest in seeing
that every possible economy is practised,
and that the risks and the investments are
well chosen and the latter well handled.
The shareholders cannot get any profits for
themselves on ordinary policies unless they
make, as a rule, five times more profits for
: policy-holders. On the other hand, it is
possible that those in charge of a mutual
office may take such a pride in their insti-
tution that the spur of direct financial in-
terest in the profits may not be missed.
That is the point which those who have to
weigh the appeal of these two types of
office must consider. And they must con-
sider further whether the direct financial
interest in profits or pride in the office is
the more lasting; also that those who are
connected with the proprietary office may
have the same pride as the othere. Finan-
cial interest does not always, however, pro-
duce good financial * results, they will
observe. For one thing the owners, though
they may at the outset be intimately con-
cerned in the management, are apt' in course
of time to be less concerned with it.
Then there is the question of stability.
You may know fairly well what the posi-
tion of an office is to-day; but it is as
important to know what it is likely to be
10, 20, perhaps 50 years-hence. Past record
. is of value here; yet not of supreme value.
One office with a brilliant past may be
making much less real progress ; than- an
office with a limited past or one not wholly
attractive. If the present management is
good, is continuity of good management
reasonably well assured? How does the
reputation of the office stand—because if
the reputation of the office is not high it
is not only certain to find business-getting
expensive, but lapses and consequently
waste excessive? And is the reputation im-
proving or is the office slipping in that
regard? Generally you can tell by noting
how its costs, and especially the costs of
getting new business, are shaping; upon
these costs The Bulletin’s “Wild Cat”

any considerable part consist of such items
as “promotion expenses,” “goodwill,” of
“extension of business account”? If there
is. any such bad item, especially the last, is
is still increasing, dr is it being reduced?
Further, is the office keeping its busi-
ness, or does it go to the great expense of
capturing business only to lose it after a
year or two? Most offices—all that are
worth considering— set out their income
from renewal premiums and their income
from new premiums. The income from
renewal premiums for 1929 ought to be
the renewal premiums for 1928, plus the
new; premiums for that year, less the pre-
miums that have been lost through the
maturity of policies. You can get a rough
idea of what those lost premiums should
be from the claims. If year after year re-
newal premiums show little improvement,
notwithstanding all the premiums on new
business, especially in the case of a young
or comparatively young office, you can be
pretty sure that too many policies are being
surrendered or forfeited.
Finally there is the question of the net
cost of your insurance. Net cost is your
premium less the rebate in the shape of
bonus—-not the reversionaiy bonus, but its
cash value. No honest office can or will
guarantee future bonuses: so you must
decide for yourself what they are likely to
be. Here an old office has an advantage.
It is probably doing as well or thereabout
as it ever will; the jmunger office may do
much better—or, again, may not.
In _ comparing “table rates” at various
ages it is well to observe also whether what
is quoted is “age next birthday” or “age
nearest birthday.” On a large policy the
difference may be quite important.
HOW TO SELECT A POLICY.
All underwriting or insurance is based
on the law of averages. Wherever an aver-
age can be ascertained covering a suffici-
ently wide range of experience, there the
underwriter finds work to do.. The differ-
ence between underwriting and gambling
is that the former aims at distributing
losses. Nobody knows whether it will be
his house or another’s that will be burned
down. By coming together and pooling
contributions the many who escape reim-
burse the few who are caught. In life
insurance those who live into middle and
old age help a little to provide for the
dependants of those who fall in their early
years.
It is this problem of providing for the
earlier years of married life which sooner or
later presents itself to three-fourths of our
human males. Their earnings are not yet
large, and they have not had time to lay
by much. And here is a young wife with
perhaps two or three helpless children
around her. If the wage-earner should be
taken, the young husband can see tragedy
“The earlier years of married life.”
ahead; In such circumstances his proper
course is to get the highest possible insur-
ance cover for the money he can spare for
premiums. He will have the choice of
ordinary and industrial policies. If he can
.trust himself or his wife to save up two or
three shillings a week for three months, and
to go on doing it, he will take an ordinary
policy. At least one-fourth of the industrial
premium is spent in commissions and other
charges beyond those which an ordinary
policy has to bear.
Then the “table” will have to be con-
sidered. The great majority of the policies
in every office are whole-life or endow-
ment :. the former payable only at death,
the latter at some specified age—so, or 60.
or 65 are . the commonest —or previous
death. The young man who wants the
largest possible cover for his money will
take the whole-life policy: the premium
per cent, is the smaller.
Later on, when you are rounder of
stomach and the children are getting out of
hand, you will look at the world differently.
You will see then the wisdom of putting by
a little more than you have done for the
comfort of yourself and your wife, if you
should both live pn into old age, or for the
comfort of the sole survivor. Hence you
may then invest, in an endowment policy,
the benefits falling due at 60 or 65.
Still later the thoughts of probate and
succession duties may begin to trouble you
—as well they may. For consider wliat
may happen, unless special provision is
made. A man well known to The Bulletin
died in August, 1929, having made a will
some years previously. He had no cash
investments, and the only insurance policies
had been on endowment tables and Had
been paid. The estate was valued for
probate at the high levels then prevailing.
Before the 28 per cent, of the estate required
for the payment of duties could be realised,
values had begun to fall rapidly. But the
tax did not fall; the values charged upon
were the values at the date of the man’s
death, and approximately 60 per cent, of the
estate had to be sold in order to slowly get
in the duty.
Faced with contingencies like that the
man who has made some provision for his
dependants, but, like most men, has it in
what he believes to be solid investments,
will find himself considering the same
problem he struggled with early in life-
how to get the greatest cover for the least
money. All offices will give him a whole-
of-life policy if he can pass the necessary
medical test; some will offer him a policy
with an endorsement that the benefits shall

Driven into tHe Cold Snow
by a Harsh Father
If it isn t a harsh parent who’s doing the driving, and if the cold snow is
falling on the heights of MT. BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK—WeII, there’s
more cause for exhilaration than despair in such an experience.
Still, on reflection, no one ever needs to be driven into the snow at Buffalo,
, while the harshest and most brutal father would soon be mellowed into a
gently tolerant frame of mind by the invigorating joys of skating, ski-ing,
falling off toboggans, sculpting Epstein-like snow-men and hurling snowballs
at unsuspecting guests.
A big reduction in the winter tariff at The Chalet has brought the cost of a

ABORIGINALITIES
SUPERSTITION.
“So your husband didn’t come back the other day?”
"No, he would, go out, though I told him Friday was always an unlucky day in our
“0.W.W.”: Henare, charged with ill-
treating his bad-tempered wife, dozed during
a lengthy oration from the lady’s counsel,
and awoke in time to hear the peroration ot
an appeal for more conciliatory treatment:
"Don’t you think that method would be far
and away the best?” “Too right,” agreed
Henare dreamily. “Far an’ away. Tat te
pest pracedyhen she aroun’, orrite.”
“Bong Tom”: “Bad Austra-
lian” (B. 24/G/’3l) lias con-
fused the puddling-trough with
the “long tom,” from which it
differs as to construction. The
“tom” is fashioned out of sluice-
box boards and sheet-iron. Sides
and one end are made of boards,
and the contraption is tapered to
a point at the other end, to which
boiler-plate, canted up to a pitch
of about 30deg., is nailed. The
“tom” is used for working larger
parcels of wash than the cradle
will dispose of, and may carry
half .a dray-load. The water run-
ning in at the top end from a
pipe or sluice-box flows over the
wash, agitated by a tomming
shovel, and the dirt is carried
out through lin. holes punched
in the iron. The gold gravitat-
ing is retained in the stuff left in
the “tom,” which stuff ?s panned
off in the usual way.
“Cedbee”: Bendigo occasion-
ally receives surprises as the re-
sult of portions of the roadway
disappearing from view. In the
early days roads were built over
abandoned workings, and as the
planking covering them rotted
sections of roadway have fallen
into shafts often 2000 ft. deep.
The latest subsidence occurred in
Pall Mall, directly outside the
post office. A heavy cream wag-
gon was drawing from the kerb
when the driver felt the left back
wheel sinking. He accelerated
and just managed to clear the
spot as the surface collapsed,
leaving a large opening. At first
it was thought to be an old shaft,
but examination found it to be
a circular brick well full of
water, 10ft. in diameter and 40ft.
deep. It has not been in use
since the ’fifties, when the water
was sold to the diggers.
'*FY7”: I fancy Clancy of the Overflow
and his mates would gaze at each other with
a wild surmise if they could be introduced to
the gadget used for urging cattle onward
at the Brisbane River abattoirs. It has been
found that the whip bruises the beef and
spoils its appearance to the expert eye, so
the gentlemen ushers, are now furnished
with a slender rod, electrically fitted, known
as an “electric touch.” Applied gently to the
rearward portion of a bulky beast this has an
instant effect, while no harm is done to the
rump steak to be. It seems a humane
innovation, but one trembles to think of
what will happen to the army of mugs if
the Randwick and Market-street “touchers”
get to hear of it before the spring meeting.
“Willeroo” : An amiable visitor to country
houses is the sugar or burglar ant. which is
about the size of the soldier ant but lighter-
colored and stingless. It is set up ou long-
spidery legs and wags a big head. It hops
in about teatime, climbs the table legs, and
IN THE WAY.
“Well, Jacky, no luck—no fish there to-day, eh?”
“O-ho, Boss, plinty fish; but too much plurry water.”
runs nimbly over the cloth in search of
sweets. Once it has sampled the sugar-
bowl or the jam-dish, or tasted the dregs in
the teacups, it will come regularly to tea,
and bring its cobbers along, too. I was
having tea in a bush hut one night, when a
dozen big fellows arrived simultaneously and
joined in. I was going to brush them off,
but the old chap in charge said, “Don’t
touch them; I like their company.” He
removed the eatables, but sprinkled some
sugar ou the table for his guests. “There
you are,” he said; “wire in.” Then he lit
his pipe, and sat watching them interestedly
while he smoked. In that way he has found
amusement in many a lonely hour. The bur-
glar is the only ant I know that is about at
night. Like the moth, it is attracted by
light.
* * * *
“Runa” : With the opening up of the fiord
country in the far south-west of Maoriland
ornithologists are hoping that some adven-
turer may chance on a specimen of the
rarest of M.L. birds, the notornis, called by
the Maoris takahe. Only four have been
secured, the last as long ago as 1898 ; it
brought £250. This giant swamp lien, flight-
less and therefore an easy prey for dogs,
grows to a height of 2ft., and is a hand-
some bird with a peculiar melancholy cry.
“Swinglebar”; One of the best perform-
ances of the Cobb and Co. men was that of
George Wiggins, who drove the first four-
horse coach from Melbourne to Woods Point
diggings over the unopened Mf. Matlock
country. In view of the fact that the only
road over the range was a sheep track, George
Watson and Dr. Nash wagered for and
against the achievement, the bet being as to
whether Wiggins would get through in 25
hours. Wiggins left Melbourne at six in
the morning, changed horses seven times on
the run and finished before seven next nighc.
It was a hard drive, but its hardships were
mitigated when he was handed his cut of
the bet —which was the first he heard of it.
“Larrapinta”: “Barangkali” is astray on
the subject of bee-battles (B. 24/6/’81). Wild
bees seldom rob. The worst robbers are
highly-pedigreed Italian strains, which are
frequently a bright yellow color. As long
as a good supply of honey is available these
bees work splendidly, but as soon as the flow
dwindles the mischief begins. Scouts soon
locate a colony which doesn’t guard the hive
entrance properly, or is too weak to do so.
In an amazingly short time a concerted
attack is made, not only upon these hives,
but upon the house where the honey is ex-
traded and any wild swarms in near-by trees
Soon every hive is th scene of a pitched
battle, while buzzing clouds surround the
honey-house, tanks and blocks of beeswax.
The robber bees even invade a man's tent
and start upon the sugar, jam and honey
upon the table. In fact, the whole apiary
goes mad, and the noise can be heard hun-
dreds of yards away on a still day. The bee-
keeper has to race from one hive to another,
closing the entrances down to a single tiny
gap, just big enough for one bee to enter by
or leave, and then go away and leave the
crazy little insects to calm down. To give
an example of what this robbing can be like,
a lad I know went to an immense amount
of trouble to get an apiary together by cut-
ting wild swarms out of trees and putting
them into standard hives. A fortnight later
the honey flow ended suddenly. Italian bees
from an apiai’y over a mile away had
attacked his black colonies, killed all save
a few of the workers and stolen every scrap
of honey.
* * * *
“Melos”: Re the “petrified pig” mentioned
by “C.A.8.” (B. l/7/’3l), animal and veget-
able matter is subject to the action of
minerals such as iron pyrites, phosphate of
lime, silica and calespar. Dissolved in water
these minerals penetrate every cavity of the
structure, with the result that a perfect stone
model is substituted for the original. In
some cases even the most delicate parts are
preserved without any signs of decay pre-
vious to or during the process of petrifac-
tion.
“Koolonga” : If “Centurion” (B. 24/6/’3l)
would re-read my par. of 17/6/’3l the
grin might fade from his face. I wrote that
amongst military remounts are horses with
pacing blood, and said nothing of outright
pacers, as he asserts. If ‘‘Centurion” cares
to visit the Sturt-street remount depot in
Melbourne, Sergeant Mack will show him
horses that prefer ambling to trotting. The
“polo-playing, hunting British cavalryman”
—my family numbers two of them —knows
too much about the type of thoroughbred he
rides in those sports to think of using one on
arduous active service. On a campaign a
horse carries about 20 stone, and has to
cover from 20 to 30 miles a day. Such work
wears both man and hoi'se down, and the
light-legged, racy type of horse affected by
officers for parade chargers would not stano
the strain. It is then that regiments are
remounted with horses of the heavy-hunter
type, or weight-carriers with a dash of trot-
ting or pacing blood in them. The experi-
enced usually choose the latter. Finally, tlm
statue of Haig endeavors to represent him
as a soldier, not as a polo-player or a fox-
hunter.
FOGARTY’S.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The weary week of toil is o’er. From galling
chain and collar freed,
Down where the sluggish river flows, the
placid working, horses feed.
Church hells are ringing in the town, and
cross the fallow fields there comes
A breeze that stirs the stately pines and
rustles through the sugar gums.
And yonder past the homestead gate, with
merry quip and laughter gay,
A group of riders canter by, and as I watch
them on tlieir way
I think again of other years and friends with
whom I used to ride
On Sundays down to Fogarty’s, along the
Thompson River side.
A man of wealth was Fogarty; his flocks
and herds were good to see,
While no one in that generous land excelled
his, hospitality.
And every Sunday "twas the rule for all
who lived the district round /
To come in force to Fogarty’s, and all who
came a welcome found.
Then, while the old folks took their ease, or
bartered tales of yesterday,
W r e younger ones could always find diversion
in a different way.
And by the pleasant river’s edge, or ’neath
the shady pepper-trees,
Full many a fond romance was born on
Sundays down at Fogarty’s.
In laughing crowds we gathered there on
many a summer afternoon ;
A different tale there was to tell when riding
home beneath the moon.
For two by two we cantered off, but soon
the horses slackened down,
And life seemed good and beauty kind along
the track to Cowwarr town.
But. that was in the long ago, and far afield
since then I’ve ranged.
The passing years must take their toll; per-
haps by now the scene has changed.
Old customs die, our fathers’ ways are
scorned in hustling days like these ;
Yet all I have I’d freely give to ride again
to Fogarty’s.

MONEY-SAVING FAMILY
COUGH MIXTURE RECIPE.
Hero’s a wonderful money-saving recipe
for a family cough mixture that is equally
good for children and adults, and is. far
better than any made-up cough mixture you
could buy. Order from your chemist or
store a two-shilling bottle of concentrated
Heenzo. Add the Heenzo to Sweetened water,
according to the easy directions on the
bottle, and you will have a supply equal to
eight ordinary-sized bottles of the usual
ready-mixed cough remedies that would cost
up to £l. Heenzo does NOT contain any
poisons or harmful drugs. Therefore, it can
be given with perfect safety to the youngest
baby. You will be delighted with the -speedy
way HEENZO soothes sore throats, eases the
chest, and banishes coughs, colds, croup,
influenza, bronchitis and whooping cough.
Always have Heenzo ready in the home for
the first sign of a cough or cold. Remember
an ounce of prevention is better than a tqn
of cure.*
“Cooramin”: A police census of the abos.
around the Barrier Ranges sets the number
of full bloods at 175. When I was knocking
about The.'. Corner a few years ago there
were groups of sturdy fellows all over it.
One celebrity was Pat Tommy, said to be
the plumpest Binghi in the State. He was
so bloated that he was incapable of travel-
ling on foot, and when the camp shifted
he had to be deported on a wheelbarrow.
He was expensive to feed, as he could stow
away as much as an average family. Jacky,
one of his keepers, conceived the brilliant
idea of making him pay for himself. At the
annual race meeting at Tibooburra he
wheeled Tommy to the back of the publican’s
booth and stowed him in an old tent with
a sign in front: “The Aborignle Gient,
6d.” A visitor now and again went in to
view the Colossus, and while he was in the
NO ALTERNATIVE.
REV. PENALLACR “Does your daughter trust in God, Cap’n Trevithick?”

tent Jacky dived for the bar with the 6d.
Before the races were over there were two
“aborignles” on show —the fat one and a
sleeping beauty.
“Pen E. Short”: It is cheer-'
fill to hear (B. 17/6/’3l) there
are no unemployed on Kangaroo
Island ( g/j § it isn > t quito
true. There are two or three
families in Penneshaw (the
smaller town) on rations, and
things are worse in Kingscote.
(They’re always- worse in
Kingscote.) The single men
have kept off rations, so far,
but one at least took a “tucker”
job for four or five weeks. As
for yacca-gum—at £4 a ton it is
not considered a paying pro-
position, and there has been
very little done until recently,
when the price improved. “Mug-
wump’s” theory that anyone
can go out anywhere and cut
gum is a bit astray. It per-
vers.ely persists in growing on
leasehold or freehold land, and
the owner employs cutters at
£2 a ton or thereabouts, which
doesn’t leave him much after
paying for carting, bags, ship-
ping, freight, etc. Still, we are
better off here, I believe, than
anywhere else in S.A., rejoicing
as we do in an assured rainfall
and a soil that allows the culti-
ration of side-lines. Most of ns
farmers are living on side-lines
at present.

“Up North” : Lady Frog is a
quaint female who lays her
eggs en masse caked in jelly as
a floating delicacy for hungry
fish. Sometimes she banks her
depository among the reeds,
where burglars in the form of
tortoises and birds enjoy it.
Her hardy relatives who dwell
in country where it rains once
in a blue moon plant their trea-
sures on. moist • clay beneath any
F oll * or decaying log or clog
°f -fossilised manure, There
• the eggs abide the pleasure of
flip season tbp
waiting all ready and nippy for
a slippery liop-away in the wet.
Which explains why when it
rains in dry northern parts
every claypan is alive witli tad-
poles as if they had rained from the sky.

“Old Gira”: New Guinea miners are ex-
periencing a trouble which afflicted theib
Papuan forerunners —robbery of their camps
by runaway indented laborers who have
taken to the jungle. According to a radio
from Rabaul, two of these bushwhackers
made things so hot that a Government patrol
was sent against them, for they had not only
been robbing white miners but committing
the much more serious offence in the eyes of
THE CATCH IN IT.
DOCTOR: "You're progressing very well. Another week and we’ll make a new man
of you.”
MACTAVISH: "Aye, but hoo will ye be sendin’ the bill to?”
N.G. officialdom of stealing from native
gardens and philandering with native ladies.
The patrol shot one, and he tumbled over
a precipice “and was killed,” as the report
naively states. It almost seems a pity to
have wasted a cartridge, since, as the Irish-
man said when he brought down a rocketing
pheasant, “the fall alone would have killed
him.”
* * * *
“Running Rein”: The Gagoola case (B.
8/8/'3l) recalls the disappearance of the
imported stallion Blair Athol in the 1870’s.
The owner, J. T. Tindall, offered large
rewards for the valuable beast, but in vain.
Later its remains were found in the ranges
near Merriwa, a district once famous for
horse and cattle lifting. Another instance
was that of Cranbrook, lifted from the Hon.
James White’s Ilavilah stud. After some
time, he returned as mysteriously as he had
gone, and to this day the simple inhabitants
of the locality will show you the gorge in
the mountains where he was “planted” and
employed as a sire. For years the country-
side was full of unmistakable Cranbrooks,
many of them getting away with good money
at country meetings, though they were
entered as “sire unknown.”

“E. Swan” : Once upon a time we had a
gin named Nancy to do the rough work of
the house and help with the washing. She
was industrious, but she would never stooji
for anything that she could pick up with
her toes. She was more adept than the
average abo. at this trick, and with her
toes she could inflict a nip like the claws
of a crayfish. Sometimes. she had to go
into the paddock for firewood, which she
packed on her head and shoulders, passing
each stick up from foot to hand. Her head
was commonly employed for carrying heavy
burdens. Many a time I saw her, balancing
a bucket of water on her head, step over
logs and pick up objects from the ground
with her feet, without once putting a hand
to the bucket. She carried buckets of bush
honey in the same way, while she had a
loaded dillybag slung over her back, and fire-
stick, spears and other things in her hands;
and still she could pick up objects from the
ground without unloading anything. But
Nancy came to grief once. She was gathering
sticks in the dusk, and inadvertently picked
up a black snake. She hadn’t lifted it many
inches before it swung round and bit her
on the leg. With a wild whoop she scat-
tered the wood and raced for the camp,
where remedies were promptly applied. She
always refused afterwards when asked to
get a few sticks after sundown. “Too late.
Missus,” slie would say with a vigorous
shake of her black locks. “Stick cobbon too
much like snake now.”

“Cygnis” : Northern Westralia provides a
more striking example of the initiation of a
white man as a member of an abo. tribe than
the affair instanced by “E.K.P.” (B.
3/6/’3-l). My nomination is Sydney Hadley,
who, single-handed, managed an abo. mission
on Sunday Island, one of the group compris-
ing the Buccaneer Archipelago at the head
of King Sound. Commenced in 1897, this
mission was conducted by Hadley at his own
expense until 1903, when it was sub-
sidised by the Westralian Government.
Mr. Hadley, in obedience to “the all things to
all men” apostolic injunction, became a pro-
perly initiated member of the tribe to which
lie ministered, successfully enduring the
triune test of hunger, exposure and mutila-
tion.
* * * *
“Te W.” : Over 40 years ago the “Detroit
Free Press” advised Australia to supply the
world with canned rabbit. “The moment the
rabbits find they are expected to be useful,”
the Yankee scribe sagely observed, “they will
begin to die off. If Australia finds the can-
ning process profitable she will immediately
discover that rabbits are the hardest things
to raise in the country.” lie concluded with
a claim for a reward of £25,000, which; he
said, was offered in Australia for an effec-
tual plan of extirpating bunny. Well, we
can rabbits, and exported £340,000 worth of
them last year, but bunny, blast him, doesn’t
care a rap.
* =i= :|! ■<!
“Mauri” : If silver is not legal tender for
debts of over £2 (B. 27/5/’3l), a lot of
illegal business is done in New Guinea.
There all native wages are paid in silver,
amounts varying from £3 to £9. Any native
who tendered a note would be accused of
stealing it. Public servants on out-stations
are often paid as much as £2O salary in the
same medium, and I have personally wit-
nessed the payment of hundreds of pounds
in rolls of shillings for land. Cartridge cases
are the most common substitutes for wal-
lets ; the wooden packing-boxes hold about
£2OO nicely, and swung on a pole make a
g».od load for two hefty carriers. The
“fusee,” or roll of 100 shillings, is common
currency, and it speaks well for the general
honesty that these are accepted without
breaking or checking except in a bank. The
name is derived from the close resemblance
to a stick of dynamite.
BALLADE OF THE RICH YOUNG
SQUATTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where is the eligible parti ,
The absolutely ideal beau
That: fluttering femininity
Appraised so high in the years ago;
He whose credentials brought a glow
To the heart of many a marriage-plotter
(“Such an excellent match, my dear, you
know”) ;
Where has he gone to, the Rich Young
Squatter ?
The dashing captain you still may see,
Though he’s fewer of feathers fine to show ;
The pale young curate still sips his tea;
The barrister comes to court, and so
Does the rapidly-rising medico,
While the also-rans in the offing potter
Where suits are urged and romances grow.
But what’s become of the Rich Young
Squatter ?
There was never a favorite such as he ;
Where maids their hearts and their hands
bestow
(Our lady novelists all agree)
He had but \his handkerchief to throw.
Hero of story and song, heigh-ho!
Whoever he wanted for wife he got her.
With his pride of birth and his stacks of
dough,
He’d the world at his feet, the Rich Young
Squatter.
Prince, nought remaineth in statu quo,
Old orders change and old idols totter.
As well inquire where is last year’s snow
As where he’s vanished, the Rich Young
Squatter?

Inspired by the above, the Sydney

Landlord and Tenant Case.
Mr. Henry Drain, M.P. (Master Plumber),
with his mate, Mr. Art Solder, appeared for
the landlord in an interesting case yesterday.
Messrs. Commish were the instructing house-
agents. A defective batli-lieater was charged.
A defence of contributory negligence was
entered, and Mr. Drain began bis cross-
examination.
Mr. Drain, M.P.: “ ’Ow long’s she bin like this ?”
Tenant: “Ever since we came here.”
Mr. Drain, M.P.: “You’ve ’ad the gas on with the
water off.” (To mate: “Am I right, Art?”)
Mr. Art Solder: “Course you are, ’Arry.”
Tenant: “Don’t talk rot.”
Mr. Drain, M.P.: “Well, I’ll see what I can do.
•Tust run back for me tools, Art.”
(Proceeding.)
- Another Henry Parkes?
We hear on the best of authority (namely,
his own) that Mr. Henry Drain, M.P.
(exclusive photo inset), intends to forsake
plumbing for politics in the near future. He
will stand either as a Nationalist, Country,
Labor or Independent candidate, according
as prospects of publicity seem brightest. Mr.
Drain is at present appearing for defendant
in the Haberfield cause cdlebrc, Moggs v.
Woosh, a cistern matter.
An M.P.'s Analysis.
The Man About Town found genial
“Harry” Drain in analytical mood regard-
ing the censorship last night. The purport
of “Harry’s” remarks was that, while so-
called hot stuff might be all right for them
as liked it, and while he had no time for
those what interfered with the people’s legi-
timate enjoyments, yet as a prospective legis-
lator he felt called on to protest in the
strongest terms against anything savoring
of vice. (N.B. —See powerful signed article
by Mr. Drain in next Sunday’s issue entitled
“A Master Plumber Bares Ilis Soul.”)
“Music Hath Charms.”
If there is one member of our art-loving
community more fitted than another to
decide the vexed question of whether or no
Balokovic is alike greater as a violinist
than Paganini and as a yachtsman than
Lipton, it is surely our veteran concert-
goer and sailing expert, “Harry” Drain,
M.P., known at the Press Club as “the
gossip-hound’s friend.” “I wrote the song
beginning
I’m a plumber, a master plumber—
And a very handy man in winter or ih' summer,”
he admitted modestly over the ’phone last
night. “Also the limerick ‘There was a
young plumber of Lea.’ It might interest
my public to know.” he added, as an after-
thought, “that my grandfather wrote ‘Tom
Bowling’—erroneously attributed in some
quarters to Dibdin.”
A special article by Mr. Drain on the
inevitable relation between Balokovic’s vir-
tuosity with the bow and with the some-
what similarly-shaped tiller will appear on
our leader page to-morrow.
The Plumber’s Code.
From an address by Mr. Drain, M.P., to
the N.S.W. Plumbing Society :
Our noble and honorable calling, like that of the
Bar, is governed by a rigid code. Plumbers scorn
to advertise. 10-2-4

THE N.S.W. LOTTERY.
The creation of new capitalists being
anathema to the Lang Planners, some novel
features will be in-
eluded in the State
Lottery. The venture
is to be registered as
a no-liability con-
cern, and in the
allocation of prizes
the goods standard of
the Lang Plan will
strictly apply—ex-
cept for taxation
purposes.
First prizes will
thus be worth nomi-
nally £5OOO, but
under the compulsory
conversion provisions
winners will be given
the choice of taking,
instead, a hogshead
of o.p. vodka or a
fortnight deputising
for the Governor at
Boy Scout rallies.
Second prizes
(nominally worth
£1000) will be ex-
changeable for either
an order to view
Jock Garden’s bolt-
hole at the Trades
Hall or a year’s free
subs cription to
“Hansard.”
Third prize money
of £5OO will be con-
vertible into another
lottery ticket, or
double dole for a fortnight.
Arrangements will be made for the con-
version of dole tickets into lottery tickets
and vice versa.
Pawn tickets for sums over 10s. will also
be accepted, but under no circumstances will
lottery tickets be issued on the strength of
State Savings Bank accounts.

NAVAL ORANGES.
“A scheme for sending 10,000 eases of Australian
naval oranges to Canada every month is being con-
sidered. ’ ’—“Sun.”
The naval orange is cultivated on the
crosstrees of hearts of oak by jolly tars
who have been given the pip. In these days
of retrenchment the pip is a regular issue
in the Navy, so there should be an excep-
tional crop this year. The bulging aspect
of sailors’ jumpers
when ashore is due
to naval oranges.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Tons of Money” (British Dominions)
has been put on the screen exactly as
the Walls-Lynn firm played it at the Ald-
wych. Lynn and his wife, Yvonne Arnaud,
live in a pleasant English country house —
the sort that is just big enough to carry a
butler. Amid hailstorms of bills comes a
notification that a wealthy relative has died
in Mexico City, leaving Lynn a life-interest
in the estate. A method of bilking the
tradesmen —a popular sport in upper-middle-
class England, according to British stage
theory—has to be devised. It is formulated
by the resourceful wife. Lynn vanishes in
an explosion, is accepted as dead, and re-
appears disguised as the new heir. The
whole farce consists of similar material
skilfully exploited along traditional lines. It
turns out in the end that after the Mexican
Government has exhausted its claims on the
estate only a few shillings remain. This
production adds another to the series of
works of art which Sydney Lyceum has
offered, and for which it seems to find a
steady public. It is as different from the
kind of thing Hollywood turns out as London
is from New York. There are no purse-
proud sets. With a couple of insignificant
exceptions the whole action takes place in
one room which, unlike most movie-rooms,
looks as if it was lived in. The company is
as good as usual. If anyone stands out it
is Mary Brough as an aged aunt.

Sydney Capitol offers for a modest fee this
week the renowned Long Tack Sam, one of
the biggest and best orchestras in the city,
“The Cohens and Kellys in Africa” and
Richard Arlen and Mary Brian in “Gun
Smoke.” The writer makes a practice of
avoiding the Cohens and Kellys. A matter
of taste. But cowboy pictures have all the
appeal of old-time bellowdrama. The placid
sameness of their plots is mentally restful.
There are a couple of trifling innovations
in “Gun Smoke”: the villains are metro-
politan gangsters instead of rural bad men,
and they try to steal the gold on Miss Brian’s
ranch instead of her cattle. Otherwise all
is according to formula. Eugene Pallette
carries a lot of condition for a hard-riding
cowboy, but they breed a weight-carrying
class of mustang where men are men, and
he makes an effective foil to Louise Fazenda,
the maid, whom he loves though she wears
a beflowered hat with her riding-pants. The
slaughter of the unspeakables which precedes
i he discovery that the hero and heroine
love each other occurs on a mountain path.
Bullets and boulders pour down on them, and
finally, as though to show the Creator’s
opinion of their conduct, half the mountain
becomes detached. Great photography of
its type.

“It’s a Wise Child” (M.-G.-M.), at Syd-
ney Regent, seems to have been mauled by
our censor. It is very ragged; yet it ran
for a year on a New York stage, and it was
directed by Leonard, of “Let Us Be Gay”
fame. However, the censorship can’t be
darned for some of its defects, which are
purely theatrical. For example, the young
man who has been making love to the
heroine for quite a while, but hasn’t noticed
her engagement-ring; and the extremely pri-
vate conversation overheard accidentally in
the street by a gossip, whose approach and
subsequent manoeuvres behind a tree aren’t
noticed by the conspirators. Otherwise the
.show is' good. It has many witty lines, an
all-star cast, the speed of an express train
and some —er —delicate situations. Marion
Davies —looking rather broad in the beam
for the part—is an irresponsible flapper.
Her young brother has secretly married the
family maid (Marie Prevost) while drunk.
James Gleason, comic iceman, loves the
maid. Robert McWade (old, absurd, a
banker) is engaged to the heroine ; she thinks
she loves one of the banker’s clerks, and
Sidney Blackmer (young, sympathetic, her
lawyer-trustee) loves her. The maid is
expecting an infant, and, by the usual con-
catenation of misunderstandings, everybody
is led to believe the expectant mother is the
heroine. The banker orders her to sign a
document ending their engagement and
exonerating him from blame for her condi-
tion. The miserable clerk, believing his boss
is the seducer, offers to marry her for his
job and a bonus. Only the lawyer proves
true gold. In addition to the admirable
mummers already mentioned Polly Moran,
as the maid who takes over when the other
is sacked, and Lester Vail, as a spineless
husband, get a lot of laughs,

Warner Bros.’ “Three Faces East,” at
Sydney State, is a melodrama entirely com-
posed of improbabilities. Here are a few.
Eric von Stroheim is a German spy with
a Prussian manner and a German-American
accent. He is first seen being decorated as
a Belgian officer by King Albert for good
work against the invading Boches. Con-
stance Bennett is an English counter-spy.
She is first encountered at a German H.Q.
dressed as a nurse. She arrives at the home
of the First Lord of the Admiralty, where
Von Stroheim works, as a sort of lady’s
maid. In the garden, concealed under
a couple of bushes, he has a cellar
from which he communicates by wireless
with the submarines of his native land. As
often as an important dispatch arrives for
the First Lord Miss Bennett opens the draw-
ing-room safe, memorises the information
and repeats it to Von Stroheim, who passes
it on to the subs. Eventually she supplies
an item of such earth-shaking importance
that when. Von Stroheim takes his place
at the instrument to relay it to the Father-
land there is nothing for her to do, as a
loyal Englishwoman but shoot him in the
back. Why she should have compro-
mised herself by burgling the safe; why
she didn’t supply the trusting idiot with
wrong information which would have ren-
dered him harmless; why he didn’t do the
burgling himself; why she didn’t have him
arrested when he first admitted his identity;
and why Winston Churchill should be repre-
sented as a senile half-wit —these are some
of the many intriguing mysteries of the
plot. The atmosphere of the period is never-
caught for a moment. But what can you
expect of an English war-picture directed by
a German for Americans?
POVERTY POINT.
“L. de Rideau” : “The Sundowner’s Song."
which was set to music by Fritz Hart and
has become a stock item at community
hymnals, comes from Louis Esson’s “Bells
and Bees.” It was published by the Mel-
bourne Lothian Press, which sent it to Lon-
don to be printed. When the sheets arrived
it was found too late that “The Sundo'wner’s
Song” had become “The Landowner’s Song”!
“C. Ma”; The gramophone isn’t regarded
as a plaything by at least one eminent Aus-
tralian conductor. Bernard Heinze, the
Ormonde Professor of Music and conductor
of the University Symphony Orchestra, does
not despise this humble mechanical hand-
maiden of the arts when preparing to pro-
duce an opus new to Melbourne. Shutting
himself in a room, he puts the discs of the
piece on and respectfully listens and follows
with a baton while leading directors of such
great orchestras as the New York Metropoli-
tan steer their organisation through a ren-
dering. Captious critics might stigmatise
this as an illegitimate proceeding, but it is
surely no different from the case of a painter
studying reproductions of the works of the
great masters.
“Cauboy”: It is gratifying to know that
art can go hand in hand with commercial
success in the theatre. The Rayner sisters,
of the Theatre of Youth, set out from Sydney
in their caravan so stonybroke that when
their petrol gave out they had to give an
unpremeditated performance in order to
obtain the juice to continue. In some coun-
try towns they were well received; in others
the rustics walked out on them, frankly
puzzled. They had a season in Adelaide and
two seasons in Melbourne, and the intelli-
gentsia rushed them to such an extent that
they were able to pay their debts, book pas-
sages to America and then bank something.
“F.S.”: Stage art being ,by its nature
ephemeral, Nellie Stewart missed her only
chance of immortality by allowing herself
to be painted by Mclnnes, not as she was at
the time the portrait was made but as she
used to be. Many a greater artist than
Mclnnes has failed to carry out such a com-
mission satisfactorily; the feeble and senti-
mental picture which now hangs in the
National Gallery in Melbourne was doomed
to oblivion as soon as it was finished.
When the time comes to apply artistic stan-
dards to it, it will disappear into the vaults
where many other once-popular favorites are
mouldering.
“O. Kay”: Producer of the talkie version
of “Charley’s Aunt,” Leslie Pearce, was oppo-
site Gladys Moncrieff in “Rio Rita” here. A
Sydney man (he started on the concert plat-
form as a singer), Pearce has directed sev-
eral American talkies. In the same talkie
the rOle of Jack Chesney is played by an
old friend in Oliver McLennon, of Mel-
bourne, now known as Rod McLennon.
“Lord Luvus”; There is no mystery about
the Holly wooden habit of altering the titles
of books and plays to suit the screen. The
art was reduced to a scientific basis by a com-
mittee of psychologists who drew up exhaus-
tive lists of titles and submitted them to hun-
dreds of theatregoers. The result showed the
relative unimportance of making a title
appropriate to the play and the immense im-
portance of making it suggestive of the deep-
rooted natural desires of the multitude.
Elizabethan dramatists knew this without the
assistance of Freud. Among the plays which
competed with Shakspeare’s for the attention
of the sixteenth-century playgoer were
“Palace of Pleasure,” “The Maid’s Tragedy,”
“A Woman Killed with Kindness,” “Roaring
Girl,” “Lust’s Dominion, or the Lascivious
Queen,” “The London Prodigal,” “The Whore
of Babylon” and “A Mayden-head Well Lost.”
Many of Shakspeare’s titles would have met
with the approval of a moving-picture entre-
preneur—“ The Merry Wives of Windsor,” for
instance, though that has the additional merit
of having something to do with the plot,
“Spokeshave”: There has been discussion
in Melbourne over the risks run by the four
magnificent Australians who have been posing
at Melbourne Tivoli as the “Golden Spartans.”
They are gilded from head to foot, and it has
been pointed out that a child similarly treated
for a religious festival in Rome died before
the coating could be scraped off. Actually
the incident occurred in a novel by Meri-
jowski, not, as far as I know, in real life.
The only effect of the paint is to prevent
the natural heat of the body from escaping.
Probably the Spartans’ lungs work overtime
and counteract any possible ill-effects, while
the pores can still operate to a certain degree
through the thin layer of golden grease. The
quartet are probably in no more danger, in
the winter-time at any rate, than the Mel-
bourne man-in-the-street in summer-time with
his orthodox underclothing, shirt, collar,
trousers, coat, waistcoat and unventilated
bunnyskin hat.
“Marko”: Recently “Bloggs” excused
Cresswell O’Reilly’s rejection of two Eng-
lish talkies for every one American on
the score that the difference is akin
to that between “a roaring vulgarian
like Rabelais and the more genteel but
dirtier-minded Sterne V” The Yankee sex-
stuff, of which we get so much, is crude to a
degree, while its English counterpart is not
only saved but justified by its wit. The whole
question is one of treatment, and is related
to the fact that one person can retail a ques-
tionable story that will produce a deadly
silence, while another can tell the same yarn
and provoke gales of merriment. “The Middle
Watch” is in the latter category, but if an
American producer had handled the same
theme, or that of “Canaries Sometimes Sing,”
the result would probably not have got past
even an American censor. Both “Bloggs”
and O’Reilly should take a course of George.
Robey; they suffer now from a Marie Lloyd
complex.
“C. Ma”: When the State and Regent
were built in Melbourne all the other
theatres, with one exception, hastily remod-
elled themselves. The exception was the
Capitol, built years ago by Burley Griffin,
designer of Canberra. The Capitol is still
architecturally the most up-to-date theatre
in Melbourne, while some of the most recent
atrocities already look old-fashioned. It
is a tribute to the value of paying for ideas.
Griflin had the courage to break away from
tradition, and his employers had the pluck
to back him.

“Kamilaroi”: I submitted (B. 27/5/’3l)

system has provided speculators with the
means of making huge profits from resale

ence of it, progress has been steady and well
maintained. I wonder where the progress
comes in, and what it is worth to the wool-
grower as compensation for its failure to
arrest a slump, unprecedented in our time,
under conditions that, in the opinion of the
highest, authority in N.S.W., have revealed
the presence of an “unquestionably serious
menace to the trade at this end and a very
heavy depletion of stocks at the other.”
“Woolaway” says he believes stabilisation
is possible, but before it can be achieved
what he calls “a certain set of conditions of
World-wide extent must prevail.” One is
left to guess at what is meant. If this set
of conditions is to be established, someone
will have to make the first move to bring
it about. Why not the producer? While
the present marketing system, with its no-
offer-refused policy, is waiting for another
boom to show how good it is, the producer
is being compelled—and, incidentally, ruined
in the process—to produce the best wool in
the world for less than what it could be pro-
duced anywhere else. “Woolaway” again:
“A point that is missed or ignored by those
Who think it should be easy to arrange a
price at which wool should be sold is that
such a deal can only be made when one buyer
agrees to take the whole output.” There
is no necessity to arrange a price at which
wool should be sold in order to protect a
market stricken by panic. And under an
arrangement to restrict bids, evidence of
which “Woolaway” accepts, Australia is
selling its wool already to one man. Numbers
don’t count at auctions if buyers have pre-
arranged a price.
There is a big difference between price
fixation that would dictate to the world the
economic value of a commodity and the
placing of a minimum reserve to prevent a
recurrence of panic. The recent panic was
allowed to overtake the market to such an
extent that it had actually no quotable
level at all. No attempt was made to stop
the ruinous drift. Yet at no time did the
position abroad warrant what amounted to
an abandonment.
According to the latest advices to hand,
general opinion in manufacturing quarters
abroad is that Australian wool was allowed
to become too cheap. As far back as Decem-
ber, when the price level was not within
pence per pound of its lowest point, the
president of the International Wool Textile
Organisation said that the low values then
ruling were not due to the existence of
large stocks. In February, commenting upon
what he described as “a ridiculously low
level,” the same high authority said: “I am
convinced there is room for an advance in
prices.” If there was room for an advance
in prices, and a further fall was allowed to
take place, somebody is to blame; and it
would be to the interest of Australia to have
the cause of such a calamity identified. A
fall of one penny per pound throughout the
season meant a loss of about £3,500,000 to
Australia.
PROTECTING THE LAMBS.
“Liss”: “A.L.P.” (B. 24/6/’3l) is asking
for it if he substitutes mutton fat for castor
oil in his 1 lamb-marking dressing, particularly
if he uses it “uncomfortably hot.” The hot
fat causes the tender tissues of the ampu-
tated tail to blister and makes a home-from-
home for the flies; a neighboring manager
tried it last spring, and the fly-strike was
appalling. Next door (that is, only three
miles distant) I had hardly any lambs struck,
but I went to a great deal of trouble to
clear, up the flies as far as possible first.
For a week before marking I poisoned for
a mile or two round the yards, using a solu-
tion of arsenic and, as baits, sheepskins let
into the ground to form a basin into which
offal from the killing-pen was put. I also
had the yards surrounded by flytraps. Two
days before marking each mob the ewes were
jetted with a 10 per cent, solution of arsenic.
Thousands of flies were poisoned in the
yards, and, wdiat is more important, there
were no struck sheep to attract flies to the
mob. For the marked lambs I used a mix-
ture similar to “A.L.P.’s” castor-oil one,
including a little spirits of tar, and kept it
warm; but I consider the main factor in
the success or failure of a specific is its
method of application. If the lamb is simply
hit, or, as is often the case, hit at by the
tarboy, no good is done; the mixture should
be carefully applied above the butt of the
tail and down each ham a little way, and
on each side of the purse in the case of
wethers. It takes a little longer, but it is
better to go slow at this stage than put
the mob over the rail three or four or per-
haps half a dozen times, to say nothing of
losses and the check received by the sur-
vivors. The big marking tallies were done
when the flies were not a pest, and no tarboy
was needed.
The best weapons the sheepman has in
his fight against the fly are arsenic, used
as a jetting solution and for poisoning baits,
and the flytrap. For the best results they
should be employed in conjunction, but sepa-
rately the flytrap is the more effective, as it
will work all the year round if cared for
and the baits kept reasonably fresh. But
petrol-tins are getting scarce, and traps at
present on the market are too dear. What
is required is a cheap trap so that a great
number may be scattered round the country
at a small expense, and surely one can be
produced for a couple of shillings or so.
When this has been achieved there will be
no need to talk of making trapping of flies
compulsory.
MILCH EWES NOT WORTH WHILE.
“Xerophyte”: To “Jayenne’s” suggestion
(B. l/7/’3l) about milch ewes I return
a definite “No.” It is almost a law of breed-
ing that the development of one sphere of
usefulness is done at the expense of another.
I instance milking- and beef-cattle and laying-
and table-poultry. Each class is a highly-
specialised organism, converting its food
into a certain product. Dual-purpose breeds
are simply averages between the two. Just
so with the sheep; the finer the wool the
poorer the mutton. No merino sheep can
ever be expected to compare with a typi-
cally mutton breed for meat, though I grant
that some plain jumbucks grow a good
fleece on a hefty body.
To attempt tp introduce a third factor
is asking altogether too much of the unfor-
tunate animal. It would be sheerest folly
to try. Leave the sheep to its wonlgrowing.
If we really want a small, hardy producer
of milk there is always the goat. He’s not
a bad little draught animal for his weight,
either.
CHAMPION COWS.
“N.R.M.” (Seattle, U.S.A.) ; I wonder
why Australians haven’t erected a statue
to the world’s champion dairy cow, Melba
XV., of Darbalara. There has been no cow
remotely like her. The great success of the
Carnation Milk Farms might be attributed
in no small way to the publicity given the
champion Segis, the world’s greatest milk-
producer. While it is true that Segis pro-
duced 50001 b. more of milk for the year,
Melba XV., of Darbalara, eclipsed her in
quality by producing 1661 b. more of butter-
fat. This is Melba XV.’s record: 32,5221 b.
milk for the year-16141b. of butter for the
year. She is still the world’s champion
dairy cow ; but Segis has been given so much
publicity by her statue in the illustrated
papers that the Carnation Farms receive
requests from all over the world to supply
them with Holstein-Friesian pure-bred, regis-
tered stock.
The Carnation Farms were started near
the Washington town from which I write,
and now have branches over Wisconsin and
in France. For 1930 their sales of dairy
products and pedigreed livestock amounted to
52 million dollars (say, 10£ millions sterling),
which is mox*e than the total value of all the
butter, cheese and milk exports fi’om Aus-
tralia.
ANOTHER TEN POUNDS PER COW.
“Balemup”: With butter-fat at Is. 3d. an
increase of 101 b. per cow would add
£1,500,000 p.a. to the income of Australian
dairy-farmers; and far greater increases are
practicable in most States. This is one of
the points made in the report of the Federal
Dairy Investigation Committee, to which Pro-
fessors Richardson (S.A.), Wadham (Vic.)
and Murray (Queensland) attached their
signatures, as also did Dr. Cameron, the
Vic. Director of Agriculture, and Mr. L. T.
Maclnnes, N.S.W. Director of Dairying.
Production statistics show that Victoria
gets far and away the highest yield per cow.
The following table shows the States’ average
for five years (1924-25 to 1928-29 inclusive)
in gallons of milk per cow-, converted into
butter-fat and money equivalents:—
State. Milk. Butter-fat. Value.
Victoria . . . . 389 gall. 155.61 b. £l3 2 7
N. S. Wales . . 347 „ 138.8 „ 11 14 3
South Australia . . 340 ~ 136 ~ 11 9 6
Tasmania . . 316 ~ 126.4 ~ 10 13 ,4
Queensland . . 269 ~ 107.6 ~ 9 1 7
Westralia . . 248 „ 99.2 „ 8 7 5
For 1928-29 the figures were: —
State. Milk. Butter-fat. Value.
Victoria . . . ■ 450 gall. 180 lb. £l5 3 9
N. S. Wales .. 326 „ 130.4,, 11 0 1
South Australia . . 353 „ 141.2 ~ 11 18 3
Tasmania . . 359 „ 143.6 „ ' 12 2 4
Queensland .. 297 „ 118.8,, 10 0 6
Westralia . . 277 „ • 110.8 „ 9 7 0
Among districts Gippsland leads with a
1928-29 average of 242.31 b. of butter-fat
per cow. Victoria’s predominant position is
attributed to (1) climatic and soil condi-
tions reasonably suitable for the growth of
pastures for considerable periods in average
years; (2) suitable conditions for produc-
tion of fodders and saving of hay; (3) the
successful application of phosphatic manures
to pastures; (4) herd-testing; and (5) main-
tenance of personal touch with farmers by
means of dairy supervisors.
The committee recommends to other States
the Vic. systems of grade herd-testing and
bull-calf subsidies, and emphasises the
importance of top-dressing, rotational grazing
and fodder conservation. The urgency of
fodder conservation, it says, is greatest in
N. S. Wales and Queensland.
PRAIRIE GRASS BEATS BARLEY.
“Tumbe Munda”: I tried an interesting
experiment in feeding values recently. Hav-
ing two cows that had calved a fortnight
previously, I turned A into a plot of barley
and B into a plot of prairie grass (each was
about a foot high) for an hour and a half
each morning. At the commencement of the
test A was giving 341 b. of milk per day and
B 371 b. At the end of a week the cow on
prairie had reached 401 b. and the cow on
barley had fallen to 311 b.
After a few days more B was still gaining
and A had barely maintained her 311 b., so I
then turned both cows into the prairie. B
continued to gain till she reached 461 b. A’s
decline was arrested, and she gradually
climbed up ‘to 411 b. By that time the prairie
was getting eaten down, so I transferred both
cows to the barley for their morning feed.
There was an immediate decline in the
returns from each.
DO PIGS PAY?
“W.D.Mc.” : They do and they don’t. It
all depends on the man and his environment.
If he has good grazing, plenty of roughage
and a good breed, pigs will pay, and pay
handsomely; but if he has to buy most of
his feed and his stores he will require a
microscope to see his profit. I have made
a lot of money breeding pigs for the other
fellow to fatten; I never made a great deal
out of fattening pigs.
On a property where I was a few years
ago, the people had 50 sows and plenty of
roughage. They spent £5OO purchasing fodder,
and finished the year with a loss of £5. I
cut out the fattening, culled out 10 of the
sows, sold the progeny at from S to 10 weeks
old, and wound up the year with a net profit
of £4OO on an outlay of £6O for feed. When
breeding pigs I always made it a rule to
sell as soon as I could get £1 for him, and
I kept him till I got it. The quicker you
can convert Dennis into money the greater
the net profit.
As to the best breed. I have tried them
all. A long, deep, lengthy Berkshire sow crossed
with a pure Middle York boar gave me the
best results, and the Berk.-Tamworth the
next best. This cross is especially suited to
northern and warm districts. With “Ben-
dee,” I consider Large Whites are a
blot and an eyesore on the landscape. They
ought to be placed on the list of prohibited
immigrants, along with the British Black,
Old Gloster Spots, Poland China, Duroc
Jerseys and other mongrels. They are coarse
of bone, hair and hide, and coarser still is the
meat inside. The Large White has a rough
head with coarse, large ears, a roach back,
hindquarters sloping like the roof of
a house and a drooping tail. You need a
six-feet fence to hold him, as he can jump
like a kangaroo, and you will nearly always
find him in your neighbor’s crop or your
own in the morning; his only virtue, like all
undesirables, is that he is prolific. Any-
way, he is only a passing craze which will
soon die out, as he is not suited to Austra-
lian conditions. I have seen a lot of these
fads come and go in the last 40 years.
SUPER. IN THE LICK.
“Western District’': “Yeomarjs” refer-
ence (B. 24/6/’3l) to the pig-feeding ex-
periments at Roseworthy (S.A.) “as regards
the relative effects of super., rock phosphate
and bonemeal” does not prove that super,
is used in stock licks. And I take excep-
tion to his assertion that super, is decidedly
cheaper than bonemeal. Statements having
to do ’with pounds, shillings and pence mean
much to us cockies at the moment, and
the remarks of “Yeoman” may lead us to
think “decidedly cheaper” refers to com-
parative value as stock foods. It is not
admitted that the two substances can be
compared, but if any attempt is made in
this respect allowances must be made for
the protein and fat content of the bonemeal.
“Yeoman” is informed that whereas ordi-
nary super, (which does not contain any
protein or fat) has mineral (lick) value only,
bonemeal has both mineral and food value.
For use in stock licks super, therefore is
not “decidedly cheaper than bonemeal.”
Furthermore, if pigs fed with super-, under-
equal conditions show 11 per cent, gain
over bonemeal, then all I have learnt about
stock-feeding has been so much energy
wasted, and in my old age I am undone.
“Yeoman” sees no objection to super, be-
cause it is readily available. It is too avail-
able, and it causes the beast to scour.
Bonemeal, on the other hand, whilst not
supplying any water-soluble phosphoric
acid, provides that acid in a form which
U.S.A. and iContinental authorities now
regard as the correct one for all beasts. I
meau to say, bone is bone (not necessarily
tri-calcic phosphate), and super, is not bone,
and it is doubtful whether it will be turned
into bone in the beast. Putting super, on
the pasture and feeding as grass is another
matter.
Speaking to one of Victoria's most suc-
cessful pig-breeders (and exporters) I was
informed that his pigs received a daily
ration of a phospliate-sulphur-salts lick in
which the phosphate was present as meat
and bonemeal. When super, was mentioned
the pigman said, “We have found nothing to
equal or take the place of bone.”
SAFEGUARDS AGAINST SOIL
EROSION.
“Old Toolong”: If I were contemplating
the purchase of a pastoral property 1
should not care how badly it was cut up
by wasbaways. With surprisingly little
trouble such wasbaways can be converted
into veritable reservoirs of fodder-foliage for
the relief of drought conditions. A neighbor
of mine, taking possession of a small pro-
perty, found it cut in two by a washaway
about 20ft. deep and 50ft. wide. Along the
bottom of this he planted branches of weep-
ing willow, which in a few- years tilled that
chasm with a continuous mass of foliage for
the best part of a mile. He thus, at the cost
of a few days’ labor, ensured all the stock
on his property against drought; and what
this man did may be as easily done by any-
one possessing similar places.
There must be many thousands of proper-
ties where absolute immunity from stock
losses could be obtained in the same way
at little or no appreciable cost, besides
converting eyesores into ornaments. Where
these washouts do not carry permanent
water, varieties of the elm which sucker
freely will be found superior, as emergency
fodder, even to the willow, and rivalling
the kurrajong in succulence, palatability and
freedom from injurious effect. The elm,
however, has the defects of its good quali-
ties in that it requires protection against
the incessant attentions of stock if it is to
reproduce itself by suckering.
“E.H.S.” (B. 24/6/’3l) recommends the
poplar. I would rather have one full-fledged
elm than fifty poplars. Nor i.s the safe-
guarding of artificial drains and water-
courses as simple as “E.H.S,” would imply.
If planted as he describes such channels
would cost far more to keep open than
would pay for laying down permanent pipes.
In this matter I can speak from expensive
experience, having had drains filled up from
a depth of 6ft. or more in a few years by
the action of willow-roots. Should serious
scouring take place in any drain it will
usually be found sufficient to put an odd
willow here and there, where big holes are
being eroded.
TREATING THE SICK DOG.
“Back Swallow”: Seldom is any attempt
made to help the sick dog; and yet what
inconvenience can result from your best
worker being out of action! The bitch that
has just pupped deserves the same attention
as a good milker. Look to it that no septic
condition develops. Worms are indicated by
general unthriftiness accompanied by a
voracious appetite, and the hair becomes harsh
and curls forward. Feeding raw liver which
contains hydatid cysts is a prolific source
of infection. Generally, 10 to 15 grains of
areca nut, given after a fast and followed
by a pui-ge, will be found effective.
Wool-eating frequently causes impaction
of the rectum. The dog is out of sorts and
makes futile attempts to evacuate. If the
impaction has been present for a couple of
days, the part will be found swollen and
very tender. Avoid poking about with instru-
ments, but try to reduce the swelling with
warm foments. And introduce into the
rectum some ointment containing adrenalin,
which can be got from any chemist (this
should form an item in the family medicine-
chest). Then give a tablespoon of medicinal
liquid paraffin. This passes unchanged
through the alimentary canal, lubricating it.

contraction of the bowel, causing unneces-
sary and useless pain. Throughout, allow the
dog a free run; exercise is a great factor in
aiding bowel motion. I have employed the
method set out many times and always with
success.
More deaths probably result from poison-
ing than any other cause. If strychnine is
to blame, and you discover the dog before
the convulsions set in, give a couple of
grains of Condy’s crystals in water and try
to make him vomit. But if there is any
evidence of muscular twitching, give large
doses of chlorodyne or chloral hydrate if you
have it. These drugs are antagonistic to
strychnine, and if you appear to be holding
the convulsions in check there is a hope of
success, but the treatment must be persisted
in until the animal recovers. It-is a case
of kill or cure. Arsenic (from poisoned
skins, etc.) produces vomiting and scouring.
Try large doses of magnesia or castor oil and
water. There is a special, antidote for
arsenic poisoning to be obtained from
chemists; I always keep it on hand in case
of human need. Phosphorus (from rabbit
poison, etc.) produces vomitings which smell
of phosphorus. Avoid giving oils, but admin-
ister a few grains of bluestone in water. This
acts as a prompt emetic and coats with
copper any phosphorus that may remain,
thus rendering it inert. Repeat the dose after
a quarter of an hour to make sure. Blue-
stone itself may poison if a thirsty dog laps
at a tin of it in a yard. Almost always it
is vomited at once, but it is well to give
him plenty of soapy water and be sure that
he does vomit.
Watch all wounds of an extensive nature
to see they do not become foul. If bleeding
cannot be controlled, try a plug of cotton-
wool soaked in turpentine. Only as a last
resource destroy the dog; though disabled,
its value as a breeder may not be impaired.
Even so, there is many a dog stumping about
on three legs doing excellent yard work.
SPURS V. LATERALS.
“Disc Harrow”: One of the commonest
errors seen in the pruning of apples and pears
is the failure to get the fruit back close to
the leaders. Some growers deliberately train
long laterals for fruit-bearing, and I have
heard it advocated as a protection against
“pigface” ; but in any pruning job I prefer
to aim for the production of short spurs.
A long lateral is naturally thin and bears
its fruit at the end, which means swaying,
bruising and increased loss from windfalls.
Spurs, on the other hand, hold their fruit
firmly, and because they are close to the
parent limb they set a crop of even size.
Furthermore, a tree shaped on this plan can
be kept clean with the utmost economy of
spraying material, and can be pruned in less
time.
An apple such as the Five Crown gives no
difficulty, as it runs naturally to short spurs.
With a variety like the Rome Beauty there
is often a tough problem to face, especially
when the tree is inclined to run to wood.
But as soon as any lateral has borne fruit, it
is only a matter of time and care to shorten
it back, and produce a well-buddecl, branch-
ing spur close to the leader. When a lateral
is cut to a fruit bud. the straight run-through
of sap is stopped, and buds lower down are
forced out. By following this method year by
year the whole tree is brought into bearing,
and long lengths of non-producing‘wood are
eliminated.
The Jonathan, when young and growing
strongly, will often produce shoots up to 18in.
in length in one year’s growth. These must
not be shortened right back at once, but
about Din. should be left. Two shoots will
grow on from the cut, with a fruit bud below
them. If the shoot is not too thick, it can
then be cut back to the fruit bud; but if this
presents a stubby appearance one of the new
shoots can be tipped and the other left, when
more fruit buds will appear.
The general rules to remember are that cut-

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Cure for chapped or cracked teats on milk-
ing cows? —4l36.
Wash the teats with one teaspoon of
lysol to a pint of warm water. Dry, and
apply zinc ointment. If healing is slow, add
10 grains of balsam of Peru to each ounce
of ointment.
An inexpensive method of seasoning case
timber in shooks? —4l4o.
Stack the shooks under cover in a shed
and place sufficient stickers or fillets between
to allow circulation of air throughout stack.
Fillets should be placed vertically one above
the other. If this is not done the shooks
will warp or become otherwise distorted.
What are the symptoms of worms in a dog
and the best way to get rid of them? —434V.
They vary to some extent, depending on
the sort of worms. As a rule, however, there
is a staring coat, the ribs are showing and
the appetite is capricious. There may be
at times lack of co-ordination, the dog drag-
ging himself along the ground. Fast the dog
overnight, and first thing in the morning
administer a capsule containing sgr. pow-
dered areca nut, 8 drops extract of male
fern, 3 drops oil of turpentine, sgr. sulphur,
igr. calomel. Follow with one dessertspoon
of castor oil. Kennel should be cleansed and
disinfected.
(1) What are the best commercial fer-
tilisers for a vegetable garden? (2) What
are the correct quantities to use, and how
often? (3) Is it possible to harm the plants
by giving too much? Here ( Longreach, Q.)
we have abundant water, plenty of cow
manure, burnt bones and ashes. —4017.
(1) and (2) You don’t need much more to
grow good vegetables, but A.C.F. or Shirley’s
No. 4 (4-11-12), applied at the rate of 4cwt.
to 6cwt. per acre, would improve growth. (3)
There is not much danger of using too much
manure, but young plants should not come
in contact with heavy applications of strong
chemical fertilisers, which would burn the
young roots.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Gordo Blanco”: The quickest rust-shifter
is our own eucalyptus. A bush mechanic
demonstrated this the other day when assist-
ing me to get some seized brake-pins back
into action on a car wheel. Said mechanic
claimed that patent mixtures sold for these
jobs have eucalyptus as their base.
“Kilkivan”: Sulphuric acid, recommended
for cleaning ploughshares (B. 17/6/’3l), is;
dangerous stuff to handle. Spluttering of
it into the face is likely to be remembered
a long time, and a few drops on a pair of
pants will ruin them. If monkeying round
with these acids have a bottle of ammonia
handy as a counter-applicant in case of
accidents.
“Sylvester”: If you are growing such crops
as peas and beans and have no suitable drill,
remove the tynes, except the back two, from
your cultivator, and set the machine to the
required width, and you may open two rows
at a time. Drop your fertiliser and beans,
and drag the soil in lightly with a rake.
“Dimon”: Some farmers have found a
new use for the kerosene-tin. When they’re
making a slab floor on blocks for a haystack,
a tin, with one end cut out, is slipped over
each block. This forms a cap that the
rodents can’t get past.
“Leo . Lear” : The trouble some farmers
have with cows that walk through alleged
fences is their own fault. It is a mistake
to put your one-barb wire in a fence along
the top. Most animals poke their heads
through on the second wire and press down.
Use a plain on top and a thick barb as No.
2. Whatever material is on top the jump-
ing beast will get over it; but the crawlers
object to middle barbs. This specially applies
to netting fences, where the barb is almost
invariably put on top of the posts. Try
it along the top of the netting and see which
is the easier obstacle to get through.
“Mulyan”: What lias surprised me on
many N.S.W. scrub farms is the habit of
burning off everything on the ground that is
to be cultivated, though the farmer drives
right out into the forest country to get fire-
wood. Most of the scrub woods burn well,
and make good furniture, building and fenc-
ing material. A man saves much time and
labor, and economises in other ways, by
cutting up the best of this timber. A few
acres of scrub will provide sufficient durable
material for his barn, sheds, pig-sties, yards
and home-paddock fences; and with the
useful logs and limbs and saplings thus
removed, the burning of what is left leaves
the ground all the clearer.
“Noah Fraid”: In many parts of the Com-
monwealth used heavy oil and the empty
drums may be obtained for next to nothing:
and they are handy things to have on the
farm. A gallon or two of used oil thrown
over a heap of roughly-consolidated black-
berries sets. the stage for a perfect burn
prior to poisoning. As a frost preventive,
used on a fire in conjunction with green
bramble in the shape of a smoke-screen to
windward, oil can easily be made worth its
weight in gold. And here is one of many
uses for drums. Take an empty eight-gallon
one, and cut away half of the barrel,.leaving
the two ends intact. With a few holes
punched in the remaining side of the barrel
(now the bottom) the drum becomes a fire-
grate, which will save mum a lot of clean-
ing up, dusting and whitewashing.
“Golightly”: “Corimba’s” theory (B.
17/6/’3l) that mortality in lambs at Wam-
boota (Vic.) was due to the youth of the rams
is moonshine. A ram is or is not potent;
if he is, he will transmit all the character-
istics of his . race, good and bad. An off-
spring may inherit sufficient faults to pre-
vent its surviving; the age of a sire is not a
fault that can be transmitted. I and many
others have mated six-months-old Dorset
Horn ram lambs with success. This age
is months younger than that of the rams used
at Wamboota.
“Musca”: Two Warren (N.S.W.) men
claim that they have overcome one of the
chief difficulties encountered in trapping the
blowfly—-its tendency to follow the sheep
round instead of visiting fixed traps to
immolate itself. The inventors, Cameron and
Kennedy, have taken out patents for a kind
of miniature pack-saddle which is strapped
to the sheep. On each side there is a pad
soaked in the bait, and this acts as the
trap, poisoning the fly that alights on it.
How the pack affects the fleece is not stated.
In any case different sheep could carry it in
turn, or, failing that, a few worthless old
culls could be turned in with the mob to act
as a sanitary detachment.
“Kripple”: With “Azac” (B. 3/6/’3l) I
agree that a satisfactory sheep-branding
fluid to take the place of tar and remain
legible over lengthy periods has yet to be
discovered; bpt he and others seem to have
missed the point I desired to make. Sale-
yard sheep bought by the butchers—it was
such I had in mind—do not require brands
with the lasting and damaging qualities that
tar provides; for they are almost imme-
diately slaughtered. It may be that some
stupid Stock Department regulation insists
that fresh branding be done for the short
journey from saleyard to slaughter-house;
if so, there is urgent need for amendment
to reduce the heavy losses incurred by the
fellmongers from such cause.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER.
The only noisy thing about last week was
the storm. This was cyclonic and sprinted
past at a rate that rose to 68 riiiles an hour.
It also dropped on' a cowering city more rain
than any other storm since 1889, It swamped
out the canvas towns of the unemployed, arid
brought to light some impressive deeds of
self-sacrifice that would prove material for
Greek drama. Comfortable citizens who sat
warm with a good dinner and firelight
throughout the storm’s worst ravings, and
grumbled prodigiously because the glass
porch was swamped, may well have felt numb
with self-abasement the morning after when
they read of one poor jobless man who was
found in a derelict tent by a rescue party,
striving to shield his three youngsters with
the warmth of his body as well as his coat.
The Playbox, having found out that
Oxford-street is too far out of town for a
theatre, is now busy settling down at No. 8
Young-street. This is so close to Circular
Quay that no dweller on the north side of
the Harbor can claim distance as an excuse
for staying away; and travellers from the
outer suburbs will be landed by tram almost
at its doors. Harry Dangar has painted
a picture for the new home. It is a picture
of Youth —a sort of modern troubadour
standing at gaze outside a stage door, which
bears, of course, the legend “Playbox.”
At least one Sydney woman writer wants
to put on record a vote of thanks for favors
received at the hands of just-retired Town
Clerk Layton. Mr. Layton knew his
Sydney, social and commercial, backwards.
He was a fund of information and a tower
of strength to a scribe in doubt, and his
knowledge was always imparted without any
air of boredom.
Forty-odd years ago, when Sydney women
were still wearing bustles, when skirts were
drawn tight across the front and bunched
up at the back, when tiny hats were tilted
absurdly on piled-up hair, young Bill Layton
got his first job in the Town Hall. He saw
the bustle give place to the much-gathered
skirt, topped by a tight bodice with enor-
mous leg-o’-mutton sleeves (the family sort
of joint before Marie Stopes was heard of).
High busts, tight waists, many petticoats
and skirts that showed never a glimpse
of ankle were the attributes of all the belles
who drank tea at Campanoni’s, and who
fluttered up the Town Hall steps to the
kettledrum in the rooms Sydney Burdekin
had just furnished for his Mayoress. For
Mrs. Burdekin was the first Mayoress to
be provided with a civic background. So
well did her husband buy that nothing has
ever since been renewed—even the lovely
silk hangings on their fat cornice poles are
the originals. About 1895, as young Bill
went hoipe in the summer afternoons, he’d
probably meet a couple of those strange
“new women” creatures astride bikes, tiny
straw hats perched on befringed heads, neat
bloomers topped by a natty blouse, and over
that a very pinched-in-at-the-waist-coat, for
even the new woman wasn’t so unfeminine
as to go corsetless.
How they come and go in memory these
silhouettes of 40 years! Girls dressed
in the Du Maurier manner, or the
more dashing Aubrey Beardsley girl,
iong and slinky, but still well covered.
The Dana Gibson girl, her shirt blouse
belted trimly to a neat waist, her skirt only
ankle-length, her hair done high on a pompa-
dour. Then the pre-war girl, with her fussy
blouses, her tulle neck bows, her boleros, her
fancy stockings; then the post-war girl,
with her short, tight skirts, her rouge,
her cigarette and her unruffled poise. All
nice girls, according to Mr. Layton, hut the
beauties among the Mayoresses were, of
course, Mrs.. Burdekin and Mrs. Riley, wife
of Albaii Riley, head of a well-known old-
time rag firm.
If . any hospital can claim to be popular,
the Mater Misericordise, on the north side of
the harbor, is such a one; and all its ex-
patients and friends should note that its
yearly ball is dated for Thursday, the 16th.
The Warringah Hall is the scene of action.
If these hard times continue, what with
high exchange and one thing and another,
some of Sydney’s grass widowers may be
forced to bow their beads oiice more to the
yoke of domesticity. Said a man whose
wife is in . Europe when he is in Aus-
tralia, and in Sydney when he is in London,
“If business doesn’t improve and exchange
keeps up, I am afraid the wife and I will
have to take up housekeeping again in
Sydney.” So you see the rich, even as the
poor, have their sacrifices to make.
While the storm on Monday night was
nearly lifting the roof off the Conservatorium,
Gwen Selva, in the small hall, lifted the
hearts of her listeners with Hugo Wolf’s
impassioned “To Spring.” Gwen’s soprano
also rang out in songs by Brahms; and the
baritone of Spencer Thomas was heard in
works by the same two composers. Laurence
Godfrey Smith slipped two Bach preludes
into the interval. And when the concert was
over, warm with melody the audience with
grim, set faces prepared to buffet their way
to train and boat through the, raging gale.
In a drab week, Masons of the Scottish
Royal Arch Order supplied a vigorous dash
of color. They held their 12th annual dance
at David Jones’s, arid, led by two sporraned
and kilted pipers in full eruption, a company
of Masons, sword in hand, stepped into the
ballroom. Later again these swords flashed
into an arch when the night’s 27 debs, passed
under them to be presented to Chief Justice
Philip Street and his bright-faced lady. Mrs.
Lewis Packer, who was introducer-in-chief,
wore handsome black velvets topped by a
head-dress of Russian design glittering with
jet and diamente. Over 800 came to this
dance, which was the week’s high-water mark
in revelry.
The Millions Club couldn’t even reach the
century with the attendance at the yearly
dinner dance last week. Only 70 dichards
turned up to the frivol, and over these presi-
dent Arthur Rickard beamed in good fellow-
ship. One of the night’s well-dressed was
Mrs. Richard Chaleyer, who wore trailing
black laces to which a black panne velvet
coat collared in white fox added a sumptuous
touch. The club’s secretarial S. A. Baileys
were among the dancers.
“The Constant Nymph,” on her third
weekly appearance, found a still constant
audience. Indeed, there was again a small
disconsolate company of the “turned away.’’
Tall ushers and usherines in trailing gar-
ments were kept on the run, and in spite of
Saturday night’s temperature ever and again
swiped the moisture from beaded brows.
The small stage of the Savoy with careful
grouping is made to hold the whole of San-
ger’s tumultuous family, besides one selfish
composer, one unselfish ballet-master and
the owner of 15 opera houses, all at. the
same time. It is in this scene that Lina’s
dress reminded one of ail old Tivoli story about
the absent-minded mother who got mixed up
between tlie makings of a dress for her
daughter and the covering for the pantry
shelves, with the result that the
looked like the little girl, while the little
girl looked like the shelves. Winifred Green,
as Florence Churchill, the Sangers’ rich
cousin, wears with successive charm a black
lounge suit, the legs of which are as floppy
as a Jack Tar’s, and a mignonette-green chif-
fon frock, to which shoulder drapes are
gracefully appended; later, a tea-rose satin
frock embraces her fervently to the knees,
whence it sweeps out, first in petulance, then
in melodramatic bitterness, as she accuses
Tessa of stealing her husband.
Clever Moyna Martin, the girl in this
Walker Studio photograph, is one of the
reasons why citizens leave their warm fire-
sides these midwinter nights and journey to
the Playbox.
Moyna is an-
other instance
of Duncan
M c D o ugall’s
disc ernmelit.
He discovered
that this Play-
bo x disciple
had a natural
talent for pro-
ducing, so he
gave her some
comedies and
some actors
and let her go
ahead. She
has presented
such far-apart
works as
“Seventeen”
and “Fallen
Angels.” In
the year just
ended she put
on five plays and two revivals, and now
she is working on “The Dark Angel,” by
Trevelyan. Moyna has also several short
stories and much verse to her credit.
The dance sponsored by the Society of
Women Writers filled the Arts Club with
light and cheerfulness and as neatly per-
fect dance music as the jazzer of this world
can hope to massage the floor to. There
was a good roll-up, and the National Coun-
cil of Women’s fund for the distressed
should be able to keep out the rain for a
day or two with the resulting cheque. An
old-fashioned waltz was one of the even-
ing’s competitions, and was justly won by
Mrs. A. B. Coleman and her partner. Presi-
dent of the society Mrs. Liddell made an
effective mistress of ceremonies, handsomely
cloaked in black velvet; and Theo Cowan
flung the appraising eye Of the sculptor over
competing dancers.
Mrs. Harry Burrell, that great-hearted
worker for charity, and her husband were
the guests of the Dalwood Homes committee
the other afternoon. A couple of hundred
women and two whole men surged into the
smoke-room at Farmer’s for the tea-drinking.
A touch of alcohol was introduced by white-
coated waiters, each with a tray of wine
cocktails, red and golden, balanced on a
strong right arm. You got a cherry with
the sweet and an olive with the dry, so even
the misguided lady who thought the drinks
were on the party, and said she’d have one,
fished out her silver coin without a murmur.
Mrs. Burrell smiled from a seat at the top
table, and Marie Bremner handed her a
bunch of red roses. The Balokovic couple
arrived about foui\ and her hip-length mink
coat lengthened the life of many a shivering
cream-puff by quite three seconds. One sup-
poses that the eye tooth is responsible for
the sex’s difficulty in co-ordinating masti-.
cation with a good hard stare. George Fitz-
Patriek hovered like a guardian angel or an
inspired stage manager about the varying
groups. Concert-manager Claude Kingston
shepherded his star, and Betty Ogilvie, who
worked so well for the Balokovic ball, was
a popular person of the afternoon.
One of the youngest Sydney, clubs is the
Opportune. Its object is to develop the vocal,
and dramatic talent of the adolescent, and
already its membership bristles with embryo
Bcrnh ardts,
Melbas an d
Carusos who
have imbibed
some of the
enthusiasm of
the club’s
founder, Natli-
al i e Rosen-
wax. Nathalie,
who is a Per-
sonality of the
city’s music
world, acted
as Rene Max-
well’s guide
and friend
while that
singer was
studying in
London. It is
in connection
with the
O p p o r tune
that Miss
Rosenwax is running a competition for a
musical comedy, the work of Australian or
Maoriland composers.
Rail Fizelle, back in Sydney after three
years’ studying and sketching along the
highways and shyways of Europe, has a
show in the Macquarie Galleries that is
worth a visit. B. E. Minns was there at
the same hour as this Letter. He was in
rapt contemplation of an ascetic-grey river
scene, while an orchard warm with moist
turned earth and flowering trees riveted the
eye of the mere female. Rah is an ex-
A.1.F.-er with an amazing capacity for work
and a great sense of light. As a dancer, too,
he is in the blue-ribbon class.
King’s School old boys and their best-
girls turned up in force to the union dance
in David Jones’s. There were over 450
dancers, the frocking was up to the moment,
and on president G. W. Ash’s table stood a
flower facsimile of the famous school’s porch
complete with clock set at two. Headmaster
Morgan Baker and his, as usual, well-
dressed wife were among the night’s honored.
The school’s hoary flag waved over all.
This Letter’s old friend John Lane Mul-
lins made a happy reference the other day
to the people who never return books
lent to them; he called them “book-keepers.”
John was introducing Camden Morrisby to
a collection of penwomen, and Mr. Morrisby
was displaying a collection of 200 book-
plates from every part of the world. B. E.
Minns has done some exquisite and aboriginal
book-plates, and indeed almost all Aus-
tralian artists have expressed themselves in
this medium. Ella Dwyer was mentioned
by Mr. Morrisby as a notable designer of
these intimate little pictures. Incidentally,
George Fitzpatrick, of St. Margaret’s, has
probably one of the most comprehensive col-
lections of book-plates in the State.
A supper, table at which this writer sat
last Sunday deserves amention. It was
covered with an old-fashioned damask cloth
dyed faded rose. The small scalloped-edged
table-napkins were dyed crimson, an old red
Yqnetian-glass jar in the centre of the table
: was brimming with pink roses, and there
; were squat silver-branched candlesticks fur-
nished with fat red candles. The soarkling
Moselle was served in tall-stemmed Venetian-
red goblets, and there were rose-pink ices.
There’s talk of Dr. Truby King, the
Maoriland authority on baby welfare,
settling in Sydney. Daughter Mary, a gentle
poetess, is here with him just now, and the
two were lunched by the Australian Mother-
craft Society last week. Through the hands
of Dr. Purdy the members passed on a fine,
piece of Staffordshire pottery ”to the rosy-
cheeked girl.
Cookery books are no longer the stodgy
things of former days. The following gay
opening in a recently-acquired book on
French cooking leads to the details of an
excellent dinner menu;—
You need 200,000 francs. Your idea is not to
earn them but to get them; for you are a man of
the Period. You ask your banker to come to dinner
one evening. He accepts. He has heard that your
wife is good-looking and he is curious to see her
in her own home.
A chapter headed “A Family Reunion,” in
which a ‘‘ prodigal daughter invites her
parents to visit her, and which introduces
a lunch menu, begins something in this
manner:—
Mademoiselle Ginette Castel went through the
usual stages. She began life as an apprentice, and
was promoted to being a mannequin. She then went
on the stage just long enough to be able to mention
the fact on her visiting cards. Her more permanent
profession has been recompensed by a row of pearls,
a car, a flat, a diamond collar and a little place
in the country. Her family dramatically denounced
her when she left home, but is now quite pleased
to receive her invitation.
Would any woman mind preparing a meal
from such an amusing book, even on a grey
day bitten through with a cyclone wind?
Everybody who has heard Dorothy Bruri-
ton in “Dearest Enemy” and “The Duchess
of Dantzic” has remarked on the amazing
development of an always sweet voice. Per-
haps the fact that whilst in Melbourne before
her Sydney season she had a singing lesson
every day from tenor Walter Kirby has had
something to do with the increased volume.
Walter, incidentally, claims the distinction
of giving Florence Austral her first engage-
ment. This was at a sacred concert in Mel-
bourne’s Theatre Royal one Christmas night,
long before a world war was dreamed of, and
when the earth did not seem so inhospitably
inclined to peace on earth, goodwill to man.
A returned tripper tells this Letter that
the stupidest of all the economies made at
Australia House at the instance of Mr.
Coleman, M.H.R., was the retrenchment of
the hospitality officer. He did a wonder-
ful amount of useful work for his £7OO p.a.
Visitors to London who didn’t know the
. ropes, and wanted to see all there was to
be seen at the cheapest rate compatible with
comfort, used to put themselves in his hands
more or less “blind,” and he never let them
down. It didn’t matter what was required—
a cheap trip to the Derby, seats at Lord’s or
Wimbledon, a tour of Scotland Yard, advice
about hotels, flats or rooms in the city or
suburbs —this official invariably came up
to the scratch. He is said to have saved
tripping Australians thousands in income
tax alone, though it wasn’t his job, strictly
speaking, to warn newcomers on the vital
subject. A visitor to England becomes liable
for British # income tax after a specified
period. Th'e Somerset House authorities
have an uncanny knack of finding out when
that period has expired, and a ruthless habit
of taking action.
Brisbane bounces in:—
The Musical Association of Queensland gave an
at-home to Joseph Hislop in Albert House, which
was decorated with wattle and Virginia creeper.
Isidor Goodman came with the tenor, to be welcomed
by Leonard Francis, Victoria Blakey, Gladys Frost
and May Christmas. Victoria. Blakey’s black muslin,
with a poppy and rose design, was made over flame
satin; Gladys Frost wore her favorite jade green,
with a trail of autumn-tinted flowers; May Christmas
was in black mariette. Elspeth Capper played the
violin, Bessie Dougall sang, and Valda Jeffries and
Adeline Colledge accompanied. Deputy-Governor
Blair and his lady and Premier and Mrs. Moore were
among the big audience at Hislop’s opening concert
in His Majesty’s.
Christ Church, Boonah, saw the wedding of George
Mervyn Mundell and Evelyn Evans. The bride, who
was given away by her father, was in parchment
chiffon velvet and Limerick-lace veil. The ’maids
were Beth Evans and Mavis Mundell, in delphinium
blue and beige velour pieture-hats. The reception
was held at Morago, and the ’moon will be in Sydney
and the Blue Mountains.
A bridge and musicale for the funds of the Holy
Name Cathedra] was held in Lennon’s Eastern
lounge, the Mayoress and Mrs. J. J. Leahy being
the organisers. Mrs. Greene was in marine blue and
gold, and brown hat; Mrs. Leahy was in black
and blue, with black hat. Archbishop Duliig pre-
sented the prizes to the winners. Max Aronsten
lifted up his fine baritone and Mabel Comae recited.
The wedding of Dennistoun Vaughan Duigan and
Kathleen Hill took place in St. - Stephen’s, .Coorparoo.
The bride, who was given away by her father, was
in ivory satin with a veil of old rose point. Marjorie
Hill, in crushed rose; Cynthia Duigan, in powder-
blue ; and Mary Hill, in old-gold tosca net over
cr6pe de Chine, ’maided. Pink roses decked Tarran-
gower for the feasting, Mrs. Hill receiving in black
velvet with a posy of red roses.
Mrs. Ellen Terry, who has been keeping her 98tli
birthday at Toowoomba, has seen it grow from a
few slab-and-bark huts to a city. Born in County
Garlow, Ireland, she came to Brisbane in 1859,
and remembers seeing Governor Kennedy turning the
first sod of the Ipswich-Toowoomba railway. She
was married at "Westbrook station, and of her five
children three daughters survive, with 12 grand-
children, 16, great-grandchildren and one great-great-
grandchild. .
At St. John’s Cathedral, John M. Hughes and
Sarah Grace Bennett were made one. The bride,
who was given away by her father, was in ivory
bridal satin, with veil of Brussels lace. Joyce
Bennett and Maud Crawford ’maided in sea-green
mariette. Winifred Bennett, in a period frock of
ivory Chantilly, was flower-girl. The Balmoral
Bowling Club was the scene of the feasting, Mrs.
W. M. Crawford, the bride’s aunt, being hostess.

The second day of the Grand National
meeting was blessed with fine weather,
but the members’ enclosure at Flemington
was not so densely thronged as usual. Mrs.
A. M. Pape, Audrey Chirnside that was,
long resident in London, was there with light
sable collar and cuffs on a black coat and
a touch of pink on her black felt hat. With
her was a fellow-traveller, Mrs. G. Wilder,
who sported a black pony-skin coat and same
colored millinery. Mrs. Manser chose light
grey tweed and felt hat, and Mrs. Dermot
Casey’s tweed suit was worn with a belted
coat. Mrs. W. T. Hunter and Mrs. W. J.
Seymour, also recently returned from abroad,
were in tweed of flecked tints of brown. Mrs.
Andrew Cunningham, in red gown and hat
with a squirrel coat, was another returned
exile. Mrs. Gordon Chirnside, of Carran-
ballac’s pasture lands, wore one of the new
much-shirred velvet hats that, matched her
black cloth costume. Mrs. Claude Palmer,
of Dalvin station, came in Wedgwood blue
tailored suit and same-hued hat. Her daugh-
ter Valerie was with her. Mrs. Featherston-
haugh and Violet Brodribb —they also have
just returned from abroad—Mrs. Bullivant,
of Wirringa (N.S.W.), and Mrs. Walter
Laidlaw and her sister-in-law Nancy Laid-
law, who motored from their home at Eden-
hope on the borders of the Mallee, were other
visitors noted, as also were Mary and
Gwenda Boyd, from Bacchus Marsh. Betty
Fairbairn’s coat of beige-dyed ermine was
the most striking fur exhibit. Among those
who selected black tailored suits with a
touch of pink or white, and looked very
smart, were Mrs. J. H. Moss, Mrs.
Russell Gabb. Mrs. Forbes Mackenzie
and Doris Moffatt. Features of the dress-
ing were the favor shown for. short, close-
fitting hip coats of brown or black caracule
and the prevalence of brow veils —little
bits of black net reaching to the eyebrows.
There is a theory that the function of these
is to soften the hard line of the millinery
of the minute, but the veil is sometimes so
fine and tightly drawn as to suggest a skin
affection.
A week of continued sunshine could hardly
be hoped for, so the most optimistic of us
said “Just what I jolly well expected” when
rain poured steadily down on the eve of the
Grand National Steeplechase, making the
track and lawns of Flemington soggy. Though
by Saturday afternoon the moisture was
drying off a bit, and the clouds showed
signs of lifting, the day was gloomy and cold,
and leaden skies were reflected in the
puddles about the betting-ring. The win of
the last-minute favorite, Rakwool, however,
cheered the spiritual outlook. Wattle-trees
bloomed bravely along the fine drive into the
course, making the only patch of color amid
the shrubs and grass, and wattle decked the
tearoom. Dressing was mostly a matter of
warm coats, tweed, fur or leather, and
goloshes. The wraps covered tweed frocks,
and tailor-made suits, and berets or felt hats
were worn by most women. A few daring
souls took a risk and sported fancy straw
toques of the sort prescribed for spring wear.
Mrs. Percy Blackbourn wore one of the new
models in brown chip straw that harmonised
nicely with her fawn-flecked tweed frock and
coat of minfk fur. Mrs. H. S. K. Ward hopped
her rust-red ensemble with similar millinery.
Mr. and Mrs. R. Vincent, from Geelong,
were there with their daughter Sammy, who
covered her bright blue frock with a squirrel
coat. Mrs. Eric Booth, lately back from
England, wore a long coat of summer ermine
with a felt hat of the same shade. Mrs.
W. R. Burston had with her Mrs. W. A.
Boyd, from Brisbane, and Miss A. Byrne,
of Wangaratta. Mrs. Corrie Gardner was
one of the many who favored tweeds, with a
blending felt as top-piece. Beryl Ainslic was
also arrayed in tweed. Mrs. Eric Harrison’s
red coat and hat made a cheery splash in
the committee ladies’ box. Lieutenant-Gov-
ernor Irvine was there, but there was no
party to occupy the v.-r. pen.
Wearing cherry satin shoes beneath her
lengthy frock of vellum-hued satin, Kath
Walsh attended to the duties of hon. sec.
at the hop of ex-students of Santa Maria
(College, South Yarra, at the Rex. The
president, May Wallace, danced in black
floral chiffon. Lime-green taffeta sprinkled
with pink blossoms was sported by the
assistant sec., Mollie Hart, a sister of the
former sec., Dorothea Hart, who was there
in silk lace of golden sheen. Foncie Wal-
lace, in white satin, and Clare Wood, arrayed
in white taffeta with a touch of blue, made
their debut. Claire Brennan, in fawn chif-
fon ; her sister Laura, in sapphire-blue
georgette with a satin coat to match, and
their cousin Flora Brennan, in a dainty
black net gown with strappings of black
satin, were among the dancers.
Melbourne Uni. Rifles put on a gay hop
at the St. Kilda Plaza, beautified for the
occasion with balloons of blue and black,
the colors of the “shop.” The C. 0., Lieut.-
Colonel J. A. Clarebrough, and Mrs. Clare-
brough, she in black lace, received the guests,
along with the adjutant, Captain L. G.
Binns, Mrs. Binns, who was robed in black
velvet, and the secretary of the dance, J. V.
Gason. Among the guests were Brig.-Gen.
Brand, who was accompanied by his daughter
Lorna, in rose-pink taffeta, and Brig.-Gen.
Poott. The dancers were mostly young folk,
and there was a gay display of pretty frocks.
The new spring millinery is here, but it
isn’t a bit new—merely a revamping of old
styles. The fine-wove straws, the chip straws
and those that look like gelatine cut into
starry pieces are mere revivals, and there’s
nothing original about the shapes either. Small
hats have dipping brims that are tilted up
in front or at the side to show clusters of
small flowers beneath, a notion that must
have been familiar to Becky Sharp. The
beret-toque, which has made its appearance
under other names in other ages, is done in
canvas-like, pliable straw, which can be folded
m any desired way. Checks and plaids are to
be had in this class of nut-cover, and also mag-
pie effects, which look very smart. Some of the
season’s shapes are on jack-tar lines, but
have brims that curve and dip becomingly at
the sides. One of these in black and white
straw caused the flappers to gasp in aston-
ishment, but their mammas doubtless remem-
ber the time when they looked very chic
under such top-pieces. Big-brimmed hats
that slope from very little shade over the
face to a great deal at the side or back
display but little trimming; just a soft
ribbon wound about the crown and tied in a
loose bow at the side.
The latest quaint fad for evening wear is
sandals colored to match gowns. Following
what is believed to be an Oriental custom,
toenails are to be picked out in appropriate
shades or to take on the appearance of a
row of gold or silver nuggets. A Bourke-
street firm displays among its latest lot
of cosmetics and perfumes from Paris gold
and silver paint for the nails, new hues of
face rouge and colored scents.
Four nice-looking ’maids arrayed in mauve
satin with matching little coats of lace and
wreaths of purple pansies attended Genevieve,
elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. S. H.
Dickins, of Kew, when she exchanged pro-
mises with Jack, only son of the R. T.
Edgars, of Hawthorn, at the Independent
Church, Collins-street. Brussels lace min-
gled with the parchment-colored satin robe
of the bride, over which cascaded a creamy
tulle veil, descending from halo of orange
buds.
Jean Mary, youngest daughter of Mrs. T.
M. Knight, formerly of Shepparton and now
of Hawthorn, married W. Stewart Cuddon, of
Hawthorn, at Chalmers kirk, Auburn. Her
sister, Mrs. W. Rowd, of Echuca, attended
her as matron of honor in rose-pink velvet,
with two ’maids whose white net frilled
frocks were topped with velvet hats, and
who carried posies of forget-me-nots. Ivory
georgette with a glistening of crystal and
lots of tulle veil decked the bride.
Welcoming hands are being extended to
Mrs. Richard Fitcher, who has returned after
a year’s sojourn in Sydney, where her youn-
gest son, Don, is at school. Mrs. J. 11. Moss
hostessed a luncheon and bridge party at her
home on Royal-parade, and Mrs. Fitcher
played hostess to several old friends at the
Windsor for afternoon tea. Mrs. Cecil
Parkes played some piano pieces as the
guests gathered about the fire in the blue
room, which was decked with Iceland
poppies.
The Lud Mayor presided at a meeting
to discuss the setting up of a memorial to
Melba. The Firm suggested a carillon,
advancing Dame Nellie’s preference in sup-
port, other proposals being a “philharmonic
hall,” a national opera co. and the erection
of cottages for indigent musicians. How-
ever, all present were agreed that it would
be useless to attempt to collect funds until
the clouds roll by.
At the Emily McPherson College there
was tree-planting under the auspices of
the Wattle League. In the presence of a
crowd of onlookei’S the president of the
league, Mrs. Britomarte James, ensconced a
promising young wattle, and passed the
spade on to Royena Chisholm, principal of
the college, after whom Dr. Ethel Osborne,
the Barrett lady, Mrs. 11. A. Woodruff and
the senior student, Alison Allen, took a hand.
Nettie Palmer, well known to Bulletin
readers through her writings, is pictured
here. The lady, who is the wife of author
Vance Palmer,
lias lately pub-
lished a book
of memoirs of
her uncle) the
late Judg e
Higgins, which
has been high-
ly praised. Mrs.
Palmer, who
is an M.A. of
M e l b o urne

velled exten-
sively in Eng-
land and on
the Continent,
and makes a
hobby of the

At a hop at. the Francatelli in aid of St.
Vincent’s Hospital Mayoress Wright, of
South Melbourne, was present, wearing chif-
fon flowered in copper tints. Miss K.
Esmonde, who danced in black lace, was pre-
sident, and Miss M. Fitzpatrick was hon.
sec.
The programme at the Music Club’s gath-
ering included first performances in Aus-
tralia of two musical plays, “There and
Back,” by Paul Hindemith, translated from
the German by Mrs. Ernest Scott, and Fritz
Hart’s setting of “St. George and the
Dragon,” an old-time Christmas masque.
Mr. Hart’s playlet was encored. Beatrice
Oakley, in pink, was the heroine in the
Hindemith tabloid. In the audience were
Prof, and Mrs. E. Scott, the Arthur Hor-
derns and the Max Meldrums.
Mrs. William Anderson, known on the
stage in other days as Eugenie Duggan,
put on a performance of “Peter Pan” by
her young pupils at the Playhouse on Satur-
day night. The principals, save for Mr. and
Mrs. Darling and a few pirates, were all
children. Alice Uren’s dancing pupils
stepped in dainty ballets of Red Indians,
fairies and other picturesque folk. The
wee fairies were almost babies, and they
danced adorably. The piece went well, and
a packed house was liberal with applause.
Mary Hamilton made a splendid Peter Pan,
and Geoffrey Oliver, who doubled the roles
of Nana the dog and one of the lost boys,
Ked himself a comedian of ability. Grade
as the wee maid of the Darling
family, Mona Wilson as Wendy, Thelma
Gay as John and Dorothy Purkis as
Michael were quite at home in their parts,
Alister Phiddian was Mr. Darling, and
Dorothy Pyke was Mrs. Darling.
At the Uni. Symphony Orchestra’s con-
cert on Saturday night the audience included
medical-knight James Barrett and his lady,
Dr. and Mrs. Leon Joua, Mrs. Edward
Stevens and the R. Vanderkelens. Madame
Jessie Masson, in black lace with a steel
waistbelt and a sprinkling of diamente on
the corsage, was the evening’s soloist, play l
ing the Saint-Saens iConcerto No. 2 in G
minor.

the late Cap-
tain F. Mc-
L e a n, and
hails from
Q u e e nsland.
Last winter
she started a
blanket and
firewood fund which brought warmth to
many destitute families. Another interest
of hers is the Voco Vocalists, a bunch of
amateur players she has organised to aid
charitable causes; so far about £3OO has
been collected through these merry entertain-
ments. Success in the Q.V.H. competition
brings her a trip to Queensland along with
a friend, some dainty undies, a box of silk
stockings and a week’s contract to appear
at a city picture theatre.
A peep at South Aus.: —
Bridge parties remain the best money-raisers for
charity. The “Opening of the City Bridge,” by
Dorothy Brunton, at the Town Hall, was an effort
organised by the Mayoress (Mrs. C. R. J. Glover)
to raise funds for clothing destitute babies, There
were over 100 tables. Dorothy Brunton, who wore
a leopard-skin coat that fitted well into the Siberian
atmosphere, after making a delightful little speech,
undertook the strenuous task of raffling some babies.’
clothes. Mesdames E. W. Holden, T. Flint, A. M.
Cudmore, R. Colley and J. A. Bonnin, supervised the
afternoon-tea. Another big bridge gathering: arranged
by the St. Peter’s College Mission, was held in the
Memorial Hall at St. Peter’s.
At the Hunt Club races Mr. E. A. Brooks and his
wife entertained at tea. Mrs. Brooks was in a
marmot fur coat and a smart little black felt hat
with a touch of white. Daughter Barbara was also
furred.
The trip to Cairns by the Manunda will take quite
a party of Adelaide folk to a warmer climate,
among them Sidney Kidman and his lady, Mrs.
Sidney Reid, Mr. Whitmore Carr, Dr. and Mrs. T.
G. Wilson, and Mr. and Mrs. Howard Lloyd.
The Toe H annual ball will be held at the Palais
Royal on September 4, the date having been post-
poned so as to enable Lady Hore-Ruthven, now in
England, to be present.
The Girl Guides will do their bit towards raising
funds for the Kuitpo Colony on August 24. Mrs.
E. W. Holden, Divisional Commissioner, is lending
her beautiful home at Dequettville-terrace, Kent
Town, for the purpose.
The Refectory at the Adelaide University was
again the scene of festivity on Thursday night, when
the Pharmaceutical Students’ Association held their
annual ball. The president of the association (Mr.
M. C. Moore) and his wife, with Miss M. Stead and
Mr. W. Norman, received the guests, Mrs. Moore
wore a smart toilette of black lace. Miss Stead was
in pale- blue satin. The Mayor and Mayoress were
present.
From the Westerners :
A lone candle flickered over the pink and white
Posting of the cake at the Shakspeare’s Club’s first
birthday party. The attractive Women’s Service
Guild rooms in National House sheltered a big gather-
ing. President Mrs. Le Tessier, clasping a posy
against her silver coat, and sec. Maude Dingwall,
slim and efficient in black, made everyone welcome.
Sylvia George, wearing Cordelia’s flaxen plaits,
Regan and Goneril, in rich silks and velvets, and
some lavishly-bearded noblemen took the platform
for an extract from “King. Lear”; a slice of “As
You Like It’’ was similarly enacted. Piano and
violin solos, songs and a recited excerpt from
“Julius Caesar” filled up the bill. Prof. Murdoch,
who with Premier Mitchell’s wife is joint patron,
made an apt speech.
Tellers who with poker faces sweep your hard-
earned savings across the counter and managers who
blink over their glasses at the mere whisper of
overdrafts stowed their responsibilities in com-
bination safes and enjoyed a merry night at the
Bank Officers’ Ball. Cheques there were in plenty,
each one entitling its possessor to a dance with the
owner of the name inscribed thereon. The Wittenoom
lady, in black laces, accompanied her spouse; Mrs.
Burgess chose a pomegranate toilette ; Jean Wingrove’s
satins were of rosy sheen; Kathleen Lonergan chose
pink; Mrs. I. C. O’Hara’s moulded garment was
of powder-blue crepe de Chine; Jean McClintock
wore chilli-red, Mrs. Eisner flowered chiffons, Mrs.
Campbell Egan beige laces, and Mollie Smith
carnation-pink moire.
Charles McNess has come to light with £250
towards the Golden Apple appeal. During the next
two week-ends choice apples will be sold in the
metropolitan and suburban shops. Each specimen
will be hidden in a numbered wrapper. Money prizes
go to the lueky-number holders and profits to un-
employed women and needy children.
Not a seat went begging at the Repertory Club’s
short-play evening. Despite the Lancashire dialect,
Matthew Quealey got across with colors flying as
Sam in “Lonesome Like.” The old story of
two men and a woman was dealt with in “The
Camberley Triangle” by Lennox Cleland, Sol Sainken
and Mrs. Alan Stubbs, the lady displaying her good
taste by wearing amber shades with her Titian
locks. Mrs. H. H. Harper deserves a word of praise
for her interpretation of the pathetic old woman in
“The Patchwork Quilt.”
There were heaps of novelties and a string of
vaudeville items sandwiched between dances at the
Bachelors’ Ball at Temple Court. Palm-trees made
a waving forest at the back of the orchestra and
a canopy of streamers curled from the ceiling. Mrs.
O. Walker wore pearl-pointed satin, much betucked;
Pat Lang and Jean Hadley were two pretty maids
in pinks and greens respectively; Millie Lightley
wore pillar-box red; chenille velvet of a claret shade
was Mrs. Howard Bath’s choice; corn-colored ninon
clad Hazel Long; Claire Noonan chose saxe blue;
gumleaf-green georgettes rippled about Yvonne
Renou’s ankles; Mrs. Syd Atkins was in dawn-pink;
I>ulcie Duncan danced in buttercup, Gwen Male in
moss-green, Mabel Taylor-Thomas in georgettes
patterned with black and pink, and Grace Gratwick
in sage-green romaine. Nora Monaghan’s gown was
a golden sunburst; Mrs. Lyon Johnston’s dark head
emerged from a cloud of ivory chiffons.
A note from the Speck :
Mrs. Guy Minnett Lucas gave a bridge party for
a house-warming in her new abode, Wrest Point,
Sandy Bay. There were about 80 guests to admire
the moonlit view of the harbor between rubbers.
The three reception-rooms were warmed by huge log
fires, and the table decorations combined late autumn
blooms with early spring bulbs.
A Popular Girl contest has been responsible for
most of the larger shivoos during the past few
weeks; it closed with a Bohemian Carnival at the
City Hall. Captain W. H. Gray conducted the show,
and the big hall was crowded. Music was provided
by McCullum’s band, and towards midnight the
final results were declared: Biddy Wishart-Smith
(26th Battalion) first, followed by Mollie Eady,
Kathleen Symonds and Mary Watchorn. About £534
was roped in for the R.S.S.I.L.A.
Launceston racegoers had fine weather for the
Newnham meeting, though a high wind made folk
thankful for the prevailing fashion in close small
hats. Among the throng were the Guy Merediths,
Lance Archer, Miss Archer, the Frazer-Allens, Mrs.
Raymond Allen, the John Fosters, Peter Clemons
with his sister Anne, the Frere Youls, the A. P.
Harrissons, Mrs. Geo. Cann, the Noel Brownes, the
Andrew Raeburns, Mrs. Lionel Green, Mr. and Mrs.
H. W. L. Von Steiglitz, Mrs. V. Allison, Misses de
Dassel, Stanwix, Field, Hall, Wyiy, Bartlett, and a
few mainland and oversea visitors.
Mrs. Lyndhurst Giblin has been on a visit to the
Speck; her Professor joins her later in a four of
the east coast. At the monthly luncheon of the
League of Nations’ Union, Mrs. Giblin gave her
personal experiences of the League’s methods at
Geneva.
The St. Virgil’s College Ball at the Continental
saw the rooms well filled with dancers. The supper,
tables sported chrysanthemums in pink and tawny
shades.
Mrs. Alan Mclntyre gave an at-home at the Queen
Mary Club, where, after tea, about 70 guests listened
to a programme of poems interspersed with gramo-
phone selections. The hostess wore black cr6pe de
Chine with touches of turquoise blue in the narrow
vest and on the cuffs, and her picture hat of soft
black felt had a silver ribbon motif. Step-daughter
Vivienne w’as in blue.
Susie Nieholls, second daughter of the Lieut.-Gov.,
has passed her final exams, at the Royal Alexandria
Children’s Hospital, Sydney. She is expected home
next month.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Rakwool’s victory in the Grand National
Steeplechase at Flemington was reminiscent
of Grafnax’s in the Caulfield four-miler of
1910; but, whereas Grafnax contented him-
self with leading throughout by a moderate
margin, Rakwool treated his rivals with
disdain. He was 40 lengths in the van at
one stage. E. Y. Sheil’s strongly-built geld-
ing might be described as the Phar Lap of
fencers. This is his first season at the
game, yet he made "National history.’
Aware that the son of Woorak was inclined
to take risks, Inkson decided that the only
way to win was to let him have free rein;
and horse and jockey gave the people an
exhibition that thrilled them to the marrow.
Rakwool was favorite at 9 to 2.
E. Y. Sheil is a sportsman of many years’
standing. Raised among horses in the Gipps-
land town of Rosedale, he is now a grazier
in the Seymour district. AH along Sheil
maintained that Mosstrooper could not con-
cede his representative 141 b. over the
"National” distance. Mosstrooper came
down at the last of the abattoirs treble when
in pursuit of the winner ; last year’s cham-
pion was making little impression on Rak-
wool, and could not have finished nearer than
second. The pity of it was that gallant
Mosstrooper injured himself severely. He
twisted a plate on the off-hind hoof, and,
striking himself near the tendon of the cor-
responding foreleg, suffered a deep cut. Bob
Harris reported that Mosstrooper took off
too far from the obstacle. Displacement of
the plate might have occurred previously
and contributed to the fall.
Racegoers are ever ready to yield homage
to a new idol, and immediately the race was
over people began to proclaim Rakwool as
the greatest ’chaser in Australian history.
They should not forget that the bones of
Redleap were considered worthy of being en-
cased at the Museum, or that Mountain God
captured two successive “Nationals,” the
second of them with a stone more than Rak-

wool carried. None will deny that the most
spectacular of all victories was registered
by Traquair’s grandson. Time was when
Sheil could not take a trick with his prads.
On Saturday he preceded the cross-country
haul by appropriating the Trial Hurdle with
Taciturn, a son of William the Silent. Fred
Hoysted, trainer of this pair, is a nephew
of the man who romantically married a
daughter of Hector Norman Simson, one
of the pioneers of Victorian horsebreeding.
Another of Simson’s daughters became the
Avife of William Reid, who landed the Caul-
field Cup twice with Uncle Sam.
N:S.W. horses had a barren time at Flem-
ington. Gadray did best by finishing second
in the Doutta Galla Hurdle. This was an
excellent feat, as a serious blunder caused
the gelding to drop back nearly last after
hitting the front. Gadray’s jockey lost the
use of his reins and took long to recover
them. The horse made up a lot of ground to
gain second money. Mick Poison and A. J.
Matthews staked heavily on The Czar for a
mile juvenile event on the Wednesday; but
the Manfred colt let them down. Jim Pike
\\ r ent over to Melbourne specially to ride,
Fujisan in the Lawn Handicap on Satur-
day. The old Valais gelding had not fully
recovered from a fetlock injury, sustained
while in transit by sea, and did not show up
in the sprint event. Matthews has left him
Avith Cecil Godby in Melbourne, where handi-
cappers are showing a more merciful dis-
position than their Sydney brethren.
Jim Accola carried off the Lawn Handi-
cap spoils Avith Wise Force, whom he trains
for Mrs. E. F. Hughes, of Brisbane. The
conqueror of Amounis at weight-for-age is
very fit again; but punters in general were
unaware of the fact, and, despite Duncan
having accepted the ride on Wise Force, they
declared strongly for Princess Betty. Saddled
up by Lou Robertson for A. T. Creswick, the
M.L.-bred filly put in a strong finish and
actually headed Wise Force 50 yards from
home, but the natty stallion from the north
outstayed her.
Duncan weighed out for Starglint in the
July Handicap at the close of the afternoon,
and Andrew Chirnside’s banner-bearer
started a hot favorite. He had to be con-
tent with third place, victory resting with a
20-to-l chance, Cave King. By winning
the Footscray Steeplechase, Bang Bang com-
pensated trainer Steve Murphy for Poly-
gonum having fallen in the G. N. Hurdle
w T hen apparently sure of place money.
For Caulfield on Saturday:—
Leamington Hurdle: Gadray; next, Poly-
gonum.
Godfrey Watson Steeple: Cellist; next,
Bestman.

Thought in some quarters to be a Metro-
politan horse in the making, Stately dis-
mally failed to see out 11 furlongs in the
Rosehill Handicap at the course of that
name on Saturday. In fact she finished
last. Sarchion (4 to 1), who won after a
good finish with Spearshot (5 to 1), is a
grey gelding by Sarchedon, rvliose stock

with 7st. 21b., and some followers of the
game were father impressed with his show-
ing, but as old Don Moon gave him nearly
two stone and was finishing just as fast,
though in fourth place, after having been
handled in such a style that the stewards
suspended the jockey—Williams—for two
months, the form was by no means good.
The grey was ridden by Pratt, who has
been singularly successful in this class of
race during the autumn and winter.
Unlucky Sir Duninald was punters’ first
choice for the Flying Handicap, but he was
beaten into third place by Erbie (5 to 1)
and Bunkum. Booth did not produce either
of his pair, Eulclare and Yalmena —they
are destined for more important races, per-
haps. Merryland (5 to lj, a rather taking
sort of mare, locally-trained, by Claro-Eudid,
got -the verdict in the Carlingford Handi-
cap ; an outsider, Mr. Kerry, finished first
but interfered with Merryland and was
placed second. King Crow, favorite again,
ran another third.

A. R. Lempriere, member of one of Mel-
bourne’s best-known wool firms, died in Mel-
bourne a few days ago at 55. He was an
enthusiastic follower of racing and had been
for years connected with the Moonee Valley
Club, of which he was a committeeman up
to the time of his death. He had a special
weakness for jumping horses, and among
others; owned the Fleet Admiral mare Fleet
Lady, who won the V.A.T.C. Wyuna Steeple
and the V.R.C. Autumn Steeple, in addition
to numerous other “lepping” events. With
J. A. McLeod, he was part-owner of Gazomp,
winner of the Australian Steeplechase of
1921. He was also a noted golfer, winning
the Australian amateur championship in 1913
and being runner-up for the open title the
same year.

France’s great classic, the Grand Prix
de Paris, worth 800,000 francs to the
successful owner, was won by the Comte
de Rivaux’s Barneveldt, by the English
horse Winter King out of Black Domino.
There were 13 starters, and the win-
ner got home by a short head. The
distance is a mile and seven furlongs, colts
carrying 9st. 21b. and fillies Bst. 131 b. If
the winner is foaled in France his breeder
gets 60,000 additional francs. The City of
Paris subscribes 810,000 francs, and five rail-
way companies add 50,000 more; the sweep-
stakes is 5000. For years this race was
looked on as money from home for one of the
English three-year-olds. Times have changed
r«nd the Frenchmen generally manage nowa-
days to keep the cash in the country.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Pounds below his best fighting weight
when Russ Critcher beat him on May 29,
Fred Hannaberry (lOst. 121 b.) conquered
Critcher (lOst 91b.) in a return match, also
at Leichhardt, last Friday night. The
battling was bitter, and when Critcher acci-
dentally landed a left after the bell ended
the fifth round the referee had to step in
to stop them making a Donnybrook of it.
They fought nip-and-tuck, with Hannaberry’s
more orthodox work winning by a slight
margin for 14 rounds. In the last round
the lad from Port Pirie (he will be 20
on Saturday) knocked Critcher to one knee,
and landed so many other weighty wallops
that there was no cavilling at the decision.
As each weighed more than lOst. 71b., and
the contest was limited to two-minute rounds,
Critcher’s Australian welterweight cham-
pionship was not at stake.
* * * *
Herman Bundren is an enigma to Sydney
Stadium patrons. His recent showings have
been so disappointing that they wonder
whether the lanky Kansan has any real
ability or not. In his second contest with
Jack Carroll (lOst. 91b.) on Saturday night
Bundren (list. 61b.) again seemed too lazy
to let himself go, and the much lighter and
cleverer Carroll won every round.
* * * *
“Mitt Shover”: While fresh from his
triumph over Pat Redmond, Primo Camera
had his transports dashed by the news that
the French Government had issued a war-
rant for his arrest on the ground of evading
military service. It appears that before he
blossomed as the bulkiest pug in captivity
Camera went from his native Italy to France
looking for a job, and to better bis chancy
of getting one took out hreneli naturalise
tion papers. Now the chicken has boomer-
anged home to roost, in a manner ot speaK-
ing As long as Camera remains overseas,
well and good, for liis crime does not come
under the extradition treaties. He only
in America oil sufferance, however, and L>n
tain has shown that she does not desire his
company. There is nothing tor him tin
but to go back to Italy and when Musso-
lini hears of the French naturalisation the
mountain of meat is likely to be welcomed
with a castor-oil banquet.

Both Sydney Rugby codes carried on with
their grade competitions at the week-end.
The big Rugby Union game of the day was
between the leaders, Manly, and Rand wick
at the Cricket Ground. Manly won 18-0 (4
tries and 3 goals to a try and a goal), but
the game was much closer than the scores
indicate, Malcolm and Primrose, the latter
in rare buckle at five-eighth, did good woik
for the winners; Towers, Marks and Pal-
freyman shaped well for Randwick. Eastern
Suburbs astonished by overwhelming
Northern Suburbs at Manly by 42-11; it
scored 8 tries, and Ross converted 6, adding
2 penalty goals as well. Norths’ tally was
3 tries, 1 converted. University won well
from St. George at Uni. Oval by 20-12
Hemingway again scoring heavily (12
points) for the Students. Drummojne
finished comfortably ahead of M estern
Suburbs at Parramatta, final scores being
24-14. There should be a great fight between
Manly and Easts in the last round. If the
Easterners win, a final will be necessary.
* * * *
“Math”: Things are drab nowadays in
Rugby. One time all sorts of devices had to
be resorted to. In a match at S.C.G. a few
years ago, a burly visiting forward was
giving a lot of trouble and the captain said
to the hooker: “Bite ’is ear when the scrum
goes down —that’ll stop ’im !” Two scrums
followed but there was no change. Why
don't y’ do as I told y’?” yelled the cap. :
“are y’ losin’ y’ punch?” The hooker was
wild. “Blimey,” he said, “I done me best.
Look how wet ’is face is. How can I do
any better with me teeth in th’ flamin
dressin’-room!”
* * * *
The League games provided. one surprise
when the little-considered. Newtown side
ran unbeaten Eastern Suburbs to a short
head at the Sports Ground, the much-rattled
leaders finally scrambling home by 12-7 (2
tries and 3 goals to a try and 2 goals). The
Newtown forwards, headed by Thornton
and McCarthy, racked determinedly, while
Mork and Holmes were sound backs. Pearce
was the best Easterner. North Sydney,
showing much improved dash, won a good
game from Western Suburbs, last year’s pre-
miers at North Sydney Oval, scoring 17-11
(3 tries and 4 goals by Carroll to 3 tries
and a goal). Wests had bad luck in losing
full-back McMillan, 10 minutes before time,
when leading by a point. Uni. scored its
first win of the season against Balmain at
Birch grove getting home by 5-4. South
Sydney had no trouble in downing St. George
at Earl Park, final scores reading IS-9.
* * * *
“Canny Lad”: The entirely commercial
outlook of the average professional footballer
was vividly illustrated the other day when
the English Rugby League, replying to Aus-
tralian protests 'against the poaching of
NSW and Queensland players, calmly
offered to pay the State Leagues £2OO a head
for any future purchases, this to be in addi-
tion to the customary signing-on fee paid
by the English club to the player and the
weekly wage. The offer took away the
breath even of the Australian bodies, which
have done a fair amount of trafficking among
themselves at one time or another. It is
not clear who is to get the £2OO. Probably
the State League or the club concerned. The
nlaver, too, might insist on a cut for himself,
since this right is reserved to a man sold
by one club to another in England on the
“transfer-fee” system. There is only one
way to stop the Englishmen in their little
game. That is to sign up all players under
rigid contracts as the English clubs do. As
it is they arc paid a cut of the gates, and
this might be standardised.
:ic * $ *
“Gonce”; Queensland Rugby League had
hard luck with the weather when the N.S.W.
team visited Brisbane. The second of the
inter-State games was ruined by the tre-
mendous downpour, and the big crowd that
would have come along on a fine day unani-
mously stayed away.. The last match, at
Toowoomba, was also spoilt, though the rain
had ceased. Attendance at big games in the
Downs city is greatly swelled by the big
farming population, which motors in by the
hundred on such occasions. This time the
famous Darling Downs black soil intervened,
and nothing without wings was able to trip
into town. The total loss was £259, with
no chance of getting it back until next year.
* * * *
Weather conditions had probably much to
do with form reversal in Melbourne League
football on Saturday. Footscray, having lost
to Carlton by 3 points and to Collingwod by
4, went to Geelong full of cocksureness, and
crashed sadly, to the joy of most, of the
9000 who paid £279 to see the rout. The
scores —Geelong. 52 points; Footscray, 23
explain the play. Colling wood, having to
meet "Ess'endon. which has been everybody's
meat this season, started off confidently. But
the lighter Essendonians ran rings round
the Magpies and at the close had 81 points
to ’Wood’s 57. The largest mob on the
day—2o,ooo—got the best game from those
old rivals Carlton and South Melbourne.
South has improved a lot, and after a hard,
clean game battled out the last quarter
quite in the old style. Lack of steadiness
among the forwards lost it the game:
Carlton, 77 points; South, 72. Richmond
beat Melb. with 66 points to 53; St. Ivilda
downed Fitzroy, 90 to 58; and Hawthorn
piled up 96 to North Melbourne’s 24.
* * ■>
“Elgar”: The fact that Syd Coventry,
Collingwood and Victorian captain for some
tears, will have to watch from out-
side the fence for the next few weeks,
through a fractured jaw, should set the Vic.
League thinking. Accidents of all sorts
have been too many and too serious. Hardly
a man goes under the shower after a League
game nowadays without showing a score of
ugly-looking bruises. Only splendid train-
ing enables them to stand it. If this sort; of
thing goes" on unchecked the Coroner will
presently be talking; and that won’t do
the game any good.
# ❖ &
“Torrens”: The South Australian Foot-
ball League has been haying trouble
with umpires, and has instituted a
board to control them and make appoint-
ments to matches. The board consists of five
members, with cricketer Vic. Richardson as
chairman. Before his cricket fame eclipsed
his football doings, Vic. was for some years
the best centreman in South Australia.
* * *
“Jolimouut”: Attention was called to an
unpleasant aspect of professional sport in
Melbourne the other day. A South Melbourne
footballer was out of work, and was offered
employment in addition to the usual pay-
ments by Melbourne, provided he could get
his clearance. H'e is a good player, and
South won’t release him. As a result, work-
less, but with work to go to, be is debarred
from taking it, under an agreement with a
so-called sporting organisation, for the most
selfish of reasons.
* # * *
“Philm”: George Maloney, who has
already made his mark with Geelong, is
not the first Westralian forward to harass
Victorian backs on his first appearance.
Wally Gunnyon and Fred Wimbridge both
started with a flourish of trumpets, or rather
a constant waving of the twin flags, only to
drop out of the picture later. Maloney,
playing with the weak Claremont-Cottesloe
side, just managed to miss the Westralian
goal-kicking championship last year.
(Continued on next page.)
As expected, Britain beat Czechoslovakia
by 4 matches to 1 in the European zone hnal
of the Davis Cup, thus qualifying to meet
U.S.A. Whichever wins should lift the Cup.
for French form has been poor this year, and
both Cochet and Laeoste have been reported
on the sick list.

Blade : Australia had a fair look in at
Henley this year In addition to Pearce s
win in the Diamonds, two Victorians, Sambell
and Luxton, were m the Pembroke (Cam.)
four which won the Visitors Challenge Cup.
The pair also turned out for their college in
the Silver Goblets but were downed in 41k'
double-sculls event by Cliiistchiiich. S. Ilm-
dern, of Sydney, was a member of the Jesus
crew which won the Ladies Challenge Plate,
The hero of the regatta was H. R. A.
Edwards, of the London Chib,> rowed m

and Stewards Cups, and with L. Cline cni-
ried oft the Silver Goblet , t

Blade : A scheme to raise a speenn
sum to send an eight to row at the Co.
Angeles Olympiad is being discussed. It is
suggested that the example of Westralia be
followed and a League of Oarsmen be formed,
with membership at halt a guinea. I e
badge entitles the bearer to free admission
to any regatta and an invitation to any
rowing function. It is a sound idea, and
this country would seem to have a better
chance of winning the Olympic rowing title
than any of the track or field events. The
last time an Australian crew figured at an
Olympiad was in 1924, when the Murray
Bridge crew - from South Australia were
among the also-rans.

Huon : Ihe blazer craze of the last
couple of years has caused some annoyance
through the commandeering of famous
club and representative colors by outsiders,
Tasmania has suffered m this respect, like
the other States; it has now adopted a
new blazer for its cricketers and lias copy-
righted the design. Ihe new garment is
green with rose and primrose stripes, three
colors being necessary to comply with the
copyright requirements. It sounds rather'kill-
ing, and the Tassies should take a trot over
to the mainland next season to give the
girls a treat.

“Fitzcray”: Melbourne football followers
are taking a lot of interest in the coming
visit of a Victorian Association team to
Sydney, since it will be the first time for
20 years that the organisation has sent
a team out of the State. Before the
Australian Football Council was formed
in 1906 and the Association was ex-
cluded from control of the game by
the League, matches with South Australia
and Westralia were frequent. The League
forbids its affiliated bodies in the other
States having anything to do with the rival
organisation. N.S.W. has defied the edict,
and it will be interesting to see what the
Council is going to do about it.
* * * *
“Semaphore”: One of the queerest associa-
tions which have come to light of late is the
newly-formed. South Australian football
trainers’ union. The promoters explain
that whereas trainers do years of useful work
for football teams, their services receive no
recognition when the period of their useful-
ness is over. Players on the other hand
receive medical expenses and allowances as
well as free trips to other States, and when
they retire are made life members of their
clubs. This injurious differentiation is not to
be borne, and a change is to be brought about
to the tune of solidarity for ever.
* * ‘ * *
“Fitzcray”: The life of a Victorian foot-
ball umpire is full of tribulation. There
are times Avhen even those whose duty it is to
protect him from his enemies let him down
as heavily as a red-hot ploughshare. The
other day in Melbourne one worm with the
whistle turned. Seeking the League umpires’
appointment committee, he complained bit-
terly that at his last match the barrackers
had bombarded ,him with stones throughout
the game, displaying remarkable marksman-
ship into the bargain. To his query of
“what about it?” the committee regretted it
could do nothing for him and advised him to
try somewhere else.
* * * *
“Forward”: In Perth Soccer circles this
season there is a team of youthful Czecho-
slovakians known as Zoras. They clashed
on a recent Saturday with a team of Jews
known as the Maccabeans. The spectators
Were undecided at times as to whether they
were watching a match on an Australian
field or. in Montenegro. The referee’s lot
in settling questions of bad language became
a serious problem. He couldn’t tell whether
a Czech was merely complimenting an oppo-
nent for hacking or telling him to go to
blanky Tophetski.
* * * #
“Outside Right”: The Australian Soccer
heads have accepted an invitation to send a
team to Java next month. The tour has
nothing to do with the advent of the com-
rades from Russia, these being under the
rival Soccer League banner. Ten games will
be played in Java and one in Macassar. The
team will leave Sydney on August 19, and is
expected back on October 5. An Australian
team toured Java and Malaya in 1928 and
did well, losing only two matches of 24
played.

“Old Rep.”: There should be some stiff
work, ahead of the Australian selectors when
the time comes to choose the Rugby Union
side for Maoriland after the trial match
on August 3, Australia v. the Rest,
at Sydney Cricket Ground. Not only will
Queensland and N.S.W. have a strong eutry,
but at least two topnotch players from Mel-
bourne, Sturtridge and Cowper, have in-
dubitable claims, especially Sturtridge, who
showed himself a versatile inside back
against the British and when playing for
Australia against the All Blacks in Bris-
bane in 1929. Westralia has been invited
to send over a couple of candidates, or to
drag one of the selectors over to Perth. As
the Westerners will have to foot the bill in
either case, it is likely they will give it a
miss.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot”: The All-England tennis cham-
pionships at Wimbledon ended in a triumph
for the young Yank team. Shields and
Woods were left in the final, when the former
had to scratch on account of : injury, and
Woods walked over. Lott and Van Ryu
outed Cochet and Brugnon in the doubles by
three sets to two, and Lott again, partnered
by Mrs. Harper, won the mixed doubles. Mrs.
Barron and Miss Mudford won the women’s
doubles, Britain’s only victory. The she
singles went to the little German Fraulein
Aussem, who had for her opponent in the
final another Deutscherette, Fraulein Krah-
winkle, who carried a heavy handicap in her
name.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: Woods, victorious in the
tennis singles.championship at Wimbledon, is'
the fourth American to have turned the trick,
the others having been Johnston, McLoughlin
and Tilden. Frenchmen Lacoste, Borotra and
Cochet have also gathered in the title The
first outlander to win the event was Aus-
tralia’s own Norman Brookes, who was suc-
cessful in 1900 and on two subsequent
occasions. Gerald Patterson is the only other
Australian to take the title, while one South
African, in Norton has also scored.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Fitzcray”; What Melbourne sees of the
sun at this time of year nearly stood still
a few days ago when it was announced that
a number of entries had been received for
an associates’ veteran championship. The
idea of any female, of the golfing variety or
otherwise, owning up to having reached the
veteran stage is incredible, but when it is
noted that the minimum age is 50 there is
nothing left but to grope blindly in the
direction of the nineteenth hole.
* * $ *
“Hotham”: It is not often one hears of
public links having to take the knock,
but this is what has happened at Malvern
(Vic.), where a course costing the Council
some £7OOO is to be abandoned. The Coun-
cil is itself largely to blame, for the course
was laid out on fiat country through which
a creek meanders. Every fall of rain saw
the place flooded, the water lying for days
and damaging greens and fairways. An
expert belatedly called in reported that to
prevent inundations, some further thousands
would have to be spent. Hearing this the
Council gibbered wildly, and resolved to let
the links return to the jungle.
** r j
“Brassey”: Assisting at the opening of
a golf course Dr. Arthur, the N. Si
Wales M.L.A., urged members to ex-
change their clubs occasionally for axes and
mattocks in order to assist his unemployed
proteges in settling on the land. The idea
is an excellent one, but there does not seem
to be any occasion for the worthy doctor to
drag in the mattocks, so to speak. The
average suburban golfer is quite capable of
viproofing the entire landscape with the
ordinary tools of his trade, and frequently
does so. Ask the first harassed-looking
club professional you come, across if you
don’t believe me.
* * * *
“Bloggs”: I wrote of Ryde as being “flat
and practically hazardless” (B. 24/6/’3l).
Since then I have played over its just-opened
second nine. As a 5140 yards course it is
anything but hazardless. The new third (541
yards, bogey 5), with two ravines to absorb
the drive and second respectively, and a nar-
row fairway between a creek and boundary
fence, must be as tricky as any hole round
Sydney. The 11th (530 yards, bogey 6) is
another snorter. Ryde is a charmingly coun-
tryfied links, hard by the historic estate on
which old Edward Terry had a stiff private
steeplechase course until a few years before
the war.
* * * *
“Iconoclast”; De Tomkiennes is the blue-
blooded and haughty secretary of the Royal
Callan Park Golf Club, an institution whose
exclusiveness and ton need no stressing. On
a tour of inspection round his precious links
the other day he was stricken to the heart by
the spectacle.of a ragged deadbeat sitting on
a frowsy, swag by the side of the fairway and
boiling his billy. When his breath came back
De T. swooped on the offender, bidding him
depart to Gehenna or Rose Bay, as was most
convenient. Unperturbed, the intruder asked
who his self-introduced acquaintance was.
Ai,” said De T-, drawing himself to his full
height of five feet two, “Ai have the honah
to be secretar-ay of this club.” “That’s orl
right, ole man” replied the other.; “but,
blime, that ain’t no way to get new mem-
bers.”
* * * *
“H’oylake”: The American open champion-
ship this year, played. at Toledo, in Ohio,
ended in the most extraordinary fashion, the
contestants in the final, Von Elm, and a new-
comer to first-class golf, Burke, who hails
from Connecticut, tieing twice before a final
decision could be arrived at. On the first
day Von Elm equalled Burke’s score of 292
with a long putt. In the first play-off over
36 holes, Elm repeated the trick. In the
third and deciding try Burke managed this
time to keep one to the good, finishing 148
for 36 holes to Von Elm’s 149. Perkins, the
ex-English amateur, was in third place with
Walter Hagen and a couple of others, their
scores being 297, as opposed to the winner’s
first round of 292.
* * , J Hs
“Rottnest”: Westralian golfers are feeling
the pinch of the bad times as much as any-
one. According to a local authority, Perth
players now do their own caddying in many
cases, and carry out their own club repairs
as far as is practicable, while no ball is now
discarded as long as it retains a remote re-
semblance to a sphere. Instead of . playing
for a ball the round, or, maybe, half a crown,
suburban golfers now wager half a dozen
eggs or a cauliflower, or a few pounds of
potatoes. About the only phase of golf
which has not been notably affected by the
depression is the ritual of the nineteenth,
and even there members show a decided
tendency to go easy with the water.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: The motor-record season is now
in full swing on the other side of the world,
and, as usual, Mrs. G. M. Stuart, who seems
to spend most of her life in a speed car
or on a motor-cycle, is one of the earliest
to hoist fresh figures. This time she broke
her own record for the 100 kilometres, aver-
ages 128.16 m.p.h. on the Montlhery track.-
The car is a Derby-Miller Special, and
as it is under 2000-c.c. capacity, two fresh
records were created for that class, 50 kilo-
metres at 126.81 m.p.h. and 50 miles at
127.97 m.p.h.
* *:]*.. *
“Formula”: Mention of the proposed
rally” for cars (B. 8/7/’31): reminds me that,
while the European event is rendered mo’-e
difficult by the -fact that it is : held in mid-
winter. Australia can provide such tremen-
dous distances and sdeh rough going over
many routes as to offset the ice and snow
on the other side. From Darwin through
Queensland to Melbourne, for instance, is
about 3600 miles. From Darwin through
Alice Springs to Melbourne would be 2500
miles, and from Cairns to Melbourne about
the. same distance. The Monte Carlo method
of scoring is to allot 100 points to each
person travelling 620 miles and 10 points for
each additional 1000 miles. <’ There is 1-lOOth
of a point for every mile in-excess and a
deduction of the same amount for every
mile under the standard distance. Other
points are awarded on formulae,' on a basis
of total mileage covered and on the average
speed maintained for the full journey.
Acceleration and brake tests are also subject
to points award or deduction, while a final
official examination may also result in a loss
of points.
* * * *
“Sump”: America has recently carried out
some interesting oil and fuel tests which are
worth noting by the owner-driver. Two
cars were sent over 9000 miles at
Indianapolis, one being run at an average
of 30 m.p.h. and the other at 55 m.p.h. The
first car used a quart of lubricating oil per
1000 miles, while the petrol mileage was
close on 14 to the gallon. The car driven
at the higher speed ate up 6.9 quarts of oil
for the 1000 miles, while 11.08 miles were
covered to the gallon of petrol. The moral
is that speed is expensive.

“Spur”: The round-Australia cyclist
Wakeling (B. l/7/’3l) duly completed his
tour by landing back in Melbourne 133 days
after setting out on his 10,000-mile ride, the
performance knocking no less than 107 days'
hours off the previous best, by Don McKay,
which was put up in the opposite direction 31
years ago. Wakeling started the ride with
only 225. in his pocket, but all along his
route found nothing but assistance and kind-
ness from everyone he came in contact with.
His average,'in: spite-of delays from floods
and short halts in some, of the larger towns,
was about 73 miles a day.
Miscellaneous
“Blue Chalk” : After the finest display of
amateur billiards Australia, has seen, the
Empire championship tourney in Sydney saw
the Englishman Steeples the winner, his
opponent in the final being his brother-
Briton Lee. The Australian players were out-
classed. Steeples during the tournament scored
a world’s record break for an amateur,
461, and Lee also ran up some exceptional
scores. Both men play fast, all-round bil-
liards, utilising the nursery. cannon, in which
Steeples excels.

“Shell” : Bob Pearce’s victory in the Dia-
mond Sculls at Henley was done in slowish
time, lOmin. 3sec. As the race was rowed
against tide and a strong wind this, is. under-
standable, especially as- Robert was not
pressed. The record for the-2310- yards, is
Bmin. 10sec., put up in 1905 by another Aus-
tralian, F. S. Kelly, who, however, did all his
rowing in England, where he has been a resi-
dent for many years. In 1913 Cecil McVilly,
of Hobart, carried off the race in Bmin. 49sec.
against the tide. The only man who made
Pearce shift was Brocklebank, stroke of the
Cambridge eight, who extended the Aus-
tralian in one of the heats.
❖ ❖ ❖ #
“Tenakoe”: Maoriland’s fine showing in the
Lords Test has moved the British cricket
authorities to substitute two more Test games
in place of county • fixtures previously
arranged. The first will be at Kennington,
beginning July 29, the return match with
Surrey being cut out; and the third at Man-
chester instead of a game with Lancashire.
There is no doubt that Britain is sadly disap-
pointed with the showing of the home side
against the All Blacks in.the first game, .and
is welcoming the chance of testing new
bowling and batting blood.

“Cash Amateur-Pro” : South Africans have
always been notable for their adherence to the
spirit as well as the letter of amateurism in
sport. Last week they definitely decided to
send across their cricket side next season on
the original terms, refusing with thanks the
later offer of the Board of Control to guarantee
them a £12,000 minimum. Under the original
arrangement the Afrikanders accept the full
risk of the tour and take a half-share of the
outer-gate receipts. There is little doubt the
tour will be a success. The ' team is a for-
midable one, though it is possible that fast-
bowler Bell may not be able to come. Owen
Smith, now up at Oxford, is another absentee,
and opening-batsman Seidle may be another.
=!= * * *
“Shrewsbury”: This year’s Oxford-Cam-
bridge match at Lord’s was a record one in
more ways than one. The Oxford side in-
cluded four Dominions players: Melville and
Owen Smith from South Africa, Hone from
South Australia and this Nawab of Pataudi
from India. Cambridge scored 385, of which
A. T. Ratcliffe notched 201, the lirst double
century ever made in these matches. The
record did not last long, for the Nawab ran
up 238 n.o. in an Oxford total of 453 for
8 wickets. Cambridge went for 122 in the
second knock, and the Dark Blues won by
8 wickets.

“Whitehall” : According to a‘cable, two
hours of pandemonium marked the annual
meeting in London of the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The
trouble with the R.S.P.C.A. is that 50 per
cent, of its members are hunting men and
women, or the owners or lessees of shoots.
They are willing to go to any lengths to pre-
vent horses or dogs being ill-treated (with
the reservation that horses may be flogged
on a racecourse, dogs in the field, and so on),
but they can’t see anything wrong in tortui-
ing stags, foxes, hares, rabbits and game
birds. A good many shoot pigeons at Monte
Carlo and elsewhere, though the sport is
deader than cock-fighting in England since
Queen Alexandra got it barred at Hurling-
ham. The opposition consists of city and
suburban dog-, bird- and cat-owners and
people who specialise in idealistic movements.
The struggle is essentially a class one in Lon-
don, with Mayfair on one side and Balham on
the other; and the class- issue, is gradually
manifesting itself in the provinces also. In
Devon and Somerset, for example, many far-
mers have begun to bar the famous local
staghounds from their properties.

“Lao-dah”: The Chinese arc repeating
sporting history, as the French and other
European nations did. A generation ago
every Briton held as an article of faith
that no foreigner could possibly be a sports-
man. Until recently the yellow man held
the opinion that the only method of raising
a perspiration compatible with the profession
of a gentleman was drinking wine and writ-
ing verses. Now the country is covered with
sporting organisations. Chinese crews tug
outriggers furiously along the Whangpoo.
footballers have, become national heroes, and
there are numerous journals exclusively
devoted to sport, in which almond-eyed
flappers whose mothers’ feet were bound grin
at the reader in bathing togs or running cos-
tume.

“Bias”: The Australian bowling cham-
pionship meeting in Brisbane next month has
attracted a surprising number of entries, over
100 having sparred up from I'f. S. Wales alone,
with more coming in. Included in the Welsh
contingent are a number of country players.
Maoriland is sending over 28 seasoned war-
riors, and the Victorians, who seem to have
a genuine penchant for the thirst-inviting
climate of Brisbane, are preparing to swarm
northward like a hive of bees. No news has
been received from South Australia and the
West as yet, but Tassy can be relied on to
supply a quota. Meanwhile the prohibition
interests in Brisbane are taking a gloomy
view of the situation which promises to
develop.

Information Sought.
(1) What are the duties of policewomen in
N.S.W.? (2) How many arc theref —4400.
(1) They conduct inquiries in connection
with missing friends, suspicious advertise-
ments and criminal offences in which females
are concerned. They also assist the members
of the Drug Bureau attached to the C.I.D.
Branch in the detection of persons engaged
in trafficking in narcotic drugs. A con-
siderable amount of attention is also given
by them to juvenile offenders. (2) Eight.
Does the Southern Cross point due south?
—4247.
The constellation points due south only
when it is on the meridian of the place, and
this happens twice in 24 hours, at the upper
and lower culminations. At other times it
either east or west of due south. The
lmination takes place a little earlier each
ening and during the year goes right
and the clock.
(1) How are the weak voltages received
a broadcast-receiving aerial measured?
) Where can such an instrument be pro-
cured? —4379.
(1) By an instrument known as a valve-
voltmeter. It consists of a lion-regenerative
valve detector, tuned to the received wave-
length and having a sensitive micro-ammeter
in its plate circuit. The valve operates on
the lower bend of its characteristic curve,
which causes the meter to deflect in propor-
tion to the strength of the received signals.
Such an instrument requires to be very
accurately calibrated. (2 ) You could get one
made by Amalgamated Wireless, 47 York-
street, Sydney.
(1) Why were there two full moons in
June? (2) Has this occurred before? —
4303.
(1) The time from full moon to full moon
is approximately 29 days 121 hours, so
that if there is a full moon on the first
of a calendar month containing 30 or 31-
days the same phase will be repeated with-
in the month. (2) In 1863 and 1882 there
were two full moons in dune in England
but only one in Australia owing to difference
in time. East June we had two full moons
and England only one, but England had had
two in May.
(1) When did Lord Kitchener die, and
what were the circumstances? (2) When did
General Haig take command of the, British
forces in France? When did Foeh take com-
mand (3) in place of Joffrej and (4)
supreme command? —4334.
(1) On June 5, 1916, he sailed from Scapa
Flow for Russia in the cruiser Hampshire to
discuss the re-arming of the Tsar’s forces.
The cruiser struck a mine off the Orkneys,
and Kitchener and most of his staff were
drowned. (2) lie succeeded Sir John
French in the chief command at the end of
1915. (3) He became chief of the French
general staff on May 15, 1917. after Nivellc’s
failure—-Nivelle had taken over from Joffre —
though it was Retain who followed Nivelle in
the field. (4) Officially on April 14, 1918,
though he was directing combined French
and English operations before that date.
What is the best time to pick bulb blooms?
■ —4349.
Just when the buds begin to break. They
will open when cut just as well as on the
plants, and there is no risk of damage by
wind or rain.
(1) When making a glass frame for cover-
ing seedlings what is the, best, type of roof,
sloping or hip? (2) What weight of glass
should be used? (3) How is it fixed? —
4353.
A hip or gable roof if the frame is away
from any wall or fence; a sloping roof if
built, against a wall. (2) Sixteen ounce,
in panes 9in. square. (3) Lay the glass
level with the wood frames and putty, so
that a flat surface is presented, off which rain
will easily run.
(1) What were the reasons for the aboli-
tion of proportional representation in
N.S.W.? (2) Who introduced the. reversion
to the system of single, seats with preferen-
tial voting in N.S.W.? (3) Total number of
first preferences polled by the respective
parties at the 10.30 N'.S.W'. State elections?
—4352. , ,
(1) Chief among the objections made to
proportional representation were that the
electorates became too large, that undesir-
able rivalry and duplication of effort on the
part of members for the same electorate
resulted, and that the system failed to pro-
vide a satisfactory working majority for
whatever Government gained office. (2) The
Lang 1925-27 Government sought to secure
the adoption of an unqualified "first past the
post” single-seat system. After a contest
with the Leg. Council a compromise was
accepted which provided for optional prefer-
ential voting. (3) Labor, 716,912; Nation-
alist, 410,538; Country Party, 120,322; Aus-
tralian Party, 26,124 ; Independents, 19,680;
Communist, 10,317.
I have heard it said that the wages-tax
proposals of the Lang Government of A. S.
Wales are not as drastic as those imposed
in the V.S.A. m wartime. What are the
facts?—^ 4362.
In 1918, the year of heaviest taxation, the
U.S.A. levied 7.7 per cent, of taxable incomes.
Of the total amount received only 12.84 per
cent, came from incomes under £lOOO a year,
and 54.73 per cent, came from incomes of over
£20,000 a year. On incomes from £2OO to
£4OO a year the rate was under 2 per cent.j
on incomes from £lOOO to £2OOO, under 5
per cent. Furthermore, these taxes were
imposed on a people whose taxable income
had grown, during the war years, by 150
per cent. Lang proposed to levy an average
of 11 per cent, on wages and salaries, in
addition to existing very heavy income taxes,
and he proposed to take 871 per cent, of this
new revenue from persons in receipt of less
than £lO a week.
(1) Hoio to make perfume from flowers?
(2) Where to obtain detailed information? —
4207.
(1) The flowers must be placed between
a laver of a high-grade lard for a period. The
lard'is then treated with rectified spirit of
wine, which has the property of extracting
tlie perfume from the fat. The process is
repeated until the alcohol contains sufficient
of the perfume for use. A simpler process
involves the use of glycerine. (2) From
A. R. Penfold. Curator. Sydney Technolo-
gical Museum, Harris-street.
(1) When was the fox'' introduced into
Australia, and by whom? (2) Has the
domestic cat, gone wild, become a serious
pest? (3) Does its appearance alter much
in its wild state? (4) Is its skin of value?
—4383.
(1) According to the “Ballarat Star” a
Dr. King introduced a pair for breeding
between 1870 and 1880. There were many
other importations at various times. (2)
It preys on rabbits and birds, especially the
tree-living insectivorous species. (3) It
becomes a fine animal with a strong, glossy,
heavy fur; some are exceedingly large. (4)
The skins are normally in good demand, and
this to some extent controls the spread of
wild cats.
Where is Woodlark Island, what does it
produce, and what sort of a place is it? —
4385.
It lies 150 miles to the east of New
Guinea, and was at one time the chief gold-
field of New Guinea. It is about 38 miles
in length from east to west, and is covered
by dense, almost impenetrable vegetation,
but it has been prospected from end to end.
Now there are only a few white men there.
The native inhabitants are of the Melanesian
type.
What did the American Navy do in the
World War?— 43B2.
Principal services were the laying of many
mines in the North Sea, blockade of Austria,
and help in convoying 2,000,000 troops to
France.
(1) Did Canada pay all her own expenses
in the Great War? (2) Are the war pen-
sions as liberal in Canada as in Australia?
(3) Is the Canadian war debt as large as
Australia’s ? —4212.
(1) Yes. (2) In 1929 Canada paid
£8,042,241 to 181,722 war pensioners, an
average of £44 55.; Australia paid £7,755,774
to 272,631 war pensioners, an average of
£2B 9s. (3) An exact comparison is impos-
sible owing to differences in the method of
presenting accounts. Between March 30,
1914. and March 30, 1920, the Canadian
public debt increased by £427,200,000.
Between June 30. 1914. and June 30. 1920.
the Commonwealth debt increased by
£373,800,000. In both cases most of the
increase was due to war expenditure,
What are stone-fish, and how do they
derive their name? —4268.
They belong to a small group which
includes some of the most venomous fishes
known. A common species in Australian
waters inhabits coral reefs, and has a head
and body tinted and marked so as to appear
like a fragment of rock covered with marine
growths; it is so difficult to detect, when
lying still in a pool, that it may be grasped
or trodden upon unawares. Its wrinkled
and warty skin hides needle-like spines, a
prick from which causes intense agony and
may be followed by convulsions and death;
the spines are provided with venom-glands,
and grooves on each side convey the poison
to their tips.
(1) I am thinking of purchasing a news-
agency business in a Melbourne suburb. How
should Igo about, it? (2) llow long should
it take to learn the business? (3) Any books
on the subject? —4ls3.
(1) Before purchasing a newsagency you
must call on the circulation managers of
various daily newspapers for anproval.
Several brokers handle the sales of these
businesses. The Authorised Newsagents’
Association, whose offices arc at 37 Swanston-
street, will give information to any intending
buyer. (2) Depends entirely on the capacity
of the purchaser. Vendors of authorised news-
agencies are bound by their contracts to give
full service to purchasers over a period of
28 days after date of taking possession. A
person with an ordinary capacity for busi-
ness should then be able to carry on. (3) No.
(1) What year did Baron Yon Muller,
botanist at Melbourne Botanical Bardens,
die? (2) What was his address at time of
death? (3) What close relations did he have
in Australia and what arc their addresses?
(4) Did he leave any estate or will? (5)
If so, of what value?— 4ls9.
(1) and (2) October 10, 1896, at his home,
Arnold-street, South Yarra, Melbourne. (3)
His only close relative in Australia was a
sister, who married a Mr. Wehl and resided
in S.A. It is believed that she had two sons,
who may still live there. (4) The Baron left
a will under which his botanical collection,
his works and the bulk of his library were
bequeathed to the State of Victoria, and are
now housed at the National Herbarium. The
executor of the will was Rev. Mr. Potter, who
has since died. No information available as
to disposal of house and other personal pro-
perty. (5) Total value of estate was not
much over £lOOO.
I have received from the Q’land tax office an
assessment for unemployment-relief tax based,
on income derived in the year ended June
30, 1930. I understand the Act did not come
into operation until August, 1930. The assess-
ment notice is dated May 20. and I am
required to pay on June 10 this year. (1)
Was the Act made retrospective? (2) Am
I liable for tax for the period stated? _ (3)
Is the commissioner acting within his rights
in giving me such short notice? (4) If I
am liable, can I claim an extension of time
for payment without incurring penalty?
3800.
(1) and (2) Section 19 of the Act pro-
vides for assessment on the basis of income
received during the year ended June 30.
1930. (3) Section 23 of the Act provides
for 14 days’ notice. (4) Section 23 provides
that the payment of tax may be made in such
instalments as may be allowed by the com-
missioner.
(1) Amount of British capital invested in
Java? (2) The reason why Java, the fifth
in size of the Dutch East Indies, is the most
densely populated? (3) Circumstances of the
1926 Communistic uprising in Java? —4112.
(1) Neither Dutch Consulate nor British
Trade Commissioner has figures; official
estimates are only made by continents. But
it must be enormous; 70 per cent, of rubber
capital is British. (2) It became the centre
of a Hindu civilisation upwards of seven
centuries ago, and is more suitable for rice
cultivation than the other islands. The
Dutch made it their headquarters, and in
1830 introduced the “Culture System” of
forced labor, which enormously extended the
cultivation of coffee, sugar, tea, tobacco and
other commodities suitable for export. At
the same time the Dutch discouraged develop-
ment in the other islands. (3) The rising
occurred at Batavia in Nov.. 1926. Revolts
elsewhere were prevented through the plot
being prematurely revealed. The post office
and other administrative buildings were
seized, but the revolt was cleaned up in a
night. The aim of the rebels was to destroy
Dutch rule, restore the native dynasty and
establish Communism. It was found that the
revolt was inspired by Chinese Bolsheviks
under Russian tutelage, operating from
Shanghai and Singapore. Some 1600 of the
rebels were deported to Dutch New Guinea.
(1) Who named Darnley Island, Torres
Strait, and when? (2) After whom teas it
named? (3) What Australian historians
make reference to the naming of the island?
(4) By ichom teas Darnley Bay, Canada,
named and after whom? (5) Who named
Thursday Island, and what are the earliest
references to it on charts and in historical
ivories? —3073.
(1) Captain William Bligh, whilst in
command of the Providence, on that vessel’s
journey from England to Tahiti in 1791-92.
(2) After Bligh’s kinsman the Earl of
Darnley. (3) Mackaness, Hogan Jack and
Ida Lee. (4) By Dr. (Sir John) Richard-
son, during the expedition of Franklin,
Richardson and Bach in 1825-27. Names
given on that coastline by Richardson were
in connection with Arctic exploration:
Possibly there was a Darnley in their party.
(5) Can’t trace any record as to the first
definite naming of Thursday Island. The
earliest mention we can find is an entry
in the log-book of the Lady Nelson (Cap-
tain Johns) on 15th Sept., 1824, stating
that they had sailed past Thursday Island:
vide Logan Jack and Ida Lee. Oldest chart
on' which name appears is an Admiralty Chart
of Torres and Endeavor Straits, published
1850. A copy is in the Mitchell Library,
Sydney. The first description of Thursday
Island is contained in the “Australia
Directory,” Yol. 2, compiled for the
Admiralty by Lieut. C. Yule, and pub-
lished in 1859. A copy is in the possession
of Capt. F. .T. Bayldon, of Sydney.
I ivish to cover a brick chimney in a kit-
chen with white tiles, also space above a
sink? (1) Price, of tiles? (2) Method of
fitting tiles? (3) Will heat crack them?
(4) Must the wall be cemented up to the
sink from the ground, on a wooden-framed
wall, or is there a way of cementing only
the part, required to be tiled? (5) Propor-
tions of cement to sand required for fixing
tiles? (6) Method of cutting tiles? —4081.
(1) From 15s. to 40s. per square yard.
(2) Start by setting one tile at the lower
left-hand or right-hand corner plumb to blobs
of mortar placed at the remaining corners.
Test with a straight-edge to keep the sur-
face of the tiles level. (3) Yes, if excessive.
(4) On the portion to be tiled nail laths
to the studs about |in. apart, to allow the
mortar to be pressed between and obtain a
key or anchorage. Finish the surface level but
rough. (5) For the first coat make mortar
of 1 part Portland cement, 4 parts clean
sharp sand, reinforced with long cow hair
or chopped and teased hemp pope. Mix all
thoroughly together before adding w T ater.
For second coat, to which tiles are attached,
use 3 parts clean sharp sand and 1 part
Portland cement. (6) Use a diamond, an
American cutting wheel or the edge of a
file. Score the glazed surface with the
cutter, and carefully tap behind the scored
portion till cracking develops. Flat-nosed
pliers with parallel jaws arc used for break-
ing the tile, and these serve to break away
rough edges by nibbling.

“CATTLE CAMP” WAS AWARDED A PRIZE OF £lOO IN THE LATEST “BULLETIN” NOVEL COMPETITION.
By J.J. HARDIE
Synopsis : Margaret Kennedy, on her
way to Corolla station, in North
Queensland, whither she has been in-
vited by Tom Donaldson, father of
her school friend, is rescued from a
seemingly inevitable coach, crash by
Ken Craig, who, riding out of the
bush, shoots the leaders of the bolting
horses. Margaret, who is dressed like
a boy, tries to help him cut the others
loose, but the strain is too much, and
she falls unconscious. Craig, who
had mistaken her for ivhat she looked
like and used language accordingly, is
more embarrassed than ever when he
discovers his mistake. They go on
together to the station, where Donald-
son is pleased, to have her as company
for his daughter, Peggy. Margaret
falls under the spell of Craig's roman-
tic personality, though she resents the
fact that , he is repeatedly doing
things that appear to her to put her
in his debt. The latest of these is
letting her take his favorite pony,
Dawn, without protest. He goes away
to help a queer character, Larry
Nolan, with his horses, and before he
returns to Corella Larry gives him a
magnificent black, which he calls
Eaglehawk, and the popular opinion
regarding which is that, Larry must
have pinched it as a foal. Ken takes
Eaglehawk with him when he goes out
to take charge of the work at Cattle
Camp, where, some time later, Donald-
son and the girls unexpectedly arrive.
By the time they depart Ken, trying
to beat liis growing feelings for Mar-
garet, has returned to the old reclusive
ways that her coming had disturbed.
Boon after he is badly injured in
saving one of his men from being
gored by a bull, and is brought in to
the homestead.
CHAPTER XII {Continued).
“THOUGH job, Miss Kennedy!” The
doctor was delivering his verdict.
“Hard to say what’s under those
bruises, God he has a wonderful
constitution. Few 7 men could have stood
that with any hope. Now 7 I advise you to
go and get some sleep.” He cut short her
protestations. “You can’t do any more here
for a time. Never mind these.” (He nodded
towards the instruments.) “I’ll look after
them. I’ll watch till daylight; and, remem-
ber, I want a nurse fresh for any emergency
to relieve me then.”
Margaret smiled wanly, and took a long
look at the still features before she moved
slowdy away.
The doctor’s eyes followed her admiringly.
He turned to meet Sanderson’s pale eyes.
“That’s a woman! Steady as a rock!
She’ll be feeling the reaction now, though.”
He reflected a moment, his eyes on the
patient. “Anything between them?”
Sanderson’s face was enigmatic. “Couldn’t
say. Not that I know of.”
“Um Oh well! Come over here. I
want a smoke.”
Margaret woke from a troubled sleep
to find the long rays of the morning sun
slanting through the doorway. Quickly
she dressed and slipped out to the verandah
to find Peggy peeping timorously past the
doctor at the form on the bed.
Her heart stopped beating. Was he
dead? Had he slipped away while she
slept? Palefaced, she crept forward, till
the look on the doctor’s face brought back
her assurance.
She could see no visible change in the
wan face on the pillow. Peggy tiptoed
round and squeezed her arm, her eyes still
full of trepidation.
“Doesn’t he look awful?” she whispered.
The doctor’s eyes were on her as she
looked up. “Sleep well?”
She forced a smile and nodded back, but
he was not deceived.
“Pulse is a shade stronger, so I’ll leave
him to you for a while. Go and have a
cup of tea first; then I’ll get some sleep.”
“Has he not come round yet?”
The doctor’s head shook solemnly. “Not
yet, but he ought to, any time now. Call
me if you think it necessary.”
Margaret began her vigil as the morning
sun lost its freshness, and the parched earth
resigned itself to another day’s baking. Out-
side, over the dam, the corellas quarrelled
and screeched till the girl felt murderous
at their senseless clamor.
Distant noises came from the station —
work was going on as usual. The first
shock was over and the men had settled
back again into their attitude of indiffer-
ence. Accidents were not uncommon, death
came to everyone sooner or later. Still,
a remark she had overheard the previous
night betrayed their attitude to this par-
ticular case. Someone had queried:
“Think he’ll peg out?” And a gruff voice
had replied, “Dunno! But it won’t be a
fair thing if he does!”
Almost ever} 7 hour Scotty would slink up.
eyes begging for news; and Dusty had
sauntered up in his casual fashion, waiting
silently at the gate till the girl noticed
him, then answering her head-shake with a
quiet nod, and strolling back to the station.
Suddenly the girl stiffened, her eyes
searching the haggard features as her slim
fingers rested lightly on the pulse. She
imagined she saw an eyelash flicker slightly,
and watched breathlessly. Yes, the pulse
was improving! She was right—a tremor
passed over the immobile features and the
lips moved!
She half-rose to call the doctor, when the
eyes opened, stared unseeingly for a second
before the lids dropped heavily again.
She bent forward, her ear close to his
slow-moving lips, trying to catch the indis-
tinct whisper:
“Margaret!”
She sat down suddenly, the color surging
up to the roots of her hair, her heart pound-
ing. She looked round quickly, wondering
whether to call the doctor, yet glad she had
not done so. The patient had dropped back
into unconsciousness, but the face held a
trace of something that raised hope within
her.
Sternly she took herself to task, resolutely
stamping on her feelings. Was she the only
Margaret in the world? What did she know
of the man’s past? Fool that she was!
Anyhow, beyond the fact that she owed
him a debt of gratitude, he was nothing to
her—he must not be! Impossible!
Peggy’s face appeared inquiringly at the
door, and she moved silently over to
whisper. The blue eyes lit up, and she sped
away to carry the good news. .
A few hours later the doctor appeared,
dishevelled as ever, eyes roving hungrily,
and the watching girl, recognising the drink
craving, advanced to meet him, resolute
that he would remain sober while on the
case.
He greeted her abstractedly, listened to
her news, and together they approached the
bedside. He nodded approvingly at the
change; and, as they waited, Ken’s eyes
opened again, moving slowly as they fell
on the doctor; then, as they strayed to the
tall, slim girl in the cool white frock, a
light gleamed in their depths. Quickly
she bent over him, fearful lest he should
speak again.
“Sh-sh!” she whispered. “Keep quiet for
a while.”
The eyes closed gently. Doctor and nurse
exchanged satisfied glances, and drew out
of range of the patient.
“Good! He’ll do! Now lam going to
arrange a programme. This is going to be a
long job, and you’ll need all the help you
can get. I’ll stay out here for a while—no
need for me in Carinda; this country’s too
beastly healthy. Now, you and I will
manage the night work, and I’m going to
borrow that long man with the mouth like
a steel trap to help during the day. How
about Miss Donaldson?”
“She would love to help. She’s still a
little nervous, but I know she’s dying to do
something.”
They discussed things for a while; then
Margaret resumed her post, feeling re-
lieved and happy. The tension had passed,
and, although the patient’s condition was
very grave, she felt he had a fighting chance.
She knew he would fight, and she deter-
mined to fight with him, to risk everything,
in spite of everything, to drag this splendid
man back to life and health. “It wouldn’t
be a fair thing if he pegged out!”
Ken’s periods of consciousness became
more frequent and of longer duration, but
it was evident that he was suffering intense
pain.
Movement was impossible, except for his
one free uninjured arm, but even breathing
was difficult, and the doctor’s face was
grave for the first few days. The cruel
mass of bruises on the man’s body might
hide anything. Ribs were smashed, the
lungs might have been pierced by a broken
bone, complications might occur; and the
haggard, shabby figure would sit for hours
at the bedside, brow furrowed, eyes intent,
watching the battle with death.
The second night was full of anxiety.
Margaret and the doctor spent the entire
night at the bedside, fighting fiercely for
the life which hung so perilously in the
scales, listening to the difficult breathing
as spasms of agony twisted the features.
The hot night air lay heavy on them,
and the girl fanned desperately at the
man’s face to stir the stifling atmosphere
and thwart the persistent, buzzing mos-
quitoes.
_Just, before the dawn’s thin shimmer
bleached the brilliance of the eastern stars
the breathing became easier, the patient
fell into an untroubled sleep, and the watch-
ers looked across the bed with weary-lidded,
thankful eyes, knowing that the scale was
moving in their favor.
Progress was slow, and even when at the
end of the week the doctor was recalled
to Carinda the patient could not be said
to be out of danger. Margaret saw the
buggy off with a feeling that she had lost
a prop she had learned to lean on during
the hectic week. Now she was alone, the
responsibility hers, and she walked slowly
back to the narrow bed on the verandah.
The man’s eyes questioned her, and she
nodded smilingly back as she bent over
to smooth the pillow.
“Yes, the doctor’s gone. He’s coming
back in a few days, so you’ve got to behave
in the meantime or you’ll get me into
trouble. Now I’m going to leave you with
Peggy for a while,” and her cool hand
brushed his cheek for a moment, bringing
a gleam into the grey eyes.
All hands on the station watched his
progress with grave interest during the first
few days. Tom Sanderson, returning from-
his vigil, would be besieged with questions,
even the blacks joining in their inquiries.
Old Muckeye, bleary-eyecl, fat and blowsy,
sagging breasts swinging low as she waddled
along puffing at a stumpy pipe, would await
the long figure.
“What name?” she would inquire shrilly.
“Not too good, Muckeye!”
“Ummmmm. Close-up finish?”
“Close-up!”
“Ummmmm. Pore fella that one!” And
she would waddle thoughtfully back to the
camp with her news.
Alan Gordon had been out mustering
when the accident occurred, and the news
did not reach him till Joe Taydor’s belated
return to his camp. Margaret never forgot
the old man’s arrival. He had ridden for
hours through the night, and his voice was
gruff with pent-up emotion. He could not
have been more concerned if Ken had been
his own son.
At last, finding he was of no use at that
juncture, he had ridden back. Next day
the sleepless man urged men and tired
horses on till dark, in his anxiety to finish
the muster and get back to the station,
and the men loyally responded.
All his spare time he spent at the home-
stead, and Margaret was glad of his pres-
ence and his help. In spite of his years the
man was tireless, and now that the doctor
was gone she gratefully accepted his offer
to help her with the night nursing.
The hot weather, lack of sleep and
anxiety had left their mark on the girl,
and the old man’s keen eyes noted the
sharpened features and weaiy * eyelids, but
could not persuade her to lessen her efforts.
He also noted how Ken’s eyes lighted on
her approach, how they followed her every-
where; and the bushy beard nodded in
satisfaction.
Scotty and Dusty were permitted a short
visit one afternoon. The pair appeared
nervously oh the verandah, Scotty finger-
ing his hat and licking his lips uneasily,
wide-open eyes scanning the dim figure on
the distant bed; Dusty, casual and diffident
as usual, except for his sudden upward
glances as they awaited admission, and a
feeling that his hands did not belong to him.
Margaret conveyed them to the bedside,
Scotty tiptoeing in front, then stooping
awkwardly near the bed, struggling for
words. Ken’s eyes smiled out of the hag-
gard, unshaven face; his free hand signed
them to a chair, but Dusty shook his head
curtlv as he noisily cleared his throat.
“G’day, Ken!”
The bushman’s greeting was curt and
gruff, but the man on the bed smiled hap-
pily at the familiar phrase. He was not
allowed to speak, and the visitors had been
warned of it, so after an awkward silence—
Margaret had retreated out of earshot—
Dusty dug the Scotchman with his thumb.
“Come on!” he growled. “S’long, Ken. See
you next week!” and his lanky figure
slouched off.
“Good-bye—for the present, Ken! Going
out mustering to-morrow. I’ll come in as
soon as we get back.” And the sturdy
figure of Scotty reluctantly followed.
Thereafter progress was slow but sure,
and the doctor on his return evinced satis-
faction at the state of his patient.
Ken could speak in a low whisper now,
and the doctor’s examination was an easier
matter. At the conclusion he turned to
Margaret.
“Well, Miss Kennedy, I’m turning the
patient over to you now. I’m needed in
Carinda, and the best I can do will be
an occasional visit; but ’phone me every
evening.” He looked down at his patient,
holding his eyes in silent scrutiny, then he
nodded slowfy. “Good-bye for the present,
old chap. Take things easy, and give
Nature a chance to knit those bones.”
He bent low at the beseeching look in
the man’s eyes and heard his painful whis-
per: “Nothing —to stop me riding
again?”
The doctor nodded smiling assurance, and
saw the grey eyes light contentedly.
“You’re a very lucky man, and you can
thank Miss Kennedy for being alive to-
day.” He turned smiling eyes to Margaret,
blushing protestingly. “I mean it, Miss
Kennedy. I only did my job as a doctor;
you did yours as a nurse—and then some-
tiling more. It was that something more
that did the trick. Good-bye!”
Their hands gripped, and his eyes
twinkled. “Keep on as you have been
doing, and you can’t go wrong.”
She watched the bent shoulders of the
shabby figure till it disappeared from view,
sparring for time to recover her composure
before she turned to face the disconcerting
gaze of her patient.
CHAPTER XIII.
Early one morning Margaret woke sud-
denly to the sound of low voices. With
the gradual improvement in her patient’s
condition there was no further need to
watch bjr him all night, but she compro-
mised by having her bed placed within
the doorway of her room, when she could
gain a clear view of the sick man.
Daylight was stealing in, paling the light
of the lamp to a sickly glow. Her heart
missed a beat as a dark form rose from
beside the verandah bed. Who could it
me?
Sinister thoughts of wild blacks crowded
on her, till something familiar in the car-
riage of the dark, slim form—naked save
for a waist-rag—standing out in the grey
light, impinged on her memory.
Silently slipping into a-kimono she moved
out on the verandah. With her sudden
appearance the black figure gasped, dived
noiselessly off the verandah and was gone.
She walked to the edge of the verandah,
and her clear, crisp voice called:
“Jerry!”
No reply.
She turned at a sound from the bed.
Ken beckoned and she walked across.
“Now, look here,” she began, the twinkle
in her eyes belying the firm tone, “don’t
forget I’m responsible for you, and I can’t
stand your visitors coming at all hours of
the night. It simply isn’t done.”
Ken’s eyes were contrite. “I’ll tell him.
Will you call him?”
“I did. But he seems to have dis-
appeared.”
“Call again—like this.” He whistled two
long notes softly through his teeth—the
first high and shrill, followed by a soft
note a few tones lower.
Margaret hummed the notes—her whistle
was inadequate.
“Do it again.”
This time she got the proper key.
“That all?”
“Now call ‘Laimbahn.’”
“Laim—bahn?”
The man’s eyes followed the slim, lightly-
clad figure as she paused on the edge of
the verandah, while the low, mysterious
call floated out on the morning air. She
gazed in the direction the fleeing figure
had taken and called again.
Suddenly she started as a dark form
appeared from behind a low shrub almost
within reach.
Jerry stood silently askance, the bones
outlined on his naked form, the result of
the hard desert life and meagre fare. The
long, red spears in his right hand -pointed
downwards, and he gazed doubtfully at
Margaret, wondering if he could trust this
woman who knew the call.
Recovering from her surprise, Margaret
beckoned, and led the way back to the 1
patient’s bedside. The aborigine followed
diffidently, unused to a roof overhead,
glancing quickly to right and left as if
fearful of a trap.
At Ken’s beckoning hand he advanced
and knelt at the beside like some tamed
wild animal, trusting his master, but dis-
trusting his surroundings.
Ken was speaking to the boy in his own
language. Reassurance came slowly, and
he looked across the bed at the girl with
less of his former distrust.
She drew her chair alongside. “Did you
tell him?”
“Yes, but I’m afraid he won’t come about
in daylight. He’s got shy again since he
went back to his people.”
“Can’t he come in the evening then?”
“As a matter of fact he brought his gin
this morning—she’s somewhere out there.”
The girl’s eyes sparkled with interest.
“Oh, do bring her in. I would love to see
her!”
Ken and the aborigine spoke together
again, the latter doubtfully protesting, but
eventually he turned and glided away.
Margaret’s eyes left him for a second;
when she looked again he had disappeared.
“Do you think she will come?”
“Don’t know r . Don’t think so,” Ken re-
plied. “She’s a myall—never seen white
' people or a house. Someone thfre?”
Margaret turned. Jerry stood alone out-
side, but she would have sworn she saw
a form disappear from his side at her move-
ment.
Jerry was speaking in a low voice, and
gradually a small dark head peered from a
bush behind him. All Margaret could see
was the whites of a pair of rolling eyes
under the short, black hair; then gradu-
ally the slim form moved out of cover and
stood timorously behind Jerry, a dusky slip
of a girl, untrammelled by any notions of
clothing, yet with a natural grace of car-
riage which even fear could not overcome.
Margaret stepped forward, hands stretched
out in welcome. The gin gazed fixedly for
a second, alarmed by the fair white skin
of the advancing figure, then turned and
fled.
Ken smiled as Margaret returned. “Did
she go bush?”
“Bolted like a rabbit!”
Half-closed eyes grinned up at her-
“ She’ll come round gradually. Curiosity
acts that way on her sex.”
Margaret, glanced threateningly at him-
“ Wait till I get at those dressings, mv
lad!”
The grizzled old head stockman spent
every spare minute at the homestead now.
He would wander down unannounced and
establish himself beside the patient, so that
Margaret found time to spare from hei
nursing. The centre of the household had
shifted to the narrow bed on the verandah-

Reduces Operating Expense on Lorries
Heavily loaded lorries driven over rough roads need perfect lubri-
cation to avoid worn chassis bearings and gears.
Sand, grit and dirt quickly wear out bearings. To overcome friction
keep those bearings clean by the use of ALEMITE Lubricant a
pure, solidified oil containing no harmful acids. The ALEMITE
System forces fresh, clean lubricant into the bearings under a
pressure of 3000 lbs., forcing out at the same time all old worn-
out grease, grit, sand and dirt, leaving bearings perfectly clean
and perfectly lubricated.
ALEMITE Gear Lubricant will cushion and protect transmission
and differential gears under all conditions.
Perfect lubrication is the best insurance against friction trouble.

heavy clouds of smoke from among a litter
of newspapers.
The men had got over their initial shy-
ness, and in the evening one or two quiet
forms would slip through the white gate,
and if the coast were clear would slide
comfortably to the floor, back against a
post with a casual “ ’Night, Ken. How’s
she going?” Then ‘their slow, drawling
speech would turn to the affairs of the day
—horses mostly, cattle next, the weather
always. Early thunderstorms were hoped
for, but in the meantime waterholes were
drying fast, weak cattle were daily becom-
ing weaker, gaunt carcases hanging round
the soupy waterholes, and horses losing
condition and that verve which is charac-
teristic of the stock-horse.
Margaret would come and go, quietly
cheerful, and the men lost their shyness in
her presence, so that she learned to know
them as they really were, and grew to
love the quiet, steady-eyed stockmen, exiled
from civilisation, grumbling at their lot,
yet ever realising that the life was of their
own choosing.
So it came about that Ken had more
company than he had ever known for years.
The patient was content to lie still and
listen. The early pain caused by talking
was gradually disappearing, but he still
clung to the excuse, preferring to remain
the audience.
Margaret ruled them all like a despot,
and they bowed to her authority unques-
tioningly. When Peggy and the old head
stockman became involved in argument, as
they invariably did on every meeting, Mar-
garet’s laughing “Peggy!” brought her up
with a sudden, “Sorry, dear; but you know
what this unreasonable old ruffian is when he
gets started.”
Best of all, she loved to sit and listen
when the old, bearded man was the only
visitor. With him Ken dropped his habit
ot silence, and the girl sat quietly content,
breaking in occasionally with a pertinent
remark. Alan Gordon had travelled widely
in his colorful career. He never bragged of
his travels—bragging was utterly foreign
to the man—but he had a refreshing
breadth of vision, and a well-stocked mind
that surprised the girl. There existed an
intimacy between the men, the young and
the old, that allowed the utmost freedom
of speech with never a danger of misunder-
standing.
One morning as he departed she leaned
lazily back watching the erect old figure
pass out into the blinding sunlight, an-
swered his farewell wave at the gate, then
turned to Ken.
“He’s a wonderful old man!”
The grey eyes gleamed at the warm
sincerity in the low voice.
“Yp« He’s—a gentleman!”
girl nodded approval. The defini-
:ed exactly—in every sense.
re a queer crowd—you men out
” There was a hint of mockery in
n’t know what it is about you—a
touch of mystery perhaps. I don’t mean
you, of course. You don’t count.”
“Thanks!” he grinned back at her.
“No, it’s hard to explain. At first glance
you seem an ordinary crowd of men—
quieter than the average, which is in your
favor.”
“Thanks again.”
“Don’t interrupt! But the better I get
to know you the more interesting you are.
Even now, when you do condescend to talk
—to treat me more or less as a fellow-
human instead of some rare specimen—
even now there’s only one man whom I
can say I know something about.”
“Scotty?”
“Yes. Scotty. The others talk—more or
less—and they always have something to
say when they do talk. But what do you
know of them? Why, they might all have
wives and families—they might be princes
or murderers. They all have pasts, but they
have locked them up, and” she hesi-
tated, at a loss for the phrase.
“Are sitting on the lid.”
“Exactly. And you have no idea how
that sort of thing tantalises a woman. Take
Uncle Alan, for instance. I have known
him for months—l seem to have known
him all my life, in fact—yet what do I
really know of him? Nothing! By his
conversation, he must have seen most of
the world. He is well educated, reads
everything worth while, and talks like a
book on anything; and here he is, gallop-
ing after cattle in this”
“God-forsaken ?”
“Yes—God-forsaken country, when most
men of his age would have retired years
ago.”
The man’s chuckle passed unnoticed, and
she went on, warming to her subject.
“There’s Tom Sanderson. The human
oyster. The biggest mystery of you all.
I have seen a look in his eyes that makes
me shudder when I think of it. No, not
really bad! But just a cold, chilling look
—merciless; like a snake. I would hate to
have him for an enemy. And yet look how
he worked when they brought you in.”
Her voice was low and subdued at the sud-
den memory. “He was as gentle as—as
a woman.”
“You ought to see him use a rifle!” Ken
spoke quietly. “He’ll put a bullet through
a kangaroo’s head when I wouldn’t take a
bet on hitting him anywhere.”
“And your faithful adherent Dusty
Rhodes. The Man from Snowy River.
Does he really come from the Monaro?”
“So he reckons —when he gets a few
drinks in.”
“I’ve tried to get him to talk about the
South—l know that country myself,” she
added a trifle wistfully. “Yet he always
slides on to another topic.”
“The fatal curiosity of the sex,” grinned
Ken. “Anyhow, why worry about their
pasts'/ Can’t you be satisfied to judge
them as they are?”
“I like them as they are. Every one of
them. I can’t think of a single man on
the station whom I wouldn’t trust....to
the limit!”
“If Alan were here he would tell you
you practise the low habits of the people
down below.”
“What do you mean?”
“Judging a man by what his father was
where he went to school the people
he knows.”
“Nothing of the kind!” she flashed back
indignantly. Then her voice dropped as
she added wistfully, “But you do like to
know something about them.”
Neither the girl nor the man, deep in
discussion, noticed the advent of the stran-
ger till a low voice with a harsh, rasping
edge to it, brought Margaret round with
a start.
“Boss in?”
She stared at the tattered figure with the
unkempt hair and straggly, grizzled beard
under the battered wreck of a hat. Who
on earth was this? But before she found
her voice she heard Ken speak without
turning his head:
“G’day, Larry! Come in and sit down.”
Still the man hesitated, eying the trim,
white-clad coolness of the girl.
“Come in to where I can get a look at
you. You haven’t met Miss Kennedy,
hive you? It’s Larry Nolan by the sound
of him.”
The old man stepped slowly on to the
verandah.
So this was the famous Larry Nolan!
The idea of this decrepit old wreck, burnt
dark as an aborigine, his toes sticking
through his dilapidated boots, owning a
horse like Eaglehawk seemed so ludicrous
that she wanted to laugh outright.
“How do you do, Mr. Nolan? Take
this chair.”
“No, thanks. I’ll stand. Just looked in
for a minute.” He looked down at the
man in the bed. “Heard you got knocked.
How are you doin’?”
“Did you get the horse?”
The old man nodded, and the girl imag-
ined she saw the sardonic old features
soften for a second; but the harsh voice
twanged on.
“He came back lookin’ so good I went
down to your camp to see what you wanted
to spell him for. Then they told me. Been
actin’ the fool again, I see.”
“I sent Jerry down to turn him out,”
Ken broke in on the belligerent tones. “He
reckoned the big horse stood for a couple
of minutes, then threw up his head and
cleared—due north. How is he?” Ken’s
voice was eager.
“Fine!” The old man plunged into
details, quite oblivious of the girl’s pres-
ence, and Margaret moved quietly away.
So that was the job Jerry had been sent
on—she was seeing daylight now.
The men were still talking in low, sub-
dued tones when she returned bearing a
tea-tray. The old man was squatted, black-
fellovv fashion on the floor—chairs and beds
were items of civilisation outside his hermit
life, and he was making himself at home
in his own way. He started to his feet as
the girl returned.
“Smoke-oh!” she proclaimed. “Milk,
Mr. Nolan?”
The old man recovered from his surprise.
“No milk, thank ye.”
“Help yourself to sugar.”
Ken eyed him, as, glancing furtively
around, he took the cup and saucer doubt-
fully, looking actually ill at ease. “Sit
down, man.”
“Don’t mind me, Mr. Nolan. How’s
Eaglehawk getting along?”
“Pretty good, Miss.” He swallowed the
scalding tea noisily; then, depositing the
cup on the floor at his side, rose to his feet,
the saucer still in his hand.
“I’ll get along,” he rasped, backing fur-
tively away. “See you later.” He did not
even glance at Margaret.
“Larry!”
The shambling figure paused.
“Going to use that saucer for anything?”
The old man became suddenly conscious
of the article in his hand.
“Oh. hell!” He shuffled across, laid the
saucer on the edge of the verandah, and
disappeared.
The girl turned to Ken, her eyes wide
with amazement. “Isn’t he the limit?”
Ken grinned back at her. “You don’t
seem to like my friends.”
“Well, you certainly have a queer col-
lection—blacks, Chinamen and this!”
“Care to join the collection?”
Something in the casual tone caused her
to stop in the doorway a.nd look back.
“No, thanks. I’m still a little bit par-
ticular.”
But the flush on her cheeks was not
wholly due to the heat.
(To be continued next week.)

A sorrow, a sori'ow of dreaming
Baffles the lips of my love.

“THE BULLETIN ” ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF RUSSIA AFTER THU
REVOLUTION. AND AN INSIGHT INTO THE MIND OF THE RUSSIAN.
TO Demyan it still seemed past belief that
he should be walking along the street
of the war-wrecked village, meeting
other soldiers and talking to them; and yet
have no fear of a stray bullet or shell. Yester-
day one would hardly venture to cross
the street even a\ a run ; to-day there was
peace and quiet. It seemed incredible that
the war was really over, at any rate in
Russia. During the years of terrible struggle
Demyan had often lost hope of seeing the
end, and now it had come!
He passed the village and came to the
fields, where holes, dug by shells, gaped like
open wounds in the body of the ploughed
ground. Then In' entered a wood where
broken and maimed trees looked at him from
either side of the road as though reproaching
him. Demyan felt pleased in a way that
it was not his native village that had stood
the ravages of war, not his own field which
stretched outside the village, and not the
wood that stood behind his field.
Yet there was something that oppressed
him in spite of this and of the happiness
which peace had brought. Slowly his mind
worked at the puzzling problem, lumbering
heavily, trying to find a reason or an explana-
tion for things.
“There was Avar,” Demyan thought. “For
years men fought and died, not knoAving
Avhy ; and then suddenly somebody somewhere
said ‘Enough of this,’ and the war stopped.”
He had heard soldiers speak at their meet-
ings lately about a revolution in Russia
and the abdication of the Czar. Until re-
cently, he kneAV, the Czar was the , only
person Avho could do Avith his people what
lie wished: then suddenly came plain men
like himself, and they too seemed to have a
right to do with the people Avliat they
AA-ished. It was all very puzzling.
The road climbed a small hill, then fell
gently and emerged from the wood on to a
clearing, where Demyan could see the rail-
way station, with numbers of red box car-
riages and crowds of soldiers. He pushed
through the throng on the platform, his eyes
searching every face, until in one of the
carriages he found Artem.
“So you arc going home,” Demyan said,
“and avc may never meet again.”
“Oh. yes, Ave will.” Artem assured him.
“I’ll come to your village for a holiday.”
“That Avill be good,” Demyan smiled.
“Then Ave Avill talk of all avc have passed
through.”
“We Avant to forget that,” Artem said
thoughtfully.
“Do you think avc can forget?” Demyan
asked.
“You’ll soon forget,” Artem Avas saying.
“You’ll plough the fields and groAv potatoes,
and forget; but I have no home and no
land.”
“What about getting some, uoav that land
will be plentiful?”
Artem • smiled. “No, Demyan,” he
ansAvered. “You moujicks have carried the
yardstick in your bosom, so to say. for
generations, .so that you Avould be ready to
measure up the land of the pomeschiek and
get your share. The land belongs to you,
Demyan: you till the soil and grow bread,
and we workers Avill see that no one takes
it aAvay from you.”
They Avere silent for a while. Artem
thought of the Revolution and the part he
was likely to play in it, Avhilc Demyan
thought of his friendship for Artem and
felt sad at parting. They had been stran-
gers before the war, but the life in the
trenches, their mutual sufferings and danger,
had created a bond binding them very close
together. At this instant Demyan Avas re-
membering the advance of the Russian armies
under General Samsonov into East Prussia
—lioav towns and Aillages had fallen
Avithout resistance, and lioav Artem had
thought the war would be over soon. But
then had come the disastrous retreat after
the battle of Soldau : several corps marching
along a narrow road, while from every house
a shower of bullets rained upon them, shells
tearing huge gaps in their ranks, as the army,
hopeless and helpless, marched on. And then
the terrible slaughter of the Mazurian
swamps! Like unwanted kittens they had
been driven into the treacherous swamps,
sinking, drowning. Ninety thousand had
surrendered to the Germans; thirty thousand
had perished. Only a remnant had escaped
into the woods, where General Samsonov had
committed suicide, unable to survive the
defeat. Demyan and Artem had lived like
hunted animals, fearing to leave the protec-
tion of the giant trees, coming out only when
hunger compelled them to rob some passing
peasant. How could one forget these things?
The sound of a bell ended their reverie.
“Good-bye, Demyan,” Artem said, stretch-
ing out his hand ; then they embraced and
kissed three times. It was hard for both
of them to speak; and Avhen the train began
to move, the engine filling the air Avith
smoke, Demyan ran along the platform shout-
ing : “Don’t forget to come, Artem.”
Y a Iking back, Demyan felt more de-
pressed than eAcr. The Avood and the field
and the village were all silent Avitnesses to
the catastrophe which had befallen man-
kind. Men and beasts, toAvns and villages,
fields and forests had been drawn into the
maelstrom. Not a thing had escaped. Still,
the Avar Avas over iioav, and Demyan said
aloud: “Thank God, there is peace!” and
his thoughts turned to his village, to his
wife, to the land. Wonderful visions rose
in his mind; pictures of fields with golden
corn : of fat coavs and beautiful horses; of
a white cottage, Avith a seat under the win-
doAvs facing the street; children, boys and
girls, running about the house —and all this
his! He, Demyan, free and happy, the sole
owner of it all!
Demyan’s return to the village was not,
however,, hailed Avith special delight by the
rest of the peasants, for, as they saw, it
meant giving him a share of the newly-
acquired land. But that did not disturb
Demyan; and while the other moujicks dis-
cussed politics, lie set about to repair his
house, mend the fences and do many other
tiling's which had been left undone during
his absence. Of the war lie thought but
little, though now and again news reached
him of the struggle within Russia, which foi
its cruelty exceeded a war with any outside
enemy.
The first actual knowledge of the trouble
came to the village with the White armies.
They demanded food and horses, cattle and
pigs, paying for everything with worthless
paper money. Demyan saw the result of
his labor disappearing with the departing
Whites, and prayed for the coming of the
Bolsheviks—the people’s friends.
Again Demyan went to work in the fields
and watched his wheat rising, and in due
time ripening.
When the grain had been gathered the
Red armies came, driving the Whites
out. But their armies, too, needed food
and horses, cattle and fowls; so again
Demyan’s possessions were taken from him ;
and this time lie got not even worthless
paper money in return. The peasants began
to. wonder whether they really had any
friends, and whether all armies, White and
Red alike, considered them merely tools to
produce food.
Demyan went about, .sullen and silent. lie
had lost his will to work, lie no longer
ploughed all the land he owned, and sowed
.lust enough to provide bread for himself and
family. His clothes fell to pieces, but he
could not buy any to replace them. Ilis
military boots could no longer be repaired,
and the money he possessed was useless, be-
cause there were no boots to be bought.
Demyan made himself a pair of tapti out of
the bark of trees, as his ancestors had done
for many generations. Instead of peace and
happiness which Demyan expected after the
Avar there was more suffering than ever and
a far greater struggle.
Government proclamations hoav demanded
the surrender of part of the harvested gram
to the State: "But why should Ave give
them bread, ’ the peasants argued, “when
they give us nothing?” So Demyan hid
the surplus of his grain, refusing to either
sell it for money which was useless or give
it to the Government. The State needed
bread, the peasants would not produce it,
and thus the struggle Went on. Decrees
Avere issued threatening the moujicks Avith
penalties. Peasants in whose possession
hour Avas found were sent to gaol; but it
produced no effect, except that soldiers avlio
were sent to search the peasants’ homes
Avere beaten and killed.
Demyan Avent about his Avork determined
not to give in. For centuries the peasants
had been serfs, belonging body and' soul to
the rich landoAvner; and noev, when freedom
had come at last, the State wanted to ensla\*c
them again. “Never !” Demyan cried ; and
millions of peasants repeated “Never!”
Then came the final blow. All private
ownership of land Avas abolished, and vil-
were organised for collective farming
('kolkhoz”) each district being obliged to
deliver to the State a percentage of its har-
vest. So Demyan saw his land merge into
the common possession of the kolkhoz. Ho
could no longer say, “This is my land, and
Vn el ? • 1 , dle if wiU he my children’s land.”
All his hopes had suddenly crumbled, fallen
to tiie dust. He knew that in the future
he and his fields would form just a part of
the country—that he would work and get
a share of the product merely to cnahle
linn to continue tilling.
To Demyan this new law appeared but a
continuation of the old system with a change
of masters. He was a land worker, and to
be divorced from the soil was death. Often
he passed the plot of land which had been
, but now there Avas nothing to
divide it from the farms of the rest of the
village. His land had disappeared.
Harvest time Avas finished, and the State
demanded its quota of grain; but the
peasants did nothing to deliver it. Soldiers
invaded the village and searched houses and
sheds, while the peasants looked on gloomily
Demyan stood at the gate of his house!
waiting for the approaching soldiers. Anger
blazed Avithin him. He would not let them
come into his home and take away things
which were needed by his wife aud children.
Had he not fought in the war for years to
protect his land? And so he Avould protect
it again.
The soldiers were coming near n0w....
He hated these soldiers of the Red Army.
They Avere the incarnation of all his troubles!
To him they were enemies, men avlio did
not understand the peasant and his love for
the soil; men avlio came to rob the peasant.
He felt an overwhelming desire to drive
them out of the village, to make them feel
that the moujicks Avere still the owners of
the houses and the land, and that they would
never give up their rights.
He could hear a strange whispering in
his ears. “Don't surrender,” it said. “Look
well into the past. See the men and women
of your OAvn blood suffering untold miseries,
tortures and humiliations: and yet they
clung to the land through it ali. Sold into
slavery, flogged and ravished, they bore their
sufferings and remained near the soil which
healed their wounds. They said: ‘To you,
Demyan, we have given the land in trust
-so that you may pass it on to your
children.’ ”
"I will not surrender,” said Demyan, and
shook with suppressed excitement.
The soldiers were in the village now
lie went inside and came out again with a
heavy iron bar.
Evening came and the soldiers continued
to come out of houses carrying bags of con-
fiscated grain. Groups of peasants gathered
in the streets watching their property taken
away, yet felt helpless' to prevent it.
Demyan stood at his gate, grim and silent.
Several times his wife tried to dissuade him
from his dangerous intention; but always
he said "Go away, Paraskovya,” and though
he said it quietly enough, the woman knew
it was no use arguing.
Night fell, spreading a black cover over the
village. Only the flickering lights of the
lamps carried by the soldiers pierced the
darkness. Tiring of his watch, Demyan went
inside and poured water into the samovar
that he might drink.
The coal was crackling when sounds
reached him from the shed behind the house,
lie came out walking noiselessly and saw a
black figure near the door. Gripping the
iron, and creeping in the shadow of the
house, he waited. His heart was full of
hate for this man who came to rob him; and
when within striking distance, he raised
the iron and crashed it on the soldier's head.
Demyan lit a match and bent over the
huddled figure on the ground. And the eyes
of Artem looked straight into liis!
“Artem! Artem!” Demyan cried.
li'is anger vanished and only fear, pity and
a terrible sorrow remained. He put his hand
under Artem’s head and felt the warm blood
trickling through his fingers.
Again he called “Artem !”
The moon appeared from behind a cloud,
throwing a pale light upon the two men.
Artem moved slightly, then murmured.
“Demyan, why did you do it? You asked
me to come to you !”
Demyan whispered passionately:
"I asked you to come as a friend, but you
came to rob my wife and children.”
‘I am still your friend,” said Artem
faintly, “only you will not see it. I am a
friend of your children and the thousands of
other children who are hungry and homeless
in Russia. They, too, need bread.” ■
Demyan felt suddenly ashamed. In the
gloom before him he thought he could see
an .army of children, their bodies emaciated,
their eyes sunken and rags covering the dirt,\
wasted figures. With their thin fingers they
pointed at Demyan, accusing him of ref ns
ing them food. Hurriedly Demyan spoke
defending himself, explaining what the land
meant to him, liis voice rising and falling, a
torrent of words issuing from his mouth. lie
caught Artem's hand in 1 the dark, finding it
cold and rigid.
Fear seized Demyan. It pressed him like
an iron vyce.
“Say something, Artem,” he begged.
Then a feeling of hopelessness came over
him. Things were too confused for a peasant
to understand.. There was no stability, no
certainty in anything. Friendship, relation-
ship, everything had broken down. Tears
began to flow down liis cheeks into his beard
and thence to the ground, where they mingled
with the blood of Artem.
A night bird passed overhead and
descended on to the roof of the shed. For
some time it sat still, as though listening to
the incoherent speech of Demyan ; then with
a shrill cry it flew into the night.

THE
WARATAH
FENCE COSTS
LESS TO BOY AND
LESS TO ERECT THAN
SINGLE WIRES S DROPPERS
CAN YOU AFFORD TO IGNORE
THIS SAVING?
Many farmers have the idea that it costs more to erect
an all-metal fence than an ordinary wire-and-dropper
fence. This is not the case. It is definitely cheaper to erect
a Waratah Fence, “Hinged Joint.”
In addition to the saving in first cost, the Waratah Fence
“Hinged Joint,” offers you these other advantages:—
1— It is fireproof
2 It is stockproof
3 It is weatherproof
4 It will last a lifetime
5 The improved appearance will add to the
value of your property and will more than compensate for the first cost. It immedi-
ately suggests efficiency, safety and progress.
