Amiwud is essentially for interior decoration. It takes
the place of wood in walls of wooden houses, and of lath

Amiwud is very strong; chairs can be knocked against
it and it will not crack. Even heavy weights on it will
not hurt it. For this reason alone it is superior to
plaster.

More War
Ilindenburg''s March Into London, trans-
lated from tbe German by L. G. Redmond-
Howard (Long, per E. W. Cole, Sydney;
Is. 3d.), is, so far, tbe funniest book on tlie
war. So absurd is this forecast that the
reader almost suspects that it has been
written, as a satire on German psychology,
by an Englishman. But apparently they do
these things in all seriousness in Verminy.
And, certainly, no English author could in-
vent the examples of Hun humor with which
the Hun author has alleviated his horrors.
The war is, of course, solely due to ,Eng-
land. That Machiavellian nation even
founded, long before the war, “the world-
historical Isolation Society for the Destruc-
tion and Dividing Up of Germany.” And
“the devilish plan for the destruction of Ger-
many was settled in London, had been con-
sidered for years carefully iu all its details,
and if signs and wonders had not happened,
it must, in human judgment, have led to
complete success.. .According-to the articles
of the British Isolation Society, the torch
flamed up in Russia first. It was, in truth,
ignited two years too soon; but otherwise
everything went as laid down in the pro-
gramme.” And that programme was
thorough. “As early as 1913, in Maubeurge,
the Isolation Society had had mountains of
munitions piled up, and it had compelled
Belgium to develop Antwerp into the most
powerful fortress in the world.”
However, “Young Michael,” we are inter-
ested to learn, “in the second year of the
war possessed tbe same laughing confidence
of victory as on tlie first day of mobilisa-
tion.” But before Ilindenburg can march to
London certain “signs and wonders” had to
happen; and the German author kindly pro-
vides them for us. First, Russia concludes
a separate peace with her conquerors ; next,
tbe noble, but almost forgotten exhortation,
“On, on to Calais!” materialises, and Hin-
depburg captures that city. Curiously
enough, tbe attack ou Verdun is anticipated
by the author’s account of the attack on
Calais. “The Eastern motor-batteries and
the Essen giants” are the cause of the col-
lapse of the French and British armies. Well,
they have failed at Verdun. The final
miracle occupies only one paragraph: “A
giant swarm of Zeppelins, of whose size even
German soldiers did not venture to dream,
travelled one .foggy morning to the west
coast of England and sought out the British
navy. With a thousand bombs 50 full hits
were made. Explosions completed the work
of destruction. Almost at tbe same time a
gigantic fleet of submarines broke into the
British naval harbor 1 and completed the
work.” Evidently that is the Hun concep-
tion of “The Day.”
For eight days new giant Ivrupp guns at
Calais destroyed everything living on the
south coast of England ; then three water-
ways from Zeebrugge, Dunkirk and Calais to
England were secured east and west by a
steel wall of torpedo boats and njines and
submarines, and the Hun army landed in
England. But, of course, England did not
fight fairly. The noble Huns bad “to face a
sharpshooters’ warfare, exceeding in its
atrocities the performance of Belgian black-
guards.” It is curious to find the lie about
the Belgians still persisting in the minds of
tbe Huns after this lapse of time. So the
Huns nobly protest. “We shall repeat the
lesson of Louvain upon the shooters from
behind hedges if need be! We want an
honorable, battle with soldiers!”
At this stage the author finds it necessary
to introduce another miracle—also in one
paragraph. “Germans, Austrians and Turks
have fought the decisive battle at the Pyra-
mids ! The British army is in great part
broken up; the rest have been captured.”
But still the British will not play the game.
“The Euglish drive before them all captive
Germans, soldiers and civilians as bullet
shields.” Evidently some echoes of the Hun
tactics have filtered through into Verminy;
but note how delightfully the author trans-
poses his facts! The capture and surrender
of London is painstakingly described,' and
made more gruesome here and there, by
depressing examples of Hun humor. Even
to the author, however, the assault on London
seems a difficult job; hut then he probably
remembered that if it were a walk-oyer
there would be no credit for Ilindenburg.
The author’s mistakes are delicious. He
pictures the Indian troops as being driven
into the front ranks of the battle by their
brutal English masters. He states that the
British offered £6 “for the head of a German-
Turk delivered dead or alive to the English
army.” And he believes that it is Australian
blacks who are fighting against him. What
funny things these Huns are told!
wo are told that: “There are two words in
the German language which are possessed
alone by Germany and which cannot be
translated into English in all their meanings.
One is ‘Qemuet’ {innermost fine feeling) and
the other ‘Froemmigkeit’ ( religious seme)."
The Huns can have them, but it is difficult
to credit them with any use for them.

The indictment of such a book as Towards
a Lasting Settlement, by a number of essay-
ists, edited by Charles Roden Buxton (Allen
and Unwin,_ 2s. 6d.), is its prevailing dulness.
This book is the product of minds that are
not bright. G. Lowes Dickinson is right in
stressing the fact that the mistrust of the
two groups of Powers in Europe was mutual.
“The Germans believed that the Entente was
a hostile and aggressive combination directed
against them.” ‘lt was even so regarded by
a neutral State like Belgium. “The war may
have been a war of mutual fear
Duplicity was hound to be suspected on both
sides.” The system was enough in itself to
produce war.
H. Sidebotham, discussing British “naval-
ism,” aptly calls attention to the American
opinion of our naval policy. At the begin-
ning of the war the average American was
prepared to think of British naval power
much as the Englishman thinks of German
military power. And the.author draws an
interesting parallel between German militar-
ism and British “navalism” —hardly to our
advantage. To the American British naval
policy was, and is, as much a tyranny on
sea as, to us, German militarism is tyranny-
on land. And he is not the only contributor
to this volume who points out that the ques-
tion of British “navalism” is one that
Edward Grey has declared might well form
the subject of negotiation at the peace con-
ference.
But J. A. Hobson, in his essay, “The
Open Door,” betrays an appalling ignorance
of the ideals of the Dominions. His Free
Trade proposal for settling the difficulties of
Europe after the war is delightfully naive:
“Supposing that the eight Great Powers,
together with the smaller developed Euro-
pean countries, could come to an agreement
for _ the equal admission of their trade and
capital to all colonial possessions, etc., not
merely would the gravest causes of future
antagonism be removed, but substantial new
bonds of community of international inter-
est would be provided.” He forgot to add —
at Australia’s expense. And though he has
to admit that the flooding of our markets
by untaxed imports fron l the whole of
Europe is at present barred by “the prefer-
ential tariffs of our self-governing domi-
nions,” lie cheekily asks whether that
obstacle is insuperable. It is.
The other essays range from the super-
fluous to the banal: and the miasma of stolid
dulness lies over the lot.

At last this persistent page has discovered
a cookery book that is willing to divulge the
secret of boiling an egg. This apparently
indispensable feat in cookery has hitherto
been overlooked by. author-cooks. But the
“Presbyterian” Cookery Book, the 14th edi-
tion, of which revised and enlarged, complet-
ing 200,000 copies, has been published by
Angus and Robertson for Is., has full infor-
mation on this important point, and
actually provides an index that tells
you where to find the recipe. “Put
the eggs into boiling water. Draw the
saucepan to the side of the fire, and do not
let the water boil again. In five or six
minutes the eggs will be done.” Quite simple,
after all, you see! Clara Kirkland, the hon.
editor for the Woman's Missionary Associa-
tion of the Scotchbyterian Church of N.S.W.,
regards it as significant that many discern-
ing women have made it a habit to give a
copy of this manual to every new bride of
their acquaintance. This cheaply solves
the awkward _ wedding-present problem.
Those many discerning women must have
been Scotch.
J*
Commonsense Hints on Plain Cookery,
compiled by the Cookery Teachers’ Associa-
tion of N.S.W. (Angus and Robertson, Is.),
is a kind of text-book of cookery, intended
as a guide to students in Domestic Science
Schools and “young home-makers.” It
is without recipes. Thus, it modestly re-
frains from telling you how to boil an egg,
but it informs you of the effect of heat on
eggs, the composition of eggs, and gives valu-
able information that will instruct you when
an egg is in the right state of decomposition
for use on election days. But it does give
nine rules for making tea. This work is
meant to be a companion to the Common-
sense Cookery Book.

Lieut. Stupart must now rank among the
“best sellers” of the Commonwealth. He is
the author of innumerable military manuals
which explain with fuller detail various
departments of military instruction, or pro-
vide instruction in the new aspects of mili-
tary work rendered necessary by the new
tactics of this war. Since the war obligingly
broke out to increase the author’s sales, his
publishers, Angus and Robertson, Sydney,
have sold over 250,000 copies of his little
textbooks. _ Three new manuals are now
issued. Lieut. Stupart’s Hints to Young
Officers (Is. 6d.) is now in its third revised
and enlarged edition. It mentions those
minutice of etiquette and duties that most
young officers discover only by experience.
The curious development of trench-warfare
has led other experts to give the results of
their experience to the military public. Staff-
Sergt.-Major D. Fallon provides a compre-
hensive manual of How to Learn and In-
struct in Bayonet Fighting (Is. 6d.), with
55 illustrative photographs; and Lieut. G.
Dyson offers valuable information upon
Grenade Warfare (9d.).

Norman Duncan’s Australian Byways
(Harper, New York, per Dymock’s Library)
is a readable American view of our conti-
nent, unfortunately illustrated by an Ameri-
can artist who quite fails to achieve any
suggestion of our characteristic flora, land-
scape or costume. The author came evi-
dently quite determined to discover Australia
and the Australians for the United States;
and, of course, he did not look for the typi-
cal Australian in the cities. Yet, what more
typical Australian could be found than our
present Prime Minister —a product of the
city? So Norman Duncan leisurely wanders
out west, on camel-back for preference, delib-
erately seeking out the more antiquated
methods of locomotion, scorning the motor
and the rail, and pursuing into the far in-
terior the last of the mail coaches. And
everywhere he chatted to the Australian, and
the kindly Australian told the stranger abo-
riginalities, and the stronger the yarn the
better Norman Duncan liked it. These yarns
make such excellent copy’ for the New York-
ers. And, after all, many of them are true.
However, Norman Duncan is a friendly
visitor: he is naturally proud of a continent
that, almost unaided, lie has discovered for
the United States. And he tries to be fair.
“Australia is a vast, inviting place: it
measures 422 miles more in area than the
United States of America proper.” And
well found is this yarn of our national in-
terest in the moke.
“ ‘There’s my beauty!’ said an Australian
stockbroker, displaying the photograph of a
sturdy little boy astride a slim horse.
“ ‘Fine boy,’ I agreed.
“‘Oli,’ said he, * that’s my son!’
“ ‘Fine horse,’ said I quickly.”
And, though naturally our visitor exag-
gerates the discomforts of our clime and the
danger of our lives, he can make amends by
a little common-sense.- “The traveller is
astonished, upon his return, to be told that
Australia has been written down by some as
an arid waste. It is an unjust and injuri-
ous fiction. Australia is preponderantly fer-
tile and rich, a pleasant country, with abun-
dantly generous rewards, growing all the
while more populous and rich ; and the dry
interior neither discomforts nor beggars the
aspiring and prosperous people who dwell in
the many favorable lands more than it
troubles the happiness of the inhabitants of
any other continent. The Australian dry-
lands, which narrow, year by year, as they
are better known, have been celebrated above
the wealthy places for the sensation they
afford —the hot winds, the burning days, the
stony deserts and waterless sandy tracts.”
Yet it is just these aspects of Aus-
tralia that this foreign author, intent on
interesting his own people, and being a good
journalist, has perforce to stress. But we
forgive him because: “All at once a shilling
copy of the Popular Verses of Henry Law-
son, that poet of the Australian bush, caught
us off our feet.”
-* • ■■
“Copabella”: What is it that confers the
title “Australian” on a poet?’ Must he be
born here, or need he only visit here, write
verses here or mention Australia in his
verse? The outstanding characteristic of
the Oxford professor’s list of our poets
(Red Page, 20/l/’l6) was their unknown-
ness to the average Australian. What Aus-
tralian ever heard of Parkes or Sladen,
Reeves or Gilbert White —as poets? Eng-
lish papers (and the “correct” Australian
dailies) always refer to Adam Lindsay
Gordon as the representative Australian
poet. AY hat constitutes representation?
Only a bare handful of A.L.G.’s verses
mention Australia and its features, and
even these are English of the English in
tone and thought. Perhaps their English-
ness makes them representative—smacking
as they do of “imported” culture, so differ-
ent from the vulgar Australian of The Sen-
timental Bloke* Pat MacDurmcr and The
Man from Ironbark. Representative of
whom —the professorial board, or Billjim of
Redgum Flat or Yarraville? This eternal
quoting of Gordon as the representative Aus-
tralian poet makes me tired. Perhaps I’m
a Philistine, hut I’ve read him and re-read
him, and never found him get within
coo-ee of the real Australian Bush—
and his sick stockrider’s reference to Jem
Hall always conjures up in my mind the
pinhead farm louts, Zam’l and Jake and
Goiles, drinking “four-half” and discussing
“Squire” and “Passon” in the taproom of
a wayside alehouse near Stow i’ th’ Wold !
Who is the representative Australian, any-
how —Bill or the professor? I never had
much truck with the latter, but I battled
among the selections, wheat farms and
shearing sheds of the Riverina for half a
dozen years, and never once did I hear
A.L.G. quoted (except unconsciously and
incorrectly in the very English “How We
Beat the Favorite”) ; while Henry Lawson,
Banjo Paterson, Brunton Stephens, with
some of Edward Dyson, Will Ogilvie and
Garnet Walcli, were household words and
recited and applauded at every bush
“shivoo.” But perhaps these aren’t poets
nor their verses literature. Contrariwise,
perhaps Billjim isn’t competent to judge
literature. In either of these cases we’d
have to classify our poets into popularly-
representative and literarily-representative
—with writers of hymns quoted by arch-
bishops in a class of their own!
London Times thanks Harry Lawson for
his book, My Army, O my Army!: —
The war has brought forth, in the Mother Coun-
try, a good deal of fine poetry in which the spirit of
the Empire speaks. We have met with nothing quite
like Mr. Lawson’s verses. They express the common
sense of the U&in man, as well as his faith and
hope. They keep their eye on the object; they will
appeal to people whom the loftier pitch of poetrv
may leave unaffected. Their long, qasy, galloping
measure carries the reader along like a good horse,
and the poems are full of color and of high spirit.
Mr. Lawson writes of Russia in a way that will
bring her nearer to many yet strangers.’ He chants
the doings of the Salvation Army. Also, he can
laugh meanwhile. He laughs at the comic side of
the activities which the war has called out, and his
laughter is the very surest proof that his admiration
is sincere. His is a convincing, an authentic, voice.
He has surrendered nothing 1 to the fashion or to the
craze of the hour, and his characteristic colonial
freedom and independence make his songs significant
and true.
The Way of the Cross
When, under the tremendous attack of a
Huns, the whole western wall of n . the
house fell in, and Russia decided to wf*
desert for the invader, no adequate - a
was made for the reception of the Sl- 10n
that, perforce, had to stream eastwnrd V6S
Russia. ‘‘The Russian tendency to Slav”?
delay fatally, always and in *
Russia innumerable lives. The 5
was, however, alleviated somewhat by 5!
work of pu '.lie relief organisations, the ,1
preceden cd mildness of the autumn at Z
time of the great migration, and the SUf JL
compulsory sobriety of the Russians “ d
The story of this extraordinary heiir, nf
fugitives is told with a marvellous vividJ
by V. Doroshevitch, whose account n rT
event is translated by Stephen traif the
The Way of the Cross (Constable; 2s Gdf
This is probably the first piece of RuS
whr literature to be translated into EnS
and the translation is brilliant. DoroSwS
is a famous Russian journalist whose iour-
nalistic style, as will be seen, is remarkable
Indeed, his style has captured the journalists
of Russia ; and this vivid, ejaculatory
must make the Russian newspapers eve
more interesting than,' say, The Sydke!
Mquninc Heealp It 4s to be remembered
too that Doroshevitch s articles and feuilk
tons are intended to be read aloud.
Doroshevitch went from Moscow to meet
the refugees, passed through it and brough
back The Way of the Cross.
J*
Have you been long on the road?
A tohole eternity!
J can’t make it out—said one of the
fugitives to me. He was serving as a
soldier.
I can’t make it out: either my home
■was all a dream, or I’ve gone out of my
mind now, and God knows when I shall
understand. My home burnt, cattle drowned
in the river, no little wife, she died on the
road; my two children also died, and ice
buried them by the wayside and put crosses
over the graves. I’ve got one son left and
one horse. That’s all we are in the world.
Is it possible that I am the same man that
I was?....
J*
What is in the carts?
You meet the very strangest cartloads.
They sometimes carry—layers of iron.
The roof!
It teas the most valued possession.
—Their cottage had. an iron roof,
When they were forced to flee they took
this most valued thing and carried it they
knew not whither.
Why?
It teas the most valuable...,
J*
Along this “Way of the Cross” takes
place:
- A selection.
A terrible “natural” selection.
All the weak ones perish.
Both of people and cattle....
Look, at the twenty-verst post of the road
gleams a white cross.
Three more crosses.
More still.
Still new ones, more new ones, yester-
day’s cemetery.
They are white, like little Georgian
crosses, crosses pinned to the much-suffering
road.
Just like Georgian orders:
For self-sacrifice.
“They” do the burying at nights. ...
In the daytime, at the stopping places, at
the relief and medical points, they
—■ conceal their corpses,
fearing that they may be delayed by for-
malities:
and remain behind!....
They carry out the corpses from the forest
where they hare spent the night and bring
them to the road.
They must bury them in a place where
the people pass by.
- Where man coming past, will cross him-
self and pray for the soul of the departed.
For you see, the dead have not had their due
singing and prayers as at a proper funeral
service. . . .
jt
I stop at one collection of graves, at a
second, at a third.
There are some which breathe horror.
Three, five, crosses, and on all:
The 17th of September.
■ —■ The 17th of September.
—• The 17th of September. _
In one day, all. In one night a cemetery
grew up....
Somebody has been buried.
Others see:
That it is a nice place. #
And lay their oivn dead with the others,
side by side. ..
And yet more come, and yet more.
the cemetery grows, stretching itself alO g
the margin of the road. .
And one reads the heart-breaking inscrip-
tions on the crosses:
Infant.
Infant.
Yes, truly, it is the province of Mogilaf-
Every three, every five versts, ana *
every two versts, and every verst, or >
crosses, crosses.
A continuous cemetery....
* “Mogila” is Russian for a grave.

Australia Riddled with
Deadly Kidney Disease
ALMOST EVERYBODY COMPLAINING.
Kidney disease is most certainly on the in-
crease. Thousands and thousands of people
in the towns and villages of this country are
in terrible danger of deadly kidney disease.
This insidious disease creeps on, gradu-
ally getting a firmer and firmer grip, until
when it is too late the poor sufferer discovers
he has Bright’s Disease. Have you kidney
trouble? Do you know how to recognise
whether you are suffering- from this or not?
Here are some of the symptoms of kidney
disease : Aches and pains in various parts of
the body, nasty taste in the mouth first thing
in the morning, constipation, cloudy and bad-
colored urine, general feeling of weakness
and irritability, puffiness under the eyes—
these are all symptoms of kidney trouble.
And then people who suffer from backache,
rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone or
pains in the bladder, muscles and joints are
all suffering these pains through weak or
diseased kidneys, for these are the sure and
certain symptoms of kidney trouble.
All these things mean that the kidneys are
weak and diseased. They need strengthening
and making healthy.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your

chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid of
the cause —the poisonous uric acid. Remem-
ber to do this a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder and not
through the bowels, as most kidney pills do.
When you see the urine change to a muddy
bluish color—a feature which distinguishes
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills from all
others—you know beyond all doubt that they
have put their healing touch on the right
spot—the kidneys and the bladder. A won-
derful pill—straight to the kidneys—-that is
why De Witt’s Pills give such amazingly
quick relief —every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Look for that
blue-colored urine.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or bow badly
you have suffered.

Burden of sweets on the cry-throng’d air;
Dazzling blue through the gaps o’erhead ;
Green-framed casement perching there
Glimpsing a languor on night-sweets fed.
Sleek beauty, ’tis meet your thought stray far
From your perfumed lair o’er the Scent
Bazaar.
Grey minaret, mellowed by Egypt’s sun,
Grace in your slender pose,
You. have stood through the cycles of years
that were run
Ere the syrups distilled from the Persian

Were marketed round your hallowed mosque-

The incense of worship to Allah ascends
With the prayers of the Faithful race;
And worshipping incense the phial lends,
Op’ning its wealth to the fair from afar,
Taking their toll of the Scent Bazaar.

Drugged with the essence of myrrh—
The whirl of the world, what recks he of

Nothing he asks of her
But toilers, that Eastern flow’rs may blow,
And the price of perfumes, that more may
grow.
Beauty comes veiled and sits at his feet,
Breathing more wares than her purse can

Leaning in ecstasy nearer to greet
Rich breath of attars, with sensuous cry ;
Black eyes shine tranced o’er the fair mouth’s
bar,
Drunken with sweets in the Scent Bazaar.

Fenced Off!
We used to come here of an evening
When all the bright west was aglow,
And life was a garden of roses —
A boy and a girl long ago.
Beneath us was movement and sparkle,
Or stillness and color and calm ;
And the breeze from the sea on our foreheads
Was sweet with a magical balm.
’Twas ever and ever a wonder
This cove, as, hand lying in hand,
We stood here and watched it together,
Its waters and sickle of sand.
We watched the brave lights on its bosom
Grow delicate, shadowed and faint —
A cameo such as no artist
But Nature the Master could paint.
Your hair was as brown as the bracken
That loses its green and grows old,
Yet hinting, when noon gives it lustre,
Of something more golden than gold.
Your eyes—did they dream of this moment,
When all is grown squalid and grey,
Of the scene that has passed from our vision,
The rock and the beach and the bay?
They have builded high walls and tall fences,
And outcasts and aliens are we;
The beauty that charmed us as children
No more ’tis our glory to see.
Where now are the calm and the color,
The waters that rippled and curled?
Was it well, was it right to deny us
This bit of God’s beautiful world?

A Spring Morning.
Long ere the sun was fairly up,
While yet warm earth lay half adream,
I drank from morning’s glory-cup
And plunged all breathless in the stream.
Unwearied birds with dazzled wings
Flashed past and screalned triumphantly,
The happiest of created things;
I would I might as happy be I
Beside the silver margin heaves
A hill, where weed-buds shone amid
The welcome press of fallen leaves
And mossy turf and lichens hid.
Within the veins of every tree,
Within the heart that breathless sings,
Life’s green-fire leapt mysteriously
And stirred the deepest shadow:::~3.

In simple signs so faithfully
E’en grief might understand them, too!

Wild creatures crawled to greet t’.c son
With dazzled eyes; by such fair meeds
He gladdens e’en the lowliest one!
In calm suburban gardens bees
Sipped cool wine-cups unhurriedly,
While blithe birds warbled melodies
Such as they sang in Arcady.
Amid the flames of languid blooms
Whose vivid fragrance dazzled one
Soft gauzy things fed on the fumes,
While spiders watched from webs new
spun.
There fair young mothers tended flowers,
And dreamed of glad, ungarnered years,
And with their babes passed hallowed hours
Too honey-sweet for sighs and tears!
If you had seen all that I saw.
Fair Cynic, you’d rejoice with me,
And understand God’s deathless law—
Love rules the world triumphantly !

A PROPOSAL TO REWARD MERIT
WITH CHAINS.
Now that Australia’s Prime Minister is
flooding London with torrents of patriotic
speech, and the editors of British news-
papers are leaping from their chairs to yell
“Hallelujah!” to his Imperialistic chorus,
it might be well, not to ask w r hat it is all
about, for that would be almost impious, but
to look at the things which are being
attached to the whirling periods of the little
man’s heroic rhodomontade. Chief among
these is the statement that a Constitution
must be framed at the close of the war which
will “hold the Empire closely together, giv-
ing the Dominions a definite voice in its
affairs.” Although W. M. Hughes has
denied making any remark about the
organisation of the Empire except to some-
body on one newspaper and a man who came
to interview him from another, it is just this
talk of “holding together” and giving a
“definite voice” and the like that, when
uttered by prominent Englishmen associated
with him on platforms, sets British patriots
rocking on their chairs, and causes the press
to explode in great bursts of inky admira-
tion for the man whose presence calls forth
such soul-uplifting sentiment. If Hughes
doesn’t actually say all that is attributed to
him in the reports of his speeches, he at
least sits still and endorses it with his
smile. But •what exactly does the Empire-
binding talk mean? Somewhere about 18S0
the defeated minority which represented
Tory thought in Britain invented the catch-
word of Imperial Federation as a set-off to
the policy of more progressive statesmen who
saw the strength of the British ideal to lie in
the granting of the widest possible liberties
to autonomous States, while sitting back and
allowing the bond of sympathy and senti-
ment between them to mellow and strengthen.
To the Tory mind there were immense dan-
gers in leaving free States to govern them-
selves. A new nation might easily break
away from its aged parent and even become
hostile and turn and rend her. What the
Tory wanted was a closer organisation which
would make the remotest part of the so-called
Empire an integral part of Britain —in fact,
under a mass of new and high-sounding
phrases, he wanted to reduce the self-govern-
ing British countries once more to something
like the Crown colonies from which they had
evolved. But Imperial Federation never
became more than a yell. Nobody really
wanted it. The new States and Dominions
overseas had the cocked hat of a Governor
here and there to remind them of the way
some of their ancestors used to dress, and
were content to move along their own paths,
doing their nation-building according to
their own notions, and casting a
kindly thought occasionally across the
ocean to the useful parent who, out
of. a large purse, bought most of the
things they raised from the soil. The
people of England had plenty of problems of
their own without tackling those that had
grown up. on the outside rim of the planet,
about which they knew nothing and cared
less. The people of the Dominions had
their special job to do, and had no sort of
desire to interfere in the domestib affairs of
an ancient, over-populated island at a remote
distance. So Imperial Federation began as
a yell and stayed on as a vague and unreal
murmur.
* * * *
Now, while W. M. Hughes shouts in a
frenzy of patriotic zeal about Anzac, the will
of the people, Labor ideals, German trade, the
Australian Light Horse, freight for wheat
and the coming victory of the Allies, all sorts
of people are pinning placards bearing the
decayed Tory cry on various parts of his
garments. The Dominions must be bound
closer to Britain! Why ? Because in the
extreme test of the greatest and most terrible
war of history the old loose union of senti-
ment and sympathy failed? No! This can-
not be. the reason because, on Hughes’s own
rhetorical showing, Australians and the
people of the other Dominions rose as one
shout when the test of battle arrived. They
could not possibly have done more whatever
the political relationship with Britain had
been; and the odds are that if there had
been any sort of pressure brought to bear
upon them, they would have done much less.
For the purposes of war, therefore, the
existing system of loose ends and warm
sentiment has worked perfectly; and any
closer association must be for some mysteri-
ous purpose connected with the coming time
of peace which has not yet been disclosed.
No statesman would be mad enough to run
the risk of changing an arrangement which
has so admirably stood the supreme test
except for some very grave consideration.
* * # *
This Commonwealth has already framed
something in the way of a big national pro-
gramme, based on certain ideals which are
held by every Australian who is worth his
bread and beef to his native land. The
same is true of Canada, of Maoriland, of
South Africa and even of little Newfound-
land ; not to speak of Ireland, with its joy
of coming emancipation fresh on its ver-
dant sod. These ideals and aspirations
of the units of the so-called Empire often
involve international questions, and are not
merely matters of local government. White
Australia, as a policy, involves other peoples
and touches world-wide interests; in New-
foundland the question of bait for the
fisheries is equally far-reaching and of acute
interest to at least one European nation.
In proposing that the bonds of Empire
should be drawn closer, is it to be under-
stood that all ideals held by the units of
that Empire are to be upheld by all the
rest, and that, come what will, Australia,
Ireland and South Africa will stand or fall
by the view the people of Newfoundland take
of bait to catch the elusive cod? Further,
as it is clear that the ideals of young
nations are in process of evolution, and
must continue to grow, ,is it to be taken for
gi anted that the future views of things held
by Australia, Maoriland and Canada must
forever be upheld, even to the death, by
South Africa and Britain? Such an
Imperial union is difficult enough to imagine;
but when it is remembered that in great
proposed partnership are included also qoun-
tries like India, Fiji, Jamaica and Egypt,
reason begins to reel at the thought of a
political machine which would attempt to
harmonise and make workable the external
and internal interests of the lot. Yet when
a statesman talks about “holding the Empire
together and giving the Dominions a definite
voice in its affairs,” he either means a con-
trolling Government affecting every Domin-
ion question of greater magnitude than the
working of the. parish pump, or he is merely
breathing hot and noisy air. As it is
inconceivable that such a Government could
adjust the affairs of all its federated States
without compromises which would lower or
obscure national ideals, it is clear that the
Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has
no right to countenance even by a boisterous
smile a proposal which would mean moral
loss and bitter disappointment to the people
of Australia.

When in common with other British
nations we entered the present war, we did
so in the belief that our blow was to be
struck in the interests of small nations
trampled upon by big ones. Our wallop, if
ill-directed, was a hearty one; and good
•Australians poured out their blood freely
in the cause, while even very middling Aus-
tralians produced some cash to help the more
ardent patriots along. Viewing matters in
the. light of British oratory, Prime Minis-
terial smiles and London press comment, it
looks very much as if Australia, the small
nation fighting for the rights of other small
nations in Europe, is to be asked to sur-
render her own grip on those things which
give her nationality force and meaning. Any
organisation of the Empire, such as that now
suggested, must be more or less on a repre-
sentative. basis; and on at least one ques-
tion, which is absolutely vital to every Aus-
tralian, we stand to be outnumbered by
others who, for a thousand obvious reasons,
must be quite unable to understand our
feelings or get our point of view. To carrv
out any binding together which involved
such calamities as this would be fraught
with far more danger to the essential unity
of the English world than to leave things
as they are; with far more danger than
even to let the existing political ties slack
off further until the knots are as loose as
those on a suburban verandah blind.
* * * *
The plain fact is that, however much the
name “Empire” may be in evidence through
the influence of Kipping and other writers,
the British concern which spreads itself
over seven seas is not an empire in any real
sense, but a far bigger and worthier thing.
It is a confederation of nations, not bound
or fettered together, but one in splendid
unity through a sympathy which is far
stronger than any chain the loudest-talking
politician can forge. The proof of that
unity is found in the share we are taking
in the war —a war for the most part of free
nations against empires that are bound and
fettered together. While England remains
the first word in the language to the English-
man and Australia the first word to the
Australian, there is a very decent chance
that our essential unity will continue; but
once a serious attempt is made to load us
up with political ironmongery of however
ornamental a kind, the weight of the stuff
will cause chafing and irritation.
ONE MAN ONE VOTE AND SYDNEY’S
GARBAGE TIN.
In view of the Australian passion for pawn-
ing the family frying-pan and going on a
burst with the proceeds, The Bulletin eyes
with suspicion every suggestion for convert-
ing the baby’s perambulator into an article
pledgable by the man next door. Wherefore
this paper has only tempered enthusiasm for
that clause in the N. S. Wales Local Govern-
ment Bill which proposes to give every elec-
tor a vote on municipal and shire loan
proposals; for if municipal politics are going
to be further degraded by the frantic loan-
mongering and gross extravagances which
have become outstanding features of State
politics, settling day will be a time of wild
excitement. The best justification for the
clause is that Local Government in N. S.
Wales, and particularly in Sydney, has been
carried on without either imagination or
competence; that it has just muddled along
in an atmosphere of many odors to the great
discomfort and prejudice of the citizens; and
that a widening of the franchise and equalisa-
tion of voting values may give it life and
force and character. The worst that can be
said against the proposal is that the loan
and rating authority granted to citizens with-
out property may be abused. Probably it
will, for a time. The Bulletin expects to
see it abused. But as it has seen Propputy
abuse its privileges and neglect its obliga-
tions, the point at issue narrows down to the
simple problem whether Propputy can be
allowed to go fumbling on according to imme-
morial habit, or whether civic affairs shall
be controlled by the general body of citizens,
taking a risk of the latter being liable to
periodical fits of lunacy, but counting on
common-sense coming to the rescue. The
claim that Propputy has a monopoly of com-
mon-sense is fatuous. In national and local
affairs Propputy has always and everywhere
been a shirker. Otherwise it would not have
lost so much of its grip or have reason to be
squealing that it is threatened with the loss
of more. Neither would it abandon hope.

Some of the horrors that are to be antici-
pated from an extension of the municipal
franchise in Sydnev. and from clauses in the
Bill authorising municipalities to engage in
trading operations, have been pictured vividly
by the newspapers. One pf them howls in
dismay about the losses that will have
to be faced on account of the aldermen
setting up in business as purveyors of milk
and retailers of crayfish, and it pictures the
terrible possibility of the Lord Mayor order-
ing someone into a citizen’s yard to orna-
ment it with a tar pavement. This agitated
waving of a demoralised gamp is utterly
useless, even if it were serious. What the
Bill does is to give municipalities authority
to enter upon certain trading undertakings,
and among them are these: —
The manufacture of gas and electricity, the genera-
tion of hydraulic power, the establishment of a ferry-
service, the conveyance of passengers by motor-’bus,
the transport of merchandise, the sale of milk, stone
and sand, the manufacture of bricks and pipes, and
the sale of fuel, meat, fruit, dairy produce, forage,
provisions, clothing, building material, biscuits and
pastry, fish and oysters.
Other expected horrors have been set forth
by traders who have passed resolutions of
alarm that they are to be deprived of their
livelihood through municipal copipetition and
compelled to pay taxes to mdke good the
losses contracted by mismanaged public
undertakings. There is, however, nothing
extraordinary in the list of enterprises which
municipalities are to be allowed to embark
upon. Most of them are somewhere or other
in full operation under municipal control,
and the rest ought to be. All over the world
municipalities are seeking wider powers in
this direction, and experience is proving the
expediency of granting them. In many places
it is only through municipal intervention
that a decent milk supply has been secured.
In others such a thing cannot be hoped for
except through the same agency. Only an
irreconcilable stick-in-the-mud could object to
the principle of municipal depots for certain
foods. . Screams of anguish from traders do
not affect the need for them. The trouble
with the average shopkeeper is that he can-
not purge himself of the notion that in addi-
tion to owning his shop and his goods lie
has a first mortgage on the public, with an
indefeasible title to profit from the necessities
of his neighbor.
If the Sydney municipality has -an un-
restricted franchise, some people are whim-
peiing that it must inevitably make a dismal
mess of whatever it touches and then impose
heavy burdens on property to replenish the
leaking caslibox. Were they to take an
active personal interest in civic affairs and
help to prevent these disasters, thev would be
discharging a useful function. The only
reason why hash has been made of local
government undertakings thus far is that the
privileged people have selected as their re-
pi esentatives only those men who are incom-
petent or worse. In many ways the local gov-
ernment of Australiancities has been less effici-
ent and enterprising than that of nnv «

The Coming Demand for the Non-
striking Nigger.
In a general sort of way it may be said that
anybody in Australia who downs tool
and goes on strike north of the twenty-eighth
parallel is practically inflating his luna,
yelling at the top of hi s vLe LTbC
' abo !'- « J . K ' , st !' lke ' as » weapon in 2
hands of the toiler, may have its uses and
there probably are occasions on which it ran
be legitimately employed ; but in fully 87
out of 88 it is the wrong tool for the work
and as dangerous to those who handle it
and to the community at large as a loaded
two-edged, poisoned dagger with a lively
death-adder twined round the hilt The
White Australia policy, which five or six
years ago seemed to have dug itself in for
all time on a height of moral and national
sentiment, has begun to quiver. At least
one prominent newspaper, which stood firmiv
on the principle of Australia’s jobs for the
white man, has gone over to the enemy and
now pleads with tears in its ink for nigger
and still more nigger to develop the Northern
Territory. The situation in Queensland was
the real strength of the whole argument for
White Australia. Queensland had given
discolored labor an exhaustive trial and
thrown it aside on the ground that white
labor was cheaper. In tropical Australia
the white man proved that he could work so
much better than brown brother that,
although his wages were high and those of the
cocoa-tinted person small, his employer came
out a lot to the good. But —and the but at
this moment looms gigantic—the white man
is only cheaper while he goes on with his
work. By constantly downing his tools on
the smallest provocation, or none at all, he
is becoming too expensive a luxury for even
tropic wealth to support. Hence there is
a renewed cry—faint at present, but rapidly
gaining in volume —for colored labor. The
white man is failing to come up to expecta-
tions, not because he has become an inferior
workman, but because the strike and the
slow-up habit is making him uncertain.
Further, the cry for brown aid is no longer
centred on a desire to bring back the Kanaka.
The new demand will be for workers from
Asia, whose presence in Australia would be
not merely a menace to national ideals, bat
would forever make the mention of the White
Australia policy an occasion for wild laugh-
ter. The unionist may well give the matter
a little serious thinking, and consider whether
it might not be better to stick to his job, use
the legitimate means at his hand to improve
his position, and refrain from further
attempts to cut his own throat with a tar-
brush. A tar-brush is a very sharp instru-
ment when its handle is a strike and its
business end a cry for nigger.

The Call for Patience.
When General Focii broke the alignment
of the Hun’s western invading armies and
compelled old Yon Ivluck to get on the
reverse gear and scuttle over the Marne,
there were loud assurances that the decisive
moment had arrived and Tipperary was only
round the corner. Since then the decisive
moment has turned up about 50 times and
the last phase has been entered on a multi-
tude of occasions; yet nothing decisive or
remotely resembling it has happened any-
where, and the only difference between
yesterday and yesteryear was that yesterday
there was less muddle and more corpse, less
blatancy, and more holes taken up in the
combatants’ waist-belts. And that is about
where the disturbance stands, the thing
wdiich matters most being that the job
ahead has been brought into . better focus
and measured up for what it really is.
Germanic illusions have vanished. On the
other side delusions about the picturesque
effects that were to follow in the track ot
“steam rollers” and offensives in the spring
have evaporated. The struggle may be near
an end. It may possibly last for years.
What its duration will be no one can tell.
What looks reasonably certain is that brains
and patience will decide the matter. Hj®
German had both of these things, and is
fighting to-day with 40 years of dogged pre-
paration behind him. But it was a prepara-
tion for hacking through and winning
quickly bv sheer weight of men and metal.
That much is known. What is not known
is how long the patience of a dog will endur
when it unexpectedly finds itself tangieo
up in a prolonged fight with another anuna
and is compelled to devour its own tail a
the same time. That proposition may.bay
escaped the patient German mind. If
the German mind is in process of e P*
ment. It may respond by producing sj ;
thetic tails. If it can’t do that, it can on
win by crippling the British Fleet a
recovering a measure of maritime power
commercial purposes.

Sawbones.
Frantic attempts are being made by medi
cal men to convict N.S.W. Minister
Education Griffith of an inconsistent a
tilde towards unions of workmen ana
union of doctors. Confronted by a t
of boycott towards his scheme for sec r
medical treatment in schools, Griffit . -
in turn threatened the Medical Associ
to strike off the roll of practitioners •
member of the profession who refuses
with a State medical officer when cal j
Prior to this the Association had exp
its intention to ostracise any
took employment under Griffith s ■_
the association’s attitude being hostii


medical man treating for State pay any
child exceot “a pauper.” The argument
levelled at Griffith now is that he is an
advocate of “free labor,” yet would not dare
attack a striking union of miners or bakers
by engaging strike-breakers. The circum-
stances are not parallel, and can only be
made so by assuming the miners and bakers
to have gone upon strike to assert the prin-
ciple that the State shall not set up a coal-
yard or establish a bakery except to supply
customers who are penniless. The Medical
Association is not threatening its retali-
atory strike so that it may get an increase
of fees, but because Griffith declines to
introduce a test of pauperism into the
national, schools —an almost inconceivable
Kosition which, if conceded, would lead
ously to the further contention that
only pauper children should be received at
the schools for instruction. But if there
is nothing to be said for the attitude of the
profession, there is ground for doubt whether
the Griffith scheme is altogether without
flaw. The patient has to be considered as
well as Sawbones, and probably all would
be more fairly treated under a scheme some-
what akin to that adopted by lodges—one
which would permit of treatment being
available at the State’s expense from the
general body of medical practitioners on a
scale fixed by agreement. There would thus
be a reasonable choice with regard to the
adviser consulted, a greater degree of effici-
ency, and an equitable distribution of oppor-
tunity to participate in the nationalised
part of the profession. Griffith has a
fine ideal in view* and ought to pursue it.
But it is one that may be easily spoiled,
and this paper has an instinctive distrust
if any scheme launched on the basis of three
or four medical men and thousands of chil-
dren. Treatment on the basis of spot
diagnosis is not what a Socialist reformer
should aim at, nor are the foundations of a
building ever very satisfactory when the
architect and workmen spend most of* their
time throwing bricks at one another.

Trade—After the Ball.
Tiik Short of llans Bull -
A idt Of hot-ail is gushing froiri British and other
poiitiOiahs On the subject of cutting the German out
of the Empite after the war. The factors to be
reckoned with most are the British manufacturer and
trader; whose patriotism and intelligence may be
expressed algebraically by the minus sign.
Lest anyone should rise in haste and wrath to say
that my name is Schneider and my favorite beverage
sauer-kraut, I shall quote the British Ambassador at
Petrograd (Sir Geo. Buchanan) when addressing the
members of the British colony there about two
months ago. The diplomat with the good Scotch-
whisky name urged the necessity of at once preparing
to capture German trade in Russia. But he said: “If
we are to oust the Austro-Germans our manufacturers
and merchants must radically change their methods,
study local requirements and tastes, add abandon the
old-fashioned idea that what an Englishman likes
ought to be good enough for the foreigner.” But
will the British manufacturer and merchant get a
mental and physical wriggle on? Or will they seek
to trade on the war itself, and the sentiment that
blood is thicker than water—a peculiarity which also
applies to mud and is wholly irrelevant?
So much for sense; now for patriotism. The
Buenos Aires correspondent of the Times, telegraph-
ing about the middle of January, stated that “while
German imports may have disappeared from the
official Argentine returns, the fact remained that,
with sOthe unimportant exceptions, German firms
were still able to accept large orders, with guaran-
tees Of normal delivery;’' and were able even to
circularise British houses with Offers to supply large
quantities, at pre-war prices, of the very articles in
which these houses are their chief competitors.” The
German traders stocks were received from various
sources; by direct shipments from British firms : and
from Sweden and Holland duly fortified by consular
certificates of origin.
This enemy-trading, I suppose, is not antagonistic
to the ethics of Freetrade, literally interpreted. The
fundamental article of the gospel is to get goods
m the cheapest market and to sell them to the best
advantage of the seller. Nationalism, factory laws
and so on are merely so much impedimenta.
Invention and Defence.
The real centre of battle preparation for the
future must be the laboratory and the in-
ventor’s experimenting table. The military
person is not naturally progressive unless
there is a national whip behind him, and his
assurances in. time of peace have generally
been falsified in the actual clash of combat;
but one idea must be clear to the dullest per-
son who ever put on a uniform —that a single
transcendent invention might place tremen-
dous power in the hands of a comparatively
small people. There have been some really
gi’eat military inventions perfected within
the last 30 years or so; but in few cases
<hd a nation preserve the secret of the thing
it discovered for its exclusive use. The
wonderful French 75 gun appears to be an
exception; but the aeroplane, the torpedo,
the automatic machine-gun, the submarine,
wireless and the like have become common
property. Yet the great game of national
defence must be poorly played when the
national ideas, crystallised in invention and
construction, are not preserved as a national
secret. At the present moment Australia’s
hrst business is to aid in the defeat of the
Germans; and any marvellous thing pro-
duced by Australian brains should, of course,
be freely used for that purpose. But when
the war-cloud blows past, home defence
must become more important than the
work of expeditionary forces abroad. For
that, reason our own inventions require
\° taken seriously and made the most of.
Anything of real defence-value produced by'
Australian brains must be worth more to the
Commonwealth than to anybody else, and
should be paid for accordingly. The strength
°L su . c h inventions lies, not merely in their
enectiveness, but in the fact that they are
unknown to any possible enemy. Hitherto
they have generally been hawked from
land to land and offered to the highest
bidder, or even shown side by sicje with har-
vesters and churns at international exhibi-
tions. By encouraging research and reserv-
ing for our own use our - own discoveries,
Australia might get a long lead in military
preparation with little fuss and a very small
amount of show. Taking it as axiomatic
that most nations will continue in their
belief that boots are the first element in
war, the future for Australia should look
good if this country elevates brains to the
top place.
The Beam and the Mote in the Other
Fellow’s Eye.
Just about the moment a little man in
London was wildly demanding to know
whether John Bull was going to supply
himself with sugar from “the Empire” or
resume shipments from Hamburg, a vessel .
put into Sydney with 6000 tons of Japanese
sweetenina- grown at Formosa. About a
week before that a steamer had waddled in
with 7000 tons from Peru. A week or two
hence there will be other steamers from the
same directions —all of which is not particu-
larly convincing evidence against The
Bulletin’s theory that there was more im-
portant work for Hughes to do in Australia
than at the othpr end of the world. In the
circumstances there is something almost
grotesque about his yelp at the Britisher for
consuming a foreigner’s sugar. Hughes
knows that the country he represents at
frequent meals is doing the same thing and
always has done it. As between Britain
and Australia the greater folly is on the part
of the latter, a debby country. Britain at
least has the excuse that she is a creditor
aud a carrier and does not have to pawn her
socks to pay the bill. When the day comes
that an Australian politician can go to a
banquet in London and, instead of blithering
about what Mother should do, is able to say
what his own country does, it will be an
indication that for some years previously
Prime Ministers have been attending to their
real business. When the best that he can do
is to find fault with Mother for doing with
some justification what Australia has been
doing with no real excuse at all, the only
possible conclusion is that Australian Prime
Ministers have been engaged at blather and
shirk.

Muddle, Muddle, Muddle.
“liiMU” on the embroidery of war work :
Every now and again a wailing rises out of the
desert from some Australian who has been handed a
gross of pipes and no tobacco ; and vague tales from
the camp and plain curses from the depot suggest
that muddle continues to put a fine edge on its work.
Every week or two a commissioner is sent by the Blue
Socks Fund or some other association to inquire and
report, or to get busy before reporting and without
instituting inquiries; but the wail still rises from the
desert and the confusion appears to deepen amid the
pyramids. The impression the public has received is
that out of the various funds so willingly subscribed
by Australians, and of all the work done by enthusi-
asts in the big cause, far too large a percentage
glides away into the garbage-tin of utter waste
through incompetent or inefficient handling. The
war may or may not be at the turning point, but,
on all the evidence, it is going to last a good long
while yet; and national economy is as necessary in
those matters which may be described as the em-
broidery of the campaign as in things which pertain
to the plain, red stoush itself. What seems to be
most needed is a system which will bring the whole
of the output of good feeling and big-heartedness
under one command. It is a case where a single
truck is worth more than 27 wheelbarrows. A single
bureau of distribution might be established by the
Commonwealth; and though some of the muddle
might remain, the responsible paid heads of the con-
cern would be there to answer for their sins; and
Billjim would know the right people to hang at the
finish.

The Voluntary Workers’ Association of N. S.
Wales lias a sound understanding of the
facts. The public quickly forgets. The only
after-reward that soldiers used to get for
service for England was a general permis-
sion to beg without being prosecuted. Even
so late as the Boer War costly litigation
was necessary before returned soldiers could
get the back pay they were entitled to. The
Voluntary Workers aim at providing the
means to do justice by grabbing those means
while they are the most easily caught. Their
first desire is to provide homes for widows
and wounded; and from past experience
they know that if homes are not provided
now they are not likely to be provided at
all. Hence the Voluntary Workers’ Associa-
tion, whose membership is open to all who
will give eight hours’ service or 10s. in cash.
W. G. Layton, Deputy Town Clerk of Syd-
ney, is the hon. sec.; Wm. Brooks and
Town Clerk Nesbitt are the treasurers.
Anyone who wants to do his little bit for
those who are doing their bigger bit should
communicate with one of that trinity.

Defence Minister I’earce has just dis-
covered that people are more willing to put
money into picture shows than woollen mills-;
and he can’t get his soldiers clothed. This
means, he sententiously says, that the Gov-
ernment, in peace as well as in war, will
have to insist on having a voice as to the
way capital is employed. These place-
hunting, party politicians seem quite hope-
less. Any man of business could tell
Pearce that, all along, the Government has
had a voice in. deciding how capital should
be employed. Picture shows have paid,
because you can’t import your sixpenn’orth
of picture show —you have to buy it on the
spot. But Pearce and his Freetrade leader
Hughes (in the past “a Freetrader of the
Freetraders,” he declared the other day)
have inflicted upon Australia such a-freak
of a tariff that woollen mills have been
starved to the point of death. If Pearce
doesn’t know that let him ask somebody for
the history of the Queensland Woollen Co.,
which had to write off half its capital as
lost not so long ago. Pearce, by the way,
was in office at the time.

Seeing that Asquith, Lloyd George and
six or seven other members of the present
British Govt, are lawyers by profession, and
that some of them have replaced other law-
yers who dropped out or were pushed out,
the ruling class of politicians ought to be
truly grateful for the vigorous tongue-work
of William Hughes at this juncture. All
people and press organs in Britain were
blaming, blaspheming or politely chiding the
local lawyer-ridden Government when
learned brother Billy crossed the seas
to be greeted as a Samson, a “bombshell.” a
“crusader,” or other exponent of the pur-
poseful activity in which the old crowd of
ex-pacificists are so lacking. Thus Hughes
will be turned to account as a restorative of
public confidence in “legal acumen” in Im-
perial politics. Ilis legal diploma will be
loudly mentioned, whilst the fact that he
never was a lawyer in the popular under-
standing of the term will be carefully sup-
pressed. At the next general election in
Britain when the “No Lawyers!” cry is
heard in the land, every barrister candidate
will exhort the electors to remember Attor-
ney-General Hughes from Australia and
put their trust in brains that are devel-
oped by study of the statutes. Deakin and
George Reid will no doubt be men-
tioned also; but the most frequent apology
for the system of government by professional
sophists will be W. M. Hughes. After all.
it might have been better for Britain as well
as for ourselves if we had kept our lawyer
Prime Minister at home.
The Defence Department has at last pro-
duced an instruction to the effect that, when
good athletes and men with higherAlian-aver-
age qualifications offer for active service,
they are not to be rejected because of “teeth”
or minor disabilities. Over a year ago the
case of a champion rifle-shot rejected because
of ingrowing whiskers or something was the
standard jest, and the Department com-
menced to revolve slowly on its axis to meet
such instances. Now it has accomplished the
stupendous job and a lot of first-class
material that was previously urged to get
back to the playing fields will find a welcome
at the depot.
There is a popular fallacy that it was the
present Kaiser who discovered the German
nationality of Almighty God, and another
lesser fallacy that William 11. in
talking that way echoes the pious
self-congratulations of grandfather William
1., the blustering old hypocrite with
the mutton-chop whiskers. As a mat-
ter of fact, it was Bismarck who educated
both old William and his grandson in the
belief that Jehovah is a Hohenzollern and
a half-partner in the German Empire busi-
ness. As long ago as 1847 Bismarck said
in the Prussian Parliament: “The Prussian
sovereigns are in possesssion of a crown, not
by the grace of the people but by God’s
grace.” And in the anecdotal book —“Bis-
marck and His People”—the blood and
iron immoralist is stated to have said : “Take
away my connection with and relationship
to God, and I should pack up to-morrow and
return to sow oats at Varzin.” As Chan-
cellor of the German Empire the old chap
professed to reckon himself in close touch
with the Almighty. The present Kaiser
claims nothing that his old mentor didn’t
tell him he had inherited. As for his talk
about “Kultur,” the term was coined by
Professor Virchow 40-odd years ago, when
the clerical party was fighting the Govern-
ment on the question of the exercise of R.C.
church functions by priests who refused to
acknowledge civil authority. Virchow
called it the “Ivulturkampf,” or “Culture-
contest,” involving Germany’s “entire intel-
lectual and moral culture.” So the Kaiser
proclaimed the fact that the present war
would be a “Ivulturkampf” between Ger-
many and the natural enemies of her poli-
tical and moral culture. Which it certainly
is. But the notion that Germany has got a
Kultur inspired by God didn’t originate in
the Kaiser’s brain. He is not an author of
national “gags.” He is only the glorified
mummer who stands in the centre of the
stage and utters them.
One of the changes introduced by General
Robertson, ex-private, when he relieved
Kitchener as Chief of the General Staff,
was in regard to the method of finding offi-
cers. Robertson aims at promoting the
ranker, and has been drafting men of promise
into the instruction schools. Kitchener
clung to the older notion right up to the last.
It looks to this paper as if Australia is
swinging uncertainly between the two ideals,
and that it would be well if the Defence
Department kept more closely to the practice
of working the lift from the ground level.
Hitherto the contrivance has appeared to
start rather too frequently from the first and
second floors. The position seems to be
that by waiting long enough and getting in
at the right place, practically any passable
candidate can quant> for a commission with-
out having to go through more than a pre-
tence of the pick and shovel stage. In
practice this often means offering special
advantages to the young man who is not in
a hurry to get away, while discounting the
chances of the more eager and vigorous indi-
vidual who wants to be supplied with a gun
on the spot. If this eager and vigorous
person doesn’t apply for training for a com-
mission he, as a rule, doesn’t get it: no mat-
ter how good an officer he might make he
isn’t called out and passed into the training
school. The Bulletin knows that much
is being done in the way of training rankers
for positions of command, but far too much
is left to the chance of men applying for
training, and too little to direct selection on
merit and promise. Thus many commissions
have been granted which would certainly not
have been granted if the only passports were
efficient service in the ranks, personality and
eagerness to get away to the trouble.
“Trot” : There were eight men around it
when I arrived —six sitting down, roll-
inn' up his sleeves, the other deliberately
filling it. Then the filler sat on his heels
and lit his pipe, and the sleeve-rolling having
finished, it was wheeled off. It was a barrow
with dirt in it. The equipage was pushed
a couple of hundred yards to a hole, where
it was taken delivery of by three other men,
the contents emptied into the hole and the
touring vehicle placed on its wheels and
legs in front of its conductor. “Well, so-
long,” he remarked, and with dignified steps
pushed it back to the waiting seven and
sat down. Two of the seven upended them-
selves. One started rolling his sleeves;
another grasped a shovel, took his stand at
the dirt and lifted a bit into the waiting
limousine. Whereupon the blades were
seized again, and the wheel revolved towards
the hole where the three specialists were
waiting. That was at nine o’clock, and
they were toiling at the same job at 4 p.m.—-
10 men, one barrow, a face of dirt, and a hole
200 yards or so away. It was good, honest
toil, and each man wiped the sweat from his
brow when it was necessary. Where was
it? On the banks of where the Cotter River
runs when there is any water in it. Doing?
Why, building the National Capital of Aus-
tralia. And the job was being paid for by
a Government which is preaching economy
because it has on hand a desperate war for
the very existence of the nation.
“Quidam” : One of the outstanding lessons
of the war so far has been that it is possible
to bring up a nation on wrong ideas; and
one of the wrong ideas most prevalent is
that a Britisher is superior to anybody else
simply because he is a Britisher, and that
in consequence there is a sort of innate
treachery and dreadfulness concealed in
the fact that so many Germans are in good
positions and businesses in Australia. Hence
to a great extent arises the howl to drag
them- forth. If every Greek fish-shop win-
dow were broken, and everyone bearing a ']
German name were interned, material damage
would be done to the Commonwealth’s own
productive powers; but if every Australian
became seized with the desire to ascertain
the reason of the foreigners’ success, and to
see that in future he was qualified to win
such success himself, no damage would be

done to anyone or anything but the alien.
The war has shown us that, owing to slip-
shod methods and archaic ideas, we have
allowed the foreigner to become supreme in
many things requiring systematic knowledge.
It has shown, too, that our boasted liberty
may be made into a fetich, till it degenerates
into a license under which the commercial
magnate thinks only of enhanced profit, and
the wage-earner of nothing but an extra
bob a day. It has also shown a serious dis-
crepancy. The former creed of the ultra-
British press and politicians was that Brit-
ish rule was so superior to German rule that
no German who once escaped from the latter
would ever go back; now the same people
assert that every German, even unto the
second and third generation, would if pos-
sible bring about German rule in Australia.
Discrepancies like this should suggest that
it is urgently necessary for the nation to get
out of the habit of allowing the daily press
to do its thinking. Nothing is less likely to
lead to national improvement than a smug
belief that we can’t be matched in anything.
“Yin” : Re the awful Egyptian Flossie.
Some of our doctors tackled the problem in
a very practical way. Outside one A.M.C.
tent was a notice reminding men going on
leave that goods could be purchased “abso-
lutely proof against venereal disease.” The
supply gave out in record time. Flo is so
persistent that she comes into the cafes to
leave her cards and photos on the tables, and
when she’s at home it’s common to see her
exhibiting her nakedness in the window or
on the doorstep. There’s a terrible reckon-
ing coming from the Poison Woman of
Pharaoh’s aucient land. Still, Australia
can’t expect Minister for Defence Pearce
to attend to it while the Band of Hope keeps
him busy in Melbourne. Nor Prime Mini-
ster Hughes, who is fully occupied having
his leg pulled in the dear old Mother Land.
Nor anybody else in authority who might
bury his faugs in father Bull and hold on
until that neglectful parent removes the
pestilence in Egypt to save the sons of a
young nation that is bleeding copiously in
his defence.
News has come of one of Siiackleton’s
ships, the Aurora; she has emerged from the
ice in a damaged condition, and there is un-
certainty about the whereabouts of 10 per-
sons, including the captain, who were on
shore when she was driven to sea. Also,
there is great lack of information about what
lias happened to Shackleton. Ilis last-
known address —in 1914 —was c/o the Endur-
ance, away round the corner south of the
Horn; and, as he contemplated waiting for
another • season before setting out to walk
over to where the Aurora was going to be
but isn’t, the problem of whether he is now
where he was before or somewhere else is
about as plain as everything else. The cer-
tain thing is that there is a cry for a relief
ship, and someone will have to find the cash.
This mania which some newspapers and
societies have for inciting expeditions to go
and do something that doesn’t matter tup-
pence urgently requires jumping on. Unless
the South Polar region is put out of bounds
it may happen that the financial resources
of Britain and Australia will be exhausted
fitting out (1) ships to go and discover how cold
it is down yonder and (2) more ships to hurry
up and bring back the details. It is one-
part foolishness and waste and the other
part love of advertisement and adventure,
with a very thin slice of scientific zeal
squeezed in between.
The pending capitulation of General Frost
on the frontiers east and west is leading to
severe disturbances from Riga to the Buko-
vina, and though only the most vague
accounts of the lighting are available the
broad results appear to be that the Bear
has had fair success at the southern
extremity of his line and is at the old
address further north. Soon bigger things
will be happening thereabouts, and as
lhe pot is beginning to boil around Salonika
and the mud is drying up in Flanders a
renewal of the uproar all round seems about
due, with the German frantically struggling
to roll his encircling enemies flat. Conse-
quently the veil of mystery which has lately
been thrown about the Australian troops is
likely to be drawn away before long, and
we may hear something definite regarding
their performances in new fields. For the
present Salonika remains a riddle; the
campaign in Mesopotamia mostly a blank.
The only thing of which we have at all
definite news is the revival of German sub-
marine activity. The revised policy of the
Hun appears to be to blow up everything at
sight—which seems to suggest that the
British blockade is hurting. Of course the
new outbreak of mania will be annoying.
It will also be costly. But it won’t make it
a bit easier for Germany to get the things
it wants from outside : and if we can shut
those things out and keep the wild wolf in,
the end must be victory. But the “if” in the
case means time and patience, men and
money.

Quite apart from the heartening influence
they have, the “Britain Prepared” films,
now showing at Sydney Town Hall, are fine
examples of artistic motion-photography.
Yards of the film could be snipped off the
reels and used, inch by inch, as full-page
pictures in any illustrated paper. There
are fleeting visions of fast cruisers burying
their sharp noses in the dark North Sea,
with Rembrandt shadows in the background
and submarines cheerfully swallowing steel
cigars at their base. Jellicoe’s bulldog
xvaddles across the screen and is loudly
cheered, while his invaluable owner seems
chiefly concerned in dodging the machine.
Mine-sweepers, yoked in pairs by their nets,
steam along in company doing their marine-
housemaid duty, and the lieutenant in the
innards of a submarine glues his eye to the
base of a periscope which he swings round
with two handles. It’s interesting to see
girl munition-workers dropping the bullets
into shrapnel shells as pleasantly as they
would shake plums into puddings; but the
better end of the show is the wild one with
salt in it.
II Sydney wants to see good modern drama
(which is doubtful), by an adequate oast
(which is dubious), well produced (which, is
open to discussion), and in an intimate
theatre (which is controvertible), then the
season begun by Frederick Ward at the
Little Theatre on Saturday evening has most
of the essentials of success. On its merits
the performance of “The Second Mrs. Tan-
queray” warrants support. The company is
an all-round one, and the weaknesses in it
are either inessential or counterbalanced by
excellencies. Eily Malyon’s Mrs. Tan-
queray is a triumph of intellect over tem-
perament. This has hitherto been regarded
as a Mrs. Pat Campbell part, for which
extremely temperamental and emotional
actress it was, indeed, written. P»ut Eily
Maly on shows another, and just as credible,
Paula —a less imposing but more ladylike
1 aula, nevertheless a Paula capable of every
emotion in that tempestuous lady’s gamut.
In the “big” scenes with which the play is
studded, she is remarkably effective. Aubrey
Tanqueray was probably supplied by Pinero
solely as a foil, or a butt, for Paula. But
the genius of George Titheradge made it of
equal theatric value to that of the tempes-
tuous and somewhat trying wife. Herbert
J. Bentley plays the part well —probably as
well as Pinero wanted it played. The chief
failure is that of Frederick Ward as Cayley
Drummle. This actor has not the person-
ality that would give the character the neces-
sary weight. J. Pluinpton Wilson, as the
drunk Baronet, George Orreyd, contributes
a delightful comedy study; but the play
would probably 7 be improved were he and
Frederick Ward to change places in the
cast. The part of Hugh Ardale, the most
difficult of the male characters, since the
actor has to take his audience by storm
without any preparatory help from the
dramatist, is quite capably rendered by
George Hewlett, who has the advantage of
looking like his reputation. Esther Mitchell,
with a few gaucheries due to inexperience,
makes otherwise an ideal Ellean. Althea
Hyde, as Lady Orreyd, fails to make her
humor sufficiently unctuous, while Margaret
Gordon lacks the manner of the society
dame, Mrs. Cortel'yon. The play is worthily
produced, and the theatre looks gay in its
new decorative scheme.
** * *
Though it is not apparent that the supply
of bombs in the box-office of Sydney Cri-
terion is running out, the heroic defenders
“Under Fire” in the British trench are not
expected to hold out more than a few weeks
longer.
“You’re the One,” the revue at Sydney
Adelphi. was put into dock for an overhaul
after a couple of nights’ run, and a few
repairs and additions have improved the
show. On Friday the profesh at present in
Sydney will combine in a matinee at the
Adelphi to give the War Chest Fund a well-
deserved lift.
** * *
“So Long. Letty,” rags gaily towards its
100th performance at Her Majesty’s, Syd-
ney, and will probably prance on for another
mile or two before it’s time to pack and
go.
Sydney Tivoli has Ella Caspers back, and
the lady with the voice of gold is assisting
Peter Dawson to keep the plaid flag of
Mclntosh flying. Mildred Grover is still
being mentioned with great respect by the
advertisements, and Ula, the little dancer,
provides a graceful interlude. Wolgast and
his lady partner, the fashionable Sans
Sisters, Musette, juggler Pollard and a few
others fill out the bill.

The circus comes to town again on Satur-
day night, and . George and Philip Wirth
will lead the animals two by two into the
new ark, which is anchored near Sydney's
not-too-Central railway station. The two
descendants of Noah assure The Bulletin
that the “old man’s” show has been greatly
improved upon. For instance, he had no
performing seals that could be worked for
more than a one-night stand, nor a great
rider like May Martin Wirth. Philip Wirth
reckons the absence of a horsewoman like
May was the weakest feature in Noah’s pro-
gramme.

gives 1 1 is blessing from the screen. On the
following day another picture show will be
on the Palace stand, with movies of under-
sea life and kinemaeolors of the fighting
forces of Europe.
Coming after the more satisfactory per-
formances of “Twelfth Night,” “liamlet” and
“Othello,” .the production of “Romeo and
Juliet” late in the Shakspeare season at
Melbourne Princess’s seems rather uncalled-
for. The name-parts are not often presented
convincingly both at once, and the rest of
the play is not rich in opportunities for the
co. Only an exceptionally suitable Juliet,
who can look very young and beau-
tiful and be very gaily emotional
before marriage and distressfully emo-
tional afterwards, or a Romeo like
the late Ivyrle Bellow, who was almost tin*
ideql boy-lover, will justify a revival of the
corpse-strewn romance. Allan Wilkie and
Miss Hunter Watts are neither of them at
their best this time. The lady, of course, is
a winsome enough Juliet, unaffected and
fairly forcible in the potion scene, and less
convincing in her kittenish discussion with
Nursey. But in the horribly gloomy last
scene both she and Wilkie were weak on
Saturday night. lie was strongest in his
burst of rage on discovering that fiery Tybalt
had made a fatal puncture in Mercutio. In
rage, despair or amorous mood, however.
Wilkie was obviously not the man for the
part. lie has no youthfulness of speech. Ilis
sombre and somewhat lumpy voice has no
caresses in it. None of the characteristics
of a reckless youth suffering from girl on the
brain are displayed. And his wooing of
Juliet from below the balcony doesn’t excuse
her hasty proposal of marriage. Clara Ste-
phenson, formerly of musical comedy, is the
sort of Nurse who wouldn’t stick at suggest-
ing bigamy to her young mistress. Walter
Hunt is not a merry devil of a Mercutio,
nor is Edward Landor an impressive Friar
Lawrence. Faulkner, Cosgrove, St. John,
Champney. Belbridge. Scully and other men
are more or less effective, and Miss Harvey
and Miss Sidney figure as the respective lady
principals of the Montague and Capulet
parties. “Romeo and Juliet” is handsomely
staged, and will, perhaps, last out the season,
which ends next week.
At Melbourne Royal the bill has dropped
from “It Pays to Advertise” to “Twin Reds”
—from good, sound, farcical comedy with a
Yankee moral to mere puerility with a poster
purpose. For the first few minutes “Twin
Beds” promises to be a lesson to lately-
married couples. A harmless young matron,
of gregarious disposition, who has the habit
of gazing invitingly at all mankind, excites
the natural jealousy of a husband who wants
a monopoly of her yearning expression and
a first call upon her flirtatiousness. Jwo
other types of couples are contrasted with
the commonplace Hawkinses, and it looks as
though a reasonable exaggeration of domestic
complications might keep the comedy fairly
interesting for a couple of hours. But the
story begins to lose reasonableness even in
the first act. The next two acts are a

•n:
succession of impossible situations in a bed-
room, which is also a sitting-room for the
Hawkins pair and a liberty hall for the
occupants of contiguous flats. A gigantic
clothes-basket stands prominent in this room
of many doors, the purpose of the basket
being to conceal a greasy, inebriated Italian
tenor when he isn’t sleeping by mistake in
the bed of Mr. Hawkins or hiding in the
bed or under the bed of Mrs. Hawkins. Mean-
while the greasy tenor’s terrible wife ram-
pages at intervals into the hybrid apartment
complaining of her husband’s infidelity, and
Mr. Hawkins wanders about in pyjamas
seeking the garments which his wife has lent
to the greqsy tenor. Roars and shrieks of
excitement make “Twin Beds” very noisy,
as well as foolish, in its latter stages.
* * * *
Much impropriety and pleasure was ex-
pected from the paragraphic allegation that
.Airs. Hawkins would disrobe and go to bed
in full view of the audience. The promise
is not honestly fulfilled. The lady’s undress-
ing is the most truly farcical incident of
the entertainment, seeing that she sheds no
garments that have been in evidence, and
puts nothing on to hide the loss. Her day-
gown and her nightie are one and the same
article of covering, apparently. The prin-
cipal things that she doesn’t go to bed in
are her boots. As an undressed character
during the second half of the time, she com-
pares unfavorably with the three men, who
have all the appearance of being clad only in
pyjamas. They, at least, leave nothing
further to be desired towards supplying the
festive scene with bedroom and bathroom
atmosphere.
Myrtle Tanneliill, as the harmless young-
wife in a harmful plight, lacks sincerity of
perturbation, as a rule. Her nice ladylike-
ness is colorless and insipid, whereas the
style of Celia Ghiloni, as the tenor’s master-
ful spouse, is unduly aggressive and pun-
gent. Mildred AA r arren gets almost full
value out of a rational maid-servant char-
acter, and Bowles is a distinctly humorous
impersonation of a young husband who runs
on polite-lunatic lines. Nancye Stewart, as
Bowles’s unimportant wife, shows more
intelligence than vivacity. She might take
her feeble part less seriously. Hale Hamil-
ton, as Hawkins, is brisk, brusque or blus-
terous according to the requirements of his
job, but he lacks magnetic attractiveness.
His personality is just plump and pleasing,
rather than distinctive. As for the Italian
singer (played by an Italian stranger) who
is accountable for the whole disturbance, he
seems an impossible person clumsily carica-
tured and void of human interest.
Everybody who couldn’t get in to “Twin
Beds” in Melbourne on Saturday night
because of the discomfort of the crush went
to “The Merry Widow” at Her Majesty’s.
The AAfidow is so tuneful and light-hearted
that a packed house felt delighted with its
choice. The boxes were decorated with the
Best Dressed —the Best being in
khaki. The Ethel Cadman Merry AVidow
looked like Fan Dango, and made several
hits with several top-notes. She came into
Maxim’s in a pink velvet coat. Pink velvet
is a flapper’s dream of sartorial bliss, but
the widow added a worldly touch with
black fox fur at the collar and flare-liem. A
saucy saucer Merry Widow hat with an
absinthe-tinted top and two wicked blue-
green antennae just finished the picture for
the love-sick Danilo. Leslie Holland
Danilo did fairly, but is'' such a dis-
appointment in legs. The girls in the
house were glad when he got into

“Robbery Under Arms” is to put in a
week at Melbourne King’s before the AA'ay-
backs quit the premises. Melbourne remem-
bers it dimly as a bushrangeous melodrama
in which many revolvers are presented and
none are ever fired. After a week of Cap-
tain Starlight and his heroic misdeeds, the
Bailey management will resume control of
the King’s and deliver “A Message from
Mars,” with Gregan McMahon in his old
character of Parker.

The Melb. Tivoli programme of Follies
has changed not at all since last week, nor
is there an urgent public demand for change
in the immediate future. De Coe balances
himself on the same shaky structure of
chairs and tables as before, and warriors in
uniform are still admitted to the d.c. at half-
price, except on Saturdays.

Newcomers at Melbourne Bijou last Satur-
day were Lillian Skinner, a comely and
tuneful young songstress in pink; a
sturdy tumbler and somersault merchant,
called Decar, who is admirable in
acrobatics and painful in his striv-
ings after humor; and Victor, a ven-
triloquist, who introduces Little Gladys.
Victor’s dummy walks and talks better than
it sings; and, finally, Gladys, a slim and
solemn child, comes along with another
stuffed freak which supports the aforesaid
dummy in a discordant duet. Two ventri-
loquial performers working in company are a
novelty that “knocks” an impressionable
audience, all the same. Other turns, old
and net?, are mostly sung or danced to rag-
time measures, and this journal feels sorry
for them.
With pictures at the Royal and panto-
mime at the Tivoli the exchange of charac-
ters by Adelaide theatres is complete. “Dick
Whittington” is not equal in splendor to
the rival “Mother Goose,” but the comedians
are funnier —which is easy. Carrie Moore
is dashing and Dame Dan Thomas has the
necessary quaintness. The King’s gives
“revue” a rest, and has a jolly mixed bill.
The new Royal pictures introduce Aus-
tralia’s old friend Nance O’Neill; also
Theda Bara, who was so absolutely It as
Carmen that it is half a shock to see her in
another part. The “Stayed at Home” film
a;; Wondergraph is enlivened by some real-
war open-air effects that could not be got
into the stage version. This house, like
AVest’s and the Central (where A’arna recites
Dean Maitland’s final confession in the pul-
pit), shows the new tendency to supplement
pictures by a little of the human element.
Warm weather has come back to encourage
the closing weeks of the Dandies, who now
go in for operatic selections, and of the
Ideals, who have turned on the conjurer
Malini.
“The Old Soldier”: Court-martial evi-
dence at Paddington (Sydney) barracks is
not calculated to fill the public with respect
for the Defence Department. Recently a
man was tried and acquitted for desertion,
and this was his history:—
Enlisted September, 1914, and sent to the Front in
October. Returned to Melbourne invalided on Octo-
ber, 1915. Discharged from hospital in January.
Got a week’s leave to go home, January 31; but was
kept four days waiting for the money due to
him at the pay-office. He had to go some 300 miles
to see his people, and reported himself at Liverpool
camp February 12, only five days late.
Why could not the money owing to that
man be credited to his company commander
as it would have been in a British regiment,
and handed to him with his pass, which
ought to have been, according to British
precedent in such cases, a month’s fur-
lough? This is simply another of those very
numerous cases that prove how very neces-
sary it is that the Defence Department
should administer the various corps of which
its army consists separately, and indepen-
dently of each other. It would simplify Aus-
tralian-army management immensely. Noth-
ing is more important than to simplify Aus-
tralian-army management immensely.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The jam factory on the south side of
Princes’ Bridge (Melb.), which a while back
was converted into the Snowden picture pal-
ace, is now being changed to a theatre. It
will seat 1000 and allow them to stretch
their legs, and will be just the right size
for comedy. The local Repertory people
will have it for three months each year; at
other times it will be open for engagements.
Gregan McMahon, who has been appointed
manager, hopes to ring the curtain up at
Easter.
“Old ’Un’’: I am reminded by “Ami’s”
par. (B. 23/3/M6) that the late Ted
(or Ned) Farley owed his career to
the education he got from a musical curio-
sity named Rolfe, the pianist and conductor
of the sailors’ “free and easy” music-hall at
the Ship Inn, Sandridge, an old-time pub
recently delicensed. Rolfe was also organist
to the local Anglican church, and used to
slip his favorite boys from the choir into the
show as a treat. The performance was on
the lines of modern vaudeville. Every
Christmas they put on a pantomime, at
which a charge was made for admission.
Farley was billed as “The Sydney Lion
Comique,” and sang such things as “Why
Shouldn’t Paddy be a Gentleman?” in a
raucous baritone voice. Rolfe’s tuition
altered this and pushed Farley up. A
large number of the early Minstrel favorites
graduated from the “Ship.” Some, like
Farley, climbed higher. Tom Rainford sang
there immediately prior to joining the
Weston and Hussey Minstrels.
Passed into silence last month in Eng-
land, Wilson Pembroke, the robust tenor of
the National Opera Co. which ran a brief
season at Melbourne Royal in 1908. Pem-
broke had done a lot of work with the
Moody-Manners co., and when Australia
heard him his voice was on the hard side
and his figure was no longer romantic.
Melbourne is sending baritone Horace
Stevens to look after soldiers’ teeth at the
Front. Though the silver-haired singer is
under 40, his platform career began with
the Philharmonic in “Judas Maceabaeus” in
’9B, and he has carolled devotionally in St.
Paul’s Cathedral as chief soloist ever since
Gladstone Wright died at the end of ’97.
“Ho” : While rehearsing one of his hair-
raising balancing feats at Ballarat the other
day Archie Falls, of Ross and Falls, the
“Mother Goose” panto acrobats, reached the
stage so suddenly that he broke two ribs.
It looked as though the turn, which is one
of the features of the show, would have to
lapse; but Mrs. Falls, who is not here on
business, got into hubby’s clothes, imitated
his make-up and went right through the
turn.
“J.F.H.,” from London :
“Mrs. Pretty and the Premier,” by Arthur H.
Adams, had a first-rate send-off at His Majesty’s, and
has every prospect of a successful run. William
Archer, of the Star, opens his notice with the remark
that “Australia has every reason to be gratified by
the reception accorded to the first play of Australian
authorship and scene produced at a leading London
theatre.” This foremost critic credits Adams with
“scenic invention, a deft touch in dialogue, and
genuine, unforced humor.” The Daily Chronicle
calls it an “ideal war-time play, a delightfully frivolous
young comedy.” The Daily Telegraph sums it up
as a “breezy business, productive of plenty of laughter
and applause.” And Walkley of the Times discusses
it in good-humored, chatty style: “Australian public
opinion is so very squeamish, and (hang it all!) you
must have a political crisis over something. So
why not over a veiled lady and a cat ?”
A series of recitals has been arranged by
William Laver, Australian professor of
mostly-German music at the University Con-
servatorium. Three piano programmes, to
be presented by Edward Goll in the Melba
Hall, are to deal respectively with the fugues
of Bach, the sonatas of Beethoven and the
musical products of Brahms; and Goll is
also to give three Chamber-music concerts
between whiles —altogether a good, bold
start for the new German year at the music-
school.
“S.S.”: Quaint the trivialities to which
men will devote their gifts even in the riot
of a tumbling world ! I have just met a
Tommy, back from the Front with a Per-
forated spleen, who discovered his true voca-
tion in the long intervals between scraps al
Anzac. It seems that Providence blessed
him with a peculiar talent for the manipula-
tion of cigarette smoke, and his intention
is to display it on the music-hall stage as
soon as his punctured organ is half-soled
and heeled. He can blow smoke rings in
rapid succession, he can blow your initials
in recognisable script, he can blow primitive
flowers, he can produce a very passable out-
line of an infuriated cat out of one mouthful
of smoke. In addition to all this he has an
extensive repertoire of chains, spirals,
arabesques, etc., and as a public enter-
tainer should be a great success in a com-
munity where two-thirds of the young men
flatter themselves on the ability to blow a
single ring.
“J.F.H.” (from London) : The Drury Lane
panto., “Puss in Boots,” in which Florence
Smithson warbles and scores triumphantly,
is being played afternoon and evening to
thronged houses, and is expected to hold good
until close on Easter. It needed capacity
houses to pay much of a dividend, seeing that
the preliminary outlay was £25,000 and the
weekly expenses exceed £4OOO. The princi-
pals divide a thousand, and there are 500
supers and subordinates drawing an average
of 30s. a week.
(Continued on page 3Jp)
The one-sided cables didn’t give much
attention last week to the way the Germans
wiped out the reverse at Verdun. With a
single torpedo they achieved a glorious vic-
tory over the entire lightship at Harwich.
Lieut. Bill Denny left Adelaide for the
Front last week. He is the lawyer who was
Attorney-General in the Yerran Ministry,
but was omitted from the present Vaughan
Government. Joining the ranks as a private,
he quickly worked up to N.C.O. and then
to a commission. His farewell message whs
one more hint to the Vaughans, his nominal
leaders, that they might do a lot of good
by getting into khaki themselves. Another
departing kangaroo is IT. S. Hudd, who was
Liberal member for Torrens till he was
dropped at the last general election.
It isn’t safe these times to mention that
there’s money lying around loose. Last
week The Bulletin drew attention to the
unclaimed balances in the banks, and in pro-
cess of gradual absorption through the
charge of ss. a half-year made for keeping
an account open ; and it was suggested that
the Commonwealth should lift the money for
war purposes. But before Treasurer Higgs
could wriggle Ilolman jumped at the sugges-
tion and announced that he was going to take
the money available in N. S. Wales and invest
it in war stock. S. Australia led the way
in the matter of these balances nearly 20
years ago, and Vic. also has a law on the
subject. But apparently the other States
haven’t; so unless the Commonwealth moves
four more sets of legislation, passed by eight
Houses of Parliament, will be necessary to
finish the job. And then it will most likely
be a patchwork.
The prize for the most original contribu-
tion to the Speck’s early-closing controversy
goes to a sport trading under the historical
name of W. H. Lecky. He wants six o’clock
closing as a means of boosting the birth-rate:
What the publicans lose after tea if early closing-
comes in will be gained largely by proprietors of
picture-shows, doctors and midwives.
As the six o’clockers won by an overwhelm-
ing majority, the little Tasmanian will pre-
sently no doubt be like the sand on the sea
shore for numbers.
Probably there isn’t a man living who has
brought more vessels through Torres Straits
than Captain McArthur, a Goulburn native
who died very suddenly in Sydney the other
day. As a youngster he sailed in the Circe,
Black Diamond, Lady Franklin and John
Wesley, as well as the well-known woolship
Gladstone; and in his long career with the
E. and A. he had commanded the Menmuir,
Tannadice, Guthrie, Australian, Empire,
Aldenham and St. Albans. He never had one
single serious mishap all his seafaring days,
and never made anything but friends.
That restless individual, ex-constable
Crowe, has at last got himself to a place
where everything is quiet and well-ordered,
and the dull monotony of life is broken only
by the occasional visits of the Inspector-
General. If he deserved gaol at all he cer-
tainly earned all his three years for about
the hottest parcel of libels on Macmanamny
that a man could perpetrate, .including
charges of murder, robbery, procuration
blackmail and the Lord knows what else’.
But it seems certain that Crowe’s obsession
has developed into mania, and the question is
whether he doesn’t want a doctor rather than
a warder.
SCIENCE TRIUMPHS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now to the opera matinees
In happy confidence I go,
And in the stalls I spend my days
In calm enjoyment of the show,
Though women’s hats with plumes and bows
Arise before in Alpine rows.
There was a time when all in vain
The ballet girls I sought to see,
And I was driven forth again
By stacks of floral millinery ;
For I am short, and hate the cats
Who hide fair legs with hideous hats.
But nothing passes me to-day:
I see the wriggle of each heel;
The merry calves’ symmetric play
The highest tile cannot conceal.
The whole stage vision in I rope
With my cute little periscope.

“Dumper”: “Ironworker’s” case (B.
23/3/T6) may be the “unholy limit,” but
what about this? My brother was employed
by the Defence Department. He wished to
volunteer, but was told not to, because he
was an expert stenographer and could not be
spared at the time. Later on he, with
others, was given the hint to don khaki. He
took the afternoon off and spent hours at the
recruiting office (it occurred at a rush
time). Next morning he reported to the
Red Tape boss that he was accepted for ser-
vice and would go into camp the following
week. He drew his pay at the week-end, and
the Department—the Defence Department—
carefully docked him the half-day he spent in
enlisting !
“S.S.”: I lingered in Swanston-street the
other evening to hear out a fierce argument
between a lad and his donah of the tobacco-
factory type. The lad had the last word.
The girl had poured the vials of her wrath
over him. He stepped back. “Garn!” he
said. “Fer gorsake get a move on —ycr

On present appearances Australia and
Bolivia may soon be locked in a terrific
death-grapple. Sometime in last Novem-
ber H. J. Nilen. an Australian, took a hand
in trying to recover a wolfram mining claim
in Bolivia which had been jumped by a citi-
zen of that land named Frieke. The Aus-
tralian was shot dead in. the argument which
ensued. The British Consul made the usual
representations to the Bolivian Government;
but up to the present the latter has only
answered “Yah ! Beat the Germans !” or
words to that effect. Under the circum-
stances it looks as if Australia ought to send
a warship across the Pacific to uphold the
dignity of the Commonwealth ; but as Bolivia
hasn’t any coastline such an enterprise
would be mere waste of coal. Unless the
new aviation school can solve the problem
the inland republic of the Andes may pre-
serve its insolent attitude in perpetuity, and
thereby establish a precedent that wander-
ing Australians may be shot at sight if they
get out of range of the sea.

The world is a very small pill. Corporals
W. E. F. Daley and G. Duncan, of Bendigo,
waded ashore together at Gallipoli on April
25, 1915. Daley got a sprinkling of shrapnel
and Duncan helped to carry him to the
beach. Then Duncan ran back to pump more
lead at the Turks and saw no more of Daley
till he found himself sitting beside him in a
motor that was taking both to a welcome
home in the Bendigo Town Hall last week.

The Defence people have issued an invi-
tation to creditors “whose claims have not
been met for what may seem to them an
unduly long time” to communicate with the
Department. They should have stopped at
that; instead, they went on to suggest that
the delays are due to the claims being
lodged in an irregular way. The real
trouble is the discovery that payments have
been made in an irregular way. The scan-
dal probably reached its limit the other day
when, an “irregular” payment having been
discovered, the person who should have
drawn the money on behalf of an absent
soldier was asked to sign an indemnity
which amounted to a confession that he had
received the money previously. If people
with long-due claims are asked to sign
“indemnities” they had therefore better read
them carefully. Meantime a thorough over-
haul of the Pay branch of the Department
by some business organiser is urgent.

“Fish” : Perhaps there are too many holi-

things were different in his time —well, don’t
be rude, but change the subject. According
to the V.D.L. Almanac for 1828 the follow-
ing were the bank holidays “appointed to
be observed in Tasmania in this year of
grace”: Jan. 1. New Year’s Day; Jan. 29,
King George IY.’s Accession Day; March 1,
St. David’s Day; March 17, St. Patrick’s

Mayor Isaacs, of Adelaide, has done a
graceful act in persuading that city to at
any rate seem a little excited over the peri-
odical home-coming of wounded soldiers. The
common-sense community has rather got into
a way of priding itself on never getting
excited. You never hear of a riot in
Adelaide, for instance. It is a good quality,
but has its defects, and the invalids felt a
little hurt by the silence of the crowds that
welcomed them. So now each batch is
paraded through the chief streets, in readily-
lent motor-cars, and the Mayor announces
the route in advance, and asks that it shall
be decorated with flags, and that all
employers shall let their people come outside
to cheer. Also he has the Town Hall bells
rung to announce the arrival; and all there
is left for the onlookers to do is to try to
make a noise like a really enthusiastic
crowd.

“Tibia”: We’re still breeding the kind
that did the things at Sari Bair. A young-
ster of about 10 was brought in to the
surgery. He had fallen through a window
and had gashed his leg severely. Six stitches
were necessary to close the gaping wound.
Young Billjim took it without flinching. It
was such a plucky performance that I told
him he was a brave little fellow. The
young stoic was quite unconcerned about
that. What he said was: “You got any
cigarette cards. Mister?”

Now, what is the Police Department doing
about the information which the missioner
has, of course, handed in?

“Elburg”: One result of the nme-to-nine
pub legislation in Perth has been the serving
of joy-juice in teapots in a more or less
swagger Graeco-Roman or Catch-as-catch-can
restaurant. For some weeks all went merry
as a marriage swill; then a Sunday journal
blew the froth off the pot. Police in plain
clothes, and with their feet disguised, were
among the paying guests on a recent Satur-
day night. When they revealed their iden-
tity by peering earnestly into the tea-
pots and taking other deep measures
to prove that the liquid was not
made in Ceylon, the many dear young
things who should not have been there had
visions of cells and sermons. But the only
arrests made were of pyramids of bottled
English beer and some hundreds of dozens
of German lager. Demetrius subsequently
appeared before the P.M., who declined to
believe (1) that Demetrius didn’t know he
was fracturing the law; (2) that the liquor
was only kept to slake the thirst of the
washerlady; (3) that the beer had crept in
through the keyhole when he wasn’t looking.
Demetrius is £3O poorer, besides suffering the
confiscation of the wet.

A big and hot discussion is proceeding in
Adelaide over a Criminal Court case. The
public had read with some amusement the
evidence of the prosecutrix on a charge of rape
—that after a tramcar flirtation she strolled
down with accused, an ex-bank-clerk of 28,
to the Botanic Park, a ouiet spot, but with
houses quite near; that her protest against
his attack was, “Don’t be silly, think
what you are doing” ; that they walked home
together, stopping on the way to buy fruit,
and parted with an appointment to meet
again ; and that she made no complaint till
next day. Then a sentence of four years’
hard labor made the public sit up and rub its
eyes. The daily papers jumped in with
leading articles demanding reconsideration
and a correspondence has boomed ever since!
The apparently savage sentence, it is ex-
plained, is the least allowed for rape; to
which the dbvious reply is that in that case
the verdict itself was wrong. Lawyers point
out that accused swore obstinately that
nothing at all beyond a brisk flirtation ever
occurred; so facts alone were argued, and
the question of Consent was not raised. But
on a rape charge that question ought to be
raised, even if the Judge has to do it —grim
THE CAT AND THE HOGUE.
THE NICE ONE : “Yes, we were to have been
married at Easter, but Bertie went away
to the tear.”
THE OTHER ONE : “I see —cold feet!"
old Boucaut would assuredly have done it. Tlie
immediate outcome is a widely-signed petition
to the Governor for pardon —the clumsy
machinery which the absence of a local Court
of Criminal Appeal makes necessary. The
foreman of the jury has publicly expressed
his willingness to sign the petition.
TO HIS LADY ON HOLIDAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The morning is sweet, and the singing
Of birds that are fleet in the blue,
Or up in the branches are swinging, is stinging
My heart to new sorrow for you.
What use are the birds and the breeze and the trees?
There’s nothing can please when I miss you, Elise !
So here, with fine fervor poetic,
I long for you, ache for you, call.
Without you life’s but an emetic, prophetic
Of Death’s draught that comes to us all.
But I don’t want Death’s cup and his fingers that
freeze,
While still I can snuggle to kiss you, Elise.
Come back from your holiday, bad one !
Return, or I’ll pull down the flat!
With you in my arms life’s a glad one, a mad one,
Despite your distempers, sly cat.
So why should you tarry tormenting, you tease?
Be quick! or, by James, I’ll get married, Elise!
I love you, coy witch, and you know it.
My blood is enriched by your kiss.
You say that you love your crook poet. Well, show
it!
Come back, and restore me to bliss.
There’s a flapper next door who is meek at my
knees—
Sqys I’m “so sweet with women,” you dawdling Elise!
When our star after midnight shines cleares„
I sigh for the nights I have known.
Does the star after midnight that’s nearest, my
dearest,
Not tell you I'm restless, alone?
They miss you, they miss you, the birds and the
trees !. ...
Have you never a thought for the widowed, Elise ?

GROWS NEW HAIR IN TWO WEEKS.
MONEY BACK IF IT FAILS.
Most men take baldness as something in-
evitable, as though it were a kind of income
tax or water rate —though why, it passes
understanding. There is no more reason
why hair should cease to grow on the top
of the head than on the sides of the face—
and most men have to shave to the end of
their days, or wear a heard. If you are
finding the hair growing grey or getting thin
in patches, buy a bottle _of Lavona Ilair
Tonic and use it according to directions.
As a business man you know the value and
the meaning of a guarantee. Well, the
chemist who sells you the bottle will give
you his own personal guarantee that Lavona
llair Tonic will prevent your hair from
falling out, grow new hair on the bald places,
and turn the grey and faded color to its
original shade, or he will give you your
money back. Lavona Hair Tonic is put up
in attractive sprinkler stoppered bottles, re-
tailing at only 4s. per bottle. It is pre-
pared from the well-known old-fashioned
formula calling for loz. Lavona de Com-
posee, 2oz. bay rum, and i-dram menthol
crystals, which can be mixed at home or by
your chemist; but if you wish the guarantee
of satisfaction or money back, always ask
for Lavona Hair Tonic—“the kind that’s
guaranteed.”-— Advt.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant”:—
When Jack Shearston was going to school his
father had a butchery at Surry-street and Glenmore-
road. Young Shearston was junior messenger at the
Mint at the time he changed his plans and undertook
the care of the Tar ashore. He got a good grip mainly
through the 1.0.G.T., of which he was a high honor-
ary officer. At the old Temperance Hall in Pitt-
street in the early ’Bo’s Saturday-night lodge meet-
ings were held at which the “handy man” was the
main attraction. Lodges were next opened on board
the men-o’-war visiting the harbor, the stokehole
being usually the “lodge-room.” Big John Wright,
an Ulster man, training-master at Fort-street School,
was then “Grand Chief Templar.” Presently cap-
tains complained to Wright that his good-templary
was doing an injury to some of the men. The reason
was found to be that Shearston’s sailors gave their
grog-ration to their non-teetotal mates. Thereafter
the pledge was altered, and the never-touch-it Tar
did not draw his tot. Shearston was fearless
in his devotion to# his job. You could see him

at Trafalgar House. It succeeded so well that the
Loyal Naval House came into existence, and
“Johnny” was given the management as a matter of
course. If Jellicoe died he would get more space in
the papers; but the news wouldn’t sadden more
sailormen’s hearts than the word passed round last
"eek that Johnny Shearston had gone aloft.

, ‘‘Pint Pot”: Never in my wildest jim-jams
did I imagine a union secretary calling a
Chow “brother.” But I have
just seen a typewritten let-
ter, signed by the secretary
of a big trade union, men-
tioning the employment of
Chinese artisans, and com-
plaining that “these
brethren” are not being paid
at award rates. It may be
urged for the defence that
the secretary did not type
his letter himself, nor dic-
tate it to a stenographer, but
scribbled a rough draft, writ-
ing “these heathen,” which
the typist by mistake read
as “these brethren.” Any-
way, the letter was sent out
as quoted above, and the old-
time secretaries of 20 years
back are gyrating in their graves.

“309”: This is for your collection of close
shaves. At Cape Helles last May one of
the Naval Division was crossing behind our
battery at right angles to the line of fire
when a Turkish 4.2 shell passed a few feet
over our heads, knocked the passer-by for-
ward on his face and exploded in the ground
about 20 yards further on. We picked up
the crumpled heap of man, and found to our
amazement that he wasn’t ready for a
funeral. His tunic was torn and his back
rather badly bruised, but that was all. The
point of the shell had room to clear him,
but the driving band at the base had rubbed
across his back without breaking the skin.
He had been massaged by a shell!

“D.F.”: The Lemon Springs property has
just been offered for sale in Tasmania, and
a pretty story goes
with it. Mark Lemon
was the first Tas-
manian bushranger.
Lie took to the bush in
1808, when the V.D.L.
settlement was only
five years old, and he
had a run of seven
years before he came
,to his end. With a
mate named Brown he
was camped near what
thereafter was known
as Lemon Springs
when an Irish assigned
servant named Mans-
field resolved to earn
the reward for the
brace of heads, and
enlisted another con-
vict, one Plielim, for
the campaign. Mans-
field and his corporal
joined the two out-
laws, alleging that
they wanted to take
to the bush. Then
one night when Lemon
and his mate were
asleep their weapons
were abstracted and
the pair were roused
and told to surrender.
Lemon offered fight
and was shot. Mans-
field cut the head off
and compelled the
other bushranger to
carry it to Hobart, a
distance of about 50
miles, as proof that
his recent host was as
dead as any Govern-
ment could reasonably
ask.
“Fairfield”: “Leo Lear” (B. 9/3/’l6)
made a good point when he suggested that
a Minister for Names and Titles should be
appointed and that in him should be vested
for the nation the patent rights in the word
“Anzac.” The farewell-to-soldiers commit-
tee to which I belong had about 400 sou-
venirs made bearing the word “cooee,” and
we distributed them to local men enlisting.
Then the bomb exploded. An Adelaide
woman fired in a claim for 10 per cent,
royalty, alleging that she held exclusive
rights to use “cooee” on jewellery, medals,
pottery, fancy goods, name plates for houses,
etc. Our solicitors advised “Pay up,
and curse.” We did both. It was all we
could do; but I wish somebody with more
money would test the female’s rights.
A Kangaroo at the Court of rharaoli: —-
It has been raining here again to-day—three wet
days in two months, which in Egypt is a flood. But
we still don’t have enough water for a bath. If we
want a decent wash we have to go to Cairo. And
Cairo is a dreary place after a while. No one there is
ever in a hurry. They can’t even die in a hurry.
They start soon after they are born—as soon as they
have any sense—and they keep on dying all their
life. When they finish the job, it takes all day to
bury them. If the lamented is wealthy the procession
is headed by a dozen mourners mounted on donkeys.
Then he comes next, and the unmounted mourners
follow, some of them waving their handkerchiefs to
him. They all make weird noises, which the older
and more experienced inhabitants say are chants, but
CALL THE STEWARD.
HOGAN OF THE BILLABONG: “Gentlemen, I don't know whose toot’brush I’ve been usin’
this wake, but it’s just slipped down the drain, an’ I’ll buy ’im a noo one."
which might be anything from cholera to toothache.
The coffin —a deal affair—is covered with hessian and
has four legs, like a table. They always seem to
carry it home again; evidently it does the whole
family. So when little Mahmhoot dies he takes the
trip in the coffin that Moses snuggled in 12 months
ago. It can’t be said to be unhealthy, because it
really doesn’t matter if Mahmhoot does catch what
Moses died of.
The Gyp. never wastes soap or water, and would
die at the sight of inseetibane. If an ill-mannered
flea bites him harder than usual he sits down in the
middle of the footpath and makes a tour of inspec-
tion, and if he can’t find the flea that way he
undresses himself till he does find it. No one pays
any attention to him —not even to stop and ask him
if he’s had any luck. When it rains they lift up as
much of their clothes as they can spare over their
head, and it serves as an umbrella.
Most of them have only one eye left. The for-
tunate ones who have two are usually crosseyed.
This is due to their habit of always trying to take
down two people at once.
In Cairo the houses are mostly made of old stones
stuck together with mud. They are full of donkeys,
children, goats, fowls and vermin. When the mud
dries and the wind blows the walls start to fall
down. But no one minds that. If the drawing-room
wall falls and kills Imshi they bury him and go
back home again until they have to look for the
remains of little Yaller among the ruins of the
smoke-room walls. And so it goes on until the neigh-
bors get tired and don’t go to the funerals any
longer. Then the family collects what’s left of it
and its donkeys and pianos and goats and moves on
to another house.

If £3 12s. Bd. per week is adequate pay
for a man who has to juggle with £72,000 a
year, nobody need feel any sympathy for the
ex-postmaster who was recently awarded
two years’ hard labor in Sydney for em-
bezzling. The unfortunate attributed his
peck of troubles to ill-health and horseracing,
but charitably omitted mention of his pit-
tance of £lB9 per annum. It wouldn’t re-
quire many sparks of either horseracing or
illness to burn up that dole. The Judge
talked the usual easy burble about the
man’s serious offence, but hadn’t a word to
say concerning the department which first
starves a man and then puts the temptation
of a meal in his way. Generally in such
cases it is the mention of horseracing that
puts the victim’s pot on. But mostly the
so-called horseracing is a distracted man’s
foolish way of trying to make the few extra
shillings that his employer ought to be pay-
ing him. Morally it proves the man not a
bit worse than the widow who tries to add
to her insufficient mite by a flutter on the
Stock Exchange. This paper knows even a
Judge who has been guilty of that much.
This is the time for strenuous endeavor,
when every ounce of energy must be put
forth. Which was the reason why the Mel-
bourne wharf-laborers, having chosen March
16 for their annual picnic holiday, didn’t
hold any picnic, but proceeded to the
wharves prepared to work. They didn’t
work, though, because the shipowners
declined to pay the ss. per hour demanded
for “holiday pay.” So they spent the day
looking at goods waiting to be loaded, while
some of the wheels of commerce were
spragged in consequence. It was an inspir-
ing episode.
The most vindictive witness against a
burglar in Melbourne one day last week was
a man who had lost a collar-stud.
SATISFACTORY.
MOLL: “Any news from the Front?"
DOLL: "Yes, thank Heaven! Freddie is

“T.P.R.” : A patient consulted me with a
gumma (a syphilitic abscess) just beneath
the skin, near his chin. I noted that it was
broken, with a little discharge. Inquiry
elicited the remark, “07/, the barber did
that this morning with his razor!" We
must have barbers ; but Lord help this coun-
try if the syphilitic patient thinks so little
of his trouble that he holds his face up to
the common brush and the communal razor.
IN THE SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There will be a great offensive in the Spring.”
Scatters the northern cloud, and happy spring
Comes dancing up the valleys of the world.
The wreath of March has blossomed, streamlets sing,
The banners of the sun are all unfurled ;
And now men pause, while daffodils are strewing
Their garden beds, for something may be doing.
They told us in the spring the clash would come,
The great offensive, spreading fields with death ;
And, waiting that, the myriad tongues grow dumb,
And pallid nations speak with hard-held breath.
We in our purple autumn wait and wonder,
Straining our ears to catch a louder thunder.
Always the spring, the spring! And still we wait,
Dreaming of that tremendous march begun;
Yet they who spoke affixed no certain date
For the high day that sees our triumph won.
The Zeppelins float on with easy motion,
The big guns boom and Britain rules the ocean.
All as they were! And fast their spring moves on ;
Their dimpled April with her showers is near.
Last year we worried when the time was gone,
And nothing German seemed to shake With fear.
Of hope we needs must be a little thrifty—
The spring they mean may be in 1950.

Brigadier-General G. S. Richardson, who
has been given a military adviser’s job in
London, has ballooned from the ranks. He
started as a gunner in the Garrison Artillery,
and, getting through the long gunnery course,
came to Maoriland to become master-gunner.
Later he was given a commission, and when
the present defence scheme was launched he
became Inspector-General of Artillery. He
rose to be major, and went to England on
exchange to take the Staff College course.
He’d done this when the Hun commenced,
and he was able to get into Antwerp before
Winston’s adventure ended. He did well
there with the naval divisions, and after-
wards the authorities heard more about him
at the Dardanelles.
HAD A REPUTATION.
S HE: “I’ve decided to go to Adelaide for my
holidays.”
HE: “Good gracious! I didn't know you
knew anybody there.”
SHE : “I don't. That's why I'm going.”
AEneas Gunn, a son of William, till lately
of the P.M.G.’s department in Victoria, has
turned 18 and gone promptly into camp.
Young Gunn’s grandfather was the late
Peter, one of a group of five pioneer parsons
who in 1842 formed the first Presbytery of
Victoria. An uncle of 18-year-old JEneas
is that Backblocks pioneer, AEneas Gunn,
whose widow wrote “We of the Never
Never,” and thereby built a monument to
her husband’s memory.
Asquith’s doctor is T. W. Parkinson, son
of an old Canterbury (M.L.) squatter king.
The young man began his education at
Christchurch, did brilliantly at Edinburgh,
and later bought a partnership in llarley-
*treet, where he soon became famous. lie
was knighted the other day.
Harry Jackson, at one time Speaker of
S.A. Assembly, and now Commissioner of
Public Works in the Vaughan Ministry, is
seriously ill in an Adelaide hospital. There
is a complication of troubles that seem to
date back to lead-poisoning in his old
mining days. It came to an operation last
week.
“Yumbeena” : There are 28 survivors of the

Deakin, Higgins, Isaacs, Fraser, Peacock,
Quick, Trenwitli and Turner. S. Aus.: Cock-
burn, Glynn, Gordon, Howe and Symon.

Some other Australians who have sat in
the House of Commons (B. 23/3/’36) : —-
A. W. Young, one time Sheriff of Sydney, sat for
Yarmouth 1877-9; Henry Moor, solicitor, an early
Mayor of Melbourne; J. J. Dalton (a native of
Orange) ; Alexander McArthur, M.L.A. for Newtown
(N.S.W.) 1859-61, and M.L.C. 1861-3, went to Eng-
land and represented Leicester in the Commons 1874-
92 ; his son, W.A., was in 1886 elected for Buckrose,
York, by one vote over the friend and chum of the
Prince of Wales (Ed. VII.), but was unseated on
scrutiny, and got a seat for St. Austell, Cornwall;
and T. C. Anstey (Tas.), elected for Youghal (Ire-
land) 1847.
“Sequah,” an itinerant quack who made
the rounds in these parts when controversy
got him down in older lands, ended up penni-
less lately in a Johannesburg hospital. He
was a picturesque figure with Samsonian
hair, and was reputed to make great way
with many Delilahs when he visited their
towns in a gorgeous chariot from which he
invited the maimed and the halt to come and
be put right. One incident of his job was
some particularly rapid tooth-jerking, and
if occasionally he took half a jaw as well,
that was all in the day’s fooling. Originally
a London policeman, lie went to the TJ.S.A.
and converted himself into a towsled Indian
freak. Thereafter he reputedly made sev-
eral fortunes, and flung them away again.
Died last week, old Sergeant .Tack Buck-
ley, who was in a Lancer regiment in the
Crimean war in the middle of last century,
and had some big stories to tell. For some
time past he had been in a home for Invalids
in Launceston (Tas.).- When one or two
who knew Buckley heard he was gone, they
said: “The brave old sergeant will have a
big funeral now that everybody is talking
of wars and rolls of honor.” But actually
“the funeral cortbge” comprised three men
—the undertaker, the sexton, and the priest,
Father J. J. Barry. The old flag on his
coffin? No fear! “And,” said the priest
by the grave, “this is the last of a Crimean
hero!”
After wrestling with the claims of 81
applicants, ranging from 22 to 73 years of
age, and belonging to nearly all the profes-
sions under the sun, the Tasmanian Uni. has
appointed a brilliant graduate of the Chosen
Race, Montague Moses Ansell, as its new
Registrar. Monty, wffio is now 41, has
played many parts. He took his degree in
Arts and then went into the law. After
that he drifted to Melbourne and worked
on the first “Commonwealth Year Book.”
After a spell of press work and odds and
ends he got into the Ordnance branch of the
Defence Department and was still there
when the Registrar’s job became vacant.
Melba has been created by King George
a “Lady of Grace” of the order of St. John
of Jerusalem in England, but the distinction
does not entitle her to print “Lady Melba”
on her visiting-cards. This is one of the
minor orders, though a very ancient one, and
is used for recognising the services of people
who have done good work for the Red Cross
and the hospitals. Melba is enrolled in
gratitude for the thousands of pounds she
raised for the Red Cross in Australia, Can-
ada and elsewhere, and Lady Muriel Paget,
Lady Butler and Lady Phillips were yarded
at the same time. The Order was origin-
ally Roman Catholic, and its “Grand
Priory,” or headquarters, is still in the
rooms above St. John’s Gateway, Clerken-
well —all that is left of a splendid monastery
that flourished there in pre-Reformation
times. The R.C.’s continue to maintain
an Order of St. John of Jerusalem, which
they hold to be the only orthodox one,
regarding the Royal one to which Melba has
just been admitted as a usurpation. Inci-
dentally the bird has a grievance against the
careless compositor who set her up in the
Official Gazette, where she was printed
as “Helen Porter (Madame Melba).” Her
full style is Helen Porter Mitchell, but old
dad’s name was dropped out.
From a camp in England :
There’s one Australian colonel —Courtney, of Court-
ney’s Post, Gallipoli—who has got very tired of the
current English fiction that the Australian is a rowdy
drunkard. During a recent church parade the chap-
lain urged the men to abstain from the Curse, and in
the conventional parson manner exaggerated their soak-
ing powers. This was too much for Courtney: it was
bad enough to have irresponsible outsiders spreading
these tales. So he scribbled a note and passed it
up with the request that it might be read among the
“notices” at the amen end of the sermon. It was to
the effect that during the preceding month, in a
camp of 2000, only four drunks had been before the
Colonel. Then the congregation grinned behind its
hat, and Courtney is good for a unanimous cheer
from that 2000 whenever he says “Come on, boys!”
Australian Anglicans are still clinging to
the idea that the war will produce a religious
revival in this country, and to fan the
feeble flame they are planning “missions.
Local pilots will be cast for the minor parts
in the Queensland campaign, but the four
“stars” are to be imported from the Cold
Country. In the lead comes C. 11. S. Mat-
thews, who as “Brother Charles” of the well-
liked Brotherhood of the Good Shepherd
used to labor in the arid portions of the
vineyard between Dubbo and the Sunset.
A plain talker on social subjects, Matthews
made himself unpopular with “right-think-
ing” Anglican churchwardens who voted the
Liberal ticket, and eventually they raised
Cain to such an extent that he went “home.”
His crowning offence was to share a pub
balcony with a Labor candidate and join
him in exposing the fallacies of G. H. Reid’s
Anti-Sosh campaign. He has several books
to his credit, including his racy “Parson
in the Australian Bush,” and lately
has been doing his bit as a chaplain

in Flanders. Canon Peter Green, of
Manchester (Eng.), the big gun who
comes to support him, is also an inky
wayfarer, and grinds out a regular column
for" the Manchester Guardian over the
pen-name of “Artifex.” Green, who is an-
other Christian Socialist, is one of the best-
known Anglican parsons in England, and
has been made an honorary Court chaplain
to help George V. say his prayers. The
other two members of the revivalist troupe
will be “Fathers” of the Community of
the Resurrection, otherwise known as the
“Mil-field Monks,” from the name of their
monastery in Yorkshire.
Take off your hat to the memory of this
man
Died at Sydney, John S. Shearston, after a life
mainly spent in helping Jack to steer a straight
course while ashore. Born on Trafalgar Day 63 years
ago on the old Sydney “Rocks” —the district in
which he spent his whole life—Shearston began as a
clerk in the Mint, but slung his billet to have more
time for his hobby of taking care of Jack. In 1872
he started Trafalgar House, in Prinees-street, as a
home for navy men ashore, and from then onwards
“Johnny Shearston’s pub” at its various addresses
has been the safe port for which Jack
has beat up under bare poles after a
stormy passage through Sydney’s byways. In
course of time he amalgamated Trafalgar House
with a similar institution founded in memory of Com-
modore Goodenough, once in command in Australian
waters; and he ran the joint concern. In
1888 Henry Pqrkes and the Admiralty agreed to sub-
sidise an officially-recognised naval house, and Shears-
ton was the obvious man to place in charge. The
N.S.W. Government weighed out £lO,OOO and gave a
site in Grosvenor-street, and the present fine building
went up in 1890. Through good management
the place was popular from the jump, and is reckoned
the most successful of its kind in the world. Shears-
ton was made a “lay reader” by Bishop Barker in
1878, and studied for the Anglican priesthood, but
never took out his ticket. A childless man himself
he counted his “boys” afloat by tens of thousands,
and every mail brought him cataracts of letters
from them, the writers ranging from admirals to
stokers, and their addresses from Halifax to the
Falklands.

Tasmania’s Commissioner of Police,
Colonel Lord, has gone into khaki and is to
command the battalion which Tasmania,
with a hand from Victoria, is contributing
to the new army. He has long been keen
to go, but the State Government would not
let him off the chain before. This is his first
look at the real thing, though he has com-
manded the Derwent Infantry Regiment for
years past.
“309”: Colonel Quilter, the big, good-
hearted Grenadier Guardsman who used to
throw his shadow over G.-G. Denman, was
yarning with Australian artillerymen at
Gallipoli on the day he was killed, and Ms
tombstone was erected by Australians. Ser-
geant Bradwell, who is well known in Syd-
ney, and the writer cut the stone with our
pocket knives. We first of all prised out
the sill of the bread oven at “Zimmerman’s
Farm,” much to the disgust of a Frenchman
who was sleeping inside; but after all our
trouble we found it too hard to work, so
we ripped up a piece of the bedroom floor,
which was softer, and cut thereon: "In
memory of Col. T. A. C. Quilter, V.C., Bri-
gade-Major Wilson, and ,” a staff cap-
tain whose name I, the mason, forget.
Killed in Mesopotamia, a promising Aus-
tralian, Hugh G. Howes, who left Sydney
with the first expeditionary force as a ser-
geant in the 3rd Battalion and finished up
as a lieutenant with the 2nd Rajput Regi-
ment. In 1912, at the age of 17, young
Howes was in command of the 2Sth Batta-
lion of compulsory trainees who won that
year’s championship.
Gregg Macgregor, the Newcastle (N.S.W.)
parson who brought back a D.C.M. from
Gallipoli, has been given a step up by the
Church. In his curate days before the war
he harassed Satan as a mere deacon, hut
Bishop Stretch gave him his full priest’s
orders the other day at Newcastle Cathedral.
Colonel Baillie, who has occupied a seat
in Maoriland’s Leg. Council for 53 years,
fought at Chilianwalla, in the Second Sikh
War (1848-49). Another officer who sur-
vives is General de Barry, who is in Britain.
These two were in the 24th regiment. De
Barry is 91, and Baillie made merry on his
87th birthday a few days ago.
Dr. E. Angas Johnson, who inherited much
of the Angas money in S. Aus., owns prob-
ably the finest private museum in
the Commonwealth. He collects all
sorts of things of historic interest
old Australian relics, curios, documents,
books, coins, rare articles from many
parts of the world. His original letters from
past celebrities in England he would not part
with at any price. But he is no scientific
recluse : a public-spirited citizen, he keeps an
alert eye on all matters affecting the public
health, is a progressive city councillor, bono-
rary physician at the Adelaide Hospital, and
has examined thousands of recruities.
THE DREAMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On an old tune that haunts my brain
These words seem borne to me again.
I sold my youth for a dream,
And the dream has been blown to dust,
My own heart’s gold, for a tale that is told,
I have paid, as a dreamer must.
And what of this dust of roses?
And what of the grief and pain?
I have no regret. I am dreaming yet
The old dream over again.
It seems as if a rough voice said
Across that old tune in my head:
“Ho! wot are you doin’ at Anzac,
You dreamer of gaudy dreams?
Wot are you doin’ at Anzac,
’Ere where the death-shell screams?
You an’ yer dusty roses!
You with yer blighted pain!
Wot are you doin’ at Anzac?”
I’m dreaming mg dream again.
Here in the dust at Anzac,
Here, where the shells fall free,
The dreams that died in the city
Are being re born for me.
My hope died out in the city
As sunset dies on a plain,
But here in Gehenna at Anzac,
I am making myself again.
ANZAC.
A. I’ANSON.

The half-year’s margin in excess of the
dividend is so narrow as to be almost
invisible. But it is probable that something
substantial was written off before the
accounts were given to shareholders. At
any rate, full provision has been made, the
chairman says, not only for the deprecia-
tion of securities as at August 31, but for
the further depreciation which was disclosed
by a valuation made just before the share-
holders’ meeting at the end of January. No
doubt this writing down was the proper
thing to do, because the bank might con-
ceivably have to market its investments.
Still, if it doesn’t have to sell them, it
doesn’t matter a straw, so far as income is
concerned, what they are worth in the
market. But having written them down so
that they can be sold without loss, the bank
is now in a position to exchange them for
gilt-edged securities bringing in 4f p.c. or
other high-class securities bringing in up to
6 p.c. In other words, though the visible
funds of this bank may be moving up hardly
at all —may even be less than they were a
year ago—that reduction is due to the higher
value of money; so that, unless it has actu-
ally to sell at a sacrifice, the chances are
that the bank is really much better off,
especially if some of its funds are used in
ordinary trading. Here, for instance, is a
bank with £2,000,000 of share capital and
(after paying current dividend) £2,030,528
of reserves. Of these sums only £2,161,103
is invested in public stocks. The balance is
used in the business; and it is probably
earning on the average 1 p.c. more than
the bank’s funds brought in 18 months ago.
Certainly at times like this a bank needs
to make extra profit in order to put some-
thing by for the losses that usually follow
a period of disturbance and high rates. It
isn’t certain what will happen to Australia
after the war. Only one thing seems sure:
money will not be available except at very
high rates. Some banks are already pre-
pared to pay over 5 p.c. for deposits for
upwards of two years, and the Victorian
Savings Bank is paying 5 p.c. for money
fixed for 10 years. In such circumstances
the stoppage of State loans is inevitable,
and it is going to give us a bad jolt. But
the big question is, How will our staple
products behave? Will our customers of
the past be able to buy our products? If
the demand eases off, as it is likely to, prices
must suffer. It is hard, no doubt, to judge
just what is likely to happen: the disturb-
ance is so vast, we can’t see the wood for
trees. Let us therefore diminish the num-
bers. Let’s make it a row between Bruce
Smith and Archbishop Wright. They start
throwing bricks at one another in August,
1914. Usually industrious tinsmiths, they
knock off work and keep throwing bricks at
one another all through 1915, and well on
into 1916. All this time they don’t earn a
bean. They have a bit saved up; they use
this in buying tucker and beer for them-
selves and the Smith and Wright families
and in buying bricks; and when they have
used up their ready cash they start giving
lOU’s to the local money-lender, who pays
the butcher and the baker and the brick-
maker ; and when the two want bricks at
the same time the man who makes them puts
up his price, and Bricky Brown, who works
in the kiln, demands an extra 2s. a day.
Then Smith and Wright pull themselves out
from under a pyramid of broken bricks, and
meet the pawnbroker. They have earned
nothing for two years; they have not only
been living but also wasting by pawning
future wages. Well, what wrill Smith and
Wright feel like? They have emptied their
pockets, they have a heap of lOU’s to meet,
and they are not, because of their hurts,
nearly as well able to earn money as they
were before August, 1914. The plain fact
is that Smith and Wright will be in for a
cold time; and we are Wright, multiplied
by several millions.
The T7nion’s deposits were £23,684,168.
and its total liabilities £25,780.941. Capital
and reserves were (before paying the divi-
dend) £4,170,528, so the public money in
the business was about £6 3s. for every £1
belonging to the shareholders. This com-
pares exceedingly well with the figures of
British banks. Here are the latest avail-

That list shows hoW remarkably well pro-
tected depositors With this representative
Australian bank are compared with the
creditors even of English banks of the high-
est standing. Certainly these figures don’t
say the last and only word on the subject;
for obviously a great deal also depends on
tile securities into which the depositors’
money is put. But* if the ordinary securi-
ties for advances are not of quite such a
high class in Australia as in England (and
one can’t say even that without qualifica-
tions), at any rate the Australian bank
equalises things by holding a much larger
proportion liquid. In the case of the Union,
for instance, no less than 43 p.c. of all the
money owing to the public is represented
by cash, public securities or other liquid
assets.

The Standard, which does a considerable
marine-underw’riting business, ought to ask
the British navy to come and have a milk-
and-soda. True, the British navy hasn’t
done if all. Whenever the Potsdam madman
has broken out into worse Frightfulness
than usual, the underwriters have responded
by charging a bit more for war risks, and
they have managed to keep so well ahead
of losses that the cold eye of hungry
Treasurers is looking that way. Maoriland
hasn’t mentioned the appropriation of war
profits yet, but in England the drag-net is
already out, and the Commonwealth has a
bill on the stocks. Further, it may be made
retrospective. If so, this co.’s true profits
for the past year may turn out to be less
than they now seem to he.
The legislation foreshadowed in Australia
will take from the co. making the war profits
a percentage of the net earnings in excess
of the average of the three years preceding
the war. This will not be equitable in the
case of Australian and Maoriland insurance
cos., which have been steadily appealing to
the patriotism of the people of these parts
and getting a greater proportion of the
business offering. For instance, the average
premiums of this co. in the three years prior
to the war were £90,(124. whereas the pre-
miums for last year were £127.081. It is
plainly unfair that the co. should not be
entitled to make a greater profit out of
£127.081 of risks than it did out of £90,624.
Further, in the case of a small insurance co.
especially, a fair average profit cannot be
ascertained by taking only three years’
figures.
The splendid growth of this co.’s business
is shown in the next table: —

In England it is thought that an insurance
co. offers adequate protection to the policy-
holder if its funds (paid capital and reserves
combined) equal 165 p.c. of the year’s pre-
miums. The Standard’s funds are £245,225
and the year’s premiums £127,081, so the
former amount to no less than 193 p.c. of
the latter- —a position which ought to give
the policy-holders a very comfortable feeling.
Also it ought to calm some of the fears
which shareholders may reasonably have
when they remember that they are liable for
£9 ss. per share. They have paid up only
£75.000 and may be called on for another
£925,000.
The weakest point in the generally very
strong position is in connection with the
investments; no less than £116,915 is in
mortgages and £69,719 in a vague thing
called debentures. The mortgages are doubt-
less chiefly on Maoriland property; and in
the bad times which are very likely ahead
of us prices of our staples may fall heavily,
and with them will fall land values. The
co. has been earning exceptional interest for
many years on its investments, and it ought
out of those profits to have built up a for-
midable reserve for contingencies. So far
as can be seen these will have to be pro-
vided for either out of the ordinary reserves
or from current profits.

1915.. 36,892 22,986 10,277 33,263 16,517
It isn't easy to put the case in a table.
“Deficit, including goodwill” merely means
that the shareholders put up £44,000, of
which £7OOO was paid for the goodwill of
a little side-line insurance business and
£9517 has gone in etceteras. But that
doesn’t mean that the co. has paid its way
except for £9517. For four years the co.
has been issuing policies, and against the
policies still in force the office should have
accumulated considerable reserves. We
don’t know how much, and won’t know until
after the first actuarial examination at the
end of the current year.
The whole matter has to be looked at
with two different pairs of eyes—(l) the
shareholder’s, (2) the policy-holder’s. Take
the shareholder first. To bring the business
to its present position it has cost him the
£16,517 mentioned above plus whatever
amount should be to the credit of the insur-
ance fund—the reserve which must be accu-
mulated to meet policies as they mature.
Whether the business is woi’th this total
sum (£16,517 plus the amount required for
an insurance fund) The Bulletin doesn’t
know. No doubt policies which have bfeen
caught at great expense, and especially
those which have been in existence for a
couple of years, are worth money to a
proprietary insurance co.: they are the raw
material out of which it may make profits.
But yoH can’t possibly value them. For
one thing, though a proprietary insurance
co. may have the policies, it mostly depends
upon the co.’s management whether it will
eter make anything out of them. Usually
the plan is to take a small percentage of
the bonuses; and whether there are any
bonuses depends chiefly on the economy of
the management. In return for the right
to take some of the profits the shareholders
give the policy-holders certain guarantees.
There is no assurance that the whole capital
will not be thus absorbed. In the present
case a good deal of it has been absorbed.
The shares are therefore a gamble. With
good management and fair luck the prin-
cipal may all be restored and large profits
earned ; on the other hand, the co. may be
glad to crawl from the busiriess by selling
its policies to some other office and paying
shareholders a liquidation dividend of some-
thing or other in the £. or confining itself
to some other branch of the insurance busi-
ness.
The policy-holder for his part has two
things to consider: (1) “Can the office meet
my claim when it matures?” (2) “What
bonuses is it likely to pay, thus reducing
the net cost of my insurance?” In an
inquiry of that sort a young office is always
terribly handicapped. One can point to
the past record of an old office and show
that its management has more or less proved
itself. But with a new office one can only
trust; and in this life insurance one natu-
rally wants more than faith —one wants
proof. The only thing a new office can do
then is to say: “We are so confident in
ourselves that we will put up a guarantee.”
This co. has done that, to the extent of
£44,000; and shareholders have made them-
selves liable for another £27,500. This
seems to give policy-holders ample protec-
tion for the present. As to bonuses —well,
they may come by and bye. But obviously,
since bonuses ensue largely from economical
management, big distributions are practi-
cally impossible so long as a co. has to fight
hard for every policy it gets and is then
very likely to lose it within the first year
or two.
But while the shareholders have sub-
scribed a guarantee for the benefit of the
policy-holders, a large part of it is no longer
available for the benefit of the holders of
life policies. Besides the life (ordinary and
industrial) department the co. now has an
accident branch, and it has lodged the
necessary deposit to enable it to take work-
men’s compensation business in Victoria.
It also runs a provident department. The
capital is therefore no longer -wholly avail-
able -as a protection for the simple life
policies. It is doubtful w’hether an office
which takes life business should be permitted
to take any other kind of business what-
ever. But for that very reason it is pos-
sible that the co. may make a good deal
of money out of its side-lines. In other
words, these side-lines being more or less
speculative, a co. with luck may make a
punch that way.

Though the authorised capital is no less
than £10,000,000 there is not a pennv of
proprietary money in this bank; wherefore
there is no dividend to pay out. This of
course accounts for the extraordinarily rapid
growth of reserves: already the bank has
paid off the whole of the preliminary exes,
and dropped £53,171 into its own private
stocking. In the current half-year the rich
result of the previous six months should be
repeated, owing partly to earnings in con-
nection with the w 7 ar loans.
It is a moot point whether the Common-
wealth Government shouldn’t have some
capital in the business. The position at

During the past 12 months a pound or two
hasn't mattered in the shipping business.
It has been easy come, e-asy go. We have
been living partly on our own fat and partly
by discounting our future labors; and the
shipping people more than any others have
benefited by the demoralisation which always
accompanies a borrowing orgy. The year's
profits must not therefore be taken as a
trustworthy basis on which to estimate
future profits. If the actual profits were
the £21,890 disclosed, then the £lB,OOO divi-
ded for the year was on the liberal side.
It would have been much safer to put by
a larger sum than £3890 for contingencies.
The chief of these is the probability of a
severe shrinkage in the value of stocks
when the war is over. But, as a matter of
fact,* the, stocks in hand may have been
taken in at a very low valuation. There
is no way of telling whether it is so or not.
In the balance-sheet they stand at £122.545.
But it is quite possible that, before the
accounts were dressed for their annual
parade, the profit stood at. say, £26.890,
and the stocks at £127.545, and that, to be
on the safe side, £5OOO was written off
stocks to provide for accidents, which of
course would mean striking £5OOO also off
profits. These are things that you can't tell
from the surface of the published figures.
Anyway, that’s where the possible weak
point is. Look at the figures:—

Thus the entire capital is represented by
stock, which, because of high freights, high
labor and other charges, and bare markets,
has probably cost far more than it would
under normal conditions. The time may
come when, no matter what they cost, theco.
may have to realise its stocks at less even
than normal selling prices. Apart from that
possible bump in the near future, prospects
are good. While the co. has the advantage
of having no goodwill or other similar loan-
ing, it has undoubtedly a valuable connec-
tion, and things were steadily on the up-
grade even before the war sent them sky-
rocketing.

If “a chiefs amang you takin’ notes” let him
note this fact —that “Chromol” leather belting is
unequalled as a power-transmitter. It sticks to the
driving problem like a Scot sticks to caution. No
matter how stiff the drive or what the atmospheric
or industrial conditions may be it keeps the pulleys
going round without a slip, and gives maximum
results. “Chromol” belting is mineral tanned, and,
being durable and pliable, it stands every test with-
out flinching. Used exclusively by many of the

Yet there is nothing at all out of the way
about this return: it is just a moderate
vield from a concern whose risks are not
at all heavy. The next comparison shows
the latter aspect better :

The borrowed money is equal to practically
only one-half the mortgage securities; and
that means uncommon safety for the depo-
sitors. It also, of course, means that the
shareholders are not guaranteeing anybody
pise’s investment to any serious extent.
Altogether, one of the concerns which offer
investors of small means an excellent chance
of putting a bit by ; and thereby it does a
distinct public service.

Jan. ’l6, £502. Business shows no shrinkage
thus far, thanks to the borrowed money

Working expenses, which ran up quickly a
while ago when the Wages Boards got to
work, have now steadied: but nothing is
left over when the 10 p.c. bonus is paid, and
there is still some doubt whether the 2s. in
the £ rate can be kept up. It would be
utterly impossible, of course, but for the
quick turnover. Stock on Jan. 31 was valued
at £61,553; and the cash system allowed of
a turnover of more than three times that
amount, without recourse to the bank. To
give a further little help the co. was able to
collect no less than £1892 in trade discounts.

“N.” : Re the slackness in the coal trade.
“Jaques” (B. 16/3/T6) blames the extra
bob per ton charged by the colliery-proprie-
tors to make up for the increases paid to the
miners. The Maitland field, which supplies
a “fat” coal, suitable for making gas, is still
working fairly regularly. But the Newr-
castle district collieries, ■which furnish only
a steam coal, are going very intermittently ;
somewhere about half the pits are in opera-
tion, and then for something less than half
time. The inter-State markets still require
the gas coal, for which the freights were
contracted in many cases before the war;
anyhow, there is plenty of demand for it in
this and other States. For steam coal the
case is different. There are fewer steamers
running, and there is an embargo on export
to the American West Coast, as the stuff
is likely to get into the hands of commerce
raiders. In all directions freights have gone
up pounds compared with the shilling rise at
the pit. Which, then, is to blame for the
slackness—the miner who is getting a few
pence more a ton, or the shipowner who
has put up his price by pounds? The col-
liery proprietors, as a rule, are also steam-
ship owners, and as there is plenty of
demand for freight they are on velvet
whether their mines work full time, half
time or no time.

It isn’t surprising that Australian shell
steel failed to satisfy the British War
Department. For some time past the
Engineer and Dr. Stead, F.R.S., have been
saying that the specification is too stringent.
Stead, after testing German shell steel, in-
sists that the Huns are far less faddy with
regard to the proportion of phosphorus, sul-
phur and carbon. He thinks that the
niechanical test for tenacity, etc., is all that
is required. Apparently the Hun relies more
upon that, too, than upon the chemical for-
mula. Some years ago a British metallur-
gist condemned Lithgow steel because it
contained a shade more phosphorus than the
technical limit. Hoskins stuck out that the
steel would stand the mechanical test, and
it is highly probable that the Australian
ironmaster was right.

Carpathia Tin (N.S.W.) is so neglected
by the Stock Exchange that the present
market value is only £20,500. Last half-
year the directors distributed £5203, although
the real profit was less. Various faces at
the mine show high milling values, and dis-
patches of ore have been resumed. From
January 10 to February 17 1000 tons of
tailings were treated with 101 tons of ore
for 15 tons concentrates worth 63 p.c. and
35 tons inquiring secondary treatment. The
half-year closed with a credit of £1605. The
thing wants shaking up. It is no time to
leave tin in a mine when it can be rushed
out and sold for close on £2OO per ton.

The N. S. Wales Government is adver-
tising for an engineer for its colliery. He
is to take charge of the erection of all plant
in connection with the development, to pre-
pare descriptions and estimates of the
machinery required, and generally to super-
vise the surface arrangements. All this at
the beginning of the concern ; and after coal
is raised he is to act as mechanical engineer.
And the salary offered is £4OO, with £5O as
allowance! Where on earth does the Gov-
ernment expect to find a man for £4OO who
is capable of undertaking all this initiatory
work? It is necessary to secure the best
brains at the start, so that money won’t be
wasted either in raising the coal or in in-
stalling machinery of the latest and most
efficient pattern, and it is absurd to expect
it for £8 per week. A private co., with its
own money to lose, w T ould know better than
to risk it on an engineer who_can’t command
more than that.

Corinthian North (W.A.) hopes to have
a second roaster going in May and to make
the market buck up about the same time.
Recent work at the 100 ft. level is reported
to have exposed good ore for a width of
30ft. and a length of over 200 ft. The 200 ft.
level has been driven 200 ft., and a 30ft.
face is said to be ready for sloping. Most
of the shares are held by the Doolettes.

Associated Northern had an annual roll-
up in London last month and put its cards,
so far as its Westralian and Mexican ven-
tures are concerned, on the table. Iron
Duke (Kalgoorlie) w T as stated to be not yet
in need of a coffin, the weakness of the
Victorious leases at Ora Banda was briefly
alluded to and the hope expressed that the
recently-acquired Slippery Gimlet (same
neighborhood) would give the co. badly-
needed ore reserves. The disturbed state
of the country still prevents the co. doing
anything with its Mexican show, but the
Board hopes to make a mine of it some day.
Meantime neither the co. nor its representa-
tives can get within cooee of the property.
The accounts show, with £3697 brought in, a
credit balance of £13,890; but with develop-
ment, diamond drilling and depreciation
chipped off only £3607 remains.
Developments at depth in the Commodore
(W.A.) don’t show anything of importance,
so the co. is holding on to a few thousands of
accumulated profits. The mine has been
persevered with quite long enough, and the
Board should seriously consider the ques-
tion of looking round for a new mine. At
present the co. is treating the 17,000 tons of
slimes on hand, worth about 14s. 6d. per
ton.
Great Boulder (W.A.) announces: Ore
reserves, 494,564 tons; approximate gross
value, £1,510,000. A year ago the estimate
was 560,647 tons, and although during 1915
almost 200,000 tons were extracted the mill
has only gained on it to the extent of 66,000
tons. According to official returns 195,524
tons were treated last year for a return of
£584,901. Divs absorbed £262.500. The co.
is still craning its neck for a new show.

Edna May Deeps management threatens
to drag a Perth newspaper into court for
asking impertinent questions relating to the
survey of the bore which was reported to
have discovered 26ft. of ore. The paper
wanted the core produced for check assay,
and also a check survey made of the bore.
The Deeps management replied that such
demands were impudent, and the newspaper
invited it to prove them so. The public
interested in Westonia stocks are anxiously
awaiting developments. Meanwhile the man
in the street, who always knows more than
the people inside, is circulating the interest-
ing story that the portion of the core sup-
posed to contain the values has been pol-
ished as paper-weights for directors’ and
admirers’ writing-tables.
Three brokers and two laymen constitute
the Board of Leonora Gold Blocks (W.A.),
and in the prospectus the broker’s reticence
pervades everything. Seemingly one James
Cale sold to F. W. Were, who in turn
handed the show on to the Leonora Gold
Blocks Syndicate, represented by F. W.
Were, “Sandy” Oliver, Frank Savage and
lawyer Snowball. Now comes the Leonora
Gold Blocks Co., with a capital of 60,000
shares of 10s. cut up thiswise: 10,000 paids
to the vendor, 20,000 paids to the Syndicate,
and 30,000 at ss. offered to the public, 10 p.c.
of which goes to the underwriters, whoever
they may be. With vendors and promoters
taking half the shares, it doesn’t suggest
that Treasurer Higgs’s censorship of mining
floats is over-keen. The reason for the
float isn’t that £61,600 gold has been got
out of the claim down to 250 ft., or that the
reef is in tight country, but that Marvel
Loch Williams, after making a “careful and
searching investigation,” commends the
mine. He has been given control of the
show, and thus has the opportunity of prov-
ing the value of his forecasts.

L. Hansen, who used to manage Birthday
Tunnel, now reigns at Ajax North, Dayles-
ford (Vic.), and should make good by intro-
ducing the cheap-working methods of Ber-
ringa. The mine is tipped to have a year’s
divs. in ore in sight, though Hansen’s report
doesn’t show where it is. He has eight
levels to play with, but the gold seems to
make best down from No. 6 to No. 7; the
bottom is of poorer grade. Costs run at
about 20s. per ton, including ss. 3d. for
development. So any stuff over sdwt. will
bring grist to the mill. There is a little
7dwt. dirt available for the stampers in No.
8 level, but not much. Ajax North is a
freak for having hit on a shoot of stone
just where it did ; but it has put out £39,000
of gold in about two years, and paid £lO,OOO
in divs. Going north at No. 5 level Hansen
owns up to a blank lode track, but he in-
tends pushing on further in search of fresh
shoots, and if he has any luck North Ex-
tended should be worth watching. Stopes in
No. 6 level only carry decent stone up
40ft., and the new make there has been hard
hit by a fault, on the fringe of which gold
doesn’t hang. Below that level the new
make has dropped into the main lode and
disclosed a shoot about 200 ft. long, and it
is from here that most of the current term’s
divs. will come. If prospects were only as
good at No. 8 level everybody concerned
would be smiling. As it is Hansen is going
shaft-sinking and crosscutting for all he’s
worth. His worst fear must be that Dayles-
ford, like Berringa, has yet to find a decent
mine below 1000 ft.
A tug-of-war is in progress at New Langi
Logan, Ararat (Vic.), over contract work.
Miners won’t have the system, on the plea
that it means sweating. What part the co.
will take in the argument depends a lot on
the value of the ground to be stoped. If it
carries 2oz. dirt it would be foolishness to
court a strike, but with loz. stuff two or
three months’ hold-up might be welcomed if
Bill Toole could keep the pumps at work.
But it is very unlikely that the engine-
drivers would remain at their job. A
general strike, of course, would mean the
swamping of the mines. The disagreement
threatens to be an awkward one for both
parties.
With a big gutter and 12dwt. ground to
work, Duke Extended, Ararat (Vic.), went
back £l4OO last half-year and seemed to have
a fair prospect of getting into the machinery-
man’s hands. Then shallow ground to the
nor’-west was touched. This led to a revival
of all the old yarns about the co. having
missed the gutter by branching away to the
north-east, instead of going dead ahead into
Morey’s paddock from the big hole in the
bend of the lead. Work to the west, there-
fore, is pure prospecting, but the game is
worth playing, as any development would
mean a new mine.
“D.F.”: The Tasmanian w r ater-power
scheme is going to boom if all the inquiries
made for power result in business. If all
the people who are asking for quotations
take what they ask for, the Government will
have to find over 130,000 horse-power. The
Great Lake scheme can ultimately supply
about 85,000, possibly more, but the new and
still optimistic Hydro-Electric Department
has got an idea that it may want more than
that before it is through, and is already
looking at Lake St. Clair and other possible
sources of 'supply. Besides the Amalgamated
Zinc there is talk of woollen mills, pottery
works and chemical works, and there are
inquiries about hydro-electric power for
working iron deposits. Of course some
of these things are right up in the air, but
some of them are likely to get down to dots.
The Gillies zinc process and the reported
big works at North-west Bay seem, by the
way, to have faded a little into the back-
ground since big Baillieu bustled in and his
Amalgamated Zinc Co. took the limelight.
* * * *
Tasmania is getting a little excited over
the prospect of having big zinc works estab-
lished there in connection with the State’s
new hydro-electric scheme. Two months ago
its hopes were fixed in Gillies; now it is
Baillieu who has swept the islanders off their
feet. Gepp, of De Bavay’s (Amalgamated
Zinc), who was hurried off to find a market
for the co.’s zinc concentrates when the
Belgian and German buyers failed, brought
back word of electrolytic success at Ana-
conda. It is on this that all the talk is
based. But nothing has been said so far
about costs; and that was the cockroach in
the butter last time. The last time was
when Ashcroft was able to put such figures
before Moreton Frewen, who put them
before the Gibbses, that the Sulphide Cor-
poration was formed, and a third of a mil-
lion was wasted at Cockle Creek. The costs
of power in Tasmania will be muck less, of
course; but until it knows much more than
it does at present Tasmania had better put
ice on its head. It is much better to wear
it there than around the feet just at present.

Last year Cloncurry (N.Q.) produced
minerals worth £758,748. The Duchess is,
of course, the big mine, and its reserves are
now estimated at 80,000 tons. Last half-year
19,000 tons averaged 16.4 p.c. copper. With
the 850 ft. and 1000 ft. levels under develop-
ment, reserves may be replenished quickly,
but it will be a marvellous mine if it con-
tinues to average 16 p.c. So far only crude
ore has been smelted on the field, but
Hampden has large quantities of low-grade
oxidised ore at the Macgregor and low-
grade sulphides in all its mines ; hence the
future will see leaching from the oxides and
concentration of the low-grade sulphides.
* * * *
Last year Day Dawn P.C. was wound
up; now Mills United has decided on the
same course. Both worked the Day
Dawn reef, and between them paid over
£1,200,000 in dividends. It was a party of
Germans who opened the Day Dawn P.C.,
which was a big low-grade quartz formation
near the surface.

How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little fine per-
fume added, and some Puritol wax,
which has such a imputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects the skin from heat and
dust. Its healing effect is well known on
blotchy skins, and undoubtedly many of the
fine complexions are due to the use of Puritol
Wax Soap.* [1

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, March 27, 191 G.
My Dear Arini, —
A Conservatorium audience spent a recent
evening with the Verbrugghen quartet.
Mozart and Schubert were amongst those
present. Director Henri V., having waited
for the company to settle down, began his
discourse on music, good, bad and worse,
lie means to illustrate the last, as a Dread-
ful Example, in the near future. The lec-
turette having finished, the Master retired.
Then a vassal came forward to request that
“no knitting” should be part of the next
item. This blow was accepted in a spirit
of Christian fortitude. A few loud “Hear,
hears” came from those irritable members of
the long-haired tribe who don’t propose to
march to Tipperary. The most dramatic inci-
dent was the forerunner of a brilliant per-
formance of Schubert’s quartet, “Death a-nd
the Maiden.” The maiden —a student in azure
blue flounces —dashed on to the stage, and
began her “Touch me not!” ditty to Death
—presumably Nelson Illingworth at the
piano. This done the fiddlers got to work ;
and the work was admirable. Verbrugghen
and his tuneful three fit each other like the
pieces in a mosaic. It is not a world’s
masterpiece, but a small slice of perfect
harmony.
Why is rmisic so conducive to the garden-
rake coiffure? The first lecture-concert in
the Conservatorium brought together a record
assemblage of tousled locks. Even a curry-
comb would have done something for the
high thinkers. Two grey heads of beauti-
fully-dressed silky hair were an oasis in a
field of tangled haystacks.
Verbrugghen comes down with the weight
of a guilty conscience on the toes of the
concert-goers who glue their noses to the
score. He feels, as ordinary people do,
though they didn’t like to mention it before,
that the person with the music up against
his knee is losing the general effect of a
performance. In opera, for instance, the
score-reader is only concerned as to whether
the chief soprano expires on a high C or a
half-tone lower. Then there’s the rattling
of the leaves- —a special nuisance to adjacent
nen trals.
The three chubby-faced, cheery Tennyson
boys, who used to go out riding with Dick
Nevill, were the bright spots in a dreary
regime at Government House. The most
frolicsome of the lot. Harold, died lately
on active service. The Benjamin of the
family was a junior lieut. somewhere in
the North Sea when the call came. The
two older boys are both in khaki.
The temporary lull iu gift evenings is
due to the battalion ladies —or some of them
—wondering where they are. Battalions
and brigades and reinforcements are in the
melting-pot. No, I don't mean Egypt. The
week has been sprinkled with private cables:
“Transferred to this,” or that; “Battalion
renumbered” so and so. And there have
been other cables which were quite harmless,
but told all that w T as of any importance in
the heading. “I can’t tell you where I
am,” one ingenious young man wrote a while
ago, “because, being the Censor. I would
have to blot it out. But I can’t censor the
postmark.”
The Munro Fergusons, originally timed to
get here about Easter, came nearly three
weeks ahead of the first schedule. So the
covers of Admiralty House chairs were
hurriedly folded away last W'eek-end. His
Ex. makes forestry his hobby. Ilis own
place in Scotland is one of the best-timbered
20,000 acres in N.B. Since he settled
down here he has collected every kind of
Australian wood he can put his hands on,
and one room at the Federal humpy is as
much like a timber-yard as the sub-regal
woodman can make it.
Lady Helen is to open a new Free Kinder-
garten in the backwoods of Rozelle on April
12.
The State vice-royalty is. as usual, en-
trusted with the opening of the Easter
Show. It’s not a rosy job. It means, to
begin with, a solid midday meal, heavily
weighted with agricultural oratory, fol-
lowed by a brief competition in bellowing
against the beasts in the show ring. The
beasts usually win, and the crushed Excel-
lency’s concluding remarks are merely whis-
pered to the reporters.
Heaton Rhodes, the M.L. magnate who
has been doing time (just for love) at Red
Cross work in Egypt, is on his way home
to the mansion near Christchurch and the
famous garden where they talk of flowers
by the acre.
The Darnleys have given Cobham Hall,
in Kent, for the use of Australian wounded
during the war. She was one of the Morphy
family of Victoria before she stepped into
Dehrett by marrying cricketer Ivo Bligh.
All the sporty young Australians who
have got into khaki in England are not
going for commissions with the airmen. One
youngster, whose tastes lay more in shooting
’em on the wing, having won a commission,
is going through a course of anti-aircratt
gunnery. This lad, Fitzgerald, has a
mother in Launceston (Tas.) ; but a year
or two ago he was one of the brilliant boys
at Riverview, on our own Lane Cove.
The spinning-wheel (nearly called it
jenny) is now a household pet in woolly
homesteads. At Glanmire Hall, the Ivatts’
bis humpy beyoud Bathurst, they spin the
wool off tlieir own mutton. An ingenious
station-hand not only scours the fleece but
dyes it khaki. The obliging gumleaf sup-
plies the mixture.
Moyra Maclntyre, a Sydney girl—she’s a
daughter of Donald Mac, who lias been in
England for a while —is to marry young
Atkinson Willes. He’s a dashing lieut. in
the Hussars. But Hussars have now to
dash in khaki instead of in crushed-straw-
berry breeches with an upper terrace of
gold ropes. Willes is a son of an admiral,
and mother used to sign her name Mort.
She belongs to the old Sydney family that
still grows bacon and cheese down Bodalla
way.
Adrian Knox, Iv.C., is putting in over-
time telling us about the socks-and-pyjamas
side of war. He went up to Killara fete
to help tlie War Chest, and improved tlie
shining hour with Egyptian reminiscences.
Mrs. Budden, wife of the man who keeps
count of War Chest comforts in the sandy
kingdom, was in charge of the piracy.
Genial Captain McArthur, of tlie E. and
A. line, crossed the bar the other night. The
sudden call came in his own home at Rusli-
cutter’s Bay. The sorrowing widow used to
he Miss Annie Brownlow. In the days that
are dust the Brownlow family lived at
Eaton, the big square house with green
ficus whiskers, which the Fosberys after-
wards moved into.
Bernard Tripp, one of Canterbury’s squat-
ters, goes off to Bharaoh’s country next
month to look after M.L. parcels and com-
forts that have been astray mostly since the
strife started. He travels on his own cheque.
The Women Bainters’ show is still
patiently angling for public support, and
will keep its line out till about the second
week in April. Till then the wares will
hang against the crushed-mulberry walls in
the Education palace. Visitors are putting
Betty Solomons on their list of promising
artists. Gertrude Williams tosses off a
charming Norwegian sketch. E. M. Scott
sees the cheerful red blob ou a quaint bit of
old Bruges. Mabel Barling sticks to the
Zoo for inspiration, and prices at 80 guineas
a picture in which tlie lion is leading gentle-
man.
Australian soldiers go the whole hog with
regard to their commanding officer. If they
like him they keep on telling him so. If it’s
the other way about —well, the O.C. is
equally well informed. The welcome-home
to Colonel Burnage, of the 13th Battalion,
was starred with the flattering remarks of
the boys. Randwick Hospital had given
them an evening out. Some of them were
so afraid of being late for the welcoming
that they hobbled off to catch a tram before
the motors arrived to rush them easily to
town.
Burnage, C. 8., is a tall, slender man with
a still-useless left arm —a souvenir of Gal-
lipoli—and a smart, soldierly presence. Some
of the 13th Comforts Fund ladies w r ere in
charge of the Wentworth Hotel winter-gar-
den party. The welcome from the khaki visi-
tors was so vociferous that Captain Brache
—also damaged in the ISth’s Gallipoli rush
—had to use the serpent’s guile. To enable
Cullen, C.J., to finish reading the Batta-
lion’s address to the guest, Brache would
occasionally call a halt for three cheers.
That gave them a chance to all let off steam
together. Amongst the mothers of the Bat-
talion present w'ere Mrs. Louis Henderson
(her boy enlisted, and is now a captain at
the Front) ; Mrs. Stevens, wife of the
Farmer and Settler’s editor; and Mrs. A.
Fox. The address rolls up in a wallet —a
handier thing than a framed and glazed
trophy. It shows watercolor bits of the
peninsula that tlie 13th isn’t likely to forget.
Dean Talbot reappeared with his copper-
haired lady at this party. Fie stuck to his
silk hat for some time, but finally removed
it (yet not to sing its Maker’s praise) as
his gaiters confronted the State’s vice-excel-
lency. Albert Edward, wlio looks more like
a smart young commercial traveller than a
cleric, lias come back from Gallipoli with a
velvet finish on his former slightly aggres-
sive manner.
Wireless w T ill tell Melba of her father’s
death. Brobably the Niagara’s skipper will
have the wretched business of breaking the
news. Our skylark takes her emotions m
desperate earnest. She was devoted to the
old dad who has just passed out in Mel-
bourne. The thing has happened that she
feared —lie has died and she absent fiom bis
bedside.
A one-time S’Australian, Ethel Maud
Brookman, recently said she would to Bat
Kirkpatrick, at Sukkur, India. The groom
is in the Indian police. The bride s parents
have been domiciled in London . since,
striking it rich in gold, they said good-bye
to the vine-growing State.
The autumn show of the Horticultural
Society filled St. James’s Hall with dazzliug
color; for, in spite of a fine_ tally of roses,
in was the day of the brilliant dahlia.
Heavily-whiskered enthusiasts gasped joy-
ously at the wonderful evolution of our old
friend whose skirts were tightly drawn
about its sides. The gorgeously-plumaged
cactus —its modern rich relation —was a
notable exhibit in which F. C. Love grove
and Sons gathered in a hatful of prizes.
The meek bouvardia’s first prize exhibitor
was Mrs. E. Sliortus. C. T. Gosper showed
the rich man’s pet. the orchid. Its mauve
velvet frock, flecked with deep amethyst,
always tempts the brush of Mrs. Ellis
Rowan. As it has been ever since time
began, the patriarchal Bradley was over-
seer-in-chief of the show.
With the “Beg-o’-my-lleart” Co- that’s
coming for inspection here at Easter, a Syd-
ney maid will line up. Beatrice Yaldwin
returns after years spent in getting hall-
marked abroad. A niece of the expensive
Mrs. Buckland Taylor, who used to belong
to Queensland and now inhales the Fog, Miss
Yaldwin got the needful aid to stagecraft at
Tree’s Dramatic School. Another aunt of
note, Mrs. Dudley White, of Vic. Barracks,
is doing her hit at the Rose Hall Soldiers’
Lodge, Darlinghurst, and directing a rifle
corps between shifts.
A Gunnedali man. W. B. Heffernan, is
engaged to May Nash, of Grenfell. lhe
Best Girl’s grandpa, the late James Tunney,
was a well-known N. S. Wales squatter in
the early days.
The death of tlie gentle Mrs. Deas-Thom-
son —an invalid for years—is queerly an-
nounced. The complacent little gentleman
who survives is surely responsible for the
following: “Sophia, wife of Edward Richard,
eldest son of the late Sir Edward Deas-
Thomson, C. 8., Iv.C.M.G.” After this, there
is a mention of the late lady’s father. He
was William Lawson, one of the pioneer
family, of Veteran Hall. Brospect. The
announcement is so heavily weighted with
the grandeur of the Deas-Thompsons that
it reads as if the late Will Lawson was 75
years of age. But it must refer to the de-
parted and highly-esteemed Sophia.
St. Ignatius College had a breezy summer
afternoon for its 30th annual regatta. A
mosquito fleet of small craft buzzed up the
Lane Cove for the event, and an inter-
mittent steamer-service picked up and
dropped passengers at the College wharf. The
late afternoon picking-up—for inter-river
passengers—was of the kind that drove des-
perate women to interview" astonished priests
with such questions as: “Are you the traffic-
manager?” One of the clerics was better
than that. He turned a sympathetic ear and
enlisted the help of private launch-owners.
The race of the afternoon, the unclassified
club eights, made a swift spider’s progress;
and the friends of the Leichhardt rowing-
men threw up their hats at the finish. A
Government launch, with the George Blacks
and the College chief, T. Gartlan, S.J., on
board, pulled up to collect more passengers
at the little wharf. Judge Backhouse’s
cherubic countenance showed under a
panama leaf in this politicians’ craft.
The fragile John Shearston, Superinten-
dent of the Naval House, died in the pre-
mises he loved so well. For years he looked
as if a squally southerly would blow him
away; but a dogged determination to hang
on to the work of making Jack happy in
his Sydney home kept the shore-skipper at
the helm. Ordered by various doctors at
various times “to get inland and stay there,”
Shearston only shook his head, took a week
or two amongst the gumleaves, and hurried
back to his boys.
What an illuminating record of admirals
who have come and gone Shearston could
have written! Beaumont w r as the toughest
proposition he had to handle. That out-of-
date autocrat snarled at what he called the
luxury that “spoilt” the sailors in the Naval
House. Sanded floors and deal tables, ship’s
biscuit, a tot of rum and the hard tack that
did in Marryat’s day were Beaumont’s
notion of what agreed best with Jack. John
Shearston, however, generally found the
Admiral’s lady on the side of the “spoiling” ;
and she served as a buffer between Jack’s
shore-godpa and her own autocratic sea-
lord. Before her marriage she was one of
Boston’s beauties.
Harry Gullett goes on a country tour
with John Brownlow as business manager.

Lady Jersey, now the Dowager Countess,
has broken out in a fresh literary effort.
Only a countess would dare to give the
modern world (which loves brevity) a long
title like this: “The Surprising Story of
John Alexander and the Little Man.” The
most surprising thing to the critics is that
it is not quite so dull as they expected.
The opening session of the competition

ships begins forthwith. Minister Griffith
took the chair at the first event.
Mrs. Lyster Ormsby—who was Ynys Sut-
ton Tatham a while ago—-has been thrilling
the ladies’ Chatriotic Club with tales of
tlie fresh-egg scramble in France. Helping
in a soldiers’ canteen for months, part of
her daily round, which began at 6 a.m„ was
to fry countless eggs for hungry Fran-
cois. British peeresses, who rushed the lady-
cook billets in the early phases of the war,
soon found that the voluntary-aid business
was horribly greasy.
The war may, indirectly, raise the status
of cooks. Girls who used to turn up their
pretty little noses at such things as chops
and steak are now turning up their sleeves
to grill the same. The voluntary aid who
handles raw beef in a convalescent hospital
is on the track to give her prospective hubby
a well-fed expression. Rose Hall (Dar-
linghurst) has done itself very well with the
help of a competent lady cook. Now The
Mill, the Throsbys’ old home near Moss
Yale, is a haven for invalid soldiers, and
Sylvia Waugh, the practical lass who wanted
t > take a temporary job as tram collector,
is its lion. chef.
The old Spanish comb, or its modern imi-
tation. appeared here last year at a fashion-
able assembly in the Town Hall. Since then
it lias gone on appearing with such per-
sistency' that now it sticks out askew under
every' other feminine hat. The big curved
comb —you see it in the Canaries —is meant
to bolster up the fleecy mantilla. Hence its
wild gyrations when thrust under a hard
straw thatch.
A former Sydney girl. Margaret Cramp ton,

The brigandiers who command the Old Cold

bargain counter-sale every day. At prese
they dispose, at slaughter prices, of anei
jewellerv. etc., once a week. The o
morning, at Baling’s, the buyers concen-
trated their best adjectives ou filigree s
goods. Generous- citizens who help the
chest by tearing the rings off their &.
still maintain a fairly steady dribble o
kets to meet the demand.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, March 27, 1910.
My Dear Yarrie, —
On Friday last Melbourne searched its
pockets for small change to silence the Hen-
nessy dame. Boys with scarlet and white
banners carried the invitation round town:
“Come to tea at the Town Hall.” And
there was another yearning note: “Tea all
day at the Town Hall.” The portico and
main stairway were packed from 11 a.m.
with a swarm of females, fighting as bravely
as soldiers for the shilling tickets that
admitted the owners to the tea and eatables
within. One of the Godfrey girls had a
vegetable pitch at the foot of the steps, under
a big striped umbrella. Mrs. Tallis held
the windy Town Hall corner, garbed in black-
and-white stripes and surrounded by apples
presented by country patriots. The cases
came along so fast that the stall girls won-
dered desperately how to get them brought
up from the railway. A first-line matron
who pulled her car alongside was asked:
“Would you bring some apples frorp the
station?” The dame recoiled amidst the
cushions. “ What! Apples in my new
car? Certainly not!" She wouldn’t think
of being seen abroad in the company of one
apple —much less a case of them. There’s
nothing of the “true daughter of Eve” about
an expensive matron in a costly motor-car.
Vice-regal figureheads have now taken to
killing time together. The other day, the G.-G.
and one-G. Stanley linked arms and went off
to inspect the Co-operative Fruit Company’s
place at Mildura, which is now humming
with war orders. Ben Chaffey later con-
ducted the two illustrious factory-inspectors
to his Moorna homestead at Wentworth, and
showed them what wonders a 10-acre-blocker
on the Murray’s banks could work with irri-
gation. While the two men were express-
ing polite astonishment in unison, their wives
went down together to Buchan and installed
a Bush Nurse who had already installed
herself and done much good work. Still sher
good-naturedly found a spare hour or so
for the little function, and the locals
applauded the visitors and then showed them
the famous caves.
The Ferguson and Stanley dames adroitly
timed their return from the country ti’ip for
Friday night, driving through town when the
Hennessy Button Day was all over. Their
husbands got back from the North on Thurs-
day and had to do the round of the kiosks,
swallow much tea and make speeches at the
Town Hall.
The Quamby Clubbers indulged in some-
thing they called an Egyptian Bazaar on
Saturday afternoon and evening. The
women dragged out their old Kismet Ball
dresses from tissue paper and scent sachets,
and arrayed themselves till their menfolk
dashed down their papers and kicked up a
row. The widowed Bridges dame declared
the show open, and crowds of returned sol-
diers helped all they could. Secretary
Miss Rennie had a barrowload of jewels
hung about her. It would have done the
heart of any burglar good to have had a
peep. Tickets were very carefully doled
out, only the suburban peerage gaining
admission. The spoil went to the Wounded
Soldiers’ Club. The heavily-respectable
carnival was as stodgy as one could desire,
though stout dames waddling in silk
trousers, amid incense fumes, seemed to
think they were doing SO miles an hour.
Young Franklin Peterson was the one male
in a batch of sweet young secretaries. He
varied his secretarial duties by raffling a
small dog—the sort you don’t treat as a
dog.
The Mount Schank Clarkes wore gorgeous
clothing as usual, Roma being the prize item
in a cross between Egypt and America. The
Argyles and the Outhwaites shoved in the
crowd, and Mrs. Carr Riddell wore diamonds
and black. The show of jewels was start-
lingly good. If the Crown Prince hears
about it he will pack up his gold-embossed
jemmy and start for Australia at once.
Rumor mutters that pianist Percy
Grainger is an idol in New York, outshining
even the long-established Paderewski in
popularity. Well, Percy deserved to get on.
He was the most teachable and persevering
little boy in knickers that ever infant-pheno-
menoned. What his German master told him
was law. He had no childish ways of look-
ing at things. When he had finished a per-
formance at Melbourne Exhibition Building
in the long, long ago, a gushful matron
stroked his mop of yellow hair and asked
him which of his pieces came most easy to
him. Percy looked reprovingly at the frivo-
lous inquirer and said, “Nothing is easy."
Stella Lewis Marks, Australian miniatur-
ist, has been taking tea with the Very Best
in Canada. On February 10 the Duke and
Duchess of Connaught gave a ducal luncheon
party, and Stella was an honored guest sit-
ting at the right hand of his Grace. (Sounds
almost Biblical, doesn’t it?) Our old friend
Dick Nevill sat next and told everybody
in the loudest possible voice that Melba
dubbed Stella “the Cosway of the Twentieth
Century.” (Note. —Look up Cosway in the
directory.) She is now engaged on a minia-
ture of Princess Patricia, the prettiest thing
in Britain’s royal family, who is posing in
pearls that were given her by grandmamma
Victoria. The artist showed several por-
traits in the Women Painters and Sculp-
tors’ show in New York during February.
Husband Montagu Marks, who does some
painting on his own account, is with his
wife.
Another Australian music-maker driven
home by war conditions is pianist Mabel
Muntz, who spent six months in Berlin just
before Germany broke loose. When the
crisis came the pianist had the luck to be
in Norway on holiday, and so escaped to
London. She is a bachelor of music from
the Melbourne University Conservatorium,
and in 1913 won one of the Orient scholar-
ships then for the first time handed to the
University’s brightest. When the Australian
girl got back to England from Germany
she filled in a year and a half trying to
broaden her soul by getting acquainted
with Russian music. Now she is a hot-
gospeller forv Russian culture, the Russian
concerto and Russian opera. This, coming
from a distinguished product of the Ger-
many-obsessed Melbourne music-school, must
be ill news to the present Ormond Professor.
Mabel is a daughter of a well-known Mel-
bourne roads-and-bridges expert, and there
are quantities of brains elsewhere in the
family.
The light has gone out for one bright,
smart little bride of last year. Maudie
Grantham, who married Bertram Graham,
a colonel of the Queen’s Own Corps of
Guides, India, has been informed that lie
was killed on March 11, at Latema Hill, in
British East Africa.
The semi-rural soldiers’ hospital at Caul-
field, built on a 25-acre block at the crest of
a, gentle slope, was put together under the
joint supervision of Horace Mackennal and
Major Murdoch. Glen Eira, the old house
around which the wings have been
built, is to be used for the nurses; and the
hospital itself —a series of “hut” wards —
will have a capacity of 520 beds. The pro-
perty, which used to belong to squatter
Ricketson, was bought by Home Affairs with
funds rounded up mostly by the State-school
children. 1
Stanley Argyle, X-ray artist with the
A.A.M.C., has finished his furlough, and is
off again for the Front. In peace time
Major Argyle’s practice is round town ; but
the family is well remembered by old Kyne-
ton. Reginald for some years represented
the purer Kyneton merinoes in the Vic.
Assembly.
The sewing-circle run by the Embling
widow at The Marsh, St. Kilda, has adopted
the making of kid-glove waistcoats for sol-
diers as its particular hobby. The discarded
cover, dismembered and multiplied by 20,
provides a light chest-protector when pro-
perly treated, and the demand for the com-
pleted product now considerably exceeds the
supply.
A girl who has just made the voyage to
England writes back advising a she-friend
to take a library of dainty pyjamas if she
is travelling that way. The tripper says
that she was requested to wear pyjamas
nightly from Suez to England instead of the
flowing garment. So that impossible old
Von Tirpitz has merely altered the fashions
with his torpedoes.
Mrs. Herbert Syme is surrendering her
Kew house and grounds for a fete on Satur-
day, April 8. Bags of every description are
to be sold to help the outburst, and Mrs.
McDevitt has offered a prize of a guinea for
the most original one sent in to the Ladies’
Work Association before the festive date.
But it won’t be all bags. A complete model
kitchen is to be raffled.
Fashionable Macedon is to have a Red
Ciossing on April 8, for which date Maggie
Stirling and Boffard are plotting a concert.
Maggie is hanging her half of the proceeds on
the local branch of the Red Cross, and
Boffard hands over his to the Macedon
Y.M.C.A. The Hodges are putting Boffard
up, and Mrs. Bawdon has Maggie Stirling
as guest.
Sylvia Little, a South Yarra belle who has
both beauty and a bank balance, was the
other day married to James Webb, a Cana-
dian doctor who, after the honeymoon, in-
tends carrying on the bone-setting industry
at Northcote, where he has bought a practice.
Bookmaker Barney Allen is now the proud
father-in-law of a baron, hight Gerald
George De La Riviere, who last week went
through the Wilt-thou-I-wilt business with
Barney’s pretty daughter Doris. The baron
is rumored to own large pieces of Banana-
land. He is 24, and Doris has only lately
put her hair up.
Captain Guy Miller, killed in action some
months ago, will be only a legendary hero-
father to the small son who was born last
week in the dark of London. The cable
reports mother and child both well.
Having our kultur, too, we are acquiring
a Music Club, my dear, which hopes to
“encourage love of music” and study _ the
works of eminent practitioners, especially
those of British composers.” # There will be
lectures, recitals, and a lending library ot
musical works. Fritz Hart, of the
servatorium, who does the concert notices
for the Age. is a moving spirit and a vice-
president; Melba is president, and a com-
mittee on which Art and lucre are about
equally represented has been formed.
Fritz Hart is inviting folk to a lecture
recital” on Friday, March 31, at 8.15. Hal
Elvins is to play, and somebody else is to
explain all about it. At least, I think
that is the idea.
When the Bert Bailey co. puts on “The
Message from Mars” the appearance of
Albert himself in the heavenly-visitor part
is not to be looked for. He widy lazily roll
over to see the first-night production, but
just now he is taking it easy in the sun
amongst the chickens at his Lake I arm at
Morrisset (N.S.W.). The footlight selector
has just about roared himself hoarse as Dad
at one-night stands in two States.
The vice-regal Stanleys quietly opened a
show of water-colors in the Fine Art Society’s
Rooms, at the Centreway, the other day.
The works are by Charles? M. Here and
Francis Dodd, of London. There are 50
paintings altogether, and they are all worth
looking at. Gere is best known in London as
a portrait painter. The Stanley dame has a
portrait of herself by him, and a head of a
child named Adelaide. She brought both
and had them put in the Exhibition as fine
examples of his delicate style. The picture
of the pretty little lady herself looks like a
Rossetti. Dodd has a heavier method, and
gets his finest effects in a species of color-
frenzy.
Cousin Adelaide’s wicked gossip : —■
Races at Port Adelaide, an outburst of Irish
enthusiasm in the streets and at the Oval, and the
first of the Ashmead Bartlett lectures, provided really
wild dissipation on Saturday. At the races soldiers,
many of them war-worn, were in the proportion of
about four to one. Which reminds me that the first
Australian training farm for returned Kangaroos is
an established fact. Of course we’ve taken the lead.
Returned men who work there will get ss. a day
and their keep, and will put in from three to 12
months’ training. We’ve established it at Pompoota.
When I’ve got time I’ll apologise for the name.
The outgoing mail steamer took E. A. Wilcox,
who is booked for honorary Red Cross work in
Egypt.
Major Darvall has stepped into the Commandant’s
shoes here. He’s a Bananalander by birth, arrived
in Brisbane in ’73, and has soldiered in all the
States except Tasmania. For about 10 months he
was in charge of the camp at Broadmeadows.
The Mount Lofty flower show, which is one of
our best-scented fixtures, broke a few of its own
records in spite of a summer so dry that we
wouldn’t know the drought was over unless we were
told so. Mrs. E. C. Stirling was responsible for the
“opening,” vice the Bonython dame, who was busy
being ill. Professor Stirling, by the way,. has been
appointed to the Public Library Board in Professor
Jethro Brown’s place.
A will providing for the development of “kauri
and other valuable forests, for establishing forests of
hundreds of varieties of bambusa and filling them
with local and foreign song and useful bird life in
the districts of Australia,” has been occupying the
attention of a harassed Court. The estate is to be
used for that purpose for 20 years, and afterwards
is to be divided amongst various legatees. Unfortu-
nately it is only worth £5OOO. The Chief Justice
has summed the scheme up as one for the establish-
ment of a “beautiful plantation in Central Australia
in an inaccessible locality to provide a home for
birds.” Incidentally, of the committee appointed to
deal with the matter, three (Dr. Holtze, Mr. W r . Gill
and Mr. H. Chewings) have washed their hands of
the whole affair, and the fourth (Mr. Caldwell) is
dead. I’m afraid the birds will never build their
nests in the whiskers of the legacy.
Lieut.-Col. Maurice Hankey, who has got a
K.C.B. and has been made an officer of the Legion
of Honor for distinguished conduct in the war, can
be partly claimed by this State, seeing that his
father held land in the North and his mother was
one of the Bakewells—a daughter of the late Mrs.
W. Bakewell, of Payneham.
Our motor-’buses are going into temporary retire-
ment, partly owing to the price of petrol and partly
because they don’t like our roads. Also someone
says the management was wrong and the type of
’bus was no good. Generally you’ll conclude that
the carburetter has boiled over.
Constance Waugh writes sweetly from
London to a faithful Melbourne friend about
parties for convalescent soldiers, Red Cross-
ings and other good works. Rupert is doing
war-work handy.
The Loongana, running from Launceston
to Melbourne last week-end, shared a droll
scare with the Kakapo, of the Union line.
Each took the other for a German cruiser
and puts its lights out. A lot of passengers
on the Loongana were in a state of appre-
hension, and King O’Malley, who lost his
pince-nez overboard whilst looking for
trouble, prepared himself for the worst.
The Alec McCullochs, of Adelaide, are
bringing niece Eileen Beresford to Mel-
bourne for her trousseau-gathering. Eileen’s
grandfather was a first cousin of Admiral
Charles, and there are quite a lot of the clan
scattered hereabouts. Her fiance is a wealth.)
Adelaide doctor.
George Chirnside, who convoyed daughter
Audrey to Egypt and then on to London,
just waited to welcome Mrs. George. Then
he said he’d better go and see what the
Labor people were doing, and took ship for
Australia.
Elinor Thornhill and Lieutenant 11. L.
Swinburne, son of the Gisborne Swinburnes,
have decided that one surname will do them
both in future.
The Best dame’s carnival raged for three
days at the Canterbury Gardens, finishing up
late on Saturday night. It was like all the
other carnivals that ever happened in his-
tory. I won’t even know if I attended it
until I look at my engagement ledger. If
one of the side-lines had been the burning
of a suburban mayor at the stake I might
have remembered the show and set it apart
in my mind. Why can’t the organisers of
these things show some originality and give
a literary bud a chance?
After waiting for years, Florence Ilood,
the modest violiniste daughter of the Vic-
torian Judge, has just made her London
debut in a big and encouraging wav at
Albert Hall, with Landon Ronald’/ orcht
tra. I lorence was severely handicapped bv
the same Landon, who insisted on her plav
ing at a fortnight’s notice a difficult concerto
she had never tackled, likewise refused her
a rehearsal, and also made her get on terms
with a new violin because he thought the one
she brought hadn’t lungs enough f or the
monster edifice. She made a hit in spite of
these trials, and may be said definitely to
have arrived—if there’s much in that when
some of the most famous British musicians
are clutching eagerly at the casual guinea or
guinea and a half.
Wellington (M.L.) recently parted reeret-
fully with Natalie Allen, B.Sc., a clever girl
who bagged her degree at Victoria College
in the home of the winds. She comes to this
State to hold the job of demonstrator in
Natural Philosophy at Melbourne Uni.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

Recipe to Darken Grey Hair
This Home-made Mixture Darkens Grey
Hair and Removes Dandruff.
To a half-pint of water add:
Bay Rum l° z *
Orlex Compound a small box
Glycerine l oz -
These are all simple ingredients that you
ear; buy from any chemist at very little cost,
and mix them yourself. Apply to the scalp
once a day for two weeks, then once every
other week until all the mixture is used.
A half-pint should be enough to darken the
grey hair, rid the head of dandruff and kill
the dandruff germs. It stops the hair from
falling out and relieves itching and scalp
diseases. It promotes the growth of the hair
and makes harsh hair soft and glossy. — Advt
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Moana” : The prosperous cookies of North
Canterbury (M.L.) awoke the other morning to find a
lot of their best horses in the grip of a strange epi-
demic. The nags had been attacked by a type of
paralysis in the legs that caused them to fall down
in agony and snuff out. The symptoms are similar
to tetanus without the lockjaw, and the sickness is
highly infectious. When I was out there just now the
cockies were leaping frantically in the direction of
the telegraph office with urgent wires to Premier
Massey asking him what he intended to do about it.
Probably the first thing he'll do is to try to raise
a few quid on the disease at the pawnshop.
* * * *
“Blank File”: Let me whisper at the top
of my voice to “Two Seas” (B. 9/3/’l6) that pigs
when swimming do not cut their throats. Recently
a full-grown son of the Kaiser fell off a steamer in
Sydney Harbor, and for over five hours swam round
Circular Quay and adjacent regions. After dodging
the ferries and exciting the interest of everybody who
crossed the harbor, the Crown Prince was landed
on the Mosman ferry wharf in good order and con-
dition, without the slightest sign of a wound on
neck or anywhere else. In brief, he brought home
the bacon unimpaired. •
“Mulga”: I’ll vouch for “Barcoo’s” re-
marks on the rosewood of Bananaland (B. 24/2/’l6),
excepting when he claims it to be the straightest tree.
In this respect it will not bear comparison with the
ironbark that surrounds Barakula, the timber village
out from Chinchilla on the Western railway section.
Euclid's axiom of a straight line can be applied to
many specimens up to 80ft., while frequently the
trunk has no projecting limbs lower than 100 ft.
Practically the whole of the timber required for rail-
way purposes on the Western line comes from this
part, a fine sample of its gun-barrel straightness
being seen in the large piers that comprise the
Warra coal stage.
* * * *
“Franklin”: 1 cannot say whether other
instruments act similarly, but, for telling 24 hours
beforehand of the breaking of the local drought, all
the rain prophets that were ever born are not in it
with my upright grand. As soon as the touch
becomes crisper and the sound more “singing” than
usual, I can guarantee that if I’m out of bed early
enough I 11 see the milkman coming down the street
with the lid off his can.
“D.F.”: A Swan Hill snake had some
fun with a party of Victorian motorists the other
day. The serpent allowed the newchums in the car
to see it lying on the road ; but, when they got out
to do violence to it, it slithered rapidly to the car
and, uttering a wild laugh, undulated into it. The
motorists weren’t travelling with snakes that day,
so they wearily hoofed the eight miles into the near-
est town, while the driver gingerly steered the
machine after them. Arrived in town the whole
party got crowbars and things and turned the motor
inside out, finally discovering the sausage of death
under the hood. It died with a smile on its lips,
waving its hands and assuring its persecutors that it
had intended to commit suicide anyhow.
* * * *
“Tropicus” : Amongst the mountaineers of
the Owen Stanley Range (Papua) a form of religion
exists which is based on the worship of the dead,
combined with cannibalism and various horrid rites.
Every human is alleged to be the home of many
spirits in the various phases of life, the spook who
occupies his body as a babe giving place to that of
the boy, and in turn being succeeded by various
other older spirits. These spooks are supposed to live
in the jungle, and are greatly feared by all the dis-
colored brethren, for some are bad and liable to
cause trouble to the person they enter. Often I have
heard the blame for a crime handed to the wraith
who was alleged to be in possession of the criminal’s
body when he committed the offence. Consequently
the average hillman dislikes to sleep with his mouth
open, because a hostile spook might take possession
of his body while his resident spirit was away visit-
ing his brother spooks. Sleep is the period when the
spook in residence has time off. Hardly any decent
mountaineer will ever wake another man without
first gently calling to the sleeper and gradually rous-
ing him so as to allow the wandering spirit time
to return into the sleeper’s body. An old maneater
once informed me that his son was a good warrior
and a killer of men because he had the same spirit
that attended him when he (the 0.m.) was a young
buck. This belief in spirits has, of course, been the
means of making sorcery a fine art, for some of the
more intelligent men, who wish to live easily, con-
vince their weaker-minded brethren that they (the
sorcerers) have communication with the dead and
can cast out (for a suitable fee, say, a pig or a
woman) unwelcome devils.
VENGEANCE.
THE EJECTED GROGAN: “Won't gimme another drink, is it, yer lot o' — cows! Oi'll
get even wid yer fer this! Oi'll take out a probishun order aginst mesilf!"
“D.F.”: The dingoes were very bad a few
years ago up towards the head of the Murrumbidgee,
and some of the squatters let bloodhounds loose
under the fond delusion that they would kill out the
dingoes. Instead of that they intermarried with
them, and the last state of the squatters is worse than
the first, for they are now harried by increasing num-
bers of a bloodhound-dingo cross—huge, fierce brutes
that will pull down a good-sized calf, let alone a
mere sheep.
SOOTHING THE SAVAGE PEST.
Mr. E. A. Riley, M.A., in a lecture to teachers, suggests that the best way to reduce
refractory small boys to order is to sing to them.
“Warre” (B. 24/2/T6) asks for
the bag-sewing record. I don’t know, but would like
to put this amongst the starters. I saw a man here
(near Maroona, Vic.) two years ago average 225 for
the season. He also cooked the meals for himself
and two others. There were 3000 of these bags, and
they went over 1951 b. each. I know because I had
to lump them.
* * * *
“A.G.li.”: W anted, a remedy for weevil
in barley. The past year was, in South Aus., emi-
nently suitable for the breeding of the pest, and
holders of the grain suffered heavy loss from its
attacks. This was quite contrary to expectations. It
was thought that after such a hot year as 1914 the
grain would be too dry and hard to allow the weevil
to thrive, but as it turned out the better class of
barley contained 10 or 11 per cent, of moisture,
which is only slightly under the percentage in a
normal season. Also, can anyone settle the question
as to whether the weevil bores into grain or whether
it eats its way out? It is common to find a full-
grown weevil inside barley, the interior of which has
been eaten while the husk is sound and apparently
unperforated.
Cleveland”: The leathery substance
“J.H.L.” (B. 17/2/’l6) has seen growing on the
sides of trees is not included in the bill of fare of
the snake, nor do I know of any other thing that
creeps, crawls or flies which browses on the fungoid
growth. There is plenty of it in Maoriland, and
there it prefers to attach itself to the towai, puketea,
or totara, the first-named being most favored. The’
name given to it by bushmen, i.e., snake-bread, is as
wild and imaginary as the term “whale feed” or
“whale spawn” that is usually given to the thick
brownish scum that is frequently observed in tropi-
cal waters. • This stuff is only seen when the day
low-waters go lower than the night ones (April to
October), thus exposing the reefs to the rays of the
sun long enough for the slimes to dry. The rising
tide lifts them and the winds do the rest.
* *

•Papua” : Wandering along the coral reefs
in the Western Pacific and New Guinea the person
with keen eyes can observe some weird and curious
scaled creatures. Of crustaceans about the most
horrible is the armored and spiked giant-crayfish,
which I have seen up to 32in. in body. This devilish
animal is the cause of horrible wounds on brown
brother. But, served with mayonnaise, it is a dish fit for
a middle-aged bookmaker. Another fiend is the stone-
fish, the spines of which are said by the simple
savage to be the home of unmanned women after
their decease. The pain of a puncture from the
dorsal spines of this demon in every case I have
observed—and I have seen scores—drove the victims
clean crazy within lOmin. A highly-religious soul-
saver of my acquaintance, who trod on a tiny speci-
men of the curse while we were bathing off the beach
m front of his residence, was so overcome by the
agonising pain that “he knew not what he did.” The
spectacle of a tubby, chin-whiskered and unclothed
gentleman rushing madly about a mission compound
emitting scalding language amidst crowds of giggling
boy and girl savages is not an uplifting one. A good
second in rank to the “stone” comes the unicorn-fish,
a horror with a triangular head, armed with a long
horn fixed between its eyes. Its sting is not so last-
ing as that of the black sea-egg. The latter is the
tottering brink in marine horrors, and its wicked
spikes bring on a sort of blood-poisoning if not
quickly dug out by the village medicine-man. Quite
a humorist in a quiet way is the box-fish, which,
while giving its victim merely a swollen leg and
lumpy glands for a week or two, causes some innocent
mirth to the ingenuous cannibals. Tickled on the
stomach it gives an imitation of rotundity nearly as
developed as George Reid’s, and when playfully
smitten on the tummy it bursts with a loud sound
and spreads its internal clockwork about the land-
scape.
‘‘S. C. McL.” : On the Peak Downs, Cen-
tral Queensland, old blackboys say that the favorite
abo. method of combating snake venom is to cut
round the wound deep enough to open the larger
veins immediately after being bitten. They claim
this to be a certain cure for the poisoning, without
any risk of serious consequences from the operation.
Pure blood will flow first, and as the poison reaches
the cut, instead of passing on through the veins to
the heart, it is discharged. The jags made by the
knife are then plastered with wet earth, and before
long black brother is as good as new.
VISIBLE MEANS OE SUPPORT.
MAGISTRATE: “You are plainly one of those
men who can't stand drink.”
ACCUSED: “Beggin' yer Honor's pardon, Hi
wuz standin' drinks the whole evenin'!”
“Montalex”: The Australian Museum at
Sydney has a fine specimen of the sun-fish. There
is no more grotesque-looking' creature in existence.
Shaped like the prologue of an ordinary fish cut
square off amidships, it has for tail a fringe, from
the upper and lower corners of which project the only
two fins, dorsal and anal. The fish reaches a great
weight; I have shot one that went very close to

THE PHANTOM FIRES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Campfires redly beckoning
Out of the Past for me ;
Fires beyond all reckoning,
Gleaming from sea to sea.
Fires a-strangely glimmering
(The wearied dog beside) ;
Embers for ever shimmering,
Out on the paths of pride.
Fires beyond all perishing ;
And oh ! they brightly brought
Dreams that were dreamt for cherishing—
Dreams that have come to nought!
Fires that were lit in my season
Of youthful might and main ;
Fires that were lit in my ease on
Tracks where I’d loaf again !
Time, the glutton, has eaten them ;
Winds have blown them away ;
Rain and the hail have beaten them,
Leaving the ashes grey.
Quenched —and yet they are shining still,
Early at night, and late;
And in their glow I am dining still,
Swapping yarns with a mate.
Aye, far away on the lonely tracks,
By mulga, gum and pine,
That once to me were the only tracks,
The long-quenched campfires shine!

The Famous Home Remedy
... for ...
Headaches, Breakdown,
Backaches, Depression,
Dyspepsia, Palpitation,
Insomnia, Rheumatism,
and other Disorders of
, the Nervous System.
When the nervous system is built up, headaches, backache, dyspepsia, neuralgia
and other neurasthenic conditions disappear ; insomnia gives way to natural sleep,
and the capacity for work, both mental and physical, is wonderfully increased.
That is why Hean’s Tonic Nerve Nuts are so successful. A typical example of
their restorative properties is that of
Mr. WILLIAM D. BEAR, Ex-Superintendent
of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Sydney,
who, writing on December 15, 1915, said :
MR. G. W. HEAN,
Dear Sir, —I have for many years been
a martyr to nerve troubles, for which I
have used no end of treatments. AVhile
many of them were stimulating in their
effect for the time being, their use was
invariably followed by a depressing
reaction, and so I had to go on swal-
lowing drugs. Recently I had an
especially bad attack, was completely
run down and became very depressed.
I was persuaded to try Hean’s Tonic
Nerve Nuts. I have just finished the
second course of them, and I am pleased
to say the improvement in my health
has been most marked. In fact, I am
feeling my old self once more. My only
regret is that I did not know of your
excellent Tonic Nerve Nuts years ago.
I shall miss no opportunity of recom-
mending them to anyone suffering from
nerve troubles, as I am thoroughly con-
vinced there is no liner restorative pro-
curable.
Yours faithfully,
WILLIAM I). BEAR.

an inspector to examine and pass every pair before delivery is taken.
Some pairs, when finished, fail to pass him—not for any fault that
really affects their wear or comfort, but for such minute defects as
one boot being as little as one-eighth of an inch higher at the back
than th e °th er >‘ one slug being oi t of place; or the heel not bein'--
sufficiently even to pass the spirit-level test.
Nothing else is wrong* with the rejects.

“Mulga” : Here’s an effective way of keep-
ing a bullock down if, after throwing it, there is no
rope handy to tie it. Divide the end of the tail
in two, give one strand a twist round the near hind
leg, run the other through the cloven part of the hoof
and tie together. As cattle always rise from their ,
hind props the beast will remain a prisoner until
liberated.
“Pick”: “Bush Builder” (B. 24/2/’l6)
says that buildings with pis 6 walls would suit only
in a rainless land, and that in any case they are much
more expensive than wood. Well, along the stretch
of the South-Eastern tablelands (N.S.W.), where I
ornament the scenery, and where this summer I have
seen rain spilling at the rate of 24in. in 35min., there
are many pise buildings. Occasionally they are util-
ised as dwellings, but more generally as stables,
dairies or outhouses. Many of them have withstood
the battering of all weathers, without decay, and at
Jugiong I knew a pise handball alley’, with cement-
plastered face, that remained intact for 15 y’ears.
The durability of a pise wall depends, firstly, upon
the class of material used in the mortar ; secondly, on
a solid foundation to prevent sagging and cracks;
and, thirdly, upon finish of the exterior with cement
wash or paint.
* * * *
“Wanko”: There may be something in
“Pick’s” saltwater cure for snakebite (B. 24/2/T6).
A Queensland halfcaste blackfellow showed me four
scars where Eve’s fancy had attempted to devour him.
He said that all he did after tearing the crawlers
limb from limb was to cut a small cross fairly’ deep
into the punctures with a penknife and rub salt well
in—coarse salt is best —filling up the wound by
pressing the salt in with the knife. Then he put
about a handful of salt on a handkerchief and
wrapped it over the injury. Two of the bites were
made by black snakes, so, provided he was not the
Book of Ananias, his cure was given a good try-out.
* * * *
“Will G. Buck” : When a N.Q. aboriginal
drew first horse in Tattersall’s about six months ago
he decided to go on the land like all phella white
man, and bought a holding' for £9OO. Of course, he
had to have a buggy’ to drive to town and a boy to
navigate him. During half a year on the land he
did no work, and then getting tired he went to the
ex-owner and asked him to buy the section back.
“How much y’ou want ?” “All same what I been
give y’ou.” “No.” “You givem me half?” “No.”
“All right. Well, you givem me £100.” Then the
deal was fixed up to the satisfaction of both
parties.
Simple, significant drought item from Her-
gott Springs, the far-northern South Australian town-
ship, practically the last place on the transconti-
nental towards-Darwin railway’ system. “The local
butcher has closed —scarcity of stock and lack of
feed. This is the first time since the line came
through, over 30 years ago.”

“5.0. C.”: Can any wanderer place the
Australian lilac? A friend obtained a fern from
Gippsland district, and growing out of the side was
a small shoot, which he removed and planted. In
four years it has grown to about 15ft. The flower
is not unlike the ordinary English lilac, but much
smaller, aiid the tree is something like the silver
wattle.
A HOPELESS CASE.
THE PARSON WHO HADN'T : “Look at me,
my man —I have never touched a drop
of intoxicating liquor.”
THE ONE WHO HAD: “ Don't (hie) let it
worry you, my frien’. I don't believe
anything (hie) would have done you
any good.”
Via”: Apropos tall crops (B.
17/2/’T6j).. The late James Hannah, of Stockyard Hill,
near Beaufort (Vic.), about the year 1894 had a crop
of tartarian oats that soared to Bft. 2in. Measurement
was duly’ certified to and recorded in Ballarat Star
and Courier.
WAIT AND SEE.
“Bow much will you take to clear out?”
“One bob, Mister
“But that's too much.”
“Is it? Wait till we sing again.”
“Myall” : The sporting instinct is strongly
developed in the jumbuck barber. I remember one
wool-hawk who had all his combs and cutters named
after prominent racehorses- —Poseidon, Mountain King,
Lord Cardigan, Hibernian and so on. One morning
the boss noticed that Bill was “giving them a hit
up,” leaving great ridges of wool on the backs and
around the necks. Bill accordingly received a “wire.”
“Well, boss, it’s this way,” explained William;
“I’ve got old Hibernian on this morning. He’s a
bit slow for the flat, so I’m giving him a trial over
the sticks.” Bill kept his stand, but he had to
dispense with his hurdlers.
The aboriginal is heroic at times. Some
few y’ears ago in North Queensland Charlie
was arrested for stealing a horse on which
he was mounted at the time. In his com-
pany was Pollie, a young aboriginal woman,
who disappeared like a black vapor as soon as her
lord was gathered in. Charlie was
taken to Georgetown and remanded
to Normanton. On the way to the
latter place the troopers with their
prisoner and the horse in charge
camped for the night at a wayside
pub, placing the stolen animal in a
small paddock at the rear. Pollie,
who had followed on her own two
bare, murky feet, cautiously ap-
proached the y’ard and took the
horse. Then, without saddle or
bridle, she rode the incriminating
animal through 130 miles of wild,
stony scrub country to the coast.
Arriving there she slew Exhibit A
and burned the body’, after which
she returned to Normanton again on
foot through an entirely uninhabited
country. Charlie’s trial was put off
from time to time, but in the con-
tinued absence of the horse he was
released, and found 18-year-old
Pollie beaming outside the court. It
wasn’t till long afterwards that he
learned of her exploit. Pollie just
dropped into her old position in the
Charlie household and said nothing.
“Tarwin”: “O’Phimerty’s” remarks (B.
24/2/’l6) re the teetotal hermit, reminds me of a
similar lonely soul who planted himself in the hills
between Bacchus Marsh and Sunbury (Vic.). His
i eal name was not known, but the locals soon found
a label for him, “Beardy Harry.” An expert archer,
he subsisted principally on birds and rabbits, though
occasionally he would appear in the town-
ship about dusk, and, after regaling himself
on bread and sardines, make back to the hills. When
he was missed from his usual haunts and brought in
to hospital to die (the usual end of the bush hermit),
he swore the rescuing Hop had sold his body for dis-
section, and went over Jordan denouncing the hospi-
tal bath. When man breaks back to the primitive
he seems only to use water inwardly.
“Maginnis Magee”: I hasten to inform
“H.G.” (B. 10/2/’l6) that the late lamented Pat
Minahan, of D'onnybrook (Q.), was not the only
publican who dealt in “No Mercy” cheques, as the
following verse from a very old shearing song will
prove:— ■
Up on the Barwon the old shearer stands,
Grasping the bar with his strong, bony hands;
Fixed is his eye on a green painted keg,
Says: “Till you’re emptied I won’t stir a peg;
Come along, landlord ; come along, come.
Fill up the glasses. What’s yours ? Mine's rum.”
He passes his cheque which is seized in a crack,
And the landlord takes pen and writes “No Mercy”
on the back.
A few years ago I was acquainted with a very well-
known Queensland politician who in his pre-Parlia-
mentary days ran a pub Outback. He didn’t trouble
about consulting the owner of a cheque as to whether
he wished to “knock it down” or not. His method
was quicker and much more certain. When a cheque
of sufficient calibre was presented his eyes gleamed
like a tomcat’s on a sinful night. Grabbing a bullock-
bell which always hung handy he would rush on to
the verandah and shake it to such purpose that in a
very short time the entire boozing population of the
township would assemble and “cut out” the cheque
quick and lively’.
“M B ” : Give me room to tell “F. i s h er >-
(B. 2/3/’l6) that local applications to the sting 0 f
Portuguese men-o’-war are practically useless. The
marine nuisance gives his victim a hypodermic
injection of a poison which is carried to all parts
of the system so quickly by the blood stream th t
applications to the unbroken skin are waste of e ,
time. Ammonia or essence of moonshine or am
thing else just dries off on the surface and cannot
possibly influence the injection. The onlv tr
ment for the intense pain is morphia or some potent
anodyne, and, for collapse, strychnine in therapeutic
doses. The above applies somewhat to bites hi
snakes. But C. J. Martin, of the Lister Institute
a distinguished Australian and the world’s authorin'
on snakes and snake venom, says that up to th
present only one treatment is of use in snake-bit? 6
That is permanganate of potash. The scarification
should be ruthless. Playing with the thin* j s
calling tenders for an inquest.
* * * #
“Sassafras”: I range them this way.
The best timber to stand in the ground is bloodwoo'd.'
I know a fence that dates back 74 years on the
Lower Manning (N.S.W.). The hardest chopping
timber is teak, otherwise faudosa. It is also the
best burner, but too fierce if used by itself i n a
furnace. I never saw a fireman use it exclusively
White beech is the worst burner. It refuses to be
burnt off on a clearing job, but by piling other
timber on to it it can be melted. I have seen a
bloodwood split 947 mortise posts; a teak girder
from the head of the Richmond River (N.S.W.)
16in. x 16in., 98ft. long, shipped to Japan; and a
beech pit-sawed to 9800 super feet on the North
Coast line (Q.).
* * * *
“Tropicus” : The natives of the Engineer
Group, in the Louisiade Archipelago (N.G.), have
their place for the souls of the dead on the summit
of the highest mountain on Normanby Island, which
is the most southern island of the D’Entrecasteaux
chain. When a citizen of Tubi Tubi (an island in
the Engineer Group) departs from this warful world
the time of his arrival in spiritland is governed
by the amount of weeping and eating his friends
indulge in at his removal. Deceased’s pigs are
slain and eaten by his friends and relations, who
howl and scream their worst, the women show-
ing additional “respect” to the corpse by scratching
their faces until blood flows. Amongst the most
select families in the Group it was formerly the
fashion to destroy everything owned by the deceased
- —canoes, spears, nets, cocoanut palms, houses,
etc.—but this custom is no longer practised. After
the spirit leaves the body of the dead it walks into
the sea and journeys along the bottom until the
beach of Normanby Island is reached. A tunnel
leads thence to the summit of the mountain, but
unless the dead man has been well cried for and
much “respect” shown him by his relations, the
spirit will not be able to find the mouth of the
tunnel, and will for ever wander about the
foothold of the ocean. The natives firmly believe
this happens to people who die away from their
relations. In the bad old days before the white
men came along with their laws to prevent various
flourishing unpleasantries it was the duty of the
deceased’s wife to live and sleep on the dear
departed’s grave for two moons. As the corpse wjs
covered only by five or six inches of sand, the pro-
hibition of this simple but respectful custom did not
meet with very much opposition from the widows.
TENSES.
FIRST PARTY: “I know him!"
SECOND DITTO: “You knew him!”
“ J.G.” : I’m into “Barcoo’s” (B. 24/2/10)
straightest-tree competition with the mountain ash
which is found about the ranges of southern I ic.
This is the favorite tree for timber splitters owing to
the fell nature of its- wood. It is the easiest splitter
we have. “Barcoo’s” Queensland rosewood is only a
shrub beside it for size, and it is not possible to fin
in the Australian bush a straighter vegetable or one
so clean in the trunk. It is quite common to stub your
toe on one measuring about 200 ft. from the ground to
the first limb and varying little in thickness for at
least the first 100 ft. The timber is being increasing.'
used by furniture-makers and picture-framers an
others who want an easily-worked but tough bar -
wood. Blackbutt is cousin to the mountain ash, but
is not so straight in either trunk or grain.
SUNDAY MORNING ON THE BEACH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Sunday beach was all at peace
And everyone was gay ;
It seemed as if joy could not cease
On such a sunny day ;
The garments that each bather wore
Were short behind and brief before.
Large men behaved like little kids,
And women did the same;
Nobody cared for hard-won quids,
For battles, boots or fame;
In fact, they’d reached the happy stage
We treasure as the Golden Age.
But suddenly a shadow fell
Athwart the sunlit strand,
Stilling the clear salt-water yell
One heard on every hand ;
Each wife reproved her sprawling mate
And sanded lovers sat up straight.
Silent and sad they watched It drift
Around the sun-bleached rocks,
Looking in every cave and rift
In search of moral shocks.
(Some bathers risk a police-court doom
By using Nature’s dressing-room.)
The law-abiding humbly plank
A hoarded tuppence down
To tear their clothes off in a rank
Of bathers bare and brown.
The freeman plucks his shirt off where
There’s naught but sea and wind and air.
And so the Sunday copper comes
To catch him in his skin;
While the free wind of Freedom hums
He waves the sinner in,
And presently a fine’s imposed.
(Note: Nature’s dressing-room is closed.)

This co. hauled clown its dividend, like a
good many other N.S.W. gas cos., after the
new Act was passed; but, unlike them, it
didn’t even things up by watering its capital.
So only £BOO is divided now as against the
former £l5OO a year. True, less interest
is earned now, but that wouldn’t make a
difference of even £2OO. Compare two
years:—

The outgoings certainly include amounts
transferred to plant and meter renewal
fund; but the net additions to that
fund were less in 1915 than they were in
1911. On the increased exes., and because
of new municipal competition, the co. was
thoroughly justified in hauling down the
dividend; but it was an awful bump and
the present 8 p.c. appears to be quite on the
safe side.

“ Jaspilite”: Re the Narra Tarra mine
(P». 3/2/TO). Between 1870 and 1884 it
produced £OO,OOO of lead. It was then closed
down, and very little work was done till
1913, when the Fremantle Trading Co. com-
pleted the sinking of a new shaft east of the
old workings, and opened out a level at
250 ft. vertical. The lode was cut at 64ft.
west of this new shaft, and to the end of
July, 1914, 700 tons of high grade lead ore
were shipped. An up-to-date reduction
plant, manager’s residence, and other build-
ings have been erected, and operations were
suspended solely on account of the difficulties
arising out of the war. Operations have
now been resumed.. “Cristo’s” yarn about
a miner being drowned in the Narra Tarra
is a myth. He may be thinking of
the Geraldine lead mine, 40 miles
north of Northampton, on the Murchison,
which was worked from 1857 to 1878. When
the Murchison came down, a hurried exit
had to be made from the mine, the main
shaft of which was over 300 ft. on the in-
cline. The co. had blackfellows stationed 20
miles up the river to give notice of an
approaching flood. According to local mytho-
logy a miner, after climbing up, discovered
that he had left his waistcoat and watch
below, and in spite of warning went below
to secure liis property and never returned.
* * * *
“Borgne”: The February gold yield in
Victoria shows a decrease of 10.7720 z.
compared with that of February, 1915
= a drop of 36 p.c. The ideas of
the Mines Department as to the best way
to revive the decadent gold-mining industry
are everything except brilliant or practical.
During the month advances for prospecting
were given to 10 parties of miners, and the
total amount was £466. Of what earthly
use is that sum spread over 10 mining fields?
Its obvious purpose is to catch votes. Yet
the Mines Department will not recommend
the Government to subsidise mines or miners
W’orking lodes of wolfram or antimony or
molybdenite or scheelite. In Victoria there
are big deposits of manganese, tin, gypsum
coal, brown coal, pigments and iron ore, and
small deposits of nickel, and these ought to
be developed w r ith the assistance of the Gov-
ernment. But the officials of the Mines
Department will not advise the Minister to
subsidise any persons willing to work rare
earths or base metals. The heads seem
obsessed with the theory that gold is the only
payable metal Victoria contains, and applica-
tions for help to prospect any mineral except
gold-bearing are turned dowm rapidly and
finally. Thousands of pounds are available
to re-open worked-out gold mines, but not
a penny to open any of the increasingly
valuable metals known’to exist all over Vic-
toria. Picture the official stupidity which
will not aid the establishment of a brown
coal industry!
* * * *
“Quidam”: Ever and anon hopeful souls
put cash into the re-opening of some aged
derelict. Mostly the action is based
on the popular delusion that the only
man in the world incapable of run-
ning a mine is invariably in charge,
“lie got off the gold,” “he drove
away from the shoot,” “he sunk through the
reef.” etc., they tell you. Large bodies of
highly payable ore, of course not payable in
“them days,” perpetually exist below. The
truth is that, with free milling ores requir-
ing battery treatment only, they could work
cheaper in “them days” than now’. Labor
and fuel, two important items, are far
dearer, and stores are not much cheaper in
many localities. Anyway, the stores about
a battery are not very 7 expensive. One mine
in the Rockley district (N.S.W.) worked
for 2s. a ton, according to the statement or
the manager. Even then he couldn’t raise
over Is. 9d. out of the ore for a considerable
period before he closed down. Yet local
residents aver that it is a good mine still.
It paid miners 7s. and pretty w T ell nothing
at all to boys, and there w’ere very feu
conditions in regard to hours, certificate
drivers, and such items. Probably some da
someone will come along and pump out tne
shaft, and endeavor to beat the 2s. cos,
under impossible difficulties: labor higher,
wood higher, everything higher —barring 1 1
values. Of course, once it crushed tar mou
than Is. 9d., and that is alw’ays the glittei-
ing bait. The fact that a once-paying num
is generally carried on far below the payau
margin before plant and machinery a -
dismantled by the disgusted proprietary
seems impossible of recognition.
Business, Bobbery, etc,
Sample of the profits of ship-selling.
R.M.S. Oriental, once a high-class P. and
O. liner in the Australian trade, was built
in 1889. She was due to be scrapped, but
soon after war broke out the co. received an
offer from some child-like and bland heathen
in Hongkong and sold her for £32,000. Last
mail the simple child of Confucius wrote to
say that he had resold the ship for £65,000,
which is about 50 per cent, more than her
original cost.
* * * *
No wonder the price of steamers for quick
delivery is soaring. A few years ago a
firm in these parts had a certain steamer on
a lengthy time charter at £1075 a month.
The same vessel is now’ running under char-
ter on the Atlantic at £6700 a month. That’s
one reason why our Peruvian boots and the
pipes we get from Greenland’s icy moun-
tains are bounding up.
“Thraso”: A big combine is being
arranged amongst the Dutch shipping cos.
ostensibly with a view to annexing the trade
formerly done by Germany. The Holland-
America Co. during the war has earned 80
per cent, of its capital. Besides, it has
bought out the German shareholders, who
held one-fourth of the stock. Three other im-
portant Dutch cos. have been making huge
profits—the Royal Holland Lloyd, the
Royal West Indian Mail, and the Royal
Dutch. All these concerns are now associ-
ated and backed by a group of Dutch banks.
Already new services have been started to
South and Central America, Panama and
Morocco, and there is great danger that the*
combine may get a strong grip on what
hitherto has been British business. The only
way to presently meet that sort of grab will
be for the British Empire to boycott both
Dutch and Germans as to coal. In fact,
coal-supply is the key to most post-bellum
problems of trade and commerce. If the
Empire—including, of course, Australia —re-
fuses to supply coal to any nations except
our Allies, not only will it be impossible for
our German and Austrian enemies to steal
our trade or dump goods into Australia, but
the neutral nations which have been busy
annexing our trade will find their schemes
defeated and their activities paralysed.

“Murkah”: A time-saving device used in
the Maoriland telegraph service might well
be inquired into by P.M.G. Webster, with
a view to adoption on this side of the Tas-
man. It is the Christmas-greetings telegram.
The text, “Wishing you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year,” is printed on forms,
the sender adding the address and
signature. To encourage the public to adhere
to the words, such telegrams are admitted
at a cheap rate. The telegraphists then
merely transmit “Greet’gs msges,” and rip
through the addresses and signatures. The
receiving forms are printed to match, and
150 such messages can be squirted through
in an hour. In Australia the average speed
of working is about 40 telegrams an hour
and the lines are literally choked with
Christmas greeting traffic, causing all classes
of business to be heavily delayed.
* * * *
“Quid”: The wire-netting rabbit-trap is
coming into favor with fur-hunters, and
some now prefer it to the steel variety which
grips bunny by the leg. The wire variety
is of conical shape, about 4ft. long, with a
light swinging door at one end, and a remov-
able piece at the other end for taking out the
catch. The small end is inserted in a bur-
row, and all the adjacent holes are then
blocked up with paper. (Bunny won’t bur-
row through newspaper, so long as the organs
of public opinion are dry, so as to rustle
when he strikes them. Damp paper is no
good.) If kittens are about, the first few nights
will only result in crops of these youths,
Pa and Ma lying low and sayin’ nothin’.
Frequently it is a week or more before they
come out, but as 20 or so can crowd into
one trap there is profit in waiting. In a
lucerne paddock they will keep dowmstairs
for a long time, living on the roots. The
principal objection to the system is the
amount of literary matter required; one sta-
tion near Rockley (N.S.W.), with 150 wire
traps going, uses about scwt. per week. At
a time when sufficient fodder for postage
stamps threatens to become unobtainable, it
looks as if the wire trappers will have to go
out of business or take to bank notes.
* * * *
“X.”: The ragtime press is making a
patriotic noise about soldiers’ wives and
widows being harassed by grabbing trades-
people. But there is another side to it.
I live in a coal-mining village where the
pit has been working very irregularly.
One miner with a large family appealed to
the charity of the small storekeeper and
cheerfully ran up a bill of nearly £4O. .While
he was doing it he spent in cash at the pub
as much as he strapped up at the grocer’s.
Now he has enlisted, amidst the applause of
the townspeople, and the storekeeper is
unable to get any money out of him or his
wife. He can’t be got at by legal processes
and his wife says she won’t pay. I wish
some of these cheerful journalists had the
book-debts problem of the storekeeper in a
district where strikes are popular. It may
be foolish of the storekeeper to provision his
customer on credit while he quarrels with
his boss; but it is unjust to taunt him
with lack of patriotism when he asks for the
money he needs to keep him out of the
Insolvency tlourt.

Egypt is learning its English advertising
patter as fast as it can. One of the numer-
ous taverns has a leaflet out which raves
about the “luxerious and well-aerated rooms”
and “breakfasts special for the British
army.” Just round the fourteenth dirty
corner to the right is another establishment
which begs for custom in this fashion :
Don’t loose of time! Go and see as you have the
good occasion to be in Cairo the new Australian
Officers’ Embroideries Shop. If you wish to have
best and very nice presents, don’t forget to remem-
ber our new shop here on at Shareh Wagh-el-Birket
where a special draftsman is under your disposition.
And your names can be embroided on your hand-
kerchieves while you are smaking yet. Also a special
engravour is occupied by doing on silver and gold
medals, hearts different kind of brooches and brace-
lets with a very beautiful rememberies of the Pyra-
mides, the Sphinx and the Nile and a several things
very nice and artistique. A very moderated price
should be exposed for officers and soldiers. Don’t
loose of time!
* * * *
“Sarto”: The other day when the old
horse and cart arrived home from town with
a bundle of dress stuff and sundries for Mrs.
Sarto I found amongst them two or three
cards of those domes that I fasten her up
the back with. The bottom part of each
card was sawn off and on the top was
printed, “Made in U.S.A.” Now’, why didn’t
they make the lie complete and write “Made
in Australia”? But I suppose they
reckoned that that would put the show
away, because we know such things can’t be
made in Australia.
“D.F.”: Hydraulic sluicing has been
applied to potatoes as well as tin on the
North-East Coast (Tas.). A farmer there
had four acres of crop ready for digging
on a steep hillside, when there came a cloud-
burst and stripped the ground off, spuds
and all. Luckily there was a paling fence
across the bottom of the paddock and the
potatoes—the big ones, anyway—fetched up
against the fence, while the dirt went through
and left the spuds behind clean and ready
for bagging.

The banana as a sideline to the cow seems
a payable possibility of the future on the
North Coast (N.S.W.). One grower at
Mullumbimby expects to be shortly hauling
down £lBOO a year from nine acres of palms.
The fly in the salad is that the Tweed Rivers
fruit is sold in Sydney as Fijian. The
N.S.W. growers claim that their average out-
put is superior to the island average, and if
ir were properly marketed the superiority
would tell in the account sales. Moreover,
they argue that there may be an odd Aus-
tralian about who would purchase the local,
white-grown vegetable for patriotic reasons
if he had a chance to recognise it, and that
he ought to be given the chance. The bed-
rock of the trouble is that the banana has to
be plucked green, and ripened afterwards in
“sweating-rpoms.” In Sydney this business
is monopolised by a few Chows who don’t
care a coolie what color the stuff is as long
as it can be yellowed up for the market.

Yet another job for the returned soldier.
Leslie _ Gaze, an experienced pigeon-fancier
of Brighton, believes that the breeding of
Bordeaux squabs for the table may be found
a suitable occupation for the man who can’t
plough or feed pigs—particularly in a coun-
try which will shortly be obliged to find a
substitute for mutton-chops and corned beef.

. “F.N.T.” One of Victoria’s large sawmill-
ing concerns is now busy turning timber into
explosives. At its mills refuse is charcoaled
and the pyroligneous-acid content of the
eucalyptus-parings is condensed into a
liquid. Thence are separated a number of
by-products, one of which is acetone, a con-
stituent of cordite. The works are wholly
Private Enterprise; yet. if ever there was
need for State exploitation of State
resources, this is an instance. It is a fine
thing for Australia to have a new industry,
but the logical sequence of events in tlie
establishment of such an enterprise should
include the planting of a young eucalypt
at the spot from which the old one was
taken an item which has never interested
any private forest-clearing co. Tom Living-
ston, M.L.A. for Gippsland South and Min-
ister for Mines and Forests, is presumably
so used to observing large, imposing, virgin
areas of giant gums in his own electorate
~a / . his mind fails to grasp the pos-
sibility of their ultimate exhaustion. Still,
Gippsland South itself contains a mvriad
object-lessons in the folly of tree-slaughter.
“D.F.”: What enormous stocks of Ger-
man goods some people must have bought
before the war, and what a fine advt. it is
to be able to offer them at specially low
prices because of their origin! A chemist
who does business in Collins-street Mel-
bourne, exhibits in his window this notice:
These enemy-made goods were bought before the
embargo, and will not be replaced by us. They are
now offered at specially-low rates to clear
* * * *
n 7? ne , least . of tll€ trade s affected by the
\V heat Scheme is on a good wicket this year
milling. Under the pooling scheme mill-
owner sub agents, who hold wheat in trust
for the Board, pay weekly for the wheat
they actually mill out of their trust stocks.
In ordinary years the miller lias to invest
a huge sum early in the season, often
enough to secure his year’s requirements.
This year he practically has only to invest
in a week’s supply. A vast difference look-
ing at the . matter from the financial aspect.
Uftset against this, of course, is the restricted
profit he is allowed to make owing to the
price of flour being fixed, and against that
is the absolute protection he has against
loss. He cannot take advantage of market
changes and soaring demands, and honorable
understandings are, of course, out of the
question ; but there should have been a fine
lot of millers’ free money to invest in the
war loans. Was there?
THE COUNT OF NOSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A little trade dispute is on,
And Michael Callaghan proposes
The thing be settled pro or con
By virtue of a count of noses.
’Tis done, and Mr. Mike McFay
By just one vote has got his way.
Now Minsky rises to explain:
“Dot cound of noses ain’t nod true—
I tink ve cound him vonce again,
Und giff to effery man his due.
McFay cound von. Dot’s onjust, see,
Because you cound but von to me!”
“And why not?” cries the angry Chair.
“That’s one to each. It’s right and just.”
Poor Minsky ruffles up his hair,
And stares at them in sheer disgust.
“Vy not!” he thunders. “Holy Moses!
Say, vill you shust gompare dose noses?”

A GIRL’S COMPLEXION.
Very few girls get through their ’teens
without eruptions or pimples showing on
their faces.
These may be due to indigestion resulting
from improper diet. If so they will quickly
disappear when the proper food is adhered
to. If they are accompanied by pallor and
listlessness you must look to the condition
of the blood.
Because these eruptions on the faces of
schoolgirls are so common they seldom
receive the attention from parents that
they require. When they indicate thin blood
or anaemia there is a ready remedy in Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. These tonic pills, free
from harmful drugs, are pretty sure to help
growing girls because they build up the blood
at a time when the demand on it is great-
est. As the blood is made rich and red*
fickle appetites become normal, lassitude
gives way to vigor, the cheeks and lips show
the glow of health, and the whole system
is toned up. The nervous system is invigor-
ated, and with proper attention to diet many
dangers are averted.
Your own dealer sells Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, or they will be sent post paid, on re-
ceipt of price, 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes

Blood,” free on request.—Advt.
HOW TO AVOID SICK HEADACHE.
Many people suffer at regular intervals
from sick headache. Generally they can tell
hours in advance when an attack is coming
on. The trouble is caused by accumulation
ot poison in the digestive organs, and when
a certain point is reached this poison pro-
duces nausea and the attack follows.
If sufferers would take a dose of Pinkettes,
the new laxative, at intervals these distress-
ing attacks may be avoided. Pinkettes are
dainty little, sugar-coated ovals that arouse
no feeling of repulsion, and they act so gently
that they are the ideal laxative to use in cor-
recting a tendency to sick headache. They
have no unpleasant effect to make them ob-
jectionable to the extra-sensitive sick head-
ache patient. Old-fashioned harsh purgatives
will not do at all in such cases. If you would
like to try them send for a free sample to
the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney,
mentioning that you read of them in The
Bulletin. Sold everywhere, Is. per bottle.

POLITICAL
POINTS
LIGHTS O’ LONDON.
LITTLE BILLY: “I had no idea I teas so big.”
Pleas for a piebald Australia are again
very frequent in Melbourne, where the Com-
monwealth Parliament meets. Regarding
the agricultural development of the Northern
Territory the Argus denounces as “cow-
ardly” the attitude of those who would “leave
the problem to future generations.” The
Argus proposes, as an alternative to putting
the burden on posterity, that we should “re-
adjust our ideas as to the kind of labor to be
introduced.” That goes beyond cowardice—
it amounts to kneeling down and putting up
our throat to be cut.
A firm of contractors tried the Tas. Gov-
ernment with the Norton Griffiths bait the
other week; but, even if Earle was that
sort, it was too near a general election.
Evidently they knew they had missed a
good thing, because at once they talked of
an action to recover £15,000 for “breach of
contract.” Where the Tas. speculators-
made the mistake was in relying on a con-
tract. They should try little bridge parties
next time.
Alost of the Alaoriland newspapers are
politely discussing the great national cadge,
which receives editorial- benediction only
through columns sacred to the cause of Fat.
It is a very barefaced cadge even in a
country where the trail towards Cohen was
blazed by such sturdy pioneers as Vogel,
Seddon and Ward. Alaoriland is not find-
ing a solitary copper for war. Every
month the dreadful Cold Hash Government
touches harassed John Bull for half a
million. Incidentally the, inhabitants are
gathering in large quantities of cash from
John for wool and butter and meat, but they
are carefully stowing that lot away, in case,
apparently, something goes wrong at the
Front.
Professor Allen, quarantine director
Cumpston, and Jeffreys AVood, the children’s
specialist—the committee of three medical
men appointed by the Federal Administra-
tion, with Alathews, M.H.R., as chairman, to
inquire into the causes of morbidity and mor-
tality in this country—have handed a pre-
liminary report to the Alinister for Customs.
Figures show that the death-rate for Alel-
bourne city is more than one-half greater
than that of Alalvern ; and “it is hoped that
when an explanation of these differences is
arrived at, a remedy will suggest itself.” The
explanation seems simple enough. Alalvern
lives a more spacious life and has less dust
with its meals. And the remedy lies in wider
land settlement and less of the cursed conges-
tion policy.
Ex-Treasurer Wad-
dell wailed the other
night in the N.S.W.
Assembly over the
horror of a proposal
to make citizenship
the basis for a muni-
cipal vote instead of
allowing the vote to
rest on the old-estab-
lished basis of Prop-
puty. The essence
of his howl was that
it was proposed to
give non - property
owners the right to
tax a landowner up
to the hilt, though
his land might, be
heavily mortgaged.
Yet Parliament has
much more authority
over Propputy than
a municipal or shire
council. It could, if
it felt that way,
raise all the State
revenue from taxa-
tion of land, and
order that estates be
cut into pieces and
offered for sale.
Bumble cannot do
anything half as
hideous as that.
Why, then, doesn’t
Waddell demand a
Propputy franchise
for the Assembly? Or
does he suggest that
a citizen of Sydney
who happens to be
without land is less
interested in the
health and sani-
tation of the city than the corpulent owner
of 75 slum cottages?
The Westralian Industries Assistance
Board, called into being to help the dis-
tressed cocky (was there ever a cocky that
wasn’t?) has at least helped its protege to
a hoivl of rage from one end of the State to
the other. The Board means well, but it
squats in an office in Perth and there tiles
to deal with an avalanche of appeals from
Westralian Cockydom. The result is that
the struggling farmer (all farmers struggle)
who sends an urgent wire for a plough gets
—if anything at all —a reaper and binder
which he may need, if God is good, six months
hence. At a big and carefully-engineered
meeting in the Perth Town Hall, some of
the genuine grass-seeds were brought down
to recite their tales of woe. Underwood,
M.L.A., who was temporarily in command of
the Board, was present, and interrupted
Cocky with ribald comments. The Westra-
lian farmer was so infuriated that the tact-
ful Johnson, on his return from Melbourne,
promptly gave the Honorary Minister another
job, and now makes the administration of
the Industries Assistance Act his own special
funeral.
A lot of people never quite realised the
horrors of war till they got their income-tax
assessments last week.
“I do not consider that 9s. a day is suffi-
cient for a man to keep his wife and family
on,” Iloyle, N.S.W. Minister for Railways,
announced last week. Well, what is Air.
Iloyle going to do? Is he going to suggest
to them that they buck in and earn more?
He was talking to a section of railway
employees at the time; and the best proof
that railway employees, as a whole, get all
that they earn at present and a bit over is
that the Department is working at a loss.
It looks as though at last the N. S. AVales
railways are to have, if not coal-mines of
their own, at any rate State mines from
which to draw their supplies. AVade. of
course, made a preliminary snap at the Bill
when it was brought in; but that was the
sort jof thing the party-Government farce
requires. The inter-State shipping cos. don’t
need half the coal that the railways do; yet
one after the other they have found it good
business to either make or buy a mine. That
circumstance ought to end the argument.
At the entrance to Currie Harbor on King
Island (Tas.) is the Kelp Rock, which acts
as a sort of breakwater. In 191 U the Tas-
manian AAMrks Department got the bright
idea that it would improve the port to
remove the rock and let the sea in more
freely. So it put a couple of years on the
job and spent £l9OO of loan money. Then
it was decided that the rock was much better
where it was; but as the top had been sawn
off, a beacon must now be put on what is
left of it, and £4300 is to be spent in this
and other “improvements.” But there is
this consolation for the kid who will have
to pay the bill —it would have cost more
than £4OOO, apart from the £l9OO, to shift
the whole of the Kelp Rock, and then there
would have been the job of putting it all
back again.
AT THE PATRIOTIC CARNIVAL.
YOUNG MAN ( conducting raffle): “Here you
arc, lads —a chance to win a stove for
sixpence!”
RRTURNED SOLDIER: “Have a ticket in it
yourself, sonny. It'll come in handy to
warm your feet.”
The renewed uproar about the oversea
Dominions “having a voice in Empire
defence” recalls the last voice that was
raised on the subject. The noise was the
property of lou Ward, Maoriland’s noblest
spender, who, at the Imperial Defence Con-
ference five years ago, sprang in with a
scheme for immediately slicing up
£270,000.000 (borrowed on a joint p.n.) on
00 additional Dreadnoughts. Ward reck-
oned that this would show the universe that
the Empire was determined to stand shoulder
to shoulder. When someone asked for de-
tails, Ward remarked that it was not a time
for recrimination, whereupon there was sub-
dued applause and Ward went back to
Maoriland—to be thrown out of his job at a
general election, as it may do Billy Hughes
some good to remember.

THE FINANCIAL GENIUS: “ Ooray , Bill! I’ve
got it! Let’s start a pub of our own.”
Here’s a pretty mess that our multiplicity
of Governments is likely to laud us in.
Pearce says the early closing of hotels and
clubs is necessary for military, efficiency.
Premier Holman says the people must (Wide
the hour of turning off the taps. Now,
then, supposing the N.S.AV. referendum re-
turns a verdict of 11 p.m., what does Pearce
do? Does he propose to let military effi-
ciency go overboard or does he turn the
people’s vote down?
S. Aus. is wondering who its new Rail-
way Commissioner is to be; an appointment
has to be made within the next month or
two. The State’s service—outside perhaps
the Schools —has suffered for years from
the reign of old men. As a rule nobody gets
to the top of the ladder in S. Aus. until he
is about to fall off from old age; and in
the year or two that he lasts he mostly
doesn’t think it worth while doing anything
radical or of much consequence. According
to present appearances the common rule is
to be applied to this railway job; and, if it
is. it will be one more inducement for the
young man of brains to go out of the S. Aus.
service if he has made a mistake in his
youth and gone in.
The war so far having been conducted on
comfortable lines for our side, Australia has
gone on methodically importing stamp-paper.
Now a shortage is in sight, and the general
public is urged to economise by not gumming
two penny stamps where one tuppenny will
do. Heaven only knows what Australia would
have done if Von Tirpitz had got out.
Really all the Freetraders and Low-tariffers
of Australia ought to combine to build him
a statue. A hungry, partly unclothed and
wholly annoyed Australia would probably
have hanged Billy Hughes and the rest of
the old' Freetraders had the old chap suc-
ceeded in stopping those imports which we
can’t do without owing to the past sins of
the no-tariffists and the low-tariffists.
One of the arguments against the referen-
dum is that a Bill receives much more criti-
cal attention from Parliament than the popu-
lace could possibly give it —that Parliament
votes after mature deliberation, while the
public would vote blindly without under-
standing. The N.S.W. Assembly showed the
force of all this the other night when the
Bakeries Bill, giving authority for setting
up a State monopoly, was submitted. Every-
body at once went to sleep while the Attor-
ney-General explained the measure. Then
he went to sleep himself, and the Sergeant-
at-Arms woke someone who made a few re-
marks, and at the finish roused the loudest
snorer to carry on the debate. So the dreary
farce went on to a ludicrous end. When a
vote was taken one man who intended to say
“No” tvas sleepily nodding his head, so they
put him down with the “Ayes,” and he had
to explain the matter the next day.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Malster, as a sire, galloped by deputy into
the limelight again at Warwick Farm on Saturday.
The old horse has been responsible for hundreds of
winners, but lately his family had been slow in
finding the winning post. This time four of them
won successive races and gave their father a big
boost for the yearling sales. The winners were Tin-
tometer, Alcomet, Maltasia and Hopoast. Alcomet
landed the big race and incidentally won £5OOO for
the lucky person who drew him in Tatt.’s sweep.
Maltasia is the property of Humphrey Oxenham.
Hopoast is owned by Mrs. Flemmich, a Queensland
station-owner who also races Cagou. As a year-
ling Hopoast cost 800 gs. Two years ago he
won a race in Brisbane, but since then had pursued
the bacon in vain. The other Malster two-year-old,
Tintometer, promises well. He is a good finisher and
ran second to Maori Mat in the Caulfield Debutante
Stakes.
* * * *
Two nags which have a hard contract on
hand if they want to be as respectable as their
mothers ran well forward at Warwick Farm (Sydney)
on Saturday. Golden Shoe, second in the two-year-
old event, is by Wallace from the famous Golden
Slipper, for whom 4500 guineas was once paid.
Maltasia, winner of the Farm Stakes, is by Malster
from Acrasia, heroine of the Melbourne Cup of 11
years ago.
* * * *
The A.J.C. lias decided to split the two
principal two-year-old races between the sexes,
making the Breeders’ Plate eligible to colts only
and the Gimcrack Stakes to fillies. A good move.
During the last couple of years each event has
attracted about 30 starters, the result being to make
luck an important factor in the flutter. It is
thought by some people that this limitation will
discount the value of young stock. But it won’t
discount the value of young stock that can win or
go near it.
* * * *
Victorian nags are coming across the
Murray in droves in pursuit of the cash hung up by
the A.J.C. Usually at this time of the year horses
from Peacock’s territory transpire in much smaller
numbers. Prospect of further axe work on the
stakes may be the explanation of the raid.
At the Mudgee (N.S.W.) Show meeting
Tehama, winner of the Trial Handicap, six furlongs,
was ridden by her owner and trainer, Tommy
Donoghue. Donoghue must be about the most ancient
horse-pilot in the world. He is 58, and the vigorous
style in which he kicked his prad round the course
earned him an encore in addition to the stake money.
“Barcoo”: After the par. appeared about
Jimmy Rodgers’s 70 placed mounts in North and
Central Bar.analand for the five months of the year
(in the last month of ’l5 the total was swollen to
90-odd), James was engaged as rider for one of the
big racing stables in M.L. Nearly 20 years ago the
game people secured Mark Ryan from the same
address. Mark was then a successful horseman in
N.Q., but not fashionable on metropolitan courses,
mainly, perhaps, because owners were prejudiced in
favor of riders with two eyes. Mark had only one.
But it was a good ’un, and over in the Trembling
Isles he was at the top of the tree for 12 years.
Rodgers is a capable, resolute horseman, and should
do as well.
* * * *
“Mujik”: Successes in Australia Dy im-
ported horses and the progeny of other nags from
oversea are not going to send up the price of Aus-
tralian-bred yearlings which have omitted to get an
imported strain in their pedigree. The really Aus-
tralian gee looks like becoming a commoner, and
Australian sports are getting into a habit of bidding
in England. Explanations range from vague allega-
tions about the absence of certain unspecified salts
from Australian grass to the assumption that the
blood in the English thoroughbred always runs out
in another country after a few generations. Also, it
is held by many that the speediest prads born in
Australia are destroyed for stud purposes by too much
racing. This last charge comes only third in order
of preference. If Australian breeders want to get at
the chief reasons for the imported nag doing so well
they ought to consider first the horsemastership of
Australia, and secondly the mania for breeding to
proved speed instead of to blood. Most Australian
trainers are only entitled to the name in the way
that a barber is entitled to label himself professor.
Their qualifications for training horses are mostly
that (1) they were able to ride in childhood ; (2)
they can still clean out loose-boxes, and otherwise are
attentive valets. This is all wrong, and the proof of
it is in the performances of horses and the number
that go wrong. Breeding wholly to stallions and
mares that have been galloped for years is just as
bad. Vitality is what is wanted in breeding, and the
vitality of a sucessful racing mare or stallion has in
almost every case been left on the track. Take Car-
bine as a racehorse and a stallion. Then consider
his sire and dam, Musket and Locket. The same
story _ runs right through the history of Australian
breeding, with the exception of two or three animals
of the same remarkable stamina as Old Jack.
* * * *
“Homo”: How is this for mixed luck?
A Westralian came on a visit to his brother in Vic.
and, just for old time’s sake, they had a combined
shot in Tatt.’s. The net result was some £2OOO odd
between them. They reinvested some of it in the
big gamble, and a little later pulled out £5OO each.
The day the Westralian received his second pot he
came home in the pink of health ; but that night he
was seized with an illness which killed him a few
days later. When he was laid in his grave Tatt.’s
big cheque still lay in the house, unbanked. Still
perhaps all this isn’t so very remarkable; if I kept
on winning money in Tatt.’s I know it would kill
me, too.
A lively dividend came to hand at a meet-
ing at Johannesburg recently when an unknown nag
named Everil unexpectedly bolted with a race. The
tote, a 10s. one, was, as usual, in two sec-
tions, the inside machine being for white sports
and the outside one for the black, brown and pie-
bald fraternity. Both machines, of course, are
coupled and pay the same dividend. When Everil
won it was found that one lone ticket, held by a
grinning Kaffir, had been taken but. Before the
amount of the div. was declared many sports rushed
the native with offers as high as £2OO for his winnings,
but the black clung to the pasteboard till he was
handed £357 6s. Has anyone ever heard of Noses
McShortodds even offering 7llf to 1 about the rankest
outsider ?
*/* * *
“Musketoon” : At Forbes (N.S.W.) races
the other day jockey Alick Higgins told of a queer
happening. While he was riding Panda in the
Orange Cup the mare fell, broke her shoulder, and
had to be destroyed. The same day at Grafton
(N.S.W.) his brother’s mount in the principal race
also fell, broke a shoulder, and had to be shot. And,
to keep the series of coincidences going, both jocks
escaped injury.
* -*..** * *
“Jobber”: Included in the programme of
the Gezireh Sporting Club’s races (Cairo) is an
event for horses owned and ridden by British
soldiers, and there’s generally a fair sprinkling of
our bloques on top. At one meeting when the horses
hopped out of the barrier none of the riders noticed
that the flag went up for a false start. They
battled it up the straight and fought out a good
finish, but it was declared no race, all bets to stand.
The “books” are Australian soldiers, with their
tickets printed, and working on the dead-level. Some
of them do a bit, too, in the leger, with crown and
anchor, spinning-jenny, etc. They’re hard-doers,
these bloques of ours.

“Norbell”: Fibelly, Bauaualand’s Acting
Minister for Justice, has been tapping the corpulent
bag of the Q.T.C. In August last the Government
started to annex all totalisator fractions and un-
claimed dividends, with the Result that for the six
months up to February 29 the Treasury received
£l4BB from fractions and £847 in respect of
unclaimed divs. Whereupon Fihelly slapped his chest
and remarked that it was only a fair thing. For-
merly the clubs even retained the fractions of a shill-
ing, but now they shell out everything to investors
except the fractions of copper, and that goes to the
State. Ikey’s troubles about fractions. He just
takes all he can.

Les Darcy met Les O’Donnell at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday. The heavyweight had, of
course, considerable advantage in tonnage, height
and reach, and he wanted them all for self-protec-
tion. Darcy gave him a torrid time in all but the
fifth round, when O’Donnell delivered himself with
force and speed on the opposing jaw. In the seventh
he was badly used up and the towel arrived at a
merciful moment. Darcy’s next engagement is a
second conflict with the Greek-American Brown, who
always enters the ring determined to knockemsteef,
but generally hasn’t been doing it.
HUGH THUMBLE,
Secretary M.C.C.
“Trot”: The whereabouts of the world’s
middleweight championship seems likely to quickly
become more mysterious than ever. Jeff Smith used
to masquerade as the holder, and was about as much
entitled to it as Bill Squires. When he went back to
America the worn-out George Chip made an exhibi-
tion of him until losing on a foul. Ahearn was re-
garded as the champion of England, and a week or
so ago Mike Gibbons settled him in one hit and
looked about the biggest thing in the game. Now
Jeff Smith comes along and outpoints Mike. This,
of course, shoves Jeff up a long way. Perhaps he
can beat Gibbons again. In that ease he would be
taken in America as the absolute topnotcher, particu-
larly as the records allow him a win over Darcy (the
one he got when Dave Smith threw the towel in at
Sydney Stadium during the first fight, in which
Smith fouled the Maitlander). It would be no use
anyone claiming the championship for Darcy, though
as a matter of fact his moral right to it would be
undoubted, since there can be no question at all about
him Being Smith’s master. McGoorty, too, could
wallop Jeff; so, too, could Jimmy Clabby, and per-
haps Fritz Holland. If Darcy is a wise youth he
will promptly interview Messrs. Gibbons and Smith.
If he doesn’t hurry that championship will never be
his. He will be no lighter directly. If he acquires
it, the subsequent arguments could proceed in Aus-
tralia, where the disturbances are nowadays—well,
nothing to make a noise about.
* * * *
“Swish”: “Smelling Salts” says (B.
23/3/’l6) that it is “the easiest thing in the world
for a man’s chief second to take a bribe from the
other side and throw in the towel,” and affirms that
‘the proper person to announce his desire to quit is
the boxer himself” when he has “had enough.” There
are some men who never know when they have had
enough—men in whom the combative instinct is so
powerfully developed that they would keep on bat-
tling to the hitter end and be cut to ribbons before
voluntarily quitting. Does “Smelling Salts” want
to 101 l back on the front seat and watch a brave
man pounded to pieces because he refuses to run
away ? _ Anyhow, in nine cases out of 10 a beaten
boxer is incapable of expressing his conviction that
the battle ought to end; right crosses to the jaw
transpire with great velocity, and his wits have
usually vanished; he doesn’t know what is happening
And few winning boxers like to give the final clout
in cold blood. More than once I have seen Fritz
Holland and McGoorty drop their hands opposite a
reeling opponent and look to the Law to hold up its
walking-stick. If “Smelling Salts” thinks it easy to
make money by acting as a second and taking bribes
he ought to get into the business and prematurely
fling in the wipe for, say, Darcy or Red Watson or
McGoorty. There might be cash in it, but there
would be a lot to happen to “Smelling Salts” before
he reached his dividend.
* * * *
“Cleido”: What’s “Sardonyx” (B.
16/3/’l6) giving us when he asserts that no boxer
to-day could have laid a glove on Peter Jackson and
Griffo in their respective classes. If he seriously
believes that Jack Johnson, for instance, at his best,
could not have stood up to any man that ever lived,
don’t let me detain him any further. Any specialist
will attend to his trouble.
* * * *
Those Yanks who were breaking into
loud, hoarse laughs at Jesse Willard as a humorous
circumstance were amused too soon. Their next
job is to bring someone along to beat him, for just
at present the prolonged cowboy has a real solid
claim to respect and the world’s championship. To
annihilate the adipose Mass’ Johnson was perhaps
not much of a feat, though there are few, if any, of
the loud talkers in the game who even now would
try to repeat it, but it lifted Willard into the lime-
light, and the walloping he gave Frank Moran last
week-end at New York suggests that the job of
shifting him is going to call for great exertion.
Moran was about the best of the possible contenders
for the title, and unless the cable is a liar he was
a lucky pug to be on his feet at the end of the
tenth round. On this performance it looks as if
Willard is in danger of remaining-champion until he
perishes from senile decay or highball. He can
now proceed to earn about 10 times more cash every
week by imitation biff than a grateful nation pays
President AVilson for writing notes.

Arthur Mailey, of Balmain (Sydney), has
been getting a heap of wickets this season. In the
just-ended round (v. North Sydney) this “bosey”
bowler reaped 14 wickets for 96 runs (nine clean
bowled). Mailey’s tally for the season now stands
at 90, and as there is only another round on the
slate, a special effort should push him over the cen-
tury mark and put new records jup.
Dunedin (M.L.) reckons it has found an
all-round cricketer. His name is Gasey. In a recent
first-grade match with Albion, Crawford, formerly of
Adelaide, managed to accumulate 49, but the rest of
the team made only 34, Casey collecting seven
wickets for 39. He finished with the hat-trick, and
thep asking for a bat helped himself to 61 runs,
exactly half of the score made by his own side. A
bowler by the name o’ Casey coming from Whusky-
ville would be a cheerful circumstance. But has
there ever been a cricketer with a moniker like that?
Auckland (M.L.) has produced a kid
named Dacre who looks like being able to do some-
thing. He showed up so well in school cricket last
year that he was given a chance in a first-grade
team, and at once became beastly rude to the local
bowling. During the 1914 and 1916 seasons he has
only twice failed to score, and among his efforts
are 196 n. 0., 188, IT2, 143, 140 n.o. (twice), 139
n. 0., 114 n. 0., 108 n. 0., 107 n.o. (twice), and so on.
In two years he has made 37 journeys to the wicket,
has been 10 times not out, has banged himself past
the century 12 times, and has accumulated 2372
runs, an average of 87.8.
* * * *
“Sarto”: Someone wants to know (B.
23/3/T6) why the umpire always stands to the leg
side of the batting man. The only explanation is
that on the other side he would be in point’s road or
point would be in his. Also, the bat would obstruct
his view of the facts when a stumped decision was
called for. Fieldsmen on the leg side do not usually
hover round the umpire like they would have to do
on the opposite side. Still, it seems immaterial where
a lot of umpires stand.

There is now only one survivor of the
pioneer, team of English cricketers that came to Aus-
tralia in 1861 —old Bill Caffyn, who has just had
his 88th birthday. Bill lives at Reigate, near
London, where he is proprietor of a barber’s shop.
A .number of Australian soldiers are quartered at
Reigate, and the old man’s great delight is in chat-
ting with them about their country. He did not
return to England with the rest of the ’6l team, but
remained for some years as coach to Melbourne and
Sydney cricket clubs. “I taught Spofforth, Murdoch
and others all I knew,” says old Caffyn, wherefore
he reckons himself the “father of Australian cricket.”
A dozen years ago he published his autobiography
under the title of “Seventy-Eight, Not Out.”

“X.Y.Z.”: A prize was on offer for the
best bowling average in an inter-State match. Gar-
rett and Evans bowled unchanged throughout the
game. (< First innings, Evans 4 for 51, Garrett 5 for
65. One up for me,” said Evans. Second innings,
Evans 4 for 22, Garrett 6 for 34. “Two up,” said
Evans, and went to collect. “Hold on,” called
Garrett. ‘That prize is? jnine.” And lit was, too
Averages, Garrett 9, Evans 9.1. The winner on
each innings had lost on the two.

W. H. Calvert, a Tasmanian country
cricketer, who plays a game occasionally when he
can spare time from running a big orchard, has a
fancy for collecting centuries and has put 23 of
them together. His best effort was 184 not out, but
he generally gets tired and retires after going a
little way past the 100. s s

Teams representing Vic. and South Aus.
soldiers lately played a football match according to
Australian Rules in London. Vic. won by six goals
to four. The Times describes it as “a curious mix-
ture of Rugby and Association.” While the game is
“informal and rather scrambling” it is “undeniably
fast and entertaining as a spectacle.” Also, it is
“companionable, each man being marked and shep-
herded about the field by an enemy, so that both
teams seem to be strolling in friendly couples ” Keen
enough from the start, the play became “almost fren-
zied in the final quarter.” But the Australians
taught The Times something more than a new game:
the vast majority of the spectators were Australians
and Maoriland soldiers who “yelled for ‘Vic ’ or
‘South,’ and gave advice to individual players with a
vigor and freedom quite unusual on British football
nelds.
* * * *
The people who are ruuning football in the
Speck don’t know where they are. The three senior
clubs at Hobart decided against playing the usual
piemierslup roster this season, and it was suggested
that school matches should take the place of the ordi-
nary premiership round. But at the annual meeting of
the League a motion in favor of the abandonment of
premiership matches was defeated, and it was left
to the committee to say whether they should be
played or not. The committee is pretty certain to
try to run a season if it can, so clubs may be called
on to play for the premiership when they have
unanimously decided that they don’t want to and
when the greatest honor belongs to the crowd that
has most of its members away.

Bill Corbett, champion swimmer of N s
Wales 25 years ago, remarked the other dav tw
30 seconds for 50 yards in the water was looked
upon as something to whoop over in his time The
statement was provoked by the speed shown'bv the
kids at a recent schools’ gala. A 13-year-old lad
named Minahan, of North Sydney, covered the His
ance in 30 3-ssec., and the same afternoon he trav
riled 100 yards. in lmin. 121 sec. Schools around
Sydney are teeming with bronzed youngsters capable
of fast times. They all adopt the crawl stroke the
origin of which has been the cause of much heated
argument among adherents of the Cavills, Healy and
Wickham. The king of the kids is Crakanthorp, of
Fort-street, who has landed fully a dozen champion-
ship pots this season. He added a couple to the list
on Saturday, dashing over 100 yards in lmin
6 4-ssec.

“Pick”: “Lance Private” (B. 16/3/’IG)
has evidently never heard of the Quetta wreck, or he
would not claim the 27 hours’ swim of Captain
Gregory off the W.A. coast as a record. When the
Quetta bounced on an uncharted coral reef off East-
ern Queensland some years ago a 16-year-old girl
went overboard. She swam to a floating spar, but it
became waterlogged by the weight of two lascars.
The girl then swam away and continued until she was
sighted from a passing steamer and rescued 36 hours
after the catastrophe. Leaving out of account Cap-
tain Webb’s 60 hours’ swim, done in 1879, in an
artificially-heated tank in London, the Quetta mer-
maiden easily holds the record for authenticated
swims.

“Moana”: Apropos the £7750 (B.
24/2/’l6) bagged by D. Resta at the game of whiz-
zing round the motor-racing tracks of U.S.A. That
represents what he won in prize-money, but it is
only a small part of his earnings at the hair-raising
business. Added to this there are appearance money,
a retaining fee, a salary and frequent bonuses.
Altogether Resta collected over £30,000 during last

“Sarto” : Ever attend a bush sports meet-
ing ? I did the other day and learnt something. I
forget how high they tossed the sheaf—4oft. or
400yds., or something. Anyhow, they expect it to
come down about next Thursday. In the ladies’
stepping, 50yds., the winner stepped the distance
exactly. This is how she-did it. She surreptitiously
hobbled herself about the knees with a piece of string
measured to allow her to step the exact yard. 1
know because—well, never mind. In the tug-of-war
the woodcarters pulled themselves into the final. So
did the tomato-pickers. When the teams lined up
the woodcarters were a man short. They asked for
a substitute, and started to explain that the missing
carter was “crook” ; whereupon the captain upended
himself and said, “What’s the good of telling lies
over it—he’s gone on the shicker. Will you give us
another man in his place?” As shicker was a thing
that might reasonably happen to any of them, being
bushmen and Australians they said “Righto.” But
it availed the carters nothing. They had borrowed
a surplus tomato-picker.

“Jwosp”: A returned soldier, who was
sent there to convalesce, has given Rotorua a boost.
One day when he was out of a job someone told him
about angling and trout. He bought a rod and paid
money for something that looked like a bent pin and
a piece of a feather. Then he proceeded to the
stream and hauled out 65 speckled specimens. This
basket is claimed to be a record for one rod.

Four red deer have been presented by
George Chirnside, of Werribee Park (Vic.), to the
Rotorua (M.L.) Rod and Gun Club. The animals
reached Sydney from Melbourne by steamer last week
and were sent on to Auckland. It is expected that
this infusion of new blood will assist in improving
the herds wherever the strangers are liberated.

As a result of the war foot-running'
is at a low ebb in Tas. At the St. Patrick’s
Day Sports at Hobart the committee had to cut out
the Sheffield and the Maiden Handicaps because there
was nobody to run in them. As the geegees haven t
gone to the Front the committee filled the hole m
the programme by shoving in more trotting races.

At an amateur sports meeting held at
Sydney on Saturday under championship conditions
(“titles” were off the menu), H. O. Hodgson heai e(
the javelin 141 ft. 4in., which is 2ft. 24in. bette

rest of the proceedings were not exciting. *
instance, W. J. Potter won the high jump with a

“Row A”: Pity the poor chorus-gent in
these explosive days! Lots of other men are
engaged on work that is almost as useless ;
but they haven’t got to do it in full view of
the public and in time to music. Before light
opera -became featherweight farce stage
“business” wasn’t so flagrantly foolish and
unworthy of a grown man —and there were
musical compensations in the scores. The
chorus gent then was generally a brigand or
a smuggler, and when he encountered his >
sisters of the chorus he merely had to put an
arm round some girl’s waist and conduct
himself in a more or less sane fashion. Now-
adays when the jigging music starts he has
to waggle his head or nod it, or hop and hold
his hands in a begging-puppydog attitude, or
shuffle in sideways at arm’s-length as one of
a line. Generally speaking, he is a walking-
stick for the show girl in the show dress, and
forced to do things that would be a degrada-
tion for a small boy. From this side of the
footlights I would say that he was acutely
conscious of the humiliations he is subjected
to.
“Te Babarantiko”: The most remarkable
piece of balancing I ever saw was superin-
tended by a handsome Abrahamic juggler
in Pagoda-road, Rangoon. The patriarch
placed three empty beer bottles, one on top
of the other, on a smooth spot on the road.
Then he spoke to a goat —an ordinary-look-
ing grey-and-black William with a nice
beard and a Methodist smile. Promptly Wil-
liam leaped into the air and landed with
hoofs bunched together on the neck of the
topmost bottle, without visibly disturbing
the pyramid. There he stood with the same
benign smile on his face, till, at a sign from
the juggler, he hopped to the ground, leaving
the bottles standing as before. And here’s a
delicate trick I was shown on a ship’s deck
at Penang. The juggler’s boy, a graceful
slip of burnished brown, poured two small
heaps of sand about two inches apart on a
deck plank. Into the apex of each heap he
stuck'a safety match; then, flinging his legs
aloft he walked on his hands up to the
heaps of sand, daintily picked up the
matches, one between each set of eyelids,
dropped on his feet, and after a moment let
the matches fall into his hand.
All actors don’t gather at Poverty Point.
Will Whitburn, who drove First Trip to vic-
tory in the Melbourne Derby Thousand for
trotters the other day, is the man who used
to black his face and sing comic songs at the
Tivoli. Whitburn has always taken delight
in steering trotters and has had a lot of
success at the business.
“First Old Man”: In the home of the
“movies,” which is Los Angeles, Cal., a bene-
fit performance for the British Red Cross
was recently got up by English actor Beer-
bohm Tree, who is touring the United states.
The piece of the occasion was Tree’s own
version of “Oliver Twist,” frequently his
starring vehicle —although his part is Fagin
—in London. In the cast was Charlie
Chaplin, who played the Artful Dodger.
Preliminary pars, ran like this: “Charlie
Chaplin will appear as the Artful Dodger,
supported bjjSijs Beerbohm Tree.”
From London: Australian dramatist
Arthur Adams lias no reason to complain of
any lack of energy or resource on the part
of Bourchier or his press agentUm the matter
of advance booming of the London produc-
tion of “Mrs. Pretty and the Premier.”
Bourchier has taken the unusual course of
publishing a “foreword” to the
makes it a defence against some criticism.
For instance :
Some of those who have seen the play have taken
exception to the curiously free and easy and familiar
style in which the man in the street addresses his
Premier and the members of the Cabinet, but so far
from this being untrue to life it is literally a tran-
script from the actual. I was defending myself the
other night at a dinner party on this very question,
when quite unexpectedly a stranger to me
came to the rescue. “Oh,” he said, “Mr. Bourchier
is quite right. People would call his Premier ‘Bill’ in
Australia, and why not? They had all been familiar
with him in earlier days ; why should political rank
bar him off them in such a real democracy as Aus-
tralia?”
Bourchier is also anxious that London play-
goers should bear in mind that “Mrs. Pretty,
like all women in Australia, has a vote,
which explains why female suffrage plays
such an important part in the piece.” The
lady is played by Miss Kyrle Bellew, and
Bourchier considers himself lucky in having
the advice and assistance of Norman Page,
just arrived from Australia, who is- seeing
to “all matters of local color, manners and
customs.”
Ola Jane Humphrey when last heard
from was at her old home in Los Angeles
visiting mother and chattering to interview-
ers. She still calls herself Princess Ilassan,
in spite of the fact that she declares she has
left her Turk forever. Hubby, who wanted
to push Ola into the back row of the harem
as one of the extra ladies instead of giving
her the leading r6le, as the actress expected
he would, is now a general in the Turkish
army guarding Constantinople. Ola says
she is going to wait until after the war
before pursuing him with divorce papers.
But perhaps the Russians will pursue him
first with cold steel. That w uld save a
lot of expense and be just as effective.
Here’s good news at last for men and women
whose hair is falling, who are growing bald and grey,
whose scalps are covered with dandruff that nothing
seems to keep away, and whose heads itch like mad.
Good news even for those who imagine themselves
hopelessly' and incurably bald, or who suffer from
hair or scalp trouble of any kind.
We have had granted to us the sole Australasian
rights for the great American discovery, Crystolis,
the new hair remedy that in America and Europe
has been called the most wonderful scalp discovery
of the century', having been awarded Gold Medals at
the Big Paris and Brussels Expositions.
Hundreds of men and women have written us to
tell of the phenomenal results obtained by its use.
People who have been bald for years tell how they
now glory in their beautiful hair. Others who have
had dandruff all their lives say they have now a
clean, healthy scalp, and that hair stopped falling
after a few applications of this wonderful new treat-
ment.
We don’t care whether y'ou are bothered with
falling hair, prematurely grey hair, matted hair,
brittle hair, or stringy hair ; dandruff, itching scalp,
or any or all forms of hair trouble. We want you
to try “CRYSTOLIS” at our risk.
We give you a binding guarantee without any
“strings” or red tape, that it wont cost you a cent
if we do not prove to you that “Crystolis” will do
all we claim for it, and, what's important, we have
plenty of money to back our guarantee. AVe have

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Awake! the fiddlestrings of morn
Are tuning for the song of day,
And stirring notes on fresh winds borne
Show Earth all ready for the play.
A murmur comes of vamping strings
And players waiting in the wings.
The sun smiles just above the sea —
A stage director, pleased, it seems;
A tramcar waits upon the lea ;
Afar a touring milkman screams;
And, sign that sleep from all should pass,
The dew is rising from the grass.
The stage is well and truly set,
The orchestra and players all
Are waiting; we may not forget
We must be ready for the call.
The play begins, for I can hear
Jones murmur: “Come, let’s find a beer!”

Merits your confidence, not merely because it
is the product of your compatriots and affords
constant and well-remunerated employment
to over 500 of your fellow Australians, but
because it offers to you many distinct advan-
tages which are unobtainable in any imported , „
player-piano.
THE BEALE PLAYER-PIANO is constructed on
quite unique principles, to designs born of over 30 years
practical experience of Australian musical requirements,
Australian climatic conditions, and a keen appreciation of
the fundamental limitations of the ordinary player-piano.
THE BEALE PLAYER-PIANO is the first player-piano
with the true human touch and expression —that inde-
finable something which unmistakably distinguishes the
unsympathetic, soulless brilliance of the ordinary mechanical
player-piano from the hand of the artist. Its extraordinary
controllability, simplicity, sensitiveness and delicacy of
operation compel the full expression of the personality and
musical taste of the operator.

unless stamps accompany.
M.B.J. i Story of making grave-clothes
has been done somewhat better by Wilkie Collins... .
Bill: That’s not your line, William. .. .Sage:
Not mentioned by correspondent.... Lance-Private:
Censored.... Cheetah: Every name of a place or a
person you send has to be laboriously cheeked. Fre-
quently they can’t be traced. Better block-letter
them.... Kata: All these yarns about Bendigo the
boxer are more or less vague and unsatisfactory. The
argument isn’t worth while, anyhow Navigi Six
weeks too late... .Morilla: Cheerless as sawdust....
G.M.: You won’t make much of verse until you
learn that “sides” doesn’t rhyme with “lives.”....
Vanda: You say:—-
Hills of verdant fair Australia, blue, cerulean is our
skies,
But when Billy goes aroaming, why should Billy then
tell lies ?
Ask us something easier... .W.H.P.I Glad you put
the musicians in among the silent crowd in the city
and let the poets but to graze with the women and
babies in- the forest....N.N.* Some merit, but not
up H.W.M.: “The Sacrifice” lacks force... .F.D.:
Yes, that’s all true; but you forgot to say that the
Labor party often crosses the park when it’s haunted
by the reeking ghosts of its unburied platform....
Nellie N.: Build up an alphabet of good Australian
curses and then apply the whole 26 to your own
insipid rhymes... .L.G.W.:' Verses rough ; you
haven’t got the trick.... J.G.: “Toe the Line” is very
bad verse with no hint of originality. We don’t
reprint... .A.C.W.: Sonnet well enough turned; but
very dull business. “Soldier’s Farewell” too slight.
... .M.A.: Violin melodrama misses... .T.M.W.:
Nearly... .J.H.8.: “The Hulk” too rough. Nose
yarn suggests an elephant trying to tell a humorous
push yarn to the Wesleyan Conference. .. .Tickets
Please: “Undercurrents” thin and conventional....
G.H.S.: “English as she is spoke in Germany”
doesn’t worry us like Australian as it is massacred
in Sydney... .P.J.C.: Good enough verse, but not
suitable... .V.F.K.: If you are really 16 and keep
on trying hard you might get there some day
J.D.: Fodder for the domestic buffalo... .E.P.H.:
Never knew a vegetable yet that would “whisper
you have for your country fell.” Even the cauli-
blossoms of our acquaintance have some regard for
their tenses... .E.G.H.: “Marching on Berlin” is
sorry stuff....O. Joy: “Mrs. Khayyam” is a dull
dame. “The Choice” is pretty anaemic tack....
L.W.: Not up. .. . J.R.: Sordid love affair if you have
to woo the girl with linoleum. .. .R.J.: Recruiting
appeals come in at the rate of six or eight a day....
The Prodigal: Something in it, but workmanship
clumsy.... 8.C.: Well written, but interest not sus-
tained... .E.C.P.: Poor little thing M.E.C.:
Nothing in them at all. Certainly ; send what you
like, but look out for reprisals H.E.: Dull ser-
mon on the relationship of infant curiosity to
obstetrics declined.. . .J.H.G.: The trouble about
your verse is that it doesn’t say anything. Even an
“Ode” ought to carry an idea somewhere among its
interjections... .P.G.0.: Phrases and ideas good ; but
verse loose and rough J.K.: You can’t master
any game without taking some trouble T. McG.:
Verse rotten; idea a poor, thin, little thing that no
decent sportsman would try to catch.... Delta: Now
read it through again and see if there is one heart-call-
ing line in it... .G.B. A.: Lazy verse. Small bards like
Milton and Keats took the trouble to find rhymes....
G.11.A.: Verse copied from another paper of no
interest. It isn’t even good verse... .A.S.: Sorry.
Verses commonplace D.W.; Dreary drunk....
R.N.C.: Bright idea; but couldn’t you knock some of
the jolts and jars out of it ?. ... Lestor: No ; they
miss. You might sell them somewhere else... .E.D.:
You don’t get much out of that undertaking yarn.
.... Westralian Swaddy: Can’t grasp your grievance.
If you can get a commission by competing in exami-
nation with these just-enlisted youngsters who don’t
know anything, why don’t you go ahead? It looks
easy Recovery: Only know the man who reported
on the mine, and he is quite trustworthy. But note
that he didn t say a word about the recoverv pro-
cess Flinderino: That" swim has been described
too often already.... Jobber: (1) Good news about
the nurses; (2) the Australian-names yarn was pub-
lished some time ago; (3) Good luck.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
D’A.L.M.: Poor little trifles. ... G. 8.: Why is the
wooden boy drawn larger than the wooden old man?
•... M.R.: Stop it!. .. .Miss C. J.: Sorry no value.
• ...E.J.; It will never be used here. .. . H.W.: You
are mistaken: the outrage does not interest us
C.W.H.: Interest too local and the treatment is ele-
mentary S.H.: The drawing is the worst end of it.
•■ ■ • Trant. Not so bad ; but why are you so generous
with legs? Are you a centipede?
“Homo”: Let me introduce the homesick
bushwoman. She had been brought in from
Old .Tunee to Wagga (N.S.W.) hospital to
be divorced from an attack of diphtheria.
For a few days she fretted in the ward, and
then in the early morning she wrapped a
blanket over her nightdress and stole away
for home. She had only 20 miles to walk,
and that was a mere detail.
“Chasuble”! Although the ugly old brown
stone Melbourne Cathedral of St. James
has been bodily shunted from the south-west
to the north-west of the city, it does not
succeed much better. Archbish Clarke sent
Archdeacon Hindley to England to engage
a missioner, who would transform St.
James’s and St. John’s into thriving gospel
warehouses; but the war hangs all this up.
The dismal St. John’s, Elizabeth-street
north, never has more than a handful of
people, but is buoyed up by immensely
valuable Elizabeth-street and other pro-
perty. The Collins-street Independent
Church leans heavily on its rents, and so
does St. Luke’s, South Melbourne, where
the Presbyterians turned a wretched little
tomb-like bethel into a new edifice by a
property deal in their Clarendon-street front-
ages. Trinity Church, East Melbourne, is
supported by the rent of mansions, and the
North Melbourne Wesleyans were low down
until they realised the brilliant idea of
building houses. The old Crown grants cut
the place up generously in a religious age
when all around was wilderness. Now the
only wilderness is inside the churches, and
there on the rents of mammon the droning
parson, calls the empty pews to repentance.
There is something wrong somewhere.


ARE YOU GOING TO BUY A SHEARING PLANT?
Have You Satisfied Yourself About Everything-
Construction, Simplicity, Power, Efficiency?
HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF THE UPKEEP?
Before \ou buy, ask some contractor what machine he considers the
mo»t economical on the market. Without hesitation he will say, “Cooper’s.”
COOPER MACHINES
are designed for
Good Work , Strength, Long
Life and Low Cost of
Upkeep.
The Master
Handpiece,
£2-2-0 each.
We have made a constant study of Shearing Machinery—
both from a practical and scientific standpoint—for more
than a quarter of a century, with the result that to-day
Cooper Shearing Machinery has an output of more than
all other makes combined.
THE BEST REASON in the world FOR BUYING THIS HACHINE
is what everyone THINKS and SAYS and KNOWS about it.
6 have found the cost of upkeep to he «5 per cent, less than other
makes.” (Signed) JE. AISBIRX & CO.
“You will see from my letter that 11,000 sheep were shorn before the
handpiece required a single duplicate." (Signed) F. FRIEND.
c o E. Ausburn & Co.
“The machines each shore 3000 sandy sheep in the Cobar district, and
we have not had to use 3 - worth of duplicates on the entire plant.”
(Signed) STRIDWIfKE, LAMRIX & CO.
“The light running of the machine saves me pounds in cost of
duplicates, and also saves the shearers from per cent, to 50 per cent, in
combs and cutters.” (Signed) A. WATSON. Tongreach.
“We have now finished 63,000 sheep. The machines cut well, never
get hot, and our forks never get out of level, or tension nuts work loose.”
Signed by 15 Shearers at Xariah Station, X.S.W.
For shearing heavy wethers and sandy sheep it is the most successful machine ever constructed. No sheep is too rough—no wool too heavy or
dirty for the Cooper Air-Cooled Handpiece; it shears all with ease. It runs cool and light, and holds the World’s Record for the number of
sheep shorn before requiring any duplicate parts. It is impossible for the fork to get out of level from wear in the tension pin or crown plate.
All undue friction has been eliminated. After a few seasons in use Cooper Machines have been found uitirersally to cost only a few shillings
annually for repairs or duplicates, where others cost pounds.
We have proved this to thousands of Woolgrowers. Let us prove it to you. Let us send you an estimate of a Shearing Plant to suit yout
requirements. If you have a plant we will supply you with this handpiece and make you an allowance for your old ones, t its any Overhead Gear.

THE STEWART HANDY WORKER
“AND TRULY IT IS WELL NAMED.
HANDY WORKER YES, THE
HANDIEST TOOL I’VE EVER SEEN.
IT IS A WORKSHOP IN ITSELF.”
For Home, Farm, Store or Garage.
It includes handy working devices with a
hundred and one uses. Any odd job of repair-
ing around the house, stable or garage can
easily be done with a Stewart Handy Worker
on the premises. So strongly and carefully
made is this useful household device that there
is no limit to the period of its service. It
should last a lifetime. It will serve well and
serve long.
It is ready for immediate use. Bolts to bench
or table and takes up little room, so compact is
its design. The man who does his own repairs
about the house will enthuse over it.
The farmer, who must repair implements,
vehicles, harness, etc., will quickly appreciate
its many conveniences.
The motor-car owner who “tinkers with his
own car, or the chauffeur who does the “tinker-
g” for him, will want to install it in the
garage.
Stewart Handy W orker combines several
everyday-work tools in one strong, compact
device.
There is an anvil, for bending or shaping
things of metal. There is a vise, with strong,
sure-gripping jaws, which will hold wood or
metal job firm under tools; which will hold
saw in place while it is being filed.

There is a pipe vise that will enable its owner to

There is a drilling mechanism, including two
solid, case-hardened steel drills. This drill-
driving mechanism has three speeds. W ith it
holes can be drilled in metal or wood.
There is a carborundum grinding wheel, which
operates with three speeds, and which will keep
all cutting tools in splendid working trim.
This same driving mechanism, operated by cut-
from-solid-steel gearing, can be utilised to drive
small circular saw, buffing wheel, scratch brush,
etc.
CORUNDUM

There is a tool-steel cutting hatdie for cutting
wire or metal.
In a word, the Stewart Handy Worker has every
useful device requisite to make the ordinary,
everyday repairs that must continually he made
in the home, or the farm, or in the garage. It
is a helpful little workshop in itself.

IN BANANA LAND
Passed out in the Big Smoke the other
day, D. T. Seymour, one-time Commissioner
of Police. He came to the colony in com-
mand of the 12tli Regiment away back in
’63, and his sub-tropical experiences so wore
him down that he was but 86 when the
order came to rejoin his colors aloft.
Wm. Kellet, a well-known South Bris-
baneite, passed out last week. Born <6
years ago in Dublin, he levanted to Aus-
tralia at a very early age. He was manager
of Emu Creek station for a while, looked
after the Grange horse-breeding station for
the Bells, and then dropped for a spell of 10
years into Parliament, where he legislated
on good old Tory lines and talked a lot
about the risks of Capital. Afterwards he
went into the stock and station agency busi-
ness. He was full of prejudices and kindli-
ness to the last.
An agitation has been started at Charters
Towers to amalgamate the City Council, the
Water Board and the Queenton Shire Coun-
cil. The shrivelled population of the field is
now only about 1500, and it is burdened
with three chairmen whose annual allow-
ances total £350, and the same number of
office staffs. Unification would save several
thousands a year.
“S.P.": “F. Paul's” remarks (B. 2/3/T6)
do not cover all the woes of the canegrower
in the Babinda State Mill area. In addition
to the order preventing the small grower
planting further cane —owing to the big
man having monopolised the full capacity
of the mill —there is a prohibition against
selling or leasing land in the area without
the Minister’s approval. Seeing the obstacles
that have to be clambered over before appro-
val can be obtained, the prohibition is almost
absolute. On top of all this the small farmer
is hit by a special tax on the land he is
prohibited from using. It’s enough to drive
one back to the city ; and if things don’t soon
improve the district will be in the hands of
many Italians and a few big home-grown
land-grabbers.
The meat interests are furious because
Premier Ityan is determined to keep prices
down. He lias fixed the price for Imperial
supplies at 4 7-Sd. per lb., and that required
for the State shops at 3RI. per lb. After
failing to get an increase on the export figure
a vigorous attempt was made to have the
local rates levelled up. But Ityan stood his

ground; and the Courier, which has been
hurling bricks at the Premier for having
failed to redeem his promise to reduce the
cost of living, is now frantically recalling
that it had always warned electors that
Labor Government meant confiscation and
■ robbery.
“Itan” : When Tommy Tanna was ordered
back, home, there were many who, not being
under indentures, could not be uprooted.
They mostly remained in the sugar districts,
and it was feared that they would develop
into mendicants and nomads. Instead, for
the most part they have settled down as
cane-growers on their own account, and are
developing into as good; citizens as it is
possible for Colored Brother to be: Their
salvation has been the prohibition of liquor.
In the beginning the Kanaka could not
understand the use-of mqney; he based the
rvalue .on the size of the coin rather than the
color of” the metal. ' But he has developed
into a thrifty farmer, and often has a better
idea of the science of tillage than tlnr sur-
rounding whites. He is also, for the most
part, honest and iridustrious, ambitious that
hisf children should get education and morally
healthy.- It: is all a fine reaction from the
heathen whose main desire was to put the
first white he met in the communion-pot and
gnaw his cooked bones.
"Ossian” : Two coincidences anent Premier
Ryan, Crown-Solicitor McCawley and Under-
secretary McDermott, who have left by the
Ventura for London on State business. All
three have been schoolmasters, and the trio
can trace ancestry to the 3000-odd Irish
kings. McCawley’s chief business in London
is to instruct Ryan in the “Eastern” case
an appeal to the Privy Council involving a
claim against the Government for a modest
£lOO.OOO. Ryan has also a squatter’s brief
before the Woolsack, and it is whispered that
bis fee is a tidy one. McCawley. who is also
Under-Secretary for .Justice, is a legal young-
ster who, by rare ability, won the Crown
Solicitorship* at the age of 28. He is a
barrister of nine years’ standing only, with
an official and professional record which is
the envy of the older type of civil servant.
McDermott, Under-Secretary to the Chief
Secretary, is about 55 years of age. He has
an amazing memory on the literary side —
Earl Bryce when here a couple of years ago
said McDermott was the best-read man lie
had met. Peter knows his Johnson almost as
intimately as the obsequious Boswell knew
the Great Bear. Ilis forte is literature — a
fact which brought him from the teaching of
State-school children in the woolly west to
close association with Premier Byrnes, and,
later, ensured his present appointment in
succession to Brunton Stephens. He accom-
panied Denham to London two years ago, and
his voice was apparent in several, of Den-
ham’s post-prandial utterances in Fogland.
Australia has three good representatives in
Pyan, McCawley and McDermott.
A pig fattened at one of the sugar farms

What Billy Didn’t Say
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’ve got the finest land on earth,
A land that shouldn’t dream of dearth,
And yet, unless you lend and lend,
That we may spend and spend and spend
We’d soon be stumped or up a tree,
As helpless, stiff as stiff can be.
It’s pawn and pawn
* From dusk to dawn,
And then again,
In fear and pain,
From dawn to dusk
It’s chew the husk;
And when we’re short of corn ar.d wine,
It’s curse the Kaiser and his swine!
We’re always lifting wages up,
And running o’er the brimming cup;
On “good conditions” we insist
And idolise the Horny Fist;
And if you cry: “It's grand, but, o>
How do you keep it jigging so?”
I simply say: This is the way—
It’s pawn and pawn
From dusk to dawn,
And then again,
In fear and pain,
From dawn to dusk
It’s chew the husk;
And when the booze is turned to brine
We scour the trough beside the swine.
We strive and storm, we strike and strike,
As often as we well like; -
We down the tools for simple fun,
And howl for joy that toil is done ;
This life is all a joke to us —
We keep it up without a fuss.
If you will leud what we will spend,
From dusk to dawn
We’ll pawn and pawn;
And then again,
In fear and pain,
kt. .-.-fYoSi pawn to Musk

And. when the booze is turned to brine
AVe’ll wolf the straps beside the swine.

My Dear T i ufttoo min dah, —
This has been a military week. (W a

"hioh the Y.M.C.A. has built' with W,l,

day a couple of thousand reinforcement

turbances and got into despatches. Xext -
C. of E. Help Society contingent, led bv
chief aerial pilot Donaldson, and reinforced
by Brigadier-General Lee, Chaplain-Colonel
Garland, the Arthur Morgans and a host of
camp-followers, invaded the rifle-range camn
on Thursday, to open a “hut” in place Jr'
the Society’s tent that took a box-seat on a
tornado a little while back.
Friday was the Y.M.C.A.’s Club Hut
Day, the proceeds of the raid going towards
building huts wherever there are Austra-
lian soldiers. Isles-laue, opposite the
G.P.0., was turned into an arcade, and all
the near-by business houses lent basements
Three of the stalls were decked in the colors
of Queensland regiments—the Ninth and
Fifteenth Battalions and the Second Light
Horse. His Ex. visited the street bazaar
in the afternoon and left with bulging

of a Club Hut badge and a boomerang!
handed him for the baby.
To-niglit more funds were raised for Club
Huts at the Exhibition, where the Brisbane
Operatic Players, under Leonard Francis
made their first public appearance. The
team has been together for only six weeks
so the success of the concert is all the more
creditable. Mrs. S. 1». Harris, Miss Tessie
Muleahy, Miss Webber, Lieut. Marcus, and
Magnus Fisher (in a brand-new khaki suit)
were the soloists.
Last Monday afternoon war-correspondent
Harry Gullett and his wife entertained a
party of friends, mostly of the press, at
Lennon's; and on Wednesday the Brisbane
journalists hit back with tea and cake at
Johnson’s Cafe.
The Master of King’s and Mrs. Scott
Fletcher entertained the Council and stu-
dents at the unveiling of the College
Honor Board, which already holds 20 names.
Lieut. F. T. Small (who won his commis-
sion while on active service with the
Engineers) and Pte. A. H. Jones had been
invalided back and were at the party. Major
Pendlebury did the unveiling. The popu-
lar master and Mrs. Scott Fletcher are
leaving Brisbane next week, and will pitch
camp in X. S. Wales.
To-night the Premier was given a send-off
banquet at Johnson’s Cafe. Mrs. Ryan is
going to England, too, and P. J. McDermott,
Under-Sec. of the Chief Sec.’s Dept., and T.
Mc-Cawley, Under-Sec. for Justice, are to be
of the party.
D. J. Abercrombie, Brisbane manager of
the Commercial Bank of Sydney, saw the
veteran T. A. Dibbs into retirement, and
then decided it was time he went too. The
men who had worked with him gave him
an address last week, and there was a dia-
mond brooch for his wife. A. L. Dawson,
his successor, made the presentation.
The death at Toowoomba of Mrs. Tooth,
widow of W. B. Tooth, once of Clifton
Downs, brings back memories of the days
when squatterdom ruled the country and aped
the English squirearchy. The Tooths were the
most hospitable of all, and they had a wide
reputation for their kindly treatment of
travellers, great and small.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

MEGGITT
The Big' Oil Manufacturers
- of Parramatta.
a
This photograph was taken the morning after the fire, almost two
years ago. The mill was totally destroyed, and it was agreed on
every side that work would not start again for at least six months.
This did not suit Meggitt Ltd., however, who, by the aid of a
trilling body of men, shifted 2000 loads of rubbish, cleaned and
sorted the bricks, pulled down the machinery, cleaned, repaired and
erected it, while at the same time a temporary tin building was
erected, and operations were again in hand exactly 6S days after
the morning of the fire.
By “Scrutator.'’
T
'IIE large mill of Meggitt Ltd., of Parramatta, is in many ways a structure unique in
Australia. It is a standing monument to the enterprise of its proprietors, and ought
to he a stimulus to the whole industrial community. It is an effective refutation of
the common pessimistic wail: “It can’t he done in Australia. We haven t got the population.
It would he too risky. We might lose our money.” Well Meggitt Ltd. didn’t take that view.
They were Hot afraid to lose money—what they were after was making money. And they have
made it —the wails of the pessimists notwithstanding. The small, insignificant plant which set on
tears ago no doubt provided the pessimists with material for scoffing is no longer insignificant.
On the contrary, it has silenced the pessimists, and evoked the admiration of all who have seen
it. For it is the concrete embodiment of enterprise, capacity and courage. In a word, the
mill has had an honorable past—has a creditable present, and in all human probability can look
confidently forward to a magnificent future. Meggitt Ltd. have (lone two things they have
made money for themselves and set an example to the whole of Australia. They deserve the
money and Australia needs the example.
Facts am) Figures.-—As facts and figures are more impressive than generalities, let it
be said that the business, which began seven years ago with a plant not worth more than a few
pounds, has now magnificent buildings, plant, new machinery arriving, enormous silos, and huge
storage reservoirs, amounting in all to close on f.>0,000.
The Mill. —The mill is the only one in Australia in which linseed is crushed for the
production of oil and of linseed-oil meal. The oil has won a reputation for purity all over
Australia, and the by-product, linseed-oil meal, is highly popular in England and is beginning
to win its wav to popularity even in Australia. The big works are very handsome, but the
chief merit is the efficiency. At the present moment preparations are being made for the
installation of machinery for crushing linseed equal to anything else in the world. lhe
Mill Manager recently visited America for the purpose of importing similar plants, ant
declared on his return that he saw nothing like it. not even in the great United States What
.trikes one most on entering# the very beautiful offices, facing Macquarie Street, where the
clerical work is carried on. It is quite evident that the proprietors are not of opinion that
business and aesthetics are in antagonism. At one side of the office building, near a piece
of beautiful green lawn, can be seen growing the linseed plant. This is but an experiment, but it goes to prove that there is no tie

V Goon Staff—While Meggitt Ltd. are proud of their achievements, they do not ignore the fact
that they have been largely due to the good and faithful services of their employees. "Both in the
office and in the mill,” said the Managing Directoi.
Mr. Harold Meggitt. “we have splendid workmen—
employees who put both heart and brains into theii
work.”
Invitation to Farmers. —The oil produced by
Meggitt Ltd. has already established itself in
Australia, but the oil meal has not yet won the
reputation which it enjoys in England and which
it ought to have here. Fortunately, however, the
article will be on exhibit at the forthcoming Show,
and it is to be hoped that our farmers will then
embrace the opportunity of becoming acquainted
with its high merits. Indeed, Meggitt Ltd. are so
confident of the high value of their linseed meal
that they extend to all farmers a cordial invitation
to visit the mill.

If so, under the skin you have poison, which

your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be discolored. The disease,

Writes a friend from London, after seeing
seme of the MS.: “Australians will re-
gard ‘Reid’s Reminiscences’ as something in
the nature of a cookery book —so many are
roasted in it.”
The rejuvenated Tasmanian Government is
going in for more State Socialism. To see
that its cubs’ teeth are looked after the
tiger is appointing a couple of State dentists,
who will put in their whole time, with the
help of suitable assistants, attending to the
youngsters’ gnawing machinery.
At Ballarat the other day Mary Godsell,
charged with vagrancy, appealed with some
eloquence to be sent to Pentridge if she
must go to any prison. “I have tried most
of them,” she said, “and Pentridge is the
only one where a lady is treated like a lady.
As for your Ballarat gaol, I never go there
without feeling I am sacrificing my self-
respect.”
Arthur Robinson, Vic. M.L.C., having
volunteered for the A.I.F. and been turned
down by the medical examiners on account of
a farsighted near ear or some such fatal
obstacle, has allowed the rest of the firm off
the chain and accepted the entire burden of
the concern’s law-business. Robinson’s sol-
dier-partner is Forrest Davies, now in camp
and nearly ripe for the Front.
Barker is the only Labor member of the
last Tasmanian Assembly who is not stand-
ing for re-election. The Labor League has
a rule that its candidates shall forward
proof that their nominations are in order,
and a time is fixed prior to the date of
selection. Barker forgot the rule until it
was too late and loses a sure seat in conse-
quence. Incidentally, he was the white-
haired boy of the early-closing-of-bars crowd.
There seems to be a moral in that, some-
where.
Geelong (Vic.) Council is no., doing some
hard thinking, and the citizens are likely to
do some harder mental exercise presently. A
few years ago the Council bought the old gram-
mar-school site for a town hall at a cost of
£ll,OOO, but before it could get the hall built
the citizens tossed the job lot out and the
hall scheme was dropped by everybody but
the contractor, who handed in a bill for
£2OOO. Last week the site was offered at
auction, when the highest bid, recorded in
solemn silence, was £6500.
“B.”: A threatened shortage of the right
kind of paper for stamp-making has alarmed
the Postal Department, and the public has
been asked not to use two penny stamps where
one tuppenny will serve. This precaution
may be all right, but what about saving sup-
plies by dispensing with the system of pay-
ing for telegrams with postage stamps? This
system was, of course, adapted and is main-
tained for audit purposes, it being much
easier to chbck receipts if stamps are
offered as evidence. Still, Private Enterprise
can sell boots and sausages without requiring
its customers to lick a lot of stamps and
plaster them on the bill, and the Dept,
ought to be able to evolve a scheme whereby
the amount of king’s dial Squandered on
telegraph forms could be banked. Inciden-
tally, such a scheme would save a big print-
ing bill, and would lessen the danger to the
public s health from the übiquitous germ.
The rumor that there is a war on has
reached King Island, and a large portion
ot the able-bodied male population is at
the I ront or on the way. But according
to the King Island News those who stay
on the Bass Straits speck don’t let the war
get on their minds too much. It warbles :
After years of manly struggle witti odds against
galore.
We’ve kept our aspirations to the pitch of asking
more,
And now we’ve got what’s wanted, by efforts tireless,
The wary Radio Department has given us wireless!
And another cheer :• —
The Naracoopa jetty and the telephones are hasten-
ing, too, along
To completion and commencement, where prosperity
looms ahead.
Isn’t it ever so much better than being' as-•mod as
dead ? ” •
So it is, brother—so it is !
“Barcoo”: Twenty years ago I ran into
the original of “Dr. Nikola.” lie was the
late Dr. Fitzgerald, of Irisford, on the Barcoo
(W.Q.). With him I met the then unknown
Guy Boothby. Few of. Fitzgerald’s friends
knew that in his youth he had trav-
elled much in China and Thibet. llis admin-
istrators, examining his effects -after his
death, came on a locked diary, which let a
light on his early career and, incidentally
identified him as “Dr. Nikola.” Boothby!
when I met him, was picking up bush iim
pressions and contributing to one of the
Sydney weeklies. It was during this period
-that he put in six months with the Irisford
medico.
“Nemo”: Most people have heard of
Balfe’s “Bohemian Girl” ; this par. is about
Balfe’s Tasmanian Boy. The father of the
lad is Oscar, for years editor of a Launceston
paper, and closely related to the composer—
Dublin men all of them. When the war
started young B. O. Balfe joined the 3rd
Engineers, and was in the landing at Gaba
Tope. In peace time he is a dentist, but in
the war he has been content to be a sapper.
After several months’ hard toil enteric fever
took him off the Peninsula. lie was some
weeks in hospital in Lemnos and then was
sent to England ; but lie’s all right now, and
crying to get back to the scrimmage.
When the war broke out the Remington
Arms Co. was manufacturing weapons Li-
the sporting trade. " It did not wait for
orders, but knowing they would soon flood
the market it spent a million dollars on
extensions, and in less than eight months a
plant had been laid down in which 36.000
people are now employed, turning out 10.000
rifles a day and ammunition by the carload.
One_ of the first orders received was for a
million rifles for Russia. The output is
reckoned to be worth £500,000 per week,
which is almost large enough to attract the
attention of the gentleman to whom N. S.
\\ ales pays £4 4s. a day for remaining in
America. It is a while since that pleni-
potentiary did anything pf visible value, but
he might earn a month’s screw by telling us
plainly and categorically the points of dif-
ference between the Remington works and
methods and those of Lithgow.

like a plant that is drooping
for want of water. And just

And Hands. Scratched and Erup-
tions Developed. Could Not
Sleep. Cuticura Healed.
“The Terraces,” Balcairn, N. Z.—“ The
trouble started with my face and hands
becoming rough and red and then coming
out in little pimples which were itchy and
burning. I used to rub and scratch them
which only made them worse as they would
then develop into little sores. The trouble
was mainly confined to my face and hands
although it scattered a little. The pain
was that bad I could hardly get any sleep
at all and my friends used to say it made
them ill to look at me.
“I saw an advertisement for the Cuticura
Soap and Ointment and I decided to give
them a trial and I was glad I did for they
cured me in a very short time.” (Signed)

IMPORTANT.
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, sucb as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay),
EUDENTA Is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

BOOTS are the smart wear tor the season
—Dame Fashion has east that die most
decisively—-and this white poplin boot,
fashionable, short-fronted, with a trim,
military heel, will look uncommonly well with
the short white skirts of this season. Then,
better still, like all the short-fronted models
in the Bostock range, it is quite amazingly
comfortable, and will suit all types of feet. In
fact, most women will get a pleasant surprise
when they try it on, and see how nice it looks
and how delightful it feels. And it will con-
tinue to feel delightful in wear, since all
Bostock soles are specially treated so as to
extract from them those chemicals used in
tanning, which are apt to make the feet hot
and tired. So, in this boot one will be
dainty, cool and fresh, able to enjoy walks,
picnics and excursions in the most blazing
weather.

The Inky Way.
“The Deacon's Apprentice”: Startling
item from a religious publication which, I
grieve to say, doe.s not get into every home:
After four months in bed, God heard their prayers,
and I recovered.
But perhaps the grateful convalescent meant
to say that he spent the four months in bed.
Prayer otherwise would be almost as slow
as the telephone.
.T. M. Perrier, who lately died at Cronulla
(X.S.W.), wandered up and down the Inky
Way, knocking a crust out on Ma State
papers as far back as Bourke. Me drifted
to Australia in the ’so’s, and though he
joined in the rushes on Maoriland, Victoria
and N.S.W. goldfields, he got little dust out
of them. His only son (Jack) is shouldering
a rifle at a Front somewhere. The old man
was seven years over the three-score-and-ten
mark when the Editor closed down.
* * * *
“D.F.”: The picture-show people are not
the only experts in the art of faking. A
year or so ago the ferry steamer Derwent,
which plies across its namesake river in
Tasmania, caught fire while lying at the
wharf at Bellerive, and had most of her top
works burnt off. A month or two ago a
picture of her as she appeared after the fire
was published in Melbourne. But she was
not a ferry-boat this time ; she was a British
transport which had been knocked about
and set on fire by Turkish shell-fire and then
beached at Lemnos ! She looked like it, too,
but they should have taken out the telltale
background.
* * * *
In an article dealing with food-conditions
in Germany, the Argus quotes a travelling
Dutchman who had a meal at Munich :
I paid 4s. for one horse d’oeuvre, consisting of a
herring, a couple of radishes, a small piece of
celery, half an egg with a sausage, and a couple of
shrimps, which would certainly not cost more than
Is. in Holland.
Of course the horse was in the sausage.

“J.F.11.” (London) : Any Australian Inky
Wayfarer ever attempted to discover the
most popular newspaper title in the Com-
monwealth? In Great Britain and Ireland
Advertiser heads the poll with 160. Times
comes second with 150. News is a near
third with 149, and Gazette and Chronicle
run a dead-heat for fourth place—l2B each.

“Batman”: Young Egypt is picking up
English in good style, and we get some of
our own back thereby. The other morning
a diminutive purveyor of the daily sausage-
wrap piped this outside the O.C.’s tent:
“Paper! Verra nice news! Cap’n Murphy,
the damn scoundrel! Paper!” Of course,
nobody had carefully instructed the youth-
ful alien beforehand as to what he should
say outside the captain’s tent in order to
make sure of a sale!
* * * #
English war economy. As a result of their
decision to print their minutes without punc-
tuation the Northfleet (Kent) council will
save Is. per week. So the ratepayers
can look for something like this: “The Mayor
unveiled a tablet to the memory of Alderman
John accidentally shot as a mark of affection
by his brother aldermen.” „
Lieut. Sid Addison, who has been battling
along the Inky Way in Tasmania for a good
while and has edited the Huon Times for
the past seven years, is going up in the
world. The military authorities have selected
him to undergo a course of instruction in
flying, and he hopes to be on the wing to the
Front before long. <■

“Z, etc.”: One of the immediate besults o*
the increase in salaries obtained for journal-
ists by the A.J.A. was the cutting dow a 0 f
the allowance for “expenses,” such “tea
money” in Parliamentary Press GalK r i es bv
some of the tpS dailies, This m' ans that
though nominally a senior yepe rt -er’« mini-
mum salary should he £864 pa-. anmim it is
in reality much less. That the Federal ii-
come Tax Commissioner vl' ews the matter in
this light is proved by V ie fact that he has
allowed the deductions claimed under this
head by one of the Victims. The obvious in-
ference, of course, is that, to the extent im-
plied, the aw&'d is being dodged, and ex-
penses right. y chargeable to the office are
wrongly debited to the individual employee.

Manchester Courier has stopped the press
after 90 years. This is the paper that trans-
formed Alfred Harmsworth into Lord North-
cliffe; his peerage was the reward for taking
it on when it was in very low water and
when the Manchester Conservatives were ex-
ceedingly anxious to keep it afloat. When he
tackled it, at the earnest request of the local.
Tories, it was taken for granted that he”>
would make it go; but the Libeial Guardian, l
was too strong a rival for even Harmswortli
to hustle off the path.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You that were pink in the dawning—•
That dawning old and clear—
hen the kings of the earth came fawning
Out of a night of fear
To kiss the glint of your sandal lacj
As the young sun breathed on your happy face!
You I have used in my verses—
A serf to ink and pen—
\\ ith your useful light on the hearses
That bore forgotten men
Down to the brink of a paper grave—
A goddess once, you are now a slave!
lou, through the blind and the shutter,
Whimper an old refrain,
Till the little birds are a-flutter
Close to my window-pane—-
Oh, curse your peevishness, let me be
Till your handmaid brings me my morning tea !

Miss VERA
SPAULL
(from a
•photo, by
Kenelm
Stump).
MISS VERA SPAULL has en-
deared herself to Australians as
Mytyl in “The Blue Bird,’’ as
The Little Mother in “The Fatal
Wedding,” and as Bobby in “Seven
Little Australians.” She has a
phenomenal memory, and has
appeared as lead in over twenty
dramas and comedies.
Miss Spaull is a true
Rexona girl and writes as
follows:—■
Rexona is a glori-
ous soap. I regard
it as absolutely the
best I can buy. It
seems to protect the
skin against sun
and wind and re-
moves any tempo-
rary skin blemish
caused by ill-health.
I also think the
world of Rexona
Ointment. For
cuts and skin
troubles of all kinds
there is nothing to
approach it. It re-
lieves and then
cures so quickly.
Rexona Soap and
Rexona Ointment
are indeed twin
blessings. I find the
Soap is delightful
as a shampoo. It
cleans and invigo-
rates the scalp per-
fectly and leaves
the hair so soft and
glossy. Wishing you
success.
Yours faithfully,
VERA SPAULL.

INTERESTING SELECTIONS FROM THE WORLD’S SMARTEST BEAUTY ARTICLES.
SIMPLE RECIPES MOST EFFECTIVE.
How to Discard an
Unsightly Complexion.
“Toilet Club Notes.”
How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexion in the mirror, “If I
could ouly tear off this old skin!” and, do
you knowq it is now possible to do that very
thing? Not to actually remove the entire
skin all of a sudden; that would be too
heroic a method and painful, too, I imagine.
The worn-out cuticle comes off in such tiny
particles, and so gradually—requiring about
ten days to complete the transformation—it
doesn’t hurt a bit. Day by day the beautiful
complexion underneath comes forth. Mar-
vellous! No matter how muddy, rough,
blotchy or aged your complexion, you can
surely discard it by this simple process.
Just get some ordinary mercolised wax at
your chemist’s, apply nightly like cold cream,
washing it off in the mornings.
Why Have Grey Hair?
When a simple, old-fashioned and harmless recipe
will correct it.
Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
an ounce of concentrate of tammalite and mix
it with four ounces of bay rum. Apply this
simple lotion to the hair for a few nights with
a small sponge, and you will soon have the
pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy, and has given perfect
satisfaction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
A Strange Shampoo.
“Cosy Corner Chats.”
* * * I was much interested to learn from
this young woman with the beautiful glossy
hair that she never washes it with soap or
artificial shampoo powders. Instead she
makes her own shampoo by dissolving a
teaspoonful of stallax granules in a cup of
hot water. “I make my chemist get the
stallax for me,” said she. “It comes only in
£lb. sealed packages, enough to make up
twenty-five or thirty individual shampoos,
and it smells so good I could almost eat it.”
Certainly this little lady’s hair did look won-
derful even if she has strange ideas of a
shampoo. I am tempted to try the plan
myself.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment gives instant
relief.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the skin.
You have only to drop a tablet of stymol,
obtained from the chemist’s, into a glass of
hot water and bathe the face with the liquid
after the effervescence has subsided. The
blackheads will then come right off on the
towel. The enlarged pores immediately con-
tract to normal and the greasiness disap-
pears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and cool
and free from blemish. But to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent, it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Is Powder Necessary?
“Practical Suggestions.”
I say emphatically, No! There is a simple
lotion which can be easily and cheaply made
at home, and it is at the same time both
effective and beneficial to the complexion.
Cleminite is a splendid substitute for face
powder, which is at the bottom of many
complexion troubles. Get about an ounce
from the chemist’s and dissolve in four table-
spoonsful of water. The result is a fine clear
liquid, which instantly gives the face, neck or
arms that peach-like bloom of perfect health.
There is nothing to equal it for greasy skins,
and the result lasts all day long under the
most trying conditions. [4

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OCH, ’tis weary we are from the wars,
And ’tis time to be sleeping
With the thatch between us and the
stars,"
Or the skies grey with weeping.
But a man couldn't help it all,
For his dreams brought the hunger
Of deeds, and his shadow was tall
When the morning was younger.
I went by the road of the sun—
’Twas a day warm with laughter—-
’Twas lightsome the thing that I won,
But the grey ghosts came after.
’Twas a dance with the fairies at noon,
But I heard the Slice calling
In the cold of the dark with no moon
When the night mists were falling.
For the word that I spoke was a chain
Past the power of my breaking,
And the oath of my pride grew to pain
On the road of my making.
Och, ’tis swords that are sharp for the
death,
But above the red sinning
What more has a king but his breath,
A thin breath, for the winning?
Holy Brigid of Lamps, I am old,
Make the pulse of me stronger!
Och, give me the hand that can hold
The staff a while longer !
The thing that is done is so small,
But the big dreams are calling—
Och, sure, a man’s shadow is tall
When the red sun is falling !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hand the snow was lightly failin’
Hon ’er shoulders all the while.
f M HAT was some twenty-seven years
| agone. We were going at Christmas-
time in a special holiday train over
the Blue Mountains ; and the singer was a
slight, rather undersized bushman of the
Nearer West, as it was then, of the better
class, who leaned back luxuriously in his
seat in the second-class carriage and enjoyed
his singing. Luxuriously, I say, because it
seemed to be a relief from the everlasting
saddle-way of travelling.
He enjoyed his singing, I said, and so did
I, a young workman sitting opposite him,
who was going “up to the Mountains” that
had neither novelty, rest nor holiday for
him; for he had a job there before, and was
going up to another.
But we were happy travelling in those
days, second-class or first; and the further
some of us were going together the happier
we were. Ways were never long and weary,
nor dull and hot and dreary; and no one
bothered about his watch or time-tables, or
asked how far it was to any station or
what time we’d get there. The whisky flasks
went round and the bottled ale went round ;
and very soon Christian names like Bill
and Jim and Jack went round; and blokes
and coves and fellers and chaps were given
nicknames that lasted them to the journey’s
end and sometimes beyond it, amongst men
who’d never seen each other in their lives
before and might never meet again; and
the brotherly joke went round at each
other’s expense, and there was all the best
of good-fellowship, and we all were mates.
We never bothered about “refreshments”
on those journeys. We were too healthy and
happy to eat —merely “scoffed” a sandwich
or two occasionally, or tore at the leg or
wing of a cold fowl. And that only out of
politeness to the giver, perhaps some lovable
and provident elderly party of the jovial,
well-to-do-digger persuasion. The sight of
stout, black-coated persons of full habit of
life, seriously, earnestly and even nervously
anxious at their soup, with napkins up to
their fat, white throats in the refreshment-
rooms, always filled me with a strange sort
of pity. The others regarded them (or
didn’t regard them) with utter indifference
or as beneath contempt, or above it, if you
like.
A peep into first-class carriages, when we
got out to stretch our legs, mostly revealed
stout, red-faced squatters of the old school
who lived on their runs and had their
women-folk in reserved carriages away from
them; and jolly, good-natured, healthy and
honest-looking commercial-travellers telling
their yarns and cracking their jokes whereof
the humor redeemed the smut. And young
lioneymoon couples evidently in a bad way.
In the next compartment there was a
merry party of all sorts —young fellows
from the city, but mostly in what are called
the “humbler walks of life.” But they
weren’t humble; they were too care-free to
be humble, or anything else except happy.
They had a keg of beer with a wooden tap,
and it had a place on the seat no matter
which one of them had to stand or squat on
the floor. They took great care of that keg
of beer, and their humorist (there was
always one in those days) rested his arm
and head lovingly on top of “Bobby” and
dozed between taps.
Now and again they'd hand a billy out
through the windows into the next com-
partment for’ard of theirs, where a section
of the party were; and then they’d hand a
smaller billy past, per favor of us, into the
next compartment aft of ours, where one or
two stray members of their party were;
and, anon, they’d hand the larger billy in to
ms And so on, after what a French friend
of mine used to call “ze propaire interval.”
They got off at a thirty-minutes’ refresh-
ment station, and the last we saw of them
they were grouped behind the joker of the
party, who was standing on Bobby selling
the train, from engine to brake-van, with its
contents, not forgetting the honeymoon
couples; and the last we heard of them they
were giving us three ringing cheers from the
platform.
And the dust was lightly falling
On her shoulders all the while.
And the sods are lightly lying
On her coffin all the while.
Ah, well! Some of those merry, careless
boys of ’BB and ’B9 may be some of the hard,
silent, sullen, suspicious elderly travellers I
see now. I noticed the change in travelling
before the war —long before. Coming down
from Mudgee, second, Easter before last, and
oyer those same mountains, there were only
silent, sullen, resentful men in our carriages,
and a dusty, shabbily-creased, dispirited and
uneasy shade of a jockey from the Mudgee
racecourse. His taded and sickly-brown
clothing had little three-cornered rents in
it, as if he’d run through barbed-wire
fences from the course to the railway sta-
tion. Probably he had good cause to run,
as Mudgee (and all other) racing goes now.
He seemed too furtive and unsubstantial
even for it to be possible to take him up for
anything. And there was the faded ghost
of an old-time “commercial” who clung to a
Gladstone protected by a holland cover, evi-
dently to help the illusion that it was still
new. And a cranky Yorkshire man—and
they can be cranky. And a disgruntled
Kentish assisted-immigrant, returning from
a job they’d got him in the J.unee district,
and telling the Yorksliireman how he’d
knocked the boss off the plough and got his
bundle and left. There was also something
about “these Australians.” I tried to pro-
mote conversation-—it was a dead, blank
failure. I asked a civil question and, fail-
ing to get an audible reply, I barked at
them that I was deaf. It only elicited a
sickly grin. The Australian seemed to have
vanished and to be extinct. There teas a
tall, lank, sad, silent, elderly man, grey as
a badger, who might have been a grinful
Australian once ; but he had grown too old
and weary and careworn for the job, and
had given it up in despair.
And now for another trip.
The Little Landlady is in a first-class
for’ard with Nigger the cat. Charley the
dog is in a compartment of his own in the
brake-van aft. Charley belonged to the
country—l don’t know which part—and
to a young soldier who took him down to the
city and left him with “friends” and went
to the Front. Now he is going back to the
country with a master who, I hope, will
treat him as well as the first one did.
There are various little ways of doing our
little bits. The Little Landlady, for in-
stance, wanted to boil a bullock’s-heart and
bring it with her, so that I might give
Charley a slice or two at various stations.
Behind me a fortnight of nightmare, clear-
ing up my own affairs and packing and
crating furniture under the advice of a
little woman who was worse when she tried
to assist.
Farewells of, and to, belated friends; the
last bell; the last kiss; the last clasp of
hands ; the whistle, and we are moving with
all our loads of sins and sorrows and pains
and cares, but still with a blessed relief
and —thank God from whom all mercies fall!
The sleeping-car attendant is an old man
—so old and faded that I shall not remember
whether he had a moustache, side whiskers
or a short beard. The Old Guard. The Old
Guard says they won’t serve him at Moss
Yale. So l have a beer, and produce another
glass and put it on the bar and smile at the
laughing girl there as if I know her. Pro-
bably I do. Anyway, I get a stiff nip for
the Old Guard and slip aboard and put it
under one of the seats; and presently—very
presently—l see the Old Guard’s shadow
stoop to that seat, and then his shadow,
glass in hand, reaches down the water
carafe, dilutes sparingly and drinks.
Shadow of a Shadow, Old Guard! Plow
many hands in the dead, dead past may
not have lifted glasses to drink to you !
We move again. The Old Guard seems
a trifle less shadowy and comes and sits by
me thoughtfully till I go along and turn in.
But not to sleep. Then the long roar—roar
—roar-r-r, with the undercurrent of hum and
buzz, with millions of z’s in it, down into
the Goulburn Valley.
Goulburn held no interest for me, except
as regarded getting a beer; and I turned
in again and tried to sleep, and failed. So
I watched the embankments, grey fences and
gbost bush race past in the half moonlight;
and after that went into the smoke com-
partment and sat with several others who
had murder, rape and embezzlement on their
minds —or seemed to have. No one spoke.
Wherefore I turned in again, and this time
I woke to sunlight.
Dry gullies; bleached and fire-blackened
logs and stumps ; blazing watercourses —just
ashen clay-gutters in the scalded ground,
where water seldom comes and never stays
an hour; unutterable scrub. The posts of
the very fences are woolly grey and seem
old, old as the dead trees and as forgotten.
On clearer slopes for miles and miles the
grass from the last rains is dry beyond
dryness and tough beyond toughness-
Everywhere the bleached pale gold of
stubble. The land seems old, old and older
to me. God! ours is the oldest land on
earth —it is old beyond anything.
I didn’t wake in time for Cootamundra,
and the Old Guard must have wanted his
morning’s nip, poor old chap ! However, I’ll
fix him up all right at Junee. Whereat he
confides to me concerning “commercials.”
“If they want to give me a bob,” he says,
“let them give me a bob. And if they don’t
want to give me a bob, let them don’t. But
they always begin about here to find fault
as an excuse for not givin’ me anything.”
They look like that.
Wheat, wheat, wheat! Wheat on both
sides as far as the eye can reach, and every-
where, if I’m not mistaken, the bronze of
Farrer’s wheat. The sun is up, but the
homes are still at rest excepting where blue
smoke from a kitchen chimney hints of a
hearty breakfast. This is not sordid, slaving,
cow-cocky country. It is Wheat!
Presently the “commercials” begin to come
out. stonily suspicious of everybody and of
each other.
We change at Junee; and I spot dog
Charley chained to a lamp-post on the plat-
form and on the best of terms with the
guards. He is specially demonstrative
towards a young fellow in khaki who is
going down by the next train. Perhaps he
recognises the uniform. Something also
seems to move this soldier-boy from the
country, for he makes as if he’d almost take
Charley nr» in bis arms, bisr ns lie is.

DROPSY
Watery Swellings under the Eyes and in the Ankles, Limbs and Body.
The fluid you take with your food,
in a single month , weighs as much as
your entire body.*
Most of this fluid has to pass out
through the kidneys, bladder and
urinary system.
Imagine what would happen if the
outlets for this water were stopped up !
In a few hours the limbs and body
would swell to a great size with the
collected water.
That is what actually takes place in
dropsy.
Dropsy is the name given to the
soft, watery swellings which appear in
the ankles, limbs and body, under the
eyes or in the eyelids, or on the backs
of the hands. If you press your finger
into the swollen flesh the pitting slowly
fills up with the water again.
*(».e. —If you are of average weight.)
DROPSICAL EYES.
DROPSY is not a disease in itself,
but it is serious because it indicates
serious disease.
It may show that the kidneys are
failing to separate the waste water from
the blood, or that there is something
obstructing the urinary canals and
preventing the waste water passing out;
or it may be caused by defective action
of the heart.
Tapping takes away the water from
under the skin, but more water soon
collects, because tapping cannot reach
the cause of the dropsy, and as long
as the cause remains the dropsy will
continue.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
a quick and direct action on the kidneys
and bladder. They promote a free flow
from the system, washing out clogging
impurities from the passages, and
draining out the collected water through
the natural channels. They gently
lead the kidneys back to health and
activity, and thus reach the cause of
most cases of dropsy.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have
no action on the heart, nor on the liver,
stomach or bowels ; they are solely for
the kidneys and urinary system, and
are, therefore, of the highest value in
dropsy, gravel, stone and all diseases
arising from kidney and bladder trouble.
Doan’s Backaolie Kidney Pills are sold by all
chemists and storekeepers at 2/9 per bottle, or
post free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Stree ,

On catching sight of me he sets up such
a barking as I never heard from a dog
before. Every dog has his day, but Charley
must have had a very uncomfortable and
anxious night of it. However, his troubles,
which he never shows by any sign to any-
body—except perhaps at times to me —will
soon be all over now.
Wheat, wheat, wheat, wheat, wheat,
wheat, wheat! Seas of it on both sides, and
all to feed a great, ant-swarming, mostly-
useless city like Sydney, or to be sent abroad
to feed soldiers who are murdering each
other for one man’s hateful greed !
Narrandera, with hints of rocky outcrops,
ivied red brick, picture-book little churches,
and real homes and greenery; and so on to
Yanko and Leeton, the irrigation area —to
a new life in an old dead land that is being
made to live again.
HENKY LAWSON.
The Imperative Apricot.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fruit harvest is hurrying citywards
by train and waggon. In tons it is
reaching the entrance of temples
raised to JAM. Amid a helter-skelter of
borses, lorries, boys with trucks, men with
barrows and buckets it reaches the interior
and pours itself over the benches and tables
for “treatment.” The women who annu-
ally swarm the jam factories as casual help
are watching for the “ads” in the dailies.
And presently they see it.
Treating fruit. One hundred women wanted to earn
big money.
Now I would earn money—in any quantity.
So, armed with nothing save my inexperi-
ence, I approach the portal, guided thereto
ay slovenly boys who pass to and fro with
;rucks of jam, tins, trucks of labels, trucks
af lids.
A glimpse within shows ninety-nine of the
vomen already at work. Will the boss take
ane more to make the tally even? He will.
‘Or’right,” he says. “Go up an’ change.”
Up a narrow stair, the handrail sticky with
iam, through a door smeared with jam, past
ivomen whose skirts, hands and hair are all
rglue with jam, into a dining-dressing
room where hot water makes tea and, inci-
lentallv, cleanses one of jam.
The walls are lined with wire-gauze com-
partments within which, like spiders in webs,
ittendants lurk who take our clothes through
trapdoors and imprison them under lock and
key.
Comment upon this to other “big money”
iarners who are peeling off silk blouses and
rlimbing into ancient duds in anticipation of
being employed as fruit “squashers” wins an
explanation. “Pretty mixed lot here in the
busy season —lot o’ strays, ye know. Alight
:ose even your corset if yeh didn’t cage it.
Woman ’ad a baby stole ’ere once, so I’ve
bin told.”
Sensation among us, and a derisive growl
from a mother who is struggling out of a
petticoat and into a kind of sack. “No
'casion to steal that sort o’ property,” she
says acidly.
“Mind, I’m not sayin ’ nothing,” adds the
narrator of past crimes, with a glance at
the attendants. “Things are aw-right now,
I b’lieve; and”—virtuously—-“long as you
keep yourself to yourself an’ don’t mix with
the rough lot, you’ll be right.”
Descending we join the ninety-nine. A
forewoman pins blue pay-slips to our shoul-
ders, and, picking our way through much
loose fruit which litters the floor over, we are
driven to where mounds of apricots pile the
table and clamor for immediate treatment.
Someone pitches to each of us a wooden
bucket and a mallet, both stiff with cold
fruit-juice. We surround the too-quickly-
ripening apricots, and, lo! we are established
—full-blown “squashers,” in the way of earn-
ing “big money.”
“Treatment” of the enemy consists of
grabbing a handful and disembowelling it in
the fraction of a second, pitching the pulp
into one bucket and the stones into another.
Being a novice I don’t for the moment realise
that my fingers are my tools; but a voice
shouts in my ear, piercing the din of
machinery. “Fire away !” and I fire. At
least the apricots do. They slither in all
directions when I, picking up a handful in
clumsy imitation Of experts, try to extract
all the stones at once. Off they go like
fireworks, flying high among the belting that
whizzes overhead. I make frantic dabs at
them. No use ! I am no juggler; they none
of them return to me, but, falling low, join
the lost legion already on the floor. After
that I try more delicate methods, stoning a
single apricot at a time as one would at home,
with as little handling as maybe. This is
easy but not conducive to big money. I am
squeamish, too, in the matter of apricot
juice. I don’t like it in my eye—or my hair.
And bits of soft pulp squirted over the nos-
trils produce apricot apoplexy in no time.
A smart knock on the eyeball from a fly-
ing half-green apricot produces ophthalmic
distress and tears, both of which have to be
treated acrobatically with the shoulder,
owing to the hands and arms being golden
and gluey to the very elbow with the juice
of a million apricots clamoring for the jam
room. All this counts for delay, and delay
in bucket-filling means a loss of ljd. or
thereabouts, and how shall I make good with
losses of this magnitude?
I am struck in the eye so often with these
flying missiles that I become suspicious of
my neighbors. Have they got me “set”?
Are they doing it on purpose? My gorge
rises and I try what can be done with some
very pulpy stuff, two handsful of which I
squash savagely. The obvious result should
have been to squirt the juice of it at least
into my aggressor’s eye; what actually
happens is that the beastly stuff turns on
me, leaving me gasping, while x paw round
for a handkerchief or a bit of sacking as an
eye-wiper. And the other “squashers,”
innocent alike of vendetta or revenge, go on
“speeding up,” performing miracles with ten
fingers, ten apricots, ten nuts, filling three —
yea, four—buckets to my one.
As the day wears on they develop a
perfect fury of speed. Grabbing handfuls
of mushy fruit they hold it over the waste
bucket, gouging out the nuts by some play of
hand-muscle quite unknown to anyone save
a seasoned “squash.” They drive a finger
right through an apricot, the nut shooting
out like a bullet and hopping neatly into
its appointed place.
The supply of over-ripe fruit temporarily
giving out, they roll forward dozens of half-
ripe and green, and with well-directed blow r s
of the wooden mallet smash them to a
workable condition. There is much com-
plaint over this. How can “big money” be
earned when fruit is unstoneable? Where-
fore the hatted and sticky youth who walks
round incessantly dumping boxes of fruit all
over us is exhorted to “bring better stuff.”
“Rats !” says he, and swamps us with more
Unripe. “Y’got to do ’em,” says he. “Take
the bad with the good. Y’ can’t have it all
rotten !”
Yet even as he speaks he relents, flooding
us with another ton or two —this time
frankly over-ripe. Whose the blame? These
poor apricots have been misused —have been
waiting, yes, waiting for us! They have
been outside, stacked in a hot right-of-way,
and were forgotten while greener stuff was
given pride of place. Fair is fair, and w T hen
a consignment of fruit is left in the sun till
it begins to boil, who is to blame if Stynko,
the.youth before mentioned, must scoop off
the top layer of fermenting mush and fungi
with a practised hand before he leaves us to
the situation?
When my first bucketful is ready I
stagger with it across the juicy floor, join-
ing in a procession of women similarly
armed. Slowly we converge upon a Sphinx-
like figure squatting at a desk and armed
with a snip. As we pass in single file she
takes the end of the blue slip depending from
our shoulders and punches a hole in it.
That hole represents ljd. earned by the
“squash,” or maybe three half-pence.
Before me is a little fat woman whose
every protuberance is glistening yellow with
juice, and whose pay-slip has twenty-four
holes in it already. By night-fall she would
would be a Jay Gould even at fd. per bucket.
Once past the Sphinx we press on to a
row of trollies holding wooden tubs into
which we pour our lid. worth. The con-
temporaries of Stynko wallow over these,
perpetually pressing down each instalment
till, the tubs being full, other Stynkos haul
them away to the jam room.
Through curves of belting that flog the
dusty air, wheels of whirring gooseberry
cleaners, massed effect of toiling squashers,
swift yet leisurely week-workers stemming
cherries and halving peaches, crash of tinny-
sounding machinery and the everlasting
mushy flop of fruit pulp, I glimpse an army
of Stynkos, priestly in jam-strewn overalls,
smiting the bubbling contents of cauldrons
with rods as Moses smote the rock, while
girls in leather leggings and coated all over
with wet sugar are the handmaidens. And
beyond this Inferno another impressionist
picture—a court-yard, a fallen horse, an
avalanche of apricots falling from an over-
turned lorry, and on a fresh lot of tables a
landslide of other apricots—apricots green,
apricots ripe that won’t wait, apricots rotten
that have waited too long, and a distracted
foreman looking doorwards, hoping to find
there another hundred Peris at the gate
anxious to earn big money!

—far. far from the reek and clatter of this
jam factory, where nine hundred women
appear to have bathed in fruit pulp; where
giving up all attempt at neatness, they wine
their hands on their hips, their hair, and
lounge their bulky outlines upon mounds of
fruit in utter weariness, for standing ten
hours a day begets a slackness of poise hard
to overcome. The remaining hundred
engaged on the quest for wealth remain
decently clean. Maybe they are more expert
in diverting the fruit’s effusiveness into the
proper channels. *
An inquiry concerning “knock off” time
elicits no answer from the twelve women
who surround my bench. It’s an unpopular
subject where everyone is anxious to work
24 hours a hay in the race for gold, so ah are
conveniently deaf. Instead of answer a thin
voice cuts into the clatter of machinery, like
a million tin-cans in conflict. “How old
would you take me to be?” it asks.
“They’ll answer that, at any rate,” I
mutter. But no; not even that bait will
draw the majority of squashers from the pur-
suit of big money.
The theme gains listeners only among the
very young or the very old. I take no part
in it myself. It is a ticklish subject.
What more concerns me is “knock off”
time, for I have a mind to abandon big
money.
The foreman, being questioned, breaks
almost into tears. “Knock off! You don’t
knock off. never, not till the fruit’s done!
Knock off! Don’t you know you work over-
time, 6.30 to 8.30? Sleep? You don't sleep

the tables—” ’sides twenty loads waiting in

o’clock ‘goods.’ ’Struth! D'you think
we’re a school —in at nine an’ out at four?
Y r ou carn’t knock off! Apricots won’t wait.”
They do, though—for me. For, abandon-
ing my inexpert pursuit of big money, I
hand in my pay-slip, and receive—eleven-
pence.

Look To Your Health
for it is without a doubt the most important part of a well-ordered
life. Good Health may be truly considered to be the basis of both
success and satisfaction; commercial ability as well as social qualities
are largely dependent upon the possession of this greatest of all
blessings. Now in order to enjoy good health it is essential to bear in
mind that certain conditions must prevail. The process of digestion
must be carried on with regularity and harmony; the appetite must be
good ; the bowels must be in a state of healthy activity ; the liver and
the kidneys must perform their functions with efficiency. How are
these desirable conditions to be brought about ? One simple method is
strongly recommended; namely,an occasional dose of Beecham’s Pills.
This medicinal preparation has been proved beyond contradiction to
be of great value in the prevention and cure of most of the ailments to
which the digestive organs are liable. Such symptoms as biliousness,
constipation, depression, flatulence, headache, indigestion in many
distressing forms -all speedily yield to the remedial influence of
