HIS
BOOKS
A Translated Australian
The Meeting Pool, by The Bulletin’s
Melbourne writer, M. G. Skipper, has now
been translated into the Czechoslovakian
and issued in two editions, one at 4s. 3d.
in two colors, a beautiful piece of book-
making, superior even to the capital Brit-
ish edition at 7s. 6d., and a cheap edition
at 2s. 9d., with paper covers, fine print and
excellent reproduction of Coulter’s illus-
trations. The book has also been broad-
cast in England, and looks as much like
lasting as anything in its branch of writing
of the last 10 years. The publishers, Elkin
Mathews and Marrot, have just commis-
sioned Coulter to illustrate a book with
a South African setting. It. is a sidelight
on official Australia’s attitude towards
literature that the edition of The Meeting
Pool which sells at 2s. 9d. in Czecho-
slovakia cost Is. 6d. to send from Mel-
bourne to Sydney.
Fitzpatrick’s Verse
Another interesting item in current Aus-
tralian writing is Brian Fitzpatrick’s Songs
and Poems, printed by Wilke and Co., Mel-
bourne, in a limited edition of 400, selling
at 45., and dedicated to a number of the
most handsome letters in the alphabet.
My copy, from Angus and Robertson, has
decorations by Alex. Mcßae, and there is
an introductory essay by the poet, in which
he has caustic things to say about alleged
Australian “poetry,” and about those who
would exalt this doubtful literature at the
expense of Poetry and poetic taste. This
leads him to shout “literary cannibal” at
Kendall, and to regard Lawson and Pater-
son as rhymesters of the “wattle and bottle”
tradition. Only a critical boob would give
to any Australian poet the title of great;
but while one can appreciate Fitzpatrick
and others he mentions (he might explain
why he left Slessor out) in their laudable
endeavor to give us a little chamber music
to go with our rollicking outdoor rhymes,
it surely doesn’t follow that one must be
deafened, either by him or the parrots he
peppers, against the poetry that is in our
primitive and more rugged writers. I like
a good deal of Fitzpatrick’s work. It be-
longs here and now, and is not, like so
much of the trash editors have to read,
either all jingle or all echo. In satire and
invective he is as effectual as might be
expected of one who had written this pre-
fatory note:—
Many of the lighter verses printed herein appeared
first in “Punch,” Melbourne; and the “Sunday
Times,” “Sunday News,” “Evening News,” “Daily
Pictorial” and “Plain Talk,” Sydney. Disconcert-
ingly, every one of these journals has ceased publi-
cation. The writer finds himself, therefore, in the
quandary whether he owes to their late proprietors
his acknowledgments or his apologies.
But there is as much poetic content in one
verse of Lawson’s as in all of his; so there
is in a mere two stanzas of his “literary
cannibal”:—
The fierce, disastrous flying fire,
That made the grent caves ring,
And scarred the slopes and broke the spire,
Is a forgotten thing.
The air is full of mellow' sounds;
The wet hill-heads are bright;
And, down the fall of fragrant grounds,
The deep ways flame with light.
To be alive to the humbug of our literary
windbags surely does not mean that one
must be deaf to that sort of voice. I find
in Paterson, too, a fair sound of music,
quite apart from the famous stanza of
“Clancy.” Even in that mere nothing his
“Prelude” there is a more authentic ring
and more modesty—l do not advance the
latter as a poetic concomitant—than I have
been able to find in the author of
I do not care though oftentimes
The folk who worship Wordsworth’s verse
And moral axioms disburse
Calumniate my noble rhymes.
I like them,
in which —and elsewhere—he neither dam-
ages his target nor adorns himself. Yet
what Fitzpatrick has to say, both in prose
and verse, deserves to be listened to wher-
ever in Australia there is a feeling for
literature not overcome by bigotry or the
noise of the windbags.
Money Writes
Fitzpatrick’s “literary cannibal” is dove’s
cooing compared with the invective and
abuse which Upton Sinclair throws about
in Money Writes, just given an English
printing by Werner Laurie, at 7s. 6d. net.
Sinclair’s thesis is that the influence of
money is to be seen in nearly everything
that is written, especially in America. The
trouble with him as a critic is that he has
no literary sense whatever. Only Com-
munist. tracts have any literary merit in
his eyes. What he doesn’t understand —
such as Cabell’s
work—he puts con-
temptuously into
an ivory tower.
It is significant
that the tower is
of ivory. Sinclair I
could never see it, but the whole difference
between what is literature and what he con-
siders literature to be is implicit in his own
choice of building material. The stuff
which he thinks literature, including the
verse of his wife, which, with pardonable
misjudgment, he calls poetry, would find
its proper house in a tower of soapboxes.
His voice altogether is very loud, and his
logic so erratic that it is always walloping
itself, but his book is pungent, racy, alive
with thought and worth reading for its
vigor alone.
Life of a Movie Maker
Sinclair would eagerly join those who
have attacked John Drinkwater for writ-
ing his Life and Adventures of Carl Laemmle
(Heinemann; 10s, 6d. net). His reason
would be that hatred of capitalism which
roars like a bush-fire through Money
Writes. Drinkwa.ter’s critics—E. V. Knox
and Hugh Walpole among them —have been
inspired b} T something much more like
snobbery. These snobs, though, are not
altogether ridiculous. There is so much
vulgarity associated with moving pictures
that anybody might be excused for thinking
that a leader of the industry and any. Life
of him must necessarily be vulgar also.
Drinkwater’s finished job is the complete
answer to this. He makes it worth while
by illuminating with his good taste and
good style that side of Laemmle described
in the sentence: “The truth is that we may
search the annals of industrial conflict in
vain to find a better fellow.” Most of
Laemnile’s life has been a hard and savage
fight, chiefly against a Trust that was event-
ually wiped out by United States edict
as a public nuisance. In that fight he used
the weapons of his opponents—often deci-
dedly vulgar, as weapons have a way of
being—and some of his own that were more
original than dignified. When he found the
Trust employing thugs to batter his work-
ers, he paid thugs, too; and—the one thing
in which he at all resembles Sinclair—he
published without scruple any intelligence,
private or otherwise, that was likely to
hurt. And yet the fine side of him, on
Drinkwater’s showing, came through un-
contaminated. He began in poverty in
Germany, sold papers in Chicago, worked
on a farm, at book-keeping and in a cloth-
ing store, and, getting into the movie busi-
ness when it was as old as Christopher
Robin, fought his way against the most
powerful opposition and the 17 lawyers it
employed to harass him, until he holds
the leading place in what is said to be the
fourth largest industry in the world. If
this be vulgar, says Drinkwater, what price
glory? The biographer does not believe
the screen “can ever drive the three-dimen-
sional presence of the living actor from the
stage/’ but he is convinced that “more and
and more the best pictures are ranking
as the most successful pictures.” One aspect
of the question of freeing the movies from
vulgarity which he curiously overlooks is
that it does not all depend on the pro-
ducers. They, in a fair number of instances,
have risen above vulgarity to something
that might almost be called art, but the
showmen do not follow. Most places in
which pictures are shown in Australia are
themselves monstrous examples of vul-
garity; the advertisements for the finest
pictures are often debased, and spraying
a theatre with stinking scent is thought
to be in the finest taste. But these things
are not Drinkwater’s concern. That which
is, the life of Carl Laemmle, he has made
into a book which does not measure up to
his Pepys only in the degree by which
Laemmle does not measure up to that
picturesque person.
Grasshoppers
David Garnett’s The Grasshoppers Come
(Chatto and Windus; Roy croft; 7s. 6d.)
is a prose narrative brevity acutely critical
and expertly descriptive of a long-distance
stunt-flight, started to satisfy a silly
woman’s vanity and ending in a crash,
after which one of the two men who accom-
panied the lady goes off with her, and they
vanish, as if forgotten, from the story.
A plague of grasshoppers supplies food for
the other chap until a stray Chinese flier
rescues him. It is a cameo of realism done
with a delicate touch and a sense of beauty.

The Broadcasting Contract
The Government, as I write, is supposed
to be discussing whether the Australian
Broadcasting Co. will be given a renewal
of contract or whether other arrangements
will be made.
Broadcasting in Australia, as I see it,
has been in the hands of its natural enemies,

the press, the theatre and the picture show,
not to mention inferior music. If the press
controls it, it doesn’t require much imagina-
tion to understand how criticism may be
stifled. If the show world controls it, it
doesn’t require much imagination to see
that it is not in the interests of those con-
cerned to make it good enough to keep
people sufficiently entertained at home. If
inferior music controls it, it doesn’t require
much imagination to see that there is a
stimulus for inferior music to figure largely
on the programmes.
I do not offer any criticism of the A.B.C.
It may, for all I know, put on the best
programmes available. I am just pointing
out that there is a good deal to be said for
those who think otherwise. When the con-
tract was given, there was considerable talk
about “Advisory Committees,” who would
supervise the programmes and have the
right of censure if they were not up to
standard. We are still waiting for them
to be appointed in New South Wales.
Victorian programmes, especially of late,
have been very much superior, musically,
to those of the Ma State. Presumably,
those in charge think that Sydneyites favor
banjos, guitars and other primitive solo
instruments in preference to orchestras of
40 pieces. Under a true national broad-
casting company this differentiation be-
tween States would not be permitted, and
attempts would be made to foster the love
of the good, instead of pandering to the
tastes of the vulgar. As far as the Ma State
is concerned, the A-class stations too often,
instead of being in the vanguard of the
musical train of progress, have, as someone
remarked the other day, been in the guard’s
van.
Who should control broadcasting? The
State, just as much as it controls most
other forms of education. Control should
most certainly not be given, as in the past,
to those who are more interested in the
showman’s side than in the educationist’s.
Broadcasting is the Big Show. Nothing
equals it in importance and size. When tele-
vision comes, there is a grave chance that
it will wipe out picture shows, theatres,
concerts and everything else. Who is going
out to see and hear plays and players when
by pressing a button and raising a screen
the world’s best singers, players and speakers
will appear in one’s home, almost in the
flesh? At present the radio is an infant
scarcely 10 years old. Think of the car of
to-day compared with the car of 1910.
Radio to-day stands where the car of 1910
stood in the days gone by. We are just
beginning to realise its possibilities. No
one knows its future. We only know that
it is the Big Show, now. Soon it may be
the Only Show.
If not the State to control broadcasting,
who else? I can only think of the wireless
trade, for it is the trade’s mission in life to
see that it is the biggest thing in the world.
We have a station in Sydney, 2UW, whose
programmes are preferred, in many cases,
to others. It is a trade show, and although
it mainly runs records, it is steadily going
in for flesh-and-blood artists. It, or some
other trade station, may be the first to give
us a real permanent symphony orchestra
comparable to the 8.8.C.’s band. The
stimulus for the trade so to do is that “the
better the programmes, the more customers
for wireless sets.”
The wireless trade can always have its
B-class stations. In my opinion, if we are
to have a national service of A-class
stations, they should be controlled by the
nation and not hired out to parties who
may be interested in a business way in the
programmes submitted.
CON DENSER.
A Satchel of Books
Pitiful Dust, by Vernon Knowles (Bodley
Head; 7s. 6d. net). A man who gives way
to the light love of one woman and lets the
deep love of another go by, with disastrous
results to all. A brief but convincing piece
of fiction, very finely written.
French Leaves, by E. V. Lucas (Methuen;
ss. net). French towns, works of art, inns
and the customary other things which engage
Mr. Lucas’s eye, are the topics of this series
of engaging sketches. To go with Mr. Lucas
is to travel light, but never disagreeably.
The Menace of the Downs, by Miles Burton
(Collins; 7s. 6d. net). Messenger boy found
in ditch with throat cut, apparently by
broken bottle. Accident? Suicide? Murder?
Differs from the usual thing of the kind
chiefly in that the solution is reached by
ordinary human beings blundering from one
clue to another.
The Gates Are Mine, by Margaret M.
Brash (Jarrolds; 7s. 6d. net), is a well-
ordered study of a young wife’s sacrifice of
her personality to the egoism of her husband,
who is an educationist with ambitions. The
writer has considerable powers of story and
analysis, and, incidentally, supplies an inter-
esting description of the Link schools, whose
modern methods are practically unknown in
this country.
Flesh and Blood, by John Brophy (Dent;
7s. 6d. net). Belongs to the order of mys-
tery stories that make something very much
like literature out of thrill. The superficial
question is: Did Stephen Gage, the brilliant
specialist, kill Martin Hannaford, the famous
novelist, and if so, why? The jury’s answer
to the question is that he didn’t. The author
retorts that he did, and reveals the reason.
On the way he creates character and handles
situation admirably, keeping interest very
neatly pinned.
John Stephen Strange’s The Strangler Fin
(Collins, 7s. 6d. net) is a thriller by one
who knows all the tricks of the horror-pur-
veyor’s grisly trade. For three-quarters of
the book suspicion rests on almost every
member of the house-party on the island off
the Florida coast —the island from which
Stephen Huntington mysteriously dis-
appeared one night, and on which young
Stuart was murdered a few hours after he
he had discovered a clue to the Huntington
business. Was Huntington gripped and
squeezed to death by the strange tree in
which the body with the cigarette-case was
found? Or were human agencies responsible?
The problem is solved by a New York lawyer
with a craze for criminal investigation. The
hardest thing to swallow is the patience of
the other guests in face of the tedious and
unauthorised cross-examinations of this
young man.
The Sands of Windee, by Arthur W.
Upfield (Hutchinson; 7s. 6d. net). A fair-
average-quality murder yarn, strung out in
a western N.S.W. station, with Napoleon
Bonaparte, a half-caste of Queensland Uni-
versity education, as the Sherlock of the
piece. The novel’s gullies are bridged with
tin-kettling, corroborees, blackfellow fights
and so forth, and eventually Bony, after
breaking in horses and acting as station cook,
solves the mystery of an absconding Sydney
policeman’s disappearance. Bony himself is
a miracle, but the yarn is quite O.K. of its
kind. The writer is Westralian and ex-A.I.F.
In style and dialogue E. W. Pocock’s
Sterling Versus Sterling and Another (Cecil
Palmer; 7s. 6d. net) recalls “The Little
Visitors.” .Mrs. Sterling has been visiting
Ralph Jennings by night (in all innocence),
and her husband sees but doesn’t recognise
her as she is being put into a taxi.
“And pray what keeps you out this time of
night?” asked Ralph by way of a feeler.
“Wei l, to be perfectly frank,” said Montagu,
the innocent cause of my perambulations is a
member of the same sex as you so gallantly bade
adieu to, you old rascal. I really believe you saw
me, you dark horse.”
There is an absurd divorce suit, “but at
last Mr. Bassett Stentorian, K.C., rose and
asked leave to withdraw the petition and
have the petitioner’s old friend Ralph Jen-
nings dismissed from the_ suit.”
This announcement came as a great shock to all
in court, but they were not allowed to express
their surprise in the vulgar way, as the Judge, in
solemn, rather sincere, manner delivered himself.’
Worth reading for its naive crudities.
And a Little Verse
THE WOMAN AND THE SONG.
Troy fell for a kiss—
Or was it a pirate raid told in fantastic
story ?
How the world may miss
Its way between the greater and lesser
glory
If a poet tell the tale!
Greedy the taking hands of plunder from
plunder;
But shall the years fail
To hear Achilles marching in shining mail
With brazen thunder?
With a piece of bread—
Waste from the table of loud and arrogant
princes—
Legend was amply fed
Till an inspiration before which history
winces
Flooded the hearing mind.
For he who ate had the gift of wonderful
singing,
Though his eyes were blind ;
And the roll and lift of his song on the
ageless wind
Set the ages ringing.
Some Homer may tell—
Weaving the fact to fit the fantastic
story—
How pent Sydney fell,
For the sake of magic touching the sordid
to glory.
And the ages shall miss
The wool and the mutton and profit of
lawful plunder.
Sydney fell for a kiss!—
Perchance for a thousand —while words of
burning bliss
Crowd ages with wonder.
Who pauses to dream
Of George-street, Ilion, lighted with torch
and taper,
Hot with a human stream
Hunting and haunting the bargain sales
of the draper?
Only the royal air
Blows from the ramparts, where iron
triumphs harden,
To the world-wooing pair.
Where Helen, crowned with her marvel of
tawny hair,
Sits in a queen’s garden.
How shall men fail
To tell of the gods of Sydney, walking in
wonder
With blue robes that trail
The ample and hollow dome on sandals of
thunder?
If a poet shall tell
How the age of moving pictures ran to
its fiery ending
And the Central station fell,
The ivory breasts of Helen again shall
swell
To the ruin and rending.
Grey years forget
The bridge that was built and the market
prices of cotton.
But the song lingers yet;
And the kisses brand deeply an age when
the rest is forgotten.
O girl of old Troy !
O girl of new Sydney with Heaven and
Hell in your kisses !
Time cannot destroy
The destruction that heeds not destruction
for lyrical joy
Of some mad thing it misses.
Old Homer has truth ;
And new Homer, as wild to our thought
and fantastic,
Shall still sing of youth.
For the facts of the world are divine and
divinely elastic,
Stretching here, stretching there.
But always in crystalline facets the day’s
thought shall harden
And glitter in radiant air
To Helen sitting with doom and her tawny
hair
In a royal garden.

WOULD COMMUNISM BE
BETTER?
Ah Sin wallops his joss when things go
badly; and we follow suit, while a dis-
gruntled chorus shrieks to us to pitch out
the old gods altogether and take new ones.
Among others, Capitalism, Competitivism—
call it what you like—is asked to look upon
the world’s millions of unemployed and say
whether it has not been a ghastly failure—
whether there is a word to be said why it
should not be thrown on to the scrapheap
with the rest.
There are not many things that are a
complete success. Marriage breaks down
very often; and an occasional black sheep
gets into the most jealously-guarded rever-
end flock. We have even had corrupt
Judges; and a Court is sitting in one State
to determine whether, after all, the repeated
choice of the people did not do a rascally
thing. No matter how the verdict goes in
this case, thousands of people will say that
they know thousands of good things this
man did. And, of course, it is true. No
man is so bad that there is not some good
in him and none so good that there is not
some bad in him. It is the same with sys-
tems of government and economy. We
have to judge them all on points.
True, this Capitalism, or whatever you
like to call it, finds millions unemployed
and hungry. But Capitalism has no mon-
opoly of hunger. In Russia a group of
men who have been studying world prob-
lems for years past and preparing their
answer are making what no doubt is an
honest and certainly is a tremendous test
of Communism. It is not necessary to
believe one-quarter of the evil reports that
come from Russia; but official statements
are quite frank about the breakdown of
the organisation at many points, involving
hunger, misery, starvation, death. Com-
munism is not to be condemned on account
of that failure; nor is Capitalism because
of the breakdown of organisation which has
left millions out of work. Nothing designed
by man or operated by man will be free
from breakdowns. What is infinitely of
most importance is therefore (1) the cap-
acity of a system to keep the people alive
through a period of collapse; (2) its capa-
city to repair the damage.
The capacity to live through a crisis
depends upon having available reserves.
Now, one of the crimes charged against
Capitalism is that it encourages the creation
of reserves in the hands of individuals.
Millions, they say, starve in the midst of
plenty. But they don’t starve in the midst
of plenty. They are fed; they are tended
in sickness; they are housed; their children
are educated. Last year the direct dole pay-
ments in the U.K. were 88 millions, the
indirect five millions. The total amount
paid (England and Wales only) in orphans’
and widows’ pensions was nine millions; in
sickness allowances, etc., 31 millions. The
greater part of this huge sum was taken out
of that reserve of wealth whose very exist-
ence has been one of the chief crimes alleged
against the capitalist system. That system
has been pictured as a monstrous growth
consisting of a few fat men on top and
millions of lean men underneath. If ever
there was much truth in the picture, there
is none to-day. The backbone and spinal
marrow of the system consists now of
millions of small investors. When the
Lang Government so lightly dipped into
the coffers of a great savings bank for
money, it was, in fact, dipping into the
pockets of hundreds of thousands of thrifty
working men and women. At the latest
date to which the “Commonwealth Year-
Book” brings its figures, in Australia, with
its mere six millions of people, there were
2,453,000 life insurance policies for a total
amount of 342 millions. The Great Finan-
cial Interests which exploit the poor have
become largely a myth everywhere and
wholly a myth in Australia. The burdens
upon the shoulders of the poor in these
days they have for the most part placed
there themselves—the horde of little
middlemen and other parasites which have
fastened upon the people, not because the
people are poor, but because they have more
money than many of them have yet learned
how to spend wisely.
The age of Capitalism may be said to have
begun towards the end of the eighteenth
century: it was in 1768 that Arkwright per-
fected the spinning frame and in 1789 the
wool-combing machine; it was in 1814 that
Stephenson’s “Puffing Billy” was put on the
rails. There is no better test of the people’s
social condition than the movement of
population. In 1801 there were 8,800,000
people in England and Wales. By 1831
there were already 13,900,000. Within 50
years the population had more than doubled.
The question is asked again and again
whether any system could be worse than
one which produces millions of unemployed.
Certainly it could be. The very rapidity with
which these millions have come into exist-
ence is the best evidence that normally the
people are living under good conditions. A
nation does not multiply quickly otherwise.
A far worse system would be one under
which the millions of unemployed would
never have been born.
It is admitted that under our competitive
system, which has been responsible for the
extraordinary results of the past 150 years,
great reserves of wealth are created and left
in the hands of the individual. But it has
been shown also that these reserves are
drawn upon to sustain the people through a
period of temporaiy breakdown or mal-
adjustment. The same reserves, not other-
wise drawn upon, are available to restore
the industrial service. The chief mischief
Lang and other “socialisation” propagan-
dists have done is that they have prevented
the reserves from doing their natural work.
It may be possible to restore prosperity
otherwise. The little group of Bolshevists
in Russia assert that it can be done; and
their Five-year Plan has been adopted
accordingly. In place of competition and its
rewards for success they use compulsion,
with terrible punishments for failure. If
the new system were an assured success,
which, of course, it is not, it would still be
one which the British character would not
tolerate. Still less would the Australian
character.
With heavy clouds over us, there may
be some of us who feel that the com-
petitive system is wrong. But once let
those clouds disappear and prosperous con-
ditions return, and there is not one Aus-
tralian in 50 who would be willing to
renounce the system which offers rewards
for talent, aptitude, enterprise, thrift and
all those other qualities which mean .success.
LANG: STATESMAN OR BRAWLER?
It would be silly to pretend that Lang
has not a large following. N. S. Wales, which
has had a chance of testing his promises
and, moreover, has the wreck of a Savings
Bank on its premises, awaits only the oppor-
tunity to get rid of him; yet even here he
captures the large noisy crowd which loves
to listen to abuse and cannot distinguish
between the brave man and the braggart.
Outside N. S. Wales, however, there seems
to be no question at all that his influence
grows fast. Why? What do they think
the man stands for?
He stands for one thing and one thing
only that matters—revolt. As an Opposition
leader he had a large capacity for hitting a
head whenever it showed up on the other
side. But he never put forward anything
constructive. He had no policy. During
the election campaign he continued to hit
heads, and for the rest to deal in generali-
ties. All he was sure of was that neither
he nor the Labor party would have anything
to do with anything that had even a flavor
of repudiation. He found himself next
with a strong majority in the Assembly, and
still he was without a working plan. No-
body knows better than he where his weak-
ness lies. He knows he can no more sit down
and construct a policy to occupy a whole
Parliament than he can hope to be next
president of the Employers’ Federation or
the W.C.T.U. His programme has conse-
quently been a thing of shreds and patches.
He is incapable of making a study of any
measure that either he or any of his
Ministers sponsors. He was quite willing
to give his former Attorney-General a
chance to put through one of the most
comprehensive measures ever offered to an
Australian Parliament. Then Lysaght, being
a barrister, fell foul of another Minister who
made objectionable remarks about the
Chief Justice; and in his just anger he
resigned. Without a moment’s hesitation
this law-reform measure of the Govern-
ment’s was abandoned. Lang drowned it
with just as little feeling as another man
might drown a couple of blind kittens. The
gag is applied on every conceivable occa-
sion because Lang never knows enough
about his measures to explain or defend
them. How inept he is may be judged
from the amazing anomalies in the 55.-in-
the-£ tax bill which he prepared with the
special purpose of having it thrown out by
the Leg. Council.
He is so utterly incapable of any con-
structive work that he must quarrel with
somebody in order to hold public interest.
The Loan Council, the Premiers’ Confer-
ence, the Federal Government, the Com-
monwealth Bank board, the Leg. Council,
the Governor—they have all had their turn.
When the Premiers threshed out a policy
it was not in his nature to accept it —he
had to denounce it. Challenged to put
something in its place, he produced what
has come to be known as the Lang Plan.
He probably never gave it five minutes’
thought: he simply tossed together three
things which he guessed would go down with
the crowd, and trusted to “get away with
it” somehow. It was the weakest, stupidest
thing ever put forward as a national policy;
and Lang was probably the most surprised
man in Australia when it was remembered
a week afterwards. To do him justice, he
never advertised it. It was not' he who
talked about it as if it were something
inspired: all of that has been done by his
followers. Lang knows himself far too well
to put himself forward as a constructive
statesman.
And, anyway, he is much too shrewd not
to realise that this is the rebel’s hour. How
little disposed the crowd is to listen to the
mere builder we found out when Niemeyer
offered us his advice. When a man is
thrown out of a job and cannot find
another, nothing is more natural than that
he should feel that something is terribly
wrong with the world. How can our whole
political system be right, he asks, when
some have so much and others are in want
through no fault of their own? Of course
there is something wrong, terribly wrong.
And because so many of us feel like that
about it, the man who can shout curses
at the world in general—at Niemeyer, at
the banks, at his brother-Premiers, at the
Loan Council, at the Legislative Council,
at the Governor, at the press —is bound to
win applause. But where does it get us?
Something can be said for Communism.
It is any rate a definite programme. But
Lang’s “Plan” is a mere jumble of hap-
hazard ideas, and not enough of them to
amount to anything—just enough to be mis-
chievous; just enough to breed mistrust of
the future; just enough to wreck the Savings
Bank; just enough to threaten at one time
to wreck the Premiers’ scheme for restoring
order to the public finances, which must be
the first step towards restoring prosperity.
And it offers not a thing in the place of
what it destroys. Lang would not pay the
overseas creditor until he reduced his inter-
est. Well, Lang has left him entirely
unpaid for months past; and has it given
one man in N. S. Wales a job? He would
not pay Australian creditors more than
3 per cent. Well, he did not pay the
Savings Bank, which was a very large
creditor, even 1 per cent.; and has it not
thrown thousands more on to the dole,
which is itself now threatened?
N. S. Wales has pretty well got Lang’s
measure. It is now left for the other
States to sum him up. What Australia
needs to-day is constructive statesmen.
Lang is no more a constructive statesman
than he is an archangel. He is incapable of
even the smallest constructive measure, let
alone programme. His strength lies in
attack; and it is because he knows it that
he spends his political life in picking
quarrels, trusting thereby to distract atten-
tion from his constructive impotence. The
other States will be merely wasting precious
time in putting their trust in him for a
moment.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Crime of the Savings Bank.
Public ownership and control never got a
worse advertisement than the Government
Savings Bank of N. S. Wales has given it.
Let us trace rapidly the whole disgraceful
business.
First, the bank was put under Commis-
sioners, and that was supposed to free it
from political control. Of course it did and
does nothing of the sort; for the Commis-
sioners operate a machine supplied by the
Parliament, with additions made by Mini-
sters, and Ministers choose and appoint the
Commissioners, anyway. There is that
weak point even in the Commonwealth
Bank. Its policy is settled by a board
appointed • by Government. The last
appointment made was from the Melbourne
Trades Hall. In a few months another
director will retire. His place may be filled
by a second gentleman from the Trades
Hall; and in due time the Trades Hall
may rule the bank—provide d, of course, a
Labor Government happens to be on the
spot when the next two or three appoint-
ments have to be made. As for the
machinery which the G.S.B. Commissioners
had to work, a great deal of it was con-
demned by bankers. Both the Rural Bank
and the Homes Department did business
which no sane banker would touch; yet the
people’s money financed it. True, there was
a Government guarantee behind it all. This,
however, only meant that Smith, Brown
and Robinson put up the money, and
Robinson, Brown and Smith guaranteed that
it would be repaid. But, it is said, some-
body must help these people to buy farms
and homes. No doubt they should be
helped. But it is no sort of speculative
business to mix up with a savings bank.
The Government appears to have had
first call on the funds in any case. During
the past two years the Commissioners must
have felt that the Government was not a
good borrowing customer—that it had
already borrowed far too much. Yet appa-
rently they had to go on lending to this
bad customer. Other banks, though they,
too, were pressed to help, might have shut
down in time: as a matter of fact, they
did shut down—hard. But there was no
shutting clown in time for the Government
Savings Bank. Private ownership and con-
trol is still honoring the people’s cheques;
public ownership and control has pasted
‘Suspended” on its doors.
And, after the suspension, public owner-
ship and control made an even worse show-
ing. There were over 70 millions of the
people s money on deposit. The people, in
fact, provided the whole of the money with
which this bank carried on; there was no
share capital. Yet not one word of expla-
nation of how matters stood was offered to
them. No meeting of depositors was called;
the Commissioners made no statement. The
bank for all practical purposes consisted of
this 70 millions belonging to the people;
and the people were treated with contempt.
It is all a scandalous thing; and for their
silence the Commissioners deserve severe
censure.
Next, without consulting the depositors,
the real owners of this bank—the only
people with a financial interest in it—
various parties proceeded to discuss the
future. After no doubt valuing the assets,
the Commonwealth Bank and the Com-
missioners agreed upon the broad details
of a scheme. But again the depositors—the
real owners of the bank—were treated as
though they were dirt. No reference was
made to them at all; instead, the Lang
Government thought that the scheme ought
to be made more liberal. More liberal!
More liberal to whom? Not to the credi-
tors, the depositors, but to the principal
debtor—the Government!
Now Lang and his Ministers are asking for
a loan of 10 millions from the Common-
wealth Bank to enable the old milch cow
to be run into the bails again. When a
private concern fails to pay its debts, the
creditors decide what shall be done with it.
Under public ownership and control we have
the amazing spectacle of the principal
debtor impudently proposing to lay down
the terms under which the creditors’ funds
shall be dealt with!
Robbing Your Friends.
How far are public speakers and writers
entitled to advocate dishonesty and crime?
The matter is important, because members
of Parliament are travelling over most
of Australia on their free passes advocating
what they call the Lang Plan and elaborat-
ing it. At Moree Mr. D. Clyne, M.L.A.,
“said that Australia’s interest bill amounted
to £1,250,000 a week. If they could wipe
off their interest bill they could immediately
place in permanent employment 312,500
men at £4 a week. (Applause.)” Mr. Clyne
is not reported as having said frankly, “Let
us rob these people of their interest. Hav-
ing got their money, let us cheat them out
of the payment we agreed to make for it.
Let us be a nation of rogues.” But if he
did not mean just this, why say that, if they
could wipe off this bill, they could employ
all these men at £4 a week? And, if it was
not so understood, why the applause?
Apart from being as close to a plain
advocacy of crime as one can go, the clap-
trap Shows either the abysmal ignorance of
the man or his wicked willingness to mis-
lead the people. About half of the inter-
est on our public debt is payable in Aus-
tralia. Now, the abolition of that debt
would not add one penny to the wealth
of Australia or the money available for
the employment of labor in Australia. You
don’t reduce the amount of money in a
country by taking it from Brown the tax-
payer and handing it to Jones the owner
of Government bonds. Brown, it is true,
cannot now employ as much labor; but
Jones can employ more.
The foreign half of our debt is a differ-
ent matter. This money goes absolutely
out of the country—not in money, of course,
because we have none that others will
accept, but in money’s worth. For over 30
years The Bulletin has been trying to tell
Australia that foreign debt means a tre-
mendous draining-away of our resources;
and nobody listened with more eagerness
than the early Labor parties. That was
when they were in Opposition. When they
reached office and tasted the sweetness of
the foreign loan, they outraced every other
political party to the foreign pawnshop,
justifying themselves on the ground that
the money was urgently needed to carry
through that policy of public ownership and
control to which the party was pledged. In
15 years they more than doubled the over-
seas debts of the States—and it has to
be remembered that not a penny of that
was on account of the war; the Common-
wealth was and is wholly responsible for
the war debt.
Thus the very money whose owners it is
so impudently proposed to rook was bor-
rowed either by Labor or to carry out the
Labor policy. Is there one honest, self-
respecting Labor man in the country who,
in the face of that fact, will support this
suggested roguery? The Bulletin can
understand a man who hates war having not
much affection for those who put up the
money to prosecute wars. But any section
of the Labor party which advocates the
repudiation of debts incurred to put its own
policy into effect exhibits a moral turpi-
tude which can only be described as loath-
some.
Disarmament by Conversion.
Last year the Scullin Government did away
with compulsory military training (all that,
was left of it), “rationed” the instructional
staff (for two months in the case of war-
rant officers), and reduced the fighting ships
in commission to two cruisers and a flotilla-
leader, at the same time introducing a ban
on immigrants from the south of Europe.
This year it announces that the strength of
the militia must not exceed 30,000, as
against 47,500 when it took office; that there
will be no camps of training; that H.M.A.S
Tattoo is being substituted for H.M.A.S.
Anzac, being cheaper and weaker; and that
by these and other “economies” it will save


THE FRIEND OF THE POOR.
“Trust Jack Lang to do his job for the Government Savings Bank depositors."— Beasley, M.P.
THE SPRUIKER: “Lang got your money out of the Savings Bank and spent it, you say? Well, what if he did? Ain’t he given you a lottery so you can win it back!”
another half-million. There have been
protests and warnings from the R.5.5.1.L.A.,
and from politicians like White,
and Sampson, the Tasmanian Senator, but
this Government of pacifists and race-
exclusionists goes on its fatuous course.
A message from Canberra shows how the
Defence estimates were dealt with in the
House of Representatives:—
The Defence Department vote was under considera-
tion shortly before five o’clock in the morning. Many
members, covered with rugs and blankets, were asleep
on both sides of the House. “Only IS awake!” ex-
claimed Mr. Gabb, gazing around the chamber. “No
wonder the country goes to the pack.” The vote
for the department was agreed to.
Another illuminating extract from the
report:—
Mr. Gabb moved that item, “World conference on
reduction and limitation of armaments, £2000,” be
deleted. Australia was practically disarmed. He
was against those picnics overseas.
The Prime Minister said that Australia had given
an example to the world by disarming, but having
done that she should go to tile conference and try
to induce other nations to disarm.
The item was agreed to by 88 votes to 9.
Australia is not the only country which
has “given an example to the world by dis-
arming.” Britain has ventured on the same
path, with so little influence on other
nations that even the British Labor Govern-
ment has confessed its disappointment and
shown signs of being alarmed. No doubt
a fluent Labor politician with a great belief
in his persuasive powers will be chosen to
go abroad and play up the £2OOO. He will
figure as the representative of 6i million
people occupying 2,974,581 square miles in
Australia and another 180,000 square miles
of dependencies. It is easy to imagine the
gentleman preaching the beauties of dis-
armament to the delegates from (1) Japan,
with 65 million people inhabiting 147,657
square miles; (2) Italy, with 42 million
people inhabiting 119,714 square miles;
and (3) Germany, with 65 million people
inhabiting 180,976 square miles—all three
warlike nations without overseas outlets for
their surplus population.
These infatuated theorists! These over-
grown schoolboys, playing at running a
country and fancying that overcrowded
peoples, armed to the teeth and ambitious,
will accept their copybook maxims!
Conversion and Necessitous Cases.
When a great conversion scheme was pro-
posed by the Premiers, in order that the
rich might make a sacrifice which the poor
had already suffered or were to suffer, it
was said that special consideration would be
given to the very small holders who could
show that they would be embarrassed by it.
A good many such cases soon came to light.
In one typical instance an old couple, with
no more than £3OO in the world, had been
persuaded that it was a patriotic duty to
remove their money from a savings bank
and put it into a short-dated loan. The
interest was of far less concern to these
people, and to most others in a like position,
than early access to their capital. Now it
in a few overgrown cities, the following is
an illustration: —
Peace Debt pee Inhabitant.
1891. 1929. Increase.
Westralia . . £3O 5 6 £l7O 6 9 £l4O 1 3
S. Australia . . 62 9 11 162 13 6 100 3 7
N. S. Wales. . 45 10 8 109 12 9 64 2 1
Tasmania . . 46 11 10 106 16 1 60 4 3
Victoria . . 37 14 4 88 5 1 50 19 9
Queensland . . 73 12 5 122 5 5 48 13 0
This increase of debt, which has been out
of all proportion to increase of population,
had no connection whatsoever with the war.
The amount owing by reason of that dis-
turbance was, in 1929, £45 3s. 2d. per inhabi-
tant, and is quite a separate account. The
question arises whether increase of loan
spendings and increased swelling of the one
big city where politicians sit and borrow and
spend the money are in any way connected.
An outstanding feature is that Westralia
heads the list in both cases, which may be
partly explained by the fact that it didn’t
enjoy fully-blown responsible government
till 1890, and hardly entered into full enjoy-
ment till Bigjohn Forrest’s Ministry took
office at the end of that year. In its
restricted days Westralia lagged behind
both in congestion and in mortgaging its
future, but in subsequent years it has done
its best to make up for lost time, and no
one can say that its neighbors have done
badly.
The Australian Navy.
Dear Bulletin, — I must contest your state-
ment (B. 29/7/’3l) that “the Admiralty
favored the R.A.N. from the first.” The
“Australian Encyclopaedia” says of the
Imperial Conference of 1909: “Australia
adopted wholeheartedly a suggestion made
rather grudgingly by the Admiralty that
she should provide and maintain one 'unit’
of a Pacific Fleet.” The decision to estab-
lish a separate navy was made at a time
when thinking people were seriously per-
turbed by the extent to which successive
English Governments had permitted the
R.N. to decline. Australia’s decision to
build, equip and man her own navy was,
like Maoriland’s gift of a battle-cruiser,
intended as a gesture—and an excellent one.
As such it has served its purpose, and the
continued maintenance of anything more
than a training-ship in the present state
of Australia’s finances is both uneconomical
and foolish. On the outbreak of war every
active unit of the R.A.N. will be immedi-
ately handed over to the Admiralty for use
wherever the ships may be required. Aus-
tralia may not see them from the beginning
of the war to the end. Why not hand them
over now and make certain that in an
Empire navy there will be absolute unifor-
mity of training, esprit de corps, pay, pen-
sions, leave and conditions and prospects
generally?
Regarding the question of sea-sense, is
it seriously suggested that this will not be
just as well fostered per medium of an R.N.
squadron as of a separate navy?
I do not, however, advocate the subsidis-
ing of an R.N. squadron; I advocate the
expenditure of funds available for naval
appears that no provision has been made to
meet such cases.
This, which is surely an oversight, threat-
ens to inflict hardship upon a considerable
number of very worthy people—people who
came with their few precious pounds to the
help of their country in response to such
appeals as Mr. Lyons made when the 28-
million loan was floated last year. The
conversion plan was never intended to reach
them: these are people who have made
their sacrifices otherwise—through cuts in
wages or loss of employment in most
instances. And all that the country could
possibly gain is not worth considering.
If necessitous cases cannot be met without
an amendment of the Conversion Bill, it
ought to be amended. If it can be done
without it, there should be a prompt an-
nouncement to that effect.
q
Australia’s Congested Capitals.
A great deal has been written, and with
good reason, about the huge and increasing
percentage of Australia’s population that
is crowded into its State capitals, and the
small percentage that is left for settlement
outside. And comparatively little has been
written concerning the when and the why
of this movement, not towards towns in
general, which is common enough, but
towards the governing town in each State,
which is a Australian characteris-
tic. . To take 1891 as a starting point, the
State capitals have grown in this fashion:—
Percentage op State’s Population.
1891. 1929. Increase.
Perth . . . . 10.97 48.68 31.71
Sydney . . . . 33.86 49.99 16.13
Adelaide. . . . 41.59 55.99 14.40
Melbourne . . 43.05 57.30 14.25
Brisbane . . 23.79 34.23 10.44
Hobart . . . . 22.81 26.25 3.44
The Australian State capital is always the
largest town in the State, but its supremacy
in bloat varies. In Tasmania it is a mild
bloat (mild for Australia), Hobart being
only twice the size of Launceston, which
comes next. In Westralia the big city
(Perth) is nearly 40 times the size of
Boulder, which ranks second. In this
respect Australia differs from the States
of the Yankee republic, where the capital
is almost invariably a secondary town; it
differs also from Maoriland, from Scotland,
Italy and a few other places here and there.
The Australian State capital is the place
where the overwhelming bulk (in value)
of the State’s importing and exporting is
done; in N. S. Wales Sydney has about
984 per cent, of the foreign trade, although
it has good harbors neglected and disused.
Then the Australian State capital is the
headquarters of all the banks barring one
unpretentious concern which has its address
at Ballarat, of life and fire insurance busi-
ness, of railway management, and of the
land business and other business of a large
area, a remarkably large one in most cases.
And the State capital is the place where
State borrowing (on a scale unknown any-
where else in the world) and public swind-
ling are attended to. As to borrowing and
its nefarious effect in promoting congestion
defence on the construction of a dockyard
base. On this and other aspects of the
question, a quotation from Admiral Sir
Cyprian Bridge on “The Share of the Fleet
in the Defence of the Empire,” written in
1907, puts the matter far better than can
any words of mine:—
Badgering our fellow-subjects beyond sea for money-
payments towards the cost of the Navy is undignified
and impolitic.... There are other ways in which
every trans-marine possession of the Crown can lend
a hand towards perfecting the efficiency of the fleet
■ —-ways, too, which would leave each in complete
and unmenaced control of its own money. Sea-
power does not consist entirely of men-o’-war. There
must be docks, refitting establishments, magazines
and depots of stores. Ports, which men-o’-war must
visit at least occasionally in war for repair or
replenishment of supplies....
—Yours, X. N. 0.

The Dole as a Vested Interest.
From an old Tasmanian contributor:—
Our State Parliament lately authorised £45,000
for unemployed relief after some (mostly platitu-
dinous) discussion. Apparently not a thought was
given to providing the unemployed with the means of
employing themselves at something better than dole-
gathering, though the unemployment figures have
now reached nearly 30 per cent.
Within easy walking distance of every town in Tas-
mania (and, for that matter, almost all over Aus-
tralia) productive land is held idle, and in every
town there are idle men willing and able to make
productive use of that idle land. Pressing State and
municipal authorities recently for reasons against
making a business-like attempt to bring some of
these idle hands and idle lands together, writer and
others sorrowfully conclude that reverence for vested
interests is still stronger than the desire for decent
citizenship, far more powerful than the promptings
of humanity, and in some instances apparently more
compelling than the instinct of self-preservation itself.
Public men are genuinely afraid of “disturbing-
existing rights,” of “diverting trade from its ordinary
channels.”
They say: “Suppose we could acquire the land,
and suppose the unemployed were willing and able
to produce from it the things you mention, and
suppose they carried the products to town and
hawked them from door to door, what would happen?
The regular producers and traders in these lines
would be injured, shops would have to close up
or shorten hands, and would be unable to pay rates
or taxes or rent, and banks and other mortgagees
would have to foreclose, and there would be trouble
all round. And, anyway, it is impossible. The
Government would have to buy the land at a high
price, fence it, and supply tents and tools and
building materials. And then they couldn’t compete
with the Chinese, though the Chinese pay higher
ground rents than any white man could pay.”
Turning from the regular and traditional worship-
pers of Vested Interests in despair, writer listened
at a gathering of Communist orators, and mentioned
the land settlement" notion. “Aw, no!” the comrade
in charge roared, “we want none of them camou-
flarged ca-palistic stunts. We’re city wawkers, we
are, not farmers, or pig-breeders, or vegable China-
men. We maintain that it’s the jooty of the capalis-
tic Guv’ment to find wawk fer the wawkers at their
reg’lar jobs, where they live. And if they won’t
find us the wawk we want at the basic wage, so’s
we can pay rent and keep our fam’lies decent,
then we’ll take the dole, Comrades, and we’ll pay
no rent.” (Loud applause for the speaker, and
scornful looks and a few jeers at the simple
citizen who had suggested giving unemployed chaps
a bit of land to produce ham and eggs as a change
from dole rations.)
One hardly expected to discover respect for the
dole as a Vested Interest. Still, there you are.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Federal Nats., in their folly, chose a
one-time Labor politician to lead their Sena-
tors and another, who came over a few
months ago, to be their chief in the Reps.
Naturally these gentlemen are eager to score
off their former friends and thus to show
their former enemies what clever fellows
they are; but they made an egregious mess of
things when they set out to refuse the Gov-
ernment supply for more than three months.
Lyons had the bad taste to taunt < Scullin
with having adopted the Opposition’s finan-
cial policy—a thing which Latham would
never have done. Scullin’s defence was most
effective, and the attackers melted away when
Paterson, Page’s deputy, said that the Prime
Minister and his followers were imperilling
their political lives by carrying out the Pre-
rtiiers’-conference plan and the Country
party would not let them down.
The Nats, will have to drop either Lyons
or Pearce. Pearce, for preference ; his bit-
terness against his old party not only makes
it difficult to secure united action in support
of the rehabilitation scheme but weakens
the effect of the Senate’s moves against the
Government in other matters.
Some of the “rank and file”—women
especially, it is said—-still believe the old
" What’s he supposed to be? A saint or a
crook?”
“A dash of both. He represents a N. S.
Wales Premier ready for a visit to the
Loan Council.”
story that the Lang Government could bring
salvation to the State, only the banks won’t
let it. Well, when a woman wants to see
if an iron is too hot she doesn’t dab all
her fingers on it; she tries it with the tip of
one finger, and if it burns that one she
guesses it isn’t necessary to damage the
other nine. The Lang Government had all
the control that it wanted of one bank; and
tens of thousands of depositors in the busted
institution are on the dole in consequence.
What would be the sense of burning the
other nine fingers?
Chief Sec. Tunnecliffe tried his hand on a
Bridget in Vic. Assembly last week, Hogan
being away ill. The job was made easy for
him, as the Acting-Gov. (Irvine) “trans-
mitted” the supplementary estimates and the
Treasury officials prepared three sheets of
typewritten summary for the temporary Min-
ister for Finance to read. It was known
already that the deficit for 1930-31 was
£2,615,000, and that the railways were re-
sponsible for just on £1,500,000 of it.
Exchange and losses on soldier- and closer-
settlement amounted to £95,000 more
than the debit balance on general account.
Tunnecliffe reeled off the depressing tale in
10 minutes.
The Queensland Ministerial party has
agreed to reduction of Assembly members
from 72 to 62. A redistribution commission
is to be appointed at once, as an election
is due in May. But the party meeting,
though discussing the matter, still dodged
a final decision on the re-establishing of the
Leg. Council, a question far more important
than the wiping out of Assembly seats,
Forbes’s new taxes, unpalatable as they
may be to the frugal-minded Maorilanders,
are merely homoeopathic compared with Aus-
tralian standards. Primage duty on imports
moves up from 1 p.c. to 3 p.c., and there are
to be small imposts on tea and sugar. The
income-tax exemption drops from £3OO to
£260; the surtax rises from 10 p.c. to 30
p.c. The Maorilander with an earned in-
come of £lOOO who used to pay £34 13s.
will now pay £37 3s. 2d. If he lived in
N. S. Wales he would pay £74, in Vic. £72,
in Queensland £llO, in S.A. £ll5, in W.A.
£6l 10s., in Tas. £66 10s., these being Com-
mon wealth-ciim- State imposts.
Lang is afraid to tell his dupes how many
unemployed he has, though the British
Government, with 18 times as many people
to deal with, publishes precise information
on the subject every week. When intro-
ducing his “emergency” 55.-in-the-£ tax he
sa d there were “about
100,000”; but he gave
that as the number in
Bavin’s time, and prom-
ised to employ them all.
Acting-Statistician Gib-
lin reports that 30 p.c.
of N.S.W. unionists
were workless in the

“capitalistic” Govern-
ment is) in power. The
“Worker’s” staggering
estimate is that N.S.W.’s
jobless army numbers
200,000, and is increas-
ing at. the rate of 3000
a week.
Perth “Mirror” has
brought to light about
the choicest example of
political deadheadism on
record. In 1920 a cer-
tain Hugh Mahon was
expelled from the House
of Reps, for disloyalty,
and on appealing to his
Ivalgoorlie constituents
was rejected. But he
had been a Cabinet
Minister, and Cabinet
Ministers regard them-
selves as a class apart.

Gordon Webber, who in some future Vic.
Labor Ministry will hold a bigger job than
that of Assistant-Minister, is against the
dole system, which satisfies the Slangs be-
cause they are incapable of thinking out a
better. It is expected that £3,100,090 will
be available this financial year for unem-
ployed relief (£1.500,000 from the special
taxes and £1,600,000 from loan, if the Scul-
lidores raise the wind for the States), and
Webber wants the beneficiaries to give the
equivalent in work. He invites local autho-
rities to co-operate, promising them subsi-
dies if they will provide for specified num-
bers of men on projects well “rationed.” Of
course there are critics who are asking
“What’s the good of a day and a half or
two days’ work a week?”
J. B. Cramsie and J. P. Osborne, who
have been on Sydney’s Meat Board for many

they had been superseded, that being the

His qualifications are unquestionable, but he
is liable to be outvoted by the two Domain

GENERAL HUTT: “Yes; I move that this

spouters, A. D, Kay and F. C. Hutt,
whom Slang has associated with him. Kay
is, of course, the gasbag who sold his Assem-
bly seat to the first Slang Government for
a job on the Meat Board and was removed

date and a leader of “the Labor army.”
Perhaps the extraordinary pair will decide
to hold board meetings in the Domain.
Queensland, which has a crop estimated
at 6,000,000 bushels in sight, is not worry-
ing because the Senate has asked the Sculli-
dores to withdraw their Wheat Marketing
Bill and substitute a sales tax on wheat and
flour. The State Government has done much
for growers by guaranteeing a price of 4s.
per bushel and extending the Sugar Acqui-
sition Act to flour. If Queensland has to
enter into an agreement with the proposed
Australian board the two plans seem cer-
tain to come into conflict.

Tas. Assembly, having put through the
emergency measures agreed to by the Pre-
miers, is taking six weeks’ holiday on reduced
pay while the budget is being prepared. The
Labor Opposition objected to the non-inclu-
sion of banks in the interest-reduction
measure, and there was also some difference
of opinion about building societies. Some
Ministerial supporters showed signs of res-
tiveness in regard to these matters, but in the
end only one (Hobart’s Mayor Soundy)
voted with the Ogilvies to include bank
interest, so everything went through as per
schedule.
A bill to increase unemployment is the
latest legislative effort of _ the duffer and
interest-defaulter and deficiteer and bank-
wrecker who is ruining N. S. Wales. It
isn’t called a bill to increase unemployment,
but if it becomes law there will be wholesale
dismissals of cooks, “generals,” housemaids,
handymen, gardeners, car-drivers, garage
hands and teachers not in State employ; for
the design is to reduce all Government
salaries in excess of £5OO p.a. to that figure.
Thus the Chief Justice will get the same as
his associate; the Commissioner of Police
will draw a second-class inspector’s pay; the
Chief Commissioner of Railways will be
reduced to the salary-level of a minor
accountant; and so on. But the bill does
not apply to railwaymen covered by Federal
awards, and all employees on or below the
£260-p.a. mark, from whom one-twelfth was
taken last year, are to get the one-twelfth
back. It is asserted that the “savings” will
amount to £1,850,000, but loss of income tax
and increase of pensions and dole expendi-
ture have been left out of the reckoning. It
is alleged also that the crazy scheme con-
forms to the “letter and spirit of the Mel-
bourne agreement,” but this is the customary
Lang-plan lie.
“I am not sure that Mr. Lang is not
right,” said the preacher. “Do you remem-
ber what Christ did? He fed the hungry
vrith good things, but the rich He sent empty
away.” And a good idea, too. The main
difference between Christ and Jack is that
Christ fed the hungry, while Jack only busts
the bank and makes thousands hungrier.
Members of the Australian Journalists’
Association are being bombarded with cir-
culars urging them to vote “Yes” to a pro-
posal for shifting the headquarters of the
institution from Melbourne to Sydney. The
reason assigned is that Sydney is “the battle-
ground of the industrial trouble,” which may
mean that it is nearer than Melbourne is
to Lang and his trouble-makers. The appeal
of the “Yes” party, issued from the Sydney
office, speaks of the “unfederal and unsports-
manlike action of a disgruntled Victorian
delegate” in having the proposed removal,
referred to a vote of members. That is
dashed like Lang, who also gets wild and
throws Language about when anyone wants
to have anything put to a popular vote.
When The Bulletin thinks of what Aus-
tralian banks have done during the past 20
years and what they might have done, it
wonders whether there is a single hungry
wolf left among the directors. In the old
days, when wolves were aplenty, the Com-
mercial of Sydney used to pay a 25 p.c.
div.: it did that as a steady thing for IT
years. In 1900 it paid 10 p.c., after a pom'
time in the ’nineties, and it has never paid
more since. From £2 2s. in 1900 the basic
wage climbed to £4 11s. as the cost of living
mounted; but though the cost of living
mounted for the bank shareholder just as
it did for everybody else, the div. rate wasn’t
lifted —the shareholder got only his £lO p.c.
even though it was not worth more than
£4-odd had been a few years previously.
Queensland Premier Mooi*e scandalised the
old roads-and-bridges brigade the other day.
A Darling Downs member tried to get a
grant for improving the road between Brisbane
and Toowoomba, and when the cadge was
turned down yelped that the refusal would
cost the Government a lot of votes. Moore
came back with the remark that if the mem-
ber’s constituents held political views which
depended as to their color on whether or
not a road was made for them at other
people’s expense, they were not worth a
decent Government’s attention. The shock-
ing heresy was received in flabbergasted
silence.
Taxpayers are being fleeced so mercilessly
nowadays, and with so much patient resig-
nation on their part, that apparently it is
thought they will stand anything. Under
Federal income-tax law State tax actually
paid may be deducted from taxable income,
but the Federal department holds that “the
deduction is limited to that tax which
is described in State laws as ‘income
tax’; claims for deduction of taxes which
are described as ‘unemployment-relief taxes’
are therefore being rejected.” Yet this dis-
ingenuous department knows —none better —
that the unemployment-relief taxes are all
income taxes; in N. S. Wales salary- and
wage-earners pay Is. in the £ on their gross
income for the week, though the next week
they may draw nothing. Victoria —always
more considerate to taxpayers than the
tricky Federal concern —allows its un-
employment tax as a deduction. N. S.
Wales not only levies income tax on
what a man pays in unemployment tax,
but demands unemployment tax on “in-
come derived by a resident of N. S. Wales
from sources outside the State”—-income
already subject to Federal tax, Vic. State
tax (assuming the income was derived in
Victoria) and Vic. unemployment tax. This
is not only a cold-blooded swindle on the
individual; it is a constitutional outrage.
“Titus Salt” : The great ambition of Pre-

SOCIETY
"and it's

WIMBLE'S INKS”
“P.X.”: Jim Grahame, Henry Lawson’s
shy mate of long ago and the good friend
who looked after him in his subsequent Lee-
ton days, came down to Sydney for the
unveiling of Henry’s statue; and the dog
caught his eye. “That isn’t Henry’s dog,”
he said: “it couldn’t be.” Next day he read
in The Bulletin that the only dog Henry
would have taken any interest in was a
hungry, homeless mong.—for that he would
be likely to buy a meat-pie with his last
tuppence. “I don’t know about the meat-
pie,” Jim Grahame whispered, “but I remem-
ber about the sausages. We were camping
together, and Henry had bought the evening
meal. On the way home the wreck of a
dog trailed us. ‘Looks hungry,’ said Henry,
nodding at the hound, and partly unwrap-
ping the sausages. Perhaps Henry meant to
give him only one; but the poor brute was
so wolfish that Henry had emptied the paper
before he said, ‘Jim, there’s a bit o’ cold
meat left, isn’t there?’ And that was our
meal. It’s not much use telling you what
I think of the statue; but I don’t mind tell-
ing you that that sleek Alsatian isn’t Henry’s
dog.”

“.Clifford Snook” : A sensation which has
spread all the way from Dublin concerns
the ferocious ill-treatment of some children
by their stepmother, who was, and presum-
ably still is, their aunt, their, father having
married his deceased wife’s sister. I think
the combination is a bad one. In my opinion
a man is quite right in marrying a deceased
wife’s sister, provided she is the sister of
somebody’s else’s deceased wife, not of his
own. If he marries her in the first place
she will be a mother, unless the pair have
the misfortune to be childless, and not a
stepmother. Theoretically they must both
be childless if one of them is. just as both
twins must be twin if one of them is, but
that is a side issue. I also regard it as
advisable for a man to marry a deceased
mother’s daughter so as not to have a
mother-in-law, but not his own mother s
daughter, as the Egyptian kings used to do.
This opens up the problem whether a
ought to enter into the holy estate of matri-
mony with a defunct uncle’s nephew, and
it seems highly advisable if he left his money
to the nephew, and especially if she never
met the uncle and doesn’t know what a dis-
agreeable character he was. As a general
thing stepmothers should be avoided, though
they weren’t so bad in polygamous times,
when the real mother might be alive to
defend her children against the step. A
case in point is to be found in Genesis,
where Isaac’s stepmother was thrown out
before Isaac was born, being chased into the
desert by his own prospective lady-parent.
Isaac wasn’t a stepson, but he was on the
verge of being stepped. Occasionally a small
stepmother lias a bad time, having married
into a family which is too large and ferocious
to be managed, but despite occasional hap-
penings of the sort she is a lady who gets
little consideration.

“Exdig”: Now that the war-gas argument
has been revived, it is worth recalling that
before the innovation was adopted on the
Western Front, Major Morton, of the A.1.F.,
suggested on Gallipoli that the Turks might
be driven out of their trenches with easily
broken bombs of poisonous gases. The sug-
gestion was received with horror at H’.Q. as
something opposed to all the ethics of civil-
ised warfare. Actually the French were
the first to give the new weapon a trial,
but their experiments were failures; then
the Germans sprang their big surprise. The
Canadians got the worst of that—a cousin
of my own went out with all his company.
Towards the end of the war, even the chil-
dren went to school carrying their masks;
and I have seen kids making a game of
getting their masks on. But they—like “2nd
Divvy’s” Diggers, who played billiards dur-
ing a gas attack (B. 29/7/’3l) —weren’t m
the line, waiting for the next act.

“Eugene”: Adelaide’s latest wife-murderer
—a young “trammie” and former policeman
—who buried his victim’s corpse under the
fowlhouse and shot himself dead when in-
quisitive police made it clear that they in-
tended to dig up his back premises, at least
evaded the mental torture that a practi-
tioner of the same plan underwent in Perth
some 20 years ago. He also had murdered one
young wife so that he might take another,
and had invented the usual story about No. 1
having gone away and never returned. But
the police presently found enough evidence
to arrest him, and to secure repeated remands
on, while they dug for more. Unfortu-
nately for themselves they did most of the
digging in all sorts of wrong places, making
frequent excursions into the bush to dis-
turb the landscape; unfortunately for the
prisoner they happened on the right one at
last. It was in the very builder’s yard where
he had worked, and where pick-and-shovel
operations had first been started and after-
wards abandoned for weeks. What the mur-
derer’s feelings must have been as the hunt
swung in the wrong direction and then tardily
swung back into the right one can only be
conjectured.

“Lex” : A sound film was recently admitted
as evidence, for the first time in Australia,
by Irvine, C.J., of Victoria. There was no
opposition. Yet the fight against the admis-
sion of photographs lasted for years in
England and some U.S.A. Courts are still
hostile to dictaphones. Telephone conver-
sations are regarded with suspicion every-
where, a result being that ill-disposed per-
sons can slander their enemies over the
’phone with impunity. It is supposed to be
harder to identify a telephone than a dicta-
phone voice. In the Melbourne case a lady
is claiming heavy damages against a dairy-
man whom she accuses of keeping her awake
by banging milkeans. A talkie has been
made of the alleged offence, and a jury will
be asked to listen to it if the matter comes
to trial. The possible variations of the inno-
vation are so numerous that a theatrette for
every court is a possibility of the future.

has never yet prevented any R.N. ship em-
ployed on her ordinary duties from carrying
a sufficient rum ration to last out the longest
cruise. French and Italian matelots toast
their sweethearts in wine, and that must
take up very much more room ; and an R.N.
ship on this station not so very long ago
ran a wet canteen to the extent of a bottle
of beer per man per day over an interval'

The law insists
on adequate ser-
vice, one essen-
tial of which is
that the purport

forth. There was

to his own satis-
faction, by thump-
ing the document

tering it on his

a laconic “That’s for you, then!” The
Court decided that this was not proper ser-
vice ; what the lady thought of it is not

“Cosmos”: Melbourne is the only big city
I know that has first-class hotels and clubs
in both its east and west ends. Also it is
the only city near the million-mark with
no hotels of note in its residential areas,
and it is the most under-flatted of modern
cities for its size. London’s best hotels are
practically all massed between the Strand
and Piccadilly, and nine-tenths are within a
few minutes’ walk of Mayfair. Paris has
none outside the Rue de Rivoli-Bois area;
Sydney’s are concentrated in the neighbor-
hood of Castlereagh-street; and so on.
Another peculiarity of Melbourne is its
absence of restaurant-life as Europe under-
stands it. Sydney has had several restau-
rants that would do credit to London or
New York (the Ambassadors, as originally
organised, was one), and dozens have risen
and fallen, during the past half-century, in
which the dishes were as good and the prices
as low as in many Soho eating-houses. So
Sydney usually strikes overseas visitors as
a metropolis and Melbourne as a big coun-
try town —an impression which is added
to by Melbourne’s wide streets and low build-
ings. I heard a member of the last press
delegation say, “Sydney is the plainest city
on earth for its advantages ; Melbourne is
the handsomest for its disadvantages.”

“D.”: There is at least one Yankee insti-
tution advertised by the talkies that Aus-
tralia should copy—the cop on the motor-
bike. Four-fifths of the week-end accidents
round our big cities are caused by uncon-
trolled road-hogs, usually tight. On a
recent Sunday evening, for example, I was
in a line of Sydney-bound cars on the speed-
way outside Collaroy when a limousine full
of yelling lads arrived from behind at 50
m.p.h. or more, cut in all along the line
and disappeared in a cloud of blasphemy
from those who had had to risk smashes
dodging it. With proper traffic supervision
the driver either wouldn’t have reached us,
or would have been stopped later on. As it
was, he almost certainly hit someone or
something before he sobered up. In the
U.K., with its wide, straight roads, repu-
table owners of fast cars sometimes go after
drunks who are driving to the public danger,
head them off and proceed against them.
But it wouldn’t do here for many obvious
reasons. The cop on a bike, with a fire-
engine’s right of way, is our only remedy.
Half a dozen, stationed at suitable points
outside a city like Sydney, would bring down
week-end casualties by 50 per cent.

“Endless Chain”: Certain sagacious
gentlemen in Amsterdam who call them-
selves the “Credit iContinental” have recently
been introducing the Maoriland public to a
new and fascinating game, described as an
“excellent opportunity to earn money with-
out money.” The first step is to buy a
“claim,” from anyone who has one to sell,
for a guilder (a prosaic Is. Bd. will do).
You then send this claim to Amsterdam,
accompanied by a ss. money order, and you
receive four claims of a certain color, the
first color of a series of six. You sell those
four claims for Is. Sd. each, receiving 6s. Bd.,
which recoups your outlay, and you must
see to it that each of the purchasers sends
five bob and buys four claims, which will
be of color No. 2. You have now done your
part, and you won’t hear from the Credit
Continental again, unless, in the opinion of
that body of upright burghers, you have won
a prize of 2000 guilders (about £165). You
will win such a prize, according to the
prospectus, if the chain of ticket purchasers
inaugurated by your sale of four claims
endures without a break to the sixth color.
Should that happen there is no reason why
the C.C. shouldn’t cough up. Through your
instrumentality £1365 ss. will have been sent
GUARANTEED.
CUSTOMER: “But it’s got moth-holes in it!”
IKE: “My dear feller, that shows you—der moths vouldn't look at it
unless it vas der best vool!”
to Amsterdam, and there will be a gross
profit to the promoters of £l2OO ss. even if
they pay you. But you can’t very well prove
whether the chain has been broken or not—
before you qualify for a prize it has to be
extended by 6460 links —and the odds are
largely against the scheme enduring that
long. If it managed to run twice through
the series of six colors it would exhaust by
a substantial margin the population of
Maoriland, and if it got through three times
there would be over 7,000,000,000 claim-
holders ; which, as Euclid would remark, is
absurd.

“Kerys” : Ships aren’t the only things that
can overrun and smash up a helper in need.
Not long ago a big F.N. car became dis-
abled on the top of Mt. Eden, Auckland.
Assistance was sought from the handiest,
garage, and a nearly-new Buick arrived to
take its larger rival in tow. They progressed
quite well until they struck a really steep
piece of track. Then the F.N., putting on
speed, bumped the Buick and urged it to
hurry, after which spectators were treated
to a mad race down the mountain by the
two cars, the bigger finally toppling itself
and its helper over a cliff. The F.N. was
badly damaged; the other was a wreck.

“M. or N.”: Sophia-street in Waterloo
(Sydney) is trying to live down its past,
and has put it to the City Council that a
change of name would be the most effective
method of “improving conditions and
enabling owners to let their properties.”
But the city fathers proved irrespon-
sive ; possibly they consider that a thor-
oughfare bearing the name of a saint
should be left to work out its own salvation
by deeds, and that no mere change of label
would make it smell sweeter right away.
Things like that have a tendency to right
themselves, or stay wrong. A quarter of a
century ago Kalgoorlie’s Brookman-street
was the last word in scarlet sin. Coun-
cillors sought to give the notorious
thoroughfare, or the least disreputable
part of it, a new coat of paint by
re-christening it Hay-street. But Brookman-
street, or “The Rue’’ (a euphemistic
alias) , remained pretty much as it was until
the steady decrease in the gold output lessened
the demand for its wares. That did what
no mere change of name could ever hava
effected.

“G.L.H.”: “2nd Divvy” (B. 22/7/’3i)
may be quite right in his figures regarding
the horsemanship of Italian and British
artillery and cavalry recruits, but he is very
far astray in his estimate of his own coun-
trymen’s capacity. The tests in Australian
camps in 1914 were farcical. Many good
horsemen were passed out because they
showed lack of respect for the brass-liat in
charge of proceedings; many others went
straight to infantry units without any
test whatever. Light I-lorse units, recruited
from city as well as country applicants, have
a record that will stand comparison with
any European cavalry. Polo may help the
Italian to put a bit of polish on his horse-
manship, but it can’t compare with cattle-
raising to produce first-class horsemen. This
country, even without the aid of polo or
hunt clubs, isi unlikely to go short of expert
riders as long as a large percentage 1 of the
population is directly engaged in pastoral
pursuits.

“Dog’s Nose” : Anyone in these degenerate
days know what a loggerhead is? I saw one
the other day which its proud possessor had

ton (Sydney). It is
an iron with a large
oval head on it, some-
thing like a tinsmith’s
tinning iron, but larger,

snatched up to be used as a weapon in beery

“Palaeolithic Pete”: These alleged prehis-
toric skulls are beginning to get confusing,
but I like to hear learned professors, whom
every fresh discovery seems to throw into
two camps, hurling at one another their
blasts of sarcastic derision. For instance,
Professor Elliot Smith, whose fame is
world-wide, suggests that the Jervois skull,
as described by Professor Colin Mackenzie,
is “merely that of a modern aboriginal Aus-
tralian which presents primitive characteris-
tics such as are not uncommon in this primi-
tive race, or it may be nothing more than
the skull of a mental defective.” It sounds
like an echo from the discussion that broke
up Bret Harte’s “Society Upon the Stanis-
laus,” and one gets an impression that these
learned men would be quite capable of heav-
ing prehistoric bones at one another in sup-
port of their theses. A curious by-phase of
the controversy is that one side seems to hold
that a slur is cast upon Australia by the
denial that human or quasi-liuman bones can
be found here as ancient as those which may
crop up in China or Sussex or Rhodesia. Yet
Professor Elliot Smith, himself, an Austra-
lian, is satisfied that the arrival of man
on this continent was comparatively recent,
as mons go.

“R.S.M.”: The old order changes. The
latest innovation in the British army is
the abolition of the old recruit drill whereby
each Johnny Raw was fashioned into a
replica of his fellows. No more will the
recruit be taught to stand to attention “heels-
togetheratanangleofforty-fivedegreeschestthro-
wnouttliesmallofthebackhollowedchinwellupey-
estothefrontarmsstraightdownbythesideoftheb-
ody littlefingersinaline witlithe seamofthetrou-
SERS.” His “individuality” is to be
studied, and he will be put through a series
of easy exercises “which involve no strain.”
It is on reading things like that that one
realises the wiping out of the Old Contemp-
tibles was a merciful dispensation of Provi-
dence.

“Casual”: The world seems to be full of
people of confiding uispositious and unstable
memories. Three years ago a Federal mem-
ber who had resigned his seat in favor < f
an aspirant from another State was asked
by a Royal Commission to account for the
possession of a large sum of money—an
article in which he had for years been
notably lacking. His explanation was that
he had won it by backing a Melbourne Cup
winner with a bookmaker whose name he
could not recall —and there the matter rests
to this day. Then there was the Sydney
alderman who earned an honest crust by
backing horses for friends on commission,
but who failed to remember the names of
either friends or horses. The latest of the
tribe was a witness in a Sydney bank-
ruptcy case who admitted that he had helped
the bankrupt to remove stock from a shop,
adding that he had done so for the sake of
protecting people who had lent. the embar-
rassed person money. He was, it appeared,
one of these himself, and having no banking
account had produced the loan from a tin.
The contents of this were mostly a sum won
by backing a winner at the pony races, a
man named Brown, whose address he did
not know, having executed the commission.
And so it goes on.

“Jesmond”: I nominate Harry Brown, of
the 22nd Battalion, as the oldest Digger
who saw service in the line. He was
wounded at Ville-sur-Ancre early in 1918,
when he was 69. I never saw him fall out
through exhaustion, and he was as supple
as men 40 years his junior. On his return
he was given a job as verger at St. Paul’s,
Melbourne, and when getting on towards
SO he climbed and painted the flagpole.

“Mells”: What incongruously-sounding
Christian names one is liable to encounter
in the most unlikely places and persons!
I sojourned once in a
mulga town where, a
Government official
ambled through life as
Ulysses and two pro-
fessional men had been
ticketed by their respec-
tive sponsors .Fneas
and Abelard. Ulysses
was a human compound
of red tape and rubber
stamp who knew little
of cities and less of
men; yon couldn’t pic-
ture him roaming seas or slaying suitors,
and his name was by pretty general
agreement distorted to “Useless.” iEneas
was meek, methodical, peaceful as they make
them, immersed in the petty routine of his
calling. Abelard was the only one who ran
at all true to type, but as he wasn’t a monk
his idiosyncrasies were less noticeable.
* $ * *
“Cassius”: What makes Benito Mussolini
so remarkable is that of all the post-war
dictators, real and would-be, he is the only
one who has endured. Woodrow Wilson
looked as if he counted more than any other
individual in the world at the time of the
Versailles Conference; but what a fleeting
sway was his! Lloyd George was the
supreme power in England for a few years;
so, for that matter, was Billy Hughes in
Australia; both flickered out in 1922. Of
course these may be regarded as consti-
tutional despots, but those who seized power
and didn’t care by what means they held it
have fared little better. Lenin might have
lasted had he lived; having died he could
only be deified. Primo de Rivera was at
one time represented as likely to do for
Spain what Mussolini was doing for Italy,
and at least he kept it from revolution a
few years; but he couldn’t stick. Mustapha
Kemal seems to be the only other one of the
post-war crop with any lasting quality, and
Kemal has been so long out of the news-
paper headlines that the world, outside of
Turkey, has ceased to take much interest
in him. Curious that Italy, of all countries,
should have produced the one stable dictator.
ONE UP.
“I don’t think you’re half as nice as Fred—he promises me all
sorts of nice things.”
“Humph!—and gives you nothing.”
“Well, anyway, he does the best he can —he promises."
“Jeames”: Britain has had a depresh—
i.e., super-taxation and millions on the dole
• —for years; and a feature of it is the
trouble it has brought on self-made men.
Lord Kylsant, who has been figuring in an
Old Bailey dock in connection with the
affairs of the R.M.S.P. Co., is the son of
a parson, and, though he married money,
he became a millionaire by his own efforts.
Lord Waring, who, according to Lord Brent-
ford, is to blame for the calamities that have
befallen Waring and Gillow, and is being
writted for £250,000, built up the big Oxford-
street furniture shop after starting from the
bottom in the ’nineties. Sir Arthur Wheeler,
Bart., who at 71 is being prosecuted for
fraud, has been one of London’s leading
stockbrokers for over 30 years. He used to
boast that he came to the city without a
shilling. A lawyer-peer, now in gaol, who
spent over £200,000, made (or stole) it
all; and the late Jimmy White, who is
understood to have got rid of at least
£1,000,000 before he suicided, wasn’t even
educated. If such men couldn’t see the dirty
financial weather ahead, who could? It
makes one feel more tolerant of our bone-
headed politicians.

“Perry Stalsis” : The first producer of fire-
water known to history (B. 22/7/’3l) was
a Greek physician, one Alexander of Aphro-
disias. in the second century B.C. A little
earlier, Dioscorides, father of pharmacists,
had invented the technical art of distillation,
and Alexander applied the process to wine.
The original manufacturer of ardent alco-
holic liquor was the German Hohenheim
(Paracelsus), who was found dead one morn-
ing in 1541 in his laboratory at Salzburg,
a victim of ovei’-indulgence in what is now
known as rectified spirits of wine. But
intoxicating effects similar to those of over-
proof spirit have from time. immemorial been
acquired by the dwellers in the forests of
north-eastern Asia, a people who knew no-
thing of brewing, fermentation or distilla-
tion. Their substitute for alcohol is the fly-
blown agaric, a brightly-colored, mushroom-
shaped fungus, known to botanists . as
Amanita muscaria, which they dry, roll into
a bolus and swallow without chewing. The
resulting jag, of which excessive garrulity
and uproarious hilarity are the chief out-
ward manifestations, lasts a full 24 hours.
$ $ * *
“Ilomfrey Reale”: When 11.M.A.T. Karoa
touched at Colombo on her only repatria-
tion trip to Australia in April, ’l9, we
found that. Diggers on previous boats having
celebrated too perfervidly, all pubs were
closed. News filtered through, however,
that all members of the A.I.F. of the
rank of sergeant and over would be wel-
comed at the Tommy sergeants’ canteen. The
native shops soon sold out of chevrons, and
W.O. crowns had a great run for a while.
When they also were exhausted the late-
comers had to take a chance with second-
lieutenant’s rank. I went out to Kandy
that afternoon, but I forget how many ele-
phants I bought.
* * * *
“Handyman”: How modern industrial
developments have discredited the political
economists! Most of the conclusions of
Bagehot (who edited the “Economist” half
a century ago) were based on what he called
the “transferability of labor.” If labor
were still transferable employers could do
practically anything without injuring the
workers—kill industries, foster monopolies,
and so on. But it isn’t. An unemployed
carter can no more turn his hand to, say,
wharf-luwning than he can practise as a
doctor. The unions have so regimented their
members that if one loses his job be has to
starve, or depend on quasi-charitable relief,
till he gets the job back or finds another
like it. And a non-unionist can’t get a decent
job at all, as a rule. The clever manual
worker used to be the most free of men. His
skill carried him and his family, if he had
one, anywhere. Now he is the most enslaved.
Government interference in industry, special-
ised work and unionism are responsible—but
chiefly unionism. It is the most effective
device for safeguarding dud toilers and hold-
ing back good ones that was ever invented.
• * *
“C. Coral”: Old
hands in Torres
Strait are begin-
ning to think that
some of the law-
lessness of a by-
gone period is re-
turn i n g. Quite
recently at least
two vessels have
been seized and
levanted with by
piratical white
men. One was a
fishing cutter; the
lessee, after secur-
ing- a crew of Japs
and New Guinea
boys, left Thursday
Island ostensibly
on a trochus-getting
expedition, and
then cleared out to
rife Aru Islands
(Dutch territory),
leaving a lamenting
owner. In the
other case a well-
appointed pleasure
launch, valued at
about £lOOO, was
commandeered at
Cairns by a trio of
hobos. The leader,
who has somewhat
of a reputation in
northern waters,
put his two mates
ashore at Naghir
Island, in Torres
Strait, and con-
tinued his voyage
alone to the Dutch
Indies. Natives
brought the two
marooned ship-bor-
rowers to Thursday
Island, where the
police collected
them; but the
launch got well
away. Neither the
police nor the Cus-
toms have a fast
vessel for pursuing
either boat thieves or opium-runners up north.
* # * *
“Canny Lad”: One result of the hard
times has been the cutting down of funeral
costs. Elaborate coffins of cedar and other
expensive woods are now being generally dis-
placed by. caskets of cheap pine cunningly
camouflaged by the art of the. Stainer and
grainer. In the case of cremations economy
is exercised in another direction. The rule,
of course, is that the coffin goes into the fur-
nace, but there is now an inner container of
plain, cheap wood. When the gorgeous
outer cover slides through the doors out of
sight of the mourners, the attendants remove
it, and after committing the plain coffin and
its contents to the flames, return the other
to the waiting undertaker. Only those on
the inside know what has happened.
* * * *
“Erua”: Those two’ young men who cher-
ished a lifelong grudge against cockatoos
didn’t dislike them any more than a woman
I know detested her small brother. She
was the youngest of a family of six until
“the tailpiece” was born, after which she
became nursemaid in chief for years. When
the infant was three she had the romance of
her life. One memorable afternoon her hero
lured her down to the summer-house,
obviously intent on proposing. She was all
a-thrill awaiting the momentous query when
“the tailpiece,” very dirty, and howling as
was his Wont, appeared. No amount of
coaxing, threatening or chivvying off affected
him: he stayed and continued to howl; and,
as it is out of the question to propose in
the presence of a howling brat, the young
man gave up. Next day a telegram sum-
moned him to another State to attend his
father’s deathbed, and after inheriting a for-
tune he married another. “The tailpiece” is
to-day a genial and popular legal luminary,
but his still unmarried sister never thinks of
him with anything but: intense dislike.
* * * *
“Mullarula” : Even if swords have not yet
been beaten into shares, a peaceful agricul-
tural use has been found for some of the
stores accumulated during the Great War. A
farm near Liverpool (N.S.W.) is now
encircled by a fence made from the wire
mattresses which once formed part of the
equipment of Liverpool military camp. They
were bought at a bargain price, and a very
effective fence they make.
* -4= * *
“Larrapinta”: I can never understand
why confidence tricksters are classed as
criminals—l look upon them as first-class
educators. When I was a lad I saved enough
for the trip to Adelaide on which I had
set my heart. In less than two hours
after stepping out of the train I was caught
by a con. man for every penny I had by
the evergreen trick of the tenner which the
people in the shop couldn’t cash. I had to
return by the evening train that same day.
but what an unforgettable lesson it was!
Years later in Brisbane I met a man who
claimed to know me- —in fact, he knew nearly
as much about me as I knew myself. We
knocked about together for a few days, _ and
he insisted on paying for everything, giving
as a reason, “You have to work hard for
your money, George; I get mine without
working.” In proof of which he introduced
me to friends of his who were working a
series of racecourse ramps. Of course the
time came when I was invited to put up a
hundred quid and share in the good thing:
then I told them the story of the lad
who was caught within two hours of arriv-
ing in Adelaide, and refused to bite. . They
grinned, and took it like sports; indeed,
one of them actually went to some pams
to warn me of different ways in which I
could have my pocket picked.
AN AUGUST ANTHEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now do subtle signs betoken that the back
of winter’s broken;
Fewer are the rums bespoken where their
trade the Hebes ply ;
And, when wheels you set in action for your
income-tax exaction.
There’s at least the satisfaction that you
counted out July. „
Soon will oaks in leaf be breaking, birds
their sylvan music making,
And, from winter slumbers waking like
the hibernating bears,
To a tick the season timing when the stage
is set for rhyming,
Vernal bards will come a-climbing up the
editorial stairs.
What though still you stamp and shiver
seated in your wheezy flivver,
When the rain is on the river or the moun-
tain breeze is chill,
You may find the thought consoling that
your ’bus will soon be rolling
Where the winter’s knell is tolling in the
sunshine on the hill.
Soon shall vanish skunk and ermine, mus-
quash, too, and other vermin
Hard from bunny to determine, from the
waistlines where they cling,
Giving way to blouses porous—while the
poet his thesaurus
Thumbs anew to swell the chorus of exul-
tant odes to Spring.
Hitch your socks up—and your braces.
Mighty soon the canine chase is
Due to start on winter’s traces, where-
anent our Swinburne sang.
Longest lanes must have a turning, as the
very least discerning
Are perpetually learning—noticeably Mr.
Lang.
There’ll be stir in clump and coppice, and
the chap whose stall or shop is
Mainly decked with Iceland poppies will
be stocking daintier wares,
And the young aspiring Herricks hump their
vernal panegyrics
And their seasonable lyrics up the edi-
torial stairs.
Soon old Sol will put a stopper on the nip
accounted proper
(Even though it’s up a copper) ere you
hit the track for home,
And the malt-and-hops material re-assume
its ministerial
Functions and its sway imperial, with its
stately crown of foam.
Glory be! the winter’s waning, with the
various gloom-constraining
Trials thereunto pertaining, storms that
soak and winds that sting.
Soon the minstrels bold that follow in the
steps of bright Apollo
Metric whoop and lilting hollo will be
raising to the Spring.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
* Mrs. Bertha McNamara, who has died
without realising her long-cherished hope of
becoming the first N.S.W. woman M.L.C.,
was the widow of a German farmer in Tas-
mania when she married one of the early
A.W.U. organisers; she helped him to start
a radical bookshop in Pitt-street, Sydney,
over which she conducted a “residential.”
Here was Labor’s unofficial headquarters
over 40 years ago; the tables, chairs and
soap-boxes which Hughes, Holman and
others used in their street and park meetings
came from Mrs. McNamara’s. One of her
daughters is the wife of J. T. Lang; another
is the widow of Henry Lawson. A small
atom of humanity, with a soft German
accent, the old lady was very grey and very
frail, but she retained all her zealousness
to the last.
The late E. J. Carroll made a hobby of
pisciculture, and spent considerable time on
it. He was convinced that the sunfish and
others found in the fresh-water creeks around
Brisbane area were the best destroyers of
the larvae of mosquitoes. Carroll, like Chief
Justice Blair, was a native of Ipswich.
Hugh Walker, who passed out at Cooroy
(Q.) a few days ago, had been banana-grow-
ing for the last 15 years; before that he was
a well-known man in the mining world. A
civil engineer of Glasgow Uni., lie was once
resident engineer at Mt. Morgan; the gold
boom of the ’nineties found him in West-
ralia, where he helped to float the Golconda,
on the Murchison, and one or two other
mines. After that he managed the Ivlondyke
Trading and Exploring Co.; he had some
experiences in the Dutch East Indies, too.
A link with Joseph Conrad vanished when
a crippled old coal-hulk was sunk the other
day outside the Hobart heads. She was
once the clipper Otago; Conrad made his
first voyage in her as master from Bangkok
to Melbourne in 1888. She accomplished some
remarkably fast passages, the details of
which are set down in the Pole’s works;
there is a fine description of her in “The
Shadow Line.”
A. W. Scott, the new chairman of the
N.S.W. Metropolitan Meat Board, has, like
liis people before him, been connected with
the pastoral industry all his days. Born in
the Braidwood district of N.S.W., he set
himself up as a stock-and-station agent
when lie was little more than a youth* and
soon made a big success of the business.
Then he set out to get back the original
holdings of his grandfather in the district,
and did it. To-day he is owner, among other
A. W. SCOTT, new chairman of N.S.W.
Meat Board.
stations, of Milong, one of the best-known
runs in the Young district, where he estab-
lished a merino stud flock of high quality
and became known as a breeder of Polled
Angus cattle. His appointment will be
popular with his brother primary producers,
for he has devoted much time to the better-
ment of the meat industry in N.S.W., and
has travelled all round the world to gain
first-hand knowledge of the trade overseas.
Completed 50 years at the S. Aus. Bar,
and still practising in Adelaide, T. C. Hol-
land. Sixty years ago he started in the office
of that history-making firm which had
Samuel Way at its head and C. C. Kingston
and Josiah Symon on the staff. They collected
among them three silk gowns, a Chief Jus-
ticeship, two Federal Cabinet offices, a
baronetcy and a knighthood, with_ another
offered but firmly declined by C.C.K.
Isaac Rooney was the first man to put the
dialect of New Britain into print. Born in
Ireland, trained in Hobart, and inducted into
the Methodist ministry in Melbourne, he spent
25 years in Fiji and the Islands, compiling
meanwhile a grammar and dictionary of the
Duke of York group, also a hymn-book and
gospel translation. After that lie had over
40 years of service in S.A. Just dead at
88, he leaves all his three sons in the same
ministry. .
R. B. McComas,
R. B. McCOMAS, of
the Commonwealth
Bank Board.
one of the men who
have lately been
doing a vast deal
of work for Aus-
tralia and getting
little money and
no publicity for it,
had a 70th birth-
day last week.
McComas was one
of the first men
asked to join the
G o m m o mvealth
Bank board; it
needed a man who
knew about wool
and wool-selling,
and McComas, who
is Wm. Haugh-
ton and Co. and
has been chair-
man of the Vic.
Woolbuyers’ Asso-
ciation and has
talked sheep and
wool and skins and
tallow all his life,
was an easy choice.
In Robert Gib-
son’s absence Mr.
McCoinas usually
takes the chair,
though E. C.
Riddle, the gover-
nor, presides over
the executive com-
mittee, which con-
sists of the resi-
dent Sydney direc-
tors and meets
almost daily at the
head office.
The appointment
of gin-case orators
Hutt and Kay to the Metropolitan Meat
Board (N.S.W.) involves the outing of Jack
Osborne. Osborne was secretary of the
Shop Assistants’ Union, and by his organis-
ing and award-getting work helped to swing
a big contingent into the ranks of Labor.
H‘e also won Paddington in 1910, and it has
remained Labor-socialist ever since. Holman's
Government gave Osborne, who had taken
a leading part in a Parliamentary inquiry
into the meat trade, a seat on the original
board; but a new generation that knows not
Joseph has arisen with the Lang regime.
Henry Edward Morris, who died at -Med-
io w Bath a few days ago, had 40 years’ ser-
vice with the N.S.W. railways; then he was
appointed railway prosecutor, and the
venue of his duties was shifted from station
platforms to the metropolitan police courts.
In these he proceeded against thousands of
offenders against railway regulations, retir-
ing a couple of years ago. He was a kindly
and well-liked officer as well as an indefati-
gable one.
Acting-C.J. Cussen has been three times
formally thanked by Vic. Parliament for his
work in consolidating the Statutes —the last
occasion was two years ago. But it was
not till the other day that Acting-President
Edgar and Speaker Peacock dropped in to
see the Judge at his chambers and hand
him the engrossed record of gratitude, after
which Attorney-General Slater presented
him with a bound copy of his work. Gussen,
who has not entirely recovered from his
long illness, said a few graceful words in
reply. His Honor is 72, and has been a
quarter of a century on the Bench.
C. L. Macdonald, dead at Yeppoon, was an
outstanding figure in the Queensland cattle
industry. Born at Ipswich, he went outback
after leaving school. For some years an
inspector of pastoral holdings for the Bank
of N.S.W., he relinquished the job to take
charge of properties belonging to the Queens-
land Investment Co. Finally, he launched
out on his own account, acquiring a number
of cattle stations in Central and North
Queensland.
Arthur Polkinghorne, who has died in
Brisbane and bequeathed his body to the
medical profession in the interests of cancer
research, was a journalist of considerable
parts and had a great capacity for making
friends. In his earlier days he worked
under Hoover in Westralia as a clerk; later
he drifted into journalism, tried his luck
in London and made good there. For the
last few years of his life he was on the
Brisbane “Courier.”
George Mackaness, English lecturer at
the Sydney Teachers’ Training College and
biographer of Bligh, is busy on four books
for Angus and Robertson —two anthologies
of verse, one for school-children: a collection
of Australian essays and “A Handbook of
Intermediate English.” Mackaness, who is
still in the forties, springs from pioneer
stock; on the maternal side from Pliillii>
Goodwin, who came with the First Fleet, and
on. the paternal from John Mackaness, first
Sheriff of N.S.W. in 1824. After leaving
Drummoyne Public School he was a pupil-
teacher at Fort-street Training College;
thence he went to Sydney Uni. to win many
distinctions. One of his selections from the
Australian poets has run into 15 editions.
Edmond John Hogan is finding the
Premiership of Victoria a health-shatter-
ing job. He had a breakdown in April and
a relapse a few days ago. Several of his
predecessors have wilted under the same
strain. Shi els, in 1893, was all in when
J. B. Patterson displaced him from the Pre-
miership, and Irvine became ill and threw’ up
the post in Feb., 1904, after 20 months of
it. Six years at the head of affairs nearly
used up Harry Lawson (now 7 a Senator), and
he resigned and made a bid for the Speaker-
ship. A year of the office took so much out
of William McPherson that he left politics
eight months afterwards, seven of the eight
months having been spent on a health trip.
But most of the 32 Vic. Premiers have been
tougher in fibre. Peacock, who led three
Cabinets, is a good specimen of the enduring
kind.
When Clive Charles Crane was selected to
re-organise the N.S.W. Agricultural Bureau
it comprised five active branches; now there
are 400 active and 500 formed branches and
somewhere near 16,000 members. Crane,
who hails from Gulganree, in the Mudgec
(N.S.W.) district, is a B.A. of Sydney Um.
When the war broke out he was a house-
master at the Wagga Agricultural College. He
served in France as a driver in the 9th
Field Co. Engineers, and gained a commis-
sion on the field. After the war he was
adjutant of the Agricultural Training Col-
lege at Sutton Veny; later he was employed
by _ the Irish Agricultural Organisation
Society. The N.S.W. Agricultural Depart-
ment snapped him up on his return.
Leo Gors, dead in Papua at 52, was one
of two brothers who were widely known in
the Possession. Leo w r as in the Treasury
department for a decade; after a spell with
the A.1.F., he followed planting pursuits,
and at the time of his death was managing
Paraparina, formerly the property of dead
brother Otto.
Ross Philp, the bright young man who is
looking after interests in the
Mungana case, is a son of Jim Philp, one
of The Bulletin’s earliest sub-editors. Born
at Double Bay (Sydney) he was caught
young and taken to Queensland, and educated
at Brisbane Grammar School. After leaving
school he served in the Crown Law office
under MoCawley, afterwards Chief Justice,
and later was associate to Judge Shand. In
1914 he joined up with the artillery, and
was gassed at Passchendaele. He is one of
the six members of the Queensland Bar who
went to the war—• Judge Henchman, who
was prevented by illness from trying the
Mungana case, was another. Philp com-
pleted his Bar exams, on his return, obtain-

ing an exceptionally high pass. On being
called to the Bar (1923) he was appointed
Assistant Crown Prosecutor, and occupied
the position for two years, when the after-
effects of poison gas demanded a mostly
outdoor job. For a while he managed the
Brisbane branch of an oil co. ; then, his
health recovered, he re-entered the law three
years ago. Five days after the commence-
ment of the Mungana case he celebrated his
36th birthday. Married at 21, he has three
sons.
One of the strongest protests against
Lang’s Salaries Reduction Bill was made
by Sydney stipendiary magistrate W. A.
Flynn, president of the Public Service Asso-
ciation, who declares that the bill “tolls the
death-knell of the Labor party in N.S.W. for
a generation”—which, anyway, shows what
a punch the public service vote has, in the
opinion of the man who does most to direct
it. Flynn, who has been president for four
years, is a hard-hitter from the West of
Ireland. In his youth he was addicted to

the higher mathematics, but booked a pass-
age for Australia, and soon was too busy
hunting for a job to think much more about
that subject. After knocking around for
a while he joined the N.S.W. Prisons De-
partment, and was later transferred to Petty
Sessions work. Early in 1914 he was sent
as P.M. to Wentworth, travelled over the
Lower Darling for four years, and then spent
seven years in the West Bogan, Riverina
and Northern districts. In 1924 he was
made an S.M. In bis younger days he was
a keen cricketer and footballer, and he has
lost count of the hospital committees he has
served upon. Residents out Euston and
Bair an aid way still tell the story of how
Police-Magistrate Flynn, in his singlet in-
verted to form a bathing suit, towed aeross
a flooded creek a gate on which was a sub-
stantial lady with a baby on each knee.
J. A. Levey, new president of Melbourne
Hospital, w T as chief clerk of the police
branch as long ago as 1593, and before that
chief inspector of factories. He has done
a heap of philanthropic work in his 80-odd
years as well as a lot of travelling.
Baron Kylsant, the shipping magnate who
got 12 months at the Old Bailey, although
his own title dates from only 1923 has an
elder brother who is the 13th bai’onet of his
line. The father was Canon Sir J. Erasmus
Philipps, for years the Warden of St. Boni-
face College, Warminster, the little Wiltshire
town which many a Digger came to know in
war-time. More than one of his sons rose
to distinction; the eldest is Viscount St.
Davids.
P.M.G. “Texas” Green admitted the
other day that in his early days as a tele-
graph employee at Coolgardie he par-
ticipated in burning an effigy of his boss,
the Westralian P.M.G. of the period, all
milder methods of securing redress of griev-
ances having failed. He didn’t say whether
it had any effect, but it probably hadn’t, for
P.M.G. Sholl, the gentleman indicated, was
thoroughly inured to that form of demon-
stration. In the early days of the goldfields
it was quite impossible to keep postal and
telegraph requirements up to the needs of
the rapidly-growing population, and the
public exasperation was mostly spent on
Sholl, who was held up, probably quite un-
justly, as a type of Groper unprogressive-
ness by the embittered t’othersiders of the
period. Not being a politician, merely
a Government officer, the old man never lost
any sleep over these ebullitions of the roar-
ing days.
F. W. Bullock, veteran land-agent of
Adelaide, and long-ago mayor of the city, has
left an estate of over £50,000.
A. B. Shand, K.C., who retired from
the N. S. Wales Bar last year, has
come back. They always do. Sir John Simon,
whose position in London is equivalent to
Shand’s in Sydney, also retired last year,
yet he appeared for Lord Kylsant last week,
and he will lead for the N.S.W. Govern-
ment before the Privy Council in the Upper
House case at the end of the year. Shand,
like Simon, is in his prime, and will get
many more briefs than he wants. H’e is much
liked by both branches of the profession.

There was a sharp contraction of £5,388,217
in deposits last year; but nearly £4,000,000
of it was withdrawn, chiefly by the Gov-
ernment and Government Savings Bank, in
N. S. Wales. Liquids were tapped for
£1,979,084, and advances were reduced by
£3,957,007. The steep fall in incomes and
values made lighter exchange and other earn-
ings inevitable, while the position was aggra-
vated by a growing crop of bankruptcies,
frozen market outlets, inelastic overhead, due
largely to taxation, a quick growth in'
interest-bearing deposits, the critical state
of the public finances and a heavy fall in
the market value of Government securities
following the conversion proposals.
When the books closed Government and
some other securities figured at £6,569,119,
including £1,550,000 of short-dated Com-
monwealth Treasury bills and a wad of Brit-
ish paper. Full provision has been made
for the shrinkage in market value; so, all
things considered, it is not surprising that
the board put net profit £195,803 short of
the previous year’s at 9.3 p.c. on capital
as against 13.7, 13.8, 13.8, 13.8, 13.8 and
13.7 p.c. back to 1925. The div., which had
-been steady at 10 p.c. since the end of last
century, was at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a. for
the last half, making for the year..
At June 30 there was £4,424,226 visibly
supporting £4,739,012 of capital; on the two
combined an 8 p.c. div. would call for only
4.1 p.c., which would be an easy matter
under settled conditions. But the banks are
carrying an increasing amount of overdue
paper, some of which may take a long time
to liquidate and then show a loss. The
reduction of 1 p.c. in interest has eased the
pressure of the expensive fixed deposits, but
there is a demand for an immediate and
similar cut in the rate charged for advances.
Whatever is done in this matter will pro-
bably encroach on the bank’s reserves, the
chairman says. What is needed just as
urgently as cheap money is a relaxation of
political and social tension, thus providing
a sound foundation for a revival of busi-
ness activity on the basis of lower costs.
This would improve the security on which
many of the present advances have been
made, and increase the demand for further
advances on sound security. Also, as the
money began to flow into the channels of
trade, fixed deposits could he expected to
decrease and current accounts increase.
The co.’s balance-sheet figures disclose a
solid financial structure, as they always
have done, and trading conditions are re-
flected by the movements:—

Fixed and free deposits are not separated in
the sheet, but the last quarterly returns
show over 64 p.c. of the lot to be interest-
bearing. A drop of £1,288,617 in bills
receivable, etc., in London (£1,774,309) re-
flects the heavy fall in export values. Not-
withstanding the reduction in advances they
were 81.5 p.c. of the deposits at June 30 as
against 80.6 p.c. and 73.8 p.c. at the two
preceding balances. _ _ Liquids amounted to
38.1 p.c. of the liabilities to the public, and
the bank was holding only £4 18s. 2d. of
outside money for every £1 of its own funds.
The scrip, paid to £l2 10s., is priced at
£l5 15s. on the market as against £2O a
year ago. The return at £l5 15s. is 6.4
p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis. The visible
cover is £24 3s. sd. per share in net
tangibles, and the inner strength, built up
during 92 years of careful trading, is known
to be substantial.

The underwriting loss for the year was
£32,953 as against surpluses of £9861,
£19,279 and £17,380 for the three preceding-
terms. But £28,900 gathered in interest and
rents reduced the net loss to £4053.
However, finances are snug, and under-
writing is a business in which results should
he averaged. The surplus for the five years
to June 30 was £39,632, to which interest
and rents added £129,670; and since only
£146,750 of the lot had been distributed, the
board felt justified in taking £12,000 of the
remaining £22,552 to pay a 3 p.c. div.,
making the average 9 p.c. for the last decade,
and leaving reserves at £205,184 when the
books closed.
Shareholders' prospects, of course, depend
largely upon underwriting performances,
which have behaved in this way since the
beginning of the century:—

Last year heavier reinsurances, the flop in
values, lighter stocks carried by merchants,
smaller pay-rolls, which affected workers’
compensation insurance, and the slump in
motor-car business resulted in a slip of
£65,202 in net premiums. Of every £lOO
thus gathered £64.4 was swallowed by claims
(it was the heaviest rate in the co.’s history),
and exes, made off with a further £46.6, not-
withstanding that economies amounting to
£18,886 were effected during the term. The
spring in the expense rate was the inevit-
able result of a sharp contraction in net
premiums.
The return from investments was 7.2 p.c.
on capital; but the cut in interest on Gov-
ernment securities, the tendency of rents to
ease and the special tax of 10 p.c. on pro-
perty income will affect the returns from this
source.
Policy-holders are well protected. At
June 30 they could see net tangibles equal
to 203 p.c. of the year’s net premiums; it is
53 p.c. more than is usually considered
adequate. And funds are in good-quality
assets: —

The fine new headquarters which the co.
recently built itself in Pitt-street, Sydney,
are well tenanted. They are largely respon-
sible for the outside debt, which was reduced
by £41,629 last year, investments, book debts
and cash being drawn upon for the purpose.
On the market the pound shares, paid to
165., fetch 15s. 6d. as against 245. a year
ago. Allowing for the final div., the return
at the current price would be 6.4 p.c. on a
6 p.c. div. basis. The backing figures out at

The fall in values delayed the winding-up
of many estates and affected the corpus,
agency and other commission earnings of
this, Australia’s oldest trustee co. So, despite
a net growth of £1,172.093 in the volume
of trusts on hand, there was a slip of £3197
in the year’s commissions (£62,669) ; in-
terest (£6852) was £3542 lighter, due to
the sale of Government securities in connec-
tion with the purchase of a new property.
Thus gross income was £6739 lighter:—

The tax bill (£6326) was £2054 heavier;
other exes. (£47,096) were got back £3004.
The net result was 11.4 p.c. on capital as
against 16, 17.9, 19, 16 and 17.5 p.c. back
to 1926, and four points were knocked off
the interim div. (10 p.c. p.a.) and a couple
more off the final, making 9 p.c. for the year.
A profit of £13,440 on the sale of the Mitre
Tavern, and surplus earnings, lifted re-
serves to within £7455 of paid capital; so
the two combined need net only 4.1 p.c. to
show 8 p.c. on capital alone.
The price paid for the London Bank build-
ing in Collins-street, bought shortly before
the close of accounts in 1930, was not men-
tioned, but £71,575 was added to the book
value of freeholds.

The year’s surplus earnings, the profit on
the sale and a reduction of £9840 in Govern-
ment securities enabled the board to wipe
out the overdraft and show a cash balance
of £10,2.12 at June 30. Government secu-
rities are in at cost, and returns therefrom
will be affected by the cut in interest on
conversion. Plans for the new building have
been put on the shelf until the outlook clears.
Of the 160,000 £2 10s. shares, 60,000 are
paid to 30s. and the balance to 10s. The
market prices the latter at 15s. qnd the 30s.

5.3 p.c. and 4.3 p.c. respectively on an 8 p.c.

covered by 38s. lid. in net tangibles.

For over 30 years it was a modest little
concern, paying moderate divs. on a small
capital—£B3,97s at the close of accounts in
1919. Then, as Perkins’s slipped into the
shadows the Queensland took the lead, lift-
ing its capital by par issues to £298,850 and
the div. to 10 p.c., which was sweetened
with a bit extra in the fat years. The
new money went partly into the co.’s Bris-
bane and Toowoomba breweries, and largely
into hotel freeholds in southern and thirsty
centre- and south-west Queensland. Also
business has been opened up with the North,
where the competing C.U.B. of Melbourne
has strong connections.
Still, conditions have changed; turnover,
rentals and values have dropped, while excise
and other levies continue to mount. Gross
profits have come down by annual steps from
£214,397 in 1926 to £147,548 last year,
when the slip was £35,159, of which £26,652
was offset by savings in exes, (£116,381,
including something for bad debts and de-
preciation). Thus the final figure was 10.4
p.c. on capital compared with 13.2, 14.7, 13.5,
15.1 and 17.2 p.c. back to 1926, but since
the outlook is obscure a couple of points
were chipped off the div., reducing it to
8 p.c.
The amounts shown as written off in the
table are contributions to the contingency
reserve (now £40.973). Including this with
the rest of the lay-by, there was £133,973
visibly protecting and assisting the share
capital, at June 30.
Though the co. went into debt to help
finance the recent growth, liabilities have
been worked down as funds became available
from surplus earnings and the reduction of
debtors’ balances:—

Last year’s surplus earnings and a reduc-
tion of £12,892 in the book value of stocks
enabled £7044 to be clipped off the amount
corning to creditors and £18,606 added to
book debts. Altogether the improvement in
the more or less liquid surplus (£162,192)
was £13,106. Much obviously depends upon
the soundness of book debts. The plant is
modern and efficient.
The market prices the pound shares at
18s. 3d. as against 245. 6d. a year ago. At
the lower figure the return is 8.7 p.c. on
an 8 p.c. div. basis. The backing is 28s.

The shrinkage in primary and other in-
comes checked the inflow of country and
inter-Statc visitors to Sydney, and overseas
tourists were shy. This and the shrunken
pay-rolls of the metropolis, where unem-
ployment continues to grow, affected the bar
trade, too; thus there was an abrupt con-
traction in the high-class business for which
the Australia caters. A cut in charges also
contributed to lighter takings, on which the
extra loading for taxation and weight of the
overdraft pressed heavily.
There was a precipitous drop of £41,066
in the disclosed net result, which was only
£l9 more than the prefs. called for, so the
ords. went hungry. Whether the position
was any better than stated depends upon
what was spent out of earnings on replace-
ments, etc. Allowing for the pref. require-
ments, there was enough in the previous
year to show 10.5 p.c. on ord. capital as
against 13.5, 12.7, 13.6 and 13.5 p.c. back
to 1926.
It is the first time since Sydney bought
out the English interests for £2 a share over
20 years ago that the board has shown
shareholders anything like an empty basket.
Indeed, £229,292 of the £422,169 of capital
is gift scrip, handed out since 1910. But
what the future holds it is, of course, im-
possible to say. We have entered a period
of readjustment in which sagging prices, the
burden of frozen credits, taxation, unem-
ployment and the stubbornness of overhead
threaten to retard profit earning.
A couple of years ago the board bought
the N.S.W. Government Savings Bank’s old
building for £150,000, and went outside for
most of it. The building was demolished,
but before the new extension could be put
up the slump arrived ; so the co. is saddled
with a wad of interest-bearing money not
earning its keep. The position, as balance-
sheet figures show it, is as follows:

During the year £6057 was added to the
debt, and liquids shrunk £9491; so the in-
crease in excess liabilities (£137,505) was
£15.548.
Realising that the debt may stand in
the way of the ords. for a while, the market
prices them at 10s. as against 345. 6d. a
couple of years ago. The backing is 28s.
4d. in net tangibles, all in premises, etc.,
worth what they can earn. The 6 p.c. cum.
prefs. (33,000 of them), which are covered
by £l7 14s. 4d. in net tangibles, seldom
come on to the market.

over-capitalised state of the industry gener-
ally. Thus, last year, this co. was able to
show a net return of only 5.2 p.c. on average
capital from its interest in Australian Port-
land Cement Pty. and holdings of Govern-
ment securities, as against 14.5 p.c. in the
previous term. So the div. rate was halved,
making 5 p.c. for the year; and then, after
striking off £lO,OOO in respect of shares in ,
other cos., reserves were dipped into for
£8353.
Whether the year’s result was any better
than disclosed depends on the figures of the
subsidiary, which are not published. It paid
3 p.c. in December last, but what it passed
along later has not been mentioned. Both
the N. S. Wales and Vic. plants, which have
a combined yearly capacity of over 400,000
tons, worked intermittently owing to accu-
mulating stocks.
To eliminate overlapping and cut out
wasteful competition, Australian Cement
(Vic.) and Ivandos recently amalgamated.
Each reecived a million fully-paids in Aus-
tralian Portland Cement Pty., which took
over both cos.’ workings assets, including
freeholds ; but Kandos had to pay cash for
some of its million. There was no writing
up. Each holding co. became managing agent
for the Pty. in its respective State, and
retained its own book debts. The next table
shows the effect of the merger on the Kandos
Co.’s balance-sheet figures:—

In 1930 the net addition to the book value
of shares in other cos. was only £799,007 ;
some of the shares previously held (mainly in
Kandos Collieries) were passed over to the
Pty. as part of the deal. So, after the writ-
ing-down last year, the 1,000,000 shares in
the operating co., and whatever other hold-
ings there may be, now appear at £1,021,247.
And to offset any possible over-valuation of
plant, etc., in the operating co., Kandos has
reserves of £349,342.
The more-or-less liquid surplus (£187,270)
was £23,623 lighter. But the position is still
very comfortable, and as soon as the present
loan-conversion proposals are finalised the co.
intends to return 10 p.c. of its paid up capi-
tal by distributing £84,233 in Commonwealth
bonds, and to extinguish the uncalled liability
on the 10s. paids.
Kandos fully-paids, which sold as low as
9s. during the term, are now round 11s. on
the market; the return at that figure is
7.2 p.c. on a 4 p.c. div. basis. The backing
in net tangibles amounts to £1 Bs. 4d. per £1
of capital.

This highly profitable offshoot of Guinea
Gold is Adelaide controlled. Its ’planes
are the sole means of transport between the
coast at ( Lae and the goldfields, some 3000 ft.
up in the heart of the mountains in New
Guinea. Their importance as a factor in
the development of the fields may be judged
from the fact that one of them in less than
an hour can transport a load that a heavy
tractor would take several days to shift by
road, which would be very costly to con-
struct and maintain. During the 3i years
to the close of last accounts the co.’s
machines had made some 3500 trips, and
carried over 5000 passengers and about 3000
short tons of goods without serious mishap.
Though there was competition at the start
enough was netted in the first 15 months to
pay a 20 p.c. div., wipe out £4673 of pre-
liminary exes, and put £2226 in the cup-
board. Then the competition withdrew,
prospecting livened and a 40 p.c. div. was
sweetened with a one-for-one bonus scrip issue
for the 12 months to Feb. 28, 1930. Last
year more ’planes were bought, but the co.'s
charges were reduced and gross profits
(£67,922) were £4834 lighter. Exes.
(£45,845) were £4657 heavier; but £2BOO
dropped from somewhere into reserves re-
duced the slip in the net result to £6691.
Still, there was enough to show 49.7 p.c.
on average capital, so the 40 p.c. div. was
repeated, and the £4877 that remained lifted
the lay-by to £10,671.
To meet the year’s outlay on equipment —
it added £45,923 to the book value of fixed
assets (£73,792) —and carry an additional
£2353 of book debts (£15,937), the board
got in an extra £20,000 of share capital
(£60,000). leant upon sundry creditors
(£19,213) for a further £17,594 and drew
upon cash (£155) for £BBO4.
Since, the close of accounts another 15,000
shares have been issued, making paid capital
£75.000, and the div. has been reduced to 30
p.c. Existing contracts, including the man-
agement and operation of two large ’planes
for Bulolo Gold Dredging, are expected to
keep the coi’s eight machines fully occupied
during the current term. All equipment is
reported in good order and fully insured.
Investment possibilities of the scrip
depend upon the life of the field and whether
New Guinea Goldfields, Ltd., decides to run
its own service. Divs., therefore, should be
treated as a part return of capital. On the
market the pound shares fetch 375. 6d.; at
that price the return is 16 p.c. on a 30 p.c.
div. basis.
Vale of Clwydd Coal and Brick Co.
(N.S.W.) remains in the shadows. After
nearly working out its fine old mine at
Lithgow it bought No. 2 property and had
spent more than £lOO,OOO on it before the
directors began to feel that money might run
short. Early attempts to get in capital were
fairly successful; later efforts failed, and the
co. is left with a burden of £29,214 owing to
the Commercial of Sydney and £18,420 to
other creditors. After spending £134,022 on
the new mine it finds that at the moment
there is no money in digging out coal; so no
coal has been broken for sale this year.
Mines and brickworks are, however, being
maintained in good condition, the directors
say, and this and interest ate up £3591 more
than the small revenue from sales, interest,
etc. The property is too good to be jeopard-
ised ; but before any further appeal is made
to shareholders for capital they ought to
be given a detailed report on the mines and
works.
❖ IJt $
“Quartpot Creek”; Queensland gold-
mining propositions have been attracting a
lot of attention lately. Two men who have
given the State a look over are C. O. Lind-
bergh, of the Consolidated Goldfields of
South Africa, and Theodore Price, of the
British Australian G.MXS. The first has
been over to New Guinea inspecting a pro-
perty there in which his co. is interested,
and has also been considering the Mt. Coolon
field. Price has paid particular attention
to the dredging possibilities of the Palmer,
and seems to have been impressed. Nego-
tiations are in progress for the purchase of
the Palmer River co.’s dredging show at
Strathleven, but whether London will pay
the figure asked remains to be seen. During
May the Palmer dredge recovered 109 oz. of
gold worth £5Bl, so there is no doubt about
the stuff being there. Price has. applied for
other Palmer properties, including the old
Lone Star, a reefing proposition from which
the owners were driven by water too abun-
dant for the pumping gear then available.
Another hopeful gold development is re-
ported from Queensland, where hurried steps
have been taken to register the New Gympie
Gold Mines, Ltd. The new Gympie field, once
known as the Kewpie, lies south of Rock-
hampton in country that has been mined
for many years; last year one crushing gave
4oz. to the ton. The secretary has advised
shareholders that there have been important
developments, and that they should hold on
to their shares. No details concerning recent
operations have been given.

A Centralian goldmining show of which
much was expected has proved a dud. This
was the lode 44 miles north-east of Alice
Springs from which samples gave high
assays in Melbourne. Central Australian
Goldfields, formed with a capital of £2OOO,
sent T. R. Victor to inspect and report. He
advised that the discovery was disappointing,
the reef being bunchy, with gold only in
isolated patches. The £lO shares, paid to £2,
brought 9s. on the kerb after receipt of the
report.

To help finance the purchase of a new
bromo-cyanide plant, shareholders in Boulder
Perseverance (W.A.) are offered £50,000
of profit-sharing notes at par. They have
a 10-years’ currency, bear interest at 10 p.c.
p.a. and are entitled to half net profits made
by the co. The co. was formed in 1923 to
take over the Great Boulder Perseverance on
the East Coolgardie field. It paid its last div.
(10 p.c.) in Dee., 1928, Paid capital is
£125,000 in Is. shares.

Adelaide and Perth speculators who
recently scrambled for the scrip in Empire
Extended got all they wanted up to Is. per
share. The co. secured an option on good
terms over a show at Mulwarrie, 80 miles
n.-w. of Kalgoorlie, and lost no time in deep-
ening the shaft from 140 ft. to 150 ft., thus
exposing a 3ft. wide reef sampling 25dwt.
gold. Better results are expected in the
southern drive. There has been a lot of
lease-pegging in the district, largely in anti-
cipation of option-hunting.

The tin-dredging industry in Malaya and
elsewhere will probably remain in the dol-
drums, despite attempted restriction of out-
put, until consumption and prices increase.
Meanwhile costs are yielding to the vigorous
attacks of the management in many cos. The
Alluvial Tin group of eight mines is a case
in point. The July recovery was 522 tons
at an average cost of £32 17s. Ore realised
£6B Bs. 9d. per ton, with the metal averaging
£ll3 15s. London. Malim Nawar, Kundang
and Changkat reduced their costs by so
much as 25 p.c., thus showing what can be
done when the devil of falling prices drives.
The Malayan Government has allowed the
Alluvial holdings, with the exception of
Kundang, to be grouped for restriction pur-
poses. The group quota for August is about
500 tons; it is probable that this will have
to be reduced during the next restriction
period, and Alluvial proposes to meet the
situation by cutting out another unit if
necessary. During the present restriction
period Kuala Kampar’s No. 1 dredge and
Rawang’s No. 1 and Kundang have closed
down. Rawang sluicing plant, hung up since
Nov. 30 last, has resumed, working one shift

THE SAVINGS BANK.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) What does the N.S.W". Government
owe the Savings Bank? (2) Have previous
Governments defaulted in interest payments?
(3) Interest has been credited to accounts.
Has it been earned? Or is it merely a book
entry? If so, have the income-tax people a
right to collect tax on it? (4) What are the
chances of depositors getting 20s. in the £ in
the event of liquidation? —493l.
(1) As at June 30, 1930, there was
£4,160,752 on call at banks and N.S.W,
Treasury, £5,582.501 on fixed deposit at the
Treasury, £29,210,602 in N.S.W. funded stock
and debentures; it had also put £4,423,323 in
Rural Bank stock and £10,819,780 in
Homes Department inscribed stock. Total,
£54,196,958. But it has to be noted that
(a) some part of the first item is in “banks,”
and ( b ) the advances made to the Rural
Bank and Homes Department, though
guaranteed by the Government, were not for
Government expenditure in the ordinary
way. Incidentally, the total assets of the
bank were £72,870,782, leaving £18,673,824
to represent all other assets (including de-
ferred stock, bank premises and loans to
municipal council). (2) There is no record
of any previous default. (3) It is impos-
sible to say whether the interest credited to
accounts for last year was earned. A great
deal depends on how much was written off to
cover bad debts.- If a sufficient sum had been
written off to reduce assets to present values,
it is almost certain that no profit at all would
have been left for last year. Whether the
income-tax people have the right to charge
tax in these circumstances is doubtful —there
appears to be no firm precedent either way.
(4) liJ the liquidation were hurried, deposi-
tors would not get anything like 20s. in
the £. If assets are carefully nursed and
the business economically handled, they ought
to get all their money back, with some
interest. Much, of course, depends upon
how the State Government behaves itself. A
further movement towards “socialisation”
will destroy the value of many of the assets.
There is a reserve fund of £1,500,000; but
that would not cover a shrinkage of 3 p.c.
in the value of the non-liquid assets.
. (1) Can the failure of the Savings Bank
in N. S. Wales be compared with the aver-
age bank failure of the ’nineties? (2) Did
the banks which failed recover, and how?
(3) How long did the process last? —4632a.
(1) In essentials they are identical. In
both cases the depositors wanted their money
and the people to whom the banks had lent
the money could not pay up. In the language
of the financier, the asests were “frozen.”
(2) Yes; all but the purely “land” banks.
Different banks adopted different methods of
recovery. First, in almost every case bank
notes were cashed at par. (Banks then
issued their own notes.) Then current-
account money was released. Fixed deposits
were either “extended,” or part of them was
exchanged for debenture or pref. capital and
left in the business. Meantime, of course,
liquidation was put in hand; properties were
nursed and gradually sold; share capital was
got in, and applied to writing down losses
(the Savings Bank has no capital, but it has
1-J million of a reserve fund, which is the
same as capital for this purpose). Generally
the liquidation was done by a department of
the bank: in one case (Commercial of Aus-
tralia) a separate institution was set up.
(3) Various periods; but little of the old
trouble was left at the end of 12 years. The
Savings Bank’s temporary disadvantage is
that two-thirds of its assets are N.S.W.
public securities, guaranteed by the Govern-
ment, and for the moment that backing and
guarantee are no good; but with a return to
sane government and an assurance of its
continuance, the guarantee would be instantly
good again. And when the guarantee is good
there is no question whatever of the deposits
hping worth 20s. in the £.
OTHER QUESTIONS.
It seems to me easier to lose money over
a, life policy than would appear from The
Bulletin’s recent Insurance Supplement.
Twenty years ago I took a policy and paid
the premium yearly until 1929. When I
asked about surrender value I was told there
was none. I was to be entitled to £1 p.w.
for 52 weeks in case of accident and £lOO
on death. What is the position? —4763.
Apparently yours was an accident policy,
not a life policy. The premium paid for an
accident policy for a year covers only the
year’s risks, just as it does in the case of
a fire policy. Accident and life premiums
are based on two quite different sets of facts.
A life risk is not a constant one, the chance
of death increasing as the life grows older.
For this reason the premium charged for a
life policy is sufficient to cover not only the
immediate risk, but also increase of risk as
the life grows older. The portion of the
premium which is charged to cover the
factor of future increase is held in reserve
and forms the basis of the surrender value.
In accident, fire and other forms of insur-
ance there is no such factor of increasing
risk and hence no surrender value.
Is gold ever discovered near opal? Is
there any indication when gold is to be
jound in N.S.W.? —4755.
Opal and gold have been found near Rocky
Bridge Creek, nine miles west of Trunkey
(N.S.W.), but their association is quite
accidental. The gold occurs in quartz reefs
and alluvial deposits, whereas the opal
occurs in basalt, which forms part of an
old lava stream, and it is probable that under
this basalt is the bed of an ancient water-
course containing gold deposits. There is
no rule as to where gold is to be found ; but
it is more likely to occur in the vicinity of
the older rocks, especially when associated
with igneous intrusions.

THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
THE AUSTRALIAN GULLIVER.
“How I could transform the place if these pests would let me up!”
How Would Communism Suit Me?
Dear B., —How would Communism suit
me (B. 8/7/’31)? Pine! And one of the
principal reasons is contained in your article
“Under Communism everyone must pull his
weight.” No one would be foolish enough
to argue that under Capitalism there is any
fairness in the weight-pulling business. The
primary producer and industrial worker are
pulling the weight of thousands of parasites
at the present time, while profiteers are
only pulling financial and political strings.
One assertion is: “Under Capitalism it is
a matter for the individual—if he likes to
go hungry he may.” Yes, but there are
many people to-day going hungry who have
no choice in the matter at all.
There are thousands in Australia to-day
who are Communists and do not realise it.
They only await the occasion and the leader ;
and political gramophones of the Parkhill
and Pearce type seem bent on providing
the occasion, by advocating the abolition
instead of the improvement of our Arbitra-
tion Acts, with a view to having a fight to
a finish. Who’s finish?
The soapbox Communist makes very few
worth-while converts. His is the idiotic
Russian propaganda, which by its exaggera-
tion defeats its object. But there is a truer
Communism, under which the exchange
expert, the market rigger and the hosts of
middlemen would have to pull their weight,
which explains a good deal of the horror
they express at mention of the word. —Yours,
Geoloin.
Mr. Lang and the Governor
Dear Bulletin, —Political happenings in
N. S. Wales show a most marvellous lack of
constitutional knowledge; in Mr. Lang and
his colleagues. Ministers for the time being
are responsible for all the Governor’s official
acts. He has no personal responsibility; so
if anything goes wrong the Ministers are to
blame, not his Excellency. This is the mean-
ing of the constitutional maxim, “The King-
can do no wrong.” The only way in which
Ministers can be relieved of tlieir responsi-
bility is by resigning and placing the onus
on the Governor of finding other Ministers.
There are plenty of precedents for this pro-
position. A notable one w r as when the
Melbourne Ministry was defeated and the
new Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, wanted
Queen Victoria to dismiss her ladies-in-
waiting. who belonged to families of the
Opposition party. This her Majesty flatly
refused to do. Peel promptly resigned, and
Lord Melbourne returned to office, although
his party was in a minority. The dispute
was subsequently compromised and Peel
again took office. The humorous part of the
present situation is that Mr. Kinsella and
his supporters, by getting a resolution car-
ried against the Governor’s official acts,
really passed a vote of censure on Mr. Lang
and his colleagues ! —Yours etc., Outis.
Co-operative Banks
Dear Bulletin, —Whatever the banks
make by way of profit goes ultimately to
the shareholders, to whom something is of
course due for having provided the capital
which enabled them to start in the first place.
But the question now is whether it is not
due to Australia that shareholders should
be paid out and the banks converted either
voluntarily or compulsorily into co-operative
concerns.
In a big bank the money that is lent to
it and which enables it to increase its busi-
ness and help Governments and industry Ear
exceeds the amount of share capital, and
the withdrawal of the latter would not affect
its operations one iota, because the cash
would be immediately re-entrusted to the
bank on either fixed deposit or current
account. If this share capital were repaid,
profits, instead of paying dividends, would
be available for (a) rebates of interest to
borrowers, (6) increase of interest to
lenders, and (c) bonuses to other depositors,
.The A.M.P. Society in its essentials differs
very little from a bank and performs many
of a bank’s functions on a co-operative system
and to the extreme satisfaction of everybody
connected with it. The Producers’ Distribut-
ing Society of Sydney has also put the same
principles into operation with marked suc-
cess and much to the benefit of the farmer,
and consequently of Australia. Surely
nothing but benefit would accrue t 9 the
country if the banks also fell into line. —
Yours, Co-Sec.
Property Values and Mortgages
Dear Bulletin, —One of the most wide-
spread evidences of the return from inflation
is that occurring in property values. It
is bringing in its train a host of lost equities
and bankruptcies.
What caused the extraordinary rise in
property values in the country? So far as
rural districts are concerned, the answer
probably lies in the high prices we were
able to secure for our produce. This was
accompanied naturally by easy money in
the cities, resulting in the property specula-
tion boom of 1924-28, from which we are
just now making a painful recovery. This
wave of prosperity and the ready command
of loan moneys by speculators caused a
feverish activity in the purchase and turn-
ing over of equities. Contingent liabilities
were accepted cheerfully in the belief that
prosperity would always be with us. The
same conditions will obtain next time we
experience a wave of high prices for our
products, and the toll of deflation will again
be taken. How to check it?
I offer the proposal that the personal
covenant clause in mortgages be eliminated —
that the lender’s claim be solely against the
property upon which the loan is made, and
not upon the other assets of the borrower.
The present period is showing mortgagees
the comparative weakness of the personal
covenant, inasmuch as property investors
(or speculators) are collapsing on all sides.
A complete abolition of the personal covenant
in mortgages would ensure a closer scanning
by the lender of every security offered, and
would certainly exercise a healthy braking
influence upon lending. Much would thus
be done to avoid a boom in equity trading,
and property would be less subject to the
instability of inflation and the violence of
deflation—Yours, N. B. Bonis.
To Stabilise Prices
Dear Bulletin, —To control prices of
commodities is beyond the power of one
country, but the British Empire could
tackle it, in the same way as it was tackled
in war-time, when the encouragement of
production was a military essential, Britain
then was doing in a national way no more
than is done every year quite normally by
various institutions and corporations which
contract to purchase their supplies at a fixed
rate for a fixed period, the rate being deter-
mined by competitive tender.
John Bull, like every other trader, has a
strong instinct in favor of buying in the
cheapest market and selling in the dearest.
In his efforts to buy cheaply and sell dearly,
John imported from foreign countries in
1929 £961,621,000 worth of goods, and sold
to foreign countries £607,475,000 worth.
From his own overseas empire he imported
£258,970,000' worth of goods, and sold them
£231,820,000 worth. In all cases there was,
to John's way of thinking, a fair exchange
of trade, for he balances his ledger by the
earnings of his ships and of his overseas
investments. His overseas dominions, fol-
lowing in dad’s footsteps, traded with all
the world, selling to foreign customers
£162.876,000 worth more than they sold to
their parent, and buying from them
£173,890,000 worth more than they pur-
chased from him. The city pub-keeper who
also owns a farm doesn’t run to the nearest
cash-and-carry for his butter and eggs even
when he can get them there a bit cheaper,
on a strict accounting, than they can be
produced on his own ranch. If John could
be made to realise that it is profitable to
keep trade in the family as much as pos-
sible, there would be a system of annual
contracts with the dominions under which
John would undertake to purchase, at a fail-
fixed price (to be based annually on a
world-wide survey of production and con-
sumption), as much of his requirements in
the way of food and raw materials as they*
could supply, stipulating in return for reci-
procal trading preference and a fair fixed
price for such of his exports as are amen-
able to price-regulation. So long as the
prices agreed upon were fair and equitable
when they were fixed, it wouldn’t much
matter what happened to the outside markets
during their tenure,
As a matter of fact, the existence of such
fixed prices, operative throughout so con-
siderable a proportion of the world’s markets
as are included in the British ambit, would
have a world-wide stabilising influence.
Beyond fixing the prices and keeping the pre-
scribed amount of trade in Empire channels,
there should be no necessity for govern-
mental interference. —Yours etc., Keep It in
the Family.

Sharing Sacrifices
Dear Bulletin, —Being concerned with
the industrial welfare of a big body of men,
I know the general feeling is “If sacrifices
are to' be made, we are prepared to do our
bit, providing the other fellow is doing his.”
It is no use to point out that dividends have
entirely disappeared in some cases; we point
out that many are still high. It does not
help to point to the contemplated drop in
interest; banks drop interest to the depositor
but not to the borrower, and bank dividends
are high for these times.
We can only judge by what we know. I
had to have my teeth X-rayed a little while
back. Two experts quoted for the job—
one three guineas, the other four guineas.
I had the job done at Balmain Hospital for
2s. 6d. (I am an industrial subscriber, 3d.
per week). The teeth had to come out. My
lodge doctor said three guineas. I did not
ask a dentist; I was afraid to. Balmain
Hospital did the job for my 3d. per week.
The doctor and X-ray man are worthy of
their hire, and I would have been satisfied to
pay according to my purse. I have sacrificed
35 per cent, of my wages. What is the pro-
fessional man prepared to sacrifice? I know,
in advance, he has sacrificed many patients,
because they cannot pay.—Yours, Keg.
An American View of Us
Dear Bulletin, —Your Australian and New
Zealand press laughs at many things which
you consider wrong with America. lam
sorry to say we cannot return the attention.
For we do not feel like laughing at what is
wrong with Australia. One does not have
to seek long to find a relationship in your
country between all sorts of sinister pheno-
mena. Australia is not only a land which
has repudiated its bonds, but one that sees
nothing amiss in advertising whisky and
licensing prostitutes. It isn’t a far cry from
where you are now to conditions that laid far
greater empires and democracies in the dust.
If we have evils and abuses here, in the
U.S.A., at least we do not legalise them,
but rather strive continually to abolish and
eradicate them. One degeneracy (perhaps
a minor one in your estimation) is the
imported fad of the woman who smokes.
Our best citizens are striving earnestly to
do away with all advertising which exploits
the cigarette as a feminine novelty and
recreation. We have found that it cheapens
and coarsens our womanhood only to a less
extent than liquor debases and ruins our
manhood. Therefore, in forward-looking
America we are firmly against all these sub-
versive factors, and are winning out over
them.—Respectfully, A. A. Carrier (Detroit,
Michigan).
Our Bureaucracy
Dear B,, —A fine example of the bureau-
cracy which has been gradually established
by the Federal Government was afforded
when the P.M.G. forbade the broadcast of
a public meeting convened in Adelaide by
the Citizens’ League. The members of this
league are representative of every section of
the community who have an interest in the
good government of the country. It is an
entirely non-party organisation, on the lines
of the A.F.A. in Sydney: its main object is
to see that political blunders and outrages
do not pass without protest. The meeting
in question was held to consider and, if
thought well, to censure Government inter-
ference with private enterprise. Approxi-
mately a thousand people attended. On the
morning of the meeting the league was in-
formed that permission to broadcast was
refused. The Minister’s power is unfettered.
The result of this outrageous regulation
is to give the P.M.G. for the time being
complete control over all broadcasting. It
is scandalous that any party politician should
have power to exercise such a control arbi-
trarily. No objection was taken to the
broadcast of the Communistic bellowings of
Lang or the fiduciary moonshine of Theodore.
These men are of the same political party
as the present P.M.G. On the other hand,
the Citizens’ League, since it advocates sane
government, must be the “tool of the capi-
talist” !
It is quite possible, and we may now
say not altogether improbable, for the
P.M.G., when the next election campaign
is being fought, to forbid the broadcast of
any Nationalist meetings while allowing the
Labor meetings to be disseminated.—Yours,
Robertus.

“We must act arul act quickly. When
shall it he — to-night ?” From “The Gover-
nor of Wisberg,” by George Preedy, pre-
sented at St. James’s Hall, Sydney, last
Wednesday, by the Everyman Repertory
Theatre Society. The answer to the ques-
tion appeared to be “No!”
* * ¥
“The Constant Nymph,” as presented at
the Independent Theatre, Sydney, merits a
second notice. A patient and frequent taster
of all sorts of theatrical fare is tempted to
call it the best amateur show Sydney has
ever seen. It may not be that, but, at least,
it is the best he has seen done by amateurs
within talkie-whisper of the Harbor. In the
week of its first performance Sydney had
nothing but featherweight stuff on all its
stages. , . ...
Then the Independents stepped in with a
play, and took the trouble to cast it well
and put it on decently. The amateurs,
astonishingly, knew their parts. Even more
remarkably, they displayed some sense ot
character, and that hobgoblin of theirs, elocu-
tion, was left chained up in the school kennel.
But, above all, there were sundry signs that
the show was put on by an artist.
The chief of these signs was in the use ot
that much abused thing the curtain. It
came straight down at the end of scenes and
stayed down, except in one or two where it
rose and fell as part of the presentation.
Even at the end no other liberty was taken
with it. It was as much a privilege as it
was a phenomenon to see art daring to ignore
snivelling sentimentalism and to flout silly
conventions so sensibly. A little preening at
the end is right enough, and certainly
amateurs get little enough other compensa-
tion for their usually elephantine efforts. But
preening, unlike the folly of Mr. Lang, has
its limits, and they were well and truly
reached in the recent Ethel Morrison season
at the Criterion. There the curtain would
fall on illusion of hostility, anger, despair,
pathos—any old thing you like—and whip
up again at once to reveal the late bitter
opposites all holding hands and smiling like
a lot of inartistic ninnies, so that the
deah public would not miss seeing their deah
idols relaxing after the terrible efforts to
amuse them.
This illusion-shattering is not so much
a convention as a mania. It is the common
thing to see the rag rung three or four times
in response to applause that wouldn’t reach
the roof in a doll’s house. The end of a
scene is not an interval of suspense any
longer. It is a moment of annihilation, recon-
ciliation and resurrection. Then is illusion
annihilated, then enemies are marvellously
reconciled, and the dead, if any, are resur-
rected. A man can be carted out riddled
with bullets or stuck thick with stilettos,
and there he will be, his noble self, all
grease-paint and ass-face, at the end of the
scene. To die Ophelia and spring up Miss
Flossie Nightingale, all alive and kicking,
or, at any rate, smirking, is the way to do it.
This is the process. A writer, after care
and pains and work that most actors couldn’t
conceive, let alone emulate, creates a means
of conveying an illusion. The selected
players, after care and pains and work that
too often would never be suspected, some-
times succeed in making that illusion live.
Then the audience accepts the illusion. It
emotes, is lifted out of itself, becomes
aesthetically alive. Really it is hypnotised.
And one of the curiosities of dramatic pre-
sentation is that the fall of the curtain
does not damage the illusion. It remains,
though suspended. Or it does when it is
not deliberately shattered in order that a
leading lady’s vanity may be titillated. If
that is not the reason for it; if it is a
fact that ah audience prefers this sort of
illusion-shattering, that simply argues that
the particular audience is not affected by
the drama but merely engaged by the tricks
of the players, and would get no more
dramatic satisfaction out of “Hamlet” than
out of a turn by Fred’s performing
dogs. That the audience as a rule applauds
the after-scene posing and smirking of the
players does not prove it such a complete
ass. To do so is a convention; and Conven-
tion is another name for Allah, and the
Sheep is his symbol.

The show now running at Sydney Royal
is something like the old Tivoli in its good
days, with improvements. It is vaudeville
that has kept the best of its old manner and
learnt something from revue, such as a dash
of blackout comedy, a jolly good little ballet
and some revue ensembles. For the rest,
vaudeville. Good stuff, too, some of it. Lily
Moore, a capital teller of smoke-room stories
with just enough gift of mimicry and bur-
lesque. Rene Riano, who is said to have
her legs insured for a million dollars or
thereabouts and ought to double the policy.
The Marbello Four, animated Greek statues.
Neil McKay, who upsets all the rules for
Scotch comedians by being funny. Eddie
Fields and Charlie O’Donnell, who call them-
selves the Two Rascals, and, with some assist-
ance from McKay and another chap whose
name is not on the bill but ought to be, are
a pifetty comprehensive money’s worth in
themselves. There are also Josephine Trix,
Clem Dawe, the Fallow Twins and a few
others, the lot providing- a breezy, bright,
refreshing night out.

Up to last Wednesday the vaudeville show
at St. James Theati’e, Sydney, was being
announced for the usual twice daily perform-
ance. By Saturday it was off, and the
theatre is now closed. It had been fairly
well patronised, but apparently the cut-
price charges were not bringing in enough
to keep the army of performers going.
The closure released some useful stiffening
for Frank Neil’s shot at musicomedv at the
Opera House. Easily the best in this show,
“Along Came Spring,” is comedian Rich,
who had also been one of the brightest spots
at the St. James. The musicomedy r6le
gives him opportunities not provided in his
casual appearances at the other address.
Arthur Clarke and Joan Graham are other
filches, and the show altogether is miles
ahead of any of the recent Neil farce
offerings.
* * *
“Pygmalion,* staged at the Community,
Sydney, is done with that faithfulness to
traditional presentation which has marked
this Little Theatre’s revival of Shaw and
Ibsen. The limitations of the Darlinghurst
crypt threw all art upon the players, and
they did not misfit.
Mollie Kirwan was Eliza Doolittle. As
the flower-girl she was very true to Shaw,
and her tendency as a teacher of elocution
to over-speak her lines served her well in
the famous drawing-room scene at Mrs.
Higgins’s home. When she had become the
“lady” of her dreams (and Higgins’s ambi-
tion ), however, she elocuted too carefully.
J. K. S. Maclennan, as Higgins, similarly
wearied in well-doing towards the end of a
heavy r6le. Arthur Giles, though the mildest
colonel who ever survived the curries of
Indian service, was natural enough as the
well-intentioned Pickering, and May Wilds,
as Mrs. Higgins, has done no more consistent
work for the Community. Praise is due to
Dudley Swinden for his Doolittle, especially
before he rose from being one of the “unde-
serving poor” ; Mr. Lang would have loved to
hear him. As Doolittle, the canitalist, how-
ever, he over-colored even Shaw. Anne Mel-
liuish was not aged enough for Mrs. Pearce;
a fault Dorothy Colley could not overcome
as Mrs. Eynesford-Hill.

The first season of the proposed permanent
Australian grand-opera company opened at
Melbourne Royal on Saturday in a Spanish
opera written by a Frenchman, and sung in
SPRITES, DRYADS, WARLOCKS, ETC., OF “THE CONSTANT NYMPH.”
TOP: Georgie Maund, Pinkstan Blackwood, George Cassidy. SECOND: Winifred Green,
Grace Hart, Richard Parry, Charles Degotardi. THIRD: Marie Rosenfeld, Marguerite
Cullen-Ward, Doris Fitton.
French by Joseph Hislop, who is a Scotch-
man : in his native tongue by Franco Izal,
who is an Italian; in her native tongue and a
Javanese sarong by Alice Orff-Solscher, who
is a German; in English by Phyllis Fergu-
son ; and in Footseray by part of the chorus.
Nevertheless it was a great beginning.
Many who came to condescend probably
stayed to praise. Bernard Ileinze directed
the storm of Bizet’s Gallicised Wagnerianism
that raged in the orchestral well, the old
and tried Frank Rigo was stage director, and
a well-trained band of instrumentalists was
led by the excellent Tarczynski. The piece
was “Carmen,” or “Babel in a Cigarette Fac-
tory.” Nature never intended the Orff-
Solscher lady for the part of the Spanish
nymphomaniac, any morq than she intended
Joseph Hislop for the role of a Sevillian
corporal of dragoons suffering from alternate
attacks of mother-love and satyriasis. But
both performers ignored Nature and made
Art triumph. The Orff-Solscher gave Carmen
a lovely voice and an intensity of nassionate
conviction that kept the audience deeply
interested in her succession of seductions.
Her acting throughout was satisfactory. The
insouciance may have been a trifle overdone,
if it is possible to overdo anything in grand
opera. Don Jos6 Hislop held and patted
her hand like a father confessor, but there
was nothing clerical about the way he
described her charms in that clear, ringing,
honest Scottish tenor of his. Franco Izal,
of the last Gonsalez company, was Escamillo,
the toreador. The heavy, black-browed bull
of a man appeared to be bringing his big bass
in buckets from out of a bath of oil. H'e was
the conventional Italian grand operator; left
leg set back, right leg set forward bent, left
hand extended, first, second and third fingers
clenched, right hand banging the chest at
regular intervals.
Herman Tremayne, as Zunica, and Phyllis
Ferguson were the only Australians in con-
siderable roles. Miss F. gave to xuicaela a
small, pure, birdlike voice, a gentle manner
and an expression of bewildered inno-
cence which were refreshing. If a bar
of Mozart’s music had cropped up in
the clotted voluptuousness of Bizet’s
orchestral score the effect could not have
been more surprising. The staging was
excellent, the dressing first-class and the
population problem was the principal trouble
with the unpaid chorus directed by Jennie
Brennan. As a social function the evening
had it all over the talkies. Furred women
and brave men packed every part of the
theatre. This (Wed.) afternoon “Faust” will
occur, and to-night Tosca will bury the bread-
knife in Scarpia’s injurious brisket, barring
worse accidents.

Last week Melbourne broke out in a bad
rash of tarantella or boom or madness of
vaudeville. No fewer than six factories of
stereotyped farce, hoofing, acrobating, wise-
cracking and syncopation were going at full
blast by Saturday, not to mention the acts in
the movie halls. The Bulletin set out in
pursuit of them at 2 p.m. and had overtaken
all but two by midnight or thereabouts. The
two missed don’t matter. They were exactly
like the others. If not, the age of miracles
is still extant. In the course of its fevered
pilgrimage this paper met the same joke no
fewer than four times, and it was never once
introduced to a jest with which it had been
previously unacquainted. The Infernal Tri-
angle sketch, with blackout, was encountered
seven times. The one at the Tivoli was,
if not the best, at least the most expensive.
In this one the lover hides behind a screen.
The husband returns, says he has seen a
man in uniform go behind the screen, and if
the man in uniform doesn’t come out before
he counts three he will discharge the stage
revolver. A fireman, a soldier, a commission-
aire and a policeman emerge, the policeman
leading a white horse. At none of the other
theatres did The Bulletin see a horse.
The Tivoli’s star personage was Arthur
Prince, who returns with a dummy as tall as
himself and with the same sense of humor.
The Bulletin enjoyed better the Bijou’s skit
on Prince, in which Mo took the part of the
dummy. Tex McLeod, the cowboy who makes
comments on the political scene while fiddling
with a lassoo, is the best turn the Tiv. has
had for a long time. The Bijou show is
mostlv Mo and is calculated to satisfy its
clientele, as should the George Marlow-Nat
Phillips-Syd Beck enterprise at the reno-
vated King’s. It would bo a sensible con-
venience if tickets were interchangeable
between the two shows. The only difference
is that the Bijou ballet is larger. There are
the same number of girls in it; nevertheless,
it is larger. All the same it is. safe to say
that the girls at the King’s have never suf-
fered from rickets or a shortage of vitamin D.
Jennie Benson, Stan Foley, Athol Tier,
Colin Crane, Nell Fleming et cie ceased fol-
lowing a Star at the Princess last week, but
“Laughing Eyes” did not turn up, despite
repeated threats. The management blames
Mr. Lang. Whether this is the first good
thing Mr. Lang has done for Melbourne will
be known if and when said “Laughing Eyes”
turns up. In the meantime the “Follow a
Star” co. has decided that Melbourne is a
safer place for an actor after dark than
Sydney and has turned itself into a co-
operative concern, which gave birth to a new
revue on Saturday night. This paper would
have sworn that the infant was the previous
one’s twin if their respective birthdays had
not been so far apart. Athol Tier’s versatile
kneecaps were again on exhibition, May
Craven aired a voice that might have landed
her in a J.C.W. musical comedy under hap-
pier circumstances, Jennie Benson and Stan
Foley supplied some necessary central heat-
ing to a somewhat cold house and Nell Flem-
ing was as usual worth the amusement tax.
The above shows were well patronised to
packed on Saturday night. A serious view
of the situation is said to have been taken by
Hollywood. It is reported that seven film
magnates committed suicide last week and
that the word “Melbourne” was found
engraved on the heart of each of them.
* * H-
Gordon Bottomley’s choric play “The
Singing Sands,” which had its premiere only
recently in London, has had a first per-
formance in Melbourne by the Standard
Verse-speaking Club, under Eileen O’Keefe’s
direction. Bottomley aided the production by
sending much explanatory detail, and also
photographs of costumes. The story of the
piece has to do with a feud between the Mac-
donalds of Eigg and the Macleods of Skye,
in the course of which the Eigg hid in a cave
and were suffocated by smoke, their number
including a woman beloved of the head of the
clan Macleod. Years afterwards a boatman
Macleod ferries a lady of high degree across
to the island and tells his tale of love, inter-
rupted and finished by the accusing ghostly
presence of the murdered woman. The story
is told by a chorus of waves, so that the
principals are merely of the picture. The
girls, in flowing deep blue raiment, who spoke
the lengthy lines of the waves ensured that
there was no lacking of the eerie. A most
interesting performance.
Another out-of-the-ordinary offering was a
play in rhymes, “The Curious Herbal,” writ-
ten by Constance Smedley. In her little
comedy the characters are represented as a
trio of figures of a Chelsea china group
introduced by two humans who speak the
prologues. Charming fantasy, played charm-
ingly.
A scene from the “Hippolytus” of Euripides
gave the men’s verse-speaking choir a share
in the evening’s programme. Some Dalcroze
eurhythmies were included in several of the
numbers.
The Palette,
Hard times seem to be good for painters.
The Royal Art Society of N. S. Wales, which
is holding its 52nd show in the Education
Department’s Gallery, Sydney, has attained
a higher general average of merit than has
been scored for years past. The really bad
pictures could be counted on the fingers of
one hand, and strikingly good ones are
numerous. President Lister Liste’r is at his
best in some Blue Mountains water-colors;
Dattilo Rubbo is represented by some vigorous
figure studies, Syd Long has sent in quite
an array of characteristic essays in vivid
color, and Alfred Coffey shows the biggest
canvas, worthily covered with a transcript
of characteristic mountain scenery. Erik
Laugker’s water-colors “Blue Distance” and
“The White Cloud” are gems, and G. K.
Townshend, in addition to a fairly numerous
batch of effective small landscapes, presents
a masterly piece of sea-painting in “Sea
and Sand.” There are only a few nudes,
amid which Charles Wheeler’s “Vanity Fair”
stands pre-eminent. It represents a recum-
bent female figure in a pose that brings sad
memories to The Bulletin —for reproducing
a somewhat similar picture the “Lone Hand”
was prosecuted for indecency—and the
lighting is remarkably clever. Raymond
Lindsay is responsible for the most ambitious
thing in the show—an allegorical group, “Pax
in Bello,” the meaning of which isn’t exactly
clear. It’s astonishing how similar in style
all the members of the Lindsay clan are to
Norman. A very effective interior study in
N. H. Baker’s glimpse of the readers in
Sydney Public Library, a very soundly
painted piece of work. King of the still-
lifers is A. J. Sherman, whose “Flowers and
Fruit” is the finest piece of flower-painting
done in Australia for many a long day.
Charles Bryant’s picture of the Sydney fight-
ing a Zeppelin in the North Sea is well-com-
posed, and the sea is fine, but the cruiser
could have been drawn a little more carefully.
About the best of the portraits is Noel
Rubie’s “Heather in a Green Smock.” It has
life. Miniatures by Dorothy M. Bates show
promise of mastery of a charming and much-
neglected art.

ABORIGINALITIES
“E.S.S.” : Most travellers in the Backblocks
have been directed by some variety of the
“bushman’s map.” The most complete
sample of it I met with was on the road
between Eurongella and Windorah (Q.). I
asked a teamster the way to Tallyho, a cele-
brated caravanserai some miles west of
Kyabra. Squatting on his heels, he drew
a line in the dust with a stick, then made a
mark at one end. “This is where we are,”
he said, tapping the mark as though he
thought there might be a lurking suspicion
in my mind that we were somewhere else.
“You go along this track till you come to a
turn-off —here [pause, while he drew a
branch track] ; leave that, an’ keep straight
across the creek [here he took his pocket-
knife and excavated a creek in miniature] ;
then you’ll see a hill on the left [heap of
dust scooped up with both hands] ; keep
that on your right till you come to a gate
[another pause, during which he broke up
some sticks and built a fence]. A mile from
that you’ll see a big tree on one side [here
he erected a small branch] an’ a lot of
bones on the other side [a little pile of
sticks was placed in position to represent
bones]. There’s a road from there to a tank
[another excavation] ; you leave that, an’ a
little farther on there’s another turn-off [more
tracing]. Take the track round the big
rock [this held up the mapping till he found
a gibber and put it in position], an’ run it
right along between two big hills [a long
pause to make hills].” And so he went on
till he had reached Tallyho, and when I left
him he was building the hotel.
* * * *
“Questo”: At Wiluna (W.A.) silk
bloomers with elastic at waist and knee are
gaining great popularity among the ore-
treatment men. Many have a nice taste in
shades. The bloomers are worn over their
trousers, catching the arsenic dust, which
was being poured from the smoke stacks at
the rate of 17 tons a day. The dust pene-
trates ordinary clothing and causes acute
discomfort, especially affecting the thigh
joints.
»2» 'f l H* •!*
“Kaa”: One of the best snake stories
to hand for years comes from Burma, where
a native gem-dealer mysteriously disappeared.
Some of his comrades went in search of him
and discovered a vast and comatose python
with a suspicious bulge in the middle. That
might have been passed but for the fact that
the missing man’s hat lay close by the slum-
bering serpent;—a clue that even a stage
policeman couldn’t miss. The sleeper was
bashed and slit open. Inside him was found
the gem-buyer, but gone to a land where
there is no giving and taking in business.
One unusual feature is that the defunct
Burman was swallowed feet first instead of
contrariwise, according to the immemorial
etiquette of the serpent; another is the wear-
ing of a hat, an article abhorred by the true
Burman. Perhaps this fellow was a rene-
gade to his faith, in which case sympathy
should be extended to the python.
PATRICK’S CHOICE.
“Paddy, how would you like to be in that flying machine up among the clouds?”
“Well, if I was up there, now, faix, I would sooner be in the machine than out av it.”
“Papalagi”: Lord Howe Island, which,
although 400 miles off the east coast of Aus-
tralia, is included in a Sydney, electorate
and returns votes for the Federal and N.S.W.
Parliaments, has another claim to fame: it
has a monopoly
of the world's
trade in kentia-
palms. A hundred
of the islanders
are banded
together in a
Government - con-
trolled co. and ex-
port 3000 bushels
of ken t i a-palm
seeds a year. That
constitutes the
globe’s sti p p 1 y,
and, wherever you
may roam, if you
chance to see
kentia-palm you
can safely bet
that it had its
origin on Lord
Howe Island.
* *
“Ess”: The old
coast-river boat
Emma Pyers, re-
cently beached on
the Tweed River,
was built at Irv-
ington, on the
Richmond, about
45 years ago, for
Robert Pyers, who
represented the
Richmond in sev-
eral N.S.W. Par-
-liame n t s. He
made his money
in the ironbark-
girder industry at
Tattumbah, where
he was known as
“Ironbark Bob.”
The vessel was
named after his
daughter, now
carrying on an
auction business
in Casino—the
first lady auction-
eer in the State.
At the launching,
when Emma, then
a very small girl,
broke a bottle of
champagne over
the vessel’s stem
to christen her, a timbergetter who had
known Pyers in his struggling days exclaimed,
“Fancy old Bob wastin’ good stuff like that
when he could have sprinkled her bloomin’
nose with a drop of holy water!”
“Waler”: All the good hacks, stock horses
and hunters I have ridden were thoroughbred,
and the worst were animals with
trotting or pacing blood. I have
seen all the horses at the Mel-
bourne remount depot, and the
best of them are the veterans.
The younger horses nearly all
betray their origin by their
heavy heads. When I was a
lad at Wagga, nearly a half-
century ago, breeding Walers
was a staple industry, and
nearly every station kept one
or more thoroughbred stallions.
Many were by the famous Snow-
den, who was at the Mitt a
Mitta stud for many years,
among his progeny being High-
lander, Mercury (the handsom-
est horse I ever saw), Brisbane
and Dary. The last-named sired
Lord H'opetoun’s hunter Snow-
ball. No wonder the Walers
made a name in India and else-
where. Causes of the decline?
Export of all the best mares
and breeding from the culls,
coupled with the importing of
hackney stallions in the en-
deavor to get size. These stal-
lions were mostly English
dealers' culls, and dear at any price. What
put the lid on was the introduction of that
abomination the American trotter.
“Hamer”: The delusion that a man may
brew beer for his own use in N.S.W. with-
out holding a license was blown out by a
Campsie (Sydney) prosecution which cost
the brewer £5 and costs. Many people might
be prosecuted if the stuff they turn out for
the family, fondly believing they arc produc-
ing a temperance drink, were analysed. I have
seen country families regularly dosing them-
selves with “hop beer” of a potency that
would make the city beer-swiller envious.
I once brewed some beer myself—or a friend
brewed it for me. At that time I was main-
taining what I had intended for a secluded
working place. It became a Bohemian ren-
dezvous, and the beer expense—which
largely fell on me—was horrible. Ben, who
was out of work, suggested that he could
reduce the outlay if I gave him eighteen-
pence for the materials to brew some beer.
It was duly brewed and placed in a huge
A FELLOW FEELING.
WIFE: “Well, what are you laughing at? Thinking of all the time
you’ve been wasting with that line?”
HUBBY: “No, m’dear; it just struck me that the fish I missed
probably swam home and lied about the size of the bait he
lost.”
cask in a corner, where Ben, immensely
proud, said it had to stand for three days. On
the night of the broaching the house was
full of visitors. Somewhere about midnight
I went out on the balcony in my shirt and
sang “Let Me Like a Soldier Fall” to an
admiring audience in the street. When I
awoke in the morning the place looked like
a battlefield, and I stepped carefully over
the dead and disabled to get a reviver from
the cask. There wasn’t a drain left; but,
after all. Is. 6d. wasn’t much to pay for
a night like that. The tragedy of it is that
Ben has forgotten exactly how he made
that marvellous liquor.
$ * tfc
“Vermis”: Coolangatta (Q.) rejoices in
an ocean beach where they go in for the
usual exhibition of the female figure, and
for the catehing of other poor fish. The
worms inhabiting the sand are in: great
demand for bait, with the result that they
are alleged to be getting scarce. The other
day one of the councillors demanded a close
season for them, but the proposal met with
a chilly reception from his colleagues. One
of these voiced the opinion as a fisherman
that the amateur Walton who could catch
a sandworm on his own deserved the Order
of Merit rather than the curtailment of a
quest beside which the pursuit of a will-o’-
the-wisp is a mere walkover. Every brother-
artist of the angle will agree with him.
* * * *
“Haapai”: Though the Australian abo.
has shown a remarkable aptitude for boxing.
Polynesians—excepting occasional Maoris —
have never bulked big in that line, in spite
of their fine physique. This is the more sur-
prising since there is plenty of evidence that
in days gone by boxing was a favorite sport
with the Tongans and the natives of the
Samoan group. Mariner, whose account of
his involuntary sojourn in the Tongas from
1806 to 1811 is a classic of the Pacific, often
refers to the boxing and wrestling matches,
and mentions that when Captain Cook was
entertained bouts between members of his
crew and the natives mostly ended in favor
of the latter. Considering that the average
Briton of those days was trained to use his
fists as a matter of course, this says .some-
thing for the Tongans. In Samoa, boxing
contestants wore fibre gloves studded with
sharks’ teeth. To offset the teeth, which often
resulted in a boxer being disembowelled by
an uppercut to the midriff, cocoanut-fibre
armor was worn covering the left side of
the body-—which indicates that the scrappers
of those days relied on a dirty right.

SERVICE
The establishment of a Bank does not in itself establish a Banking
Service. It provides only the machinery which is to be operated by
man for the service of man. The human factor is the vital spark
that gives life to a mere aggregation of buildings, books and currency,
and makes of them a friendly, helpful service for the convenience of
the people.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank extends its facilities throughout
the length and breadth of Australia, through Branches and Post-office
Agencies, and trained officers translate those facilities into understand-
ing human service to the thrifty.

Chemist Tells Recipe for
Family Cough Remedy.
HELP PEOPLE SAVE MONEY.
reC w? e ’ » lven by a leading chemist,
that will enable people to make the best
iamily cough remedy, and at the same time
save much money. Everybody knows that a
good cough and influenza remedy consists of
two mam sections:
• first section is the undiluted medicinal
ingredients; and the second is, of course the
necessary water and sweetening. The prepara-
ti°n of the medicinal ingredients requires
trained _ knowledge, but the water and
sweetening can be added in the home just as
easily as in the pharmacy. And vou save a
lot of money by doing so. Now, prove these
facts by trying this HEENZO recipe: Into
a ,P ut f° ur tablespoonfuls of sugar, three
ot either tre&clo or honey, two of vinegeir
a ,A? r ?, e . breakfast-cupful of warm water!
fetir till dissolved, and when the syrup is
q J aito COW pour into a large bottle, and
add a two-shilling bottle of concentrated
riLLNZO, obtained from your chemist or
store By doing this you will have a family
supply equal in quantity and superior in
quality to eight ordinary-sized bottles of
the best ready-mixed cough remedy that, if
purchased in the usual way, would cost up to
fl. An outstanding feature about HEENZO
is the fact that it is a safe remedy for
babies as well as adults, and over 12,000
people have written letters proclaiming it
the best remedy they have ever used for
quickly banishing coughs, colds, croup, bron-
chitis and influenza. *
“Finn”: The distribution of the magpie
in Vic. is a good example of color protec-
tion. North of the
Divide it lives
chiefly on the
ground and nests
low. Its enemies
see it from above;
therefore it has a
black back and a
white breast. The
dark back lit up by
sunlight approxi-
mates in tone to
the light breast in
shadow, and renders
the bird less vis-
ible. South of the
DOGS I HAVE KNOW N. — THE BARITONE.
Range the magpie builds on high trees. The
observer looking at it from below sees the
light upon its breast. So its breast is dark,
its back white or grey.
“Beagle”: A prospector on the Lolworth
goldfield (N.Q.) made a meat-safe, using
“lollypop” saplings, which he found not only
light and convenient to carry but straight,
perfectly round and tapered very little. This
wood, furthermore, is easily worked, and can
be bored and nailed without splitting. In
the Lolworth case the wood was sawn into
lengths of 4ft. 6in., and these formed the legs
of the safe, which stands on the ground.
Holes were bored to take §iu. bolts. The safe
was a model of neatness and strength, and
gave good service for months. Then the lolly-
pop tired of its domestic functions and burst
into growth. Inside the safe there are shoots
4in. long covered with leaves, and along
the entire length of the wood there is a
profuse outcrop of green buds. All because
the legs of the safe are stood in tins of
water to keep the ants away!
❖ * * Jfc
“Pick” : Inveterate foes are the dingo and
wombat. Though the warrigals have no use
for wombats as food, they will turn from
the pursuit of a paddymelon or lyrebird to
chase one. In their tunnels wombats can with-
stand all dog attacks, and often a dingo seek-
ing to enter has been torn to shreds at the
tunnel mouth. Also during their night forays
the wombats, being very quiet workers, are
fairly safe, but now and then in day-time the
dingo, sneaking from the thickets, cuts off
the shambling food-seekers from their home,
and ferociously ravages amongst the younger
and weaker animals. The bucks rush to
cover the retreat, but compared to their
agile enemies they are slow and clumsy, and
they fight a forlorn hope. Some regain the
safety of their den; others are mauled and
torn, and recovery from the virulent bite
of a dingo is rare.
* * * *
“Frigid” : The fruit of the pandanus men-
tioned by “Bad Australian” (B. 22/7/’3l)
is not the only tree from which Binghi made
fermented liquor. In N.Q. there are large
blue oblong-shaped plums, which the abos.
used to collect a little under-ripe and bury
in ashes or sand for a week, after which
they were transferred to another utensil to
ferment. When ready the plums were boiled
and enclosed in a dilly-bag; the bag was
lifted out to drain all night. It was potent
stuff; a few nips would send any abo, to the
booze Elysium.
* * * *
“Yarri”: Parts of Australia are so plainly
marked by volcanic eruptions that even
unscientific persons can point
out where the old terrors did
business. Along the Burde-
kin River (Q.) is a strip of
basalt, 70 miles long by three
or four miles wide, known as
“The Wall.” The molten
flood that poured down there
is reckoned to be the most
remarkable outflow that has
been traced on this very
ancient continent. But what
interests the ordinary mind
is the maze of caves, which,
because of the danger of get-
ting lost and the uncertainty
of what lies in the dark-
ness, have never been
thoroughly explored. The
boiling stream of long
ago is supposed to have
issued from Black Moun-
tain, on Cape River.
Pastoralists in that
neighborhood used to be
considerably worried by
thieving abos., who
emerged from caves and
speared cattle that
browsed in the vicinity.
Then, with loads of good
fresh meat, they repaired
to their fastness to en-
joy a banquet in' safety,
afterwards returning to
the open to stage a
jubilant corroboree. Pur-
suit was difficult; even
when a group was sur-
prised, the peculiar
nature of the country
enabled them easily to
slip away. Their mid-
dens were generally
near caves, into the darkness of which they
quickly vanished. On one occasion two black-
trackers followed some thieves with lanterns
and revolvers, but they never returned, and
so far as I know nothing of them has; ever
been discovered.
* * *
“Si Anu”: The sacred trees mentioned by
Frazer in the “Golden Bough” are by no
means extinct, even in the most sophisticated
tourist centres. The central block of the
famous Hotel des Indes in Batavia is com-
pletely dominated —in fact, embraced and
well-nigh . strangled—by a waringin-tree,
said to be the
largest in Java.
Just as the hotel
is not simply a
hotel, but a city
in itself, so this
tree is not merely
a tree, but a
whole forest. One
can wander
amongst its hun-
dreds of down-
ward - reaching
roots as one;
wanders through
the glades of
a jungle, find-
ing in one a goat
browsing and in
another a little
shelter erected by
a native gardener
,as a retreat from
the too-busy world
and the watchful
eye of the hotel
mandur. Some
years ago it was
proposed to chop
down the tree to
make way for
building improve-
Tnents, but the
management was
informed that the
giant was kramat,
or sacred, and
that the staff
would leave in a '
body and no son
of Islam would
come in their
places; also the
tutelary deity of
the tree would
show his dis-
pleasure in the
annual balance-
sheet of the co.
As a result the
roof of the new
bar and dancing
floor is compelled
to adopt strange
subterfuges to
avoid encroaching
on the sacred
ground. A tree,
Irvingia malayana, in Singapore lias a larger
practice than any other member of the medi-
cal profession on the island. Sufferers from
every complaint from housemaid’s-knee to
beri-beri hang cloths that have been wrapped
round the affected part on its boughs, and,
after an epidemic, it looks at a distance as
if it had broken out in blossom of every size
and color.
&
“Sea Nomad”: About the last thing a
Torres Strait diver likes to encounter is
a frisky young diamond-fish. These huge
creatures (some of them weigh as much
as two tons) are insatiably curious, and are
apt to nose the life-line. With the horns
around his snout as a guide the fish
swims down the line, circling it as it runs
between his horns. When he meets the diver
he is not a bit frightened, but the diver
frantically 1 tries to free the line of the
horns before' the monstrosity bolts. If it
plunges away beforehand the line snaps,
leaving a lonely diver in peril at the bottom
of the sea.

“S.S.S.”: Mr. AssistanDßesident-Magis-
trate of -the Nepa area dropped in to the
camp hospital to mention that he was going
up the creek to the Prykes’ claim on Tues-
day. How about a walk-about for Sister
(that’s me), who looked a bit peaky from
being shut in for so long? Quite a short
walk, 10 miles about. The cavalcade of
Mr. A.-R.-M., Sister, police boys and hos-
pital headboy started off at daylight. Scrub-
itch, that pending of Satan, got me ir the
arms despite a long-sleeved coat, and I felt
an itching on my face. It was hot. And
the bed of the creek was heavy weather.
Suddenly over the illimo-tree tops there came
a sound, of song that became Melba singing
the Jewel Song from “Faust.” “Mr. Magis-
trate,” I said, “is it Heaven ?” “Prykes’
gramophone. Another two miles,” was his
reply. The camp was deserted. I sat in
the living-room tent whilst Himself went to
find the Prykes. There on the packing-case
table was a great bowl full of virgin gold
uncovered. I laved my hands in it and let
it trickle through my fingers. “Isn’t it risky
to leave it about like that?” I asked. “No,”
said that finest of fine fellows, Frank Pryke.
“The boys wouldn’t touch it, and neither
would any stray miner. It isn’t done.”
“Dawson”: Last spring along the river
flats near Forbes (N.S.W.) the nesting birds
seemed to have taken a sudden leaning to
the views of Herod. The leaves on the
ground were strewn and spattered with
broken eggshells and yolk—a general
condition irrespective of species. Speaking
of it to an old hand. I was informed that
it indicated a long dry spell with a. hard
winter, the birds’ instinct warning them of
KEEP POLITICS OUT OF RELIGION.

conversion compuls’ry?"
“Iss, an’ why can’t they mind their own business, ’stead of stickin'
their noses into chapel affairs?”
scarcity of food ahead. But it has been
unusually wet ever since. The mildness of the
season has permitted flies and mosquitoes to
remain on the menu for insect-eaters, and,
aided and abetted by the rain, has brought
the box-trees out in bloom for the honey-
• suckers; so either the birds are poor season
forecasters or there was some other reason.
:S * *
“R.K.”: Let me set “Old Timer” (B.
10/6/’3l) right about that tragic cemetery at
Laverton (W.A.). The first person buried
there was Heffernan, killed by lightning on
the British Flag lease, about 1898. He and
a man named Jerry Barnett were playing
draughts in a tent, with the board on their
knees, and Kennedy, Barnett’s mate, had
just left to go to their own camp a few
yards away to cover up anything that might
get wet in the thunderstorm, when a terrific
flash came. He rushed back and found
Heffernan and Barnett had both been struck.
Dr. Laver was in his camp not • far. away,
and was called. He saved Barnett, but
Heffernan was dead. Barnett was struck
again, some years after and still lived on.'

“Bill R.”: When “Willeroo” admits (B.
15/7/’3l) that the only night-workers among
ants that he knows of are sugar-ants, he
betrays a limited knowledge of the rules
of the Ants’ Union. When the going is
good ants of any sort work day and night.
Probably there are relays of workers,
but the activity is incessant. When rainy
days come the industry is closed down and
the toilers rest. Black ants, red ants and
sugar-ants choose the night-time, when all
is quiet, on the household front, to loot the
•iam-jars, dripping-tins and sugar-basins.
Meat-ants, green-ants, jumpers and bulldogs
don t invade houses, as a rule, but it is by
night that they sip the sweetened tea from
the camp billy or gather up the scraps
around the galley.
PROSPECTING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Beyond “The Sons o’ Freedom” and the
famous “Golden Bar,”
Around the dumps of mullock where the
unwashed tailings are,
Where lucky men won fortunes in the olden,
golden days,
When yeai’s .were full of glamor and fields
with wealth ablaze,
We’re taking out our dishes, and our young
hearts are aglow
With hopes and dreams that stirred them in
the days of long ago.
They might have missed a nugget, and it
may be ours to find.
They only scratched the surface —it’s the
gold they left behincf
That lures us out and onward down a half-
forgotten lead,
Where each pothole has its story of queer
human faith and greed.
The blood of digger fathers is urging hand
and brain.
We’re on the old adventure of the Roaring
Days again.
When Sol’s first beams are slanting through
the swarthy ironbark,
Till magpies carol sweetly their welcome to
the dark,
We bend above the dishes as we swirl the
water round;
We feel the thrill of pleasure when a dozen
specks are found.
Maybe we’ve struck it lucky, and perhaps
we’re on the gold
That lay beyond the sunset in the glorious
days of old.
So where “The Rose and Thistle” gave up
its age-held store,
Around “The Four-leaved Shamrock” and
a dozita strikes or more ;
Where still the memory lingers of hosts of
striving men,
We search along the gullies while we dream
the dreams again, •
Still with the lure upon us,, still with the
hopes aglow
That sent our fathers roving in days of long
ago.
VICTOKIA.

THE PENITENT.
Within the mighty edifice a morgue-like
calm reigned. The editor-in-chief was reading
an MS., and, as he read, his blue pencil
rose and fell rhythmically till what had been a
neat manuscript resembled a pak-a-pau ticket.
Many burning phrases had incurred the
editorial inhibition, and particularly one of
which the first word was “blithering.” The
job was over at last; and the editor leant
back with a satisfied expression. He had
always been a tiger for work, and he was
reflecting that there would be plenty now
that Billy Hughes was once more, after years
of disfavor, a regular correspondent of the
“S. M. Herald.”

Sensational End to Society Cause
Celebre.
“An enthusiastic reception is being given to a
revival of the romantic old songs of the ’eighties.”
—“National Review.”
In this case Juvenol Products, Ltd., pro-
prietors of Goldilox Hair Dye, Face-lift
Cream, etc., etc., claimed £5OOO damages
from Mr. Augustus Pluteson, of Bellevue
Hill, for slander. The words complained of

Darling, you are growing old.
A strong Bar was retained, including Mr.
“Bob” Limelighter, the popular self-adver-
tising K.C., who appeared for plaintiff com-
pany. Mr. Limelighter said.
“Yeronner and Gentlemen of the Jury.—This is a
cruel and cowardly slander on an honorable firm,
perpetrated in the most public manner possible—to
wit, at a parish concert in aid of Rev. Hoodie’s
church fund. Ever since Mr. Pluteson’s traditionally
lovely wife began, as the saying is, to ‘go off’ she
has been replying to the barrages put down on her
by relentless Nature with spirited counter-artillery
work, for which, as all know, the ammunition has
been supplied by my clients. I draw your attention
to the damning phrase ‘silver threads amongst the
gold.’ I give its vile innuendo the lie. There are
no silver threads, nor ever will be, upon the brows
of those who get ‘the Goldilox habit.’ Many a
N.S.W. Cleopatra has this splendid preparation to
thank for the fact that such hairs as she has left
are considerably more glittering than those of her
great-grandchildren. Let me draw your attention
to the allegation, ‘Darling, you are growing old.’
Gentlemen of the Jury, the little grandmothers and
great-grandmothers of our fair harbor city who
patronise the wares of Juvenol Products, Ltd., never
grow old. They can’t—and the man who says other-
wise is a mendacious scoundrel. I will now call Mrs.
Trixie Gushhe—a pi’ominent Sydney siren since 1892,
when she met her first gossip-writer—and allow you
to judge for yourselves. You will be asked to say
whether there are any silver threads amongst her
gold; whether the term ‘old’ can fairly be applied
to her schoolgirl complexion (attributable to ‘Face-
lift Cream’) ; her liquid orbs (‘Tots’ Eye-shine’) ;
her infantile hats and frocks. Call Trixie Gushhe.”
As the blinding apparition of sexagenarian
girlishness swept into the box the astonished
jurors were seen to be conferring. “We are
agreed on our verdict, your Honor,” said
the foreman. “Damages for the full amount
claimed. We would like to add a rider that
the singing of romantic old songs of the
’eighties be prohibited by the Censor or
someone, as being totally inapplicable to
present-day society customs, and likely to
lead to dangerous misunderstandings.”

GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE.
“My Government,” said the Premier
heartily, “is always ready to assist new
industries. Now, about this patent isauce-
pan-lifter of yours”
“I thought, possibly, seeing that this is a
completely new industry”
“Precisely. A bounty or subsidy is impos-
sible. Any remission of taxation is impos-
sible. I can’t guarantee reasonable labor
conditions ; my Government is pledged to make
labor conditions as unreasonable as possible.
But don’t go away! We will assist you!
We are determined to assist you! What
profit do you think you could make out of
the enterprise?”
“Well, for the first year, given luck, say,
£1500.”
“Splendid ! Splendid ! We can assist you
right away. Let’s see.” And he seized pen and
paper, and became lost in calculation.
“That means £lOOO for the chairman and
£5OO for the secretary,” he announced event-
ually.

“Why,” said the Premier triumphantly, "of

destined to make the country remember him.
But then came years
of toil and worry.”
The little woman
smiled; but in the
wrinkles behind the
smile one could read
the grave story of
those years—the big-
hearted struggles of
a patient mother to
educate her son so
that one day he
might lead his fellow
men.
“I must admit
that there were
times when I almost
lost faith,” she went
on, “but deep down
in my heart I knew
that he would not
fail me. And now

THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED
MEAL
STALLION REGISTRATION.
“Centurion”: W. F. Dunn, the N.S.W.
Minister of Agriculture, was recently asked
to reintroduce the Stallion Registration Bill,
which had its first reading in 1926. A very
representative deputation put a strong case
before him, but got little satisfaction. A
series of vague remarks about Mr. Dunn’s
desire to help the farmers and induce them
to use more horses was followed by the
assurance that it would be very difficult to
pass legislation of the kind, as some people
would consider it an infringement of the
rights of the individual —excellent, coming
from a member of the Lang Government.
What Mr. Dunn didn’t say, but what every-
one in touch with the subject knows well, is
that the type of man who maintains a runt
of a stallion in a tinpot way is numerous
enough to be dreaded by country politicians.
For years fear of the small-owner voter
hung up similar legislation in Queensland
and Victoria, but both States eventually
steeled their hearts and put the much-needed
measures through.
It is worth while quoting the experiences
of these States. Victoria, first in the field in
1920, found bad sires as plentiful as black-
berries when registration became com-
pulsory. Five years later in all Victoria
only 8 per cent, of stallions was classed as
unsound and 5 p.c. as below standard.
Queensland followed on the Victorian lines
and the first report (in 1925) on the opera-
tion of the Act was illuminating. The State
was divided into two divisions, Central and
South, the well-horsed, cattle-breeding North
being left out for the time being. In the
Central division, 39.5 p.c. of the blood stal-
lions offered for registration was rejected;
33.4 p.c. of draughts; 37.15 p.c. of ponies;
and 42.88 p.c. of trotters. In the South the
percentages of rejects were: Bloods, 40.5
p.c. ; draughts, 53.1 p.c.; ponies, 24.4 p.c.;
trotters, 45.8 p.c. It will be noted that
the southern area, much more thickly popu-
lated with the small farmer-owner, has by
far the greater proportion of wasters. Not-
able, too, that in the respective areas the
half-bred trotter (useless save as an agency
for gambling) is first and second on the
list of rejected runts. Those figures should
impress even on Mr. Dunn the urgent neces-
sity for controlling the indiscriminate breed-
ing in N.S.W. of unsound and generally
undesirable liorses.
RUSSIA AS WHEATGROWER.
“Baomata” : “Tuart” (B. 8/7/’3l) quotes
the estimated cost of production of the crop
just harvested on the “Gigant” State farm,
the largest in Russia, at 2s. Id. per bushel.
Final figures are now available; the Soviet
“Economic Review” states that costs on the
farm were 10.9 d. per bushel, and f.o.b.
Is. 7d. per bushel —complaint is made that
transport charges were excessive. On the
other great farms costs were Id. to 3d. per
bushel higher owing to less efficient equip-
ment. The same journal states that it is
hoped to reduce farm costs to an average of
81d. per bushel within the next two years.
Whether the Five-year Plan succeeds or
not the Russians have definitely brought
wheat-growing within the mass production
sphere hitherto reserved for manufactured
goods. One-third of the total farming area in
Russia has now 7 been voluntarily collecti-
vised ; the Soviet Government’s difficulty
is not to persuade the peasants to join in,
but to provide plant for those who have
already pooled their properties. Its budget
for 1931-32 provides for an expenditure of
£237,000,000 on the development of agricul-
ture. The figures appear stupendous, but
we must remember w 7 e are dealing with a
nation of 160,000,000 people, whose total
budget expenditure is £2,177,000,000. What
Russia is doing other countries will do, and
before the Five-year Plan is complete the
“little farm well tilled” will have as much
chance of competing with the giant co-
operative concern as has a back-yard work-
shop with Ford’s motor factories. Instead
of moaning about Russian labor conditions
Australia should get busy on a Five-year
Plan of its own.
“Wodgil”: Professor Shann, who foresaw
the Australian slump, is not impressed with
the gaudy tales circulated from Russia about
the wonderful results of the Five-year Plan.
Addressing delegates to the annual confer-
ence of the Agricultural Bureau at Hawkes-
bury College, he said : “I believe in co-opera-
tion among farmers, but if you try to practise
co-operation on the Soviet idea of compulsory
organisation you will create disaster. Do not
be impressed too much with Russia’s big
harvest. Much of Russia’s crop usually fails
through ‘winter kill,’ but last season little
failed. About five-sixths of Russia’s increase
last harvest was due to a freak season, and
about one-sixth to mass organisation.” The
professor is only one of many authorities
who believe that the Russian threat to wheat
production in English-speaking countries has
been grotesquely exaggerated. Incidentally,
Russia grows about as much rye as wheat —
indeed the rye harvest was greater than the
wheat harvest in 1927 and 1929 —but other
rye-growing peoples don’t seem to have their
tails down.
PAPER-BAGS FOR SUPER.
H. Green; Replying to “R. K. Dcea” (B.
22/7/’3l), I have to say that super, packed
in paper-bags has been supplied to a number
of wlieatgrowers for the past two seasons,
with more or less satisfaction to buyers. W'e
pack 24 to the ton, and make no extra
charge. “R. K. Deea” is apparently guess-
ing when he says that bags cost approxi-
mately 3s. per dozen ; it is more like 4s.
As packing, transport and storing in
paper-bags are still only in an experimental
stage, and distribution is in the hands of
my company, Australian Fertilisers, I can-
not see on what authority “R. K. Deea” can
make any statements on these factors in the
cost of packing and handling. Although it
is quite on the cards that this method of
packing may displace the old (jute) way,
it is still on trial.
SHEEP BRIDGES.
“Floodmark”: To get sheep over flooded
creeks or narrow rivers, I make a bridge by
using two poles sufficiently long to stretch
across the water. To place them in position,
tie one end of pole loosely with wire or rope
to some handy fixture to enable it to swing.
Place the poles upstream along the edge of
the bank. Tie another rope to the upstream
ends of poles and throw it to the other side.
Cross the river and pull the ends of poles
separately into the water; the current car-
ries them round, while the rope pulls them
into position. Space them according to width
of decking. For the latter I use ordinary
slabs three to four feet long, any width, and
smooth sides down. If slabs are not avail-
able, sheets of bark will do, or split rails,
taking care to place split sides down.
It is essential to cover the slabs (or what-
ever is used) with turf, sods or sand; this
binds them together, holds them firm and
fills the cracks. Sheep will not cross readily
when they can see a current swirling
beneath them.
Erect four posts, one at each corner of
the bridge. Stretch to posts across the
stream a taut wire. Between this and deck-
ing hang ordinary wire-netting, fixing it
firmly to both wire and decking; and the
bridge is complete. Wings are necessary for
forcing and holding sheep. For rivers that
are too wide for poles use cables made of
fencing-wire and suspend the bridge to them.
For still water or billabongs float it upon a
pontoon made of casks or oil-drums.
DOG-PROOF FENCING.
“Columbus” : During the last decade or so
many thousands of pounds have been spent
unnecessarily, especially in Queensland, in
the erection of elaborate dog-proof fences
when jobs at half the cost would have served
as well.
For a new fence use 54 x 4 x 15g. netting.
Have posts 4ft. 6in. out of ground; strainers
more. Running wires should be at 12in.,
21 in., 30in., 39in. and 50in., the posts being
bored as near the inside as possible con-
sistent with strength. The reinforcing
between 12in. and 39in. is necessary because
by far the worst enemies of netting fences
are kangaroos; the “old men” cause havoc
at this height by fighting through the fence.
Attach netting on the inside of the posts,
trenching it 4in. into the ground. With a
little adjustment of the handles a plough
set to 6in. and drawn by three steady horses
yoked tandem does perfect work in most
country. Run wires before ploughing, as
they serve as a guide. Filling in should also
be done by horse-power, using- a tree trunk
with a suitably projecting limb as filler. To
finish off, staple a barb along the tops of
the posts as near the outside as possible.
This has the effect of a projecting shelf,
which no dingo will negotiate.
Most netting is attached to existing fences
of 4ft. standard height. I would in this
case use netting only 4ft. wide, attaching
and barbing as above. This avoids the neces-
sity for extra-long posts or superstructure
to carry extra height. If more height is
desired use split scantlings or whipstick
timber, standing it against alternate posts
between netting and running wires. This is
cheap and effective, as the top ware gets no
buffeting. In a hard school of experience
I have never known dingoes to climb or jump
anything above 3ft. 6in., their only ingress
being through breaks made by ’roos.
In flooded country hang the netting on
the down-stream side, attaching it only to
the top wire, which in strong waters should
be a twisted cable. At the bottom attach
sufficient netting to make an apron 2ft.
wide hugging the ground. Tie a barb under-
neath and weight the apron down with light
battens about 2ft. apart.
IMPROVE OUR KELPIES.
“Liss”: A man with a couple of really
good dogs can do the sheep work of about
three men with no dogs, or, worse still, with
bad ones. As station staffs have had to be
cut down one would naturally expect the
general quality of the dogs in the country
to be improving, but I am afraid it is not
the case. For some years past the standard
of our kelpies (in N.S.W., at all events) has
been steadily slipping. Nowadays one sel-
dom sees a really clever dog outside the
trial ring, nor do I believe there are as
many of these as there used to be.
Most of the dogs shown on the bench in
Sydney are back-yard bred. Although they
may conform to type, may indeed be physi-
cally perfect, they are lacking in intelligence
and the instinct for work so characteristic
of the breed. It stands to reason that what
may be called the working portion of the
brain must become atrophied by disuse dur-
ing several generations. This would not
matter at all if these winners on the bench
were not used for breeding alleged workers.
It would pay any large station to start
a stud by the purchase of a dog and a
couple of bitches, all pure-bred and proved
workers. Their progeny might be broken
in on the station and used by the regular
hands in much the same way as the station
hacks. The man responsible for the break-
ing-in would be allowed a pick. When the
stud had made a name locally the surplus
would command a ready sale in the district.
At least, a lot of the knocking about suffered
by sheep from bad dogs would be eliminated.
MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY.
“Jack Point”: Whether it’s sheep, beef
or dairy cattle, pigs or poultry, the prin-
ciple underlying production is the same.
Every animal requires a certain amount for
its bodily maintenance, and its ability as
a profit-earner depends mainly on how much
it can be induced to produce over and above
this —in other words, how much “overtime”
you can make it. work.
Of course, the first consideration is breed
—you can’t get best results from mongrels.
But, even apart from this factor, different
methods adopted show almost unbelievable
variations in results, and the successful man
is the one who is ever looking at details.
For instance, in winter, the man who rugs
his dairy cows reaps a reward simply be-
cause the unrugged cow uses so much more
of her energy in keeping warm. For the
same reason, where it is practicable to take
the icy chill off the drinking water, more
energy will be available to go into produc-
tion of milk. Deficiencies of protein, min-
erals, etc., in the ration have far greater
consequence than the casual owner supposes.
If a breeding sow, for instance, is not fed
the essential minerals she will draw on her
own constitution for the deficiency, with
disastrous results both to herself and
progeny.
The recent dairy-production test conducted
by Meggitts strikingly demonstrated how
slight is the margin between a ration that
will show the usual winter falling-off in
production and one that will not only offset
this but actually increase production in the
lean period. “The little more, and how
much it is.” Just a matter of a few hand-
fuls of a feed rich in protein made all the
difference; and so it is all through the
calendar of animal husbandry.
CASE FOR THE LARGE WHITE.
Fairchild and Clutterbuck: We can assure
“W.D.Me.” (B. 15/7/’3l) that the Large
White is proving its worth to thousands of
farmers, and has come to stay. But there
are few Large Whites which correspond to
this gentleman’s description. The ones he
purchased must have been very cheap, and
probably had a dash of the Berkshire in
them; this would account for the coarse
bone, etc.
Years ago we kept Berkshire and Middle
Yorkshire sows, which we mated to a Tam-
worth boar. Although all our pigs were fed
from self-feeders, it was rarely w‘e got them
off as bacon before they were seven or eight
months old. Later our Vic. Department of
Agriculture commenced recommending the
Large Whites. With somewhat dubious
feelings we bought a boar of this breed and
mated him with the same sows. The result
was amazing, as from then on all our bacon
went off at from five to five and a hali
months, showing a clear saving of twc
months' feed per pig. So pleased were we
that we have now concentrated on breeding
pure Large Whites, with still better results.
We get litters averaging 1001 b. per pig at
92 days old, while others average 581 b., 591 b..
701 b. and 661 b. each at 62 days old. One
litter consisting of 13 pigs gave a total
weight of 10111 b. at exactly 12 wrecks and
three days old, only 1091 b. off half a ton.
Should “W.D.Me.” read a little more his
views, no doubt would change, and he would
see clearly that the world no longer requires
the heavy fat Berkshire or Middle York-
shire. Perhaps he could tell us why Den-
mark has rejected all other breeds, including
the Berk, and Mid. York., in favor of the
Large White, in order to maintain its annual
£20,000,000 export trade to Britain. Why
also is (Canada following suit? Three-
quarters of Canada’s pigs to-day are Large
Whites, and recently a consignment of 200
stud Large Whites went from England to
Russia. The Large White is now established
in every State in Australia, and is proving
its worth as an economical producer of
prime-quality, early-maturing pork and
bacon. Its supremacy in this respect is
further emphasised by the fact that at the
last Melbourne Royal Show Large Whites
gained first, second and third places in the
eured-earcasc competition, open to all breeds;
in 1929, for best baconer, they secured both
first and second places.
FROM A VICTORIAN ORCHARD.
“John A. Thunn” : After pruning it does
not take the woolly aphis long to attack the
wounds if the pest is about. A good plan
is to paint any outsize cut with neat white-
oil emulsion containing five per cent, of
nicotine solution (Black Leaf 40). It is
also wise to give the pruned trees the once-
over wdth a one per cent, solution of the
white-oil emulsion, which in my opinion is
one of the most effective of sprays, provided
the spraying is carried out in a calm atmo-
sphere.
A cheap and effective pest destroyer for
use from now onwards may be made by
mixing together 41b. of ground sulphur, 41b.
of resin, 71b. of caustic potash and a bare
pint of rainwater. Sufficient heat is developed
to fuse the mass, which should be vigorously
stirred with a wooden stick to prevent char-
ring. Pour the melt into thin layers to cool,
and dissolve the solid cake in water as and
when required. The quantities mentioned
furnish sufficient solid to make 100 gallons of
spray; the womenfolk can do the job. The
spray gives a fine spread with good adhesion
and is both insecticide and fungicide. Its
toxicity depends to a large extent upon the
toughness of the film left after evaporation;
and as the film left by caustic potash is
much stronger than that produced by caus-
tic soda, the former should be used, although
caustic soda will do. The manure merchant
or ironmonger would quote for the supply
of the raw materials; cost is about half-
penny a gallon.
Presently we shall be getting ready for
an attack on the codlin. In the beginning
let it be camouflaged in the shape of lures.
I use 4in. flower-pots (drainage-hole
plugged), painted white inside and out with
enamel paint to attract the night fliers, to
give them the much desired safe landing
and to make the pot watertight. The lure
used is a 10 per cent, solution of molasses
with a drop of Geraniol (obtainable at the
chemist’s) ; it is cheap and easily installed.
Every moth dispatched saves many an apple
or pear from being riddled by marauding
grubs.
Considering the season’s copious rains
now is the time for fertilisers. Apply from
2cwt. to 4cwt. of blood and bone manure
per acre spread broadcast around the trees
—not underneath, because the root develop-
ment follows the growth of the branches and
the main feeding roots fringe the tree. As
my trees are to have the benefit accruing
from a green crop ploughed under which
was grown with lewt. of super, per acre,
the intention is to cut out sulphate of
ammonia this year in the belief that the
trees will not require any forcing. Last
year the orchard responded well to sul-
phate of ammonia, and potash, but I am one
of those who believe in a change now and
again.
WHY LOSE POTATOES?
“Ilortus” ; A man in our N.S.W. district
lost a fine crop of potatoes this year by leav-
ing them in the ground until the rains (excep-
tionally heavy) ruined them. Pity more
growers don’t go in for pitting their crops,
if they don’t possess shed room. The point
to be remembered is to make the pits on
ground that is high and dry, i.e., that does
not hold the water or become waterlogged
even after heavy rainfall.
Make long, narrow pits rather than short
wide ones. Slope the foundation slightly
Put clean straw on some sand (if procur-
able) on bottom. Place potatoes on straw in
neat piles (without bruising them) in long
pyramidal formation. Take care that no
old haulms get into the pits, otherwise danger

from pests may ensue. Cover over with
straw, then a thin layer of dry earth, and
over the top put some sods that should have
been cut some time before and allowed to dry.
At the bottom along the sides cut channels
lower than foundation of pits and slope them
to carry off quickly any surplus water.
These pits are common in European coun-
tries and in 99 cases out of 100 prove very
successful.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) How is the wool-branding preparation
mentioned by “Hatter ” ( B. 27/5/’3l) made?
(2) Could I market it ivithout infringement
of the legal rights of others? (3) Could I
patent it? —4355.
(1) Mix wool fat, 45 parts; lime blue, 5
parts ; barytes, 20 parts ; Emco (light paraf-
fin spirit), 25 parts—all parts by weight.
(2) Yes. It was evolved by the British
Research Association and given to the Avorld.
(3) No. You are not the inventor, nor
have you acquired the rights of the inventor.
(1) Can Pritchard's or other makes of
■wood-gas producer be fitted to any make of
tractor or petrol engine? (2) Cost of fit-
ting one oi\ a tractor? —4390.
(1) Yes, but adaptation involves con-
siderable expense. (2) Consult A. G.
Pritchard, 114 Wakcfield-street, Adelaide.
(1) How is charcoal- or producer-gas
made? (2) How used? (3) Books on the
subject ?. —4543.
(1) By burning charcoal in an airtight
furnace to which air is admitted. The air
in passing through the bed of heated char-
coal forms, amongst other gases, carbon
monoxide, which is combustible. The gas
is cooled and cleaned of impurities and led
to the engine. (2) In the same way as any
sort of gas is used in a gas-engine. (3)
There are several. ' Any bookseller could
obtain one which would meet your require-
ments.
(1) What is the average weekly profit
from 100 head of poultry? (2) Is it profit-
able to rent a stocked poultry-farm? —4s96.
(1) With fair average stock, proper equip-
ment and the necessary aptitude, a return of
15s. over cost of feed might be expected
during the current year, but during the next
couple of years it is probable that not more
than 10s. would be realised. (2) If the
stock were suitable this may be satisfactory,
but the usual practice is for the person
renting a farm to purchase the stock.
What should be added to four gallons of
tomato pulp to make a soup suitable for
ca nning ? —4413.
Scald the tomatoes, pulp them, add a
little water and boil Avith 2oz. rice and 3oz.
blitter to each pound of fruit. AVhen cooked,
pulp the whole and pass through a hair
sieve.
I am selling pork for sausages at lid. per
pound, and for brawn at 3sd. per pound, to
butchers who charge Is. sd. per pound for
sausages and lOd. to Is. 2d. per pound for
brawn. (1) What is the cost of processing
pork for these purposes? (2) Cost of curing
a pig? —36Bo.
(1) Your case is not representative. Syd-
ney pig-breeders advise they are getting 2fd.
per pound for choppers, and sausages are
sold at Bd. and brawn at 51d. to 6d. per
pound. Sausages sold in cans cost about sd.
per pound to prepare, exclusive of cost of
meat; wrapped in cellophane-paper the cost
is less, but includes in addition to labor about
Id. per pound for wrapping and §d. per pound
for casings. (2) 2d. per pound on dressed
weight, with minimum of £1 and maximum
of £2 10s.. is the current recognised charge.
(1) What is the market value of. sandal-
wood? (2) Avenues of disposal? (3)
Royalty payable to Q’land Government if
cut- on freehold property? (4) Is myall
timber of commercial value (a) in Aus-
tralia, (b) overseas?— 4s76.
(1) and (2) The right to cut sandalwood
on CroAvn lands in Q’land ivas disposed of
some time ago to the Q’land Sandalwood Syn-
dicate, one of the principals of which, R. J.
Murphy, of Hughenden, could give informa-
tion in regard to prices and marketing. (3)
Nil. (4) No market anywhere at present.
(1) Has judgment in the application to
the Court by the liquidators of Bawra re-
specting the destination of unclaimed money
been delivered yet? (2) Are the last annual
accounts of the liquidators available yet?
(3) Why all the delay over the liquidation?
(4) Who arc the liquidators l ? —47l7.
(1) Not up to date, but it is expected
shortly. (2) The liquidators adidse that
they are in course of preparation, and will
be published as .soon as practicable. (3)
In the liquidation of so huge an organisa-
tion as B.A.W.R.A. every step taken must
be in strict conformity With the provisions
of the Vic. Companies Act. With a body of
60,000 shareholders many points arise call-
ing for Aniry careful consideration. (4) John
M. Higgins and C.‘ R. Murphy.
How to grow willow trees? —462l.
Take cuttings sin. long and jin. diameter
and put lin. in the soil. These cuttings,
placed in the ground in July, should make
plants 10 feet high for planting the following
July. Cuttings ,12ft. to 15ft. long, 3iu. in
diameter at base, placed firmly 3ft. to 4ft.
deep in the soil and tied to a stake, should
furnish trees 20ft. high in 12 months. Cut-
tings 2ft. long and from lin. to Biu. in
diameter, placed 22in. in the ground, develop
strong plants quickly.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Corimba”: The abnormal growth of
grass throughout northern Vic. and southern
Riverina has occasioned fear that before
the season has gone much further there will
be a lot of footrot. Graziers are taking pre-
cautionary measures, but yards arc so muddy
that without some scheme for cleaning the
feet of the sheep before they enter the dip
the solution in a few minutes becomes little
more than a mud puddle. Mr. F. G. Pitty,
of Ecliuca, has discovered that by putting
down 4in. of old straiv in the crushing-pen
immediately before the dip, feet become suffi-
ciently cleansed of mud to make the opera-
tion effective. •
“Pinion”: To keep seed grain, which has
to be stored, from weevils, mice and moths,
put it into kerosene-tins, through the bung-
holes, and screw cap's on tight. If eggs are
suspected in any of it before storing, put
a couple of spoons of kerosene in the bottom
of the tin.
“Karaway”: A simple remedy for fly-
struck sheep is warm gumwood-ashes. Throw
on a handful as soon aa the wool has been
cut away from the affected part.
“Broombee” : A better type of ladder than
the one recommended by “Mulyan” (B.
l/7/’3l) can be turned out by taking Oregon
sides Sin. x l|in., and, instead of hardwood
rungs, using Oregon battens lin. x 4in.:
these to be let into the sides by a quarter-
inch sawcut. The real ladder shape can be
given by making it 2ft. wide at bottom and
tapering to Ift. at the top. To render all
secure drive a nail or screw through the
sides and into the end of each batten; also
have three thin bolts —one at top, one at
end and one at middle.
“Ilomby” : Most travellers will leave a gate
open when its closing involves two minutes’
struggle with an ill-fitting, out-of-shape wire
pull-over. Get a piece of yin. iron, bend it
at right angles, drive one side into the gate-
post, leaving the other pointing upwards. To
the gate attach a piece of wire (or, better
still, dog-chain), with a hobble ring for slip-
ping over your iron upright. The gate can
then be opened and closed by a rider without
dismounting, and your stock won’t get
“boxed” nearly as often. Cost: 15 minutes’
light labor.
“Tangaloli”: The best way of putting
stringybark sheets on a roof is to hang each
sheet with a piece of wire fastened to the
top end and tied to a batten, or else nail,
the bark with a row of nails up the middle
after giving it a good lap. Thus the bark
when it shrinks in width will go towards
the middle at each side. A rider-pole, as
“Bill R.” (B. l/8/’3l) suggests, would be
rather a good finish, but it catches rubbish,
and is likely to rot the bark.
“Disc Harrow”: A home-proved tip for
the man who uses spring mouse-traps. If
the bait is continually being taken without
effect, cut a square of tin of suitable size
and fit it over the hook so that the bait
will be fastened in the middle of it. The
mouse will have to rest half his body on
the tin to reach the bait, and will spring
the trap even with a stiff setting.
“Stewart W.” : The farmer who sells an
occasional log to the local sawmill should
first know its superficial content; and here’s
how to arrive at it. Take one quarter of
the mid-girth in inches, multiply this by
itself, multiply the result by the length in
feet and divide by 12. Thus if mid-girth
is 80in. and length 18ft., then super, feet
would be 20 multiplied by 20 and 18 and
divided by 12 —600. When the mid-girth is
not exactly divisible by 4, multiply it in
inches by itself, multiply result by length in
feet and divide by 192.
“Disc Harrow”: Picking up prunings is
a tedious job at the best of times. Construct
an incinerator of galvanised-iron, start a good
fire in it, and tow it round the rows on a
sledge, throwing the primings straight into
it. Failing this, take the cart round and
pick straight from ground into cart.
“Horatio” : In coastal Queensland and on
the N.S.W. Northern Rivers we should do
more with the Cape gooseberry than we do.
It makes champion pies and jam, and is also
a very palatable dessert fruit. After a
“burn” in scrub country the plants grow
prodigiously. They can also be cultivated
commercially. In the Benarkin (S.Q.)
State Forest area, gooseberry-picking sup-
plies work for 50 men over about four
months, during which they average £4 10s.
a week.
“Liss”: Take care of your harness! Too
often one sees saddles with counterlining
burst and stuffing hanging out and traces
and other parts hooked up with wire.
Clamps, needles, awls and thread cost little
and, with timely use, can do much; the same
applies to cleaning rags, soft soap, neatsfoot
oil and saddle soap. Make as many wall-
pegs as are necessary and hang all gear up
in sets together. You will then have a
harness-room you can take a pride in.
“Der Jong”: Though maize-growers have
for some time found it more profitable to
send their grain to market on four legs—
that is, in the shape of fattened stock, especi-
ally pigs—the wheat-farmer has been slow in
following the example, though an enlightened
few, taking a hint from Maoriland, have
been topping up their lambs Avith a mixture
of wheat and meat-meal. Australians have
always been shy of Avheat as stock food, yet
in South Africa it has long been a standing
ration for stock, including horses, as the
Australian troops Avere quick to find out 30
years or so ago. A certain amount of
roughage is necessary in the case of horses
to ward off the danger of impaction, but
otherwise the grain is first-class tucker for
most classes of stock.
“Rip”: The Federal Government has at
last come to a definite conclusion in con-
nection with the buffalo-fly, which is now
SAveeping doAvn from the north-west and
threatening our beef and dairy herds. The
decision is that the imposition of a buffer
area between infested country and that as
yet untouched is out of the question, chiefly
because of expense. The same old excuse
was made Avhen the cattle tick was inarch-
ing down the same route. Even Queensland,
the State immediately concerned, dallied so
long that a loss running into millions
resulted, while N.S.W. also had to dip deep
into the stocking to police its northern border
against the invader. However, the Federal
authorities brightly announce they will look
for a destructive parasite. Experimental
stations will be established in the far North,
Avliere experts will look for the parasites. So
several new jobs in the Federal civil service
Avill be available, whatever may happen to
the cattle.
“Trifolium”: Mr. A. Hudson, of Barham
(N.S.W.), has had an interesting experience
Avith irrigated pastures on the Murray.
Kikuyu grass has proved to be inA-aluable
for binding channel banks, choking out use-
less plants and at the same time providing
excellent feed. TAventy acres sown in 1930
with a mixture of lucerne, perennial and
Italian rye grass, phalaris, cooksfoot, cow-
grass, alsike and white clovers produced
an abundance of rich feed, and carried eight
to ten sheep per acre for the 12 months
ending July 1. Phalaris and cocksfoot were
the best grasses. Mr. Hudson’s experience
has shown that in normal seasons pastures
made up of English grasses and clovers
should be irrigated every two weeks and
lucerne every three weeks.

department.
How to grow gloxinias? Is a glasshouse-
necessary? Will they grow from seed? —
4565.
They grow best in glasshouses, but will
thrive in a well-protected greenery or con-
servatory. Put the corms in during Sep-
tember in boxes until growth begins, then
set out in 6in. pots ; add rotted and pulverised
cow manure. Seed should be sown in August
in shallow pans or boxes and shaded from
sunlight. Transplant the seedlings when small
into pots and keep the soil moist.
Who introduced opium into China? —4611.
According to tradition, Arabs in the
thirteenth century. From 1857 to 1880
most of the opium used in China was
smuggled from India. Chinese efforts
to end the trade in 1839 led to war with
Britain. In later years the Chinese pro-
duced nearly all their own opium. In 1907
Britain offered to reduce opium exports
from India by one-tenth every year for ten
years, contingent on China gradually ceas-
ing production.
Suitable food for young rosella? —4541.
Feed on maize soaked in water until it is
soft, and pollard made into a stiff paste
with water. When grown, the bird should be
given maize and a liberal allowance of green
stuff —lettuce, thistles and apples.
A and B are in equal partnership. A
offers to sell B his share j B refuses to buy.
A offers to buy B’s share at the same price;
B refuses to sell. Can A demand that the
business be put up to auction? —4s69.
No. A should serve B with notice that he
intends to dissolve the partnership.
A mortgagee who had taken possession
prior to the N.S.W. Moratorium Act has
since sold the property. Has the owner any
redress? —4625.
Well, the Act provides that a mortgagee
shall not continue any action or proceeding
commenced after Nov. 26, 1930, for breach of
any covenant in a mortgage; penalty, up
to £lOO. A prosecution requires the written
consent of the Minister.
I have a small repulsion-start induction
motor (3 h.p. ) which I use for driving a
small bench lathe. Will any damage result
from stopping and starting the motor by
means of a sivitch each time it is required to
take a measurement, or should a striking
gear with fast and loose pulleys be used?—
4709.
No damage will be done. It is common
practice to start and stop these machines
by switch.
(1) What metal are gas-lighters made of?
(2) Where are such lighters obtainable? (3)
Has acetylene gas ever been used with suc-
cess in internal-combustion engines? —4ss4.
(1) “Spongy” platinum, produced by heat-
ing ammonium platinichloride. (2) They
are occasionally stocked by Sydney hardware
stores. (3) Experiments have given unsatis-
factory results. The cylinder walls were
covered with a heavy deposit of residue, pro-
bably carbon.
(1) What- Government instituted the
N.S.W. Land Valuation Department? (2)
Is provision made for revaluation every three
years? —4l7l.
(1) Holman Government, 1916. (2) No,
but it is provided that a valuation list must
be furnished to a rating authority at least
once in every three years after a list is
first furnished.
(1) When and by whom was the first
recorded discovery made of silver-lead ore in
the Broken Hill country? (2) Did the dis-
coverer work his find? (3) Something about
Rasp’s find and the founding of the B.H.P.
G0.?— 4741.
(1) By P. Green, of Menindie, in 1876
at Thackaringa, 20 miles from Broken Hill.
(2) Not systematically; but later it was
worked as the Pioneer. (3) In Sept., 1883,
Charles Rasp, boundary-rider on Mount
Gipps station, pegged out 40 acres of an
outcrop, thinking it was a tin show. A
syndicate of seven was formed, including
George McCulloch, manager of the station,
and six more blocks of 40 acres were applied
for. Towards the end of 1884, chloride of
silver was struck at a depth of about 100
feet. Rich ore was discovered on other parts
of the property soon after, and on August
10, 1885, the B.H.P. Co. was floated.
What is the reason for the bush saying
that “a- compass loses more men in the scrub
than it brings out.” Is there any particu-
lar difficulty in using a compass in scrub? —
4251.
In wide, dense scrubs, especially where
there are steep hills and gullies, it is impos-
sible to follow a line, so that a compass has
a very limited usefulness, and in inexperi-
enced hands may be misleading.
(1) Has there been any recent advance in
the study of invisibility and transparency of
matter? (2) Any literature on the subject?
—4624.
(1) Numerous researches have been made
on the transparency of matter. Many
materials opaque to light which affects the
eye are more or less transparent to ultra-
violet and infra-red light. Further, all
materials are transparent to X-rays, a form
of light, in degrees varying with the nature
of material and the wave-length of the
X-rays. (2) Numerous papers are to be
found in scientific journals, and a number
of books are devoted to the properties of
X-rays and ultra-violet and infra-red light.
(1) Are home-made cakes made for sale
subject to sales tax? (2) Where can sales-
tax forms be procured? —447l.
(1) All cakes sold to persons who resell
them are subject, to tax. If the cakes are
sold retail by the maker tax will not be pay-
able unless the total annual value of sales
of all goods is in excess of £lOOO. (2)
Federal Taxation Office, Sydney.
(1) The Avro 10 ’planes used by Aus-
tralian National Airways arc reported to be
engined with three Armstrong- Siddeley
“Lynx” motors of 250 h.p., and carry, besides
mail, six passengers and two pilots. When
the Southern Cross took up the run she
carried 12 to 14 passengers with mail, though
engined with three Wright motors of only
220 h.p. Why does the more powerful ’plane
carry the smaller load? (2) What is the
price of an Avro 10?—4190.
(1) Your information is incorrect. The
Avro 10 motors are 215-230 h.p. and the
load is ten passengers and two pilots. The
Southern Cross has three motors of 200-220
h.p. and carries seven passengers and one
pilot. (2) Approximately £B3OO, to which
must be added freight, insurance, Customs
duty and sales tax.
I want to place a medicinal preparation
on the market. What must be done in
N.S.W.? Must I disclose the formula and
can the preparation be patented? —44l6.
The Pure Foods Act requires name and
address of maker to be stated on label,
a correct trade description of contents,
the net weight or volume of contents
and the presence of any of the drugs
specified in regulation. It is not neces-
sary to register or otherwise disclose
formula. Obtain regulations from Govern-
ment Printer. For information as to patent
or trade-mark consult Patent Office, 3
Martin-place, Sydney.
(1) What is the best position in which
to grow cannas? (2) Most suitable soil?
(3) Should they be dug up every year? (4)
Can they be grown from seed? —4808.
(1) They will grow in practically any
position, but protection from winds is desir-
able. (2) Light, sandy loam. (3) Yes; lift
the clumps, re-manure the beds, and replant.
(4) Yes; soak the seed for a while in warm
water.
What is the best treatment for chrysan-
themum clumps when they have finished
flowering ? —4812.
Separate the clumps and plant the strong
young shoots in a light soil. They will make
root-growth and be ready to set out in
October in the open garden. An occasional
dressing of lime is necessary to kill slugs,
which fatten on the new growth. Destroy
all leaves which turn brown, and thus pro-
tect the plants against rust.
Is there any historical basis for the story
of King Alfred and the cakes?— 4Bos.
No. At the time ascribed to the incident
by tradition Alfred was occupying the fort at
Athelney with a considerable force, continu-
ing his fight against the Danes, and could
not have been wandering the country a help-
less fugitive.
What is the difference between communism
and anarchism, and what is the relation of
these “isms” to socialism?— 4Bol.
Anarchists are opposed to the institution
of the State and government as well as to
the capitalistic system. Communism has
as its objective a State in which practically
military discipline is imposed in the interests
of propertyless workers. A socialist in
essence is one who believes that the owner-
ship of the means of production, distribution
and exchange should be vested in the general
public, and he may incline to either the anar-
chist or communist view as to how his
theories should be translated into practice.
There is also a philosophy of communist-
anarchism, to which, in an “Encyclopaedia
Britanniea” article, Prince Kropotkin says
he subscribed, and which he describes as a
system of free associations.
(1) What does the term “pot metal” mean
as applied to stained' glass? (2) What is
a Jesse unndow? (3) What is the earliest
colored window glass known? (4) Who first
applied it to architectural decoration? —
4810.
(1) Glass in which the coloring matter
has been introduced while the glass was
being made instead of being painted on to
plain white glass. (2) Jesse windows were
pointed or Gothic windows in which the
genealogy of Christ was arranged somewhat
in the form of a heraldic tree. They con-
sisted of mosaics of small pieces of pot metal
set in strips of lead which outlined the de-
sign. The glass was occasionally painted to
elaborate the forms suggested, but paint was
never used as a substitute, as in later
windows. (3) The earliest known dates from
the twelfth century. (4) Not definitely
known, but it is generally considered that the
pioneers were French architects of the
twelfth century.
How to remove rust from a launch engine
prior to painting, and most suitable paint?
—4344.
An application of kerosene and a good
scraping should remove the rust. Use a
chisel where there is heavy flaking. Red
lead and linseed oil make a suitable paint
basis.
Which of the -tolar planets are larger than
the earth, and which are smaller? —4789.
Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus are
larger; Venus, Mars, Pluto and Mercury are
smaller.
(1) Do spark-plugs deteriorate after long
service and should they he replaced by new
ones after the car has run for 10,000 miles?
(2) How is deterioration caused? —4759.
(1) A certain amount of deterioration
takes place between the electrodes where
the spark occurs, but this can be held in
check by keeping the surface of the elec-
trodes clean by means of a small file and
emery-paper. With proper attention plugs
should give good service for distances greatly
exceeding that mentioned. (2) Continued
exposure to very high temperatures is the
principal factor.
(1) When does the Q’land cane season
commence? (2) Experience necessary for
cane-cutting? (3) Day or contract basis of
wages? (4) Best localities? (5) Is it neces-
sary to join A.W.U.? —4470.
(1) The season has commenced north of
Townsville and in the Mackay, Ayr and
Proserpine districts The start in the Bun-
daberg and Nambour districts will depend
on weather. (2) Experienced cutters are
engaged in preference to inexperienced men.
(3) Mostly contract work at award rates,
so much per ton. (4) Cairns, Innisfail, Tully,
Ingham, Ayr, Proserpine, Mackay, Bunda-
berg and Nambour. (5) Not compulsory, but
practically universal.
(1) What is meant by “notional income”?
(2) How are the figures arrived at? (3)
Is the turnover of secondary industry taken
into consideration ? —4479.
(1) Home-produced income. (2) The
basis is income-tax returns, industrial awards
and agreements (to ascertain wages below
the taxation level), pension payments,
revenue derived by Government from rail-
ways and other enterprises, sales of land
and interest on loans to settlers, etc., and
rental value of dwelling houses, from which
items are deducted external interest pay-
ments. (3) Turnover is irrelevant. The
value of the services of the persons engaged
in secondary industries is computed.
Was Inigo Jones an Englishman? When
did he live, and for what was he famous?

Surveyor-General of Works; in 1619 he
devised his scheme for the rebuilding of
the Palace of Whitehall. His first project
was the comparatively modest palace designed
for James 1., to be elaborated many years
later into the magnificent conception com-
pleted for Charles 1., which has been a mine
of architectural ideas ever since.

(1) It was a tapestry made at Arras,

gold and silver. Arras was succeeded by
Brussels as the centre of the industry. (2)
For one thing, many of the greatest of the
early Flemish artists designed scenes from
the Bible and history for the craftsmen to
execute. (3) A guild or corporation of
tapestry weavers was formed in 1430, but a
guild is dissimilar to a trade union, in that
it includes employers and is concerned with
maintaining the high quality of the product.

tury there were 103 master weavers and
1500 workmen in Brussels alone.

CATTLE CAMP
“CATTLE CAMP” WAS AWARDED A PRIZE OF £lOO IN THE LATEST “BULLETIN” NOVEL COMPETITION.
By J.J.HARDIE
Synopsis : Margaret Kennedy, on her
way to Corella station, in North
Queensland, whither' she has been in-
vited by Tom Donaldson, father of
her school friend Peggy, is rescued
from a seemingly inevitable coach
crash by Ken Craig. Margaret falls
under the spell of Craig’s roman-
tic personality, though she resents the
fact that he is repeatedly doing
tilings that appear to her to put her
in his debt. He goes army to help a
queer character, Larry Nolan, with
his horses, and before he returns
to Corella Larry gives him a
magnificent black, which he calls
Eaglehawk, and the popular opinion
regarding which is that Larry must
have pinched it as a foal. Ken takes
Eaglehawk with him when he goes out
to take charge of the work at Cattle
Camp, where he is badly injured in
saving one of his men from being
gored by a bull, Margaret nurses
him, and rejects a somewhat offhand
proposal. Station life is suddenly
disturbed by the arrival of Mr. Borth-
wick, sent up by the city managers on
a visit, of inspection. Borthwich has
a sinister understanding with the
station book-keeper, Heath, and to him
intimates prospective changes. He
makes Ken a big offer for Eaglehawk
and is refused. He determines that he
will get the horse somehow. Soon
after Ken is doped in a hotel at
Carinda and is scorned as a, drunk
by Margaret. Recovered, he rides
away to where he had left the horses.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE dark line of the Five Mile timber
heralded the last lap, and Scotty, the
irrepressible, was still talking.
Dusty glanced impatiently back to the
boys following with the spare horses in a
musical jangle of bells and hobble-chains,
then glared belligerently at his exuberant
companion.
“If you can yap and yap like a flamin’
galah after two days in Carinda, I’d hate
to meet you after a month in Sydney!”
Scotty grinned at the weather-beaten
face. “An’ if you treated the Sydney whisky
like that Carinda stuff, ye would be a nice
sort of mate! Gosh! I hope Ken has the
billy on.” (
Dusty grunted in deep disgust. “No won-
der you got a thirst. That soft muck you
swallowed’d rot the soles of yer boots!”
Scotty became suddenly serious. “ I
wonder what really happened to Ken?”
His companion’s red-rimmed eyes flick-
ered and narrowed: “Slipped some sort of
dope on him.”
“But why? Were they after his money?
Or his horse? But he didn’t have Eagle-
hawk in Carinda!”
Dusty stared grimly ahead and shook his
head vaguely. “He hadn’t much of a
cheque on him—an’ they cleared before he
went out to it. They weren’t after his
dough!”
“Did he tell you who they were?”
“Only that one was a stranger—name o’
Holland.”
“I wonder if Ken went after him? Gosh!
I would like to meet the rotten mongrel!”
Dusty glanced sideways with a glint of
amusement in his eyes. “If you see Tom
Sanderson on his tracks ahead of you,”
he said, “hold back for a bit. Tom don’t
say much, but he seemed mighty interested
m this Buck Holland—might ha’ knew him
once.”
They cantered across the last rise and
saw the tin roof of Cattle Camp glinting
through the dark coolabahs. The camp
appeared strangely silent. No smoke rose
from the galley—not a sign of life any-
where.
Scotty looped his reins over a post and
dashed through the rooms, to reappear with
a bewildered air.
“Come over here!” shouted Dusty from
the bough-shed.
Scotty found him scrutinising a sheet of
paper roughly fastened to a post with horse-
shoe nails, and read aloud in amazed tones:
“Someone cleared out with the horses.
Heading north —Red Ridge way. Send
word to the boss. Get jresh horses from
bullock paddock and follow. Better bring
a gun. —K. W. Craig."
The two men looked at one another.
Dusty exclaimed, “Well, I’m damned!”
while Scotty repeated half to himself:
“Better—bring—a—gun!” His wide eyes
danced with the spirit of adventure.
“Your chestnut mare fresh enough?”
Scotty came out of the trance and nodded
quickly.
“Right! Old Mulga’ll carry me. Write
a note to the boss and I’ll get some tucker.
That cow must have about three days’
start.”
Within half an hour the pursuit had com-
menced. The thief had driven the horses
round behind the camp, leaving tracks that
even Scotty could not miss. But it was
the two boys who. read the details and sup-
running comments as they cantered
briskly along. About twenty horses had
been taken—Charlie pointed to individual
hoofmarks among the confused tracks,
naming the horse that made them with an
offhand air of certainty that made it appear
nothing short of supernatural.
The thief was riding a Corella horse—
old Straightwire—and was driving his own
horse with the others. He was evidently a
horseman, as Straightwire had bucked a
bit, according to the tracks.
“By cripes, that one Ken he go quick-
fella chasem!” Charlie pointed to a set of
deep tracks leading straight as an arrow
along the confused course.
Dusty closed on them. “Eaglehawk longa
mob, Charlie?”
“Yoh eye. Longa lead!” declared the
boy, jabbing a forefinger at the ground, then
asking thoughtfully, “Which way him go,
this pfella?”
“Damned if I know, Charlie. Looks like
he’s making for the Gulf. If he wanted to
get away with a mob, why didn’t he shake
’em out of a spelling paddock? He might
have got a couple of weeks’ start on us.”
The low, hog-back of the Red Ridge
loomed above the dancing mirage, grew dis-
tinct, and was left behind as they swept
on—still heading north. The sun dipped
low on the horizon, then slipped over the
rim of the world, and left the tiring men
on their weary horses, miles from any-
where.
“We’ll make a dry camp on the tracks
and start at daylight,” decided Dusty.
They dismounted stiffly where a belt
of gidya thrust out towards them; Scotty
started a fire and swept a patch clear of
bindy-eyes and pebbles, while Dusty and
Charlie drove the tired horses to the Boom-
erang Hole with the empty water-bags
flapping on their briskets.
Scarcely had they gone when the sound
of approaching hoofbeats brought Scotty
to his feet with a rush. Hastily he dived
for the automatic on his saddle and slipped
behind the sparse cover afforded by a low
gidya, cocking the pistol as he went.
A hail came from the darkness: “That
you, Scotty?”
“Who’s that?”
“Sanderson here.”
Scotty emerged cautiously as the tall,
lean horseman slipped quietly to the ground
on the edge of the circle of light thrown
by the fire. Scotty’s eyes glistened at the
glint of the blue barrel of the rifle he
leaned against a low fork.
“Ye didn’t waste much time getting away,
Tom.”
“Happened to be with the boss when
Teeny brought the message. Made for
the Ridge and cut your tracks.” His tone
was curt and laconic as usual, but he looked
up from hobbling his horse and observed
shrewdly: “Next time you sight a gun on
a man, get further away from the fire.”
The bay horse was done—completely
knocked up. He was too far gone to do
more than drag painfully on the taut reins
behind the silent figure of the man limping
ahead. Coated with sweat, his flanks and
neck black and dank, his head drooped
heavily, and black patches encircled the
wide, weary eyes.
Overhead the sun beat mercilessly down.
Sandflies in their millions wrapped them-
selves like an itching bandage, and flies
swarmed, buzzing and biting, all conspir-
ing to add to the agony.
The man turned despairingly. “Poor old
beggar!” he muttered hoarsely, then with
a deep curse at the clouds of maddening
flies, he dragged off the saddle and bridle.
The horse made no attempt to move. His
tucked-up flanks twitched and shivered as
he breathed in long sobs through, red
dilated nostrils. Painfully the man fumbled
at the saddle; then he turned slowly, his
eyes full of pain, the big revolver sagging
from one hand. He gazed long and stead-
ily at the wreck of the horse that had served
him faithfully. The long barrel rose slowly
and lingered a moment. The horse, dimly
comprehending, never shifted, but the star-
ing eyes full of dumb pain, rested beseech-
ingly on the man.
The long barrel dropped to his side. “I’ll
chance it!” he mumbled through swollen
lips. “G’bye, old fella!—I’ll be back!”
His bloodshot eyes swept the horizon,
looked long and despairingly at the faint
tracks that he must desert, then with a
glance at the brazen sun he plunged away
from the motionless horse.
Somewhere to the east, instinct told him,
lay Nolan’s hidden creek. Water! The
thought tormented him with an exquisite
agony.
He had staked all on the chance of cut-
ting down the lead the thief had obtained.
He was driving a mob of horses; a pursuer
travelling light should have gained quickly
on him. With a fresh horse he might, but
the bay horse had carried him back from
Carinda and needed a spell. He carried no
waterbag, had not waited to cook any
tucker—and he had failed. The thought
filled him with futile rage.
The sun blazed relentlessly on his stoop-
ing back; the eternally accursed flies piled
over one another to get at his aching eyes.
He could stand that if only he had a drink.
He plodded on through knee-high, curly
Mitchell grass—virgin country. Only Larry
Nolan’s wild horses up here, and the king
of them all gone—stolen; but he would get
the dirty rotten swine who stole him if
it took him the rest of his life.
The ground between the grass clumps
was covered with round, red pebbles. The
thin soles of the light, high-heeled riding
boots offered no protection against their
searing touch, and he felt that the soles
of his feet had turned to convex, swollen
aches that tingled to the top of his head.
Thoughts passed endlessly through his
mind as he plodded on, hardly conscious
of his progress. Somewhere at the back of
his mind he knew he was heading for water
—it was only a matter of being able to
stay the distance. Memories of a cool
stream winding between green, grassy
banks, under low, drooping willows, dragged
a husky, incredulous laugh from him. Hard
on the heels of the banished impossibility
came the remembrance of a day when he
thought he was thirsty. Thirsty! My
God! He had ridden along the dry river-
bed pounded hard by thousands of quest-
ing hooves, and had come upon the water-
hole—nearly dry—mere liquid mud covered
with a green slime. How he had
scrambled over the rotting carcases to get
at it!“ Oh for the chance to do it again!
Through the mad procession of reminis-
cences faces obtruded—long-lost faces of
his childhood; men he had long forgotten;
women, too —faces he had tried to forget.
And most incessant of all was the tantalis-
ing, elusive picture of a slim, dark girl, cool
and fragrant, against a background of wis-
taria, in a simple frock of the same shade
with white at neck and wrists.
Margaret! The grave eyes seemed to
beckon him on with the light of hope.
But she had turned him down! Her eyes
had looked through him—ignored him!
To Hell with all women ! He was done
with them—finally—for all time!
And he had come back to the only real
mate he had—to find him gone, too!
The accumulation of blinding hate, and
the hope of revenge, surged up again and
drove him on.
Larry Nolan discovered him on the steep,
muddy bank of the hidden watei’hole—
dazed, weak and retching from the effects
of a bellyful of water. The sharp, old eyes
had picked up The boot-tracks—a sight as
rare as snow in his almost inaccessible
domain—and he followed them with a feel-
ing of distrust and foreboding. Carefully
he circled the waterhole till he picked out
the figure of the man, wallowing weakly in
the mud, dragging painfully up the bank,
hesitating, with a backward glance, then
slipping back to cool his fevered body in
the thick, muddy fluid.
At the soft pad of approaching hoofs the
man looked up stupidly. The old, grizzled
figure asked no questions, wasted no time.
His eyes and his ability to put two and
two together told him enough. Stiffly he
scrambled down the bank and dragged the
incoherently protesting man covered with
slimy mud up the bank, and pushed him
into the dilapidated old wreck of a saddle.
Then he hobbled off, the lean old horse
dragging at rein-length behind.
“Where’s yer horse?”
The man now sitting propped against the
coolabah trunk looked up wanly at the
gruff question, then waved a limp hand
vaguely to the west.
“Far back?”
A husky noise in the throat sounded like
“Dunno!” but at the beckoning gesture,
Nolan slid down on his heels close to the
man and waited. Ken gulped a mouthful
of the hot, muddy water from the battered
pannikin, and the old man strained his ears
to catch the hoarse, muttered words issuing
spasmodically and painfully from the
cracked and swollen lips.
“Horse—knocked up.”
The unkempt beard jerked understand-
ingly. “What were yer doin’? Musterin’?”
Ken’s head shook emphatic denial.
“Tracking—horses—thief. Gone—that way.”
The twisted old figure stiffened to sudden
attention. “Thief stole a mob of Corella
horses? Is that right?”
Ken nodded assent.
“An’ the black horse?”
Again the vigorous nod.
A skinny arm shot out and grasped the
younger man’s shoulder. “Gone north, d’ye
say? Are ye trackin’ him on yer own?
Where’s the rest of the camp?”
“Carinda—races.”
Nolan rose swiftly to his feet. From a
fork of the tree he dragged a dirty sugar-
bag which he deposited beside the man at
his feet, shooting curt questions the while.
“How many men shook the horses?”
His eyes gleamed and narrowed as Ken
raised a single finger.
“Right! Then you stop here till I get
back. Tucker in that bag. Water in the
creek. What’s that?”
The younger man rose painfully to his
blistered feet.
“Get—me—horse. I’m coming!”
“Cornin’ be damned! I’m in a hurry,
and I only got this horse handy. What
d’ye say? Gun! I don’t need no gun!”
The broken teeth bared derisively.
Ken watched the hunched-up figure
appear at intervals as the bony old horse
carried him swiftly through the saplings
until they re-appeared no more; then he
slid wearily to the ground.
The three riders—two white men and one
black—-drew their jaded horses apart to
meet the little mob coming towards them.
They had seen several mobs of wild horses
that day, but these were no brumbies, and.
what was more, they were being driven.
The blackfellow uneasily pulled his horse
wide out to the flank. Dusty Rhodes and
Tom Sanderson exchanged a grim glance of
complete understanding, and rode silently
forward. If the thief expected sympathy, it
was not to be found on either of these
faces.
As the two groups neared each other
Dusty’s eyes roved over the approaching
horses, identifying them one by one. Only
about half the stolen horses were here—
where were the others?
Sanderson’s pale eyes were focussed on
the bent figure of the approaching horse-
man, and as he recognised Larry Nolan a
look of disappointment seemed to creep
over his face.
The two white men, leaving Silver to
round up the mob, halted a few lengths
from the silent rider and stared levelly at
him.
“G’day! Goin’ far?”
The hostile eyes under the dilapidated
hat deliberately swept the pair, travelling
up and down Sanderson and the carelessly-
menacing rifle.
“Dunno! Them your horses?”
“They are. Where’s the rest of them?”
“Got a bit of a scatter on by now.”
“Where did you get this mob?”
Nolan’s head jerked noncommittally
backwards.
Dusty moistened his lips and moved his
horse towards the old man. “S’pose you
know how they got there?”
Again the calm nod. “Got a good idea!”
“Know who took ’em, too, I s’pose?”
Dusty was mildly sarcastic.
“I might!”
Sanderson broke in with a curt “Who
was it?”
The old man hitched a leg across the
pommel of the saddle. “He didn’t give no
name—an’ it’s hard to tell what his face
looked like. Short and a bit bandy, an’
not the rider he reckoned he was.”
“Where is he now?” Dusty demanded im-
patiently.
The old man pointed with a thumb back
over his shoulder. “Ye’ll find him about ten
miles back—no need to hurry; he’ll be there
waitin’ on yeh. An’ you won’t need no
gun,” he ended significantly, his eyes on
Sanderson.
“How’s that?”
“He’s lyin’ back there with his head
bashed in. Serves him right, the thievin’
bastard!”
Both men edged unconsciously nearer.
Dusty’s head shot out on his scraggy, lined
neck like an old-man tortoise.
“Did Ken get him?”
Nolan shook an impatient head. “If ye
like to follow the tracks, they run to an
old yard o’ mine a couple o’ miles on. This
feller catches the black horse there and
leads him, driving the rest of the mob.
Then they run into a mob o’ my horses and
away they all go licketty-spit. Then the
bloke gits an idear—him an’ the black
horse gallops through the mob, scatterin'
them all roads—an’ them coverin’ his
tracks. He chases a mob o’ mine out to
the east till his own horse knocked up on ’im.”
The gruff voice hesitated, then took up the
story in a vindictive tone. “’E puts his
saddle on the black horse, then he shoot?
his own horse, and cuts out the brand—
the mongrel! Then e’ tried to ride the
black—an’ it’s the last thing e’ did!”
Dusty and Sanderson exchanged swift
glances. The yarn sounded feasible, but a
latent suspicion of the old hermit still
lingered.
Nolan glared derisively at the pair. “Well,
if ye want to see for yerself, foller them
tracks for ten mile and be satisfied! I
picked up them horses back there—some are
still runnin’ with mine. I’ll git them in a
day or two. S’long.”
“Wait a bit! Seen anything of Ken?”
The old man snapped over his shoulder:
“He’s at my camp. Done a bit of a perish.
Horse knocked up and left him with a ten-
mile walk. He’ll be back at your camp in
a day or two.”
The two men conferred in low voices,
then Sanderson rode on along the faint
tracks. Dusty called after the retreating
horseman: “Where’s your camp, Larry?”
“That’s my business!”
“I don’t want yer secrets —I want to take
Ken back.”
“Better leave him where he is for a day.
He’ll be back with the rest of the horses—
and the black.”
Dusty pondered a few minutes. “Tell
’im I’m campin’ on the Boomerang to-
night—back at Cattle Camp ter-morrer. An’
listen. If Scotty and Charlie are with im.
they can come back same time.”
The old man wheeled and cantered
rapidly away.
Dusty, watching him narrowly, wondered
at his aversion to strangers wandering over
his country. “Ye’d think he kep’ a flamin
harem there,” he soliloquised.
Ken rode quietly into Cattle Camp a day
behind the others. The black horse seemed

glad to be back, and rubbed an ear im-
patiently on the man’s shoulder as he leis-
urely unsaddled.
Ken was still puzzling over the strange
series of events, and still failed to find the
motive. Why had Holland doped him, in
the first place? If it had only been a case
of stealing the black horse, a thief had only
to slip in behind them when they left for
Carinda. There must be something deeper,
but what was it? Holland, who held the
key to the riddle, was dead. He had left
no clues—no papers had been found on
him. So his thoughts seemed to travel in
a circle, landing back at the exact spot
from where they started. The only person
who might know something was Heath; he
had introduced Holland in Carinda that
day, then had disappeared. What did Heath
know?
He moved slowly across to the verandah
and stretched his long legs out, leaning his
back against a post. The air was heavy
with heat, and only the flies seemed unde-
terred in their vigor. Ken was still weak
from the experiences of the last few days,
and he cursed the maddening insects with
peevish warmth.
Dusty’s spare form drifted across from
the creek and slumped against a neighbor-
ing post, with an offhand “G’day, Ken!
How you feelin’?” that failed to mask the
warmth in his tone.
“Not too bad, Dusty! Hpw’s every-
thing?”
“Pretty right.” The weather-beaten fea-
tures bent over the rolling of a cigarette—
a task that Dusty could ordinarily perform
with one hand on the back of a touchy
horse. The news of the past few days was
reviewed in an unhurried drawl—in short,
telegraphic sentences. All the horses had
been recovered; Clover had a bad back—
the result of hard riding under the thief’s
saddle. Ken’s bay horse had followed a
mob of Nolan’s brumbies to water and
was all right again. Sanderson had taken
O’Brien of the mounted police out to Hol-
land’s body. A good thing perhaps that the
black horse had settled the man. Sander-
son wouldn’t say much, but he looked dis-
appointed.
Ken’s eyes narrowed—the long, silent
stockman might be able to throw some light
on things. He would ride to the station in
the morning and have a yarn with Sander-
son—and with Mr. Heath! The lean jaws
clamped grimly on the pipestem. That
matter had to be cleaned up at once.
He did not notice Dusty rise and slouch
in doors till a thumb-mai’ked, square envel-
ope was thrust in front of him with a laconic
“Nearly forgot about this letter!”
Ken took it from him, his eyes on the firm
handwriting:—
MR. K. CRAIG,
Corella.
He had never seen Margaret’s handwriting,
yet he was certain the letter was from her;
and for a man who had renounced all women
in general and this one in particular, he felt
strangely agitated.
“Where did you get this, Dusty?”
“Carinda! Miss Kennedy hands it to me
before we pulled out.” There was a signi-
ficant pause. Dusty’s keen eyes were tak-
ing in the man’s effort to appear uncon-
cerned. “S’pose you didn’t know she’s
gone?”
“Gone!” All pretence was abandoned.
The bleached, tousled head nodded casu-
ally. “She didn’t come back after the races
—went straight down below.”
Ken rose unsteadily to his feet and
stepped into the blinding sunlight, with
the unopened letter clenched tightly in his
fist. “Guess I’ll go across and have a look
at the horses.”
A whirl of conjecture made him oblivious
to direction—to everything. He strode
blindly down the steep bank of the creek,
crossed below the diminishing waterhole
and found himself where the shade of the
coolabahs showed jet black against the sun-
baked earth. His eyes did not notice the
little knots of horses standing head and tail
in the shade, offering mutual assistance in
battling against the tormenting clouds of
insects. Did not even notice Eaglehawk,
still wet from the creek, every vein stand-
ing in relief on the satin coat, as he lifted
a questioning head.
The man paused, and with a hasty glance
around tore open the envelope. Better get
over with it.
“Ken Dear, —I have just had news that
my father is dangerously ill, so I am return-
ing immediately.
“I’m sorry we did not have a talk first —
there is so much to be cleared up between
us, and a letter is so unsatisfactory.
“First of all, Ken, I apologise for judg-
ing you so harshly yesterday. I did think
you had broken your promise—everything
pointed that way—and when I learned the
real facts it was too late; you had left
Carinda.
“I realise now that my judgment was too
hasty. I have tried to learn tolerance since
I came among you all, and I thought I was
succeeding, but I failed at the time I needed
it most. Forgive me, Ken!
“I can’t tell you how sorry I am to leave
Corella and all the people up here. I have
never met a finer lot of men, and the months
I have lived among you have taught me to
look differently on life.
“I may see you all again, but now I must
go back to my own life, and it is unlikely
that our paths will cross again. So this is
good-bye, Ken. Perhaps it is better that a
letter should say it.
“I want to thank you for everything you
have done for me. It took me a long time
to realise just how much that was, arid this
is a futile way of thanking you.
_ “Give my love to Eaglehawk—l woidd
like to have seen that beautiful horse again.
“Uncle Alan was right when he said that
our most valuable possessions in life are
friends. And 1 want you for my very, very
best friend, Ken.
“Good-bye,
Margaret.”
He stood stockstill with unseeing eyes
staring ahead. He was insensible to the
gentle nudging at his shoulder, till he stag-
gered at a heavier push to find Eaglehawk
beside him. A hand slid up the broad fore-
head and lingered caressingly round the
slender, pointed ears. “Boy! She’s gone!”
he whispered hoarsely.
The clean-cut head tossed in sympathy.
“She sent you her love! Her love! And
she wants me to be her friend—her very
very best friend! God! I’d sooner be you
for an hour than live to be a hundred!”
CHAPTER XVIII.
The first mob of bullocks, 1200 strong,
had been handed over to the drovers and
started on their eight-hundred-mile walk to
the south. Cattle were on the move every-
where. Grass and water were scarce along
the stock-routes, but cattle prices were good
and looked like being better, and the sta-
tions were mustering every marketable
beast while the prices held.
When Dusty Rhodes rode into Cattle
Camp after a visit to the station it was
evident to Ken and Scotty, awaiting supper
in the bough-shed, that something serious
had happened. Dusty’s air of casual uncon-
cern had vanished. Gone were the usual
unhurried movements. There was some-
thing vicious in his actions as he ripped
saddle and bridle off the sweating horse and
slung them to the ground.
Both men sat expectant as he stalked
towards them, halted in front of Ken and
glared belligerently. His bloodshot eyes
were redder than ever, and the sandy, wispy
moustache seemed to proclaim trouble from
every hair. Scotty broke the silence:
“What’s up? Store run out of tobacco?”
The red-rimmed eyes jerked round, and
Scotty subsided.
“They’re mad! Mad as a bag -of cut
snakes!”
Ken’s brow furrowed as he stared at the
gesticulating figure. “Why? What’s gone
wrong?”
Then the flood of Dusty’s eloquence burst
forth. Dusty held a reputation for embel-
lishment of the ordinary everyday figures
of speech that was not new to either list-
ener, but this time he excelled himself.
Vaguely they gathered that someone was
a flickering jumped-up, never-come-down
son .of the carmine, knocked-kneed, herring-
gutted, ewe-necked offspring of unmarried
parents. That rather than stand his san-
guinary, stupid, flamin’ mag, he (the ora-
tor) had told the blanky, four-eyed, ille-
gitimate to get floggin’-well cut and shut,
to make out his scarified cheque as fast as
his blindin’, crawlin’ self would let him,
then he could damn well run the entire Ver-
million box of tricks to blindin’, blisterin’
Hades.
Ken rose with a look of real concern on
his face.
“Do you mean you chucked it in,
Dusty?”
“Too flamin’ right I did! So will you
when that lousy, four-eyed pen-pusher
starts tellin’ you how to work cattle!”
“What do you mean?”
“The boss has got the sack! And they’ve
made that blasted Heath manager!”
“Wha—at?” Open incredulity showed on
both listeners’ faces.
“Wait till you hear ’im! He won’t have
this, and he won’t have that. I tell you
he’s goin’ round like a poisoned pup. Any-
how, the boss wants you to go in in the
morning. That other mongrel started to
give me some orders for you, but I told
him one boss at a time was plenty for me,
and he would never have the job.”
Ken and Scotty sat dumbfounded.
Good stockmen were hard to get, and
Ken knew that without Dusty his work
would be doubled.
A thought struck him suddenly. “Did
you hear if the place had changed hands?”
“So they reckoned. That pot-gutted
little mongrel that was here a while back
has bought it. He’s sacked the boss, and
put that other useless cow in. Him man-
ager! Strike me flamin’ dead! I could
write all he knows about cattle on a fly’s
eye with a bit of charcoal!”
(To be continued next week.)
Faith.
On slopes of Coomarimba
Long furrows meet the sun
That glances through the timber,
On dews of morning spun.
Day wakes, fresh gifts bestowing;
Abreast the horse’s stride
O’er loam’s red billowy flowing,
Where drill-combed tracks are showing
The march of autumn-sowing
Down harrowed spaces wide.
Like service-chimes repeating
Their message through the pines,
Toil’s measured pulse is beating.
The sermon of the tines,
Clean headland marges dressing
While homing horses wheel,
Is rich with notes of blessing
Which banish doubts oppressing.
Faith bears on wings caressing
The hymn of soil and steel.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
History repeated itself when Cenlight ran
away with the Australian Hurdle at Caul-
field. A similar victory was achieved by
Capintesta in 1914 and by Mediterranean in
1925. Cenlight, iike Mediterranean, started
at an outside price. He hails from the
Albury district. Reaching Melbourne with
a high reputation, Cenlight vanquished
Kendler at Williamstown in June, but shaped
very patchily afterwards, and was beaten
into third place by Full Hand and Gratify
at Moonee Valley a week before his big
triumph. Neither of these rivals could get
within coo-ee of him at Caulfield, which
shows what a wondrous thing public form
is. As much as 33 to 1 was laid against
Cenlight on the course; the “official” quota-
tion was 20 to 1. Don Wraight obtained
permission to let Cenlight slip along at his
own sweet will, and, ridden thus, the son
of Limelight (sire of Salitros, an A.J.C.
Derby winner) scored from post to finish.
There was such a muddling pace for the
first few furlongs that the plodding Olina
kept close to Cenlight, who clapped on speed
passing the stand for the first time. Howson
rode too much of a waiting race on the hot
favorite, Cockcrow, and when Cenlight drew
out for a 12 lengths’ lead a mile trom home,
with Olina still second and Cockcrow three
lengths farther off, the joyous clatter of
McShortodds rose shrilly above the moans
of punter victims. In 1927 Arcadius had
the race won when he fell with Wraight at
the last flight. Don remembered that ex-
perience, and took particular care to avoid
its recurrence. Landing safely, he reached
the judge nearly two lengths ahead of the
favorite, who cut Olina oiit of second money
Sy half a neck. Full Hand was a close

Cenlight is trained by George Murrell,
who was associated with two of the three
Australian Hurdle wins achieved by Roisel.
He belongs to Mrs. A. M. Pierce, whose late
husband bought the gelding as a two-year-old
Por £25. .Tack Pierce was a brother of Kerry
Pierce, now racing Clarius and other Vic-
torian-acquired horses in Queensland. Re-
deemer, on whom Adam Skirving (trainer of
Waterline) won the Australian Hurdle of
1900. was bred by Jack Pierce. The two
brothers inherited Greg Greg station, near
Corryong. Kerry Pierce disposed of his
portion, and bought into the Brmgenbrong
property, where Trafalgar was bred. 'Gen-
his owner down at Moonee Valley,
but her relatively small gamble at Caulfield
gave handsome heturn. # . .
Waterline’s success in the Moondah Plate
overshadowed what iCenlight accomplished, for
interest in jumping events is declining,
whereas the spring carnival has begun to
engage eager discussion. After competing in
the Doncaster Handicap, Waterline devel-
oped severe influenze. Wisely thrown out
of training and turned out for a spell on
the property of his owner, “S. A. Rawdon,”
in the Goulburn Valley district, Waterline
made a splendid recovery. Backers were
sceptical about his condition, and allowed
the M.L.-bred galloper to go out at 8 to 1.
Class told, and Waterline; finishing like
the good horse that he is, won brilliantly
from Zanibar and Green Moth.
' .. ’ , *
The comeback of Waterline is a happy
augury for what will happen to Phar Lap
in the months that lie ahead. Phar Lap has
not raced since Waterline lowered his colors
in the C. M. Lloyd Stakes at Flemington
last March. His state of health caused
Harry Telford a lot of anxiety, but these days
the son of Night Raid is bucking out of his
skin with vitality. Fujisan, now trained
by Cecil Godby, figured in the race which
Waterline captured. There was little or
no money for the old Sydneysider, but he is
reported to have shown a smart trial, and
may be heard of soon on Melbourne courses.
So, too, will Harry Gavin, who was unlucky
not to gain a place.
Next Saturday the Australian Steeple-
chase is down for decision. Lack of
in the acceptors is disclosed by old Ancient*
Mariner sharing favoritism with Bestman.
The latter will be advantaged by having Bob
Inkson on top. He made an excellent show-
ing (though unplaced) in the _ Wilgah
Steeplechasers’ Flat on the opening day.
Kentle lost ground at the start, but finished
fairly well. The rival from whom Bestman
may have most to fear is Ferner, who has
done well in training since # he fell at the
final fence in the Grand National when run-
ning second to Rakwool.
Selections:—
Arkaringa Hurdle: Isocrates; next, Ocean
Bound.
Australian Steeple: Bestman; next,
Ferner.
Balaclava Stakes -. Dark Man; next, Pen-
dennis.

The inexhaustible First Acre began his
tenth year, and his eighth season on the
turf, by winning the August Handicap at
Warwick Farm in dashing style. His suc-
cess was anticipated by A. D. Webster, whose
son was in the saddle, but Ring Boy, at 5 to
2, was a point shorter, though handicapped
to give First Acre 61b. over a distance —a
mile and a quarter —at which he has rarely
shone. Lord Kennaquhair (4 to 1) was in
front most of the way, but he was easily dis-
posed of by the ancient at the finish, though
he managed to beat Ring Boy for third place ;
Sarchion and Antioclius were the nearest of
the others. First Acre carried 81b. more
than the Bst. 51b. he has in the Metropolitan,
but, of course, the field for that race will be
decidedly better.
- Chide, Toper, Pavilion, Waugoola, Loqua-
cious and Movie Star were given pipe-openers
in the Denham Court Handicap. None of
thein was forward enough to win, or even
to be backed with any heart (though there
were a few pounds for Toper), nor did any
finish in the first eight—there were 19
runners. Victory rested with little King
Crow (6 to 1), ridden by Pratt, who cut
down Tom Pinch (5 to 1) and the favorite,
Eulclare, in the straight. King Crow’s pre-
vious win was on the same course; in the
interim he had run a heartbreaking lot of
seconds and thirds.
Black Douglas also shows his best form
at Warwick Farm, but he had been so long
out of the money that he was allowed to go
out at 7 to 1 for the Edensor Park Handicap
—though at the close of operations a few
daring spirits offered tens. Seven to one is
a long price these days, when the average
McShortodds is indisposed to take the slight-
est risk —in two races on Saturday it was
7 to 1 bar five; in another, 6 to 1 bar four.
Straightout, place and doubles totes would
wake these gentlemen up—the competition of
the 60-20-20 machine they despise. Black
Douglas had the services of Cook, who
headed the jockeys’ list during the 1930-31
season; and Cook brought him along with a
well-judged run to beat Royal Tune (6 to 1)
and Mr. Kerry (9 to 2) ; but Royal Tune,
who, having lOst. 61b., was giving the very
useful winner 201 b., ran an excellent race.
For Moorefield on Saturday:—
Flying Handicap: Labor Girl; next,
Legislator.
Moorefield Handicap: Black Douglas;
next, Flinders.
Rockdale Mile: Amanullah; next, Bonawe.

“Hotham”: The V.R.C.’s annual report
and balance-sheet show that stages tor the
year ended June 30 totalled £94,353, making
£3,321,604 distributed since the club was
founded in 1864. Following on the passing
of the totalisator laws the club contracted
for the erection of large-scale machines at
headquarters and these" should be ready for
use at the October meeting. The profit for
the year on a turnover of £147,199 was only
£3302—n0 wonder heavy cuts in added
money have been decided on for the curren-
yea?.

“Knavesmire”: This year’s A.J.C. Derby
looks like being the last of the £BOOO classics
for many years to come. It will also be tuc
most valuable race in Australia for this
year, since the Melbourne Cup added money
has been cut to £7OOO. In spite of its value,
the Derby has never attracted big fields, though
the nominator is only committed to a total
of £33 by the time his horse faces the bar-
rier. The English Derby conditions call
for a sweepstakes of £lOO to start with, and
after that there is a nomination fee of £5O,
payable a couple of months before the race,
in addition to other fees. Yet large fields
are the rule in England.

Some good boxers are coming across trorn

Again displaying form that marks him
as the best Aussie boxer of his weight,
Fred Hannaberry (list, lilb.) carried
too many guns for Jimmy Pearce (list.
lib.) at Leichhardt last Friday night.
Pearce has been boxing; since early 111 19-3,
and proved . too knowing for Hannaberry
(who had his first fight on April 1,193 U)
until the less experienced pug got going
properly. Precise punching, as well as
tigerish aggression, then gave Hannaberry
a big lead, and late in the eighth round a
left uppercut knocked the Novocastrian out
on his feet. Pearce staggered to his corner
at the bell and could not come up again.
Scientific boxing was conspicuous by its
absence from the Sydney Stadium pro-
gramme on Saturday night, but plenty
of slatherumwhack was seen. The Roy
Rogers (list. 41b.)-Cyril Richards (list.
91b.) six-rounder which topped the bill
furnished some fierce fighting. Richards
earned a draw, as in the last clash between
the pair. Rogers got the decision, however.
Footbrawl
Though their opponents were badly handi-
capped by injuries and team rearrangements,
N.S.W. Rugby Union players deserve all
credit for their fine win at the Cricket
Ground on Saturday, when Queensland, easy
victors in the first match, were beaten 37-6
—7 tries, 5 converted and 2 penalty goals
to a try and a penalty goal. The disorgan-
ised Queenslanders showed little of the dash
of the previous Saturday, while the Welsh-
men, with an improved side and a weaker
opposition, played at their top, completely
outclassing their opponents in the back play
while holding their own in the packs with
the formidable Northern forwards. Towers,
indifferent a week before, was in great buckle
at. centre, with plenty of sterling support from
Herd and Primrose, the latter showing form
at five-eighth which deservedly won him
selection for the Australian side in the trial
match. Hemingway played a determined
game, and also won his way to the 15 elect.
Palfreyman and Cerutti were the pick of an
improved forward side, which, however,
was no match for the visiting vanguard in
the loose. Queensland fell down in the back
division. Hayes, who had shown such rare
form at centre, had to drop back to replace
the injured Steggall at full. Clark filled
his place with distinction, but the shifting
about of the other inside backs took all the
devil out of them, and they were no match
for Herd, Towers, Primrose and co. Queens-
land lost two men in the first half, but these
were replaced. Two more went in the
second, including the star winger, Lindsay,
and the visitors finished the game with 13
men, playing a six pack,

Saturday’s chief Melbourne game was
staged at Footscray, where South Mel-
bourne’s chances of reaching the finals
slumped heavily. For some abstruse reason
tbe southerners played like a lot of hopeless
and ’Scray simply ran over
jfi em , winning by 68 points to 41. Geelong
came up to St. Kilda and achieved an unex-
pectedly easy win—loo to 52. Richmond’s
Tigers outed North Melbourne by 108 to 69:
Gollingwood totted up 103 to Hawthorn’s
gg. and Carlton secured 121 to Fitzroy’s 89.
The closest game was that between Melbourne
and Essendon, the Red Legs, 011 their own
g rou nd, beating the ’Dons with the last kick
0 f- the day—72 points to ’Don’s 71. With
fi vc games yet to be played, it looks as if
“the four,” as last season, will be Richmond,
Geelong, Carlton and ’Wood, though they
may not finish in that order. During the

“Gate”: Cricketers and footballers, who

Me ih oU rne. Most of the big grounds are
held by the cricket clubs, and these make
the devotees 0 f the winter game pay through
t j ie nose f Ol . the use of the arenas. The case
of a recent match between Carlton and
Richmond is being quoted by the indignant
- b allers. There was a gate of £960; the
Richmond c . C. collected £460, and the
f oot ball clubs £225 apiece. At the Fitz-
roy_Melbourne game the gate was £135,
o f' w hich the two football teams got only
between them. It is reckoned that it

Gate : Like its contemporaries of the
Rugby Union and Rugby League, tlie N.S.n.
Australian Football League _ reports a con-
siderable increase in gate-takings on those of
last season. In tlie face of the financial depres-
sion this seems peculiar at first sight, but it is
probably a case of an ill wind blowing some-
one good. Many men who formerly spent their
Saturday afternoons at the horses or the
ponies have been compelled by the fell clutch
of circumstance to fall back on the cheaper
thrill of footer, with corresponding benefit
to the ’bailers.

Eastern Suburbs, leaders in the Sydney
Rugby League competition, met defeat for
the second time this season at the Sports
Ground on Saturday, when Western Suburbs,
1930 premiers, scraped home by 13-12—i>
tries and 2 goals to 2 tries and 3 goals. The
game was fast and open, play being very
hard, with several injuries resulting. At
half-time West, in the lead by 6-2, shaped
like winners. A great rush by the Eastern-
ers, which included two fine tries l?y winger
Tottey, brought East to the front by a
point. The last few minutes provided a
great tussle until a fine penalty kick by Corn-
well put tlie Westerners ahead. Univer-
sity, leading at half-time, went down to New-
town at Marrickville by 32-13, Ellis kicking
7 goals for the winners. At North Sydney
St. George beat the locals 17-12 in a game
that was nothing to write home about. At
Earl Park, South Sydney toyed with Bal-
main, finishing with scores 26-S in _ their
favor. East now leads from West in the
competition by 2 points—2o to 18.

The M.L. cricketers went under in the
second Test at the. Oval. .Tardine closed the
English innings with 4 down for 416: Sut-
cliffe (117), Duleepsinhji (100) and Ham-
mond (100 n. 0.). Maoriland could do.no
better than 193 (Lowry 62) and 197 (Vivian

Footbrawl
“Stand Off”: Few football followers real-
ise how great an influence a referee may
have on the form displayed in a match.
When Queensland and a metropolitan side
met in Sydney in a mid-week match (the
Sydney lads won) there was general complaint
at the finish of the slowness of the game,
Referee Irving pulled both sides up for
the most trivial infringements, and often
for happenings that were not obvious to the
onlookers. There was too much of the letter
and too little of the spirit of the law in his
conduct of the game, and this was soon
reflected in the play in general and the atti-
tude of some of the players, who were obvi-
ously listening for the whistle whenever they
attempted to do anything.
“Old Q-”: N.S.W. Rugby football has of
late been visited by an epidemic of goals
kicked from the field. That is all to the
good, but unfortunately it has resurrected vet-
erans who have flooded the sporting columns
with yarns that the average fisherman would
blush to father of the days when dropping
goals from the field was a commonplace in
the existence of every Rugby footballer. The
writer for one does not agree. In the Middle
Ages of the game in Australia, when this
goal-kicking was supposed to be at its
apogee, he took part in some 15 games
against N.S.W. and Maoriland sides. In
all that time he saw only two goals dropped
from the field. One was by Fred O’Rourke
for Past Grammars against N.S.W. in Bris-
bane in 1895, when the ex-schoolboys hand-
somely downed the Light Blues, and the other
was Percy Colqulioun’s goal against Queens-
land on Sydney Cricket Ground the follow-
ing year.

“Amateur Pro”: Early last week, strong
men perusing their morning paper on the
way to work, “might have been seen,” as the
mid-Victorian novelists put it, to turn pale
and rush violently into the nearest pub.
They were staunch Rugby Union supporters
who read that Johnny Wallace, of Oxford,
Scotland and the Wai’atahs. had been dis-
covered more or less sui’reptitiously playing
League football in the rural neighborhood
where he now has his being. The fact auto-
matically makes Johnny a pro. under the
R.U. rules as to professionalism, but no
doubt the matter will be allowed to pass.
The N.S.W. Union in particular has swal-
lowed bigger pills than that. One of its
ex-officials, and a very high-placed one, too,
once told a Sydney daily paper how in the
days of his youth he had twice been given
better, jobs because of his football ability.
That is also an act of professionalism under
R.U. law, but nothing was done. The offi-
cial remained in power for years, so conse-
quently all members of the R.U. associated
with him became professionals too. But per-
haps I had better shut up; the inference is
too painful.
4! * 4: 4=
“Rend Mud”: Bob Lindsay, the hefty
wing three-quarter from Toowoomba, who
has been such a success with the Queensland-
ers in Sydney, is a good example of how
great a part luck plays in the making of a
football l-eputation. Not even selected in
the reserves of the State team, he was picked
to fill the place vacated by the Australian
rep., McGhie, and emphatically made good.
Ha learned his football in the League game,
going over when the Darling Downs capital
returned to the amateur code. He is a more
than useful place-kick also, and in the first
Sydney match came close to a Queensland
record for scoring in one match, notching
10 points from a try and goals. R. Will-
cocks, a full-back who turned out for Queens-
land some 20 years or so ago, has the record
with 11 points. Had Lindsay taken a kick
from which Steggall scored he might have
hoisted 13 points.

“Lilywhite”: An unusual football happen-
ing threatens from Bathurst (N.S.W.).
The local Rugby Union and Rugby League
propose to stage a match for charity, play-
ing League rules one half and Union the next.
It is stated that the N.S.W.R.U. when con-
sulted as to. the amateur status of the Union
players taking part in the match made the
rather surprising reply that it was a matter
for the Bathurstians to decide for them-
selves. The Union rules as to professionalism
distinctly state that to play on any ground
where gate-money is taken in a contest
where it is previously agreed that less than
15 players on each side shall take part is an
act of professionalism, and there is no men-
tion of discretionary powers being vested in
any governing authority.
4: 4= 4: *
“Hampstead”: The followers of Austra-
lian football in Sydney are a class hushed
and apart—save, perhaps, when they are
barracking. The thi’ee English codes
have overshadowed the national game, and
though there are stalwarts from Yarraside
who cling with undying affection to Mel-
bourne football and Melbourne beer the public
stays away for the most part—from the foot-
ball, anyway. A lot. of this apathy is due
to the failure of Victoi’ia and other Aus-
tralian-rules States to do missionary work,
as it were, in Sydney. The Rugby Union and
League, and in a lesser degree the Soccer
folk, have profited greatly by the annual
visits of representative teams. The con-
trary is the case with the Australian game,
and this year the Vic. League refused to
dispatch a representative XVIII across
the Murray. The League’s rival, the
Association, has come to the rescue,
and is sending its best side to play
in Sydney on August 15. Tbe Associa-
tion standard is little, if anything, inferior
to that of the League, and a good exposition
of one of the most fascinating forms of foot-
ball may be counted on as a certainty.
$
“Inside Right”: The Australian Soccer
side chosen to tour Java has suffered some-
what by the refusal of N.S.W, to allow
its players to serve under the Australian
Association banner, though four of the men
have defied the League, and accepted the
offer.. These four make up the Ma State's
contribution, Victoria having five in the side.
South Australia four and Queensland five. E.
Luk.eman, secretary of the Australian Asso-
ciation, who managed the last tour in the
same quarter of the world will again be in
charge, assisted by J. O. Wilshaw, chairman
of the Victorian Association.
Racquet and Bawl
“Let” : Though England went down against
France in the Davis Cup Challenge round,
the challengers fought hard. The only
obstacle in their path was the imperturb-
able Cochet, who, in spite of an alleged attack
of tennis elbow, won the match for France off
his own racket, winning the doubles with
Brugnon in addition to taking both his
singles from Austin and Perry. Both the
latter accounted for Borotra, and it is evident
the bounding Basque volleyer is not the
player he was. With Lacoste finished and
Cochet no longer young, the French outlook
for the future is gloomy. Perhaps the hour
wijl produce the man, as is apt to happen
in France.
4= 4* 4= 4=
“Cut Shot”: Gerald Patterson on his
recent return from America had some inter-
esting things to say of Bill Tilden, whom he
intei-viewed about coming to Australia. Bill
was willing, but not with the exchange ques-
tion as it is at present. Tilden is ixow a
business man, the business being tennis, and
heads an organisation known as Tilden’s
Tennis Tours Incorporated. The troupe
travels all over the country, showing in
elaborately-fitted indoor courts to packed
houses. He has two fine young players with
him in Seller and Pare, while Hunter and
Kozeluh are the leading .stars in addition to
himself. If things improve, next year will
probably see the company in Australia.
4= 4 ; * *
“Baseline”: Thanks to the efforts of
Norman Brookes, who has lately been in that
part of the world, Japan will probably send
over a team of four in December and Januai’y.
Two mentioned as certain to come are
I-larada and Jiro Satoh. The former was
placed in the world’s best half-dozen by
Tilden a year or so ago, while Satoh is the
best of the younger generation of Nipponese
players. Besides playing in the various State
capitals, the visitors will add. interest to the
Australian championships.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Fitzcray”: The Victorian professional
golf championship last week resulted in an
interesting neck-and-neek struggle between
W. Fowler, of Ballarat North, and Reg
Jupp, of Metropolitan, State champion in
1929. The course was sodden and slow, and
a strong wind made the going more difficult,
but both men played good golf, Fowler finish-
ing 2 up on the 36th green.

“Hotham”: Melbourne has been exposed
lately to such a series of deluges that the con-
struction of an ark is being seriously consid-
ered. For this reason W, Meadei*, secretary of
the Victorian Golf Association, has issued a
pronunciamento transferring the venue of the
State championships from the Yarra Yarra
course (B. 29/7/’3l) to the Victoria course,
where the issue is now being fought out. Yarra
Yarra is liable to flooding, and though an
extensive drainage scheme is in hand there
is no hope of its being completed for some
time to come. Handicap events for the meet-
ing, which were set down for decision at
Yarra Yarra, have been cancelled, and
entrance money is to be refunded.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: The introduction of the
new larger and lighter golf ball by the Ameri-
can golf authorities has come perilously close
to starting another civil war. As expected,
it makes little diffei’ence to the experts, but
the rank and file of mug golfers, who are in
the vast majority, have already realised that
for them the new gadget is a sorrow’s crown
of sorrow. At one swanky club the members
tear down the notice enjoining the use of
the new ball as fast as it is posted, and the
club professional has been compelled to stow
away his stocks of the new pill and lay in
supplies of the old.
# 4< * *
“Anxious”: “Bloggs” (B. 24/6/’3l) says
that “there isn’t a golfer in the land with
more than an outside chance of scoring a
two at the shortest of the holes at the Lakes
course.” What about T. J. Jones, who
negotiated the 6th—lsl yards—in one on
July 25? Talking about longer holes,
what about Frank B. Smith, who negotiated
the 2nd from a blind tee through a dog-leg
course—3B6 yards, Bogey s—and5 —and was down
in 2 (3 under Bogey). The score-card was
signed by his opponent and the feat wit-
nessed by two caddies. Seeing that Smith
was entitled to a stroke at the 2nd hole,
thus giving him a net one on the Bogey 5,
what is the correct nomenclature for this
hit?

“Glenelg”: Rufus Stewart (B. 29/7/’3l)
has been amplifying his comments on overseas
golf. The gist of his sermon is that Aus-
tralians must make up their minds to con-
centrate on the short game if they are ever
going very far in golf, and regard the
acquisition of an accurate putting sense as
a religion. As evei’y Australian golfer
knows, the long driver is the most admired
man in the game on this side as far as the
golfing multitude is concerned. Rufus, him-
self a mighty swiper, points out that Tommy
Armour, the Scottish-American, who won the
last British open championship, can be out-
driven from the tee by dozens of his contem-
poraries. In- approaching and putting he is
unexcelled among present-day golfers.
Stewart says that all the American players
he saw concentrate on the same aspects of
the game, putting especially. If any doubt
the wisdom of this policy let them have a
look at results in recent matches wherein
American and British golfers have been
opposed.
* *
“Hoylake”: An old controversy lias been
revived in England as to whether cricketers
should play golf. The case of Percy Chapman
now an ai’dent golfer and of late fallen from
his high estate as a great hitting batsman
and England’s captain, is being freely quoted.
The inevitable Hobbs has been referred to
and is of the opinion that the Royal and
Antient game spoils cricket form. He says
the follow-thi-ough is different, though those
who have seen such driving batsmen as
F. G. Ford will not agree, even with the
great Surrey pro. There have been many
examples of men who have excelled in both
games playing them contemporaneously. A.
E. Stoddart, one of England’s greatest
amateur batsmen and a plus-marker at
Blaekheath Golf Club, was only one of many
R. H. Bettington, an Oxford cricket and golf
Blue, is a modern Australian instance.
Car and Cycle
“Formula” : A recent development in the
motor trade is the growing tendency of
British makers to design a car suited to
Australian conditions. One of these, the
new Vauxhall, a 26-li.p. 6-cylinder job, is
shortly to be given a trial over Australian
roads'by General Motors. The car will start
from Melbourne to Adelaide, returning to
Melbourne by a different route and then going-
on to Sydney. From Sydney to Brisbane and
back again to Melbourne, a total distance of
about 4000 miles, will complete the trial,
which will be conducted with a sealed bonnet,
the engine running night and day. Two
drivers will handle the car, which is a
touring model with an extra fuel-tank.
4! 4! 4: 4=
“Tenakoe”: Norman Smith (B. 29/7/’3l)
has by all accounts made up his mind to
tackle the world’s speed record on the Ninety-
mile Beach in November, in spite of the
warning that the beach would not then be
at its best by a long way. He will ship his
big car over in October, to have time for
tuning up. For six days in each month the
beach is flooded by high tides, which leave
it very hard and smooth, and it is during one
of these peiiods that the attempt on Malcolm
Campbell’s record will be made. In the
meantime, tha car is to be shipped to. Bris-
bane, where it should be a star attraction at
the big annual show held this month.
“Worm”: The South Australian and West-
ralian Governments have gone a long way to
lighten the lot of the motor-owner by per-
mitting motor-registration fees and taxation
tp be paid half-yearly instead of annually as
at present, N.S.W. owners have been trying
to get the same concession for years, and will
probably now make another attempt. The
scheme has everything to recommend it and
could be further improved by permitting
quarterly payments. The extra expense for
clerical work, etc., would be trifling, and in
any case could be met by a small surcharge,
as in cases where insurance premiums are
paid quarterly.

“Differential”: The coming of the small
car has revolutionised some theories with
regal’d to intei’nal-combustion engines. Few
would have believed some years ago that the
tiny engines could function at such a high
rate as 5000 revolutions a minute for any
length of time without flying to bits. The
latest small car on the market —-English,, of
course —goes furthei*, for the 8.7-li.p. engine
can be run up to 6200 revs, a minute. The
complete engine, mostly made of aluminium
alloy, weighs only 120 pounds, or about
double the weight of the engine flywheel in
many cars now running.

“Sprocket”: The long-drawn-out Tour de
France cycle race over 3184 miles of French
roads ended last week, the winner being
Antoine Magne, of France, with 177 hr.
lOmin. 3sec. of riding time. Belgium headed
the international placings with France second,
the Australia-Swiss team being behind Ger-
many, with Italy last. Opperman was twelfth ;
Lamb 35tb. Weather conditions were bad
and both men lost a lot of weight. Opper-
man will tackle the Paris-Brest race of 750
miles, and in the meantime is off to ride in
Copenhagen.
Miscellaneous
“Spike”: The athletic matches Harvard-
Yale v. Oxford-Cambridge, which began in
1899, when the English universities won at
the old Queen’s Club convincing ground, look
like developing into an annual event. The
Yanks have generally had the better of mat-
ters. The latest meeting at Stamford Bridge
last month saw the visitors winners by 7i
points to 41. Usually the Americans am
undefeatablein the sprints and short hurdles,
leaving the longer distances to the British.
This time the boot was on the other foot,
Britain taking the 100 and 220, while
America walked off with the quarter- and
half-mile.

“Aileron”: Mere man, who had his eye
wiped by the opposite sex in the event last
year, made no mistake in the King’s Cup
race round Britain on the latest occa-
sion, Flying-officer Brown, of the R.A.F..
winning with an average speed of 117.8
m.p.h. for the thousand miles covered.. He
was only three minutes ahead of Gibson,
another R.A.F. man, and used a Bluebird
’plane, a make fairly well known in Aus-
tralia. Heavy rain and mist caused a lot of
the competitors to drop out. One of these
was Winifred Brown, who won last year
soon after Amy Johnson had captured atten-
tion with her flight to Australia.
* * * *
iC. T. Studd, whose death in the Belgian
Congo, where he had been a missionary for
years, has been reported, was a unit of one of
the cricketing families which have been so con-
spicuous in the game in England and Aus-
tralia. A fine all-rounder, he and lus brothers,
G.B. and J.E.K., made the Cambridge eleven
of the ’eighties one of the strongest sides in
England, and later did good service for
Middlesex. C.T. played for England in the
famous 1882 match at the Oval when Mur-
doch’s Australians won by 7 runs. Studd’s
contribution was 0 and 0 not out, but he did
better in Australia the following year with
Ivo Bligh’s side, averaging 24 with the bat
in all matches and taking 60 wickets. In
his five Test matches at home and in Aus-
tralia he had a batting avex-age of 20, but
took only 3 wickets. Brother G.B. also
figured for England in several matches in
England and Australia.
4! 4: 4=
“Blue Chalk”: Something new in the bil-
liard line threatens from Sydney. N.S.W.
has an association of licensed billiard-table
proprietors, and these propose to form a
Federal executive council to control the
game throughout the Commonwealth. Whether
the scheme is to include existing amateur
bodies is not stated, but this seems unlikely.
However, the programme provides for the
institution of a uniform set of rules of play
for all the States, and inter-State matches
between teams and individuals will be an-
other feature. If successful, the idea should
help to improve the general standard of the
game in this country, and that is sorely
needed.

Distinguished Social Life.
Anyway, why all this fuss about money?
Our fathers made a fetich of gold; our gen-
eration manages very well on paper money;
perhaps the next will make merry over the
game of bartering, or swaps. Money can’t
buy a sunset, or a rhyme for a poet, or
color a rose. It can’t buy a faithful husband,
or a contented wife, or the peace of God.
Too long it has overshadowed us with its
tyranny. Let’s ignore it for a while.
A very good citrus crop has filled the
busiest sections of George and Market streets
with mounds of gold. Even the police are
human; and there has been no quick move-
on order for the barrowman—mostly quite
new at the game—who has pulled up along-
side the pavement. The shopkeepers have
been very human about it, too, and have only
squealed a little when the stalls made a per-
fect barricade. But what poverty of ideas
in the stalls!
The most
daring broke
no further
from oranges
than to stock
pin eapples.
Still this
Letter can
see a change
coming with
a new class
of coster.
Perhaps in
the next
Long Vacation their Honors of the Supreme
Court, unable to pay their bills out of the
five hundred a year good Mr. Lang would
allow them, will set up stalls in the Paris
manner for second-hand books and pictures
—say, behind St. James’s.
The Royal Art Society, now in its 52nd
year, is still a hardy annual. It drew many
to its private view, and a multitude to its
opening by Ludmayor Jackson on Saturday.
Pottering about the canvases on Friday were
the art-buyers and highbrows. Knight Mungo
MacCallum and his black-and-white top-
coated lady, stood warming themselves for
quite a while before Syd Long’s “Reflec-
tions.” These are mirrored in the McDonald
River, and will continue in perpetuity their
burnished slumber on the walls of the
National Gallery. The same harborage
has fallen to Dattilo Rubbo’s “Australian
Flowers,” and while this is a noble fate it
seems to this writer a cold one. How much
happier a picture must be in a jolly home
surrounded by members of a large family!
Alfred Coffey held quite a levee before his
etchings, which combine nobility of line
with humility of price. J. S. Watkins and
Taster Lister were artist notables, and Dr.
Abbott, now returned by grace of liver-extract
and such-like to his old haunts, dawdled
about the rooms talking in animated fashion
to Miss Sarah H’ynes and Mrs. Keith Jopp.
Every year (and one suspects the Archi-
bald Prize influence) there seem to be more
portraits sent into the show. Mary Edwards
is seen in a self-portrait, all dead-white
dress and pale-gold hair. Mrs. Florence
Taylor, from Jerrold Nathan’s brush, and
Kelso King’s lady, by W. L. Calderwood, are
two other well-known Sydney women who
gaze from the walls on the many friends
who pause before them,
George Johnston, whose sketch of him-
self has been bought by the Gallery, is
young enough to get a thrill out of his suc-
cess and shy enough to have kept (at the open-
ing) the length of the gallery between him
and his work. When this Letter met him
he was standing with the Morgan O’Neills,
of Neutral Bay, before Percival Norton’s
portrait study of their bright-faced Mary.
The Fellowship of Australian Writers is
busy arranging a testimonial to Steele Rudd.
This will take the form of two play nights,
and will occupy St. James’s Hall on the
21st and 22nd of August.
Captain J. B. Stevenson (who has been
captain-superintendent of naval estab-
lishments) and his hospitable wife are
leaving the city and the nice old naval
home, Tresco, in Elizabeth Bay. The new
c.-s. is Captain Feakes. In the meantime
the Stevensons are standing up nobly to a
round of farewell parties; two of the gayest
last week were arranged by Mrs. G. F. Hyde
and by Mrs. Feakes.
The Harry Burrells, of platypus renown,
went off early this week to Carmarthon, their
station at Manilla. This will be their address
for an indefinite time, and nobody will be
more missed from charity committees than
the generous Mrs. Burrell.
Jean Albert Gustave d’Alpuget (“Dal,” as
he was known throughout the Pacific
Islands) went on the last journey during the
week-end.. For over 50 years the sturdy,
square-built son of Bordeaux had been
general Island representative of a group of
Sydney’s commercial houses. He loved the
Islands, and during the influenza epidemic
he was one of the most active workers in
badly-stricken Tonga, even helping to bury
the dead. One of his daughters, Miss Blanche
d’Alpuget, is a well-known Sydney journalist.
The festive grandfathers—not to mention
grandmothers—of Sydney sighed reminis-
cently when the news came through that
Paris House is to be closed down for good.
It was in its heyday in the naughty ’nineties.
Gaston Lievain was the owner -chef, and his
“chicken casserole” and free wine were cele-
brated all over Australia. These were sup-
plied in half a dozen rooms on the ground
floor, where all was decorum as a rule. But
there are said to have been thrilling parties
in the private rooms upstairs.
Domestics have a pull over their unionised
friends these hard times. They are at liberty
to accept what employers can afford to pay.
You get cases where cooks, who used to
luxuriate on £2 a week and the best of food,
are down to 18s. and the simple viands con-
sumed by the family. The compensation
from the standpoint of these toilers in reduced
circumstances is that, anyhow, they have jobs.
Many unionists who are being helped finan-
cially by them would jump at the chance of
working for much less than the basic wage
if the authorities at the Trades H’all would
let them. Unfortunately for those who were
in domestic service before the slump, their
occupation is being rushed by amateurs. Para-
doxically enough, many of the latter are
sticklers for sky-high wages in their own
(unionised) callings. They realise that
demands for high wages will prevent them
from getting domestic jobs, but they don’t
seem to see that similar demands have cost
them their old jobs.
Lord Kylsant, whose, misfortunes have been
so much in the news of late, has several asso-
ciations with Australia. He bought the
Commonwealth Line, for instance. His
eldest daughter married a son of Viscount
Deerhurst, and that son is now Earl of
Coventry. Lord Deerhurst, who never came
to the earldom ; for he died before his father,
was in Australia years ago, and amusing tales
are still told in resorts like the Melbourne
Club of his doings in the Victorian capital.
He came into fistic conflict at Flemington
with “Bob” Sievier, who afterwards married
into the peerage, founded the “Winning Post”
and went bankrupt, but was then no more
than a humble “silver bookie.” The viscount
retired from the fray with a black eye.
The shutting-off of the trickle of relief
which the Commonwealth Bank has been
allowing to necessitous depositors in the
Government Savings Bank has added to
the city’s gloom. The suspension of
the bank is the worst single blow the
hard-pressed women of the State have
suffered for many a year—since the Great
War broke out, in fact; and they didn’t
realise all at once what that blow meant.
How widespread is the disaster even this
Letter with its terror of figures can half-
realise when it is told that for every 100
people—men, women and children —in N. S.
Wales there were 42 active accounts; that
every third house has a shocked depositor,
and every fourth house has two. The things
that would have happened to Mr. Lang in
fifty thousand homes in Sydney during the
past week, if only woman had her way!
The kindly and genial E. J. Carroll will
never again, at the end of a voyage, put his
head into this Letter’s room to bring word
of London or New York. Last week E.J.
went from Lewisham Hospital on the long,
last journey, leaving not only a widow, two
sons and brother Dan to mourn, but a
little frail slip of a mother, stepping towards
the nineties. E.J. was very proud of his
motlier, and whenever there was a family
jubilation, a new theatre to be opened, a
new star to be launched, the elder Mrs.
Carroll was carefully brought down from
Brisbane to shed her presence on the event.
On these occasions a bouquet fit for a prima
donna would be handed to her, while some
time during the evening the strains of
“Mother Machree” would float out over the
auditorium.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite went up to
the unveiling of the memorial to Henry
Lawson, because she said it is so unique for
Australia to raise a monument to one of
her own men of letters instead of to a poli-
tician. She sat with the faithful, who were
lucky in that they had only the sun in
their eyes while the potentates on the plat-
form had the wind on their backs. It was
a pretty sturdy wind, too, and thrice it
plucked the shroudings from the poet’s
statue before Governor Philip Game had
time to unveil it with' due ritual. Besides
Inky Wayfarers, there was a vast audience
of the unemployed, who several times cor-
dially exhorted his Ex. to “speak up, Phil.”
Of the speakers, Minister for Agriculture
Dunn was most applauded, because he con-
fined his praises to the poet and didn’t, as
some, wander off into praise of the com-
mittee or the memorial itself. Mrs. Lang,
the Premier’s wife, who is a sister of Mrs.
Lawson, was on the platform with the
widow,- son James and daughter Bertha.
Behind this Letter sat one of the most book-
ish of Henry’s old friends. For many minutes
he fidgeted; at last, in the midst of much
talk about the committee, with only an occa-
sional word about Henry, he rose from his
seat, and with a final protesting growl sti'ode
off. No, the function didn’t somehow catch the
right atmo-
sphere. Yet,
shutting its
eyes, this
Letter, which
had so often
listened to
Lawson’s
chuckle as
he climbed
the stairs,
could see
him stand-
ing at the
salute, as
ever straight
as a ramrod,
w o n d ering,
no doubt,
why Lam-
bert bent his
knees and gave him the slouch he never had.
Perhaps it was on the law of Nature that
makes the male the bright-plumaged one of
the species that the original Mason designed
the regalia of the ancient Order. Anyway,
when the brotherhood airs its orders,
the _ feathers of wives and daughters grow
pallid by comparison. One night last week
the Town H'all was splashed with vivid
color when the various orders in full insignia
swept its length, heralding, as it were, the
entry of the Governor and the Grand Master,
Aubrey Halloran. Then there was the presen-
tation of debs. This was a pictorial ceremony,
as the young things advanced to the vice-regal
handshake under alternate arches of roses
and crossed swords. The girls, a flutter of
white draperies and shining heads, were
marshalled by Mrs. P. 0. Marlow, who wore
naiad-green laces, very graceful and flowing
of line. Marjorie Halloran, in her black
velvet dress, stood at her father’s right hand
and took up her new duties with a composure
beyond her years. And a word is due to
the women’s auxiliary, whose preliminary
efforts had wiped out the expenses of the
ball and had been responsible for the miles
of roses and greeny shoots that decorated the
hall.
A church dignitary adds a word on the
mysteries of fashion. “Here,” he said, “there
are three of you this evening, and each one
is dressed in a completely different manner.
And it would be the same if there were
three hundred or three thousand of you—
no two would be precisely the same, and yet
you all conform to the mode. How you do
it without a previous
understanding among
you passes my com-
prehension !” It’s so
different with the
other sex. “So God
created man in His
own image, in the
image of God created
He him” ; wherefore
now, having been
cast in- the same
mould and fashioned
after the same pat-
tern, men are all alike —aren’t they? Especi-
ally when they are clerics!
“Bring your own tucker, and you can have
all the dances you want for five bob,’’ is the
free translation of the script on the tickets
for the Picnic Ball. So on the 21st of this
month, as night settles down, ladies and
gents, carrying a few head of lettuce and a
couple of ripe tomatoes, not to speak of a
catch of fried fish and chips, will be making
their way to the Palais at Moore Park.
Profits go to the Housing fund.
They’ve started. For months past hun-
dreds of men have been picking up the
family knitting and putting a few stitches
in the scarf or the jumper; but it has been
done behind the ramparts which the land-
lord builds. Now the pioneers of public
purl and plain have appeared in the trams
—maybe as a sort of intimation to the world
at large and Mr. Lang in particular that
they can’t afford to buy socks any longer,
OVERHEARD.
Brother : “If you smoke, you don’t come out
with me.”
Sister ( sweetly ): “Do you think you’re weed
enough?”
Bananaland’s bunch of pars:—
There was a big audience at His Majesty’s on
Balokovic’s opening night. Lady Goodwin was
present; Madame Balokovic and Patricia Bell
joined the party in the vice-regal box. In the
morning Madame Balokovic had tea with the More-
ton Club and in the afternoon a party from the
R.Q.Y. Club went aboard the Northern Light. After
the evening’s recital there was a supper party on
the yacht, with the Mayor and Mayoress among the
guests.
Francie Frances, of the wonderful brown eyes and
the delightful soprano, had a recital in the Teachers’
Conference Hall helped by Nancy White, Alice Gill,
Peg Williams and John Thomas, while Arthur Boyle
played the accompaniments on both piano and organ.
Many beautiful flowers were sent up to • the singer,
who wore a lacquer-red mariette gown.
Archbishop Duhig went to the concert given to
Sister Mary Eugenius, the first Queensland nun to
celebrate her golden jubilee, at the Star of the Sea
Convent at Southport. Sister Mary is one of the
few remaining nuns professed by Bishop O’Quinn.
She was one of the well-known Bergin family and
has been at Warwick, Dalby and Stanthorpe.
Pupils of Fairholm College formed a guard of honor
to the bride at the wedding of Donald Pollock to
Beris Rossbrook at St. Stephen’s, Toowoomba. Enid
and Betty Rossbrook and Isabel Pollock ’maided.
The bride was in celanese ivory satin, with a
broidered Brussels net veil. Hydrangea-blue frocked
the bridesmaids. The reception was at Lorell, the
bride’s home.
To help the metropolitan branch of the C.T.A.,
Mrs. A. E. Moore lent her home, Ruhamah, for a
benefit dance. The Premier, Mrs. Moore and Mrs.
Peterson received the guests, Mrs. Moore in cameo-
pink, with a bridge coat of rose and silver brocade;
Mrs. Peterson in black mariette, with a Paisley
, embossed georgette shawl.
These arc busy days at the Show Ground (gradually
we leave off calling our big annual outburst the
Exhibition), and preparations are in hand everywhere
for giving the country a good time when it makes its
spring visit to town. One welcoming scheme is quite
daring in its little way; customers of Q.P.S. (stands
for Queensland Pastoral Supplies, Ltd.) ate carried
from Central Station or Custom House to the ware-
house in any Reel Yellow taxi free of charge. The
Bulletin will hold its usual show at the Exhibi-
tion (as well as in its Adelaide-street offices) ; among
the pictures going north will be some of the new
Norman Lindsay drawings, The Exhibition opens
on August 10.
The ambulance benefit ball was held in McWhir-
ter’s new building, where the Mayor and Lady
Mayoress received the guests. Lady Goodwin won 1
bronze silk muslin, with silver and black brocaded
chenille coat trimmed with grey fox. The Mayoress
was in white mariette with pale pink and white pearl
motifs; the Blair lady wore black lace, with an
amethyst-brocaded coat; Mrs. Hendry Drew chose
black chantilly; Mrs. Lansdowne was in black over
pink; Mrs. Brodribb wore black velvet.

On Saturday our ration of rain, which we
have come to look for daily, did not fall until
night, so it was pleasant at Caulfield. But
it was cold, although the sun shone, and furs
were drawn close and coat-collars. turned up.
A very few women wore spring millinery, but
the felt hat served the needs of most women.
Black cloth tailored suits with white satin
waistcoats or blousettes and a black and
white flower in the coat-lapel were much in
favor, topped by a small felt hat or a toque
of the new shiny black straw. Mrs. Ben
Chaffey chose a black-and-white ensemble, as
did Mrs. T. Y. Millea and Mrs. Percy Black-
bourn. Mrs. Donald Mackinnon and her
daughter Marie were among those who chose
suits of heather tweed. Mrs. Ivan Gutmann,
who was accompanied by Mrs. Slaney, wore
an arresting suit of diagonal-striped cloth in
mole-brown and fawn, with matching felt
hat. Mrs. A. V. Hiskens sported a suit of
sapphire-blue and amber in a check pattern,
with a black hat. June Baillieu, who wore a
dark green tailor-made with a black fur
collar, accompanied Mrs, M. L. Baillieu,
whose coat and skirt were of tweed in grey
and black patterning. Mrs. Mortill’s attire
was all rose-red, and Mrs. Davis, who com-
panioned her, was in tailored apparel of
mastic hue. Others who watched the racing
where Mrs. M. J. Canny, in suit and felt
millinery of cocoa-hue, the D. P. Mackeys,
Mrs. H. S. K. Ward, Mrs. Don Swanson,
Mrs. Alfred Couchman, Mrs. Richard Linton,
Mrs. Murray Heffernan, the Harold New-
bigins, Mrs. lan McDonald and the W.
Pulteney Meins.
The Melbourne Hunt Club’s race-meeting
at Moonee Valley was ruined by the weather.
After the promise of a sunny morning the
temperature at lunch-time was down to 42,
and there was rain, and what looked very
like sleet. The women who were brave
enough to venture forth were wrapped in
fur, tweed or leather to their ears. A. Fisher
won the gold cup for the Hunt Club _ Steeple-
chase for the second time in succession with
his geegee Blue Bar, which was ridden by
S. Brown. A. T. Creswick handed over the
trophy.
Twenty-seven debs, were presented at, the
Old Paradians’ Ball, held at St. Kilda Town
Hall. They carried posies containing blos-
soms reproducing the school’s colors, and
wore long floating white gowns. Mrs. J. A.
Gorman, in dawn-pink chiffon, shepherded'the
buds. Golden-hucd draperies were festooned
from a central group of lights shielded by
shades in pastel tones. Gaily-colored, velvet
jackets were worn by many of the feminine
dancers, the night being freezingly cold.
C. M. S. Power, president of the 0.P.A., was
helped in his duties as host by his sister,
Mrs. E. H’assett, in black satin with an
ermine-collared black velvet wrap. In the
throng were Mrs. P. A. Matthews, in corn-
flower-blue ; Dulcie Hallett, in eau-de-nil
moire; Ena Hallett, in apricot-shot taffetas ;
and Eileen Kenny, in brocaded taffetas of
primrose shade.

Five hundred attended the Royal Automo-
bile Club’s Ball at St. Kilda Plaza. Presi-
dent 11. J. Bean, with Mrs. Bean, who wore
draperies of white lace, greeted the guests,
Among the dancers were Mrs. E. W. Cox, in
amethyst georgette with matching velvet
eoat; Mrs. Edgar Dye, in grey satin; Mayor-
ess Jacka, of St. Kilda, who topped a black
chiffon gown with a black and silver bro-
caded coat; Mrs. George Ramsay, who wore
delphinium-blue georgette; and Mrs. A. G.
Harston, in Venetian-red georgette traced
with gold. The Alured Kellys. H. J. Robert-
sons and F. W. Frickea were there.
To help the Children’s Hospital 400 danced
at Fitzroy Town Hall. Ten debs, in white,
with wristlet posies, made entrance to the
processional march from “Aida,” and having
made obeisance to the president, Mrs. F.
Treleaven, floated into the “Merry Widow”
waltz. Engineers of the hop were Amy
Lucini, in black chiffon with a white fur
coat; and Nancye Mitty, whose flounced
chiffon was patterned in lime and rose
shades and surmounted by a pale green velvet
bolero jacket. Mrs. Treleaven was in black
lace.
Old Fintonians staged their ball at the
Kooyong clubhouse, profits going to Queen
Victoria Hospital. The president of the
association, Miss Hughston, was there in silk
net of burgundy tint, and received a posy; as
did also the head-mistress, Miss McCowan,
and the Misses V. Peters and Ower, of the
teaching staff. The secretaries were Betty
Bellair, in amber-tinted chiffon with coatee of
brown velvet; Bessie McKay, softly clad in
peach-pink georgette; and Peggy Beatty,
whose moire frock was forget-me-not blue.
At the Armytage Scouts’ dance at Dande-
nong eight debutantes, in white and silver,
carrying pink posies, curtsied to the Best
lady, who was in black velvet. Miss Army-
tage lit up a black lace gown with a sparkle
of diamonds. Mrs. Norman Barrett and
Miss C. Dean were ticket secs.
A dance at Ormond Hall to help the
R.V.1.8. was a jolly affair. Mrs. Stewart
Turnbull was there in draperies of black
crepe satin, and Dot Peake, the hon. sec.,
favored garnet-red lace. Mayor Waters, of
Malvern, brought Mrs. Walters, who wore
black lace with georgette.
At the knot-tying of Gwen, elder daughter
of Mrs. T. W. Corrigan, of Caulfield, and
Leonai’d, eldest son of the T. S. Daveys, of
Kew, real orange-blossoms held the bride’s
embroidered tulle veil, which cascaded over
a robe of ivory velvet. Two ’maids attended
in apricot chiffon frocks, made with small
coats; and roses wreathed their hair. There
was a party afterwards at the Australia.
The David Carnegies’ youngest daughter,
Dorothy, who was married recently to N.
Beaumont Welsh, elder son of Mr. and Mrs.
Norman Welsh, of Ringwood. started off on
Saturday with hen husband for a sojourn
in England.
This is Kathle' n Howell, who, with her
pal Jean Robert .on and four others, pro-
poses to start this month on a journey to
Europe by motor-car —or as much by motor-
car as is prac-
tic able and
comfortable.
Thrcj “Riley
N5-i e” cars
v r lil be used,
.and the itin-
erary includes
overland runs
from Mel-
bourne to Dar-
win, Singa-
pore to Pen-
ang, Calcutta
to Delhi,
through the
valley of the
Tigris and
E u p h rates,
Damascus to
A 1 e x a ndria
and Brindisi
to Monte
Carlo, where
t h 0 sextette
will take part in the international motor
rally. Misses Howell and Robertson did
the Darwin trip in 1927, and the journey
to Perth the following year. Accompanying
them on their present expedition will be
Mrs. Charles Coldham. Joan Richmond,
Robert Beaston and Pat Morice.
“Carmen” filled the Royal on Saturday
night, and there was a brave display of
evening frocks in the d.-c., even though
coats could not be shed. In the r.-s. the
bunny coat was an easy winner in popu-
larity, and there were very few other capes
or coats that did not boast a white fur
collar. Madame Orff-Solscher, as Carmen,
made her first entrance in white. blouse,
black velvet bodice and a velvet skirt pat-
terned in a Batik design. Later she wore
cherry-red satin with a vivid blue-flowered
shawl. After that came a cosmos-mauve
frock, and for the last scene her gown was
black and gold and she wore a black lace
mantilla. Tall, slim Phyllis Ferguson, who
played Micaela, looked sweet in pale blue
apparel, her fair hair in long plaits. At
the final curtain there were flowers in
plenty for the feminine principals, and laurel
wreaths for Joseph Hislop and conductor
Bernard Heinze. In the audience were Lieut. -
Governor Irvine and his lady, accompanied
by Captain and Mrs. R. T. A. McDonald,
Mrs. Mann and Major Wilkinson. Bouquets
for the ladies of the party were spread upon
the balustrade. George Tallis’s lady and
daughter Biddy and some Taits occupied
the d.-c. boxes —the orchestra overflowed into
the boxes adjoining the stalls. Other first-
nighters were Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Brookes,
Mrs. E. Stevens, Mrs. Deakin, medical-knight
James Barrett and his lady, Mr. and Mrs.
W. M. Robins, the Russell Gabbs, Miss
Moffatt, Mrs. Merson Cooper, Dr. and Mrs.
J. S. Merrillees, Mrs. W. R. Burston and
Mr. and Mrs. W. Mortill.
In the Proscenium Club’s performance of
Frederick Lonsdale’s comedy “Spring Clean-
ing,” Marguerite Cockerton, who played the
leading role, contrasted a white georgette, a
jade-green necklet and green satin shoes.
Margaret Fay dressed the part of Fay Collen
in the trimmest of black tailored suits and
small hats, an eyeglass and a fantastically-
long cigarette-holder being etceteras. Her
evening frock was chiffon patterned in orange
and amber shades. Dulcie Deed as Mona
sauntered on in dark green velvet suit and
hat, with furs. As Lady Jane Walton,
Dorothy Wise clothed her slim form in black
chiffon with silk petal trimming that hung
in black leaf-like clusters about skirt and
sleeves. Her straw millinery was huge. Alice
Redman sported a crown-like coiffure adorn-
ment of silver lame and black velvet with
her white satin gown.
The newly-formed chamber-music Club,
of which Mrs. W. Mortill is president, staged
its first recital in the lounge of the Victoria.
Thomas Brentnall gave the bantling his
blessing. Quartettes by Arensky and Debussy
were performed by Reginald Bradley, Rene
Bregozzo, Miselia Kogan and Elford Mack,
who were joined by pianist Vassili lister in
a Schumann quintette. Madame Mina Hese-
leva sang songs in Russian.
Judging from the spring hats on view in
shop windows and showrooms, almost any
size, shape or sort of nut-cover will have
a claim to be in the vogue when the warmer
days come. Straw hats may have brims
like sunshades, and felt hats may be turned
up ail I round with a waving feather. Other
felts may cling to the back of the head —
apparently they are to be kept in position
by suction. The early-Victorian felt hat of
low belhtopper shape with turned-up brim,
flower-trimmed, has been seen in the streets
already. White millinery, by all appear-
ances, will be very popular if we have a
real summer; otherwise magpie combinations
are likely to rule the roost.
Members of the Women Graduates Asso-
ciation to the number of 80 met at the
Lyceum Club to pay tribute to a trio of
former presidents, Dr. Effie Stilwell, who
has been in India and is on furlough; Eileen
Fisher, who won the first Fellowship awarded
by the association; and Dr. Ethel McLennan,
who is an associate-professor at the Uni.
The Women’s National Club has wound up
its year with £42 on the right side of its
balance-sheet. At the annual meeting. Mrs.
Claude Couchman, president of the W.N.L.,
who was in the chair, complimented the
patroness, Mrs. William Knox. The Weedon
lady, who is club president, echoed the senti-
ments. Songs by Marion Walker aud Lena
Warland were interludes.
Mrs. Thomas Smith, of Toorak, at whose
residence, Grong Grong, British Music
Society holds its concerts, is on her way
to Europe . with her two young grandchild-
ren to join her daughter, Mrs. Norman
Gadsden, who has been improving her voice
under Madame Dinh Gilly in the south of
France.
Adelaide’s doings:—
There is no slackening of efforts to assist the
unemployed. A loan exhibition of antiques will be
held next month under the patronage of the Governor
to raise funds for the Kuitpo colony. The same
idea was successfully exploited during the war. Last
week saw a button-day appeal for unemployed youth.
Members of Kooyonga Golf Club gladly avail
themselves of the opportunity to entertain there.
Mesdames John Verco and Frank Perry gave a dance
for their sons, Geoff Verco and Spen Perry, and all
the bright young things were present. Mrs. Perry
wore black georgette with a touch of turquoise, and
Mrs. Verco chose a powder-blue moire.
Bridge was enjoyed at the residence of the Wal-
lace Bruces on Wednesday evening, when the brides-
maids-to-be of Mollie Butler, whose wedding to
Neil McEwin takes place on August 14, were the
hostesses. The guests were all girl friends. Floral
decorations were carried out in almond blossom, pink
roses and malacoides. Misses Jean Butler, Gwen
Bruce and Mary Randell entertained, and the bride-
elect looked pretty in pale-pink georgette.
The Sacred Heart College, at Glenelg, gave a well-
attended dance at the Maison de Danse, Glenelg.
Girls of the Loreto Convent held a most successful
dance in Australia Hall, Angas-street. The Scotch
College had its annual ball at Torrens Park.
The Mawson lady was the principal speaker at the
at-home given by the Mayor and Mayoress' (Mr. and
Mrs. A. J. W. Lewis) in the Port Adelaide Town
Hall, in aid of the local branch of the Mothers’ and
Babies’ Health Association. Musical items were
rendered.
An innovation was a florin tea held at the resi-
dence of Mrs. Andrew Smith, Stephen-terrace, Gil-
berton, in aid of the Y.W.C.A. funds, when Miss
Irene Glasson spoke on the work of the association.
The Glenelg Optimists’ Society will hold their
fourth annual ball on Wednesday, August 19, at the
Maison de Danse, Glenelg. It will be a fancy-dress
and poster affair.
The late Tullie Wollaston, dealer in opals and
writer about them, left the three sons and six
daughters he was so proud of —they trooped with
him on the score or so of trips he took to the other
end of the earth. Wollaston was the world’s largest
opal-dealer in the days of White Cliffs, and the most
entertaining. He married a daughter of Charles Man-
thorpe, the Congregational shepherd at Glenelg
(S.A.) for a generation.
Gordon Mackay, formerly Lecturer in Economics
at Adelaide University, and latterly doing research
work in Europe, gets the Professorship in his sub-
ject at the University of Rangoon.
A breeze from the West: —
The Scotch College dance in the Cottesloe Hall
was a joint effort of old boys and present ones. The
attractive Anderson girls were to the fore amongst
the dancers, Flora in sheeny blue satin, Mary in
the green of early spring, and Vance in holly red.
Darrell Harford rustled black taffetas; Joan Church’s
georgettes ran to blue and buttercup; Mrs. Merry
trailed taffetas of crimson hue; frills of blush pink
foamed about Greta Hancock; Miss Fothergill’s frock
was a mist of shell-pink tulle.
Pianists Nora Coalstad and Ariel Seeligson mingled
their gifted fingers at a recital of music for two
pianos. Schumann, Saint-Saens, Rachmaninoff and
Arnold Bax were represented. Turquoise taffetas sewn
to a tulle yoke encased Nora of the classic profile,
and Ariel’s brown locks rippled above pink taffetas
with souffles of tulle upon the skirt. Alice Mallon,
wearing a cream ensemble, lifted her voice in
Italian and German songs. The two Steinway grands
were piled high with flowers and chocs.
Such a lavish welcome did the Katanning Golf
Club shower upon visitors for Country Week that the
pranks of the weather hardly marred the fun. There
were lunches and teas in the clubhouse and whole
trees roared in the wide fireplaces. Mrs. H. Parkes
carried off most of the golf trophies and the Katan-
ning Club retains the Glick Shield for keeps. The
captain, Mrs. Ralph Anderson, who rose hours before
the early kookaburra to make tartlets and pluck
daffodils, the sec., Mrs. Ford, Miss D. Richardson,
and Mrs. Harold Piesse were among those who
extended hospitality.
M.L.C. Old Girls danced in honor of their Alma
Mater on a recent showery night. Miss Walton shed
her patronage in a medley of black laces and chiffons;
honey-gold ring velvets clung to Mary Camm; blue
flowers basked upon Margaret Giles’s pink gown;
blue and pink mingled in Marjorie Smily’s attire;
Jean Robertson flew sunset chiffons; Dr. Dorothea
Parker wrapped her small self in bead-sprinkled ivory
satins; Loma Booth wore misty ninon; blue pre-
dominated in Ruth Wardell-Johnson’s flowered georg-
ettes.
At the llth-16th Battalion hop there was a sprink-
ling of red braid and winking buttons, relics of the
days before the Defence Department was pruned
to a stalk. Among the dancers Mrs. Barr Goyder
kept herself warm with a lame jacket; Nancy Le
Souef’s moonbeam georgettes were a-sparkle with
rhinestones; a dash of green gave a springtime touch
to Mrs. Max Rutter’s white satin; Angie Bunning
wore black; Mrs. R. W. Blair, tangerine; Nancy
Armstrong, flower-trimmed green georgettes; and
Cecelia Brennan, black-spotted net. Mrs. Alan
Stubbs chose ivory taffetas and Mrs. Boyes sherry-
red laces.
A reminder from the Speck:—
Our cathedral is richer for the stained-glass window
erected by his widow to the memory of J. G.
Mitchell. Dean Rivers conducted the dedication
service, and there were many present in whose hearts
the memory of the kindly gentleman will remain
always green.
Work in connection with the forthcoming Antique
and Art Exhibition goes on steadily. Tasmania is
rich in treasures of the sort possessors rarely part
with. Josiah Spode lived in the Speck for over
24 years, and numerous beautiful pieces of china
came with him, to be prized as family heirlooms.
The Old Hobartians burst out into fancy dress at
their annual ball at the Continental. There were
about 500 dancers, and the grand parade was
amusing and colorful. The prize for the most
original turn-out went to Miss Una Taylor, in her
aviator’s dress of silver grey, with wings on the
silver cap. The committee arrived as pirates,
male and female, with Long John Silver in the lead.
Stanley Fuller and J. N. Gee, promising young-
artists, held a show at the Launceston Art Society’s
rooms. Of completely different type and tempera-
ment, their work made an interesting contrast.
Gee’s strength is in his pen arid pencil sketches,
while Fuller excels in his effects of light and shade
and his tree studies.
The only Truby King paid the Speck a short visit
and was given a civic reception by Mayor and Mayor-
ess Soundy at the Town Hall. An attack of laryn-
gitis cramped the visitor’s style; nevertheless he did
his duty manfully, visiting various centres.
Wilfrid Laurier brought his “Man from Toronto”
company from Launceston to the Theatre Koval for
a one-niglit season. In spite of snow, deluges and
gales, the house was well filled.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS.
For Presentation to the Seventy-sixth Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders,
to be held on Thursday, the 6th day of August, 1931.
The Directors have pleasure in submitting their Seventy-sixth Report:—

The company went into occupation of its new building on the Bth April last.
The Directors take this opportunity of expressing their entire satisfaction with the
architects (Messrs. Oakley and Parkes) successful efforts to give us a new home
which is handsome, comfortable and up to date in every detail. The building has
been. much admired by shareholders, beneficiaries and others who have seen it,
and. it is believed that it will be possible to carry on the company’s increasing
business for many years to come without having to add to the accommodation now
being occupied.
II i^ 6 COSt °* t^le kuilding (apart from the land, purchased for £52,500)
will be about £83,000, of which £78,000 has been actually paid to contractors and
architects, leaving only about £5OOO to be provided for.
.During the year of construction it was inevitable there should have been a
considerable loss owing to the money invested not returning income. It is usual
to charge this unavoidable loss to the Building Account. This was considered
undesirable, and therefore the whole year’s loss has been paid out of this year’s
profits. This fact accounts to some extent for the smaller net balance shown.
The year s business has been as good as any previous one, the total value of new
estates being nearly a record. It should be mentioned here that the ever-increasing
taxation is seriously affecting the company’s net profits.
The completed figures relating to the new issue of 30,000 shares are shown in
the Balance-sheet. The whole of this issue was applied and paidt for, and £15,000
has been added to Capital Account, making it £90,000, and the other £15,000 has
been added to the Reserve Fund.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Escape” and “The Perfect Alibi,” at
Sydney Lyceum, are the first talkies shown
here that stress the class distinctions which
still form the basis of English life. In
“Escape” Gerald du Maurier is what the
British of all classes mean when they say a
man is “a gentleman.” He accidentally kills
a policeman, gets five years and escapes in
his prison clothes. The play covers his
experiences up to the time he is captured.
The women without exception are sympa-
thetic, recognising him for what he is the
moment he speaks. The men, barring one of
his own class —a parson—are merciless, but
respectful. Il'e asks an iron-faced farmer,
whose employees have caught him, for a
cigarette. “Give the gentleman a cigarette,”
says the farmer sourly to one of his men.
A great line, in which the whole social fabric
of the nation is illuminated, but it caused
derision in this critic’s neighborhood; as,
indeed, did other revealing lines. The fact is
Sydney cinema audiences have grown so
Americanised that England is beginning to
look like a foreign country to them. Du
Maurier gives a fine performance. However,
it remains to be seen if he will be idolised
by the screen’s world audience as he is by
London theatregoers. He is celebrated for
restraint on the West End stage, but some
of his work in “Escape” is theatrical by
comparison with the smooth naturalism of
the best of the Americans. None of his
colleagues— not even Edna Best —looks like
joining the little band of screen stars who
are equally popular at home and abroad.
It is a great cast all the same, and the
direction, sound and photography are worthy
of it.
A murder is committed towards the begin-
ning of “The Perfect Alibi,” and as the plot
develops it is seen that the alibi was far
from perfect. The production suffers from
too much talk and too little action; the
sequence is interfered with by short shots
several of which are superfluous; and Frank
Lawton is almost as ladylike as Dorothy
Boyd, who helps him to elucidate the crime.
On the other hand C. Aubrey Smith, Ellis
.Jeffries and Robert Loraine are perfectly
cast, and the photographer supplies some
beautifully arranged sets, in which aspects
of country life in England are faithfully por-
trayed. The new Lyceum pictures are a
startling change from recent American ones,
which have shown England as a country
where hounds meet in mid-summer and all
butlers are buffoons.
* # ¥
Old English,” which was commended in
Ihe Bulletin after a pre-view some months
ago, arrived at Sydney Plaza on Saturday.
Arliss doesn t resemble the large, forceful
Englishman Galsworthy drew, but he creates
an equally interesting character—a frail,
cynical old Hebrew, all fire and subtlety,
rhe cast lacks the level brilliancy of several
previous Warner films, and the supreme
moment, which arrives when the star heroic-
ally guzzles himself to death, will come as
a shock to the average talkie-hound. The
atmosphere of the place and period is repro-
duced Avith remarkable art. You can almost
smell the mists of mid-Victorian Liverpool
while watching some of the street scenes.
* * *
at Sydney Regent is
s The Secret Six,” a film biography
AI Capone. Uncle Sam’s variant on The
Man They Could Not Hang is first seen at
work in the slaughter-pens of his home town.
He takes to boot-legging; a few flashes, and
he is making a do of it; a few more, and
he is a plutocrat running his private candi-
date for the mayoralty. The drama of life
under prohibition is strikingly indicated. We
see, to take some examples haphazard, the
workshop of the ballistic expert who identi-
fies bullets after they have been removed
from their billets, a jury in the act of being
squared, Murderers’ Row, and one who
has failed to fix his jury being fitted with
the belt that will attach him to the chair.
The Secret Six are a kind of New Guard.
Their eventual success in cleaning up the
politics of. Centro (Chicago?) seems to be
the only historical inaccuracy in the story.
“Six-Cylinder Love” (Fox), also at the
Regent, has so many stars that the eminent
El Brendel does little more than walk on.
It is a satire on the sort of extravagance
which was boosted by Hollywood before the
slump. . William Collier and his wife are
happy in a middle-aged, suburban way till
a high-pressure salesman forces an expensive
car on them. Rich alcoholists and makers of
whoopee take them up, and tliev are on the
verge of bankruptcy when the salesman
passes the car on to a youthful pair who
enjoy similar social triumphs and become
equally broke. Both families end up in the
same scrubby rooming-house. An amusing
comedy with a reasonable plot is spoiled by
the happy ending which the box-office
interests no doubt demanded of the producer.
It is hard to say which of the 10 comedians
does best. Eddie Everett Horton might get
the verdict on a plebiscite.
* ¥ *
“Dude Ranch,” at Sydney Capitol, is a
cod on a cowboy film. Boarders are leaving
Stuart Erwin’s guest-ranch on account of its
dulness. Jack Oakie, Eugene Pallette and
their womenfolk—bankrupt troupers—blow in
and arrange to supply thrills for food. Pal-
lette, as an over-fed Legree, brutally ill-
uses the anguished mother of Mitzi Green ;
Mitzi, the cleverest youngster in Moviedom,
performs the customary gestures of protest,
and Oakie comes to the rescue in the five-gallon
hat of virtue and valor. The guests are im-
pressed, and then some genuine bad men
turn up and call the actors’ bluff. As much
money must have been lavished on this non-
sense as on any two of the English talkies
mentioned in this column. It lias a couple
of expensive catastrophes as well as a star
cast.
If you like Robert Woolsey you will like
“Everything’s Rosie,” the other Capitol

Rkmmatism
Tired-out with constant pain, limbs like pieces
of lead, back aching, swollen joints, sharp, shooting
pains—thousands know these symptoms too well.
The remedy, we confidently assert, is De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills.
There is no need to describe to sufferers the
pain and crippling agony caused by rheumatism.
Those with swollen joints, twitching muscles, con-
stant aching back, know these symptoms only too
well. What they do not know is that to neglect
rheumatism may quickly lead to serious heart-
weakness. Do you know that the majority of
cases of heart-failure, especially in elderly people,
is due to rheumatic trouble?
KIDNEY TROUBLE IS THE CAUSE OF YOUR
PAIN.
You will never end rheumatism until you
prompt the kidneys to cleanse from the system the
pain-giving, heart-affecting poisons—and this, on
the evidence of thousands, yes, many thousands, of
one-time sufferers restored to health, we say De
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills will do for you.
To every intelligent man or woman we say:
“Do you think that for 40 years De Witt’s Pills
could have been sold the world over for the one
purpose of ending kidney trouble unless this
remedy was successful?”
THIS REMEDY BEARS A
DEFINITE GUARANTEE.
Do you know that every bottle
of De Witt’s Pills sold carries a
definite money-back guarantee?
If, within 24 hours from starting
to take these pills regularly, you
do not see that they are acting
directly through the kidneys, re-
turn partly-used bottle and your
money will be refunded in full, by return.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills are not
a “cure-all.’’ They are made from a prescription
(clearly printed on each box) solely for the pur-
pose of remedying kidney trouble—the cause of
rheumatism, sciatica, lumbago, bladder weakness,
chronic backache and the weakness and loss of
vitality caused by impoverished blood.
De Witt’s Pills have ended chronic pain and
suffering when all else has failed. Men and women
in dreadful pain for years say “De Witt’s’’ ended
that pain and brought them health, strength and
vigor in a marvellously short time. They have
proved an “untold blessing’’ to thousands. Start
to-day, secure a 3/6 box and let it end your weak-
ness, your fear of hidden health dangers.

ACUTE RHEUMATISM ENDED.
Mr. ALBERT HAYSOM,
of Heath Hill, South Gipps-
land, Vic., says: "Whilst I
was on active service I
suffered great pain from
Rheumatism. I was treated
in many hospitals, but it was
not till I tried He Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills
that I had any relief. I have
had no sign of the Rheu-
matism since and am indeed
grateful that my friend
advised me to try He Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills.”

The very latest gift [writes Sappho Smith]
from the engaged girl to her lover is an
embroidered pair of braces with their com-
bined monograms worked in her hair. By-
tlie-bye, gold-washed girls are warned to
leave these offerings alone, as the gilt comes
off the hair even in the working, and if
Adolphus were confronted with a wishy-
washy monogram in mouse-color, instead of
tawny gold, he would suspect aureoline, and
fly to return no more. [26/7/’9o.]
Here is a small story about Spofforth, the
erstwhile demon bowler. Spoil and a friend
were away up country, and a dance was
coming off in the neighborhood. They both
wanted their hair cut, there was no barber,
amateur or professional, anywhere near the
place, and they couldn’t bear to go to the
dance looking like wild men of the woods,
so they hit on a brilliant idea —they pro-
cured a pair of horse-clippers, and agreed
that each was to “clip” the other, a solemn
compact being made that they would not
clip too close. The friend began. operations.
Spoil sat down while the friend ran the
clippers over him, and as the hair fell to
the ground in black tresses the friend winked
softly to himself and cut closer and closer.
AVhen he had finished Spoff’s head was as
smooth as a billiard-ball: his ears stuck out
like fans or the wings of a cherub, his scalp
gleamed in the sunlight as if he had a
tin head. They had no looking-glass, so
Spoff couldn’t see himself, and as he made
no sign that he suspected anything wrong
the friend sat down complacently to be oper-
ated on. Spofforth started on his friend’s
forehead and ran the clippers through his
hair from the forehead to the nape of the
neck, leaving a broad, clear track, while
on each side the hair stood up thick and
wild. The cleared track looked like a Gov-
ernment railway-track survey through thick

.scrub. Then Spoil with a demoniac howl
dropped the clippers, the only pair on the
station, down the well and ran for his life,
with the friend after him. Neither of them
went to the dance, but the. friend was
ashamed to take his hat off in the presence
of ladies until he had got hold of an amateur
barber to clear off the rest of the timber.

How French novelists work! The present
Alexandre Dumas lately stated that he rvrote
his “Affaire Clemenceau,” first a novel, then
a play, 17 times over. Haggard wouldn’t
have got far at that rate. Balzac hammered
every word on the anvil. Zola, Cherbuliez,
Olmet, are all painstaking. “Easy writing
makes d —- hard reading.” Robert Louis
Stevenson wrote “Treasure Island” 12 times
over. [l9/7/’9o.]
An old Irish Judge on the north-western
circuit loved the hunting-field more than he
did the sleepy court-room. His clerk was
like-minded, and a joyous pair they made.
One fine morning the clerk whispered to
the Judge: “Yer honor, old Billy Duane’s
meet’s to-day at Ballykill-
mulligan ; an’ they’ve a fine
dog fox.” “How many names
are on the docket?” asked
the Judge excitedly. “Twinty,
for rioting and braich of
pace, yer Honor.” “Tim,”
said the Judge, “do you
think you can get the first
fellow to plead guilty with-
out a jury trial, and me to
let him off with a week in
gaol?” “The aisiest thing in
the world,” answered the
faithful clerk. “Make haste,
then, and bring the whole
gang; and, I say, Tim, tell
Jerry to saddle the mare
meanwhile.” The twenty
prisoners were brought into
court —a defiant gang—nine-
teen of them prepared to
fight, with counsel and jury,
to the bitter end. The twen-
tieth had been interviewed by
the clerk. He was called.
“Guilty or not guilty of the
crime charged?” demanded
the Judge, with a propitious
smile. “Guilty, yer Honor-;
H'eaven. help me!” said the
crafty prisoner, “Well,” said
the Judge, glancing benevo-
lently about the room, “I
fancy I can let you off with
a week.” Then man thanked
the Judge and stepped down.
There was a terrific sensa-
tion among the other defen-
dants, none of whom ex-
pected to get off with less
than five years in limbo.
Here was a chance to profit
by “his Honor’s” pleasant
mood. One and all mani-
fested an earnest desire to
follow the example of their
comrade and acknowledge
their crimes in a batch. “Do
you all plead guilty?”
demanded the Judge eagerly. “We do!”
shouted the enthusiastic nineteen in chorus.
“Fourteen years’ transportation apiece,”
exclaimed the Judge with a click of the jaw.
“Jerry, is the mare saddled yet?” [27/4/’B9.]
There is in Darlingliurst gaol, doing a
“life” sentence, a man whose crime was

James Liddell Purves, Q.C., once received
a Roland for his Oliver—an event, it may be
stated, of rare occurrence. He was acting as
counsel for a mining company which was
being sued by the representatives of a
deceased miner, whose death, it was alleged,
was occasioned by defective machinery.
The miner was coming up the shaft in the
cage when a beam of wood, part of the upper
structure, fell, struck the man, knocked him
out, and remained in the cage finnly lodged
in his hat. A miner of Boeotian sim-
plicity had given evidence for plaintiffs, and
Purves began to cross-examine on behalf of
the defendant company thus: “What did you
say you saw in the cage when it came to the
top of the shaft?” “I saw a log of wood in
a man’s hat.” To him, Purves: “I suppose
you have looked in the looking-glass with your
hat on?” “Yes,” said the witness. “Well,
that’s not the first time you saw a log of
wood in a hat.” (Laughter, promptly
checked.) “No, sir,” said the witness, “but
I’ve just as often seen one in a wig.” (More
laughter, not so promptly checked.)
[l3/4/’B9.]
Winter has arrived, and the dreary mono-
tony of the city grows drearier and more
monotonous. An aspect of second-hand deso-
lation pervades the air, as if the community
had borrowed someone else’s left-off misery
or had stolen a threadbare wretchedness
which was not lawfully its own. It is at
such a time as this that the human soul is
filled with dreams of rural happiness in some
region where the air is crisp and bracing
instead of dull and stagnant; and man longs
to go out in the woods, and clasp the hog to
his bosom, and commune with his long-lost
brother, the meditative ass, and study the
wild dog that blooms on the dogrose-tree, and
sample the butter from the local butterfly, and
pursue the cold, arrogant goat in the dark-
some haunts where that carnivorous animal
habitually hangs out. H’e experiences a
desire to rise early, and issue forth and get
his feet wet in the dewy grass, and thereby
contract a cold which will make him go to
bed and bark for three weeks, and he has
poetic aspirations which call on him to seek
the loneliness of Nature in the untrodden
wilds, and there fall over the torpid snake,
and the small green bug which stands on the
top of the local vegetable, and the illiterate
goanna and other evidences of a beneficent
Providence. He suffers from a desire to sing in
some locality far removed from all traces
of an effete civilisation, and the chances .are
that he kills somebody with his humble
melody, and that a harmless stranger is
crippled for life by the mere sight of his
hymn-book when he is getting ready to start
the first verse. We shed a hurried tear in
the waste-paper basket at this point, and go
forth to consume an outcast who is grinding
a poem on a hand-organ underneath the
window.
QUIBBLES—IN QUATRAINS.
The world is wide! Its vastness is a curse
To those who’d travel on an empty purse;
But flying from a dun, or angry wife,
You’ll find its narrowness will plague you
worse!
The world is narrow! So the tourist says,
Who boasts of “round the earth in sixty
days,”
How wide it is in sympathy and love
They cannot know who tread these hackneyed
ways.
The world is narrow! But it never mars
His flight, whose soul can soar beyond the
stars.
The world is wide! But, in its free
expanse,
The soulless boor feels bound by prison bars!

The Boatswain of the Roebuck .
J. H. M. ABBOTT
TELLS A STORY OF MUTINY ON DAMPIER’S SHIP.
THE solitary little Roebuck, sailing out of
Sharks Bay on the morning of the
14th of August, 1699, steering a little
west of north on a course more or less
parallel with the coastline, must have been
a sight as strange to the rightful owners of
that part of Australia as her departure was
welcome. For six days she stood along the
coast, navigating dangerously through the
many islands that go to form the group
known ever since as the Dampier Archi-
pelago, until she came close to an island of
which her captain wrote: “There grew here
two or three sorts of shrubs, one just like
rosemary, and therefore I called this Rose-
mary Island.”
But neither on the island nor on the main-
land was any water to be found, and the
anchorage was unsafe; wherefore he con-
sulted with his officers, and “they all agreed
to go from hence.”
So on August the 23rd they ran to the
nor’-eastward, and from the 26th to the
30th were out of sight of the coast, until,
according to Dampier’s observations, in the
latitude of 18° 21 1 S. they again made the
land, and came to an anchor in what has
since been known as Roebuck Bay, where
the town of Broome is now. And this was
the last of Australia with which Will Dam-
pier had anything to do.
The little ship which made this long
voyage two hundred and thirty years ago
was not more than about ninety feet in
length by twenty-four in beam, and her
draught when loaded was somewhere about
twelve feet. She was ship-rigged, had one
deck, with a poop and forecastle at either
end of it, and carried twelve guns—probably
about six-pounders. But she was ancient and
rotten, sailed crankily, and died of old age
before she got home.
It was a custom of Captain Dampier’s,
when the Roebuck was approaching an
anchorage, to cause the boatswain to take
the wheel. The master he would send aloft,
and another officer into the bows, and, stand-
ing by the boatswain, would himself bring
the ship to her moorings.
“I like to have a man whom I know of
old at the wheel, Dick,” he said to the
helmsman. “These navy men have ways
and terms of seamanship to which I am not
used. Besides, it doth give me better heart
to see thine honest face overlooking the com-
pass. It mindeth me of happier voyages,
when I would do a trick at the wheel my-
self, and care as little for my Lords of the
Admiralty as our old friends Bartholomew
Sharp or Nat Sawkins did care for the
Lords of Hell.”
He was a little melancholy this afternoon,
as he paced back and forward across the
quarter-deck before the carved and varnished
front of the poop, his spy-glass beneath, his
arm, and a copy of Abel Tasman’s chart of
the coast pinned down upon a little table
outside the cabin door, which from time to
time he consulted, measuring distances with
a pair of compasses that lay conveniently
upon it.
A couple of miles away on the starboard
side, drawing in closer as they headed for
the wide bay whose opening faced the south-
west, stretched the dreary coastline, a low
shore of scrubby sandhills backed by what
appeared to be a wide plain. Long stretches
of mangroves fringed parts of the curving
strand, and it was as unpromising and deso-
late as all they had seen since making the
land below Sharks Bay.
“ ’Tis a poor prospect, Dick,” he grumbled
in a low tone, so that only the boatswain
heard him. “The barrenest part of the
globe, it seemeth to me, is this coast of New
Holland. But it cannot all be like this.
In so vast >a territory as I believe it to be,
there must be some portion that is fit to be
the dwelling-place of better sorts of people
than the poor creatures that do inhabit
hereabout.”
“Dost think so, then, Cap’n?” grunted the
boatswain, his hands gripping the wheel, and
his attitude one of alertness for orders that
might be sudden.
“Of a verity. Just bethink you, Dick
Corbin. Here we be a-sailing a little north
of the tropic of Capricorn, in latitudes the
same as those wherein are situated the rich
lands of the Brazils, and some of the finest
parts of Africa, scarce ten degrees north of
the Cape of Good Hope. Some portions
must be of a likeness to those lands in
Africa and the Spanish Main which lie
about this latitude. ’Tis here a good climate
—would we enjoy such weather as this at
home in February?”
“The harshest month o’ th’ year in all
Britain be th’ month o’ Febrooary.”
“ ’Twas but little past mid-summer,” went
on the captain, “when I visited this coast
aforetime, in the Cygnet; and though the
weather was passing hot ’twas not a heat
that a man might not endure whilst at
labor in it. ’Tis my belief, should we find
water soon, and be enabled to voyage to the
eastward, that we shall come ere long to the
coast of a country that is as good as any
in the known world. Such it was they sent
me forth to find, and such, I still believe,
will reward our hard quest of it.”
“Dost think a passage lieth to the east-
'ard, Cap’n?” asked Mr. Corbin, with deep
interest.
“Aye,-that I do. Mayhap there is a pas-
sage between New Holland and New Guinea
into the great South' Sea. eastward. That
shall 1 try to find—if by God’s blessing we
meet with good fortune in our searclf for
water in this part of the land we are
approaching.”
“Indeed, Cap’n, unless we soon find water
we are like to perish. As ye well know, all
that lieth in the casks is rotten and stink-
ing. And the men are whispering among
themselves, and are ill-disposed toward y’r
honor for hugging this dry shore. I like
not their murmurings. ’Tis a King’s ship
—bat the King’s men be only the common
clay God shapeth day by day. wi’dry tongues
to moisten and hungry bellies to fill. Tom
Pearce, th’ cap’n o’ the fore-top—the scurvy
hath him badly. And others also, who do
daily grow worse. ’Twill not be many days
until our state may be a parlous one, Cap’n,
unless we find water and means of refresh-
E' v nt b n re j when we come to an anchor.”
Captain Dampier gazed through his spy-
glass at the land, and groaned a little, as he
swept its field of vision along the arid shore.
“ ’Tis not promising, Dick, and that's the
God’s own truth about it! I pray that we
may find water. If not” —he made a gesture
of disgust and despair. “But we are com-
ing nigh the land. I’ll take the helm, Dick,
and do you go for’ard with the lead-line.
I’ll stand in as close as may be safe, hoping
that we’ll but have to float our water-casks
only a short way from the shore. I vow I'd
float ’em five mile, cheerfully, if I could but
be sure of finding water, though.”
It was an ill-rewarded quest when they
landed as early as possible on the following
morning. Well armed—for fear of the
natives, whose “smoaks” they had perceived
near the shore —and carrying picks and
shovels for the sinking of wells, Dampier
and a dozen of his crew disembarked from
a boat on the beach, and began to prospect
for the water that meant the success or
failure of the voyage. None knew so well
as he how their good or ill luck in finding
it was to determine the future of this new
land. Had Will Dampier discovered a spring
at Roebuck Bay on that last day of August
in 1699 the story of British Australasia
might have begun nearly a century sooner
than it did. But the luck was bad. Nine
feet deep they dug, and the earth was still
as dry as at the surface. Nevertheless, he
did not give up hope at once.
In the afternoon he landed again and
separated from the main body of his men,
taking with him only the boatswain and a
young seaman named Alexander Beale, a
Cormshman. He hoped that the smallness of
his party might entice the natives to come
to close quarters, and that by capturing one
of them he might find out where they
obtained their drinking water.
Will Dampier—who was one of the best,
journalists of his day, or, for the matter of
that, of any other—tells the story of his
adventures that afternoon so graphically in
his account of the voyage of the Roebuck
that he might well be permitted to relate
it here: —
There were 10 or 12 of the Natives a little way
off, who seeing us three going away from the rest
of our Men, followed us at a distance. I thought
they would follow us: But there being for a while a
Sand-bank between us and them, that they could
not then see us, we made a halt, and hid ourselves in
a bending of the Sand-bank. They knew we must
be thereabouts, and being 3 or 4 times our Number,
thought to seize us. So they dispers’d themselves,
some going to the Sea-shore, and others beating
about the Sand-hills. We knew by what Rencounter
we had had with them in the Morning that we could
easily out-run them. So a nimble young Man that
was with me, seeing some of them near, ran towards
them; and they for some time, ran away before
him. But he soon over-taking them, they faced
about and fought him. He had a Cutlass, and they
had wooden .Lances; with which, being many of
them, they were too hard for him. When he first
ran towards them I chas’d two more that were by
the Shore: But fearing how it might be with my
young Man, I turn’d back quickly, and went up tc
the top of a Sand-hill, whence I saw him near me,
closely engag’d with them.
Upon their seeing me, one of them threw a Lance
at me, that narrowly mis’d me. I discharg’d my
Gun, but avoided shooting any of them; till find-
ing the young Man in great danger from them, and
myself in some; and that tho’ the Gun had a little
frighted them at first, yet they had soon learnt to
despise it, tossing up their Hands and crying Pooh,
Pooh, Pooh; and coming on afresh with a great
Noise, I thought it high time to charge again, and
shoot one of them, which I did. The rest, seeing
him fall, made a stand again; and my young Man
took the Opportunity to disengage himself, and come
off to me; my other Man also was with me, who
had done nothing all this while, having come out
unarm’d; and 1 return’d back with my Men, design-
ing to attempt the Natives no farther, being very-
sorry for what had happened already.
They took up their wounded Companion; and my
young Man, who had been struck through the Cheek
by one of their Lances, was afraid it had been
poison’d: But I did not think that likely. His
Wound was very painful to him, being made with a
blunt Weapon. But he soon recover’d of it.
In the evening after supper, which had
lately, owing to the short commons existing
in the ship, never been a very festive occa-
sion, either in the Great Cabin aft or in the
crew’s quarters in the forecastle, Captain
Dampier sent for the boatswain.
Mr. Corbin found his commander pacing
the deck in his dimly-lit Great Cabin, a
prey to sorrowful and gloomy thoughts -which
wrote themselves in the expression of his
face. A pair of lighted candles stood upon
the round table, and on the seat of a tail
chair beside it a couple of pistols rested on
his boat-cloak, with his hat hanging on the
knob of one of its corners.
“Sit ye down, Dick”—Dampier motioned
the boatswain to a chair, and seated himself
at the table. “I have some further work
for you this night—another trip ashore.”
“Ashore—to-night, sir !” Dick Corbin could
not conceal his astonishment. “Hast a design
of further searching for water, Cap’n.”
“Nay, my good Dick, ’tis quite hopeless
to look for it on this coast, I am convinced.
These Indians —I much doubt whether they
drink at all. Mayhap they subsist upon
such moisture as the dews afford them.
However that may be, my mind is made up.
There is nothing for it but to recognise,
with whatever grace we may, that the hand
of God is against us, and to make some
effort to save our lives at least, despite that
our expedition must come to naught. How
much water is there in the casks, Dick?”
“We ha’ no more than six full casks,
Cap'n, beside a part of one was ope’d to-day.”
“So bad as that, eh ! The ship’s company
—all of us—must go upon an allowance.”
“There be about twelve barrels o’ beer
left, sir, but ’tis poor, sour stuff. More
like pig-swill than good honest English ale.
There be sad rogues i’ Deptford Yard. These
casks are branded with King Charles’s mark,
and must lia’ been in th’ stores o’ th’
Victualling Yard a score of years at least.”
“I fear me there may come a time when
we shall be glad to drink it,” commented
Dampier gloomily, “unless w r e save ourselves
as quickly as may be from the fate that
threatens. To-morrow we must up anchor
and bear away for Timor. ’Tis the nearest
place where we may look for succors.”
“At what o’clock, Cap’n?”
“In the forenodn. at whatever time we
may be ready. From to-morrow morning

each man’s- water - for- the- day-must-be re-
duced to a pint. We may have the good
fortune to fall in with some island where
our casks may be replenished; but we must
not count on that or risk too much. Let them
have of the beer two pints—if they will
drink it. ’Tis my experience that ale must
be exceeding bad when English seamen can
find no use for it.”
“And concerning this visit to the shore
to-night, sir?” .
“I wish you to go with me now. I pur-
pose leaving a record of our coming here
buried in the soil, so that there may remain
some proof of our having taken possession
of this land on their Majesties’ behalf. Dost
see this little iron chest, good Dick Corbin?
Tis one I had specially made in London
for such a purpose as this, though God
knoweth I had hoped to leave it in some
better place—a place that might rival one
day even the plantation in Virginia for
richness arid prosperity. Within it are
1 tapers and directions, to whomsoever may
find it, as to how, in my opinion, the good
parts of this country may be come at. To-
day 1 marked a great rock, hard by our
landing-place, which will serve as a guide
to the spot where we decide to bury it. Go
and get thy pistols, Dick, and a spade and
a pickaxe, and we will row ashore in the
skiff and plant our record. Call to me
when you are ready, and in the meantime I
will secure the case.”
The night was very cold and clear, and
not a breath of air stirred the surface of
the bay, in which the stars mirrored them-
selves in brilliant pinpoints of silver. Dick
Corbin pulled a pair of oars, swishing
phosphorescent eddies into a short-lived
wake, and Captain Dampier sat aft at the
tiller, holding the casket, which he had en-
closed in an oaken outer shell, upon his
knees. Behind him, a single point of yellow
light against the deep dark velvet curtain
of the star-spangled heavens gleamed in the
mizzen-rigging of the Roebuck. The rhythmic
splashing of a little surf on the beach they
approached was the only sound breaking in
upon a stillness and loneliness that almost
might be felt. It was close to midnight
now, and none but the anchor watch re-
mained awake aboard the ship. On . shore
was no sign of life of any kind, and the
low, dark, irregular outline of the land sug-
gested the emptiness and desolation of a
place that had never been peopled and never
could be peopled.
As they drew into the beach, the boats-
wain ceased to row, and leaned over the
handles of his oars. He cleared his throat a
little nervously, and addressed Captain
Dampier.
“Let us rest here a minute, Cap’n. I’ve
zummat for to say to ’ee that must be said.”
Dampier stared at the broad, squat figure
of his old shipmate—long ago, they had been
pirates together—as he loomed in the dim
starlight athwart the skiff amidships, and
could just make out the grave expression of
his rugged features.
“Well, then, Dick, what is it? Be brief.
The day’s doings have fatigued me, and I
would accomplish our present task and seek
my bed. Come, what’s the matter?”
“This be th’ matter, Cap’n—and ’tis matter
enough, I’ll warrant ye. There’s mutiny
aboard —stark murd’ring mutiny!”
Captain Dampier laughed bitterly.
“There’s been naught else in the ship
since we cleared the Channel, Dick. That’s
nothing new. That pestilent fellow Fisher,
our late first lieutenant, discontented every-
one with his grumbling and his hatred of
my authority. He had no room for old
buccaneers—as he was good enough to tell
me the time I knocked him down on the
quarter-deck. Mutiny ! God save us, they’ve
been in a state of mutiny the whole voyage.
But what’s the news? Is there some other
kind of trouble, different from that to which
we have become accustomed?”
“Listen, Cap’n. To-night I went to the
fo’c’s’le-head to smoke a pipe after supper,
and presently there came three seamen out
of the fo’c’s’le who busied themselves a-fishing
—or pretending to fish. What they were
really a-doing was hatching a plot. As soon
as I became aware of what they were talking
about, I dropped me down upon the deck
by the butt of the bowsprit, and lay quiet.
One of ’em was young Beale, the fellow
whom the Indians wounded this afternoon,
with his jaw bound up as your honor bound
it for him. Damme, had you cut his throat
’twould have been better! A malcontent
young rogue the fellow is, and if you gave
me the word I’d pistol him and feed him to
the sharks —that’s how I feel about him.
Pity we did not leave him to the Indians.”
“Young Alec Beale! Save us, my good
Dick —as smart a lad as we’ve got in the
Roebuck. Why, what’s amiss with him?”
“There’s this amiss, Cap’n—that to-night
I heard him say ’twould be the best could
happen to the ship’s company were you
marooned upon one of those islets we passed
by lately. Or that, if you were left here,
none of us would be the worse of it. He
swore you tried to have him slain by the
Indians, and only rescued him when ’twas
nigh too late. Foul names he called y’r
honor, too. A renegado. A blasted West
Country villain. An unrepentant thief. Aye
—and more than that. A homeless vagabone
with neither kith nor kin, who’d as lief
desert his crew in an extremity as eat his
breakfast. But words—what do they matter?
’Tis what they’ve conspired for to do that
matters.”
“Well, what did they plot to do?”
“They spoke together of taking the ship
in the early hours of to-morrow morning, just
after dawn, when the light should have be-
come strong enough to let them see what
they were about. You were to be landed,
here in this bay, quite alone. Those who
would not join them were to be cast over-
board. AVere to be! Are to be is what
I should say. They spoke as though the
matter was to be carried out according to
long-standing arrangement.”
“And think you that the whole ship’s
company is privy to this plot, Dick Corbin?”
“Nay". Cap’n, not by a dozen or so, so far
as I could gather. But it seems that they
take little fear for them. So soon as yon
have been made a prisoner, they expect all
hands to join them, and that none will be
found unwilling that you should be put
ashore.”
“And what will they do then? Whither do
they design to take the ship?”
“To the Dutch islands in the north, Cap’n.
There will they disband themselves, and
each man seek his own way homeward. But,
to tell the truth, they seemed but uncertain
concerning their future movements. The
main thing, it would seem, is to get rid of
you, Cap’n Dampier. Everything, they seem
to hope, will go well then. I but speak of
what I heard them say.”
“And yourself, old pirate?”
“Cap’n, where you go, I go. Tf they land
you. 1 will, join you. ashore.. JWe’y.e. been
comrades and friends too long for aught
else, Will Dampier.”
“Thank you, Dick —I might have known
as much,” said Captain Dampier simply.
“Put about, Dick. We’ll go aboard again.
I’ll find some other spot in which to leave
this record. I have no desire to be left as
a living memorial of our visit. So we will
see what we can do.”
As they came close to the ship, she lay
on the dark waters so silent and lonely
that she might have been deserted- Her tall
spars towered against the star-lit heavens,
and the riding-light in the mizzen-rigging had
gone out. From somewhere about the break
of the forecastle sounded a snore, regular
and deep, that might almost have made an
echo from the shore.
"Hark ye. Dick —the d —d lubbers !” mut-
tered Dampier to his companion as the
little boat drifted under the ship’s counter.
“The whole watch sleepeth, and anything
might befall the ship for all they care. Here
is the Jacob’s-ladder. Let us go for’ard
and see what they’re about.”
They climbed aboard and stole silently to-
wards the bows, the captain a little in
advance. Everything was very quiet—only
that terrific snore trumpeting beneath the
stars broke the midnight silence, and the
occasional splash of some leaping fish out in
the dark bosom of the placid bay.
Captain Dampier, treading gently, had
advanced a coqple of yards beyond the butt
of the mainmast, when a sudden warning
yell very close behind him caused him to
jump forward and to spin round with arm
uplifted to protect himself from whatever
danger threatened.
“Mind ye, Cap'n—mind ye!” had been
shouted from, somewhere behind the mast.
When he had turned, it was to see dimly
two wrestling figures grappling together and
swaying across the deck. One of them
seemed to have his face muffled up in white
cloths. The other, from its squat and sturdy
shape, he recognised as the boatswain’s. He
called as he ran towards the swaying figures.
“What is it, Dick—what’s the matter?”
Just as he reached them, they crashed
to the deck, and one of their heads—it was
too dark to make out which —struck the
planking with a crash that made him shiver.
For a moment or two they lay still; then one
of them scrambled to an upright posture
and immediately stooped over the prostrate
figure at his feet. Dampier recognised with
astonishment that it was the young man,
Alexander Beale, who had been wounded
in the encounter with the natives.
“In the name of God.” he cried in a low
voice, “what’s all this? What have you
done to the bos’n?”
“Hist, Cap’n,” half-whispered the man in
the bandages. “ ’Tis mutiny! Help me
carry him to the Great Cabin. Quickly, y’r
honor, ere the others be awakened. They’rn
all below. There’s no one on deck, besides
ourselves, but Tom Allen a-keepin’ the
anchor-watch ; and he’s a-lyin’ drunk on the
fo’c’s’le. Hark to him!” \
The mighty snore still trumpeted from the
region of the bows.
Completely mystified, but. deeming the
privacy of the cabin preferable to the open
deck, whilst he should investigate these
strange events and conflicting rumors of
mutiny, Dampier lifted the boatswain’s heels
and they carried him aft. Presently he lay,
stunned and unconscious, on the deck in
the Great Cabin under the high poop.
“Jtj! man/* said DapaPiqr. ‘‘it. hath, come
to me" by hearsay that you are a malcontent
who doth desire to maroon me, your captain, in
this bleak, inhospitable place. What say you :
The dark eyes of the young man, peering
through his bandages, were all that Dampier
could see of his face. But even from them
he was able to judge that the seaman was
astounded at this accusation.
“God in Heaven!” he exclaimed. "What
dost thou say, Cap’n? Me! The land
deliver us, and ’twas me but just saved ye
from the leader of the mutineers, when he'd
taken a belaying-piu from th’ mast and was
about to knock your brains out. ’Twas
murder, not marooning, was meant by Hide
Corbin. And as for me—why, only myself
and half a dozen more stood out against th’
bos’n and his wickedness. Sir, you’ve been
bewitched! Some evil eye hath put a spell
upon ye—surely!”
Dampier stared at the young man. Hardly
was it to be believed; but there was a ring
of truth in the lad’s tone.
“Speak quickly, Beale —hast any proof of
this?” ,
For answer, the young man searched his
pockets and presently found a crumpled
piece of paper, which he opened and handed
to the captain.
“Read that, y’r honor,” he said eagerly.
“ ’Tis a list of those whom this man hath
corrupted to his plans. He dropped it in
the fo’c’s’le a day ago, and I picked it up.
’Tis all as plain as print.” He pointed to
the unconscious boatswain on the deck.
“There’s the mutineer, sir. And but for
that you did save my life from_ them Indians
jester afternoon, I’d ha’ been with them, too.
Dampier studied the paper closely.
“ ‘Ye names and stations of those who
would help to take ye ship,’ ” he read. “And
here are the names of twenty-five men.
Beale —tell me—why have you betrayed your
comrades? Your name heads this list. Are
you treacherous to them, as well as to me?”
The young man made an eloquent gesture
and went down on one knee.
“Forgive me, Cap’n,” lie mumbled through
his bandages, “that I did ever doubt ye. I
knew not the sort of man ye was. But
when you did not desart me yesterday—how
could I betray you?”
“Are you faithful now?”
“By God’s body, I be, sir!”
Dampier thought for a little while. Pre-
sently he spoke.
“Well, then, my man, go get ye some
lashings. We’ll tie this fellow up and take
him ashore. But why is the ship so quiet?
One would suppose the people to be dead."
“Cap’n. they be drunk —stupefied. Th'
bos’n broke into the spirit store and gave
them brandy—the which, I think, he must
have drugged. When they came to. you'd
have been ashore and he’d have had his way
with them and sailed away. That was his
plan. Cap’n Dampier.”
“Will you row him ashore and leave him
on the beach —if I help to put him in the
skiff? Are you faithful to me now, Beale?”
“Aye, sir, I be. I owe you my life.”
“So be it then. Pie’ll stop here—as he
did intend for me to do. Lord, but I never
thought I’d be betrayed by one of the old
pirate hands!” he murmured mournfully.
“Not even the best men can be trusted. Get
some lashings, then—and we’ll tie him up.
You may become King of New Holland, good
Master Bos’n: . I’ll willingly yield ye my
crown and sceptre. But Dick Corbin, of ail
men!”
