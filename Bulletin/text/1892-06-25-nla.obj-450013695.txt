Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to ihe study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN

He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest;
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-

combined with unswerving faithfulness to hli
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARE UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP

GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OF DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM.
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
THE BOOK WILL ALSO
HOW TO CUBE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonparell
Illustrated Newspaper,
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Comnlete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Auswaiia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
ar.d has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once bo seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to tlio fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception;
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maonland
Ranges. A.paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

The Cause of Depression.
It has been represented to the Government that many
men at present without work are willing to take employ-
ment at such reasonable wages as may be offered. The
Government have reason to believe that many persons
would be willing to give employment to labourers at
rates below those usually paid at present, if they could
obtain labourers at such rates. The Government will,
therefore, be glad if any persons willing to give such em-
ployment will communicate with the officer in charge of
the Government Labour Bureau, stating the number of
men they are willing to employ, and the wages which they
are willing to pay. The Government confidently invite
this assistance from private citizens for the purpose of
dealing with the present difficulty. —Circular issued by
the Kanakiloriff Government of Queensland.
The working classes must be prepared to accept a lower
rate of wages before employment can be found. When-
ever this is done there will be no more unemployed.—
Speech by Sir Thomas MTlwkaitii in the Queensland
Assembly.
An impossible rate of wages has been fixed, whereas, if
n proper rate had been established, there would have been
no unemployed.— Speech by B. D. Morehead in the
Queensland Assembly.
A few days ago the Queensland Legislature
set itself to solemnly consider the problem
of the unemployed, and-except for the
dissent of a very few members of very
small monetary importance—it was unani-
mous in its decision. The cause of the
difficulty, so it decided, is the exorbitant
wages demanded by the working-classes of
the province. If they hadn’t exacted these
exorbitant wages in the past, there would
never have been any unemployed ; if
they will promise not to want them for
the future, there will never bo any
unemployed again. A thirst after high
wages is the origin of poverty, hunger, want
of work, and all the other social ills of the
day—therefore, it follows that in countries
where wages are low there is prosperity,
happiness, and general contentment, and in
countries where they are high there is woe,
misery, and general starvation. And from
this it further follows that a rise of wages is
the short road to wretchedness, while a re-
duction is the trunk-line to happiness, peace,
and tranquil contentment, and as one re-
duction of wages brings general prosperity it
may bo reasonably inferred that another
reduction will bring more prosperity, and by
the time wages are reduced to nothing at all,
the millennium will have arrived and Queens-
land will be a Paradise. Also, it is unani-
mously x’esolted by the Legislature at This-
bane that high wages are the only cause of
the prevailing depression, and that high
rents, high interest, inflated land values,
and about the biggest debt (per head) on
earth, incurred chiefly to build political rail-
ways for crooked politicians, have nothing
whatever to do with the trouble. From
which resolutions it may be fairly assumed
that the Queensland Legislature is either a
harmful lun di?, or else that it is the most
utterly mendacious political organisation by
which Australia is at present afflicted.
# # *
The assumption that wages must come
down whenever a period of scarcity arrives,
is one which has been accepted so long that
the world has almost ceased to question it.
Tn times of poverty wages are the first thing
that comes down ; in times of plenty they
are the last thing that goes up. They come
down fast and they go up again very slowly
—moreover, they come clown further, in the
one instance, than anything else, and in the
other they do not rise in anything like the
same proportion. Rent, interest, and wages
are the three great charges which absorb the
produce of the earth, and of these rent keeps
going up for ever and ever : while interest
remains about stationary, when an average
is struck all over the civilised globe, or else
exhibits a slight tendency downwards. Rent
and intei’est are the two first charges upon
production, and when they are satisfied the
balance, whatever it may be, goes in wages.
When times are good rent increases with
enormous rapidity ; it rises a hundred per
cent, while wages only rise twenty, and then
there is a bitter wail concerning the exoi’bi-
taut exactions of Labour, and the way in
which agitators and trades-unions are incit-
ing the masses to be a clog and a burden
upon the national industry. When times
are bad rent keeps on increasing, only more
slowly, and wages go down heavily, and then
a melancholy lamentation goes abroad to the
effect that the selfish and ignorant toiler has
extinguished the prosperity of the country
by his greed, and that it is necessary to take
steps to resist him. And when depres-
sion becomes utter stagnation, os is the
case at present with Queensland, rents
still go up, oidy more slowly yet, and
wages fall to the very lowest point at which
the worker can eke out a subsistence, and
callous speculators of the Griffith or M‘ll-
wraith type point out (while passing Bills
to flood the country with cheap niggers and
thus increase the fortunes of those who have
grabbed the rich sugar-lands) that the absurd
and outrageous demands of the working-
classes are the cause of the whole trouble.
There never was a period, however ruinous,
in the history of any Australian province,
when rents in the aggregate were not going
up, and as they keep on rising the margin
left for wages becomes, in each succeeding
period of depression, more and more pre-
carious.
# # #
It is a recognised axiom that as population
increases wages diminish. The human race,
in a dull, patient, lymphatic way, mostly
accepts the thing that is as the thing that
must be, and it therefore assumes that the
increase of population is itself the cause of
this decline. But in reality the increase of
population merely affords opportunity for
the increase of rent, and the unnatural
expansion of rent diminishes the amount
that is available for wages. There is no
sense or logic in the matter, save the logic
of hard, brutal swindling. The man who
inherited from his great-grandfather a scrap
of waste land which, without any effort on
his part, has now become the centre of a
great city, claims to receive in rent about
five hundred times as much as his ancestor
received, and his claim is allowed. The
man whose great-grandfather made shoes
for a certain weekly wage in a humpy on
that same piece of land in the early days is
at least equally entitled to receive live hun-
dred times as much for making shoes in the
same place, but his claim would be regarded
as an evidence of insanity. Yet, when care-
fully analysed, his case is much the better of
the two. It is population which creates
the value of land; if land could increase
in value without population then allotments
at the bottom of the Pacific would be as
valuable as those in Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. When a certain aggregation of
men, by their presence, have given value to
the land then they are charged an enormous
rent for having done so, and through this
rent wages diminish. If the increase of
wealth were evenly divided between wages
and rent, interest remaining stationary, then
rents would still have risen in Queensland,
and wages would be at least four times
greater than they were 30 or 40 years ago.
As it is, interest has fallen, wages have fallen
to a point that is closely akin to starvation,
and while the wealth of the country has
increased by, at least, £lOO per head during
the past generation, rent has swallowed
it all—and more. And even at this point
the Queensland landholders and land-
boomers are not satisfied, and therefore the
Government suggests, as a work of Inmccol-
ence, that employment should be found for
the poor at still lower wages than those now
prevailing !
# # *
This means inevitably an all-round reduc-
tion which will gradually affect every branch
of industry. Wages are always levelling down
the only thing that is always levelling up is
rent. When one employer hires, through
the Government labour-bureau, a number of
broken-spirited scrag-ends of humanity at
half-wages, every other employer must either
reduce his employes to the same level or else
discharge them and hire a similar squadron
of cheap “unemployed” to take their
places. If he does not he will be undersold
and gradually ruined, for the employer, as
well as the employed, suffers from the cease-
less upward movement of rents —except in
the comparatively few instances when he is
himself a landlord, and his profits mostly
come under the head of interest which is a
declining quantity. And when wages have
been subjected to a further aggregate reduc-
tion of perhaps 25 per cent, the depression,
as Sir Samuel Griffith prophesies, will
begin to fade away, and a boom will arise in
the sultry North. There will be a greater
demand for land ; sales will be more
frequent; better prices will be realised ;
dead estates with which all manner of grasp-
ing companies and syndicates have been ham-
pered for years will begin to be live assets
once more ; and rents will go up. Just now
the triple demands of rent, interest and
wages amount to more than the province
produces ; if a large percentage is taken off
wages it will probably leave a balance to the
good and rents will cheerfully rise and
absorb that balance. When rents rise fast it
is called prosperity. Possibly wages, having
previously gone down 25 per cent, in the
days of stagnation, will go up 10 per cent, in
the period of inflation, and this will be
alluded to as the grasping selfishness of the
working classes. And when the next period
of poverty arrives that 10 per cent, rise will
be set down as the cause of the renewed
trouble, and another scheme of general re-
duction will be announced. But there will
be no general reduction in rent; it will keep
rising as before.
# * *
The statements issued by MTlwkaith and
Morehead, to the effect that when wages
are reduced there will be no more “ unem-
ployed,” is so glaring a perversion that it
would be an insult to their intelligence to
suppose that they themselves believed it
true. If that theory is sound, then there are
no unemployed in London, where thousands
of workmen can be procured at the exceed-
ingly low rate of 15s. or so per week, and
where working women can be obtained in
still greater numbers for half that amount —
there is no submerged tenth—no “General”
Booth —no great colonisation scheme to get
rid of those millions whose wages have been
reduced over and over again, and who And
employment scarcer with each reduction.
Also, there is no Italian immigration pro-
blem, for the Italian, whose wages have been
reduced even lower than those of the
Englishman, has necessarily abundance of
work at home, and doesn’t want to be a
cheap blackleg in Queensland ; and there is
no Chinese difficulty, for the Chinaman’s
wages are down lower than those of the
Italian, and he has so much employment
and so much tranquil happiness in his
own flowery land that he can’t desire
to come to Australia at all. But the
reality, as everybody knows, is that the
reduction of wages only makes competition
keener, and the battle of life harder, and the
army of the unemployed more and more
numerous. Moreover, the assertion that but
for the exorbitant demands of Labour there
would be no superfluous poor in Queensland
reads like a blushless lie when uttered by
the same politicians who deliberately im-
ported these same poor—who brought
in paupers by thousands and tens of thou-
sands, and who are bringing in more and
still more paupers to this day, despite the
alleged stoppage of the immigration policy.
But even the batch of houseless wretches who
were imported with the public money and
dumped on the hungry shores of Queensland
a week or two ago will do something for the
province. Some of them, most likely, will
die of want, and call down curses on Griffith
and MTlwraith and the affable B. 1),
Morehead from their graves, but the rest
will serve to increase the population of the
country, and, through their competition,
wages will fall, and through the falling of
ivages rents will rise. And to make rents
rise is the last and noblest aim of modern
civilisation. For there is only one civilisa-
tion, and it consists principally of land
booms, and the Kanakilorifl is its prophet.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Melbourne Tramway Scare.
Two years ago the one-pound shares of the
Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Co., with
ten shillings paid-up, were sold as high as T9,
and quoted up to T9 8s. On Saturday last,
after a long downward progression, the
announcement that the directors would have to
omit the expected July dividend sent them
down to 16s. at one pop -the fall being Is. 6d.
on the price of the previous day—and they
finished at 16s. 6d. No one can tell where they
will be by tire end of the month since it is now
remembered that the cables will have to be
completely renewed within a. year or so, a
contingency which may necessitate a call, and
hat in three years the Legislature will have the
right to reduce the fares, a measure upon which
public opinion will assuredly insist. It is quite
evident that the wires are being pulled just
as dexterously now to induce shareholders
to sell on a panic as they were pulled
three years back to tempt the public
to buy at any price. A similar game was
played to the great advantage of the inner
ring when the mines on the famous Comstock
Lode in Nevada were carefully boomed from
eight dollars up to eight hundred and then just
as artistically pulled down again to something
closely approaching the original figure. So far
as the Melbourne trains are concerned, there is
no doubt that the boom and the burst-up have
both been ■engineered with very great skill, and
very probably those who planned the first are
not entirely unconcerned in the second. No-
thing can be nicer than to buy shares at 10s.,
sell them at £9, and then frighten the holder
into letting you have them again at the original
figure. Such an operation may be repeated
five or six times in the 23 years the Melbourne
Tramway Company’s monopoly has to last, and
the lucky participators in the profits thereto
will find themselves and their families very well
provided for at the end of the period. Mean-
while, looking at the rush for shares in 1890
and the rush to get rid of them in 1892, the
only conceivable comment must be couched in
the phraseology of Bumble— “ The public is a
bass.” But that conclusion does not affect the
fact that the Tramway ring contains the most
audacious and unscrupulous schemers in Aus-
tralia.

Gladstone on Freedom.
The old Liberal Party in England is fast getting
out of date. Except on the one question of
Irish autonomy it is but little in advance of
the despised Tory gang with its policy of stag-
nation and stupidity. It has a grovelling rever-
ence for “ freedom of contract” and “vested
interests ” and all the old, sacred maunderiugs
of British politics. It grieves over poverty and
suffering, but it won’t interfere with them lest
it should break up the glorious liberty of the
British citizen. It won’t tax land because that
would burst the Constitution. It won’t inter-
fere with the “ rights ” of the land-grabber or
the sweater or the usurer because they are all
Britons, and Britons never, never shall be.
slaves. Even Gladstone, one of the most
advanced of the ancient Liberals, drivels like
the rest when brought face to face with a
tremendous social evil, as witness his recent
answer to the London Trades Council deputa-
tion re the eight-hours question t
Mr. Gladstone said, in the course of the conference,
that lie \Vas not sanguine of the eight-hour system being-
legalised. The difficulty Involved in such a course was
that it iCould destroy freedom.
So it would. It would destroy the freedom of
the British railway employe, who is now at
liberty to work 16 hours a day for seven days
a week. It would be an unjustifiable inter-
ference with the ’bus-driver, who sits on his box
for 17 hours per diem. It would create a bloated
and unconstitutional tyranny, to wrest from the
sweated seamstress her hitherto unalienable
privilege of toiling from eight a.m. till midnight,
or thereabouts. It would wreck the inborn
right, secured by Magna Gharta, of any man to
do two men’s work, and thus leave another man
unemployed. The fetish of the Gladstoniail
party is Liberty. In England to-day every
man and woman is at liberty to accept work
at any hours or wages he or she may think
best, or to refuse it if the hours and wages don’t
suit; and every employer is free to offer any
terms he may consider best, and if the terms
are unjust the employe can decline them with the
pride of a free citizen. Also, every landlord is
free to demand any rent he likes, and the tenant
isn’t compelled to close with his terms Unless he
is so inclined,' and all over the glorious isles of
Britain every person, however humble, is free.
The Liberal party grovels before this fetish of
British freedom with a great grovel, and Glad-
stone drivels about it in his old age as a thing
that he desires to leave behind him untarnished
—that it may be a precious legacy to succeeding
generations. And in exactly the same manner
the Briton who falls overboard in the middle
of the Atlantic is free to swim ashore—but all
the same he never gets there; and the man who is
marooned on an ice-floe is at liberty not to
starve or to freeze, but he freezes all the same.
Also, Gladstone himself is at liberty to live
for ever, but the chances are that he will die
none the less. The freedom which he is so
anxious to save from destruction is only the
freedom of every Englishman to accept work at
inhuman hours and starvation wages, or die
miserably in the gutter—to pay an exorbitant
rent to a hereditary land-stealer or be crowded
into the sea. It is a pitiable spectacle to see a
statesman of Gladstone’s reputation maunder-
ing over the preservation of individual liberty,
when this is all it amounts to. Liberty, of the
good old constitutional kind, has been the curse
of England, and it would have been better for
that unhappy land that its fetish had never
been invented.
———
A Scalp and Shinbones.
The Maoriland Government wants a reliable
guarantee from General Booth that, if his
paupers are permitted to locate themselves in
the country, none of them shall ever become
chargeable on the benevolent institutions of the
province. Booth declines to give this guarantee.
As that bilious prophet wants to have the
authority of a landlord over his Salvation
colony it naturally follows that he would have
power to eject any colonist who didn’t pay his
rent, and that evicted individual would, almost
to a certainty, end by becoming a pauper
chargeable, not to Booth, but to the Maoriland
revenue. Should the B.Vllanc'E Government
allow Booth to bring his moral wrecks to
Maoriland the shortest way out of the difficulty
is to absolutely prohibit ejectment, but to allow
the General, for the sake of peace and order, to
execute any Salvation emigrant who proves
irreclaimable, and send his scalp and shinbones
to the Treasury as a guarantee that he won’t
become a burden on the country. These
remains could bo accompanied by a certificate
stating the reasons which induced Booth to
take this extreme course. Nothing short of
this, so far as we can see, will meet the case.
If the Salvation potentate isn’t allowed to eject
his paupers they may simply live rent-free on
the property, and raise Cain generally, and do
no work. If he is allowed to eject them he
will merely shift the burden on to someone
else. He might, of course, be allowed to flog
the Salvationists and set them to hard labour on
the big drum, but this course would involve
too much trouble. Execution is the only remedy,
after all—execution, and plenty of it, and no
questions asked.


An “Enormous Shrinkage of Assets” has
occurred to the Hon. James Munro’s hurst-up
bank since that eminent financier got away to
New Babylon. A few figures will serve to
indicate the length, breadth and depth of the
business capacity which qualified Munro for
the positions of Premier and Agent-General of
Victoria. In August last Munro, as chairman
of the Real Estate, &c., Bank, told the share-
holders that their property was in such a healthy
condition that no further call of capital was
contemplated, and the directors cherished hopes
of being able to recommence business shortly.
Everything was as it professed to be on the
balance-sheet, and the financial outlook was
clear and beautiful. So said James. The
liquidators’ report on these same assets leaves
the shareholders at liberty to say whether the
vanished chairman was a liar or a fool, or both.
They have dropped their “ sugar ” and can take
their choice. The properties described as in
splendid condition last August are now “written
down” by the liquidators to the tune of
£785,000. Bills receivable have melted from
£IIO,OOO to £29,000. Overdrawn accounts
representing £99,000 in the books are estimated
to produce £43,000—a “shrinkage” which
could be best explained by a published list of
the over-drawers. Finally, the liquidators have
achieved a brilliant stroke of satire by “ cancel-
ling ” a reserve fund of £IOO,OOO, together with
certain mystic “ undivided profits ” amounting
to £32,000. Considering that rather more than
a million sterling of Munro’s visionary assets
are cancelled ! the reserve-fund and the un-
divided profits strike one as being the falsest
creations that any distinguished Victorian poli-
tician ever crowded into a balance sheet.

Owing to the encroachments of landlordism in
the United Kingdom, Great Britain was unable
to grow enough wheat to support her domestic
population in 1840, and hence the necessity of
the destruction of deer-parks or recourse to
foreign agriculturists to feed the nation.
Under Socialistic conditions the position would
stand thus : Total acreage of United Kingdom,
77 millions of acres. Assuming 50 per cent,
(this is liberal enough) to consist of unsuitable
soil, and 25 per cent, to be requisite for pur-
poses other than wheat cultivation, this would
leave 19£ millions of acres available for self-
support. Averaging 30 bushels to the acre, and
51 bushels to the yearly consumption per head
of population, Great Britain would be able to
feed 90,250,000 persons. What are the facts,
however, to - day ? She has under crop
only 2,463,000 acres, producing millions of
bushels, or just enough to feed 15 millions of
persons, or not much more than a third of her
people ! The question now to be faced in the
old country, then, amounts to this : Either
nationalisation must be introduced, to he followed
hy a strong protective tariff, or else land mono-
poly must be permitted to flourish accompanied
hy Freetrade as far as food is concerned, seeing
that under present circumstances Protection
would be useless in a country which could not
possibly supply its local market requirements.
Freetrade and monopoly are synonymous terms.

Extract from a recent report by Sir William
M‘Gregor, the pious boss of British New
Guinea: —
Mr Fellowes lately visited some of the Misinia villages.
When he had, with the help of the chief, collected the
inhabitants of a certain village to divine service, he asked
the people to kneel down for prayer. They, of course,
laughed at him and refused. For some tune both sides
held out, Mr. Fellowes refusing to proceed with the
service and they declining to kneel. But in the end they
knelt down and closed their eyes, and Mr. f ellowes went
on with the service. Under such guidance the progress
of the mission cannot but be rapid and fruitful.
And yet when the native had knelt down and
closed his eyes while a white man, whom he
probably took for a dangerous lunatic, jabbered
something in an unknown tongue, he got just
as much spiritual benefit as if he had stood on
his head while somebody read over the multi-
plication table. The man who carries the
Gospel to the pore heathen and the man who
carries Euclid to a cow generally make about
the same impression upon the audience.
A Hot Beginning.
When the old Sydney Theatre Royal (destroyed
by fire on Friday morning last) opened on Satur-
day, December 11, 1875, poor Sam Lazar, the
lessee, was hugely delighted to be able to secure
the attendance of the stout Sir Hercules Robinson,
his large lady, the St. Johns and Hutchinsons,
and the rest of them, for the creed of Sydney
society, 17 years ago, certainly was—of such is the
Kingdom of Heaven. So Lazar prepared a
spectacle for the edification of their mightinesses
which was to keep them his special friends for
ever and to make his fortune into the bargain. It
was not the piece. Oh, dear no ! That was a
tame affair called Daisy Farm” wherein G. 13.
Russell murdered J. P. West, who offended every-
body terribly, not so much by coming to life again
himself, but because he thereby prevented Russell
from being hanged for putting an end to him.
The climax of the ceremony was to have been
reached at the end of the second act, when
addresses and speeches, all carefully prepared and
highly laudatory of Sir Hercules Robinson, Mr.
Lazar, and other notable personages, were to be
delivered from the stage. But the night was a
broiler, the hottest of all that hot season, and
Lady Robinson was fat and scant of breath. She
came, she saw, she sweltered. Her temper was as
large as her skirts, and she wanted to go at the
end of the first act. There was not a breath
of air in the theatre. Lazar had carefully
announced who made the seats, who
covered them, and who gilded them ; who
decorated the ceiling and who' carpeted the Hour ;
who made the lamps and who supplied the fixtures.
But he had forgotten to state who arranged the
ventilation- in fact, he had forgotten to provide
any. My lady’s purpose was foiled, for when she
tried to rise, Sir Hercules fairly held her down,
while the gallant St. John and the athletic
Hutchinson went and broke the windows to give
her some little ease. It was a vain expedient,
for the windows opened on nowhere. As the
curtain descended on the second act, fhe. pof
spiring lady flounced from her seat and tied, nir
Hercules obediently following, and Society, which
‘could not stay after dear Lady Robinson had
gone,” rushing precipitately after. The rest o
the audience departed in search of beer, and no
man alive knows whether these addresses were
duly delivered. Indeed, the piece itself.would
have been plaved out in solitude, but for t e at
that Sam Lazar had hospitably bidden a lot of
men to a supper at Polly Smith’s tavern, next
door, to follow the performance, and they were,
in common decency, bound to show up after the
interval.
# * *
According’ to the description afforded to the
public by the prospectuses, “the dress circle was
a luxurious lounge,” and “the theatre replete
with every convenience, accommodation and com-
fort that architectural skill could devise.’’ We
had scented almanacs and Christmas cards pre-
sented to us as we went in, and we had
the pleasure of seeing a number of venerable
and respectable personages, many of whom still
adorn the stage, doing their best to be gay and
frisky in a temperature of 14G deg. and an atmos-
phere of Tophet. Those who were lucky enough
to sit on the o.p. side might see Mr. Lazar in the
prompt entrance jumping and stamping about in
a vain endeavour to get the artists to liven the
thing un, as if anything in the world could
liven “Daisy Farm.” It was a poor sort of piece
based upon an incident which had been done to
death five hundred times before. A vagrant who
knows that a wife has been previously married to a
man something likehimself in face and figure,comes
back and pretends to be the deceased hubby. The
lady goes into varied hysterics, the second hus-
band gives the tramp =£soo to begone, the lady s
scapegrace son, who would be the returned hero s
first-born if the returned iiero did not turn out to
be somebody else, throws his supposed parent over
a precipice to get the .£5OO, and everything looks
very blue for everybody when a wandering tourist
named Craven recognises the tramp as a dis-
charged soldier who had been drummed out of his
own regiment, and calls out in a tone of command
“ Jiichard Clarke ! ” whereat the impostor salutes,
and so shows that he cannot be the defunct
Burridge. All me, how dull it was, to be sure,
and how glad we were when it was all over to
console ourselves with the cold collation and
lukewarm drinks of Polly Smith, and to pretend
that the whole business had been a big success !
» # *
On the stage that night were Adelaide Bowring,
Kate Douglas, Maggie Oliver (the only one of the
party who was endurably vivacious), and Dolly
Forde. Also, W. J. Holloway, pretending to be
a cool and careless tourist —“I never carry lug-
gage, and you may track me all over Europe by
cast-off paper-collars ” —E. B. Russell, playing at
being a juvenile actor ; Joyce, Daniels, Boston, C.
P. Carey, and other long-standing institutions of
this great and glorious country. Tito reserve
forces included Kate Arden, Nelly Greenless, Mrs.
Wooldridge, Miss Melville, J. D. Marsh, Hasher,
and others; the one spark of youth and genius in
the lot being our special and particular Myra
Kemble, “than whom,” &c. Apropos, she is just
back from Maoriland, looking lovely.

There was a rare scene on Friday morning when
the fire was announced, and Adonis Stuart and
Hercules Standing and all the rest of the gallant
and gorgeous gentry of the company tore them-
selves from the arms of beauty or the slumbers of
innocence, as the case might be, and bolted off to
see what could be saved from “ the devouring
element.” For it is no joke to lose your props.
A sweetheart may be picked up at any time, but
the wigs of Clarkson and Toy, the garments of
May or Monsieur Alias, the grease-paints of
Germany, the rouge and pads of Paris, and the
multifarious odds and ends of a stage existence
cost time and money, and are not to be got every
day everywhere. Happily everything of that sort
was saved, and the public will still be able to
delight themselves by gazing on the same old com-
plexions and calves which have already enchanted
the gallery, enthralled the circle, and set all the
damsels in the stalls inditing love-letters by the
bushel to the shapely and stalwart heroes of the
footlights.

A more remarkable series of blunders than that
perpetrated in Saturday’s Sydney Morning-
Herald concerning the fire at the Theatre Royal
has rarely distinguished any newspaper. It gives
the date of opening in half-a-dozen places as
September 11, 1875, instead of December 11 m
that year; it speaks of the building as “being
the scene of so many histrionic triumphs from
Ristori to Bernhardt,” forgetting that Riston
always played at the other shop, the Victoria, and
left Australia finally one week before the Royal
was opened, sailing from Adelaide on December 4,
1875; and it also makes the Royal the scene of
“ the first production of ‘Struck Oil,’ by Maggie
Moore and J. C. Williamson,” who had long

What Australian dares to talk like Be 11
Tillett to a public meeting at Wigan ? “Th e
aristocracy are dying out because of their luxury
—sallow-skinned numskulls—their daughters too
weak to walk, and their sons accomplished m
every vice.”
Toko Arakino, a Maori charged at Auck-
land with breaking up a school, pleaded that he
had “ no brains in his head and couldn’t work for
a living.” We know several with Toko’s trouble,
but they wear bigger collars and are not so candid.
Toko got 12 months, subject to medical exam.
From the Sporting Times
Mr. Fairie, whose horse Galeopsis ran so well in the
Two Thousand, became a millionaire in a remarkable
manner. Fora time he was in low water in Australia,
when he came across a man to whom he had lent i-100.
The man could not pay him, but said that he had an
original share in the Broken Hills which he would let him
have for £l5O. This was refused, and it was finally
decided to plav five games of bcart<s to decide whether
the price should be £2OO or £lOO. Mr. Fairie won, and
out of this hundred pounds he cleared one million sterling,
and it would have been three millions if he had stuck to
the whole of the share.
Who is “Mr. Fairie?”
From a twaddling review of a twaddling
novel, “The Shelling of the Peas,’’one can extract
a fair idea of the modern lady’s novel, and its
favourable press notice —“In the first instance,
‘one of the magnates of the neighbourhood,’Mr.
Denzil Seymour, catches her at her work. ‘ Shel-
ling peas,’ he exclaimed, ‘ how delightful. I have
not been permitted that delightful diversion since
I was in the nursery, when nurse used to bring me
some pods by way of a treat. Miss Millicent,
allow me to help yon ; peas always had a fascina-
tion for me.’ As may be imagined, Seymour is
the heroine’s fate” —remarks the idiot reviewer
who singles out this balderdash for admiration.
It doesn’t say much for Millicent that the reader
is expected to see this “fate” of hers at a glance.
What a fate I To be hopelessly mashed by a
Denzil-the everlasting Denzil of three-volume
novels—who talks of enjoyable diversions, and
vows that peas always had a fascination for him.
Anv reasonable heroine would kill Denzil in the
second chapter, and Stew him along with ti e
vegetables.
Good-Bye, Ireland! *
(Being the reply of an English Socialist to a “Patriot
request to “ once more co-operate in work for the good
old Came of Home Rule for Ireland.”)
Good-bye, Ireland ! I’ve loved you long: and well,
I loved you first in the days when you lay on your
face in hell,
With the whip on your fleshless shoulders and the
goad in your hollow flank.
And the blood-suckers, blind in blood clung on to
your limbs and drank ;
In the days when your servile priests sat chalk-
faced, chewing meal,
And abjured you to do no murder, and, much
more, not to steal.
But now it is very different. Their speech is high
and free,
Your bishops and priests surround you, a goodly
company!
You've got Walsh the Wobbler. What do you
want with me ?
Good-bye, Ireland ! In those days, in this moral
land of mine,
There were no godly and greasy souls to bluster,
rant and whine
At the age-long tale of your wrongs, at the spec-
tacle of your woes,
But we faced alone for your sake the winds, the
rains, the snows,
And the love wherewith we loved you and the
trust in you we had
Were a new hope in the human heart to make us
proud and glad.
But now it is very different. Your talk’s but of
“policy,”
And the old Liberal Gang’s around you, and
they give you three times three,
You’ve got Gladstone, the Gobbler, What do
you want with me ?
Good-bye, Ireland ! I ask you what did you do
With the Man who won life and freedom and
victory for you ?
Who alone of all mankind came down to you there
in hell?
Who lifted you up and kissed you, and beat back
your foemen fell ?
Who clothed you and arrayed you in the garb of a
nation great,
And put at last in your hands the shining sceptre
of Fate ?
He loved another man’s wife, you say, and there-
fore you and She,
The shop-keeping English Wolf, your friend, you
throttled him—righteously.
You’ve got Healy the Hell-Cat. What do you
want with me ?
Good-bye, Ireland ! We've woes and wrongs of
our own ;
In our reeking alleys they gibber ; in our rotten
cots they moan,
And you’ve shown us they’re nothing to you,
except to barter and sell,
Any more than that Man who raised you from out
of the gutter of hell.
And if Wobblers, and Gobblers, and Hell-Cats to
your heaven can bring you in.
We’re free to admit that you stand a very fair
chance to win.
But this is very different. You’re a clever jade
Play out your little game—play it very carefully.
Get into heaven, or go back to hell! It’s the
same to me !
FRANCIS ADAMS.
* “ I don’t know if you’re aware,” wrote a correspon-
dent to The Bulletin by a recent mail, “ that at present
the caucus of the Irish party is almost in the hands of
Tim Healy, who is backed up by Archbishop Walsh and
the bishops, and that it is now necessary for a man to be
a ‘ Cartholic ’ to have any chance at all with the crowd.
This state of things is infernal, and not the least infernal
part of it is the acquiescence of the old Liberal gang, who
run Gladstone, and of the young Nonconformist gang,
with Brice Hughes and Stead at their head. The Old
Man has just refused to receive a Labour deputation in re
the Eight Hours question, and the whole crowd (Morley
with them) are shutting down as hard as they can on any-
thing but the old stock Liberal tommy-rot.”
Old Swan, the millionaire contractor, was
profoundly impressed by seeing “ Money ” acted,
at Melbourne Bijou, with the scene of the
expectant legatees over the reading of the will;
and, says he, “ Same here,” being a widower with
a grown-up family all able to earn their own liveli-
hood. “Why don't he die ?—that’s what they’re
saying,” said he, whereupon he married the beau-
tiful Ruby Skinner. Old Swan became a swell,
knocking the money down with his pretty wife,
new mansion, britzka and pair, and goodness
knows what, and when he died he left all the
balance to the Victorian Government, to keep the
Melbourne Observatory going, in emulation of
the noble Californian Jim Lick.
In a Melbourne daily newspaper-office
were two gentlemen of the same name, but in no
way related. One is editor of a sporting weekly
published from the same office. The other is a
comp, on the daily. Say the name is Wolff. Mr.
Wolff, the sporting editor, was blissfully uncon-
scious of the existence of Wolff, the comp., until
one day a writ was served upon him in his sanctum
at the 'instance of a small suburban time-payment
barber. The staff remembers still that Mr. Wolff
swore horribly, and was unapproachable until,
after protracted enquiries, he discovered that a
namesake of his had been born and was then
working at “case ” upstairs. The writ was then
successfully passed on to its proper destination,
and the editorial profanity vanished into thin air.
A few months later, however, a grocery-bill of
respectable dimensions was found by Mr. Wolff
among his letters at the office, and as he
had never heard of the grocer, nor of the items,
his expressions of displeasure had more cayenne
in them than on the previous occasion. The bill
was promptly forwarded to Wolff, the comp. In
the fullness of time a second writ was served upon
Mr. Wolff, the editor, and this was followed by
variegated bills for a choice assortment of articles
ranging from socks to perambulators. Instead,
however, of bowing to the decrees of use and
wont, and enjoying the thing now that it seemed
inevitable, Mir, Wolff began to talk bloodthirsty,
and wild ideas of murder as a justifiable pastime
found expression even in his leisure hours. But
the climax had yet to come. Some weeks after the
disastrous floods of last year, Mr. Wolff, the
editor, on arriving one morning found on his table
a massive communication from the Town Hall,
intimating that his application for assistance from
t u Central Floods Relief Fund had been refused,
enquiries having elicited that he was earning a
substantial income as editor of the , and that
the committee could not, in view of that fact,
regard his case as one of bonci-iidc distress. For
some months after that eventful and stormy
morning, a wild eyed and fading editor mechani-
cally passed every suspicious-looking missive up to
the comps.’ room, and a few weeks ago the pro-
prietors, in order to restore him to health and
reason, generously consented to —well, to add
unfortunate Wolff, the comp., to the ranks of the
unemployed. Mr. Wolff is progressing favourably.

No notice will be taken of communications which arrii'i
at this office insufficiently stamped.
“G. Jackson Too much dragged out. “Boil-
ing Billy ” told practically the same story in Tub Bulletin
weeks ago, and put it into half a column—“ A.G.” :
Thanks. Nice, bloodthirsty story, well t01d... “B.
Stalker”: “Murder will out” is all nonsense. The
murders you hear of come out, and the murders you don’t
hear of don’t come out—that’s all. You hear of the
unhappy marriages because they are advertised in the
papers, and you don’t hear of the happy marriages
uecause they are not advertised in the papers. Same
thing “E. Trevor”: Declined with thanks
“ S.H.C." (Hyde): Glad to know you are English and
“had forbear mayor of in i4no.” We had “for-
bear ” in Redfern in 1840, if that interests you. Will have
much pleasure in being out any time you ca 11...
“0.L.D.” : There are no brains in your lyric about little
Bill. The jingle is all right, we admit “ J. 5.8.”
(Goulburn): Somewhat reminiscent of Bret Harte’s “ Her

alike.. “Baldwin”: Shall be glad to road it
“Fred W. K.”; To hand ... “ Oomaban ” (N.) ; Letter
posted ... 11 A.C.F.” : “The Weeping Tree,” which is
the best, is merely a dilution of Heine's immortal “Pine-
tree and Palm tree ” “ Thistles ” : Such maunderings
are never read. We never get beyond the first and last
lines “Vailele”; Both unavailable, although excel-
lently written. Try something else... “C.F.8.”: Try,
say, Sydney Mail, or some paper which runs a column
labelled “ Wit anrl Humour”. ..“A.G.M.”: Nice little
verses. Write ’em in her album “ E. 8.11.” : What’s
this you’re giving us about the hospital patient whose
temperature was 140 degrees? “Taylor H.” (E.) :
Mark Twain again !....“ George M‘A.” : Such verse may
remain standing over indefinitely....“ L.H.H.” : Cook-
town story as ancient as the Palmer-road conglomerate

something short and sharp. Anyhow, something shorter
and sharper “Sunny South”: The thing has been
done too often “F.M.”: Item wants washing...
“The Curfew”: Will read... “Egeria”: “Sydney-

is it all about? “M.T.”: May print some day. They
will be just as fresh and true in 2000 years “ W. Bur-
gess ” (Tas.): Don’t rememberony enquiries for John and
William Burgess. Can you give us the date of the
paper? “A.K.W.”: The facts are that about 20 years
back, in Canada, while Thomas Walker and a mate named
Saunders were trying to produce or simulate Spiritualistic'
phenomena with phosphorus, Saunders was killed. The
Melbourne action, Walker v. Dowie, arose from Dowie’s
incorrect allegation that Walker fled from justice....

“W.S.”: Our example was typical; yours is merely
a repetition.... “Candide et Constanter” : Many thanks.
... “ W.E.W.” : All venerable save one “Straight
Wire”: Not adapted for illustration... “O.”: As your
lines on “ The First Born ” are old friends, and therefore
stolen, we did not take the trouble to read the rest of
your MS. which probably is also stolen. A man who con-
tributes stolen matter as original and draws coin for it is
liable to be sent to gaol for obtaining money by false pre-

“Crosscut”; Many thanks “Disciple”: Why not boil
it down ? “ Port Jackson ” ; Nature doesn’t give sea-
going birds coloured wings, anyhow. White sails look
best “W. Warren” : Hardly suitable, though good in

good little boy in the especially large collar lacked con-
tinuity of thought.” We know that boy — “Bob Smith”:
If you “can’t understand our theory,” then there’s some-
thing wrong either with you or the theory. The theory’s
all right....“ Thomas G ”: Your “series of tales
abbout a sqater of twenty-five ycers standin” doesn’t
tempt us “G. Waite ”: The Bulletin wants a second
Chamber elected on the one-man-one-vote system by the
whole province acting as one constituency, because, other-

every House under the present system, halt the members
are willing to vote for any iniquity so long as they get a
railway made to Cow Flat... “ Astar ”; A very heavy joke ..
“ The Dingo ” ; If you had written “ Henry V.” we verily
believe you would" have started by saying that you were
told the story by his son, Henry VI., when you met him
shearing out by the Lachlan with his hair stai ding up
through his hat. Can’t you tell your own story?
“Sceptic”: You suffer from the same complaint as the
individual in the last paragraph... “8.R.5.” (Brighton,
Vic.); You have the same disease, only worse. Instead
of telling your story you meet a sundowner, and he tells
you that a shearer told him about something that hap-
pened to a prospector... “Stolburg”: The “natural
man ”is not “on an equality with all.” The biggest man
or the dirtiest man runs the show there as well as here.
Besides, we doubt if there ever was a natural man. Man
is unnatural. The natural man is a monkey, and what
the natural monkey is we don't know “ J.H.D.” :We
get so many card yarns in which the spieler is cleaned out
that we begin to wonder what spielers live on
“ F.W.K.” (Sydney): Dreams with moans and blood and

us of that eminent litterateur Ferdinand Brambler
“Dunbar”: Three objections—the story is told by a

816 Macquari c-street North, Sydney, June 22,1892
My Dbar Moorabinda, —
From a sartorial point of view, “ La Cigale,” at Her
Majesty’s, is very taking, because there isn’t a pleated
petticoat anywhere in the opera. The management has
sliced the ballerinas’ frocks into hanging panels (you can’t
kick in gores, you know) rather than bore the audience
with another surfeit of the concertina skirt. Marie
Halton, as Marton, didn’t dress to flabbergasting lengths.
Marie (viewed with feminine dispassion) is the usual
plump prima-donna with a comic-opera nose “ shaped to
catch the rain,” as they say in Paris, and a clever way of
dressing herself, except in the middle act, perhaps. When
a star is what the “ found-drowned ” reports call “ well-
nourished,” let her beware of glove-fits in satin as she
would of a wrinkle in her silken hose.
In the first act Marton wears a pink and floral costume
with a big hat and her hair down -an artless-village-
maidish get-up which becomes her better than either of
her other glories. There is probably consummate art on
her side. Does not the girl from Dough Flat look much
more charming in farm rags and her brother’s old
bluchers than when she’s got up in her Sunday cashmere
and parasol? In act two, Marton, in trained yellow
satin and a diamond necklace and black lace petticoats
beneath, might have been the mamma of the skittish
creature of the opening scene. The last gorgeous act
(en parenihise, a rainbow is the only thing that might
find something to sneer at in the staging of “ La Cigale
a mere drab-coloured individual can only sit in dazzled
astonishment while the stage-manager and the limelight
man are making his or her eyes water with a three-act
sketch of clamorous colour) revealed La Cigale looking
slimmer in cream brocade flowered with crimson and
green ; underdress of cream filmy material and golden
girdle-an easy fitting bit of apparelling which the light-
ning change to black rags and guitar and back again
made necessary, I suppose.
The corps du theatre had every stitch of canvas on, so
to speak, from the smallest baby jigging in the miniature
ballet to—well—whoever considers him or herself the
starting-point of the troupe. Flora Graupner’s white
brocade and silver wedding-dress was a dainty turn-out,
and Florence Young’s last array of pale-green brocade
with pink flowers mingled with pink silk and tan-
coloured lace took a trick, but I didn’t care for the
bizarre dressing of the ptihnibre danseuse. She fluttered
in as many gay odds-and-ends as a “sacrifice remnant”
counter. Nevertheless, she and the prima-donna took all
the floral tributes flying round at the opening. Yum-yum!
Discussing the dressing of “La Cigale,” it is pertinent
to wonder why they didn’t have the French novelty-
garters for the danseuses? It’s the latest idea. Bal-
lerinas wear their elongated hosen ostensibly tied above
the knee with long ribbon garters of contrasting hues,
which give a distracting effect to the high kick and must
add greatly to the delight of the bald-headed man in the
front stalls. I read of one effective creature lashing out
in snow-white, cap-k-pie, but with a black ribbon garter
fastened with diamonds.
Meditating over effects of face and figure in “ London
Assurance " I found another (rather delicate) objection to
the abandonment of corsets. As every woman must
know, the tighter the stay the higher and more rounded
becomes the bust, and when no stays are worn the
frontal outline is miserably flat and floppy-looking. The
only advantage—and I suppose in this bare-backed age
it is an advantage—l can see is, that the uncorseted
woman may wear her gowms generously scooped out
frontally in a more abysmal V than her busked sister can,
but I question if a wide-open frock flutterin ground a limp
fall-abroad outline is half so “ chipper ” as a bodice with,
say, half the shutters up, but neatly fitted over a visible
rise and fall ? In some respects a Kanaka belle and a
seraph with no stays on have very much in common.
Gazing at Mrs. Deere as Lady Gay Spanker, it was
cruelly evident that that uncorseted divinity ought to go
hunting in a tea-gown if she wants to look “her own
woman,” for anything more slummocky or uncomfortable-
looking than Mrs. B.’s brown habit on her first appearance
in “London Assurance,” it has never been my luck to
see. Afterwards, Richard was herself again in a
puzzling dinner-dress, rather voluminous skirtally, of
melon-pink erfipe, mostly draped with black gauze, de-
signed in gold, bodice folded in pink and black, and many
dazzling diamonds.
Miss Urquhart’s Paris figure was draped in a pale-grey
frock, very well moulded round the hips; and a cream
guipure over violet silk, with big sleeves, and trimmed
with lines of purple velvet, which formed a sash for the
waist. By the way, quite a rustle ran thro’ the gods, and
I heard one faint, far-away “Or-der-er!” when Lady Gay
talked of her horse Blueskin to Teddy Royce, who stood
by in the character of Sir Harcourt, got-up to perfection
in a dyed wig and rouged cheeks. But has Herbert
Standing gone to a ring-dove for ideas on his ocular
make-up?
One thing nobody seems to have noticed about Mr.
Walter Bentley is his ladylike finger-tips, where the filbert
nails shine like mother-o’-pearl. Mr. Bentley is a firm
believer in manicure, and his digit-points are quite
encouraging to beginners in the nail-improving art.
Apropos of personal appearance, I want to give a word
of comfort to the girl with the freckled face. If the spots
are acquired and not bequeathed by some distant ancestor
who may have resembled a frost-bitten orange as he hung
by his tail from a tree, then they only speckle your speakr
Ing frontispiece just as long as you want them to. For
those annoying specks which pepper one’s nose so after a
ride, or a picnic, or any such gambol in the sun, a certain
cure has been discovered. Here is the recipe:—Two
drachma of sal-ammonia” with an ounce of German
cologne. Mix with a pint of distilled water and apply two
or three times a day.
Talking about freckles somehow reminds me that the
very latest idea is photographing people in their natural
colours. But is it an unmixed blessing? Certainly the
present “photo.” is either a hdeoas caricature or a
nauseating flattery, but we are used to it, and when we
come out profiled to Grecian point, when we are really
snubby, we almost love it. The world isn’t honest enough
for natural-coloured photographs. Let’s take the opinion
of the red-headed houri, the green-eyed girl, the
parchment-cheeked darlings, and, above all, the freckled
fairies.
The povv-wow at Sydney School of Arts strikes me as
being an eloquent argument against cock-and-hen
societies, and the shrill shriek of the lady-member (whose
subscription has been raised and whose reading-room for
“ many, many years,” as one fairy pathetically but un-
guardedly put it, has been taken away), and the pacifying
growl of the male member (who remains in statu, quo)
make it very clear that the lion and the lamb can’t share
the same stockyard yet awhile.
Mr. and Madame Kellermann gave a musical “at home”
last week at their residence, “Canala,” Potts Point, to a
crowd of people, who passed a charming time, of course :
for Madame Kellermann, in a Frenchy-looking dress of
sea-green silk and silver striped gauze, with green moire
sash and Watteau bow, played a solo in her brilliant,
fretful style ; Deslouis warbled like a lark ; and Poussard
fiddled until his diamond ring shot sparks.
Some pretty dresses found their way in, too. Mrs.
(Mayoress) Manning’s turn-out of golden brocade, sub-
dued with black velvet, was very clever ; her two
daughters, in pale-pink chiffon and black velvet, respec-
tively, w ere well contrasted ; Miss Florrie Hill sported
pale-cream and green brocade; Miss Nellie Hill’s frock
seemed to consist of folds of sea-green aerophane ; Miss
Ethel Manning couldn’t have chosen a more becoming
get-up than her pale-blue tulle and diamonds; Mrs, Garvam
Mrs. Williamson and Mrs. (Dr.) Laure wore black. Mrs
8. Hordern’s was a very intricate garment ; pale-grey and
pale-strawberry'-pink brocade formed the bodice and train,
the jupe of pink silk, covei’ed with black jetted tulle, the
Medici collar lined with pink ostrich feathers.
Apropos music. Miss Bessie Doyle has returned to
Sydney, from Leipsic, is a rather pretty girl of
twenty' years or so, with a big book of German critic,
isms of the most marmalade-ish description and a wonder-
ful violin. She makes her professional re-entrde at
soon, in a short series of concerts under the management
of Mr. Charles Bowler, and Sydney is sure to give its own
particular prodigy a warm welcome. Among the German
criticisms aforesaid, Miss Bessie is alluded to as the third
violinist lady in the world, and judging by these Teutonic
remarks (for the lady refuses to play a note for friend or
foe in private), Australia has eveiy' reason to be proud of
Bessie.
Sydney Women’s College is always chivvying some wild
idea or other, and hardly a day passes without a well-
dressed deputation bearding somebody to see if they can
have something. The latest troop wanted to have the
site set apart in the 'Varsity grounds for the Public
Instruction Training Schools given over to the Women’s
College building, in support of which demand it w'as
pointed out that the first-named site was nearerthe public
road, and was in many respects more suited for the pur-
pose of a Women’s College. Either site would be equally
good for the students of the Training College.
But this is rank injustice. As if the girls in training
for public-school billets don’t want to look innocently out
of the window as well as the Women’s College students!
But, after all, the training schools are not wholly given
over to the girls, as the Ladies’ College is, and I really
think, with the deputation, that it’s right they should
have the best position for catching the public gaze.
I hear from Goulburn that Mrs. Dalglish (now in
England), one of the rich Broken Hill widows, is going to
marry a Mr. Bellasis, a middle-aged gentleman with a
large family and little money'. He belongs, though, to
“ a good old Catholic family,” and this may make amends
for the disparity in fortune. The happy couple are
going to reside at Lulworth Castle, the home of the
Weld-Blundells in Lancashire.
The accidental death of Governor Jersey’s unfortunate
aide-de-camp, the Earl of Ancram, has dashed the matri-
monial hopes of (among a host of others) a very charming
Southern society girl. But she should dry her pretty
eyes, for papa (the Marquis) rvould never have heard of
the match. Flirting with an earl (unless you are titled
too) is usually a game without a goal, unless he happens
to wear a very inferior sort of ancestral holt, and has got
down to be a billiard-marker.
A very pretty costume ball was given by Mr. and Mrs.
Bransby at their residence, “ Cambridge Villa,” Coogee,
on 17th inst., in honour of Mrs. Bransby’s eldest daughter,
Miss Stewart, attaining her majority. The four daughters
of the house represented the seasons—Miss Stewart, as
“Autumn,” wearing an artistic brown dress, With red
poppies and wheat-ears. Mrs. Bransby', who made a tire-
less hostess, wore a black satin brocade gown. Speeches
were made over the big birthday cake, and a special tram
took everybody back to town at 2 a.m.
It’s a pleasing thing that the fire which scorched up the
dear old Theatre Royal, didn’t destroy Mrs. Beere’s
Lady Teazle dresses, for they certainly looked very
’andsome on the Criterion stage—that’s one comfort
about a little theatre, you never want opera-glasses to see
if the train really is faced with moird antique. Mrs.
Beere wore two shrieks in the “School for Scandal.”
The first had a white silk front frosted in silver ; train of
cream satin, with a deep scarlet facing and border of
jewelled flowers ; diamonds all about. The second was a
filmy get-up of cobwebby dcru lace over pink silk, the
pale-green silk train flowered with big faint pink flowers
and faced with Spring green—a poetic confection in which
Mrs. B. looked like the dreamy sort of creature who gets
lithographed on the front-page of the “ Hug me Again ”
valse.
There was a crowd in the oirele on the second night. I

“ La Cigale,” with the fair Marie Halton as
theheroine, made its dehut at Her Majesty ’s(Sydney)
in the-presence of a crowded and enthusiastic
audience, which afterwards cooled off visibly. This
result was not surprising, for “La Cigale ” is a
woefully unsatisfactory opera. It is always on
the verge of doing something, yet never does it.
The heroine is a frivolous maiden with not much
brain and no thought for the future, and at the
beginning the author seems to imply that some-
thing is going to happen to her, but nothing does
happen. She has a faithful but despairing lover
who has no earthly business in the bill unless his
fidelity is going to be rewarded, for he has nothing
to do save to hang round and wait for better times ;
yet the curtain falls and leaves him hanging. The
wicked though gaudy Duke “lays for” La Cigale in
the first act, apparently with a sinful purpose; but
the purpose doesn’t come off, and the wicked Duke
isn’t confounded —in fact, nothing happens to him
at all. He doesn’t even say anything of impor-
tance, apparently because he hasn’t anything to
say. His wife leads a certain Chevalier astray,
and the Duke comes upon them while they are
sinfully mashing each other in a summer-house,
and then he goes away without seeing anything,
lie never does see anything, in fact. When the
Chevalier casts the lady off, and falls honestly in
love with another girl, she vows a fearful ven-
geance, and doesn’t even attempt to carry it
out instead, she comes back smiling, and
becomes the sincere friend of everybody. La
Cigale has a portentous vision, but as it
doesn’t come true, and nothing more is heard
about it, she might as well have a cold
bath. A very, very sad and ancient mendicant
intrudes himself into the opera, but he is nobody’s
long-lost father, and nobody recognises him, and
he hasn’t a message for anybody—he simply stays
awhile and then drifts away. The good girl of
the story marries a bumpkin with a head like an
evergreen tree, and the girl who isn’t so good
married a rich nobleman —apparently as a solemn
warning to all girls not to be too good. Both
these girls are the daughters of a sausage-maker
who was hanged. With only about two excep-
tions the songs have no connection with the
alleged plot ;“they are mostly harmless little things
about summer and zephyrs, and bovvers and
breezes, and they are led up to with difficulty by
somebody who makes a remark about the weather.
Sometimes they are not led up to at all, but are
simply dragged in by the ear.
# * *
These are a few of the disadvantages
“La Cigale.” Among its advantages are Charles
Ryley, whose Chevalier is an almost faultless
performance ; and the evergreen Howard Vernon,
who does all that man can do for the dancing,
leering Duke —that nobleman who is always on the
verge of being found out by Providence or by his
wife, yet trots along serenely and dodges all the
thunderbolts that ought to hit him and lay him
low. Also, the long-lost J. C. Williamson
reappears as the uncle of the sausage-maker’s
daughters, and makes a beauteous Dutchman who
is not John Stofel, but another Dutchman, pro-
bably his long-lost brother. Pretty little Flora
Graupner is as sweet and successful as a
thankless part will permit, and Miss Florence
Young, as the Duchess, whose oui’se doesn’t come
off and whose anathema misses fire, is a revelation,
inasmuch as she makes the dead waste of that
arid female blossom like the rose, and infuses
life into what was obviously meant for an automa-
ton. Last of all, Miss Marie Halton —we have
left her to the last in the hope ttiat these remarks
may not meet her eye—is a disappointment, and
only fills us with longings to have Billee Barlow
back again regardless of cost. She is a round
lady in a square character, and we say, with sad-
ness, that the lady is very round, and the character
is very square. Also, the scenery is magnificent,
the orchestra is commendable, the ballet is a thing
of unspeakable joy, and the dialogue deserves to
be hanged by the neck till it is dead —dead—and
utterly deceased.

Last Saturday night the partially-com-
busted company from Sydney Royal rose from
its ashes, the Criterion being the scene of the
resurrection. The advertised programme for the
week consisted of three nights of “School for
Scandal,” two more of “ She Stoops to Conquer,”
and a brief resurrection of “Adrienne Lecouvreur.”
The devouring element has left no ashes on Mrs.
Beere’s azure brow, and her Lady Teazle is a
faultless picture of how a woman, who is meant
for better things, may be found behind a screen,
and experience great difficulty in explaining
matters afterwards. It is a sufficient proof of Mrs.
Beere’s genius, that she makes the explanation
appear so absolutely credible, that every separate
male individual in the audience felt prepared to
accept it without hesitation. The statement, as
far as mere words go, is feeble and inconclusive,
and only one actress in a thousand, being found
hidden in a strange snufflebuster’s apartment, can
offer it in such a way as to get through without
any injury to her character. Mr. Herbert Stand-
ing would have been a first-class Charles Surface,
only nature has made him a trifle too massive for
the billet, and it has also made Otlio Stuart
scarcely oily enough for the part of Joseph. He
leaves an impression behind him that he ought to
go and lead some cheaper person astray, and
someone whose fall wouldn’t be so much regretted.
When an Eve of so many attractions and so much
brain is to be tempted, a serpent of the biggest
and shiniest order should be engaged for the job,
and Otlio Stuart, though a large and polished
dramatic reptile, is hardly large enough. M.
Marius had a small show as Trip, and got level by
elevating that mannikin to unexpected import-
ance, and E. W. Royce came out in all his wonted
brilliance as Uncle Surface—the first of that long
line of dramatic uncles who keep turning up on
the stage even unto this day. Also, Miss Isabella
Urquhart was Lady Sneerwoll, and was eminently
successful as such ; the dresses were gorgeous and
showed no signs of having been dragged out from
beneath the ruins of the fallen Royal; the fittings,
fixtures and utensils were all that could be
desired ; and Mr, Cathcart, as Sir Peter, was
blessed with the privilege of being for two brief
hours the fleeting husband of the star. He seemed
to deserve the billet,‘■htnl when he found the lady
under the painful mrciimstances aforementioned
he accepted her explanations in a manner which
did him credit.
The Jubilee Singers and Virginia Concert
Company are still gathering large audiences at the
Sydney Centenary Hall. The three things which
are certain to command unlimited public support
in this blasb generation are a glaring leg-show, a
particularly sinful divorce-case—and a company of
singers who warble sweetly the pleasant, innocent
songs of a time when the world was young and
comparatively ignorant of tights. Why this
strange combination should be no one knows;
possibly even legs pall after a time. The Jubilee
Singers have no tights to recommend them, and
there isn t even one authentic divorce-case among
the crowd. But they are among the most
melodious songsters who have ever invaded
New South Wales, and when they are comic
they fill the house with mirth, and when
they are pathetic a silent tear rolls down the
rouged countenance of the dress-circle and is
deposited as an unassuming tribute on the, bald
head of the stalls. A good part of the time they
are pathetic, and on the whole we prefer them
that way. There is a great fund of pathos in
many of their melodies, and in this world decent
pathos is even more scarce than decent comedy—
what is called pathos is mostly maunderings.
There are hardly any weak points in the company,
but Mr. Orpheus M‘Adoo, “the deepest basso
in the world,” and Miss Mattie Allen are about
the strongest. If the former is not actually the
deepest basso in the world, he is at least deep
enough to satisfy all possible requirements ; and
the latter is a gem in the realm of melody and a
tenor of marvellous melody. The Jubilee Singers
—why they are Jubilee isn’t stated—will go on at
the present address till further notice.

At a late hour on Saturday night, some o£
the first families of New South Wales went forth
secretly in a sinister-looking punt, painted black,
and, in the absence of the watchman, scuttled the
convict hulk Success, and sent her down suddenly
to the bottom of the harbour. The ominous old
relic is now in the depths of Kerosene Bay, and
all the wax convicts went down with her to leer
among the fishes, and glare with evil countenances
at the crabs. There is no published evidence
about the cause of the disaster, but The
Bulletin advances the above theory with con-
fidence. It was exceedingly rough on the
aristocracy that its grandfather should be ex-
hibited to the public as a dead monstrosity
in a cage, and it became necessary to take des-
perate measures. Therefore the uppah classes
went out disguised in the darkness, and pulling
Avith muffled oars across the waters they solemnly
dug a hole in the hated object, and with a sudden
bubbling groan it canted over and went down.
The watchman returned just as it was sinking,
but he only waited on board for a single minute,
and then he fled for Ins life. He ascribes the
trouble to the ravages of the cobra in the plank-
ing, but he is Avrong —it was the ravages of the
Legislative Council armed Avith a bis auger that
did it.

“ The Bells,” that weird spectacle of mys-
tery, visions, and madness, is the bill-of-fare this
week at Sydney Garrick. “ The Bells ”is strictly
a one-man play, and Walter Bentley, in a robust
sort of way, is that man. The plot is simple enough
—in his early life Mathias, the publican, murdered
a Hebrew among the snowdrifts, and took his
money, and cremated his body in a lime-kiln ; and
fifteen years afterwards the spectral sledge of
the deceased takes to coming along the road
on snowy nights, and the clatter of the bells
tells Mathias when it is, there. He grows
haggard and wretched, and is haunted by
dreams, and imagines that a fiend is ringing the
dinner-bell on the stairs in Hades, and at last he
has a worse dream than usual and goes mad, and
perishes barking and howling on the stage, Avhile
the orchestra, with an awful sense ot the unfitness
of things, keeps time to his delirium with the
joyous melody of the “Dutchman’s leetle daAvg.”
It is a splendidly tragic scene —that stricken man
dying in the arms of his terrified daughter and her
husband, his old white head like the head of
Terror incarnate, his shrill voice rending the air
in frantic shrieks, while the orchestra cheerfully
inquires in music, “ O vere and O vere ish mine
leetle dawg gone ?” But apart from this dis-
crepancy, Mr. Bentley is a success. His burgo-
master is a notable villain, Avith such a crafty
expression in the thousands of croAvsfeet about the
corners of his cold, scheming eye, and in the
furrows on his parchment brow. His leathern
visage is Aveather-beaten and pious looking like
one of those holy, hard-praying marauders, the
Beggars of the Sea, and the only objectionable
feature in his character is that he looks too crafty,
and iS too obviously a man with a burdened soul,
and that he shouts too fiercely at times when the
bells begin to clatter outside his door, and that he
has a strong Scotch accent and says he will put
the key in “me pawket.” Miss Laura Hansen
looks pretty and dresses nicely as the burgo-
master’s daughter. Her chief business is to fall
into Christian’s arms at intervals, and she does
it to perfection. Mr. 11. R. Roberts is Christian,
and is a beautiful young man. Mr. L. McGowan
and Mr. W. F. Clitherow play two village
tipplers, and barring the fact that the former is
distinctly Scotch at times, they arc both good.
Then we get a back-view of our dear old friend
Bill South, seen through a green glass darkly in the
burgomaster’s dream. Also, Miss Grace 1 lamilton
plays a slipshod, gushing slavey, with bare arms,
and a feeble intellect, and an irrepressible giggle,
and a tendency to read tattered, greasy, dog-
eared penny dreadfuls late at night by the
kitchen fire, and to hold candles at an acute
angle so that they gutter dreadfully on the floor ;
and apart from the sinful burgomaster himself she
is the only person in the drama who really attracts
us. The Bulletin is of opinion that her salary
ought to be trebled right off, and paid quarterly
in advance.

Mr. Larmour, in addition to booming the
Coogee Aquarium, has now opened the Sydney
Royal Standard on Saturdays and Sundays. On
Saturday afternoons a “children’s festival” is
held, which includes conjuring, music, acrobatic
Eerformanc s by the Arabs that Sells’ Circus left
ehind it, and Punch and Judy. Saturday evening
is devoted to farce and burlesque ; and the Sunday
evening alleged concerts are a humorous but
unholy device embracing singing, legerdemain,
and other show's which are calculated to bring
down fire and brimstone on a godless city.

There is little probability of Sydney
Theatre Royal being re-built. In the first place,
the ground lease has only four years to run, and,
secondly, it is improbable that the Government
Avould grant a license should the building be re-
instated. The ground landlords are understood
to be religious people and a considerable time ago
expressed their determination to demolish the
theatre directly the lease fell in. Now that the
building instead of the lease has fallen in, the
ground landlords will probably utilise the site for
another and more godly purpose.

The Sydney Royal management had con-
siderable trouble in arranging terms with Mr.
George Hill for a lease of the Criterion to finish
the Bernard-Beere season. This may be accounted
for by the fact that J. C. Williamson has been
identified with the new Lyceum, which is being
erected on the property of another branch of the
Hill family. To put matters mildly, Mr. George
Hill does not exactly approve of a new and better
house going up near his own.

“Joan of Arc” was substituted for
“ Faust Up to Date ” at Melbourne Opera House
on Saturday, without making muca apparent
difference. The people who strove to amuse in
the other burlesque repeated their attempts in
this. They accepted every encore they could get,
and when they couldn’t get it they took it just the
same. They came on singly, or in pairs, or in lots
at a time to do certain things, and they did as much
of each thing as a magnanimous public would per-
mit. On the whole, they possibly achieved a
brilliant success—any way, the performance passed
off without bloodshed, unless one of the many
chappies present happened to cut his throat for
very joy. Entertainments brighter and more
humorous than this have produced riots in
theatres ere now, whilst others even more distress-
ing have run for a long time. The Bulletin gives
“Joan of Arc ’’three weeks, although some judges
might like to give it the same number of years.
« # *
Lomieu is constantly appearing through-
out “Joan of Arc,” and he works hard on the
lines of a favourite comique who has been engaged
to do about fifteen “turns.” He comes along
once with vegetables in a barrow as Fred Leslie
did of yore, and sings another coster song. That
is to say, he takes a half-share in a coster duet,
for this burlesque introduces a brace of costers at
one fell swoop which is almost too much novelty.
Most of the plot, in fact, consists of Lonnen
bursting upon the scene in a different suit of
clothes to sing another song. Also, he dances
frequently and nimbly, and is more or less divert-
ing according to taste. Courtneidge has a satis-
factory say in the matter, and Marion Hood, in a
faint, intermittent travesty of Joan, contributes
two or three sentimental ballads. Alice Leamar
knock’s ’em again, especially with a music-hall
ditty about a girl who adopted the stage as a pro-
fession with an eye to hooking a viscount or a lord.
The one subtle joke of the show is embodied in
this item. Alice Lethbridge dances and speaks
her lines prettily, and Addie Conyers is likewise
pleasing in more than one respect. The others
seem to be overshadowed by the completeness of
the incidental arrangements. On Saturday even-
ing a floral tribute suitable for an elephant was
hoisted up from the orchestra with difficulty and
bestowed upon Alice Learner. Alice staggered
under her ghastly incubus in the first instance,
but eventually dragged it off in triumph. This
small token of esteem must have weighed about
two stone more than the Johnnie who gave the
order, and io looked an appropriate article for
dropping on his early grave by means of a crane.

At Melbourne Princess’, three indifferent
performances of “ Maritana ” were mercifully
concluded on Monday last. In contrast with the
Italian treatment of “Rigoletto” and “Lucia.”
these renderings of English opera seemed like so
many acts of cruelty, supported by a full orchestra.
The most cold-blooded offenders was His Majesty
of Spain, a gloomy, compact personage, who talked
and sang flat, and trampled upon the glorious
traditions of a fashionable theatre in an uncouth
manner. The Don Caesar of Henry Stookwell
was another depressing scion of an ancient race,
and although he might have fallen like a soldier
if they had given him the chance, he systematic-
ally failed to stand, walk, talk, or look like a
warrior, drunk or sober. Miss Baber did very
well in the name-part, Miss Ida Osborne gave
“ Alas ! those chimes ” in beautiful style, and
Alan Morris was a quietly effective Don Jose, but
this trio of satisfactory circumstances didn’t suffice
to leaven the whole lump. This week the Italian
Co. appear in “ La Sonnambula ” on Tuesday and
Friday, whilst the Foli combination concerts are
confidently expected to make the public roll up
and sit up on Thursday and Saturday.

“The Bells of Haslemere,’’ first produced
in Melbourne some three years ago, was revived
at the Royal on Saturday, A house crowded
everywhere save in the dress-circle expressed its
satisfaction so vigorously that the drama in
question should last for more than a week, any-
how. Played with a new cast and considerable
alterations in the scenic arrangements at the end
of the third act, “ The Bells of Haslemere ” is a
stronger show than before, and it was always a
gorgeously illustrated story of consecutive interest.
The four male principals present reasonable cause
for transferring themselves to America, whilst the
characters they meet on the cotton-plantation,
having no ostensible reasons for popping up in
England an act later, don t pop up, but stay in
their own country and leave their fates to the
imagination. Henry Pettit would have preferred
to bring them across the Atlantic to assist in up-
setting the villain, no doubt, but Sydney Grundy
his oollaborateur, had literary scruples in the
matter and hung on to the eternal fitness of things
for the sake of his reputation. Thus it happens
that Miss Harrie Ireland is only a passing inci-
dent in the play, although her earnest, fresh,
young presentation of the cotton planter’s daugh-
ter gives a touch of pathos to the subsequent love
passages between a girl she never sees and a man
who has forgotten her. Others of the less ex-
perienced members of this company seem to have
a future before them and to be training on in the
way they should go. The leading people are all
well displayed in the present instance, and their
artistic success in the aggregate is perhaps a little
more marked than usual. Bland Holt scores
heavily at the blacksmith’s anvil. Walter Baker
frivols rather overmuch as the festive scamp, but
his dying exclamation of “deah boy” brings a
lump into every sympathetic throat, even though
it make the gallery Goths guffaw. Kate Bishop,
Mrs. Bland Holt, Edith Blande, Albert Norman,
and Charles Glenny are ever equal to the occasion,
but there are times when the last-named might
well quicken his tempo about half a bar to the
second.

Alfred Dampier’s friends and admirers
have decided to turn the ill-luck which has
troubled him of late by presenting that old
favourite with a testimonial on the occasion of a
benefit matinee to be given in his honour next
Saturday, at Melbourne Princess’s. The bill pre-
pared for this interesting occasion is strong
enough to fill the theatre twice over; so those who
find themselves unable to secure places for the
performance are advised to book seats in the testi-
monial, as it were, and send their little cheques
along to Richard Stewart, hon. treasurer,
Princess’s Theatre. Friends at a distance will
please accept this intimation. Mr. Dampier has
not been addicted to benefits, by any means. He
recently closed his long struggle at the Alexandra
without asking the public to rally round him or
any tiling of that sort, and the fact that he deserves
a bumper testimonial can’t be too generally
recognised.

Among Mrs. Bernard Beere’s belongings
is a fine old housekeeper, who is never so happy
as when she is allowed to attend on her mistress
behind the scenes. One night Fedora had a cold,
and, as the theatre was very draughty, Mrs.
Cossit was given permission to wait at the wings
with a wrapper to put around the artist as the
curtain falls on the first act, the cue being Fedora’s
despairing cry, “ Vladimir! Dead ! ” and her
rush through the folding doors into the bedroom.
“You will know when to come, Mrs. Cossit?”
quoth Fedora. “Oh, yes, mum,” smilingly, “I
know exactly. It’s when you gives a rush, and
shrieks out ‘ Blanky near dead.’” And now
Fedora wonders how many of her audience hear
their favourite adjective in her exclamation.

The proprietorial history of Sydney
Theatre Royal is as follows : —Fitzgerald’s trustees
granted a 2i years’ building lease at a peppercorn
rent to Levy and Barnett, who built the Royal.
Levy and Barnett mortgaged to the Bank of New
South Wales, and eventually parted with the pro-
perty. Wilshire bought from the Bank, and sub-
let to Lazar at .£56 per week. Lazar sub let again
to Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove at <£9o per
week. Wilshire died, and his widow married
“ Ranny ” Want; consequently Mr. Want is
owner of the ground-lease, while Mrs. Moss
(Lazar’s sister) is simply tenant of the building.

Lonnen complains that Fred Leslie abstracted
“ Killaloo” and “The Bogey Man” from his (Lonnen s)
repertoire and used them in Melbourne. The particular
humour of this complaint (and all charges of plagiarism
are humorous in a perfeshun where all hands steal one
another’s business) lies in the fact that Lonnen’s coster-
song in “Faust Up to Date” was taken from a music-hall
original. Harry Rickards introduces the same song from
the same source.

Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent The Fringe
of Society ” proved a most milk and watery affair, and
might have been hissed off the first night but tor powerful
acting at a critical point by Wyndham himself. The
Langtry wore some wonderful frocks, but even her
resplendent attire failed to make her Mrs. Eve Allen a
success—though she made the best of her part. The
author had made her altogether too respectable, and this
disappointed the audience. Mrs. Eve Allen is a bad 'un,
no doubt, but there isn’t any spice about her like the
Suzanne of Dumas. Now-a-days, no well-arranged play is
complete without something Australian in it, conse-
quently the author introduces us to Mr. Arthur Cuthbert,
who has returned with a portmanteau full of wealth in
the shape of scrip. This is the man who gets into the
toils of the wicked Mrs. Eve Allen and wants very badly
to marry her, and would have done so, no doubt, but for
Sir Charles Hartley, a president of the Royal Academy,
who was once also in love with the lady hut fought shy of
her when he learned her deadly secret, which he uses in
a mean kind of way to break off her match with the
Horsetralian —this secret being that she, when a
married woman, had fled from her husband with a
lover, and had consequently been put through the mill
by Sir James Hannen and George Lewis. At present the
name of the author of this poor play is kept a profound
secret. Some associate the name of VV. S. Gilbert with it,
hut surely he could never have written anything so bad.

We were thinking of Majeroni’s gentility—odious, but

for prohibition instead of regulation, she is utterly
wasting her labour. She might as well cry for a

Clarissa Stringer, of Melbourne, has leapt
into fame as the enterprising female who implored
two bailiffs with tears in her eyes to give her
half-an-hour in which to “get some assistance

minutes at the head of 250 unemployed who
chased the bailiffs off the premises and then carted
Clarissa’s furniture to a safe distance, after which
they bombarded the home of the landlord’s agent
with half bricks, and ploughed his front garden
with his iron fence. The police “ quelled the
revolution ” by arresting a small boy named
Moss.
One J. Hewlett Ross writes to the
Australasian :
Friday, the 24th. inst., is the anniversary of the death
of A. L.’Gordon, and, with your permission, I would like
to say to lovers of the poet that I purpose on the follow-
ing Saturday, the 25th. inst., placing upon his grave in
the Brighton Cemetery a wreath of English wild flowers,
which I have brought from England at the special request
of the lady who was, perhaps, the direct cause of Gordon
leaving England as and when he did. Knowing that I
was returning to Melbourne, she gathered and arranged a
wreath of English wild flowers, and asked me to place
them on the grave of one whose memory is still dear to
her, the sweet incense of dear dead days. I will be glad
to meet at the grave, about three in the afternoon, any
admirers of the poet who can he present. There will be
no formal ceremony, but a simple gathering round a
poet’s grave to fulfil the wishes of one he loved.
Only a little simple gathering, the spontaneous
outburst (previously announced in the papers) of
a poetic soul. Only a few faded flowers, and 10 or
12 hulking individuals standing around and
wondering what they came for, and a lonely grave,
and a lop-sided wreath awkwardly jammed on the
tombstone by a big man as he shivers in the winter
blast. And then the ornament will break up as
Hewlett tries to shove it, after the fashion of a
hangman’s knot, over the monument, and he will
probably stand with the ruins in his hand and say
briefly: “This thing’s bust.” And none of the
ten or twelve will have ever seen Gordon, and
very few will have even read him, and all of them
will wonder who Howlett is, and they will all
have a vague idea that there will be a speech, or a
hymn, or some refreshments, or something, and
there won't be anything except the wreath, and a
goat will eat it after they are gone.
Daniel and Thomas Fitzgerald, who are
both natives of Australian soil, have gjod reason
to congratulate themselves upon the ret.alt of their
labours in the very arduous task of placing a pre-
sentable circus exhibition before the public.
Hurry-sknrry-come-qmckly-and-rush-away Ameri-
can catch-penny circuses have “boomed” on the
credulous Australian public and have skipped out
before there was time to properly judge of their
true merits. These tactics were pre-conceived on
the part of those hop-skip-and-jump proprietors
who, however, reckon without their host. The
Fitzgerald Bros.’ circus has come forward as a
genuine revelation of what can be done in an Aus-
tralian arena, and what an Australian equine
manager can do with his horse-flesh. The
Brothers, between them, have run their show upon
amicable arrangements to all parties concerned, and
do not wish to see themselves “left ” in the game
of speculation. “ Dan ” Fitzgerald is 32 years old
and “Tom” 27—good ages for men to be
involved in a risky enterprise, which the
circus business undoubtedly is. They are both
natives of Shellharbour, in the Illawarra district,
a seaport haven which has been the natal locality
of some worthy Australian youths. Naturally,
they look for some recognition from their com-
patriots, therefore it is in no boastful or vaunting
spirit that they submit that their circus is all they
profess it to be, and if they humbly obtrude or re-
iterate the fact that they and all pertaining to
their entourage are Australian, they do so from a
laudable view and hope for encouragement to sup-
port them in their endeavours. They have had
their ups and downs in all conscience, and met
■with disaster in flood and field, but with that
indomitable pluck and energy, ever present in the
native, have come up smiling and conquered un-
toward fate and fortune. Brother “Tom ”is a
vocalist of no mean order, and on one occasion
when the show came to Sydney from the back-
blocks he was engaged at that city for the Sunday
night concerts held in the Criterion Theatre.
The money he received for his professional services
went towards the support of Brother “ Dan ”
and the ponies. Dan was by no means idle
in the interim, as he was busy breaking in trick
horses to be ready for the show when it started
out on the road again. In due course the provinces
were visited, the business done, especially in
Western Australia, being highly gratifying.
Their stable now numbers 70 ponies, all of them
being trained to a degree of excellence, unsur-
passed by any other circus which has toured
Australia. The Bronco horses particularly are
examples of the training abilities and patience
possessed by Mr. Dan Fitzgerald, they having
Been brought to the utmost state of perfec-
tion. Fifty people are engaged in the show,
which goes to prove that the brothers do not
proffer a half-and-half concern to their patrons.
In conclusion, the wish may be expressed that
Messrs. Fitzgerald Brothers will continue to
prosper in their undertaking, for they have un-
doubtedly proved that they have done all that was
possible towards deserving success.

be relied on and to drinkers of this pleasant stimu-
lant, we can confidently recommend ‘Usher’s’

The success of Pulvermacher's System of Self-Applicable Medico-Galvanism, so deservedly obtained during the last 25 years, has prompted a host of envious
speculators to bring out a variety of Appliances (under various enticing denominations), all pretendedly possessing, at a cheap price*, Electric or Magnetic
qualities, and thus professing to compete with PulverniacherV Galvanic Appliances, when, in reality, there is no analogy, nor have they anything in comm n;
thereby entrapping that portion of the public who are easily influenced by cheapness. The pecuniary injury thus inflicted on the patient is far exceeded by that
resulting from the erroneous belief that when trying these so-called Galvanic pplianoes he has tried Electricity in vain, and been thereby diverted from using the
only genuine and effective Self-applicable Electric Remedy, furnished by Pulvermacher’s Patent Galvanic Chain Bands. Belts and Batteries.

The Opposition in the Queensland Parlia-

A Griffilwraithiau Bill that tampers with

When Graham Berry swept Yictoria with

the disease of usury, that leaves no man free who

Ash, M.L.A., has the reputation of being
the most industrious and conscientious member of
S.A. Assembly. He reads through every Bill
submitted to the House and seldom misses a

meeting at East Wellington, and then the greedy
audience passed a resolution asking him to go on

The real question which the enquirer into
the free silver coinage problem must first answer to
his own satisfaction is whether America should
prefer an extension of her relations with external
nations or a development of local resources while
other countries are ignored. Foreign-trade can

but as far as a home-trade is concerned even a
purely paper currency is sufficient.
W. E. Abbott points out that organizer

In 1884 “ the King country ” (Maori) was

task of sowing the seeds of death among the re-
mainder of the Maori population.
If the Dibbs-Barton Ministry wish to share
with their predecessors the odium of bolstering up
the vampire system of building-society financing,
they will not repeal in the coming session the
Companies’Arrangement Act they rushed through
both Houses in a stupid panic last session. Vic-
toria is bent upon repealing the measure which
suggested the N.S.W. Act, and N.S.W. has
infinitely more reason for following the Southern
province’s example in destroying, than it has for
enacting.
Deakin, having learnt that whites cannot
cope with the summer heats of tropical Australia,
advocates Hindu—not Kanaka—labour, his Indian
experience teaching “that the coolie is cheap,
docile, accustomed to white control, and home-
control, and only accepts employment abroad in
order to earn enough to live comfortably in bis
own village. The coolie would be protected by
joint Indian and Australian legislation.” Another
prophet has arisen ! Kanakilgriff, we know. Be-

Surely Parkes’ sudden decease may shortly

Parkes ! His boiler will burst!
At the election for North Bundaberg (Q.),
the Kanaka stronghold just carried by Hall, the
Labour candidate, the Labour crowd used to roll
up in force at each of the opposition candidate’s
meetings and yell themselves hoarse in his favour.
They likewise carried motions of confidence
unanimously, and ejected malcontents and
enthused to such an extent that each candidate
believed himself “a moral certainty.” The split
was thus kept up, and on polling day, the good,
guileless proletaire went down to the booth and
vote 1 straight as a die for his own man—and got
him in.
What does the secresy of the ballot amount
to when —as not unfrequently happens in the out-
lying districts of N.S.W, and Queensland—a
polling-booth is opened upon a station with the
owner or manager as returning-officer? When
that official counts the votes, he gets a good,
reliable knowledge of how each man voted, and
then—without in any way interfering with teh
secresy of the ballot—he can promptly sack every
man who didn’t support his candidate. Also, if
the scrutineer is manager of an adjacent station,
he goes and does likewise. The ballot is a great
institution when it is worked properly.

contains the bowels, of which ther are five :

The grand old flag of the British 55th
Regiment, which went amissing nearly 100 years
ago, has been found in a pawnshop, the descendant

national uncle in just the same fashion.
At Bendigo, last week, Judge Williams
went through the hollow mockery of sentencing a
couple of men to death. The first condemned
felon was found guilty of wounding with intent to
murder, and the other man was found guilty of
shooting with intent to kill, the bullets having
stopped short in some bags of groceries that the
“ victim ” carried on his back. In each case the
culprit’s soul was recommended to the Lord for
mercy, although the Lord knew, and the judge
knew the Lord knew that the sentence of death
wouldn’t be put in force. How much longer will
Australia tolerate the existing custom of threaten-
ing to hang (a threat sometimes carried into effect)
alleged would-be murderers for murders that
didn’t occur ? It isn’t Mosaic law, or even
Hinglish law, but simply a remnant of the old,
hideous lag-law, which serves to remind intelligent
natives of the debt they owe to the dear old
Mother Country.
What People Say.
“ Truth is stranger than Fiction,” so people say,
but such truth as we received from T. Channon,
Esq., Photographer, Nowra, N.S.W,, is only a
sample of what comes to hand by every mail from
all parts of Australia. Mr. Channon speaks for
himself : “ I was one of the first attacked bv La
Grippe at Nowra. The symptoms sneezing,
running at nose, weak, watery eyes, frontal head-
ache, as if the brain wanted to press through, the
pain was almost constant, restless sleep, poor
appetite, constipation, foul tongue, constant
expectoration of yellow greenish phlegm, burning
prickling feeling in the chest, great weakness and
pain at the nape of the neck, water—dark brown.
I tried to rise but was too weak, and had to lie
down again. Whilst at the worst, I read of the
curative properties of Clements Tonic, and was
induced to try it, although sceptical about advei'-
tised remedies; after a few doses I certainly felt
better, so much that I wrote you, asking advice,
which you promptly afforded me. I stated my
case and you said it was a severe grip, and recom-
mended a continued course of Clements Tonic. I
followed your advice, and commenced to mend
rapidly and am now entirely recovered. I only
took four bottles, but am continuing it, so as to
thoroughly re-establish my strength (wise man !)
I can recommend it with the greatest con-
fidence for weak and delicate people. Mrs.
Frances Rayner, Oxford-street, Paddington,
N.S.W., also writes, “I have suffered for many
years from dyspepsia and general debility, and
was induced to try Clements Tonic. I have taken
several bottles with such marked success, that I
have every confidence in recommending it to my
friends.” We must again warn the suffering
portion of humanity to be particularly careful that
the packages of Clements Tonic are unbroken and
intact. Several cases have come under our notice
where unscrupulous men have interfered with the
contents of the bottles, and we now place a
guarantee label over every package, refuse all
where this is broken.—F. M. Clements, Melbourne
and Sydney.

miles each way to attend the sittings of the House.
Lord Deerhurst (our “ Beerthirst ”) is
about to publish a book of adventure in South
Africa. It is not said who wrote it. Beerhurst,
it is expected, will “go for ” Randolph Churchill,
and some spicy extracts from his journal respect-
ing the hero of the lions have appeared in the
daily papers by way of an advance ad. of the
book.
Mrs. Throsby, of Moss Vale (N.S.W.), an
old lady now near her 90th year, is the last sur-

(M.L.) in 1809. She and three others saved from
the massacre were rescued by old Alexander
Berry, of Shoalhaven (N.S.W ), who adroitly
induced the Maoris to liberate them from the
slavery to which they had been doomed.

These is a spectre in Cromwell House, the
lamented Beaney’s residence in Collins-street,
Melbourne. Beaney’s ghost, so it is averred,
haunts the place at night, and its new tenant, Hr.
O’Hara, is harassed by a cold damp form that
comes along at midnight and proceeds to fill the
bath with invisible water. Evidently the dweller
on the threshold is a clean ghost and washes
regularly.
The well-known English poet and critic,
Andrew Lang, thinks “The Ace, from Snowy
River,” which appeared in The Bulletin’s last
Xmas issue, equal to anything by Whyte Mel vide.
However, Mr. Lang appears to be under the im-
pression that “ The Ace ” was written by the late
Barcroft Boake. This is not so : the author is
“The Banjo,” a well-known young Sydney pro-
fessional man.
Nehemiah Bartley is about to publish a
book reminiscent of 40 years of Que nsd.uid— and
dating back to the days of Geoff.- y Hamlyn and
Hargreaves, the gold - discoverer. Neliemtah,
mounted on the famous Rosin ante, is a wdl-
known figure amongst old Queenslanders. _ lie has
“ cacoethes scrib nidi ’’ pretty bad, and it is a cold
day in Brisbane when a letter from him doei not
appear in one or other of the dailies.
Baronet Clarke (says our London corres-
pondent) does not seem to be much sought after
in society this trip. It has leaked out somehow
that he is not quite so rich as he was, and tins
makes an enormous difference in England. He is
generally to be found after dinner in theismoking-
room of the Alexandra, and it is quite pathetic to
see the delight with which Re greets any stray
Australian acquaintance who may drop in. Ihe
poor fellow is quite out of his element away from
Collinsstreet.
R. C. Shearman, ex-police superintendent,
was before Wellington (M.L.) Bankruptcy Court,
the other day. Sir James Prendergast,
K.C.M.G., Chief Justice, Acting Governor, <fec.,
presided. Shearman lost in business his big retir-
ing allowance as'senior-inspector of police. Back
in the fifties, in Maryborough, Vic., a loafer was
being prosecuted. The prosecuting inspector was
named Shearman, resplendent in uniform and
authority. A mild young clerk taking the
depositions was named Prendergast. Clerk and
inspector met again as above.
It is said that Parkes in his forthcoming
“Reminiscences” makes a savage assault on
Thomas Holt, the first N.S.W. Colonial Treasurer
under Constitutional Government. If he does,
the whole story of his feud with Holt will come
out. In his “Murmurs of the Stream,” Parkes
in a footnote, referred to Holt as “ a gentleman
entirely unknown to political life, remarkable for
his crude opinions and infirmities of temper, but
possessing no single qualification for the successful
conduct of public affairs.” The truth was that
Holt was an able but pragmatical man,
A paragraph in Boston (IJ.S.) Sunday
Herald describes the much (self)-advertised A.
G. Hales (“ Smiler ”) as “ a distinguished Austra-
lian journalist, . . . the most widely-known
newspaper man in that distant part of the
earth. . . He is popularly known as the Aus-
tralian Bret Harte. . . He is the Australian
Stanley and Archibald Forbes in one.”' We have
had much reverence for that modest young man
ever since his portrait (representing him in a
velvet coat and Bed ford-cord breeches) was sent to
this office, by some friend of his, for reproduction
on some flimsy pretext or other.
Alfred Deakin is working hard as a plain
bread-and-cheese barrister in Melbourne law-
courts. The voice that used to thunder forth
anathemas at the enemies of Federation and
paint gorgeous word-pictures of the sullen wilder-
ness converted into smiling orchards by the magic
wand of the Water Fairy may now be heard
craving mercy for the trembling penitent who
annexed a pair of boots to feed his starving wife,
or demanding justice for the persecuted Christian
arrested with a crowbar on his person in the back
yard whither he had retired with a view to en-
gaging in silent prayer.
M‘llwraith is a familiar figure in the stalls
of Brisbane Opera House, and when he stalks
heavily in the gods rise as one god and greet him
with a perfect storm of execration. Apparently
he rather enjoys it; whatever his faults may be
the fat, apoplectic Thomas has the pluck of a bag
of devils, and he likes to sit there and hear the
gallery cursing in impotent fury. Griffith do- sn't
visit the theatres much, and when lie does he
keeps out of sight and looks sad and apprehensive.
He belongs to the order of thin, pallid men who
want to run, while his Treasurer is one of the
bulky, red-faced men who always want to stay
and fight.
Some men never die. A week or two ago
the Maori landers were astonished to find old ex-
Fremier Forsaith—he of the Clean Shirt Ministry
—wandering loose about their country, after
having vanished for so many years that he was
generally supposed to be among the ghosts of
ancient history. Forsaith was a merchant, and
was a statesman for 47 hours only. When
the Governor “ sent for 1 ’ him he put on a clean
shirt and went forth and formed a Cabinet. Two
days later the Cabinet burst, and then Forsaith
put on another clean shirt and retired into private
life. He afterwards abandoned trade, and is now
a parson at 'Parramatta (N.S.W.).
“Augur” Chapman, the late sporting
editor of the Australasian, was renowned for his
bad tipping, and yet it was a marvellous tipping
hit that lifted him from the Weekly Times to the
Australasian ; but his constitution was broken
of yore, by working double tides as compositor
and tout. “The ardent young sportsman,” we
read, “used to work until the early hours of the
morning at ‘case,’ and then he would set off on
foot for the training-grounds, where he watched
the doings of the horses, wrote his notes, and
turned up cheerfully again in the even ng in the
composing-room !” There is no eight-hours for
the man who would work himself out of the ruck.
Nobody who ever heard Judge Docker
(N.S.W.) on the bench or in the Anglican Synod,
would give him credit for thinking, much less ex-
pressing, a poetic thought. Yet Henry Kendall
used to quote, with intense appreciation, the con-
cluding lines of the legal versifier’s sonnet to
George Macdonald:
(Words of an unknown tongue and region far),
I lay them at thy feet, their source confessed,
As some dark pool returns with trembling breast
Its broken lights under their parent star.
Six N.S.W. Judges have published poetic screeds
—Barron Field, Stephen (Sir Alfred), Martin,
Francis, Cary, and Docker, and “ Water-Jug '
Foster is strongly suspected of writing a Sunday-
school hymn.
Jemmy Carroll, a half-caste M.P., lias just
been appointed a member of the M.L. Executive,
and is the first person of mixed breed to attain
Cabinet rank. The Honourable Jemmy is remark-
ably handsome, even for a half-caste Maori, and
is a finished orator in both English and Maori.
Before his election to Parliament as member for
one ot the native electorates lie tvas an interpreter
to the House of Representatives. The last native
member of a Maoriland Executive was the Hon.
Hone Nairn (John Nash), who was a make-weight
in Grey’s Administration. Hone had been “caught
young ” by the missionaries, and many a time has
the present writer observed him marching to
church on Sunday with a big “ book-a-book ”
under one arm and his highly-polished boots
under the other. Hone had not mastered the
graces of civilisation sufficiently to appreciate the
value of boots, except for ceremonial purposes.
Some years ago King Tawhiao, who has
permitted himself to be added tu the list of
monarchs retired from the business, in considera-
tion of a pension of <£2so —proceeded to England
for the purpose of laying some grievances
before his great white sister, Kuine Wikitoria
—who said she was unable to see him, though,
scandalous to relate, during the period of his
stay, she contrived to give audience to certain
African niggers who had brought her over
some monkeys as a present. Tawhiao lived,
while in London, at a swell Belgraviau boarding-
house, the proprietress of which, without asking
her tattooed boarder's consent, invited a more or
less distinguished company to meet—so the in-
vitation-card stated —H.R.H. Tawhiao, King of
the Maoris. The old potentate, resenting this
attempt to make a show of him, locked himself up
in his own apartment. The boarding-house
keeper, a lady of much ton , made some
plausible excuse to her disappointed guests, and
the gaieties of the evening were proceeded with.
At about 2 a.m., just before the party broke up,
the old monarch strode into the ball-room, clad
only in a very short shirt, and said to the horrified
hostess: “ Why you no leave match in my
cand’stick ? ” and, having borrowed a few fusees
from Pressman Rathbone (who was present and
who relates the story with much dramatic effect),
solemnly marched off again.
An extremely old woman has just been
sentenced at Orange (N.S. W.) to five years
gaol for arson. She and her husband quar-
relled and'separated 18 years ago, and after
lying quiet all that time the ancient lady suddenly
demanded the furniture of the house her hus-
band lived in, evidently thinking that bare boards
were good enough for the patriarch in his latter
years. Being refused, she announced that she
would “make dust of the old man,” and one night
she tottered round and combusted the cottage, and
went away with a senile cackle as she pictured her
venerable relative with his hair on fire among the
ruins. As it happened, however, the intended
victim simply opened the door and walked out— to
the police-station. The footprints on the damp
ground gave the aged incendiary away, and the
police followed these tracks till they led to her
cottage where she was chuckling dismally beside
an expiring fire;
Even in the early days—as early as ISbO—
there were no fewer than fil applications for a
vacant N.S.W. clerkship—in the Australian
Agricultural Company. The successful candidate,
still living at the advanced age of 83, with health
and faculties unimpaired, is the father of Hon.
11. H. D. White, M.L.C. Born in Ceylon, of an
English father and a Dutch mother, he came from
that island in the same ship with Riddell, Colonial
Secretary. Walking down Pitt-street on the day
of his arrival, he went into the shop of Tawell,
the pious and amorous chemist (the first man
hanged by the agency of the electric telegraph),
who obliged him with the loan of the newspaper
advertising the vacancy, and with the use of pen,
ink, and paper, in a little room at the back of the
shop. A day or two after, William Barton,
accountant to the company, and father of the
present N.S.W. Attorney-General, came down
from Port Stephens, the head quarters of the
company, to see White, who had continued to
lodge on board the vessel after its arrival, and
informed him of his appointment to the vacant
clerkship on account of his recommendations.

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cnp of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co,Cascade,”
80 and 82 Elizabeth street, near King-street, is
just the place ; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

Society
Various Sydney society girls are each try-
ing to outcry the other over poor little Lord
Ancram’s death. The number of them that he
would have married had he lived is amazing. As
a matter of fact, he was not engaged to any of
them, and his uncle, the Admiral, gave it out
distinctly that he “ would not be allowed to
marry out here.”
* * *
This message was telephoned recently from
Government House, Adelaide, to tho sub editor
of one of the local dailies; —“His Excellency
tlu Admiral desires that in paragraphs referring
to him he should be described either as His Excel-
lency the Admiral or His Excellency Lord Charles
Scott, but not as Admiral Scott or Admiral Lord
Charles Scott.” He is only a vice-admiral, too !
Australia is getting very sick of Ad. Scott.
* * *
Amongst the names of the Ladies’ Grand
Council of the English Primrose League, for this
year, appears that of Mrs. E. Ross-Fairfax, late
of Sydney (don’t forget the hyphen). I won-
der, remarks a Bulletin London correspondent,
how much it cost “ Mister Edward ” to achieve
this honor for his wife. One doesn’t rub shoulders
with Duchesses for nothing, you know. Another
of the Grand Councillors is Mrs. Panmure-Gordon,
who is a daughter of Mr. Hall, formerly of the
firm of Hall and Alderson, tanners, Sydney,
where Mrs. Panmure-Gordon was born. Austra-
lians are coming on. Panmure-Gordon is a stock-
broker, and is reputed to have made nearly a
million sterling out of the promotion of brewery-
companies when the last “ boom ” was on. He
has a house in Carlton Terrace where his wife
entertains largely, principally Jews and city men.
The aristocracy will follow. By the way, Mr.
Robert Lucas-Tanglefoot-Tooth, brewer, of Syd-

Miss Fanny Campbell, daughter of James
Campbell, M.L.A. (Vic.), is one more well-mean-
ing crank who is going on the road to China to
convert the oily Mongol. If that lady wants a
little exercise before she starts, The Bulletin
would suggest that she should take in the old,
wicked-looking Chow who comes round to her
own back-door with cabbagee, and adopt him as a
son, and convert him if she can. And if she can’t
convert one Chinaman when she has him all to
herself, she may as well give up the idea of turn-
ing herself loose upon 300,000,000 or so of them,
and trying to save them in a heap.

The case of Barton v. Purves, Q.C., for
restitution of the golden kid, will soon be cropping
up again in a Melbourne law-court. Meanwhile,
a dozen step-fathers of children not more distantly
related to Purves than is the heiress, Kathleen
(who doesn’t seem to be a blood relation in any
degree) are vainly imploring that legal luminary
to carry the little darlings off. A mistaken im-
pression that Purves is an enthusiastic orphan-
collector has got abroad. Men knock at his
front door and press him to accept of impecunious
twins with neglected noses; also, lone widows
endeavour to load him up with their cross eyed
nephews, and the other morning his garden was
invaded by a carroty-headed spinster of tender
years who flopped herself upon a flower-bed and
said she’d come to be adopted by the kind gentle-
man. All of which is very trying for poor Purves.
He is not naturally a Q.C. who takes a burning
interest in other people’s offspring, but he annexed
the seventy-thousand-pounder, Kathleen, because
somebody had made that infant a ward i f Court,
and Purves represents a doosid large percentage of

Melbourne evening papers are quite en-

nation of the unemployed. The Standard,
gushing about their good behaviour at the new
Labour Bureau, sweetly remarked, “it would do
your heart good to see them.” Awfully nice, don’t
you know!
Here is a queer love-story. Twelve years
ago an intelligent young fellow of 19 entered an
Australian University under the following cir-
cumstances. As a boy he had shown much talent,
and his father, a wealthy, unlettered storekeeper,
decided to make a scholar of him. But the young
man had become enamoured of the family servant
and wished to marry her at once. To this his
father strongly objected, but, finding that opposi-
tion had but little effect upon his son’s resolution,
he effected a compromise : he would consent to
the marriage and give half his fortune to his son,
provided the latter succeeded in gaining the
LL.B. degree. The youth entered upon his
University studies with the greatest ardour, and
in due course obtained his 8.A., and but two
more years’ study was necessary for the L.L.B.
In the second year of his law-reading the object
of his passions, to whom he was still devotedly
attached, married a farmer. The jilted student
fell into a profound melancholy. When this
passed away it left him a monomaniac
with a passion for acquiring degrees. In
this new passion he forgot his girl and her
treachery. lie gained the LL.B. and then set
about becoming Bachelor of Science, which degree
he attained. Then he turned his attention to the
engineering and medical schools and (he was now
8.A., M.A., LL.B., and B.Se.) he saw with
gloomy joy new courses to be conquered, new
degrees to be won. He plodded sturdily through
the engineering course, and at the end of three
more years had the satisfaction of adding B.E. to
his already too-extensive signature. His father
then died and left him in the sole possession of
his wealth, which gave him satisfaction only as a
means whereby he could gain such degrees as
were not conferred at his Alma Mater. He had
still to graduate in Medicine. In the first year of
this course his poor, over-worked mind collapsed.
He became an imbecile with one main delusion
and many minor ones, among which latter was the
idea that he had lost one of his numerous degrees,
lie sought it continually. He was known to have
spent a whole day glaring through a microscope at
some germ-cultures, among which, he averred, his
degree must have dropped. His friends kept him
away from the University in hopes of a recovery,
whereupon he began to haunt the Public Library
and for weeks assiduously studied London Punch.
Then he died.

Says G. R. Sims re the scandalous climax
.to the pearl robbery case —“It is not the release
of Mrs. Osborne on the ground of humanity that
is in itself objectionable. It is the fact that the
‘ humanity ’ has not been extended to a woman on
the ground of her womanhood, but to a lady on
the ground of her ladyhood.”
The other day the Brisbane
police arrested a lady with one
meat leg and one wooden
extremity, on a charge of
drunkenness. She was taken to
the lockup in a cab, and on the
way the wooden leg, in some
absolutely unaccountable man-
ner, was lost, and was never
found again. Next morning she
tried to hop into court on one
light, fantastic toe, but she
broke down on the road, and
it being explained that she
had foundered in one of the
corridors and couldn’t get any
further, the bench discharged
her. This was either an act of
kindness or a mean shirking of
-responsibility —it looks very
like the latter. If she had
been brought into court and
then discharged, the bench
would have had to take some
steps in the matter of the lost
leg, for it couldn’t, in common
decency, see a lady quit the
premises on her hands. As it
was however, the magistrate
simply left her on the floor in a
cold passage somewhere, and
the man who would abandon
any female even a drunken
one—in such a strait is deserving
of the reproach of the entire
community.

The Victorian Customs people have hit on
a new device for preventing the free entry of
Chinamen on borrowed naturalisation papers. A
Chow who wants to go home and visit the graves
of his ancestors is required to leave behind him in
Melbourne a copy of the photo, attached to his
papers, so that he may be identified on his return.
The efficacy of this check must be apparent to
anyone who tries to tell the difference between
two “Johns” in the flesh. When you come to
take their photos, you find that either is sufficient
to sit for both. In fact, the portraits left at the
Customs are simp’y so many different views of the
same old Chow who dees duty for the entire tribe.
The machine can’t lie, as we are all aware, but it
can’t tell which Chinaman isn’t another one.

The story of how a couple of Melbourne
pressman played the fool with Lily Dampier’s

ponderous young ornament of the drama was
spreading himself out in a restaurant when the
two wags planned their little joke. One of them,
apologising for his temerity in accosting a gentle-
man of such eminence in the purfesh, begged leave
to introduce Mr. “ Watkin Wynne ” to his friend,
a theatrical manager in quest of stars for a pro-
vincial tour. Thereupon the alleged manager
poured out the wildest rot he could string
together and explained that the dream of his life
was to obtain Wynne on a long engagement —at
17s. Gd. per week. Wynne waved his hand scorn-
fully—“l perceive that you are one of those
vampires who suck the blood and brains of un-
fortunate actors,” said he. Then a brilliant idea
occurred to the unsuspecting butt. He would
expose the ignorance of this theatrical manager,
this miserable impostor, by asking him to name,
right there on the spot, the ’birthplace of Shakes-
peare. “Where was Shakespeare born ? ” “ Why,
at Ballarat?” roared the vampire. “Now I know
you to bo an ignorant fellow,” snorted Wynne,
and, folding his arms on his manly breast, the
indignant actor withdrew.

Two hundred and fifty divorces effected in

During the hearing of a divorce-case in

—men, only a few more left! ” after which he
would break into poetry. Sims, in a yarn, evolved
Simpson and his soap and poetry out of bis

Wc sing a sad and simple song
(Behind the office screen)
Concerning nymphs who see no wrong
In anything “ obscene ”
A song that brings a burning blush
To every poet’s face ;
No sympathetic baid would crush
T'io hopes of little dears who rush
To hear a spicy case.
It was the court where judges wise
Unloose the bridal knot —
Win re dimpled Cupid sits and sighs
And shakes bis bond a lot—
Fair women to that calm, retreat
Came flouncing up in force,
For when they want a real treat
There’s nothing in the world to beat
A fairly “ hot ” divorce.
They listened to the tale of sin
With interest intense,
Expecting soon to revel in
“ Disgusting evidence ; ”
Each eye beneath a drooping lid
To sparkle then began ;
Each band in neatly-fitting kid
Wiis slowly raised —“They never did—
He was a shocking man !”
At length His Honor cast around
A solemn, stony glare,
It made him shudder when lie found
Those lovely visions there ;
He saw their nostrils all expand,
He saw their bosoms heave.
He feared the happy angel band
Might suffer in their morals, and
He thought they ought to leave.
A muffled cry of blank dismay
The silence grim awoke ;
Their faces turned an ashen grey,
They couldn’t see the joke
To leave ! when they had just begun
To glory in the sport!
They felt that men have all the fun,
And groaning softly one by one,
They tottered out of court.
How long, how long shall woman cry
To Heaven for her “ rights,”
Whilst fellers wink the other eye
And wallow in delights ?
How long, how long shall matrons dear
And maidens, bless their hearts !
From courts of law be told to clear
As soon as they are getting near
The very naughty parts?
S. M. J. Woods.
S. M. J. Woods - more concisely and popularly known as
“Sammy Woods”—is an example of the nascitur non fit
athlete. Whatever game or sport he puts his hand to, he
becomes proficient at, and he is the only instance I can
call to mind of a man, who has greatly distinguished him-
self at cricket and both kinds of football. He stands six
feet in his socks, weighs fourteen stone, and has excep-
tionally powerful hips and legs, which have no doubt
stood him in good stead in his wear-and-tear style of
bowling. But though his limbs are large, they are not
muscle-bound, as is the case with so many men of striking
physique, and it is undoubtedly elasticity combined with
power which has enabled him to excel in so many fields of
sport.
He was born 24 years ago at Glentield, near Sydney,
N.S.W., son of Mr. John Woods, J.P., of Fanlight, Manly.
In 1884 he came to England and Brighton College,
where he \ ery soon demonstrated his physical capabili-
ties. In the two following years he represented his
school in cricket, football, and fives, and Sussex—his
academic county—in football. Since 1886 he has played
cricket and football for Somersetshire. In 1888 we find
him pursuing his scholastic career as an undergraduate at
Jesus College, Cambridge, at that time a veritable beehive
of athletes. Here in the company of such congenial spirits
as Macgregor, Martin and Mason Scott and Percy Illing-
worth, he contrived to spare sufficient time from his
books to make for himself a reputation as one of the best
all-round athletes that either university has ever turned
out. For four years he represented Cambridge in cricket
and in Eugby football, and it is no exaggeration to say
that, while he was up, the 'Varsity cricket match was
practically a certainty for his side. As a bowler he
possesses any amount of pace and “devil,” and once in
an intercollege match he won the game by bowling seven
wickets for four runs. As a batsman he plays a very
similar game to Lohmann, and if he gets set can rattle up
a score in no time.
For the last throe years he has been one of the most
brilliant forwards in the English fifteen. When on his
mettle and a dry ground, he is as dangerous as any player
of the day in the open. He is fast and powerful, dribbles
at great speed, utilising his Association experience, is
unequalled as a tackier, and a fine place and drop-kick.
The one flaw in his play is that he does not do sufficient
work in the scrimmage—a great pity seeing how useful
a man of his weight and strength ought to he there.
At the Association game he has played for Somerset-
shire in every position of the field, and was in the Jesus
College team which won the Inter-Collegiate Cup tie.
Recently he has taken up golf, and though but a novice,
a few weeks ago won the Burnham monthly gold medal,
astonishing his competitors by some wonderful strokes;
and if he sticks to it will, I am 1 old, become one of the
best golfers in England. His favourite hobby is
cricket and he will tell you that lie is never so happy as
when playing it, but any sort of sport “ has a charm ” for
him. . . , .
At present he lives at Wilstonia, m Somersetshire,
and under the supervision ef Fionde Hancock, an old
International forward, devotes his time to ti e study of
brewing beer, riding, shooting, and following Hi beagles.
Woods has gained the unique distinction of wearing both
the Corinthian and Barbarian caps.

Messrs. Braham and Mutch, of King-
street, Sydney, have notified us that they have
just purchased from the Cellular Clothing
Company the whole of their stock in Australia at
50 per cent, below English invoice, comprising
about 350 doz. singlets and underpants suitable
for winter wear. These goods are well and
favourably known in Europe, although somewhat
new to Australia, and arc strongly recommended
by eminent medical men. They are now on sale
at ridiculously low prices and a sample suit can
be sent through the post on application.
A large and influential gathering of city
gentlemen met one day this week at the Syd-
ney offices of the Volcanic JEration Company,
to witness the new process ot making rerated
waters. . The system, which bids lair to revolu-
tionise the old method, was explained and illus-
trated bv Mr. Wheeler, who holds the patent
rights for N.S.W., and, by its simplicity and
economy, commended itself to all present. A ten-
gallon cylinder of sodawater was made and
charged with carbonic acid gas, at a pressure of
125!bs. to the square-inch, within three minutes,
and was found fully equal to the best brands of
bottled soda now in the market.
Tho gun - accident by which the young
Earl of Ancram, A.D.C. to Governor Jersey, met
bis death on 16th inst., was of the most unlucky
character. The party (consisting of Capt. Leigh
and the deceased, with their host, Mr. Edwards,
of Bibbenluke, his nephew, Mr. Wilbraham
Edwards, and two others), while out shooting,
had halted for lunch. After they had finished,
Lord Anoram and Mr. Edwards, sen., mounted
their horses, and on Mr. Edwards, jnn., proceed-
ing to follow their example, the run of ill-fortune
commenced. To begin with, young Edwards
picked up the wrong gun, a muzzle-loader, which
was charged, instead of his own gun, a breech-
loader, which was empty. Then, as he was mount-
ing, the horse, apparently a nasty brute, rushed in
among the other horses and a scramble ensued in
which the gun went off—probably by striking the
cantle of the saddle. Lord Ancram, hearing the
scuffle, had pulled his horse up a few yards off
and turned in the saddle, and when the gun was
fired he received the contents in the face. Death
must have been instantaneous, but the body sit
upright for 20 seconds, then fell to the ground.
Who says there is no such thing as luck ? What
are the odds against such a thing happening again ?
The picking up of the wrong gun, the horse play-
ing the fool, the gun exploding by accident, the
fact of Lord Ancram stopping instead of riding
on, and the gun being pointed straight at
him, form a train of unlucky circumstances
such as could hardly have been foreseen or
guarded against. The dead man (eldest son and
heir of the Marquis of Lothian) was esteemed as
a courteous and refined gentleman, and his
untimely end much grieves the many friends he
had made in Australia.

Surely it can be said, looking over the annals of
history, and peering through the dim vista of
departed years, that no previous record has ever
been established such as has been obtained by
the Proprietary Medicines manufactured by
Mother Mary Joseph Albert.
His Grace, Archbishop Redwood, the chief
dignitary of the Roman Catholic faith in New
Zealand, lias testified that great benefit has been
derived by persons who have used these remedies.
One of Her Majesty Queen Victoria's most
Honorable Privy Councillors, Lord Onslow,
certifies that he himself has personally taken the
Medicines, and received renewed vigor from their
use ; and now a gentleman (Mr. Walter Bentley),
who has delighted the ears of large audiences in
the principal cities of the Colony, and who has
obtained celebrity as an eminent tragedian, and
one of the brightest stars of his profession, pro-
claims to the world that Mother Mary Joseph
Albert has conferred great benefit on suffering
humanity.
No one would say that gent l emen of such high
social standing would lend their names to any-
thing which was not reliable and genuine, and it
is a fact that these Remedies have proved them-
selves to be so.

Dear Sib, —l hasten to acknowledge the
marvellous results of a trial of Marupa.
Ou Sunday my voice was in a most ragged state,

and I thank you heartily for the recommendation.

orders for Mother Aubert’s Remedies that theY
are now used in almost every household in this
town, and, I am happy to inform yon, with very
good results. I find they have a larger sale, and
give more general satisfaction than any other
proprietary medicine. Send me a further supply
of the five shilling size Paramo and Karana.
Yours truly,

PROGRESSION.
THE vegetable medicines of Mother Mary
Joseph Aubert have now become estab-
lished as the favourite remedies, and are the
result of thirty years’ hard study, combined with
the fact that nature, in its beneficence, has pro-
vided an antidote to every indisposition the
human frame is subject to, and which the Rev.
Mo her, in her various researches, has been able
to discover hidden in our New Zealand vegetation.
The preparation known as Natanata is a
specific" for Sickness, Vomiting and Diarrhoea,
three of the most frequent and distressing com-
plaints of females and children. Every housewife
who desires strong and robust health, should take
Natanata at regular intervals, and also give it to
her children. Its action is gentle and certain,
and no one using it can fail to be materially
benefited.
Nature frequently requires assistance, and
when tlie system has been weakened by sickness,
or protracted irregularity, troublesome, or even
fatal results occur, unless counteracted by some
natural and easily assimilated remedy. In sea
sickness, Natanata is simply invaluable, and
those who, on business or pleasure, are travel-
ing, should never he without it.

The Wild-Cat Column
Castlerag—look, stock and barrel—lately sota at
auctioniforsoino £4OO ! What a ghastly commentary on all
that has been published concerning this mine during the
last two years'. For long it bad a piper run almost
entirely in' its own interests, and a manager who reported
periodically its great and increasing richness. It was
purchased' for £OOOO, one half in shares, when it was a
series of holes in which a miserable lil tie lode of low-grade
galena ore existed. It was praised by ‘‘ experts,” it «as
condemned by practical men whose condemnations were
not published. A -crowd, by unceasing, systematic
booming, got the shares up lo £0 and got out. Then
came the concentrating plant, and after that death and
liquidali >n. A few whose faith in a worthless mine
passeth all understanding, revived it for a second death.
Now, plant purchased for Mqunt Galena; mine aban-
doned.

Sometimes the local newspaper correspondent
wrestles with the truth in mining matters. According lo
a Tumut wire, Swamp Oak is “looking tip,” and “ there
are 50 claims on pa able gold.” B.vamp Oak is now in
its second year. It lias a number cf reported companies,
several bitteries, has had lo!s cf crushing-and we have
never yet heard of ils paying a dividend. To be told that
there are 50 claims on payable gold is good news—if true.

Had not an official report on White Rook,
written by one of the few Government mining officials
who know their business, been suppressed in the nick of
time by a somebody who held paid-up shares, a tremend-
ous amount of money would have been saved.

The big hydraulic sluicing works in connection
with the Spa and Jessop companies on the Shoalhaven,
N.S.W., will be started in a few weeks, and, if successful,
a great movement in sluicing will be inaugurated. Tub
BuUjBTIX predicts success, and with success the washing
away of the old bed of the Shoalhaven river, which con-
sists of oo intless millions of tons of gold-bearing wash-
dirt, more or less payable. It also compliments Mr.
Wilshire, the mining warden, on the persistency with
which ho has, for many years, pushed this big thing
forward on public grounds.

After all Australia has heard of the wonderful
efficiency of the Luhrig ore-dressing machinery, that
company is apparently not enterprising enough to erect
a plant at their own risk, and other people are not dis-
posed to take it. In view of the great cost of this
machinery, one cannot see anything amazing about its
results. That, too, must be the consensus of opinion in
Victoria, where, if proven results justified it, they would
have the plant erected even if it had to be made of solid
gold, jewelled in 447 holes.

We have often sympathised with the people of
the Emerald Proprietary mine, because of the sheer
monotony of the reports on the sinking of ButteFs
shaft “a further depth of two-feet-six,” and their
“ expectations to strike emeralds” at any moment. At
last things have changed a bit—two big events have
occurred: “Have had severe weather, so could not get
into the bush;” “Have painted numbers on all the
corner posts of company’s blocks.” We trust this infor-
mation has been cabled to the man gone to London to
float the concern.

We anticipated as much—the Great Eastern
Lode Cos. did not “go off ” with a wild boom. The pros-
pectus stated that unless 70,000 shares were applied for the
money would tie returned. After a huge amount of
advertising, a big board with a lord at its head, and other
attractions, the public applied for a few hundred, or a few
thousand shares, but the promoters made up the differ-
ence. The days of mine-booming by advt. are over, and
thou'di very late in the day that is some consolation.

The Glen Elgin mines comprise several gold-
leases near Glen Lines owned by an English company.
They are being well opened up on what looks like a per-
manent quartz-lode. The country is granite-so far,
deeotnnosed. The lode varies from one foot to three
averaging about 18in. Before erecting expensive
machinery the Cos. hired a toy battery and kept it going
at the rate of a ton a day for months testing different
pans of the reef ; the average of free gold was loz sdwts.
per ton. The lode is opened by three tunnels driven
on its course into the hill and by several shafts
sunk to meet the tunnels. Some £3COO have been
very wisely spent in this work to find out what
the' Cos. had to go for. At the foot of the hill,
near the mouth of the bottom tunnel, is the Glen
Ebdn river, an overflowing stream, with which it is in-
tended to drive the battery rock-borers, as well as to
drain and light the mine. The work of bringing in the
water from a higher point up the river is now proceeding.
The mine is well managed, and, to nil appearances, will
recoup the English shareholders, who are spending their
money in the right way.

Last year, when Block 10’s were at .£l3, many a
mining man knew that they were working a rich shoot of
ore oMimitrd dimensions, with no great body of payable
ore with which to blend it to a fair, dividend-paying
average. The fact is only discovered, or proclaimed
officially, when the shares have fallen below £5.
# * •
A mass of correspondence has been published re
Baker s Creek Consolidated G.M. Cos., signifying nothing.
H-re is the plain truth about the mine. For twelve
months reports have been glowing and have indicated a
permanent good-sized rich reef. Mouths ago we asked,
“Why don’t they crush ?” there was a big battery idle
close at hand. Now, there turns out to lie only 30 tons
at grass—averaging, says a later report, about an ounce
which will never do, the reef being insignificant. Now
that thousands have been wasted, perhaps the directors
will see they should have amalgamated with the
Baker’s Creek North Cos. which would have saved the
siukinv of anew shaft in the creek—a shaft which has
already been flooded and is always open to this danger.
The D C N. tiave a splendid shaft in a safe position already
down 200 feet below the level of the creek, and from
which the whole of the ground could be worked to the
advantage of both companies. The Cos., moreover, were
always ready to amalgamate for much less than has since
been resulllessly wasted. Because amalgamation did not
suit some people, other people’s money lias been thrown
away. , , *
Remarkable that while one part of the Supreme
Court, in Melbourne, was diving into the transactions of
the Bear Hill “corner” another court was engaged in
hearing a petition for the winding up of that company
because of its inability to meet its liabilities. To success-
fully work a “corner ” in which Vickery and others were
so hnnlv jammed, a worthless mine was worked and
thousands wasted in plant and development. iet many
a New England mining amateur pinned Ins faith and
dropped his money in it, and always asked sympathising
unbelievers “to wait till we crush.” Yes crush, crush-
ing, crushed.
• • *
The Gem Amalgamated mine is, we believe, at
Brimhramulia, but please don’t ask us where that is.
Brimbramulla has got a dandy mining manager, whose
last is that he, with two men, in eleven days, lias raised
18 tons of quartz, “a record which has not been
approached by double the number of men since Brim-
bramulla has been opened.” Then the Brimbramulla man
proceeds to show what he is prepared to do with five
men, five heads and a waterwheel. In fact, says he,
“if the Government were to erect a large battery, 1
guarantee to find good, profitable employment for a thou-
sand of the unemployed.”
* * *
A Melbourne paper tells a story about a mining-
manao-er in the far North. His salary was in arrear, so
I e went fortli in his private capacity and took out a writ
po-iinst himself in ins capacity as legal representative of
the company. Then in the latter capacity he accepted
service of the writ, and said nothing about it to the
i'irectors When the case came on he appeared in his
capacity as plaintiff and proved the debt, but he made no
tmuearance in his capacity as defendant, and judgment
went by default. Then in the one capacity lie issued
execution against himself in the other capacity, and was
iiist coin" off with the company’s office furniture pet
medium of a bailiff when the directors heard of it, and
fired him out in both capacities, and obtained anew
trial.

The Brilliant mine, Charters Towers, has paid
dividends amounting to £3 7s. on its capital value.
The Federal Hydraulic Sluicing Co.’s prospectus
has been issued in Melbourne. Tne property is just across
the border !n Victoria at a spot known as Back Greek, a
few miles from Delegate. The ground, the writer believes
to be good enough, but the very doubtful point about the
concern is the “get away ” for the wash, and on this the
reports of the experts are remarkably silent. With ample
fall for the wash the ground will be worked profitably ;
without, it is worthless.
Webb’s, after many a transition, is now m a
state of liquidation. Although it never declared a divi-
dend the shares once reached £0. One time it puzzled
the management how to treat the ore ; the difficulty over-
come, it was found the ore didn’t contain enough silver
to repay the cost. The show consisted of a small galena
lode of low grade and expensive to smelt at that. Thou-
sands have been spent in the mine and thousands in plant,
and hundreds of thousands in share-gambling.
A CELEBRATED NOVELIST
CHARLES DICKENS.
This clever novelist was by far the most popular
writer that ever lived in England. Living as 1m
did at the same time as Thackeray, he reached a
class of readers whom Thackeray could not touch •
and judged by the mere test of the income derived
from his writings, he stands alone. Shakespeare
is consecrated by two centuries and a half of fame,
and yet as many people buy Dickens as buy
Shakespeare, and for 1 that reads Shakespeare
there are 10 that read Dickens. The truth is that
Dickens had a Shakespeare power of creation
modernised; his characters have a newness, a
vividness, a naturalness that commend them at a
glance to all the world. The best of them, such
as Sam Weller, and that every-day character Mr.
Pecksniff, have more than this; they have that
truthfulness which makes the reader look upon
them not as characters in a novel but as human
beings.
It must be admitted that Dickens was the first
• to bring home with anything like convincing force
to the minds of Londoners the incessant flow of
tragedy and comedy which was going on around
them, and he accomplished this by presenting to
the world his life portraits in simple printer’s ink,
framed in language that could not fail to impress.
His “Oliver Twist’’ did more than a thousand
police reports, aided by the propaganda of all the
charitable organisations of London, to show_ the
tragedy of life in the great city. “Pickwick,”
despite its delightful exaggeration, was true in
showing the absurdities and elements of happy
comedy that everyday life may present us with.
These are, perhaps, the reasons of Dickens’s suc-
cess, and to have succeeded as he did stamps the
man as most remarkable. We need_ not discuss
the question whether his writings will be read a
century hence. But there can be no doubt that
the fame of St. Jacobs Oil will survive even that
of the great novelist, and its praises will be
sounded so long as it continues to rank, as it now
does, as the natural exterminator of rheumatism,
gout, neuralgia, sciatica, and other kindred com-
plaints. For burns, sprains, aches, internal pains,
bruises, cramps, and cuts it stands without an
equal in the world, as thousands upon thousands
daily testify.
A REMARKABLE FORECAST.
Some considerable time since a shrewd financier
declared that the coming watch of the century
would be one that could he sold for a minimum
price; one which should possess the character-
istics of simplicity in construction, interchange-
ableness, and easy replacement of parts, and com-
bining accuracy with convenience in its winding
and setting attachments, and a nicety of- adjust-
ment in its regulation. The period has arrived
when the people are ripe for the introduction of
such a timepiece, and the timepiece itself is here,
answering the forecast in every particular. Each
separate requirement set out is to be found in the
new model short-wind Waterbary watches, series
“K”for gentlemen, and series “N” for ladies.
While the original long-wind Waterbnry, series
“ E,” will never fade out of grateful remembrance
as a faithful friend and infallible recorder of time,
the new series in rolled gold, sterling silver, and
nickel are destined to achieve even a greater
success. They are intended to more fully meet
the ever-growing taste of the public for a time-
keeper which, while possessing all the qualities of
accuracy and durableness that has distinguished
all watches of the Waterbury manufacture, will
also partake in the highest degree of the character
of ornamental appearance, as well as affording
the most approved facilities for winding and
adjustment. Watches of this description, manu-
factured by the celebrated Waterbury Company,
are now offered for sale in all the principal cities
and towns of Australasia. They are finished in
the best style, are chaste in design, embracing
sufficient variety to suit every taste, and it is not
overstepping the mark to say that there is
positively no other timekeeper in the market—
English. American, or Continental—that can in
any respect approach them as inexpensive watches
fit'to he worn by peasant or prince.


“August
Flower”
For two years I suffered terribly
with stomach trouble, and was for
all that time under treatment by a
physician. He finally, after trying
everything, said stomach was about
worn out, and that I would have to
cease eating solid food for a time at
least. I was so weak that I could
network. Finally on the recom-
mendation of a friend who had used
your preparations
A worn-out with beneficial re-
sults, I procured a
Stomach. bottle of August
Flower, and com-
menced using it. It seemed to do
me good at once. I gained in
strength and flesh rapidly; my ap-
petite became good, and I suffered
no bad effects from what I ate. I
feel now like a new man, and con-
sider that August Flower has en-
tirely cured me of Dyspepsia in its
worst form. James E. Dederice,

Brisbane Telegraph is publishing a story

Marshal MacMahon was never celebrated
as a brilliant conversationalist. Onoe he visited
the military school at St. Cyr, and finding a
solitary negro youth among the cadets it occurred
to him that the African must feel lonesome, and
in his own kindly way he tried to encourage him.
“You are a negro,’ he said pleasantly. “Yes,
M. le President.” “ Ah, well! ” said the Marshal,
“ continue so.” And the youth took his advice,
and continued to be a negro indefinitely.
Dear Bulletin, —Those who are about to

The Otago Workman (Dunedin, M.L.), a
paper which takes a high moral attitude on the
subject of plagiarism, prints on the front page of
its issue of May 28 two unacknowledged Bulletin
articles, with the evident intention of passing
them off as its own. Then a kind friend writes
to Dunedin Globe and evidently tries, in his
own poor way, to do us a good turn, by pointing
out that the articles in question were cadged from
the “Melbourne Bulletin,” a grief-laden comic
print which annexed this paper’s name died of a
broken heart years ago. It is_ pretty hard for
The Bulletin to get credit for its articles, some-
how.
No outsider looking at the N.S. Wales
railway season-ticket fares would guess that the
mother province has any tendency towards demo-
cracy. Take Parramatta, the Sydney suburban
limit; 15 miles. The monthly first-class ticket is
£117s. whilst the yearly ticket is only =£16 2s. 6d.,
so that the poor devil who can only scrape together
sufficient to take out a monthly ticket has to pay
£22 4s. per annum as against Croesus’ £16 2s. 6d.
—a reduction equal to about 27J per cent.
That the handling of £16 2s. 6d. is worth £6 Is.

The ancient wheeze about the pious soldier
who was saved through a bullet lodging in the
Bible which he carried in his pocket right over his
sympathetic heart, was improved on the other day
by a Wellington (M.L.) evangelist. According
to this man’s story, a private who was serving in
Havelock’s army when it entered Lucknow had
the usual Scripture buttoned inside his waistcoat
and adjacent to his stomach, and while thus
encumbered he was rushed by two mutineers —one
in front with a gun and one on the flank carrying
a large axe. The Briton’s own rifle was empty,
and he felt that it was all up with him. There-
fore he uttered a silent prayer and was going to
lay on with the butt-end, but at that thrilling
moment the man in front fired, and the bullet
glanced off the Bible and killed the person with
the axe, and before the gunner could reload the
British soldier leaped on him and pounded him to
death. This, said the speaker, was another proof
that Providence was a great institution, and the
audience evidently believed him. The average
mission audience, in fact, will believe anything.
Hampered as we are here by cranks,
faddists, and the solvers of every difficulty this
continent possesses—from Federation to the find-
ing of the South Pole—it is cheering to see an
Australian enterprise of great magnitude and
proportions assuming definite shape, and running
on lines so straight as to prove a national benefit.
The prospectus of the New South Wales Refrigera-

the firm has been utilised successfully in placing

of them on the provisional board testifies.
With beef and mutton one shilling per pound in
London and one or two pence here, and the cost
of freezing and carriage so small, it looks equal to
the best gold-mine in Australia, and those who
take shares in this company may find it so.

THIS Company is formed with the object of establishing Refrigerating Works at the various grazing centres of New
South Wales, for the purpose of freezing and exporting meat to the London and other markets, and there to establish
Depots with cooling chambers for its reception and disposal.
The establishment of this Company will supply a long-felt want to the pastoralists of New South Wales, by providing a
market for their vast amount of surplus stock, which is increasing, and is of the most paramount importance to all stock owners
that there should be a market for it without any avoidable delay, so that the rapidly increasing surplus of fat stock should find
a profitable outlet through its agency.
It is to be hoped that all stock owners and others interested in the welfare of the colony will take a practical share in
establishing this Company on a sound and lasting basis, as by so doing they will reap substantial profits, directly and indirectly,
upon their investments, and establish an industry which will prove a great boon to the colony.
No contracts of any kind have been entered into, and the whole of the future arrangements as to the erection of the
Refrigerating Works, etc., are in the hands of the shareholders. The Company will be entirely managed by the shareholders,
who will have the appointment of the Directors and all other officials.
The whole of the capital paid up will be placed to the credit of the Company, less brokerage of five per cent, on the
subscribed capital.
Shares will be allotted in order of priority of application.
Prospectuses, application forms, and all information can be obtained from the Solicitors of the Company, or from Messrs.
D’Arcy Brothers, Brokers, Scott Chambers, 96 Pitt Street, Sydney.
Gentlemen willing to be on the Provisional Board of this Company will please forward their names and addresses in
full to the Brokers.
The Railway Commissioners have written to the Brokers their willingness to supply Refrigerating Cars for the transit
of the frozen meat from the works to the ship’s side.
It is proposed to put works in Yass, Wagga, Hay, Cooma, Forbes or Orange,, Bourke, Tamworth, Deniliquin, Dubbo or
Willington, Newcastle, and such other centres as the shareholders may decide so as to embrace the whole of the colony.
To open Cooling Chambers and Australian Stores in London, there to sell the meat retail.
Lord Carrington is at present advocating in London the support of the Lords and Noblemen of England for Australian
meat, and negotiations are in progress between the brokers and Mr. J. C. Rounding, representing Messrs. Westgarth & Co.,
Colonial Financiers, London, to place half the capital on the London market.
Applications for shares in this Company can be made to the Australian Joint Stock Bank, Sydney, or any of its
Branches in New South Wales; to the Company’s Solicitors, Messrs. Slattery & Heydon, Pitt and Market Streets, Sydney;
or to the Brokers, Messrs. D’Arcy Brothers, Scott Chambers, 96 Pitt-street, Sydney.
All Cheques made payable to the “ New South Wales Refrigerating and Meat -Export Company,” and crossed

Ten thousand (10,000) shares were applied for before registration, and 15,000 are already sold:

At a Cornishmen’s dinner in London, the
other night, one solitary individual took his “ God
Save the Queen ” in a sitting posture, and would
have been dragged to pieces by an infuriated

when he’s half drunk.
When the English coal-miners got a rise
some years ago from Is. l|d. to Is. 8£d. per ton,
the price of coal was straightway raised from 12s.
per ton to 20s. Then the increased price was set
down to the greed of the miners, urged on by
««agitators ” and trades-nnions, and 30,000,000
people, mostly fools, believe the assertion to this
day. . , .

But do you use SAPOLIO ? If you don’t you are as much behind the

plantation, being unsuccessful, was returning dis-
consolately home, but determined as a last resource
to make another trial at a mill in the distance.
He was again told there was no work, when, as he
was leaving, he noticed a breach of the regulations
of the new Polynesian Act: Blacks employed
doing white men’s work in the mill. Gaily he
proceeded to town and laid an information. The
planter was fined—and Bill Jones was summoned

Dear Bulletin,—J?e Queensland slave-

to me in the good old days : “ The Ariel is an un-
lucky craft. Five times I’ve been aboard her and
something bad has happened. The first time the
captain dies, and we had to put back. The next
trip a hurricane catches us and we become dis-
masted and put back again. The next time the
Government agent has delirium tremens and
orders us back to port. We then get another
Government agent who was tonicked when he
came aboard, and he and the captain have a h
of a drinking bout, and things look desperate.
One morning we hear an awful row, the captain
and all of us rush down to the G.A.’s cabin and
we see him with a razor in either hands jabbing
at his throat, out of which the blood was spurt-
ing yards. The captain tried to rush him, but
he makes a jab at him with the two razors, and we
stood there looking and couldn’t do anything.
When he saw we were frightened he gave a grin,
put his hand to his throat, and tried to pull his
windpipe out and throw it at us. Then he fell
back and died in a minute. That’s the sort of
man who used to go to sea to protect the interests
of the South Sea nigger.”— Disciple.
Neither of the Melbourne evening papers
is particularly prosperous. One of them has had
to ask its preference shareholders to accept a
lower rate of interest than that guaranteed by the
deed of sale; and the other congratulates itself
upon having a large sum—in its shareholders’
pockets — which it can call up when the
bank insists upon the reduction of the over-
draft. But the betting is in favour of the
new-comer since the ancient sinner has passed
under the control of pietists, whose chief aim
is understood to be the salvation of the
staff. The reporters’ book is now headed “ Go
forth in the name of the Lord ” under which
superscription the directions “ City court, Mr.
Simpkins ; ” “ Morgue, Mr. Shrirnpkins ; ”
“Chinese atrocities, Mr. Timpkins;” “Emerald
Hill outrage, Mr. Limpkins,” and other entries of
the kind acquire a godly and religious appearance.
The ultimate intention of the proprietors is to turn
the publication into an extra-reading book for the
little dears in the Methodist Ladies’College, and
Jem Middleton is said to be hard at work upon a
Bowdlerised edition of the adventures of the late
Frederick Bayley Deeming to be circulated among
those innocent young virgh s.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“I am sorry you have had your ride for nothin",
Mr. Hardington. My husband left home yester-
day, for a fortnight.”
“I didn’t come to see your husband ; I came to
see your dear little self—and Well you know it. ’
he answered, stepping on to the verandah, and
coolly taking the seat to which she had not invited
him.
.. The words struck her like a whip ; in a flash she
saw the depth of the pit her own folly had dug for
her. Folly and vanity—nothing more ; but now
her punishment was come, for there was no mis-
taking the insolent familiarity of this man’s
manner, and, looking at him as he sat there, big,
handsome, and smilint;, she read him at last tor
the heartless villain he was.
“God help me!” she thought; “I meant no evil.”
But she only said, “ I will not pretend to mis-
understand you, sir ! You assume —you dare to
assume!” —flashing into sudden he:it —“that the
terms on which—on which I have been foolish
enough to receive you here —will justify ’ —but
here a keen sense of the indignity overcame her,
and she broke down hopelessly.
“ That’s better !” said Hardington, crossing his
legs, and carelessly tapping his boot with his whip.
“ The tragedy business isn’t in your line a bit, you
know. And all this virtuous indignation is rather
overdone, isn’t it? You’re not a green girl, you
know, and you couldn’t have thought I came
dangling round here for the sake of your hus-
band’s society—little prig that he is 1”
“Mr. Hardington,” she answered, forcing her
voice into a semblance of steadiness, “what I
thought is not to the purpose. What did you
think ? Let me know in plain words. There
must be no misunderstanding about this business !”
Her hard, matter-of-fact tone disconcerted him
a trifle. His cold eye lost a shade of its insolence,
and he laughed uneasily as he answered, “Well,
I thought that, as you had been so kind already !”
and he rose as if to take her hand.
“Not yet!” she said, drawing back, but smiling
as she did so—a smile which puzzled Hardington.
He thought he understood women from top to toe,
but there was something here, he told himself,
which was a trifle beyond him.
“ Sit down,” went on Mrs. Redwood, now out-
wardly as calm as he was. “ Let us begin at the
beginning. There must, as I said, be no mistake
about this matter. Correct me if I am wrong.
You made my acquaintance at the house of a
friend, three months ago, or thereabouts. You
took pains to make yourself agreeable. I found
you well-mannered, well-tempered, and well-
favoured. Pshaw ! sir—why disclaim it? This
is no time for trumpery affectations, and you shall
see that I will be equally candid on my part. I
was pleased with your society—why should I deny
lt; • This bush life is but a dull existence for me,
and any distraction was welcome. Well, you got
into the way of coming here, and you showed—l
don t know what you showed —but you set people
talking An easy matter, you will say, in a little
township like Tarragalla. I know it, and I said,
Let them talk ! Let the galled jade’—but why
hnish the passage for a man whose Shakespeare is
the stud-book ? I meant no harm. Before God, I
say I never had a thought unfaithful to the husband
whom—let me put your purpose into the plain
words you are yourself afraid to give it —the hus-
oancl whom you expect me to dishonour !”
Hardington jumped to his feet, stung, at last,
through his thick hide of self-complacency. A
prettv story, truly !” he said, with a savage sneer.
“You meant no harm! You thought no, evil .
Get people to believe that, if you can, But i
don’t care what you meant or thought. I m not
to be played fast-and-loose with in this way, 1 can
tell you ! I mayn’t know much about Shake-
speare, as you say, but, damn me ! I know how to
bring you off your high horse, at any rate. Your
husband, too ! Come now, Milly,” ho went on,
with a sudden change of tone, “fidelity, and
virtue, and all that are very fine upon paper, we
know, but you are a woman of taste, and it can t
really be that you prefer that insignificant little
rat of a fellow to me ? Why ” —and here he stood
up to his full six-feet-two —“ I could pitch him
over that railing with one hand 1”
“I don’t doubt it,” she sai l. “But, when you
had done so, you would have pitched over a man
immeasurably vour superior in every respect but
one. And, since the solitary advantage which
you have over him is one which any one of your
own bullocks possesses over yourself, he may well
make you a present of it.” . ■ ,
No sarcasm pierces like that which is pointed
With a self-evident truth. Hardington s rage
became white-hot, and his words came slowly and
viciously, as he played his trump-card.
“ You little fool 1” he said. “You are in my
power—body and soul ! \ ou bring your fate upon
yourself. Remember Wandoorah ! ”
Mrs. Redwood looked him steadily in the eyes.
Not a muscle moved, to show the agony of pain
and shame which swept over her at the word. But
her colour faded slowly as she looked, till the cold-
blooded villain, gazing on her ghastly cheek, could
see that this time he had scored indeed. Suddenly
she flashed again. With shame, he thought, but
he was wrong. Shame she felt —bitter and burn-
ing—that this, of all men, should possess her secret.
But it was the flush of a sudden and desperate
resolution that was upon her face as she turned
away and walked steadily intp the house.
“ Wants to pull herself together a bit,’ thought
Hardington. “ I’ve got her, now 1 It was pretty
hard on her. too, but she brought it on herself.
Why, what fresh turn is this ? ”...
She was standing before him again, all traces of
excitement gone from her face. Her cheeks were
pale once more, but her eyes were steady and her
voice was quiet, as she said ; “Sit down, please.
I fear we must have another little explanation.
You mentioned a certain place, just now Wan-
doorah. What of Wandoorah, pray ?
“Oh, you don’t require to be told that ! said
Hardington, sulkily, sitting down again, and look-
ing, as he felt, confounded by her coolness.
“ But I do renuire to be told that,” she said, in
the same unruffled tone. “You have said too
much or too little. What of Wandoorah, please .
I ask you again.” .
“ Well, hang it! if you will have it, you shall.
You lived there, didn’t you ? ”
“ I lived there; yes.'’
“And you made, while you were there, a a
slip, we’ll call it!”
She drooped her head. “ Yes,” she answered,
with a sigh, “I made a slip as you call it. Un,
God !” she went on, as if to herself, that such a
fellow as this should have the power to cast it in
my teeth.” . , ~ ,
“Damn it!” he broke out furiously, do you
presume to take this tone with me? You, who
are ho better than .” ~ ....
“Stop!” she cried, as with a deadly glitter in
her eye she slipped her right hand swiftly into her
pocket. “Don’t use that word! My servant is
gone to the township. There is nobody within
half a mile of us. So, take care I say !’
Hardington stared at her for a moment and
then laughed unaffectedly. “ Why,” he said, is
it actually threatening me? Poor little thing
it must be terribly off its balance. Now, look
here, Milly, let’s have no more of this nonsense.
I’ll put the whole matter in a few words, I know
what happened at Wandoorah. Never mind how
I came by the knowledge. I have all the par-
ticulars, and the long and short of it is that either
you will .”
“Or what 2”
“ Or your husband shall know all.
“Fool! Fool, as well as villain ! My husband
knows it already !” _ ~ , , • „
“ The devil he does !” said Hardington, looking
up at her with a poisonous sneer. “ Well, there s
certainly no aceounting for tastes ! I should have
thought straightlaced Tom Redwood- .
“ Bah !” she interrupted. “You make the
mistake which men of your stamp always make.
Because your wretched little soul cannot estimate
the bitterness of a woman’s repentance, do you
think there is no such thing in the world as a
man? Yes, my husband knows it, but, unlike
you, he has both a heart and a head. And now,
sir, I have but this more to say. Begone ! Forget
you ever heard my name, but do not flatter your-
self that you take away with you my hatred. You
have shown yourself too poor a thing tor hate.
For all your size and strength, for all your broad
shoulders and bearded chin —you are less of a man
than even those poor mutilated creatures to whose
care the Turk consigns his women ! Do you
understand me?” she hissed, almost m his ear as
he sat silenced by the fiery natural eloquence thus
struck out of the woman by her overmastering in-
dignation. _ T .
But he was not beaten yet, _ He got up and
went towards his horse. “lou’re too inuch
excited, now, to know what you’re saying, he
answered, turning round, with the bridle in his
hand. “But I’ll give you this to think over at
your leisure. Your husband, you say, knows all
about you. I daresay he does ; he was always a
soft-hearted fool. But the township doesn t know,
and I swear to you by all that’s holy that, it you
don’t send for me within three days, all 1 arragalla
shall know as much about Mrs. Redwood s past
history as I do. I needn’t tell you it will be all up
a tree with you, then ; but you’ll only have your-
self to thank. You tvould have the straight tip,
you know, and now you’ve got it. Good-day. ’
“Stay!” she cried, running to the top of the
steps as he put his foot in the stirrup. “ Would
you really do what you say ? It would be as bad
as killing me, you understand !”
He hitched up his horse again, and came
towards her. “She’s giving way!’ he thought.
“Yes,” he said aloud, “it would be, as you say,
just as bad as killing you. So, let me hope you 11
hear reason at last. ’"
“ And you would do this to a woman who never
harmed you ; who never harmed a living creature
but herself?” ~ ..
“ Well, it would seem a bit cruel, he said, with
a pitiful snigger. “ But, then, it’s easy for you to
avoid it, you know.” .
“Ay !” she answered, with a sudden setting or
the teeth—“it’s so easy to avoid it, as you say.
And there is only one way, is there? ’ tJ
“ Only one way, and that not a hard one, he
answered, coming closer, but, as he reached for her
hand, it went suddenly into her pocket.
“ You lie, you miserable hound !'’ she cnecl,
“ There is this way 1” and out came her hand with
her husband’s revolver in it. Hardmgton rushed
for his horse, and sprang into the saddle just as a
bullet knocked up a cloud of dust under the
animal’s belly. Again the persecuted woman
fired, as he galloped off, and again—as women
will—she “pulled down,” for the missile extracted
a yell of wrath and pain from the flying Lothario,
as it lodged in his left leg, behind the knee.
Great was the talk at Korumbadgery Station
about the boss’s son having accidentally shot
himself in the leg. Such, at anyrate, was Harding-
ton’s own story —an explanation which did not
altogether commend itself to the surgeon who
dealt with the injured limb. But the surgeon was
a discreet man, not given to asking too many
questions, and thus is it that the crutch which
Hardington will carry to his grave brings him a
commiseration which would be largely discounted
if the true story of his injury were known. But
the man’s vanity is the woman’s safety, and iom
Redwood will never know who discharged the two
chambers of the pistol which he left loaded m all
five.

The Bank-Manager’s Girl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thebe were two men at Bogalong in love with the
one woman, and each of them tried to hide the
fact from the other, because they both worked in
the same bank. It was the only bank in the place
—Bogalong always was a one-horse town—and
Chapson, the manager, and his assistant, Perkins,
formed the whole staff. The woman who was the
cause of the trouble was beautiful, of course. Blue
eyes, flossy hair, and a fine figure on horseback,
Chapson was very much “gone” on her, being
only five-and-twenty, and innocent. Perkins was
“shook,” too —excuse the aboriginal idioms —but
he was a Melbourne man, and “ fly.” Hcr name
was Nelly Jacques.
Miss Jacques, being of age, and having inherited
some property, had a banking-account. Chapson,
merely as an excuse for calling on her—used to
urge her to transfer it from the distant bank with
which she dealt to the Bogalong institution. And
he was quite pleased when she did so, for he fore-
saw many “ business ” interviews between himself
and Miss Jacques looming ahead. Perkins mani-
fested no emotion on the auspicious occasion, how-
ever. He calmly headed a fresh page in the
general ledger, “ Ellen Jacques, Landowner,” and
smiled darkly as the first entry showed “ cr. £lO2
2s. Id.”
Then Miss Jacques’ autographs flowed in freely,
and Chapson used to feel quite proud and almost
benefactor-like as he honoured their demands. In
thi’ee weeks the cr. balance had sunk to £2 odd,
and Chapson was immensely delighted that a
cheque of Nelly’s—ho used to think of her as
“ Nell}’,” now—for £lO should just then be pre-
sented. Of course he paid it at once—what a
capital chance of doing Nelly a little favour !
Then a few more requests to pay bearer tumbled
in (how he hated Perkins’ style of always asking
whether he should pay !) until Miss Jacques’
account stood dr. £25, which Perkins noted with
his usual cold-blooded smile. At this time Chap-
son and Perkins were both courting Miss Jacques
to the very utmost of their respective abilities,
Chapson—poor innocent—thinking himself the
only candidate for the lady’s affections, and the
darksome Perkins lying very low, but well satis-
fied with his chances.
11.
Now came Chapson’s opportunity. Miss Jacques
formally requested from the bank an advance of
£2OO, “ to improve her selection.” Said Chapson :
“Depend upon mo, Miss Jacques, to do the very
best I can for you with the general manager.”
And he received a look of gratitude in reply that
was well worth ten times £2OO, in his opinion,
“ I suppose,” Miss Jacques said, innocently, “I
shall have to sign a mortgage, or a bill-of-sale, or
some other horrid legal paper ?”
Chapson felt quite ashamed of the institution he
represented as he admitted that such would pro-
bably be the case.
“ I’ll let you know by the end of the week, Miss
Nelly,” said he, as he escorted her out, and, under
Perkins’ baleful glare, assisted her on her horse.
“And in the meantime” — tohat an idiot he was —
“any little amounts, you know—er ”
“Mr. Chapson, you’re a perfect dear! You
make this nasty business quite a pleasure. I’m so
much obliged. Goodbye !” And she cantered
away, leaving Chapson in such a joyous state that
he straightway went in and offered to lend Perkins
his horse whenever Perkins liked. Perkins, there-
upon, accepted the offer for the following Sunday,
when he went out riding with Miss Jacques. And
poor old Chapson knew not of it, and was quite
disappointed when he called that Sunday to hear
that “ Miss Nelly was not at home.”
The head office sanctioned the advance to Miss
Jacques, provided that she executed an equitable
mortgage on her land in favour of the bank, and
provided, also, that a competent valuer confirmed
Chapson’s estimate that the said land was worth
£4OO, and Chapson was so far gone that he actually
squared that valuer! Which was necessary, as
will be seen.
But Miss Jacques delayed in the matter of
executing the mortgage —“that stupid lawyer,
Mr. Chapson, is so slow !”—until she had piled up
the respectable debit balance of £9O, and Chapson
began to receive letters weekly from the head-
office inquiring as to “ the security held on Ellen
Jacques’ overdraft,” and reminding him of pre-
vious instructions regarding unsecured advances.
When the amount reached three figures, per-
emptory orders were received from head-quarters
to have the overdraft reduced at once, or sufficient
security lodged. That very day Miss Jacques’
cheque for £BO odd came in with the mail, and
Chapson went round to see her about it. But he
found she had gone away for a month’s holiday.
She had left a letter for him, however, saying she
was so sorry she couldn’t bid him good-bye, that
she would send those parchment things, all pro-
perly signed, next week, and that she was his most
sincerely—
Well, you can’t blame Chapson. What else
could he do? That evening, it became Perkins’
duty, as ledger-keeper, to enter up Miss Jacques
debit as £l9O 3s. 6d. He didn’t care—there was no
responsibility attaching to him—but Chapson was
shaken up a bit next day on receiving a private
letter from a friend at head-quarters to say that
“Ugly Jack” —the very worst of all the bank’s
inspectors —would be round this way during the
week. Also, that he’d better put the screw on all
his unsecured O.D. men, or there’d be squalls !
Now, “ Ugly Jack ” hated Chapson like the very
devil, so Chapson prayed very hard the next few
days for a sight of Miss Jacques or that mortgage
deed. But neither showed up. And the day
before the inspector’s coming arrived.
There was only one way out now. Perkins’
smile was a study that evening, as he entered Up
a credit of .£l9O to Miss Jacques and debited
John Charles Ohapspn’s account with precisely
the same amount on a cheque payable to “self,"
which debit reduced the unhappy manager’s credit
balance to 13s. 9d. But when the inspector came
next day it was very gratifying to Chapson to
note his look of disappointment on viewing Miss
J.’s page. “And I’ll get Nelly to give mo a
cheque for it when she comes back,” he reflected.
“Or maybe there’ll be no need. If she’ll only say
‘yes,’ we’ll—’’ and he gazed into futurity and
was happy. Until Miss Jacques returned.
111.
For she treated him with marked chilliness. In
vain he tried to discover the cause (which was
simply that Perkins had kept Miss Jacques posted
in all the developments of her business at the
bank), uselessly endeavoured to re-assume the
former pleasant relations, and—ass that he was—
brought matters to a climax by asserting that ho
loved Miss Jacques more than anything else in the
world, and would she be his wife? Whereupon
she laughed and said, “Thanks, Mr. Chapson, I’d
rather not! ”
Going home he met Miss Jacques’ lawyer, and
tried to hide his distressed appearance by talking
business. “ Gotthat mortgage ready jet, Pounce?’
said he.
“ That which ? ”
“ Why, you know—Miss Jacques to the bank —
two hundred pounds—land at Dry Creek, with
buildings, tenements, messuages, and so on, and
so forth.”
“First I've heard of it,” said Pounce. “ Say it
again, and say it slow.” So Chapson explained.
“Why, hang it, man, that ground don’t belong
to Miss Jacques. She’s only a quarter interest in
it. And it’s mortgaged up to the handle already,
to the bank at llopefield. Besides, the whole
turn-out ain’t worth more than a .£lOO, at the out-
side, Don’t you go landing any money on that,
my son, or you’ll slip ! ”
I don’t think, for a moment, that it was the loss
of his money that troubled Chapson. What he
fretted over was the girl. And he grew’neglectful
of his work, and failed to flatter and coax folks
into doing business with him, and was surly to
existing customers, and became untidy in his
attire, and fond of whisky and devil’s-pooj. So
business fell off, and Perkins testified strongly
against the manager, and Chapson w’as repri-
manded. This did no good, so he was transferred
to a less important branch, where he played more
pool, and absorbed altogether too much whisky.
When the shortage occurred —a couple of years
later —his friends squared the matter, but Chapson
had to go, and he has since drifted away out of
the ken of all wdio used to know him. The last I
heard of him was that he was a house-to-house tea-
fiend, and there are not many grades below that.
Poor old Jack ! he w*as as good a fellow as ever
lived, but too soft—too soft!
And Miss Jacques ? Oh, she married Perkins.
He’s manager at Bogalong now.

Taking His Chance.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They stood by the door of the Inn on the Rise
May Carney looked up in the bushranger’s eves •
“Oh! why did you come?— it was mad of" you
Jack,
You know chat the troopers are all on your
track.”
A laugh and a shake of his obstinate head—
“l wanted a dance, and I’ll chance it,” he said.
Full twenty-four bushmen had come to tin
“ball,”
But Jack from his youth had been known to them
all, *
And bushmen are soft where a woman is fair,
So the love of May Carney protected him there
And all the short evening—it seems like romance—
She waltzed with a bushranger—taking his chance*
Twas midnight—the dancers stood suddenly still
For hoofs had been heard on the side of the hill!
Ben Duggan, the drover, along the hillside
Came riding as only a bushman can ride.
He sprang from his horse ; to the shanty he sped—
“ The troopers are down in the gully !” he said.
Quite close to the homestead the troopers wer e
seen.
“Clear out and ride hard for the ranges, Jack
Dean.
Be quick!” said May Carney—her hand on hc r
heart—
“ We’ll bluff them awhile, and ’twill give you a
start.”
He lingered a moment-to kiss her, of course—
Then ran to the trees where he’d hobbled hi s
horse.
She ran tdfyhe gate, and the troopers were there—
The jingle of hobbles came faint on the air—
Then loudly she screamed : ’twas only to drown
The treacherous clatter of slip-rails let down.
But troopers are sharp, and she saw at a glance
That someone was taking a desperate chance.
They rode, and they shouted, “Surrender, Jack
Dean ! ”
They called him three times in the name of the
Queen.
Then came from the darkness the clicking of locks,
The crack of the rifles was heard in the rocks !
A shriek and a shout, and a rush of pale men
And there lay the bushranger—chancing it then.
The sergeant dismounted and knelt on the sod
“ Your bushranging’s over—make peace, Jack,
with God ! ”
The bushranger laugh’d—not a word he replied,
But turned to the girl who knelt down by his side
He gazed in her eyes as she lifted his head :
“Just kiss me—my girl—and—l’ll—chance it,” ho
said.
Sydney, Juno, ’92.

join the mounted police while others joined the bush-
rangers.

A Prophetic Vision.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In these days, when psychological subjects are
everywhere being discussed with avidity, and
everywhere we find the educated mind becoming
more tolerant of theories and ideas but lately con-
sidered- extravagant and ridiculous, this story
may be told without compunction.
They were a young and comparatively happy
couple, living in a pleasant Melbourne suburb.
He was spoken of, even by the girls he had flirted
with and deserted, as very handsome. He
was fair and florid —a man without pronounced
characteristics. His wife, on the contrary, was
dark and slight, almost thin, with a hectic flush
and strange eyes—strange not from any peculiarity
of mark or setting, but from the effect produced
upon the beholder by a flash from their depths.
She loved her husband and trusted him.
He was a commercial traveller for a large Mel-
bourne warehouse, and in his bachelor days had
■devoted a good deal of time to barmaids and their
wares, but since his engagement and throughout
his ten months of married life his conduct had
been unexceptionable.
Hitherto his work had been confined to the subur-
ban radius, but the illness of another employe ren-
dered it necessary that he should proceed at short
notice to Hamilton, in the firm’s interest, and the
young couple were parted for the first time since
their wedding.
He went away lightly enough, but she, although
silent, was peculiarly oppressed. The young
woman tried to shake off the presentiments of evil
that shadowed her waking hours and visited her
dreams, but without avail, and on the third even-
ing following her husband’s departure, whilst
sitting by the fire in company with an unmarried
sister, she rose up suddenly after a long silence,
in hysteria, and, pointing with a gesture of frenzy
to a dark part of the room, cried out: —
“ Great Heaven ! It is Jack !” and fell to the
floor in a faint.
Upon recovering, she explained in great agita-
tion that she had seen her husband stretched upon
his back on the ground, in a pool of something
that glistened in the moonlight; his face was
white and rigid, and his eyes stared at the stars.
So strong an impression did this make upon the
mind of the young wife that her faculties were
partially numbed as under the influence of a great
grief. She was sure some terrible evil had
befallen her husband, and refused to be put to bed
or to move from the fireside. She would sit there,
she said, till the news came —she was positive that
it would come, and that soon.
She remained there, tearless, with a white, wan
face turned towards the fire, and spoke never a
word to the sister watching opposite, as the hours
went slowly by.
At length a loud knocking at the door disturbed
the painful silence.
The wife did not move; she barely raised her
eyes.
“You go,” she said. “I could not bear it.
Come back to me at once, and tell me all. Hide
nothing—l am prepared for the worst.”
Her sister rose and passed down the passage to
the street door. She returned in a moment, her
eyes full of tears and her lips trembling.
“They are bringing him here,” she said.
The wife rose, and steadied herself against the
table. Her teeth were set firmly, and her hands
clutched the woodwork at her sides.
Two men came in, slowly—painfully ; they bore
a man’s figure between them, and laid it upon the
floor. This was the form of the husband. There
was. a blood stain upon his face, the clothes were
wet, torn, and muddy.
The terrible vision of the poor young wife had
proved too true. Her husband was dead —dead-
drunk.

The Wellington(M.L.)Benevolcnt trustees
send destitute old met) to a subsidised boarding-
house, the inmates whereof, yearning for ham-
and-eggs, hfive just struck against too much break-
fast sausage, and have taken to heaving the whole
lot into the Post newspaper office below. Wild-
eyed reporters are now wallowing in sausage and
saving their slender “screws.”
Ex-Attorncy-General ex-Parson Rutledge,
Queensland, stated recently, at a pious coiVerencc
held in Brisbane, that the awful picture presented
in “ Ctesar’s Column ” would yet be realised “ if
the leavening and sweetening influences of some
such organisations as the Y.M.C.A. were not
pushed on in the woild.” A man like that would
have urged Robespierre to take a drink of ginger-
beer in order to calm himself down and avert the
Revolution.
The first Lord Lytton, we read, had a
strange fondness for personal metamorphoses.
One day he would appear in black , from top to
toe, with a dark-complexioned visage to match.
Another day lie would bo all brown, and on a
third he would be all in white, with blonde hair,
and a fair complexion lighted up with rouge !
Ugh!
Under the heading of “ interesting Items
for Marksmen,” Sydney Echo lays this solemn
fact before its readers : —
A fire occurred recently on one of the moors belonging
to the Duke of Rutland, between the Dove Moore Inn and
Fox House. It is supposed that a spark from a traction
engine hunted the dry bracken and heather, which were
soon fanned into a fierce lire by the strong breeze. Owing
to the very dry state of the fuel, a large tract of moorland
was burned before the fire was extinguished.
Even a little burnt grass 12,000 miles away is
interesting, according to the Sydney Kanaka
organ’s idea, if it belongs to a “Juke.”
Open-air services have been begun by the
English Catholics, after a stoppage of much over
300'years —a very significant move. Tbcjkst was
conducted, quite with state, in Charleston, the
populous Manchester suburb, a few weeks ago, m
connection with Archbishop Vaughan’s translation
from Salford to the Cardinalate of Westminster.
4000 people attended, of all denominations.
Pfahlerts Hotel, Wynyard Square, Sydney.
J. Liohtscheindl, for many years proprietor of the Empire
Hotel, Wellington, N.Z., has taken over the above old
established first-class hotel. The Garden Restaurant is
now ready for the summer months.
To Readers of “The Bulletin.”
“Every man can write at least one book,”every
man with brains has at least one good story to
tell; every man with or without brains moves in
a different circle and knows things unknown to
any other man. Write carefully and plainly on
one side of the paper only, obliterating every un-
necessary word ; then mail your work to Tub
Bulletin, which pays for accepted matter. In
certain of the so-called prize-competitions the
greajt prizes fall to the newspaper-proprietor, who
gets the guileless public to work for him for noth-
ing. Short stories, or ballads, especially on bush,
mining, sporting, social, or dramatic themes, are
preferred by Tub Bulletin ; 1300 words eo to a
column. If you can possibly keep your story
within a column all the bettor Don’t write a
column on any subject if a half-column will do ;
don’t write half-a-eolnmn where a mere paragraph
is enough. “ Boil it down.”
Suggestions for illustration with or without
rough explanatory drawings will ho gladly re-
ceived by Tub Bulletin.
