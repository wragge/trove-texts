'or Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
reatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to ait down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
ononion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.

used and answered they are destroyed by Are,

will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and

SATURDAY, JULY 4, 1891.
The Fall of Maoriland.
The census-returns of Maoriland, as com-
pared to those of Australia, are exceedingly
solemn reading. The people of Maoriland
are about the only nation on earth which has
sobered up after a wild burst of borrowing
and financial drunkenness, and gone through
the awful process of recovery, and the spec-
tacle is an interesting one for several
reasons. It presents the same attractions as
a cemetery does to the aged and the con-
sumptive—-there is a certain dreary pleasure
in looking at the spot to which we are all
going ; and the place to which New Zealand
has gone is, beyond any possible shadow of
doubt, the place which Australia is going to.
The only difference between the two cases
is that the Australian people are more
reluctant than their neighbours to face the
inevitable, and therefore, when they go, they
will go more violently and will fall more
heavily. The ten years that have elapsed since
the census of 1881 have in Maoriland been
years of commercial darkness, unrelieved by
a single one of those riotous circumstances
which are miscalled “signs of progress.”
There has been no increase of population
worth mentioning—the cities, in fact, have
absolutely receded, and though the country
districts have advanced, the total increase
for the whole country is only 40,000 —a
miserable average of 4000 per annum. There
has been no vestige of a land-boom, and
property is worth, in many cases, not very
much more than half what it was a decade
ago. The mining revival fell very flat; the
average mining revival consists of 1 per
cent, genuine mineral and 99 per cent,
stock-exchange swindle, and though the
discoveries of a few years ago fur-
nished the mineral, there was no boom, for
the money for the stock-exchange swindle
was wanting. The Government has built no
new public works—it has even abandoned
some that it inherited in a half-finished con-
dition, and the famous Otago Central Rail-
way is turned into a promenade for cows and
other animals. There have been no new
banks established, for the sufficient reason
that those already in existence have been in
serious danger of foundering; the “Loan and
Mortgage Companies,” and “ Loan and
Mercantile Associations,” and similar insti-
tutions, have led a precarious and unsatis-
factory existence ; and the big Land Com-
panies are more or less on their beam-ends.
There has been no influx of foreign capital,
and no influx of foreign population, and
many thousands of the immigrants which the
Government paid for in the old days, have
cleared out again, leaving nothing but dead
loss behind them. About half the Civil
Service has been discharged, and the Govern-
ment official who remains is harder-worked
than a dock-labourer, and has had his salary
cut down to correspond with his increased
exertions. The Parliamentary honorarium
has been shorn, and the number of legip-
lators reduced in order to avoid the payment
of unnecessary members, and the Governor’s
salary has Been curtailed, and all the old
glory and glitter and wild prosperity of the
country has faded away, leaving nothing but
hard reality in its stead.
* * *
What the people of Australia have as ydt
failed to realise, however, is that this hard
reality is only the normal condition of things,
and that all the garish splendour 'that went
before it was as bogus as a soap-bubble glit-
tering in the sun. 1 lie reality is a little
harder by reason of the boom, and the i'nflffx
of foreign capital, and the other commercial
diseases which preceded it, but that is all.
The slow increase of population is a cause of
general lamentation, but still the population
•is keeping pace with the average increase of
the world at large, and no ’country can
reasonably ask more than that. There is no
reason why the population of the
Australasian States should ’expand with
frenzied rapidity, and it has only done so in
the past because of that feverish state of un-
natural prosperity brought about b.y the
borrowing of foreign money. The fact that
the cities of New Zealand have ceased to
progress, and that the movement is entirely
in the country districts, may seem a painful
circumstance to a nation that expends all its
energies on growing‘one or two huge, bloated
capitals, but as soon as the influx of foreign
cash comes to an end Australia must go
through precisely the same experience, and
the influx of foreign cash must come to an
end sooner or later, unless the whole earth
is coming to this continent for investment.
When Australia is reduced to living upon its
own resources Melbourne and Sydney will
probably commence a process of shrinkage
that will reduce them to not much more than
half their present dimensions. These two
great cities started their wild career of un-
natural obesity when the “influx of foreign
capital ” set in ; while it lasted they
increased fully five times as rapidly
as the country districts ; and without
it they have hardly any visible means of
support whatever. Neither their manufac-
tures nor their commerce are even half suf-
ficient to account for their existence. The
cities, in a land which exists mainly by
agricultural and pastoral pursuits, live by
preying on the country, aud under normal
conditions no pastoral or agricultural country
ever maintains much more than one-fifth of
its population in great urban communities.
In other words, when one-fifth of the popu-
lation lives by interest and commissions and
percentages, the burden is as great as the
country can endure without disaster. Conse-
quently, judged by the experience of other
lands, somewhat less than half the population
of Sydney and Melbourne lives by reason-
ably legitimate means ; the other half exists
mainly on the unnatural increase in the
value of city lands—caused by the influx of
borrowed capital, on booms, mining rackets,
miscellaneous finance, and similar ephemera]
swindles—on lending to each other money
that doesn’t belong to them, and in selling
to each other that kind of non-existent
wealth which is created in a night by print-
ing scrip, and which fades away again in the
morning ; and on buying from each other
gold that neither of them ever saw, and pay-
ing for it with money that neither of them
ever had. But when the influx of foreign
capital ceases half these nondescript trades
and professions will vanish away. Then the
country must come down to grim fact, and
live on cold realities, and when the people of
Maoriland were brought face to face with
this state of things about a hundred ship-
loads of financiers and commission agents,
clerks, money-lenders, auctioneers, land-
brokers, share - brokers, money - brokers,
patent agents, and similar hangers-on quitted
the country in disgust, and left the cities
empty. This state of things was erroneously
described as commercial depression, but the
term was hopelessly inaccurate. The real
explanation was that in the day of the
country’s financial insanity every man who
worked had to support another man who
loafed in an office, and the period of alleged
depression was the period when the nation
recovered its intelligence and got rid of its
loafers.
# # #
The ruinous falling off in the Maoriland
banking industry has also been cited as an
evidence of depression, when in reality it
was merely a proof that the country was at
last becoming sober, and when Australia
sobers up in the same way there will be the
same smash among the banking institutions
of this country. Maoriland, in the days
of its joyous intoxication, ran three great
local banks with scores of branches, and
helped to maintain half-a-dozen exotic estab-
lishments which also spread out like an
octopus throughout the country. Also it
supported about a dozen huge financial com-
panies, and a host of building societies, most
of which did a certain amount of banking
business, The population of the country
was less than 600,000, and there were banks
enough for 6,000,000 ; in fact, if all the in-
habitants of the province had deposited all
the money and discounted all the good paper
they possessed twice every day, there was
not sufficient legitimate business in the
country to keep these institutions going.
But they lived by the old, old device of bor-
rowing foreign capital, and lending it out
to the misguided native inhabitant upon
mortgage, and so long as the foreign capital
came in land-values went up, and while they
went up interest also ascended. The miser-
able agriculturist whose land was reasonably
Hvorth £lOOO, saw it rise to £2OOO under the
influence of this financial fever ; and then he
borrowed £lOOO at 10 per cent., and in the
course of 10 joyous years he had paid it all
away in interest. And about that time the
falling-in of the Public Works Policy broke
up the great rush of foreign'capital in one
act, and the land went back to its true esti-
mate,' and was barely worth the mortgage-
money which had been borrowed and repaid
and yet remained to be repaid 6ver again.
Then both borrowers ; and lenders came to
grief, for the former were left Ipenniless ;
while the latter foreclosed and kept on fore-
'Closing until they found that they had bought
up half Maoriland with foreign capital.
And as they had to pay interest oh the
foreign capital, while their leagues of bank-
rupt property paid them nothing, the great
banking industry became eminently pre-
carious, if not actually ruinous. It ivas the
only possible result that cc/uld ensue, and it
is exactly the same result which must ensue
in Australia when the financial drunk of the
last 25 years comes to an end. A portentous
smash among the Australian banks and
financial institutions, a huge falling off in the
.population of the great Australian cities, and
a tremendous fall in land-values, will be the
first sure signs that this country is at last
beginning to live on its own industry, instead
of on its lOU, as heretofore.
* * *
Maoriland, within the last ten years,
has sent ont a good many more emigrants
than it has received, and—despite the public
lamentation which would inevitably ensue—
it would be well for Australia if it had clone
likewise. The stoppage of immigration
means that the Maori islands are no longer
an attractive field for General Booth’s
'“reformed criminals,” for the surplus thou-
sands Who now over-crowd the cities of Eng-
land, and who want to over-crowd the cities
of Australasia instead, for the cast-off
“remittance-man,” and the übiquitous
“ fool of the family.” As for the exported
inhabitants, Maoriland has lost very little
of the bone and sinew of its population ; it
counts some 50,000 more hardy miners and
agriculturists than it did ten years ago, and
it has fired out many thousands of city men
—of lawyers, clerks, financiers, brokers,
stone - brokers, merchants, shopkeepers,
bookkeepers, hotel-keepers, money-lenders,
betting-men, and others who live on the
community, yet add practically nothing to
the national wealth. Most of these have
drifted to Australia, which now—by virtue
of the bogus prosperity which is born of
foreign capital supports the aggregate
loafers of Grey’s country in addition to its
own. And when, through the blessing of
Providence, Australia comes to grief in like
manner, it will pass these acquisitions on to
some foreign shore, and send along with
them 100,000 or more of land-boomers, pro-
perty-agents, barristers, solicitors, convey-
ancers, building-society directors, bankers,
patent-medicine liars, book-agents, impor-
ters, civil service dudes, superfluous railway
employes, pawnbrokers, preachers, bagmen,
totalisator and racing-sweep fakirs, pedlars,
fan-tan experts, and others ; and by thus
wrecking its boasted census returns it will
create a better and a stronger nation out of
what is left.
* # #
In a country which, unlike England, has
no great income from foreign investments,
the annual exports and imports are a fair
criterion of the national progress. Despite
all the elaborate theories of Freetrade
economists the one unanswerable argument
remains—the exports of a country are the
means by which it pays for its imports, and
therefore when the imports are in excess the.
country necessarily runs in debt to the ex-
tent of the balance. At present the exports
of Australia require to be some £14,000,000
per annum ahead of the imports in order to
pay the interest on public and private debts
and yet keep the balance even ; in reality
they are some £10,000,000 behind, which
means that every year Australia owes
£24,000,000 more than it did the year
before. In the days of its alleged prosperity
Maoriland occupied a very similar situa-
tion ; in the present day of alleged
adversity it is reducing its external liabili-
ties by some £3,000,000 per annum. It is
enabled to do this mainly by the fact that
its country population—which produces
the national wealth—is expanding, while
the city population—which produces little
and consumes much—is slowly undergoing a
decline. And Australia must get square by
the same process—or else repudiate; the
choice lies between the wholesale con-
fiscation of foreign capital, or a hideous
■ shrinkage in the inflated, overgrown, much-
boasted cities of this continent. Two such
places as Sydney and Melbourne cannot be
maintained, on cash principles, by the scanty
population of two empty provinces, and
because these communities are proportion-
ately much larger than Auckland, Christ-
church, or Dunedin, the inevitable falling
off will be all the greater. Possibly it will
be better for Australia that the ruin should
come. New South Wales and Yictoria are
both ruled by the useless non-producers of
the two great capitals. They are governed
by landlords, importers, lawyers,’financiers,
and bankers—in other words, they are
governed by the men who were artificially
created through foreign capital. And when
the foreign capital ceases to flow in, as it has
already done in Maoriland, and the useless
cities that were built by its agency begin to
find their true level, half the birds of prey
whose plural votes now rule the State will
light olifc for other shores, and a good pro
potticrii of the remaining half will take a£n
axe apiece, and go to the woods, arid beednie
of some use to humanity fdr the first tinie.
“Representative Government!” What
It Has Done.
ThAt wonderfully mediocre person, who crops'up
rather unexpectedly in One of the works of
Herbert Spencer as “ Albert the Respectable,”
once observed that “Representative Government
was on its trial.” This prolific and imich-puffed
German princelet, unlike Charles 11. of obscene
memory, “never did a wise thing,” and said
foolish things as the sand on the seashore fdr
multitude. The above is to be taken as one of
the latter, but the irdny of the unexpected and
the evolution of history have given the phrase A
meaning, utterly different to that which its utterer
intended, but most profoundly true.

The rule, and by rule we merin the despotic
rule, of the genuine British aristocrats dates fridtii
the expulsion of the Stuarts, and the e'ollapse of
the ridiculous “divine tight of kings ” theory,fn
the so-called “Great Revolution ”'of IXSBB. The
genuine British aristocrats Vvei'e the colossal land-
owners—the tarett who still survive in the shape
of the Dukes 'Of Westminster and the Dukes of
Devonshire.' These men used the popular revolt
Against the secular and religions tyranny of
Charles 11. and Jame s 11., or the Puritan
revival, for their own utteily selfish class interests.
There were to be no more Cromwells and Com-
monwealths,'thank you, with shopmen or yeomen
or artisans rising to become admirals like Blake,
or generals like Ireton, or Protectors’ private
secretaries like Milton. ‘No ; the country was to
be run by the colossal landlords and for the
colossal landlords, Whose yoUngbr sons were to
administer army, naval and civil service as the
organised soldiers and police of their grace's arid
their lordships. From lt>Bß 'to 183-2 —almost A
century and a-half—this despotic rule lasted.
'# % *
The results Were briefly these : : A corruption of
the legislature, which, under its supreme manipu-
lator, Lord Walpole, reached a'pitch unparalleled
AaVe in the rottenest days of Roman and Spanish
aristocrat corruption, the days of Verres and tile
monsters of the Inquisition. Almost all the
new great private . fortunes date from this
period, and Smith, the contractor, whose descen-
dant is the downy Lord Cakington of to-day,
may stand as a familiar type of the novi homines,
or brand-neW nobles who arose from the plunder
of the people. So much for the interior adminis-
tration. Externally we have to note the wars arid
their result in that monstrous so-called “ National
Debt,” whose millions of interest drag annually
at the throat of the contemporary British tax-
payer. The National Debt, a device whereby the
dominant class could wage war purely in its oWtt
interests, and lay the whole burden of the cost
thereof on the nations, dates from the “gbeat
Revolution.” Of these wars the one Which
wa3. the most prodigious and shameless Write
the relentless war waged against the French
Republic and its oofttineater, the Empire, the Wat
which broke the French naval poVver at Trafalgar
and its military power at Waterloo, arid introdiiced
England and the eoritineht to the iniquities of the
Holy Alliance arid the partition ‘of Boland arid
Italy,
* * *
The Ererich Republic was the protagonist of the
Rights of Matt. It preached “Liberty, Equality
and Fraternity.” It is still customary for the
English to speak of Napoleon as an ambitious
tyrant, and Waterloo as the glory of a
free people that overcame a people of
slaves. This, now, in the impartial light
of History, grows thin even to emaciation !
The Code Napoleon, which is still the) law of
France and which France has clung to pas-
sionately through Restorations and constitu-
tional Monarchies and bastard Empires and
bastard Republics—which the German Rhine
provinces have clung to equally passionately, and
which rules even to-day in German Alsace and
Lorraine instead of the German law ! —this Code,
which we hope to see Australia adopt almost
in its entirety during our own lifetime,
is the most stupendous legislative effort after
equality the world has yet seem It makes ah
equal division of land and wealth amonga man’s
children compulsory. It strangles entail with one
hand and disinheritance with another, and makes
huge estates all but an impossibility. Similarly
the civil and military administration of Napoleon
was an equally stupendous effort after liberty and
fraternity, and (to use the Emperor’s splendid
words) “ La carriere ouverte aux talens ” —tools for
the hand that can use them! He took farmers
and workmen, as Cromwell had done, and made
them colonels or generals, magistrates or
ministers, princes or kings. Is it any wonder
thatthearistocraticcountries —England, Germany,
Austria, Russia—where birth alone made possible
rule, military, naval or civil, would not—could
not —rest tili this man had conquered them or
they him ?
* # •
The vast bulk of the English “National ” Debt,
then, is the history of the frantic and at last
successful effort of the British aristocrats to over-
come Napoleon, and the ideas he incarnated, and
strangle republican France into humility. This
debt was not all merely expenditure on the army
and the navy. It came also from the gigantic
subsidies paid by England to its miserable allies,
the kingly cut-throats of Berlin, Vienna and St.
Petersburg. Well, at last they succeeded.
Napoleon was sent to be worried to death in St.
Helena, and France trembled under a throne
supported by foreign bayonets, and Europe was
“ at peace.”
# # #
So much for the rule of the genuine British
aristocrats. By 1815, however, the date of
Watei’loo, the brand-new aristocrats had added
solidity to the body and force to the ener-
vated souls of their dissolute predecessors and
partners. But more! The potent middle-class,
the shop-keepers, had come upon the scene. Their
power, though real, was wholly unrepresented in
the legislature no less than in the services.
Napoleon called England a nation of shop-
keepers, because he saw that it was from
the shop-keeping class that the floods of wealth
which paid her soldiers and sailors and subsidized
those of her allies proceeded. 1 le did not see that
the middle-class was then merely the tool of the
aristocracy. And for long the middle-class did
not see it. Then began its awakening, and with
it the horn of the final agitation against “ rotten
boroughs.” “Rotten boroughs” were boroughs
returning the nominees of the great nobles.
Originally they had been under the control of the
Crown, that is, from their foundation under
Edward VI. (1547) right up to the expulsion of
the Stuarts and the fall of the power of the kings.
The middle-class had the numbers on their side,
and they had plenty of money. The result of the


bombat could not, then, long be doubtful. In
1832, accordingly, after having used thb Masses
as their cats’-paw in all the more dangerous parts
Of the Work, the aristocrats gave way ; the Reform
Bill was passed, the Masses swindled by a pro-
perty qualification which deprived them of the
power to vote, and the middle-class entered on its
co-rule with the aristocracy. Thus the Houses of
Lords and Commons, as we at present know them
were formed, and when the late lamented Albert
the Respectable made that foolish remark with
Which we opened, he meant that'this new arrange-
ment was then “on its trial.
#' # #
Over half-a-cehtury has passed since this neW
was initiated, and its results are now
hatfeht to all; The trial has ended either this
way o’r that, so’ far,- either in failure or in success.
Let its co’nsldet this, the rule of the middle-class,
m the, sairie simple,’ historical Manner as we have
considered the former iule, the rule t>f the aris-
tocrats. < ,
* * *
In 1815; then; followed what is called “The
(Treat Peace.” The Continental peoples, the!
peoples of France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and
Austria, were resolutely held down and almost
the whole energy of men’ was cast into the new
forms of industry. Machinery made its appear-
ance, and the creation’ of' wealth received an
impetus unparalleled' in all history. More sheer
Wealth has been created ih the last half ceritury
than in any other five, or even ten centuries.
This is the distinctive feature of our age—though
theoretic and applied science, the discoveries of
the great Scientists, and the application of these
discoveries by the great mechanicians'. The result’
tias beeil remarkable. In the old Feudal days
itte colossal land-owners supported Vast armies of
fetainefi? Who' gaVri td them their services as
Soldiers in return fOr shelter, food, and’ general
protection. Machinery, by enabling the rich to
offer \yhat appeared’ to be fcjfo means of independ-
ence to the m'asses', seemed to harmonise at once
the modern demands fof iridivithial freedom and
for the nevv impetus of the creation 1 Of wealth.
Capital and Labour became the “two utterly dis-
tinct entities” of Adam Smith and the race of
“ political economists ” which culminated in John
Stuart Mill and his crowd of attendant satellites,
# * *
O potent and damnable fallacy! This is the
distinction between Capital and Labour. Among
the old feudal retainers the principle of compe-
tition was dormant. They had certain work to
do and duties to perform, and in return they were
secure of decent maintenance. Not*so among the
modern Masses ! Competition being unrestricted,
diorfe arid ttlore did the wretched men sacrifice the
iVorth 6f their work to the ever-increasing
Exigencies 8i existence resultant in improvements
of machinery arid thfe condensation of Labour.
Capital scooped in! thfe riett total of the sacrifice,
and the New Slavery Was aSn established fact.
Were the old feudal 1 lords tyrants 1 Perhaps so,
but at lpa'st they housed arid fed therf; slaves,
whereas the new capitalists washed their hrinds of
qyerything but the payment of these “wages,”
which left these “Britons who iiriVep (never,'
never !) would be slaves ” to’ toil arid starve and
rot to death as they pleased ! And all the while,
the Press rang with the paeans of “unexampled
progress,” “liberty and the same laws for all,”
and (final acme and apotheosis of a “Christian
civilisation !”) “ Representative Government /”
* * *
Thus that gigantic and terrible process, a pro-
cess which even the new Staffords have blessed
as meeting the ideal policy of “ thorough,” began
—the process of the degradation of Labour ! The
very commercial slang terms bore witness to it.
People spoke no longer of workmen in the fac-
tories : they were only “hands.” What, verily?
Had you drilled the hearts and souls out of them
so well as that? Yea, verily, and, what is more,
the heads also. For the masses were the numbers,
and these millions of sheep who sought the capi-
talistic shears with such a stupid stoicism, held
also the remedy. True, they made some efforts
against their fate. Bands of starving, desperate
men went about the country breaking machines
when the capitalistic trick was first sprung upon
them. But aristocratic lord and middle-class
commoner ancient noble, brand-new noble,
gentleman, shopman, priest—all were utterly at
one In putting down a “ lawlessness ” which
threatened not only the present case but the
stupendous future prosperity which was just
drawing oh their intelligences, That prosperity
was only possible by means of machinery, and,
therefore, for Machinery they (backed up by their
Soldiers, sailors, and police) Would perish ! There
Was (happily) no need for that, They had only to
deal With a ttiob of mad dogs, and the “special
Constables ” Of 1848 are the notable predecessors of
the great Exhibition of 1852, when one of their
dumber, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, the
debauched scoundrel Who had Meantime “ waded
through blood to a throrie,” inaugurated in France,
as our precious Queen and her mutton-headed
Consort did in England, the neW Holy Alliance
Of Birth and Capital against strangled and
degraded Labour.
# * *
Labour’s next efforts seemed at last in si better
direction, in the direction of organisation and drill.
These efforts we know by the name of Trades
Unionism. Trades Unionism meant the first
attempt at co-operation of the thousand oppressed
small units against the one oppressing big
unit. But how hopelessly restricted was its pro-
gramme from the very start, and how doomed to
ultimate failure ! Trades Unionism never faced
the great initial iniquity of the plunder of Labour
bv competition wages. Trades Unionism never
held up the banner of the cause of Labour one
and indivisible. All Trades Unionism then tried
to do was to keep up wages where they were, and
to save the skilled workmen. It tinkered the
old, worn-out kettle, and by letting a part of
Labour, large in itself but comparatively quite
small, enjoy a mild competency, robbed Labour
as a whole of its best men—formed an aristocratic
class in its own ranks to trample on the
mass below it—put off the (lay of a final
reckoning for a whole generation, and
made the victory of the middle-class utter
and complete. It did more and worse! As
the tide of democracy—and that is the tide of
Labour—slowly rose, this better class took the
brib9 of an extended franchise to support the
aristocrat and the middle-class in retaining the
abominable status quo, They took this bribe from
Disraeli in the Reform Bill of 1807, and they
gave him his Imperialistic and Jingo Dictatorship
of six years, from 1874 to 1880,
# # *
This is the history of “Representative Govern-
ment,” the history of the degradation of Labour !
A.nd what a success it has been, what a success
for the robbers, great and small, whose ease and
wealth has sprung from it ! The toiling and
starving millions—the London labourer and the
country agricultural labourer reduced to the level
of brute beasts—man, wife, and ohildun to be
; upported on a wage which averages under 10s.
a week—a great swarming mass of stupid and
debauched humanity, these are the foundations
On Which is reared “ the stately edifice of- British'
liberty,” “the Unexampled progress,” “ the
justibe and mercy of a Christian civilisation of
Representative Government /” Representative
Government ? Representative of what ? Take
the roll of its legislators issued by the PALI Mali,
Gazette, and run it through. Out of the 600 and
odd men who make up its House of Commons, will
you l find 40 who have not been l educated at the
English public-schools—at Eton, Harrow”, Rugby,
Marlborough, and the like? Will you-find five
genuine working-men? You will not! Gentle-
men and rich shopkeepers, these and* none but
these; lawyers, officers, and men of leisure of
the aristocratic schools, aiid the tribe of capitalists
and- employers, these are 99 per cent, of this
‘ Representative Government.” But what Aus-
trahan needs to be assured of this when* he can see
with his own eyes' the class of men* who have
hitherto represented bmf Squatters, law-
yefs, doctors, employers, commission-agent's, these
are out Australian equivalents, and what are they
but a* lower-grade replica of their English fellows?-
# #* *
This is the fiistoty, the pitiful history,- of the
degradation of Labour in England and the rule
of the middle-class and “Representative Govern-
ment.” It is the same in Americait* was
rapidly becoming the same in Australia.- “On
trial,” O 5 prolific, much-puffed and mfitfon-
beaded German Princelet ? Nay, on itsr trial no
longerapparent as the rtiost hateful of all
tyrannies the world has ever seen, the mill that
bas ground men slowly and surely to powder,
qq ie apathy of the sacrificed masses is passing,
Labour arouses itself to make Democracy, the
power of tlie People, felt and feared. Despair is
a rude but thorough educator. The hour of final
reckoning comes closer. It comes closer in
Europe. It comes closer in America*. It comes
closer in Australia. “So completely,” says Henry
George—HenryGeorge, the man of “law and
order” and “ constitutional methods so com-
pletely has representation passed out of the hands
pf the American people, that it can never be
regained, perhaps, except by a revolution.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
"Betterment.”
The Victorian Railway Commission lias dug out
a curious little circumstance which is of interest
not only to the people of Victoria, but to those
of all Australia. It has ascertained, in an acci-
dental sort of way, that the money that has
been borrowed to build the Victorian railways
has all been borrowed unnecessarily—that aU
the load of indebtedness is a fraud and a swin-
dle—and that a good deal more than £30,000,000
has befeii fooled away in one little province
through Wefe idiocy and embezzlement and
general " Alid as the facts on which
tliis conclusion is based apply equally to New
South Walds,- Queensland, and the other States
of Australasia, the natural inference is that
£150,000,000, or thereabouts, lials beet# scattered
quite unnecessarily, and that the entire load of
indebtedness is a dead loss from beginning to'
end. The basis of calculation is very simple.
While investigating one of the many expensive
and unprofitable railways in the vicinity of
Melbourne, it was ascertained that this line—
which was paid for by the nation —had boomed
the adjacent property to such an extent that
the entire cost of the work might have been
charged, on the betterment principle, to one
big landholder alone, and still that worthy
citizen would have been £400,000 to the good.
From this point some further investigations led
to the conclusion that all the justifiable railways
of the province might have been built by levy-
ing assessments on the proprietors of land in
the vicinity, and the increase in values caused
directly by these railways would have not only
covered the assessments, but would have left these
same proprietors much richer than they were
before j and no doubt the situation is much the
same in other parts of the continent. In other
words, the country should have got its railways
for nothing ; there should have been no debt at
all; the income derived from the lines should
have been so much clear profit to the revenue ;
and the landholders who paid for these lines
would still have been richer than if they had
not been constructed and paid for. Instead of
this, however, the railway system has been a
dead loss twice over. When £1,000,000 was
spent by the country on building a new line,
the adjacent landlords straightway started
selling their lands to the unhappy taxpayers
at £2,000,000 advance—in other words, the
people paid £1,000,000 for the railway, and
because they had done this, they had to pay
£2,000,000 more for the privilege of living
where they could have the use of it. Then the
landlord, being enriched by the £1,000,000
spent by the nation on improving his property,
and by the £2,000,000 which the nation had to
pay afterwards for the privilege of giving away
the £1,000,000, most probably invested the
loot and then started for “ Home and now
the country owns a railway which is a dead
loss, and pays interest on £3,000,000 for the
jov and gratification of possessing this loss.
The Victorian Commission is now trying
to formulate some scheme whereby there
will be no more borrowing for railway
purposes, and all new lines will be charged to
the adjacent landholders, and even this arrange-
ment-should it be carried into effect—will
leave the Victorian land-shark in a remarkably
good position. The thirty millions or so which
the people have given him in the past is
obviously irrecoverable, and the other thirty
millions which he has made by adding insult to
injury is also gone beyond repair. And if, in
the future, he be required to pay the entire cost
of railway construction, he can do so and still
make 50 or 100 per cent, profit on the outlay.
Under the Land Nationalisation principle, not
only would the land pay for the railways and
leave the country without any debt whatever,
but the additional value gained by these im-
provements would extinguish all other taxation,
and place the State in affluence. In other
words, instead of Australasia having a railway-
debt of some £150,000,000 it should own the
railways and be something over £150,000,000 to
the good in addition. The dicsrepancy between
these figures is just three hundred millions, and
the landlords of Australia, Tasmania, and Maori-
land have scooped the lot.
Latter-Day Bigotry.
Let us revert to a> subject the serious cUscussioni
of which is,, wa admit,.am insult to human intolr
ligence. The other day a youth, who was lilting,
in a sentence of three years at Pen triage,
tired of the weary panorama of white-washed;
walls and iron bars, and resolved to cut the
matter short by suicide. His life had been a
failure all through, however, and his hanging
was ore a par with the-rest of it,,for it failed
also. He was cut down by a> benevolent official,,
and when the visiting justices came round they
“ considered.” his case,*and passed a> sentence or
12 months’ additional imprisonment,, and M
days’ “solitary” for “insubordination.
Possibly the clam-headed individuals who passed
this sentence believed that if a? prisoner was
tired of life 12 months’ imprisonment ancl.l4 days
“ solitary ” was just the thing to* cheer hinv<up
and make him desire to live —that it was just
the thing which would deter from-, suicide
any other prisoner whose brain had given way
and who longed for death—there is nothing
on this earth that is absolutely impossible with
a 1 visiting magistrate. The eminent gaol* official
in the Australian novel, “ Moondyne,” had a
female prisoner flogged within an inch of her
life for not praying, and when she found that
she’ had either to pray or to keep* on being
flogged-,» she started praying right off'. Still
there are some objections to such a process. In
the present eas®' the prisoner gets 12 months
because he is not of the same religious opinions
as the magistrates who* sentenced biniy. and the
magistrate who uses his authority to* jump on
another man on account of his religion is the
meanest kind of a persecutor, and ought to have
had a-billet to heat the*pincers and oil the rack
in the' Inquisition. The magistrate himself
didn’t commit suicide, either because lie; was too-
comfortable in’ this world to want to take any
unnecessary risks in ! another, or else because
his religion stood' in the way-—and in order to
give him the benefit of the doubt, and-to*make
him look a shade less contemptible, we will
assume the latter to have been the reason.
The prisoner (if sane—it would lie horrible
brutality to send to “solitary "’ an insane
prisoner) attempted suicide, on the other hand,
because his religion did not stand in the way.
There is absolutely not one objection to suicide
except the objection that is based on religion,
and, therefore, the difference between the two
men was a purely religious difference. If the
magistrate had been a Wesleyan, and bad
ordered the prisoner to be flogged for being a
Presbyterian, bis conduct would not have been
one shade less mean or stupid or narrow-minded
or irrational. The theory that the offender’ got
his additional sentence for “insubordination
is mere hypocrisy, because his insubordination
consisted entirely of the one circumstance that
his religious views, or his want of religious
view’s, allowed him to attempt self-destruction
—in other words, he broke tlie gaol regulations
by* not believing in a blazing Slieol to come, and
if the regulations demanded that he should
believe in Slieol then they are an unspeakable
disgrace, and the men who enforce them are
another. Tlie one rational view of the ease is
this —Every human being has a right to hang or
drown or poison himself if be wants to. The
law* allows him to kill himself slowly with
drink—so long as he doesn’t become a nuisance
in the process —or tobacco, or by over-eating,
or by painting the city red on winter nights
and catching cold as a consequence; and it
allows him to lose his soul—if he has a soul—
and to go to Gehenna—if there is any Gehenna
—by being an atheist, or an agnostic, or a prize
bigot, or a hypocrite. And if the State has
any possible business to arrest a man for trying
to lose his body and his soul—providing he has
a soul, as above-mentioned—at the end of a
rope, then it is the duty of the State to flog
the atheist and imprison the bigot for risking
their souls, and to imprison influenza and
prospective bronchitis. And as the law has just
sense enough not to do these things it thereby
acknowledges that every man has a right to
die when he feels so inclined. The magistrate
who sends any man to gaol for attempted
suicide is a persecutor of the old inquisitorial
type, and, except that he has only half the
courage of his convictions, the difference
between him and Torquemada is not worth
swearing at.

Bed-headed Women and the Franchise.
Here is a conundrum for that alleged states-
man, Premier Munro. Munro declares him-
self to be a believer in the extension of suffrage
to all women, but because it is needful, in such
cases, to insert “ the thin end of the wedge,” he
suggests making a beginning by granting the
suffrage to women with property, and after-
wards extending the system by degrees. Now*,
allowing for the sake of peace, and out
of respect for old - established drivel, that
there is any w*edge at all, w’ould it not be an
equally sane proceeding to break the shock to
the public by extending tlie suffrage to red-
headed women first, and then let in other
shades of females by slow instalments ? Unless
Munro is a bigger ass than he looks, and this
seems hardly probable, he must be aware that
a woman with money doesn’t necessarily know’
more than a woman without money; and
therefore the only merit of his plan is that it
lets the public down gently, by not shoving
all the women in at once. He would get exactly
the same result by extending the franchise to
red-headed ladies, and as there are females with
flame-coloured locks in all stations of life he
would thereby give all classes an equal show.
Or, again, lie might tone things down by ex-
tending the suffrage to girls with warts as a first
start, or to unmarried women aged 50, or to
women w*howere dead broke, or to widow’s over
(or under) a certain age. All these schemes would
equally insert the thin end of that much-
drivelled-about wedge, and there is as much
sense in confining the suffrage to women with
warts as to women with dirt —which is earth,
otherwise called Property. But it is one of the
great evidences of the old-established abase-
ment of humanity that very few seem to see the
screaming absurdity of giving anybody a \ote
because that person has dirt. Even the
opponents of the principle only oppose it—they
hardly ever laugh at it, and yet the idea is so
hideously absurd that if Munro really means it
seriously he oqgliti to be shoved; into a lunatic
asylum.. In,fact, the man,who. would propose
such a thing ought to be- madi enough tp be
ahov,edi into, six, lunatip asylums.

this temerity on. the part of the squattocratic
press is tempered with the salve of. a little bom,-
bastic praise, and the contumacious shearer is-
adhdsed that—
If such a thing should happen again these- ean he no-

employers- far more than they or any other o£ our wage-
earning. Glasses have yet suffered through similar causes,
heavily as that has been.— Sydsby D.T.
That threat cannot scare off destiny.. The-
workers may,, and very probably will,, suffer,
worst at the first, but their goal is a glorious
victory at last. The threat had been preceded
by a very misleading statement as to the result
of the late maritime strike :
It has failed to bring any advantage whatever to th,
strikers, while inflicting injury upon them alt and,
plunging many, in distress from which they have not yet
recovered..
It has brought this- advantage to- the workers,,

Labour has been effectually aroused to a full;
sense of its wrongs a>nd its power* In the words
of the D.T., Labour unionism—
Has come to be regarded as-a dangerous and tyrannical,
force.
Employers’ unionism, of course-, is a healthy
and desirable force. The admission is signifi-
cant. It has been wrung from capitalists by
the triumphs at the polls of the Labour-party
in New South Wales. The voice of the ballot-
box is the answer of the people to- the insolent
arrogance that says—
They (the squatters) insist upon drawing their future
supply of labour from wherever it may be obtainable.
And until their right in this respect is fully conceded by
the unions they decline to enter into Conference with,
them.
Let them “ insist.” They can’t Gatling-gun a
Legislature in which Labour determines the
balance of power, and they arc not such fools
as not to know it. The rest is skite. There
will be a Conference right enough.

Bursting the Big Estates.
The Australian democracy is coming uppermost,
and the old, stereotyped politicians are bidding
for the support of the masses whom they have
hitherto held in such small esteem. Parkes’
old, mildewed, moth-eaten Local Government
Bill, and his newly-borrowed “ One Man One
Vote” scheme, and his shapeless, undefinable
project for improving the relations between
Capital and Labour, are all baits for the
suffrages of the Labour party. Munro’s de-
clared intention of taking that hazy thing
commonly defined as “steps” to minimise the
influence of wealth in the Legislature is a means
to the same end. And now the lumbering and
ponderous Playford, of South Australia, w hose
clumsiness has been the subject of so many
jibes, has gone one better than either of these,
and struck a brighter inspiration than Pakkek
and Munro combined. His war-cry is the
bursting up of the big estates —the same politi-
cal whoop which did Graham Berry so much
service long ago—and if the reality is anything
like the promise Playford intends to go the
whole of that animal which the average big
estate-owner so much resembles. He proposes
that no large landed property shall he handed
down by inheritance—it must he cut up and
sold in small allotments; and as a provision
against the formation of new estates out of the
fragments of the old ones he undertakes to im-
pose a tax on all newly-formed properties of
over 500 acres, which will blast the proprietor
financially, and make him wish that he had
never been born. This proviso will meet the
case of the individual landholder, and in order
to deal with the great land conspirators,
banks, mortgage companies and the like, it is
intended to give to tenants the right to pur-
chase their holdings at a valuation either with or
without the concurrence of the bloated pro-
prietors of the soil. Further, in case the
tenants should he unable to exercise this right
to any great extent, the Government intends to
resume the overgrown properties which are
now being held for a rise by all manner of joint-
stock absentees, and fix the compensation by
arbitration, and trade them off again—
Parliament will probably grant long leases
and not sell at all—in small allotments,
on easy terms. This scheme is not Social-
ism, neither is it Land Nationalisation,
but* still it is very decent Liberalism. It
recognises the principle that the landlord can-
not °do what he likes with the land simply
because lie has bought it, because land is
essential to existence, and the rights of man are
of more account than a Torrens’ title. It is
also an unfee 1 ing attack on the great axiom of
Monopoly that unwritten axiom according to
which any man entitled to kill oft a whole
community by making a “corner in food or
water or air, and holding these substances for
a rise, always provided he has acquired them in
due legal form. And, though Playford is as
far from being a reformer as Parkks or Munro,
it is a favourable sign that the nation is shoving
him into new paths The Democratic force
that can push a man of his size in front of it
is a thing of might, and is strong "'Vmgh to
shunt mountains and elephants and tons of lead
off their bases, and’to butt old vested interests
into the ?ea, and to move even the oldest and
heaviest of Conservatives into a better frame of
mind

The first Queensland loan—the one which was
floated in 1866—has just been paid off by the
simple process of borrowing some more money
to pay it with, and the country has now a
chance to figure out the profits on the trans-
action. In 1866 Queensland sold securities to
the amount of £1,170,950 on the London
market, which brought in actual cash about
£l,ooo,ooo—in other words, a trifle over one-
tenth of the money vanished in discount and
“accrued interest,” or, on a rough estimate,
about £120,000. The interest was 6 per cent.,
at which rate Queensland paid some £1,576,500
tor the use of the money it actually got, and
about £IBO,OfKI for the alleged use of the money
it didn’t get. Then, wlTen the loan expired, it
became necessary to raise a new loan to pay off
the old one, and this new loan is also at 10 per
cent, discount—in other words, Queensland
borrows about £1,300,000 to pay off the original
sum of £1,000,000, and after another spell it
will probably become necessary to borrow
£1,500,000 to pay off the £1,300,000, and so on
ad infinitum. Meanwhile, the situation stands
thus : Queensland raised a little over £1,000,000
in actual cash, and it has already paid £2,000,000
in interest and commissions for the use of it,
and it still owes the original amount as much
as ever ! This isn’t bad for a 25 years’ record.
\\ hat a truly blessed thing is the influx of foreign
capital !
The Ballarat “mutiny, 5 which promised to
result in several hundred able-bodied men being
rescued from that state of mental darkness of
which an uniform is the outward visible sign,
has not turned out a blessing for the country,
after all. Fora time Major-General Tri.LOCH
and his mob of gaudy incubi swore great oaths
under their cocked liats to the effect that the
whole Ballarat militia must be disbanded—-yes,
disbanded, bai Jove ! —and made a shocking
example of. Two hundred of the men had
refused to “ fall in,” or something, so Tcllock
would have to go down to the scene of this
awful disgrace, and say—“ Men of the 3rd
Victorian Regiment, you are no longer soldiers
of the Queen, nothing is left for you
lint suicide, or a lingering death from re-
morse.” Then it slowly dawned upon the dull
regimental minds of these snorting “authori-
ties ’ that nobody wished a lot of militia not to
be disbanded, or would care if there were no
army left. Likewise, Tullooh and Co. began to
reflect that the colonels and things w r ho clatter
round in charge of the disaffected troops would
be suddenly thrown upon the bleeding country’s
hands, as it were, if the troops retired into
private life. So it was decided to give the 3rd
Regiment one more chance to wipe out the
aforementioned disgrace. Major-General Tul-
loch ordered a solemn ‘ ‘ compulsory ” parade
(from which 134 men stayed away) and then
told each man in turn that he w r as a noble fellow
who musn’t be disbanded on any account,
because he was so phenomenally loyal and broad
across the chest. After which another profes-
sional blatherskite asked all the men who had
mutinied to step forward and save this magnifi-
cent regiment from disbandment—he knowing
perfectly well that 134 malcontents hadn’t
turned up to step forward. Whereupon 51 of
those present stood out and grinned, which so
affected Tullooh that he wept, saying these 51
were nobler Romans than the others, but every-
body was as noble as possible, and, thank God !
they wouldn’t be disbanded. Then the 3rd
Regiment laughed in its sleeve and the Heavens
groaned aloud.

Governor Kintore has drawn up a report
about his hurried rush across the continent,
and presented the document to the S.A. Govern-
ment. “He considers that in the present circum-
stances it would be ruinous for South Australia
to construct a trans-continental railway, but
recommends that the work be given to a land-
grant syndicate. ” Now, in the first place, it is
no part of Kintoke’s business to consider any-
thing ; he is paid principally for his entire
want of consideration. Secondly, he has
nothing whatever to do with the circum-
stances; they aren’t his circumstances, and he
isn’t fit to judge a circumstance, anyhow.
Thirdly, the land-grant syndicate racket is the
vilest swindle alive, and it would cost the
country ten times more in the end than it would
to make the trans-continental railway at the
cost of the Treasury. It is a device by
which a syndicate gets several million acres of
land for making its own railway, and it
also gets the land required for railway pur-
poses gratis, and it imports all its material and
gets it in free of duty by special concession, and
it brings in cheap Italians or Chinese or coolies
to do the work, and turns them loose when the
job is finished. Then the syndicate gets up a
scheme for selling its line to the Government,
and runs the project through Parliament by
wholesale bribery; and the Government accord-
ingly takes over a jerry-built line that was made
to sell, and pays more for it than it would have
paid if it had built the whole concern itself at
t.he outset, and the two or three million acres
of land are all dead loss and swindle. And
either Kintore is an ass and doesn’t know this,
or he is something else, and intends to take a
hand in the syndicate. Also, in any case, Kin-
tore is not authorised by the Constitution to
give advice to the Government about railways
or anything else. He is paid to keep quiet,
and if he doesn’t keep quiet he shouldn’t be
paid.

At Sydney Her Majesty’s, on the arrival
of “The Lyons Mail,” the manner in which
William Rignokl was received must have warmed
the heart of that worthy man and fine actor. The
play, we believe, is identical with that staged by
Henry Irving as “ The Courier of Lyons,” an
adaptation from the French. The piece is now
well staged; the set of the second scene of the
first act, an auberge at Lieursiant, by Messrs.
Clint and Owen, being remarkably well
painted and designed. As the double William
the Great shines most as Dubose, the rogues’
champion ; his Lesurques, otherwise played with
freedom and jollity, partially failing to depict the
despair that must have overcome the well-to-do,
good-hearted Lesurques as he felt the halter of
circumstantial evidence tightening round his
throat. But Dubose’s murder-scene, interviews
with the betrayed girl, and the great scene where
he is entrapped in his garret, went with a con-
vincing bang and a snap not usual in the melo-
drama of this city. For the others, Harry
Jewett is somewhat too stalwart to imper-
sonate the effeminate masher-thief, Courriol,
nevertheless, his performanee left little room for
fault-finding. Edith Blande’s Jeanette is about
the best thing she has given us. The horse-coping
scoundrel ofJack ” Sweeney followed somewhat
closely on the lines of the Dubose, but was other-
wise clever. Joe Tolano’s philosophical pick-
pocket so captured the gallery that when he failed
to take a call at the end of an act in which he had
little share, one of the gods immediately
inquired, in an injured, expostulatory tone:
“What’s the matter with Joe?” and the
deities would not be pacified till Joe was
trotted out. The other parts are well handled
by Bessie Rignold, Arthur Greenaway, Frank
Harcourt, Jim Hazlitt, Stirling Whyte (though
somewhat too implacable), Arthur Rigby, and
Fanny Reynolds, whose Joliquet deserves favour-
able mention. La Bernhardt opens at this house

At Sydney Garrick the farcical comedy,
“Our Flat,” seems likely to fall flat enough. Its
authoress, Mrs. Musgrave, became possessed of
an original and humorous central idea—the seizure
of time-payment furniture by bailiffs and its
replacement by artistically-draped tubs, barrels,
cases and planks—but she lacked the skill and
experience to weave a story round this and to
make the most of her opportunities for getting fun
out of essentially humorous situations. There-
fore, the first act is slow as an election
with only one candidate; in the second
the fun is intermittent, and the curtain
drops at the wrong time, while in the third there
is nothing to be done except to revive the business
of the second act, and tumble over the shaky
chairs and into the bath-tubs, and to wind up
with the “Heaven bless you, my children,” con-
clusion, whose always apparent approach moves
an audience even quicker than the “National
Anthem.” Teddy Royce and Polly Emery are
the soul and body of the show ; they have the best
chances and make the most of them, though
why Manager Glover is not introduced earlier
is not apparent. They are rather ably and
brightly played up to by Mary Kingsley, who is
however, just a little too hard in style, while
Lawrence Cautley, as the young author, lacks the
ease and lightness necessary for work of this
character. Edwin Kelly, as the heavy father,
rants and roars too much ; the character should be
played “ straight ” and without burlesque. Marie
Brooke and Hans Phillips are bright and easy in
small parts. Charles Brown, W. F. Clitheroe,
and Mrs. Hill score the utmost possible in abbre-
viated opportunities. “ Our Flat ”is not likely to
run for two years in Sydney as it did in London ;
we give it two weeks at the Garrick.

Goethe says : “ Men show their character
in nothing more clearly than by what they think
laughable.” Which reminds us that “ Evange-
line ” has been doing tremendous business at
Sydney Criterion. The Gaiety crowd will also
attract the multitude when it arrives, and the
chief difference between the disconnected, pur-
poseless, highly-gilt tommyrot it will fetch along
and that vended by the present company is that
the one sort, rightly called burlesque, is up to
date, while the other, misnamed opera bouffe, is so
sanctified by age as to pan out good as new to the
later generation. However, it may be said in
favour of “ Evangeline ” that it is splendidly
staged and played for all it is worth. Eortescue’s
song, “The man in the moon,” very well sung,
has a familiar twang; and “I like it” is an old
music-hall friend. The dashing and well-
proportioned Eileen Karl’s Amazonian guard
furnishes, possibly, the best leg-show this city has
seen—certainly the best-attired limbs that have
ever walked into the affections of Sydney's
masherdom. Lena Salinger quits the show to
join Tilly, now a prime favourite, in San
Francisco. “ Evangeline ”is good for a long run.

The Achurch farewell benefit, in “Adrienne
Lecouvreur,” was a huge success, artistically and
otherwise, and it seems a pity that this play, in
which Mrs. Charrington puts in her best work,
was not utilised long prior to her departure. The
audience was played out, reluctantly, with “ Auld
Lang Syne.” The Charringtons strike London in
October.
At popular prices the Hallo’s are nearly
filling the Sydney Town Hall. Better supported
than on a prior visit, it is now possible to sit out
the programme without feeling that certain num-
bers must be endured for the sake of what follows.
Madlle. Marie Fillunger, not as we had supposed
a newly-caged songstress, is a most business-like
artiste, who puts on no frills, either of style or
costume, but who has a very sweet, though not
powerful, highly-trained and sympathetic voice.
Madame Marian Burton, who is very well, thank
you, and has assumed a more rounded appearance
since she assumed matrimonial cares, ii in very
fine voice, though she challenges unfavourable
comparison with Patey in her choice of songs.
Norman Neruda is beyond criticism, and Halle,
r.s of old, toys with the piano as does a mother
who soothes and caresses her little one. Mr. J.
E. Sykes acts as accompanist, and the fifth

The Ivanhoe Minstrels will give a per-
formance with full orchestra at Bondi Aquarium
this (Thursday) evening. A big show and novel-
ties announced for Saturday.
The Gaiety Company made their re-appearance
at Melbourne Princess’ on Saturday night, before
an audience quite as overflowing and almost as
enthusiastic as that which gave them their first
Austral welcome three years ago. During those
years the Cockney notion of sparkling fun appears
to have stood as still as a cab-horse sleeping on
the rank. “ Ruy Bias ” is a trifle more incoherent
and broken-up than “Monte Cristo.” but it is
conducted on exactly the same rules as regards
the distribution of “fat,” and contains many of
the same little jokes and ingenious bits of business.
Fred Leslie fits the rim of a hat over a specially-
constructed bald head, so as to seem to be wearing
a fawn-coloured billycock, and the public mirth,
when he suddenly removes the rim, knows no
bounds. Formerly, in the character of a monk,
he used to shift a fringe of hair with equally sue
cessful results. On the present occasion, too,
Leslie enlarges upon his original imitation of
Irving by introducing him as a short-skirted
ballet girl, in conjunction with Danby and two
other male performers, who are generally under-
stood to be impersonating Toole, and a couple of
actresses (names unknown) under the same elevat-
ing conditions. Leslie, likewise, pops up in a
double character, one side of him being Scotch
and the other Irish, which parti-coloured perfor-
mance will be strikingly novel to all who haven’t
seen Johnny Gourlay’s more elaborate treatment
of the same old idea. Thinking over the humour
of a Gaiety buries pie, one is struck by the fact
that it is, to a considerable extent, mechanical
and worked by a string—like the good old
English Punch and Judy. Leslie and Nellie
Farren are quick-change artists of the highest
possible type. Nellie has as much intelligence
and “go ” as her companion star, but the want of a
bald-head and numerous other broad-comedy
effects put her ata serious disadvantage. She looks
nice, as usual, however (like the historical Miss
Smith), and whatever her legs find to do they in-
variably do it with neatness and dispatch. Leslie
gets through an enormous quantity of work
with a skill which is none the less remark-
able because it might be devoted to a higher class
of entertainment, whilst Fred. Storey’s dancing
retains its pristine vigour. Danby is rather lost
in a poor part, and Sylvia Grey does nothing
phenomenal with her feet in tins show. Sylvia,
in short, seems but a shadow of her old self. She
acts not, neither does she spin as merrily as of
yore. Florence Levey is in no respect quite
equal to Letty Lind, whose place she takes, but in
a general way Florence is a nice girl, all the same.
So with Grace Pedley, the substitute for Marion
Hood, and ballad-songstress of the company.
Otherwise there is a liberal display of feminine
loveliness associated with the average amount of
Gaiety-girl intelligence. The stage presents a
very brilliant aspect when they are all “ on,” and
the scenery, by Goatcher and Brunton, is simply
superb. “ The Bogie Man ” will probably be re-
garded as the best of several good musical num-
bers. For this song and dance Fred. Leslie
assumes the irrelevant disguise of a sweep, the
“Whist, Whist!” chorus being supplied by a
background of girls in night-dresses. The tout
ensemble is weirdly fetching, although the air is
not so prettily turned as that heard at the Opera
House, a while ago, in “ Chilperic.”

“Run Wild,” produced at the Opera
House on Saturday, is hardly likely to run wild
for any great length of time. The name of the
party who wrote this three-act comedy doesn’t
appear on the programme, but he (or she) belongs
to the school of authors who classify their various
characters between brackets. Thus a certain
Monty Drury is set down as “an easygoing
chappie,” whilst a lesser luminary is hastily dis-
missed as “Another Chappie.” Lady Grace
Howard (“a good-natured girl”) calls upon the
chappie who is easy-going with a jewel-case in
her hand. Never having met him before in her
life, and not knowing his name, it naturally occurs
to Lady Grace to ask the easy-going one whether
he would mind taking her to the nearest pawn-
shop, where they can “ pop ” the jewels in the
interests of a third party. Seeing that they
immediately depart on this charitable errand, it
seems superfluous to explain on the programme that
Lady Grace is good-natured and the chappie easy-
going. Such conduct speaks for itself. Miss
Jennie Lee figures in large type as Collie Barker
(the Light of the Household), and her leading
speciality is a ferocious terrier, which, under
strong provocation, can be induced to make a
feeble pretence of wanting to bite a flunkey. The
part is no better suited to Jennie Lee than to any-
body else. It gives her no opportunities for
turning somersaults, or displaying any of her
often proved ability in the “ romp ” line of charac-
ter. Moreover, in any ease the little woman
couldn’t make a success of a dull, badly-written
thing like “Run Wild.” She might let them
have a little more “ Jo,” in which there is always
pleasure for the public and generally a profit for
the management.

At the Alexandra a steady demand for
‘The Trapper ” has set in. A furious bar-room
scene, and the poetic tableau, “After the Battle,”
seem better than ever, but in most respects “'The
Trapper ” is not the least bit better than it ought
to be, Considering that a tribe of Indians and a
tank ten feet deep in the middle are there when
wanted. A landslip, of which great things were
expected, turns out to be nothing worth shudder
ing at, more especially as the party who is slid
down into the tank by a convulsion of nature
looks uncommonly like a different man to Dr.
Carver.

ported by at least four of the originals, in Tither-
adge, Boucicault, Mrs. Brough (who met with a

cart makes a good sketch of the other beak, who

parts. The Melbourne halls and other shows are
progressing as usual, and shall have a friendly line
next week.
There is not the slightest chance for tire
Melbourne people to see any more of Sara Bern-
hardt this journey. She plays her week in
Adelaide, then thi’ee weeks in Sydney, followed
by a week in Brisbane. From Brisbane she
returns to Sydney, and with a gracious smile
takes the boat for America. Sara will allow it to
be stated that she is unutterably grieved at. the
thought of leaving Australia so soon, but as a
matter of fact she will shed no tears at parting.
She, like every other true Frenchwoman, cares
for no country but France —no one who has lived
long in France cares much for any other country—
and takes no interest in any people but the French.
She has come out here under contract to perform
a certain number of times, and her chief business
care is to see that a certain guarantee sum for
each performance is handed to her every morning.
Over and beyond that Sara stands to benefit con-
siderably by big business, so that the element of
speculation enters into her engagement. Yet her
want of punctuality and long and frequent
“waits ” are not consistent with an earnest desire
to please her good friends the public or secure the
management against loss. Sara doesn’t like
altering her dilatory Parisian habits to
please foreigners, even though she might
have to forego her percentage of profits
as the penalty of waywardness. But, on the
other hand, she cannot bear to see the house
thinning during a performance, and the sight of
one person walking out whilst she—Mon Dieu !
holds the stage will move her more than all the
apologetic protests of Messrs. Abbey, Williamson
and Garner put together. “Let them go if they
don’t like it,” is said to be Sara’s scornful remark
when the gods are tired of gazing at the ever-
lasting curtain. But if they do go, it is the
divine one who doesn’t like it, which explains, in
a great measure, the reason why “Theodora,”
even more than “ Cleopatra,” was pulled together
after the first night. The indignation caused by
the “Theodora” prcmiire was fully justified by
results. On Thursday they played the tragedy
twice over, and the evening performance was
finished some 05 minutes earlier than on the Mon
day. Thursday happened to be the SnciiU Fran
cuis night, when the stage was loaded with flowers,
the audience rose up at the “ Marseillaise,” ind
Sara’s sympathies were all round the house.

The small amount of vice-regal patronage
bestowed upon Sara at Molbourno Princess’s
may possibly be accounted for by the fact that it
was better business to fill the Governor’s box with
ten-shilling seats than invite his gracious presence
on the nevah. There could be no sense in having
the Hopetouns and “ suite ” stuck in the centre of
the dress-circle unless his lordship were prepared
to pay for the space at current rates, like any other
person, which privilege the thrifty young Scotch-
man by no means hankers after. The Ilopetouns
went once to “ La Tosca ” in their V.R. capacity,
and once they saw “ Camille ” from the manager’s
box. This latter visit was not announced in the
advertisement column. Williamson and Garner
are possessed of some slight sense of humour, afld
although they love their Governor to distraction,
they presumably found that the notion of him
conferring his “distinguished patronage” upon
Madame Bernhardt was a bit too funny.
Mf .Ms Ms *
The speculative Abbey is already talking
airily of another Bernhardt visit at some not
vfery distant period. But he has yet to discover
how much the ill-effects of Sara’s “ waits ” may
be felt during the present trip even, without
taking into consideration the fact that a repetition
of the Melbourne boom would be impossible unless
the management could guarantee the regulation
of performances according to railway time-tables.
No such guarantee can be given, apparently. On
more than one occasion Madame Bernhardt has,
apparently out of pure indifference for the Mel-
bourne public, mingled with a spirit of sheer
cussedness towards the gentlemen who were tear-
ing their hair at the portals of her dressing-room,
compelled hundreds of her patrons reluctantly to
go away without seeing the last two acts of the
play they had paid for. The argument that no
time was fixed for the conclusion of, say, “ Theo-
dora,” and that the public must make allowance,
&c., is altogether a false one. A dragged-out
performanee involves a premature departure of
those who come from distant suburbs, or the ex-
penditure of a sovereign, more or less, in cab-hire.
Where, beside her lover tut,
Sara died last Friday night,

Trip the toe fantastic, light.
Tragedy is out of fashion,
Comic songs are coming in,
Puns supply the place of passion--
Shall we groan aloud, or grin ?
Let us grin a grm sardonic :
Sara B. has gone away—
Hang the art that’s histrionic !
Fillies fair and philharmonic
Fool around the stage to-day.
Who shall say burlesque is barn n
Of all humour, wit, or sense '!
Sara’s not a patch on Farren,
As for Leslie, he’s immense.

In either case they consider themselves “got
at.” A ten-shilling ticket didn’t buy a complete
evening’s entertainment, unless the purchasers
were prepared to sink another fifteen shillings in
travelling expenses. “Theodora” and “Cleo-
patra ” contain fewer lines, and far less of heavy
scenery, than most of the melodramas which
Bland Holt manages to rattle through in three
hours. Two acts of “Theodora” occupy just 23
minutes between them, whilst the six intervals
are sometimes allowed to average 20 minutes each.
Nay, a brief twelve minutes’ act, mainly consist-
ing of spectacle, is sandwiched between two 24
minutes slices of curtain, that being at the rate of
twelve minutes of tragedy to the hour. The story
loses all continuity when thus spread about like
plums in a workhouse pudding, and it is hard to
understand how Sara Bernhardt, an artiste who
loves her work, can find any satisfaction in spoil-
ing its effect upon the audience. The Melbourne
people were very good to Sara, so long as they
believed that she was at least capable of that
gratitude for admiration which is one of the most
lovable characteristics of ordinary womanhood.
But after the first night of “Theodora ” the awful
slander that Sara doesn’t care a tinker’s curse for
folks in front became spread abroad. Then did
level-headed men sum up the situation in a calm,
judicial manner “ She’s a great actress. She
keeps us waiting three-quarters of an hour to
begin with, and another blessed half-hour after
every act. She’d cut each act in half and double
the number of intervals if she could, so long as
she got our money all right. Nobody pays us the
compliment of coming before the curtain to apolo-
gise for Sara’s playing the fool with us, and there
we sit, cramped and miserable, wondering whether
she means to go on with the show. She is a won-
derful actress. We shall never see another like
her and a jolly good job, too.” When Sara
reaches Sydney she will surely find the public
“ up ” to the tricks she played upon the spiritless
Melbournians, who never attempted to obtain
their legitimate rights. Let the Sydneyites insist
that each performance be advertised to conclude
at a reasonable hour, and demand their money
back if the contract isn’t duly carried out and let
J.C.W, make Sara sit np. What satisfaction does
it yield a man to be told that “ Sara was simply
immense ” after he had rushed off to catch his
last train ?

Sheridan’s engagement at Melbourne
Royal brought more money into the house than
any other company had drawn since the panto-
mime, or for many months before it. The Firm
accordingly expressed their appreciation by a
testimonial performance in aid of the Widdy last
Monday night, when the curtain finally descended
on their lease. And this reminds us that times
and castes have changed in Melbourne. When
“ Fun on the Bristol ” was first produced at the
Royal, some eight years ago, the press rose up
almost in a body to declare that such a respectable
temple of the drama was desecrated by a pro-
duction so altogether frivolous and “ un-English.”
By the way, Sheridan’s benefit was a huge success,
and the Widdy received many recalls.
At Poverty Point.
Anyone connected with Australian provincial theatricals
will know the Loving Couple, married these 15 years, and
positively you never see one without the other, so that
they should certainly win the Thespian flitch of bacon.
Remember that Bernhardt’s scenery is only paper—the
only paper in the house.
What is Nellie Stewart doing in London? It was an-
nounced before she left, that a definite offer of an
engagement had been made, too good to be refused, but
now everything seems uncertain. Could it have been
only a voyage on spec, after all ? However this may be,
a first appearance at the fag-end of the season, when all
theatre-going London is holiday-making, will hardly give
the young Australian prinia donna a fair show.
That it is the duty of the ticket-collectors at the back
to lead the applause is well recognised at some theatres.
During Charles Warners last season at Melbourne Royal,
when he was playing to poor houses and apathetic
audiences, the “ eminent” one rushed out one night to
the acting-manager. “What the blank dash do you
mean, Mr. ? There’s six of you blank blank dash
fools in front and I never got a hand.”
Melbourne architects complain of “ Billy” Pitt sending
in his Opera House tender with the motto “Princess.”
They urge that it was equivalent to giving his name.
The death of Harry Edwards was reported the other
day, and now a rumour goes round that Olive Berkeley,
his little Lord Fauntleroy, has died after an operation for
her throat-complaint.
Sara Bernhardt on Duncan Gillies: “ Who is ze leetle
fat man?”
The real reason of Elton’s re-engagement. The “ Firm*’
wanted George Walton to take the former’s place, but,
leaving the offer too late, found that the latter had
arranged to take out a company of his own and would
not renew. Which means an extra ten pounds per week
to the great E. The difficulty of finding anyone to re-
him place was also probably the real reason of the unusual
but well-deserved benefit given to Ryley.
Reports to the contrary notwithstanding, it is probable
that H. H. Vincent will never return to Australia. The
days of thumping salaries from the “ Firm ” appear to be
over, and Vincent—who has money—is too good a man
ever to lack an engagement on the London boards.
Taken all round he was, perhaps, the best “old man”
actor Australia has ever seen, and, as Sir Peter Teazle,
was certainly superior to Farren, who in England has a
monopoly of the part. On the other hand, there are
ominous signs that, after a few more spasmodic appear-
ances in melodrama, Charles Warner will once more seek
refuge here.
Maud Williamson has not retired definitely from the
stage, but, after a rest, will probably re-appear in an
original drama.
The somewhat dingy scenery of the Bernhardt season i 8
characteristic of most French plays, and, in spite of what
the gushing critics who haven’t been there may say, the
“setting” is never strong in any Parisian theatre.
Most countries, Australia included, can give the French
points in this respect.
Subscription in Melbourne for G. R. Ireland, the
veteran. His first appearance, as a regular actor, was in
1858, as Sir Eglamour, in the “Two Gentlemen of
Verona,” to the Valentine of G. V. Brooke, the Proteus
of Robt. Heir, the Sylvia of Ellen Mortyn, and the Julia
of Mrs. Heir—Eheu ! As they say in the classics. Before
that he was the crack amateur of Melbourne, with the
Garrick Club, as Claude Melnotte, and that style of thing
- even now, he is not much older than Irving.
The man who makes the gruel thick and slab growls
again, because Williamson and G. don’t have placards for
the Gaietys.
France is most ungrateful to its old and used-up
actresses. The great Mdllo Georges, idol of Napoleon’s
era, applied for the caretakershi-p of umbrellas at the
Paris Exhibition, 1857, under Nap. 111., and Bernhardt
once got a nasty jar when she asked a woman, connected
with the theatre, what she, the great Sa-hara, would come
to. “ Well,” says the other, “ you’ll be a box-opener.”
Six new scenes were painted for “Theodora,” two by
Goatcher, two by Hennings, two by Grist. A mighty
refreshment after the faded old stuff.
New York Hkralb has been starting a symposium on
“ Ought Actors to Keep Single,” the contributors being
actors and actresses. We suppose this emanates from the
interviewer who went round to ask the ladies, “ How do
you feel in trousers?” Miss Rhea insists that an actor
ought not to marry an actress, and others contra. Mr.
and Mrs. Kendal get on very nicely, but our memory
is rather short, and, so far as it serves us, actors and
actresses should never marry anyone, not even one
another.
Williamson and G., after freezing out the billstickers
over Bernhardt, did not deign in any shape to publish
the cast of “Theodora.”
Pitt, who designed the Melbourne Princess’, also designs
the new Melbourne Opera House, which, at a cost of
£50,000, will be the most magnificent Thespian temple
south of the line. The house will consist of dress-circle,
stalls, upper-circle, and gallery—three tiers, but what
becomes of the good old pit ? The Royal management
had to restore it, after abolition. There will be a revolving
stage, so that scenes can be set without any intervals be-
tween the acts, as at the theatre Steele Mackaye opened
in New York, where the stage had two floors. It was
hoisted up and down, the set for Act 2 being prepared,
underneath, while Act 1 was going on.
Many actresses who do not draw well paint most
cleverly.
Williamson and Pollard are organising a juvenile troupe
to do the provinces.
Adelaide Christian World objects to the application of
the title the “Divine ” to Bernhardt.
George Rignold, in real life, cannot get away from the
idea that he is Henry V. Sometimes we are inclined to
think that George has mistaken the number. P.S.—This
is a joke.
Dr. Carver, the champion shot, was somewhat taken
back when told by a well-known wag that young M'lntosh,
of Melbourne, practised fly-shooting on the wing with a
small-bore rifle.
One of Bernhardt’s Theodora robes cost £l,6oo—they
say. Perhaps they mean francs.
Grattan Riggs was at Coppin’s “ give it ” in Melbourne
to Sara 8., and with his usual aplomb (Are yez lishnin’,
Dan. O'Connor?) spoke out bravely—“ Quel est votre
opinion de nos trams, Madame ? ” To which the goddess
replied,—“ Oh, sare, I spik zo leetle Eenglis, zat Ino
onnerstan, pardonnez moi.”
Ten thousand people paid for admission to Sims Reeves’
positively last farewell concert.
At the Melbourne Princess’ last week.—They were
speaking of Sara. She : “So that is the famous voix d’or !
But why does she change it so often ? ” He (husband, no
doubt): “That’s the beauty of having a voice of gold—
you can always change it. (Apart.) I wish you could
change yours."
Overheard at one of the Melbourne theatres (not the
Princess’, you may be sure) the other night. Canvasser
for daily newspaper to friend: “I’ve only brought the
missus and her mother and sister to-night. To-morrow
night I’ll bring the family.” And he did—seven of them,
and all “ on the nod.”
Durward Lely, a Savoy tenor in the Gilbert-Sullivan
era, was a blacksmith. Which reminds us that Barry
Jewett is said to have graduated at the anvil. This in
New Zealand.
Said Boucieault to Cartwright: “If you like I will
stage-manage ‘The Miller’ for you.” “ Certainly,” re-
plied Cartwright, “ but in that case I don’t play in it.”
Sam French, the well-known monopolist of theatrical
publications, London and New York, has retired from
business.
The idea of Sardou’s “Theodora” was got from
“ Valeria,” in which Rachel used to act, only in this
drama .there were two distinct women— Empress and
courtesan—exactly like each other, impersonated by
Rachel.
Between 11 and 12 o’clock on the “ Theodora ” prcmifcre
there were just 15 minutes’ acting.
The journalistic delusion is that things can be described
beforehand, but never can it be done. “Theodora” is
finished at a good deal after midnight, and a critic pre-
tends that he turns out two columns of most thoughtful
and elaborate copy in time for the morning press!
Nellie Farren makes us think of Julia Matthews. How
her “Sweet Spirit Hear My Prayer,” in “Aladdin,” used
to collar the mashers who are now grand-dads! She
married one Mumford, in Maoriland. It is quite a stage
tradition how her father and mother used to keep her
chained up, the old father in particular, with his weather
eye ori her, and Burke, the explorer, got few opportunities
for his courting.
“ The Cleopatra attire displays Sara’s figure closely. It
is somewhat of manly beauty, with the appearance of
strong chest, rather than bust, though the haunch is
feminine in broad outline ; and, without any suspicion of
ungraeefulness, one likens the set of the trunk on the
understandings to the Hottentot women, whose infants
stand up behind.” Thus much from that esteemed scien-
tific measurer, Dr. Roddrule. Again: “ Her finely-
moulded, long octopussy arms are distinctively feminine.”
It is now openly stated that Williamson and Game*
have dissolved partnership. The genial James is spoken

Sybil Sanderson, the American soprano, so says a
leading London paper, can get the upper G in the treble
clef—a note higher than Nilsson or Jenny Lind, though
her voice has not the quality of either singer. Sybil’s
father was Attorney-General of Calfornia.
There was some fun going to England with Toole & Co.«
in the Victoria. Nelly Stewart fainted, owing to tight-
lacing, at the masquerade ball, and Musgrove and
Plumpton carried her to bed. Muzzy’s attempts to be
funny in a comic dress were pitiable. A certain eminent
individual, whose giddiness has been well advertised, was
seriously indisposed during the voyage, and a subscrip-
tion-list was sent round on behalf of his wife.
The Gerald-Duff Company now playing at Hobart has

George Lee writes to say that people are no smarter in

that he followed the fortunes of Toole.
To advertise a play at Hobart, Messrs. Gerald and Duff

A number of the Adelaide nobility declined to patronise
the Bernhardt boom, and absented themselves from the
sale of seats, presumably because they disapproved of the
auction system. Others, who held the same view, also
absented themselves from the sale, but repented, and had
to pay the speculators additional prices for tickets,
later on.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The news that though Slavin decisively beat
Kilrain bets were declared off owing to a dispute as to
whether Slavin had scored a knock-out dr a win,
being interpreted, probably means that the referee had
more money on Kilrain than he oared about losing.
Possibly the influential party at the fight had their money
on Kilrain, in just the same way as the influential party at
the Miller-Foley match here some years back, had their
money on the wrong man. Slavin’s record is now cer-
tainly the best of any man’s iri the ring at the present
time, and if he meets Jackson the negro will go under,
sure. When Slavin made his first appearance in Sydney
Tub Bulletin stated its opinion that when he met Jackson
the latter would suffer defeat. This idea brought forth a
lot of indignant letters from readers, ridiculing the notion
as preposterous. Jackson was a little god at the time.
If they met now the betting would be six to four on
Slavin. No man who has seen Slavin at work and marked
the terrific strength of his hitting, and the determined
way in which he bores in after his opponent, would
hesitate to back him against the weak-ribbed, herring-
gutted nigger, Peter Jackson, clever though the latter be.
And how about Goddard? There is no knowing quite
how good Joseph is. He is probably at hds best now, and
if Slavin has been playing any tricks with his constitution
he will find the Barrier Miner a desperately hard man to
dispose of. But if Slavin can go into the ring fit and
strong as he was when he knocked Dooley out -with his
first hit (the writer paid 10s. to see that fight, anditlasted
a minute and a half)—if he can go in as fit as he was then,
he can beat Goddard at his own game. But it would be a
lovely fight, dear bottlenosed readers, a lovely fight.

Carbine, notwithstanding Donald Wallace’s
arguments to the contrary, is far better in the Melbourne
Cup than either Vengeance or Dreadnought. It was a
foregone conclusion that the champion would be the best
handicapped horse in the race “on paper.” Barnard
couldn’t possibly weight him up to his last year’s form
with Highborn, Vengeance and others, because 12st. fibs,
wouldn’t have been too much for that, and as for Dread-
nought-well, taking a line through Melos, he has the
worst of it with the big horse. All the same, it is absurd
to suppose that Carbine can go on winning Melbourne
Cups for ever, and unlikely that we shall see him turned
out again in the same condition as last November.

A recently-published book of sporting prattle,
called “ Racing for Gold,” professes to give a new story
about Fred. Archer. It is to the effect that somebody
sent him a parcel containing 100 sovereigns on the night
before the Leger. In the parcel was a note stating that
another 100 “ quid” would follow if he didn’t win the race
next day. Archer was to vide the favourite for Lord
Falmouth, so he went round to his iudship and requested
that another jockey might be put up in his (Archer’s)
stead. But Lord Falmouth said, “ Certainly not, Archer,
you ride the horse and keep the money,” or some lie of
that sort. Therefore, Archer rode the horse, and,
beaten on the post by a short head, he was solaced
by the receipt of another parcel of sovereigns, enclosing a
request “not to draw it quite so fine anothertime.” This
yarn is hopelessly idiotic * on the face of it. The idea of
anyone trying to square the wealthiest jockey of his time
with £lOO, for a race on which he would stand to win
fifty times as much, is about as likely as Archer’s asking
to be taken off the horse. Besides, the present w r riter is
prepared to swear that Archer won the Leger on each
first favourite he rode for Lord Falmouth, and never was
beaten by a short head in the race at all.

Thiß is a true story about Mr. George Seale, the
well-known N.S.W. amateur boxer. In his rowing days
(he was an intercolonial eight-oar man), Mr. Seale used to
go up and down the Parramatta River a good deal. One
night going up in a late steamer there were a couple of
clumsy roughs on board who began to make themselves
offensive to the passengers—using foul language. Mr.
Seale asked them to stop it, and as he is a medium-sized,
slender, quiet-looking man, they both turned on him,
and wanted to know what the blank blank he had to do
with it, and said that if he didn’t something hold his jaw
they’d make him, and so on. One of them volunteered
the statement that Mr. Seale was wearing a rotten bad
hat. Mr. Seale took off the old soft felt hat he was wear-
ing and gave it a blow on the top. “ Yes,” he said, “ it
shuts up very quickly, and so will you if you don’t watch
yourselves.” His confident attitude rather quietened
them, but they said that if he would only get off at
Abbotsford they’d take the shine out of him. Now, it so
happened that Abbotsford was the very wharf where he
meant to land, so he agreed, and when the wharf was
reached he got out after them, and four or five stalwart
rowing men with him to see fair play. “ Now,” he said,
“ you had a lot to say on the boat—l’ll fight you one after
the other or both together, whichever you like.” But
they couldn’t suffer it. They ran off as hard as they could
split,! one remarking to the other as they went: “ Blime,
Billy, he must be a ’ot member.”

Long-armed, nuggetty old Dave Ingram, erst-

A rather hard-up-looking young man, sitting on
the Pastoral Hotel water-trough (Flemington), was the
other day asked by a Johnnie” to keep his heye on
his ’oss and he would leave him a long beer in the bar.
Little did that Johnnie think when he made this gener-
ous offer that the man on the trough once, and not so
many years ago, either, had more thousands than he ever
had pounds, and could have a special train to cart his
string of racehorses about and laugh when he went down
for a few thousands. And yet he was spoken of as a
“ knowing fellow,” and a word dropped from him caused
many a horse to go up in the market. He played against
the ring and lost. And when “ broke ” he had the bitter
pleasure of seeing from the Hill a nag that had once
lost him a fortune, win one of our greatest events. How
those cheers must have grated upon that hard-up one’s
ears! But now, Johnnie will take your long ’un. In
those days he was worth a solid £lOO,OOO, and now he sits

purse, after a terrible tussle. Dinnie weighed 13st. 21b.,
Ross, 14st. 81b. Charlie Bannerman takes a benefit at
this place of amusement on Saturday evening, when it is
to be hoped that all those who admired the great bats-
man in his prime will take tickets. Pablo Fanque, by the
way, beat the indomitable Sandy Ross, who had the worst
of the weights, at the Olympic, on Saturday night, after
a good go for a purse.

England is now simply nowhere at her own pet
games. Slavin knocks the stuffing out of all the English-
men and Yanks, and will simply flatten out Johnell when-
ever he meets that blowhard. And yet lots of people
think that Goddard, w’ho has never yet been out of Aus-
tralia as a pug, can beat Slavin. The latter, by the way,
is not a Queenslander, but hails from Maitland, N.S.W.
There is no truth outside Science.
Tasmanian apples are said to have been

Of thirteen newly-elected N.S.W. labour
members whose biographies are given in a daily

It little knows. The N.S.W. democracy is sober.

In a fowl-stealing case at Charters Towers,

Our religious contemporary, the S.M.

Amongst the Sydney special constables

Going back to the times of mail-clad knights—and

Endeavour Times, Cooktown (Q.), pathe-
tically refers to a couple of cemetery decorations :
—“One is a marble cross on a granite base to the
memory of Mr. Bell’s boy, another is an orna-
mental pedestal on which rests a beautifully
chiselled lamb, emblematical of the innocent Miss
Wriggles, whose remains rest beneath.”
The daily press vigorously urged the
N.S.W. strikers to adopt “ constitootional ”
methods and have their grievances redressed by
Parliament. Well, they have adopted “consti-
tootional ” methods, and have now returned as
their nominees over a-fourth of the whole House.
Still the daily papers aren’t satisfied.
“ The infant daughter of the Duke and
Duchess of Fife has been christened in the Chapel
Royal with water specially brought from the
river Jordan.” Why should this greasy blasphemy
be cabled to Australia, and thrust into the faces
of the public ? It quite spoilt our breakfast.
That level-headed Scotchman, Hon. James
Service, writing in the Melbourne daily press
strongly counsels the pastoralists to confer with
the unionists. “We have arrived at ‘ the parting
of the way.’ A little kindly feeling and just con-
sideration on the part of the employers now, and
the clouds will part, and the sun will shine again
on ‘ the land we love.’ A mistake now, and what
‘ clouds and darkness ’ will rest upon our future
no man can tell.”
Dan. O’Connor, who quietly relied, no
doubt, on “the Oirish vote,” has been “left ” for
Monaro. There is no longer any solid Irish vote,
as the Irishmen—who have absolutely nothing to
thank Daniel for—-have, in the main, become good
Australians, who in politics know not any man’s
country. The votes of Dawson and Miller, the
elected men, two of the cleanest men in the
Assembly, can always be relied upon in any
honest democratic cause.
According to Brisbane Courier certain
bones passed along by the executors of H. C.
Hartman, of Toowoomba—Col. Olcott’s benefac-
tor, by the way—prove that not only the moa but
the kiwi or apterix, formerly had its home in Aus-
tralia. We take this with salt. There has been
too much swindling done in “ rock footprints of
the moa ” to make us go in for anything less than
a Maori mummy, and the fact that the informa-
tion comes through the superstitious and yet
faddily scientific Hartmann (nowin Nirvana) asks
us to increase this order to a fossil Mahatma at
the very least.
A Sydney daily newspaper correspondent
suggests an alternative method to the £4O deposit
for securing the bona-Jides of Parliamentary can-
didates. He would “ substitute for the £4O, at the
option of the candidate a nomination paper signed
by a specified proportion of the electors on the
roll—say 5 per cent. Such signatures should
be considered as votes given to the candidate and
counted in the subsequent poll, and the signers
should be not allowed to vote again at such elec-
tion, unless more than one member were required to
be elected. This hypothecation of the votes of
the nominators would afford sufficient guarantee
that a fair proportion of the electors were pre-
pared to support their nominee, and constitute a
safeguard against practical jokes or frivolous
nominations.” This looks very plausible, but it
wouldn’t do. It would, in (a measure, abolish the
secrecy of the ballot, inasmuch as creditors could
bring pressure on their debtorsHo sign nomina-
tions for them. Money could, in fact, be lent on
or given for votes with the certainty of delivery.

The Sydney Evening News advertises 'a
“ splendid portrait of the Prince of Wales in his
masonic regalia ” as one of the attractions of the
current Down and Gum-tree Jernel. We have
inspected this wondrous picture, wherein “Turn.”

blooming youth with a full head of hair. Is the
portrait an old one used over again after many,
many years? Or is it part of A. Bennett’s

“Schoolmaster” Buffet, long of Pitcairn
Island, has just died, aged 94, at Norfolk Island,
ft was in 1822 that the whaler Cyrus called in at
Pitcairn for food, and the Pitcairners asked for a

volunteered, and remained with the descendants
of John Adams for nearly 70 years. He used to
do a big trade in ornamental cabinet and filigree
work, always giving out the same venerable cram
—that the wood was from the old house of John
Adams. For the last 18 months of his life, the
patriarch was imbecile.
Salomons, Q.C., got off a bettor joke than

last time he attended him was on Bth March.
When giving the date, he referred to a pencil-
mark on his shirt-cuff. Salomons screamed an
objection that lie should only refresh his memory
from a book, in which the date had been noted at
the time. Witness: “I refreshed my memory
from the book about a week ago.” Salomons :

When Rodney Claude Spencer, known to
Northern Trirritorians as “ Buffalo Bill ” (now
doing a life-sentence for alleged murder); first
went to Scott’s Plains, the estimated numb'ei - of
briffaloes in and around that immediate heighbour-
hood Was 1:5,000 head, but the drought Of 1888
played sad havoc With theii'i. From one creek
al'crie Spencer and his blacks gathered 750 pairs of
horns from buffaloes which had perished fot Want
of grass arid Water. It is also known that 0000
hjead were shot off that country. Here are a few
of Spencer’S tallies:—ln 1887 he shot 700 in six
months; in 1888, 750 in seven months; and in
1889 no less than 1700 fell to his rifle iii ten
months. The present favourite haunts of the
buffalo ate the east df the Alligator River and
Scott’s Plains.
Duncan Campbell Frfiiicis Moodifi, to
whbSe recent death we referred last week, was
always iii a state of chronic insolvency. A foolish

court and hand him (is. expense-riioney for eafch
visit! For the latter reaso’ri, thesfe Were always
Moodie’s best times. The writer one day saW him
pUt through by Commissioner H. E. Downer,
alsb S.M. of Local Court. This is the scene :
Raphael v. Moodie: Moodie—“Here.” Is sworn.
S.M; : “Do you admit the debt?” “Yes, your
Hon of;” Raphael: “This is a judginent sum-
mons, yet Honor; the fourth or fifth.” Downer
only smiled—he had forgotten the fact “offi-
cially;” “Well, what proposition do you riiake,
Mr. Moodie?” “I aha unable to inakb any
proposal.” “ What is your occupation ?” “Jour-
nalist.” “ Your income?” “ Can’t say ; a little
comes in sometimes ; a lot at other times j if Mr.
Raphael will only wait till I strike a patch ”
Raphael: “I’ve been waiting dese shix monsh,
yer Honor.” Downer (to Moodie): “Can’t you
average your earnings?” “Well, say 15s. a week.”
“What rent doyou pay?” “255. a week when I
do pay it,” “ You’re married?” “Yes.” “And
it costs you to keep the house —?” “£3.” “ Can
you explain how you work that miracle, Mr.
Moodie —£4 ss. going out and 15s. coming in ?”
“Well, your Honor, all I know is that the.only
pocket-money I ever get in hand now-a-days is
when my good friend, Mr. Raphael, favoursme with
a judgment summons, and I get Gs, from his lawyer
for his expenses.” (“ Soilence in the Coort! ”)
Downer : “Well, you see, Air. Raphael, you can’t
get blood out of a stone. I decline to make an
order.” (Left grinning.)

Talk Of fancy floricultureA recent
cablegram states that a Siliila doctor has siicceeded
iii growing two specimens of leprosy bacillus Hi
serum. From the triumphant manner iri which
the informatiori is conveyed oile would think He
had done a very fine thing. Still we caii imagine
an enthusiast in diseases being as proud over
raising a healthy (the paradox Is pardonable)
bacillus as a gardener over rearing a new kind of
orchid. The subject thrills with lyric possibilities.
As thus : —affeticoso :
A Victorian contemporary prints the fol-
lowing statement without comment: —“ Henry
George says that, in the Australian colonies there
are many little indications of that spirit which, if
suffered to grow and intensify, may give justifica-
tion to the adage that, ‘peoples separated by
creeds may more bitterly hate each other than
those separated by oceans.’” This is a pot-shot
criticism that has missed its mark. Anybody
who has seen the St. Patrick’s Day and Twelfth of
July celebrations out here well know how much
truth there is in it. In the North of Ireland
there are still hostile demonstrations that seriously
incline to wind-up in the infirmary ; here they are
merely al fresco pantomimes, whose worst results-
are confined to a few headaches, and a vast
amount of flatulency, induced by reckless con-
sumption of aerated waters. The only people who
entertain even a mild dislike of each other on
religious—or rather irreligious—grounds, in this
country, are those who have no creed, but dis-
believe differently. Parsons, presbyteries and
city missionaries must introduce a lot more
asceticism into their manner of living before they
will be able to get their congregations to hate
each other over points of doctrine with the old-
time fervour.
“No man is a prophet in his own country'
is an old saw that has lately been proved to
have a broken back. We acknowledge we do
not see many instances of men and things pos-
sessing great reputations at the home of their
birth; but with the proprietor of Clements
Tonic the case is just the reverse of what the
old adage says. This article is consumed in
large quantities right at the seat of its manu-
facture just as much as at places remote there-
from, and this patronage is accorded to it on
account of its genuine, acknowledged, and un-
disputed merit; because Clements Tonic is not
a quack nostrum, but a reliable, scientific
specific, antagonistic to diseased conditions.
Most diseases are due to a disordered state of
the blood which becomes contaminated. Disease
thrives on these impurities and spreads through-
out the system and ends in fatal disease,
Clements Tonic so purifies the blood and re-
vitalizes it, that diseased germs cannot exist,
Clements Tonic regenerates the entire system :
it contains all material which brain and physical
w-orkers consume in their respective avoca-
tions ; —as one employment weakens the body
Clements Tonic replaces in the blood the con-
stituents consumed, which restore the healthy
condition, and this is the secret of its great suc-
cess. Not because it is a cure-all, but because
it treats the root of disease and not the branches.
“Croydon, N.S.W., Dec. Bth, 1890. Sir, —
Casually reading a list of testimonials for your
famous Clements Tonic, I noticed one from a
friend of mine which induced me to make some
inquiries as to its merits, and received such
glowing accounts of its efficacy that induced
me to try it. I have now almost finished the
second bottle, which has simply worked wonders.
I may state I have been a great sufferer from
general debility and lassitude, and am now',
thanks to Clements Tonic, a new' woman. I
can, with all sincerity , recommend Clements
Tonic to people suffering as I have done, and
you are at liberty to make what use yon like of
this information. Yours faithfully, Ellen Teb-
batt.” J. P. Doherty, Esq., Wee Waa,
N.S.W., is so grateful for the benefits that he
has derived from Clements Tonic that ho
writes :
“ For many years I suffered pain,
And many medicines took in vain,
Until Clements Tonic I had to try
The last resource, before I die.
The first Dot tic gave me relief
Giving me an appetite for beef ;
And now I eat just like a glutton
What I can get, beef, pork or mutton.
And feel just like a giant,
And proud to boast I’m Clements’ Client.
The above my friends, take my colonial,
Is an honest bushman’s testimonial.”

There is a movement on foot to acquire

to run a new morning paper.

speculation the scheme, if handled rightly, has
“ millions in it.”
In 1889 there were seven commonplace
Sydney aldermen in the N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly. Now there are but three—Martin,
Lees and Jenneret, none of whom are of any
special political influence.
The Bulletin predicts the early disappear
ance of the bell topper from Australian political life-
The white-waistcoat will go with it, and so will
the lawyers and the commission-agents who have
hitherto monopolised the seats in the Legislatures.
Tasmania’s imports total £1,611,036 ; hep
exports, £1,459,857. Her imports from Victoria
are £773,918; from Great Britain, £517,680;
from N.S.W., £192,704; from N./., £63,157;
Queensland, £840; South Australia, £6400 ; and
all other countries, £56,270.
Lawyer Croker, president of the Victorian
Law Institute, says—“ The success of the present
(Victorian) Government as hitherto obtained may
be attributed to the fact that it lias not less than
four legal members in its ranks.” Precisely. It
has done nothing but commit blunders since it
came into power.
Well did Hancock, in the Victorian Assem-
bly bring out The Bulletin’s point about the
dead silence in which the troops marched through
Melbourne on Queen Victoria’s birthday. He
grasped the nettle by declaring that the people
were silent because they knew the rifles were
intended for them.
The just and sensible “ betterment '’ prin-
ciple is steadily gaining ground. It is now pro-
posed that the long-promised bridge between
Svdney and its future Brooklyn, North Shore,
shall be constructed by taxing those whose land
would be improved by such a bridge—payments
to extend over a period of 100 years.
Many people bewail the fact that a lot
of recent N.S.W. members —“ men with a stake
in the country ’’—have been rejected in favour of
labour candidates. “ Anarchy is coming ! ” shriek
these Sydney Jeremiahs in chorus with Maeßain.
“Anarchy be hanged ! ” the other day said a level-
headed shop-keeper who had supported the labour
men. “Why, who are the rejected men whom
you are weeping about ? When I used to buy fish
on the wharf, one or two of them used to come
there to buy pigs; and it’s only a year or two
since the biggest man amongst them was fined for
killing calves in his back-yard.”
Charles Pratt, the American twenty-mil-
lionaire, who died suddenly the other day, was
a devout Christian, a generous giver to charitable
objects, and an active Standard Oil monopolist.
This, remarks the Twentieth Century, is a com-
bination of characteristics that makes a person
one of the “fittest” in this day and generation.
He made the most of both worlds.
Extract from the Royal Speech at opening
of Tongan Parliament:—
You all know that tny Government was heavily in-
debted to foreign countries, and we should return thanks
to God that we have discharged these debts.
“ Return thanks to God ! ” Yes, to the God of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the omnipresent
deity of shent per shent and loan syndicates !
Grey cables to N.S.W. Trades and Labour
Council: —
The news of the successes of the labour party in the
elections, which will be used with judgment, encourage
us who are here struggling for a just land-tax. If you
continue to move so wisely the four millions of Austra-
lians will establish a federation which will be a glory to
our aider, generous England, and a blessing to all man-
kind. It will bring to the front many great men now un-
known and comparatively useless. They would have
j.emained so but for this grand movement.
B D. Morehoad, now starring it on his
wealth, in London, as a prominent Queenslander,
suggests further immigration to the northern
colony as a cure for the labour troubles. More-
head is a squatter of the squatters, and, though a
jolly good mate, is an odious master. His pro-
posal is really a cure for fair wages, and means
the re-establishment of labour slavery. _ After the
labour troubles are cured will be the time tor all
the further immigration, so long as it is of a
healthy kind, needed in Australia. Till then, the
land can do well enough without “cheap labour ”
immigrants.

The Victorian Assembly has 95 members
for 243,730 electors, or, roughly, one member for
2565 voters ; Queensland, 72 members for 73,957
electors, or one member for little more than 1000
voters ; South Australia, 54 members for b 9,873
electors, one for 1200 voters ; Tasmania, 36 mem-
bers for 26,054 electors, one for 890 voters ; JN.b.
Wales in her last Parliament had 137 members
for 298,039 electors, or one for 2175.

Hancock, the labour-member elected for
Collingwood despite the opposition of the Age,
made a splendid splash in the Victorian Assembly
in moving the reply to the address. Casting to
the winds the time-honoured gabble over the
points provided for him, he launched into the real
questions of the day, boldly taking the first stand
for Labour ever thus made in an Australian or
any other Parliament. How is it Trenwith has
been all this time in Parliament, missing the
chance Hancock seized.'
Mr. Carruthers, N.S.W. Minister for
Public Instruction, has issued an address, grate-
fully thanking the “7231 electors who voted for
him at the poll.” Why-doesn’t Minister Cai-
ruthers thank the 4500 gentlemen or so, and the
2700 allotments or so, who voted for him on the
occasion? Such thanks always recall the good
old story told of Benjamin Franklin, who once
said, speaking of the property-vote system, that a
friend of his had in the morning an ass and with
it a vote, but at mid-day the ass died, and then
his friend had no vote— ergo, it was the ass and not
tlie man to whom the vote had beiontted MUnister
Carruthers numbers among his political trien

One hundred and eighty-three votes were
polled in Sydney for the Ulawarra election

the labour candidate-who nevertheless was
returned —while 29 were recorded n favour o
Lysaght, the Protectionist, also successfid ancl
61, 56 and 31 votes to the three defeated 1 tee
traders! If this method of recording votes Jje
fair for one electorate it is fair for all. V

The saddest spectacle ever seen in the
annals of a broken-down institution was the last
attempt of the Victorian Freetrade Association to
raise the wind and postpone the inevitable
collapse. It was about the last meeting of that
ruined circus, and the hall was nearly empty, and
the fire was out in the stove, and the gas was dim,
and everything was flat, wasted, and unprofitable.
Then somebody rose uv> and told the audience that
a gentleman on the platform had promised a
guinea, provided 19 other gentlemen gave 1J
guineas among them as a preliminary, and under
these circumstances he urged the 19 gentlemen to
rush forward and thus enable the society to profit
by the liberality of the gentleman on the plat-
form. There weren’t 19 gentlemen present, but
all that were there got up on the instant, and went
straight out without contributing a cent., and the
lavish person on the platform stuck to the exact
terms of his offer, and didn’t put up a solitary
copper.

There died the other day at Ararat (Vic.)
Hospital an illustrative old remnant of the convict
system—William Chaffey, aged 91, who reached
Vandemonia as a transportee in 1818. His corpse
still revealed signs of the many floergings he had
undergone. Chaffey was once one of six who
stood under the gallows, but was with two others
reprieved when the noose was round his neck.
A cheeky Rockhampton offender, “ lum
bered ” for larceny, took his revenge on the Court
by talking over his case—a simple one, which
could have been fairly settled in three hours—for
three solid days. Judge Miller wearily allowed
him rope, but the jurymen, who were locked up
for three nights, would have liked to screw his
neck. They didn’t wait three seconds, when the
end came, as to their verdict, which was delivered
with a vicious steel-trap snap, and the Judge gave
him “seven years” with a loud click. Seven
years for talking—we mean larceny 1

“ Jersey ale ’ is a new kind of “ ginger

Concurrently with the news that the S.A.
Parliament has voted money to buy Government
sites for workmen’s dwellings, near Adelaide*
comes the news that the Queensland Government
meditate buying two large estates on the Darling
Downs, to be paid for in Government debentures
at par, payable in 25 years, and bearing per
cent, interest. The price named is £3 an acre tor
150,000 acres, which will be readily taken by
selectors at a price to fully cover ad outlay.
Other landowners are willing to make similar
terms. This is a neat way of “ fleeing from the
wrath to come.”
This is cutting things tolerably fine. A
woman named King was travelling in a Melbourne
tramcar, and suddenly became excited a,t seeing a
timber*waggon on the line right ahead. .Being
under the impression that she was going to be
squashed in a heartrending collision, she clutched
the rail of the car with such tremendous energy
that she injured her constitution, and brought on
“neuralgic paralysis.” The hind-wheel of the
waggon did graze the tramcar, though it didn t
hit anywhere near the spot where the excited
female was holding on; but, all the same, she sued
for damages, and .fudge Hamilton gave Mbo.
This was very agreeable for her, no doubt,
but it was desperately rough on the de-
fendant, owner of the waggon. Ihe latter
is also a female—a lone woman who makes
an honest livelihood in the firewood business, and
she is let in for some £3OO in damages and costs,
because a stranger was scared at the sight of her
cart and kinked her spine through clutching a
tramcar when there was no earthly necessity for
it. And now the question arises—how tar can
this sort of game be carried ? The plaintiff was
allowed damages because there was a collision,
but if the other vehicle had got clear she would
have been injured just the same, for she wasn t
damaged by the collision, but by hauling in an
insane manner at the tramway company s pio-
perty The situation would have been just tne
same if she had been scared at the sight of a dog
as she came round a corner, and had hung on to a
lamp-post till she had broken her back, and then
sued the dog’s owner for damages. Or she might-
have been travelling by train, and, seeing Parkes
through the window, she might have shrieked till
she fractured both her legs, and after that Parkes
would have been liable. The Judge pointed out
that she ought to get the money because she was
injured “in trying to take care of herself, but a
woman who takes care of herself by grabbing a
tramcar and getting paralysed is altogether too
original for this world. Truly the law is a large
variety of mules.
Scientific Advertising.
Many are the theories entertained by unsophisti-
cated minds upon this subject, the greater part of
them being wide of the mark as to its policy,
influence, and advantages. Modern advertising
has become so much a scientific pursuit that the
old conditions are altogether changed, not merely
elaborated and systemnised, but laid down on a
newly devised basis, upon which is raised a super-
structure at once elegant and impressive. A
simple announcement in as few words as possible
(to save expense) regarding some article of ordin-
ary economical value and domestic use, is now
scarcely regarded by the purchasing public. Io
be effective and arrest attention nowadays, the
article must possess some advantages hitherto not
specifically attributed to it, which may refer
either to quality or quantity ; and the display o
these new principles in conspicuous and attractive
characters of the printers’or lithographers arts,
constitute one very marked alteration m modern
advertising. This leads to the point regarding
peculiarities in the styles practised by different
houses; while some are altogether for pictorial
illustrations, others follow by a happy medium
between the lithographic and plain typographical
arts. One celebrated patent medicine company
have long adopted the paragraph style of news-
paper advertising, whereby the article under con-
sideration is covertly and adroitly introduced by
a happy allusion to some topic of the day or hour,
finally securing the design intended by the writer
in the climax. This system possesses only one
drawback in the case of a reader who is antagon-
istic to the views put forth, which may produce
an anathema upon the author of the dissimulation.
But the great secret in extensive and successful
advertising lies in the fact that the article set
forth for the admiration of the people must be a
really good thing in itself, not a one-bottle remedy
for every disease; and if it has already withstood
the test of time and obtained the confidence of a
large proportion of the community, so much the
better its chance of successfully attracting the
notice of general readers. Upon these premises we
venture to name as the objects worthy of wide-
world advertising Warner’s Safe Cure for liver
and urinary diseases. Warners Safe Diabetes
Cure, Warner’s Safe Rheumatic Cure, Warner s
Safe Pills, the only known specifics for the several
complaints for which they are indicated. The
following is the latest certificate received from a
patient cured of diabetes: —' Camden, N.S.W.,

The S. M. Herald’s dramatic critic
congratulates the Sydney public on Sara Bern-

original and yet unacted play while in Sydney.
What’s wrong with our old friend, ‘ ‘ Experimcntum
pat in corpore vili ” ?
* * *
Sir Patrick Jenkins—beg pardon, Jennings
—who was already an M.L.G., K.C.M.G., and
LL.D., has now been made by the Pope a here-
ditary Marquis of the Holy Roman Empire. And
as there is no Holy Roman Empire just now, the
distinction amounts to what the Germans call
“ nix.” Besides, there is no one to call him Mar-
quis, except derisively, in this beastly country—if
you except the little coterie of gilded publicans
and sich already “ distinguished ” by His Howli-
ness, who solemnly greet each other with “ How
do you do, Sir John ?” and so on at Church meet-
ings. The Marquis Jennings! Booh ! It is
stated that this distinction is intended by the
Pope as “an honour to the colony ofN.S.W.”
As the Pope has not provided enough Marquis to
go all round the 1,100,000 people comprising the
N.S.W. population, the distinction had better be
divided amongst and confined to the Marquis
Jenkins’ fellow-members of the Legislative Coun-
cil, the 68 members of which are hereby declared
by The Bulletin to be each the 68th part of a
Marquis of the Holy Roman Empire. Augustus,
the microscope, please.
# # #
The Melbourne pressmen, who have not
hitherto been notorious for emotional effects,
seemed to lead the tumult at Sara’s farewell,
scene which is not likely to be repeated in a Mel
bourne theatre for a long time to come. It had
happened, however, that Theodora’s death—ti e
finishing touch to an unusually earnest perfor
ance —was spoilt by an accident to her back-hair.
As the executioner advanced, Sara observed that
she had a plait dangling over her shoulder, and at
that supreme moment she quietly pulled out a
hairpin and skewered the unfortunate hair into a
place of safety. In fact, Sara had hold of her hair
when the executioner twisted the cord round her
neck. This presence of mind is said to be one of
Sara’s strongest points. She can shed real tears
of anguish whilst surreptitiously arranging any
little thing that has gone wrong.
Another Adelaide parson has gone wrong.
He came out to the sacred city some time ago and
left a young wife and child in England. His
congregation thought him single, and the parson,
who didn’t deny the impeachment, soon began to
cultivate the acquaintance of a lady-member of
the congregation. Matters became lively, and the
clergyman booked his passage for England. The
lady’s father heard of the projected departure,
and hied himself to the vessel’s cabin, where he
found the frisky parson chanting “Abide with
me,” &c., with a “cat” congregation. That
father became indignant, and gave his reverence a
K 1 hiding in the presence of the passengers,
reverend one is now on the way to England.

A young man named Lawrence M. David-
son was introduced to a number of good Adelaide
families “ principally connected with the church
which he hadjoined,andof which he showed himself
a zealous member. ” Presently he married the elder
Of two sisters of good social position, and very
speedily ran away by mail-steamer with the
younger, who was only 18 years of age. Mr.
Davidson, at whose door charges of false-pretences
ate laid, and who is to be arrested when the mail
reaches Colombo, seems a very fair sample of the
“zealous church-member” turned out in such
large numbers just now. The Devil may now
and then miss a prayer-meeting, but he never
stays away from church.

When Dan. O’Connor accompanied Lady
Jersey to Newcastle he begged of a well-known
literary official in the local District Court to bring
his lecture on Daniel Deniehy under the notice of
the Countess on her visit to the local School of

as H. W. H. H. insisted on calling attention to
his own literary contributions, much to Daniel’s
chagrin and Lady Jersey’s amusement.

Weird stories are told of the doings of a
certain theatrical company ( not Sara’s) on the
voyage to Barataria. One fascinating creature
and her swain were, by the captain’s orders,
washed off deck with the hose at 3 a.m. And an
important official, not connected with the naviga-
tion department, was silently put ashore at
Colombo, and left there, for having been dis-
covered in somebody’s cabin under peculiarly in-
criminating circumstances. Wild horses wouldn’t
drag from us the name of the lady who was igno.
miniously doused, nor of the heroine of the cabin
incident. We merely wish to point out that every
passenger ought to be provided j with a stern,
inflexible maiden aunt; in the interests of the
proprieties. , ~

M.B.M.S. Curacoa has returned to Sydney
“ after a Highly enjoyable cruise ” in N.Z. waters.
Her first exploit on getting into Sydney harbor
was to block up the fairway at night and obstin-
ately refuse to give way to the Manly boat, which
had to leave its right course and squeeze up against
the lightship to avoid a collision. The boat (the
Narrabeen) whistled eight or nine times without
avail: not the ghost of a response came from Her
Majesty’s ship “ Curacoa.” This—let us whisper
it softly in the ear of the Admiral—looks remark-
ably like brandy and Curacoa.

Police-magistrate Pinnock, of Brisbane,
has decided—Confucius only knows why—that the
money found on any cadaver that is fished out of
the Brisbane River'belongs to the Chief Justice.
Anybody who goes out fishing with the Chief
Justice had better make a note of this, for if he goes
overboard it is to Lilley’s interest to leave him there
—if that judicial authority drags him out he, the
Jedge, will be a distinct loser by the transaction.
People who are sitting on the edge of the wharf at
midnight should also make anote of it, and if heysee
Sir Chas. Lilley coming up behind them on all fours
and'lkeeping as much as possible in the shadow
they ought to rise up and leave the spot with
all haste. Persons who have friends or relations
asphyxiated in the river ought to find out if the:
Judge was anywhere about when the deceased
fell in. Nobody supposes, of course, that the Chief
Justice would voluntarily shove anybody over the
end of a pier for the sake of the perquisites but
still, temptation ought not to be put in any man’s
way.

G.C.M.G., is represented only by the letters
“ H.P.” carved in modest letters, apparently as
an after-thought lest Parkes should be jealous.
Perhaps, also, it was an afterthought on the diplo-

Donald Wallace is evidently a legislator of
liberal cash principles. When the Victorian
Council were discussing the propriety of officially
thanking their retired clerk as John Bai-ker Esq.,
rather than plain J. 8., the owner of Carbine
suggested that “ Esq.” wasn’t any practical
evidence qf their friendly feelings towards Barker,
and the best way of showing regard was to put
one’s hand in one’s pocket. Whereupon the rest
of the Council assumed a dull, leaden expression
of countenance, and resumed the debate at the
point where the irreverent Donald had chipped
in. • Ultimately Barker was described as Esq. on
the minutes of the House, to the great satisfaction
of colonel—or is it Field Marshal ? —Softgoods
Sargood, a gentleman who loves to remember that
every knight had an esquire to polish up his tin
suits in days of old.
* # *
It was Zeal, MvP. , who suggested to knock
out the “Esquire” after his name, and others
supported him. This trifle is a sign of the times,
fof they only allowed the “ Esquire ” to stand on
the hypothesis that “ it meant nothing.”
At thh opening of Victorian Parliament,
Gov.' Hopetoun turned out in his imported
carriage, with coachee and three flunkeys in cocked
hats, plastered wigs, Windsor uniforms, or what-
ever they call ’em, knee-breeches, and stockings.
The horses were done up with ribbons, ahd what
riot. Fellah must do something to revive expiring
Loyalty. But such things are only Republican
advertisements!

Gov. Hopetoun’s twang gave quite a low-
comedian touch to the end of his speech at last
week’s opening of the Melbourne Row-Wow. Re-
citing a list of bills to be introduced during the
session, the jaw-dropping young man started
people grinning when he arrived at police
offences, thistles, religious and charitable trusts,
insects,” and was rewarded with a general laugh
when he finished up with “boilers and ceme-
teries.” Then Hopetoun looked up plaintively
from under his huge cocked hat and smiled alter
the fashion of a lay-preacher who wonders where
the joke comes in. The joke in this instance was
a simple matter of sound, of the sad and tired
monotone which inevitably sets people thinking
of things like thistles, boilers and cemeteries—
three of the most monotonous institutions on
this weary earth—before the words are spoken.

A HARMLESS SLING (OF INE).
Full of alarm,'
Sadly we sing.
Sing of that arm
Laid in a sling.
Pretty young queen
Of a toy king,
Why is she seen
Wearing a sling ?
Is it a burn—
Troublesome thing ?
Truth we would learn
Touching: that sling.
Better have “place”
Come on the wing
Than the whole face
Tied in a sling.
Fighters who fight
Rounds in a ring
Never look right
Out of a sling.
Same with a Chow,
Slanting-eyed Chiiig
Gets in a row,
Make him a sling.
Lady with charms
Fresh as the Spring
Mustn’t have arms .
Bound in a sling.
Think of the check
When she would fling,
Round hubby’s neck
Ann in a sling.
Now to a close
Ballad we bring,
Such you suppose
Easy to sling.
Yet it has got
Rhythmical swing
Certainly not
Feet in a sling.
Whenever lovely woman kneels
(As oft occurs, of course),
She prays aloud for Mister Shiels
Until she’s fairly hoarse.
And should a brutal husband’s heels
Be pressed into her chest she feels
A sense of triumph as she squeals—
“ The Law is my resource !”
Or when the giddy dawg reveals,
In staring eyes and frequent reels,
The presence of a foe that steals
Men’s brains away, or chucks his meals
About the room ’midst laughter-peals, •
That woman takes her woes or wheals
To Justice Nisi, one who heals
Her wounds with balm prepared by Shiels—
The ointment of Divorce.

Rear Bulletin, —Your paragraph as to the
action of chloroform is correct. I knew Lawrie
ivell, arid am prepared to back his opinion;
besides, attending only to the breathing and
neglecting the pulse, 1 have given it in some
Hundreds of cases without any fatality, and the
only time I ever saw signs of collapse a recourse
to artificial respiration at once restored vitality.
How long will the exploded notion that it is
necessary before giving chloroform to carefully
examine the heart continue to exist in the minds
of coroners, juries and doctors (some)? The
sound rule is that a patient who can stand the
operation can stand the chloroform, and some late
fatal cases may, perhaps, be due to the fact that
the patient could not stand the operation.—Yours,

A diver employed in salvage operations
After a N.S.W. marine disaster some time ago,
before finally fixing on his helmet, absorbed two'
bottles of beer ; then he went below—and stayed
down for an extraordinary long time without in
any way disturbing or signalling the people above.
His life-line on being pulled was found to be fast.
Something serious being apprehended, another
diver was hurriedly sent below —and found the
loose end of the life-line made fast to a stanchion
under a rock. The air-tube, being followed, led
to a cabin, where the diver was found comfortably
sleeping in a berth. This for coolness “takes
the cake.” We know of no other man who
has ever gone 30 feet below water to enjoy a quiet

One point about the Gordon-Cumming
case, writes a Bulletin correspondent, would
seem not to have been sufficiently comtiiented on,
and that is that the self-appointed band of
Watchers formed, with one exception, a purely
family party, who Were not only the hosts of the
man they watched, but, presumably, knew very
little about baccarat. It is significant that
General Owen Williams and Lord Coventry, both
old hands, were not invited to join the party, but
were only informed of the matter when the game
Was over. This, apart from other more or less
“ fishy ” incidents, throws an air of suspicion over
the whole affair, and should have given Gordon-
Cumming the verdict with any but the most
truckling jury. It would be interesting to know
what Lieutenant Lyvett’s friends think of his
conduct in forming one of a party to watch a
brother officer without taking every precaution
that there should be no mistake about the result.

Dear Bulletin, —If the world takes more
interest in its bad heroines is not the world wise
in its generation ? Does not beauty fade and do not
good men pall, and is not the virtuous heroine of
one drama as like as two peas to the virtuous
heroine of all other dramas? Can the soulless
lump of clay, whose every action can be predicted
with mathematical accuracy, ever inspire more
than a passing sympathy quickly followed by a
feeling of satiety? It is the “bad un,' m the
purely modern sense of the term, who displays the
capacity for passion and the power of ruthlessly
crushing down inane conventionalities and whose
actions, following the dictates of a strong nature
influenced only by its own impulses and regardless
of the world, lead to the unexpected in both the
real and mimic drama. The only chance for
beauteous virtue is misfortune. But for her end
who would remember Marie _ Antoinette ?—and
that perfect piece of Dresden c ina, me.
Recamier, is quite forgotten. Cora Pearl tiacirea
hair and only the beaute de dia > ,
heroine of the Second Empire could command the
same homage. Moral :It is the unknown which
attracts, and plain women rule the world.—Yours,
George Dant.

Something that looked like the beginning
of a social trouble took place the other night in a
Melbourne theatre. A party consisting of two
gentleman and two ladies came in together, and
sat down in the circle. During the performance
one of theladies dropped her fan under the seat,
and she and the two gentlemen all reached down
after it at the same moment. One of them, how-
ever, reached so violently that his waistcoat burst
open, and a letter fell down beside the fan, and
the lady picked the two articles up together.
Then she glanced at the document -the peop e
in the seat behind noticed that it was in a temaie
handwriting—and as she did so an expression of
petrified ferocity spread over her countenance.
The man who had lost the letter and hadn't
reached the fan came up smiling, though red and
dishevelled, from underneath the seat, and started
to say something in an affable way, when his eye
fell on the paper, and then a look of horrified
astonishment came over him, and his hair—he
had only one—stood straight up. He uttered a
sort of paralysed whisper to the other man, and he
shrunlc-up on the spot, and his clothes seemed to
get too large for him, and his cuffs too long, and
the ends of his pants seemed to extend twelve
inches over his boots, and the tails of his coat
appeared to grow and trail on the floor, and his
countenance became so long that it extended
down into his lap. The second lady glanced at
them and grew alarmed, and then her eye
wandered to the letter .also, and a flush spread
over her face and neck and travelled right down
her back. And after that the four of them sat
erect and grim till the end of the act, and when it
was finished the man who had shrunk up so
suddenly made his escape, and didn’t come back,
and the second lady, and the gentleman with the
one hair, got up and made a sidelong shuffle as if
they wanted to do likewise. But the woman whb
held the letter fixed her eye upon them for just
one second, and they smiled idiotically and sat
down again. Then she also smiled, and getting
up moved slowly to the dressing-room and dis-
appeared, and the man she left behind mopped
his smoking head with his handkerchief and
seemed to wish he was dead. As for the man
who had escaped, he went down the stair so fast
that he seemed to whiz in the air with his own
velocity, and got into a cab ; and the next instant
the driver was whaling his horse like 40,000 cab-
men and travelling along the street faster than a
comet.

We would draw our readers’ attention to
the “ Silver Glit,” or cure for piles. This remedy
is said to be infallible.
Brisbane Courier and Observer—the
morning and evening emanations from the
Puzacott family white elephant—have been re-
duced in size. Mute evidence that “law and
ordah ” has prevailed.
The Queensland Government are to raise
the wind by selling as much land as possible and
materially increasing the liquor-duties. The land-
grabber will profit by the first, and the hand-
workers will have to pay the larger part of the
second.
Agents required everywhere throughout
Australasia. Secretaries of friendly societies,
unions, &c., should write. Previous experience
unnecessary. Good pay and permanent positions.
For particulars, apply, the Co-Operative Irriga-
tion and Mercantile Society of Australia, Ltd.

The chairman of a western branch of the
N.S.W. Pastoralists’Union actually had the brass
to identify himself with the labour party during the
heat of the recent parliamentary election contest.
Political necessity is the mother of reversible
pants.
When a property changes hands in N.S.W.
the. auctioneer gets 2| per cent., the solicitor
about 1 per cent., and the Government is content
with a modest £ per cent, for stamp-duty on the
conveyance. Now, if the Government would take
say 5 or 10 per cent, stamp-duty on every trans-
fer, and 2h per cent, on every mortgage (it gets
nothing on mortgages at present), it would be
doing no injustice, and would help greatly to stop
land-booming. Labour party, please note.

Dear . Bulletin, —It is time we were done
with the squatter J.P. “Little Dick ”is a shep-
herd for a squatter, who is also a J.P. Little
Dick picked up a mate recently, and both got
drunk and were duly “run in.” The squatter
appeared on the bench. The charge was precisely
the same in each case, and both pleaded guilty.
Little Dick was fined 55., his mate was “ sent up ”
for a month. The squatter and his “hand” met
after the case, when the former said : “ Little
Dick, don’t you get drunk again. I could have
given you a month this morning, you know, like I
gave your mate.” “Yes, but you wanted me to
shepherd them rams.” “That’s so, Little Dick,
but don’t presume too often ; swagmen shepherds
are plentiful.” . . A squatter J.P. discharged
his servant without notice or payment. She sum-
moned him. There was no other J.P. around,
but that was a small matter for this sheep-magnate
—beg pardon, pastoralist. He mounted the
bench and heard the girl’s evidence; descended to
the witness-box as defendant, and gave his own
testimony to the grinning C.P.S., then re-mounted
the Bench and gave a verdict against the plaintiff,
Our informant forgot to tell us whether lie also
gave costs against the girl and pocketed the money.
Another squatter J.P. also had a difficulty with
his domestic—a new girl—who was rather fiery-
tempered. When he remonstrated with her, she
told him to “go further,” as she had discovered
that her “bed” consisted of a rotten mattress
which had been the camp-rags of a Chow. 'I he
squatter then said she might go, and that a cart
would be ready to take her back to “the town-
ship”—lB miles distant, on a lonely bush-track,
with scarcely a house on it, and a night coming on
as dark as pitch. The girl got ready, and the cart
duly arrived, driven by a bleary-eyedOhmair.an—•
presumably the one who had roosted on the
mattress. “I’m not going with that dirty ould
haythen,” said Mary. “Then you can go and
sleep under a tree,” said squatter J.P. Fancy
this to a white girl! There is a well-
known temperance-lecturer who somehow in-
curred the resentment of an equally well-known
bush-magistrate. TheT.L. started his open-air
show one day as usual. The magistrate called to
a rough, strong man, a brewer’s employb, and
said—“ I’ll give you a crown to go up and smack
Mr. (the T.L.) in the face.” “No fear;
because if I do I’ll get into trouble.” “If you
get into trouble,” said the beak, “ I’ll bail you
out and I’ll be on the Bench in the morning and
see that the case is dismissed as a trivial one.”—
Yours, Bushman.

AYER’S PIERS are unsurpassed as a
remedy for constipation, biliousness, sick-head-
acho, dyspepsia, jaundice, and the common
derangements of stomach, liver, and bowels.
They break up colds, mitigate fevers, relieve
gout, rheumatism, and neuralgia, cleanse the
system of malarial poison, and assist in the
formation of pure, rich blood. These -well-
known pills are compounded of the essential
virtues of the best vegetable cathartics, and
contain neither calomel nor any other deleteri-
ous drug. They may, therefore, be adminis-
tered in all cases where a purgative is needed,
without fear of ill effects. Being sugar-coated,
they are pleasant to take, and their medicinal
strength is preserved for an indefinite period
and in any climate. They should ho in every
domestic medicine chest and traveller’s satcliei.

The waterbury watches.
are so cheap that anybody can afford to own
one. A watch, however, to be cheap must be ser-
viceable ; it must be both accurate and reliable,
and in all other ways perform the functions of a
first-class timekeeper. In these particulars the
wonderful Waterbury Watches exactly “fill the
bill.” Therefore, because cheap, do not think
they are only toys or “ good enough for children.”
They have all the traits of the best makers, and as
they add to these unusual strength and durability,
besides cheapness, they are essentially the watches
for the mechanic, the farmer, the clerk, the work-
ing man and woman—in a word, The Watches
for the People.
Series E, the old long-winding favorite, the

THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN
ST. JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
Ist, It is in one word a cure ; it is not merely
a relief, and in no sense a cure all; it is the
product of scientific research.
2nd. It strengthens while it soothes and sub-
dues, heals, and cures ; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the whole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.
4th. It does not merely irritate the outer sur-
face, nor does it merely soften or relax a con-
stricted muscle. To its specific action a superior
curative virtue is superadded.
sth. It penetrates deeply but gently; seareh-
ingly and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer.
6th. Each constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain.
For rheumatism, neuralgia, sprains, bruises,
stiff joints, swellings, and similar ailments ; St.
Jacobs Oil has positively no equal if used accord-
ing to the directions which accompany each bottle.
Ache 3 and pains succumb in a truly marvellous
manner to the potent influence of this world-
famed remedy. Thousands of testimonials have
from time to time been published in the Aus-
tralian press—testimonials from all ranks and
conditions of men—from statesmen, judges,
eminent divines, barristers, the medical profession,
merchants, athlete; &c., and a though a large
standing reward has been offered to any one who
could produce proof that any one of these was not
strictly genuine, none have dared to question their
authenticity, tinder these circumstances is it to
be wondered at that the sale of St. Jacobs Oil
greatly exceeds the combined sales of all other
advertised lotions, liniments, embrocations, &c.,
in the world ? No home can afford to be without
a bottle of it always handy, and purchasers would
do well to observe that they get the genuine article
and not one of the many spurious preparations
made up to trade upon the enormous reputation
which St. Jacobs Oil has built up for itself ujon
the solid foundation of merit.

One of the marked features of Sydney
commercialism is the immense strides made: by

Co., 254 & ,256 George-street, Sydney, the im-
porters of sports’ material, dealers in harness and
saddle-makers’furniture, builders’ plumbers’ and
gasfittsrs* materials and locksmiths’ and,
tools,. In fact so great is, their increase of business
that their stores, fpur in number, ar.e totally in-
adequate to contain the large stocks of good*; con- |
tinually arriving to their order. This is the place :

i The Marchipness of Bute, wife of one of
the bOss Sweatefs and millionaires of Britain, has
started a mdyeriieflt.tb reform the victuals Of thd
Britisfi people., She demands that they shOfiJd
give up tea and pigs-feet and sugar and: bacon,
iind should i cease to live in imperial; riot and
luxury on an occasional salt herring; and instead
of this wild and costly grub they are to eat brown
bread, rice, maccaroni, and an occasional green
vegetable. Also, they are to learn . the great
virtue, of contentment, and give up going on
strike, and be ’umblet, for Britain is going to
blazes through the extravagance of the. ‘‘ lower
orders,” who, when they peel a potato, rise up j
recklessly and throw away the skin. And in one j
sense this elevated she-prig is right, for the ‘‘lower
orders ” are in a tight place, and must give up I
something, if they want to avoid insolvency, j
Most probably they will give up the old nobility
as an act of unavoidable self-denial, and mortify j
the flesh by stooping the interest on the National !
Debt. And if they find they can’t pay for meat j
they will have to let the royal family slide, for
there is ail awful lot of meat about it, and it costs
more per lbs than any other meat that was ever
heard of.
, t thm flu in a Melbourne i paper : “When
first discovered the body was floating face-down-
wards, and the scalp was flopping about on the
surface with the motion of the water.” That is
the principal feature of the story, and there is
about a column of it, accompanied by tears and
poetry. The substance of it is about this : One
female dressed in black, and furnished with a
baby, probably afflicted with blind staggers ; one
large eel in pocket and crab fixed in back-hair;
pawn-ticket and one pint of slush in another
pocket. First seen by Constable O’Hooligan ;
fished out by Constable O’Higgins ; carried to
the morgue with the assistance of Constable
O’Finnigan. Statement at the inquest by
Constable O’Hogan that he believed the deceased
was identical with a person that he had frequently
obser-r-rved at different times in various places at
all hours of the day, but hadn’t spoken to her,
owing to her being appar-r-rently just the same
as any other per-r-rson. Further evidence by a j
Salvation Army official to the effect that he
didn’t know the deceased either, but if he had
known her would have taken her at once to a cer-
tain pious institution which is now in much need
of funds, in consequence of which donations are
urgently requested. Verdict.
One of the curiosities of Melbourne is an
insolvent money-lender. Less than 12 months ago
his advertisement glared out conspicuously in all
the papers, stating that he was prepared to lend
any sum from £5 to £5OOO without security,
promptly, with the utmost secresy, and at lowest
current rate, repayment any time you liked.
Also he would buy up your interest under your
will; or purchase your of adiahee
jnoney on a bill with two good names on the back,
or take over your reversionary interest, or be a
father to you without any extra charge, or if
money had been left to, you he would fix up an
arrangement whereby you could have a sudden
and immediate burst, and then the money would
be left to him instead. Then his advertisement
disappeared, and he took to leaning up against
lamp-posts in a ragged and pensive state, and lent
£5 to £5OOO rio longer. It is rumoured that he got
hard-up through some temporary extravagance,
and borrowed money from himself on a bill.
Then he couldn’t pay when it fell due, and he
called at his own office and renewed the document
at a steep percentage, and when the second bill
becaiiie pavable there was a painful scene between
him and himself, and he had to give a mortgage
bn all his property, and the interest fell into
arrear, and there were more bills, and in a
moment of indignation he callecf himself a skin-
flint and a money-grabber, and then he rushed at
himself and threw himself out of the office, and he
sued himself for libel and had to pay damages,
and after that he brought a counter charge of
assault against himself, and finally he sold him-
self up, and the proceeds went in law expenses.
And now his premises are closed, and the man
who wants to blow out his annuity knocks in vain
at the door, and arouses only a hollow echo, like
the ghost of a lost mortgage; and the elderly
maiden lady who sleeps on the floor because her
furniture has all been seized under a bill of sale,
comes to weep at the keyhole and call down
judgments on his head no longer ; and even the
elderly man with the bald head, who rashly went
“shecurity” for a friend, has abandoned the
place, and all is emptiness.

Messrs. Perkins and Co., Limited.
CITY BREWERY, BRISBANE.
One of the best known brewing firms in Australia
is Messrs. Perkins & Co., Limited, having an
establishment in Brisbane and another at Too-
woomba, The headquarters of this important
Company is the City Brewery, Brisbane—with
! premises extending from Mary-street to Margatef-
street with two frontages of 198 feet each.
Although the details of brewing as practised bjy
Messrs. Perkins & Co., Limited-, is much in keep-
ing with many other important Australian j
breweries, yet the generalPrganisaViori’, 'cleanliness
and effectiveness 'of. their establishment, is worth
ft passing iiptic'e. The outgrowth of the business'
dates fWttt Toowoomba where Messrs. Perkins &
CO.’, stktljecl ‘the Downs Brewery in 1869, and the
shcOesh nf enterprise, ryas so great that they
iVere lhducep tq extend,operations to Brisbane in
187$. En ftaspahi, it may be mentioned, that the
‘Downs Brewery is still famous for the goodness qf
.its ‘‘ br^.w,’ : which is in great demand throughout
the South-Western and Western districts _of
Queensland. Messrs. Perkins & Co., having
gained considerable popularity as expert brewers,
coupled with a fast increasing and prosperous
trade, they proposed to form the business
into a Limited Liability Company, and,
needless to say, the shares offered were
readily subscribed for. In Match, 188& fcpb coin-
pany was floated with a ptesehfccapital of £112,500,
divided into 1-30,000 shates df 15$. each, 100,000
fully paid up afid 56’,6d0. shares paid up to ss. The
Company’s pteifiises 5h Brisbane are well known
tP UliUdst 'eVety Queenslander, but, among the
aVp spoken of as the old building and
Ih'e hew. building, the latter premises having been
, Vi , r ..ijji 18So, The
lower .'portion, of the
nevy building consi.-.ts
pf five floors, each of
.which contains a spe-
cial feature for the
manipulation of tho
liquor. Over all is a
top floor with tank
fixtures capable of
holding 50,000 gallons
of filtered water.
Then comes the mash*
ing-room and sugar-
boiling room the
sugar when boiled
leaves a strong skint
of dirt aiid debris,
Which . is . 'carefully
removed before tlb’
d iseolVed sdfar is add;
<od to tile liquor. This
btOceSs is h Strong im-
p’roVerheftt on the old-
Kshiohed system still
followed t by some
brewers of dumping
raw sugar into the
boiling beer. Next
in turn comes the
“wart” boiler, cap-
able of boiling 80
hogsheads at a time.
From thence we follow on to the refrigew
ating-room, and further on to tiie fermenting-
room and beer-store, the two latter occupy-
ing the largest spaces in the building. In
the fermenting room is observed four large
“ tuns,” capable of putting through 60 hogsheads
each. As we proceed, the size of the building
would seem to increase, for there is the hop-room
and store-rooms. In the latter, the beer and
porter is allowed to settle and mature, before
being “bottled” and “cased” in the usual four
dozens to meet the demands of trade. In addi-
tion to a very large trade of hogshead bulk beet 4 *
Messrs. Perkins and Co., Limited, are one of the
very few Australian brewing Coittpahies to suc-
cessfully introduce bottled ale and ( stout in such
Condition ,and finish as .Vo equal the imported
article. Their bottled stout is a speciality, so
Vribch so, that coihpetent judges have given the
preference to stou't made and bottled in Brisbane,
'as compared with som'e well-known imported
brands frOnf Great Britain. Messrs. Perkins’
bulk ale is Well knoWn all over Queensland —from
the Gulf Of Carpentaria On the oUe side, to the
furthest Western and southern boundaries of the
'colony on the other. It has a bright, clear appear-
ance, pleasant to the palate, and, as a refreshment
or beverage, is particularly agreeable to the'climate
of Queensland, which is evidently unsuited to the
use of ardent spirits. Throughout the City
Brewery cleanliness predominates. This is
especially noticeable in the largo cellar, 200 ft. X
36ft., having an asphalted floor with a floor
throughout. Cemented channels are formed the
whole length of the cellar, ahd ft free Use of Water
keeps the floor clean and wholesome-. Thecellar fias ,
storage-room for 600 hogsheads pet week. There is st
large underground tank Capable of holding 200,000
gallonspf,Water fts ah emefgeficy supply. The ou t side \
appointments of the establishment are excellent.
Large stabile's containing the'ii|ual dapper brewers
horses-, cboperage, cask-cleaning floors (supplied
With steam jets), and so forth. The last dividend
by Perkins and Co., Ltd., was eight per.
cent;, about four months ago. The directors and
officials connected with the company are as
follows : Hon. W. G. Power, M.L. A. (Chairman),
Messrs. William Williams, John Sinclair, and A.
D. Cotton (Melbourne); General Manager, Mr. S,.
M. Cay ; Secretary, Mr. James Munro : Brewers,
Mr. William Gooley, Brisbane ; Mr. D. T. Dillon,
Toowoomba.
A cu.ri.ous red fish, the alulua, turns up in
shoals about the Hawaiian Islands at irregular
intervals, and when they invade the harbour of
Honolulu the natives recognise that bne bf the
royal family is doomed. A feW mofiths ftgo this
visitation came along, ftnd the inhabitants resolved
that Slug Kalakajia Was about to light out for a
bettet lpud. { And, sure enough, Kalakaua did
light out just 20 days later. It is a very poor
royal family that hasn’t some solemn portent
deposited in a cool spot, to trot out when a death
is going to happen. Even the Imperial House of
Britain is provided in this respect, i When the
Queen begins to scatter money about recklessly,
and forgets about Brown, it will be a sure sign
that something is looming.

RHEUMATISM versus MICROBE
KILLER.
294 Castleresgh-street, June 25, 1891.
Radam’s Microbe Killer Co., Gentlemen,—For
forty years I have been a sufferer from rheu-
matism, and latterly in the most aggravated f5rm,
often having acute attacks which made me almost
helpless for days, insomuch that it was with the
greatest pain and difficulty that I could move
about at all, and only able to get up stairs on my
hands and knees. A friend who had tried the
“Microbe Killer” with beneficial results sent me
a jar of the medicine, which I took, and I have
now taken three jars of “Microbe Killer” and
the result has been a great wonder to myself and
my friends, for now I can get about freely, with-
out pain. I go up and down stairs without any
trouble, and I am greatly improved in health
every way. In fact my suffering from rheumatism
seems a thing of the past, and I can recommend
the “ Microbe Killer ” to anyone with confidence,
knowing what it has done for me. Several have
tried your medicine on my recommendation for
other diseases —and one a cancer patient—with
the same beneficial results. —Yours respectfully,

My DKAR MOORABINDAt
1t is to be sincerely hoped, now that more women are,
from inclination or necessity, going in for the single life,
that the path of the lonely spinster-will be a little more
rosy than it hitherto has been, more especially in connec-
tion with boarding-houses. Only recently an American
actress was refused admission to an Australian hotel
simply because she hadn’t an alleged husband among her
traps ; and the hard fight any woman has to get a den at
a boarding-house is enough to drive her to the altar. I
was parleying with a hash-house duchess on the subject
of women boarders the other day. “ Why don’t you like
them as well as men?” quoth I—“ don’t they keep earlier
hours and eat less ?” But the high prophetess of rechauffe
slowly shook her head. “Lady boarders, indeed!” she
said, “I wouldn’t take one for 10 guineas a week. It’s
hot water if the weather’s a bit dull; then she knocks
me up at 2 a.m. because the cat ran up the stairs and she
thought it was a burglar; then complains regularly that
the sheets aren’t aired ; next she wants a housemaid dis-
missed because she's lost an inch of faded ribbon ; she
flirts at and ogles my best boarder to spooning-point, and
then I am solemnly called upon to dismiss him because he
tried to kiss her on the stairs ! No more lady boarders
for me,” concluded she, warmly ; “ I have tried them,
and now this establishment is for men only.”' But I
couldn’t help smiling a cold and frosty smile as I drifted
away down the street. You see, this lady had four mar-
riageable daughters and but marriageable daughters
are not the only reason why the unattached damsel has a
difficulty in getting a roof over her devoted head—espe-
cially when she trickles round without a persona l
reference.
Apropos spinsters, it ought to be a warning to the
frantic supporters of the W omen’s College, that of five ladies
who tore through an English ’varsity last year and came
out with alphabetical tails to their names and other
honours—only one has achieved a husband, while the
others are holding mediocre teaching appointments,
here, there and everywhere. Now, I wonder if the local
girl grad, really grasps the fate she is preparing for her-
self by “ cramming ” during her attractive days ? The
eternal grind of underpaid teaching—the mob of stupid,
rebellious pupils are all she has to hope for ? “ What,"
says somebody, “is to prevent her marrying?” Why,
this. Bound down to her books when she is at her
prettiest and best, she emerges-a B. A. perhaps—at the
age, say, of twenty-two, with the face of a woman of
thirty, and the stooping shoulders of a pedagogue. The
average man doesn’t want to marry an encyclopaedia, and
the woman who has spent her beauU du diable in acquir.
ing a vast amount of college information is passed over in
favour of some fresh-faced little fool who opens two wide
astonished eyes when George loftily tells her that gas is
extracted from coal. As a leading Sydney doctor—con-
nected “at home” with a family of rapid female pedants
—laughed to me recently, “ Sophie is a 8.A., poor girl.
A Sydney friend went to England the other day and they
asked him to stop with them, but he was bent on holiday-
making, couldn’t stand the intellectual pressure and
fled. Ths worst of it is that all the young men seem to
have fled, too.”
Come out—as they allege—principally to do the sun-
trick in balmy Australia, Sir Charles and Lady Hall 6
were more than disgusted at the muddy, squally weather
which signalised their reception at the MStropole on 24th
inst. Nevertheless there were mobs at it, and the lift for
some time was full of dazed visitors who hadn’t the
foggiest idea which way to go when they got to the second
(Stage and looked round in a helpless way until a waiter
magnanimously put them through. Lady Hall A-som-
ewhat stouter than last year (she enjoyed the voyage out
immensely)—wore a festive reception array in true pinky
heliotrope; the corselet bodice of velvet and the skirt of
silk ; full sleeves of matching chiffon trimmed with bands
of silver-spangled galon which also trimmed the bodio-
finished off at the neck with Directoire flounce i.
embroidered chiffon; bonnet in basket-straw trimmed
}n flowers and bows and strings of dark-purple velvet,
diamond brooch. Mddle. Filliinger (a small, smooth-
haired little being) in claret-surah with “dove’’-front in
cream, with gloves; Mrs. Charles Hall 4, electric-blue
cloth, bonnet in cream, white gloves; MadameKellermann
in a fetching visite of black velvet, jet embroidery and
fox-fur, small black jet bonnet. Mrs. Vanderveer Greene
in a workmanlike gown of bottle-green cloth and beaver-
fur. Bessie Rignold, in a dove-coloured cloak, came with
William Rignold, who has oaken to waxing his mustivy
since the trip ’Ome ; and Captain Le Patourel was seen
for once without that funny little dog at his heels. After-
noon tea was served here, there and everywhere, and a
crackling fire made the crowded reception-room a little
too cosy, perhaps.
It is clever of Lady Hall 6 to gown herself so charmingly
in public, for though the soulless portion of the female
audience may allow its attention to wander from even the
most seraphio fiddling, yet it never unglues its eye from a
fetching turn-out, and so listens in spite of itself. At the
first Hall 6 concert in the Centennial Hall on a recent wet
night, Lady H. wore a beautiful biscuit-coloured satin,
brocaded in bouquets of pale-green flowers and trimmed
with a basque of pleated pale-green ohiffon, which also
fell from the front of the diamond-studded corsage;
diamonds were also worn in her neatly-arranged hair. La
Filliinger (who had not quite gauged the hall and was
inaudible when singing with the half-voice) looked the
very double of a Sydney Judge’s daughter—fit pf her
gown, way of standing and all; and Burton, in black and
red, quite spoilt herself by that big bottle-brushy aigrette.
In the audience—a large proportion of which was bare-
necked sassiety girl—l only saw two thrills worth alluding
to. One, worn by a bride (mind you, I really didn’t know
■he wassich—l only guessed so through the trousseau-
like newness of her gown and wrap and the confiding
angle she described towards the sloping shoulder of her
attendant swain) was of sea-green bengaline trimmed
with gold galon jewelled in emeralds, the gown finished
off with green chiffon and ribbons ; the other, worn by a
blonde society miss, was of black silk, the bodice cut low
and filled in with drawn black gauze, and trimmed with
flashing emerald passementerie, crimson velvet wrap.
The second Halle concert, on 27th ult., was a largely-
attended function, seeing as how it was “V.R.,”anda
nice, starry evening too. Lord and Lady Jersey, the
eldest daughter, Captain “Chumlcy” and Mr. Goschen,
were posed on the red fauteils of patronage, half-a-yard
off the stage on the ground-floor, while the reserved
balconyites, who expected the gubernatorial party up
there as usual, gnashed their teeth and focussed their
opera-glasses on the distinguished bevy. There wasn’t
much worth focussing, though. Lady Jersey wore a
trying black silk dinner-gown, made with a bertha bodice
and no sleeves, relieved with a cluster of pinky heliotrope
flowers on the left shoulder, and a three-tier ruby and
diamond necklace ; wrap, in scarlet, lined with white and
trimmed gold bullion tassels; managerial nosegay in
pink, purple and white flowers ; her daughter, in white
and cream, trimmed with silver braid, and white cloak
edged with swansdown. On the stage—need I say it ?
Lady Halil had the noblest frocking of them all (the
badly-dressed audience—lots in hats and jac.Kets, lots in
pointless nun’s veiling rags—looked very dismal as she
came forth in a buttercup satin, brocaded with a line
design in white flag lilies and leaves, finished at the hem
with a flounce of yellow chiffon, caught with curves of
silk guipure, the bodice trimmed with guipure, ending
in gold fringe and finished with elbow sleeves and deep
ruche of yellow chiffon; diamond ornaments.) Lady H-
was in inspiring form, and the “adagio” movement of
the Beethoven (duet)Sonata in E Flat, withits artistically:
played organ chords made lots of people think the loca 1
white elephant was being introduced in a sub-rosa sort of
way.
The musical programme was all pure joy, needless to
say, but perhaps a little over the head of a typical fat
lady in an embroidered opera-cloak in front of me, who
took up her programme with a resigned sigh and com-
menced reading the words of the songs when Sir Charles
Halil sat down. By the way, why doesn’t the “Much
Travelled,” junior, see that his minions enforce the rule
keeping people out during the performance of a number ?
When Sir Charles finished the allegro in Waldstein’s
sonata and paused between the movements, a regular
tribe of late-comers came crashing through the doorways,
and the artist had to wait quite five minutes ere they
settled down. Which plays the very mischief with
continuity, and brings one back to earth with a bump, a s
it were.
The last June “ at home ” of Government House on 23rd
ultimo, was really a concert with refreshments com-
mencing at the blinking hour of a quarter to ten when
the last guest arrived and Lady Jersey was at liberty to
leave her position as welcoming hostess and come into the
ball-room (where the concert was held) to set the pro-
gramme going. The card—sweetly-scented and printed
in blue—was attractively compiled. Mrs. Vanderveef
Greene (who wore a handsome gown of white satin draped
with pale-bluecrlpe chiffon with a skirt panelofcutsteeland
jewels, the bodice edged with pale-blue ostrich tips) exer-
cised her liquid expressional contralto in two soli and a
duet—her first item being “ Three Fishers.” Eille Nor-
wood whistled ; Ernest Hutcheson (a society girl who was
dying to hear herself talk, began to chat during his
“ Rhapsody ” but was promptly hushed down) gave two
items; and several well-known amateurs contributed.
As for the frocking ’twas a fine evening and fine feathers
resulted. Lady Jersey wore cream satin brocaded in tiny
floral designs and trimmed with little tufts of dark-green
feathers, green feather fan, and pearl and diamond
jewellery; Miss Stephen wore a Jubilee-red gown ; a
doctor’s wife in grey had too much drapery on her pin
cushioned figure; and a vice-consul’s lady in white
armure and chiffon frills looked very angelic. “God Save
the Queen ” told the guests when it was time to go.
Referring to the Jerseys—that little habit they’ve gcj,
of remaining while the final “God Save,” &c., is being
sawn out merely as hint to the audience to go away, i g
rather unwise, and tends to make the vice-regal depar-
ture a lame and impotent spectacle. At the Halil
concert they remained standing while Mr. Sykes pounded
out the Anathema, and then cut their gubernatorial stick
amidst profound and surprised silence and the mental
execrations of those “loyal” wights who don’t like to
leave before the Guv’nah. Now, it is more imposing and
effective (vice-regal people should never lose sight of the
circus element in their goings and comings) for the
Queen’s representative to stalk out as the moth-eaten
National Anathema is being played. For myself, I (though,
being a woman, I doat on Royalty, efcc.) really hate the
air of “God Save the Queen.” It is so odiously Little-
Bethel-hymn-like. What a wretched, hypocritical, psalmy
production it sounds as compared with the “Marseillaise,’’
or the Russian hymn, or “The Watch on the Rhine”—or,
for the matter of that, the song which the chief blackfellow
chants at the corroboree 1
Quite the fashionable caper during the late wet weather
has been to “do ” the new and palatial seven-storied
Australia Hotel, situated in Castlereagh-street. From
the vast Moorish vestibule with the crimson and fawn
marble stairway leading out of it, also, on the other side,
the large bar-room, the many mirrors which seem to
point the moral that the attendant Hebes’ charms are
going to stand reflecting, right up to the flag-pole on the
“Excelsior” dome, the Australia is perfectly planned
and appointed. But unless one “inventoried” like an
an auctioneer, one couldn’t give an idea of the general
artistic sumptuousness of this splendid hotel. The Aus-
tralia certainly has “success” written all over its gilded
brow. Fancy, oh women ! the rapture of camping in a
palace where the management sets apart a private room
for ladies who are too lazy (the courteous, violet-eyed
manager said “indisposed”) to rise and dress for the
general breakfast. Though all this joy isn’t publicly
available as yet, several of the suites are already engaged.
You say I looked pained and tired—that mournfully I
demean—that gone is the smile you admired while my
laugh sounds as if it were hired—well, I’ve been to
“Evangeline.” Why the man who knocked out the
dialogue, and the other being who owns up to having
concocted the music, allow their names to be blazoned on
the bill isn’t exactly apparent, to we—it nly shows,
though, how utterly incompetent anybody who translates
his inner consciousness into quavers and commas is to
truly estimate the value (or otherwise—principally other-
wise) of his own work. In “ Evangeline ” the music was
Chinese-y, v ith lots of big drum' in it- and the talk, 1
think, would disgrace a biscuit-bag. But the dresses were
brilliant, and the good, old Gaiety principle of tights,
followed out to the last possibility, helped to keep the
stalls full. Fanny Liddiard’s white satin trimmed with
bands of red velvet and silk pom-poms in the two colours
was “ gyp,” as also was her yellow silk classic garment
with yellow chiffon sleeves and a girdle of mock jewels.
The bead-clad Amazons were a sparkling spectacle, too r
but intellect demands something more in an alleged
“burlesque ” than silk and sawdust. “ Evangeline ’’ is a,
spectacle for children—very credulous children.
One or two hostesses who have introduced the paid
professional element into their musical shivoos are
mourning over the extreme “ difficulty ” of these hired
warblers who chortle their little lilt, and then, unless the
distracted hostess comes personally each time to over-
whelm them with flattery and keep them amused until
the next item, sit with their noses in the air smiling a
superior, tooth-achey smile at the unoffending crowd. The
other evening a well-known Sydney singer snapped out
her vocal contribution and then announced her intention
of going home as the hostess did not come to thank her,
and stood with her back turned. But her amour propre
was soothed somehow, and she stayed to supper. Then a
Sydney hostess, who would fain encourage local music,
wrote to a not very special songstress offering her five
guineas to come and sing two songs. But that proud and
expensive being replied that if Mrs. Dash would kindly
include her cab-fare, Miss Blank would accept her terms.
Needless to say another and less extortionate nightingale
got the contract.
The second Sydney Rl-union, held at Nithsdale the
other evening, was a most successful dance, brightened by
lots of pretty frocks. Miss Blanche Turner wore a lemon-
coloured brocade trimmed with flounces and basques of
lemon-coloured chiffon, the skirt trimmed with tufts of
ostrich feathers; Miss Annie Wilson, in well-cut black and
jet, white feather fan ; another pretty frock was of pink
silk and chiffon, floral fan. But—there is always a “but”
—one strange get-up reminded me of the old lady who
didn’t like glaring colours, but preferred blue and red —
fancy a ti'ain half blue and half crimson ! Also, one or
two eccentric damsels in night-gown costumes had their
bushy hair arranged a la darkest Africa.
There is a biting of thumbs in certain quarters over the
alteration of the location of a charming actress, and some
people say the first house would suit the exacting lady
better than the final fixture. An alleged reason given for
the change is that there isn’t room for her scenery in
theatre No. 1, and that the dressing-rooms are too
“ornery” for the beautiful being, but, as a matter of
cold, emotionless fact, all the drops and props and clothes
of her most dazzling production, the only accessories she
brought with her (the rest being manufactured here) are
at present stored in theatre No. I—proving the existence
of adequate storing space ; and, as for the dressing-rooms
—the lessee of No. 1 intended fitting up the big property-
room for her to pin her clothes on in, and if that didn’t
suit her, what would? But they say the theatrical milk
in the cocoanut is easily accounted for. Somebody wants
to boom the Pitt-street show-trade for certain transparent
reasons.
Speaking of actress's “ props” reminds me that one or
two people are railing because the Divine Sara has
brought several cases of preserved vegetation “ just as
if,” they chorus indignantly, “ there wasn’t any greenery
in Australia !” This is the sort of person who couldn’t
detect the slightest incongruity if Cleopatra’s barge hove
in sight festively adorned with bottle-brushes and
gum-leaves, or if her gilded palace-garden was simply
a maze of “ tickey ” bush. The divine and clear-sighted
Sara would have a long way to look before she found a
passable substitute for Nile cactus or the weird Nile
reeds in the Sunny South—unless she resorted to
diagrams, green paint and calico.
From England the news comes that on 4th April, at St.
Michael’s Church, London, Miss Nellie Cox, of Sydney,
became the bride of the blonde and silent Captain W. M.
Le Poer Trench—eldest son of Colonel Trench—who is
well remembered in Sydney as the reticent A.D.C. to
Lord Carington. The wedding was very quiet. There
w'ere no bridesmaids—and the pretty bride was married
in a tailor-built gown.
Another wedding (on 23rd ult.) was a very glittering
pageant—Miss Bessie Aarons—youngest daughter of Mr.
Louis Aarons (of the Exchange) was united to Mr. Walter
Hardy, son of Mr. John Hardy, of Sydney, in a gown of
satin duchesse, chiffon, point lace and orange-blossoms—
her five bridesmaids in cream cloth costumes trimmed
with bullion lace and emerald passementerie. The cere-
mony took place at “The Pines,” Randwiek, and the
wedding-party was numerous and handsomely attired.
Ere setting out for the honeymoon the happy pair joined
in a quadrille with the bridesmaids and groomsmen.
An ideally quiet wedding was that of Miss Christina
M’lntosh, daughter of Hon. John M’lntosh, of “ Lind-
say,” Darling Point, to Mr. Harry M. Flood (son of
Mr. E. Flood) on 17th ult. The wedding took place quite
privately in the drawing-room at “Lindsay,” only rela-
tives and one or two very old friends being present. The
bride wore a travelling dress of crimson serge with velvet
plateau hat en suite trimmed with jet; her one bridesmaid
in cream. Honeymoon at Laurel Park, Burradoo, the
country residence of the bride’s father.
Major H. C. Dane’s sudden and passionate admiration
for Sydney and its climate is at last fully accounted for.
He has been lecturing to a lady in private—is to be
married on 17th inst. to Miss Jenny Cook, third daughter
of Mr. “ Sam ” Cook, manager of S.M. Herald.
On June 17th Mr. “Jack” Woolcock, barrister, of
Brisbane, was married to Miss Gertrude Harpur, of Sum*
merhill, Sydney. The bride (who followed her 15 brides-
maids instead of them following her) wore white
Bengaline and brocade, and left for the Bowral honeymoon
in crimson cloth gown braided in black, plateau hat en
suite. Of the bridesmaids, 12 wore nasturtium-red gowns
trimmed with beaver-fur, the three little maidens wearing
the fashionable greenaway costumes. There was a large
wedding-party.
It is related of Sara B. that on the evening she stayed at
the Grosvenor, Sydney, dinner was served, gongs clanged,
and chairs had been arranged, and the company seated—
but no Sara came. High and low, no Sara either, until*
when everybody was at the last extremity of bewilder-
ment, a silvery laugh was heard, and out popped La
Bernhardt from under the table! She said she wanted to
study how people put their feet in sitting down.

150 souls, who ate and drank and danced and sung till
four in the morning. During the evening Mr. Tart, who
was in great voice, announced that he had been waited on
by five delegates from the Trades and Labour Council,
who asked him to induce his employees to join the
Waitresses’ Union, and said that he left them to choose
for themselves. If they desired to become members of
the union, they were left free to do so. If they did not
desire to join, then he would be be unwilling to persuade
them to take that step.

frenzied with impotent, rage, but as the political
Labour barometer ascends, it-gradually, calms
down. Next week it will probably begin to pat
the Labour party on the back. This journalistic
cooling-down recalls the high-toned French paper
on Napoleon’s escape from Elba : “The tiger has

No. IX.—The Liberation of the Fir At Three.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
u JJelow, there !”
The words, of the call beat against the walls Of
the shaft, were thrust (so „it seemed) from side to
side, aad throbbed into silence in the darkness at
its bottom. There was no echo, but up the sixty
feet of timbered opening rung instantly metallic
sounds, and then, a moment later, ari, answering
shout. •
“ Yes, sir ! Here, sir 1”
“Show yourselves!”
The speaker bent over the platform and peered
down.
“One, two —three, four —five, six !” he counted.
“Right! . Auyr complaints ?”
“ No, sir !” came up*,
“Good night l And, Page, the grating ?”
Lieut, Qooke, iu command of the Port Arthur
Coal Mlfees 3>ep6t, with its gang of to-be-pecu-
ii»*ly-punished convicts, so ordered; and Lieut.
CoofcftV myrmiclons in present attendance thrust
upon the mouth of the pit ' the iron grating
Which saved His Majesty the cost of a night
sentry’s services by blocking the egress of the
prisoners in No. 3 pit. The men of the Regime
trusted few things to chance, The half-doßeh
men in the galleries were ddubl.y-irottea—trebly,
if you reckon also the links Which bound each to
another ; they were separated from the surface by
sixty feet of ladderless shaft; arid yet had there
been nothing else to hold them to the spot Where
the tender mercies of the Local Government had
lodged them, the men of the Regime .thought the
chances were still in favour of their escaping.
Whereupon the Regime, being crippled in the
strength of its military guard, hit upon the ex-
pedient of a grating to take the place of a sentry.
A grating with double padlocks, with inch-thick
bars forged in the workshops at the Settlement
specially under the eye of Commandant Dr.
Rossell, and with interstice's, perhaps, of twq.
fingers’ breadth. If the pit-workers had any chance
of escape that grating removed it. So the Regime
thought.
* # #
Yet so utterly oblivious were those wretches
immured in the galleries of No. 3, “ Murderers’
Pit”—No. 1 was “Forgers’,” and No. 2 was
“ Gomorrah ”—of the views and desires of the
Authorities that for some weeks past they had been
bent upon -escaping. They didn’t care a “ brass ’’
for the Regime, or for those illustrations'of the.
Regime's loving-kindness—the irons, the ladder-
less state of the shaft and the grating. Their
difficulty was—food. It was useless attempting
to escape without a stock of food, sufficient to last
them for three weeks er a month. And the
supreme problem of existence .to them resolved
itself into the question how they were to steal the
tations.
There were six of them, only a moiety of them
murderers. And those who had not murdered
were particularly unwilling to face the grim
recesses of the scrub which surrounded the “ coal-
mines ” without an ample supply of rations.
Macquarie Harbour had been broken up a year or
so, aud the murderous moiety were part of the lot
from Hell’s Gates. That was why the other three
were especially disinclined to attempt a bolt with-
out well-filled pockets. Each of the Harbour men
was doing a second “ life ” term for escaping from
a Sarah island gang. Each had bolted, and each
had been recaptured—with a slavering mouth, that
symptom of an infamy. The non-murderous Three
paled, in the gloom of the galleries, when they
learnt, each from his brother-hewer, what had
caused the slavering. The gourmand is ever
smacking his lips over the remembrance ot -some
especially choice menu. The Three with the
blood dyed records were gourmands.
* * *
Jones, Tooth, Hardy—these constituted
the murderful moiety. Phillips, Bunt, West—
these were the three who paled at the recital
of the others’ banquet. By chains of 3fi links
(say nine feet from the basil of one. waist to the
Waist of the other), was Jones fastened to Phillips,
and Tooth to Bunt, and Hardy to West. Until
Death or his twin-brethren of the Regime chose to
part them were the couples to remain thus em-
braced.
In this companionship the men walked and
slept—“mealed’’and “reported” themselves. In
this companionship were they to live and die.
That was the plain English of the arrangement—
of the latest-invented detail of Colonel George
Arthur’s newly-established Penal Settlement.
• * •
At the mines the denizens of “ Murderers’!’
Were known as “The Twins.” Each “twin”
wore a pair of trousers, a basil, or iron waist-
band, and his double ankle-shackles. Once a
month, for two hours, he wore also a shirt, boots
and a cap. It was on Inspection Sunday, when
Dr. Rossell came down to the Mines to “report
on the well-being of the transports and other con-
victs,” that this additional clothing was issued.
One other daily prerogative was to every man the
half of the nine-foot chain before mentioned.
Their heavy andairy costume offeteMHttle or no'
impediment to the workers turning out daily
(Sundays excepted) their allotted tasks. The
hewing of 15 hundredweight, such “hundred”
consisting of 1201bs. —not more than three out of
the fifteen were to be composed of slack and small
coal—made up, with the haulage to the shaft, the
cutting of galleries and the picking out of pillars,
the daily quota of each man. Not very difficult
work, if it had not been for the circumstances
that only for two hours per month did the ganger
draw a breath of air which was uncontaminated
with coal-dust, and that the daily ration-scale
permitted him only l(>oz. uncooked maize-meal,
12oz. of meat, with bone, loz. of salt, |oz. of soap,
and unlimited prater. But these circumstances
were not. calculated to strengthen the physical
stamina, and even with the aid of the allowance
of candles (four per man tier week, which were as
often as not treated as adjuncts to the larder) the
task sometimes proved beyond their strength to
perform.
With the reminiscence of the Harbour banquets
constantly before them, the Three -with the
Stained Records grew hungry and went weaker to
their work, and failed to perform it, and, to save
themselves from being flogged on Inspection,
Sundays, confiscated pretty frequently the fruits
of their chain-mates’ toil.
Phillips was lugging his basket one evening to
the end of the gallery to have it hoisted to the
pit-mouth, when Jones, necessarily going with him
because of their mutual chain, insinuated that he
would be obliged by Phillips handing him lialf-a-
-’ basketful. ....
“ Only ’arf, Ben ! I*ll giv’ it yer back sum’
time.” ■• ■■■■
“Nd!” said Phillips, resolutely. “You .owe
me two baskets now. And being short last
inspection got me a dozen.”
“Yer won’t, won’t yer! Yer*wott’t give me
.’arf?”
; “No!” •
“Then I’ll take all 1”
And, being a man of his word, he-did. In Hie
Overman Page’s tally-book that night Jones was
credited with two baskets;' Phillips witfi,two-
thirds of one—and that “small.’*;- *
“Look ’ere, No. 4”—Phillips was “4”—
shouted the.overman. “ Short agen ! Lor’, yer’ll
’av ei? devil of er lot ter make up by Stmday week.
An’ if yer don’t it’ll be two dozen riext time,
mark my words! Com’dant won’t stand no
nonsense !”
The process of confiscation went on pretty fre-
quently—and almost regularly, arid regularity
also was conspicuous in the matter of the floggings
received by Phillips, Bunt, and West. The Lieu-
tenant and the Overman wondered how it was
that the three desperate Harbour men
to produce thhif tally of tootle, while the others of
better reputation were nearly always “short.”
For,' of course, the’story of the confiscations could
not be told. The Three would have made dread-
fully short work of the man who informed against
their tyranny. ‘
' It was the victims of the confiscation policy who
-first pronounced for a “ bolt.” They had got tired
of the. treatment to which they were subjected by
their •chain-mates arid, the authorities, combined ;
and, as the period of their confinement lengthened,-
their bodily weakness would _increase, though the
hiboftr'and the pu ishirients would grow heavier.
If they could only escape !
-* * #
One day, Phillips was “outsider ” oil his
chain. That is to say 7, he was working nearest the
shaft iu a gallery.... His ehain-mitte, Jones, had
slumbering the lengtlGof the chain away.
In the movement of his arms as, lying on his side,
he wielded the short pick, Phillips could not
avoid jerking the links, and cofisequently Mr.
Jones’ repose had been disturbed, lie had remon-
strated with a lump of coal and an oath, and it
was under the influence of the pain excited by
the former striking him oil the face that Phillips,
in a hoarse .ivhisftet - , said: “God! that I could
bolt from this slavery !”
West was outsider in the adjacent gallery, his
mate, Hardy 7, like Jones, also preferring’to be
lazily 7 recumbent. West caught the whisper arid
echoed it: “I would to God I could !”
When lodging their—and their mates’—baskets
in the shaft chamber that night, Burt was spoken
to by Phillips. “ Would he make one to bolt!”
“Would I bolt from bell! Try me !”
# # #
Their unofficial masters, the Three with
the Records, discovered, it is impossible to say
how, the intention of their three slaves. Perhaps
the galleries carried the sound of the whispers;
perhaps in the disturbed sleep of one or other the
design was revealed. And learning it, the Three
adopted the notion. For a couple of days they
kept their subservient chain-mates on the inside,
while they themselves meeting at a point to which
their respective galleries converged, discussed the
possibilities.
M“ Them ’uns are for a-boltin’, are they?” said
Jones to Tooth, who was the discoverer of the
escaping scheme. “Now, we’ve got to go with
them or we’ve to die !” ,
“ That’s it sure!” responded Jones. “They
ain’t no chance of gettin’ away unless they kill
us, or we go with ’em. An’ we’ve been a-usin’
’em so that it’s not in reason they’ll want to take
us with ’em.”
Hardy took up the parable. “O’ cos not!
’ow cud they? But our lay’ll be to find out all
their plans, an’ then to blow ’em*, if they ain’t
good ’nuff to foller !”
; The three mouths which had known the
slavering were very close to one another,, and the
three heads to which they belonged touched. The
three bodies were crouching closely, so that no
syllables of the muttered infamies should pene-
trate to the men at the lower end of the chains.
“Hist!” said Jones. “An’ if they’re good
.’nuff, wot then? We ain’t a-goin’ to take them
along !”
“Yer a fool if yer don’t, then!” was
Hardy’s answer. “Wojb yer goin’ to live on till
yer reach the settled disrick? ”
The dreadful emphasis of his last phrase
invoked the reminiscent delight of his brother
gourmands. And in the next few moments' of
fieridish converse they developed their plans.
Which, after all, did not include the taking of the
Three Without with them. -
• # *
“Wot d’yer say to bolt, boys?” Jones took
upon himself to say the same night as they all drew
up to the bottom of the shaft to bemusterid.
The Lieutenant-in-Command was exact. He
iriustered nightly. He would stand by the pit-
mouth, and looking-downwards could tell, in the
light of the candles held by each prisoner, their
several heads. “Wot d’yer say ! ”
Phillips, Bunt and West sent at each other
accusatory glances. Who had told their oppressors?
Or had it been simply a coincidence that the other
three had framed a similar plan ? Usually sus-
picious, and Jiot knowing how much the others
knew, or guessed, each of the non-murderous
fellows mumbled that “ he would make one to go.”-
“ Then arter muster we’ll talk ! ” 'And when
the officer's “Good-night,” had hailed them all
derisively, and the overseer had clanged down
the grating which shut them all into their living
>“ Blow ’em -’—Disclose them to the authorities.
tomb, and they had put out their candles to save
a portion of the dip - ten to the pound—for eating,
the Three with the Records took the Three With-
out-into that part of- their confidence which they
thought fit to share. It wasn’t much ; nor was.it
even the material part.
“We’re goin’ to bolt, boys, an’.if as yer
yer can jine us. it’s death 'to everypheas*
blows!” ..... *
The Three who. were- under-graduates'muttered
assent to the spokesman of the Three graduates..
“ An’ if yer jine us, we’ll do our full tally till we
make the bolt. Yer won’t Ha’ to do any o’ our ■
work! ”
The under-graduates’ assent wad not needed to
this. Had it been expected, they were too sur-
prised to express it.
“ We’vts been a bit ’ard, but yer’d ha’
been just th’ same if yer’d jiad th’ upper’and.
An’ if yer agrees to go, we’ll let bygones .be'
bygones, an’ share an’ share alike.” The-'inag-"
napimity of the scoundrels ! ; i
Jones went on,: “ An’ our■ nosfyun is,to save ;
each o’ us an'arf rashun. a-dfiy for a fortnight.
It’ll "be ’ard jpnnicks to-do our tally on short
’lowunce, but it’s our only chanoc. ■ Then we’ve
som,’at to start on. AVe’ll ’aV a candle of two
3 s Well a-piece, an’ wi’ th’ lot toe orter manage ten
days or a fortnight outside.” ,
He paused. The graduates listened eagerly for
sound of dissent. None came’. Had the juniors
fallen into the trap? Would they cjo full work On
half rations so as to accumulate a store of food ? .
Bunt said, “Go on ! ” * . /
“Once out, we’ll Bay.<- I’ve
’erd on a cave wot’s Hiere ‘ w’t-re there’s .a bed o’
slieli-tish.' An’ we can lay byffor a time. But th’ :
trouble is—to get out 1 ” ?•. - - - .
That was the trendafS* The probh m made-cadi
of them breatliehardly.. The freeing themselves
from irons was/comparatively easy, the scaling
of the sixty feet of shaft, andtthon— the grating !
The silence was unbfo)|en jbr a' full minute,
save for their laboured inspirations.* Then Bunt
spoke,’hesitatingly. HCdid'flbt know hoyy much
the Three seniors had learnti from Phillips and
West, and he thought that if they were aware of
what he had in his pos'session", it would still be t'o
bis advantage with them.tb "deal frankly, and to
appear as though-lie fully'trusted them. -If they
did not-know, : surely they would appreciate highly
the generosity of his announcement. . ..
( “Well--ye must Know, Mr. Jones, as I’ve a—a
—watch-nick. . .
c; Tlie Tliyeb With or tried to leap, to their
Tebt. - A WnJtchAiick k Thp gods were goocl!
“ Ye’-re'a f” shouted" Jones, while
Tooth and Sturdy made use of.similar -highly
complimentary remark*. “ W’ere did .y.er get it ?
An’ let’s see'lfc! Strike a.light, Hardy.” . ...
The flint and steel permitted them by the
graciousness of LieHtepant Cooke emitted a faint
spark, and, in a mchnent, 1 a dip’s flame lessened
the shadows in the..anxious faces. Bunt held in
his hand a delicate’watblespring saw. The Three
With shouted again and again, for Bunt grasped
between his fingers—Freedom, if not for himself,
for them. - ! if. ■ "'** rr '‘,
“ Yh’re a clever’un, Bunt!” said Tooth, think-
ing that perhaps, 4 after' all, 'they had better
exempt Bunt from |he principal feature of their
plan—a man' ingenious yt& to keep a, watch 1
nick from the knowledge'of tlie authorities’, not*
withstanding repeated 'searcfiipgg, ..g°°d
enough to make - one .of the party. / eyef did
yer manage it ?” . '
• - Bunt was silent. He was affrighted, for he had"
sepn, by the caiidle-gleam, in Phillips’ eyes and
those of West emphatic condemnation of his, folly;
in revealing his possession of the precious thing to
the murderers. . '
“ I’ve—had it a long time,’’-lie .at last stam-
mered when Jones repeated Tooth’s question. . j;
“ An’ never told us ! That war n’t fair, Bunty.
Yer sh’u’d ha’ been friendly, Bunty—an’yer’d ha’,
saved yerself a lot. Enyone who’s got a watch-
nick’s got to be treated kind. An’ I tell yer wot,,
we’ll do, boys. Jest ’cos Bunt’s puttin’ us ’tinder
the favour o’ lettih’ us a-use his nick, we’ll help
’un all we can with his tally. That’s fair, ain’t it, :
boys !”
The five agreed. And then at Jon.es!.sugges-
or rather command, for none disputed his
assumption of the leadership, they took the Con-
vict Oath. They chanted the eight verses, which
began: '
t ’ • Hand to hand,
On Earth; in Hell,
-SickorWeH,
On Sea, on Land,
: On the Square, ever.
And ended—the intervening verses dare not be
quoted— ;
Stiff or in Breath,
Lag or Free, , . iit
.You and Me, ■ i
In Life, in Death,
. On the Cross, never.
They chanted them with crossed and re-crossed
hands, and the foot of each pressed to the foot of
another. And after the verses, the “ loving-cup ”
of blood. Not a very,copious draught—to provide
a hearty drink would have weakened" them, and
their leader was too much of the general to
occasion an unnecessary demand on their strength
—only a drop or two from each man’s open vein,
sucked by every other man. So was fealty to
their leader, honour to one another, plighted.
The Convict Oath was a terrible thing;,it was
never broken, without occasioning death to some-
one-not necessarily to the violator. John Price
died in 1857 because of a Convict Oath registered
at Norfolk Island in the Forties. •
•'* ' •
It was a terrible thing, that Oath. So the
undergraduates, at least, thought it, arid though
they had distrust and , hate of the graduates in
their hearts they were prepared to loyally, carry
out the compact. They.found it the easier to do
so because the murderers before him who had
gone through the horrid drill of “ starving for a
bolt ” helped them" in every way. \ >
The Three With not only did; not exact i from
. the Three Without any contribution of coal,' but
actually helped them. Jones filled two-thirds bf
Phillips’ basket one day in addition to his own ;
arid’Tooth ran the risk of a flogging on Inspection
Sunday because he kept Burit’s creel supplied!,
When half-way on the starving time, Bunt
: “ ja.cked-up ” on'half-rations 'and ' fell ill for a
couple of days. -V No, Bunty, my man, you
mustn’t take more meal—it’ll do you harm now.
. V . . s t , \ • V-V \ V
Stick to the half, and ye’ll be used to it in anothoi
day or two. Meantime, I’ll do your tally.”
Then the Three With put up the others t 6 all the
dodges as to economising food that they had .
learnt in the dread school of the Harbour. The
graduates completed the knowledge of the under-
graduates by showing how the proper sucking of a
bone was as good as meat, and how, if an ounce
of meat were chewed to a ball, then withdrawn -
from the mouth, and hardened bv, exposure to tire
a;r .it Would appease hunger as effectually as r
the mastication of the whole ration. They taught .
the neophytes how to extract the nutriment from
so'ap, .and the 1 best way of utilising, the candles.
“The. wick’s a meal in itself, Bunty—eat the
grease separately,” tenderly advised Tooth. -
But the main sustenance ,of the six 'during the
starving time was derived from the, subtle elixir
of hope. -
• # * *
The hour for the attempt was fixed for the
Saturday night midway between two Inspection
Sundays. , .
The Three With wanted it earlier —as early as
possible aftertlie next Inspection day. But the
Three Without, remembering Macquarie Harbour,
said to themselves that they would not then have
food enough. So it was fixed for the second
Saturday.
The grating was thrown open at five o’clock on
week-day mornings, but on Sundays an hour and ■
a half later.' That hour and a half would mean a "
longer start— and a good start was everything in a
“bolt.”
The first Inspection Sunday after the decision
was come to was passed safely. No one “split ”
or. “peached;” all tallies were -right except
Tooth’s. ’ On his score for a month he was five-
hundredweight short. Buthe took his “dozen”
as'mildly as the mother'takes the tiny blows of
her, infant’s pulpy fingers. And, when all was
said and done, what was twenty-five to Tooth,
who left Hell’s Gates with two thousand charged
against him on the books and impres.ed on his
back ?
That Sunday night they began the actual busi-
ness—the starving was merely a preliminary—of
escape. They fractured their irons—anklets,
waist-chains and-basils. Only the last were sawn
through hhtlT the 1 watch-nick. When the last
girdle was parted'they examined the saw eagerly.
-It was sjarcelyiSMiited ! ‘ I.‘. '
“To think of a-gettin’ off the. thing so :
ne’at !” cried Jones, affected to tears of gratitude.
“-Lor," ’tis much nicer than the ; col’ chisel!”
In tlje rare cases—one, say, in a hundred—that
a girdle’or basil once on was taken off, the cold
chisel was the cutting instrument. And cold
chisels had a nasty habit of slipping and gashing
the abdomen,' • • ;
# * *
With' tlfe release of their bodies from the
iron bands it became possible to achieve the next
step towards-consumniating the “bolt.”
The walls of the- shaft "were, - as has been indi
cated, timber-lined. -The planks were laid hori-
zontally, and the natural tendency of the Regime
to economy would t haye prompted the authorities
toleave .apertures between each plank, thus
making two do the work of three, had it not been
fob the consideration that a foot-hold would be
.gi.ven'td any convict venturing upon the escalade.
accordingly laid flush, without —
'so eohcluVied sifter/due examination—
affording a solitary Crevice _otr a' knot, which the
'ingenuity,of the prisoners could turn to'tile'least
account in mounting. 'Nevertheless, the six were
determined upon ascending. /;. *
The ’chamber' "at * the 1 bottom of the' pit, into
which the vein-galleries, and the.working and air-
drives opened, was ten feet deep.' That was the
first difficulty to surmount. 1 ...
Three irieh, bUn'Clied together, and "with.-,
round each other’s hecks and’bent heads,-stood
upright. ' ‘ . > h'
a On tKeir shoulders mounted two. And. upon
the shoulders of the two, the sixth riian—'Jones-
crept up, and wres’ted from its perpendiculars two
or three feet/above the'swaying'pillar'of bCStial
humanity, r a plank. 1 ' The'gAp woul'dleave' a foot-
hold; ■ - “ ■ "j.:, / .•
Then he climbed to.the.ghp, arid'.wibhlabonr that
shook his.frame to a .palsy; 7 pulled-from' its place
a secohd-’plahk."' That'was the'work'of 'the first
night’. .‘r ; h'-V. • ’V V
T he' next night three more T planks, were, hauled
down.’ The ’same' building!'up,'of the tottering,
sweating, pedestal of flesh—the same wrestling
with nails and cleats—the same great gaspirigs of
pain and relief as the planks : were pressed upon,
bent and gave way.
The third night, and the fourth night, and the
fifth night planks were loosened, taken out, and
then replaced loosely. Jones was getting near the
pit-mouth now, and was well within the rim of
light from the surface. He dare not leave the
gaps, for fear they might be observed from above.
The Men of the Regime were wont to discourage
ingenuity.
From the topmost of the loosened planks, it
would be easy to reach the walls at right angles
with the side on which the gaps had beep made.
Then, the last plank so extracted "would be used
to bridge the angle, and to form a standing-3tuge
for' the man who attacked the grating with the
watch-nick. And Jones was resolved that that
man should be himself. The man who filed away
the grating-bars would be first out of the shaft.
All this time the saved rations and candles were
accumulating. Heavens ! the daily horrors of
endurance and the frightful pangs suffered by
these men! The conquest over the griping hunger,
which might be gratified in a moment if they
would—the forcing of the energies to the Titanic
task of turning-out the allotted quantity per day
with semi-paralysed limbs and flaccid nerves—
the patience, the fortitude, the suffering—wduld
have been heroic in a' better cause—nay, were
heroic in'this very instance. “’ Was not this cause
' the sacred one of Freedom?
i • ■#■■ “ o. *
j “ God ! r I couldn’t stand it, if it weren’t
for* freedom !” cried’Phillips to Jones on the
seventh^night. • i

“Yes, ’tis for freedom! “ Jones and'
he coughed loudly, and rang his short pick againsb
the seam. ■* 1
*'* I wish I’d that basil on again, I do,” said
1 hillips. ‘‘l’d not get hungry so soon. I’ll tie
something on my stomach—tight.”
An answering ring had Come from Tooth’s
gallery—-and from Hard y’s.
“ Don’t trouble, Phillips,” cried Jones, raising
his voice to a shoiit. “Freedom’s come— orl-ready.”
Lt was the signal.
Ehe pick crashed into the base of Phillips’skull,
ihe blow was neatly aimed —so well, that Phillips
did not groan - oncfe, nor stirred whence he lay.
Hardy and Tooth were less adept. It took a
second blow from each to finish their respective
victims. " u
Then the Three who had added another stain to
their records, met in the chamber.
“That’s th’ next pcirt o’ our plan well got
through,” said Jones. “ We’re gettin’ on. We’ve
lib rated one Three; we’re goin’ to lib’rate
’nother.”
* # #
r i That was on the seventh night—a Saturday.
The next stage towards freedom was the drawing
of the dead- men’s rations.
Every morning rations were issued for the men
mustered overnight. The collective portion for
“ Murderers’ ” was sent down in the first baskets
in the morning.
The remaining Three had their own half rations
for the starvation, time on hand. Also, the like
quanity which had been accumulated by the self-
denial of the dead men. Still,- they had not
enough. They wanted more ! None of them
cared for setting out in company with his brother
gourmands with only a poor larder.
*- * #
On each of the eighth to the fifteenth nights
inclusive, the dead men were mustered. And on
each successive morning there came down in the
first basket the dead men’s rations.
Night after night would each of the still im-
prisoned Three place one of his liberated mates—
the one bp bad himself freed—against the back-
wall of the chamber and fix a candle in his haul.
And night after night would Lieutenant Cocke
look down—Audibly count, by the dips’flame, six
heads and six hands holding candles—and, having
“ mustered ” them, wish them all “ good niglP ! ’’
Night after night, till the fifteenth, were
the six mustered, and none of them made com-
plaint, and all drew their rations regularly the
next day. The dead as well as the quick drew
their rations. And the nostrils of the living..werq
filled with the odour of the dead, and they, too,
would have died, but that they were stayed by
the hope of liberty.
And on the fifteenth night, the other Three also
won Freedom, in a way to be told.
PRICR WARUNG.
The Socialists’ Position.
Dear Bulletin, Henry George, in “ Progress and
Poverty, shovys that refit limits wages, l and thence
assumes that, if land . were made common property, or
what is the same thing, if rent were confiscated by the
State, wages would increase to the fullearningsof labiur.
It is indeed true that so long as land is m mopolised
common wages will-never much exceed what a man car!
produce for himself from the poorest land in use, that is
to say, from the ,best land that can be had for the using,
and Will always tend to the minimum upon which
labourers can maintain their numbers; but it does not
follow that if land were nationalised wages would per-
manently rise, unless it were also shown that nothing else
existed to limit wages.
Where'George falls into error is in taking too limited a
view . of monopoly. Land ownership, railway; telegraph,
gas, and water companies, are not the onlv kinds of
monopoly. Every considerable aggregation of capital i 3
a monopoly, insomuch as it prevents men with little or no
capital from 6ng J aging in competitive industry. To Henry
George’s three economic laws a fourth must be added—the
law of capitalistic expropriation, which, like the law of
rent, but in opposition to the law of interest, “depends
on the margin of production, rising as it falls and falling
as it rises.” Destroy the monopoly of land, and wages
would not permanently rise, for the monopoly of capital
would take its -place, and would" fill' the bill in every
particular.
This can be shown from George’s own words, for,
although an. opponent of Socialism, which he does not
seem to correctly apprehend, there are many passages in
his books which show how the capitalist can oppress the
labourer—in fact, it is almost impossible to carefully and
thoughtfully read “Progress and Poverty” without
becoming convinced of the necessity of Socialism. In
Book 11., chap, iv., occurs a statement bearing on this
subject : “Twenty men working together will, where
Nature is niggardly, produce more than twenty times the
wealth that one man can produce where Nature is most
bountiful.” This assertion is undoubtedly true, for in
addition to the increased power derived from co-opera-
tion, twenty men can use machinery which one man could
not use.
The accepted law of rent is: “ That the rent (or value)
of land is determined by the excess of its produce over
that which the same application of labour and capital can
secure from the least productive land in use.” To this
should be added-the law of monopoly That the profits
of capital are determined by the “excess of wealth pro-
duced per head "by an indefinite number of men working
in concert, and with the aid of machinery, over that
which one man can produce working by himself, or if
you please, with the aid of his family.”
At present prices, a man without capital can make
but a bare living from the land, even in Australia,
where land is cheap, and an inspection of the foregoing
laws will render it obvious that if rent were abolished
wages could never rise much above a bare living, and
would again fall to the minimum as competition lowered
prices.
Suppose rent confiscated, and speculative rent elimi-
nated, economic rent would at once be largely reduced by
the-great extent of land now held for speculative purposes
being thrown open. A considerable portion of the capital
now engaged in commerce and manufactures would be
diverted by the fall in land-values to agricultural pur-
suits. This would tend to increase the prices of manu-
factured and imported articles, and to lower the prices of
agricultural produce.
If it is so difficult for the poor farmer to make a living
now, this alteration in relative prices would render it inc
possible, and the impossibility of making a living from
the-land without capital, would have the same effect upon
wages as the complete monopolisation* of the land—it
would reduce them to the minimum.
The nature of capital is that nothing can compete with
it in industry except capital; the great capitalist can
undersell anddrive out of the market the'small capitalist,
and the man who has not cauital has no resource but to-
take employment with the mail who has. -The.landowner
monopolises natural opportunities, but the capitalist
monopolises the tools and instruments of labour, without
which no man can apply his labour profitably, let natural
opportunities be ever so free.
Henry George's remedy, taken by itself, would be an
utter failure; when we nationalise land, we must at the
same time nationalise capital and-industry, without going
through the useless preliminary of the “Single-tax.” "

A man named Pinter has been trying to
induce a London jeweller to lend him 1 ’40)000 sove-
reigns, which, under a certain line,of treatment in
a tank, would ultimately yield £100,000 worth of
gold. The jeweller (Streeter, of Bond-street) ,
witnessed one or two of Pinter’s "experiments,”
and found that a sovereign, placed in a cr.ucible •
with a little black powder and other ingredients,
was melted into a nugget worth nearly £3. Then '
he put the- police on to Pinter, and the'alchemist, i
at latest dates, was before the Court for trying to.

‘while-the’ Gbmpafny was struggling to make a
name for itself, that‘it‘has reached its present
satisfactory portion, '-'fin?works are situated in
‘Harly-street, Newcastle. It is impossible, in the
space at-’dispbsal, to give/even ah outline of the
many processes through win the leaf has to pass,
befopb it emerges fit for use On the .upper floois
are the stripping and mixing departments, where
fi. bevy of Phyllises,' with, deft fihgbrs, remove tin-
stein from the leaf, and where it undergoes a
MR. H. STODDARD
process of coagulation, as it were. Then, below
stairs, are the various machines and apartments
for drying, pressing, cutting, twisting, folding,
packing, branding, etc., all of which necessitate
the employment of numerous hands. Among the
favourite brands may be mentioned, “ Good
Company,” most popular of high-class weeds, and
the solace of many a weary miner or solitary stock-
man; “Paragon,” the poorman’s friend—but there
are other brands, all of which have their admirers.
The customers of the Company are daily on the.
increase, and on the books are to be found the
names of numerous Sydney vendors. Operations
are not, however, confined solely to the manufac-
ture of locally-grown and imported-tobacco-leaf.
A very large business-is done—in-the-way—of
imputing , cigars -and .cigarette- tobaecoesrof- the-
Company’s‘own particular brands, and amongst,
the former may be specially mentioned the
“Cronoas,” “Fairies,” and “Matadors,” cigars,
which are manufactured specially to the Com-’
pany’s order. Then there are the celebrated
“ M.l>.” pipes, made for the Company, by one of;
the. veryA)4st houses in Vienna,- like other re-,
quisites for the borhfort of smokers. Two
which may be said to have considerably influenced*
the successful-operations-of- the Company have
been • without-doubt->the erection; of the very
ne.west machinery, and the employment of only
skilled labour. The chief-hands have been selected
on account of special ability, in -certain direc->
tions, and - , the managing foreman is an expert,
under whose ‘ charge' everything is done'in a‘
thoroughly systematic . manner.. The smart
business-manager,' Mr. Stoddart, is a great politi-
cian, "and is'at-the' present time ’so’ much
occupied'electioneering that he can scarcely afford!
the time to show visitors over the works. In his
department, however, he is the proper plug for the
round hole, and without a doubt much of the
concern’s success is; due to his skilful engineering,
remarkable energy and business push. The Com-
pany is one which deserves well .of the) tobacco-
smoking public, not only in the immediate
vicinity of Newcastle, but throughout the colony,
for its efforts to produce a ass article at the
lowest possible price, and* we venture to predict
that when Protection makes it profitable to enter
into competition with some of the lighter Ameri-
can brands, the Richmond Tobacfco Co. will step
right to the front.
The last surprise-party held in Melbourne
was a bad failure." ATot of lfind'friends called in
after the usual fashion at a mansion in a northern
suburb and deposited tjie ham on the keys of the
.pianoforte ; 'ancLdJjeir • bright smile haunts the
’proprietor* still? He came downstairs-gnashing
his teeth and foaming at the mouth,'and told the
.visitors that- he wished they had gout in both
feet—he meant to* say, his happiness was now com-
plete, and that he was pleased to self them all in*
—-that wits—ahem—he was pleased to see them all
well. Then he shook hands with them all round,
and said that he hoped they would all get into
gaol for life —here lie cleared lps throat hurriedly
—lie meant that lie would call down his wife.
Then the rest of the family -came down, and
greeted the visitors as effusively as if they were a
long-lost serpent or a bailiff; and they all looked
glad—as .glad as if their parents had been run
over by an omnibus. And the guests cleared
away the* furniture of the drawing-room, and
dropped greasy provisions all over the place, and
> roke some/bricja-braC'in the wildness of their
revelry, and danc d on the wild fantastic ex-
tremity till they shook a big oil-painting off the
wall and it went to impalpable smash on the floor,
when the host and hostess smiled like two hanged
murderers and said sweetly that it didn’t matter.
And the excitement grew wilder and wilder, and
the revels more frantic, and the noise more awful,
and in between the bursts of joy the hostess could
be heard breaking dishes in the back kitchen, and
calling on the Lord to strangle the whole
assemblage, and one bank-clerk winked eight
times at the eldest daughter till her father longed
to leap upon his gore. Finally they went away in
the small hours of the morning leaving chaos and
broken victuals everywhere behind them; and
then it was ascertained that all the jewellery had
been sneaked out of the bedrooms, and the head
of the house wanted to chase the departing
revellers with his gun, only the rest of the family
hung fainting on to his coat-tails and prevented
him. But next day he put the detectives on the
track of that surprise-party, and if he has his way
some of them will be badly surprised in Pentridge
at an early date.
Give the London and Sydney Tea Co. one trial.
They guarantee satisfaction.
We have just received from Sanderson
and Son, of Oxford-street, London, two hand-
somely-bound volumes, containing the most
artistic designs oft' paper and 'cretonne, the
daintiest and most gorgeous effects in colour that
havo“come under our, notice' for wall-coverings.
These samples, from Messrs. Sanderson’s manu-
factory at Chiswick, have proved a revelation to
us. Tfie decorative art has evidently recently
made great developments.
The drawing of the prizes given away by
Allt and Co. on behalf of the Robertson’s Whisky
proprietary took place at the Sydney New
Masonic Hall the other afternoon in the presence
of a number of leading business-men and hotel-
keepers, when £2OO was distributed among the
customers. Mr. Chisholm had the drawing in
hand, and Mr. Shaw, of Allt’s, acted as master
of ceremonies, while Landlord Hunt acted as
toastmaster at the conclusion of the drawing,
whose result appears in our advert sing columns.
While Colston, tljc Narbethong murderer,
was hiding in teetotal Premier Munro’s country-
house, he had only one square drink, and that
was when he swallowed the great cold-water
apostle's hair-wash. The wash consisted mostly
of rum, and the escaped maniac had a festivy
blow-out upon it before he hid himself up in the
attic. Considering that Munro has hardly a
solitary hair to-balance a hair-restorer upon the
circumstances look suspicious.
A lady ten feet round the waistns on view
just now in New York.. N.bW'jast suppose a man
won that lady’s affections and wanted to take her
in his arms, would it be advisable to squeeze lier
by putting a rope round her and hauling on the
two ends of it, or should he do it by walking
rapidly round her, and leaning up against her as
he went, or would it be better to shove her into a
corner and squeeze her against the wall? And
supposing a fellow proposed to her, and she.threw
herself into his arms, ought he to jump aside and
let her flop over on the floor, or should he rush at
her when she first begins to go off the perpendicu-
lar, and try to heave her back into an upright
position ? The Bulletin wants to know.

The Bulletin ip { an aggressive Dmhqeratio
paper, which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally.-Qondensed columns,‘all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
Started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
aryl lias become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a-vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavaijingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin's conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can atonce be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators,.inany
of which even took, so far as was ptsssiblp, its
name. They are now all dead, while wHe Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the-one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the" fact that for years it stood alone among
secular iiewspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
I The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
.that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed. r
i The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres'
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based ■
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s’
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact —
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,l
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from'
■one reader to another. -
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
■other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
■artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugelmakn, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest,
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorat.i ng every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
mad of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about, two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased ooming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
, P. KEENAN.
