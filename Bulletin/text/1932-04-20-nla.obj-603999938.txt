HIS
BOOKS
Truth in Fiction
“M.G.S.” wrote recently on' this page
that the art of literature was not concerned
with actuality. Actuality was “all-import-
ant’’ to most writers, but that only meant,
he said, that the writers were “worthless.”
Others contended that the master-novelists
—Balzac, Thackeray, Proust, Meredith—
took immense pains to be accurate in de-
tails; that sloppiness ruined illusion, and
was one of the hallmarks of inferior work.
The three novels discussed below are all
good as stories. They are well, though by
no means equally well, written. All the
authors should know the places they write
about; they have lived in them for years.
How do their books respond to the other
test—that of actuality? And how is illu-
sion—the thing every artist in words strives
~ after—affected?
How Colliers Live
Miner, by Frederick Boden (Dent; 6s),
is the first novel of this distinguished
worker-poet. It is about Chesterfield in
Derbyshire, where he was born and worked
as a miner till three years ago. At 14
Danny Handheld, whose father earns 425.
a week, has made the necessary number
of attendances at the county council school,
and 'is ready for work in the local pits.
He starts at 15s. a week.
You follow him. into the mine and home
again, see where he works, listen to the
talk of his friends. After a while he is
given a pony to drive. The pony, like
everything else, is described in compassion-
ate detail:—
In its leather headguard, straps and chains, the
little brown thing looked like a prisoner condemned
to serve out its life in that dark sunless underworld.
A beautiful, little brown pony taken willy-nilly from
the sun and the flowers and the grass, the rain, the
rivers and the trees, and made to drag coal-waggons
along dark, dusty tunnels for 16 out of every 24
hours that came. For 16 out of every 24 hours the
bright-eyed little thing would scramble and strain
in the darkness till it was maimed or died or went
blind. Even blindness was not sure proof of release
into the beautiful upper-world. Ponies who spend
their lives in coalmines have no need of their
bright, gentle eyes.
As a pony-driver Danny’s wages rise to
21s. 6d., and the family is able to buy a
few luxuries, such as a piece of oilcloth
for the stone floor. His mother dies, his
father remarries, he falls in love. His few
passionate moments with Anne are
supremely well done. He can’t many her;
the miners have been beaten in a strike,
arid he is on reduced wages. We leave him
wondering desperately if a shift in the pit
and three on the dole are worth it, heartened
only by the knowledge that Anne will wait
for him. This is a work of art in every
sense, and chiefly because of its evident
truth. It is an edifice of pity and despair
built up by hundreds of small, intimate
touches. A false touch would have brought
it down in ruins in spite of the beauty of
the writing, but there is none. Artists like
Mr. Boden aren’t guilty of them.
An Englishwoman in Paris
Alice Campbell, whose “Juggernaut” was
highly praised, has written in The Click oj
the Gate (Collins; 7s. 6d.) one of the best
English novels with a French setting that
have appeared for many a year. She knows
as much about Paris and its environs as
Mrs. Belloc-Lowndes, and her style is more
distinguished. Her plot isn’t entirely cred-
ible, but her people are. Iris de Bertin-
court is an Englishwoman married to a
Frenchman who has deserted her. She has
fallen in love with Major Charnwood, R.E.,
and they are to be married when she gets
her divorce. He calls on her in Paris, and
is told that her child, Clare, will be back
from school at any moment. But Clare
doesn’t come back; she has been kidnapped.
Who did it, and -why? Was it for a ransom?
Or was it a trick of Tante Victoire’s to re-
unite the separated husband and wife? The
Comtesse de Castelmaurou is a Catholic of
the old regime. “People like Tante Vic-
toire,” Iris tells her lover, “don’t counten-
ance divorce, can’t admit that such a thing
exists. Once married you stay married for
ever and ever.” The rest of the story is
concerned chiefly with the search for Clare,
and the explanation of her disappearance.
The novel would be no more than an excep-
tionally well-carpentered mystery yam if it
were not for its shrewd characterisation, and
its wealth of information about French
people of every class and type, their habits,
prejudices, morals and manners. The writer
know y s Paris from Montmartre to the Fau-
bourg St.-Germain, and she makes you see
it as clearly as Arnold Bennett made you
see London. Above
all, she knows her
people, and how
they talk and think,
scheme and amuse
themselves. Her
rather wooden
English hero is practically the only char-
acter taken from stock. Marcel, the errant
husband, the intolerant Comtesse, the
sinister old Jewess whom Charnwood meets
in the Cafe des Deux Magots, and
many more are as real as they are unex-
pected. The writer gets the effects she
aims at because of her sure, easy familiarity
with her environment. It goes without
saying that she knows her job as a writer.
Fantasy
“M.G.S.” should approve of Threads oj
Yesterday, by R. G. Jennings (Noel Doug-
las; Robertson and Mullens; Bs. 6d.). It
is an interesting story, by one who has
the narrative faculty; and it is completely
divorced from actuality. The scene is an
unnamed Australian city which, presum-
ably, is Melbourne. Captain Oakley
Flames, D. 5.0., of the House of Flames,
lives with his man-servant, Jorrocks, who
was his batman and saved his life during
the war, in a lavishly-furnished flat. The
walls are covered with portraits of his
ancestors brought to Australia by his great-
grandfather, the best being a Romney.
Flames has lost his money in the slump,
and has resigned from the club as
a measure of economy. He misses the club,
and dreams wistfully of the cardroom (“the
sudden loosing of tongues as the last card
fell—the scraping of a match and more
smoke clouds—the familiar sound of a
siphon”); but he still keeps in touch with
rich, stout, golden-hearted old Jollidale.
Jollidale would like to pay Flames’s debts,
but knows the suggestion would end their
friendship. His favorite haunt is the bow
window of the club, though he complains
that it is “too expansive—too low—no
privacy even in one’s club.”
Here is Flames after a lonely dinner in
his flat:—
“It’s not like the old days, sir,” Jorrocks observed
at length....
“No, Jorrocks. Not like the old days. Pour me
out a glass of port.” Then Flames took the stem of
the delicately-cut glass, he held it up to the light.
The wine shone in its rich redness.
“To the old days, Jorrocks,” he said.
“Yes, sir. To the old days.”
Jorrocks stood rigidly to attention, as though
some solemn rite were being observed, as indeed
it was.
Flames no longer goes to Government
House parties, his dress clothes having sud-
denly turned green with age, but he some-
times visits his wealthy friend Miss Cynthia
Selwyn. Miss Selwyn (Demoiselle to
I lames) is a domestic disciplinarian. She
tells Mildred, her parlor-maid, that, the
house “must not be converted into an
asylum for amorous frivolity,” to which
Mildred replies weakly that her “young
man is quite respectable, a very nice-
meaning young man.” Yet, like old Jolli-
dale, Demoiselle has a kind heart. A poor,
tired boy calls. “If I may be so bold!
Madam,” says Mildred, “I do not think
he is an ordinary beggar.” The boy is
Peepa, son of Miss Sehvyn’s brother, dis-
carded by her for marrying an actress and
slain in the World War, and she adopts
him. How her friendship with Flames
developed, what Jorrocks was up to, and
how the Romney came into it must be
left to the reader’s imagination. The chief
defect of the story from the standpoint of
those who favor actuality is that it isn’t
Australian, but English. The bow-windowed
club belongs to St. James’s-street; no club
in tram-ridden Australia has a smoking-
room on the street level. Incidentally,
siphons aren’t used in clubs. Mildred is
a Mayfair parlor-maid—and there aren’t
many there these days who would stand
what she does. Indigent Australian bache-
lors don’t dress for dinner and drink port
every night. The characters haven’t an
Australian idiom, or a trace of the local
accent or attitude towards life between
them. No doubt, as “M.G.S.” wrote, there
are people for whom illusion is not de-
stroyed by. errors of fact. They will enjoy
Threads of Yesterday for its rich vein of
sentiment, and for the good feeling and
amiability that emanate from it.

The Outcast Art
After all these years, and after the spend-

literary and theatrical names, Australia’s
talkie-palaces remain houses of ill-fame,
culturally speaking; thousands only visit
them furtively. Others don’t go 'at all.

exclusively by morons. It isn’t so in the
United Kingdom which sees much the same
films as we do. The intelligentsia there are
frankly interested in the cinema, and they
always have been: it was in the Chelsea
Arts Club that I first heard highbrow
praise of Charlie Chaplin. But then most
of the advertising in Britain is less blatant
than here, and the critical standard of the
better papers is much higher. Some typical
advts. from a Sydney daily:—
SEE the pulse-pounding race for life between a
condemned native and hundreds of ravenous
Crocodiles which devour him!
SEE the loathsome 25ft. Python wrap a native in
its sinuous coils. What a death in the primeval
heart of the cannibal jungle!
FATHER AND SON fighting with bare fists for
the girl that one wanted and the other loved
—while she, alone on a boat at the mercy of a
maddened sea, forswore her marriage vows and prayed
that the hoy might be the victor.
How can sensible folk take an art-form
seriously that relies on such rubbish ?
Daily and Sunday papers complete the dis-
astrous job by whooping up every film,
good, bad, indifferent and rotten, as and
when it appears. The only exception in
Sydney is the “S. M. Heraid,” which now
and then slams a perfectly good picture
on moral grounds. It is doubtful if the
screaming advts. for which the picture
magnates pay so generously attract niuch
business. Certain pictures drag big crowds,
others which have been boosted just as
loudly are flops. The only advt. that does
any real good amongst habitual film fans
seems to be the recommendation of the
Jones family, which has seen a given pic-
ture, to the Smith family, which hasn’t
This makes it all the more regrettable that
large sections should be alienated which
contain the very people that the talkies
must secure if they are ever to lose their
Australian reputation of being amusement-
purveyors for mental defectives.
Great is the power of intellectual snob-
bery. In England, until eight or nine years
ago, the market for mystery novels was
slack. Then Mr. Baldwin said—or some
advertising genius said he had said—that
he never went on a long railway journey
without one. The news spread like wildfire;
the publishers saw to that. Tens of thou-
sands of potential thriller-addicts threw
off their inhibitions, and proclaimed that,
like the Prime Minister, they loved mystery
novels. At present most London publishers
are accepting three novels about crime for
every one about sex. And admirable jobs
many of them are, too.
The talkies here are in much the same
position as mystery fiction was in England
a decade ago. They are waiting to be
endorsed by leaders of thought. Above all.
they need to be advertised on dignified
lines, and it would help greatly if the
newspapers could be persuaded to make
movie critics of writers who are able and
willing to blame, as well as spill butter.
London “Punch’s” movies are donje by
“E.V.L.,” one of the best men on its staff,
and N. York “Judge” employs the brilliant
Pare Lorentz. London “Times” and “Morn-
ing Post,” the Manchester “Guardian” and
weeklies like the “New Age” and “Clarion”
have critics who take the talkies as seri-
ously as any form of art. The favorable
opinion of one of these writers on a star
or a production would carry more weight in
the only quarters that matter in Australia
than pages of appeals to sex and Sadism.
“E.V.L.” wrote of “Animal Crackers”:—
Funny as the Marx Brothers were in “The Cocoa-
nuts,” they are funnier still here, though in exactly
tlie same way. It may be the fun of the asylum,
but it is ordered, and gets its full effect.
Lorentz was just as enthusiastic about
“Laughter,” and the “New Age” has said
things about the art of Greta Garbo that
would startle thoughtful local suburbanites
who class her mentally with the imitators of
her haircut. These are the tributes that
Universal, M.-G.-M. and the rest ought
to display. They would give friends of the
movies the one talking-point that the indus-
try really needs in Australia.

The Australian Writer in England
If Alan D. Mickle (R.P. 6/4/’32) thought
that my satire on his previous article was
an attack on his -work he missed the point
of it. I have read only one of his books—
the appreciation of Eugene O’Neill’s plays.
I thought it a good piece of journalism.
My article was a criticism of Mr. Mickle’s
contention that English reviewers are pre-
judiced against Australian writers because
they are Australians. I don’t believe it.
I have had two books published in England,
and both English and Australian criticisms
ran on much the same lines. The publishers
did not conceal the fact that I am an Aus-
tralian. London strikes me as most cosmo-
politan in its tastes. It accepts negro sculp-
ture, German music and Australian versi-
fiers with equal eclecticism. Australian
critics are, if anything, over-indulgent to
Australian writers. Innumerable geniuses
have been discovered in the course of our
150 years of existence as a nation. Pos-
terity has confirmed none of these judg-
ments though there is nothing to justify
pessimism on that account. Spain has only
produced two men of transcendent merit
—Velasquez and Cervantes—in a much
longer period. I don’t think Mr. Mickle
can give the name of one really significant
writer who has not been recognised by at
least the most discriminating of his contem
poraries. If his work contains qualities of
permanence its reputation steadily grows
through the endorsement of writers com-
petent to judge them. After Shakspeare
died other playwrights were preferred to
him. but his reputation continued to grow
in spite of it. It is the same in other arts.
It was the verdict of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
a very great painter, which re-established
the reputation of Rembrandt. Sometimes
great creative artists are lucky in the matter
of contemporary criticism. Zola fought for
recognition of Manet, but if Manet had not
had the qualities of permanence in him
Zola’s propaganda would have been useless.
The fact that famous men have expressed
high opinions of Mr. Mickle’s work may
mean nothing. I think it was Dr. Johnson
who remarked that the reciprocal courte-
sies of writers is the most risible spectacle
in history.
It is a weakness for a writer to want a
snap verdict on his merits. A creative
artist can only demonstrate liis quality in
his own medium—creative writing. By
demanding recognition, like Mr. Mickle, he
only invites ridicule. By banging the drum
of nationalism he reveals only a trashy
sentimentalism. Sentimentalism of this sort
is a habit with the lesser sort of Australian
writers. Mr. Mickle does worse. In bang-
ing his own drum he reveals nothing but
self-pity. Self-pity is destructive of creative
effort. Whistler suffered from it, despite
the brilliance of the wit with which he
defended his art from the critics. He would
probably have been a better painter if he
had been less of a propagandist. Great
art requires no defenders.
Mr. Mickle doesn’t like critics, especi-
ally when they hide behind pseudonyms
like the cowardly “F.S.” But he likes favor-
able criticism. It is human nature for a
writer to believe that a favorable critic is
wise and an unfavorable critic merely spite-
ful. But Mr. Mickle oughtn’t to abuse
critics. He is a critic himself—of his own
works—and a very laudatory critic, He
says, “I know that I have done quite ex-
ceptional literary work that some day will
gain due recognition in this and other
countries.” If he really believes that it is
a wonder he was not able to view my
“cheapness and vindictiveness” with more
equanimity.

A Satchel of Books
Mad Sir Peter, by Frank Dfluot (Heine-
maiui; 7s. (id.), is a cloak and sword
romance which chiefly concerns the days
when Marlborough was fighting in Flanders.
The. story begins with the flight of James
and the arrival of William in 1688, and fol-
lows the fortunes of the Jacobite Fishen-
dens up to Rami Hies and Oudenarde. An
exciting story and a reliable guide to the
social history of the period as well.
Ileinemann has collected a number of
D. Iv. Broster’s best short stories at 7s. 6d.
under the title A Fire of Driftwood. Some
of the best and longest deal with the Nap-
oleonic wars, but the shorter and more up-
to-date ones are good too. “Clairvoyance” is
about an English country house which an
Australian woolgrower would have bought if
his wife hadn’t had a strange experience in
the library on the identical spot which saw
the beginning of the Strode Manor tragedy.
It’.s a great horror-yarn.
Sylvia Thompson’s Summer’s Night
(Ileinemann; 7s. 6d.) is an immensely long
love story—379 pages, to be explicit—in her
well-known vein of whimsy. The charac-
ters move in the best circles and the most
expensive places, and talk like this: —
Charles said: “A very lavish car has been ordained
for us.” (They are just arrived at the Riviera.)
Jasmin clung to his arm laughing and talking. A
blue Packard waited for them; Lord Whiehford’s
crest adorned its doors.
They got in. Michael said: “This is like a story
by Michael Arlen —driving through a Fashionable
Resort with an elegant girl beside me and so much
upholstery under one’s behind.”
Charles laughed. “I like the carnations in the
little holder being real —not ‘taxi’ ones.”
And so forth and so on, till, after certain
differences between Charles and Jasmin,
the happy ending is reached in their little
daughter’s nursery.
And a Little Verse
SIMPLICITY.
When shall I be
Wise as a tree
That gives its song to every passing wind,
And, shine or show’r,
Seeks not to urge or bind
The temper of the hour;
That spreads its green
Protecting screen
Alike to all, alone to none;
Nor saves nor rives,
Nor doubts the rain or sun :
But gives and gives
And.... lives!

MORNING LIGHT.
Every day tlie dawn comes up,
Pink-tipped and tremulous,
And the weary world, tired
With the passions of the night,
Becomes a child again,
Bright-eyed and innocent.
Its soft and shining light
Is like clear water
From a crystal spring—
Accentuating color —
Red roofs, green trees
And the blue of curling smoke.
The rich, dark shadows of the night,
The bright stars and the emotional moon
Are wine-like —passionate,
Exciting and disturbing—
All the beauty of the mind
Lying dormant in the flesh.
But when the dawn comes up,
Pink-tipped and tremulous,
And spreads its veil of shining innocence
Over the waiting world,
The mind arises from its lethargy
And takes possession of the world again.

THE PUZZLE OF EXCHANGE.
When the Great War began nearly all
countries were on the gold standard. This
meant, briefly, that their currencies were
based on gold—the sovereign contained a
certain fixed quantity, so did the U.S.
dollar, and so many francs would be ex-
changed for so much. If a man in London
bought goods at so many dollars or francs
or marks cr lire, he knew how many sov-
ereigns he would have to pay to settle the
bill. So with a man in New York or Pai*is
who bought goods in England or Italy or
Australia or Germany. He did not always
get precisely the par value of, say, francs,
for the pound; a small charge was made
for the bank’s services in arranging the deal.
Sometimes there was more money awaiting
transfer from London to, say, Australia
than was required to pay Australian bills in
London, and then a small concession was
made .to get it to Australia; in other words,
the Australian accepted less than £lOO in
Australia for his £lOO in London. But the
variations from par were very small;
between 1893 and 1929 the least which £lOO
English could buy of Australian money was
£97 10s. (in 1924), and the most £lO2 10s.
(in 1921). Generally it was about £lOl.
But gold has another job besides serving
as a medium for settling debts between
countries. It serves as a check upon the
undue expansion of paper currency and
credit. While a country is on the gold
standard its currency notes are convertible
into gold; and only so long as they are
convertible is it possible to say what cur-
rency notes are worth in relation to the
currency of any other country. If paper
money is not convertible into gold in its
own country, the only way of valuing it is
by finding out what exportable goods it
will buy in the country of issue. Take the
Australian pound, for example. It is no
longer convertible into gold. Therefore,
when a man in London sells goods in Aus-
tralia, he is no longer interested in the
Australian pound; this pound, not being
exchangeable for gold, has no fixed value.
He asks instead, “At what price can I buy,
say, wool there?” He knows what it is
worth in London. If a bale of wool is £l5
in Australia and only £l2 in London (after
allowing for shipping and other charges),
he knows that £l5 Australian are for some
reason or other worth only £l2 English.
In other words, it then takes £125 Australian
to pay a bill for £lOO in England.
But what has caused that variation from
par—how is it that £lOO Australian will no
longer pay a bill for £lOO in JLondon? For
over 30 years, as we have seen, the rate
was never higher than £lO2 10s. and never
lower than £97 10s. How was that unifor-
mity maintained? And what has happened
to send it up to the recent £l3O and to
hold it at the present £125?
Under normal conditions very little gold
passes from one country to another in
settlement of debts—except of course from
gold-producing countries; and gold in such
cases is merely merchandise. Under normal
conditions a country has to pay for its
imports with its exports. If its exports are
insufficient, then, under normal conditions,
it must export gold to make up the defi-
ciency; and no. country could go on doing
that for very long. But modern nations
discovered a way of evading that law. They
found that it was possible to borrow abroad;
and every such loan served the same pur-
pose as a shipment of gold. This plan was
especially easy for young countries, which
were able to plead that they wanted foreign
capital to develop their natural resources.
No country made greater use of that plea
than Australia. Besides what it borrowed
from its own people, it went into debt
abroad for something like 600 millions
sterling.
Now, what would have happened if we
had not thus gone into debt? Clearly, since
we had no gold worth mentioning to send
away in excess of what we actually did
send, we should have had either to reduce
our imports or to increase our exports.
Throughout that period of borrowing,
therefore, our pound was never really worth
£1 sterling, and was only kept at par by
artificial means. We were then, except for
the borrowing, in exactly the same position
as we have been during the past 15 months;
indeed, since during part of this latter
period we have made our trade balance,
we are in a better real position to-day than
we had been at any time for many years
past. If £125 Australian is to-day worth
only £lOO English, it is certain that for
many years prior to our crisis £125 Aus-
tralian was really worth less than £lOO
English. Our pound was not worth 205., in
the sense that it was not able to produce
what could be sold abroad for 20s. We
have only kept up what we have called a
standard of living at the expense of our
children and our children’s children; we
have loaded them with debt, and have
pocketed the proceeds in the shape of wages
and salaries w'hich we have not earned.
When we look to the future two courses
are offered us. One school says: “Our
export production has been for all practical
purposes subsidised for many years and it
cannot do without a subsidy now. In the
past the subsidy has been drawn from loans.
Loans being no longer obtainable, it must
be got through exchange. Our £ has not
really been worth 20s. for years past; any
attempt to make it worth 20s. now must
fail. Let’s therefore stabilise it at 15s. 4d.
or thereabouts and make £l3O Australian
exchangeable for £lOO English as a per-
manent thing.” The other school says there
is nothing to be gained by this; that the
more honest and straightforward thing is
to face the fact, which is that we have never
for many years earned our money, and
that the plan proposed merely gives us the
old money or thereabouts by depreciating
it. It does not make us a farthing better
off; it simply says, in effect, “We haven’t
been honest with ourselves for years past,
and it would only cause trouble if we tried
to be honest with ourselves now.”
The great misfortune is that our primary
producers have to sell in overseas markets,
where they cannot pass on our excessive
costs. One of two things they plainly must
have. Either they must get a subsidy of
some sort and in some form—such a sub-
sidy as they have had for years through
our loan policy—or costs must come down:
either the pound in Australia must pro-
duce what can be sold (net) for a pound in
London, or the difference must be made
up to them somehow. That can be admitted.
The whole question is which plan are we
going to adopt—that of honest, straight-
forward reduction of costs, or the other
method of pretending to maintain wages
and other costs by watering down the cur-
rency? It is quite possible that this other
method could be introduced with the less
disturbance; whether it would be a lasting
solution of the problem is quite another
matter. If it should be adopted pne thing
would have to be insisted upon—a complete
change of currency. To have pounds and
shillings worth less than English pounds
and shillings would be a constant reminder
to the world that we had once diluted our
currency.
THE ARCHITECT OF RUIN.
Mr. Bruxner, deputy-leader of the State
Country party, recently described the
Premier of N. S. Wales as “a bully and a
blatherskite, a bad growth that will pass
in the same way as other bad growths.”
These expressions were in the “Herald’s”
report; in the “Telegraph’s,” sandwiched
between “a bully” and “a blatherskite,”
were the words “a cur.” Never before, even
in N. S. Wales, was such language applied
by a responsible man, who can be sued, to
the head of a Government; but Mr. Lang
did not reply. A holy terror in Caucus,
being armed with the power of expulsion,
and an object of awe to poor-spirited, good-
as-Labor city politicians whom a rotten pre-
selection system has foisted on the country
as “Nationalists,” he never stands up to
bold countrymen like Bruxner and Mis-
singham, who have taken his measure. Yet,
if lizards have a language, even a lizard
might be expected to resent an accusation
of cowardice.
Equally curious in their way were the
reactions of Mr. Lang’s newspaper—the one
to which he has lent £13,700 at 2 per cent,
more than the rate of interest he thinks
“Shylocks” should receive when he is not
bilking them—to Mr. Bruxner’s strictures.
It chose to regard them as wholly an
attack on the U.A.P.; declared that “Mr.
Bruxner’s scathing criticism” had “caused
consternation in the ranks of the Alias
party,” which “seethed with indignation
against Mr. Bruxner,” and that “C.P. mem-
bers emphatically endorsed the remarks of
their deputy-leader.” Not a word about
the feelings of its mortgagee and director
of policy whom “Mr. Bruxner” called “a
bully, a cur and a blatherskite.”
It is no matter for surprise that Mr. Lang
should scuttle away from, and his news-
paper cringe to, an opponent who so plainly
despises both. What is surprising is that
people who have received the blessings of free
education, as they are called, should be so
ready to be misled by these false guides,
and so credulous when they resort to the
audacious lying which is another familiar
feature of mob leadership. Mr. Lang’s
latest effort in this line was: “Great Britain
is not paying its interest, France is not
paying its interest—Australia alone is har-
assing its people to make these impossible
payments.” His newspaper discovers that
“the real purpose behind the closing of the
Government Savings Bank” was “a deter-
mination to make the savings of over one
million N.S.W. citizens, who were inveigled
into depositing their money in the Com-
monwealth Bank, readily accessible in the
event of the Commonwealth deciding to
seize them to make up the bondholders’
interest.” That these outrageous false-
hoods should be invented and published is
not so astounding as that they should be
believed. Obviously thousands of persons
who should know 7 better do believe them
and are prepared to follow Mr. Lang
blindly wherever he may lead. They fol-
lowed him when he promised to find work
for all, and when his own Director of Labor
Exchanges reported that the number of
unemployed had increased to 120,000; when
he said “the Labor party sets its face
against all repudiation,” and w 7 hen he
erected repudiation into a system; when he
paid interest to foreigners and swindled
subjects of the King to whom he has
sworn allegiance; when he undertook to
“save the people’s homes” and go in for
“prudent finance,” and when he smashed
the Savings Bank; when he pledged him-
self to withdraw from the Loan Council,
and when he went crawling to it for money
with which to pay his civil servants after
he had brought Black Thursday upon them;
when he declared that “Australia’s loan posi-
tion and trade balance is a Commonwealth
matter being carefully handled by an able
Labor Prime Minister,” and when he
pulled the “able Labor Prime Minister”
down; when he tried to wreck the Premiers’
plan with his 55.-in-the-£ tax, when he
accepted it, when he made a dishonest
show of enforcing it, and, finally, when he
repudiated it—defaulting not only on inter-
est due to overseas creditors, but on money
due to the Commonwealth and its bank
in respect of Treasury bills and debentures
issued on behalf of N. S. Wales.
This time last year the State bank which
was the first victim of the Lang “plan”
closed its doors. A million depositors found
then, and for six months afterwards, how
much suffering may be caused to the innocent
when an unprincipled demagogue lays rude
hands on the sensitive plant confidence, and
how worthless were the printed assurances
on their passbooks that “all deposits are
repayable on demand,” being “guaranteed
by the Government of New South Wales.”
Payments were not resumed in part until
the Commonwealth mercifully relieved the
necessities of depositors who were on the
breadline; they were not resumed in full
until the Commonwealth took over the
stricken institution. That was an exercise
of Commonwealth power in which even the
guilty Government acquiesced, its credit
being gone and its guarantee waste paper.
Another just and necessary exercise of
power has been forced on the national Gov-
ernment by the wicked resurrection of the
“plan” which broke the bank and which,
if not scotched, would break the country.
To preserve the solvency of Australia the
national Government has paid the money
owed by N. S. Wales to overseas creditors, to
the Commonwealth and to the Common-
wealth .Bank. The measures it has adopted
to recover this money have been pro-
nounced lawful by the highest tribunal in
the land, but they are being resisted in such
a way as to cause the maximum of con-
fusion and loss. And in defiance of its
own Audit Act, the defaulting Administra-
tion has withdrawn all State funds from
the banks, and is keeping them in the
Treasury. Meanwhile there is sinister talk
of organising resistance in more violent
forms, and of breaking up the union of
States which, “humbly relying on the bless-
ing of Almighty God, agreed to unite in
one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth
under the Crown”; and at this dangerous
moment the idiotic proceedings in the De
Groot case have weakened the respect in
which the splendid police force has hitherto
been held. Bad men are even whispering
to one another “The police are with us.”
What is the representative of the King
going to do about it? He has stood much
more from the gang in office than Sir
Dudley de Chair stood from a previous
gang, led by the same person, and a great
deal more than would have been suffered
by Sir Harry Rawson. But even the extra-
ordinary patience of Sir Philip Game must
have its limits. He cannot possibly
approve of flagrant breaches of Common-
wealth and State laws involving not only
Ministers but servants of the Crown, nor as
a Governor who serves Crown and people,
according to his lights, can he remain a
passive spectator of these lawless proceed-
ings. He must either resign straightway or
send his Ministers to their masters. If he
takes neither course, and if utterly reckless
resistance to the laws, associated with the
inflaming of the passions of the mob, leads
to blood being shed, history will not hold
Sir Philip Game guiltless.
SUNDAY AT LONG BAY.
To-day we were awakened later. It is
usually six. On Sundays it is seven. Then
down in the yard the bell rang. It keeps
on ringing for about 10 minutes, this awak-
ening bell, so that we may not oversleep.
But in gaol one does not sleep very soundly
—for the first few months at any rate.
We sleep in hammocks attached by rings
to fastenings in the wall. The first thing
we do when we get up is to take down our
hammock, because the thing stretches
across the width of the cell. As well we
have to fold it neatly, and roll our blankets
and leave them by our cell door.
The sparse furniture of the cell includes a
little dustpan and brush, and we get busy
with these as soon as we are dressed (since
we have to sleep in our prison clothes
there is no delay about dressing). Then we
put our little wooden stool in its proper
place—and wait.
W hen all the doors have been unlocked,
we may emerge and put down our rolled
blankets and folded hammock by the side
of the door. Then we take up our night-
pan, and wait with it, just by the door, until
the warder issues the next command.
“Left turn, quick march!” and we file
down, through our exercise-yard, and out
and along to where the night-pan cleaners
are waiting to receive these things. We
drop them as we go by, and march back to
our exercise-yard. Here, at one end, are
four basins; and at these about 40 of us
wash. Then up and down the exercise-yard,
all moving the one way, until the next thing
happens.
This next thing happens when a gang of
cookhouse men carry into the yard a large
stretcher-like affair with our breakfasts.
Then “Fall in!” and we line up. A warder
calls out our numbers; as each one is
called he salutes, says “Sir,” and steps for-
ward and receives his breakfast. Breakfast
is hominy and a piece of dry bread (short-
sentence men never see tea or tobacco
in Long Bay). We take our tin of hominy
in our hand, and the piece of bread, and go
up to our cell. As soon as we get in the
door is locked behind us. We have a
container of water in the cell. It is the
only thing there is ad lib. With this we
wash down our breakfast.
We get an hour for every meal, so there’s
no need at all to suffer from indigestion.
Then about nine we hear another bell, and
the unlocking begins again. This time we
come out with our hominy-tin in our hand,
and when we march down to the yard we
drop it, as we pass, into a wheel-cart. Then
we walk up and down the exercise-yard.
About ten we cease ambulating and fall
in. Then we march into church. The
church is used for both Catholic and Pro-
testant services, and also for concerts. We
don’t suffer from sectarianism in gaol.
Warders marshal us into the seats, and
warders stand along the walls. I find myself
at the Catholic service. There is a lull
while the priest is putting on his vestments
in the sacristy. Two nuns are in the church.
They are busy with hymn-books and the
organ. They are thoroughly human-looking
women, and they manage to get in an odd
word or two with some of the prisoners.
The choir, five or six long-sentence men,
are in the front bench. One is a lifer. He is
quite young, and dressed all in white (our
own uniforms are multi-colored). -He has
a strained look on his face—a dancing-with-
tears-in-your-eyes sort of look. It disturbs
me. But they sing lustily enough—a pre-
liminary hymn, and a few of us join in.
We sing hymns off and on right through
mass. And the fellows would not mind if
they stayed there all day, singing hymns.
It’s much better than being alone in your
cell.
Then, after the Gospel, the priest mounts
the pulpit. Perhaps we’ve been outside the
Church for a long time. But it’s never too
late. W T e can go back now. Maybe God
even sent us where we are for that very
purpose. And then he talks of the parable
of the Prodigal Son. I can hardly imagine
any other congregation so attentive as a
gaol congregation. Their very willingness
to hang on the preacher’s lips must warm
the enthusiasm of the very God in Heaven.
After mass we sing one more hymn, and
then it’s all over. Back to our exercise-
yard, where we keep on walking up and
down till dinner-time.
Dinner is the only substantial meal in
gaol. It consists of cold, watery soup, a
piece of meat and a few vegetables. This
is carried in a sort of can, in two layers.
We receive it as with breakfast, and then
go up, and get locked into our cells.
Another hour. Then we come down again
with our dinner cans (empty), and the knife
and fork we took up with them. And then
we walk up and down—up and down, up and
down the yard till 4 p.m.
At four we are locked in for the night
(this happens every day). Before we go up
at four we take in some more hominy,
and eat it with any bread we have left
from the morning. At 4.30 a bell rings,
doors are unlocked, and we put out our
hominy tins. At five another bell rings;
then we stand, with our boots off, fully
dressed, with our hats on, facing the walls
of our cells. Each door is again unlocked
and a warder comes in and searches us.
This is the last thing every night. Then
we are left to ourselves until 6.30 the next
morning.
We have one book. The light stays on
from six to nine, then goes out. This lock-
ing-in at four in the afternoon is for most
men the worst part of gaol life. During the
working week, instead of walking up and
down the yard, we roll balls of twine, sit-
ting on benches in the yard. The long-
service men work outside.
Long Bay has nice surroundings; but
we never see them. We see nothing but
high walls and bars. Even the cell door is
so designed that it excludes practically all
light. The only daylight we see in our
cells trickles through the air ventilator
above the door, and the last thing we hear
at night is the warder going round with a
rod tapping the bars to make sure that
none of them have been loosened.
If ever you’ve thought the fellows inside
get a good time in Long Bay you were
wrong. And if you’ve ever got inside and
thought, what you’ve almost certainly
thought is, “My God, what a waste!”

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Their Dawn.
On post the night watch changes,
And zero hour creeps round.
When spectral vision ranges
Its scope of hallowed ground.
Time’s torments cease to plunder
When, spurning common fears,
An April morning’s thunder
Rolls back across the years.
In hold and hull, though freighted
To serve the call of pain,
Expectant and elated,
They venture once again
On seas of Sapphic lustre,
Girt round with fabled isles
That once beheld the muster
Of Homer’s phalanx files.
W T hile yet the tide which bore them
Gives up its precious spoil,
Grim shores that crouch before them
’Neath tempest flames recoil.
While yet from dark expanses
Day’s emblem crowns the steep,
Their climbing front advances
Where counter-tempests leap.
* * * *
In spirit still united,
In strife their links sustain;
Replenished and requited,
They guard their souls’ domain
In light that loiters palely
On cross and laurel grove,
While clamors their Reveille
Of dawn at Anzac Cove.
N a w Gerardy.

Another Trades Hall Victory.
Trades Hall tyrants have brought down
another Labor Ministry which deserved a
better fate. While Hogan was able to
attend to his job of leading the Victorian
Government he stood firmly for the Pre-
miers’ plan, defying the repeated threats
of the Trades Hall bosses that if he did not
abandon his policy for theirs, the practic-
able for the impossible, he would be “re-
moved” and “refused endorsement.” He
was manfully supported in this attitude by
Jones, the Minister of Works and leader of
the Leg Council.
But Hogan fell ill and had to go abroad
in search of health. His sceptre passed
into the weaker hands of Tunnecliffe, the
Chief Secretary. The bosses renewed their
threats and Tunnecliffe shivered. Hogan
represents a country district, Warrenheip-
Grenville. Tunnecliffe sits for suburban
Collingwood, and Collingwood is notoriously
unhealthy for Labor politicians who do not
bend to the bosses. The Government, with
Tunnecliffe as leader, had to meet Parlia-
ment. It put into the mouth of the Lieut .-
Governor a dull speech in which no men-
tion was made of the Premiers’ plan.
Argyle, the U.A.P. leader, pounced on this
omission and pointed out that parts 1 and
2 of the Financial Emergency Act, dealing
with the reduction of Parliamentary and
public-service salaries and pensions, had
been enacted for 12 months only and time
was running out. He asked for an assurance
that the vital sections would be re-enacted.
Not getting one he challenged the Govern-
ment on a no-confidence amendment. The
Acting Premier replied with a shuffling
speech, but shuffling was not enough for
the three unattached members who have
kept his Government in office—it has never
had a majority of its own—-and the division
found the Administration four votes to the
bad. It will remain in office, perhaps
without Jones and Kieman, till the general
election, which will be held on May 14;
its prospects of surviving the verdict of the
constituencies are remote.
Lang arrived in Melbourne when the
Government was tottering, and, after the
familiar stage-managed reception at
Spencer-street station, made tracks for the
Trades Hall. He has a bit of a following
there among the sillier windbags, who have
encouraged him to cherish ambitions which
will be rudely shattered. N. S. Wales has
endured Lang for nearly 18 months, and
has made itself a world’s wonder by doing
so, but Victorians have other standards. It
is inconceivable that they will ever tolerate
Lang or his plan or any imitation of either.

The Maoriland Riots.
As every old policeman knows, an excited
mob in any city of Maoriland is a terrible
thing to cope with, particularly if some
political or industrial controversy has set
the spark to the explosion. Though ordi-
narily as well-behaved and law-abiding as
the people of any part of the Empire,
Maorilanclers have heard the Riot Act
read in each of the four cities more than
once. Auckland on Thursday night wit-
nessed wild scenes of looting and destruc-
tion in the city’s principal thoroughfare that
lasted for nearly three hours. Melbourne
had a similar experience in October, 1923;
but on that occasion there was a police
strike. In Auckland the police were over-
powered.
The trouble had its genesis in a dis-
turbance, evidently deliberately organised,
at a meeting of postal employees in the
Town Hall to protest against a second cut
in their wages. The police, present in
small force, were worsted in an attempt to
maintain order, and the fury engendered in
the fight flared up into a wave of window-
breaking and looting that swept along
Queen-street. In some respects it was a
worse disturbance than the affair of 1913,
when waterside strikers for a day or two
held possession of the four principal ports.
There was rioting in Wellington and Lyttel-
ton when the police attempted to oust these
strikers and their sympathisers. The insurrec-
tion was quelled by the speedy mobilisation
of what was virtually an army of farmers,
who occupied the wharves behind barricades
under military officers and patrolled the
streets of the ports in force.
The spix-it of patriotism engendered by
the Great War and the generally prosperous
times that followed in the war’s wake
spared the Reformers—the fai'mers’ pai’ty in
politics—ti’ouble during the l’est of their
reign. The depression, the formation of a
coalition dominated by Reformers, and the
unpopular character of many of the steps
taken to adjust the national scale of living
to the Dominion’s reduced income have
made wage-earners in the cities and country
towns discontented. In Maoriland, as in
Australia, they have been told by Labor
agitators that they ai'e “the producers” and
have been robbed of the fruits of their
labor by “the capitalists”; and the growing
army of unemployed is, as in Australia,
pi’oviding recruits for the Communists.
Australians may learn from this Axxckland
disturbance how ciuel and brutal a mob
can be, and how like savages even ordi-
narily decent men and women can Denave
when, law and oi’der temporarily failing,
professional criminals and Communists set
them the example. Nor should the lesson
be lost on that police administration which
has been, so over-zealous in pursuit of the
New Guard.

The Issue in Queensland.
The dissolution of the Queensland Pai’lia-
ment left a lot of people wishing uneasily
that the Government had completed its
useful work byf setting up an elective
second Chamber. The old nominee Leg.
Council wasn’t much of a brake on dema-
goguery, but the people regai’ded it as pi’e-
ferable to no brake at all. This Theodore
found when he took a refeiendum on the
subject. To his disgusted surprise the
voting was overwhelmingly in favor of the
bicameral system. That, however, was too
small an obstacle to be allowed to stand in
the way. The people’s vei’dict notwith-
standing, the Leg. Council was abolished by
the undemocratic device of flooding it with
members of the right color.
Then followed an unchecked orgy of
State socialism. Money was lavishly bor-
rowed and just as lavishly spent on fan-
tastic enterprises which went headlong
to ruin. At last came the time when, in
spite of jerrymandered electorates, Queens-
land threw the Labor gang out and in-
stalled Mooi’e and his pai’ty with a big
majority in their place.
The new Government was confronted
with a worse situation than any previous
Queensland Administration had to face. A
straightforwai’d attitude was taken from
the first. The personnel of the overstaffed
public services was closely pruned, and
oppressive class legislation dealing with
industi’ial conditions and awards was sus-
pended. In this and other ways Queensland
has come through the bad times very much
better than any other State, and the Moore
Government deserves all ci’edit for its per-
formance in that direction, especially in
regard to its efforts to meet unemploy-
ment by providing part-time woik instead
of the dole.
But all its good work may be undone if
the popular verdict goes to the party that
ruled in the boom years and has learned
nothing in the years of slump. The menace
of an unchecked single legislative body in
the grip of ci’ude and irresponsible party
fanatics again faces the State, which in the
past has suffered so much from similar con-
ditions.

Truckling to the Digger.
The Reds of Sydney Trades Hall have
suddenly developed a tender consideration
for returned soldiers. Time was, and not
so long ago, when the Digger was an object
of execration to this section and its congeners
in other States. Soldier preference was
furiously opposed. The ex-warrior was de-
scribed as a swashbuckling popinjay when
he was not a bloody-handed “five-bob-a-
day murderer.” Verses like the one which
pictured the Australian dead in battle as
lying “with swollen, putrid faces turned
stinking to the sky” were dashed off, ox-
resurrected and given a local application.
Now it is proudly announced that
N.S.W. “Labor” has oi’ganised an active
force largely recruited from returned
soldiers and “directed” by the moi’e ex-
pei’ienced among them. These men are to
be the spearpoint in the massed attack on
the forces of “capitalism” at the State elec-
tions and at other convenient moments.
Whether the attack is to take a political
or a physical aspect is conveniently left
vague. Printed and pictured references to
the A.I.F. have been correspondingly
altered. It now appeal’s that the soldier
was butchered abroad for the sake of the
capitalist who is starving him at home.
It is all very interesting, but ex-Diggers
should be the last to be deceived by it.
Those who are rising to the lure might do
worse than consider not only what has hap-
pened to their kind at the hands of these
Reds, but what will certainly happen to
them in the futui’e if agitatoi-s of the type
which is now cringing to them should be-
come supreme. They might also ascer-
tain, borrowing a microscope for the pur-
pose, how many ex-Diggers there are m
the Labor Caucus, and how many among
the Leg. Councillors who were appointed
on Lang’s nomination by Sir Dudley de
Chair and Sir Philip Game.

‘ ‘Economic Rehabilitation. ’ ’
Dr. Earle Page, who refused to join the
Lyons Cabinet unless he was given the
Customs portfolio, hastened to congratulate
the economic committee which prepared a
report for the Premiers’ conference , on its
proposal for'“a review of the tariff”: —
The experts have at, last apparently been forced
to a realisation which was reached by the Country
party long ago, and expressed by me when the
Premiers’ plan was first put forward—that there
can be no real beginning to Australia’s economic
rehabilitation which does not include a downward
revision of the tariff.
They seem to think differently in Eng-
land, where Parliament has been making
an upward revision of the tariff with vast
energy. In March British imports were
£9,000,000 less than in February, while ex-
ports increased by about £1,200,000, thanks
to the improvement in local manufactures.
In the six months from September, 1930,
to March, 1931, the number of Britons
employed diminished by over 250,000; in the
corresponding six months of 1931-32 nearly
250,000 previously idle were employed. The
actual improvement was 486,000.
Britain discovered in 1931 that its ex-
ports, including the earnings of its shipping,
etc., abroad, were £110,000,000 short of the
amount required to pay for its imports.
Regarding the situation, which was growing
worse, as absolutely impossible in peace
time it produced its new and robust tariff
right away. The Bruce-Page Government
found itself in at least as bad a situation,
in proportion to population, every year it
held office. For itself and for the States
it borrowed the money required, and the in-
evitable burst came when it went out of office.
Dr. Page was re-elected on his New State
policy. He had better stick to that.

Mill-white Sugar.
Dear Bulletin, —In reply to “A.D.S.”
(B. '6/4/’32), let me say that the agree-
ment between the Commonwealth and
Queensland Governments specifically pro-
vides for mill-white sugar being made avail-
able to the trade at £32 10s. 6d. per ton,
or id. per pound cheaper than the refined
article. All that is required is that reason-
able notice of requirements should be given.
Experience, however, has shown that the
public do not want mill whites. Millaquin,
which specialises in this grade of sugar,
finds that about 100 tons p.a. fills the bill
for Australia.
The comparison made with the various
grades of useable sugar sold over the
counter in Britain is misleading. All these
grades are refined sugar in one form or
another. Mill white is really a bleached
raw sugar, good enough for immediate con-
sumption, but deteriorating rapidly if
stored for any length of time. Jam or
condensed milk made with it will not
possess the same keeping qualities as if
made with refined sugar. As the raw-sugar
mills are running for only six months in
the year it would not be possible in any
case to turn out regular fresh supplies.
The Commonwealth committee of inquiry
reported last year: “In view of the tech-
nical evidence tendered to the committee
we are of the opinion that there is no
advantage to be derived from the manu-
facture and marketing of mill whites under
Australian conditions.”—Yours etc., C.
Mack.
*
Our Railways. ■
Built with borrowed money, Australian
State railways carry a vast public debt, to
which is added annually a heavy loss on
their operation. As convenient grazing
places for herds of political vote-cattle, they
are grossly over-staffed; for the same rea-
son, economic or even effective manage-
ment is impossible.
Modern practice elsewhere realises that
the railway must serve the public, not the
public the railway. Here every State Gov-
ernment is setting itself definitely to drive
off all competition with its railways, irre-
spective of the public’s convenience, the
public’s business or the public’s purse. They
see only the railways, excellent things with
which to swing a vote, great places for soft
jobs for henchmen, a fine system for keep-
ing the city vote sweet by dragging country
produce hundreds of miles out of its way in
order to chai-ge toll on it at a bottleneck.
They employ sabotage against private
transport in a score of ways—for example,
by unofficial hints to gatekeepers at coun-
try crossings to delay carriers. They use
the taxpayer’s money to fight those other
taxpayers who offer him a better and more
convenient service than the railways pro-
vide. They use their monopolistic privileges
to exploit the country for the benefit of the
cities. And every year they wind up with
a huge loss, whilst the few private railways
in Australia show consistent profits.
They cry incessantly that the railways
are one of Australia’s great and reproduc-
tive permanent assets. Are they? Modern
engineering practice realises that steam
railways are near to the discard, except for
long-distance heavy haulage ‘ on main
arterial lines, fed at well-spaced intervals by
motor haulage on light branch lines, or
roads sited and designed for commercial—
not tourist —traffic. Modem engineering
science realises that some new invention,
be it the atomic engine or some material
which will reduce the haulage-weight of an
ore train to that of a motor trailer, or half
a dozen other scientific possibilities on
■which some of the best brains in the world
are working, may throw all steam railways
on the scrapheap in a year. The quality
of permanency in the value of our rail-
ways is not much to bank on. Cobb’s
coaches and the tea-clippers were wonder-
ful advances in their day, but greater
advances on transport than they repre-
sented are within the vision of engineers.
Were some miracle to happen whereby
our Governments became injected with
commonsense and sincerity, they would
begin by closing every line which had not
paid its way for the last three years, con-
verting feeder lines to motors, converting
these lines if necessary to roadways for
motor haulage (with a concession to those
who use Australian spirit), and reducing
staff to actual needs as determined by com-
petent non-political advisers. Line-conver-
sion would give employment to many men
who are now dead losses as dolers, dole
payment being continued on a rationing
system of labor in return. Surplus raihvay-
men could be kept off the unemployed
ranks in the same way, until returning
prosperity in a country saved from the
present perpetual drag on private and public
finance would enable them to secure per-
manent employment once more.
An alternative would be to cut enough
of the burden from selected lines to make
them reasonably attractive commercial
propositions, and to lease them to private
enterprise under a carefully-drafted agree-
ment which would ensure that the public
got a fair deal.

A Railway that Pays.
Dear Bulletin, —It is true that West-
ralia’s Midland Railway Co. meets taxes
and other charges which the Government
railways competing with it escape, and still
manages to show profits, whereas the Gov-
ernment system is losing heavily (B.
23/3/’32); but that is not the whole story.
During the depression years the company
has in no single instance resorted to re-
trenchment. At its headquarters at Mid-
land Junction, where the State railways
have their chief workshops, from which
hundreds of men who have grown old in
the service and others who have just fin-
ished their apprenticeships have been dis-
missed, the co. has kept its staff intact.
Workshop hands, locomotive, traffic and
administration men are all in jobs. And
as an outsider with opportunities of judg-
ing. I can certify that the services have
never been better. The general manager,
Poynton, is an Australian, and a very cap-
able one; but I suppose those bloodsucking
British bondholders and Shylocks whom
your Mr. Lang hates so much are entitled
to a share in the credit. They own the
railway that and doesn’t retrench. —
Yours etc., Vicar.
Perquisites and Superfluities.
Australia is to have a Department of the
Interior in place of the former depart-
ments of Works and Home Affairs; and
this is a move in the right direction. But
there is much more to be done. The esti-
mates for 1932 could provide a fine bag of
game for Mr. Lyons’s economy-gun. were it
not for the tigers which lurk behind the
union bushes. For example, it is difficult for
taxpayers to understand why their clerical
masters should require to be bribed to live
at Canberra. Canberra has been repeatedly
described as the most healthful, charming
and convenient city in Australia. Millions
have been spent on providing it with all the
civic luxuries. Yet, nearly £20,000 yearly is
extorted from the taxpayers for “Canberra
Allowance” to the comparatively few Fed-
eral officers stationed there. Mr. Lyons’s
own department draws £lBlO, Works £2400,
Treasury £l4OO, and so on.
It is reasonable enough that some allow-
ance should be made to men stationed at,
say, Normanton or Wyndham, to compen-
sate for the extra cost of living and remote-
ness from civilisation, but if half the claims
made for Canberra as a desirable place of
residence are true a charge might well be
made for the privilege of residing there.
The fact is that “Canberra Allowance” was
a concession extorted by the clerks’ union*
in the good old days when there were
plenty of outside jobs. There is not the
slightest warrant for continuing to pay it.
Another item which deserves Mr. Lyons’s
attention is that of “Officers on Unattached
List, Pending Suitable Vacancies,” in the
Postmaster-General’s estimates- —ironically
described amongst “Business Undertakings.”
These officers draw among them nearly
£BB,OOO in salaries, presumably with the
usual perquisites of child endowment, dis-
trict allowance and so on added. No real
business undertaking keeps men on its pay-
roll when there are no suitable vacancies
for them, particularly in bad times. Only
a grossly overstaffed service can have men
on its hands and no jobs for them. If
Mr. Lyons were to introduce even a half-
pay system for these superfluous officers he
would save the taxpayer over £40.000 yearly,
without creating a single case of unemploy-
ment. If he fails in this, he might at least-
spare the taxpayers the irony of seeing the
Postmaster-General’s Department, which
considers that it has had a good year when
it draws on the taxpayers for a quarter of
a million, described as a “Business Under-
taking.”

MADE BY CARRERAS LIMITED, 144 Years’ Reputation for Quality
POLITICAL
POINTS
In one respect Australia is doing well.
The balance of trade is now definitely on
the right side; in eight months of 1931-32
exports, specie and bullion excluded, were
valued at £22,000,000 more than imports.
And there are industries which have not
been hard hit by the depression—for
example, dairy-farming and, of course, gold-
mining—while good seasons continue, though
wool and wheat prices remain low. But
the Governments, instead of paying their
way, arc still leaning heavily on the banks,
unemployment is, if anything, increasing,
trade-union and public-service leaders are
growing more truculent in their demands;
and Lang is a worse blight than ever. He
rushed over to Melbourne for the Premiers’
conference, and uttered his familiar roar
about the prime necessity of “keeping here”
the interest we pledged ourselves to pay to
the country which (1) lent us nearly all
the money we have spent on “works,” (2)
buys most of the produce we send abroad
and (3) owns the navy which is our first
line of defence. Then he nished back to do
more mischief.
A queer feature of these Premiers’ con-
ferences is the number of professors who are
called in to advise. Some of the Premiers
think there are too many professors on the
premises; some of the professors think there
are too many Premiers.
Starting with the childish notion that
Australia sends money abroad to pay its
interest bill. Lang solves the unemployment
problem to his own satisfaction;—
Our people are without work because £30,000,000
of borrowed money, which Governments used to dis-
tribute in the form of wages, is not circulating
and that huge market has been lost to producers.
In our present desperate straits we are justified in
replacing that £30,000,000 by keeping here the
£36,000,000 which ordinarily is sent abroad in
payment of interest.
In other words, circumstances have deprived
us of the dope that we used to get on credit,
Therefore let iis pinch it, and 20 per cent,
more.
Harwell, when Premier of South Aus.,
judged (years too soon) that the post-war
boom was about to burst, and said “Wages
must come down.” State politicians have
never forgotten what happened to him at
the ensuing election; ( and Lang was not the
only Premier who sniffed when the com-
mittee of “experts” (“two businessmen and
four economists”) suggested at the Mel-
bourne conference, Lyons approving, that
“At the Melbourne conference a 10 p.c. reduction
of wages was proposed to the State Premiers, one
of whom will have to face the electors in May and
another in June.”
MOORE: “I can’t hear you, Professor. Can
you, Tunnecliffe?"
TUNNECLIFFE: “Not a blessed word!”
“the 10 p.c. reduction provided for under
Federal arbitration awards be made general.”
In countries where politics are divorced from
industry these embarrassing issues never
arise. There was lack of enthusiasm like-
wise when the Prime Minister proposed, also
at the instance of the experts, that the ex-
change rate should be raised. Interest was
shown in his plan for a £10,000,000 “unem-
ployment” loan, but when was interest never
shown in loan schemes?
The Lang “party’s” organisation in South
Aus. is described as “an absolute auto'cracy
dominated by the president.” In that it re-
sembles the parent body, and it has also
inherited a tendency to announce, all of a
.sudden, that members whose faces annoy it
have “automatically placed themselves out-
side the movement.” Two gentlemen it shot
out in this way lately are leaders of the
“Unemployed Workers’ Association,” which
has “carried a resolution of protest against
the expulsions.” Facts also on record are
that “Mr. Collaton, M.L.A. for Adelaide,
was summoned by his party (Lang’s) for
alleged debt.... Mr. Collaton then issued
a. summons against the president of the
‘party,’ ” and “another member of the ‘party’
issued a summons against Mr. Collaton
for alleged assault.” It is all pleasantly
familiar.
After many alarms and excursions, the
Sandgate council of the Ministerial party
“endorsed” Sizer, the Queensland Minister
of Labor and Industry, for the local seat in
the Assembly, which he has held for years.
Sizer contended that a member of the
Cabinet should not have to run the gauntlet
of a party plebiscite; and apparently the
Sandgate council agreed with him: ‘ But
“endorsement” means nothing in this in-
stance ; there is still to be a ballot. Such is
pre-selection.
It has been thought since 1649 or there-
abouts that even kings are subject to the
laws, but seemingly Lang regards himself as
above them. Section 20 of the Audit Act says :
“The Treasurer shall from day to day pay
into a bank keeping Government accounts all
moneys received into the Treasury”; but
even before the Financial Agreements En-
forcements Act became operative Lang had
over a million transferred from the banks
to the Treasury, and he has ignored the re-
quirements of the section since. And the
banks allowed the
Government interest
on its daily balance ;
Lang doesn’t. In
the same spirit, and
for the same pur-
pose, he has deprived
two racing clubs of
their legal right to
use the tote.
Some of these pub-
lic servants seem to
have plenty of time
for palavers on pub-
lic-service politics,
and presumably they
are paid by a grate-
ful country while
thus engaged. Mr.
Flynn, for instance,
attended a confer-
ence in Sydney
which lasted two or
three days. Then
he posted over to
Melbourne for an-
other conference. Mr.
Flynn is a stipen-
diary magistrate, and
his last recorded
utterance on the Bench before the Mel-
bourne trip was a rebuke administered
to nine members of the New Guard,
whom he fined 10s. for “having pasted up
election posters at Neutral Bay and Chats-
wood” (Communists are never punished for
this kind of offence, but then Communists
are privileged). “Your act was one of
school-children,” said Mr. Flynn severely.
Perhaps it was; but it was not a millionth
part as mischievous as the brand of politics
which Mr. Flynn has seen fit to support.
South Aus. leads, the States in the
matter of average savings-bank deposits. Its
total of 20 millions works out at the
surprising figure of over £35 a bead.
It is catching a bit of the trade which N. S.
Wales is losing because of Langism.
Queensland is warming up for the general
election, the outcome of which, owing to the
redistribution, has everyone guessing. The
Government will have t 0 face that element
which is always antagonised by efforts at
national economy,, but claims that the coun-
try electorates will rally to it in stronger
force than ever. Labor is banking mostly
on city electorates and the far-northern min-
ing constituencies. Both sides may experi-
ence some surprises. Premier Moore will
deliver his policy speech at Oakey on April
29, and June 11 has been fixed for polling-
day.
In 1929 the Old Man in. London collected
£484,000,000 from money invested abroad,
including shipping business and interest on
loans to people more or less like Lang. In
1930 income from abroad was £414,000,000;
in 1931 it fell to £301,000,000. Then
Bull realised . that he must reduce his
imports and increase his home manufac-
tures by about £112,000,000 worth per
annum unless he wanted to become a chronic
borrower like Australia. He has started a
remorseless cutting down of his importing
business, and a corresponding cultivation of
his home manufactures, without going into
much disputation with theorists like our
Earle Page about the rightness or wrong-
ness of the matter; and so far he is emi-
nently satisfied with the results.
In his latest attack on the bankers who
won’t lend him any money, Lang referred
to them as financial “czars.” Perhaps they
are; but anyhow the original czars had a
pretty good record in money matters, if not
in others. They borrowed large sums from
the British and the French, but never repu-
diated. Even under the allegedly terrible
Nicholas 1., 'who was a big man with a
bald head, a protruding chin and a small
moustache, just like Lang, the interest on
British loans was faithfully paid all through
the Crimean War.
The Vic. dissolution found the electoral
registrars ready. In the 26 metropolitan divir
sions there are 619,183 electors, and the
39 country electorates have 439,236; the
proportion, 100 to 47, is practically the same
as when the Allancocks put through the
redistribution scheme in 1926. The most
populous electorate is Oakleigh (28,231),
represented by the Labor squire, Reid. He
and nine other Hbganites feel anxious about
their seats, and there is warrant for their
worry.
lt is complained that the State-owned
Ford works at Nijni Novgorod haven’t begun
to produce any cars yet. The ill-paid work-
men employed are said to number 25,000.
“The central committee of the Communist
party blames bad leadership and man-
agement by the officials.” according to tbo
cabled report, and reorganisation and general
hustle are promised. Probably there will be
a weeding out of “suspects.” The Russian
police make most of their visitations between
midnight and 3 a.m., and when there is a
pounding on a door by night the rest of the
tenement house cultivates silence and retire-
ment. It is likely to be the police, and it

Comrade Smith, is probably removed, and is
not heard of again. People don’t write to
the local paper about the evaporation of
Smith. They know better, and so does the
editor.
Scullin was telling a crowd of Melbourne
Uni. students all about his scheme for
selling the gold reserve when a youth who
had just paid two’-thirds more than the pub-
lished price for a textbook asked bitterly,
“What about books?” Scullin wriggled, and
then resorted to the old trick of trans-
ferring responsibility.. “My successor, when
in Opposition,” he said, “was a strong advo-
cate of lifting the duty on books. Ask him.”
While somebody is asking somebody else the
students will have to get their textbooks
somehow.
The present attitude of De Valera seems
to be that he wants to be outside the Empire,
repudiating the oath of allegiance and the
debt which the Irish Government incurred,
and proposes at the same time to recog
nise the . debt (collecting the money and
spending it himself) and to have a voice
in the Empire Conference at Ottawa. He
has represented both cases in Parliament:
he was member for County Down in the
North for some years. He was sentenced to
death for leading an insurrection, but the
oppressor didn’t mean it, and he was almost
immediately released. This aggravated him,
and subsequent proceedings led to his being
enclosed in a leaky gaol. From there he
stole away to his native U.S.A., and there
he raised six million dollars on behalf of
his mother’s country, his father’s country
(Spain),, which Uncle had grievously de
spoiled in 1899, not being any asset to
arouse sympathy. De Valera’s future career
is expected to be unexpected, like his past.
Sydney was amused when it was an-
nounced that the national Government had
seized accounts which had been planted by
the defaulting N.S.W. Administration in the
Comptoir National d’Escompte and the Yoko-
hama Specie Bank. The absurdity of a
socialist Ministry depositing funds in pri-
vate and foreign institutions when the
nation’s own bank was available tickled its
ribs; but there was something more. Here
was “Australia’s foremost statesman,” “the
greatest Premier in the Emnire.” emulating
the methods of the homing drunk who hides
a couple of bottles of beer down the back
garden in the hope that the missus won’t
find them.
Melbourne University undergrads have
started a Labor Club, and there "was an
uproar over its proposal to have a news-
paper, like other societies over which Alma
Mater spreads her wings. It was at first
suggested that a censorship should be exer-
cised over the journal, but wiser counsels pre-
vailed, and the authorities decided merely to
make the editors responsible for the views of
contributors. The club now feels so self-
confident that it proposes to collect f 110 to
send a student to Russia. The authorities
say they have no objection provided he does
not present himself before the Soviet as a
representative of the University. And no
doubt the general public will not object pro-
vided that on his return he does not present
himself as an authority on Russia.
The new fashion of the public servant
being prosecutor, jury and judge has had
a setback in England. A traffic-cop over-
hastily decided that a motorist was break-
ing the law, and without questioning the
supposed offender booked him. Thereupon
the motorist received one of the boss cop’s
form-letters chiding him for his sin and
threatening penalties. He replied with some
asperity that the boss, cop had better try to
prove what he alleged in the ordinary legal
way—he made such a fuss, in fact, that the
Commissioner had to prosecute. Having no
evidence to. offer, he failed; the suit was
dismissed with costs. If Australians adopted
the same course when bullied by public ser-
vants, what fun police and taxation depart-
ments would have!
The question whether wages are too higli
in theory, or whether they can ever be too
at 1 o v«r S * n a state of agitation in
IYb.W. The nominal average factory wage
(£222 13s. sd. per annum for every man,
woman, boy and girl during 1929-30) is the
biggest in Australia, and the biggest that
was ever put oil record in Australia —always
provided that people can get it. Yet it is
a question whether the factory workers get
as much as they did five years earlier when
the nominal average annual wage was £l7
less, and if me nominal average annual wage
was shoved up to £445 Os. 10d., just for the
triumphant appearance of things, the actual
pay collected might be about nothing. In
1920-30 Lang’s State had the biggest drop in
the number of hands employed. Factory work-
ers of Australia were 31,288 fewer than in
the year before, and 17,893 of that loss was
in N.S.W. There is no fixed law in a case
of this kind, but if a worker gets 6d. for
earning £1 it is absurdly little, and when
anybody promises him 265. for earning £1
that person is a liar.
Melbourne City Council and Bailey, the
Minister for Lands, are again sparring over
the use of the western market area. From
buildings which face Collins, William, Little
Flinders and Market streets the corporation
draws a substantial revenue, and it wants
to get an extra £l5OO p.a. by letting the
quadrangle. Bailey thunders that if it dares
to use the quadrangle for any purpose other
than a market he will have the whole block
resumed. As the public knows, it is only
sparring; the council will hold on, as it has
always done.
Every vote was accounted for when the

hard up, if not on the dole. The latest to
collect a first prize, at the time of writing,
has been out of work for two years. Il'is
cottage, he told the “Sun,” was “besieged
by beggars, one of whom asked for £BO and
another for £3O, and begging letters poured
in.” None of the prize-winners has given
anything to a stranger, so far as I have
been able to learn, and for a very good
reason; no stranger gave them anything
when they needed it most. The logical per-
son to beg from is not an embittered ex-
pauper, who, even if the £5OOO which has
been won with a ticket in his name isn’t
syndicated, has only an income a little better
than the basic wage from his new capital,
but a millionaire, preferably one who
has inherited his fortune. On this reasoning,
when Peevers, who sometimes does half a
day in my garden, connected with £lOOO I
drafted the following for him. It was
handed to those who called, and posted to
those who wrote :
Dear Sir/or Madam, —I regret that I cannot give
you part of my prize money ; it is all I have. Let
me urge you to write to or insist on seeing Mr.
Blank (a well-known millionaire). His annual
income is many times greater than my prize, and,
as he has never known want, you may be sure he
will not be niggardly. Just approach him frankly,
confidently, as you did me, state your requirements
( £5O, £lOO or whatever it may be) and I am sure
you will not be disappointed. You are at liberty
to mention my name. —Yours, etc.
An alternative gambit, is for the prize-
winner to put Labor beggars on to great-
hearted Jack Lang, the widows’ friend, and
recommend U.A.P. ones to Stevens. I usu-
ally give street mendicants the name and
address of a man I know, together with a
warm tribute to his generosity. He once
swindled me out of £5O.

“R.V.”: The other evening Melbourne
Beam receiving station rang the Balkan dis-
tributing station, 30 miles out. The ’phone

Canada passed it on to England, England
spoke to Ballan, and in half a minute a

“Old Q.”: An unidentified individual in
Brisbane has introduced a variation of the
practice of passing of home-made money. He
has turned from crook silver coins to Ameri-
can banknotes, and has got rid of quite a
lot, never forgetting to benefit by the ex-
change. American notes are not familiar
to the average Australian, and this mis-
crcant’s stock-in-trade is said
to be particularly good. The
notes are all for 50 dollars.
It is wefrth remembering that,
the paper in all American
notes is mixed with tiny frag-
ments of red, blue and green
floss silk. These can be easily
spotted on close examination,
and if they are missing it i.s
a certainty the note is a
stumer.

made composition, which, he
averred, would completely
banish all noxious insects and
other household pests. My
wife having purchased one,
the pedlar became conversa-
tional, and informed us that
he came from some distance
away and had never been in
our suburb before. “You must
find it very hard to sell your

“Centurion”: Touching that Bridge cere-
mony sword (B. 13/4/’32). The thrusting
weapon burst upon the British military
world not many years before the trouble with
Fritz. For long before that the British
cavalry, ignoring the tradition of the prize
ring that a straight left will always anti-
cipate a right swing, had succumbed to the
Prussian fetich of the curved sabre. I would
not care to swear how many troop-horses I
have seen denuded of an ear by a well-
meaning mug trying to bring off “cut two.”
Sword drill, in the days of which I talk, was
a complicated weariness of the flesh. With
the thrusting sword, the only difficulty is
to acquire the tiny flick of the wrist which
is the parry for the other man’s weapon
coming at you.

fidently predicted by

Typewriters auto-

the best an operator

dent, and the feats of a first-class sound-

which has worked the present miracle.
THE HARVEST.

“Yes, that’s her favorite crop.”
“Hooch”: My theory about the Lindbergh
baby is that he is dead or too’ ill to be
moved. A child of nearly two years makes
a lot of noise if suddenly removed by stran-
gers from familiar surroundings; more
especially if his old surroundings were
luxurious and his new ones are uncomfort-
able. So the kidnappers would have had
to dope him and keep him doped. A baby
can’t stand much dope even when it is well.
The Lindbergh baby was ailing when taken,
THE GOOD SAMARITAN.
LADY: “Oh, conductor, I cannot pay you. I’ve lost my purse.”
ISAACS: “Dot’s all right, lady. I’ll lend you a shilling on der bag.”
and his kidnappers have been keeping him
in smoke for the best part of two months.
If he was alive and fairly fit his captors
would be glad at this stage to get rid of
him at almost any price; and it is now
known that the Lindberghs are prepared to
pay a fortune. The desirability of deliver-
ing him up safe and sound, arid soon, if
possible, is evident. The Chicago Crime
Commission found that local business men
had paid racketeers £40,000,000 during 1931.
At present Chicago' is bankrupt; the civil
servants aren’t'being paid because the. citi-
zens can’t pay their taxes. And the same
in other U.S.A. cities. Kidnapping is the one
racket which is standing up to the depres-
sion, and, given a fair chance, always will.
Nothing can kill it, human nature and paren-
tal affection being what they are, but
stupidity on the part of baby-stealers.
Americans at the head of milk, fish, ’bus,
fruit and other industries paid huge fees
until this year for “protection” because they
knew the money would produce results. If
the Lindberghs pay a few more £lO,OOO ran-
soms and get no’ satisfaction it will put a
fatal stigma on the kidnapping racket. Con-
trariwise, if by some miracle they do get
their child back uninjured, no U.S.A. baby
with solvent parents will be safe for quite
a while. And I wouldn’t be surprised to
see the racket make its appearance in Aus-
tralia.

“Lex”: Wild beasts in human form like
the murderer of the man and girl at Holds-
worthy as often as not escape. Jack
the Ripper dodged the rope, according to
the police Of the period, because, having no
remorse and no fear, he didn’t give himself
away. Neil Cream committed many mur-
ders before he was caught; he would have
died in an atmosphere of respectability if
he hadn’t had a stroke of bad luck. A mur-
derer is doubling or trebling the danger of
being found out by having an accomplice.
The murderers of Constable Gutteridge
would probably never have been arrested if
both had been as callous as Brown, the
human tiger who shot the dead man’s eyes
out. It was all in the day’s work to him—
an episode to be forgotten as soon as it
was over —but his emotional accessory
couldn’t help talking. Mulcahy, who mur-
dered his wife in Svdney, was like Browm —
too bestial to feel excitement —and, as lie
did the job alone, he got clean away. Ninety
per cent, of murderers become so upset after
the crime that they have to either drop hints
or confide in someo'ne; and their confidants
can never keep their mouths shut.
“Busby”: Last, week Justice Macfarlan
(Vic.) sentenced three ruffians convicted of a
brutal crime to 20 years’ imprisonment
apiece; in addition, 15 strokes of the cat-
o’-nine tails were ordered for each. At least
the Judge said the “cat” ; but it has since
been mentioned that they are in little danger
of anything more drastic than the birch, a
much less dreaded instrument of punish-
ment, which operates on a lower section of
the human frame and leaves no indelible
evidences of its caresses. Very few Judges
sentence criminals to be flogged nowadays
and only then when the crime has revolting
features in it. Even when they do, the
question of what sort of flagellation it will
be seems to depend on the political com-
plexion of the executive. There is hardly
a Labor Government in Australia prepared
to send a murderer to the gallows nowadays,
however foul his crime, and the would-be
murderer, it seems, can just as safely rely
on the lash being tempered to his bare
cuticle if he has been fortunate enough to be
tried in a State where Labor is in office.

“Erua”: Antiques, real or alleged, turn up
periodically in Maoriland. After the Steven-
son piano came a pair of candlesticks, said
to have once belonged to John Wesley, and
at present argument is raging round an old
violin labelled “Antoni Stradivarius.” This
is believed to be genuine, as it was once the
possession of W. Baucke, a German who be-
came an authority on the Maori race, the
violin having been brought from Bavaria by
his father 85 years ago. It was bought for
£3 in an auction-room at Otorohonga by a
local solicitor, and if it pro'ves to be a Mes-
siah model it is worth anything up to £3OOO.
For many years Judge Ward, of Auckland,
kept in a local bank part of the famous
Plumer collection of antiques, which he had
inherited. Of this collection one piece, a

“Aileron”: A flying feat which for some
reason received little or no notice in the
dailies was the final skip, from Queensland
to Noumea, of the three French Army airmen
who recently landed at Darwin. The 800-
mile spin to Noumea was the first of its
kind, and finished off in fine style the long
trip of the trio, under the guidance of Baron
de Verneilh, in their Couzinet monoplane.

“Light Horse”: Did any of the Austra-
lians who had something to do with hoofing
the Unspeakable out of Sinai ever hear
of the Aga Petros Ellour? This gentleman,
whose death is recorded in a recent cable,
is said to have ended his days in a
French chateau, “presented to him by the
British Government in return for his ser-
vices in keeping the Suez Canal free and
open during the war.” Writer had an idea
that the Anzac Mounted Division, whom
General Murray once referred to as “the
keystone of the defence of Egypt,” had some-
thing to do with keeping the ditch open, bur
one never knows. And I am puzzled over •
A. P. Ellour. His front name is Turkish
for a Moslem leader. His second is pure
Greek, and the third is Armenian.

“R. Volt”: The “Age,” which seldom
loses a chance of chipping at the Vic. State
Electricity Commission, complained bitterly
the other day that, in the middle of a ter-
rific thunderstorm, which flooded the lower
part of the city, the power failed, despite a
recent assurance of the S.E.C. that duplica-
tion of supply had practically obviated such
a danger. One of the hardships that resulted
seems to have been that for 20 minutes mov-
ing-picture patrons were thrown on their
own mental resources. But how engineers
would smile at the notion that man-made
things can always rise superior to acts of
God, such as thunderstorms! Some years
ago the recording finger in the Banyuwangi
cable station, Java, began to stick out at
right angles to the tape, and working became
almost impossible. Singapore complained of
the same trouble and inquiry elicited that
Darwin was in the same predicament. A
wire over the land lines to Adelaide brought
the reply that an uncommonly beautiful dis-
play of the Aurora Australis was visible in
the southern sky and that the whole Com-
monwealth system was affected thereby. In
this case an electrical disturbance at the
Tole had made itself felt over a whole hemi-
sphere and a good way on the other side of
the Equator.
BALLADE OF DEAD DIGGERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We like to watch you celebrate
The Day we came against the Turk,
For in our disembodied state
The germs of spleen no longer lurk;
' Still, it is somewhat of a jerk
To see in sentimental mood
Such as once spoke of “Murd’rers’ Work.”
But pardon us if we intrude.
It may be that, disintegrate,
Our gaze can penetrate the murk
And so more shrewdly separate
The inward thought from outward smirk:
We realise such duties irk,
But, then, neglect were somewhat crude,
And gush means place—and place spells
“perk.”
You’ll pardon us if we intrude?
Yet we discern, immaculate,
The mother-love that scorned to shirk
When duty bade her dedicate
Her first-born to Bellona’s dirk;
We see her kneel in some lone kirk
With all his life again reviewed,
His youth, his every childish quirk:
She does not deem that we intrude.
Envoy.
Prince, be you Deity or Fate,
Fo’rget that rancor once bestrewed
The decent earth with fruits of Hate,
Lest we be told that we intrude.

"L. de R.” : The other evening a leading
Melbourne undertaker and his monumental
mason met an acquaintance at a cafe. The
talk turned on superstition, and the acquaint-
ance declared that he was immune from the
failing. He didn’t mind sitting down HI
1,1 a table, accepting a present of peacock's
feathers or walking under ladders; he never
bothered if he spilled salt or broke a looking-
glass, and he would just as soon get married
on a Friday as any other day. At the end
of dinner it turned out that the non-super-
stitious one had to keep an appointment in
another part of the city, past which the
others were going, and the undertaker
offered to drive him there in his motor-car.
The offer was readily accepted, but when
they got downstairs the acquaintance sud-
denly said that he had an acute attack of
indigestion and preferred to walk, although
it was raining heavily. The conveyance was
one of the undertaker’s mourning coaches.

“Bloggs”: The morality campaign of the
Bishop of Quimper, which is said to be ruin-
ing dance-halls right and left in Brittany
(where haunts of fashion such as Dinard
are), and which has led to football matches
being played by men in trousers, reveals a
social phenomenon of which many Austra-
lians ai'e ignorant. The original wowser was
not the lank Metliody divine of Norman
Lindsay’s drawings, but a well-fed priest.
France is by no means the pagan, care-free
land of so many Britishers’ envious imagin-
ings. A few years ago a cinema at Parame,
not far from gay Dinard, was closed down
because the local cure objected to a film of
the “Flaming Youth” type. He ordered his
parishioners to keep away from it, and they
did. Bathing in the semi-nude, drinking,
gambling and their appurtenances go on at
places like Paris-Plage and Deauville, but
most of the revellers are foreigners—chiefly
English, Americans and Germans. The
natives —the opposite numbers socially of
those who surf-bathe with very little on in
Australia —look on such amusements as in-
famous. What would an Australian school-
girl think if she was told to put oil a bath-
ing-dress before having her bath? Thou-
sands of girls at the best French schools are
forbidden to wash in a state of nature.
SPOIL-SPORT.
“Doesn’t that young man you go out with ever mention
marriage to you?”
"No, we find ii spoils things if he thinks of his wife:"
Paris—outside one or two quarters which
are chiefly frequented by foreigners and
those who cater for their amusements —is as
WO’wser-ridden as any other part of France.
A journalistic friend told me that his grown-
up sisters, though they lived with their

martre show, or been inside the Folies-Ber-

place.
‘‘S.T.S.”: Adelaide yachtsmen have had
a nightmare foi-tnight of patrolling the
beaches for the bodies of dead friends. A
sadden Saturday-afternoon squall raked the
gulf shores, alive with craft of all kinds.
A race, oft' Glenelg, was simply wiped out.
After much confused heroism, most of the
men were got to shore. But five were miss-
ing ; two were twin brothers, keen little
sportsmen of 14.

“Framley": Touching the Chatswood
(Sydney) ecclesiastical row (B. 13/4/’32),
I suspect that it is much easier in Australia
than in England to make a cure of souls
impossible for ‘‘an undesired rector.” In
the Old Country the Anglican incumbent’s
stipend is fixed by law. It may come from
church endowments or tithes, or both, but ii
stands as a fixed figure, and has nothing to
do with whether the shepherd is acceptable
to the sheep or not. Clerics have been
appointed by patrons of livings to English
parishes in circumstances that emptied their
churches before they officiated there. They
might conduct services in the presence of no
one except members of their own household
and the parish clerk, but they drew their
pay and couldn’t be removed simply because
their parishioners didn’t happen to like them.
In this country it is quite another pair of
sleeves. One of the St. Barnabas church-
wardens significantly mentioned the other
day that the incumbent was dependent on
the offertories for his stipend, or at all events
for most of it. and that if congregations were
small it would be the same with remunera-
tion. Obviously the unwanted incumbent
has a much harder row to hoe in a Sydney
suburb than in the parsonages of Anthony
Trollope’s Barchester novels.
* ❖ ❖ *
"Mug Electrician”: When the Australian
Standards Association has a few minute's to
spare from its meditations on concrete and
sewerage fittings I want it to have a go at
household electrical appliances. These, with-
out exception, in my experience, have been
constructed more with an eye to providing a
lot of work for repairers than for giving
good service. Take the ordinary iron, for
ironing clothes. I know of
nothing—not even the radio
set next door that beefs out
jazz imbecilities from dawn
till midnight—that causes
more trouble in the average
household. It is so con-
structed that it is bound to
short-circuit inside whenever
it gets a knock, and repairing
the damage, owing to the
cranky arrangement of con-
nections and element, is a
game to which the “pigs-in-
< lover” puzzle of our childhood
was a mere nothing. The
thing could easily be made
fool-proof and standardised
that way. Why isn’t it? An-
other piece of folly was the
changing a few years ago of
the way the pegs in an elec-
tric-light socket impinge on
the base of the lamp. Put a
modern lamp in an old socket,
and it either won’t work or
blows out yo’ur switchboard
fuse. The switchboard is in-
variably stuck at an altitude
where it can only be reached
by a high step-ladder. Why?
If it’s a matter of preventing-
kids fiddling with it, 6ft. is as
good as 12ft. And why are
there 413 different sizes of
plug-in sockets? I know the
plugs are made adjustable, but
adjusting them isn’t easy and
they are bound to work loose.
Why not a standard gauge?
If the notion of the trade is
that the householder is going
to send for an electrician
every time anything goes
wrong the trade is suffering
from a large d. lusion.
“Spectator”: “Umpteenth Guru” (B.
13/4/’32) is right about the “Grunth”
or “Adi Granth” being the sacred book
of the Sikh religion. Curiously enough,
the only copy of the book in Aus-
tralia is at present in the custody of
the Clerk of Courts in our little Victorian
township, the Law Department having
obtained it because a Sikh has to give evi-
dence in a pending case, and he cannot be pro-
perly sworn on anything else. The book
Avas published in a limited edition by the
British Government in 1878, and copies
were sent _to various parts of the Empire.
This one is kept by the Melbourne Public
Library. In the introduction the translator,
a Bavarian, tells of the difficulties he en-
countered, the Sikhs being a nation of war-
riors and having little or no literature of
their own. The Brahms, whose assistance
would have been valuable, are deadly ene-
mies of the Sikhs, and refused to give any
aid. The translation consequently took seven
years.
“H.A.L.”: Erasmus Darwin wasn’t the
only one who thought that canals would pin
a part in the development of Australia (B.
30/3/‘32). When Colonel Light laid out
Adelaide he had a similar notion. The lorn;
AN OPTICAL ALLUSION.
PRIMA DONNA: “In that act I shall wear a costume to match my eyes!"
THEATRICAL REPORTER: “Ah, do I get that right—something you can see through?"
plantation of trees which divides the up
and down tracks on the road between the
city and its port Avas reserved by Light for
a canal, his idea being that by damming the
Torrens and cutting a canal with locks be-
tweeu it and the Port River barges could be
loaded at the ships’ sides and toAved up, to
discharge their freight at a wharf on the
bank of the Torrens. Another erroneous
idea of Light’s Avas that the main traffic
through the city would be from east to west,
so lie gave it plenty of good streets in that
direction and only a few north and south.
P*ut these were but trifling mistakes, fully
atoned for by his marvellous foresight in
other directions. No other Australian capi-
tal has such a boon and blessing as the half-
mile-wide strip of park land which encircles
Adelaide.
“Pantagruel”: A man charged at Fitzroy
(Fie.) the other day with being drunk and
(an additional offence) being drunk on
methylated spirits proffered a novel plea in
extenuation. He said he could afford no
stimulant other than cheap wine, and that
was largely metho. anyhow; he reckoned the
stuff Avas no more harmful and less expen-
sivo taken neat. The argument obviously
made some impression on the Bench, and
the pushed his advantage
by declaring that he had a job at potato-
digging waiting for him at Bungareo and
pledging himself to hit the track immediately
if he were given another chance. He got it,
perhaps the more readily because his cheer-
ful blarney had kept the q6uwthou.se in a
simmer of laughter. The metho.-drinker who
can jest over his failing is a very rare bird
indeed. But the j’ustices didn’t hazard an
opinion as to whether methylated spirits is
really a more deleterious stimulant than
pinkie.
“Caro Mio” : Having
a look at “Lucia di
Lammermoor” in Syd-
ney the other day, I
noticed with approval
that the chorus of High-
landers conformed to
the breekless conven-
tions of their race in
the days in which the
story is said to have
taken place. A rela-
tive who once served in
the NaA 7 y told me a
yarn of a performance
of “Lucia” at Malta in
the early ’sixties. The
II ighl a n d regiment
Avhich is noAV known as
the Argyll and Suther-
lands was in garrison :
these lent their kilts
and other appurten-
ances to the opera co.
It was a good show, but
catastrophe fell upon it
when the chorus filed
on to the stage in its
Highland garb. All the
male section wore the
sporran, like the golden
hair of the lady Marie
Lloyd used to sing
about, “hanging down the back.” That was
a long time ago, but even now the Argyll and
Sutherlands don’t like to be reminded of it.
“Cenis’ : Some of the queerest features
about ( the various Channel Tunnel schemes
(B. 13/4/'32) —I suppose there have been
a dozen, all abortße —concern the estimated
ie wol 'k by private enterprise. In
1890 an eminent French engineer, Bunau
V arilla, outlined liis plans and specifications
tor a mode of communication between Dover
and Calais. Tunnelling was the main item,
and the cost Avas cheerfullv computed at
"not more than £10,000,000”'! The Sydney
Harbor Bridge cost almost exactly that.
But they were sanguine people in those days.
A year later an Englishman of some dis-
tinction, Sir Roper Lethbridge, delivered an
address before the Society of Arts emphasis-
ing the desirability and feasibility of con-
structing a tunnel under the Irish' Channel.
The project rather caught the public imag-
ination as a means of bringing England and
Ireland closer together, but I forget if mis-
estimate of the cost was submitted. I d<>
remember, however, that one of the argu-
ments used was that there would he no possi-
bility of “international complications” about
this scheme, such as did more to kill the Eng-
lish Channel px-oject than anything else.

“Shep”: Touching those new army rifle's
(B. 23/3/’32), the extra seven ounces in
weight will be a disability to set against any
advance in rapid firing. Already the foot-
slogger is carrying all he can, what with a
tin-bat and gas-bag, plus ammunition, bay-
onet, entrenching tool, water-bottle and his
own worldly possessions, including a blanket
in his pack. To a brass-hat half a pound of
added weight is a mere trifle. Apart from
this, how often were faster-firing rifles needed
in France? The only instance I l-ecall was
at Lagnicdurt, where infantry lined the
banks of the sunken roads firing at point-
blank range into a mass of advancing Ger-
mans. If more rapid fire is the objective
let the War Office concentrate on a light-
weight machine-gun, such as gangsters stir
Chicago up with, for the ordinary rank and
file.

ITEMS
Ned Hogan isn’t the first Premier whose
Government was defeated while he was on the
other side of the world, but he is probably
the first to whom the melancholy intelligence
couldn’t be conveyed immediately because
nobody knew his exact address. Twenty years
ago, when Ned earned his living as a union
organiser for the racially-mixed toilers who
supplied the Golden Mile with firewood
—a strenuous figure in flannel and dun-
garees, always spoiling for a fight with
the bloated capitalist—few would have tipped
him as a possibility for a State Premier-
ship. It would have been harder to feature
the ruggedly robust syoung giant of those
days, who looked capable of swinging an
axe or a pick with the best, trying to recup-
erate in Italy while the Government he had
left behind him went to pieces. Hogan is
still in the forties, but the cares of office
have taken heavy toll of him physically.
Sydney’s George Judah Cohen will be 90
on April 27. Samuel Cohen, his father, laid
substantial foundations for the family for-
tune; the son extended it and has a place
all his own in the commercial and financial
life of the city. Samuel Cohen was the first
man married in the old Jewish synagogue in
Druitt-street, and, as was fitting for the
first son born of the marriage. George Judah
has always been a leader of the synagogue.
Hugh McMaster, just dead at 74, was the
owner of station properties around Quirindi
and one of the Ma State’s best-known gra-
ziers. Cattle were his specialty, but among
his sheep was a small flock directly
descended from those imported by William
Lawson from the personal stock of King
George IV. McMaster was for 20 years pre-
sident of Tamorang shire council; his only
son, Wallace, was killed in action in France.
George Houlton Mocatta, who will carry
the Nat.-Prog. banner in the Brisbane elec-
torate, which has been for years a State
pocket borough for Labor, was born in
Cairns 29 years ago. He is a successful
solicitor, and looks after the legal business
of the Queensland Canegrowers’ Association.
In additio'n to grinding the law mill, he has a
dairy farm at Woodford and a tobacco plan-
tation at Maceeba.
Ten of Westralia’s 30 Legislative Council-
lors have to seek re-election every other May,
but there is no scramble for seats, and
this year six have been re-elected unopposed.
Minister Baxter and W. J. Mann are C.P.
men; there are two Nationalists, Jo'e Holmes
and lawyer Nicholson, one lone Laborite
(Gray) and knight John Kirwan, President
of the Council, w T ho schedules himself as an
Independent nowadays. Kirwan and Holmes
are the two old Parliamentary stagers; the
former, who was a member of the first
Houge of Reps., has held his goldfields seat
since 1908, and Holmes, who began his poli-
tical career in the Assembly, was a Minister
for a fleeting period as long ago as 1901.
Percy Deane, who has been rather sum-
marily deposed from the headship of the re-
named Home Affairs Department, was a
journalist before the war. He enlisted among
the earliest; W. M. Hughes took a fancy
to him when he was serving with the A.I.F.
in Egypt, and made him his personal secre-
tary, afterwards getting Deane a permanent
appointment as secretary to the Prime Min-
ister’s Department. Hughes liked a man who
wasn’t afraid to talk back to him ; but this
sort of forthrightness didn’t commend itself

morning and found himself no longer

to Stanley Bruce, {ftid it was only because
he was a very capable officer that Deane
weathered several early storms. He was
transferred to the Home Affairs Department
in the last years of the Bruce-Page Govern-
ment. Deane, who is 41, has accompanied
Australian delegations to several Imperial
Conferences; he was co-author with knight
James Barrett of “The A.A.M.C. in Egypt.”
Tunnecliffe, who will lead the
Vic. Labor forces to' defeat at the elec-
tions, is 61 years of age, and has
been in Parliament, with a break or two,
since 1903. He was an M.L.A. for West
Melbourne before his future chief, Hogan,
was old enough to have a vote; later he
represented Eaglehawk for 13 years, and
Collingwood has stuck to him since 1921.
His first taste of office was obtained as Chief
Secretary in the Prendergast Ministry of
1924. A bootmaker by trade, he has dabbled
in journalism of later years; he was editor
of that mucli-buffeted publication “Stead’s
Review” from 1925 to 1927. Steiglitz, near
Ballarat, is his birthplace.
One of the Privy Council Judges who are
grappling with the problem of whether the
N.S.W. Leg. Council shall continue to exist
is an Australian by birth. This is the Right
Hon. James Atkin, Baron of Aberdovey, who
was born in Queensland, where his father,
Robert Atkin, was an M.L.A., in 1867. His
first wife was a Queenslander, too; her
father, William Ilemmant, was Treasurer
in the Macalister Ministry (’74- <6).
The judicial baron was educated in
Wales and at Oxford ; he became a K.C. m
1906, a Judge of the High Court m 1913
and a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1928.
Philip Henry Morton, who died in Sydney
last week, sat in the Assembly for Shoal-
liaven from 1889 to 1898, and he was also
a city alderman last century. Banking was
his main business; he began as a lad with
the Commercial, of Sydney, and rose to be
chairman of directors of the old A.J.S.,
which he helped to put on an even
keel again after the 1893 disaster. Be-
sides his commercial and political activities.
Philip Morton found time for some useful
public work; he was a trustee of the Ait
Gallery and a member of the council of the
Royal Agricultural Society. A yo'unger
brother, Mark, won back the Slioalliaven
seat three years after Philip had lost
it, and still remains an M.L.A. —one of the
oldest. A third brother, 11. D. Morton, re-
presented Hastings and Macleay for several
terms.

the British Navy in Jamaica and with the
army in Abyssinia and Afghanistan long ago.

four grand-opera seasons and innumer-
able concert artists for the Williamson
firm, and still has his hair on.
N.S.W. metropolitan postal inspector
Fergus Hunter has been placed in charge of
the Cairns (Q.) district. Hunter entered the
service at Alstonville (N.S.W.) at 13. and
at 16 was the youngest telegraphist in it, at
Walgett, He was postmaster at half a dozen
places before the authorities gummed him on
to Sydney’s G.P.O. as inspector. His new
charge has an area of 600 by 400 miles, and
includes Thirsty Island and much of the
Gulf scrub. In his spare time he is a fervent
lay preacher.
The death of G. A. Jury would have meant
a lot in Adelaide commercial circles any
time up to 15 years ago, when he was a
leading light in the G. and R. Wills Co.;
but after losing a son in France he fell
into a settled melancholy, and lived (till
80) in retirement. The English Literature
chair at Adelaide Uni. —of which the late
Archibald Strong has been the only holder —
was founded in his name by his family.
Sydney has lost a well-liked ecclesi-
astic in Gerard D’Arcy-Irvine, Bishop
Coadjutor. Born in London nearly 70 years
ago, the son of Canon D’Arcy-Irvine, some-
time of Goulburn (N.S.W.), he was edu-
cated in Maoriland and at the Moore Theo-
logical College. Sydney, and ordained by
Bishop Barry in 1885. He held many re-
sponsible appointments in the Church where
he became such a prominent figure before
becoming Chaplain to the Archbishop of
Sydney (1910), Vicar-General (1917),
Bishop Coadjutor (1926) and Rector of St.
Phillip’s a year later. A strenuous parish
worker, a vigorous preacher and (when
need arose) an incisive controversialist, he
made his influence widely felt. He found
time for lighter work too, including a
volume of poems published over 20 years ago.
He was twice married, and leaves a widow,
a daughter of the late W. T. Angus; two
sons served in the war. A younger brother,
Malcolm, is a barrister in the Crown Law
Department.
George David Parker, just dead at Crook-
well (N.S.W.), aged 90, had been a resident
since he retired from the N.S.W. police force
50 years ago. He was on duty in Bathurst
the morning that the bushranger John Vane,
accompanied by Father McCarthy, rode in
and surrendered. He was also one of the
troopers who took part in the last hunt for
Ben Hall.
Don Cameron, the president of the Vic-
torian Labor party, whose “instructions
that Labor members must oppose the Pre-
miers’ plan led to the Hogan Govern-
ment being defeated, started his. politico-
industrial career, like Hogan, in West-

ralia. Don’s sphere of activity was
Perth, where the most notable .speech he
ever made, as far as the immediate results
to himself were concerned, was on the Espla-
nade (Perth’s field for soapbox oratory) on
a Sunday afternoon in war-time. The crowd
resented some of his remarks, and charged
his box. He was pursued up the street,
and it might have gone hard with him
had not the doors of the exclusive Weld
Club happened to be open. The fugitive took
refuge there, and a pampered (and pitying)
menial indicated a huge meatsafe, into which
Don climbed and where he remained until
the angry crowd had dispersed. Yet, pacifist
as he became, he was one of the Australian
contingenters who helped to “hammer Paul.”
It is rather curious that Don and Ned,
former pillars of unionism in Westralia,
should ultimately have become the central
figures in differences that look like wrecking
the Victorian Labor Parliamentary party at
the polls next month.
Leslie James Milson, of Cardross station,
near Goulburn (N.S.W.), dead at 70, was
one of a family whose foundations go far
back into Australian history. The first
Milson settled in Sydney in 1804 and
obtained a grant of land on the North
Shore; he left his name on Milson’s Point.
The deceased pastoralist was widely known
for his keen interest in. every movement
for the improvement of Australian wool; he
was a director of the pastoral company of
J. and R. K. Milson.
Donald MacKinnon, formerly Vic. Attor-
ney-General and Australian High Commis-
sioner in U.S.A., who is in his 73rd year,
is taking a couple of weeks’ rest in a pri-
vate hospital under medical advice. It is
nearly 50 years since he was called to .the
English Bar —he was admitted in Victoria
a year later, and 42 years since he assisted
Higinbotham, then C.J., to consolidate the
Victorian statutes. If Mac had been a
struggling lawyer instead of a prosperous
grazier he might very well have been occupy-
ing the position Irvine now holds. lor 2U
years he sat in Vic. Assembly.
Laurie Chapman, who, at 41, has bagg;ed
the job of permanent head of Vic. Crnei
Sec.’s Department, gained the goodwill ot
successive Ministers by hard work. lietne-
ments of elderly officers helped him to secure
the chief clerkship two years ago, and he
goes to the topmost place at an unusually
early age.
“S.J.W.”: A recent paragraph credited
Thomas Smart, who died at _ 90 in S.
Aus., with being the last survivor of the
party that built the overland telegraph line
from Darwin to Adelaide. Not quite. Thomas
Parsons, another of the party, who lives in
the same S. Aus. township as myscJ, is
still on deck at 86.
“Jobber”: “W.D.” in his par. re “Hors-
ley,” while putting a previous paragraphist
right as to the builder of “Horsley” (B.
6/4/’32), lias slipped a little himself. I
have by me a copy of the Weston pedigree,
wherein it is stated that “Captain George
Edward Nicholas Weston settled in N.S.W.,
and married Blanche, daughter of Colonel
George Johnston.” There is no mention
of this being Captain Weston’s second mar-
riage, and although he died many years
before my birth I have never heard the
matter mentioned by any of the family. And
“Horsley” was named after the birthplace
of Captain Weston, West Horsley, which is
in Surrey, not Kent.
Justice Angas Parsons, who sat on the
S. Aus. Criminal Court case which arose out
•of the brushes between “loyalist” wharfies
and unionists at Port Adelaide, is a great-
grandson of the philanthropist George Fife
Angas, one of the founders of S. Aus. His
father was John Langdon Parsons, sometime
Government Resident of the Northern Terri-
tory, and the son has inherited the father's
oratorical gifts—he is one of the best after-
dinner speakers in Australia. His Honor,
who will be 60 on May 23, was called to
Justice AN GAS PARSONS, who congratu-
lated, an Adelaide jury on its acquittal
of an Italian charged with unlawfully
wounding, and said there were circum-
stances in which an attacked person
might “lawfully use a knife.”
the Bar in 1897, took silk in 1916 and was
Attorney-General and Minister for Educa-
tion under the late Peake. He married the
eldest daughter of veteran journalist Lang-
don Bonython, and their son Geoffrey is a
barrister.

The Actuary completed his last triennial
valuation of the liabilities under policies at
Dec. 31. There was a sharp drop of over
£41,000 in the amount available for distribu-
tion amongst policy-holders and shareholders,
as the following table shows: —
Valuation Surpluses.
1922. 1925. 1928. 1931.
Ordinary .. .. £26,633 £40,093 £65,689 £25,779
Industrial . . . . 6,223 19,300 21,191 19,700
Total . . . . £32,856 £59,393 £86,880 £45,479
But bonuses have been maintained at the
old rates, though whether these were not
previously too low is another question.
In the Ordinary branch they range from
1.5 p.c. on policies under five years in
force to £3 p.c. on those 20 years old or
more; on Industrial contracts 10 p.c. has
been added to the sum assured where poli-
cies have been on the books for 15 years,
with an extra. 1 p.c. for each additional year.
Also, policy-holders have more protection than
hitherto; hence there is no need to worry
over the slip in the figures, which was due
entirely to provision for contingencies and
the strengthening of the basis of valuation.
Since the close of accounts in 1929, £35,000
has been added to the investment fluctua-
tion reserve (now £70,000) and £lO,OOO net
has been set aside to guard against a reduc-
tion of bonuses on Ordinary policies. Also,
an extra £33,364 was added to the fund on
account of the stricter valuation in each
section. The book value of net tang-
ibles at Dec. 31 exceeded aggregate liabili-
ties under policies by over £183,000.
The office now assumes that the amount
reserved to cover liabilities under Ordinary
with-profits contracts, which account for
over 91 p.c. of the sum assured in that sec-
tion, will net only 3 p.c. as against 31 p.c.
previously. The idea is to provide for pay-
ment of better bonuses in the future.
Last year the co. shared in the general
experience, of course. There was a sharp
drop of £115,581 in the amount of new
Ordinary business written :
1920. 1929. 1930. 1931.
New policies. . 1,226 1,911 1,442 1,009
Assuring . . £186,988 £476,786 £314,368 £198,787
First premiums 7,349 15,024 10,170 5,032
Renewal
premiums .. 23,225 62,343 68,315 68,545
A tight hold was kept upon exes., which,
leaving taxes out of the reckoning, took 19.2
p.c. of the year’s net premiums as against
22.3 p.c. and 25.7 p.c. in 1930 and 1929
respectively. But surrenders lifted new busi-
ness costs to 123.5 p.c. as against 103.1 p.c.
in 1930; that is assuming that new busi-
ness is 10 times more expensive than old.
The amount of new Industrial business
put on the books was £200,060 lighter than
the 1930 figure:—
1920. 1929. 1930. 1931.
Policies . . 11,771 13,511 12,133 8,381
Assuring . . £505,638 £661,230 £541,435 £341,375
Net premiums 65,655 143,646 143,246 134,185
Interest, etc.. . 27,525 28,108 26,462
Again excluding taxes, exes, made off with
44.7 p.c. of the net premiums compared with
48 p.c. and 48.9 p.c. for the two preceding-
years.
After deducting taxes, the year’s net in-
terest return was 4.4 p.c. on the mean fund
as against 5.6 p.c.. 1930; 5.9 p.c., 1929. The
contraction was the result of taxation and
of legislative cuts in interest rates Except-
ing the with-profits policies already referred
to, the office assumes that the fund will net
34 p.c.
The protection for policy-holders was in
this form :
1930. 1931.
Freeholds, etc. £211,235 19.0 p.c. £210,615 17.9 p.c.
Govt, securities 420,624 37.8 ~ 466,980 39.5 „

Book debts .. 43,824 3.9 „ 40,819 3.5
Cash . . . . 13,874 1.2 „ 20,288 1.7 „
The £69,296 added to the assurance fund last
year went mainly into Consols, which are
free of State taxes, and loans on policies.
Over the last three years shareholders have
received £38,958 in divs., an average of
25.9 p.c. p.a., of which 15 p.c. came from
the Industrial and the balance from the
Ordinarv branch. Profits in this last-named
section belong 80 p.c. to policy-holders and
20 p.c. to shareholders, who are also en-
titled to what is left in the Industrial sec-
tion after providing for liabilities under
policies and bonuses.
Perkins and Co. (Q.)
It used to be a money-spinner. But the gift-
giving was overdone —£222,222 of the £378,966
of paid capital represents bonus scrip, scat-
tered during the five years to the close of
accounts in 1920 —-the co. lost its grip on
the trade, and then plunged into debt in an
effort to revive turnover. Results were dis-
couraging ; so, in July, 1928, the brewery
plant and the trade of the hotels passed to
Castlemaine and Quinlan, Gray and Co.,
which thereupon changed its named to Castle-
maine Perkins, Ltd.
The vendor, which got 160,000 shares
(face value 12s. 6d.), priced at 155., and
later took up another 40,000 at par, w r rote
tip the book value of freeholds by £111,560
to cover the loss on plant, etc. Then, to
wipe out the overdraft and lighten remain-
ing burden, half the holding in Castlemaine
Perkins was sold at 18s. a share, together
with half a dozen of the freeholds and some
leases. On paper, things began to look better,
as the following table shows :—-
1929. 1930. 1931. 1932.
Debtors .. £139,448 £129,135 £54,487 £47,692

Liquid surplus £16,646
Excess
liabilities . . £194,050 £59,468 £54,515
But. on more careful examination many old
customers’ balances were found to be bad
debts, and £84,932 was struck off on that
account a year ago; hence the excess of
liabilities over more or less liquids again.
Secured creditors, largely the Biggses,
figured for £85,056 at the end of February
last.
For the 12 months to that date rents,
etc. (£15,074), were £3IS lighter and divs.
(£5000) fell away £1562. Exes., including
£4104 for bad debts and £6791 for depre-
ciation, made off with the lot and
£4070 besides. Thus £BO,-823 of the capi-
tal was unrepresented by tangible assets
in the books when they last closed.
There appears to be little prospect of any-
thing worth mentioning in the way of divs.
What shareholders are likely to salvage from
the wreck will depend largely upon what
the fixed assets realise, when they can he
sold. Freeholds appear at £214,970 net;
the old brewery premises in Mary-street and
some leases, £68,984: shares.. £62,704. The
shareholdings consist chiefly of 100.000
shares in Castlemaine Perkins, worth 15s.
6d. each on the market last week-end. The
auditors report that only 40,000 of these
shares were registered in the co.’s name, the
other 60,000 having been transferred to' T.
W. Biggs, who states that he holds them as
mortgagee. The auditors add, “We have
been unable to find a record in the minute-
book of the co. recording this transfer,
although it is noted that the certificate for
these shares was held by Mr. Biggs as secu-
rity for advances made.” Much, of course,
depends upon the terms of the mortgage.
The market prices the fully-paid pound
shares at 45., thus discounting the net. book
value of tangible assets by over 15s. in the
pound.

The difficulties associated witli the adminis-
tration of assets these days, including com-
plications arising from taxation and other
legislation, can be expected to bring more
business into the care of the trustee cos. On
the other hand, their corpus and other earn-
ings have suffered severely from the fall'in’
values and from statutory cuts in interest
and rents, while moratorium legislation and
the lifeless state of the property market have
delayed the winding up of many estates.

The co. does not disclose the volume of trusts
o'n the books. The obvious difficulty has
been to get the cost of handling the business
back in proportion to the fall in gross earn-
ings. Though exes., including £2OOO set
aside for taxation, wore reduced £3106 last
year, they made off with an extra £4 16s.
of each £lOO of income. Thus the net result
was 7.3 p.c. on capital as against 11.6 -p.c.
for the previous year, and points were
chipped off the div., reducing it to 64 p.c.,
the final being at the rate of 7 p.c. p.a. How-
ever, the transfer of £37,500 from reserves
to capital during the last dozen years makes
64 p.c. worth 8.9 p.c. to old holders. To
pay 7 p.c. on capital as it now stands, the
co.’s own funds (capital and reserves com-
bined) need net only 4.7 p.c. And that is
leaving out of the reckoning whatever profits
there may be from the trust business, the
volume of which can be expected to grow.
Here are balance-sheet figures:—

years. Public securities are in at net market
price at balancing date.
The shares are 50s. paid to 275. Gd.; all
but 2s. Gd. of the remaining 225. Gd. is a
reserve liability callable only in the event of
liquidation. They fetch BGs. or thereabouts
on the market as against 41s. a year ago. At
365., the return is 5.3 p.c. on a 7 p.c. div.
basis. The backing amounts to 40s. in net
tangibles.

Despite slump, more customers were served
during the 12 months covered by the latest
accounts; but they had much Less money
in their pockets. Prices continued to ease
(the gain to customers was largely offset by
the sales tax); the tariff, exchange and
primage lifted the landed cost of im-
ports ; political developments made trading
vastly more difficult, and Governments took
a larger slice of merchants’ narrowed mar-
gins. Amongst other things, this fill meant
closer study of family budgets, shrewd buy-
ing and a quick clearance of stocks, as well
as a careful overhaul of every outlet if
satisfactory results were to be sho'wn.
The year’s gross earnings (£152,524) fell
away £39,508, making the drop £102,198 over
the last two years. Exes. (£334,487, includ-
ing £B5OO set aside for taxation as against
£15,000 at the previous balance) were pulled
bade £31,634; thus, after handing the profs,
their £BOO, there was enough to show 7.1
p.c. on the £242,272 of ord. capital compared
with 10.3, 20.8, 25.5, 26.2 and 22 p.c. back
to 1027. Three points were knocked off the
div., reducing It to 7 p.c.; a steady 15 p.c.
had been paid for the four years to the close
of accounts in 1930.
There are signs, however, that earnings
may have touched their lowest level. The
co., which does a lively turnover, buys and
sells largely on a cash basis ; and now that
prices have steadied somewhat (they still
lack strength), sto’cks should become less
troublesome. But the trend of legislation
and the acute political and social tension
in N. S. Wales, added to uncertainty about
exchange and other matters, continue to
delay the return of confidence and obscure
the outlook.
The quick development of the business over
the last seven years, how the growth has
been financed, and other things, are seen in
this next comparison of balance-sheet figures :

Last year’s spring of £11,686 in the book
value of fixed assets was due to the equip-
ment of a new cafeteria. Thus far results
are- said to have fully justified the expendi-
ture, which was met by a reduction of stocks,
the book value of which was £22,945 lighter
than at the previous balance. The contrac-
tion in the more or less liquid surplus

This co., which has an able management and
a highly efficient plant, used to be a steady
10 per center, with a bit extra in the fattest
years. It struck trouble because the Gov-
ernment failed to give the support prom-
ised. The Clyde works, where heavy equip-
ment for the manufacture of turbo-alterna-
tors was installed at a cost of over £BOO,OOO
in 1921, were revalued on a 10 p.c. basis
at £75,000 in 1928. To balance the books
£40:000 of reserves, were rubbed out . and
7s. 9d. was struck off each £1 share. The
working capital released by closing, down the
plant enabled the debenture debt (£33,400)
to bo paid off and 2s. 3d. per share to be
returned in cash. Capital was thus cut in
halves, reducing it to £184,910.
After that two of the subsidiaries, Wey-
mouth’s and McCulla’s, went into liquida-
tion. Little was rescued from McCulla’s,
hut Weymouth's paid 30s. per share. The
money, together with whatever became avail-
able through- reductions in the hook value of
stocks and debtors’ balances, was invested in
Wilson and Co.’s 7 p.c. preferreds, bought
in Now York at less than 50 dollars per 100-
dollar share. The securities were trans-
ferred to a now subsidiary, Stanways, Ltd.,
registered in the F.M.S. with a paid capita!
of £61,G37. The parent then returned
6s. Bd. per share in Stanway scrip or cash
at the option of its shareholders, reducing
paid capital to £123.273 in shares of 13s. 4d.
each at March 31 last.
For the 12 months to that date trading
resulted in a loss of £4IGB; and it is diffi-
cult to say when anything worth mention-
ing in the way of profits is likely to re-
emerge. Earnings now depend mainly upon
the manufacture of electric-transformers and
switch-gear and divs. on the co.’s holdings
in Lift Inspection and Insurance and Stan-
ways—these holdings figure in the books at
£7042 net (£20,000 less cash loan, £12,058)
and £15,080 respectively. There is little
work in hand, Victoria can manufacture
more cheaply, and contracts are scarce.
There is nothing about the co.’s finances
to cause anxiety :

Wilson and Co., Inc.
This is the third-largest meat-packing con-
cern in the U.S.A., ranking next after
Armour’s and Swift’s. Paid capital is
$47,140,505, of which $26,524,800 carries a
fixed cumulative 7 p.c. (=51,856,736 p.a.).
The business is said to be highly speculative,
and is reported to have netted as much as
two million dollars in a single month. For
the 12 months to Oct. 31 last a loss of
$2,017,155 showed up, due mainly to falling-
prices and exchange difficulties, and no pref.
or other divs. were paid. This loss was pre-
coded by profits of $2,542,656, 1930:
$2,304,592, 1929; $2,202,876, 1928. Thus
there lias not been a very wide margin over
pref. requirements. Improvement is re-
ported since the close of last accounts, but
owing to unsettled conditions in the U.S.A.
and S. America the current year’s result is
very uncertain.
At Oct. 31 last there was $3,192,141 com-
ing to trade creditors, and $21,161,211 _to
mortgagees. More or less liquids, including
stocks ($14,833,941), totalled $34,624,041;
fixed assets figured at $52,030,592.
Stairways own a little over otic-fiftieth of
the pref. capital. Thus, at the current rate
of exchange, 7 p.c. on this holding would
enable Stairways to show approximately 20
p.c. on its own share capital in terms of Aus-
tralian currency.

The business of this produce, agency and
carrying concern is well scattered through
the back country of Vic. and N. S. Wales.
The last two lines of the table record the
co.’s worst experience since the financial
blizzard of the ’nineties. During the decade
to the close of accounts in 1929 divs. aver-
aged 11.5 p.c.; and besides getting in
£106,250 of fresh share capital the board
leant heavily upon outsiders in order to
finance clients and carry more merchandising
stocks. Then low prices for our staples and
keener competition for the better class
accounts reduced turnover and made the
debts problem perplexing. Hence, owing to
reduction of stocks on a falling market and
special provision for bad and doubtful debts,
losses instead of profits have shown up.
After striking off £8563 for bad debts, last
year’s gross earnings (£54,881) fell away
£21,240, making the slip 58 p.c. over the last
two years. Exes. (£56,751) were got back
£22,118, reducing the net loss to £lB7O. That
was before reserves were tapped for £5OOO
to provide against doubtful debts and for
£9lB for the staff fund. The shrinkage in
the lay-by over the last two years is £16,773.
For the 12 mouths to the close of accounts
in 1930 the profit was 11.4 p.c. on capital
compared with 12.6. 17.6, 20.1, 18.9 and
25.1 p.c. hack to 1925, when wool and wheat
were fetching top prices, and the business of
Broadbent Bros., in western Vic. and the
Malleo, was taken over.

Mamaku Forests, Ltd.
This forestry co. differs from many other
so-called forestry ventures inasmuch as it
is actually in the forestry business itselt.
That is to say, shareholders’ prospects de-
pend upon the net result of the sale of forest
products, not upon the sale of bonds or upon
commission earning ou work undertaken on
bondholders’ account. The co.’s forests con-
sist principally of Californian redwoods, with
a small percentage of Pinus msigms.
Formed in October, 1924, the co. emerged
from the same stable as Pacific B orests,
Ltd.; in fact, it was originally intended that,
the Mamaku property would be developed
by the Pacific co., but it was finally decided
that a separate co. would be more econo-
mical. , „ r
The co. owns 4833 acres on the Mamaku
plateau, near Rotorua (M.L.). The cost to
date, with buildings and improvements,
appears to have been slightly more than lo
an acre. To Dec. 18, 1931, 75.950 shares
had been sold, and on these £59,453 had
been paid up. On the land £9500 was
still coining to the mortgagee, and sun-
dry creditors figured for £lB4 Land
and buildings appear at £23,800, and
expenditure on the plantation (3368 acres)
totalled £14,549. Brokerage at 10 p.c..
travelling exes., interest, salaries and
general exes, for the seven years have been
capitalised at £28,544. Leaving brokerage
out, the average expenditure under this head
has been £2993 p.a.; last year’s outlay was
£2444, and it should continue to grow less.
Tools, fittings, etc., figure at £375, there is
£726 of preliminary exes., and £3931 in cash.
The ultimate cost of growing an acre of
timber is put at £2O. Pulping and sales are
expected to commence in 1939, and, provided
£4OO an acre is realised for the timber, divs.
of 100 p.c. p.a. are spoken of. All that, of
course, is in the lap of the gods which con-
trol markets and prices. The directors
report satisfactory growth of the forests to
date, and shareholders appear to be getting a
fair run for their money.
To see the programme to the harvesting
stage there is £16,497 of capital at call. As
shares are sold it is intended to acquire and
plant additional areas, with the ultimate
aim of controlling 10,000 acres. But, owing
to the times, only 2620 new shares were
placed last year.
One possible result of the Premiers’ con-
ference is the reopening of Mt. Morgan.
Managing-director R. T. Thompson told Pre-
mier Moore that only £40,000 would be
needed to place up to 400 men in direct em-
ployment within six months, and that the
mine could show a profit of over £44,000 p.a.
when work was in full blast. The cost of
putting the plant in a condition to treat
3000 tons of ore per week is figured at
£36,610, of which £lB,OOO is for wages. Gold
production is estimated at 36,0000 z. p.a. If
granted, the loan is to be repaid out of
profits before any distribution is made to
shareholders. A. A. Boyd, whose career has
been bound up with the once-great mine,
figures that eight million tons of ore, worth
£14,300,000 with gold at £5 Bs. 9d. per
ounce and copper at £43 per toll, still re-
main—fine gold was £5 9s. 9d. and the
spot price of copper £3O Bs. 9d. last week-
end. When the mine closed down it was
costing the co. 255. per ton more to treat
the ore than it was worth. It is now pos-
sible to save ISs. per ton, mainly by quarry-
ing instead of mining the ore as previously.
Additional employment could be provided if
the ore quarried at Mt. Chalmers were sent
to Mt. Morgan for treatment. A strong
committee of Mt. Morgan and Rockhampton
residents has been formed to foster the pro-
ject, which deserves success.
Operations at the Electrolytic Refining
and Smelting Co.’s plant at Port Kembla are
on a much reduced scale, only about 100 men
being employed. The co., which is now con-
trolled by the Broken Hill Associated Smel-
ters, receives about 900 tons cathode elec-
trolytic copper per month from Mt. Lyell,
and melts it into wire-bar shapes for the
Metal Manufacturers Co. operating near by.
The E. R. and S. also treats the Mt. Lyell
anode mud (the residue from the electrolytic
refining of blister copper), and recovers
therefrom about 30oz. fine gold per ton of
mud. A copper-smelting campaign is under-
taken periodically, but, because of cheaper
freight, Queensland copper gougcrs, the
main suppliers, now send their ore to Chilla-
goe. Antimonial slag from Port Pirie is
also treated at Kembla to give “hard” or
corrosive lead.
Mt. Lyell’s output of copper for the quar-
ter to the end of March was 2716 tons,
which is about 600 tons below plant capacity
(13,000 tons p.a.). The average grade of
ore dropped to 3.3 p.c. copper, due to the in-
clusion of low-grade stuff from the Crown
Lyell, Royal Tharsis and Comstock mines.
These mines are being developed for large
outputs when the rich North Lyell lodes
are exhausted. The output of gold for the
quarter was 1181 oz., the highest for several
years.

“Hg.”: Queensland Quicksilver Develop-
ment Co., formed in 1930 with a capital of
£6OOO to work mercury deposits near Kil-
kivan, 40 miles from Maryborough, success-
fully started up its four retort distillation
plants in March. In other days shoots carry-
ing 0.2 p.c. to 5 p.c. mercury proved unprofit-
able. Locally mercury is now worth about
£l9 per flask of 761 b. On this basis an ore
yielding 0.5 p.c. mercury would be worth
555. per long ton. Most of the world’s
quicksilver comes from ores assaying 1 p.c.
mercury. The principal mines are at
Almaden, in Spain, and at Idria, in Italy.

During 1931 Waihi, the principal gold pro-
ducer in Maoriland, recovered 75,3480 z. fine
gold and 434,4780 z. silver from the 223,722
tons of stone treated. The yield and grade
of ore show a slight falling off, but 3000 tons
more ore was crushed than in 1930. The
increased price of gold enabled the company
to profitably treat lower-grade ore, thus
maintaining ore reserves at about 360,000
tons. Waihi has produced 17 million pounds’
worth of gold and silver during its 44 years’
existence, and has distributed six million
pounds in dividends. It looks good for many
years yet.

The Mararoa Co. has offered Morton
Webber, the Scotsman from New York, a
2J years’ option over its leases at Reedys
(W.A.). The optionee has until June 11
to decide: if he accepts, which is by no means
certain, he will be obliged to spend £75,000
on development and equipment, and to take
over a debt of £3OOO to the State Govern-
ment for boring. The purchase consideration
is £50,000 cash or a 25 p.c. fully-paid share
interest in any co. formed to work the pro-
perty. The said share interest may be bought
by the optionee at a discount of 7 p.c. p.a.
oil its face value during the period of the
option. Two representatives of the United
Verde Co. of New York have looked at the
show; much depends on their verdict.
* * * *
Kalgoorlie in its younger days was noted
the world over for its rich telluride ores.
It has been the falling off of the telluride
minerals in depth that has been the main
cause of the drop in grade. Telluride occurs
chiefly in veins and patches; the veins
normally run across the lode. In all, 10
different varieties of telluride, containing
gold and silver alloyed with tellurium and
other metals, have been found along the
Golden Mile; a greater number than is re-
ported from any other single locality through-
out the world.

At Great Boulder, Kalgoorlie, the low-
grade lode at the 1650 ft. and 1800 ft. levels
shows increased width and values up to
26dwt. per ton. A trial parcel of 65 tons
from both levels assayed lOdwt. This lode,
which occurs on the east side of the Great
Boulder lease, was located by diamond drill-
ing through the dyke-slate belt into quartz-
greenstone.
* * *
North Kalgurli development is being car-
ried out on all levels in ore well above the
average, and to hasten matters a second
shift is to’ be started. On the 122 ft. level
rising and driving is in 13dwt. ore - on the
366 ft. ore being stoped assays lldwt.; at
600 ft. a winze has been in lOdwt. ore; at
700 ft. stoping shows stone up to 21dwt.
Boulder Perseverance’s gross profit for
1931 is estimated at approximately £60,000 •
but all this and more has probably been
mopped up by new plant, development,
administration and other costs. Returns
from the new bro'mo.-cyanide treatment
plant are expected to hasten the resumption
of divs. This plant, which is scheduled to
start up in June, is expected to reduce treat-
ment costs to 10s. a ton.

Kimberley .Options, Edjudina (W.A.). is
trying hard to confound its critics. Two
years ago, after the shares had risen from
a few pence to over 15s. in the market, the
show was condemned by Government officials
and Adelaide experts. Since then 1000 tons
of stone has yielded over 30dwt. per ton, and
a further 300 tons is to be treated presently.
The bottom workings are said to look all
right.

At Coolgardie (W.A.) Yicova, Ltd., an
Adelaide concern, is prospecting a promising
area containing six parallel lodes with a
maximum width of lift. On a near-by
northern area a shaft is being sunk on a
lode 14ft. wide assaying 6dwt. The co. has
optioned the Big Blow’s dump, which assays
4.Bdwt. per ton.

The Paringa Mine, adjacent to the North
Kalgurli, is to be reopened by Paringa
Mining and Exploration, Ltd. The main
shaft is down 1300 ft., and three lodes have
been proved. The North Kalgurli has offered
to crosscut from its own lease to intersect
these lodes.

“O.B.”: The report of new gold finds at
Bulong (W.A.) revives memories. I was
there in ’95, when the place was known as
the lOU. Everybody whooped about pros-
Eects, and many unearthed slugs, while store-

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Any information concerning Kopah Tin?
Prospects, etc. f<—932o.
It is a Melbourne float, formed in 1926 as
an offshoot of Siamese Concessions. At July
31 last paid capital was £176,534, of which
£12,000 was in 10 p.c. cum. prefs. There
was then £ll9l coming to creditors and
£4025 to the prefs. Cash figured at £588:
sundry debtors, stores, forfeited share trust,
etc., £9475; dredge and plant, £61.613; mine,
£74,797; preliminary exes., £31,251. The co.
holds 501 acres under lease from the Siamese
Government; original 300 acres were bored
to go 9oz. t.o. per yard. The dredge, nominal
capacity 130,000 c.y. per month, began full-
time work on April 3, 1931, but jigs were
not satisfactorily adjusted until nearly a
month later. The output for April was
nine tons t.o. from 73,000 c.y,, an average
of ,271 b. per yard, worth about I.Bd. per yard
with tin at £llO London. Costs were not
stated, but the dredge closed down in May
last owing to the low price of the metal.
To provide for lease rents, insurance, care-
taking charges, etc. (estimated at £9O per
month), until the price of tin improves, it is
proposed to lift the face value of the scrip
from 20s. to 255. per share. With tin at
£l5O London, the ground at bore values
would be worth approximately 5.2 d. per yard.
The co. will be fortunate if it can get costs
below that figure.

BRIEF ANSWERS.
A.W.B. (Broken Hill): Answered B. 27/l/’32.
One of the best goldmining specs J.H.W.: Not a
good time to sell. Brokerage on Sydney ’Change
for shares realising between 15s. and 255. a share
is 4d. a share, paid by the seller. Can’t prophesy
dividend rates... .A.M.P.: One of the most speculative
on the list; sell if stock goes to 4s A.V.F.:
On payment of 2s. you may inspect list of share-
holders at Registrar-General’s, Sydney F. 8.:
Guarantor is not liable for the difference. You
cannot contract yourself out of the provisions of the
law, unless the law specially allows you to do so;
there is no such allowance in respect of the 221
per cent, cut in pref. divs Roth: Standard Oil

favorable stricture in this area.


THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
Protection and Costs
Dear B..—“Ubique” (B. 30/3/’32) says we
“must export to pay for our jamboree, but
our present policy is limiting our markets. ’
It isn’t. This is the first time in a good
many years that Australia has shown signs
of paying its way without any mad jamboree.
He says that “as a young country with large
resources still undeveloped” we want lots of
imported machinery duty free. If he would
give particulars of these undeveloped re-
sources, which are bragged about until they
are an unspeakable weariness, it would be
a relief. We know that Australia has the
largest desert in the British Empire, and
that one can follow the western route for
1000 or 1100 miles without meeting a thread
of permanent fresh water, which is some-
thing to start with. Then lie adds that “our
secondary industries are either dreadfully
inefficient or else guilty of gross profiteer-
ing.” A more notable fact is that they pay,
or are charged, grossly high wages, though
the workers get little benefit, owing to the
high cost of living, huge taxes (largely to
pay interest on foreign loans), broken time,
loss through trades-union disturbances and
the like. The average N.S.W. factory pay
in 1929-30, when one could get it, was £222
13s. 6d. per annum for men, women, boys
and girls, which was the highest in Aus-
tralia, the highest in the State’s history, and
£57 above the figure for 1920-21. And in
1929-30 207 factories closed up, about 28,000
workers lost their jobs (the biggest record
of job-losing among the States), and N.S.W.
lost £1,516,296 in wages through strikes,
which was more than was sacrificed by all
the other States combined. It isn’t the pro-
hibitive tariff but the prohibitive nominal
wage which makes the trouble. —Yours, J. E.
Our Wool-selling System
Dear Bulletin,— “Royal Orange” (B.
16/3/’32) says the fact that I find it “neces-
sary to inspect my wool and do the expert’s
work of fixing the reserve” shows the weak-
ness of the present system. I do not find
it “necessary” to see liow my wool opens
up, but I realise it is advisable for any
grower, particularly for one who classes his
own wool. The manufacturer whose interest
in his product ends when it leaves his fac-
tory cannot expect the success of the man
who follows it to the retailer, compares it
with similar lines sold in competition, and
uses that experience to improve the future
marketing of his article. That’s why I in-
spect my wool on the show floor. The
difference between the wool as it looked in
the shearing-shed bins and as it opens up
after having been pressed for months is con-
siderable, and the man who follows his sale
will gain more than the cost of a trip to the
city.
“R. 0.” wants more service from the
brokers for the same money. His idea of
marketing is: (A) Clips to be valued on
arrival in store; (B) grower to have option
of selling at that valuation or, “if satisfied,”
wool to be auctioned. (A) might be pos-
sible in the case of small clips which arrive
in one consignment accompanied by descrip-
tive waybills. With large clips which arrive
over a period of weeks —sometimes months—
or where brokers are not advised of “breaks,”
it would necessitate the sampling of every
other bale arriving in store —impossible even
if present “expensive staffs” were multiplied
by 10. (R) would mean that sample bales
of every clip would have to be on display
from arrival in store until sold. The space
and lighting necessary for such an under-
taking would entail roofing several suburbs.
• —Yours, Murrawong.
The Man on the Land’s Wages
Dear B., —I wonder when the unneces-
sary middleman, the all-pervading agent, the
three public servants who are doing one
man’s work, the politicians’ friends who are
holding down superfluous and ornamental
jobs will realise that before things begin
to recover they have got to get down to
where the man on the land is. and to where
they were in 1913. Yesterday I sold the
last of my season’s crop of fruit. It brought
altogether £238 7s. 6d.; net profit, after pay-
ing all expenses, £6O 14s. 2d. That is what
I’ve got to live on and keep wife and family
and help pay the non-workers’ dole. Already
£l7 ss. has gone for manure for next year’s
crop. Many orchardists put in cabbages and
tomatoes to help along; to-day tomatoes are
6d. and 9d. a case, and last week I saw loads
of cabbages being brought homo from Vic-
toria Market to be dumped before cows and
pigs. Yet men like “Gad” say they have
a “right” to share these men’s earnings, and
magnanimously offer to work for five bob a
week and tucker, equal to 255. a week.
Where are the men I’m writing about going
to get 255. a week? They can’t get it for
themselves.—Yours, Canuck.
The Unions Are Responsible
Dear Bulletin, —It is about time our
politicians passed an examination in ele-
mentary arithmetic. Finance and economics
are only another way of saying 2 + 2 = 4.
If the value of our production drops 20
per cent., then we have 20 per cent, less
to spend. That can’t be argued. If Smith.
Jones and Brown together produce £lOO
worth of goods, and divide the proceeds
one-third each, all is well. But, when their
production falls to £BO, obviously Smith
and Jones should not continue to take £33
13s. 4d. each, and leave poor Brown to sus-
tain the loss. Yet this, in effect, is what
our trade-union Parliamentarians say must
and shall take place. Can they not see
that a few men, drawing a large share of
the value of the total production, automati-
cally deprive many others of a share at all?
Therefore, unless prices abroad rise very
rapidly, which hardly seems possible, a scal-
ing down of salaries and wages, and a plain-
ing of overstaffed non-producing services,
must take place, if the unemployed, of whom
I am one, are ever to work again.—Yours,
Bourneh.
The Youth of To-day and Yesterday
Dear 8.,—1f “,C-don” (B. 30/3/’32)
thinks the youths of 1934-1 S were much dif-
ferent from those of to-day, he must have
been amongst a special variety in those past
days. At any rate, his description of the
youth of to-day adequately serves also for
the average of those I was with in the
C.M.F., the A.I.F. (1916-19) and the Air
Force (1920-26). Yet when the testing-
time came those fellows did all right. No ;
if youth fails in its testing-time it is because
the elders fail in leadership. If we want to
lament publicly, let’s stick to the outstand-
ing feature of the present time —the elders
don’t seem as good as those of 1914-18. —
Yours, llalf-way.
The Rural Worker
Dear Bulletin, —I am on the land. Like
most of us small graziers and cockies, I
hold we are the worst-treated people in Aus-
tralia. But, still, what we have to put up
with is nothing to what the rural worker
has to endure. Bereft of awards, taking
what he can get, where he can get it, he
carries on without complaint. The harvest
wage in this district this year was 7s. per
day and keep. There was no mention of
hours. My neighbor had his crop put in
by a man, a first-class worker, who got 38s.
per week and found himself, and he has a
wife and two kiddies. His dole allowance
would have been well over the pound. And
on top of that the rural workers have to put
up with libels told by men who cannot realise
the rural worker is our natural ally and as
necessary to primary production as we are.
The rural workers are the only ones who,
as a class, have seen the need for a readjust-
ment in values and wages and have faced
the situation manfully and without undue
growling. Instead of vague inaccurate state-
ments let “Curragh”—a recent correspon-
dent—and his friends step out with an
account of how even one bushel of wheat
was spoilt, one sheep unshorn or one acre
of ground unploughed because men could not
be found to do it at a low but reasonable
wage.—Yours, R. O.
Depression and Character
Dear Bulletin,— “L’Fou” wrote (B.
9/3/’32) that “a term on the dole might
even be character-building instead of revo-
lution-building.” Never once before, since
the depression came upon us, had I heard
or read this thought expressed, but I know
there is a great truth in those few words.
I was struggling to establish my own busi-
ness in the motor trade in Sydney, and
early took the count, losing every penny
I had invested in the business. Being young
and single, I managed to keep my head just
above water by commission sales of cars and
whatever repairs I could get to do, until
a short time ago I was
offered and accepted a
position in Melbourne.
During my two-year
period of depressionitis I
learned things I had
never known before —the
value of friendship and
money and good books
(including, please let me
say, The Bulletin ),
and to love and appre-
ciate Nature. I studied
economics, psychology, re-
ligion and politics—in
fact, widened my horizon
in every direction to, I
am sure, my lasting bene-
fit. Yes, I for one, can
sincerely thank God for
my two years of “almost
on the dole.” —Yours,
Syd-Melbun.
The Farthing
Dear B., —When is the
nimble farthing coming
back? An issue would
,be a godsend. Nowadays
nearly everything that
can be sold by the pound
ends with “|d.” Butter
always rises or falls by
Jd. per pound—4s. Bd.
per hundredweight. Take
the retail price at Is. 6id.
per pound. The custo-
mer who buys a quarter-
pound pays at the rate of
Is. Bd. per pound. Four
times more half-pounds
than pounds are sold. If
a shopkeeper sells 2cwt.
of butter per day in half-
pounds he makes a profit
of 9s. 4d. by the odd
farthings without giving
any value for same. In
a grocer’s window the
other day I counted 32
articles, of which 28
ended with the odd id.,
and which could he
bought by the half-pound.
The practice seems to be
general throughout the
trade. Even tobacconists
are following it; a well-
known brand is now re-
railed at 9fd. per ounce.
Of course, it means 10d.,
unless you buy 2oz. But
why should those who
can afford only small pur-
chases be robbed ?
Yours, Le Bon.
Ottawa and Migration
Dear Bulletin, —The
Ottawa Conference in
July will be of great im-
portance to Australia,
and sentiment will have
to give place to hard bar-
gaining. Britain has a
large population which
she cannot absorb. Up
to the present, land settle-
ment in Australia has
been used by nearly every
political party for its
own ends. Britain offer-
ed us money on very easy
terms, but the offer has
been shelved. We shall
have to tackle the job and on new
lines. The following suggestions are there-
fore brought forward for earnest con-
sideration : (1) As to settlement in N.S.W'.
and other developed States, that British capi-
tal be invited to purchase holdings for sub-
division and settlement. If suitable land is
not available at a reasonable price, Parlia-
ment should pass an Act authorising resump-
tion for the purpose. Conditions would be
imposed, but otherwise these people would
be free, so t 0 speak, to plant their own colo-
nies of settlers. (2) As to the Northern
Territory, that it be handed over to a chart-
ered company for at least 50 years, subject
to broad conditions, but otherwise without
restrictions. The Territory has cost the
Commonwealth over £12,000,000 since 1911,
while the revenue has been only £1,529,362,
and the annual cost of administration has
risen from £104,734 to £190,064, with prac-
tically no development. It is time such a
system was passed out. —Yours, C. T. B.
Taxation
Dear Bulletin, —What is taxation, any-
how? Is it a confiscation of wealth? Are
producers to be regarded as wicked people, to
be heavily fined, and the fine always in pro-
portion to their industry, to their usefulness
in the community? Is our tax system funda-
mentally a system of pillage and brigandage
that we take from people merely because
they have, as the pirates do, or should our
tax system have a basis in justice and
equity? The problem will never be cleai*ed
up until we fully understand that taxa-
tion is not a collection based on possession,
but a payment based on services rendered
and privileges enjoyed.
Public revenue can be raised without
violating the rights of private property, with-
out strangling trade and commerce, without
adding to the cost of living, without impos-
ing unjust burdens upon production, or, on
the other hand, offering rewards to idleness.
With the coming of society appears a value,
which we call land value. It is true it
attaches to land, yet it is not the value of
land, but the value of government. The
value that attaches to things men make lias
a different genesis from the value that
attaches to land. The value of land does
not arise from the cost of production, plus
taxes. The reverse of this is true; there is
no production cost, and the selling price
of land is that part of the annual value
(or economic rent) that we fail to collect
by taxation, capitalised into selling price.
That is why the less you tax economic rent,
the higher the selling price of land; the more
you tax the economic rent for social uses,
the lower the selling price of land. Every
pound expended by society in social service is
reflected in the increased amount of economic
rent. The only permanent solution of the
taxation problem is to treat land values as
a community asset and not as a liability.—
Yours, etc., Tantalus.
The Australian Egg Trade
Dear Bulletin, —The British agricultural
marketing report for January, 1932, just
published, reveals a very marked reduction
in the import of eggs from foreign countries.
Australia became the second most important
source of supply, with 177,000 “great hun-
dreds” (120) against 75,000 in January,
1931, and 18,000 in January, 1930. With
a tariff of 10 p.c. on foreign eggs, there is
every inducement for the Australian poultry-
farmer to double his output; in fact, if the
tariff is t 0 remain, this is absolutely essen-
tial. Mr. Neville Chamberlain, Chancellor
of the Exchequer, speaking at a public meet-
ing a few days ago, said : “Tariffs are not
an aid to the lazy man, but are to help the
man who is out to help himself ; and surely
this tariff will be removed if those whom it
is designed to help do not take advantage
of it.”
The poultry man in Australia is in a very
favorable position for production of eggs
for export. He has a cheap food supply at
his door; his time of greatest production is
the time of scarcity of importing countries.
The rate of exchange is in his favor, and
his market overseas is practically unlimited.
Before Christmas S’Africa was sending eggs
into England at the rate of 3,000,000 a
week. But what is that? Not half an egg
per head per week in London alone.
So far all the English poultry papers
speak well of the quality of the eggs sent by
Australia. —Yours, Man-of-Kent (Canter-
bury, Eng.).
“Buy Australian”
Dear Bulletin, —I want to kill someone.
I live in a Dutch East Indian island, and
have for 12 months told the handful of whites
here about the wonderful products of Aus-
tralia. Especially I have urged upon them
that the Australian isn’t merely a peasant
and coolie, growing wheat and wool and
sugar; I have enthused more than usual
about Australian rugs and blankets and
woollen goods generally. Well, a few months
ago I wanted a new outfit of underwear, and
sent to a well-known Australian firm of
mercers. I got others to join with me. In
due time the articles arrived. They were
no good ? You arc wrong. They were
excellent lines. Quality of material first-
class and workmanship not bad. But accom-
panying them was a letter in which the firm
apologised for being obliged to send Aus-
tralian-made goods. What can you do with
people like that? —Yours, Exile.
THE IMPERILLED TALETELLER.
“Mr. Lang will make doles and pensions the issue if he goes to the country, and thinks he can
win on it. But Mr. Garden is dubious, and urges the- Government, to stick to office, whatever happens,

Donizetti’s “Lucia,” abridged, the second
item in the Williamson Opera Co.’s pro-
gramme, filled Her Majesty’s, Sydney, with
an audience which got fairly good value for
its money. The piece is more attractive than
“Aida” to the average theatregoer, compris-
ing as it does a series of well-known melo-
dies and giving the prima-donna plenty of
opportunity to exhibit all the tricks of the
Italian school of voice culture. Dina
Paliughi has a Mischa Elman of a voice—
a light soprano so flexible and capable
of so many gradations of color that it
can imitate flute or violin. The furore
which her performance of the mad scene
engendered among fellow-members of the
company who were in the audience was quite
understandable ; but, even so, their demonstra-
tions of approval might have been postponed
till the end of the act. As it was they
imposed on poor demented Lucia a lucid inter-
val, after which she went on being mad
with a couple of red blossoms from a posy
perched on the trailing tail of her nightie.
Physically Miss Paliughi is not a romantic
figure. The men fitted better into their places
as members of Jacobean society. Ilio del
Cliiaro, made up as Lord Ashton, i rather
like the Cliandos Sliakspeare, is a robust bari-
tone with plenty of dramatic fire. Oreste
de Bernhardi’s Ravenswood had appeal by
reason of an air of gentle melancholy and a
voice of pleasant timbre; but he never ceased
waving his hands for a moment. As the
Rev, Bidebent Michele Fiore looked more'like
Henry the Eighth than a parson, and appa-
rently had only one suit to his back. He
eschewed ecclesiastical vestment even in the
marriage scene. Roy Glasheen, as Bucklaw,
sang his tenor aria nicely, but both he and
George Livermore, who played. Norman,,have
a lot to learn about' stagh-deportinent:
Scenery was adequate and orchestral support
excellent. . For some, unexplained ; reason the
first scene of Act 111 was cut-out, though if
figured on the programme. .
* * *
If this Williamson cq. had set itself
out to demqnstrate- as strikingly as .possible
the difference between the old arid . ne.w, in
opera it co'rild not have done it better than
by giving “La Boh&me” after “Aida” arid
“Lucia.” Donizetti . escaped the .
wind that Wagner projected through the'
hot-house of operatic conventions. Verdi’s
revision of his style in “Aida” shows that
influence, but very slightly. Puccini arrives
on the scene after the great Richard
has won his battle. Although lie can ri#.ake
melodies as beautiful as thos.e of any. of his
countrymen who preceded him, he subscribes
loyally to Hamlet’s (and ' Wagner’s) dictum
that “the play’s the thing,”; arid thaty the
music must obey words and action, not dic-
tate them. A cast which included three very
pleasing singers who made their Australian
debut in this production went through the
play with an easy naturalness that; offered
no distraction from the beauty of the
music and the cleverness of the’ orches-
tration. tCesarina -Yalobra, as Mimi; having
no vocal acrobatics to cope with, was able to
live her part, for which, in face and figure, she
was well suited. She sang her lines in awoice
that was sweet without being too saccharine,
and delicate without being feeble. Also a
graceful figure in a pretty picture was
Miss Mascagni’s Musetta. The Austra-
lian girl’s very light soprano was not
quite sufficient to the demands made
upon it, but her acting was spirited.
Carlo Alfieri, third of the new arrivals on
the stage, made a convincing Rudolfo. A
bit womanish, and over-fond of his emotions,
but what would you of a poet, especially
a Parisian poet? The rest of the Bohemian
musketeers were represented by the always-
reliable Granforte, Marone and Fiore,, the
last-named particularly worthy of mention
for his touching farewell to his greatly-
prized overco’at. Costumes, scenery, orches-
tration, lighting and the mood of all the
actors combined to capture very completely
the spirit of the opera. A very satisfying
production. If Sydney is as musical as it
reckons it is Musetta’s waltz will oust
“You Will Remember Vienna” from the re-
pertoire of bath-singers and whistlers for at
least a week.

If Mac-Credie Luker, author of “Contract
in Hearts,” staged at St. James’s Hall in
the cause of charity, had placed the script
in the hands of an experienced playwright
for overhauling a smart little comedy might
have been the result. As the play stands it
is burdened with an unconvincing plot, char-
acters and comic interludes which only hold
up the story, and a multitude of obvious re-
torts to hackneyed lines. The principal char-
acters are cleverly drawn in a conventional
manner, and the dialogue when it departs
from the stereotyped sparkles at times. T'he
play’s chief fault is the assumption that a
set of intelligent middle-class people would
make such an ado over a married man’s very
mild flirtation with a single girl. Set in Lon-
don, it introduces Hubert Castleton (Ernest
Way), a young business man who finds the
company of Greta Mannering (Myrna
Dickey) rather comforting during the absence
abroad of his wife, Margaret (Trixie Gore).
Hubert’s mild liking for the damsel worries
his brother Tony (Hamilton Beattie), his
sister-in-law, Valda (Kathleen Dickey) and
Barry Kent (Roger Gibson), a friend. The
outcome pf a series of manoeuvres on the part
of the objectors is the return of Hubert’s wife
(who, incidentally, confesses to having in-
dulged in a little coquetry on the Conti-
nent), and the engagement of Barry and
Greta. Except Hamilton Beattie, Horace J.
Salier, who played a butler, and Max Napier,
who bustled around as a waiter, the men
were poor. The ladies did much better, par-
ticularly Myrna Dickey and Sylvia Lance
Thomson. The thing was produced by Wil-
liam Craufuird, and the prompter, deserved
to have his name on the programme.
Benn W. Levy’s “Art and Mrs. Bottle,’’
with which Sydney Players’ Club enter-
tained a large audience at St. James’s Hall,
has an uncommon plot and is full of unex-
pected twists. The story is concerned with
what follows the return of Celia Bottle
(Doris State) to her husband (Edward
Cavill) after 20 years. Celia had left him and
her two children at the age of 22 for Max
Lightly (Dudley Swindon), then a promising
young painter. Max, tiring of her in a few
months, left her penniless in Paris, and she
later became the mistress of an elderly aristo-
crat and spent her time gadding around the
capitals of Europe with him. The blue-blood
having died, Celia returns to England, and
calmly reappropriates her husband. She finds
her _ son Michael (Jack Appleton) has
declined to enter his father’s business and
has taken up painting, and that her daugh-
ter Judy (Trixie Gore), is “intellectually
arrogant” and has advanced ideas regarding
art and love. She elicits that Judy is con-
templating an affair with Lightly, and Michael
confesses that he is in love with Sonia Tip-
pett (Joyce McTavish), an artist’s model,
Celia upsets both these affairs, and when
the curtain falls all members of the family
show symptoms of living happily ever after.
Produced by Raoul Cardamatis the per-
formance was well done, but Doris State led
the others by a good length. Edward Cavill
gaye her fine support. The play will be
repeated on Tuesday and Friday evenings of
next week.

The last six plays entered for the Austra-
lian Play Society’s one-act play tournament
were disposed of last week at the JEoliaa
H'all, Sydney. “A Game of Billiards,” by
Paul Hasluck, dealt with the absorption of
two inebi’iated gentlemen in their pastime and
their unawareness of the strange fate of the
other inhabitant • of the room, a politician
shadowed by a symbolical death. Oriel Mul-
larkey’s “As It Was in the Beginning” sug-
gested that Australia might go to war with
Uncle Sam, and showed what might happen
to a conscientious objector.'. Ruth Bedford’s

“Postman's Knock” was a comedy-drama oE
coincidences that gripped. In “Out of a Clear
Sky,” by Doris Hayball, tragedy stalks behind
the arrival of the heroine’s husband at
the farmhouse where she is living with her
lover and children. “Showing Sylvie,” from
the pen of Peggy Thornhill, gave a woman’s
view of the things that might happen to a
man who tried to teach his wife how to run
her home. Lilian Shand’s “Geraniums, My
Dear,” was' all about a housekeeper coming
for a job on the wrong floor, and being mis-
taken for someone’s godmother, and then
finding out that the person she should have
applied to is. her own husband, who left her
10 years before owing to'her zest for ama-
teur theatricals. This • completes the first
round. “The Raid,” “Hypocrites,” “Post-
man’s Knock,” “Dream Errant” and “No
Robbery” remain in and will be played again
on Tuesday. Meanwhile conjecture is run-
ning high as to who will be the winner of
the three-act play competition, the results
of which are promised for an early date.

“Revolution,” Furnley Maurice’s Austra-
lian three-act comedy-farce, staged with a
relatively gigantic cast at Melb. Queen’s
Hall last week, made a large audience feel
sad. Mr. Maurice has done better than this.
His play purported to be a bit of-' fun. As
a matter of fact, it was a first-class theatri-
cal faux pas; and the. actors looked as uncom-
fortable as the audience. The bad. ones acted
worse than present Showman believed it pos-
sible for any actors to act, and the good ones,
who included Norman Blackl,er. and Adeline
Strain, looked as if they would have liked
to bury their heads in a bag. The
story concerned a band of unionists who
had bribed ;the police 'to stand aside . while
the proletariat took’’ charge. The'evel of the
revolution coincides with a birthday party,
and conspirators and revellers get mixed.
Loyal police raid the_ meeting of the Com-
munists and force a cupboard, supposed to
contain cordite for blowing up the metro-
polis. It turns out to contain dozens of
bottles of Richmond beer. It was real beer,
and in full public view the actors
opened the bottles and drained mugs of the
contents —compensation that should rightly
have been proffered to the audience.
“The Widow’s Cruise,” by Joan Temple,
was produced for four nights at the Little
Theatre Company’s Kiosk, Melbourne, last
week. It was set in Italy. Hal Percy
w r as Lieut.-Col. Sir Theodore Frome, D. 5.0.,
an elderly officer w T ho marries Francesca
(Eve Dawnay). Jack Wiltshire was Cap-
tain Ignoto, called the Unknown because he
lias lost his memory in the retreat from
Caporetto, when he stemmed alone the Aus-
trian advance and became the idol of Italy.
When he recovers his memory he discovers
he is an English poet and that Sir Theo-
dore has married his wife. The discovery is
made on the terrace garden of the Villa
Santa Margherita, on the island of Capri,
apparently a very romantic spot, because he
starts alternately embracing Sir Theo’s ward
(Margaret Reid) and his wife. In the end
he plumps for his wife, and she, having been
also infected by the prevailing romantic
atmosphere, divorces her second husband and
returns to her first love. The piece was
elegantly staged and Jack Wiltshire gave a
brilliant rendering of the ingenious mixture
of poet and cynic. An innocuous English
comedy, sufficiently well clothed in bright
lines and sophistication to conceal the good
old theatrical stereotypes underneath.

At Sydney Royal the Ernest Rolls revue,
“Bright Side Up,” with Gus Bluett and
Jennie Benson heading a large and sprightly
co., continues to cater for people who want to
laugh, and gives them what they pay for.
Ella Shields is to appfear shortly.
The Palette,
The Water-color Institute’s show at the
Education Department’s Gallery, Sydney,
contains some attractive work by well-known
artists and some work of promise by com-
parative newcomers in the water-color field.
President B. E. Minns displays his versatility
in spirited paintings of a bos., the bushlands
and the Harbor. Fred Leist, in “Anglers,”
“Green and Gold” and “Wind,” uses his
strong and graceful line with fine effect.
Bla'mire Young, subscribing to the Hilder
theory that moonlight is green, makes an
effective study of the Harbor Bridge, and in
“Granite” achieves an impressive decorative
design with a gum-tree and a few rocks. M.
J. McNally’s romantic skies brood over some
cleverly painted landscapes and “The End
of a Good Fight,” the hero of which is a
trout, is full of snap. Jessie Traill goes to
Centralia for one of.her drawings, “Early
Morning, Finke River,” which looks strange
but may be true. H. R. Gallop indulges his
love for rich color in “Spring” and “Red
Gum.” Hubert Jarvis in “The Dawn”
authentically reproduces the peculiar light.
G. R, Towmshend is at his best in two sea-
pieces. M. Barling draws tigers convincingly
and Muriel Waddy contributes the nicest
still-life in the collection. Napier Waller in
“Bantams” a lino, color print, sets a new
Australian standard in this art. Some of
the strongest work in the show is contributed
by Joseph Connor, whose Tasmanian scenes
are . distinctive. J. R. Eldersliaw’s “Little
Bridge through the Trees,” “White Mills”
and “Mediterranean” are very successful
essays in three styles.
In his latest show at Melbourne Atlie-
njeum, Richard McCann advertises his cus-
tomary ability to make amiable transcripts
from Nature, with a touch of the profes-
sional beautifier to give them popular appeal.
McCann is at his best when he has water at
hand.' Tie has ,a. plausible, formula for mak-
ing reflections look- real. As a welcome
change from the eminent citizen who says
he knows nothing about art and then pro-
ceeds to, prove it in a 40-minute speech, the
show was opened with song, A. C. Bartle-
man being the vocalist.
SHADOW SHOWS.
Paramount’s “Shanghai Express,” at Syd-
ney Prince Edward, is based on about the
most reliable old theme in the business —
that of the fallen angel who' offers to sacri-
fices all for her lost love, and so wins him
back, and paves the way to matrimony. The
action takes place on a train between Peip-
ing and Shanghai. The cast reads well, bul
the acting is disappointing on the whole.
This critic has often noticed that milinmers
cease being emotionally effective when they
start dashing about in cars, and reflected
that the same trouble would no doubt arise
if they boarded a balloon, bike or other
vehicle that diverted attention from their
problems to the passing scenery. In this
show Marlene Dietrich (“Shanghai Lily”)
and Clive Brook, as an M.O. Avho abandoned
her long ago, but loves her still, are
strangely wooden even for them. But it is
a fine movie all the same —an object-lesson
in the art of creating atmosphere by photo-
graphy and mechanical sound effects. Yon
see the mixed crowd at the station ; watch
the train get under way, groan off and stop,
as it passes through a narrow slum street,
while a cow and her calf are led, after
much argument, to a place of safety; hear
the innumerable noises a train makes; get.
the illusion of railway carriages by night,
by daylight and in tunnels. It is a triumph
of camera-work, which is not surprising see
ing that Von Sternberg directed it; and the
very fact that it deals with a two-day train
journey gives it an extraneous interest.
Trains, like ships, are exciting in them-
selves. The minor characters —Warner
Oland, as a rebel general; Eugene Pallette.
as a globe-trotting American; Lawrence
Grant, as a parson—add to the effect by
their appearance and behavior. The stars
supply the jarring note. Clive Brook bears
his aching heart about sulkily in field ser-
vice boots, a Sam Browne belt, and. a cut-
ting whip, except at night, when he changes
into slacks and a natty mess-jacket. Even
the Englishman who dressed for dinner in
a jungle would have jibbed at doing it on a
train. Marlene Dietrich gets herself up
like the lady friend in an expensive Paris
restaurant. That is where she differs from
Garbo, who knows when, as well as how, to
put on simple clothes.
* * *
“The Unholy Garden” (United Artists),
at Sydney State, is an absurd melodrama
with plenty of sexy scenes. Ronald Colman
is in the lead as Barry Hunt, a gentlemanly
thief who has been forced to take refuge in
a castle in the Sahara. The establishment
also harbors villainous outcasts of various
nationalities. The other inmates are plan-
ning to deprive an aged and blind em-
bezzler of a hoard of cash which he has
abstracted from a European bank. The
embezzler has a charming grand-daughter,
and Hunt hopes by making love to her to got
within reach of the boodle. The girl fasci-
nates him, however, and a whirl of hurrying
and scurrying up and down stairways, bind-
ing and gaggings and sudden deaths follows
Hunt’s efforts to outwit the crooks and play
fair with the “Cinderella of the Desert.” The
film ends with the girl making a get-away
with the money. Hunt does not accompany
her. Colman is his usual pretty self, Fay
Wray looks the sweet young thing she is
supposed to be, and Estelle Taylor makes
a passable vamp.
* * *
Sydney Plaza is trying to coax back patrons
who were scared by “Letters of Fire,” a film
that threatened to make them think, with a
double bill of a less exacting sort. “Her
Majesty, Love” (First National), is a
modern romance set in Germany, with a
younger son of a well-off Berlin family and
a cabaret barmaid as the leading characters.
The young man’s family step in and separate
the couple. He is set to work in one of
the family’s factories; the lady becomes the
wife of a baron in his dotage. After the
barmaid is hitched up the young man re-
sumes his wooing, remarking that, while his
family objected to a barmaid, a baroness was
a bird of another feather. Ben Lyon and
Marilyn Miller are the kiss-swappers. The
supporting item, “I Like Your Nerve” (First
National), introduces Douglas Fairbanks,
jun., as a wealthy youth in love with the
pretty and petulant stepdaughter of a ras-
cally Central American politician who wants
to hand the maiden over to an aged rake for
a cash consideration.

In “Many Waters ” (8.1. P.), at Sydney
Lyceum, the picture producer proves to the
author that people in general, personified by
the Barcaldines, plump every time for the “Cin-
derella” romance because they are common-
place—“ What do they know about real life?”
Then the picture switches back and shows
you the life of the Barcaldines (Arthur Mar-
getson and Lilian Hall Davis). They met
casually, and married at the registry office.
He is succeeding when their daughter, Freda,
is born. Freda (Elizabeth Allen) grows up.
has an affair with a married family friend,
and dies after the birth of the child. Bar-
caldine is bankrupt. At the examination
Rosel, the principal creditor, is about to pro-
duce ‘ a note that would have incriminated
Barcaldine when Mrs. Rosel (Mary Clare),
whose jealousy of the Barcaldines’ “position”
had instigated Rosel’.s persecution, learns
about Freda’s baby. She induces him to
burn the note. The story is cleverly pre-
sented.
* * *
“Husband’s Holiday” (Paramount), at
the Regent, is the story of an understanding
wife. The wise lady is Mary Boyd (Vivi-
enne Osborne), .whose husband George
(Clive Brook) is in pursuit of charming
young Christine Kennedy (Juliette Comp-
ton). The news of the affair is conveyed to
her by her mother, a stiff-necked matron who
has divorced her husband for a moral lapse.
George wants a divorce and most of Mary’s
family urge her to grant him his freedom.
Mary refuses. George goes off to live with
Christine, but she does not come up to ex-
pectations. He finally returns to his home,
wife and kids. Brook was satisfying, and
Vivienne Osborne made the wife a lovable
person. .Charles Ruggles played a minor
part well. In the other Regent film “Cheat-
ers at Play” (Fox), Thomas Meighan and
Charlotte Greenwood contribute a lot of
action.

Let us Sugar Growers talk
to you, fellow Australians!
“J OFTEN WONDER,” said the typical
Sugar Grower here pictured recently, ‘‘l often
wonder whether the people in the South have any
idea of the business relationship we bear to them;
whether they understand us; whether they realise
the important part we play in maintaining the
White-Australia policy to which we all subscribe;
and how efficiently we do the job. If they
understood us better they might take the same
pride in the Sugar Industry that we do ourselves.
Why not tell them, through the press, how we
stand ?
“This is a time when many misunderstandings
in all walks of our national life need to be
cleared away. Let us Sugar Growers, therefore,
in a series of short, crisp statements, of which
this is the first, give you, our fellow countrymen,
our point of view.”
1/
& j'
A typical Sugar Grower who wants his
industry understood .
30,000 families are engaged
in producing the sugar you use
Now, we have two claims on your goodwill. The first is that we are the pioneers of your tropical agriculture,
the keepers of your northern gate. Two-fifths of the continent lie within the tropics, and must be used for the
growth of tropical crops. Were it not for the Sugar Industry you would hardly be populating this area at all.
Vou might ponder well over that fact. The second claim is that we are your customers. What we make' in wages
and profits we spend on the goods and services that you supply. There are 30,000 families of us, a good market
for you. It is in your interests that you give us a fair deal. If, by some thoughtless move', you injure us,
you injure yourselves, for all trade is mutual.
"Don’t shut your mind to the facts that we shall give you from time to time. Instead, co-operate with us to make
Australia richer and to keep her White!”

POWER OF THE PENNY
How many realise, genuinely and realise, the
power of the penny?
The old exhortation, “Take care of the pennies and the pounds
will take care of themselves,” has more significance than most
of us realise.
Think it out-—better still, try it out —the steady, sincere con-
servation of the small coins, the proper practical appreciation
of the value of small things, and their cumulative qualities.
Save the pennies, and the pounds, too, if you can, but let
the Savings Account take care of them for you.
That is the better way by at least 3 per cent, per annum.

“FY7”: Australia, especially in its Queens-
land and Westralian sections, has always been
pardonably proud of the gastronomic feats
of its out-back goats, which have formed
the subject of many notes on this page. But
an English capricornian has come close to
putting up a world’s recoi'd. Travelling by
rail in a guard’s van, it began by eating its
label with the address of its destination, as
anyone who has been exposed to goats would
anticipate. It followed that up by devour-
ing 25 young chickens, with pedigrees
as long as that of Mistress Jean Dal-
housie in the “Laird o’ Cockpen,” and the
cardboard box and straw in which they were
packed. The railway company has adver-
tised fruitlessly for the goat’s owner, but the
prospect of paying for the vanished chickens
evidently does not appeal to that individual.
“Four Eyes” : The alleged climbing fish of
North Queensland and other tropical waters
(B. 6/4/’32) is better described
as a hopper than a climber, for
beyond skipping about man-
grove roots he has no arboreal
aspirations. A true tree-
climber is the Indian perch, a
little chap who occurs also in
Malaya, and, it is said, in
Northern Australia. This fish
has specially-developed ventral
fins, which enable it to actually
climb trees out of the water, a
peculiar gill formation for re-
taining water making this pos-
sible. As to the tortoises referred
to by “Waranbini,” they can-
not be rated as fish, being, like all the Chel-
onidw. air-breathers.

“Mulgo”: An exhibit in Hobart Museum
is a stuffed seal, Sft. Gin. long, which was
shot by a policeman while on night duty
about 30 years ago. The constable dis-
covered it lying on the footpath at Water-
man’s Dock. Thinking it was a drunk,
he gave it a gentle thrust with his foot.
A grunt was the only answer. “Come on
now,” said Robert. “Get up out of this.”
At the same time he gave the stranger
another thrust, and a sudden heave of the
prostrate body nearly knocked him over.
“None of your pranks now,” he said, sternly.
“If you don’t get away home I’ll take you
to the lock-up. What the devil’s the matter
with you, anyway?” He bent down to lift
the obstinacy, but let go immediately and
jumped back. Then he sidled round it,
startled and puzzled, while the mystery
flopped about on the pavement and grinned
horribly. Finally, the policeman rushed off
for reinforcements. He returned with the
sergeant, a revolver and a lantern, and execu-
tion followed.
“Vil N.” : Norm and I staggered over the
stony hill-crest and dropped Matilda. There on
the plain shimmered through the haze a lake !
Camp-fire yarns by the old hands of thirst-
tortured newchums chasing mirages until
death silenced their delirium echoed through
my mind. “It’s a mirage!” I croaked
through swelling lips; “don’t look at it, or
you’ll go mad!” And I dragged him back
the way w r e had come. But somehow we
wheeled, and found ourselves back on the
ridge watching the “waters” ruffle as though
ON POINTS.
MAGISTRATE: “How do you plead?”
PRISONER: “Fifty-fifty, your Worship.”
a breeze passed over. “I feel a breeze!”
cackled Norm. I thought I could too; but,
trying to laugh, snapped, “It’s your imagi-
nation !” He looked at me queerly, so I
hastily added, “Pull yourself together.
There’s a soak about four miles due west.”
Norm gasped: “Here’s all the water we
want!” and tottered towards the mirage. I
made a wild grab to stay him. Together we
rolled down the slope. I landed on top, and
I swore to stay there until the mirage dis-
appeared. Norm struggled and implored me
not to be mad (me!), but to let him get
us each a drink from the “lake.” Saying
nothing, I sat on his chest, shielding his
face from the sun, squirming as the sweat-
itch set in, yet exulting at being able to resist
the temptation of the mirage and thus save
my mate. Suddenly, with a madman’s power,
he heaved me off. He was staggering to-
wards the watery illusion before I had half-
risen. Screaming to him to stop, I reeled
after him. Five yards from the water I
tackled him. Panting madly, we rolled over
and down the claypan. Then —splash !....
And where we lay in the lukewarm water
we drank ourselves sick.

“O. W. Waireki”: Henare, who had just
finished a scrub-cutting job, shared a room
with me at a city boarding house. About
4 a.m. the violent ringing of his alarm-
clock awakened me. Henare made no attempt
to check it; he simply lay back and laughed
loudly. “Why don’t you get up if you have
to?” I snapped, annoyed at being awakened
so early. “I font hafe to,!’ he shouted,
tears of mirth running down his plump
cheeks. “T’at te fun of it. For five months
tat cow raugh at me—now it my turn,” and
he commenced another gale of mirth.

: A yarn about an Italian
farmer out Liverpool way (N.S.W.) who yokes
himself alongside a horse to do his ploughing
was considered worth a couple of headings
by the “S.M.H.” It reminds me that in the
first Federal Parliament during the debate
on the White Australia policy Frederick
Sargood said he had seen women yoked
to horses in the plough in S.A. Tom
Playford heatedly denied the imputation, but
George Pearce confirmed Sargood’s story,
and another Senator said he had seen the
thing at Mt. Gambier.

“Kell B.” : “Ex-Cavalryman” (B. 6/4/’32)
is right when he says that the Australian
bushman holds the riding of British cavalry-
men in contempt. With the very point of hi!
toes in the stirrups and a straight leg pointed
forward, the rider is a dead weight like a
bag of flour, and has no chance of saving him-
self from injury when his toe slips. But
that is no reason why a rider should not
make himself a live weight by using the
spring of his ankle, having the ball of his
foot —not the tip of his toe —in the stirrup,
and using the spring of his knee by having
it bent. As for that abomination the Tod
Sloan crouch, there is one point about it
that counts in its favor in this wicked world
—the jockey is powerless to interfere with
the horse.
“Worsted Spur”: I can’t see why “Ex-
Cavalryman,” whoever he may be, should drag
me into his argument as to the proper posi-
tion of the rider’s foot in the stirrup,
since I never contradicted him. I have
always been an advocate of the “foot
liome” system, which was imbibed in
western Queensland with my mother’s
milk, in a manner of speaking, and
am acquainted with the fact that it is in
use in the Imperial army, as my pen-name
might have led ‘‘Ex-O.” to suppose. When
he refers to “lifting” a horse over a jump,
however, “Ex-C.” falls into a common and
fatuous error, since, as has been said before,
the feat is tantamount to lifting oneself off
the ground by the seat of the breeches.

“Bullen-Bullen” : The latest Australian to
take London by storm is a talking budgeri-
gar which has a remarkable command of
language, including two songs. The little
fellow is referred to as a rare Australian
bird, though it is about the commonest
parrot in captivity. It is bred all over the
world, especially in Japan, where many new
color varieties have been evolved. As a
talker, however, the twittering “Budgy” has
not hitherto enjoyed much fame, and the
London specimen must be reckoned as a
super-parrot of his kind.
❖ ❖ ❖ $
“Kaipana” : Papua nearly experienced an-
other lakatoi tragedy recently, when one of
the unwieldy composite craft broke up in
heavy weather and the crew of 75 men,
women and children were rescued in the
nick of time by the Government yacht. The
lakatoi, built, like all its kind, of many
canoes lashed together and covered over with
a platform on which palm-leaf houses for
the crew are erected, is a survival of one of
the most curious trading expeditions known,
and one that-has existed from time imme-
morial, though nowadays it is dying out.
Every year towards the close of the south-
east trades the craft are put together and
laden with the earthenware in the making
of which the Motuans excel. The lakatoi
then runs before the wind under its two
curiously-shaped sails to the mouths of the
river system, debouching into the Gulf of
Papua. There the cargo of pots is unloaded
in exchange for .swamp sago and the special
large trees which the Motuans value highly
for their canoes, but which are not available
in their own district. These are made into
canoes and are built into the lakatoi, replac-
ing the originals. Then, laden with sago,
the party, which has had a hectic time
feasting and dancing in the intervals of trad-
ing, runs back t 0 its home port before the
north-west trades.

“Wainoni”: At Kaikoui’a (M.L.) butter-
fish are speared as they are feeding off cer-
tain tiny shells clustering to seaweed. It
is not often that this seaweed with the shell
growth drifts in close to shore, and there
is a great demand for it when it does. A
man motoring along the coast 80 miles away
chanced to come across some washed on the
beach. Without hesitation he flung it into
his car, and took it to Kaikoura. He was
w'ell repaid for his trouble. Having spread
his bait he made a huge net and lowered it
by mean of a pulley into the water. Later
he and another man attempted to pull the
net up, and had a hard struggle to lift it, so
full was it of butterfislv
Hopeless his eyes had scanned
Steel grille and wall of stone
While winter’s bitter blast
Had chilled him, flesh and bone.
But ’twas the sun of spring
Shone on Ins narrow bed.
Warming his frozen blood
Before his spirit fled.
Smiles lined his haggard face,
Turned to the shafting light:
His dim and filmy eyes
Once more grew strangely bright.
He saw the brigalow
Drooping in summer’s heat,
And felt the hot, red sand
Again beneath his feet.
He visioned kangaroos
Resting where shades were cool;
He heard harsh lullabies
From frogs by stream and pool.
For him the whirlwinds swept
Out where the plain was green,
Spangled with purple pea
Where the late rains had been.
Clouds had rolled black as night,
Thunder pealed loud and bold,
Rain had in torrents fall’n
(Myall was ill and cold).
But when the sun once more
Tinted with gold the west,
Softly his weary soul
Sped on to peace and rest.

“Co'oramin” : Curiosities in these days of
wire fences are the formidable barriers that
were erected in earlier times and are
still to be seen on old cattle-runs.
Some of them are over 70 years old. Posts
for sliprails were ISin. to 2ft. thick at the
small end, and many of them stood 10ft.
above ground, with a heavy cap across the
top, and there was a small horse-gate along-
side. Corner posts were equally heavy,
while the huge stockyards provided a long
contract for two or three men. Besides four
or five heavy split rails, there was a cap
on top, generally 6in. or Bin. saplings, right
round and along all divisional fences, and
a high cap over every gate or set of sliprails
There is a yard.at Ourrawilla (Q.), built in
THE HARMLESS END.
BOSS (to Jacky, who is preparing to mount a buck jumper): “Look out, Jacky—he’s
got a wicked eye.”
JACKY: “This pfeller not frighten any bally horse’s eye, Boss—no kickem with bally
eye.”
1880, the posts of which are 3ft. thick.
Many of the eastern runs of N.S.W., now cut
up, had half a dozen tremendous yards, each
with a long crush about the centre, every
post of which was cut from a big gum or
ironbark log. Half a century back heavy
fencing material was used on all runs—the
days of the two- and three-rail fences; but
gradually they have dwindled to compara-
tively flimsy affairs.
“Goney” : According to the cables, Russia
is trying to build up its once-great fur trade.
In addition to marketing the skins of the
sable and other native furs, Ivan is embark-
ing on the breeding of rabbits and kangaroos.
Some 2000 acres in the Crimea have been
fenced oft' for a farm, and the experiment is
expected to be a great success. To the Aus-
tralian. the reference to the kangaroo as an
“exotic fur-bearing beast” reads strangely,
but great hopes are based on him. The out-
standing interest of the enterprise lies in
the allegation that Prof. Ilyin of Moscow
has discovered how to make these animals
grow fur of any color by adding various
mineral salts to their diet. It sounds in-
triguing. Though green and purple kan-
garoos have been reported occasionally,
especially in the vicinity of the various
Suearers’ Arms and similar institutions of
the Outback after the sheds have cut out, no
skin of these varieties has eAmr been placed
on the market.

“Old Stager”: Mary Gilmore, in her poem
(B. 30/3/’32) about an abo. in a prison
cell alone, expresses quite correctly Binghi's
hatred of solitude. There was a touch of
merciful understanding about the gaol for
abos. at Roebourne, on the nor’-west coast
of Westralia. The prisoners were all
northern blacks who had been convicted of
cattle-spearing, murder and other offences.
During the day they worked on the roads
or loaded wool on to the little railway that
ran to the jetty at Port Sampson, 13 miles
away. The worst offenders were chained
together by the legs, with sufficient length
of chain to enable them to work. Bn, at
night they were all confined in one large
stone shed, and passers-by after dark could
hear them corroboreeing away like mad.
They did not seem very unhappy, but I feel
sure that had they been confined in separate
cells few would have survived their term of
imprisonment.

“Woorak”: The steady-pull contest for
draughts in connection with the Baek-to-the-
Ilorse procession and gymkhana in Mel-
bourne recalls the horse-pulling and scratch-
pulling contests of yesteryear. These com-
petitions are still popular in England and
the IJ.S.A. The horse-pulling contest, re-
quires the use of a dynamometer which
records the pull exerted. In scratch-pulling
man and horse are pitted in a tug-of-war.
Draughts are used. The human puller
digs his heels into the ground and sits back
with a firm grip of trace-chains hitched to
the horse. Most people would imagine that
the animal would always triumph, but Aus-
tralia has produced some mighty bushmen
who could hold their own with the strong-
est horses.

“G.S.L.” : A boy came along the other day
with a badly-torn hand, and while I dabbed
iodine on and
bound it up he
told me just
w hat I had
guessed was the
cause —he had
found a bull-
headed old tom-
cat in one of
his rabbit-traps,
and had tried
to let it go
again. I’ve
seen scores of
similar cases.
The worst was
a chap in Tassy,
who set a trap
for ’possums at
the foot of a
tree, and found
a “devil” in it
next morning.
He put his hand
down to catch it
by the neck. Re-
sult, a thumb
nearly bitten
off. Anot he r
man fonnd a
dog caught by a
hind leg in an
Adelaide sub-
urb a n fence;
he walked up to
relieve it, and
it bit his nose
off. A girl near
Renmark found
a bull goanna
caught in a
rabbit-trap, and
put out a foot
to hold its neck
while she re-
leased it. It
bit through her
boot and laid
her up wit h
blood-poisoning.
Even the quiet-
est domestic pet
is likely to bite
savagely when
in a trap. The only safe way to deal with
them is to lay them out first and release
them after.
* * *
“Larrapinta”: About 30 years ago, near
Minlacowie Ray (S.A.), a fisherman with
whom I was putting in a holiday
called out: “Gome and look at
this!” I obeyed, to find him
standing in a knee-deep pool,
with the tentacles of an octopus
reaching out toward his bare legs.
Having recently read Hugo’s
“Toilers of the Sea,” I was dubi-
ous about coming too close, but
the old boy gave a laugh and
said: “There’s nothing to be
scared of; they’re the best bait
going.” As soon as one of the
reaching tentacles touched his
bare skin it wrapped around it
like a flash ; the others followed,
and the octo. came out of its lair
under the rock and drew itself
toward him. Each tentacle was
just short of 6ft. long, and as
thick as my wrist close to the
body, while the body itself was
as large as a 701 b. bag of sugar.
The fisherman then drew his
sheath-knife, and with a few
swift slashes .severed three of the
tentacles close to the body. In-
stantly the creature tried to
escape, but he grabbed at it with
his free hand to stop it from
making for its home beneath the
rock, and shouted to me: “Bear
a hand, or he’ll get away!” I
helped, and it was soon carved up
and stowed into the bait-sack,
and that afternoon it was the
means of getting us a fine haul
of snapper off the reef. It was
a horribly creepy sensation to
feel those suckers clinging to
vour bare skin, but they didn’t
nurt at all, though the marks re-
mained for days. I’ve read that
the tentacles are as tough as
rubber. Utter rubbish ! —they
cut as easily as those of a squid.
“Ses”: A hurdle race run in Adelaide the
other day, when three horses started and
two were so long getting round that the judge
had left the box when they finished, parallels
a famous Maoriland case. In the Autumn
Steeplechase, run at Ellerslie (Auckland), in
April. ISB4. only one horse completed his job
without a mishap. A gelding called Billy-go-
’em stuck up at a fence when running second,
and a stubborn contest ensued between hors
and rider, but Billy refused to- go by any
thing. So the stewards ordered the next
race to be run. As that was a flat event
the hurdle in the straight was removed.
AN’ THAT’S ALL ’BOUT THAT.
“Why dedden ’ee clean out that sludge-pit when I told ’ee?"
“I’m qualified miner, Cap’n, an’ that soort o’ job’s onderneath my
dignity.”
“Onderneath YOUR dignity! I’ll soon leave ’ee know 'bout your
dignity. You'm like a wheelbarrow —got to go where ’e ’s
shoved.”
When Billy saw the flying colors behind him
he set off for home, and reached the straight
an hour behind time. The hurdle was has-
tily replaced, so that he could complete the
course properly and enable his owner to
draw second money. That race _ was re-
sponsible for the Maoriland rule which stipu-
lates : “No race shall exceed 20min. in dura-
tion, and after the expiration of that time
from the start the judge shall leave the box
and no horse which shall subsequently pass
the post shall be placed.”
“Shuri”: Re the dodo (B. 23/3/’32), we
need not rely on “one or two rough
sketches” ; one or more of them sat for a por-
trait not once but many times. It was a
bird of great stupidity, about the size of a
swan. Many specimens were taken to
Europe. One bird at least found its way
into the dissecting-room, and another was
exhibited alive in London in 1638.
“Yarcoo” : With a view to providing water
for an occasional camp-out on a dry portion
of the property, the manager of a G.Q.
station sent out a 100-gallon galvanised-tank,
which it was intended to fill when rain
had replenished the shallow pools in
the near-by creek. This was dry when the
tank was taken out, and the thing, with its
tightly-fitting lid on, was left among some
prickly-pear on top of the bank. Three
months later the creek was filled by a storm,
and two men went out to fill the tank. They
found it two-thirds full of clear water. In
due course the water was used by a camping-
party, and reduced to a few inches. On the
next visit, although no rain had fallen, the
tank, lid still on, was again two-thirds full,
and this mysterious refilling process has con-
tinued for three years.
“Wai-lioi”: One of the queerest lizards
in Australia has its home on Iloutman’s
Abrolhos Islands (W.A.). Stokes, of the
Beagle, found it there in April, 1840. lie
kept two of the little lizards—they grow to
six inches only—aboard the ship for nine
months, and then gave them to the wife of
Governor Gipps. Lieut. Emery, after whom
Emery Point, the northern lead into Port
Darwin, was named by Stokes, took a third
specimen back to England, where it lived for
four years. The lizard is only a small eater,
a tiny bit of sponge cake having kept one of
them going for a month. It is quite harm-
less. but: its looks belie it, for the rings
of broad, dagger-pointed scales that adorn
its stumpy tail give it a wild appearance.
Stokes’s discovery of the lizard was new to
science, Gray, of the British Museum, nam-
ing the scaly one after him.
THE WISDOM OF SAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We used to yarn around the fire, and some-
one. would be sure to squeal
About some chap from whom he thought he
hadn’t got a dinkum deal.
And when he’d banged him good and hard
and various curses at him hurled,
“Ah, well,” old Sam the cook would say, “it
takes all sorts to make a world.”
There’s one would blast a nigger-driving boss
and swear he should be hung;
And one would rate a selfish mate, and one
revile a graspin’ Bung.
Sam had one comment, only one, as from
his pipe the smoke-clouds curled :
‘Ah, well,” he’d tell you, soothing-like, “it
takes all kinds to make a world.”
We all had grievances, it seemed, to dwell
upon, as fellows do,
Perhaps a stony-hearted dad, perhaps a girl
wlio'd proved untrue.
The yarns of being taken down were straight
or tangled, plain or purled.
“Ah. well,” old Sam would cap them all, “it
takes all sorts to make a world.”
The talk on politics would turn at times, and
rasping tongues would grate
On all the tugs and useless coots electors
send to serve the State;
How few the honest men who’re not into
some dirty business swirled.
“Ah, well,” would come from Sam, “it takes
a lot of chaps to make a world.”
No doubt there’s something in it, too. A
funny thing this life would look
If all were crook and none were straight, or
all were straight and none were crook.
The next time among thieves you fall, 0 r get
round someone’s finger twirled,
Take solace from old Sam’s remark: “It
takes all sorts to make a world.”

It isn’t comprehensive enough. A few-
more prohibitions are needed in view of
possible developments:—
The washing of clothes and/or dishes used
by picnic parties will not be tolerated. Baby-
washing is also prohibited. Laundries mix-
ing blue in the water will be proceeded
against; and cats are not to be thrown into
it. Any husband who attempts to drown
his wife in the water, thereby disturbing
the goldfish and water plants that may be
placed there some day, will be sued for the
full value of the injured inmates.
H'igh-diving from the head of the Apollo
is barred. So is fishing, whether with rod,
handline or dynamite. The basin must not
on any account be regarded as a swimming-
pool for elephants, and washing motor-cars
with the fountain water is likewise for-
bidden. No politicians to be ducked. Penalty
£5 fine and costs, including cost of disinfec-
tants for subsequent purification of the
polluted fountain.
In view of the possible breach of any or
all of these regulations citizens are warned
that the City Council accepts no liability
if citizens use the water for drinking pur-
poses.

I’ve been asking myself this for some time,
so last night I got down to facts and figures:
My smoking costs me 3s. a week.
My girl also smokes.
My drink bill is ss. a week.
My girl also likes a spot.
My clothes cost me 10s. a week.
My girl says hers work out at £1 a week.
I have a large appetite.
So has my girl.
I’m fond of children.
So is my girl.
And then there are tram-fares, tooth-paste,
boot polish and sundry other items to be
doubled, and later possibly trebled or quad-
rupled.
I’m still looking for the.bloke who told me
that two can live as cheap as one.
Resolved: If my girl promises to give up
smoking and spots, to eat less, wear less (if
possible) and to interest herself in goldfish
instead of kids, I’ll undertake to chuck
cleaning my teeth and marry her.

Labor Scramble. —
Take one soft job:
flavor with salary of

BEATING THE BOCHE.
“ ‘The first German spy to be tried and shot in
wartime was betrayed by his own dog,’ says Captain
Donald Munro, in his book ‘Scapa Flow.' ‘The
man lost the dog,’ Captain Munro writes, ‘and
advertised the fact in the local press. The police
found the dog, whose collar bore the man’s name
and his address in Berlin.’ ” —Sydney “D.T.”
“Gad!” chuckled that eminent war-time
staff officer General Sir Sherlock Holmes,
K.C.M.G. “The Boche was crafty, devilish
crafty, but we were too much for him.”
“I haven’t a doubt of it, sir,” said Major
Watson, D. 5.0., respectfully.
“Take our handling of Hans Breitmann,
the master-spy. ‘The Strange Case of the
Mislaid Dachshund,’ I call it in my War
History.” . . , , ..
“Might I hear the tale, sir?’ pleaded the
M “VVell. if you insist,” hesitated the Gen-
eral. “It w-as this way. We couldn t nnd
a clue to the feller’s whereabouts. Ihe
Secret Service was baffled, the Government
nervous, the W.O. fuming. All we had to go
on was the traitor’s pet dog, with his Berlin
address on it, and a ‘Times’ advt. offering
a reward of 15 marks if animal,
‘Kaiser’ by name, was returned to 200 hono-
square.” . , . .
“You were virtually up against a brick
wall, sir,” sympathised the Major.
“Quite. Yet British brain and grit won
through.”
“What steps did you take, sir?
“You’d never guess. Nobody would. 0 i
went into conference with myself tor
hours and then took a taxi to the address
given in the advt.”
“Yes?” . „
“Stopped the taxi outside.
“I follow you.”
“Knocked on the front door.
“Not on the back fence, or anywhere like
that?”
"No; on the front door. ’
“Marvellous! What next?”
“Asked the maid if Herr Breitmann, the
well-known spy, was at home.”
“Go on, sir.”
“Learned that he was.”
“Yes? Yes?”
“Sent in my card.”
“And then?”
“Went in and nabbed him.”
“Astounding!” ,
“Not bad staff work,” ad-
mitted the General modestly.
“Not bad!” echoed the
Major protestingly. “Why, it
was one of the closest bits ot
reasoning done by the mili-
tary during the Great War.
The General thought for a
few moments, and then. “Per-
haps you’re right,” he said
simply.

RUSSIAN WHEAT NO MENACE.
Far and away the best short account of
the wheat situation in Russia that has
reached this country is contained in the
recently-issued report of the Imperial Econo-
mic Committee, on which Australia has two
representatives—F. L. McDougall and C. L.
Baillieu. As the information is important
to all Australians it is here summarised.
Russian wheat is grown mainly in the
south, part of 'it in what is known as the
Black Earth Zone. This has a soil of great
fertility, containing up to 16 p.c. of organic
matter, and producing a luxuriant plant-
growth with comparatively little husbandry.
Rainfall is often the limiting factor, and
rarely exceeds 22in. For this reason wide
fluctuations in yield per acre often occur.
Grain-production in pre-war days, and
even after, was often carried on by means of
very primitive methods. As recently as 1927
the number of wooden ploughs in use was
very high—s 7.4 p.c. in the total cereal-pro-
ducing regions, 70 to 80 p.c. in more back-
ward districts. In spite of these primitive
methods Russia, led the world in production
and export before the war; average produc-
tion for the five years 1909-13 inclusive was
758 million bushels and average export 154
million bushels.
Production fell heavily during the war and
for years afterwards. It was only in 1926
that the area under crop reached the pre-war
average, 74 million acres. That was a good
year for wheat, and so was 1930-31, when 92.37
million acres were put in. The average
yield was 13.4 bushels per acre; the reported
increase was 383 million bushels —practically
equal to the total Canadian crop that year.
The gratified Communists planned to raise
the area sown in 1931 to 101 million acres
and in 1932 to 113 million acres ; but their
plans have miscarried.
Much has been said about the State grain
farms. The committee’s information is that
in 1930 there were 175. with a total
acreage of approximately 30 million acres.
Fifty State farms have an area of over
250,000 acres each; four exceed 500,000
acres each. But only a portion is culti-
vated; the State farms are estimated to have
accounted for 2.8 p.c. of the total area under
cereals in 1930 compared with 1.2 p.c. in
1928. In 1.931 the proportion was expected
to rise to 6.4 p.c.' Collective farms—groups
of individual peasant holdings operated as
one farm—constituted 271 p.c. of the total
number of holdings in 1930, and it
was estimated that in 1931 they would con-
stitute 50 p.c. Most of the collective farms
are associated with a central tractor station
which contracts for ploughing, sowing and
harvesting.
Many good people believe that the Red
Republic deliberately flooded the European
markets with wheat at a low price to “injure
capitalism.” The committee emphatically
rejects this belief. “So far,” it says, “from
regarding the low world price of wheat as
a condition of,affairs which the Soviet autho-
rities Jiave deliberately sought, we think it
is rather a condition from which they have
every economic reason to desire to escape.
It is probably true that Russia under her
present system can, in order to achieve cer-
tain results, disregard costs of production
for a time, but a policy of selling abroad
under cost must involve a sacrifice, and all
the available information points to the con-
clusion that she will not make such a sacri-
fice for longer than she can help. In 1930
Russia, no doubt, sold wheat abroad below-
cost by reason of the low world price, but
we do not doubt the prices then received
were a serious matter for her. as they were
for other exporting countries.”
Messages published in the London “Times”
since the committee’s report appeared are to
the effect that the Russians are having a bad
season—they had three running after the
Revolution, 1922, ’23 and ’24—that the
State factories are sadly behind with deli-
veries of tractors and the State grain farms
with deliveries of seed, and that the sheep-
like masses in the cities are suffering worse
privations than ever.
DIPPING SHEEP.
“H.D.8.”: Many opinions arc held as to
the correct time to dip sheep. In my judg-
ment the maximum benefit is derived from
the process when carried out four to six
weeks after shearing in the case of merinos,
and six to eight weeks after in the case of
crossbreds and longwools. Lambs can be safely
dipped after they are three months old, but
should not be allowed back with their
mothers until the ewes are dry. As far as
prevention of parasitic attack is concerned,
dipping off shears does not give such good
results as if done when there is wool on
their backs; and there is danger of arsenical
poisoning through shear cuts.
Some important points to observe when
dipping are:—
(1) Sheep should not be over-heated or
thirsty prior to dipping, as there is a danger
of scalding and poisoning.
(2) Don’t drive immediately before or
after the operation.
(3) They should not be full of food, as
they are liable to foul the bath. Yard
some time before dipping, but don’t crowd.
(4) Don’t dip during the hottest part of
day. as there is a chance of scalding.
(5) Avoid dipping in cold weather and
when there are indications of rain, as the
wool will not dry.
(6) Allow dipped sheep to dry in the
shade.
(7) Cease dipping in time to allow sheep
to dry before nightfall.
(8) Keep the bath thoroughly mixed dur-
ing the operation.
(9) Skim off the scum and grass seeds as
they form on the surface.
(10) Sheep should not be rushed through
the dip, but given time to become thoroughly
saturated.
(11) Use soft water w r ith powder dips.
(12) Heads should be immersed once.
(13) Allow sheep to drain properly before
removing from pens.
(14) Rams should not be allowed with
ewes until 10 days after dipping.
(15) Dip the big sheep first and the lambs
last.
BABY BEEF OR BUTTER?
“F 34” : “W.D.Mc.” (B. 30/3/’32) ignores
two of the reasons I gave for doubting his
claim that baby beef gives better returns than
butter, glosses over the third reason and con-
centrates his attack on my opinion that the
two might be combined. Let me ask again
whether the calves that netted £6 10s. per
head shared their dams’ milk with foster-
brothers, or had each all the milk of a fairly
good cow on good grass?
The ground that will carry 20 cows and
their calves up to eight months old will
carry only about 14, each with two calves
up to 12 months old.
The reason why “W.D.Mc.” has seen no
prime bucket-reared calves is that practi-
cally all poddies are either dairy-bred or
nondescript. Let him, if he understands the
art of poddy-rearing, try. a few Herefords —
not white-faced mongrels, but the first cross
of a good bull—and he will find, as I have
done, that they will amply repay his skill.
In fact, by reducing his valuation of his
foster-calves from £6 10s. to £4, he admits
that he has not seen a prime dairy-bred steer
even when raised on its mother. Moreover,
this discounts the value of cream in the diet.
Besides its fuel value, which can be replaced
by supplementary feeding, cream is import-
ant only as a source of vitamine A (abund-
antly supplied by good pasture) and D
(unnecessary in a land of sunshine). The
animal proteins which are essential to rapid
growth are supplied just as well by skim-
milk as by whole-milk. And so I say again
the cow that can rear one, two or even three
calves well by direct feeding can rear the
same number equally well by the bucket
route. Notwithstanding this, “W.D.Mc.”
credits the herd that is milked with only 20
calves at 355. per head, instead of 40. Then
he jumps the value of a dairy-bred steer from
355. at eight months to £4 at 12 months —too
big a discrepancy for most cow-cockies to
swallow. Incidentally, the touch about my
cows never going dry missed its mark. Had
“W.D.Mc.” checked my figures and read the
par. carefully he would have seen that I was
allowing a dry period of 10 to 11 weeks.
Each reader may judge for himself whether
bucket-reared calves are as prime as those
reared by the cows. That granted, the dis-
cussion must resolve itself into two ques-
tions. Is the return from butter sufficient
to pay for the labor of milking and calf-
feeding? Every man who stays in the dairy
industry answers “Yes” to that twice a day,
seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. The
other question is whether it would be better
to discard the dairy bull and use a beef bull.
That has been tried and condemned often
already, because beef booms and slumps more
than butter, and for every man who struck
it lucky six would be left with a herd that
is valueless as beef and useless for butter.
RUGS FOR THE COWS.
"W.D.Mc.” : Canvas rugs are the best, but
they are expensive. Barbed-wire takes a
heavy toll, and they are not easily repaired.
As good a substitute as I know is a rug made
from three manure sacks of a better jute
than the ordinary. The sacks should be well
cleaned when empty, then soaked in a lye
of washing-soda and water (lib. to a kero-
sene-tin) for about half an hour—that kills
the acid in the sack—and then hung out to
dry. Sew two sacks together lengthwise,
and one on the cross, with eyelets to take
the straps or ropes. Eyelets can be bought
for the purpose; still, if holes are cut and
sewn all round they will do almost as well.
For ties, five-ply of binder-twine, damped
and twisted tightly, makes a nice soft rope to
fasten the rug on with. I always make
them with leg-ties, a girth and breeching
with the usual breast-tie in front. A rug
made and fastened like this will never come
off or shift, and in about a fortnight will
become practically waterproof. You can
make them absolutely rainproof by paint-
ing with a mixture of 101 b. mutton-fat,
51b. Stockholm tar, 21b. resin and 21b. bees-
wax. Melt together; apply as hot and as
thin as possible in order to save material.
Rugs require to be adjusted for a few days,
as the ties stretch, but once that is over they
will stay put, and if not torn on barbed-wire
will last at least two seasons.
A lighter but good rug can be made from
two outsize peanut sacks or N.Z. rye-
grass bags. If necessary, they can be lined
witty a bran bag or dunnage, and with a coat
of paint, as above, will keep Strawberry dry
all the winter. These rugs will cost about
Is. or Is. 6d. each, plus the cost of making
them (a good wet-day job), and if one does
get torn or lost there is no need to worry
over the loss of capital. Rugging pays in
the saving of feed and keeping condition on
the cattle.
Rugs should always be taken off when the
weather is favorable, especially as spring-
approaches.
COTTON-SEED MEAL.
“Jack Point”: Queensland dairy-farmers
are fortunate in having such a rich con-
centrate available to them at a very low
price. Several grades are on the market,
all being made from the decorticated seeds
after the oil has been extracted ; differences
in quality and price are governed by the
amount of added cotton-seed hull bran. The
meal itself, without bran, contains 43 p.c.
crude protein and 7.5 p.c. crude fat. Such
a rich concentrate may become unsafe in in-
experienced hands, so varying amounts of
the bran are added (15 p.c. and 40 p.c. added
bran are two standard lines). This reduces
the protein and • increases the fibre content,
but even the cheapest line, with the 40 p.c.
added bran, contains 25 p.c. crude protein.
It sells at £7 per short ton.
A great point in favor of this food is that
it has value as a fertiliser. In other days
seeds in their untreated state formed the main
manure in keeping U.S. plantations up to
full productivity. The meal contains almost
a perfectly-balanced fertiliser for pastures,
and practically none of its manurial value
is lost.
HORSE COLORS AND STAMINA.
“Yarri”: In a number of mixed horses in
a yard, those that receive the first prefer-
ences of most buyers are the dark bays and
dark browns. These, whether hackneys,
coachers or heavy draughts, are generally
good and staunch. I put the dark brown
first as an animal that can generally be
relied on for hard work and a long journey.
I have ridden and worked horses of other
colors that were equal to any brown or bay ;
but as a general rule, taking the average of
a big mob, the superiority, though slight over
the dark bay, would be with the brown. In
numbers, all over the country, these two
colors are challenged only by the chestnuts.
A prospective buyer looks at the shape
of a horse’s head for intelligence, at the
eye for disposition, at the color and con-
formation for stamina. The chestnut takes
a high place for intelligence, and is good-
tempered and willing, but is regarded as
softer than those of other colors, with the
exception of the light bay. He is the hand-
somest horse, and as a hack the pride of
most riders. Some of them are hardy
enough. I rode a 14-year-old chestnut from
beyond Wooroowoolgen, on the Richmond,
across the Clarence at Grafton and down
to Sw T an Creek, 80 miles in one day, mas-
tered horses on him at Swan Creek station
next day, and rode him home on the two
following days. He was slightly roach-
backed, and stockmen there regarded the
roach-back as the hardiest-wearing of all
horses.
The chestnut and the creamy are favored
by lady riders, but you don’t often see a
man riding a creamy or driving one in the
plough. Occasionally creamy ponies are met
in a carriage capacity, and good, faithful
little trotters they are. Another seldom met
in saddle or team is the grey—or white.
(The white is almost invariably called a
grey, though there are real greys—light
greys, dark greys, iron greys.) Praises of
“the old grey mare” are heard here and
there on the farms; all the same, the grey
doesn’t occur very frequently among plough
teams. Greys and dappled greys make hand-
some teams for show purposes, and this
color is generally long-lived. A grey at the
Valley of Lagoons (Q.) a few years ago was
48 years old.
The black horse is a good animal for
steady draught purposes, but not. always to
be relied on at a stiff pinch. The worst
rogues and jibbers I have known were blacks.
They are not favored as hacks or hunters:
some judges say they haven’t the spirit neces-
sary for a hard finish or a tough journey.
Black draughts are common on farm and
road, but not black hackneys. The roan is
rather rare —generally slow and inclined to
be lazy. The most neglected colors of all
are the piebald (black and white) and tin 1
skewbald (bay and white), which are re-
garded as circus horses.
Color counts a lot in the buying and sell
ing of horses, even about the legs and head.
An old white-stocking rhyme advises: One
white foot, buy him; two white feet try
him; three white feet, look about him ; four
white feet, do without him. Most horse-
men do without the bald-faced nag; a blaze
down the face meets with only occasional
objections; a star on the forehead, which
occurs frequently in the chestnut, is an
attraction.
SEED SAVING AND SELECTION.
“L’Fou”: “Gardener” (B. 16/3/’32) advo-
cates selling and saving the seed from “crops
not worth harvesting.” Would he recommend
raising dairy heifers from cows not worth
milking? One of the greatest handicaps to
better production (and, incidentally, lower
production costs) is failure to select the
best available seed. Progressively carried
out, this means a constantly-advancing stand-
ard. Crop-improvement may be secured by
other means, such as better tillage, more fer-
tiliser and cleansing sprays; but the mos!
economical and lasting factor in better crop
production is better-bred seed.
The man on the land might well meditate
on the work of Luther Burbank. Australia
has much to be proud of in the breeding of
drought-resistant wheats (largely due to the
devoted work of Farrar and Pye), which
have driven the wheat belt further and
further out into the desert. But in the main
we have passed slovenly by great opportu-
nities. Many gardeners aver that there is
less reliability in buying varieties of seed
to-day than in pre-war days, when a great
deal of our horticultural seed came from
Germany. There choice strains of flowers
were grown under netting to prevent chance
fertilisation, or else hand-pollination was re-
sorted to. Australian nurseries usually rely
on isolation, which may or may not be
complete.
Then take grading. Buy a sixpenny packet
of beans. One might reasonably expect
plump, large seeds, as like “as two peas.”
My experience is that you get all sizes, and
often all shades of color, indicating that seed
was gathered in varying stages of ripeness.
As packet stuff works out at about Ss. a
pound, one might expect better. Further,
one should not stop at selecting good seed ;
it should be good seed from good plants. In
any plot you will find individuals showing a
quicker get-away, more thrifty growth, more
resistance to malign conditions, better pro-
duction. Those are the plants to be noted
and saved for §eed; the tomato that grows
best and ripens earliest, the spud with the
most even and most saleable tubers.
MAKING ORANGE-GROWING PAY.
“W.M.F.” : As a means of gaining a pleasant
livelihood few things equal orange-growing.
In the N.S.W. district where this is being
written the climate is ideal—no dust, plenty
of water, few flies, rarely many mosquitoes,
bright days, cool nights, no bad winds,
beauty everywhere. The same amount of
money invested in a stock-carrying property
would mean more work, heat, dust and flies,
or worms, fluke and wet feet.
That orange-growing can be made to pay
the following case will prove. Five hundred
navel and late Valencias were planted in
September, 1922. After paying carriage and
all selling charges the return in 1931 was
£453 14s. sd. And last year fruit was at
an exceptionally low price all through. The
returns for the previous year were slightly
better; the prospects for this year are at
least equally good.
It is difficult to give the actual capital cost
of these 500 trees, for the reason that the
orchard is only part of a larger holding.
The capital cost of the whole place stands
at £1903 10s. 3d. This includes interest on
all expenditure, charged annually, interest
also on the purchase price of the land paid
in 1921. The little orchard of under five
acres brings in enough to make the whole
proposition a paying one, without taking
into account what may be taken off the re-
maining 27 acres. The spot was chosen be-
cause of its sheltered position. Good stock

was secured. Drainage was properly at-
tended to —it is on a slope. The trees were
well planted, and have been fairly well looked
after, especially of later years.
Knife and plough have spoiled almost as
many citrus orchards as they have made.
Citrus trees have surface roots. These, with-
out which the tree cannot thrive and pro-
duce heavy crops, a too-common type of
orchardist spends a lot of time destroying.
Not satisfied with tearing up the feeding
roots he insists on pruning his trees. Orange
trees usually shape themselves. Only very
occasionally need a mis-shapen limb or a
water-shoot be lopped off. Leave the trees
alone and they will both grow better and
bear better. They must be fertilised, with
humus for preference, in most soils; but a
judicious mixture of blood and sulphate of
ammonia is very satisfactory. They must
also be sprayed—not too often, but trees
must be kept clean to produce good fruit, and
only the best will bring good prices.
The essentials for success are shelter, good
stock, drainage. Keep the ground elean
under the trees. Use the hoe and cultivator
freely, the plough as little as Feed
your' trees. At the present time only two
varieties are worth growing. They are
navels and late Valencias. If planting both
sorts give the best soil to the navels. Never
buy an orchard without seeing the fruit it
produces, and even then make sure you
know what you are doing.
PREPARING FRUIT FOR MARKET.
“Friar Tuck” : I recently paid a visit to
the Queensland agent to whom I consign my
fruit. He is an old hand; I myself have
known him for 21 years. He impressed
upon me the cardinal points in prepaung
fruit for market. , „ . .
First, grade carefully and pack fairly. I he
agent showed me two consignments of apples.
One lot, he said, would fetch top price; the
apples were evenly graded, and would go to
the country trade. The other lot was just as
good, but the fruit was topped, and he would
not sell without telling the buyer what he
was getting, or the buyer wouldn't come
back. So those apples would have to be
sold for what they would fetch; and the
grower would get less than if his fruit weic
uniform in size.
Second, never consign citrus fruit m halt-
bushel cases. This size is purchased only
by the small suburban shopkeeper of the
mixed-business variety, who wants nothing
less than 100 p.c. profit on his outlay. Hence
the price realised is often unprofitable to the
grower.
My friend maintains that the 10 p.c. com-
mission charged is excessive, and that agents
were better off on the 5 p.c. charged years
ago. When the commission went up they
were on a good thing, but many started in
the trade, there being no stock to buy and
little outlay. Agents who are bad holders
demoralise the market by selling instead of
holding for a fair price ; the grower is the
sufferer. The Government price-fixer has
several times been asked. to reduce the com-
mission to p.c. In vain.
A MYSTERIOUS BEE DISEASE.
“Orn”: “Azac” (B. 23/3/’32) has stirred
up all sorts of anxieties in the breast of one
Tasmanian beekeeper. For two years now
from one of my apiaries the bees have been
dying out unaccountably in a disastrous
number of the hives. In an apiary two miles
distant there was no such trouble. The
existence of Nosema apis was not suspected^
According to Bulletin 9 of the Ministry of
Agriculture, England, this disease is “caused
by a microscopic animal parasite, which
invades the cells lining the chyle stomach.
It is an infectious disorder of the adult bee,
workers, drones and queen all being liable to
attack. In the early stages of the infection
there is usually no sign of its presence; in-
deed the disease may be widely disseminated
among the members of the colony, and yet
remain undiscovered. The bees may be seen
to come out when in extremis, and, falling
over on the ground, to lie upon their backs
with feebly moving legs. Loss of queen is
frequent.”
Since in Tasmania the Government will
give no assistance to deal with the far
simpler disease called foul brood, it would
seem pretty hopeless to expect scientific
aid in this more complex case. Beekeepers
of N.S.W. and Vic. should be on the track
and, at any rate, dispel the uncertainty.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) Is hill country in the district hounded
hy Cobargo, Cooma, Dalgcty, Delegate.
Genoa (N.S.W.) suitable for sheep-farming?
(2) Best section? (3) Where is land avail-
able? (4) Acreage necessary to ensure
reasonable return? (5) Cost? (6) Carry-
ing capacity? (7) Is it preferable to grow
for mutton or wool? (8) Is climate or
accessibility to transport more important?
(9) Most suitable breed of sheep? (10)
Cost of flock? (11) Books on breed of sheep
recommended and sheep-farming generally?
—9104.
(1) Tablelands suitable; coastal districts
not suitable. (2) Delegate. (3) In all
these districts. (4) On the tablelands,
2000 to 3000 acres. (5) 30s. to £6 per acre,
depending on position and nature of country.
(6) One sheep to the acre with' pasture im-
provement ; one sheep to three acres on hilly
country. (7) Wool, unless intense pasture
improvement is practised. (8) Climate.
(9) Merinos. (10) Good ewes obtainable at
10s. per head. (11) Leaflets are available
from N.S.W. Department of Agriculture.
Is a ; wind elevator suitable for elevating
chaff into a chaff shed? Size, of fan and
tubing suitable for a 10 in. mouth-cutter
(three-blade knife wheel). —9113.
Should be quite satisfactory. A 2ft.
diameter blower and 7in. diameter tube will
be required. Clyde Engineering Co. will
quote you for necessary parts.
(1) Can pig-raising be profitably con-
ducted by grazing the animals on lucerne,
rape and' grass pastures? (2) What effect,
if any, have these crops on the quality of
the pork? (3) Is lucerne, by itself, an ad-
equate ration for a sow to rear her young on ?
If not what is the most economical food to
supply the deficiency, milk not being avail-
able? (4) Is fire-branding essential when
marketing pigs? (5) Is it necessary to
register an earmark for pigs ? —9036.
(1) Yes, provided grain, such as wheat,
barley or maize, preferably crushed, is
available to feed with the grazing. (2)
Pigs should be taken off lucerne at
least one month before slaughter, otherwise
it taints the meat. (3) Grain feed also is
required. Allow to each 501 b. pig 241 b.
crushed wheat, 41b. meat-meal and lib.
molasses; increase or decrease according to
size of the pig. (4) It is the most satisfac-
tory way of branding. (5) No.
How can I rid a farmyard and buildings
of fleas? —0128.
Spray the yard and interior of buildings
with a mixture of loz. soft soap, 14oz.
standardised tar derivative, 3oz. kerosene and
lgal. boiling water. Add soap to boiling
water and stir till dissolved. Then add the
tar derivative and mix. Then add the kero
sene, slowly, with continuous stirring. After
the lapse of two hours, carpets, fabrics,
bedding and clothing should be removed to
the open air and exposed to sunlight for
several hours. The floors and skirting board
should then be well scrubbed with soap, soda
and hot water.
(1) IF here is sodium chlorate obtainable?
(2) What is its everyday name? (3)

small j0b? —9193.
(1) Elliotts and Australian Drug, Ltd.
Sydney. (2) No other name. (3) 71b., Bs.;
lcwt, 755., plus 6 p.c. sales tax. (4) Not
for farm use. Might do for a small garden.
Using a Massey-Harris combined wheat-
sower and -manurer, what is the distance be-
tween rows of wheat and the average dis-
tance between plants? —9lso.
Between rows, 7in.; between plants, about
4in.; but it varies according to the rate of
sowing.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Walk-about”: Dead wool is hardly worth
the gathering at present prices, but there’s
no reason why dead carcases should be neg-
lected. Wherever they are found, gather
some sticks and logs and get a good fire
going on each. Only by destroying the breed-
ing grounds of flies will the maggot menace
be kept down.
“Wanganclla”: A worn-out pipe makes a
good top rail for drafting yards and the
like. Where wire yards are used the top
pipe rail does away with stays at the strain-
ers. Bore a large auger hole half-way
through strainers, and put the pipe ends in
before straining. You will find it a great
help on short strains.
“Floodmark”: One of my milkers devel-
oped an abscess. This treatment answered.
The hair was well clipped round the swell-
ing and a blister of mustard and warm water
was applied. When the abscess came to a
head it was opened at the lowest point to
assure drainage, and was syringed out fre-
quently with a solution of tincture of iodine
and water.
“Dimon”: It is said that many fat lambs
are rejected after being slaughtered for
export because they show inflamed spots or
bruises on backs and ribs. This is caused by
grabbing them by the wool —a common habit
in catching sheep. A big sheep grabbed by
the wool struggles to break away, and
damage is done to wool and animal. The
best way to catch a sheep is to place the
left hand under the neck or around the
muzzle, and the right hand under the off
flank, if the animal is to be thrown. To
steer elsewhere, hold, it by the neck and the
tail; to pull it out of a mob, catch hold of
the hind leg.
“Ivaraway” : Where there are many gates
to go through and bridges and shallow
streams to cross, a couple of nannies are
useful with a mob of sheep. The jumbucks
will follow a leader, and the goats will lead
anywhere. They are also handy when yard-
ing sheep, being easily trained to lead mobs
into the enclosure, and the sheep soon get
used to them.
“A.C.8.”; A disease often known as
grease-spot has been causing growers of beans
a deal of loss. It is bacterial blight, and is
often carried on the seed. As much as 85s.
a bushel has been asked wholesale for good
Norfolk Island seed in Sydney. Growers
are recommended to plant all seed in new
ground and to pull out plants showing signs
of disease and burn them. It is a curiou«
anomaly that, whilst the price of bean seed
has been prohibitive, the price of green beans
has been extraordinarily low. Thus the
farmer gets hit both ways.
“Cockyson”: Late autumn is about the
best time to sow lucerne —in Queensland, at
least. If the ground has been well worked
there is a better chance of obtaining a good
strike and beating the weeds than at other
times. But lucerne should never be sown
while grass and weeds appear within a few
days after the ground has been disturbed.
Land previously cropped should be cropped
at least once with, say, maize or English
potatoes, that can be kept weed-free until
maturity, before sowing lucerne. And it is
a mistake to put the harrow over lucerne
too early; the tines are as destructive to
the delicate plants as they are to the grass
and weeds. After the first cutting is early
enough.
“Johnno”: Rough handling in an orangery
when the fruit is dead-ripe is responsible
for heavy losses each year. Eggs could be
handled more roughly than some fruit
and escape damage. Oranges and man-
darins intended for immediate packing
should be allowed to sweat out in the sun
for a few hours, spread singly. This will
not affect the flavor, and it helps to toughen
the skin and evaporate some of its moisture.
And don’t, pack on a wot day if it can be
avoided, particularly if there is blue mould
in the orchard. The dampness seems to cling
to the fruit, the heat afterwards generated
speeding up the development of destructive
fungoid organisms.
Frank Maddox: I have no wish to contra-
dict. “Gallipoli” (B. 16/3/’32) if he still
believes that dry pickling gives immunity
from smut, but I know of a case in which it
was used for four successive years and
failed every year. I will guarantee to do
with Milestone anything that has been or
ever will be done with dry copper carbonate.
As long as farmers sow bunt-ball seed, no
matter how treated, so long will they grow
bunt.

varrying in N.S.W.?. —9225.
The vehicle used is subject to registration
under the N.S.W. Motor Traffic Act and full
taxation under the Motor Vehicles (Taxa-
tion) Act. In addition, if the vehicle picks
up passengers or goods in N.S.W. and also
sets those passengers or goods down in

is allowed in respect of commercial motor
vehicles whose operations in N.S.W. are con-
fined to areas within ten miles of the border
and which do not conduct a regular passenger-
carrying service in competition with the
railways.
How long will it take a student to get
the degree of Master of Arts or Doctor of
Laws at Sydney TJni., and cost of courses? —

The course for B.A. degree takes not less
than three years. The M.A. degree may be
taken two years after the B.A. degree has
been conferred. Fees for the B.A. course
amount to £Bl and the M.A. degree fee is
£5. The course for the LL.B. degree takes
four years. The LL.D. degree may be

and each of my two children 9s. per fort-
night. What is the position in the event of
my death (1) as a, result of my war injuries,
(2) from any other cause? —9133.
(1) Pension to widow would be increased
to £4 4s. per fortnight. If children were
over 16 pension to widow would be £2 7s.
a fortnight, but in certain circumstances
might be increased to £4 4s. per fortnight.
Children if under 16 would get £1 and
15s. per fortnight respectively. (2) Pen-
sions of widow and children would continue
at rates existing immediately prior to the
death.

preparation ? —BB7B.
(1) Dark tan, burnt umber or Bismarck
brown; light tan, yellow ochre ; tan, yellow
ochre and brown shade mixed ; black, lamp-
black. Aniline colors may be used instead
of above. (2) Combine the main ingredients
by heat, and when mixed remove from the
fire and beat in the colorings. The mixtures
are kept stirred or agitated until cool to
keep the colorings in suspension.
How to make a Leclanche ( sal-ammoniac )
ce11?— 9046.
The components of a Leclanche cell are a
glass container to hold a pint or a quart of
liquid, a zinc rod, often amalgamated with
mercury, and a porous pot containing a
carbon plate around which is packed a mix-
ture of 80 per cent, powdered manganese
dioxide and 20 per cent, of carbon. The
carbon plate projects above the top of the
porous pot whose top is sealed up with a
mixture of black wax and pitch, two vent
holes being left for escape of ammonia gas.
The electrolyte consists of a solution of sal-
ammoniac, 3oz. to one pint of water. This
solution is poured into the glass jar, and the
porous pot and zinc rod are then placed in
the liquid. The carbon rod constitutes the
positive terminal and the zinc the negative.
(1) How to prevent water dripping from
the roof of a greenhouse or bush-house? (2)
Does such dripping water have any bad effect
on young plants? —-8223-
(1) Some sort of gutter should be pro-
vided. (2) Yes, it is very harmful.
What is the difference between a gulf and
a bay? —922l.
Says Fowler’s “Modern English Usage”:
“Apart from the fact that each has some senses
entirely foreign to the other, there are the
differences (1) that gulf implies a deeper
recess and narrower width of entrance, While
bay may be used of the shallowest inward
curve of the sealine, and excludes a land-
locked expanse approached by a strait ; and
(2) that bay is the ordinary word while
gulf is chiefly reserved as a name for large
or notable instances.
During Melbourne celebrations oj the
Haydn bi-centenary somebody said Haydn
was the father of the quartette, the sym-
phony and the orchestra. Is that correct“I —
1)239.
Only as regards the quartette. Even if
the term “symphony” is given its modern
meaning, Haydn was preceded in this form
of composition by Stamitz, Emanuel Bach,
Christian Bach, Abel and some of the
Italian composers. The orchestra was well
developed at least st> years before Haydn
was born.
Are any of Verdi's operas save “Trova-
tore," “Rigoletto ,” ‘ ‘Traviata ” and “Aida" of
any musical importance, or worthy of study?
— 9237.
The four named arc the composer’s most
popular, achievements, but “Tin Ballo in
Maschera” and “La Forza del Destino” con-
tain some very beautiful melodies, while
“Don Carlos” and “Otello,” which are in the
matured “Aida” manner, are of very great
interest. “FalstafT,” Verdi’s last work, is re-
garded as the finest comic opera ever written.

ning liquors and how can it be prevented? - -
9240.
It is caused by organisms, which alter
the non-tannins (sugar) into a ropy slime.
A solution of three parts of sodium acetate
in 10,000 parts of tan liquor will prevent
the growth of these organisms.
llow and when did the U.B.A. acquire
control over (1) Hawaii, (2) Virgin Islands,
and (3) the Philippine Islands? —-9230.
(1) Annexed by request of the people of
Hawaii August 12, 1898. (2) By purchase
from Denmark, January 25, 1917. (3)
Ceded by Spain after war, by treaty dated
April 11, 1899.
What conditions must be complied with
before a person is allowed to enter (1)
South Africa, or (2) Rhodesia? —9232.
(1) The Union Immigrants’ Regulation
Act stipulates, among other things, that the
intending resident must have visible means
of subsistence for a period of at least 12
months. He must also be of good character
and free from contagious disease. (2) An
immigrant must show possession of £5O,
plus £lO for each dependant, or must prove
that employment for not less than six
months is open to him or that he is a tem-
porary visitor of reasonable means.
I wish to construct a wind-direction indi-
cator. The magnetic variation at Sydney
is given as Ddeg. 10 min. east. Should north
on the indicator be according to the com-
pass or on the Ddcg. 10 min. east point? - -
9149.
True north will be found 9deg. lOmin.
west of the north given by the compass.
If a bullet was projected, from the ground
straight up, and was allowed to spend its
force and return to the spot whence it came,
would it have more or less force and speed
on hitting the ground than when it started
on its journey (air resistance not taken into
account ) ? —9228.
Exactly the same velocity (and therefore
force) on hitting the ground as when it left
the ground. That is an elementary law of
dynamics.
(1) When and where was Braille born:
(2) How old was he when blinded, and how?
(3) Where educated? (4) When did he
start on his system to enable the blind to
read? (5) When was it adopted? (6) How
is the alphabet represented? —92so.
On Jan. 14, ISO 9, at Conpray, near Paris.
(2) Three; whilst playing with his father’s
harness-making tools. (3) School for Blind,
Paris, of which he became professor in
1826. (4) and (5) From 1819, when he
first entered the school. His first explana-
tory treatise appeared in 1829, and a more
detailed one in 1834. Though he was per-
mitted to teach “Braille” after school hours
it was not officially adopted until-1854, two
years after his death. (6) By variously re-
arranging embossed dots (maximum 6) on
three parallel lines
(1) I have had a little experience in mak-
ing etchings. How could I make colored
ones? (2) Is a colored etching legitimate?
—9253.
(1) There are various ways. The
simplest is to tint or color an ordinary etch-
ing after it is printed, or the plate may be
colored with colored etching inks before
printing. When inking the plate, ink up
in the ordinary way and wipe, and then
with a small stencilling brush apply the
color to the parts decided upon. The best
way is to make a different block for each
color in the same way as woodblocks and
process blocks are printed in color, and
superimpose one over the other; but a good
deal of difficulty is generally experienced
with registration on an etching press. Many
of the best etchers have experimented with
color.
Did Marcus Clarke himself rewrite “For
the Term of His Natural Life ” for book
publication after it had appeared as a
serial in the “Australian Journal,” or was
the work done by someone else? —926o.
So far as we can trace nobody but Clarke
had anything to do with the rewriting.
Charles Cavan Duffy has stated that Clarke
asked him to read the story in the “Austra-
lian Journal.” He advised certain altera-
tions, and Clarke said he would adopt them,
which lie apparently did.
I understand that a mechanical “eye” for
aeroplanes, which can find any airway
beacon at a distance of a couple of miles in
an ordinary fog. has been invented. How
docs it work? —92sB.
The device involves the use of photo-
electric cells. It is mounted in two parts
On the tail of an aeroplane. As the aero-
plane approaches a beacon the device indi-
cates by one set of signals whether the
beacon is on the right or the left of the
aeroplane, and by another whether the aero-
plane is approaching or departing from it.
The two sets of signals, together with alti-
tude readings, make it possible for a pilot
to calculate his landing exactly, ihe eye
can be set so as to select the beacon desired
from among hundreds of others merely by
the rate of winking peculiar to that beacon.
What, exactly, was the famous discovery
made by the late John Irvine Hunter, Pro-
fessor of Anatomy at Sydney l/m.f—J23J.
Il'is chief discovery related to the func-
tions of the sympathetic nerve system. A
few years ago it was believed that this
system supplied the involuntary muscles only,
but Hunter and N. D. Royle, of Sydney,
discovered, first, that sympathetic nerves
were present in voluntary muscles (i.e.,
muscles whose action can be controlled .by
human will), and, second, that their function
was to stabilise the effect of voluntary muscle
action. That is, if the impulse conveyed
through a spinal nerve to a voluntary muscle
places • the arm in a certain position, the
work of the corresponding sympathetic nerve
is to make the arm keep that position until
another impulse arrives. Consequently, if
a spinal nerve is injured at any moment,
the sympathetic nerve keeps the affected limb
rigid in the position it was last impelled to
take, and so causes what is called “spastic
paralysis.” Theoretically, therefore, the
severance of the sympathetic nerve would
release the limb —and Hunter proved experi-
mentally that certain cases of paralysis could
be thus cured completely.
Extent of trade last year between Aus-
tralia and countries with which we were at
war during 1914-18? Is the trade balance
in each case in our favor? —9249.
The figures arc for the year ending June
30, 1931. Austria sends us goods to the
value of £94,891; takes goods to the value
of £890; balance against us, £94,001. Ilun
gary sends £6641; takes £6; balance against
us, £6635. Germany sends £1.997,056;
takes £5.310.875; balance in our favor,
£3 313,819. Turkey sends £40.994; takes
£3988 ; balance against ns, £37.006. Bulgaria
sends £3772; takes £4B; balance again A
us, £3724.
To what extent has Shakspcarc provided
inspiration for foreign musical composers?
9251.
The most notable examples are in the
operatic field —“Romeo and Juliet,” by
Gounod, by Berlioz and by Bellini; “Othello,”
by Rossini and by Verdi. Verdi also scored
“Macbeth” and “Falstaff.” Nicolai’s “Merry
AVives of Windsor,” Ambroise Thomas’s
“Hamlet” and Goetz’s “Taming of the
Shrew” deserve inclusion. Outside opera
Schubert found in Shakspcarc material for
, a large group of songs : Mendelssohn wrote
an overture for “Midsummer Night’s
Dream” ; Liszt made “Hamlet” into a sym-
phonic poem; Tschaikowsky wrote music
around “Hamlet” and “Romeo and Juliet,”
Joachim did overtures for “Hamlet” and
“Henry 1V..” and Von Bulow composed
music for “Julius Ctesar.”
What are the common characteristics of
the verse forms known as rondeau, rondeau
of Villon, rondel and roundel, and how do
they differ? —9235.
In a rondeau of Villon, which is of 10
lines, the same refrain is used after the
sixth and the last verses. In a rondel, which
is of 14 or 13 lines according as it ends with
a refrain of the first two or only the first,
the first two lines recur after the sixth, and
the first two (or the first) only at the end.
The word roundel is, as ordinarily used, the
English for rondeau or rondel. They are
poems of fixed form (named as ending where
they began) with the common characteris-
tics that the opening word, words, line or
two lines recur at stated places, and that
all rhymes are set by the first two different
endings. In a rondeau, which is of 13
lines, exclusive of refrain, the first half-line
or less recurs as refrain after the eighth
and last lines, either or both. But it is
also applied to a metre of Swinburne’s, of
nine lines exclusive of refrain, with a refrain
of the rondeau kind after the third and last
lines.
(1) How long was William Cox building
the Penrith-llathurst road? (2) Was he in-
structed to follow the track laid down by
Evans? (3) How wide was the roadway?
(4) How many were in his working party?
(5) What route did it follow after leaving
Mount York? —9227.
(1) On July 18, 1814, he made the first
cutting down to the Nepean ford; on
January 14. 1815, he was forming the road-
way at Bathurst. (2) Yes, with such de-
viations as he might prefer. (3) The road-
way was to be 12ft. wide, the clearing
through timber 20 feet wide. (4) He had
a working party of 30, 20 of whom were
convict laborers. (5) Descending into
Hartley Vale and doubling southwards to the
Cox River behind Hartley, it then ran s.-w.
from Mount Blaxland to the headwaters of
Jock’s and Antonio’s Creeks, crossed the
Fish River near Hobby’s Creek, and reached
Bathurst by way of O'Connell’s Plain and
the Campbell River crossing at White Rock.
(1) Wav there ever a great violinist who
could play perfectly in tune (not on the
tempered scale) ? (2) Why cannot a piano
or an organ be tuned quite correctly?,- —9236.
(1) The scientist Helmholtz found that
Joachim, playing the scales unaccompanied,
took the absolutely correct and not the
tempered intervals. This gift, which con-
notes an exceptionally keen ear, is shared by
many good violinists, and there have been
many instances in which chamber music—
trios, quartettes and quintettes without piano
—has been rendered in just tones. (2) Abso-
lutely correct tuning would be impossible
without adding so many extra notes that the
keyboard would be unplayable.
What is the “ Overflow ” referred to in Pat-
erson’s poem “Clancy of the Overflow” ?--
9164.
The reference is to a cattle station which
took its name from a dam built across a
watercourse, with a dip in the centre for
surplus water to flow over.
(1) Where can I buy carbon granules
suitable for Reiss microphones? (2) Price?
(3) Where can T get two old telephone,
tra nsmittm's ? —9241.
(1) Ericsson Telephone Co.. 137 Clarence-
street, Sydney. (2) ss, per ounce. (3)
Try second-hand shops in Sydney. You can
get a pair, ucav, for 30s. from Ericsson Tele-
phone Co.

Blue North

H. Drake-Brockman.
CHAPTER XX ( Continued).
FORDYCE found much of interest in the
months-old news of the world. He
gathered from his lawyer’s letters that
it would be advisable to return soon, where-
upon he decided to try his luck a while on
the Western Grounds and thence sail direct
to Fremantle. Already the hold held close on
three tons of shell, which alone should
bring a cheque of nearly six hundred
pounds, and John optimistically valued the
pearls fished in Paradise as worth a couple
of thousand pounds, even without the gem
he had so magnificently cast away. Not
so bad for seven months, he decided, even
suppose he fished not another shell. He
wrote that he would be in Fremantle some-
time in April—not to make it too early,
for he might as well follow his luck.
Another letter informed him of
Euphemia’s impending departure on the
steamer Georgette for Melbourne, “where
I expect she will find society more to her
liking,” added his correspondent. John
looked round the tiny cabin and envisioned
Sophie without doubt asleep in his ham-
mock on deck. He had seen her creep out
some time ago, for it was too hot to sleep
in the cabin —muggy and close, and the
smell of the oil-lamp far from pleasant.
For all that, he liked his surroundings
better than any Euphemia would be likely
to encounter.
Wilson had received no mail; he sat
reading John’s papers.
“Do you remember those Fenians, Mr.
Fordyce?” he asked suddenly.
“Perfectly. Don’t say they caught them?”
However much he shared popular indigna-
tion at the manner in which the authorities
had been hoodwinked, John wished Collins
too well to hope his enterprise had ended
in ignominy.
“Not they! The danged rescals got clean
away to America. This paper has got a.n
account of all the things Collins said in
the press over there. And nice reading it
makes, too!”
He handed the sheet to John, who read
therein all Mr. Collins had told the Ameri-
can pressmen about his sojourn in Western
Australia. John chuckled when he came to
the message the tall Irishman declared he
sealed in a bottle and cast overboard to
be picked up and, he hoped, passed on to
its addressee. How like Collins! John
still treasured the memory of the doggerel
he had himself received from that gentle-
man on the very day there was such hue
and cry after the runaways.
“Listen to this,” he cried and read aloud
to Wilson :
“ ‘To his Excellency the British Governor
oj Western Australia.
‘“This is to certify that I have, this day
released from the clemency of her Most
Gracious Majesty Victoria, Queen of Great
Britain, etc., six Irishmen condemned to
imprisonment for life by the enlightened
and magnanimous Government of _ Britain,
for having been guilty of the atrocious and
unpardonable crimes known to the unen-
lightened portion of mankind as “love of
country” and “hatred of tyranny for this
act of “Irish assurance” my birth and blood
being full and sufficient warrant. Allow me
to add that
“ ‘ln taking my leave now, I’ve only to say,
A few cells I’ve emptied (a sell in its way);
I’ve the honor and pleasure to bid you good
day— .
From all future acquaintance excuse me, l
pray!’”
John lay back roaring with laughter.
He studied the paper again. “And they
quote here what the ‘Times’ had to say:
“ ‘That any American who has a sense of
national justice and self-respect should
exult in the success of such a paltry trick
for the evasion of justice is beyond an
Englishman’s comprehension!’
What a pity Mr. Geddes couldn’t think
up something like that for the chap Roberts.
That would have put him in his place! By
the way, what has become of that fuss ?
Have you heard anything in Cossack?”
“Yes.” A grin broke the severe lines of
Wilson’s face. “The skipper of the French
brig landed ’em all at Fremantle—and then
sailed off with the goods! That was an-
other sell, if you like!”
“What about annexing the Lacepedes for
America?”
“Oh, that’s still going strong, sir. Consul
come over to Perth and put in a claim for
£30,000 damages.”*
CHAPTER XXI.
Wherein Captain Mac Koo prays for
a willy-willy; and the Sea Sprite sails
for the Western Grounds.
Hullaballoo on deck brought John and
the mate to their feet.
“Captain Mac Koo!” exclaimed John.
An extraordinary sight greeted his eyes
as he stepped from the companion-way.
Babbet clung like a leech to the rigging
with both hands, but his lean body was
thrust horizontally across the rail, held in
the arms of Captain Mac Koo.
“Leggo! I’ll teach a rating to answer me
back! Leggo, I say, and I’ll swing you
over to Davy Jones!”
Mac Koo’s stentorian tones availed him
nothing. Babbet, well aware the captain
was in his cups and would not hesitate to
toss him into the channel of the out-running
tide, kicked and struggled and cursed, with
the muscles knotted in his arms.
“Hey, Captain,” called John spluttering
with laughter at the ludicrous sight. “That’s
my cook. If you feed him to the sharks
there will be no breakfast for you.”
“Cook?” inquired the old man majesti-
cally. He dropped Babbet so suddenly the
unfortunate fellow hung limply. “Return to
your dishes then, you morsel of unwashed
tripe! ”
John flung a warning glance to the out-
raged Babbet. “He’s drunk,” he said softly.
“Take no notice.”
“Thet’s jist wot I told ’im, sir,” vowed
an aggrieved voice, “an’ ’e didn’t seem ter
like it!”
“Who says I’m drunk? Of course I’m
drunk. I’ll drink any man in her Majesty’s
on the coast to a standstill! But for all
that, Mr. John Fordyce, I will not brook
such a statement from the lips of your
servant!” He rocked slowly on his feet as
he spoke, his pronunciation unimpaired, but
his voice treacly with dignity. “Your dis-
cipline is disgraceful. I come here as your
guest, to be met at the top of the ladder
by a creature who not only neglects to
salute me, but has the impertinence, the
damned impertinence, to say, when my foot
slipped owing to your inadequate lighting,
‘You’re half-seas over, Captain; have a care
or you’ll turn turtle and fetch up beyond
Jarman!’ Turn turtle, forsooth! I was
about to show him who would turn turtle,
but the undisciplined rogue refused to obey
my orders and leggo!”
“Come below, Captain,” grinned John.
“I’ll see he gets his deserts. Dismiss,
Babbet,” he roared furiously, and the old
cook retired glancing back and laughing
as he went.
“The truth is, I am celebrating,” an-
nounced Mac Koo, once in the cabin. “We
are alone, Mr. Fordyce? Then I shall
acquaint you with the real cause of my
over-stimulated condition. I have been
drinking to the loss of a fortune!”
“That sounds to me a poor business!”
“Very! But a man must do something
when he finds the cupboard bare. I had
three pearls, Three Graces I called ’em, as
pretty gems as ever been fished on this
coast. Now I have ’em no longer. They
have vanished, departed, kuddi-kuddied!
And I may tell you, between ourselves, of
course, my dear Fordyce, that on them I
have been financing my way. I’m damn
near ruined.”
“I am extremely sorry to hear that. \\ hat
da you mean—they have vanished?”
“into Baia Budson’s pocket as like as
not! They have been stolen. That is the
long and short of it. When I cant say,
although I have my own opinions. And as
our friend buys more stolen pearls than
anyone else, I’ll swear he receives em
sooner or later.”
“Can’t you do anything?”
“Not one finger’s turn. I should have
kept ’em closer, but I thought I had ’em
well hidden. Look after your pearls,
Johnnie, if you’ve got any! That reminds
me —there is something I want to tell you.
I can’t recall at the moment. Never mind!
Get out your glasses and drink to a willy-
willy ! ”
“The devil! What a toast! D’you want
Budson drowned?”
“Ha, ha! Can’t say I would mind,
though drowning is too good for the like
of Baia. But a blow, or a pearl found at
once, is the only way of salvation for me.
If I don’t get a stone in the next two
months I’ll pray to the Devil and count on
collecting insurance!”
“As bad as that?”
The old man nodded. John guessed
Mark’s whisky had loosened his tongue,
but wondered if he dare offer assistance.
Thank Heaven his pearls were safe and
sound! The best of them in the hidey-
hole known only to himself and Sophie, a
few others deposited in match-boxes
amongst his private stores. So Budson
added to his iniquities by snide-buying on a
scale big enough to become known for it!
A crying shame if the gallant and pompous
old captain went under!
“I’ve been lucky,” he began.
“So I’ve heard,” replied Mac Koo, whilst
John wondered how such news had spread.
“They call you Lucky Fordyce now a darn
sight more often than Handsome Jack!”
“Well,” said John reddening. “Would
you care to let me”
“Most assuredly not!” Slowly and de-
liberately Mac Koo balanced his glass on
the table. “You keep good grog, my dear
fellow. A little light refreshment every now
and again is all Douglas Mac Koo will
accept.”
“Have another!” said John. .
Midday found the Sprite standing away
to the south, bowling along towards the
familiar landmarks of Flying Foam Pas-
sage and Mermaid Straits. A merry party
lay on her decks, yarning, drinking, sing-
ing as the hours passed; and as the sun
climbed, so did the tales swell. Many a
burst of laughter eddied away across the
Indian Ocean, carried on the fresh breeze
that was speeding the Sprite upon her
course; and with the laughter mingled the
voices of the natives, crooning on the for-
ward deck as they squatted roasting turtle
steak; and once or twice it played with the
sweet light voice of Sophie raised alone in
song:
“As 7 was a-walking down Paradise-street,
A spanking fine girl I chanced for to meet.
This spanking fine girl then said she to me:
‘There's a dandy full-rigger just ready for
sea.’
That dandy full-rigger to Sydney was
bound —
She was very well rigged and very well
found —
But as soon as the clipper was clear of the
bar
The mate knocked me down with the end
of a spar”
Wilson came to his master at change
of the watch, his face longer than ever.
“The Malay is not aboard, sir!” said he.
“Wasn’t he here last night?”
“Yes, sir. He must have walked off at
low water.”
“That’s funny. Did he say nothing to
you?”
“Nothing. He always appeared content
enough.”
“What’s the matter?” inquired Captain
Mac Koo, issuing from the cabin where he
had slept off his melancholy celebration of
the night before.
“A hand deserted,” said John.
“Not that insolent cook?”
“No.” A smile curved John’s lips at
thought of Babbet deserting. He had
guessed enough of that worthy’s devotion
to Sophie to know that so long as the
Sprite sheltered her, it would carry Babbet
as cook. “Though you did do your best to
deprive us of meals. A Malay seaman has
gone.”
Mac Koo struck one hairy fist upon the
other. “Be danged to it! Didn’t I inform
you last night?”
“Nothing about him.”
The captain leant forward and put his
lips to John’s ears. “I saw one .of Budson’s
touts get bold of him up at the pub. They
went out together,” he whispered. “Take
a look at your pearls—if you have any
worth a price!”
John ran below. Was this what Baia
meant by saying he had better go south?
Did he plan to ruin him financially?
The pearls from Paradise lay safe in
their nests of tissue. John heaved a sigh
of relief; but he gritted his teeth with
annoyance on opening his locker to find all
his baroque and a few smaller pearls had
gone. Mac Koo was right. r l he Malay had
been got at. John remembered his shifty
eye and felt sorry he had not sacked him
long before and put on another white hand
—though white fingers and brown alike
often itched at the sight of those tiny
globes of light.
John, remembering Budson’s vow to get
even, felt it must have been made worth
the man’s while to see what of his master’s
take he could purloin. How insecure that
sort of thing made a man feel! Whom next
would Budson tempt?
“Gone?” inquired Captain Mac Koo s
deep voice.
“No—only some small stuff.”
“Lucky again! But you take my tip and
keep your eyes open. Many an honest
man is not so honest before he’s done with
pearls!”
The Sea Sprite worked her way to the
Western Grounds; in spite of his passen-
gers, John lowered the dinghies whenever
he sighted a likely-looking bank, or when
the tides compelled him to await their
assistance in negotiating some shallow pas-
sage. No one minded. Days and nights
passed pleasantly beneath the awning;
though the wind swept red-hot from the
shore and the sun rose like a ball of fire,
though the pitch was running on the open
deck and no one but a native could walk
the white planks with naked feet, so burn-
ing hot were they, the loungers in the
shadow enjoyed every care-free moment.
The boys were happy. They appeared to
have forgotten their dead mates; they
laughed and sang like children. Was not
the water warm and the diving easy on
shallow reefs? Had not the boss told them
that before many moons they would be back
with the Worrarra? Nguri dreamt about
his lubras and the icinda —such a fine feller.
ianda, that one! Meantime each tried to
beat the other at finding shell; and to break
the monotony they would catch a napping
turtle. Over he went in a trice, then
ignominiously upon his back was pushed
to a dinghy or the sandy beach of some
close-by atoll.
Red-gold days, blue nights. Hard work
and absorbing for John whilst the light
lasted; a pipe and congenial comrades till
the moon swam from the sea; and then his
hammock, swung apart from the others —and
Sophie. Sophie, white and fair as the moon,
sweet as the breath of spinifex, young and
fresh as the dawn. Sophie, his sprite of the
sea! , .
And Sophie? Life moved in a dream lor
her. Something of a martyr’s ecstasy, as
he holds out his hands to the flames and
sees Heaven, pervaded now her recollec-
tions of the past. Had not John said she
could never have been his love were it not
for her dreadful experience? And she knew
he was right. Well for the girl she had no
inkling of the part Bella had played in hei
idyll—she could still find no smudge m
the shining armor she girt upon her lover.
Life moved in a golden dream.
Babbet alone went about shaking his
head. “I tell yer wot, Missie,” he said to
her. “The cat’s left us. Went ashore at
Cossack. I don’t like it. Thet pussy fell
over at the very beginning of this ere
voyage, and, though I sez then it were very
unlucky, we fetched her aboard again and
’ere she stayed. And thet fond of yer she
wuz, too. But there she be —deserted alonga
thet yeller Malay, blarst ’im!”
Sophie laughed. “I’m not veiy surprised.
Babbet,” said she. “Puss was going to have
kittens. I expect she thought Cossack more
comfortable.”
“I knows thet,” replied the old fellow.
“Though where she found a father fer ern
beats me. Still, I seen plenty of kittens on
ships before now. It ain’t natural, I tell
yer. Thet cat knows something. And it
we strikes that Biter Budson agin, **
reckon we’re for it. ’Oo’ll the third be, 1
like ter know?”
Sophie’s laughter faded. She shuddered,
for all the hot air. “Don’t, Babbet, she
protested. “I hate to hear you speak like
that, and you know Mr. Fordyce would be
vexed. Probably we won’t see him anj
more.”

“The Bulletin’s” next serial is going to be different. It is by a
Collins-street doctor—an F.R.C.S., among other things-—who
prefers, for professional reasons, to use a pen-name; and it deals
with a subject which nobody but a medical man could handle in
this manner. “Johnny,” who provides the story with a title, is an
Oxford M.A. who has become a “dope fiend.” “Johnny, how-
ever, has better luck than most; he has a knack of falling among
friends, and the story, which soon quits Sydney for a cruise in the
Pacific, is a powerful study of the victim’s disease and his efforts
to beat it. It is one of the most gripping serials “The Bulletin”
has ever published.
The first chapters will appear on MAY 11.

She walked away, and as she went she
muttered under her breath, with her old
childish vehemence, an oath beloved of her
dear dead Peter —surprising words upon such
dewy lips; but the energy with which she
invested them bespoke considerable lessen-
ing of the fear which once held her so in
thrall.
In mid-December they sighted the fleet,
some twelve vessels working close together.
John Fordyce ran up a flag to say he was
out from Cossack.
Before he had time to furl her sails the
Sprite was surrounded by dinghies. Like
beetles they clustered round her white, slim
sides, the pearlers swarming up on deck,
leaving their crews to wongi over the sides
to John’s divers. Letters, papers, news!
Silence, broken only by occasional sigh or a
laugh interrupting the rustle of paper, in-
vaded the cabin after Sophie had shyly
distributed the mail.
On deck John watched the hatches re-
moved and the cargo hoisted. Captain Mac-
Koo came to say good-bye. The old
pearler’s mate sat among the men in the
cabin; his dinghy waited alongside. He
answered John’s anxious inquiry with a
shake of his head.
“Not even a blister! But a few days yet
remain till the end of the year—my tucker
will last till January is through! After,
who knows—l’ll tucker up somehow. The
gem may come—or the blow. Did you
notice the barometer this morning?”
“I did,” said John. “And I like it not!
I hope you will find that pearl, or allow
me”
“That is enough, Johnnie Fordyce!”
“Well, you’re the first sailor I’ve heard
praying for a blow, even in sport. Spare us
that willy-willy, Captain!”
“Take my tip and run for Coolgurra
Creek if she comes, me lad. That is the
safest spot on the coast.”
They smiled as they shook hands. “So
long, and better luck,” said John.
“No need for me to wish you luck, you
have it; but a Merry Christmas and as
good a New Year—l’m going down the
coast to-morrow. Good-bye, Johnnie For-
dyce.”
CHAPTER XXII.
Concerning a letter from the South
containing momentous news; also talk
of a wedding; and Bahbet’s dread of
the future.
Christmas Day! The sea shimmered
pale blue and silver, like the smooth satin
of a lady’s gown. So sheltered and calm
the ocean in the lee of islands and reefs
that John towed his dinghies, lashing in
the oars. The sun rose red and angry
through a thick haze blurring the land—
sure omen of a burning day. Like a drift-
ing gull the Sea Sprite lay motionless,
afloat on fairy seas. She had left the fleet
behind and run to the south. Her master
meant to inspect Coolgurra Creek; he dis-
liked the variable thermometer.
John Fordyce counted that day amongst
the bright moments of his life.
Babbet dished up a marvellous dinner.
Oysters, asparagus, roast turtle with haricot
beans and potatoes, and a plum-duff as
light as sponge and blazing in the most
orthodox manner. Indeed, he rose to the
height of serving coffee on deck—after-
dinner coffee in breakfast cups and with it
almonds and raisins, which last had taken
him many hours to sort from a dozen
packets riddled by weevils. Sophie sat in
state in a lounge chair John had long
before had the carpenter make for her,
and in front she stretched her slim feet,
regarding with awe and delight the present
he had brought from Cossack.
What to find Sophie for Christmas in
Cossack? A difficult problem for John to
solve, when pearls she loathed. Coffey’s
store held no more than the bare necessities
of life, with possibly a brand of choice
cigars or a valuable gun or two to suit
masculine taste; but never a trifle to
delight a woman’s eye other than beads
and handkerchiefs for the gins. Not a
present for Sophie—until Mrs. Coffey
remembered a pair of shoes which by some
oversight had come from Perth. John
backed his luck and took them—they
appeared about the size of the bare pink
feet he loved to watch.
Sophie was charmed by the ridiculous
things—ball-slippers of amber satin, with
high thin heels of jade. She tottered about
in bliss, and, with the beads and fan John
had given her long ago, fancied she must
certainly look as elegant as even Mrs.
Coffey’s long-dead mamma could wish,
whereas to John’s delighted eyes she
appeared as a flushed and excited child. He
was well pleased to lie and smile at her
artless affectations.
Babbet alone worked that hot December
day, for the schooner lay anchored in five
fathoms of clear water. A long, lazy happy
day, so perfect that a momentary fear
pierced the heart of John Fordyce, a dread
thought of the uncertainty of human happi-
ness.
Towards sunset a glimmer of sails showed
up; before long two vessels anchored close
beside the Sprite. One belonged to a man
who had been lying alongside John in
Cossack Creek, and had stayed behind after
the Sprite sailed. He came off now with a
bundle of new mail, for a ship had arrived
rom the South the day after their departure.
Sophie sensed something portentous in
John’s manner when he called her to the
cabin. Anxiously she scanned his set face,
glad to see it soften at sight of her.
“Come here, Sophie,” he said.
Obediently she stood in front of hini. He
placed his harids lightly on her shoulders
and asked a. question.
“Do you love me?”
“Oh John!”
“Very much, Sophie?”
She glanced up in fear lest he were about
to tell her he no longer cared himself;
then her swift smile flashed out. “Very
much, John!” she said, looking him straight
in the eyes, although she flushed and
trembled.
“Will you marry me?”
He felt a shudder run through her body;
her lips parted, the flush faded, leaving
her pale beneath the golden tan of her skin.
She stared at him in silence.
He shook her gently. “I’m asking you
to marry me, Sophie. It would be polite
to give me an answer!”
“Marry you?” she whispered at last.
“Marry you? Oh John, how is that pos-
sible? Have you not told, me”
“Sophie, would I ask were it not possible?
Answer me—will you?”
She flung her arms about his neck and
sobbed, and between the sobs he caught
her murmured assent.
“You see,” he went on, when she was
smiling through her tears, “Mrs. John For-
dyce didn’t like Western Australia, so she
left for the Eastern States on a steamer
called the Georgette. And it was wrecked.”
“Was she drowned?” asked Sophie,
aghast.
' “Yes.”
Poor Euphemia! What an end for her,
who had always so loved decorum! John
remembered suddenly an absurd dream of
his wherein she assured him pink was the
only color in which to be drowned. How
strange to dream that; whimsically he
wondered if indeed she wore pink'. Poor
narrow-minded, small-souled, beautiful
Euphemia! Yet how could he feel sorry?
Once indeed he had dreamed her white
hands held the keys of an earthly para-
dise, whereas she cared only for the worldly
fetters with which she sought to bind him.
Here in his arms was the sum of all his
dreams—little Sophie, his mate who de-
manded nothing, and whom he yet adored.
At last she stirred. “I am sorry; and yet
I Oh, John, how can I help but be
glad? Is it very wicked to be glad some-
one else is dead? I never once thought
that you might want me as”
“My wife! We’ll go in to Cossack and
not wait until we reach Fremantle. We’ll
start the New Year with a wedding!”
(To be continued next week.)
Anzac Day, 1932.
Oh, do tlie careless sea-winds ever dream
When they come home on sleepy summer
days,
To creep around the shores of little bays
Where, on the sands, boys’ naked bodies
gleam V
And do they in their dreams remember these.
The other boys who lived long years ago,
Who laughed and bathed and felt the salt
winds blow,
And slept at last by far Mgean seas?
But then, since sea-winds wander where they
please,
Perhaps they sometimes pass their time
away
Along Cape Helles or at Suvla Bay,
Where simple crosses face the centuries.
And then, perhaps, they bring us home again
The loves and dreams and longings of the
slain !
VICTORIA.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
“Horses for courses” is the least untrust-
worthy of turf maxims, and the liking tor
particular tracks seems to be transmitted.
Royal Sun (son of Sunstar, the 1911 Epsom
Derby winner) showed his first glimpse of
form at Moorefield. Sent to the stud, he
got in his first season a sturdy-looking brown
colt, High Sun, who, like the sire, is raced
by the Sydney hotelkeeper Trautwein. Show-
ing, as it were, an inherited familiarity with
the course, and, helped by Cook, cutting off
every corner, High Sun (5 to 1) got away
with, the Juvenile Handicap at Moo'refield on
Saturday, and must have lauded a good
stake for the owner, who has been lucky
of late.
The tote did not operate at Moorefield,
Mr Lang having applied his veto so that
Mr. Lyons might not collar the revenue. One
result was that hundreds of ladies went else-
where for recreation; another, that 50 or
60 people, some of whom doubtless needed
the money, lost their day’s work. An un-
expected consequence was that McSho’rtodds
“opened out” a bit. On the Kogarah Stakes
he called 5 to 1. the field —an almost unheard-
of thing in connection with a race of this
kind with only 13 in the field. The favorite,
A’Ravir (Biplane—Anglet), got the best of
an interesting struggle with Servius and Sir
Ewan; Irish Eyes, badly away, was just
Bert’ ‘‘'Where did tract one <ao ?"
<SERT i *1 OONT KNOW"
Bert'/ / Whv didn't you watch it?"
GtERT Because I Didnt think.
IT WAS GiOING, A.NVWHERE r
behind the place-getters, and may be seen
to advantage in a middle-distance handicap
when the company is not select.
E. F. Walker, who has hitherto had a bad
season, was repaid to some extent for his
patience with Gloriole by seeing the fashion-
ably-bred filly (she is by Heroic —Gloaming s
Sister) capture a division of the Flying
Welter. She was favorite at 5 to 4; lufi
San, the second favorite, looked like giving
her some trouble but was interfered with,
and Orby Anthus ran second. Vallage (4 to
1), successful in his previous Moorefietd
start, took the second division after a great
race with Charalf (7 to 2); the favorite,
Watch Officer, was never sighted.
It was 7 to 1 bar one in the Anzac Relief
Handicap, the barred one being Black Doug-
las, another horse with a proved partiality
for Moorefield. The big black Rosendale
gelding is a bit bad at the barrier these
days, but Ivnox moved him out smartly
enough, and a fast run past the leaders at
the home turn made victory assured. Gal-
lant Top. an outsider, was second, and Exact
—well backed—third. Ethics flattered Ins
supporters for a time, but could not come
on. It was a day of slow times; Black
Douglas took 2min. Oisec. to traverse 10
furlongs.
The Carlton Handicap was another
spirited betting race. Trenette (Treclare—
La Bergeronette) won from Heroics solidly-
built son Herolage; and punters who did
not share in the commission which brought
the price from eights to fours remembered —
too late—that she also had run her best
races at Moorefield.

Melbourne has experienced its third suc-
cessive wet week-end; 125 points fell at
Caulfield between midnight on Friday and
7 a.m. However, A. V. Hiskens, secretary
of the V.A.T.C., is for “business as usual”
if it is possible to race, and he had his
reward when the afternoon broke compara-
tively fine. The programme was carried
through as far as the fifth event without
people needing to unfurl their gamps. Then
the sky became black as ink, pouring rain
befogged the six-furlong starting-point, and
you paid your money and took your choice
as to what was leading in the Brighton Han-
dicap until the field was half-way down the
straight.
It says a lot for the recuperative powers
of the tracks that the heaviest-weighted can-
didate in the Khartoum Hurdle was success-
ful and the place-getters in the Brighton
Handicap carried 2, 3 and 1 saddle-cloths.
Taciturn, the favorite, scored most attrac-
tively over the little sticks. He had the
services of Bob Inkson, who won the last
Grand National Steeple on Rakwool for
E. Y. Sheil, the owner of Taciturn. This
horse is by William the Silent, and takes
after his sire in color, being a chestnut,
but is much bigger. He came at the right
end of the race and won easily from Clar-
onga, a very promising novice, and the well-
supported Honorium. Two days before he
steered Taciturn to victory Inkson won
over hurdles at Mornington on More Noise.
The Neerim Steeplechase triumph of
Jumna was interesting. He is a halt-
brother (by Sarchedon) to Mosstrooper, who
landed the Australian Hurdle and Austra-
lian Steeplechase of 1929, and in the follow-
ing year carried off both “Nationals’’ at
Flemington and the Australian Steeplechase
at Caulfield. Gus Powell bought Jumna
from the breeder of Mosstrooper, and has
spent two years in converting him into
a timber-topper. He will have both Moss-
trooper and Jumna to represent him m the
cross-country field this winter. Jumna came
home with a lot in hand from the pony
Jack’s Jason, who cut Giff out of third
place.
Oratory (Verbius— Gallantry) restored his
breeder, Sol Green, to the list of winning
owners by taking the Katandra Two-year-
old. After being badly left he put in an
astounding finish to win by a head from
Ruach, who was only half a head in advance
of Lady Trivalve, one of the few smart
horses that Trivalve has sired to date.
Ruach was nearly as badly served as Ora-
tory at the start.
King Mart, who had shaped wretchedly in
the Five Hundred at Ascot a week before,
caused consternation in the hearts of pun-
ters by carrying the steeplechase jockey E.
Webster to victory in the Glenhuntly Handi-
cap This was such an open-betting
event that odds of 10 to 1 were offered on
the field at one stage. Miss Arrow, owned
by H. Alan Currie, of the V.R.C. committee,
ran away with the Glenferrie Handicap,
second place going to Gesto, who was suc-
cessful at Mornington on Thursday and is
getting back to the form that enabled him
to win at Randwick. The Brighton Handi-
cap went to old Highland (14 to 1). He
is far from being the galloper that once
beat Gothic, but has a race or two left in
him still.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The back-slam, which brought fame to
Jonn Pesek when that great wrestler was
here a few years ago, reappeared at Leich-
hardt Stadium last Saturday night when
Tom Lurich (14.2) used it to put Alex.
Lundyn (13.10) out of commission. Lurich
did not display his usual speed, and Lundyn
made the Russian surrender a fall in the
third round. The lighter lad’s clever wrest-
ling also won the next, but in the fifth
Lurich soon trapped his man into position
for a slam, and, falling heavily on his foe,
finished him for the night.
Footbrawl
The N.S.W. football season opened offici-
ally in Sydney on Saturday, and the coming
international programme ahead of both the
Rugby codes helped to draw exceptional
crowds. The Union match of the day was
between Randwick, premiers the year before
last but in poor form last season, and Manly,
close runners-up for the 1931 premiership,
won by Eastern Suburbs. Flayed on the
Manly ground, the game was full of dash and
incident, Randwick winning a close and
hard-fought tussle by 13-11 (3 tries, 2
converted, to 3 tries, one converted). Both
sets of forwards excelled themselves, with
the bigger Manlyites rucking the better and
shining in the line-outs. Both back lines
on occasions showed pretty and effective com-
bination, with Randwick the better all-round
in this department. Hodgson played a great
game in the losing pack, and the interna-
tional Palfreyman offset him in the opposi-
tion. Well served by his hooker, Sid Mal-
colm was the outstanding back, though
Westfield, the Randwick last line, ran him
close. Macmalion, of Randwick, and Gosson,
of Manly, were new centres who shaped most
promisingly. Other' results: Eastern Suburbs
32 St. George 6; Northern Suburbs 20,
Uni. 9; Western Suburbs 21, Drummoyne 13.
Those old rivals Western Suburbs and
South Sydney provided the Rugby League s
star turn at the Sports Ground and drew a
crowd of 15.000. It was hard and excit-
ing all through, the Westerners taking a
narrow win by 13-12 (a try and 5 goals
to 2 tries and 3 goals). They deserved
their extra point, for from halt-time they
played a man short, hooker R. McMillan
retiring with a broken collar-bone. The
tackling of the winners, who have come on a
lot under the eye of ex-international Jim
Craig, was exceptionally accurate and
severe. Nevertheless, South Sydney led by
7 points well on in the first half; great
goal kicking by Pearce (3) turned the tide
while his comrades held off the red-and-green
onslaught. The veteran Ben Wearing was
South’s outstanding back, and landed 3 goals.
There was nothing to chose between the
forward divisions. Perhaps the best player
on the ground was West’s centre, Cliff Pearce.
Other games resulted: Uni. 17, Newtown
16; Eastern Suburbs 15, North Sydney 7;
Balmahi 11, S:. George 4. *
“Stand Off”: The N.S.W. Rugby Union
has received a tentative invitation for an
Australian team to tour Japan. G. Yana-
giya, whose name is well known in connec-
tion with baseball in Japan, is the originator
of the idea, and adds that the. Japanese
Vice-Consul for Australia, 11. Ohta, who
played the amateur game in Britain, is
anxious to lend a hand. Last season a Cana-
dian team toured Japan and had a glorious
time. That part of it may be taken for
granted, but the question is whether the Nip-
ponese Rugby standard is high enough to
justify the tour in that country of any Aus-
tralian Rugby side above the picnic class.
We had a Jap team on a flying visit in Aus-
tralia a few years ago. Though plucky, the
players had not acquired the Rugby sense,
and they gave good judges the impression
that they never would acquire it.

“Amateur Pro.”: A lot of publicity has
been given by the Sydney press of late to
the huge expenses of that super-amateur
organisation the Rugby Union. One item
that sticks in the writer’s gizzard is th<;
expenditure of £6OO for “uniforms and boots.
It is further stated that the Union will
have to pay a lot of extra money next sea-
son for “outfitting” the Australian team for
South Africa. As a purely amateur sport,
the Union should not countenance this sort
of thing. Once upon a time it was under-
stood that, but for travelling and lodging,
which included washing, the amateur rep.
of those days found himself in everything
but his inter-State jersey—that was the only
thing he got from the State he played for.
Boots, stockings, knickers —all this applies
to Queensland, since the writer was not
familiar with N.S.W. methods —were provided
by himself. He found his own pocket-money,
also, there being no issue of baksheesh dis-
guised as “wine allowance.” Yet, speaking
as one who took part in tours of Maori-
land and N.S.W., no one ever suffered any
particular hardship because they played the
game for the game alone.
ft ❖ ❖ *
“Hot Air”: It looks as if the N.S. W.
Rugby League has taken the wrong turning
in refusing the broadcasting companies per-
mission to put the big games against the
Englishmen and Queensland over _ the air.
The companies threaten in retaliation to
ignore the League’s existence, and if that,
attitude is maintained it promises to turn
out badly for both parties. It is very doubt-
ful whether broadcasting games or races
takes a pound away from the gates. It cer-
tainlv increases interest in the games or
the races among people who would never
otherwise have anything to do with either.
Further, the League is in a cleft stick in
the matter of the Sydney 0. G., whose
trustees control broadcasting rights, as then'
cobbers of the Melbourne C. G. do.. The
League intends to play most of its big
matches against England on the S.C.G., and
must either shift to other grounds or humbly
submit to having them broadcast.
... :]• i’fi '<■
“Stung”: Those N.S.W. country foot-
ballers who are thinking about going to law
over a football trophy (B. 13/4/’32) would
do well to think it over, since in the long
run it would probably be the lawyers and
not Temora or Tumut that would own the
cup. Better to take a leaf from the book
of Mayor Primrose, of North Sydney. He
recently had to decide whether the Rugby
Union or League should have the North
Sydney Oval for the first match of the
season. The claims of both were so well
balanced that his Worship couldn’t make up
his mind. So, with the consent of the
parties, he tossed heads for the League and
tails for the Union. The first-named won.
* * *
“Richmond” : It is most unlikely that the
alteration in the out-of-bounds rule in Aus-
tralian football proposed by Victoria (B.
13/4/’32) will become an accomplished fact
this season, since the six States, holding
almost as many differing opinions, are
considering it. ' A majority . vote will
decide the issue, and at best this cannot be
decided until about half-way through the
season —a most unsuitable time to swap
horses. South Australia is all for a return
to the rules of 1924, and a section of the
executive has actually been talking about
seceding from the Australian Football
Council.

Footbrawl
“Old Q.”: Australian Rules authorities
in Brisbane are in a bit of a quandary.
When a Queensland team went to Melbourne
two years ago, the Queensland heads, well
aware of the poaching proclivities of the
southern clubs, got their players to sign a
bond that they would not be tempted to take
up their abode in the land of Canaan, so
to speak, and, further, that they would con-
tinue to play the Australian code as some
measure of return for the free trip afforded
them. More than one of these serfs has
shown an ungrateful tendency to go over to
other football codes. The application by one
such for a clearance the other day brought
matters to a head, and legal advice is to
be sought.
•!• •!* v ;|s
“Glenelg”: South Aus. is a noted feeder
of football talent to other States, but
this year the exodus is more serious
than usual, no fewer than five of last
year’s inter-State men having hopped
it to Victoria or Westralia, while a number
of the clubs have also lost leading players
to the same quarters. However, as most
of the men who have gone foreign are in
the veteran class or approaching it, matters
are not so bad as they appear, since the
vacancies will give some of the young entry
a chance to show the stuff that is in them.
* * * *
Allan Oxlade, who died in Brisbane at 50
last week, was long prominent in busi-
ness and sport. He will best be remembered
as one of the finest Rugby Union forwards
turned out by the northern State. Do'nning
the maroon jersey in 1902, he played con-
tinually for the State until business carried
him for a time to the Far North, and on his
return to Brisbane took up the game again,
his last match for Queensland being in 1912.
He represented Australia against Bedell-
Sievewriglit’s British side of 1904, and
against the All Blacks in 1905 and 1907.
* * * *
“Lancaster Park”: The All Blacks showed
discretion as the better part of valor when
considering the motion by Canterbury Pro-
vince to withdraw from affiliation with the
International Rugby Board if representation
on that body continued to be refused them
(B. 13/4/’32) . After a. long discussion, the
M.L. Union decided to accept all the rulings
of the British authorities. The All Black
wing forward will vanish, and the scrum for-
mation advocated by the British will be
adopted with other changes. The news was
welcomed in Australia. Refusal to affiliate
would have left M.L. high and dry, with
the result that Australia would also have
had to break away or drop the meetings
with its cousins across the Tasman which
have lasted for so many years.
* * * si:
“Gate”: With vivid memories of the visits
of previous English professional football
teams, followers of the Rugby League code
in N.S.W. and Queensland are looking for-
ward to a delightfully exciting and stoush-
ful season. So much so that one of the
Sydney journals has issued a solemn warn-
ing to local players to turn the other cheek.
Further, a clerical gentleman wants the visi-
tors to be told that international football
must not be allowed to degenerate into “bung
rules,” as it has done too often in the past.
It is a pious aspiration, but the first to be
shocked by such a Quakers’ meeting as that
envisaged would be the public, which finds
the money. The biggest crowd that a Rugby
League match ever drew in M.L. was at
Christchurch, following on a Test between
the last English team and the M.L. League
at Dunedin which was a welter of stoush.
Many thousands who had never seen League
football attended the Christchurch festival
in joyous expectation and went home the
most disappointed mob in creation. Both
sides had been converted in the meantime.
Racquet and Bawl
“Hotham”: By all accounts, the Austra-
lian Davis Cup team kicked off well in the
matter of finance. Their exhibition at Auck-
land, where the inhabitants are as bad as
those of Dunedin at stopping away from
any show they cannot see from some com-
manding eminence for nothing—and Dun-
edin, by the way rejoices in many more emi-
nences than Auckland —their show, I say,
brought in the nice little cheque of £75 to
the A.L.T.A. Honolulu and California should
also contribute their proportion of chicken
feed before the serious business begins, and
at the worst, win or lose in the American
zone, hasn’t Wimbledon put up 500 of the
best for our mob to' show there?
* * * !|t
“Cut Shot” : • There are 30 entries—the
same number as last year—for the Davis
Cup. The opening' games in the first half of
the European zone will be Hungary v. Fin-
land, Germany v. India and Austria v.
Czechoslovakia, Britain having drawn a bye
in this round. In the second half Japan
has a bye, and the contestants will be Monaco
v. Norway. Italy r. Egypt and Belgium v.
Switzerland. Britain’s most formidable oppo-
nent in the first half would seem to be Ger-
many, but Perry and co. should win. In
the second half Japan looks the goods.
* * * *
“Top Spin” : Bill Tilden, who has some
qualifications to judge, is tipping England
to lift the Davis Cup from France this year.
William, now so fast approaching the mil-
lionaire status by reason of his travelling
professional tennis “circus” that he is likely
to be kidnapped at any moment, says that
“Bunny” Austin will prove the sensation of
the Davis Cup tourney. Maybe, but we
seem to have heard that one before. To be
blunt, “Bunny” is in our own Jack Craw-
ford class. When he’s good, he’s very, very
good, but when he’s bad, he’s a fair cow—in a
tennis sense, of course. Tilden, too, says
he is willing to bet real money that the
Americans will obliterate our Davis Cup
team, and it would be hard to find anyone
willing to lay odds that lie is wrong.
❖ :jc * %
“Cash Amateur” : A good deal of guff has
been bandied about in tennis circles concern-
ing the decision of some of the Davis Cup
countries to remove the ban on professional-
ism from some of their players in order to
allow them to take part as amateurs in file
Cup tourney. Specially mentioned is Ivozo-
luh, who used to play for Czechoslovakia
as an amateur.' “Koz” is now, and has been
for some time, a member of Tilden’s profes-
sional tennis party, which has been raging
up and down the United States and raking
in shekels by the sackful. That the Czecho-
slav should leave such a good wicket to
return to the sticky pitch of amateur tennis
is a thing not to be believed by anyone who
knows his breed—especially when it has
been sharpened up by contact with American
get-rich-quick methods.
The Nineteenth Hole
E. W. (“Slip”) Carr, who recently
attracted golf attention by winning a South
Coast championship at Bateman’s Bay
(N.S.W.) is a versatile athlete. As a
sprinter he twice figured for Australia at the
Olympiads, and he represented his native
land as a Rugby Union three-quarter against
the All Blacks and the Springboks. In addi-
tion, he was an exceptionally good amateur
boxer and came close to playing tennis for
N.S.W. H'is dad, “T.P.,” was a hefty
winger also in his time, and played for
Queensland against N.S.W. and Maoriland
at the end of the 1880’s, besides represent-
ing the State against Stoddart’s British
team of those days. He was a pretty useful
cricketer, too, of the now vanished type
that used to “ ’it ’em ’ard an’ ’igh an’ or fen,”
*i ;
“The Mcllaggis”: One of the trials a
Scotsman has to suffer is the frequent
attempts made by the despised Southron to
speak in the Scots tongue. There was
a distressing instance in a Sydney evening
paper, which reported that Royal Wimbledon
had at last consented to admit women mem-
bers—for week-days only. Under the impres-
sion, apparently, that Royal Wimbledon is a
Scottish institution, the individual responsible
appended to the news item a string of gibber-
ish supposed to be Scots. Treating that
with the contempt deserved, I must point
out that R.W. is situated quite close to
London, and that its chief claim to fame is
that it is o'ne of the oldest of English golf
clubs.

finally sent him for a long spell in bed, which
has only just elided. However, he intends to

enter for the Australian championships in
Adelaide next August, and should have picked
up his best form by then. Stewart has won
the Australian open championship as well as
the professional title, and is also a Victorian
professional championship winner.
* * t- *
“Worm Cast” : The old adage, laid down
by Willie Park in the long ago, that golf
matches were lost and won on the putting-
green, was once more borne out at the tour-
ney for the Roehampton Cup. Eight of
Britain’s leading professionals failed to qualify
for the final for no other reason than atro-
cious putting. All were members of the Ryder
Cup team which got such an unmerciful hid-
ing from the Americans at Eakeside last sea-
son. When men like the Whitcombe brothers,
Compston, Abe Mitchell and others lose
from two to three strokes on the green, it
seems about time they were taken in hand
by one of their caddies for a little coaching.
As one critic noted, after witnessing the
debacle, there were more short putts missed
in a single round than Hagen or Jones
would miss in a year.
$ $ * *
“Divot Digger”: Australian golfers have
been showing an inclination to follow the
American lead, and scrap their trusted old
hickory-shafted clubs for the modern steel
contraption. It is gratifying to those who
kept their faith in the wooden shaft to find
that the consensus of ( opinion is swinging
back to it. Hagen, though he had a few steel
clubs when in Australia, made no secret of
his preference for hickory, and leading
players who have tried their luck with the
metal are going back to the old love. Abe
Mitchell, the great British player, gave the
steel a season’s trial and has returned to the
wood. The mighty Bobby Jones has never
wavered in his preference for the wooden
shaft, and Joyce Wethered is of the same
mind. The chief complaint against the steel
shaft is that it tends to rigidity and has not
the life and “play” of the hickory.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: The news that American engi-
neers are building two new cars to beat his
world’s speed record has caused Malcblm
Campbell to sit up and take notice. He is
particularly keen on being the first man to
travel at 300 m.p.li., and is having a 2500-
h.p. super-charged Rolls-Royce Schneider
Cup engine put into the old Bluebird. This
is the same type as that with which G. H.
Stain forth recently reached a < speed of
408.283 m.p.h. in the air, and Campbell will
have a go at new figures, probably at Day-
tona, in 1933.
“Differential” : A quaint yarn comes from
America concerning the beginnings of the
Packard car. It .seems that the original Old
Man Packard bought a car in the spacious days
of 1898 and started off to drive it 50 miles
to his homo. By the time he arrived there,
pulled by a farmer’s plough-liorse, lie and
the car had suffered all the possible vicissitudes
attending on owners of early-day cars. One
of the worst of these was the bursting of
a tyre, which contained a mixture of glue
and feathers, guaranteed to neutralise any
puncture. When the tyre hurst the mixture
blew all over him, with the result that when
Packard got home his family concluded he
had been tarred and feathered. When he had
been cleaned up, the sufferer wrote to the
head of the firm which had sold him the car
suggesting several improvements. “If you are
so clever, Avliy not build a car yourself?”
was the reply. Packard did.
* * * •!=
“R.V.K.”: “Kick Starter” (B. 23/3/’32)
speaks of an innovation in motor-cycles, but
appears to be misinformed in one or two
particulars. Tests proved that the water-
cooled engine, with its side radiators, made
the whole machine too unwieldy, and the
water-cooled was scrapped in favor of an
air-cooled unit operated by camshaft. The
double rear wheel was condemned and re-
placed with a single wheel with left-hand
shaft drive. Road tests established that the
’bus in its present form is capable of sus-
tained road speeds of over 80 m.p.h., with
petrol consumption somewhere about 60
miles per gallon. Vic. Wlmrdle, a former
Bananalander, was the first tester to put
the queer motor-cycle through its initial road
tests.
Miscellaneous
One by one they are all passing out, the old
rowing enthusiasts of the ’seventies. The
latest to cross the Styx is Dinnie Garvan,
who, with brother Jim, Bob Sheridan
and Tom McGrath, won the N.S.W. cham-
pionship heavyweight fours in 1875. Dinnie
never lost his enthusiasm for rowing, and,
if a race was on up the old Parramatta
River, he was willing to walk all the way
to Gladesville rather than miss it. Thanks
to kinsman George Crowley, the old chap
(he was 8S when he died the other day)
was always comfortably installed in the
umpire’s launch.

Distinguished Social Lite.
In spite of the bright and brisk open-
ing of “Lucia,” in which Henry Ashton, the
heroine’s brother, gives no hint of his finan-
cial embarrassments or his knavish tricks
towards the Crown, the audience at Her
Majesty’s last week was not deceived. They
knew the unfortunate Lucia was in for a
bad spin, and by the time she arrived by
the fountain in the second scene their sym-
pathy was all with her. The soft twilight
of this scene gave no hint, any more than the
rugged heather-mixture background of the
first, that the the blight of mortgage was
over all —that the yew-trees up near the
castle were also lOU-trees.
When Lucy, in her cornflower robe,
wanders around the fountain in the moon-
light attended only by a handmaiden, you
know there’s only one reason for her being
there. She has a date with her young man.
His name is Edgar, and he has come to say
farewell. He is off to France on a mission.
Now going to France in those days wasn’t a
matter of leaving in the morning, lunching
in Paris, having your evening chop in Lon-
don and taking the evening edition of the
flying Scotsman up to the Highlands. No,
it was a long-drawn-out affair, and
that’s where brother Henry got in some
more of his dirty work. Arthur Bucklaw,
a neighbor who held Henry’s notes of hand
and a few more documents, decided that he’d
rather have a parchment-satin bride than a
pile of parchment promises. He has taken
an inventory of the Lammermoor properties,
and there’s nothing much there he wants.
He has more than enough timber on his
own hill and dale to keep the Bucklaw home-
fires burning, and the castle is thoroughly
unsuited for remodelling into flats. Lucia
for his money.
Well, time goes on, and the only notes
Lucia has to keep her in mind of Edgar are
the notes of their last duet. Yes, you’ve
guessed it: brother Henry has destroyed the
absent one’s letters. She pines, and when
Henry shows her a letter proving that an-
other has captured her young man’s fancy
she remembers all she has heard about the
fascinating Parisienne. She lets Henry
announce her engagement to Bucklaw, orders
her wedding finery, and all too rapidly signs
on the dotted lines. The wedding sees a
great gathering of the clans to taste the
bootlegger wines and brandy from the Lam-
mermoor vaults. Some of the older girls
are perhaps a bit sniffy, you know: “H’m!
hardly off with the old love before she’s on
with the new.” “Girls were different in my
day.” Consternation ! Edgar reappears! All
is over save recriminations, protestations,
dementations and the obsequies.
There was more Italian than English
spoken on board the Remo when the dance
to aid the Dante Alighieri Society and the
Italian Literary Society ran its gay course.
The dance had been postponed for some
months, but, unlike most delayed events, it
was a great success. More than 700 dancers
gambolled among the autumnal yellow and
browns with which the ship was decorated;
the red, white and green of Italy struck a
vivid note, and when Italy’s Consul-General
and Donna Grossardi arrived, the band
struck up their national anthem. The long,
tight-fitting velvet bodice and full net skirts
of Adrienne Girossardi’s frock were pic-
torial, and the golden laces worn by Mrs.
Ferrari Passmore, who had organised the
dance, toned with the decoration scheme.
The president, Mrs. Vitali, sustained rose-
patterned black chiffons and a lei of pink
rosebuds. A lei of the same blooms cheered
Donna Grossardi’s black laces. Mrs. E.
Rossi was the secretary and Mrs. Fiaschi
the treasurer. The Mayoral Walders graced
the frivol with their presence, as did the
whole Bertie Kelly family: Beatrice, her
black net splashed with silver in contrast to
her red head, was gaze-arresting; Valerie
and Nancy Bavin were among the novelty-
sellers, and the W. J. Clearys, Captain and
Mrs. Feakes and the Professor Waterhouse
couple were others who made merry.
Another link with the gay .social world of
pre-war Sydney went when Phil Morton died
last week after a lingering illness. His wife,
who predeceased him, was the beautiful and
always beautifully-dressed Isabel Morton
whose parties at Pareli were famous in
several States. Pictures and books were his
hobbies, and the home was full of them.
His death will put a number of well-known
people in mourning. Mark Morton, M.L.A.,
and Harry (ex-M.L.A. and sometime
Speaker of the Assembly) were brothers;
Alex. Hay, of Coolangatta, was a brother-in-
law, and Mrs. Little (wife of Major Little,
D. 5.0., of Melbourne) was a daughter. He
was uncle, amongst many others, to the pre-
sent Mrs. Alex. Dalglish, of Pomeroy station.
Just when the last touches had been put
to the open-air ballroom in the courtyard
of Burdekin House last Thursday night for
a wedding feast, the sky greyed over, and
twilight looked down with gloomy rain-heavy
eyes. Probably Sylvia Moore Sims, slither-
ing about that hour into her wedding dress,
breathed a prayer to the weather gods, for
by the time she emerged from St. James’s
Church, on the arm of her husband, Claude
Russell Dryhurst, the moon rode high in a
cloudless sky. This was one of the week’s
pretty weddings. Sylvia is the elder daughter
of the Moore Simses, of Kamilaroi, Moree.
Her ’groom is a citizen of Roseville. Ivory
satin, Limerick lace and begonias formed
the bride’s outfit; sister Shirley and Betty
Johnson ’maided in water-green chiffons
swathed into large taffeta bustle bows.
Wreaths of pink roses and small posies of
pink begonias finished off their glad attire.
That it’s not such a long way in the
spirit and in the flesh from Wyalkatchem in
W.A. to Rome has been proved by Irene
Carter, whose
water - colors
are now on
show in the
Lyceum Club.
Irene is a
native of the
little town in
the Westralian
wheat belt,
and after
studying with
Van Raa 11 e
she found her
way to the
studios of
Italy and
France. She
spent four
years in
Europe, and
since her re-
turn to Aus-
tralia about
nine months
ago she has had two shows in Melbourne and
one in Perth. Mrs. Walter Kingsmill, pre-
sident of the Westralian Association, opened
the artist’s Sydney exhibition.
The Grosvenor Gallery was decorated with
autumn leaves from Mount Wilson and great
bowls of yellow African daisies for the open-
ing of the Beatrice Kelly show of etchings
and water-colors. Miss Kelly’s water-colors
are gay, luminous bits of Italy and Southern
Europe; her etchings show strength, an, un-
usual feeling for light and shade, and sure
draughtsmanship. The prices, too, were low,
and soon three-fourths of the frames carried
the “Sold” disc. The affair was one of the
social afternoons of the week, and there was
a constant drifting in and out of young men.
The artist struck the right note for her color-
ing and wore a slim black frock served with a
bouquet of violets as large as a cauliflower.
These were the gift of Consul-General for
Italy Grossardi, who opened the show, and
they were of the Parma variety, because
that is his home town. A marble piazza with
Fiesole for a background seemed the right
setting for Mrs. Bertie Kelly’s green satin
frock and picturesque black hat. This frock
was at once modern and statuesque, and only
a woman of personality could wear it and
not be submerged. Donna Grossardi, Mrs.
George Vivers and Barbara Lane Mullins were
others to be singled out in that crowded room.
Tom and Carlton Kelly, Harry Dangar,
Howard Hinton, Julian Ashton, Dr. Bac-
carini and the artist’s proud parent, Bertie,
were among the unemployed who squired
groups of the fair to the exhibition.
Oswald Cheeke’s party last week was sup-
posed to usher into Sydney the beer-and-
sausage fashion, which is England’s latest
mania. But Oswald is too good a host not
to provide richer fare for his guests, and in
addition to the sausages, which were as short
and twice as thick as your thumb and stuck
on slivers of wood like sturdy toothpicks,
there were at least 20 different sorts of
savory and a dozen brands of drinks. The
belles of the flutter were Eileen O’Brien,
from Westralia, and Valerie Purves, from
the South.
The Charles Chauvel couple—his uncle is
Australia’s cavalry General and his father
is Major Chauvel of Stanthorpe (Q.)
were the centre around which Violet Roche
shook up a cocktail party. The two, who
have already won fame in the picture world,
are off yachting to the South Seas with the
intention of making the sound picture of
their career. Mrs. Chauvel, before her mar-
riage, was Elsa Sylvaney, who had several
tours of South Africa to her credit, as well
as a part in “Mid Channel” with Conway
Tearle. Charles learned all the secrets of
Hollywood when he worked there, first with
the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer people, and later
doing publicity for Douglas Fairbanks.
For some unknown reason “Boheme” brought
out the greatest display of shorn lamb and
bald heads yet seen at an opera first-night.
“Boheme” is loved by midde-age. It has all
the tenderness and irresponsible gaiety of
the world they knew when they were young:
a secure world, a world of peace and good-
will. Youth likes it because the farewell
scene between Mimi and Rudolfo is such a
good excuse for holding hands. Mimi has a
cameo-like profile, and is mistress of the
most exquisite Italian. The critical in the
audience were delighted. “It is,” one of
them said to this Letter, “to us what per-
fectly-spoken English is to you.”
Mimi made her entrance in a spreading
frock of jacaranda blues, a tender contrast
to the jocund-pink crinoline and the feathered
bonnet of Musetta. This Musetta was a
little South Australian girl with a thin, clear
voice, unbounded vivacity and a pair of the
daintiest feet ever seen on a stage. The
audience laughed with her, sighed with Mimi,
melted with the poet.
There was as much excitement at the
drink-counter when the lilac-satined Lina
Paliughi rustled around from her box to
have a lemon squash as there had been among
the loiterers outside the house when one of
the orchestra staggered across the pavement
hugging a Sousaphone. Surani and Castagna
shared the box with her, Surani’s pink
rose on black velvet corsage looking rather
like a bit of flotsam on a sable sea. In
the box opposite Grace Augelau shimmered
in gold satin. Black velvet and a
blaze of diamonds marked the spot where
Mrs. Bertie Kelly sat. Hugh Denison’s lady,
Mrs. Herbert Marks and Mrs. Penfold
Hyland were also among those who' glit-
tered ; and Mrs. C. L. Jones was wrapped in
a snowdrift of ermine.
Members of “The Fighting Seventeenth”
are reminded that the yearly rally of their
old battalion is set for May 12 at Sargent’s
cafe in Market-street. The equally famous
20th will hold its yearly foregathering on
April 28 in Miss Bishop’s cafe, Bathurst-
street.
The Water-colorists set an example to
all other art societies holding shows in the
Education Department. They have turned
the long gallery into two avenues, bounded
on the one side by orange-trees laden with
the green fruit. These rise from pale terra-
cotta pots, and are occasionally punctuated
by miniature cypress-trees of a greenness
So dark it almost appears black. The stage,
too, glowed orange and golden brown, and
was a decorative background for Chief
Justice Street’s lady when she declared
the exhibition open. The panel of
students’ work is one of the magnets,
and Francis Sherwood and Joyce Abbott,
who woP the institute prizes, quickly
sold their wares. “The Surfers” of B. E.
Minns is a typical bit of beach life, full of
joy and color. Blamire Young hits the eye
with his “Moorea” and the fancy with
his “Winter.” The by-the-world-forgot atmo-
sphere of Cobbitty Church is in H. W.
Grace’s picture of it. Rah Fizelle, Dora
Jarret, Pat O’Harris and Pearl Sheldon
are others before whom it is pleasant to
linger. The gallery got a bargain in Napier
Waller’s “Bantams.”
There’s great excitement in the underworld
of Castle Hill. Master minds among the
cabbages and the big guns of the carrots and
the cauliflowers are preparing for an offen-
sive on the
public purse,
their objective
being to shake
out £2OOO for
the Ryde
Home for In-
curables.
Vegets. and
farm produce
are to be the
great attrac-
tion at the
fair, which
will be held in
the grounds of
the R. C. Dix-
son s’ Castle
Hill home,
Elwatan, on
May 14. The
v e g e t ables,
poultry an d
pork which
will stock
Mrs. Dixson’s own canvas booth are even
now being grown on the estate, and all the
tinselled glory of old-time fairs will enwrap
the afternoon. This is a Falk picture of the
hostess, who' is so generously throwing open
in the cause of charity her wide domain of
well-barbered lawns, flowering arbors and
intimate walled gardens.
The sex is going to be the usual contra-
diction : about our hats we grow more and
more like Bo Peep who lost her sheep, but
into our jumpers and skirts and suits more
and more lamb and sheep are being woven.
It’s a very woolly season—woolly not only
as to coats and capes, but even as to orna-
ments. The nicest tweeds are loosely woven;
the lacy-knitted jumper is worn blousewisr
with suits —and, by the way, the only really
smart blouse is the overblouse, which has a
basque, fitted or full to suit the wearer’s
taste. Shoulders are wide, hips are straight.
Epaulettes and the wide revers help this
effect; .so do the plain, straight skirts —
some of these have a few pleats at the knee.
Skirts are inclined to creep up, and ankles
are putting in an appearance in the evening.
White gloves are almost an unbreakable law.
The shade of the stockings is variable, but
the really correct flower to wear on the
lapel is white. One enviable hat lately
caught the eye; it was worn by a Bridge
visitor, and was of olive-green straw ribbon.
It looked as though the wearer had taken a
scarf, arranged it in neat folds and knotted
it around her head, leaving a big trefoil
bow above the right ear. Another gadget
displayed by a last-month’s arrival was a
sports watch. This was in gun-metal, had
no hands, and, instead of glass, had a metal
face with holes in it, in which you read
the figures that tell the time.
This Letter is sending a question to its
brother the Service Department: “Who gets
it first?” “it” being a new book by any
author other than a bore or a writer of
weak intellect. Personally it has never yet
got a book on demand from a library unless
the volume was in a state of aged decrepitude
and odorous of the lunch basket and the
tobacco fumes of countless consumers. This
might be evidence that some blessed damozel.
some single-hearted student or an emineut
politician had indeed been on the spot, when
the book in its virginal innocence arrived.
But so far this Letter has never met the
party, and it might drop dead if some day
the customary “Out, Madam,” was replaced
by “It’s just arrived.”
Bananaland bits: —
The last farewell function to Sir John and Lady
Goodwin was in the Exhibition Grounds. Lady
Goodwin was in red with white I'ox fur and black
hat; the Mayoress wore blue and silver and white
fox; the Blair lady was in black lace; Mrs. Moore
was in parchment lace with a jade girdle; Mrs.
Cumbrae Stewart wore rase with a black hat and
white fox; black Chantilly lace was chosen by
Mrs. E. M. Ralph, and Madge Macdonald was in
rose and grey. The following day, under cloudy
skies, Queensland waved adieux to the Orama, with
Sir John and Lady Goodwin aboard.
St. Brigid’s Church, which looks over the city
from Red Hill, saw the wedding of Edmund James
Masterson and Yera Josephson. The bride, who
was given away by her father, was in white mariette
and Chantilly lace over satin ; her veil of cut tulle
was worn with a hand-made lace cap. Tucked rose-
pink mariette was worn by the ’maids, Mary Joseph-
son and Eileen and Marie Masterson. Little Peggy
Josephson and Maureen Woulfe, in Kate Greenaway
frocks of rose pink, also attended the bride. Altiona,
Red Hill, saw the feasting, and the South sees the
’moon.
Edna Tyrell announces her engagement to T. A.
Pollard.
Nettie and Vance Palmer have passed through to
potter about the Barrier Reef and pick up pearls
that should later be seen in print. They expect to
stay three months.
The Uni. students’ procession naturally featured
De Groot opening the Sydney bridge, along with
other whimsicalities. In the City Hall the conferring
of degrees took place. The Blair lady, in black
and gold, was with her husband. Primrose cherry
and black was Mrs. A. E. Moore’s choice; with her
was Dr. W. N. Robertson’s wife, in navy floral
chiffon.
Rain fell heavily upon Tattersall’s races at Ascot.
Acting Governor Blair was the guest of the com-
mittee. Amongst those present were Mrs. Courtney
Dent, in white crepe de Chine; Mrs. O. J. Lands-
downe, in navy; Mrs. Malvern-Hills Evans, in black
and white; her mother, Mrs. G. C. Willcocks, in
patterned crepe de Chine in black and white; Lucy
Perkins (Charleville), in coral pink; Audrey Forth
in fawn and brown.
New lady J’s.P. are Mrs. Cumbrae Stewart, presi-
dent of the N.C.W.; Mrs. Barnard, inter-State secre-
tary ; Mrs, Abrahams, president of the Queen Alex-
andria Home; Mrs. Dan Weinholt, Mrs. Hood, Mrs.
Johnson and Miss Agnes O’Dwyer.


NEWSPAPERS LEAD THE WAY

Where Advertising Pays
Countless advertisers throughout the world have found by experience that
the really profitable method of advertising is by use of newspapers consist-
ently and conspicuously. Mr. Buchanan Taylor, the well-known English
publicity expert, recently told the Edinburgh Publicity Club that:—
“No advertising medium has yet been discovered that can seriously
compete with the newspaper. The other media are adjuncts, sometimes
necessary for a complete campaign, but no commodity can be solidly
established without the aid of the columns of the daily and weekly journals.”
The. weekly newspaper undoubtedly has the greatest reader value, and the Perth “Sunday
Tunes” is probably read by nearly 175,000 people, since it is estimated that each copy is read
by five people. The circulation of a paper like the “Sunday Times,” with its appeal to all
sections of the community, is remarkable, because the paper is handed or posted on to friends
in W.A. and other States of the Commonwealth. The advertising value of such a medium is
tremendous, and the volume of representative advertising carried by this journal each week is
excellent testimony to its capacity to create markets for its advertisers.
Undoubtedly the newspaper leads the way in advertising; it is swift,
appealing and, considering the territory covered together with the effective
results achieved, is easily the cheapest method of advertising known in any
part of the world.

A hop at Wattle Path, St. Kilda, attracted
about 1000 patrons associated with or in-
terested in the Olympic games. The jollo
was engineered to supplement the funds of
the Australian team that is to travel to Los
Angeles. President of the committee was
ex-Lud Mayor Stephen Morell, who was
there with his daughter Sheila, her brunette
coloring set off by garnet-red chiffon. Alan
Henry was chairman, and secretarial duties
were shared •by Lt.-Colonel J. S. Ivelleher
and Mrs. A. W. B. Fawcett, the last-named
choosing a gown of parchment-toned satin.
Good-bye and lots of good luck were said to
A. J. Ilillhouse (athlete) and Frances Bult
(swimmer), Victorian members of the team.
Interludes were furnished by pupils from
Minnie Everett’s school of dancing.
The lately-formed Queenslanders’ Associa-
tion gave a lunch to the Ministers from
Bananaland and their womenfolk at the
Australia. About 60 assembled in a private
room, where a huge Q was suspended over
the official table. The maroon sports blazer
of R. P. Delaney, manager of the Queens-
land crew competing in the King’s Cup
regatta, added a bit of appropriate color.
Bowls of zinnias were the floral furnishings.
The patron of the association, General
Chauvel, presided and welcomed the visi-
tors, who included Premier Moore and his
wife. Her black georgette frock had a vest
of champagne hue, and her black felt hat
was trimmed with black and white ribbon.
Mrs. W. H. Barnes was in snuff-brown wool
georgette, with touches of rose red, and
felt millinery. Minister of Transport God-
frey Morgan brought Mrs. Morgan, she in
bottle green. Labor Minister Sizer was
accompanied by Mrs. Sizer, who favored a
magpie blend in frock and millinery. The
Queensland Tradb Commissioner, W. H.
Austin, was also a guest.
A two-days’ open-air bazaar, which
opened in finb weather and closed in rain,
figured in the jubilee celebrations of the
Methodist Ladies’ College. The wife of the
Rev. Dr. A. McCallum, the first dux, launched
the fair, and was presented with the silver
trowel that was used at the laying of the
foundation-stone by the Rev. Daniels,
whose great-grand-daughters, Jean McTag-
gart and Enid Collins, handed over the gift.
Mrs. J. W. Grove, wife of the president of
the M.L.C., was organiser of the f§te, the
purpose of which was to reduce the debt
on the college buildings. Some of the help-
ers wore the flounced skirts, tight bodices
and wee flower-wreathed hats of 50 years
ago. The children of the school furnished
a section of the garden entitled “Fairyland,”
peopled by elves, nymphs and fairies, where
there were pleasant surprises for little folk.
Farewells have been said at various
parties to Mr. and Mrs. W. M. Robins who
are sailing for England early next month.
Mrs. Sadler Gill had a bridge gathering
for the lady on Friday, when the hostess,
in a rose-red gown, made a nice speech and
handed the guest of honor a basket of flow-
ers. Mrs. A. Fowler, a daughter of Mrs.
Gill, lent a helping hand. Mrs. Robins,
who was a study in black and white, was
accompanied by her daughter, Mrs. Norman
Price.
Many people were drawn to take afternoon
tea at Myer’s at the midweek when profits
were earmarked for the Lilian Cannan Free
Kindergarten. Pianist Henri Penn, soprano
Pauline Bindley, Cecil Parkes with his fiddle,
May Broderick and others contributed to' a
musical programme.
The Women’s Auxiliary of the Bureau of
Social and International Affairs put on a
Russian programme at the Central Hall on
Saturday night. Short plays were acted;
and Gabriel Toyne showed his interest by
producing “The Bear,” by Tehekhov. The
Melbourne string quartette made melody;
Mina Heseleva, wearing a gorgeous national
dress of pink satin and white fur with a
gleaming head-dress, sang ; and there was a
quaintly arranged soldiers’ song. Samples of
Russian cookery were on sale, mostly made
by Mrs. W. Mortill, who ran the stall. She
and her assistants, who included Mrs. E. L.
Kiernan, Mrs. Russell Jackson, Gwen
Hughes and Mollie Warden, wore Russian
dresses. Mrs. Herbert Brookes, president of
the Women’s Auxiliary, was there with
her daughter Jessie and Miss Deakin. Har-
rison Moore was present with his lady and
Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Tweddle brought Shirley.
Melbourne was rain-drenched on Saturday
morning, but the V.A.T.O. meeting at Caul-
field was held. There was a clear spell just
after luncheon, and the attendance was sur-
prisingly good.
The .C.W.A.’s Wool Week show at the
Town Hall covers ancient and modern uses
of the sheep’s clothing. In a loan collection
gathered by Mrs. Ronald McDonald there
are Persian prayer-rugs, samplers, tapestries
and fire-screens, some 200 years old. Pre-
sent-day work is represented by the prize-
winning entries of a just-concluded knitting
competition. There is a fine show of home-
woven scarves and tweeds done by amateur
weavers who have spun and dyed the wool
themselves. Several women have utilised
black fleece. A jumper knitted in a lace
stitch in this way is a blend of attractive
tones of brown. Some of the members of
the Mortlake centre have used logwood dyes
in their hand-spun and hand-woven articles,
producing tints of nigger, fawn and biscuit.
Padded quilts stuffed with Romney Marsh
wool are among the features of this exhibi-
tion. To prove that a mattress filled with
wool doesn’t become hard and lumpy some-
one has sent along one that has been in use
a year and is just as soft as when it was
made. Woollen hook-rugs form an interest-
ing section. The longevity of the home-made
wool rug is demonstrated by one of Oriental
design, made in England in the early days
of the Avar. It looks brand-new. A very
beautiful gift sent for sale by Mrs. Caddy,
of Coburg, is a hand-spun, hand-knitted
dressing-gown of cobwebby texture —cream
with a lining of pale pink. There are also
on view some excellent specimens of modern
tapestry.
The large dining-room of the Lyceum
Club was aglow with roses for the rejoicings
after the wedding at the Church of England
Grammar chapel of Beverley Hetherington
and Arthur Cameron Begg. Vellum-colored
satin, old Limerick lace and a froth of
white tulle figured in the bridal finery. Two
attendant ’maids were in blue chiffon with
wreaths and posies of deep-red roses. The
leading lady’s parents are the H. F. Ilcther-
ingtons, of Caulfield, the ’groom being eldest
son of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Begg, of Mal-
vern.
Ivory satin and georgette, with a Limerick
lace veil, an heirloom, was worn by Elaine,
daughter of Mrs. J. McKenzie Henry, of St.
Kilda-road, when she was linked to Brinsley,
son of the F. Brooke Boothbys, of East Mal-
vern, at Melbourne Grammar School chapel.
Roslyn Henry and Isabel Robertson attended
the bride, wearing blue chiffon and hats of
the same shade. There were rejoicings after-
wards at No. 9.
Here is a picture by Ruskin of Mrs.
McCowan Russell, professionally known as

On Saturday
the lady gave
a dramatic
and elocution-
ary recital at
the Queen’s
Ilall, which was much enjoyed.
The recital, as was only natural, drew
a full house, and there was a whole
garden of flowers for her. She styled her
contributions portraits, giving peeps at a
whole gallery of folk in verse and prose
from the pens of many writers, including
some Australians. Against a background
of green curtains and an effective tapestry
square her dead-white gown stood out effect-
ively. Contralto Marie Breen and pianist
Amy Dickinson provided musical interludes
Though not a surprise the announcement
of the engagement of Prof. Bernard Heinze
of the Uni. Con., to Valerie Hennessy caused
a flutter in feminine circles at the week-end.
Recently the Ormond Professor took over
one of the houses within the Uni. grounds,
once the residence of the Allen knight,
and he has had it overhauled. His
fiancee is the youngest daughter of the late
knight David Hennessy, one of Melbourne’s
Lud Mayors, and of the Hennessy lady of
Queen’s-road.
The uniting of Esme, only daughter of the
Percy Frankenbergs, of Toorak, with Dr.
Charles J. Officer Brown, eldest son of
Mrs. David Brown, of Malvern, filled
the Too'rak kirk. The bride, fair, tall and
slender, was swathed in white satin that
flared into a train. Fine tucks and leg-of-
mutton sleeves were features of the gown,
which was high-necked. A billow of white
tulle formed the veil, and the lady carried
a sheaf of orange buds and lilies-of-the-valley.
Cora Spowers, Jocelyn Outliwaite and Molly
Neil attended in frocks of angels’ skin of
differing hues—pale pink, bine and green—
fashioned with high collars and puff sleeves.
Their locks were wreathed with flowers to
match their dresses.
“Glad to be back in Australia’’ is the
message conveyed by the pleased expression
of Mrs. Guy Innes, here pictured by Rroo-
thorn, w ho

after 10 years
in L o n don.
She is an
Australian by

to settle here.
Before her
marriage, as
Frances Gray,
she put out
her brass
plate as a den-
tist in Collins-
street. Since
making li e r
home in the Big Smoke Mrs. limes
has become an active member of several
political and social societies and is pre-
sident of the Hospitality Committee of
the British Commonwealth League. She is
on the executive of the United Empire circle
of the Lyceum Club, and is also on the
British Women’s Hospitality Committee,
founded by Lady Bertha Dawkins, lady-in-
waiting to the Queen. The function of this
body is to offer entertainment and friendship
to professional and business women fro'm
other parts of the world.
The talk of Tassie :
Launceston’s Art Society opened its annual exhi-
bition in the King’s Hall. Water-colors, oils, and
black-and-white work filled the main section, while
the Arts and Crafts ran a nice little sideshow of
their own. The first prize in landscape painting
went to W. Fuller. Mabel Hookey and Isobel Old-
ham acted as judges.
The T.T.C. had lovely weather for the New-
market meeting at Mowbray. Vice-chairman R. C.
Field, Mrs. Field and the Andrew Raeburns enter-
tained in the committee-room. Dressing was quite
smart, and for the most part wintry. Many country
folk were present, and a sprinkling of oversea visitors,
among them Mrs. R. C. Wyly (Melb.), Mrs. Cooke
(Sydney), Mrs. Anderson (Q.), Mrs. Beath (Melb.),
and Mrs. Roy O’Connor. Among the girls, Betty
Cuff was kept busy receiving good wishes on her
engagement to Jack Miilen.
Launceston has lost one of its most popular girls
in Josephine Wilks, who has left by the Esperance
Bay for the Cold Country. She will be married
immediately on arrival to the Rev. Philip Lee.
Laurie, daughter of the Carlisle Graves, Bagdad,
and Derek, only son of Mrs. and the late Major
G. A. Gurney, signify their intention of running in
double harness in the near future.
Weddings have been plentiful lately. Elenora,
daughter of Capt. and Mrs. Bosgard, Hurstvflle,
N.S.W., was married to Lieut. Mather, of the
District Naval Offices Staff, at St. George’s, Battery
Point. Commander S. R. Symonds gave the bride
away. Her frock was of ivory ring velvet, with a
little ruched waist-length coatee; a silver toque,
well tilted, topped the costume. Kathleen Symonds
’maided in soft pink lace and georgette. Commander
and Mrs. Symonds saw to the. reception at the
Grotto, as the bride’s parents were unable to come
over to the wedding.
Ethel, second daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs.
Silas Tinning, and Forbes, son of Dr. and the late
Mrs. Ireland, were tied up for life at St. George’s,
Battery Point. Captain Harrison, the bride’s uncle,
gave her away. The ivory satin frock was made
with draped bodice, and the skirt moulded closely to
the hips, then drawn into a fulness from which
the divided train fell. The tulle veil was caught
into position by a pearl coronet, and there were small
sprays of orange buds behind the ears. Sisters
Gwen and Edith Tinning, with Helen Gray, followed
in apricot mousseline de soie, with ruffled skirts
and large bustle bows of burnt orange velvet. Col.
and Mrs. J. C. Lord lent their house for the
reception.
A romantic accessory of the main wedding was
that of one of the bridesmaids, Gwen Tinning, to
groomsman D. J. Hood. The chief relatives were,
of course, in the know, but the majority of guests
didn’t notice that a small group had motored back
to the church and were taken by surprise a little
later when Col. and Mrs. Lord announced the arrival
of “Mr. and Mrs. D. J. J. Hood” at the reception.
Consequently the same festivities —plus a second
wedding cake—served for both brides.
Adelaide’s addendum:—
The ball organised by Mrs. Lavington Bonython
for Baby Week attracted over a thousand to the
Palais Royal. His Ex. and Lady Hore-Ruthven were
received by Mrs. Bonython and a guard of honor,
formed by the 11 debutantes, who were afterwards
presented to his Ex. There was a mannequin parade,
in which 22 society girls took part, different city
firms having lent the costumes. A specialty dance
was contributed by pupils of Miss Nora Stewart.
The evening was a huge success.
In spite of showery weather over 800 were pre-
sent at the garden party for juveniles held at the
residence of Mrs. A. A. Simpson, at Burnside, the
last of the Baby Week efforts. Different branches
of the Mothers’ and Babies’ Health Association took
stalls, and there were many side-shows.
Mesdames Lavington Bonython and Compton Trew
gave an at-home at St. Corantyn, to form a com-
mittee for raising money for the Elder scholar,
Miriam Hyde, who is to leave in July for London.
The reception-rooms were massed with lovely bloom.
Mr. Bonython looked smart in black chiffon, and
Mrs. Compton Trew wore a fawn georgette toilette,
with a small hat en suite. Lady Hore-Ruthven was
present in a fawn ensemble and a small brown straw'
fiat. Three pianoforte items were contributed by
Miss Hyde, tw'o being her own compositions. A
strong committee was formed ; a bridge party in the
Town Hall at £1 a table will be their first effort.
Mr. and Mrs. Eric McMichael gave a dance at
their residence at Craters to celebrate the coming
of age of son Dick and the debut of daughter
Kathleen. Their garden, now a riot of gorgeous
English autumn foliage, provided plentiful material
for decoration. There was a marquee arranged as
a lounge opening off another where dancing was
enjoyed, and beyond that a marquee for supper;
bridge for the elder folk was in the billiard-room.
Bright fires were appreciated in the keen air of the
hills. The hostess wore a smart black lace toilette;
her daughter was a striking figure in parchment
lace. Another deb was Josephine Dawson, frocked
in white silk net and Valenciennes lace. Several
hundreds were present.
Knight William Sowden and his lady left for
England on the Strathaird.
A word from Westralia:—
Baby Week started the dance ball rolling at
Temple Court, with a committee of Bright Young
Things to run the show. Jim Gerald’s company
livened proceedings with varied numbers and Ethel
Philp and Tom Assender exhibited a w'altz and
tango. Mollie Learmonth headed affairs and handed
out the prizes in persimmon chiffons basqued with
green-lined folds. Hon. treasurer Sheila Hayes
wafted a shrimp-pink cloak over ethereal draperies ;
Gwenyth Ambrose was a study in midnight
blue; Marjorie Butler slung a black fur scarf
round the shoulders of her snow-queen garb; Mrs.
Davidson (Beryl Mills, of “Miss Australia” fame)
beamed at friends in murky velvet billowed at the
knee with embossed nets; Mrs. Harry Vincent was
clad in lime satin; Lloyda Hayward gambolled
in russet taffetas; Mrs. Ernest Chennery’s myrtle
lace looked well, and Cecilia Brennan’s cerise velvet
made a splash of color.
The Kerr-Pearses sailed for England after
a veritable orgy of farewells. The French Salon
members sped along to Mrs. Cecil Mason’s flat,
where the hostess, wrapped in air force blue, awaited
Mrs. Kerr-Pearse, who arrived in enviable black
satin and cream-embroidered fichu. The Victoria
League substantiated its au devoir with two water-
colors of picked spots in Perth, and Mrs. Emile
Oliver, Nell Stewart, Barbara Nairn and the Calders
were other party-givers. Elizabeth K.-P. and her
mother both utilised Government House drawing-
room for returning hospitality.
On Lois Weir’s birthday a horde of merrymakers
raided the Weir dwelling and took possession. Mrs.
J.L.B.W. watched the fun in trailing black ninon,
and Lois’s laurel green was in evidence.
An entirely different birthday festival was Amy
Jane Best’s 88th natal date. A pioneer of education,
the lady opened in Perth one of the first seminaries
for girls, where many now well-known matrons
were tutored. In order to perpetuate her name,
ex-pupils decided to endow an Amy Jane Best prize
for literature at the University, and £lOO was
promptly subscribed. To commemorate the 88th
milestone, Mrs. Norman Temperley, Mrs. Balston
and Miss Phoebe Holmes arranged a party of old
girls at the Karrakatta Club, where the venerated
guest, wearing a gun-grey suit, was welcomed amid
a profusion of carnations and dahlias.
The Children’s Protection bridge party was so
packed that it was difficult to see the gorgeous roses
adorning the Women’s Service Guild rooms. Mrs.
David Lyle’s magpie tweeds were flanked by Mrs.
L. Carter’s cute winter suit when the pair received
congratulations on the organisation.
Busselton Centenary Week saw dozens of old
families trekking south to take part in proceedings.
The landing of the Bussells was staged, and people
from all parts of the State assisted at the pageant.
The names of Ferguson, Venn, Bussell, Brockman,
Warburton and many other pioneering families were
heard once more in the old settlement.

The Good Deed.
C. G. LEAROYD TELLS A BRIGHT STORY OF AN AUSTRALIAN
MOTORIST'S REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE IN ENGLAND.
I MET Jerry Bamber the other day. He
had just come back from "a trip home.”
"How’s England?” I asked.
“Ob, all right,” lie answered unenthusias-
tically. . ...
Now Jerry is by nature a joyous indi-
vidual; sort of fellow who would have a
"perfectly wonderful time” at a Sunday-
school treat. . _ .. .
"Come and have a drink, I said,, and
when we were comfortably settled behind
two tankards 1 got his story.
“Oli, yes, England’s champion; lovely
country and decent enough people when you
grt to' know them. I’d have enjoyed myselt
line if it hadn’t, been for one matter which
was very largely my own ruddy fault. 1
was touring round the country in an old
Morris that I’d picked up second-hand, and
had been looking up my dad’s people in
Birmingham, my mother’s in Perth, a neigh-
bor's aimt in Newcastle and various people
I had met in the ship going home. You
know the sort of thing, an occasional day or
two with half-strangers, and then rather
glad to get away again for a long spin by
oneself on those wonderful roads.
"Well, about lialf-way through my trip
I turned up in Cambridge to see a distant
cousin of mine who was a don. I had written
to say I was coming and he had asked me
to stay the night. They were charming old
people, he and his wife; but whether it was
the butler or the general atmosphere of cul-
tured restraint, or the prospect of a terribly
dull evening, I don’t know. Anyway, I felt
that a free-born Aussie couldn’t possibly
spend the night there, so I made up some
yarn about an appointment in town, and
pushed off after dinner. They were very
kind and hospitable, and I felt rather a
beast going off suddenly like that, but I was
so damned glad to get out in the open
again that it didn’t worry me for long. I left
the old birds about nine, and as it was only
about fifty miles to my hotel in the South-
ampton-row I took things easily. I had a
couple of drinks on the outskirts of Cam-
bridge to celebrate my- escape, and then pro-
ceeded leisurely on my way to town.
"I don’t know if you understand what a
June evening in England is like. It must
be the most peaceful thing in the world.
They have some stuff called meadow-sweet,
which grows by the side of the road and
gives a sleepy, seductive sort of smell; and
then there’s ' the honeysuckle. And every-
thing is green and balmy, even the shadows
and the old cottages and the tiny fields. But
I expect you know all about that.
"Well, ''after driving for nearly an hour
I came to a place called Audley End, a
huge ancestral house where Henry the
Eighth or some bloke of that sort used to live.
The house stands well back from the road,
with lawns and gardens sloping down to a
river, and it all looked simply champion in'
the dusk. I pulled the car into the side of
the road and sat looking at it. And then
a nightingale started in!
“It was after twelve when I left that
place, and it will always be a pleasant
memory in spite of what happened after-
wards. , . T
"About a dozen miles further on, when 1
was on a particularly straight piece of road,
a large car, travelling, at a tremendous pace,
flashed by mo. I was watching its rear
light, and when it was about a quarter ot
a mile ahead I noticed it slow up and stop.
I saw a fellow get out of the car and walk
round to the front of it. He was bending
over an object lying on the road when I
carafe up. He straightened up and hailed
me. and I found myself talking to a tall,
distinguished sort of fellow with a monocle
and a short-clipped moustache. He was
in evening-dress with a light-colored dust
coat over it.
“-‘I must apologise for stopping you,’ he
drawled, ‘but I have had a rather serious
accident.’ H'e switched his torch on to
the huddled object lying on the ground It
was the body of a man; his head was look-
ing the wrong way, and there was a root,
kicking at the back of it. I was rather shaken
by the sight. The man looked like a tramp,
but, of course, he wasn’t exactly looking
his best.
“ ‘Poor beggar,’ I murmured. ‘How did
it happen?’
“ ‘Oh, lie deliberately threw himself in front
of me, a clear case, of suicide. All the same.
I expect, there will be a devil of a fuss about
it I was doing seventy at. the time and —
well, you can see the damage is extensive.
Devilish awkward!’
“One couldn’t help liking the fellow;
although he was annoyed he was as cool as
a cucumber and not the slightest bit rattled.
“ ‘But surely if he threw himself in front
of you, it is not your fault,’ T suggested.
“ ‘There is no evidence of that except my
own, and, quite frankly, I have a distinctly
unfortunate motoring record. My license
has been endorsed three times and this is not
the first fatality. Moreover. I am a public
man, a member of Parliament, which makes
it more awkward still. I am not exag-
gerating when I say that I would gladly give
a thousand pounds for this not, to have hap-
pened. I must not, however, detain you, but
if you will be so kind as to call at the police
station at Bishop’s Stortford —it’s about four
miles along the road —and acquaint them
with what has happened. I shall be infinitely
obliged. I shall not move my car until they
come, and perhaps you would give them my
card.’
“I glanced at the card by the light of the
headlamps; it bore the name of Sir Gerald
Osprey and indicated that he could be found
at a Park-lane address and at the Carlton
Club.
“I had already got into my car and was
just going to drive on, when a thought sud-
denly struck me. Why not combine a good
action with profit ?
‘“Were you serious when you mentioned
the thousand pounds?’ I asked. ‘I would
gladly take on the responsibility for that!’
“Well, to cut a long story short we fixed
it. up. He was most unwilling at first, but
I pointed out that I had a clean driving
record and that it was unlikely that I would
be seriously inconvenienced. It didn’t matter
to the poor suicide, in any case; it. was
really just a matter for us two.
“‘Most sporting of you,’ he said.
“He seemed a real thoroughbred, and I
am quite honest when I say that I did it
as much because I liked him as for the
money; there was a sort of personal mag-
netism about him.
“When it was all arranged he got out. his
cheque-book. ‘Shall I discharge my indebted-
ness to you by cheque,’ he asked, ‘or do
you think it would be better that there should
be no record of our transaction?’ There
was no question of my not trusting him, so
I agreed that it had better stand over.
“ ‘Then perhaps you could make it con-
venient t 0 call at my club, say, next Thurs-
day. If you are doing nothing come to
lunch.’
“Then we said good-bye, and he got into
his very opulent car and drove away. I
put my Morris into the position in which
his car had been, wandered round and round
it to obliterate any tyre marks, did a few
things to the front of the car with a hammer,
and then settled down to await events. I
can tell you I felt quite happy about things ;
it looked as if I was going to get all the
expenses of my trip paid for me.
“An hour later a bobby came along on a
bicycle, and I told him Sir Gerald’s story as
happening to me. He went away to get on
the telephone, and after a long wait an am-
bulance and some more policemen turned up.
I was glad to see the last of that corpse;
the sight of it was getting on my nerves.
I followed in the Morris with one police-
man with me, and we fetched up at the
police court of the little market town, Bish-
op's Stortford, just as it was getting light.
Here they took down my statement and I
signed it. I hung about that wretched place
all day, and twice more I was interviewed
by the police. Where had I been coming
from, and where was I going to? What had
I had to drink that evening, arid where had
I had it? And could I give any references?
“Next day the inquest opened, and again
I told my yarn. Various policemen got up
and made statements. A surgeon gave a
list of the injuries, and it lasted nearly half
an hour. Twenty-three bones had been
smashed. Yes, the car must have been tra-
velling at a very great speed to inflict such
injuries. Then the .Court adjourned in order
that the police might make inquiries and
establish the identity of the victim. It was
adjourned till the Thursday, the day on
which I was due to lunch with Sir Gerald.
I wrote to him, marking the letter 'Private
and personal,’ merely saying that I was
unable to come, and that I would write to
him again when the matter was finished.
“At the adjourned inquest it transpired
that the dead man’s name was Bunting,- that
lie was a farm-laborer, ; and that on the fatal
night he had been to visit some aged rela-
tives. All his family turned up to testify
that he was of a cheerful-disposition, and
the last person in the world who would com-
mit suicide. They also averred that he was
a teetotaller, a regular churchgoer, and had
excellent prospects.
“The Coroner summed up. He dealt at
length with the terrific injuries, he stressed
the point that I was known to have had at
least two drinks and that the police evidence
showed that I had been walking unsteadily
round and round the car, as was demon-
strated by the footmarks.
“He left it to the jury, and after about five
minutes they brought in a verdict of man-
slaughter against me.
“There was quite a hostile crowd, and I
was booed as I was being taken to the police
court. I was kept there in a cell till next
day, when I got my cousin from Cambridge
and a friend from town to come down and
go bail for me. The Condon papers had
headlines about it, ‘Twenty-three bones
smashed: Australian charged.’
“Then came the magistrates' court, and
the whole thing over again. Meanwhile my
license was suspended, and I had to sell the
old Morris —at a considerable, loss, of course.
After that I had to wait for two months for
the Assizes. I tried to buck myself up by
thinking that, after all, I was doing a very
decent action. It would all have been much
worse for Sir Gerald with his public posi-
tion and bad record, and lie was, I felt sure,
a thoroughly decent fellow. I knew he would
be feeling most terribly grateful to me, and
would be much upset by the way things were
turning out. He had never written back to
me, but I quite understood that this was a
wise precaution, and for my part I had deter-
mined not to write to him again until the
matter was ended. Still. I had a rotten
time, arid while the blasted thing was hang-
ing over me I went about feeling like a
criminal. Bits of the case —tlie worst bits,
of course —were cabled out to tlie papers
here in Sydney.
“Then came the Assizes, and I sat in the
dock with a warder on each side of me. I
had a barrister to defend me; he cost £s'*
a day, and I didn’t like him. We got the
same evidence all over again, only this time
the prosecution had got ray poor old cousin,
the don at Cambridge, as a witness. Yes.
I was quite sober when I left his house. Yes,
I had said I had an important engagement
in town at eleven. No, he did not know me
well. Yes (reluctantly), I was a distant
relation. The old boy crept out of the box
looking thoroughly ashamed. 'Later the.
Crown counsel made great play with my
important appointment in town, and my own
story of listening to nightingales. He asked
the jury to come to the conclusion that be-
tween the hours of nine arid twelve, when
the prisoner said lie was listening to the
nightingales, he was, in fact, drinking at
some place unknown, with the result that
lie drove his car in a reckless and negligent
manner, and was thus criminally respon-
sible for the death of this poor man.
“The summing up was the fairest tiling l
have ever heard. I was acquitted, but the
Judge warned me that I had had a narrow
escape.
“Oh. and that didn’t finish the court busi-
ness ; tlie man’s relatives were suing me
when I left, but my insurance were looking
after that.
“doing up in the train after my acquittal
I calculated how much the whole thing had
cost me—£47o. I hadn’t the slightest doubt
that Sir Gerald would pay all my out-of-
pocket expenses as well as the thousand. T
telephoned to his home directly I got to my
hotel. They said he was down at the House,
so down I went to Westminster and waited
in. the central hall while my card was being
taken up to him.
“I went over my list of expenses again
while I was waiting. T made it £540. He
would be sure to ask for it. I put on a bit
for wear and tear of the nerves; after all.
it had been a terrible strain.
“Finally he came, holding my card in
his hand, lie stood in the centre of the
hall, and his eyes travelled round, passing
over me. lie turned to the attendant who
had taken my card, and it was he who
pointed me out. He came to meet me with
a face like a mask. He looked at me as
if I had been a fly on the wall, and ignored
my outstretched hand.
“‘Mr. Lumber?’ he said, looking down at
my card to refresh liis memory; ‘And what
can I do for you?’
“‘I had the pleasure of meeting you.’ I
said, ‘on the night of Tune I<s on the Cam-
bridge-road—under peculiar circumstances.’
“ ‘lndeed,’ he answered stiffly; ‘I have no
recollection of it.’
“Somewhere a bell started ringing, and
the swine turned as though to go away.
“ ‘You owe me a thousand quid,’ I said
angrilv, ‘and I damned well mean to have
it. You ran over and killed’
“ ‘Mr. Ramber,’ he answered, ‘T cannot
pretend to understand you. but please re-
member that both blackmail and perjury are
drastically punished in this country. I
cannot talk wPh you any more, as I hear
the division bell and must go.’ • v
“He hurried off, leaving me inarticulate
and foaming.
“A policeman, noticing me. came up to
console. ‘lt’s the division bell, sir. Your
friend, he had to go. They don’t ’arf earn
their four hundred a year, they don’t. It s
the Corrupt Practices Bill up for the third
reading.’ ,
“Well, what could I do? There was only
one thing possible. Next day I booked my
passage back to Australia.”

]\JINE out of every ten persons suffer more or less from
Liver Complaint. That feeling of “No energy”
and Not too well ” are but symptoms of a weak and
disordered system. Weak, because the whole vitality is
absorbed, inactive Kidneys, and constipated Bowels,
b or not only is the Liver the largest and one of the most
important organs in the human body, but when deranged
it becomes a source of endless suffering. When the Liver
is clogged by the inactivity of the Kidneys and Bowels
it becomes torpid, and fails to filter the bile from the
blood, thus producing Biliousness, and a general impair-
ment of the digestive system. There is little use of treat-
ing the Liver separately, as it can never be set right until
tlie Kidneys and Bowels are made active in removing the
waste matter from the Blood. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Fills are a searching cleansing remedy. They put a move
in your Bowels, life into the Liver, and tone the Stomach
—thus bracing up the system generally.

WORMS
And the best method of Treatment.
Worms, by their movements and the inter-
ruption they offer to the contents of the
Bowels, generally occasion pain or uneasi-
ness in the Abdomen, sometimes spasmodic,
sometimes gnawing and biting, and not in-
frequently of a vague, indescribable char-
acter, and yet very distressing. Sympathetic
with this is a sensation of itching at the
Nostrils, producing a disposition to pick the
Nose, which is characteristic of the affection.
The Bowels are often disordered, sometimes
relaxed, as in Dysentery. The appetite is
exceedingly variable, in some cast's natural,
in others deficient, craving or depraved, one
condition not infrequently alternating with
another. The Abdomen is often hard, swol-
len, and tympanetic, the breath heavy or
foetid, and tongue furred, with disagreeable
taste, and a copious flow of saliva; swelling
of the upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils, and
disposition to grind the teeth during the
sleep are other characteristic symptoms. Th
effects, however, often extend beyond th
Alimentary Canal, and various derangement
of health are experienced in consequence
either of the direct irritation of the worms
or of the disordered digestion which they
occasion. Among the most common of these
are nervous affections, such as fretfulness
irritation of temper, wakefulness or disposi
tion to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, sud
den starting out of sleep, as if from fright
dizziness, spasmodic movements of the eye-
lids, dilated pupils, perverted vision, tem-
porary blindness and deafness. General con-
vulsions are not infrequent in children, anc
symptoms strongly resembling “Water on
the Brain” have been ascribed to worms, and
have ceased on their expulsion.
Infallible Remedy
Writes Lady from New Zealand.
Mrs. B. Leece, Albert Street, Pukekohe,
N.Z., writes: —“l can speak favorably of
I)r. Morse’s Indian Boot Pills as a good
family medicine for most ailments affecting
members of the household. Also with refer-
ence to Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pel-
lets, I can state that this remedy for expel-
ling worms from the bowels is really excellent
and an infallible remedy.”
Thread Worms
Expelled by Comstock's
“Dead Shot" Worm Pellets.
Mr. C. Beacon, Group 59, Boallia, via
Busselton, W.A., writes “It is with plea-
sure that I write to say I am exceptionally
satisfied with the results obtained from Com-
stock’s ‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets given in
conjunction with Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills to my child, aged 13, who was suffer-
ing with Thread Worms. At first I tried
senna in place of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills as an opening medicine, but the results
were not nearly so satisfactory as when I
used the pills. Should qny future occasion
arise where treatment for worms is required.
I shall always use your Comstock’s ‘Dead
Shot’ Worm Pellets and Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, and will gladly recommend same
to anyone I know.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets are
a purely vegetable medicinal preparation,
compounded on a scientific principle for the
eradication of worms which infest the intes-
tines. They contain specific properties which
destroy the worms, but cause no injury to
the Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in the
form o'f a confection or lolly, have no dis-
agreeable taste or smell; but, on the con-
trary, inspire children to take them as they
would an ordinary sweet.
