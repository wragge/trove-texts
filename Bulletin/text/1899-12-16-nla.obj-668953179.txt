THE RED RAGE.
I explain the silvered passing of a ship at night,
The sweep of each sad lost wave,
The dwindling boom of the steel thing’s striving,
The 'ittle cry of a man to a man,
A shadow falling across the greyer night,
And the sinking of the small star;
Then the waste, the far waste of waters,
And the soft lashing of black waves
For long and in loneliness.
Remember, thou, 0 ship of love,
Thou leavest a far waste of waters,
And the soft lashing of black waves
For long and in loneliness.
STEPHEN CRANT.
“On Our Selection."
SO recent and familiar are the sketches re-
printed under this title (The Bulletin Co. ;
65.) that one feels the lack of perspective in
criticising them. It is desirable for Daniel
or anybody else to come to judgment with a head
cleared of preconceptions, a hand which has not
meddlgd in the matter set for trial. In ten years’
time we will know better where Arthur Davis
stands from the point of view of literature or of
life. Even at present, however, it is clear that
“Steele Rudd” (to give him his better-known
pseudonym) is to be praised for verisimilitude and
for humour. His book is not pretentious ; but
most people in the bush will find it eminently
readable. The vicissitudes of life “On Our
Selection ” are in a general way typical of whab
has happened, or is happening, in many a
pioneers’ district of Australia. “Old Dad’s”
struggles with crops, his troubles with the store-
keeper, his expedients for raising the wind, his
anxieties and unquenchable hopes, could be
paralleled a thousand times among the men
on the land. The book is only removed
from the type because it follows so closely
the adventures of a single family be-
cause the characters are so thoroughly indivi-
dualised, so clearly seen, that you could meet
them anywhere and name them at once. Many
of the traits of Dad, and Mother, and Joe, and
Dave, and the rest, have evolved from the circum-
stances of their life, and are common to their
class; but the vivid and intimate detail with
which the author surrounds them is their own
peculiar birthright. They are like some of
Dickens’s characters—Mrs. Gamp or Pecksniff,
for example : we all know a Pecksniff; but know-
ledge of the Pecksniff is confined to the people
who have read “Martin Chuzzlewit.”
Carrying the same characters through 250 pages,
Arthur Davis gains a continuity of interest which
almost takes the place of plot. He has been
necessarily confined to salient incidents of his
Belection-life, seeing that only these were worth
recording; but on the whole the lights and
shadows are not disproportioned to probability
or fact. The family is much oftener in
money-trouble than out of it; but many whose
lot apparently lies in far more prospei’bus places
would be glad to exchange the ability to draw
cheques for the health and light hearts which the
denizens of “ Our Selection ” share as a matter
of course. Though Sal never wore stockings, ex-
cept, perhaps, to a funeral—which rarely hap-
pened—“ for the Creek wasn’t much of a place for
sport ” —she was infinitely better off than Miss
Ribbone, the ansemic schoolmistress, who couldn’t
—or wouldn’t —eat pumpkin. And old Dad’s hard
labour is rewarded at last; he sees himself on the
road to competence, and can afford to sit down
with Mother in the heart’s-ease of content, and
watch his dozen ohildren play their parts.
Many books much fuller of information, much
more skilled in a literary sense, could be written
without giving the graphic pictures of bush life
presented in “On Our Selection.” The author is
■o simple, so natural, that few people will realise
at first how very rare is the talent which he ex-
hibits. The concluding chapter, “One Christ-
mas,” for example, may challenge comparison
with Dickens’s “ Christmas Carol ” for fun, and
swing, and spirit. It is far less elaborate, of
course—far less rhetorical; but to Australians, at
least, it is more real and convincing. The story
of “The Parson and the Scone” is inimitably
told ; but so, too, is the story of Dave’s snake bite,
of the training of old Bess to win the Overhaul
Handicap, or of half-a-dozen other episodes of
“Our Selection’s” history. In Arthur Davis,
indeed, we have the first Australian humourist
who has risen to the eminence of a Book ; he takes
as a writer of humourous prose the place which
A. B. Paterson holds as a writer of humourous
verse ; and is even more racy of the soil-
Lawson’s is a saturnine humour ; but Paterson
and Davis bubble with spontaneous fun.
The first chapters of “ Our Selection ”
are an almost unrelieved record of failure and dis-
appointment ; but the story could hardly be less
gloomy. The tragedy in and beneath the lines is
only remembered for the comedy distilled from it;
the clouds are only used to show the silver lining.
And though the author is not always at his best,
there is probably more hearty fun, more honest
laughter, in his book than in any other yet issued
in Australia. His spirit is always the spirit of
Humour : occasionally happy phrase helps him,
but his fun is in himself, not in his phrases. Dad’s
celebrated racing mare Bess used to fly past with
Dave in the stirrups watching the shadow—
“ when there was one : she was a little too fine to
throw a shadow always.” When Kate was
married everyone thought she looked very nice—
“and orange blossoms ! You’d think she was an
orange-tree with a new bed-curtain thrown over
it.” But such haphazard quotation, unlike the
prayer of the righteous, availeth nothing.
“On Our Selection ” is illustrated by nearly 80
blocks from drawings by Fischer, Fullwood, Lam-
bert, Leist, Mahony, and Vincent. With a few
exceptions, the illustrations are adequate and in-
teresting, and some of them could not easily be
bettered.
The Lake of Gaube.
THE sun is lord and god, sublime, serene,
And sovereign on the mountains ; earth
and air
Lie prone in passion, blind with bliss un-
seen
By force of sight and might of rapture, fair
As dreams that die and know not what they were.
The lawns, the gorges, and the peaks, are one
Glad glory, thrilled with sense of unison
In strong, compulsive silence of the sun.
Flowers dense and keen as midnight stars aflame
And living things of light like flames in flower
That glance and flash as though no hand might
tame
Lightnings whose life outshone their stormlit
hour
And played and laughed on earth, with all their
power
Gone, and with all their joy of life made long
And harmless as the lightning life of song,
Shine sweet like stars when darkness feels them
strong. .
The deep mild purple flaked with moonbright
gold
That makes' the scales seem flowers of hardened
light,
The flamelike tongue, the feet that noon leaves
cold,
The kindly trust in man, when once the sight
Grew less than strange, and faith bade fear take
flight,
Outlive the little, harmless life that shone
And gladdened eyes that loved it, and was gone
Ere love might fear that fear had looked thereon.
Fear held the bright thing hateful, even as fear,
Whose name is one with hate and horror, saith
That heaven, the dark deep heaven of water near,
Is deadly deep as hell and dark as death.
The rapturous plunge that quickens blood and
breath
With pause more sweet than passion, ere they
strive . 7,/ :■ 7
To raise again the limbs that yet would dive
Deeper, should there have slain the soul alive.
As the bright salamander in fire of the noonshine
exults and is glad of his day,
The spirit that quickens my body rejoices to pass
from the sunlight away,
To pass from the glow of the mountainous flower-
age, the high multitudinous bloom,
Far down through the fathomless night of the
water, the gladness of silence and gloom.
Death-dark and delicious as death in the dream
of a lover and dreamer may be,
It clasps and encompasses body and soul with
delight to be living and free:
Free iitterly now, though the freedom endure but
the space of a perilous breath,
And living, though girdled about with the dark-
ness, and coldness, and strangeness of death:
Each limb and each pulse of the body rejoicing,
each nerve of the spirit at rest,
All sense of the soul’s life rapture, a passionate
peace in its blindness blest.
So plunges the downward swimmer, embraced of
the water unfathomed of man,
The darkness unplummeted, icier than seas in
midwinter, for blessing or ban :
And swiftly and sweetly, when strength and
breath fall short and the dive is done,
Shoots up as a shaft from the dark depth shot,
sped straight into sight of the sun ;
And sheer through the snow-soft water, more dark
than the roof of the pines above,
Strikes forth, and is glad as a bird whose flight is
impelled and sustained of love.
As a sea-mew’s love of the sea-wind breasted and
ridden for rapture’s sake
Is the love of his body and soul for the darkling
delight of the soundless lake :
As the silent speed of a dream too living to live for
a thought’s space more
Is the flight of his limbs through the still strong
ohill of the darkness from shore to shore.
Might life be as this is and death be as life that
casts off time as a robe,
The likeness of infinite heaven were a symbol
revealed of the lake of Gaube.
Whose thought has fathomed and measured
The darkness of life and of death,
The secret within them treasured,
The spirit that is not breath ?
Whose vision has yet beholden
The splendour of death and of life ?
Though sunset as dawn be golden,
Is the word of them peace, not strife ?
Deep silence answers : the glory
We dream of may be but a dream,
And the sun of the soul wax hoary
As ashes that show not a gleam.
But well shall it be with us ever
Who drive through the darkness here,
If the soul that we live by never,
For aught that a lie saith, fear.
Algernon Charles Swinburne
in The Bookman.
The Cat.
FEW subjects are at once so difficult and so
easy to approach as that of the cat —our
tiny, intimate tiger. One may purr com-
monplace, but her elusive individuality
defies verbal parallel. We have in our rich but
unsuggestive language no words ambiguously soft
enough to express the bittersweetness of the cat.
I would say that I refer uncompromisingly to
the Persian cat, to the beautiful feline wonder
with a smouldering Eastern fire in her sombre,
unwinking eyes of emerakl-amber, and a plumy
silken tail rich in delicate nuances of expression
as a senora’s fan. The Persian cat is a perfect
symbol of the East: all the passion and cruelty,
languor and grace, and the hypnotic seductiveness
of the East are in her fur and her claws ; all the
evil and mystery and slow magic in her eyes. Her
chief characteristic is purely Oriental: —a certain
Persian curve, seen in ancient pictures of kings
and warriors and domed cities, which her back
possesses in a miraculous degree; I think that, in
truth, she must have originated it. It is stiff,
yet graceful, and quite imperial in its magnifi-
cence ; it is unyielding as cloth of gold, and
stately as the cocoanut palm ; it is the result of
centuries of autocracy, and it symbolises all that
the word Shah should express. This curve gives
her a regal distinction, setting her far above
ordinary catkind.
The sombre glory of a sulky Persian on a
window-sill has often caught my roving gaze. I
revel in that exquisite camel-curve of her sullen,
smooth back ; in the furry apex of each pointed
ear; the immobility of her whiskers, long as the
hair of Melisande; the steady glare of her
magnificent eyes like orange flames ; the seductive
whiteness of her shirtfront’s frilly fur, softer than
snow; and the splendid sweep of her tail over the
neat velvet paws so decorously placed. I confess
I have a tendency to treat the cat in a decorative
manner, for she is as remote as an ideal ; you
can never be quite at one with the cat. I prize
her more for her lovely lines than for her friend-
ship.
The common short-haired cat I have ever held
to be unworthy of notice : since she has an Egyp-
tian angularity—the result of much sanctity, arid
unattractive contours, an utter lack of line and of
that suavity which is the cat’s birthright, even if
it go no deeper than her fur. I connect the
common cat with the passte goddess Pasht; with
old, crumbling ruins and frowning, gloomy archi-
tecture ; with Memphis and Thebes ; with leagues
of desert sand; with mummies, skim-milk, rats,
and unmusical wailings. The Persian I associate
with rose-gardens and silence and starlight; with
cream and bulbuls; with broidered cushions and
scented fountains ; with splendid Saracenic curves
and domes ; and even with the lovely monotonous
cadence of Omar’s quatrains, —though Hafiz
catches her spirit better. I think it must be the
bulbuls which the Persian cat has slain and eaten
that give her voice its delicious, intimate timbre,
and her purr its rich pianissimo. The little
rippling Ederow! of the Persian is irresistibly
charming as three liquid notes of music. Indeed,
you will hear an echo of the cat-call in all music
of passionate intensity : whether it be the little
luxurious cry of content, or the wailing unrest of
limitless desire that floats up to us in the still
night-watches from the moonlit garden —as the
slim, black rover slinks across a silver patch of
lawn. . . .
Her easiness in affairs of the heart has en-
deared the oat to the French minor poet. He
finds her more subtle, complex, and mysterious
than Woman, and not half the trouble. He has
likened her to the Sphinx; he gazes in the limpid
lamps of her eyes, as she sits on his writing-desk,
and reads her burning thoughts, which, after all,
are probably of cream and canaries, and perhaps
the black Tom on the garden-wall. The poet
extols the perfect full-grown cat; but I am never
sure whether I prefer a fat sleepy cat or a little
three-cornered kitten. The kitten’s goat-like
poses of inimitable wickedness, and the unfathom-
able evil in its glittering yellow eyes when it is
thoroughly electric —towards nightfall—are stimu-
lating as the cat’s sinuous length of warm fur and
blinking green eyes are soothing and comfortable.
Speaking of oat and kitten, how curiously the
cat’s character changes as she grows up ! The boy
may be the father of the man, though this I
doubt, but assuredly the kitten is not the mother
of the cat. Contrast the brilliant devilry of the
kitten with the velvet calm of the cat. Why
does every cat change her mode of life entirely
when she attains her majority ? The cares.of life
enter largely into the feline scheme of existence,
but why that too sudden loss of joy ? Yet if the
cat is too grave, perhaps the kitten is a little too
three-cornered ; it lacks the rounded snake-like
charm of the mature beast. There is much of the
snake in the cat, though tradition holds her a
miniature tiger; a tabby cat is far more like a
section of an anaconda in her markings than like
a tiger.. Moreover, her back is almost as pliable
as a snake’s, she can ourl herself round so beauti-
fully ; her lines are all gracious—that is if she be
a Persian, for the short-haired cat is grotesquely
graceless, and incapable of a single curve. Of
such a breed as the latter is the witch’s black cat
of fable, a rococo creature now used merely for
the staring poster or the comio illustrated paper,
a vulgarised symbol of the Black Art. ...
I have ever deemed the term “ cat ” cold, and
utterly inexpressive of. the maddeningly seductive
beast it denotes ; and I have made the name of
Chytoon (pronounced Chittoon) for the furry
delight; though comparatively poor, it seems to
me to miss the mark by a little less. Yet no
name would.be adequate to express the cat. Her
personality is so insistent and overwhelming that
a label is almost an insult to it. She is so incon-
ceivably herself that any collection of letters
tacked on to her must seem a little irrelevant and
dependent. Nothing living is so self-supporting
and self-centred as the cat. For she is the Ego,
the unique type of the Me.

Here and There.
There’s to be a genuine Israelitish exodus of
artists from Australia next year. Hanson, Full-
wood, Fischer, Lambert, all talk of leaving us—
some to return soon, some “never, by God ! if I-
can help it.” For an artist, qua artist, Australia
is still a poor field; though the artistic handy
man, talented on half-a-dozen lines, can make a
very fair living—if he’s “ steady.” And, if there
is in Australia any father who has a bright boy
and does n’t know what to do with him, we badly
want a bush artist in black and white —there’s no
man in Australia who is a “ strong ” draughtsman
and has an adequate knowledge of the bush—of
bush life, scenes, sports, labours, animals, men
and women. Such a man is worth a big salary
to-day, and every year we have more need of
him.

A French writer lately visited and photo-
graphed the tomb of Edgar Poe and Baltimore.
When he printed his negative he found the
tomb surmounted by this sinister word
LIQUOR.
It is part of the sign of a drink-saloon just behind
the cemetery, painted in large letters as if to be
read by Poe’s unlucky ghost.

Lond. Outlook points out that Kipling’s
“ Rhyme of the Three Captains ” has a subtle
hidden meaning. It purports to refer to an
exploit of piratical Paul Jones, but it is really an
attack upon the American publisher who has
given Kipling so many bitter moments. The
ballad begins—
... At the close of a winter’s day,
Their anchors down by London Town the Three Great
Captains lay.
And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to
Skye, /
And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands
thereby,
And one was Master of the Thames from Limehonse to
Blackwall,
And he was Captain of the Fleet—the bravest of them all.
Their good guns guarded their great grey sides that were
thirty foot in the sheer,
When there came a certain trading brig with news of a
privateer.
The allusions are to William Black, Thomas
Hardy, and Walter Besant respectively; and to
them comes Kipling with the tale of his wrongs.
The tiio profess amazement; they have always
been well treated in America —
Your words be words of a lawless race, and the Law it
standeth thus : :
He comes of a race that have never a Law, and he never
has boarded us.
We ha’ sold him canvas and rope and spar—we know that
his price is fair,
And we know that he weeps for the Iaok of a Law as he
rides off Finisterre.
And Kipling sails off with his grievance unre-
dressed, ingeniously introducing the names of
the men who have refused to help him.
Then foresheet home as she lifts to the foam—we stand
on the outward tack.
We are paid in the coin of the white man’s trade—the
bezant is hard', ay, and black.
The frigate bird shall carry my word to the King and the
Orang-Laut, . ' .
How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed
in a Christian port;
How a man may he robbed in a Christian port while
Three Great Captains there
Shall dip their flag to a slaver’s rag—to show that his
trade is fair.

Swinburne’s new tragedy, “Rosamund, Queen
of the Lombards, ” seems full of old Italian pas-
sion. There is stabbing, and poisoning, and lust
galore. Judging by tit-bits culled for early English
notices, the work will add nothing to the author’s
fame. —And it was hinted the other day, in a judg-
ment based on English extracts, that Swinburne’s
new poem, “ The'Lake of Gaube,” was onlypretty
good. But it turns out to be a little better; so
amends are made for this and other misrepresen-
tation by printing the whole.
<£*
Our faults—our very great faults. First,
Somebody-s fault—who, in the notice of Man-
gan, printed Nov. 25, omitted a line of a quoted
verse from “The Time of the Barmecides” —
Then Youth was mine, and a fierce wild will,
And an iron arm in war,
etc. (“ G. M. W. ” is thanked for noting it.) Second,
the printer’s fault, who, on Deo. 2, transposed the
drawings of George Grey’s (discovered) cave-
paintings, so that “second” in the type should
have been “first.” Third, my own fault, in un-
accountably writing Charles, for Henry, Kingsley
(Dec. 9). The reference was to a comparison of
Australian flowers with English in “ The HiU-
yars and the Burtons ” (chap, xxxii.) —
If she and he and baby could only get back again to
the dear old majestic forests [of Australia], among the
Orchises, and Lobelias, and Grevilleas, with the delicious
aromatic scent of the bush to fill their nostrils, they
would be happy for evermore. How faint and sickly
these narcissuses smelt after all, beautiful as they were.
One little purple vanilla flower was worth them all. Bah i
these [English] flowers smelt like hair-oil, after the dear
little Oxalis of the plains.
One is bound to confess these ideas were attributed
to an Australian : none the less, it was in
Kingsley’s mind they grew.

Memoranda —
Lewis Melville’js new “ Life of Thackeray ” (2 vols. ; 32s.)
seems to be accepted as worthy, and wins reasonable
praise from English critics.
“ The Temple Shakespeare ” is to re-appear in twelve
volumes, with larger type.
Judged by his story in Christmas Black and White,
Stephen Crane does not improve, remaining brilliant and
—temporary.
A. T. Hodgson, Adelaide bookseller, claims that his
series of fifteen cheap recitation-books is “ the most up-
to-date collection of recitations existing ” —and the claim
seems justified. Just-issued Part 15 includes Ogilvie’s
“ Taken Over” and “Off the Grass.”
Photographers are referred to a very interesting article
on telescope-photography in. Nov. Scribner. The illus-
trated results of attaching a telescope lens to an ordinary
camera are really good.

Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.’

• These Bitters I recommend in DYSPEPSIA, CHRONIC RHEUMATISM and CUT A

** Whipping the Cat.”
When you’ve been and made a bloomer
What’s the use of lookin’ blue?
Laugh and face the chaps around yer—
They have done far worse than you.
Don’t let others see yer chewin’
’Cause yer head won’t fit yer hat;
Knock off mopin’—and be doin’
Anything but whip the cat.
Lord ! it makes us feel quite fishy
When our mate harps on the “ Wish he
Hadn’t been and blewed his money on that little
burst he had.”
And the theme of every sentence
Is a forty pound repentance
For the paltry three-and-tenpence spent in beer
that made him bad.
Put away those priest-made notions
That “ mankind was made to mourn ” :
That “we’re only here to fit us
For a brighter, happier morn.”
This is all the life we’re sure of ;
Laugh—and chance the life elsewhere I
Our sole duty on the earth is
To be happy while we’re here.
So, when you’ve been getting beerful,
Don’t sit whining, glum, and tearful.
Keep your pecker up ! look cheerful ! Paste this
maxim in your hat :
When your sin’s worth only tenpence,
Don’t waste pounds in vain repentance :
Keep your eye on this short sentence —“ Life’s too
short to whip the cat.”
M.L. Chas. J. Lowell.
Bush Analogy.
What are the swift hours told
Each day with a ceaseless chime,
But swagmen bold, with their blankets rolled,
On the wallaby-tracks of Time.
What’s man, when all is said,
But a drover to and fro,
Whose years are fed with a three-score spread
On the stock-reserves of Woe.
What is Death but a shearer clean ?
A ringer, with lives for sheep,—
His shear-blades keen have an ebon sheen,
And his tally the graveyards keep.

The Slack-soil Teams.
For God hath made the Black-soil; and spread it
near and far,
From down the sweeping Namoi bends, away to
Talbragar :
It's richness no man questions, its wealth no man
denies,
But Sheol ’tis in rain time, and Tophet when it
dries.
The drought hath cracked and torn it; the rain
hath lent it seams.
God help the Black-soil teamster! God help the
Black-soil teams!
God grace the toiling teamster! God give him
strength and hope!
Spare swingle-bars and traces, spare curses,
chains and rope!
A-ploughing down the gilgas—the mud as close as
glue— j
A-plunging past the myall, the squatter's wool
goes through ! i
A-plunging through the gilgas, a-ploughing up
the track,
With four and twenty horses, the squatter’s stores
come back:
New saddles for the stockmen, new dresses for the
girls—
And round he straining leader the wicked whip-
thong cu. ’s.
Their flanks ai\ all a-lather, the black mud axle-
high.
But trust the Black-soil teamster! He’ll take her
through or die.
Who sees the trace-chains snapping, who sees the
harness fly,
May kneel and pray for weather ; may kneel and
ask it dry.
But when the starved team staggers across a sun-
scorched plain,
He’ll change his plea, mayhappen, and kneel and
pray for rain.
But rain, or drought, whatever, all flood, or dry
reverse,
The teamster’s duty’s patent : Pull out ! pull
through ! and curse.
Ay, pull her down the rivers, drag through the
clinging loam,
Then turn-about, my brother, curse hard, and
crawl her home!
God grant him grace hereafter ; of grace aye hath
he dearth, —
Though fearing no hereafter—whose Hell is all on
Earth.
Sun-tanned, mud-caked and hairy ; morose and
most profane,
God grace the Lean Lost Legion who plod the
Black-soil Plain !

A COMPLICATION OF TROUBLES.
Glenkenich Estate, Pomahaka, N.Z.
August 17 th, 1899.
Mr. W. WEBBER,
Sole Inventor of VITADATIO.
Dear Sir, —I got yours of August 4th, asking me to give full particulars of
what was wrong with me, and how I came to take VITADATIO. I have a
brother, J. R. MacKenzie who for five or six years suffered frightfully from
Indigestion, Pains, and Cramp, which came on suddenly and gave great pain.
Everyone around here knows and remembers the times he used to be in bed—
sometimes for weeks. He started taking VITADATIO, and has never had an
attack since.
I had been down South prospecting dredging claims, and having to be out in
the rain and wet during last winter, I got a very severe cold, which terminated in
Influenza, Loss of Voice and a Bad Cough. I came here after having been bad for
about two weeks, when my brother, John R. MacKenzie, told me that YITADATIO
had cured his Indigestion and Stomach Cramps, and that I ought to try it. I took
it for about three days, with the result that it put me thoroughly right. I consider
it the most wonderful Medicine on earth, and am sure that all those who have
benefited along with me tender you their sincerest thanks.
Yours faithfully,
G. IT. MacKenzie,

Mr. TV. O. Hearne. — Dear Sir,— l am writing to te!l you
about, the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without henelit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the tu r o lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks. —Yours gratefully,

I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis

not had one night’s rest for a week. 1 started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it i wice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to ihe Lord
for adding His blessing, 1 was quite well, and walked into
town and hack without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 mom Its—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain ami distr ss in

SPITTING UP BLOOD.
TnE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY IIEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows:—“As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam fueling stronger than I have for years. 1
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, hut llearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. 1 feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I 'must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. 1
have tried to get it made up here, and let tny chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since 1 commenced to take it. 1 used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more 1 must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since 1 wrote you. Her cough was so had she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send’ it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any .more medicine.
So volt see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

The Westralian Boer.
A few days ago the Westralian Upper House
rejected the existing Federal Constitution as
drafted by the Convention and amended by
the Premiers’ Conference, also the proposed
Federal Constitution as drawn up by the
Westralian Parliamentary Committee, and
decided to have nothing to do with either of
them. This brings one chapter of Federal
history to an end so far as Westralia is con-
cerned. In that province the people were
not allowed to elect their own delegates to
the Federal Convention, so they had no
hand in drafting the Bill, and it has been
decided by the ’Groper Upper House
that they are not to be consulted about its
acceptance or. rejection either. They
have had no voice in the matter from
first to last, and the ’Groper Legislature
resolves that they are not to have any. And
now the goldfields, which are strongly
Federal, and which represent the bulk of
the population, though they have only a
ridiculously small fraction of the Parliamen-
tary representation, have’ to consider what
is to be done next.
* * * *
The situation is a remarkable one. The
Outlanders in Kalgoorlie—the Johannesburg
of Westralia—and a few other centres, repre-
sent two-thirds of the population, and pay
much more than two-thirds of the taxes, but
by a judicious distribution of membership
they have about one-fifteenth of the Parlia-
mentary representation. The number of
electors to one M.L.A. varies from 42 (!), in
the purely-Groper constituency of Ash-
burton, to 5674 and 3364, in the almost
wholly Outlander constituencies of Fast
Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. Therefore, the
Outlander is subjected to a shameful system
of taxation without representation, and the
citizen in W.A. (provided he wasn’t born in
W.A.) is under practically the same dis-
abilities as the alien in the Transvaal and
other countries. The taxes are carefully
adjusted, as far as possible, to strike the Out-
lander and miss the Groper—there is a tax on
mining-dividends because the Outlander
is a miner, and none on land because
the W.A. Boer is a landowner and agricul-
turist or pastoralist. The Westralian Out-
lander has far worse grievances against the
W.A. Boer than the South African Out-
lander alleges against his Boer. The former
is oppressed and despised by men of his own
speech who haven’t even the excuse of old-
standing racial hatreds. He is a citizen, yet
he is treated in almost exactly the same way
as the African Boer treats an alien. He
didn’t steal W.A. in ’77 and shed ’Groper
blood in a hard-fought war of independence ;
nor did he send a Jameson in ’95 to raid the
’Groper country in time of peace and shoot
down the ’Groper house-father ; nor did he
invite any foreign Power to invade and steal
the ’Groper country ; therefore his Boer
hasn’t been driven to refuse him fair Parlia-
mentary representation in self-defence. The
Westralian Boer treats the Outlander citizen,
without provocation, almost exactly as the
South African Boer treats the Outlander
alien, with the worst kind of provocation.
He received the Federal petition of over
20,000 Outlander citizens with exactly the
same indifference as the South African Boer
treated similar petitions from aliens. And
now, in the matter of Federation, the corrupt
W.A. oligarchy has practically abolished the
self-governing rights of the electoral majority
altogether.
♦ * • *
The first idea, of course, in such a case is
that the principal goldfield districts—the
ones peopled mainly by Outlander citizens —
should separate peacefully from the part of
the province where the old ’Gropers pre-
dominate, and let each party go its own
road. The Federationists constitute a
majority of the people, a majority of the
electors, and a majority of the W.A. citizens
(if it wasn’t certain that they did the paro-
chial element ip Parliament, wouldn’t be so
desperately anxious to" avoid a popular vote
on the Convention Bill), and they also re-
present a great majority of the tax-paying
element. Therefore when they demand
Separation that they may become a por-
tion of the Commonwealth, the way ought
to be clear. But it certainly isn’t.
Through the strange and wonderful system
whereby 112 ’Gropers at Ashburton and
De Grey return two members, and over 9000
Outlander citizens at Coolgardie and East
Kalgoorlie do exactly the same, the local
Boer minority runs the whole show, and
while paying very little taxes itself it gaily
spends the money and decides the destinies
of the Outlander majority. Therefore it is
no earthly good for the majority to demand
separation from the local Parliament. The
next alternative is an appeal to the British
Government. According to the W.A. Con-
stitution the British Government reserves
the power to subdivide W.A. without the
consent of the local Parliament. And ac-
cording to the Colonial Boundaries Act of
later date the British Government has not
the power to subdivide any self-governing
province unless with the consent of the local
Parliament. The latter Act, however, does
not specifically repeal the clause above-men-
tioned in the W.A. Constitution, so it is
still just possible that the British Govern-
ment will hold that it has power to establish
the goldfields as a separate province, which
can then enter the Commonwealth on its
own account. At all events the experiment
of a monster petition to the British Govern-
ment based on the Constitution Act is worth
trying.
* * » *
In the light of the Transvaal trouble,
however, there is certainly room for an
appeal to the British Government on another
ground. The whole basis of the Transvaal
shindy is the allegation that certain British
subjects, forming a majority of the popula-
tion, were heavily taxed and denied ade-
quate representation by a Dutch minority.
In Westralia the majority is still more
heavily taxed, and is in almost an equal
degree denied adequate representation by a
non-alien minority. This is a hun-
dred times worse, for the citizen is en-
titled to representation while the alien isn’t.
Unless the British Government proposes to
go back on all its theories about the rights
of British subjects, a demand for justice
based on this ground should induce it to take
such steps as would wipe the Com Forrest
oligarchy off the face of the earth.
An appeal to the other provinces to
send contingents to the relief of their op-
pressed fellow-countrymen in W.A. would
also be strictly in order according to the
same precedent. Judging, too, by the view
which the British Government and the Aus-
tralian provinces took of the doings of the
Johannesburg Reform Committee in ’95, it
would be a perfectly appropriate thing for a
Kalgoorlie Reform Committee to lay in arms
and organise the mining community, with a
view to the forcible assertion of the right of
the majority to govern and of the noble prin-
ciple that taxation and representation should
go together. There is no legal way of com-
pelling the little ’Groper minority to do jus-
tice to the majority in the matter of Parlia-
mentary representation. If it is decided
that the Colonial Boundaries Act overrides
the division clause in the Westralian Consti-
tution, then there is also no appeal to any
legal authority outside. And when the
minority has so fixed the law that there is no
legal redress for a huge injustice suffered by
the majority, then either the law must go
down or the alleged rights of British
citizens must be trodden on with
impunity and both feet. In view of
the attitude which the British Govern-
ment has taken up in the Transvaal the
W.A. Separationists have a right to ask
it in forcible terms if it is going to let
a crowd of oppressed Britons be trodden
on without sending them military aid,
and if a Briton at Kalgoorlie isn’t as
good as one at Johannesburg. Also, con-
sidering that the ’Groper Government is
shrieking by force of arms over the Johannes-
burg Outlander, it can’t complain if the
Kalgoorlie Outlander also became violent in
his language and proceedings.
* * * *
Oije thing which is certain amid much con-
fusion and uncertainty is that Federation in
Westralia is only delayed. The majority is
• for it. The majority is strong enough, if it
gets really angry, to shove the Oom Forrest
oligarchy into the Indian Ocean. A majority
of that size can’t be flouted for ever, and if
the minority goes on as it is doing it will be
a very angry and revengeful majority by
the time its inevitable turn arrives. If
the Britisher was one-tenth as excited
when he is deprived of the genuine rights
of his actual citizenship by an English-
speaking minority as he is when de-
prived by a Dutch-speaking minority of a
purely imaginary right to become a citizen,
the Oom Forrest oligarchy would have fled
into the hills before now. But, however
slow and patient the Britisher may be, time
is on the side of the Fede'rationists. Also,
there is a great deal of time, and it lasts very
long, while even Premier John is but a thing
of a day at the best.
Exit Turner.
Among the various Australian Premiers who
have disappeared in the downfall of the past
few weeks the one this paper most regreis is
George Turner, of Victoria. The little plain
man in the plain brown suit came nearer than
any other Premier that any Australian pro-
vince has possessed in the last 20 years to filling
this country’s biggest public want. An honest,
courageous and far-seeing financier is what
Australia needs more than it needs any. Other
kind of politician, and it almost got what it
wanted when it got Turner. There are any
number of men willing to support democratic
measures—and to borrow large sums of money.
There are any number who will put their whole
souls into the question of One-man-one-vote
and Upper House reform, and a big loan ; who
will fight hard for the breaking-up of grievous
land-monopolies, and for land nationalisation,
and State banking, and a big loan ; who
will strive after better education and shorter
hours, and the solution of the problem of
the unemployed, and the abolition of the
other grievous social evils which oppress the
country, and after lots of big loans. But there
is hardly one who will tell the Australian
people that the easy, shiftless, sloppy, non-self-
reliant policy of depending on big loans to do
things for us, instead of doing them for our-
selves, is the cancer that is eating out the
manhood of the Australian people. There are
1000 reformers who are willing to devote them-
selves to the easy reforms which don’t involve
extra taxation and a stoppage of the influx of
sham affluence which has made Australia some
sort of a fool’s paradise, for one who will
tackle the hard reform which consists in teach-
ing the Australian people not to be beggars at
John Bull’s gate any longer. For the first
kind of reformer has only to tickle the vanity
of the people, and tell them that it is their mis-
sion to lead the world in the matter of reform ;
the second kind has to tell the Australian
nation that it has been on the whole a lazy,
improvident lotus-eater, which, with great
chances and great riches, hadn’t the courage or
the grit to pay its own way and keep honest.
To ( leorge Turner’s credit he came nearer to
explaining these unpleasant facts than any
other Australian Premier of his time, or per-
haps of any previous time.
* » * *
Turner reduced the expenditure of bor-
rowed money to a minimum, and tried hard to
keep it there. During the five years of his
Premiership Victoria spent £1,894,794 of loan
funds, while N.S.W. spent £7,827,300, Queens-
land (with less than half Victoria’s population)
spent £3,962,472, South Australia (with less
than a third of Victoria’s population) spent
£2,470,744, and Westralia (with one-seventh
Victoria’s population) got through £6,795,713.
He also paid off some £600,000 of old deficit
out of revenue, so he really only increased the
public debt in five years by about £1,300,000.
Probably he would have done still better if he
had been better supported. But the immove-
able Upper House blocked his schemes
for getting extra revenue out of an
increased land - tax. The press and the
public were solid on the fact that the
country couldn’t stand any extra taxation—•
every Australian province is solid on that point
at all times. The demand for public works
was incessant and deafening and universal.
And on top of all the great David Syme organ,
which makes and unmakes Ministries in Vic-
toria, “ turned dog ” on the country and began
to scream for big loans and booms and bursts
once more. With better times, and a com-
munity whose moral backbone wasn’t rotted
away by years of the easy bogus affluence that
is based on debt, and with even one honest and
influential local paper to give him an enthusi-
astic support, Turner might possibly have
abolished borrowing altogether, and inaugur-
ated a policy of paying for public works out of
land revenue and ordinary taxation. At all
events he is the only Australian Premier for
the last score of years who even looked capable
of such a thing.
* • * •
When the Turner Government started its
career of financial reform the Victorian press
and Victorian public opinion rained good ad-
vice on it for 40 days and 40 nights. In a
general way it was requested to do five things.
It was to stop the hideous deficits of previous
administrations; it wasn’t to be mean and
cheese-paring and miserly in its expenditure ;
it wasn’t to increase taxation, for the country,
it was alleged, couldn’t stand it; it was to
build lots of public works in order to “ develope
the country’s resources”; and it was to keep
down borrowing. In other words, it was to
subtract ten from eight less than nothing and
have sixteen left. And when, after five years
of intense labor, it had made revenue cover
expenditure without any serious increase of
taxation, and had so far put the accounts
straight that one-fifth of the deficit was paid
off, the country rose and said some more things
to it.' They were mostly to the effect that the
time had come when it should reduce taxation ;
that the time had also come when it should
raise Public Service wages and salaries all
round ; and that the finances being now put
right (that was the customary expression) it was
now time to go in for big loans and for an
active public works policy. Victoria was so
insanely proud of having paid off a fifth of its
deficit, and got a fifth of the way towards
squaring its finances, that almost everybody
rose to whoop about “the finances being now
put right.” The country was in the position of
a man who, after being drunk for 15 years, had
partially sobered up for three days, and then
declared that, having now wholly abjured
liquor, it was time to start drinking again by
way of celebrating his sobriety, And inci-
dentally Victoria began to tell Turner about
this time that he was a mean, narrow-minded
cheese-parer for cutting down expenses in the
remorseless spirit he had shown ; that his one
extra tax (the income-tax) had “ driven foreign
capital out of the country ” —thereby largely
reducing the country’s indebtedness to the
foreign capitalist; that though he was put
into power for the express purpose of reducing
the - country’s liabilities his conduct in thus
reducing its liabilities was most reprehen-
sible ; and that Victoria w'anted a large-
minded man who, when he had £8,000,000 of
expenditure to pay out of £7,000,000 income,
would reduce taxation, and exercise a wise
liberality in splashing money about.
* * * »
The Turner Government made only one bad
mistake. It gave way to the clamor of the
AGE for a reducfi'o’n in the income-tax levied on
the ricli, so, when it devised its Old-Age Pen-
sion scheme, it had to propose finding the funds
by levying, a tax on the comparatively poor.
It might have pulled through even then by re-
ducing Lhe income-tax on the rich, which would
have pleased the rich ; and have passed the Old-
Age Pension law without levying any extra
taxat ion on the poor with which to pay the pen-
sions—which would also have pleased the poor.
It might simply have said, in a large, gener-
ous way, that the pensions would be paid
out of the surplus, and that it had sufficient
confidence in the future of this great country
to be sure there would be no difficulty about
the money, and anybody who hadn’t sufficient
confidence in the future of this great country
was unworthy of the honored name of Briton.
It would thereby have pleased almost every-
body and left the financial problem to take
care of itself as usual. This was what the Age
demanded ; said that intelligent preacher of
the gospel of Let-It-Slide :
There are no special funds for the salaries of the judi-
ciary or the Civil Service; none for the interest on the
public debt, and none for the deficiency on the railway
account. It is right to put Old Age Pensions on the same
footing. New Zealand has done so. Why should Vic-
toria not follow that fine example ?
The Age demanded the reduction of the income-
tax on the rich, the imposition of no other
taxes to make good the loss,-and an Old Age
Pension system which would cost about
£200,000 a year. Its theory was that the
surplus—which would probably be to a great
extent destroyed by the reduction of taxation,
and which was also wanted to pay off-old
deficits—should be further applied to pay Old
Age Pensions. And its beautifully-intelli-
gent reason was that Maoriland, which
has no old deficit to pay off, ' and no
Svme demanding a reduction of income-
tax, pays its pensions out of surplus.
Turner’s failure to undertake an annual lia-
bility of about .£200,000 without providing the
money to meet it did something towards his
Ministry’s downfall. Apart from that, it fell
because Victoria was tired of a very brief
period of comparative honesty. And now that
it is gone, The Bulletin expends this obituary
on it because it tried its hand at the reform
which Australia needs more than all others put
together, and made a decent success of it while
it lasted considering what hopeless material the
Australian people are for being reformed in
that particular direction. It went further than
any other Ministry in explaining to the Aus-
tralian nation that its greatest wants w r ere
courage, self-reliance, and sufficient indepen-
dence of spirit to pay its own way and be no
longer a grovelling borrower on the threshold
of J. Bull’s financial emporium. If Turner
had carried his policy to its legitimate conclu-
sion by announcing that he proposed to levy
such taxation as would enable the country to
leave off loans altogether and allot .£1,000,000 a
year for the construction of public works out of
revenue, he would have been more honest still.
But in that case his Ministry would probably
have lasted about five weeks instead of five
years, and his astonished country would have
talked afterwards about the time when an
apparently sane solicitor in a brown suit was
made Premier of Victoria and went raving mad
immediately afterwards.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“The Bulletin’s” Lay Sermon,
The Bulletin has been trying for a long time
to get a reliable definition of Loyalty. By way
of casting some light on the matter, it quotes
the following from one Parson Scott, of Foots-
cra.y (Vic.) :
Some even g-o so far in their hostile opposition to the
Empire as to desire the defeat of our army, which is com-
prised of their fellow-countrymen and co-relig'ionists. I
do not here stay to consider the propriety or impropriety
of such ill wishes or deny the right of freedom of opinion
and speech with reference to such grave matters ; but I
wish to say that if some claim the right to whisper sedi-
tion, and prove themselves traitors to the flag under
which they live in safe security, and almost boundless
liberty, they shall not deny me the right to characterise
them as men unworthy of the liberty they enjoy—as
recreants who merit the contempt of every loyalist—as
cowards who, having eaten the salt of generous hospi-
tality, desire the slaughter of their host, and as traitors
saturated with the venom of senseless revenge, but lack-
ing the courage to strike the power which encircles them
with her strong arm of protection.
Considering that the Boers are wholly Protes-
tant and that the British armies include Pro-
testants, Catholics, Mohammedans, Hindus,
Buddhists, Parsees, Jains, idolators, and sun-
dries, and that the British Empire is three-
fourths an empire of black, brown and yellow
men, the cry about our “ co-religionists ”is a
trifle mixed. But that is a mere side-issue.
The really interesting point is that the above
reverend gentleman, like every other true loyal-
ist and Jingo, denounces, as guilty of a black
and horrible crime, certain alleged persons who
don’t desire the great Mohammedan, Buddhist,
and Brahminee empire to win, or don’t desire
it hard enough. Loyalism, it appears, demands
that you should want your own crowd to win
right or wrong. If your own crowd is waging
a wholly unjustifiable war—well, unjustifiable
war is just plain murder, so parsonical loyalty
includes murder and approval of murder. In a
secondary sense, The Bulletin gathers that to
be loyal includes being a liar ; the duty of
every loyalist is to assert that his crowd is in
the right whether it is in the right or not, and
to say your own crowd isn’t in the right, how-
ever true the statement may be, is the blackest
sin ; therefore it is impossible to be unflinch-
ingly loyal without being a first-class liar.
Further, it involves being a slave who has no
soul or judgment of his own, but who always
approves of whatever the Salisbury and Bal-
four of the moment approve of. There was an
old, dead-and-gone Christ who said that it
was man’s duty to love his neighbor as himself,
and that axiom implies that you should consider
the other fellow’s cause as impartially as your
own, and give your sympathy to the other
man if you judge the other man to be in the
right, but the reverend howlers and worldlings
of to-day have forgotten that there ever was
such a person as Christ. The Bulletin, at
all events, is driven to the conviction that it
will never make a good loyalist. It isn’t a
good enough liar to always allege that Britain
is in the right whether it is or not, and
it isn’t a good enough murderer to feel
dead sure that it wants Britain to have
great success at killing the other man
whether Britain’s quarrel be just or unjust.
If the protection which Britain extends to Aus-
tralia—a protection which, in its active form,
has only consisted, so far, in the slaughter of


the Ballarat diggers by British troops, and in
certain services rendered by them in flogging
and otherwise keeping down the early convicts
—is to be repaid by the kind of loyalty which
consists in saying that Britain’s opponent is
wrong, whether he is or not, and wishing
Britain every success in killing him, whether
he deserves it or not—in other words, if it is
to be repaid by lying and by the cordial ap-
proval of murder—then it is bought altogether
too dearly. Reverend gentlemen, like the
parson of Footscray, allege that there is a most
unpleasant hell where liars go to, and give most
unpleasant descriptions thereof. And if any
man, in his effort to carry out the Scriptural
maxim of loving his neighbor as himself, takes
the trouble to investigate his neighbor’s side of
the quarrel as well as his own, and in so doing
becomes convinced that his neighbor and co-
religionist is in the right, and yet hollers
against his neighbor—well, he may be loyal,
but he assuredly is a liar. And, according to
the teaching of the rev. gentleman from Foots-
cray—where the evil smells come from—he will
be loyal a very short time and damned a very
long one. The Bulletin’s sermon ends sud-
denly here without any collection.

taw for the Lawyers.
Victoria’s Supreme Court continues to pursue
its absurd habit of subordinating justice to
legal precedent and flouting common-sense in
its exceeding regard for the forms and niceties
of the Law. In a recent case, the litigant—a
small boy—in opening a railway-crossing gate
for a lady to pass, had four of his fingers
crushed through the negligence of a railway-
signalman. He was so severely injured that he
lost two fingers from each hand, and for the
pain and suffering he had undergone as well as
for future pecuniary loss he sued for £IOOO
damages. Judge Hamilton tried the case, and
the jury of four awarded the full amount
claimed. The Judge was so impressed with
the justice of the verdict that he refused an
application for a new trial. Defendants then
appealed to the Full Court for a new trial, not
because the verdict was against the weight of
evidence, but solely because the jury had not
been properly directed as to the principle
which should guide it in arriving at the amount
of damage to be awarded. Judge Hamilton
told their Honors that he thought he had
omitted to specifically lay before the jury
the two grounds above-named on which
they might assess damages, whereupon
their Honors (the C.J., Holroyd and Hood)
promptly upset the verdict, the C. J. remarking
that it was quite probable the jury, instead of
compensating the hoy for past suffering and
future disability, had merely given him what it
estimated to he the value of his hands. The
difference is just the difference between twee-
dledum and tweedledee. At the worst, the
jury gave the boy what it thought was the
value of the members he had lost, whereas the
Full Court—so-called presumably because it is
full of empty quibbles—holds that it should
have given him the amount which it thinks he
will be deprived of through not having these
members. The distinction between eighteen-
ponce and Is. 6d. was never more learnedly
expounded. The result of this absurd decision
will be that there will be a new trial —unless
the lad’s parents are too poor to afford it, in
which case he will have to submit to being
bilked and swindled out of his rights. And, by
the way, it is a most disgraceful thing that a
State department should set up such miser-
able quibbles in opposition to an honest claim.
And this expense and denial of justice arises
through no fault of plaintiff’s ; the country,
through its Full Court, decides that all the
ruinous law costs he has already incurred are
wasted solely because the country supplied
him, in the inferior court, with a Judge who
didn’t do his work properly. If the Full Court
is right in its decision, then either Judge
Hamilton, who made the first trial abortive
through not putting the case in proper legal
form to the jury, should pay the costs of that
first trial, or the country should pay them
because it supplied that lamentably inefficient
Judge. And this rule applies in every case—
there are thousands of them and they are
occurring constantly everywhere—where the
litigant finds all his outlay wasted because the
judge made a mistake, which mistake caused
the verdict to be set aside. But it especially
applies in this instance. The country (through
the Railway Commissioner) is the defendant,
and the defendant claims that the plaintiff
must be put to ruinous expense, and his claim
against the defendant must be set aside, be-
cause the defendant supplied him with an
inefEf 'Ut Judge.
The Case of Jones.
Somehow or other the case of the Queen v.
John Jones was not reported in the papers the
other day. John Jones saw John Jones the
elder shadowing a lad who was carrying some
coppers in his hand. The lad, run into a
corner, turned round with his back to the wall
and put up his arm. Jones junior thereupon
banged the lad on the head, knocked out five
teeth, displaced his ear, and broke several of
his ribs—and then Jones the elder took the
coppers. The younger Jones was now charged
with maliciously wounding. Nobody to speak
of appeared to prosecute ; Mr. Edmund Bar-
ton, Q.C., defended. The facts already re-
capitulated having been given in evidence,
Mr. Barton asked Mr. Justice Griffith, who
presided, to say that there was no case to go to
the jury. His Honor said that he had been
astonished at such a case coming into the
court. He had no doubt whatever that Mr.
Barton was perfectly right in his contention ;
no offence had been disclosed. It was the un-
questioned duty of every man to go to the sup-
port of his parents, and, if he deemed it neces-
sary, to knock out all the teeth, and displace all
the ears, and shatter all the ribs of anybody
with whom the parent quarrelled or wanted to
quarrel. That the accused’s father in this case
was an able-bodied man, and the lad, his
opponent, puny, had nothing to do with the
case ; the action of the accused in remembering
only that the man was his father was dis-
tinctly praiseworthy, and fulfilled the best
traditions of the race. A suggestion had been
made that the accused’s father was engaged in
an attempt to steal the lad’s coppers. That
was beside the question. All the jury would
have to say was whether the man in the dock
was the son, or believed he was the son, of the
elder man. As his Honor did not think there
could be any doubt upon that point, he would
not trouble the jury, but would ask them to
return a verdict of not guilty. The jury found
accordingly. His Honor, in discharging the
accused, said that he (the latter) left the court
without a stain on his character.
The Free-Postage Fraud.
In a recent leading article Sydney Daily Tele-
graph gave notice in an obscure sort of way to
the Lyne Government that if it imposes news-
paper postage in N.S.W. the Telegraph’s
present warm support is likely to evaporate
considerably. It admitted, indeed, that “the
large bulk of the free mail matter now dealt
with ” does not consist of real newspapers, but
of bogus advertising sheets circulated at the
cost of the taxpayer for the sole purpose of
booming somebody’s private business, but it
declared manfully that the genuine paper (such
as the Sydney Daily Telegraph) ought still to
be carried at public expense. Here is its case
in its own words :
A newspaper in the legitimate sense of the word, is
one of the most effective educational agencies conceivable.
Its mission is to keep those who read it informed regard-
ing local current events, and the chief daily happenings
of the world. It furnishes day by day information on
every subject of general interest, without which intelli-
gent public opinion could not exist. ... A disposition
to further and further subsidise technical instruction is
one of the marked features of modern government. If it
is advantageous that the State should bear some of the
cost of imparting to individuals a correct knowledge of
engineering, agriculture, or cabinet-making, it is surely
as much so that the whole community should be given
facilities for obtaining the fullest possible information
concerning the movements of politics, the condition of
trades, the social, commercial, and financial progress
being made, and everything else that may be of use to
them in the conduct of daily life and the shaping of
future national conditions. Free carriage of newspapers
simply means better newspapers than the puhlic could
obtain—fuller information upon every matter that is of
interest to them. The keen competition existing be-
tween proprietaries causes the advantage conceded by
Government to be diffused among readers in the form of
enlarged journals and special work, which would not
otherwise be possible.
That is the case stated in a large and general
way, and it looks reasonably convincing if not
inspected too closely. But there is room for a
few questions:
In 1898 the N.S.W. postal department carried 32 papers
for every inhabitant. In Victoria, where id. postage is
charged, the number was 24 per inhabitant. As the
D.T. admits that “ the large bulk” of the alleged news-
papers carried free are really advertising-circulars which
wouldn’t be registered as newspapers in the other pro-
vince, there being nothing to gain by so doing, doesn’t it
appear that in the free-postage province there is really a
smaller diffusion of real newspapers than in the one where
there is no free postage?
Is it seriously alleged that the public gets better papers
in N.S.W., Tasmania and Westralia—the three free-
postage provinces—than in Victoria and Maoriland ? Is
the Telegraph larger or more gorgeous than the Age or
Argus? Does the Sydney Mail or Town and Country
Journal contain more art and information and thrill
than the Melbourne Leader (published at half the price)
or the Australasian ? How did the Daily Telegraph
Co.’s awful weekly, the Tribune, compare, while it lived,
with the Canterbury Times— which among weekly Aus-
tralasian newspapers probably stands at the very top ?
Have Tasmania 'and Westralia developed anything gor-
geous in newspaper literature because of free postage ?
Where are the “ enlarged journals and special work ” ?
Also, if the State should “ bear some of the cost ” of
supplying the community with facilities “for obtaining
the fullest possible information concerning the move-
ments of politics,” should it also pay for supplying them
with complete misinformation ? Considering that the
Telegraph and Star’s N.S.W. political information is
now diametrically opposite to that of the Herald and
News, one set must be misinformation —unless both are.
Should the State pay for corrupting the public mind with
the News’ observations about the Telegraph’s utter un-
reliability, for instance ?
There are a large number of other questions
that might be put, but the above will do to go
on with. Meanwhile, it is to be hoped that
the Lyne Government will adhere to its pur-
pose of imposing newspaper postage. It is all
very well for the Telegraph to say now that
newspapers in general should be carried free
because they disseminate valuable information.
Considering the kind of things that paper said
during the Federal campaign about the valuable
information disseminated by other papers, it is
plain that these other papers deserve no en-
couragement whatever. As for the Tele-
graph’s own .contents at that time, they
showed clearly that postage, as .far as it was
concerned, should be at least half-a-crown. In
fact, some days it should have been ss.

The Synagogue on the Situation.
We read that :
A prayer for Her Majesty’s forces in South Africa has
been appointed by the Chief Rabbi of the British Empire
to be read in Synagogues every Sabbath during ihe con-
tinuance of the war. It will be read in the Synagogue
here (in Sydney) to-day, and every succeeding Sabbath
during the continuance of the war.
Thus it commences :
O Lord God of Hosts ! Thou art our refuge and
strength, a very present help in trouble. We draw nigh
unto Thee this day to supplicate Thee on behalf of the
brave men, who pass through seas, armed for war in a
far-off land, in obedience to the command of our beloved
and venerated Queen and the bidding of her counsellors.
Whether the “ Lord God of Hosts” is of the
same family as that “God of Battles” whose
special province it is to attend to the “ Rule
Britannia ” department of the celestial adminis-
tration, The Bulletin has no means of know-
ing. We have heard of the God of Israel,
alternatively worshipped as the God of Truth,
who has been sanctified to men of all time, not
less by holy tradition than by that matchless
imagery of prophet, priest and singer which
has penetrated the ages as by blast of golden
trumpet. There would be some hesitation,
this paper imagines, on the part of Sydney’s
Rabbi Davis in approaching that particular
Deity in the language of unveracity on behalf
of Gertain troops who have assuredly not
“armed for war in a far-off land” in response
to any worthy mandate. The Australian mili-
taire —-the Rabbi cannot but know—has volun-
teered for the Transvaal largely because he gets
over three times the market price of human
war-material as “ made in Britain,” with pen-
sions, life-policies, interim provision for rela-
tives, and other luxuries thrown in. Again,
the British soldier has fairly enough to take
things as they come. Rightfully or wrongfully,
the surrender of his faculty of discrimination is
part of his bargain. Not so with our men, who
go forth, not by Queenly command, but as
volunteered killers—slaughtermen by choice.
Fatman, who controls the press and cables and
Legislature, says it is the right thing to do,
and they go. They know that governors,
bishops, judges, mayors, and fools generally
will be present to gush over them as the
steamer leaves the wharf, and they go. A like
set of functionaries with “ the band as before,”
they are equally aware, will be waiting them at
the other end, and they go. By all means,
Rabbi, pray to the “ Lord God of Hosts” for
those whose plain duty calls them to the front
of the battle, but do not degrade that holy
exercise by using it on behalf of a lot of callow
hoodlums who go forth to try and shoot better
men than themselves at the call of a mere mur-
derous lust.

Seddon’s Triumph.
Few things have happened in Australasian
politics more remarkable than the victory of
the Seddon Ministry at last week’s Maoriland
election. The present party has been in office
since 24th January, ’9l. Seddon has been
Premier since Ist May, ’93, when he rose from
being first lieutenant to the position of captain
on John Ballance’s death. The Seddon
Ministry came back in triumph from the
general election of ’93, and again from the
election of ’96, and seeing that it didn’t retain
office by disfranchising the people wholesale as
Forrest’s Ministry does in W.A., but appealed
to the fickle multitude on the widest possible
suffrage, the result was absolutely unprece-
dented. Towards the end of last Parliament
it looked as if the Seddon mana was waning.
Digger Dick’s brilliantly successful and
honestly democratic Ministry began to be
guilty of the hitherto unpardonable sin of old
age. A Ministry that haslastednine years carries
an enormous handicap. It has refused billets
to about nine times as many people as a one-
year Ministry would have done. The districts
that want hopelessly unpayable railways have
been kept waiting by it nine times as long as
by a mere one-year Government, and are nine
times as angry over it. There has been time to
build up nine times as many false accusations,
and for the Government to make nine times as
many mistakes, and for the country to get nine
times as tired, and for nine times as many acci-
dents to befall, as in the case of a Cabinet that
has only a record of 12 months. The mere dis-
integrating effect of Time is against the long-
lived Ministry ; nobody expects the building
that is 900 years old to present as solid a front
to the blast as the one of a single century. And
with all this handicap the Seddon Government
has swept the polls ; it has converted its
majority of six or seven into one of over 30 ;
and the old Tory party has gone down with so
unspeakable a fall that it is unlikely there will
ever again be a real Tory party of any size in
M. politics. Some day, probably, Sed-
don’s own party will break up, and
some new democrat will oust the old one on the
ground that, with advancing years, he has
ceased to move fast enough to keep pace with
the times. But the chance of any reversion to
the old Tory regime is gone for many years —
perhaps for ever. The story that Maoriland
was tired of progress, that it wanted rest, that
it wanted to get back to the old, safe, steady-

The Returned. N.S.W. Lancers.
“ Lillipilli ” to The Bulletin :
Dear Bulletin.— -Those who know most of Colonel Burns,
of the N.S.W. Lancers, must feel much sympathy with
him. He has been liberal and chivalrous : yet all his
plans have irone wrong. The whole secret of the present
unsavory mess is said by some of the Lancers themselves
to be his failure to sum up adequately the weakness of
one man. (One paper clinches all the telling arguments
against the returned Lancers with the accusation that
they allowed the British public to be deceived, and would
make it appear that the Lancers at Aldershot knew what
Captain Cox had told the War Office— viz., that all his de-
tachment wanted to fight the Boers.) The troopers did
not, as a matter of fact, know that any pledge had been
given to the War Office on their behalf. The critics in
N. must realise, too, that when the Lancers started
from London war had not been declared. In June they
did not know that there would be war. Their Captain
was a little previous and sanguine, merely. It was
known in Australia months ago that from 20 to 30 of the
Lancers had expressed a determination to return to
N.S.W. as soon as possible—would, in fact, have left
Aldershot in June had they been able ; aftd although
it was not deemed politic to publish the informa-
tion it was to hand in many newspaper offices.
When the Chronicle (London) published its facts, confir-
mation of those facts were sent to some of the N.S.W.
papers ; information had been sent from England weeks
before. The inspiration of the paragraphs in the
Chronicle giving the truth was perhaps the only way the
Lancers— as men with their hands tied by discipline—had
of contradicting the official fairy-tales being published
by their bosses. Even attempts were made to practically
force the Lancers to volunteer, to cover up a bad blunder
mfide by their superiors. They were taunted, but, know-
ing their own reasons, they took up the attitude—“ We
did not volunteer. We are not responsible for this mess,
and perhaps our best policy is to be quiet, on the status
quo.” The men were humbugged from the start, just as
tee end of the trip has been humbugged. For two
months after they arrived in England they were left often
under a N.S,W. junior commissioned officer, who had
only put a uniform on for the first time when they left
Sydney. Yet the Australian public thought they were
being trained with the British troops at the Autumn
manoeuvres. It was only when the press notices and
private letters had revealed these facts at the regimental
head-quarters In N.S.W. that Col. Burns expressed
his disappointment to Captain Cox, and the men got afew
weeks’ drill under the eye of others than their own
officers. For weeks before leaving Aldershot the men
were kept idling, discontented and non-plussed. There
had been some desultory talk of the possibility of seeing
service in the Transvaal, but there had been nothing
official or according to rule ; and each man had his own
ideas. Meanwhile, in official circles, everything was
being cut and dried in a very high and mighty and
irregular way. Then the thunder-clap came. There
was the leakage of news to the London press to the
effect that only some of the men would volunteer ; then
the official challenge. Then came the departure from
Aldershot with all the delirium of the London crowd ;
only a few hours had intervened. How could the Lancers
explain the situation to the British public? Why, the
Lord Mayor himself could scarcely get a word in edge-
ways. It simply is, that the men who have come home
sooner than volunteer and risk bungling betrayal, defeat,
disgrace, &c., at the front, under persons capable of
leading them into such discreditable predicaments, are
now being blamed for the whole mess which they, being
military men, were powerless to prevent. It would be
just as well for the public to learn the whole truth first-
hand from the returning troopers instead of shrieking at
them. The men have been deceived, so have the Im-
perial officers. One newspaper writer was assured
officially months ago that all but 6 or 7 men had volun-
teered, the while he had a letter in his pocket stating that
20 or 30 men had refrained. The men now come home
should be treated fairly, and judged by similar standards
to those adopted in respect of the Lancers now in
N.S. Wales. If N.S. Wales people only knew half
the truth ‘ about the volunteering of the Lancers
in N.S.W.. there would be less hysterical cou.
demnation of the victims of mismanagement lately in
quarantine. In the half-squadron immediately under
Col. Burns’ own eye, 2 per cent, volunteered —one man
out of a troop of about 50 ; of the men from Aldershot,
60 per cent, volunteered. We in N.S.W. may, if there is
any talk of the “ white feather,” have to explain to the
men on the Nineveh why our ratio is so small compared
to theirs.
Unprovoked Assault.
This, from a Melbourne Age leading article, is
a fine sample of the information which the
“ great ” dailies supply to Australia :
Here then we have an unprovoked war on the part of
the Orange Free State, without the least shadow of justi-
fication for it. Perhaps the advocates of the Boers will
palliate this wanton aggression on President Stetn’S
part by pleading the racial sympathies he must have had
with his cousins across the Vaal. But even so, race
sympathy that strikes at the heart of a friendly Power
by an open and unprovoked resort to arms is to the
threatened Power ample cause of war, unless all defence
and Empire are together to be abandoned.
Concerning the absence of any shadow of justi-
fication, the case for the Orange State is just
this: Britain recognised its independence.
Britain, by the same agreement, pledged itself
to conclude no treaties with the native tribes
north of the Orange River. When the Diamond
Fields were discovered, in Orange State terri-
tory, and far north of the Orange River, Britain
claimed them on behalf of a petty Kaffir chief,
Waterboer by name, with whom it had con-
tracted a treaty in defiance of the agreement.
It sent up a force which, in time of profound
peace, seized this patch of Orange State terri-
tory, allegedly on Watf/rboer’s account. It
took a small portion of Transvaal territory at
the same time to round - off the Dia-
mond Fields. Then it practically ad-
mitted that Waterboer was a mere dummy
by keeping the territory itself. And then it
reached the climax by admitting that Water-
boer had “only a defective title”—but it
didn’t hand back the property which was ad-
mittedly stolen or else taken by mistake. In-
stead it paid £90,000 compensation for a terri-
tory since proved to be worth, in diamonds
alone, over £70,000,000. The Orange Free
State has just the same grievance that Aus-
tralia would have if some outside Power, say
Germany, had annexed, in time of profound
peace, Bendigo, Ballarat, and the other Victorian
gold-fields, when their prosperity was just
beginning ; also Broken Hill, Gympie, Charters
Towers, the whole Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie
gold deposits, and the .Newcastle coal-fields.
Nothing more than that.

According to the Conservative and Im-
perialistic view—backed up by the public after
a riotous spree of cables, speeches, music and
beer—the rights of foreigners generally are
closely circumscribed in the land of their birth,
but practically illimitable when they are
dumped into another country. The foreigner
living peaceably in his own country has no
rights whatever. His business is to do what
the Englishman tells him, and to surrender the
wealth of his birthplace to the horde of greedy
money-changers to w'hom all mankind are but
as pawns in the game of grab—-or else to be shot
dow'n. But what a different person is the
foreigner in another land. Let him come to
Australia and the same Conservative Imperialist
overwhelms him with kindness. Any attempt
tomakehim stay athomeis met with a howlofin-
dignation anda demand for liberty of action, and
the Australian who objects to undesirable aliens
is told that he fears their virtues and not their
vices. He is told that said aliens are thrifty,
industrious citizens who never drink, or attend
races, or “ blew ” their earnings on totes. It would
be safe to wager that if any profit-making con-
cern proposed to import 1000 Boers to Sydney in
order to reduce wages the Boers would instantly
become invested with more virtues than a
mediaeval saint, and any attempt to block their
landing would be resisted tooth-and-nail by the
very people who are now faintin’ so loudly
over the slaughter of the Africanders in the
land they won for themselves by sheer pluck,
hard work and hard stealing.
Writes Brisbane Worker
The Bulletin that went shrieking mart over Federation
is now lamenting-its first result—the Jingo fever. All
along the Worker warned The Bulletin that Federation
was primed to the muzzle with Imperialism. And now
The Bulletin is in the predicament of the fellow who
didn’t know it was loaded. . . .
Inasmuch, however, as Australia made its first
departure of any consequence in the direction
of Imperialism many years ago when it sent
out the Soudan contingent, it appears that pro-
vincialism also is primed to the muzzle with
Imperialism, for Federation was far away at
that juncture. The Bulletin, while lament-
ing the fact that the first act of the Australias
after Federation has been practically born, is
to join in a most immoral war of aggression,
has to point out that the present contin-
gents have not been sent out by Federal
authority but by the local Parliaments. There
is no more strongly Imperialistic province in
the empire than Newfoundland, the colony
that refused to federate ; the colony also that
petitioned the British Government a short time
back to take it over and govern it, inasmuch as
it wasn’t fit to govern itself. And the city of
Brisbane, the most bitterly anti-Federal centre
in Australia, went howling-mad with Jingo
fury, the other day, just round the Worker
office.
Now that S.A. has got £IO,OOO in one lump-
gift for the building of a “School of Mines,”
and when there is serious inquiry in Melb. and
some inquiry in Sydney and Perth about tech-
nical education, the time is probably better
than any other to determine, what the real
object of this sort of education in Australia
shall be. Down to date, the technical colleges
—“schools of mines” mostly—have taught a
little about dressmaking and plumbing and
cooking and wallpapering and mac ram e work
and carpentering ; and shorthand has been, an
indispensable. Technical education has been
boomed in England, and the boom has been
echoed here, on the ground that European Con-
tinental countries were getting ahead of Britain
in the race for industrial supremacy, and that
this was because of the superior scientific
knowledge of the despised foreigner ; fur-
ther, this superior knowledge was credited
to the Continental school - system. Yet
instead of making the Australian schools iusti-

“ A House of Mystery,” the second effort
of the new firm of Aneelon and Weir at Sydney
Criterion, calls fora certain amount of respectful
admiration. There are no mental snakes in it;
the people who do things have a coherent reason
for doing them, the funny man with the long nose
only excepted, and he is obviously an irrespon-
sible being ; also, the villain doesn’t do frightful
butchery for l£d. or some equally insufficient
motive, as that character generally does. There
is a kind of friendly reasonableness about the
show which is unusual, and the story doesn t
murder probability in cold blood and drag its
remains nine times round the city afterwards. It
is a simple tale of a good man with two wives,
Long before the story opens he was beguiled by
circumstances to think the first wife unfaithful,
and he got a divorce, though the first wife was as
spotless as the unborn snowball. Then he marries
tlie second wife—a woman with a Past, who is
trying desp irately to conceal her Past and
reform. But one wet night a draggled
woman hangs on to the house fence and im-
plores shelter. It is the first wife, stone-broke,
ill and homeless, with the broken feather in her
hat beaten flat by rain, yet still solid on the ques-
tion of her innocence. Her ex-husband, being a
good sort of man, can’t throw her over the fence
again ; nor can he explain fully to his second wife
that it is his first wife he is bringing back into the
family ; nor can he shelter the wauderer in the
dog-kennel for the dog is there already ; and to
offer her an umbrella on the lawn would be useless
and inadequate. The second wife, too, insists on the
first wife being taken in, and she personally dries
her predecessor and puts her to bed. The person-
ally-dried predecessor tries not to interfere with
her benefactor s happiness, but things go wrong.
The husband s love revives. An interfering person
of good intentions learns her story, and helps her
so enthusiastically to find proof of her innocence
that it is presently demonstrated the divorce
was all a dreadful mistake. The Indian servant
woman, who has never forgotten her former
mistress, decides, in the gratitude of her loving
heart, to slowly poison the second wife so that the
old man can re marry the first wife, and a brown
hand with a bottle in it takes to stealing through
the bed-curtains and pouring things into the
second wife’s medicine. The first wife is suspected
of the crime and also of base ingratitude to the
woman who took her in and dried her that wet
night, and begins to wish she had never been
born. Finally the second wife suicides, and her
death is a solemn warning to all people with good
intentions.
There is one villain in the story, but he is
a small, tame villain and does no harm, though J.
H. Nunn makes reasonably good use of what
opportunities there are. The woe is really brought
about by the good people whose kindly intentions
burst and kill everybody for 40 yards around. The
great success of the p'ay is Miss Dunckley, whose
first wife is wholly admirable. The present writer
doesn’t remember having any previous acquaint-
ance with Miss D., who arrives suddenly (from
somewhere in Victoria, it is alleged) with a good
stage presence, a clear voice, and a valuable capa-
city for playing a slirieky part without shriekiness,
and being a stage saint who is really interesting.
Also she arrives with a most unfortunate stage-
name ; no woman, however pretty and talented,
can be a permanent success while she is called
Dunckley. It sounds like something partly
Scotch and pi'tly frivolous. Miss Hope
Mayne’s second wife is also a respectable
success, but their joint and several husband is
just plain dead failure. Diver fills a very large
part (he is on the stage about three-fourths of tlie
time) as the interfering friend with the good in-
tentions, and except for the painfully nervous
and hurried style of his elocution he would be
excellent all through. A kind of subsidiary story
about a man of 25 who is dressed in a boy’s collar
and a short jacket, and kept down by his terrible
Mia. and who afterwards becomes a man and takes
to drink, calls for loud contempt. It is a glaring
Steal from “ The Magistrate ” for one thing, and
the man with the boy’s collar is so wholly irrele-
vant that he only serves to confuse an otherwise
well-constructed drama.

That silent and solemnly-expectant week
which goes before Christmas is at hand, and
Her Majesty’s, as usual, will close for a week
in order to get the pantomime ready. Saturday
is the last night of “ Robin Hood,” and the green
outlaws and the greenwood tree. “Red Riding
ll.iod” is to be the Christmas show at William-
son's theatre, and that painted frivolity is being
got up regardless of cost. Next week, however,
vvtll be time enough to start cataloguing the
Christmas shows. The furnace breath of the
plum-pudding and the heated atmosphere of the
inverted fowl on the plate are still some little
distance away, and they won’t commence to
blight and brown the local herbage for a few days
yet.

“ Fnn on the Bristol,” now doing its
nianvtli revival at Sydney Lyceum, is so very like
the old “ Fun ” as far as the first act is concerned
that it requires no special mention here. As
regards the second act, it is so unlike the original
“tun” that that requires no special mention
either. As time goes on, the plot—what there is
°f it—gets further into the background and the
Widow O’Brien becomes more and more a variety
The variety part is always changing, and
the O’Brien comedy is sometimes a good comedy
and sometimes a very moderate one according to
circumstances. Just now it is a decidedly moder-
ate production, and it is best to pass a good deal
of it in regretful silence. It only lasts till next
Monday in any case, and after that the Lyceum
closes for a few nights while the Xmas attraction
is got ready.

Miss Maud McCarthy is starting on her
return journey to London so suddenly that she

She gives a farewell violin recital at Sydney Cen-

The Brough Comedy Co. is concluding a
prosperous season at Meib. Princess’s this week.
l’relavvney of the W ells ” waggled its crinolines
to large houses for six nights, and on Saturday
there was a revival of “Sowing the Wind,” with
Brough as Brabazon (a more aged Bi abazon than
Titheradge gave us of yore); Reg. Dartrey as an
excellent old \Vatkin, and Mrs. Brough and Miss
Noble in their original parts. The leading lady
has distinctly improved what was always a pretty
piece of work by dropping a little of the undue
emphasis from her elocution, and waiting to let
her best points come instead of rushing to meet
them half-way. Mario Majuroni is an imposing
but rather melodramatic Lord Petworth, and
Lovell, as Ned Annesley, is more than ever like a
young man who has escaped from the Church.
Meanwhile, “Sowing the Wind” is off the bill
again. On Wednesday, they were to revive “ The
Village Priest,” which will play the Brough
management to a finish, as far as this year is con-
cerned. The co. is booked for Maoriland ; also,
there is another Eastern tour to happen ere the
Broughs return to Melbourne.
** * *
On Saturday night next (16th) a “Great
Combination Matinee”—the first “matinee” show,
by tlie way, that was ever advertised as an evening
event—will be given at the Princess’s in aid of the
Theatrical Charities, and in honor of the dissolving
firm. The W. and M. lesseeship of the Princess’s
expires on Saturday, therefore J. C. Williamson,
head centre of theatrical charity matters, has
seized this opportunity for putting a big sum to
the credit of the Distressed Actors’ Fund. All
the reserved seats have been sold at prices
worthy of the occasion and the cause, but
it will be open for the ungilded masses to
get unreserved stalls for ss. and amphi-
theatre early-door tickets for 3s. on payment
of cash at the pigeon-holes. So The Bui,lei in
exhorts all arid sundry to poll early at the pigeon-
holes. Tlie programme is to be as long and strong
as the promotors can make it. J.C. W., around
whose personal play-acting reputation cobwebs
have been allowed to congregate, will play Kerry
in Boucicault’s one-act drama from the French.
The Brough Co. will make a farewell appearance
in one or two items; likewise Miss Henrietta
Watson will say good-bye to Australia in the
character of Glory Quayle ; whilst Thomas King-
ston meets a Melb. audience for the first time as
“ The Christian.’ Manager Rickards and some
of his eo. will supply turns, and the inevitable
crowd of representative citizens will represent
themselves in a smoke-night scene at the finish.
And then the Princess’s Theatre will put up its
shutters for the present, more’s the pity !

At Melb. Royal the rather triumphant
career of “The Power and the Glory” closes on
Friday, to permit of its earthly and heavenly
effects being shipped to Sydney before Xmas. Oil
Saturday a new drama called “Our Guardian
Angel’’(probably a near relation to the angel in
tlie current spectacle) will be mounted with vast
magnificence for a season of four nights only.
After the Angel comes Johnny Sheridan in
“ Little Christopher Columbus” on 23rd Decem-
ber, and seeing that L.C.C. will be Melbourne’s
nearest approach to a pantomine production it is
likely to get a real good time.

New South Wales’s expenditure up to 30th Nov ember was
£8,976,579, so the deficit is now £84,506. When the un-
speakable George Reid left ottiee a little over two months
ago, the shortage, so far as the yea! had gone, was
over £300,000, so Lyne has done a lot towards squaring
the accounts. In Victoria the revenue has. begun to go
up again after two months of deerease, but it is still
smaller than it was at this date last year. Tasmania’s
revenue has declined now for two mouths in succession.

Lyne certainly starts under very hard circumstances. lie
is pledged not to find additional revenue by means of
customs duties because that would “raise the fiscal
issue,” and the fiscal issue is to have a rest till the Com-
monwealth Government starts. lie hasn’t courage enough,
it would seem, to levy enough extra direct taxation to
make him feel sure he is solvent. He is pledged to increase
the road vote which was so shamefully starved by the
Reid Government that many of the highways of N.S.
Wales are getting hack to the state the.v were
in when Captain Cook landed. He is pledged also
to go hack to the policy of the Dibbs Govern-
ment by paying out of revenue many of the small
non-productive works and repairs and patches which the
unspeakable Reid charged to loans. When he took office
the deficit was already over £300,001) —in other words, Reid
had contrived, inside three months, to spend that amount
more than his revenue. And with nearly half the year
gone the best that the new Government can hope in the
way of new taxation is to raise £67,6u0 hy increased
stampduties. Still Lyne promises pretty well as a Treasurer.
If his first statement is any criterion his policy is to be
plain, straightforward and a trifle dreary, and after five
years of the flashy, foolish, cheap jack style of Reid any-
thing with the elements of common honesty in it will be
a pleasing change.
The new issue of Victorian Government stock
which is to be put on the local market in a few days is
another evidence of that strangely idiotic frame of the
Australian political mind which holds that the Australian
investor should alvvo •' v get less interest than the English
one. The Vic. Government proposes raising £590,0(10 at
.3 per cent, and it offers the stock for sale at £lOl. In
other words the local investor is only to pet the stock if
he accepts a irille le«< tliun 3 per cent, for his money a

collects income-tax on the interest, which reduces it prob-
ably by 4d. per cent, annually, whereas, when loalts are
floated in England, the British Governinetit gets the iii-
conie-tax on the interest. Making all allowances, it pays
about as well to sell u loan at .LOT ii> Australia as at .101
ih l.ondon, ahil meanwhile the Victorian Government de-
mands .t 101 in Austral.a for securities which, if sold in
London, Would probably not fetch more than )95 net.
Oh 17 N'ovendier 3 per cent. Victorian stocks were worth
only £97 in London. In Melbourne, they were as high as
A’li’iO lus. And, instead of the Turner Government being
darned thankful that the Victorian is Willing t'o lend it
jnonev so much cheaper than the Englishman would, it
demands that the VittOriah shall go a bit further and
give £Ol. And, if the loan doesn't sell at this exorbitant
figure, it will probably he decided that the local market
is played out., and the next loan will he offered in London
at t9B or £97. The idea that the local investor is an in-
ferior animal who should never expect the same rate of
interest as the lordly British capitalist appears to have
very deep root in this country.
The Executor, Trustee and Agency Co. of
South Australia, a concern which is now 19 years of age,
shows some belated s gns of prosperity. For the first 15
or 1(> years of its existence it was a lamentably stationary
affair, and though it has only paid nine dividends in 19
years, the first live of these were, to say the least, very
doubtful policy. The last two years have shown these
results:
Profit Dividend
1893 .. £l3lO .. .. 6 per cent. = £536
1899 .. 177 S .. ..5 „ = 539
From ISSO to the end of 1597 the Executor, Trustee and
Agency Co. of S.A. only managed to create a reserve of
£soa, and that, with £3OO accumulated profit, represented
its entire 17 years' progress. It. added £5OO to its reserve
in 139 s and ii adds another £5OO this year, so the fund is
now £l5OO. Also the balance earned forward is now
£779, therefore much better progress has been made in
the last two years than in all the previous 17. Things
would have been still further advanced, only the co, got
excited last year, and voted t3'JO to the directors and £B4
to the auditors out of profits. In addition to making
£1773 profit the co. this year wrote £2OO off its leasehold.
Altogether the sun of prosperity appears to have com-
menced to shine after much delay, and there are, seem-
ingly, excellent prospects ahead if the co. only u?es its
chances aright. The first essential is to build up a
reserve which will create confidence. A trustee co. which
isn't solid enough to inspire confidence is a bottomless
ship without sides or a deck.

This rather humble concern has progressed to the ex tent
of about £502 in the above seven years. It is now 12
years old, and has no reserve-fund, an accumulated profit
balance of £B4O being all the security it offers to cus-
tomers, apart from its capital (£1(1,000 paid up and
£40,000 uncalled) and its unblemished honesty. Which
isn't anything very large and violent in the way of pro-

The report of the Australasian Temperance and
General Mutual Life Assurance Society, Limited, is to
hand for Lite year ended 30t.h September, 1399. Taking
the Ordinary Life Department, in the first plaee, the
figures compare with those of some previous years as
follows -

The worst feature in the case is the steady and apparently
incurable increase of expenses. In 1892 expenses absorbed
23} per cent, of the total income. Then there was a
period of cheaper management; expenses were 21J4 per
cent, in 1393; 20} percent, in 1394 ; and 21} per cent, in
1895. After that a disastrous spell set in. In 1396
expenses were nearly 27} per cent. ; in 1897 they were
27} percent. ; in IVJS a shade over 27 percent. ; and in
1899 they have swelled up to the enormous rale of
over 34} per cent. From 1594 to 1899 premiums have
increased 17055 and expenses have increased £9338.
If this sort of tiling continues it is a matter of
interesting speculation where the Temperance and
General expects to go to. The best feature is that the
assets are apparently not over-estimated, and the rate of
interest keeps up remarkably well. The interest earned
this year, is over £4 1 j»s. per cent, per annum on the
average funds, which is much higher than the figures
shown hy most offices, and as the Temperance and Gen-
eral is one of the very ft-w Australasian societies which
base their calculations on the assumption that invest-
ments will yield £3 10s. per cent, all round, t here is a
very large'margin of safety. Cnluekily the enormous
outlay in expenses to a great extent nullifies this ad-
vantage—if it. doesn’t nullify it altogether. The balance-
sheet. hy the way, is, in many respects, a model of per-
spicacity, and it is a pity other institutions don’t follow it
more closely. It is, as far as the writer remembers, the

The concentrating plant at the South Tharsfs
Mine is doing remarkably good work. The concentrates
of different decrees of fineness were absolutely free from
gang-lie, and the tailings wonderfully clean. Careful
analysis shows that the mill at this short, period after
starting is not losing more than 25 per cent, although a.
loss of 33 per cent, was originally allowed for, and it is
now pretty certain that it is possible to reduce the present .
loss fully 50 per cent. This plant was manufactured by

John Moffatt. The latter was in great trouble owing to

The Temperance and General’s industrial de-
partment continues growing, so far as the size of its busi-
ness is concerned—and the funds keep diminishing. One
of the quaint features of industrial assurance is that it
often costs much more to get new business in any given
year than the new bushiest produces, so a society that
pushes tilings vigorously finds its funds for a few years
actually diminishing. If it pushed things very vigorously
indeed for, say, three years it would probably find itselt
with no funds at all, all its assets being swallowed up by
its excessive prosperity. Some recent figures of the T.
and U.’s industrial branch are :

The business has increased immensely, and probably in
another year or two, the funds will start growing again.
But-meanwhile the interesting facts remain that the funds
of the Temperance and General's Industrial Department
have.diminished in four years from £40,912 to cl/,4i2;
that for four years outgoings have exceeded income ; and
that in one year (1897) expenses alone exceeded income.
There are curious possibilities about, industrial life assur-
ance—the kind where a large robust man. in some cases
about Oft. high and weighing 16 stone, comes round to the
back door to collect the penny on Monday morning. And
it is a most, foolish and extravagant kind of assurance for
the people who supply the penny. Eightpence in every
Is. goes in expenses, so the man who pays Is. for assur-
ance under this plan gets only 4d. worth.

A considerable scheme in embryo is for the
construction of a street-tram way system at Broken Ilill.
A Meib. syndicate, including some big M.T. co. men,
seeks the co-operation of the local council in securing a
bill; and a co. with a capital of about- £290,909 is then
contemplated. There is strong faith locally in municipal
enterprises ; but as it doesn’t run to the extent of sinking
£200,000 or half that in local tramways, and as the syndi-
cate proposes to hand over the lines in 39 years, the
desired co-operation may be got. Where the co. is going
to get its profits from if anything like that capital is
necessary is not so clear.

B.H. Block 14 directors issue the most optimis-
tic report, for years. General-manager Groeinvay’s electro-
magnetic machine for zinc concentration has been adopted,
ami the directors “ look forward to the treatment of the
zinc product becoming in the course of a few momhsa
part of the co.'s regular operations.” As for tlie general-
manager himself, he says that experimental operations
“have enabled us to export, to Europe a considerable
quantity of a marketable product.” Also, “the results
obtained ” for these and other experiments have enabled
him “to propose the adoption of a scheme by means of
which the bulk of the lead and silver contained in the
zinc middlings can be eliminated and recovered, and the
zinc contents converted into a high-grade zinc product,
which will at all times command a ready sale in Europe.”
This is the most definite, and perhaps the most important,
announcement yet made by a B.H. co. respecting
zinc-recoverv. One thing must, however, lie noted : Mr.
Greenwav does not yet propose to deal with the great
bulk of the “ tailings,” but only with that comparatively
small body classed, as “middlings.” Moreover, there is
an absence of figures from the announcement; hut, then,
Block 14 people have a dread of figures—their ore or pro-
duct is always “ of high grade,” or “ the usual fair grade,”
or something equally inconclusive. There may be a
reason for reticence in this case, though. The directors
mention that “ Mr. Greenwav has covered the treatment
by patents, which our co. has the free right to use.”
Probably this means no more than that Mr. Greenwav has
made applications for patents. The Australian (German)
Metal Go., which has an electro-magnetic plant in opera-
tion on the Barrier, is said to lay claim to the entire
electro-magnetic method—in somewhat the same way as
the McArthur-Forrest Gold Recovery people lay claim to
the sole use of cyanide for gold extraction. However, the
Australian Metal Co. does not appear to have its vital
processes vet patented (an objection is said to come from
the B.H. Proprietary), so that the cyanide muddle is not
yet paralleled.
In the absence of figures the importance of
Block 14’s announcement as to more extended sulphide
treatment depends largely upon general manager Green-
way’s reputation. And his reputation is that of a
metallurgist well-trained in some of the best English
reduction works, with nearly 12 years’ experience among
Barrier ores on top of it ; but he is also debited (or
credited) with something that is almost a passion for new
plant. In proof of the latter it is pointed out that, since
Block 14’s concentrating plant was first established,
nearly £60,000 has been spent, on additions to works.
What the effect of these additions has been it is impos-
sible to say—in consequence of that dread of figures
from which the co. apparently suffers. What is certain,
though, is that Mr. Greenway pioneered sulphide concen-
tration (it was the South Co. that put up the first mill on
his advice), and that he stuck to that process at a time
when the general disposition was to reject it on account
of its imperfections. Greenwav admitted its imperfec-
tions, but declared it the best that offered, and relied
upon practical experience to produce improvements. He
was right ; and the constant additions and modifications
are the result. Shareholders may wince sometimes at the
cost; nevertheless the cost comes out of sulphides which
before he set to work on them were valueless—and they
are getting a steady div. of £lO,OOO a half-year into the
bargain. Block 14 has the first-class record of not having
had a fatal mine-accident during the past sixyears. And
in that time it has paid t 450,000 in wages.
* * * *
B.H. Block 10 directors washed down their
half-vearly reports with wine—the first time such a thing
has happened since t he “ sulphide problem ” began to
keep .managers awake o’ nights. Capt. Warren, the
veteran who has successfully led the mine through all its
troubles, takes a holiday trip to Europe and ’Murka—to
see. by the way, what they’re doing with zinc there. And
concerning this question of making some profit out of
the zinc, a M irkan magazine-writer estimates this year’s
production of the Missouri-Kansas (.Inplin) zinc district at
15,009,1 lOOdol., as against 3.667,495d01. in '96. No wonder
the spelter-market has steadied ! But. the zinc is the main
product there ; at B. Hill it is a by-product.
The Broken Hill co.’s are having their innings.
When they began to treat the sulphides lead was worth
from £9 to £lO per ton ; in the first half of this year it
was wor.h on the average £l4 2s. ; for several weeks
lately the price has stood at over £l7 10s. The B.H.
Prop, puts out 75(1 tons of lead a week, the Central (Sul-
phide Corporation) from 45n to 050 tons ; Block 10, 340
tons ; the British, 290 tons ; and others less. Even
allowing that the co.’s don't get all the benefit of the
rise, this means more than a trifle. Speculators, how-
ever, who reckon that the balance-sheets for the current
term will show all this much extra profit will most likely
get a big disappointment. Some' eo.’s whose ore is pretty
uniform, and especially those which do their own smelt-
ing, are no doubt in clover; but others with enormous
quantities of low-grade ore, hitherto hardly pay-
able, are now putting through some of this material.
Of all the co’s. the Central (Sulphide Corporation) seems
to be raking in most profit ; it is doubtful whether it has
not been making more than even the B.H. Prop, lately.
Its wideawake management is working the plant at high
pressure to get the advantage of the strong metal mar-
ket. From a mill production of 704 tons of concentrates
in one week there was a jump to 10(11 tons in the next ;
and this contains from 60 to 05 percent- lead. On current
quotations a profit of £lOOO has been reached. What has
sent the lead market bounding up like this the experts
answer in 70 odd ways. One genius puts it down to the
“bombardment” of Ladysmith. The present genius
hazards a couple of shots—lead has moved up in sympa-
thy with copper and tin ; and the high values ruling for
copper, tin, and zinc have turned attention for a while
from silver-lead and lead mining. The chances spent to
be that it will keep up, but not all the way up. There is
bound to be a reaction, but it does not promise to be very
severe.
The B.H. Central, which makes these big
profits, does not trouble to bring the zinc contents of the
concentrates below 11 per cent. Others, which sell their
concentrates to custom buyers, exlract down to 6 per
cent. The Junction North outturn shows 6 per cent,
zinc, the Junction’s 6.2 per cent., Block Id’s 6.9 per cent.
Now, in order to make so fine an extraction as this, a
much greater quantity of ore has to be put through in
order to get a ton of .concentrates. The Central gets a
ton of concentrates from 41 tons ore ; it takes tons at
the Junction North, 71 at the Junction, and nearly
6 at Block 10. In order to eliminate this 4 or
5 per cent, of zinc (the difference between the
Junction's 6 per cent, and the Central’s 11 per cent.) a
very great quantity of silver and lead have to he sent off
into the tailings heap and the slime dumps. If the Cen-
tral finds it most profitable f o work on a 10 or 11 per cent,
zinc basis, it would also pay the others—if they had
reduction works such as those at Cockle Creek. This
suggests the advisableness of three or four of these cos.
co-operating in the erection of works—say the Junction,
Junction North, and North, with the British, perhaps.
At present it seems pretty.certain that a quite unneces-
sarily large quantity of silverand lead, amounting in value
to tens of thousands every half year, is going into the
dumps in order to meet ore buyers’ demands for a concen-
trate freer from zinc than thecos. with their own furnaces
find necessary.
• * * «
Tn a House of 55 only three members of N.S. W.
Assembly voted against the second reading of the Cold
Dredging Bill—two because they are frankly unwilling to
assist any new form of private industry in mining, and the
third, the M.B. for Murrumbidgee, because dredging
might kill the cod in the Western rivers. The Bill
is ex-Minister Cook’s, trimmed by G. 11. Reid, and
taken over by the present Minister, J. L. Began ; so
there was no room for party haggling, and G. 11. Reid
went home to lied. Its principal features are—maxi-
mum area, 100 acres ; rent for Crown lands, £1 per
acre per annum (the Minister may reduce this) ; warden
to fix the compensation for damage to owners of affected
lands ; warden to also determine the rent of private
lands (no appeal from the warden) ; term, 15 years ; and
power is conveyed to the warden to grant further com-
pensation in respect of damage sustained by neighboring
lands or holders lower down the stream. With the ex-
perience of Maoriland, Vic., and other provinces to go on
it was comparatively easy to avoid snags. A few, how-
ever, are bumped against. There is a plea for power to
amalgamate leases—that is, to concentrate operations on
one lease of several held in the same interest. Somethingis
to be gained by using the largest dredges; hut as a 100-acre
lease may take up, say, three miles of river, amalgamation
might lock up a great stretch. The argument is not
strong ; but the balance is against amalgamation. As to
tenure : The Bulletin has often said that short mining
leases are a mistake. It takes years to open up a mine,
and if the term is short the inducement is to pick out the
eyes of the show. But a dredge can work out about 8
acres a year ; so that a lease of 15 years where the maxi-
mum area is 100 acres would seem a fair thing. Anyhow,
dredging is experimental, and 15 years-is long enough for
an experiment to last. If it is asucoess, then the Minister
may renew on the same terms.
The rent under a dredging lease is to be £l,
unless the Minister reduces it. Vic. charges 2s. 6d. t
M loriland 7s. 6d. after the first year. S. Aus. on its N.
Territory leases charges £1 and a per centage. The fee
simple of much dredging land is not worth more than £1
per acre ; but, then, the Crown does not part with the
gold when it parts with the fee simple. Also, taking into
account the form of the leases (perhaps 100yds. wide by a
couple of miles long) the rent is riot outrageous. As to
private lands (one lease may cover both) the Warden
is to fix the rent; under the mining on P. P.
Act the rent is fixed at £1 per acre. Little of it
is worth that much ; but the Legislative Council will
lay hold of the existing provision in order to lever a
similar one into the new Bill. A fixed rent for all sorts
of land is nonsense, though. The State doesn’t take the
£1 for Crown land so much by wav of rent as by way of
royalty. There is another man who has rights, too—the
fossicker along the rivers; there are hundreds of him.
He must not he turned off. There is no earthly reason
whv he should not go on fossicking under his miner’s
right, using the water so long as he does not dredge ; and
an £BOOO dredge is mostly a few notes beyond him. Fear
of the “ dual title,” the Westralian bogey, is moonshine ;
the Crown has been granting dual titles for years.
If the Minister brought down all the wardens
of the province to Sydney, and a select committee put
them through their facings, the provision giving the
warden the last say as to compensation and other things
would be dropped. The province has some first-rate war-
dens ; it has others-who are also police-magistrates, and
coroners, and Clerks of Petty Sessions, and Registrars of
Dogs and Marriages, and several other things—fair proof
that they are not mining-law specialists. And if they
were all much better than they are there should still he
an appeal, just as there is appeal from the Land Boards
(where the chairmen are assisted by local members)
to the Land Court and thence to the Supreme Court—
as to moo- things, anyway. In the Minister necessarily
great power is vested, and rightly, for the Minister is
responsible to Parliament and may he sicked on 30
minutes’ notice or less. It is stated that -300 claims have
so far been applied for. It is pretty safe to Say a good
many ought not to be granted. It is good to get 1 he gold
out, hut the price may he too high—the public interest
may suffer too much. A township’s water-supply may
be turned into pea-soup by a dredge or two; in which
case, unless the leases promise to he unusually rich and
the township can get water conveniently elsewhere, the
lease or two should remain ungranted. In fact, it is a
question whether the Minister ought not to have the
power to swallow himself or a predecessor and cancel a
lease in certain cases when unexpected damage is being
done, upon payment of compensation to the amount,
say, of the value of the plant; though if anything of that
kind were done the lessee would have to be safeguarded
in some way.

Much excitement at Qneanhcyan, N.S.W.,
owing to the discovery of “ an outcrop 40ft. wide of mag-
nificent green copper carbonates and red oxide,” and
already the locals are talking in hundreds-of-thousands.
Such N.S.W. gold-mines as cyanide their tail-
ings are presumably putting aside the amount of the
royalty demanded by the patentees, M'Arthur, Forrest
and Co., pending a decision as to the status of the patent
in the province. By the way, the 13 members of N.S.W.
cyanide-patent opposition committee have each had to
stump-up t'4U to liquidate costs incurred in battling on
behalf of the local cyanide-users, and, so far, despite
many pointed reminders, the latter do not appear to be
falling over each other in their hurry to contribute their
fair share of expenses.

“ Korero ”: The fragrant old Shellback mine is
now, we believe, known as “ The Ivy.” It is still more or
less under the same admirable administration and is

Blayney, N.S.W., reports a ghost in the local
copper-mine. “Some consternation has been caused
amongst some of the miners by visitations in one of the
shafts. They bear strange noises, bells ringing, sighs,
groans, etc., and men going below have their candles ex-
tinguished by the supernatural visitor. Six hands have
left the mine owing to the terror the ghost has inspired.”
Good old Marsden, the former owner of the mine, was
buried in the lode at his own request, and it is one of the
conditions in taking over the freehold of this property
that workings shall not be extended within a certain dis-
tance of his tomb. Of course the mine-hands know all
about the grave in the lode ; if they didn't, there’d be
no ghost. But some people are never satisfied. Hun-
dreds of miners have left mines because the ghost didn’t
walk.

Subject to the payment of £ 1000 deposit, 10 per
cent, brokerage, examination, and the usual other condi-
tions, Girilambone mine has heen sold to an English co.
for £6.i,n00 cash and a fourth-share interest. The faith
shareholders have in the consummation of this scheme is
indicated by the fact that shares can be bought for less
than one-half of the money its completion would realise.

Mt. Drysrlale (N.S.W.) : Ten tons of ore sent
to Dapto averaged nearly sozs. per ton. The second and
third consignments are said to have averaged about 2jozs.
Then we are told that, altogether, 100 .tons have heen
sent to Dapto, that the lode showed gold to the full width
of 3ft.., and a sample taken from a 6-ineh vein in the
centre assayed 4fi7ozs. gold and 3720z5. silver to the ton.
A remarkable difference between mine assays and smelt-
ing results. Some years avo the Drysdale crowd spent
over CIO,OHO in treating less than UK id tons of rock sent
to Wallaroo and elsewhere when half the amount would
have provided a plant for its treatment for all time on the
mine, and the moment they have found another pipe of
rich ore. or whatever it is, the same unwarrantable proce-
dure is renewed. Certainly there is little or no profit in
sending “about” 2Aoz. stone from Drysdale to Dapto ;
whereas if it were treated on the mine perhaps half of it
would be profit.. As things stand, the gold mostly goes
to pay road-haulage, railway-freights, sampling and
smelling charges, with the usual deductions.

Cobar Gold Mines, N.S.W. : While it is im-
possible to obtain, officially or otherwise, any detail as to
the result, from the running of this (mainly-English-
owned) mine during the last three months, it is generally
accepted that the concern is not doing too badly. Mining
manager Fox. who has been there alone for the last two
years, is known to he bringing his family from Bendigo.
That is not a !>ad sign ; moreover, a 100-head stamp mill
with a cyanide plant of equal capacity and all the neces-
sary appurtenances of so great a concern isn’t kept run-
ning unless a profit is shown. Time, however, that the
Australian shareholders who, to a man, have faced the
music of calls in this affair, should receive a little more
information from the management.

North Nymagee, N.S.W., still moves in a
mysterious way. As the Sabbath tipster has dropped
booming it, the alleged mine may now have some chance,
although the manager’s reports are mournful reading.
“ Lode 6ft. wide, composed of zinc blende and yellow and
black ore through it. From present indications, believe
a bunch of ore not far distant.”

Myalls United, N.S.W. : Crushing-returns are
reported from London : the latest, 2600 tons for 2540 z. ;
2500 tons cyan id ed for 3770 z. Mining and milling won-
derfully cheap, but the thing is too low-grade to pay.
The loss on this run was estimated at £875, and a decrease
in ore-reserves is admitted.

Westralian Mt. Morgan, 040 tons 0850 z., cya-

Various things are being said about Lake View
Consols. Manager Callahan seems to have heen hut a
few days in London when he was sent hack to the mine
post-haste by way of America—where he managed to miss
the’Frisco boat. Last week manager Hewitson, of the
Ivanhoe, became acting-manager, vice the absent man-
ager's brother ; he “ is making an exhaustive inspection
of the property, is going to test the mine at all the levels
from end to end, and to report on the machinery and
plant; therefore some time must elapse before the result
can lie cabled to the directors.” Another yarn is that a
cable has come from some unknown source to some un-
known person that the Dec. yield will he 10,OOOoz. instead
of 30,0n00z. as usual. Another “persistent rumor”
says the return will be 15,0000 z., while the London
pipers of just over a month ago are wonderfully
unanimous in declaring that the 30,0000 z. output will not
only he maintained for six months at least, lint it would
be quite easy to run out 60,0t)0oz. for one month, if the
management were so inclined. When a slump of £2 or
* 3 a share occurred some weeks ago, Whittaker Wright
said that it was all on account of the " I'ears,” who would
have a bad time when the manager reached London. A
number of financial rags, noted for their greasing of this
co., declared that the “bears” were led by Kaufmann,
who had taken a great set against the L.V.C. because of
his quarrel with Wright and others. What they are say-
ing now the shares have fallen another £5 each Heaven
only knows.
* * * m
Bayloy’s United, "Westralia, is now running a
new 20-head stamp mill, admitted by good judges to he
the best in the country if not the most complete of its
kind in Australia. Capacity, 4 tons per stamp per day
and running in communication with it are cyanide anil
slime plants. Estimated that the 3500 tons of accumulated
slimes can lie worked at a profit of £lO,OOO. Over lo.tioo
ozs. of gold already won by the new reduction works.
Manager in last report estimated ore-reserves at 38,000
tons, which quantity has since heen considerably increased
by development work. It would lie interesting to know
how the gold occurs in this mine—in patches here and
there, or evenly distributed throughout the body. If the
former, the chances are it will be a short-lived mine.
As «oor> as ever Associateds. began to fall lately
with a dull, sickening, daily thud, the semi-otticiaj
announcement was made on the field that the new sul-
phide process was all right. The extreme eagerness to
say so suggests where the screw is probably loose.

The regulations under the new Dredging Act
in S. Australia have been gazetted, and may give a line
to the coming N.S.W. ditto. Applicant pays a year’s rent
when lie lodges his application. There is no private land
to speak of up in the N. Territory, to which the Act
applies. Then the warden reports. If the land or any
of if is rich enough for ordinary working, alluvial dr
reefing, the warden’s report is equivalent to a recom-
mendation to refuse the dredging lease. On three months’
notice, and with the Minister’s consent, the lessee may
surrender whole or part, of the lease, if rent or royalty
is not paid up (Govt, takes 10 per cent.), or if the covenant
as to labor (the lessee may keep fullv-manned £3OOO worth
of machinery in the alternative), the Minister may cancel
the lease without notice; for any other breach, non-
compliance after a nionth’s notice, may be followed by
forfeiture.

Chillagoes, which have been down to 25b., are
now at 28s. or so. A few weeks ago they were 455., then
they fell to 355., and, on account of it came an official
explanation that everything was all right at the mines,
that there was no reason whatever for the fall; and now
that a greater one than ever has taken place the same old
explanation is revived. But the market’s steady talk
shows that, good as these mines may eventually prove
themselves, a lot of people “ hae doots ” about Chillagoea
“going at £5.”

has been driven N. and S. on the footwail side for
110,'t.. in good ore all the way. From the tunnel floor
the No. 1 winze is down . 24ft in grey oxide and car-
bonates. A main shaft is being started to hit the lode at
200 ft. The garnet rock is carrying the lodes down, and
I hereby affirm that the permanence of Mt. Garnet and
Chillagoe is assured. Garnet rock is an igneous rock and
will go down to the ribs of the world. On the P. P.A. the
garnet rock carrying rich copper ore has been followed in
a drive east from the north crosscut 45ft., and on lease 35
a mile away from the P.P.A. —the easterly drive from
the crosscut at 100 ft. shows garnet rock also carrying
rich carbonates. Eleven years ago the ‘ expert ’of the
Barrier hauled ‘micaceous schist’ by the hair into every
report, and prospectus. Twelve monlhs or «o hence every
N.Q. wild-cat prospectus will have ‘ garnetiferous forma-
tion ’ and ‘ igneous rock ’in big type on every page. And
Chillagoes wilt lie £2O a share then (if somebody muzzles
the railway greed of the hoard), and Garnets will be £lO,
anyway.’’ ■ ;■

Judging by the daily repetition of ancient

if the Sydney dailies broke out like this :

After many weeks of hard battling, over
and underground, theN.S.W. “ Patriotic ” Fund
amounts to, say, £6ooo—which, safely invested
at 4 per cent., would just about keep three dis-
abled soldiers out of the workhouse for nine
months in the year, provided the fund was ad-
ministered by a Scotch committee. The J. 0.
Williamson matinee, after all the newspaper puff,
and the solemn auctioning of the best seats, and
the published assurances of the furious enthusiasm
of the local American colony, yielded—£l77 !
“Money talks.” And as an index of enthusiasm
or the other thing, Money’s talk is the only
speech worth listening to.

The result of Saturday’s “ Patriotic ”
Pund collection in Sydney city was most deplor-
able from the promoters’ standpoint. One hun-
dred and fifty elegantly-arrayed ladies, mainly
drawn from the ranks of the Naicest, stood in the
streets, most of them from morn till night, dis-
playing the British national colors and waving
collection-boxes, and the net result was a pound
or two over £2OO. During the day some high and
mighty dames were so annoyed at the poor re-
sponse that they abandoned the task in disgust,
saying the day was too hot. But it wasn’t the
heat—it was the frost that disconcerted them.

Be the fuss made about the returned
N.S.W. Lancers and the insolent announcement
as to the holding of an official enquiry to
ascertain, among other things, wny certain of the
men did not volunteer for the Transvaal war (this
in face of the fact that they were under no legal
obligation to do so, they having been enrolled, as
per Volunteer Act, purely for the defence of
N.S.W.). It is interesting to learn that the son
(now at Aldershot) of a highly-placed N.S.W.
volunteer cavalry officer and Govt, official, having
written asking his father whether he might volun-
teer for active service, got the cabled answer
“No.” Of course the father, one of the orna-
ments of Sydney society, was clearly within his
rights in denying to his son the permission
asked for. But as the military clique is harry-
ing the rank-and-file of the returned Lancers,
the question naturally arises—what are they going
to do with that officer ?

The Australian Jingo press is lamentably
weak in its history. Lismore (N.S.W.) Chroni-
cle says, apropos of the Transvaal war, that
“troops with such memories as those of the
Redan and the Mai ak off would storm any posit ion
that could be reached without wings.” Excellent
sentiment, but, as it happens, the French took
the Malakoff, and the British were beaten back
from the Redan.

The anti-Boer fever rages in Vandemonia.
The free press of the Island teems with Jingo
letters, and verses. Broken-down legislators and
municipal councillors are everywhere wishing they
were young again and off to the Big Murder.
Teachers have been instructed to bang into the
children’s heads a proper detestation of the Boers
and vvorship of “the Elag ”; pigeon-posts are
organised to bring the cable-liar to back-bush
thresholds in record time ; and it would be hard
to find an open Boer sympathiser in a walk of 50
miles. One Christian did write to a Launceston
daily condemning the sending of a contingent, and
was promptly told that his screed was “ not tem-
perate enough,’’and refused publication. Hobart
Mercury had a fit when Salisbury’s alleged dis-
claimer of any intention to grab the Boer terri-
tory came through, and its weekly, the Tas-
manian Mail, solicits public attention to its
pictorial delineation of the “Battle of Glencoe,”
drawn by “ our special artist in Hobart. The
figures are mostly wooden heroes armed with
brooms, and the fog is so dense you can’t dis-
tinguish the scenery, except a piece of rock evi-
dently hired, at the theatre., against which the
wooden warriors are dying with grins of derision
on their faces.

Australian papers last week printed an
elaborate cable to the effect that Earl De La
Warr (Hooley’s friend), “son-in-law of Lord

of war are brought home to us.

A man cannot be too careful of the com-
pany he keeps when “on a bender.” This is the
story of Blank, a gentleman conspicuous in Mel-
bourne finance. He started his evening with the
best intentions, but collected drinks and
acquaintances as he went, and eventually,
hours after midnight, he was a sodden
paralytic in the care of seven raging dipso-
maniacs who charged through his suburb,
carrying, supporting, or towing their
friend as the mood took them, and ringing
up reputable citizens all over the place,
seeking the home of the drugged celebrity
whom they had solemnly sworn to deliver
scathless into his young wife’s arms.
Eventually they found Blank’s house,
where a trembling servant answered to the
battery on the hall door, and offered to
take the comatose housefather in charge.
But Blank’s pals would have none of it—
they hoisted their dear brother shoulder-
high, and lurched up stairs and all over
the house, seeking his bedroom ; found it,
and streamed in. Then they dumped
Blank down on the snowy bed beside his
screaming bride, undressed him, and
marched out and away, like Christians
who had done their duty by a fallen
man and brother.

“ It is, of course, quite possible, in poetry as in musio,

If I were a rill
Prom a distant hill,
I would rush with my rippling; wave
Till the feet of the fairest and dearest one I’d
daintily lap and lave,
Till the lips of the loveliest I’d kiss and cool
with the lap of my laughing wave.
If I were a bird
Would soon be heard
The silvery sound of a silvery song ;
And ev’ry note
That left my throat
Would throb and thrill with her darling name, would
waft and lift along
The only theme of a mortal’s dream that soars in an
angel’s song!

S.A. police enquiry has culminated in the
suspension of five detectives. The offences
alleged are undue familiarity with the band of
confidence-tricksters who have for years past been
fattening on “mugs.” One of the “push ” who
had been gaoled claimed that certain “D.’s”
were in with a select band of spielers who never
seemed lo get arrested. The police point out that

as one of the reasons why
the Briton must conquer
him, but only about as
much as there is in the

tion about the Englishman

are dirty Boers and cleanly,
and an Uitlander of my

them just about the average
British affection for suds

high in either case. This
idea is consonant with the

she was shoved off the
Woman’s Rights question by
the warning that if she behaved
like a man she would be treated
like a man. But, since then, the woman-world
in general has discovered that this is just exactly
what it wants. When men treat women as well
as they treat each other, the Millenium may be
looked for in short order.

Perhaps the worst point of the new
George-street (Sydney) electric-tramcars is the
loftiness of the ascent-steps. However, there is
one consolation: every woman fancies that she
has good legs.
Some time ago Queensland Education
Department ukased that the “ Merchant of
Venice” should be used as a text-book in the
senior classes in State schools. A certain teacher
in a country district was so enamored at the new
classic that, not content with regular school study
of the work, he determined to have it produced on
the stage at a local entertainment, his pupils
taking the various characters. The affair was a
huge dramatic success—in the eyes of the local
parents who gazed admiringly on little Mary
doing Portia and Billy posing as Bassanio. A
week or two afterwards the Inspector came
along and requested the youngsters, as an
exercise in composition, to write an essay on
some character in the play they had been
studying. Naturally every kiddy wrote
about the character he or she had been-
representing on the stage. The Inspector ran
steadily through the various essays; learnt
a multitude of curious facts concerning
Antonio, Salarino, and other Venetian nota-
bles, but found to his surprise that
never a youngster had written a word
concerning the immortal Jew himself.
On enquiring the reason for this omis-
sion, he was promptly informed by a
bright-eyed youngster, “ Please sir,
Shyloek’s mother’s got a baby—so he
won’t be cornin’ to school for another
fortnight! ”
There are some Spartan parents in
Australia. T’other day in a Q. coast
town a man was seen leading his boy to
school by a dog-chain fastened round the
youngster’s neck. On the boy’s back was a
placard labelled “ Wagging! ” The old man’s
method of curing truancy.

A correspondent of a Sydney daily, in ex-
pressing surprise at the frequency of bayonet
work in the present South African war, asserts
that “according to a great English authority”
(unnamed) bayonet-charges were unknown in the
1870 Franco-German war. Said authority must
have ignored the fierce bayonet-fighting in St.
Privat cemetery (battle of Mars la Tour). As
for the current hostilities, the operations, for so
far, have consisted chiefly in British attacks upon
Boer entrenched positions—in which cases, when
one side succeeds in storming and the defenders
will stand to it, things must come to the bayonet.

The infantry “ charge,” in any case, is almost a

proved, can be pressed home in spite of the mur-
derous execution of the modern magazine-ntle.

“ W.” gives his view of it :
We hear a great deal against the Boer, but at all events
he has supplied many Britishers with a better country to
live in than any under British rule. I have a friend in
Johannesburg who went away from this death-hole a tew
years ago, and who has been earning 16, £7, ana even
£lO a week as a sign-writer. He has been quite satisfied
with the franchise, and his wish and the wish of many
other residents there has been that the British would
leave them alone. He returned here after the Jamieson
raid and purchased for his poor old mother a cottage tor
£650 that she might spend her last days in a little com-
fort. He then went back to Boerland and his paint-pot.
No doubt it will soon be knocked over now by the British
liberators, and lie will get the franchise, and find hnnselt
able to earn about 355. a week, as is the case in other
British colonies.

Another side-light oh alleged Boer bru-
tality is to be found in General White’s official
report to the War Office :
The enemy treated our wounded with great humanity.
General Joubert at once dispatched a letter to me offer-
ing safe conduct to doctors and ambulance to remove
wounded. Medical officer and parties to render first aid
to wounded were dispatched to scene of action from
Ladysmith last night, and ambulance at dawn this
morning.
While the following is the substance of a telegram
from Durban to the London Chronicle :
It is officially announced that Major Donegan, Principal
Medical Officer at Glencoe, has telegraphed to the State
Secretary at Pretoria, conveying his thanks on behalf of
all the British officers and men in hospital at Glencoe for
the extreme kindness shown by both Boer officers and
men.
It is a notable fact that'the men who are actually
fighting speak of their opponents with the great-
est respect. It is the particular variety of Jingo
who howls for war but keeps far away from
the scene of danger himself who rages about the
“ cruelty ” and “ cowardice ” of the enemy that
he wants someone else to go and kill for him. It
is the old story : “ there is nothing so terrible as
the rage of a sheep.”

The same old business of lifting heavy
loads with light chains killed a man at Mort’s
Dock the other day. Verdict—accidental death.
People get a chain with a theoretical breaking-
limit of six tons for an even load and a regular
strain, and a working capacity of a ton-and-a-
half say, and put a two or three ton load on it—
giving it a foot or so of play. The thing snaps one
day, and then “ why didn’t the fool stand from
under 2”
By a strange anomaly, pious Adelaide,
bossed as it is almost entirely by the W.C.T.U.,
&c. has a brewer-publican for its chief citizen.
Australia laughed wildly when it was
printed that, in Germany, newspapers keep a
specialist, or bogus editor, on the premises,
whose business it is to go to gaol whenever
an editorial slip is made, entailing imprison-
ment. Yet all Australian papers have
their gaoling editors, and when Packer
and Ebsworth, of Age and Argus
respectively, appeared at the bar of Vic.
Assembly, in place of Syme and M‘Kin-
non, the frantic absurdity of the situa-
tion did not strike home, although it
was known to everybody that the
publishers were mere scapegoats. The
Assembly might as reasonably have
punished Syme’s office-oat for King
David’s offence as mild Mr. Packer,
whose influence in the editorial depart-
ment is not powerful enough to invert
a comma. If David Syme can hire a
man to bear his punishment when he
is guilty of contempt of Parliament,
why may not another man who is
guilty of contempt of Court appoint a
deputy to take his gruel ?
Bishop Sam. Ballarat harps on the
problem. “ The tremendous inequalities in
the distribution of wealth are no longer endur*
able,” says he.
The big new Norfolk (Tas.) lunatic asylum,
thanks to the province’s squalid economy, seems
to be in a sorry plight. The new Chief Secre-
tary says that, on taking office,
He found that there was not a spare pair of boots in
the institution for any man, woman, or child ; that there
was a scarcity of other olothing and appliances, and the
officials were in a state of desperation. Many patients
had but one suit of clothes, and were driven, through
want of a change, to even sleep in them, even after
working and sweating in them, and being out in wet
weather. There were male patients who had to go to
bed whilst their clothes were being washed, and put into
straight-jackets. All the washing was forced to be done
under a lean-to of iron roofing in the hot sun ; there were
two inadequate boilers, and 400 people there. The drain-
age from the washing was very bad, and dangerous to
health. The appliances were next to useless. Some of
the criminal lunatics are mixed up with the civil lunatics,
some of the former being dangerous, and the whole place
disorganised. There are 36 or 39 female lunatics sepa-
rated only by a wooden fence from the yard of the most
dangerous criminal lunatics.

ROLAND AND OLIVER.
“Garni Yer mother takes m washing.”
“ Well, she would be a fool to leave it out when
your old man’s out of gaol.”
A man who joined the S.A. postal service
in ’57 had an unmarried son and a servant girl;
and when the infant came along and died—some-
how (as to that there is no proof), he helped the
boy to surreptitiously plant it. The sentence of
three months was probably justified ; anyhow, it
can pass. But the thing that can’t pass is that
because of this sentence the public servant loses
the whole of his “compensation,” or pension, as
well as his billet; and this despite the fact that
the money has been due any time since ’Bl. The
horse-sense of the situation seems to be that for
40 odd years the man has been suffering a deduc-
tion from his screw to provide for his old age,
when he should be too weak or too stupid to work;
and when he does become stupid enough to com-
mit an offence, this stupid old man, instead of
being given his money and fired out, is fined the
whole amount and then fired out. He has been
providing for old age ; but the official idea seems
to be that he has been backing himself to live and
die an angel. Something might be said for taking
enough of the “compensation” to cover pecula-
tions when they are discovered ; but in a case like
this, where the offence doesn’t directly affect the
man’s postmastering qualities at all, to collar the
whole amount is simply a cold, cruel steal.

The comedy of heroism. During the pro-
gress of one of Melbourne’s big fires of the last
couple of years, the watchman
paid to keep a constant eye on
the premises was found to be
sleeping placidly at the top of
the flaming building, in utter
ignorance of the conflagration
raging below. The man would
inevitably have been burnt to
death but for the pluck of a
couple of firemen, who hoisted
him out at the imminent risk
of their own lives. He was
landed on earth with nobody a
whit the wiser, and, though
the two firemen would have
undoubtedly gained unlimited
kudos and a medal apiece, they
maintained silence rather than
let the watchman be sacked for
neglect of duty.

British Medical Jour-
nal has been discussing a mat-
ter of much interest to Austra-
lians, viz., the cancer question.
Prof. McFadyean, principal of
London Veterinary College,
about the foremost authority
on the subject, asserts that
cancer is rare in cattle ; that
fibrous cysts and tumors of all
kinds are put down by the ordinary cattle-
men as cancers. McFadyean asseverates, _in
common with several other eminent authorities,
that the statement that cancer can be contracted
by eating the flesh of animals suffering from the
disease is an utter absurdity.

A prisoner—who had previously escaped
from Hobart Gaol, been re-captured, and done six
months in irons, special punishment—got away
again recently, and was run to earth in a sewer on
the outskirts of the town. He was taken back to
prison and promptly sentenced to 12 months in
irons ! In a word, the gaol authorities are having
the man vindictively punished for their own
neglect of duty. The love of liberty being a
noble instinct, even in a felon, no man should be
punished for escaping from prison unless he uses
violence in so doing. It is the gaoler who should
be punished for allowing him to quit.

This country has indeed got the war-
delirium badly. At Perth (W. A.) recently a man
violently assaulted a foreigner because the latter
made unfavorable comments on the British army,
and the court let the brutal patriot off scot-free —
“in consideration of his patriotism.” Supposing
authentic news came here that an Englishman in
Johannesburg had been brutally assaulted because
he didn’t sufficiently admire the Boer army, and
the law had not only refused to protect him but
had openly encouraged his assailant, what a howl
the Australian barbarian would have raised !
At the recent Sydney municipal elections
the glass stood at 102‘ in the shade, and M'Elhone
beat Beere for Fitzroy Ward. Beere might be
expected to go down under the circumstances.

An item that seems worthy of more notice
than it received was that published by one of the
Sydney morning papers, the other day, on the
authority of its own correspondent about a British
soldier striking a Boer prisoner on the mouth. It
was something akin to a previous frank acknow-
ledgement by the same aut ority about how a
crowd of British railway-passengers hooted at
Boer prisoners, and called them “ dogs ” and so
on. It is candid and frank and truthful to men-
tion these things, no doubt, and it does no harm
after all. If it had been the Boers who yelled
‘'dog!” at British prisoners, or a Dutch brute
who struck a British prisoner in the face, the
howl about “ hideous Boer cruelty and cowardice ”
would have blown the new Sydney tram right over
the post-office. But theaverage Jingocanread these
things about the Britisher without the faintest
idea that there is anything disgusting or cowardly
in the case. One Cape Town paper (the South
African Review) lately demanded the execution
of President Steyn, if captured, and suggested
that sudden death was too good for him ; also it
obliquely hinted at flogging as something appro-
priate. Supposing another irresponsible savage
running a paper at Pretoria or Bloemfontein had
suggested something half as.fiendish as fair treat-
ment for British prisoners the news would have
been telegraphed all over the earth, and the
civilised world would have been expected to stand
its hair up on end with horror till further notice.
In London, where wife-beating is still so com-
mon among a very large section of the population
that the law only interferes in aggravated cases,
and where a dull, perfunctory sentence of ss. fine
passed by a perfectly indifferent and unexcited
magistrate is a fair thing for an ordinary,
moderate wife-flogging case, public opinion went
off its head over the bruises said to have been
inflicted on the bodies of some British refugee
women by brutish Dutchmen—the wholelot being
about one-hundredth part of the stock of bruises
which British women receive in eastern London
every Saturday night. The great wife-beating
city wanted Blood and Sudden Death over the
bruises in Africa, yet the bruises in London cost
the same old ss. as aforetime. But one of the
most wildly humorous complaints in a long list
was that of the Australian whose letter was
recently published in Sydney Telegraph. He
said that some young Boers, armed, and drunk
with liquor and the prospect of war, heaved at his
party a most objectionable term which suggested
that their parents were unmarried. It was dis-
gusting enough—but think of an Australian, from
the land of loathsome adjectives, objecting to a
trifle like that! With no war on hand to create
excitement, scores of such and worse “ languages ”
can be heard any night in almost any Sydney
street, and a year or two ago Magistrate John-
ston, of Sydney, not only refused to convict a
man for using still worse expressions, but severely
admonished the policeman for bringing the case
before him. He said the loathsome observations

before the Court were “ the ordinary language of
a certain class,” and were so common it was no
use trying to put them down. And now the
plaint about one adjective in Africa comes all the
way to the land that is blue with obscenity, and
this great curse country is expected to be angry.
Stranger still, it is angry. More than that, it is
absolutely shocked.

HER NIGHT OUT.
Scene: Our back-gate, time 10 p.m., on Noratis night out.
“ Good-night, sweetheart,” he softly said,
And held her tight
Upon his breast; she bowed her head
And said “ Good-night.”
He clasped her close. “ Good-night,” said he
In tender tone.
“ Good-night,” once more responded she.
“My love—my own ! ”
And then “ Good-night, my own dear love,’
Again said he.
More softly than a cooing dove,
“ Good-night,” said she.
But whether he kept up the game
I cannot say,
For I began to find it tame
And came away.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, December 12, 1399.
Mv Dear Mvkk.—
]• irst in importance this week is Hie news Hint
Her Gracious said to the nurses, “How sweet of
von to be so kind to my men.” Simple, artless-
looking, little green <-aiile! All tin; same, don't
be surprised to find it growing into an awful
national calamity. Jwery old cat in Sydney will
bang on to that " How Sweet ! ’’and you'll hear it
all over the old-cat country, until you'll “ would
I were a dog.”
Men (who pay for the paper) wonder how on
earth such babble gets into the cables. Women
don’L Speaking on the best authority, collected
from ’busses and steamers and trams and trains, I
can tell you that that same cable sent a thrill
through more women in N.S.W. than all tiieother
cables sent through men. There wasn't a woman
who didn’t fed as if it was a special tit-bit for her
very own self. Something she could understand
an 1 discuss : “ Wa-n’t it sweet of the Queen to say
that to the nurses?” “ Oh, yes, didn't you think
it was sweet, I thought it was really turret.” “Oh,
I thought it was so sweet.” “So did 1. T did
think it was so sweet.” 1 hose women are awfully
happy, lhey feci as if they are almost talking
politics.
Is local Patriotism paying as sensationally as
was expected. 1 wonder? The benefit matinee
got tip by Mr. .1. C. W illiain.-on last Tuesday
rather indicated otherwise. Her .Majesty's was
not too well filled in any part, and only one largo
bid was made at the auction sale of boxes ; even
it was not phenomenal. Mr. Carlisle Taylor paid
10 guineas for the Governor’s box. His theatre
party-—made up of Society women and a great
scarcity of men—wore an early afternoon look ;
didu t talk, didn t laugh, and was really a
moral lesson to the giddy theatre-parties who
chatter all through everything. You want to see
a large, silent, expensive party in its best clothes
at two o'clock in the afternoon to appreciate the
giddy people who seem to make a theatre too
lively at night.
The benefit programme was chiefly warlike in
tone, except for Miss Hetty Holrovd— in a pink
muslin frock and pink hat—who warbled a ballad
rather ineffectively. Kignold—in a black coat,
grey trousers, and a walking-stick—pointed out
imaginary scenery with his stick, and threw him-
self, with all his old tempestuous elocution, once
more into “1 he breach.” Walter Bentley was
discovered in the midst of some scenery reciting
Clarence’s Dream. Hrownlow the Beautiful sang
splendidly a Kipling song ; but such is faithfuf-
ness—the d.c. didn t recognise the large pink boy
as Browulow till they saw it in the Hkhai.k next
morning (which reminds me that the programmes
had to be paid for). Chambers, from the Tivoli,
made the biggest hit with a “ l’yetriotic ” song,
called “ Motherland,” sung in the green Aus-
tralian-Horse costume, and airing one line that
made the house feel very uncomfortable—" Whe-
rever the British bulldogs are, Australia will be
there ! ” How mdtdpropos t
Apropos of which, the daily papers did their
best to let the public know when the unfortunate
Lancers, who refused to go killing, might be ex-
pected to arrive in Sydney. It came at last to be
a matter of shipping their plain clothes out to
them, and sneaking them into the city early Sun-
day morning, when nobody was about.
Saturday saw another effort at collecting funds
fall rather flat, for the Patriotic Ladies’ collection
only gathered in a couple of hundred pounds. It
was like a small, thin edition of the Hospital beg.
Lady Darley took the largest box, along with
Mrs. Mackenzie, but there was only a moderate
number of boxes going. A line of Kipling was
stuck round the collecting-stalls: “For vonr
credit’s sake, pay. pay, pay, ” but mankind jibbed
at that imperialistic injunction just as blindly as
if it had been a local tailor breaking into ironical
metre at the bottom of his “demned total.”
It may I* a coarse, crude way of looking at it,
but a Patriotic I und seems to accentuate the
primevalness of a man setting out to kill some-
body else’s husband to get bread for Ins own wife.
This is what that man from Granville went to the
war for evidently. The case of his destitute
family was brought before the Council last week,
anil it was found that his wife and children
haven't a Penny to their name—are actually
starving indeed. Still, they will be provided for
now, but if he hadn’t left them to go killing—who
knows !
Florence Nightingale is still alive—she will, I
find, be 30 next May; and has been writing to the
papers a letter which has been widely reprinted
extolling the beauties of War. It knocks the
nonsense out of men, she says ; besoms away their
petty vices ; and—crowning merit ! —stops "their
galjivanting with woman.” The mind of a lady
of 79 is not to be held accountable for much, or it
would really appear as if the heroic Florence wel-
comed War's awful carnage, and the consequent
misery and ruin in thousands of homes, because it
prevented the warriors from cnntin”ing the gay
gambadoes of peace. The veteran spinster would
seemingly prefer to see a man dead or dying than
with his arms around a girl. »
Alfred Hill’s new opera, “ Lady Dolly ” is re-
hearsing merrily. I hear that tlie music is as
delightfully singable as Alfred Hill’s vocal music
always is. Early in the New Year the opera will
be staged at one of the theatres, and we shall see
in the caste Mrs. Adams, a professional actress, as
Lady'Dolly, Hetty Holroyd in the principal sink-
ing part,'Mr. Burns Walker, Mr. Harry Brewer,
and Mr. Beattie, and the Sydney Liedertafel
giving splendid support to the choruses.
Speaking of music, do you remember pretty
]W;sn Xiiia f'lendi, the violiniste who came out
here with A titan Blast year ? She was a slim, dark-
broweil girl, with black hail* dressed low on her
nerl<, lovely grey eyes, and a bright smile, and
was always dressed in grey, or white, liigli-waisted
frocks. She played in a nice, unremarkable sort
of way. and was more admired for her frocks and
■smile and eyebrows than for her virtuosity. Her
engagement has just been announced to Mr.
Arthur Streeton, the well-known Australian
artist.
Uy-the-way, a wedding coming off shortly will
see a well-known and much-liked stock and sta-
tion agent entering the bonds of matrimony for
the third time, lfis third choice is the lady type-
writer from his own office.
Curiosity rc a certain young and fascinating
widow m our midst was curbed a little for some
time, but last week certain Sydney, women broke
out, and resolved to know something definite,
iliev went round to the shops and, between a
yard of lace and a packet of pins, put leading
question- to the dressmakers and milliners until
they discovered every detail of that widow’s
mourning order. At one shop they learned she
had ordered white tulle caps. " White tulle cap's!
Are theii the latest?’' The milliner didn’t know,
very agitated were the three women inakim 1 ’
th;se enquiries. They stood there, and
talked as loadly as if they had been discussing
their own trousseaux. “ They must be the latest
thing* if she wears them.” ** But surely young
wHows don t wear caps?” “The fashion must lie
coming in again.” Then they rustled tliought-
f nUy and abstractedly out of the shop, although
all their husbands are in the best of health at
present.
Still, women will always be looking ahead, or
aside, or behind, when it’s a matter well within
the entirely feminine circle. For instance, a
mother and daughter lately began to beseech the
head of the family to buy shares in a big Sydney
paper. He was a long time in finding out the
reason for their coaxings and urgings. And no
wonder. I hey. were after a fuller description of
thei-r hats anJ frocks and furbelows in tnat par-
ticular print.
Maud MaeCarthy is giving one more concert in
Sydney before she leaves for Hu rope. The
event is fixed for Thursday, Dec. 21st, at the Cen-
tenary Hall.
In new music there is the “ Federation March,”
by Gertye Conway (Glen and Co.)—a struggle
after tlio uuattaineJ as far as march and melody
go Another march from Glen and Co. is the
Clarion,” by H. C. Chandler—a tuneful, spirit'd
air that any soldier might cheerfully march home
from the war to. By the way, the “ Clarion ”is
labelled “Companion to the Pandora March,”
unnecessarily, as everybody knows that all
marches are related even more closely than all
waltzes, but any information about marches is
apropos just now as no other music is half as
ponuhir. Glen and Co. also send three songs,
1 he Croblin Bat,” by (r. S. De Chaneet, a man’s
declamatory ballad, full of ha’s and ho’s and
chromatics and furiosos but lacking in charm and
interest; and “Two Songs,” by Frank Leslie,
pretty, singable, simple lilts, gracefully short, that
1 can recommend to anyone who likes to siim
briefly.
1 lie story* of the two sisters, Jessie and Emma
Evans, who essayed suicide last week, one
accomplishing her end, and one .attempting it—
somehow my pen will write nothing there but
unsuccessfully caused the usual fleeting sensation
among comfortable people who only know of “the
lower classes ” by reading painful things like this
about them in the newspapers. Jessie was a
cripple, with one leg and a crutch, who earned her
living bv needlework, and Emma went out as a
housemaid, but they “had seen better days.”
lliis means, probably, that they both belonged
to that great unfortunate army of “inefficients,”
where life is always a misery, especially in domestic
service where the inefficient is at the mercy of a
woman’s tongue, and where every mistress lias her
own way of doing things, and the girl who is always
changing places has no chance to learn to do any-
thing well for anybody.. Emma was a I wavs out
of a place, -Jessie couldn’t get enough needlework
to keep them both, so they locked their door one
day, drank off some ehlorodyne anil lay down to
die in each other’s arms. When the lodging-
house keeper broke open the door she found Emma
dead and -Jessie lying beside her sister just able to
tell how “we wanted to put ourselves to sleep.”
-Jessie was taken away to the hospital and may
recover. .Jessie is the cripple.
Hie uneven distribution of misery finds some
terrible evidence in the realm of women who work
for their bread. And the marvellous things that
happen therein! One woman with five children
keeping herself and the five, respectably, on 14s.
a week ; women in shops required to keep them-
si-lves and dress like la lies in black-silk and a lot
of jet on 1 os. a week ; girls in tea-rooms clothing
themselves nicely and paying their fares to town
on os. a week. These are only a few out of thou-
sands—and yet. and yet. it isn't so very often that
women east themselves out of life. Men hail"
themselves continually with shillings in their
pockets, but the suicided woman—like Emma
Evans—is picked up with an utterly empty purse.
, W rites u.y Melbourne correspondent:—
“The sunny second day of Austral wheel-meet-
ing (Dec, !)) was hard on riders ignorant of the art
of < ressmg to advantage. From tin- stand, blonde
i II Martin, all in pale blue, looked the pick of
the bunch. Parsons, of the inky top-thatch,
wisely clings to his genteel white, dott d with
b.ack moons, like Nedda's frock in ‘ Pagliac ci.’
Carpenter's blue-green blend, with the sun on it,
was sheeny as peacock plumage ; but Gordon, the
swarthy, whose darkness should background a
blaze of color, was dingy—not even cool-looking—
m grey and .brown. A gold-starred green seemed
summery, so did various blends of white and
buttercup.
“The few fair-haired competitors had all the
best of the Austral beauty-show. Dark cyclists
and cricketers of local manufacture usually tend
to the leathery type. Now, if they were bronzy,
like Porta of old, and not afraid of a bit of color,
the Held would be a thing of beauty on a day like
•Saturday. Lots of women aired their draggle-
tailed Cup dresses, and, in consequence, looked
angels down to the knees and slatterns below that,
liny silk muslin frills won’t wash, worse luck,
but a dry-cleaner might improve matters.
“ The only garments that linger in this scribe’s
memory are the bright yellow boots of an official
on the Oval and the slightly-jaded white muslin
frock of a niuch-talked-of heiress, worn with a
primrose straw hat, also past its first youth.
“ Lord Brassey’s yacht is being fitted up, re-
and overhauled, in readiness for the
voyage ’Ome in January. She has been lying-'up
at Geelong. Some months ago, H.E. wanted to
sell his boat, but no ‘reasonable’ offers came to
hand. His aides go to England by ordinary mail,
w.tii the possible exception of Lord Richard
Nevili, who is credited with a desire to remain in
Australia for a year longer. Life here is pleasant
for a younger son without great means or expecta-
tions.
. “English papers say that Governor Jerry Smith
is expected ’Ome early next year, but intends
returning to Australia. Now’s the time for W.A.
to convey to the distinguished hotel-proprietor
and Peak-hill boomster that lie can be excused.
His Ex. didn’t visit Melbourne with the other
Governors at Cup time, and when lie came last
year he made a very bad impression. He read a
long speech at a banquet in praise of W.A. In
the middle of the dreary ordeal, an august per-
sonage whispered to his neighbor: ‘This, I sup-
pose, is the “dry-blow” process ! ’
“ Coll ins-street East, was largely represented at
the Brough’s last Melb. performance of ‘The
Physician.’ Groups of well-known doctors were
scattered about the theatre, displaying.a certain
clannishness in the manner of their distribution.
The gushing ingenuousness of Miss Temple in her
interview with the handsome yoimi physician,
and his interested, almost caressing maimer, were
] joints which caused much amusement among the
medicos, some of whom have earned much
popularity among their fair patients by the culti-
vation of a similar style.
“ 7»’c those Trelawney toilettes, no wonder
women were timid flatterers in crinoline-times.
Bell-sleeves and balloon skirts invited death by
combustion, and small blame to the charmer in
cyclorama skirts who fainted at the possibilities
s iggested by mouse-squeak. Also, remembering
those horrid traditions of blushing victims hung
up by their hoops, one understands why our
grandmothers habitually sereame I apprehensively
when crossing stiles and dismounting from
vehicles. As for nervousness in boats, a drowning
woman with her eluthes-eage and all bellying up
round her neck, was denied even the consolation
of dying decently. Feminine ankles are a drug in
the market; these athletic times. The Trelawney
women look absurd, attractive, essentially feminine
creatures, except in their pork-pie hats, which
accentuate the wearers’ unolassical noses.
“At the far-back Cathcart benefit (Dec. Ist),
with its big, summery audience and tearful speech
of thanks, Lady Brassey and friend both affected
silk-muslin ficlms, while the latter dispensed with
a collar-band. Muslins,, minus collars, and plus
transparent yoke and sleeves, are still prevalent.
At a recent race meeting, a tall, fair, nobody-in-
particular, with long white neck and new'ly-
turned-up flaxen hair showed fetter than anyone
else, in her white frock built on these lines. But at
that benefit a tubby little Jewess achieved nothing
in particular by ventilating her nut-brown chest
and back through a lace chemisette, let into a
maroon glace.!
“Same afternoon Ida Gresham, of the Hollo-
way co ; , took a spell from the woman-witli-a-
past. For the time being she ceased from swag-
gering— unlike the departed Elizabeth Watson
who, when she did get a rare chance of playing
the saint, showed off her figure-advantages, rolled
her eyes, and laughed recklessly, quite according
to ‘ no-better-than-she-should-be ’ traditions.
“1 his week, sassiety pours its congratulations
out to Miss Olive Greene, who has just taken on
the probation contract with Mr. J. Hilton
Maekay, from Albury side. Miss Greene is a
daughter of the ex-Commissioner of Vic. railways,

Macdonald.
“Tlie engagement of the Chimsides’ niece to
Mr. Gordon J-vou is announced, but there are as
good fish in tlie sea still unhooked. That dark-
eyed heiress, for instance, with her money in her
own right, dependent on nobody’s whim; is »he
to be lost to Australia? .Patriotic observers
breathed more freely when foreign invader No. 1
left these shores. But in the ranks of subsequent
wooers Australians seem nowhere in comparison
with two doughty outsiders-an imported iordlmg
and a middle-aged touring Britisher.
“At the auction for Princess’ seats for J. C.
Williamson’s benefit, Mrs. George (Jhirnside had
a male deputy to bid something like fourteen
guineas for the left lower box. W. R. Wilson
took a slice out of the side of the circle, at two
guineas a cushion. Lawyer Purves played the
auctioneer in a would-be Court-slashing style at
first ; then his jokes ran out, and he ended by
being irritable and having a go at a music-shop
proprietor, who haggled over his two-guinea bid
to such an extent tnat the haunner-banger iiad to
settle a disputed point ny putting'five shillings on
to it and knocking it down to himself.

Several of the recently-appointed N.S.W.
honorary magistrates took to the Bench the day
after they were sworn-in. One N.S.W. Judge
holds that J’s.P., when first appointed should sit
on the Bench at least a month before taking
aiiy part in adjudication ; in other words,
that they should pick up the forms of
court by observing their seniors.
Judge Willis, one of the early Judges
of Port Phillip, held the same theory,
but pushed it further. Scandalised
by the frequency of J.P. blunders,
he issued a Court order calling on
all J’s.P. to attend in future the
sittings of Melbourne Supreme
Court in its criminal jurisdiction,
in order, as he tersely expressed it,
that “ye may learn something
of your business.” The
J’s.P., didn’t attend and
Willis fined them, with

there is another operation hanging over me and
the doctors say I am not ready for it yet.”
“ Scribe ” to The Bulletin :
The verses, “ With Death’s Prophetic Ear,” published
in a recent issue, and credited to “L.J.C. H., in a Cape-
town paper,” were really written by “Johnny” Sandes,
of Melb., and appeared in the “Oriel” column of the
Argus, some three months ago. “L.J.C.8.” is a jour-
nalistic perjurer, and it would be well to let the Capetown
paper know it.
Way Lee, the Quong Tart of Adelaide, is
perhaps the only full-blooded Chinaman in Aus-

The latest is that Bill Beach, J.P., re-
tired world’s champion sculler, has sold his farm

them on the fingers of one hand.
The patronising impudence of Shiels, the
new Treasurer of Victoria, in his allusion to
Theo. Fink, one of the honorary members of the
Cabinet, has caused a lot of amusement. In his
letter to the Premier nominating Fink for office,
Shiels speaks of him condescendingly as “an
intelligent man ’’ whom he will be glad to have to
help him, Shiels, with the Treasury.
Vabien Solomon, the come-and-gone S.A.
Premier, was the first Hebrew to bold Ministerial
office in S.A. He was formerly editor and co-

probably comes next to Holder as an authority on

Ex-Premier Turner is expected to be back
again in office so soon that, last week, a waggish

The card was put up before new Premier M‘Lean
took possession.
Said that Lord Ampthill is to be the next
Vie. Governor. The Age, which makes the
announcement on the authority of a private corres-
pondent in London, quaintly says “he is the
second Baron Ampthill, the baronetcy having
been created in IBM. ” Apparently the Age doesn’t
know the difference between a barony and a
baronetcy. Lord Ampthill is Gov. Beauchamp’s
brother-in-law.
Old William M‘Lellan, ex-member for
Ararat (Vic.), he of the strident voice, unparliamen-
tary language, and bluff, hearty ways, was known
as the “Dove of Ararat.” In the no-confidence
motion, M.L.A. O’Neill scored heavily when he
termed the office-hunting Toil toiler, who ousted
M‘Lellan, the “Rat of Ararat.” He was promptly
called to order, but the jeering nickname will
stick like wax.
J. G. Drake, the coming Queensland poli-
tician who never came, the unsatisfactory, unprac-
tical democrat who never did much for the
democracy, the man whom God somehow left un-
finished—has ended by accepting a portfolio in the

it is difficult to say whether Drake is another good
man gone wrong, or another good man who never
went right going on as usual.
The inflated O’Sullivan, N.S.W. Works
Minister, attended the new' Pyrmont bridge pile-
driving t’other day, and astounded the company
v. ith a dreary discourse on bridge-building taken
I>p from some encyclopaedia. He began with
lerodotus and primitive bridges in “ the grey
dawn of civilisation,” and wandered down the
centuries past Trajan's Danube bridge, the Menai-
Straits bridge, and the Tay bridge, with a passing
reference to Chinese, Bohemian, and Russian
bridges, till he reached “the famous Brooklyn
bridge,” and the project of another wild genius to
bridge Port Jackson heads. And S.M. Herald
solemnly prints the farrago of fifth-hand informa-
tion as a matter of public interest!
The Australian Agricultural Co., now
negotiating to unload to Govt, or others some
parts of its vast land possessions in N.S.W., sent
out from England as its first manager
Sir Edward Parry, the celebrated Arctic
explorer. Lady Parry accompanied him,
and her letters descriptive of N.S.W.
society in the thirties make quaint reading.
Dean Cowper, of St. Andrew’s, having
finished his course at Oxford, was also
commissioned by the eo. to go to N.S.W.
as chaplain to the co.’s employes. The co.
at. that time contemplated a kingdom
within a kingdom, and purposed keeping
its tenants and employes under its own
hand. The original scheme provided also
for the establishment of schools, so that
had it succeeded to the letter, N.S.W.
would by now have had some interesting
social problems to solve.
Lady Broome’s memoirs of colonial
life, now running in an English maga-
zine, recall this-side-of-the-world memo-
ries of the ever-striving Gov. Broome,
who ruled Westralia for seven years.
Broome was an omnivorous reader and an
unappreciated writer. He was reviewer,
art-critic, verse and essay writer in numer-
ous English periodicals, but was always
growling at the reception his efforts
gained. He had the luck, however, to
marry Lady Barker, the widow of an old
Genera], who had influence in high circles
and was able to work him into Govt,
posts at Mauritius and elsewhere, finally
landing him in the Westralian Governor-
ship. He published a couple of vols. of
verse and rehabilitated the character of Byron, so
sadly damaged by the “ revelations ” of Harriet
Beecher Stowe. But from his own account of
himself he was never satisfied.

G. W. Lambert’s great picture, “Across

his green time by the N.S.W. National Gallery
trustees for a mere .£lOO, is, it is calmly
announced, being zincographically reproduced on
a large scale and issued as a Xmas supplement to
a Sydney firm’s trade paper. Naturally enough
Lambert is angry and disgusted. When he sold
for a song his big work, he parted with the copy-
right, it is true ; but he looks to the trustees to
protect his picture from being degraded into an
ironmonger’s puff. What consideration do the
Gallery trustees get in exchange for this sordid
piece of sacrilege? Is Lambert’s work treated
thus unceremoniously because he is an Australian
and doesn’t count—or would the trustees be pre-
pared to let Eastway Bros, zinco. Luminais’
“Sons of Clovis ” and issue it as a supplement to
their Catfish Gazette ?

It is to be hoped that the mantle referred to was
properly mended, and washed and disinfected of
wine, before Mr. Shiels wore it—from Friday

The Broken Hill strike-conspiracy trial of
’92 was a leg-up for a lot of people. It sent Sleath

him ; Wilshire, of the Crown Law Office, who in-
structed, has got a ppliee-magistraey ; Inspector
Larkins has become a superintendent, and Saun-
ders an inspector ; and both detectives have gone
up steps. But Judge Backhouse, who relieved
the Circuit Court judges of a nasty job, is still on

Aboriginalties.
The skeleton of an aboriginal was lately
dug up at Dubbo. A brass plate was discovered
amongst the bones. This proves that the original
owner of them was a king, Billy by name, Billy
being—since the Whitefellow Invasion—as indica-
tive of royalty as the title Pharaoh was in old
Egypt. There was some talk of having the
skeleton mounted and placed in the Museum, bub
the authorities decided that the proper place for
it was in the custody of the Aborigines Protection
Board.
He was a new-chum Irishman, sent to
borrow an axe next door ; and making his request
to a good-looking woman standing in front, was
told to go round to the back and “ask the master.”
Pat went, and, presently returning, said he
couldn’t see anybody but an “ ould baste av a
Chinyman.” “Confound your impudence,” said
the lady, “ that’s my husband.” “ Yer husband,”
said Pat, “ ’arrah, woman, what in God’s name
possessed you to go an’ marry a haythen like
that?” “What of it,” said the irate Mrs. Ah
Fat, “my sister did-a great deal worse! ” “Worse
is it! Mother o’ heaven, what did she do ?’’ “She
married an Irishman!”

A correspondent apropos The Bulletin’s
recent child-birth and nation-birth article :
Concerning the indisposition of so many Australians to
be born and the fear expressed (8., Nov. 11) that the
great interior (of the land) would go untenanted. I
some time ago struck a typical Never-Never township of
the older sort, and, as it was the close season for game, I
spent the time exploring family trees. The township’s
central figure had nine mulga branches J oldest about 24,
youngest still squeaking. He had six brothers and sisters
“ somewheres about ” ; he reckoned they averaged seven
apiece. All were born in the inlands. The school teacher
told me there were that day nine families represented ab
school ; attendance, 33. Youngest, say 4£ ; oldest, say 15.
Still there was obviously an indisposition to marry. Most
of the stations discourage the habit in their employees ;
don’t even like married overseers. And as the blacks
have practically disappeared ! Boldly generalising,
and in spite of the fact that the township just talked of
isn’t at all Scotch (nor is the writer), Scotch parents are
the best colonisers in the inlands. But in the iidands
there isn’t data to even generalise about the younger
generation of Scotch-Australians in this regard. And,
regarding the theory that bad times and poor birth-rates
are twins: Absolutely the most “prolific” township
known to the writer is a S.A. copper-town, where opera-
tions were abandoned 20 years ago, after six or seven
years of hard times, and where the people have been
living mostly on hope and home-grown vegetables ever
since. One local family of 22 is considered a fairish size.
Others run it pretty close, but none boasts unless it passes
a dozen. I haven’t heard whether the rise in copper has
given the local registrar any less to do. Also, I take
about the most prosperous far-inland town of Australia
(possibly the same results would be got elsewhere), and
ascertain that, though the general youngster-rate seems
quite up to the average, the couples of the professional
class, including the bosses of the local staple industry,
don’t average three children.

Mr. John F. Mann, an associate of explorer
Leichhardt, to The Bulletin :
“ A.H.” (8., 25/11/’99) refers to the discovery of certain
relics on the Tully River, “which may possibly have
formed part of Dr. Leichhardt’s equipment,” and which
included part of a dray. lam able to say that he never
took any vehicle with him on any of his journeys. This
Tully River also is a long way out of Leichhardt’s line of
march, which was from near Roma westward. The tree
referred to as “ Leichhardt’s tree ” is probably the bunya-
bunya (Auracaria Bedwellii), which grows to a great
height and bears a large cone much prized by the natives.
Or the tree may possibly be a species of arborescent
zamia that also bears a cone-like fruit which is poisonous
until macerated in running water, when it can be used in
a variety of ways, but I never heard of Dr. L. having
subsisted for weeks upon it.

After a recent dust-storm on Oonnnlpie
Downs, N.S.W., men were sent in to clean out
the rooms with shovels and wheelbarrows.. The
beds, and everything in the house, were buried in
dust, and the papered-canvas ceilings of two rooms
broke down with the weight of dust that was
driven up under the iron. A high cane-grass wall
is now being erected round the homestead to
“ break ” it; and, on the run, men are kept going
all through the summer shovelling sand away from
gates and fences, to keep them from being buried
out of sight.

Recently a mob of 500 bullocks were
hard-pressed for water on the way to Bourke.
Meeting a bullock team, the cattle smelt the water
in the cask, broke away from the drovers, and
rushed the waggon, killing one bullock and injur-
ing others. The teamster and the drovers had a
hard fight with the maddened beasts ; the former
killing one of the travelling mob with an axe.

Friday, the Ist of the present month, went
close to "making a Sydney heat-record for any
December, being only beaten by 22nd Dec., ’71 —
with 103'8 degrees, as against 102 T—and being
within 6 deg. of the highest shade temperature
ever recorded in Sydney. But the following
night did establish a record in more ways than
one. After a sweltering day, there arrived in the
evening—instead of the almost invariable, cool
southerly—a cruel practical joke of Nature in the
shape of a nor’-wester of such furnace-like in-
tensity that the mercury positively jumped (in
12 min.) from 85 to 98, and stuck there for 8 solid
—or, rather, fluid —hours. But, when it did start
to fall, it dropped 26£ deg. in 40 min., falling
10 deg. of this in 3 min.—a phenomenon almost
without parallel.

“Yarran”: The animal inquired about
by “G.C.0.” (8., 25/11/99), is evidently the
congener of a rodent common on the tableland
between the Etheridge River and the Sea View
Range at the back of Rockingham Bay, N.Q. The
animal’s local name is the “ Kennedy Devil,” and
its scientific name “ Diaboluspotend paradoxus.”
The N.Q. variety, however, is of a somewhab
greenish hue with vermilion stripes. It uses its
tail in a manner similar to the kangaroo, to
balance its body in the act of leaping. And, like
that other paradox, the platypus, it partakes of
the characters of two distinct genera —namely,
the tree-inhabiting rodents and the pouch-bearing
mammals. Another variety is occasionally met
with in the Cobar district of N.S.W.

“ Ophis ” : The most curious case of snake-
bite I know of was this: A man on the Upper
Murray (N.S.W.) made a desperate swipe at a
snake with a shovel, cutting off the head and a
few inches of the body. This portion rebounded
inside his shirt, open at the chest. The head
promptly bib him, and, though he was treated ab
once, it took him days to get right. One daren’t
put an incident like this in fiction.
“G. 8.” : Be that remarkable
man-albatross story. When I was
attached to a man-of-war once I saw
a similar occurrence. A man fell
from the mizzen topgallant-yard,
and as he rose and fell in the seas,
an albatross swooped down on him,
whereupon he gripped the big bird’s
feet, and was actually pulled clean
out of the water. Then he let go,
and the boat coming up, was saved.
Became “ Albatross Joe ” forthwith.
When a N.S.W. South Coast
cocky was recently offered a Jay-
peeship, he consulted an old man
about accepting. “Snap it, Bill,”
said theancient, “snap anything! You
might be going among strangers some
day, and they won’t know but what you’re
honest! ”

When a certain prominent backblocks man

out of the blanky way.” They all take ’em ; but,
up to date, there have been no hangings.
“ He’s a mischief-maker,

you hear of the dirty trick he
served me? ’Twas about six
months ago, an’ I was goin’

afternoon. In the evenin’,
Hogan, who’d seen me walkin’
herrin’-bone, goes to me missus
an’, ses he : ‘ Eunson won’t be

Well, the wife thought he
knew all about it, an’ she
didn’t expect me that night;

was a big cove there what
gave me a divil of a batin’,

Dear Bulletin. —My would-be instructor,
“X.,” is wrong in supposing (8., 21/10/’99) that
the snakes of Tasmania are different from Aus-
tralian snakes. They are identical; and the most
common venomous snakes of Tasmania are also
the most common in Australia. I can’t remember
even one snake in Tasmania which doesn’t also

occur in Australia. For the last time let me say
that Australian snakes don’t “ strike ” ; they
simply bite. —H. J. M‘Cooey.
* * * *
H. J. M'Cooey answers sundry inquirers :
Between the kangaroo and the wallaby there is gene-
rically no distinction, and the specific differences are un-
important. Unlike the kangaroo, the wallaby has the
interspace between the nostrils naked of hair. Beyond
that, there are only some few distinctions of color, which
(scientifically) don''t count.
Young N.S.W. has a horrid dream to the effect

The two Melb. youths who have confessed
to the Fitzroy bomb-outrage, the half-dozen recent
attempts at train-wrecking, and incidentally to
the posting of Melbourne and suburbs with the
stencilled words, “ Anarchy ! ” are indeed in-
teresting studies. Johnson, the younger but
shrewder of the pair, is a tall, loosely-built lad of
18, with a face so sallow and flat as to make him
at first sight appear a Chinese half-caste. Lover-
ing, the other amateur anarchist, is a year older
and the exact antithesis of Johnson. He is a fair,
gentle, girlish-looking young man with a pretty,
pink-and-white complexion and an eternal simper.
He it was who broke down before the questioning
of the detectives and gave the whole game way.
In conversation both youths show themselves
possessed of good general education and a remark-
able knowledge of mechanics. Johnson is an
engineer, and Lovering an electrician, and they
are both enthusiasts in their respective call-
ings. They apparently had none of the vices
of the ordinary young man and when not en-
gaged in arranging engines of destruction,
they stayed at home o’ nights studying the
Scientific American, Work, Knowledge, and
other technical journals of which they possessed
quite a barrow-load. Though they termed them-
selves jocosely “The Broad Arrow Gang of
Anarchists ” neither takes the slightest interest in
politics. They astonished the detective guarding
them by describing wireless telegraphy, Lyddite
shells, Maxim guns and turbine motive-power
with the detail and freedom of thorough acquaint-
ance. Considerin':- the extensive mechanical and
chemical knowledge of these young men and the
fact that an unfilled bomb of large dimensions
was found buried in Loveridge’s backyard, it is
just as well they were pounced on in time.

“M. 0.” : Be curlew protecting nest
(“R.E.F.” in B. 14/10/’99). The curlew never
builds a nest. She generally lays two eggs on the
bare ground. I found my first curlew’s eggs
through seeing calves congregated round some-
thing that turned out to be a “broody” curlew.
Shy as the curlew is of humans, it is otherwise
rather plucky.
The Victorian Govern-
mentrecently announced vacan-
cies for a few mounted con-
stables. There will not be
more than 50 wanted at the
most, nevertheless nearly 1000
men rolled up at the barracks
for the medical and other
exams. Many were fine speci-
mens of the typical Australian
—long, slab-sided, straight-
mouthed, loose-jointed youths.
The lustiest specimens—to the
amateur eye were mostly
rejected by the examining
medicos, chiefly for varicose
veins. . Only 320 were passed
as sound in legs and feet. The
board of examiners knocked
out another 200, for various
reasons ; and, provided _ they
can get through a simple
“ dictation ” exam., the remain-
ing 100 will have to further
satisfy inspectors as to their
horsemanship ; after that they
must undergo another and
more exacting medical over-
haul, and then they are finally
within view of helmet and
breeches. And ever afterwards
they are of no earthly use,
being chronic sufferers from
that painless bub exasperating
complaint known as swelled-
head.

King Billy had no golden crown,
But he was gently laid to rest
With naught to tell of his renown
But brass-plate on his breast.
They laid him in his grave—their prince
And leader bold—his spearmen grim :
And they and all his tribe long since
Have passed and followed him.
Where reigns his Ghost? In what dim glades?
It strides, maybe, a royal swell,
A blacker Shade amongst the Shades,
O’er meads of asphodel.
But nay 1 Those meads are not for him :
He hunts—a phantom feed in view—
Young Jones, of Bargowbahlong, has his portrait taken by a friend. He is about to go and fight the Boers as
there is (he says) nothing for him to do at home.
Opossums spectral, dingoes dim,
And ghostly kangaroo.
King Billy had the luck to die,
And go to his own Kingdom Come,
Before his tribe was wiped out by
Religion, clothes, and rum.
They say his royal skeleton
Should not to the Museum go 1
Were he alive, not dead and gone,
He’d say “ A chillun ? Sol”
In Boulak lies, in mummied state,
For any man to see who will,
Rameses called of old the Great —
A greater King than Bill.
Old bones, if ye could only tell
Where now is That which made ye King—
’Tis safe to say that ye would sell
For more than creeds would bring.

“Depot Glen,” the place where Sturts
explorers camped in the disastrous expedition
of 1844-5 during one of the most awful sum-
mers on way-back record, is now included in
Mt. Poole station, one of the better-favored of
the dreary runs in the N.W. corner of N.S.W.
John Poole, second in command, died there,
and is buried on the Creek—which, like most
inland creeks, averages 364 dry days in the
year ; and in leap year 365. The party built a
mound of rocks ; but later coiners have put up
a neat railing and engraved a stone ; though
the latter work is pretty elaborate, the en-
graver had no dictionary handy, and John
Poole’s monument proclaims that the man
underneath was “ seccond in command.”
There is a beefwood tree over the grave —and
a wool-scour just across the creek. The station
people have made it the local burying-ground,
and there are at the spot six or seven other
mounds about the length of a man. Sturt did
have luck in striking that gorge ; for, though
the water-hole isn’t big, it is the best for miles
—say, 70 yards across, but deep, and what
is almost as important, well-protected from
winds. The station, by the way, is owned by
Melb.’s ex-Mayor, Matthew Lang, and a
partner.

In a certain West Coast (M.L.) constit-

between the two candidates was very close,
and the community being a spor ting one, much
wagering took place. Within a few days of
polling, when it had become certain that
whichever man got in would do so “by the
skin of his teeth,” someone started a syndicate
the members of which were to put their money
on one man, and all vote for him. The mem-
bership reached about 100 or so, and the man
backed got in by 18 votes.

Clause from the will of a recent N.Q.
defunct:
I give, devise and bequeath to J.S.M., of T , one
God-d—- for his own sole and separate use absolutely ;
may the curse of the Almighty rest upon him.
The facial expression of “J.S.M.” on receiving
tidings of his windfall would be an interesting
physiognomical study. Can anyone suggest how
said bequest be dealt with by the executors so that
“'J.S.M.” be duly seized of his inheritance?

“ Gob.” : Some time ago, called at a hut
in the Abercrombie region. The house-father
came out, followed by a little son, about six
years old. The boy begged his father for a
piece of bread. The father seemed annoyed, and
went and got the tomahawk. I wondered to see
the little fellow smile when the father was bring-
ing the tomahawk towards him. The father
merely handed the boy the “tommy,” and the
little fellow went away quite happy, cutting
bushes and twigs. The father says it’s a never-
failing remedy when there’s no bread.
Rev. Woolls-Rutledge, of Sydney, has been
writing to the press to deprecate what he calls the
“ desecration of the Sabbath ” recently committed
byN.S.W. Works-Minister O’Sullivan, at Goul-
burn, by making inspection-visits and holding a
municipal conference on Sunday, and topping off
in the evening with a banquet. The business part
of the desecration Mr. Rutledge, being a true
Briton, might have condoned, but the pleasure—
never ! Which all merely goes to show how hard
it is for the parsonic mind to grasp the fact that
the days of the Sawbath-according-to-Rutledge
are practically numbered, and that the Sunday-
aecording-to-O’Sullivan has come—or, at all
events, is coming— to stay. Also, where there
is no “ sacredness ” there can be no “desecration,”
and the sacredness of any one day of the week—as
distinct from the expedience of a day of Rest
(not a day of Rust) —is a rapidly-expiring super-
stition amongst Gentiles.

J.C. : Arguing against the statement that the Boer is a
patriot fighting for hearth and home, you remark that
“the Transvaal isn’t the Boers’ country—they stole it
from the natives.” Then-Australia can’t be'our country
because we stole it from the natives. Therefore, you
deny that either Boer or Australian can ever be a pat riot.
Besides, there were practically no natives in the Trans-
vaal when the Boers first entered it. Chaka, the Zulu
destroyer, responsible for 1,000,000 deaths in his terrific
career, had swept the land like a whirlwind before the first
trekkers arrived. There were ruins, ashes, bones, gorged
beasts of prey beyond counting, but practically no human
owners... .Gwynne : Not enough in it .Turkey: “Presser”

Old P. : “Mystery,” lame and tame and pointless
J.G. : “Defeated” has no kernel Gobung: Idea not

dead man’s memory isn’t “drinking his health.”
A.D.E. : Neat; may use ... Jes. O. : Good idea, but too
much preliminary palaver; and otherwise loosely han-

publish your well-written story. Already we get 40
weepful tales and sketches to" every cheerful one
Burrabogie : Forget the name, but it was a local sporting
paper ...C.R.J. : Have shut-down on such suicide-des-
criptions... E.W.S.: Such a formality needed no answer.
Yeaite : Unprintable J. Louisson ; Don’t care
about going into details Oolu : Lively fact, but unin-
teresting comment Serge : If your friend sees funerals
where there are no funerals and yet doesn’t drink, then

J.H.li. : We never even pretend to read such microscopic
aqd closely-written MS. ...E.G.P. : Your weird effort is
strong in spots, but the end is pure farce Minko:
The valor of the gentleman from the Transvaal, inter-
viewed by Sydney D.T., would be impressive, were not
his story purely ex-parte... F.J.Mac. : Coarse and labo-
rious J.J.P. : Much humor, but too long for interest,

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will, find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they wdl
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*

A leading article reprinted from London
Star —which claims the largest circulation among
London evening papers, and which is supported
by the Daily Chronicle, the Manchester
Guardian, and other representative English
journals—to show the vast body of British
opinion which .finds no voice in the Australian
Jingo daily press :
Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Rhodes, and. their Yellovv Press
see to-day the desire of their hearts. They have in cold
deliberation hunted down a little nation until at last,
like a wounded stag, she stands at bay in blind despair.
... In the same circumstances Englishmen would do
the same thing. Indeed, we are sure they would have
done it sooner. They would not have let their chances
slip by during these last weeks. They would have struck
while their enemy was weak. But the Boer general held
back his burghers, waiting vainly in the hope of peace.
While they waited our troops poured into Durban, and it
is not strange that a moment came when they could wait
no longer.
They have been cornered in two ways. They were
cornered geographically. Twice they trekked to secure
the freedom they prize so dearly, but at last they were
hemmed in on all sides by the expansion of our Empire.
The Jameson Raid was the beginning of the end. It
failed, but out of its failure springs another Raid,
organised by Mr. Chambkrliin and backed by the whole
military force of the Empire.
Slowly the Boers saw that the franchise negotiations
were only a pretext for aggression. After months of
disingenuous shiftings and shufflings, came the dispatch
declaring it was useless “to further pursue” the nego-
tiations, and announcing that the British Government
would formulate its own proposals. The Boers waited
for those proposals. They never came. Nothing came
but transports crammed with soldiery. This was Policy
No. 2. The final demands were to be withheld until an
o.r my’corps to enfore them was on the spot. Thus the
Boers were caught a second time in a trap. They came
to the only conclusion possible, namely, that Policy No.
2 would wipe them out. The forecasts given by the
Times and Telegraph prove that their fears were well-
founded . . .
The germ of the war is to be found in the Report of
the South Africa Committee, and in Mr. Chamberlain’s
subsequent testimonial to Mr. Rhodes in the House of
Commons. The shareholders in that common shame have
gone in for reconstruction, to use a metaphor from com-
pany finance which is peculiarly appropriate. When it
is desirable to obliterate ugly facts in the history of a
company, it is the custom to reconstruct it, thus blotting
out unpleasant records. That is what is being done to-
day. Messrs. Rhodes, Chamberlain and Co. are wiping
out their past turpitude in war.
They have been well-served by their parasites in the
Yellow Press, who have practically made the war out of
lies and racial hate and the murderous passion of
revenge. The emissaries appointed in South Africa by
Mr. Beit have done their work well . . .
As to any honor arid glory in the matter, the words are
a mockery in the mouth of the cosmopolitan financiers
who have engineered this sordid crime. We pity our sol-
diers, who are sent to lay down their lives in a leprous
cause, who fight against “men in mufti,” against the
“ embattled farmer” who is defending his fatherland and
his home. Let ns remember that there will not be a
homestead in the Transvaal or the Free State which will
not mourn the loss of a father or a brother or a son. It
is easv for Fleet-street and Park-lane to shout for war.
They have hired our brave soldiers to fight their battles.
But these Dutch farmers must shed their own blood.
A pathetic political story concerning a
Sydney citizen. He was getting along com-
fortably, if modestly, in his particular line of
business, and he was happy at home and at peace
with the world, until the politician he most
admired —G. H. Reid —arrived at the Premiership.
It was then he conceived the idea of being
nominated to a seat in the Leg. Council, and it
settled on his heart. .He communicated his
passion to a sympathetic friend who hadn’t the
heart or sense to tell him to stick to business and
leave the Leg. Council alone. The friend pointed
out that he would have to keep up appearances
and sport the outward and visible sign, however
deceptive, of a big banking-account — a carriage-
and pair. He took the hint—hired a carriage-and-
pair and coachman, at least once a week, and was
driven, with his wife, through all the conspicuous
highways and byeways of Sydney. He had the
unspeakable satisfaction of nodding to Premier
Reid several times from this position of vantage,
and he was sanguine he had made an impression
in political and social circles. Then came the
trouble between Reid and the Council over the
direct-taxation business. It was whispered that
a batch of new councillors would be appointed.
For days and nights the nominee-expectant hardly
left his seat in the carriage—he engaged it per-
manently on the urgent advice of his sympathetic
friend. Then the list was gazetted and his name
was absent ! The blow was terrible. The sym-
pathetic friend soothed him with the assurance
that he had been accidentally overlooked, and
counselled him to keep calm, and continue to be
seen in the carriage, and his day would come. He
waited for four more long years and drifted deeply
into debt over carriage-hire. At last his oppor-
tunity looked certain. The Council had rejected
the second Federal Enabling Bill, and another
Reid batch of nominations was necessary. The
list appeared and again his name was absent! It
took the sympathetic friend months to buoy him
with hope. He was seen three or four times
afterwards in the hired carriage, but a crusher
came with the ministerial crisis which ended
Reid’s long reign and inaugurated the rule of
Lyne. And now a worn, thin, grey, disappointed
man with an overdraft goes round on foot, and
fades visibly every day.

The accepted design for the proposed
Californian University at Berkeley is expected to
cost about one hundred millions of dollars to exe-
oute. The designer, a Frenchman, has in fact
contemplated the erection of a veritable educa
tional, artistic, and scientific city. Mrs. Hearst’
a hugely-wealthy widow, devoted .£400,000 to the
preliminary competition in designs amongst the
architects of the world. The structures will cover
400 acres.

If “ the Bloody Shirt ” is not waved vigor-
ously in N.S.W. at an early date, it will not be
the fault of Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge’s letters to
Sydney Daily Telegraph.
The now-prosperous W. H. Burgess, of
V.D.L. Bank-smash notoriety, has the front to
allow announcements that he is feeling his way to
re-enter Tas. Parliament to go uncontradicted.
It is on the cards that, in the event of the
M'Lean Ministry disappearing after a brief
innings, Turner and Gillies will form a coalition
Govt. Deakin is functus officio, having booked
himself for the first Federal Ministry.
Sydney D.T. permits one H. S. Bond to
observe in its columns that “Even England may
be wrong in the sight of God.’’ The Bulletin
directs the attention of the police authorities to
this outburst of treasonable blasphemy.
Where are the politicians’ donations to
the bogus Patriotic Fund ? Up to now, the
valorous M’s.P. who have so ferociously sooled
“ democratic ” Australia on to the Dutch farmer
rightly struggling to he free have subscribed—
wind !
Liquor prohibition still remains a dream.
After all the cackle, it was carried in but one
e'actorate (Clutha, where the cranks abound) at
Maoriland general election. When men cease to
eat and to love, they will cease to drink. Mean-
while, let the State see that they get what is good
to drink.
There wasn’t any semblance of the boasted
“ British fair play ” about Queensland Assembly’s
reception of the Dawson Ministry. It didn’t even
get a chance to announce its policy, and show the
Assembly whether it deserved support or not. It
didn’t have the semblance of a hearing. The
attitude of the gentlemanly Philp was: “Your
policy may be of inestimable benefit to the
country—as you haven’t had a chance to explain
it there is no evidence to the contrary; but we
have an opportunity to put you out and out you
go. The benefit of the country is a secondary
matter. The billets are what we are after.”

•State,
and Britain found
out almost imme-
diately that the
border was wrongly
located, and shifted
it so that the Diamond
Fields were on her side.
Gold was found in the
Transvaal, and Britain has
already ascertained to her
own satisfaction that the
Transvaal is properly British
territory. The only lich
foreign goldfields found in
recent years which Britain
hasn’t suddenly discovered,
to her own great surprise, to
be really on her territory were in Siberia. Russia
is too large and fierce to stand any sudden dis-
coveries of that sort.
Those who opposed an Australian Final
Court of Appeal and insisted, upon the retention
of the right to go all the way to the British Privy
Council are reminded that Vic. ex-Attorney-
Genoral Isaacs receives £3,500 from Melb. Tram-
way Co. for appearing on its behalf in its munici-
pal-rating case before the London Tribunal.
Premier Dawson’s Queensland Ministry,
which only lasted one day from the time when it
formally took office, was the shortest-lived Aus-
tralasian Cabinet up to then, though it had some
very close competitors. Atkinson ran a six-day
Ministry in Maoriland and John Baker’s solitary
Premiership in S.A. lasted 11 days. The mean
Fat Man party in Queensland alleged that
Dawson formed his hopeless Ministry merely in
order that his party might have the run of the
Ministerial papers for a few hours, and dig out
unpleasant facts about their opponents. By way
of refuting this shabby little slander not one of
the members of the one-day Government went
near his Ministerial office. But evidently the
Dickson party knew’ there was something awful
awaiting discovery in these Ministerial pigeon-
holes.
The whirligig of time 1 A while ago John
Gordon threatened to stump S.A. against the
Kingston Govt, and its Household Suffrage policy,
and he practioally led the Tory Opposition in the
Council during the now-expiring session. And
now Gordon has joined Holder, Kingston’s chief
colleague, and will have to pilot some measure of
Council reform through the Tory Hoyse. No
Govt., as S.A. politics are now, can neglect Coun-
cil reform and live, as Solomon quickly found out.
After the attitude assumed by John Bull
at the Peace Conference in refusing to abandon
the Dum-dum bullet, the righteous indignation
displayed by the British commanders because the
Boers make occasional use of that destructive slug
is rather edifying.
The Duni-duui’s fair, as I can show,
For me to fire upon my foe ;
But for my foe to fire at me
The Dum-dum’s sheer barbaritee.
Some Australian apologists of the Trans-
vaal war say what very few Englishmen have the
cheek to say—that the Transvaal began it, and
Britain is fighting in self-defence ! The Trans-
vaal saw Britain hurrying to its frontiers an armed
force far exceeding the whole adult male popula-
tion of Transvaalers, and had the sense to strike
while there was a chance that its little blow would
be effective. Freebooting Britain put a gun to the
head of the little Republic, and the Republic said
“Drop that gun ; or we’ll pick up ours.”
The demand for political equality as a
justification of the Boer butchery comes strangely
from the smug and self-complacent kind of people
who make it. However profound their admira-
tion for political equality when applied to other
people, they have no more conception of it for
themselves than has a footman. They are the
same “right-thinking” persons who are too
pompous and arrogant to grant political equality
to those poorer than themselves and too servile to
ask it from the lordling who legislates for them
by “ hereditary right.”
He the British position in the present war.
After the raid, Dr. Jameson was indicted in
England under the Foreign Enlistment Act, which
Act deals only with hostile acts against foreign
friendly powers. The Transvaal is thus shown by
the action of the highest British legal officials to
be an independent State. If the Transvaal is
under British suzerainty, Jameson should have
been tried for treason. The British Cabinet has
either changed front in this matter, or it allowed a
gross abuse of justice to be perpetratod, owing to
sympathy with the robbers.
N.S.W. Postmaster-General Crick pro-
poses to charge postage on local newspapers,
which have hitherto been carried free, at a cost to
the Treasury of between .£40,000 and £60,000 a
year. The Sydney daily .and weekly press howls
in chorus against the innovation, on the ground
that the Press is a “great educator.” So it is—it
educates N.S.W. Parliament not to grant abso-
lutely free education to the children of the elec-
tors, on the ground that “ the State finances
cannot afford it.” But the State finances can
afford free newspaper-postage !
DRUNK AND DRUNKER.
THE LOCAL PRESS: “We are ready to send more
cavalry, and, if n[?]cessary, another contingent.”
MR. AUSTRALIA (already drunk): “Eerfillem-
upayin!”
Adelaide Critic on ex-Premier Kingston
in the day of Solomon the Sudden’s brief eleva-
tion :
He now, doubtless, regrets that he nailed those House-
hold Suffrage colors $o securely to the mast, for, until
they can be hauled down, he must stifle his Federal
ambitions, and must relinquish all hope of realising the
impossible prophecy of the usually ill-informed Bulletin
that he will be the first Premier of United Australia.
The constantly-misinformed Critic is hereby in-
formed that this paper never prophesied that
Kingston would be first Federal Premier. It
recommended him, and still recommends him, for
the billet, but it didn’t mistake the Common-
wealth for a horse-race or a dog-fight, and start
tipping the winner. Curiously enough, when
The Bulletin recommended certain men as
fitting members of the Federal Convention, and
they didn’t get in, the horse-papers rose in just
the same fashion to say that its “ tip ” had gone
wrong. The constant sordid struggle to spot the
winner makes all the world a tip.
MORE KIPLING.
PERTINACIOUS HANGER-ON: “I wouldn't come to
yer so often, sir, if I didn’ know yer was a
real ’white’ man.”
THE PREYED-UPON : “ Don't know about that—
but it seems to me that, with a host of chaps
like you, I’ve got the White Man’s Burden
all right!”
This is the fearfully and wonderfully un-
grammatical motion on which Allan M'Lean
ejected Turner from the Vic. Premiership :
That this House no longer retains confidence in the
Government, because of its administrative weakness and
of its vacillating conduct of public business, culminating
in having voted for the imprisonment of a man after hav-
ing declared that his offence was not proved, and advised
the House to proceed no further with his proposed pun-
ishment.
When a man of no great literary attainments puts
54 words in one sentence the result is usually
much the same as if he put 54 live cats in one
crate.
No political curse ever came home to
roost more suddenly than that of the Transvaal
Contingents. Reid went down as soon as he
started to advocate that infamy. The day Brad-
don introduced the proposal for sending the Tas-
manian contingent was his last day in office.
Dickson, Kingston, and Turner all fell within
two months after their respective squads of mer-
cenaries started. The curse that fell on Jonah,'s
gourd was a tortoise or a tired-out funeral com-
pared with the Transvaal Contingent Curse.
Sydney Telegraph tries to prove that, it is really
a belated Federation curse, but that theory is too
thin.
Ex-Premier Reid’s efforts to squelch the
N.S.W. Early-Closing Bill have not helped him
with the Labor-party, and his efforts to induce
ie Upper House to reject it did the Bill more
good than harm. The attitude of Backhouse,
M.L.C., towards said Bill is most significant
when it is remembered that that oily and plausible
old gentleman is one of Reid’s most servile fol-
lowers. Mr. Backhouse until, recently moaned
for the “ poor creatures ” who slave in shops, and
cried aloud in his grief for an Early-Closing Bill,
but immediately it came along he absented him-
self from the Council, and didn’t give it a lift on
a single division.
The Bulletin wonders what the Western
shearers think of Mr. Richard Sleath’s approval of
the Australian-Contingent Boer-butchery busi-
ness, seeing that a similar lust for blood and
“ glory ” actuated those New England Mounted
Rifles who offered their services to Queensland
Government during the last shearers’-strike? The
class by which the present tyrannous and dis-
graceful act has been chiefly engineered, bar-
racked for and subscribed to, is the class which
provided the haw-haw “special constables ” who,
during the great Labor troubles of a few years
a go, were so eager to ride down and run-in the re-
calcitrant workmen.
Westralian Speaker James Lee-Steere
tells a new Federation fish-yarn to the rustics of
Bridgetown :
There was no national feeling in the other colonies
about Federation and of making us one nation. That
was the greatest humbug. All that those people wanted
was to have free ports in Westralia to bring their goods
to and so reduce the prices which are being obtained by
the people producing in Westralia.
The rustics, of course, believed it, and saw noth-
ing strange in the yarn that nearly four million
people had conspired solely to: sell goods to
170,000, so as to reduce the prices obtained by the
few hundred farmers in Westralia.
Sydney Telegraph has been going it
strong of late on an alleged ’orrible defect in the
Commonwealth Bill inasmuch as it doesn’t pro-
hibit a politician being a member of the Federal
and State Legislatures simultaneously. And if
the Bill contained that prohibition the penny
parochial wrecker would go it just as strongly
concerning the “ interference with the liberty of
the States,” about being “deprived of the free-
dom for which our forefathers fought and bled,”
about the necessity for “ rising up to defend the
right of free election against the tyranny of the
Common wealth,” and similar loose and general
flappings of the promiscuous flag of eloquence.
' What more telling
evidence of the un-
righteousness of
Bull’s South Africa
grab is needed than
the efforts of John’s
tame bards to glorify
his actions and hymn
him as a godly soul
spitting Boers for the
sake of freedom and
light and holiness 1
All lift up their
voices and sing, sing
with such tremen-
dous effort that, be-
tween the lines, one
sees their faces pur-
pling, and the blue
veins swelling dread-
fully in their necks;
but never a man of them
raps out a tune that
rings true. Even Kip-
ling, born and bred, and
fed up to rattle forth
good, ringing stuff (the
battle-cry of the hour
at a time like this) fails
dismally, miserably, in his
effort to convince others that
he himself is convinced.
He has often been false
and over-strained, but
never so artificial as now
when struggling to realise
his destiny. Your poet
is a shocking liar—never
a graceless Fatman but can be at
him at that.
The Ministry of Sudden Solomon included
one item in its policy which made its funeral cer-
tain and immediate. For years S. A. Upper
House has been consistently throwing- out liberal
measures, despite growing majorities in the popu-
lar Chamber. Three years ago Kingston proposed
to reform the Fatrnan’s House by liberalising the
franchise, and twice his Household Suffrage Bill
passed S.A. Assembly. Moreover, at last elec-
tion the electors voted for Household Suffrage by
a large majority ; surely an effective indication
of the feeling of the people. Yet the Solomon
crowd proposed, on top of all this, to “reform”
the Council merely by extending the franchise to
the wives of present Council voters, estimated to
be some 30,000. Then it took just about ten
minutes to aim the Solomon crowd and its
measures and belongings on to the footpath.
Cabled that the brilliant and sympathetic
editor Massingham, of London Daily Chronicle,
has resigned, owing to a difference, with that
paper’s proprietors as to its attitude concerning
the Transvaal war. The Chronicle, especially
remembered in Australia as the journal which so
strenuously advocated the dockers’ cause in the
big strike, has been by far the most democratic of
London dadies. It is owned by the Lloyds,
also proprietors of Lloyd’s Weekly News-
paper, which claims a circulation of over
a million a week, and is smugly run on the
principle of “right-thinkingness,” tempered by
police-court and divorce-news. It takes more
nerve and enthusiasm to fight a real battle against
the arrayed forces of Money and Military Caste
than are possessed by the ordinary gilded, well-
curled young man who has succeeded to the
possession of a newspaper built up by his stern
and grizzly old father.
A feature of the no-confidence motion in
Vic. Assembly was the manner' in which foxy
Craves watched Minister Best. Best was the only
Minister who did not take a hand in the debate.
The reason for his silence, so it is said, was that
Graves had for weeks been collecting information
re the retention of Best’s father in the Customs
department after age of retirement. When this
matter was referred to by Graves previously Best
made a show of himself on the floor of the House.
He paraded his tears and worked a tremor into his
voice, the while he declared he had nothing to do
with the favors extended to his aged father. He
made a number of statements which Craves took
the opportunity of investigating, and the old fox
now says that in the course of these inquiries he
discovered quite a number of other favors which
Best, as Minister, had tacitly permitted his old
man ’ to enjoy. These formed the subject of a
long complaint to Premier Turner who, knowing
that Graves had this up his sleeve, prevailed on
Best to lie low.
The Jingo gang are getting some hard
knocks re Boer “brutalities.” Cabled a few
weeks back that the Boers cold-bloodedly
massacred a number of defenceless town guards at
Dundee. The wire was put under scare headings
in the, most prominent part of all the “great
dailies,” and their readers were urgently implored
to yell for more blood. As usual, the true account
of the incident, which came forward per mail, told
quite another story, and was reluctantly printed
in obscure corners of a few of the aforementioned
papers:
The facts of the alleged Boer massacre at Dundee
appear to be that a portion of the town guard, although,
fairly warned by General Yule before his retirement,
continued to carry arms, and 30 of them were shot before
the Boers discovered who they were.
As regards the bombardment of a defenceless
town, it must be remembered that the Boers on the
surrounding hills didn’t know Yule had abandoned
it. In the ordinary course of things Yule might
have given notice to Joubert that he was leaving
his wounded at Dundee in the hands of the Boers.
He didn’t, simply because he was in a tight place
and had to escape secretly. He didn’t even leave
an officer behind to surrender the town. It was
just because Yule’s night retreat was a success
that the Boers assaulted the defenceless town next
day. They thought he was still there.

The Melb. bank-clerks’ protest against the
extension of the Factories Act was, it seems,
really clue to the pressure of the higher authorities
ratiier than to the innate snobbishness, of the
rank-and-file. The very 'protest protested too
much—the firstclause showed the guilty mind by
asserting that the banks themselves had nothing
whatever to do with the movement, and that it
had emanated solely from the employes them-
selves. The same obvious flam was - circulated
when the whole of Melbourne’s bank-clerks mani-
fested a sudden craving for electors’-rights a few
years ago.
The reverend editor of the West Australian
Ciil'iteii \'K\vs in a recent issue of tiiat journal
gently chides a certain clergyman for having,
while addressing the last synod, “ preached a ser-
mon advocating the use of the Revised Version,”
and also bludgeons the rev. enemy with the fol-
lowing astonishing allegation
In addition to this he addressed n letter to a leading 1
paper, sending it under a e«ni </e /./unis commending
hiinself(l) for his action and statingliis reasoiisat. length,
and next day published a letter over his own signature,
thanking the previous writer for supporting Mr. !
The holy and reverend editor aforesaid, it appears
from tlm imprint of the paper, is one Garland,
who is identical with the Diocesan Secretary, and
in another portion of the paper appears the fol-
lowing :
The Diocesan Secretary is an example of lucidity in
Introducing the Council's Hills, and is to be congratulated
on the expeditious .wav in which they were carried
through their various stages.
It must be— there is no other explanation—that
the rev. editor is moved by the precedent of
putting down the mighty and exalting the humble
tod meek.

day ?
During a recent visit to Mooroopna, Vic.,
(Gov. lira.s.sey preached a Sabbath sermon to the
unhappy people--his “last public utterance in
Victoria.’’ It was a long, dull, dreadful discouse,
full of the “ Berlessedness ’’ and the Wrath, and
it cast a gloom over Mooroopna. that has not
entirely lifted after many days. Those who have
witnessed the tortuous Brassev biting and chew-
ing a little secular speech under the inspiring
influence of champagneand pudding (his Ex. is a
whale for pudding), will appreciate the linked
misery long drawn out of Uncle Tom’s sacerdotal
address. “Dear brethren,” wailed the noble
evangelist—
We have met, as those early followers of the Divine
Founder of our religion met, to receive I lie Word by the
wayside, hy the shore of the lake, in the lonely places of
the hills, and in the'sequestered valley.
That was tenthly, and late in the day. This was
seventeeuthly and lastly, clearly beloved-
bet us try to lead a religions life, and that life should
chiefly consist in the love of one another, in the spirit of
self-sacrifice, and in the temper of charity.
And then H, E. gave out a hymn beginning—
“ Teach me to feel another's woe.”
It was sung with a passion of enthusiasm never
before equalled in Mooroopna, where it is believed
that, if there is any efficacy in hymns, Brassey will
have a turbulent sea-sickness all the way from
Sandridge to Portsmouth.

Medical
Good Things.
The Christmas issue of The Bulletin is good.
Likewise, good is MINERYA TONIC. The first
aims at instruction and amusement. The second
will assuredly rebuild your wasted constitution,
and prolong your life.
MINERVA TONIC is a phosphorised iron
syrup combined with certain rare restoratives.
It will promote sleep, create a good appetite,
provide energy, and bring back health and con-
fidence.
MINERVA TONIC is cordially recommended
by Mr. Luckham, Bulletin office, as well as
by thousands of men and women in the leading
business and social circles of the country.
As a Tonic, it is absolutely unique, and, as
a result, the testimonials given in its favor are
unique also. The British Lancet, the greatest
medical authority in the world, openly ap-
proves of MINERVA, and thereby recommends
it.
On sale by all chemists throughout Aus-
tralia.*

Hori Grey had a deep-rooted idea that
artistic woodwork of Maoriland timber would
enormously appreciate in value. On one occasion
he remarked that in 30 years there would be no
more kauri, while the most-prized variety, known
as “mottled kauri,” was even then almost extinct.
“You mark my words,” ho continued, “before
you are an old man anything good with mottled
kauri in it will be worth far more than its weight
in silver.”

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little’ matters attended to. If you have along thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

Our Fathers Did So !
(A STUDY IN HEREDITY.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whenever you’re tempted to make a wee slip,
Whenever you threaten to tremble and trip,
Whenever you step from the path that is straight,
Whenever your morals are loose in their gait,
It falls on your soul like a blessing of balm
This dictum of sages benignant and calm
“Be comforted, mortals, both lofty and low,
It isn’t your fault—for your fathers did so 1 ”
Philosopher Quack is at work with a will
Compounding narcotics in bolus and pill;
He tells us “That nonsense of ‘shouldn’t’ and
‘ should ’
Is clean out of date and abolished for good ; ”
He says that our feet are afoul in the snare
Which certain primeval old heathens put there;
That we’re booked for a tumble wherever we go
By the fact we deplore—that our fathers did so !
0 love that we slew with a kiss that was cold ;
O widows and orphans we gulled of their gold ;
O enemy true that we stabbed in the back ;
O comrade we left on a waterless track ;
O girls that have wept at our breaking of vows ;
O friend that we tricked of his purse and his
spouse:
How can you complain of us now—when you know
We can't be to blame —for our fathers did so !
And this shall we plead in the Day of the Doom,
When called by the trump from the grave and its
gloom :
“ Our burden paternal was grievous to bear,
The sins that we sinned were a fam’ly affair ;
We wanted to rise ; but our reprobate sire
He couldn't be crushed and he wouldn’t aspire : ”
Can juries angelic condemn us—o, no !
Not guilty, we plead—for our fathers did so.

P. LUFTIG.
The late Austrian Empress was possibly
the only woman that ever held Heine’s writings
in highest esteem. His statue adorns a little
temple at her classic retreat in Corfu, and the
Empress never failed, when in Paris, to visit his
grave at Montmartre.
St. James’ Budget (London) announces
that the Transvaal and Orange Free State are to be
turned into self-governing British colonies when
the war is over. When Britain seized the Trans-
vaal in ’77 the same promise was made, and the
Boers, to some extent, acquiesced in the annexa-
tion on the assurance that they would have the
same powers of local government as Natal, Cape
Colony and the Australian provinces. If the
promise hadn’t been broken and the Transvaal
run as a military autocracy, Britain might have
been in peaceful possession to this day. Probably,
however, the promise will be kept this time. Self-
government now means handing over the power
to the British settlers, which is quite a different
thing.
Artless little incident in a London police-
court, by a girl, charged, in company with a man,
with “ drunkan’sorderly ” :
“It was like this, your Honor. I come up here yester-
day to see some friends, and, as I was a-goin’ ’ome this
morning, I feels cold, so I sez ‘ I’ll have a drop o’ rum ;
it’ll do me good.’ So I goes into a pub., and then who
should come in but this gentleman. He treats a lot o’
cabmen, and then he sez to me, he sez ‘ What’ll you
’ave?’ ‘ Rum,’ sez I, and rum it was. Then I’appened
to say as I was an Irish girl. ‘ Oh,’ sez he, ‘ I do love
Irish girls,’ and with that he starts kissing and cuddling
me. An’, o’ course, I kissed ’im back, and then we 'ad
some more rum and some more kisses. Then we went
out, and ’e put ’is arms round my neck and kissed me,
and I did the same to ’im, and then that p’leceman came
up, an’ ’e sez, ‘ ’Ere, you two lovebirds, move on ! ’ ”
The ingenuous damsel was discharged.

S.A. politics, after being in a state of chaos
for a week, during which two Ministries went
bung, are now about as usual as they usually are.
Holder's Ministry contains, in the persons of him-
self, O’Loughlin and Jenkins, half of the expired
Kingston Govt., and Gordon, the new Attorney-
General, was a former member of the same com-
bination. Foster, the new Works Commissioner,,
has consistently followed Kingston for years.
Labor-leader Batchelor's accession to office brings
about the coalition of the Liberal and Labor
forces. The Holder Govt, is expected to go for a
Council franchise of .£l5, as a compromise between
the Kingston policy of Household Suffrage and
Sudden Solomon’s cheeky Tory proposal of
extending the present franchise (.£2O) to the wives
of present voters. Kingston is standing down,
from Ministerial life for private business reasons.

While stories of Boer cowardice are being
so assiduously circulated, it is interesting to read
remarks such as these from the (Tory) London
Standard, in speaking of the Afridi campaign :
“ Letters from India are full of admiration of the gal-
lantry of the Gordons, Goorkhas, and Sikhs, but they
also state that the rank and file of at least four British
regiments showed a want of ‘ten’ and pluek, which
rendered them all but useless. The worst of it is (hat
the native troops have seen (he weakness and cowardice
of their white comrades, and they state openly that, if
any ‘Tommy’ is rude to them in future, they will
hammer him. And the awful thing is that they can !”
“ Honor certificates ” have been awarded
in connection with the “Circular Quay disaster,”
wherein, as will be remembered, a crowd of
Sydney Sunday'-school children, when landing
from a steamer, were thrown into the water
through the collapse of a gangway. “ Conspicuous
bravery,” certificates 17 ; “ Bravery,” 11 ; “Ser-
vices rendered,’’ 12 And all over a matter in
which the only essential to distinction was the
ability to do a little swimming without the dis-
robeinent, for which there was no time. The
whole system is rotten, and such eagerness to
confer some kind of label upon anything that can
possibly be construed into courage gives extra
pjint to the words of “Old Jack,” who sighs, as
under, for the “ brave days of old ” :
In a file of London Times, 1802-4, w hich 1 have by me I
find frequent references to gallant deeds on the part of
British sailors and soldiers, hut set forth in brief matter-
of-fact fashion, without comment or flourish of any kind
about the special valour of the act. Not so nowadays.
F’rins‘ance, a 14-year-old bugler shoots three Boers to hi*
own cheek. There you have it.!—the racial valour even
in the babes and sucklings ! And yet I do remember in
mine own experience that when 50 years ago—the
Moander was cruising in the South Pacific, a topman fell
into the sea—haif-a gale blowing and dark as a dungeon.
Instantly a middy (we had middies then, not miniature
johnnies) jumped over, followed bv the master, and he
again by a seaman of the watch. When the boats that
went after them returned, they brought only the man
who had fallen overheard. All his would-he rescuers had
“ lost the number of their mess.” Now, here was no
battle enthusiasm—no-roar of combat to fire the blood.
It was just a piece of cold, solid courage—which never-
theless, in the captain’s report, was disposed of inside a
dozen lines. ,Seems to me we are becoming too Frenchi-
fied—too fond of strutting and swaggering before the
world —when any ordinary act of intrepidity is thought
worth half a-column of newspaper fustian.
“ Long-’Un ” sends something about a
man .with an individuality :
Dear Billetin'.—About the leading farmer in S.A. (if
not in Australia) is M’Kenzie, “ the Iron Man,” of Dental
Bay, West Coast. Has Sent) acres of cleared mallee and
ti-tree under crop. Besides white labor, used to employ
ion niggers and gins ; natives were bossed by a full-
blood and a half-caste, who received 6s. an acre for
land cleared. The two bosses kept the crowd in rations
and 'baeea, and waxed exceeding fat and affluent them-
selves, driving about the country with a Hash buggy and
pair and ordering their stores with the air of million-
aires. Writer has seen as many as 14 strippers at work
in one paddock, arid >lac. used to do a good deal of the
ploughing on his own ; so that no time need be wasted,
would fix a couple of two-furrow ploughs together and
get over the ground in style. After ordinary wo king
hours he d pass away the time sinking tanks alongside the
tracks; and whilst a couple of laborers perspired pro-
fusely mixing concrete and cement, Mac. would lay it in
and on with a shovel. Conserved Suo.OOOgals. this way.
The “ Iron Man ” used to say that the man w ho couldn’t
do on four hours’ sleep was no good, although he him-
self was by no means a hard master ; also, he was
most hospitable, and any passing “drummer” could
always get a feed, and the offer of a job at 4.T
a-week and tucker, if lie cared to stay. A most slip-shod
man, Mac. ; clothed in the same old Yankee hat, unhut-
toned Crimean shin, displaying a wealth of hairy chest;
concertina’d moles, and never known to have his boots
laced. Fences consist of one barbed wire and netting
hitched to thin pickets or to any handy malice, regardless
of direction. Says it’s easily shitted next .season, if he
wants to rest that particular paddock. Mac. had a fairly
high two-roomed stone building at .first; within six
months leans-to hail been added for a depth of 30yds.
Last addition was only 3ft. high, ground being excavated
to give the hands a show to get about somehow. Then
started again in front, and added a dining-room and
kitchen combined, with one long table capable’of seating
40 men. Nearly all the surrounding cookies owe it to
Mac. that they are kept, from starvation—motley, imple-
ments, &c., lent right and left, and all on a two-bushel
harvest. Another season or two like the last three will
see the end of the “ Iron Man ” on the West Coast, then
—God help his neighbors !
Parkes was once asked which was the
most dramatic moment in liis career. “It has
been all dramatic,” lie said ; and tie was not far
wrong. But perhaps the most remarkable incident
was the scene at the declaration of the poll for E.
Maitland in 18(j.’5, when Darvall (Attorney-Gen-
eral) defeated him. On Parkes’ return from
England, which he had visited as Immigration
Agent and Lecturer, Darvall, among other acts of
kindness, urged Parkes to read for the bar, and
offered him the valuable privilege of reading in his
(Darvall’s) chambers. Parkes did not take ad-
vantage of the offer, but showed his appreciation
of it by opposing Darvall at the next election.
Darvall then made his famous denunciation of
Parkes. Speaking from the hustings, and turning
up his coat-cuffs, he remarked that he had a most
unpleasant duty to perform, in “ the dissection of
a scoundrel ! ” Also Parkes, whose insolvency
over The Empire had ruined many, was challenged
from the crowd as to the disposal of a certain pro-
missory note. His response to this attack led to
the dramatic moment. “ What about Dean ? ” (an
unsatisfied creditor) was asked. Parkes became
furious. He declared he had never drawn more
from The Empire than would keep his family.
“ And out of that I paid .£l2 per month to Mr.
Dean.” Then lie sneered at the people who criti-
cised him. “ I have done good beyond them to
do, and 1 have labored for them when they iiad
neither intelligence enough nor courage enough to
labor for themselves. The political power they
have I gave them, and they are the vilest of the
vile thus to upbraid me for misfortunes which have
come upon me through my exertions in their
behalf.” The storm increased, but Parkes laid
it by a remarkable utterance. “ Elsewhere and
in other days a m m who failed to pay his debts
was stoned to death. If those present believe
that I have not made every effort to meet my
debts, then let them—let them stone me to death.
But they dare not do it, for there is no man
among them who would notin that case know that
he ought himself to be battered to death.” The
crowd was smitten into silenee. Parkes, in after
years, admitted his Darvall-opposition was one of
his great blunders.

The S. A.-N.S. W. cricket trouble has been set-
tled, and the match between the two provinces will begin
at Adelaide to-dav. Terms provide that one-third of
neit proceeds for the season shall he given and received.
S.A. came down ; previously one-third of cross takings
was asked for. Mother province’s cricketilie people aver
that instead of losing on the previous arrangement S.A.
gained an average of over JLIoO yearly after meetinir all
demands in connection with ' Svdney and Adelaide
matches. Season ’94-’95 saw S.A. scoop £lO7 and N.S.\V.
lose £27 on the two contests. N.S. W. lost £l4l and S.A.
only £8 in ’97-'9B.
* • • •
Victoria will take a lot of beating in cricket
this season, despite the fact that N’.S.W. is so strong on
Eaper. V'ith a weak team, minus Worrall, Laver,
I‘Leod and Johns, Vic. simply played wilh S.A. Jones,
central bowline figure of the last Australian Eleven, was
pounded all over the ground. Jonah has lost much of
his pace, explained, perhaps, by the fact that he is no
longer working on Adelaide Oval. S.A.C.A. simply
“retains" him at £2 10s. a week, and Jonah is a gentle-
man. He is a stone overweight, and needs a month of
solid hard work to put him in form.
Graham lias appeared on the cricket horizon
again, his lIS against S.A. being in his old style. Trem-
ble lias come back from Englaud a better batsman than
ever.
Victoria has unearthed two rattling juniors in
Armstrong, a sturdy college lad who hits like a master,
and Collins, who promises to be a first-rate bowler. In
his maiden effort he secured Lyons, Darling, and Hill for
80 runs.
S.A. is hard-up for bowlers, and her best work
against Victoria was done by Giffen, the despised. Hack,
who was tried with success last year, but nearly went
out this year owing to cluh failures, made 115 by the
best innings of the match. Darling's 14 in two innings
and Hill s partial failure explain S.A.’s easy defeat.
Some talk in Adelaide, as a result of S.A.’s
licking from Victoria, of importing a first-class pro.
bowjpr from England. Years ago S.A. depended upon
Gitfen and latterly upon Jones, but a junior bowler to
take their places or assist them is sighed for in vain.

Trumper is becoming quite handy with the
ball. Playing at Arntidale with X.S.W. v. New England
he took 9 wickets for 27 runs, as against Nohlt s 5
wickets for 82 runs. Playing against. Glebe last Saturday
Trumper took 4 wickets for 30, and Noble 5 wickets for
19. Trumper is a better bowler than he gets credit for.
As a schoolboy he was simply irresistible, but his good'
work with the bat no doubt caused him to neglect the
other department of the game.

Worrall has started a cricket-shop in Melb.
He seems inclined to despair of his injured, knee ever
getting well. Massage night, and morn, bandages and
plaster, were his accompaniments throughout the tour.
Joe D irling fie ded him invariably at short leg, with the
best of intentions and the worst of results, as Worrall 1
tbusrhail the whole of the running on the leg side. For
the last month or so Jack never stirred from his couch of
an evening after arriving home from the match. During
thy last te-t match no less than seven of the team under-
went massage- a veritable team of cripples.

The Marylebnne Cluh potentates are making at
fussy attempt to frame further rules interdi d to bring
cricket, m dehos to finality in three days without any
alteration in the size of the wicket. This is mere tinker-
ing with the public grievance. The one thing needed! ter
wake up cricket slid get the game over more quickly is- ai
bigger mark for the attack. If the stumps were cut
longer and th ■ iee, so as to allow of the wicket being-
broadened without leaving room for the hall to pass;
between the stick-, the howlers would make shorter work
of an innings and the hatting would be forced into new
aggressiveness. But inasmuch as the Australians, are
strongest in-bowling, the Marvlebone rule-makers funk
the idea of giving them something more to bowl at.

1 In till games of sport the safe, heady player,
comes out ahead of the brilliant “ gallery ” performer.
The victory of Kearney in the Single Tennis Champion T
ship of Victoria is another instance of this. The averggtev
tennis-player seems to think that all that is needed t> t©
get the bail over the net in a stylish manner and cl is nee
where it goes, but Kearney wins -his games by never
sacrificing safety for style. He never “smashes” unless
he gets a “ can't-miss-it ” chance, tosses e\ eryt hing he is
not sure of, and by his excellent placing knocks np and
beats better men. The only recent -date player who-
would have a chance with Kearney is ex-champion Curtis:
who is both brilliant and safe.

Second day (Saturday) of big cycling meeting im
Melbourne saw a record gathering of spectators. Austral!
Wheel Race heats were run off amid intense excitement.
—the crowd fairly screeched again. Pltigger Martin tried!
to force an opening inside in his heat, and got hopelessly
mixed just when things looked rosy. The little mistake
cost “ Bill ' a soy. for careless riding. Cochrane got home:
jn great style, as did Prowse. Boj h look like being placed!
in. the final. The riding of Mutton (Bathurst, N.S.VV.)
was sensational. Sprinting often, and in great form, he:
had the Crowd cheering 'wildly time after time. Parsons:
and Italian Boidi (two hot-pots) went under. Hickey
(2duyds.) has the fastest time (4mift. 38}»ec.) opposite his
name, and Thorn (20f>vds.) the slowest (4.58). Fourteen
heats averaged about 13 starters. Winners were Brooker

champ (150), Leslie (220), Cochrane (110), Mutton (20),.
F. S, H auchamp (scratch), Thorn (200), Hickey (200),.

and is a fine upstanding brown filly of about 16 hinds.
Bought. as a yearlinjr for 20 guineas, Nenagh has so far

weight ever carried first past the post by an Australian

Major George got in an awful rage with the
Maoriland “ ring” in the early ’Bo’s, because it would not
lay him what he considered a fair price about his horses,
and because it generally punched him for what it'did lay
him. owing to the wretchedness of his cattle. Then he
bought the colt by King Cole—My Idea, and named him
after himself—Nelson. He had sworn vindictively for
years that he d hreak the M.L. ring sonie day, and at last,
with the big, noble-looking chestnut, he did it so com-
pletely that several well-up members were flattened com-
pletely out—some even “ guyed-a-whack ” to Australia,
and have never got up again. That, was about 13 years
ago, anti now he has almost, repeated the dose with Sea-
horse, sired by the famous Nelson. Major Horatio
Nelson George is a far from popular owner, but he is
about as happy a one just, now as is to be found. Apropos
Maoriland scribes always write of the Ma or’s home as
naipiti, which would mean “ water’’-something in Maori
Actually it is named after his horse Wapiti, and his name
was the Iroquois designation of the American elk.

Died lately at Longford (Tas.) William Drown
(commonly known as “ Bully ”), who has been racing for
over -to years in Australia. His horses always ran better
after he parted with them, as, through feeding them on
the quiet, they were always nmd-fat. Brown had a great
command of “language,” distributed as freely in public
as elsewhere. The writer remembers a horse of his win-
ning a ,tTOO selling-race at Launceston, hut upon the
winner being “put tip” no hid was forthcoming, where-
upon Bully roared from the stand, “You s', -five

Sculler Bubear, well known in Australia, got
three months in England recently, for a not at all
ingenious attempt to cheat lkev Mo, bv means of belting
telegrams sent after the race. 'A little while ago a clever
cronkslermade money by the use of temporaril v invisible
ink. Irt Cockney belting-shops it is the practice for the
backer to write down his fancies and hand them over the
counter, with the necessary stake. These scraps of paper
are kept in the drawer until evening, when bookie pays
•out with respect, to all the winners whose names are in
the drawer. The chevalier d’ Industrie who made the
coup simply wrote in ordinary ink the name of a com-
petitor in one of the later races of the day, but in the
trick-ink scribbled the names of the winners of some of
the races which had already come off. In an
hour or two the “invisible” ink became visible
:and the cronkster called and got his illicit pro-
fits. He must have made thousands before the game
whs detected. Another ingenious turf-swihdle, also
English, which got, into the law-courts, was worked at Hie
b.iuing-clubs, where “sports ' - meet, and the telegraph-
tape shows half-hourly the names of the starters and
placed horses in every important race run throughout
the country. First, the starters are received and betting
proceeds, until the instrument clicks out, the result. The
swindlers arranged with a telegraph-operator to delay
the sending of the list, of starters until he knew the
result, the starters’names eventually being so arranged
that the result would be privately known to the fraurtu-
lent backers in the club, and the metallicians so became
an easy prey.

The news that whilom famous sculler Wallace
Ross has died of paralysis touched the springs of
reminiscence. Ross was a sailor and a fl-herinan, and
next a sculler. He won his first race 26 years'ag'o J then
came a big list of triumphs. Haitian jumped Tntofame
by beating him in 77. ana repeating the performance
later. Hop Bitters’ prize, at Providence (U.S.A.), was
Ross s biggest achie.vement—Ned Trickett (N.S.W ) and
Gaudatir (now world’s champion) finished behind. Nov.
same year ( 80), Hop Bitters Co. came with bigger money
for a race in London, which “Australian Bushman”
Litas Laycock (now boatshed-ow net - and fisherman at, Port
Hacking, N.S.W.) appropriated, Ross being second. Sub-
sequently, Ross bested Ned T.ickett (N S.W.) in a match.
Six years passed, and Beach accounted for the New
Brunswieker over the Thames (London) course, for £lOOO
in stake-money. Ross pulled out of the game tvvo or
three years afterwards, .having meanwhile beaten Bubear
for English championship and i4ou. Ross was only 42 at
•death.

Domain Baths (Sydney) on Saturday. A big “ field ”of
12 started, but “Mu 1" Bishop (champion sprinter),
Martin, Roberts, O’Urady, . Proud foot, Kearnev and
others gave up at various stages. Bond led at 3(Wds
by 2ft. and gradually went away till, at one time there
was a margin of 12yds. between him and the ultimate
second man, Craig, hut ere finishing, latter reduced the
difference to six. Smith was Byds. further off, third,

Otto Cribb, of w.hbm.The- Bulletin prints a
picture this week, ha-s literally pounded his wav into
prominence. He belongs- to the aggr, ssive geld here •
somehow order of bruiser. M.L. courser and metallician
Martin Taylor brought him over to Sydney looking for
bln anywhere, anyhow and with anyone. L i<* hi weight.
VValiy Weeks and middleweight champion Mick Dunn
tried-out Otto one after the other. L. Foley, looking on,
said, “ that cove’s a fighter to the core, take it from me."
The retired champion meant a lighter as distinguished
from a boxer. Gymnasia turn the latter article out in
great numbers, but nature alone makes tbe former and
there are very few about. Cribb strips at 10.9 usually,
but, if required, could shape up strong with the odd
poundage off. He has his own methods —crude to an
extent but effective ; insensibility to punishment and the
power to deal it out heavily being the most potent
factors. Extraordinary strength for his weight, a vice-
Jike grip, hands almost as big as hams, and youth (be is
in his 21st year) complete the kit of this latest fistic
phenomenon. He expends little energy uselessly. Moves
about ordinarily as if loth to make the slightest unneces-
sary effort and acts similarly in response to the calls of
“ time ”or “corners.” Four tare-knuckle affairs in M.L,
and nine glove-battles in Sydney (all victories) constitute
his record so far. He is now engaged to meet black Ike
Stewart, and, a fortnight later, Harry Dawson with Ned
Burden, Jack Conlon, and probably Mick Dunn to follow
at. intervals of two weeks if the others are agreeable.
Cribb backs himself, and as all his opponents thought
they had a soft thing and planked down their coin ac-
cordingly, his banking account should be worth having.
Middleweight champion pug of Australia, Tim
Murphy —ill-conditioned through short nolice(two weeks)
—put VVestralian Jack Dunne out in the ninth round at
Broken Hill (N.S.VV.) Saturday night. Wire says Dunne
had the better of matters up to the punch on the “ point.”
Doubt less Tim, knowing how poorly-prepared he was,
husbanded his strength and waited for that opening
which came at last. Given Murphy fit and well Dunne
would soon be “ cold-pie” for him.

The “ Cocker ” Twepdie-Wally Weekes fight at
Golden Gate Club (Sydney) t’other night was a dis-
appointment. Neit her acted up to expectations, though
flashes of clever work were shown ; it was a boxing match
pure and simple, utterly devoid of sting and vim. Tweedie
got the decision in the ninth round. Weekes was not
knocked out, but simply exhausted through jigging
about the ring.

News that ebony-hued Peter Felix beat Bill
Doherty at Kalgoorlie (W.A.), Dec. 2, for the Australian
heavyweight championship, much discounts the latter’s
reputation, built up on victories over “have-beens”
Mick Dooley and Tut Ryan. Report savs Doherty broke
both his hands early in the battle, which may account
for the surprise, as Felix is no champion, and has been
too long at the game to have the slightest show of im-
proving now. Just wait till middleweight Tim Murphy
gets at him ' Apropos, Slick Dooley challenged the black
to a match for £5O aside—win or lose with Dohertv.
Wonder if Peter will be taking any of the old time
Sydneyite who, it is said, has been employed on Fre-
mantle harbor works for some time.

Australas : an Axemen’s Annual Carnival, at
Ulverstone (Tas.) attracted contestants from all pro-
vinces, and the town was packed with visitors. On the
whole struggles were severe and finishes close. World’s
Champion Chop created intense excitement. W. If.
Chellis, of Deloraine—a splendid specimen of physical
manhood - won. Ex champion Bryan (Vic.) looked like
succeeding, but Cheliis's strength and stamina were too
good. The Deloraineite got through his 2ft. block in
4min. BJ4sec. Best previous performance in a champion
match (4min. 9sec.) stood to credit of “ iron man ” T.
Reeves. Bryan’s Mock fell 4see. after Chi llis s, and
Pettit’s (third) ssec. later. Worth noting that all three
finished well within Reeve’s record.
Frstwliile Captain’s Flat (N.S.W.) minor-pug.
Dan O Connell has struck had luck. At Blayney
(N.S.W.) last week he met Peter Learv, of Bathurst. In
round 3 Dan is alleged to have thrown Leary ; latter
claimed afoul, which the referee disallowed, whereupon
Leary quitted and Dan got the decision. Going round to
tiie front for the spoil, Dan found that someone had
levanted with the takings, about -C24.

Mail details convoy that, tho recent Sharkey-
Jeffties mill for world’s championship vi as savage from
end to end. Jeffries scaled 15st. and Sharkey 13st.
Sharkey had the better of matters for several rounds.
Some terrible blows were administered. Twice in the
13th term Sharkey staggered Jeffries with heavy swings-
on the back of the neck. Jeffries' nrse was split in round!
15, and the sight of Mood made Sharkev fight like a,
demon. Jeffries pounded away at the sailor’s ribs and
fractured one before they went to “corners.” Jeffries
had much the best of the last five of the stipulated 25-
rounds and did great execution per medium of two fear-
ful uppercuts. Desperate two-handed fighting on both-
sides sent the enormous gathering of spectators mad with
excitement. Ultimately both being on their feet at the
close of the 26th round Jeffries was adjudged the winner.

Whom he has appointed Vice-Regal Chemist.
The latest important news from the Trans-
vaal is that General Gatacre, while on his way

been told occupied an easily-assadable position at
Storm berg, struck a very bad snag; 000 of his

Judge Hartley Williams, who says he
reads The Bulletin “ with great pleasure and
considerable edification,” disputes the correctness
of a recent remark here made that the local legal
profession is at so low an ebb that it contains but
three men front whom a new Judge could be pro-
fitably selected. He gives it as his opinion that
the profession’s present status is as high as he has
known it to bo since he began practice in ’67, and
that be could mention a dozen possible Supreme
Court Judges. In fairness to bis Honor, it must
be remarked that he didn't mention them, and
that the occasion of his (after-dinner) speech was
a Law Institute function where blarney was
looked for.
A clumsy story of a “ meejum ” and some
alleged spirits was told a few days ago in Mel-
bourne city court. The ghost-seer was described
as a bony, sharp-featured woman, and her alleged
victim was an illiterate widow with a few thou-
sand pounds and a large deceased family. The
bony woman, so the story goes, used to inseit her-
self into trances and convey messages from them.
It seems to have been a pitiably stupid arid
awkward business, and the stage-management
was something awful. The medium sat on a
chair and closed her eyes; then she “gave.a
couple of jumps” which were understood to
signify that she had become unconscious. After
the jumps she said in a hollow voice that the
spirit of Bridget was speaking; that Bridget’s
spirit was quite happy and “getting on” well;
and that Bridget’s spirit was glad to see her
mother. Then the illiterate mother wept and
paid 10s. All the family came along in the same
indefinite fashion; also the “mother of God”
dropped in frequently. This was where the trouble
began. One day when the operator had given
two jumps and become stiff she said that the
spirit desired the widow to give the good medium
a new dress. Later the spirits said that the
medium’s house was so poor and uncomfortable
that they wouldn’t come there any more, and it
was understood that unless the widow supplied
the medium with better quarters all communica-
tion between her and her deceased relatives would
be cut off. The better accommodation was pro-
vided accordingly. The spirits also clamored for
better underclothing for the medium, also a black
silk dress, and some furniture ; and after a while
the seer stated in a deep monotone that she was
the spirit of Sarah or Jano or Mary, and that
Sarah ordered her mother to give the “meejum”
.£1 a week. The alleged “mother of God”
ordered the old woman to make her will in the
“meejum’s” favor, to give her £lOOO worth of
land, to take her on a trip to Ireland, America,
and Jerusalem, to advance .£2O to her brother, to
pay for French lessonsfor the lady with the familiar
spirit, to part with sundry bangles and other trifles,
and to adopt the “meejum ”as her daughter. Then
something burst, and the lady who gave two
jumps and then communicated wit h the mother of
God came to grief. The case opens up some
interesting questions. The money and clothes
and land and bangles were given by alleged direc-
tion of the dead. If the dead really gave these
directions, then it might prove that they were a
row of terribly stupid corpses, but there was no
fraud in the matter. So the obvious defence is
that the court can’t prove that the dead didn't
give these directions.

THE LATE MARTIV SIMONSEN.
Photo, by Tuttle and Co., Melb.
Little Mart in Simonson, the veteran fiddler, who shot him-
self the other day, because he was old and lame, and nearly
blind, and so poor that he had nought left hut some
clothes, was a tiny l.ear. One would hate him who
desired to stretch him longer on the tough rack of this
world. The sum of his griefs can never he published.
He bad long been due in the Celestial orchestra-for
parents are not worshipped here as in China. Thirty-
three years ago a tall, scrappy young woman, who went
about in a dingy green plaid gown and chip-straw hat,
came to Melbourne. That was Fannie Simonsen. Hold-
ing on to her apron was a little hoy of a man, Martin,
about up to her arm-pit. When Frances Saville was horn,
Fannie, in a speech at the old Melb. wooden matchbox
Princess's, told the audience, at her hen., “J have now
got a little Australian.” Meanwhile, Lyster had found
her out, as a worthy rival to keep Lucy Escott from being
too professionally cheeky.
Not generally known that the late accidentally-shot
** Dante ’’ (Gsear.Eliason) was a Mormon. After listening
to his doom, pronounced by Dr McCormack, without the
flicker of an eyelid, “ Dante ” ch erfiply filled in the last
seme with tricks of slight-of-hand for his baby girl's
amusement. This, too. when paralysis had alleady seized
the lower half of him. An hour later, though he was
•till conscious, those wonderful hands were working
convulsively in a grim con juring feat mw to poor Dante’s
repertoire, hut alas ! they had for once lost their cunning
and—a pitying Stage Manager hurriedly rang down the
curtain. Dante was hurl'd in Waverlev Cemetery,
Syd nev, next to the grave of Sadie McDonald, the Ameri-
can -•mibrWfe-artist, whose death occurred, 3 years ago,
on the same day of the year as Dante's.

Re the recent failure bv the members of a leading
Sydney theatrical eo. to organise a fund for the assist-
ance of members who fall upon evil days, a Teutonic

It is not generally kiimvii of Melba that she was the
first pupil Madame Kellerinann taught in Melbourne. She
carried off honors at musical examinations, and. accord
ing to her teacher, would have been a fine pianiste had
Na>tire not blessed her with a voice. In a letter to Mine.
Kellerinann. written after two years’ “at Home,” Melba
ex presses 1 her intention of visiting Australia shortly, and
Cromiscd, if she came, to sing at a benefit which was
eing given to her former teacher at that time. It would
have been an excellent thing for our departing pianiste
had the prima-donna fulfilled that promise at the recent
benefit. But Australia is not likely to hear her greatest
■ongsiress till the laurels of Europe have faded and the
voice is second hand.
“S.S.” : There is always something to he said on the
other side, and there may he a Messing disguised in the
faci that theatrical artists cannot make a home with us
in Ausi ralia, and must Hit in due time. When the pro.
docs not find the necessity of flitting after a few years, he
gen- rally develops fat, and becomes a privileged person,
and a privileg'd person in the profession is entirely like
a public tiui-aiice. Observe , for instance. Ilcnow
regards himself as an “established favorite," and there-
fore n person privileged to presume upon (he generosity
of the people who for many years have guffawed at his
somewhat cumbersome humor. His success would appear
to have given him the heliet that he is vastly superior to
any playwright with whose material he may have to deal.
and he gabbles a lot of itrelevarlt patter into all hiS i arts.
He is continually jerkirlg in extraneous asides; too —asides
intended evidently folr the edification of tlie people on the
stage, who siligger effdsively at the pdrtl.v cohledian s
impertinences. Many theatre-goers fiercely resent this
kiri I of thing'; and I feel that a little expostulation iS
called for.

“J.A.C.”: Re Melbourne audiences taking seriously

hundreds of times throughout Australasia. Further,
when the late “ Hick ” Thatcher, departing for England,
10 years ago, was banqueted in Melbourne by Iris brother

drinking the toast of Thatcher's health, “instead of
the stereotyped ’ He s a jolly good fellow ’ sang ‘ He is an

“ H.” : Have carefully observed many men under the
influence of passionate excitement, but have only seen
one, really in a frenzy, raise both arms at full stretch
above his head—yet that is exactly what the man on the
stage always does to express extreme rage, grief, per-
plexity, or terror. The average man, as far as 1 have
seen, when he really lets himself go in a fury, sometimes
raises one arm, with clenched fist, at full stretch above
his head and brings it down at once (sometimes on the
ottier fellow’s nose) ; generally lie only raises it about as
high as his ear. In perplexity, have noticed most men
bring their horny hands up io about half-way between
shoulder and waist; a minority grip the hair with one or
both hands; man}' more put one hand flat on some part
of the head, or take a firm grip of the chin. The
solitary exception mentioned above was an amateur
actor who, immediately after he had given 26 of us a
gorgeous supper on the strength of a wire that a horse
he had backed for £2OO hail won, received word that a
drunken operator had bungled the message and that he
was only a few shillings short of a million to the bad. lie

Uchsrd, Parisian dramatist, married Madeleine Brohan,
a brilliant actress of the Theatre Franyais, and they
separated, as usual. Not long afterwards, L’chard’s new
play of “ Fianmiina ” was read before tin-company. The
manager said, “Splendid! U’hal fire! I didn't think
Uchard had it, in him.” Madeleine Brolinn started up in a
rage, and exclaimed, “ It is because he has put Me into
it, and our private affairs.” “Nonsense,” said the
manager. The piece was quickly produced, and proved a
mighty hit, all because tile allusion was known. Made-
leine left the theatre. The plot of “ Fianmiina” hinges on
a son repudiating his guilty mother, while in the Fils
Natural of Dumas the Younger, the son repudiates his
father. Although Uchard and Brohan had no child,
there could be no mistake as to what spurred the author
on.
Dumas Fils to Bernhardt: “ Cnrl.v-headed people, like

“NeWchurn”: Lately went to see George Rignold,
Ugly George, I believe you call him locally, as Paoli
Maeari. 1 didn’t travel from Bourke in an open cattle-
truck, but came further—from Maoriland per saloon at
the expense of my creditors—and I think it was worth it
to see Ugly George as Paoli. Of all the villains I ever
heard of, saw, or read of, or even dreamt of, he was a
long worst. He was magnificently horrible. Lilian
Wheeler is a pretty girl, and sometimes does good work.
Her shoulders are divine. But when she flaps tier arms
—Acti Gott! Something between a windmill arm and an
emu’s wing is about the nearest existing comparison to
the action that I have seen. (Saw an emu in the gardens
yesterday.)
“Scotty”: Re Sydney’s qualms about “The Chris-
tian,” it ought to see Madame Beatrice in “Nos Intimcs.”
I saw her in Holy Glasgow, carried over to the sofa,
when suddenly the lights, went out. I also once saw in
the same city a “Pepper’s Ghost” Ulysses interrupt
Penel pe in a “ risqub ” scene. Likewise Mary Anderson
(not our Mary) in “Cutty Sat k,” and in a cutty sark—and
no outcry made.
Lawyer M’lntyre, who came to grief and gaol lately,
was an ardent worshipper of a certain charming
exponent of opern-houffe in his youngerand more verdant
days. Wh-n the goddess needed financial assistance
on’one occasion, poor young Johnnie M’lntyre came to
the rescue, and the story tells that as soon as lie had
hacked her little hill, Eniilie found hilt: an awful bore,
and closed the stage door against him.

HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discnarge or otherw isc, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, yon
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless or
bm * l to amputation ; but do not, fori PAN
tJURLYOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

The Glory of Man.
The crown and glory of manhood is strength—
power. All human conquests have been won by
it; individual and collective. The earliest sign of
decay in man is not usually pain, but weakness of
some kind—of mind, or body, or both. This may
be the inevitable sequence of advanced years, or
it may, as we all know, show itself at any period
of life. Butdt always means that the sources of
siivnglh are failing, as the lessening of the water
in a river means a drying up of the springs and
stieams which feed it.
I said “sources 1 ' of strength, using the plural
word. I should have said “ source ” of strength,
for in human, beings there is but one. What is it?
Perhaps the experience of Mr. David Jones will
help.us to an answer.
“ In the summer of 1881,” he says, “ I began to
feel ill and out of sorts. I was weak and tired
and quite worn out with little exertion. I had a
poor appetite, and after eating had pain and
■weight at the chest. My secretions were scanty
and thick. My back felt stiff and gave me much
pain as I moved about. For three years I suf-
fered like this, being at times better and then
worse. I consulted a doctor, who gave me medi-
cines and recommended Turkish baths ; but I got
no better for any kind of treatment.
“ My brother then told me about Mother Sei-
gel s Curative Syrup, but I had no faith in adver-
tised medicines. He, however, urged me to take
it, arid after taking a few doses I experienced so
much relief that I continued with it, and was soon
strong and well as ever. Since that time I take a
dose of this remedy when I feel at all ailing, and
it sets me right. I have praised Mother Seigel’s
Syrup to all my friends, many of whom have
tried it and been benefited by it. You can pub-
lish this statement if you like. (Signed) David
Jones, 1 Dunlace-street, Walton, Liverpool, Julv
31, 1896.”
We have room for one more short letter before
we try to come at the answer to the question with
which we set Out. It is exactly in the same line,
and ought to make the results of our enquiry all
the more clear and plain.
In the spring of 1888,” proceeds the writer,
my health began to fail me. I felt languid and
heavy, as if something had come over me. I had
a bad taste in the mouth, my appetite was poor,
and the little food I took gave me pain across the
chest and between the shoulders. My food lav
like lead on my stomach. I was constantly
spitting up a thick phlegm, and when in bed
heavy sweats came over me. I got weaker and
Weaker, and from time to time was confined to
bed. Often I was so-bad I could not dress or un-
dress myself.
“Now better, now worse, but never well, I
suffered for over five years. I took different kinds
of medicines, and had a doctor, but got no real
benefit from anything.
In July, 1893, a book was left at my house in
which I read of cases like mine having been cured
by Mother Siegel’s Syrup. I got a bottle from
the International Tea Company, Yeovil, and be-
gan taking it. In a short time I felt much benefit,
and, by continuing with it, gained strength. I
coidd eat better, food agreed with me, and by-and-
by I was strong and well. But for Mother Seigel’s
Syrup I believe 1 should not now be alive. You
are at liberty to publish this statement. (Signed)
(Mrs.) Jane Cronel, 82 Huish, Yeovil, November
29 th, 1895.
What, then, do these cases show to be the source
of strength? The answer is, Digested Food. That
and nothing else. All strength, of body or of
mind, comes from that, and that only. What,
then, is the great enemy of strength, the fountain
of weakness? Indigestion—dyspepsia. You see
why and how. A child could not miss the argu-
ment. What, then, restores strength ? Mother
Seigel’s Syrup. In what way? By setting the
digestive machinery in healthy operation. That
is what it did for our correspondents and does
daily for multitudes. Use it if you need it, and
pass the news to other weak ones.
A Piece of Plate.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ You talk about racing,” said Swanky, replacing
The whisky and rum at the back of the bar.
“Well, Jork ins, the squatter—a regular rotter—
He gave ’em last season a bit of a jar.
“ The queerest collection, from every selection,
The nags of the shearers and rouseabout blokes ;
They’d lame ’uns, and tame ’uns, and good Tins',
and game ’uns,
All ages and colors and sizes of mokes.
“ But Timothy Murphy, whose breeding was turfy
(His father-in-law was a trainer, they say),
Had got in good fettle a cuddy by Metal
He d picked up, he told us, down Shoalhaven way.
“ And Sandy M‘Gregor (the red-headed beggar
That broke, you’ll remember, M'Alister’s ribs),
Had brought his bay filly, the Lainington Lily
(Named after his gubernatorial nibs).
“It seems they got fightin’, brought on by the
skitin’
Of Sandy proclaiming the skill qf his mare ;
And biffin’ and basilin’ began, and the smashin’
Of fists ag’in faces was heard in the air. '
“ The super., to stop it, said : ‘Both of yez drop
But hr wasn’t Foley, or Miller, or Mace !
But Jorkins came, cursing, when Murphy was
nursing
What Sandy M'Gregor had left of his face.
“ Said he : ‘Stop the riot! Yer besrgars, be quiet !
There’s nothing in bluster and bully and brag.
So bring up your horses ; you know where the
course is,
And race ’em to settle which has the best nag.
“‘We’ll start after dinner, and I’ll give the
winner
A good piece of plate ; and I hope this will stay
Your boasting and bragging and lying and
nagging ;
The shearing by this should be well under way.’
“She knocked ’em all silly, the Lamington Lily,
And finished a long way ahead of the crew ;
Then Jorkins —the sinner! —he hands to the
winner
A big piece of dinner- plate broken in two.
“ And I’d made a book on the nag they was
shook on,
And stiffened the cow—but the coves wouldn’t
pay.
So— that Jorkins the squatter’s a regular rotter
Is a thing I’ll maintain to the end of my day ! ”
N.S.W.
W. T. GOODGE.
Related by a popular Melbourne physician
that while castigating his youthful son and heir
across his knee he felt a sharp prick in his leg,
and a few minutes later became deathly ill and
brought forth into the light of day that which he
had hoped to digest. It turned out, he says, that
his offspring had given him an injection of
apomorphine. The proud father talks of sending
the measurements of his son’s cranium to Lom-
broso.
A curious spectacle was the hoisting of the
60 Siberian dogs out of the quarantine launch into
the exploration ship, Southern Cross. Although
these dingo-looking animals are all alike as two
peas the Finns of the crew knew each one by
name, and when a dog was called and came a Finn
would grab the dog’s long chain, fling up the end
to a mate on board ship, and the animal would be
hauled up by the neck, half-strangled. On launch
and ship the dogs were fighting like demons and
the Finn sailors had a tough time separating
them.

Guy’s Hospital,

“By it, the thousand confusing names of drugs, nerves, muscles,
etc., can be quickly and surely memorised. Jt has been a great
boon to me, and T wish to bear testimony to the simplicity,
utility, and wonderful results of your system.”
Rev.' H. E. Mehhtmast,
Wes. Minister,
Victoria.
“* * * Together with the fulness and completeness of the
details of your System make it, in my opinion, the best ever
brought before the •public. * * * I most heartily recommend
it as cast/, natural, and thoroughly practical.”
Mr. It. T'kahciu,

“Tt makes all branches of study very easy and pleasant. The
almanac for any year can be learned in two minutes. I can
learn history, geography, foreign languages, ledger folios, etc.,

“I have now completed your course of lessons, and I must
candidly admit that your System, for examinations, makes a
perfect certainly of remembering anything required.”
They have collected some £'looo in Bris-
bane for a statue of the late T. J. Byrnes, and the
Committee which met the other day to spend
the motley acju.-ibhied and separated in disorder.
Which was appropriately Irish. And already
people have almost forgotten who Byrnes Was.
He did nothing for (Queensland— he might have
done something; but unluckily he died. The
oiily things that he can lie definitely remembered
fOr are his Workers’ Coercion Act and his opposi-
tion to Federation ; and to perpetuate those in a
Squab statue is just about the height of foolishness
possible to A Warm-Weather country.
Apparently Q. Labor-leader Lawson
Wished to have it On record that there had been
a Labor Ministry—to make a beginning of things,
and accustom the public mind to the idea ; for
there was no chance whatever that the Labor
men could keep office without the help of the
Opposition factions —and this Was refused. Still,
the Labor inert were in office for a week, and an
Unkind critic declared they all looked mighty un-
comfortable in new suits donned for the occasion.
Anyway* Davvsoh wanted a better team, liis
rtien are more honest than the awful Fhilp-and-
Dickson crowd ; but they don’t impress the public
mind with their ability. And Dawson himself is
a man who wittily rejoins to his opponent;
“Didn’t hear what was said? Why don’t you
take the wax out of your ears?” He is better
than that, of course ; but that is one poor feature
of him; Now Boodle wraith, true to its old tradi-
tion, has assimilated the leader of the Opposition
—Who ever thought to see J. U. Drake in that
galley?—and is still none too stable. (Queensland,
like N.S. Wales, wants a big democratic leader.
What a chance Lane missed with his Cosine
chimera ! But then Lane never had enough
ballast for leadership.
Chamberlain, in answer to Aslnnead-
Bartlett in the House of Commons, lltli August,
1«N»:
But what is the alternative—(he policy which the hon.
member would have pm forward if standing in ifi.v place?
We know what it would be. He would have sent an ulti- -
ihatum to President Kruger lhat unless these reforms
(which he would have specified) were granted by a par- :
tieiilar day the British Government would interfere by
force and then he would have come here and asked the
Bouse for a vote of credit, for ten or twenty millions (it
Would not matter which particularly), and sent an army
Of 20,00 ) nleii at least to force President Kruger to grant
.Reforms in a State v.itli which we had pledged ourselves
repeatedly—not only this Government, hut. previous Go-
vernments, BY THE VOWS OK SUCCESSIVE SECRE-
TARIES OK STATE —that we would have nothing to do.
That is his policy. It is not my policy, and never will be.
The new Q. Boodledrake Ministry (Griffil-
wraitli-e«»i-Nelsoii-eM»i-Byriies-c!m-Dicks!Ui-CM»t-
Boodle-rim-Pliilp Drake) narrowly escaped defeat
over the secret job connected with the leasing of the
Barron Falls to Chillagoe Mines Co. —term 50
years; consideration sliding from JESOO to £lf 87
per annum ; guarantee that the co. won’t bust
yeats before it gets to the heavy end of the lease—
rtoile Whatever. Barron Falls is the champion <Q.
beauty-spot; all-tlie-same, its destiny is probably
sooner or later to supply “power” as Niagara is
doing, if it’s made worth the province's while.
Objections are (1) to length of lease, all in favor of
co., which can go out of businessjvhefi it likes and
repudiate liability ; (2) exclusive grab at a ridicu-
lous price—though it m ght pay to sacrifice some
Falls for £5OOO a year it certainly isn't worth
while spoiling all for .£5O0 —and the summer flow
doesn't cover the rocks now : (3) underhand way
in which, as usual, the trick has been worked by
a Govt. thick as (h’m) thieves with N.Q. specula-
tors. The Labor party will do well to tight the
gang to the bitter end.

Concerning the Northern fiasco :
It Lvnt developments in Queensland have marie one or
two things in .Northern politics unpleasantly, clear. In
the first place, it has become painfully evident that, the
Continuous Government (with a trifling interruption
now and again) is, for some time to come, tne only one
possible in Banamdand. Whatever strengl li Labor when
allied to the miscellaneous disaffects in the Assembly,
may possess for mere aggressive opposition, it is only too
plain that Labor cannot command sufficient support
from the outside to enable it to run the country. It is
further evident that such members as Forrest and Leahy
have little or no sympathy with Democratic ideals
and progress; that their opposition to the DicksOn
Government was purely factious; that they are
securely attached to neither God nor Devil as far as the
political world is concerned, Forrest had a splendid
opportunity to head a progressive parly. He refused it,
and fell hack into the gentle unobtrusiveness of his billet
as senior Member for Brisbane North, and colleague to
the canny Mac Paterson. It will be long tiefore he sights
a similar opporl unity. The overtures of Labor to the
members of the old Opposition or Remnant were not very
kindly received. The impossibility of hanging on to the
loaves and fishes of office for a decent spell was
too painfully apparent and the Remnant prcmpily
declined the proffered honors. Consequently Labor
assumed office with the funeral dirge ringing in
its ears and was gently hoisted out of its various port-
folios by the first vole that wns taken. The wily Philp,
now that Dickson had been dethroned, set himself to
work to undermine the Parliamentary enemy, and stag-
gered Brisbane by announcing a few days later that he
had secured J. G. Drake, leader of the Remnant, as his
Minister for Education—with a seat in the Upper House.
The Remnant itself was staggered most of all, for its
members averred in the House that their leader
had acted without their knowledge—nothing being
further from their thoughts than any amalgama-
tion with Hie Ministerialists. . . . Drake's action re
Federation had made him somewhat insecure in his
constituency and he was probably weary of waiting for
that Liberal Progressive Govt, which Bunnnalnml always
expects and never gets any closer to. These repeated
losses look had for the Remnant. Powers left the sinking
ship some years ago; Drake has just defected ; Groom,
the new leader, is a weary unreliable old wobbler-and
the rest must be getting tired of their unsatisfactory
position. And this is the sum total of Democr itic gains
for Queensland after years of battling—a Labor Govt, in
power for-four or five days; the gradual absorption of
the able men of the old Opposition by the Ministry ; and
the Continuous Government back in power again—
apparently as strong as ever!
Country residents cannot rlo better than send a
post card to VV. Jno. Baker, 3 Hunter-street, Sydney, and
receive in return his illustrated catalogue of 14 large,
pages of cut lery novelties such as cases with 2,3, 4 and 7
razors to the case. The epicure who likes to have a
separate razor for each day of the week is here catered
for by having 7 scrapers, each branded with its. own
particular day. Then there are patent safety razors by
which the greatest blunderer can shave himself swiftly
and blunder he ever so much he cannot cut anything but
bristles. There are knives of every sort, shape, and size,
and for all purposes ; Ladies’ scissors, singly or in leather
velvet-lined cases of 3 and 6 ; nail, .embroidery, button-
hole and other kinds of scissors. Manicure sets (suitable
for Xmas presents), new shipment just, opened. Hand-
some artistic Ladies’ Cutlery Cases with gold, gilt and
oriental design scissors and heaps of others too numerous
to mention. All the stock is of the best quality and the
public should call round and spend a pleasant hour
inspecting the varied assortment of things that will cut,
from the innocent looking nail-cleaner to the ferocious-
looking veterinary sets that make one glad he wasn’t
born a horse, or an ass. or anything the vet. operates
upon.*
On a recent eventful Saturday morning
Vic. Premier Turner received a wire from Oom
rorrest, of W. A.. containin'* the words, “ I have
the honor to inform you that the Federation Bill
is thrown out.” Turner smiled and wired back
the laconic answer, “So am I.”
A JMudgee (N.S. W. ) youth died very sud-
denly and was promptly post-mortemed by two
doctors who reported death from hydatids, and
said they had removed the largest cyst they had
ever seem Deceased’s father being dissatisfied,
the body was again examined by two other
filedieo-, who say they found no trace of a cyst,
or its removal, but discovered a date-stone in the
much-gangrened vermiform-appendix. “ When
doctors differ."
Says Otago Witness (Dunedin, M.L.):—
If the Sefldon Ministry were a Ministry of all the vir-
tues instead of all the opposite it would still be necessary
to put them out at. this election. They have had their
innings ; it is the turn of the other side.
And yet, if the proprietors of the Otago Witness
said to that editor: “You have served us well
and honestly and admirably for many years, at a
poor salary—therefore it is a fair thing that you
be fired out into the street without pension or
compensation, to live anyhow you can ; it is the
other fellow’s turn now ” —well, that editor, being
struck in the eye by his own gospel, would pro-
bably have said that it was the gospel of a grace-
less and ungrateful beast.
Brisbane Telegraph makes the terrible
discovery that
The federal tariff will be in the interests of the local
maiuiftieiuier. . . . The manufacturer expects a real
good time under the union. He will make these young
communities bleed at every pore, that he may live and
fatten as slaveowners did in palmy slave days in America.
This is the broader spirit, the spirit, of brotherhood. . . .
The tariff is ready, and long has been. It is a new sharp
threshing instrument, having teeth, with which poor
Queensland will be flagellated like a Nubian or a negro
slave.
Well, there is one consolation—Queensland’s back
should be about the consistency of horn by now.
The hinder part of that province has been walloped
for nearly 20 years by the most crushing tariff in
all Australia. The Federal Government can't
make its spine resound with the whack of a
heavier tariff than it has under disunion.
Apropos offensive French caricatures of
Queen Victoria. One of the most biting and
brutal of these, a work of absolute genius, is
now being circulated in Australia, in a London
paper called J i.lustrated Bits. It represents a
nionstrously-fat and distorted but unmistakeable
V.K. sitting on old Uncle Paul and flattening
him out by sheer .weight, and below it is the line
(a transparent “saver ”): ’“Thus does the ‘gal-
lant ’ Fr*nciiman lampoon our beloved Queen.”
“ Our beloved Queen” is indeed beautiful—coming
from the thief-Bull who reprints the blistering
picture to attract pennies.
Allan M‘Lean, Victoria’s new Premier, is
an elderly grey-beard, with a limp, who resigned
his honorary portfolio in Turner’s Ministry, which
lie has now ousted. A bitter anti-Federationist
and a strong Protectionist, he is the Joss of the
cattle-fattening district of North Gippsland ; is
director and second largest shareholder in the
“ busted ” Maffra Beet Sugar Co. ; head of
M'Lean and Go., catt e-salesmen. His youngest
son, Norman, is now with the Transvaal con-
tingent. The M'Lean Government may last to 1
the general election, in October, but it is quite
possible it will go down in January, if Turner
cares to challenge it. M'Lean is in a complicated
situation. He ejected' the Turner Ministry on a
motion to the effect that it wasn’t getting on fast
enough with its Liberal measures. A handful of
Liberals who had various grounds of complaint
against t he Turner Government followed him, but
in the main it was a Tory vote that enabled the
Democrat M‘Lean to turn out the Democrat
Turner for not pushing his democratic measures
along harder. Therefore Premier M'Lean, whose
Ministry is to he more strongly progressive than
Turner’s, had to take far too many Tories into it,
in return for the support he has received and the
support he hopes for. And after ejecting Turner
for not being democratic enough, lie must ap-
parently either be Tory enough to keep the sup-
port of the Gillies crowd, or lose the Gillies sup-
port and depend on the votes of Turner and his
late following to keep him in office.
Shiels is the motive-power of the new Vic.
Ministry. Allan M'Lean is merely one of his
puppets. Shiels did the plotting to get the
Turner Govt, ousted, and it was he who selected
the members of the Cabinet. There are very few
men in the House vho are other than disgusted
with Shiels and his shrieky politics, but those few
faithful worshippers are in the Cabinet. Shiels
saw to it that he only had men, around whom he
had thrown his weird influence. He made a bold
bid for the favor of David Syme by “diploma-
tising ” the Argus and then handing over to the
Age the names of the new Ministers as a piece of
exclusive information. The Age, of course,
accepted the information, but next day came out
with a slashing leader pointing to Shiels as the
one man likely to wreck the Govt, before it got
properly afloat. Shiels’ perfidy only won the con-
tempt of David, who would, nevertheless, like to
be kind to M'Lean for the sake of their partner-
ship in certain land-deals. There is just one thing
for which Shiels ought to deserve the best thanks
of the community, and that is that he completely
out-man<euvred Gillies, the supposed master tac-
tician of the House.
McLean’s new Victorian Ministry is a
thing of shreds and patches. Itcontains first and
foremost, Shiels, the flowery failure of six years
ago. Then come the anti-Federal trinity, McLean,
Outtrim.and Graham, who went round the country
asserting that Victoria would lose .‘5B millions
sterling hy the abolition of the stock-tax! Next
there is the machine-minded Irvine, violent free-
trader and vehement stock tax abolitionist—an
equity lawyer whose dulness and lack of humor
is sufficient to sodden any batch of Ministers on
earth. There is the clever McCay, a radical in
most things political, and McColl, who was a
shining light in the obstructionist crowd which
clustered around Duncan Gilles as soon as lie got
back into the House. Again, McCay is the anti-
vaceination fanatic of the’Asseuibly, while Carty
Salmon, one of the honorary Ministers, is the
champion of vaccination. Fink, the other lion.
Minister, is the alleged, funny financier of the
House and i« to assist Shiels at the Treasury.
Shiels at the Treasury by himself was bad enough,
lint when assisted by Fink, the gods alone know
what will happen. Baby-faced Watt is a frothy
incoherent orator who thinks he can recite Banjo
Paterson’s “ Man from Snowy River.” Of the
Ministers in the Upper House the less said the
better. Witli Balfour and J: M. Davies the holy
element is very strong.
Tho long article in the Quarterly Review
on Australian Federation is from the pen of Prof.
Harrison Moore, the smart, boyish-looking, little
professor of law at Melb. University. Prothero,
the new editor of the Quarterly, was a friend of
Moore’s at Oxford.
“ Rough-rider ” to The Bullf.ttx :
At Darling-hurst Gaol, Sydney, on Sunday, 3rd Dee.,
Frederick l.ester, 35 (married—wife and two children
fortunately in London), under sentence of five years'
penal servitude, for forgery, hanged himself with a part
of nis bedding, which he fastened to the electric-light
piping in his cell. Nothing very strange about all that,
people would say—but, stay ! A comparatively young
man, with, aft< r all, only about four years to serve, and
money for him expected daily from England, would not
have " shuffled-off ” hut for a very special cause. That
cause was the “separate treatment/’ As Deputy-Governor
Rowley suavely put it, “ the prisoner could only speak to
the warders and chaplain.”- What a delightful social
circle 1 And yet even that -must have been something.
But why was not the said chaplain called 10 testify, to t he
unfortunate’s mental condition? surely his testimony on
such a point would have been valuable, sb ce it was well
known that the poor wretch had said that he dreaded the
“ solitary ” more than the sentence itself! It was also in
evidence that there are no observation-holes in the cell
doors or walls, as in all English prisons. And, lastlv and
significantly, four of the jurors ou the inquest were good-
conduct prisoners.

FASHIONABLE TAILORING
—AT—
A Moderate Price.
TF one wants to dress well (and, of course, everyone
does), the tailor’s bill is a somewhat serious item of
personal expenditure. There is a great difference be-
tween paying two or three guineas for a suit and four or
five. The difference amounts to an extra suit a year, and
an extra suit will enable you to appear always dressed
like a gentleman. By patronising C. G. HATTE, of New-
town (Sydney), you may always be well dressed whilst
your tailor’s hill will be no greater than before, when
you had to continue using the old garments after their
beauty and freshness had departed.
For some time past HATTE has made a special
feature of his Tailoring Department. His Home buyers
forward regular shipments of the newest and most
seasonable goods, bought direct from the manufac-
turers. so that you have an immense assortment for
selection.
Special Rooms have been fitted up at his establishment
for the carrying on of this large and increasing depart-
ment; and as all the garments are made on the pre-
mises, there is no slop or factory' work, but everything
is turned out in the best possible style.
llatte has also engaged one of the crack cutters in
the colony, so that a perfect fit may he relied on. In this
way you secure the choicest materials, the most fashion-
able style, and the finest finish, at prices at least thirty
per cent, under those charged by ordinary city houses.
His Two-Guinea Suits (including extra pair of trousers)
are a marvel of cheapness, and hundreds are turned out
every week, giving unqualified satisfaction. Try one.
They are just the thing for the present season.
If you live at a distance and cannot pay a personal
visit, write for patterns and self-measurement f< rms and
your orders will be completed equally well and satisfac-
torily. You will get no such value anywhere else.

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
medicator.
is inflammation of the
lining membrane of the nose
and adjoining passages. If this in-
flammation is not arrested it invades
the passages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungrs. It injures the sight and
hearing, destroys the sense of taste
and smell, renders the breath offen-
sive, breaks down the affected
tissues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the small
frontal bones of the skull. The putrid
discharge passing through the lungs
and stomach causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want relief and
cure? If so, try our great remedy. It
has no equal.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
1 suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
1 also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. 1 have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

WEAK, NERVOUS, AND IN A VERY LOW STATE,
Throug-h a Great Deal of Suffering*.
EAR, TOOTH .A-InTID FACE-ACHE.
An Unstrung Nervous System Thoroughly Renovated.
The Case of
UR. WILLIAM HARRISON.
(From the Newtown Independent. ”)
Maria Street lies in a thickly populated
part of Newtown, and it was here that our
reporter sought for No 138, the residence of
Mr Harrison. The house is readily found,
being the nicest and most attractive in the
street. Mr Harrison, wdio had just returned
from work, greeted the reporter with a
cheery welcome.
“ 1 wish to ask you, Mr. Harrison,”
inquired our reporter, “ the truth of the
Statement that you have been through a
great deal of suffering, and finally found a
sure and perfect relief?*’
\ es ; that is quite true, and I am never
likely to forget the time I had. I will tell
y<»u how it started :—I had had a long spell
of very heavy work, for 1 may tell you J am
in the building trade, and at best my occu-
pation is very laborious. I got weak,
nervous, and in a very low state of health
F believe my system was thoroughly run
down, and for nine weeks I had a terrible
time.'*
‘'d ii-«-t were your symptoms, Mr Harri-
son ? ”
-l My great trouble was neuralgia. The
puius would.come up my spine and settle in
my bead and face, mostly on one side of the
face, giving me the earache an'l excruciating
pa ns in the jaws At times tiie neuralgia
would leave one side of the face and settle
in the other. The pains came on every
night time with distressing regularity, and
lasted till about three o'clock in the morn-
ing. It was a perfect misery to go to bed,
and I was forced to get up and walk the
floor for hours. Sometimes, to get a little
relief, I held brandy in my mouth to deaden
the pain. I became a martyr to both tootli
and faceache. The pains spread all round
my gums, and to this was joined headache
and frequent giddiness. After some time
my legs became affected, and trembled so
I dreaded they would not carry me and that
I should fall down. This convinced me
that my nervous system was thoroughly
unstrung. I would give sudden starts
in my sleep, and wake up with a jerk
for no reason that I could tell. After eating
there was a fee ing of wind gather d across
my chest, and it hurt me to stoop or bend.
.My back pained me all down the spine, and
I had to have it rubbed to get a little ease ;
and I got that way at last I felt pains from
head to foot, p rticularly, I noticed that
my distressing symptoms were aggravated
by the hot weather.”
“ Did you leave oft work, Mr. Harrison ? ”
inquired the reporter.
No ; bad as I was, I stuck to my job,
and kept battling through. In fact, I was
that way that work, as loug as 1 could
struggle with ft, was the only relief I had:
“ i )id you seek medical advice ? ”
“ \es : I went to a doctor, and he gave
me some powders, but they did me no good
whatever "
“ Yet you got cured, I believe?”
“ Yes ; Clements I onic cured me ; there
is no mistake about that, I noticed a
decided improvement after the third or
fourth dose, and after I had continued taking
Clements Tonic I got steadily better ”
“ What induced you to take Clements
Tonic ? ”
“ We were living in Hugo Street at that
time, and I remember my wife picked up a
little book of cures effected, and she read
what Clements Tonic had done for
other sufferers. And assome of these persons
mentioned were local people that we knew
of, my wife gained confidence that what was
said was true. And it was my wife per-
suaded metogetClementsTonic and take it ”
“Was your recovery complete ? ”
“ I got all right again, and as sound as the
hank ; all my troubles went away. The
trembling in the limbs, the nervousness,
head iclie, and, what relieved me the most of
all, theteriibleneuralgic pains and toothache,
disappeared, and I was able to get my night’s
rest again Remember, I lost my proper rest
for nine weeks, always having to get up
early the next morning, sleep or no sleep,and
I am certain that bad my troubles not been
stopped in time by Clements Tonic I should
have pot into a deplorable, helpless con-
dition”
“ Will you allow me to make your re-
covery public?"
“By all means. You are quite welcome
to publish what I have said about my sick-
ness, and what Clements Tonic has done for
me. It was by reading another man's case
that I was fortunately induced to try
Clements Tonic, and I shall be glad if what
I say may benefit someone else ”

A Barber’s Bilio6Si)€ss.
FIVE YEARS ANP NO RELIEF.
Cotild oot Walk—Weak as a Child.
Bile BeafyS for Biliotisocss Beneficial.
A comparatively young man is Mr. August Zalewski to tell such a tale as this, yet, when a
reporter called upon him at his place of business, 84 George-street, Brisbane, Q., he stated that
for five years his continual suffering from severe biliousness and from its numerous effects, he
might have been a man three times his age. But to let Mr. Zalewski tell his own tale : “I am
27 years old and for the greater portion of my life have lived
in Brisbane. For the past five years, that is since I was 22,
I have been up till lately a martyr to the severest kind of
bilious attacks. These attacks were always accompanied by
headaches and retching, and would often leave me almost pro-
strated. I was often compelled to give up attending to my
customers, and on one occasion I remember I had to leave a
customer half shaved. He was obliged to finish shaving
himself, much to his disgust. These attacks continuing for
a long period and getting more numerous and severe as time
went on, I became as weak as a child, and indeed had to be
treated as one. I could not undress myself even. In the
natural course of events I tried many advertised remedies
and several doctors prescribed for me; no good resulted,
however, and I found both treatments very expensive. I
first_ heard of Bile Beans in Sydney about the time I was
leaving on my return for Brisbane, and, on arrival, finding
they were obtainable here, I purchased a box. The first dose
fave me immediate relief, and, since I have been taking
iile Beans, I have felt a continued improvement and am
now a new man, being able to attend to my business with-
out impediment. I have shown my gratitude to the pro-
prietors of this medicine by recommending the Beans to any
of my acquaintances who have complained of being unwell,
and in many cases have given them a few to try, with the result that they also have joined in
the praise of Bile Beans for Biliousness.

20 HIGHEST AWARDS
At every International Exhibition since 1851, wherever
it has been in competition.
SOAP
Has invariably been awarded the Highest Distinction at
the disposal of the Judges.
The Testimony of Eminent Analytical
Chemists:
From Dr. REDWOOD, Ph.D.,
F.1.C., F.C.S., &c.,
Late Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy to the
.Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.
“ My analytical and practical experience
of Pears’ Soap now extends over a very
lengthened period—nearly 50 years—during
which time I have never come across
another toilet soap which so closely realises
my ideal of perfection ; its purity is such
that it may be used with perfect confidence
upon the tenderest and most sensitive skin
—even that of a new-born babe. ”
CHAS. R. C. TICHBORNE, Esq.,
LL.D., F.1.C., F.C.S.,
Lecturer on Chemistry at Carmichael College of
Medicine, Dublin, and Chemist to the Apothe-
caries’ Hall of Ireland.
“I have made three separate and in-
dependent analyses of Pears’ Soap, obtain-
ing the samples myself at the ordinary
retail shops, and from these examinations
lam enabled to certify to its purity. It is
made in a most perfect manner, and is free
from any causticity—to persons of delicate
skin a question of vital importance. Being
free from all adulteration with water its
durability is really remarkable. I cannot
speak too highly of it, for it strikingly
illustrates the perfection of toilet soap.”
STEVENSON McADAM, Esq.,
Ph.D., &c.,
Lecturer on Chemistry, Svr /cons’ Hull,
Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have made careful analyses of Pears’
Soap, which I have obtained indiscrimi-
nately at different shops in Edinburgh,
and I can certify to its being a pure and
genuine soap, free from admixture with
any foreign substances, and practically
devoid of causticity. It combines detergent
with emollient properties in a high degree,
and it may therefore be used with great
advantage for toilet and hath purposes,
especially in the case of children and others
whose skin is soft and delicate, and liable
to be affected by the impure and caustic
nature of ordinary soap.”
The Beating of Dead-to-Rights.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Drab-to-'Ri aim was a man of the Stone Age, and
lie acted according to its lights. But when a care*
less Nature dumped him down in the latter part
of the Nineteenth Century, the community found
him out of place, and made him spend large por-
tions of his life in the stoneyards and quarries of
its gaols*
Mis stretches of freedom wet© little more than
holidays to him ; and, during ohe unusually long,
the pom, weak Nineteenth-Century woman, who
worshipped the bull-neck and the bulging muscles
of the Stone Man, and who wept over him and
told silly little useless lies for him, gave Dead-to-
Rights a girl baby. It had a funny Chinese face
andsandy hair that touched aphaseof theCaveMan
which Dead-to-Rights had never known before.
The mother had been his property; he could realise
Woman only as a man’s possession. He had cut-
Up with het his share of anything going, and had
exacted Oil her part unswerving fidelity, ceaseless
drudgery, uncomplaining submission, audacious
and skilful perjury. Her share had never
amounted to much. Anything coming in the way
of Dead-to-Rights was seldom of value ; he was an
inartistic, commonplace, obsolete criminal, with
nothing picturesque or profitable in his whole
career. His was a sort of enterprise that risks
five years and a flogging to rob a stranger of a
silver watch—that breaks into a house for the sake
of an old suit of clothes. In the Stone Age, Dead-
to-Rights would have been a leader of men ; the
Nineteenth Century had no room for a criminal of
his sort.
But even the tiger loves its little ones. Bar
back in the procession of development the love of
offspring became exalted into a passion that is
sublime.
“Little Sugar beats me,” said Dead-to-Rights
when he took the tiny, pudgy-faced infant on his
knee; and the thin, round-backed woman behind
him nearly cried with pleasure. Dead-to-Rights
had found a master. He would have gone to the
triangles of Pentridge again to give the child a
passing pleasure. He would have takeh his stand
beneath the lantern-light of Melbourne Gaol to
help her out of any danger. It was his desire to
minister to her wants that caused her to lose him
for four years. Had it not been for the prompt-
ness and accuracy of aim of a constable who
anticipated resistance, the four years might easily
have been fourteen; but, as it was, Dead-to-
Rights did not come-to until he reached the
watchhouse ; and all was over, then.
While her father was doing his “time,” Sugar
grew into a thick, chubby, sturdy little thing,
with unkempt golden hair, a pug nose, and two
rows of tiny teeth that made Dead-to-Rights
nearly crush her to pieces on his chest in sheer
delight when he saw her. With the memory of
his last absence fresh on his mind, the man listened
to his wife’s warnings.
“ Can’t yer git shut er the crook fellers, Jim ? ”
she pleaded. “ They was tollin’ me there’s a
chanst on the sewerage, now.”
“ Um,” responded Dead-to-Rights.
But he strolled out of the house to meet the
“ Angel ” at the two-up school, for the “ Angel ”
had heard of something that was sweet —and was
the hero of the hour. It was to be the privilege
of Dead-to-Rights, by virtue of his record, to par-
ticipate in the sweet thing; and, proof to the
cajoleries and upbraidings and whining reproaches
that rose in a chorus round him, the Angel was
keeping the information for him.
“ Whay’s you goin’ to, Dada?” Little Sugar
was waiting at the front-gate. “ Do’n go ’way.
Me an’ mummer’s wantin’ you ter stay wif us.”
The child was in her father’s arms. His face
was against hers.
‘ What’y you kyin’ for, Dada ? ” she asked.
“ I ain’t—l ain’t ! ” said Dead-to-Rights, put-
ting the child on her feet again.
“ I’m gointer stay at home with you and yer
mother—you take it from me ! ”
And the sweet thing that the Angel had was
lost for ever. It was wasted on another who
lacked the courage to handle it properly, and who
paid for his hesitancy with two years.
Dead-to-Rights was engulfed by the shafts of
the sewerage works for eight hours a day. His
broad frame was made tough iron by the pick he
swung hour after hour, and when he was vomited
forth at five—hot, wet, and yellow from head to
foot—the clear air and the sunlight itself were no
more welcome to him than the greeting of the
little girl who danced towards him and hugged his
knees.
Dead-to-Rights never knew there was so much
in the game as during those few months he
remained honest. Plis earnings seemed wonder-
ful ; accustomed as he was to consider himself
well-off with a silver watch pawnable for five
shillings. His mind was easy ; his movements
ran into a new channel; he began to forget that
all men were either victims to spoil or accomplices
to suspect. He learned the marvellous fact that
there were some persons in the world not
“crooked” when it paid them. He even began
to feel that the policeman on the beat was not
necessarily an enemy. He walked on air. The
second phase of the transformation-scene had
commenced. The sprites and gnomes and owls
had given place to glowing tropical flowers and
gleaming fountains and jewelled beauties—and
clowns, muking the world shriek with laughter.
“ What sort ? ” Dead-to-Rights asked himself,
ecstatically.
Then little Sugar began to c?ry in the night
without reason, and the day saw her heavy-eyed
and with interest in nothing. Dead-to-Rights—■
the fearless Dead-to-Rights, the callous and brutal
ruffian who had spat in the flagellator’s face after
getting his 25 at Pentridge—shivered like a sap-
ling. At the Children’s Hospital next morning,
with Sugar in his arms, he learned that she might
die. Dead-to-Rights blubbered in the doctor’s
face and strode through the files of waiting women
like a drunken man. In the tram going home he
scandalised the passengers and alarmed the pale
conductor by blaspheming loudly and hideously
at one who had left the door open. At his job he
cut open the foreman’s scalp with a shovel when
he was taken to task for coming late. He left his
work with feverish haste to be at the bedside of
little Sugar. A week and another followed, with
the man sitting like a lumbering, ugly statue at
the cot where his child lay battling with the inevi-
table. Then the mother pointed to the pot empty
and cold, when the doctor said it should be filled
with warm beef-tea.
Dead-to-Rights went out. The Angel received
him with open arms, and unfolded to him another
scheme, sweeter and safer even than the one
before. Dead-to-Rights was scarcely interested.
He never troubled about details; the Angel would
plan every point, provide for every contingency,
leave openings at every step for a retreat. Dead-
to-Rights only wanted to know what was to be got,
and where —he would do the rest!
He did it* Did it with sheer fearlessness arid
force) and utter disregard of the generalship of
the astute Angel; and was richer than any twenty
Jobs in his career had made him before-. The
Angel’s part of the scheme was only half-done.
The transmutation of their hew possessions into
gold had yet to be accomplished ; but Dead-to-
Rights was impatient. He rehaembered Little
Sugar sick to death and wanting food. With him
the job terminated at the nearest pawnshop, and
the beef-tea was brought ih triumph to the bedside
of the child;
The hours passed, and she writhed ih a VfestleSS
sleep. The Cave Man Stared fixedly into her
face and toyed nervously with the cup. Then the
eyes of the child opened, dull and uncomprehend-
ing, and she turned her lips away when the cup
approached. Again and again the drink was
forced on her, and each time she fought weakly
and peevishly—and won. Dead-to-Rights sank
into his chair, helpless and despairing, as a knock
sounded from the front-door. The man remem-
bered then that he had. heard strange noises at the
back, and the combination was one that explained
itself too well.
“Are you going to open the door, or shall I
have to smash it in ? ” It was Detective-Sergeant
O’Brien’s voice. Dead-to-Rights had heard it
first in ’BB, then in ’9O, then in ’94. It meant
trouble.
“By Christ! ” whispered Dead -to - Rights
through the fanlight. “I’ll swing for yer, before
yer get in here.”
Detective-sergeant O’Brien was not deficient in
courage. Even his fellow - detectives admitted
that. " But he saw no reason for unnecessary
.violence.
“There’s men at the back, too,” be called,
“and you’ve no chance—so you’d better open the
door and go quietly.”
Then Sugar began to cry weakly and shrilly,
and Dead-to-Rights forgot the police, and the
law, and himself—all 1 He was by tile bed, with
the child in his arms, as the door crashed in, and
the detective stood On the threshold, revolver in
hand. It took him a full minute to grasp the
situation. Then he seated himself on a chair at
the door and watched. Sergeant O’Brien was a
man with a heart, ahd a few hours here or there
are nothing in any department of the police-
service. So he just Waited. He saw the matt
hold the candle to the child’s face every few
seconds, ahd saw the face grow paler ahd older at
each illumination. He saw the mart throw his
arms about the child and kiss it, and he heard the
man call upon his gods-for help, and curse them
for their apathy. Then the man stopped suddenly
in his raving. He lifted the tiny sandy head
again, and, as he raised the Candle, the face fell
forward.
Then Dead-to-Bights cried out horribly, and
fell on the bed With ri e dead child.
He was there for a iohg time. Sergeant O’Brien
lost all the enthusiasm lie had when the night
started, and the cabman at the Corner was
beginning to wonder whether he had been mur-
dered. At last, the prisoner looked up, haggard
ahd pale, and ghastly as an anatomical exhibit }
and, tottering to the detective, he held up his
wrists side by side. The steel snapped across
them, and, as the men’s eyes met, O’Brien grasped
the fettered hands of the criminal and pressed
them within his own.

•Sidney Webb, lecturing in London, says
the oniy members ever seen in Q. Parliamentary
Library are the Labor members. Webb means
that to be a compliment to the Labor-members ;
but it may be complimentary or the reverse. In all
deliberative Assemblies, leaders and ripe thinkers
are rather conspicuous for (heir absence from the
public libraries. On the other hand, the super-
ficial amateur spends hours there copying extracts
from this book, that book and the other, which,
crude and undigested, he fires at his audience
under the impression that he will be taken as a
profound student of the subject in hand. Every
Parliament in Australia has its quota of the.-e
shallow pretenders.
Mandarin Hong You Wai, a member of
the Chinese Imperial Council of State, whose
death was decreed by the Chinese Empress for
inciting the puppet Emperor to favor “bar-
barian ” reforms, and who escaped from China
per medium of a handy British man-o’-war, is
now at Vancouver, 8.C., whence, per medium of
the Chinese Australian Herald, he invites his
fellow-countrymen in Australasia to put up a
dollar eacli to help to free China from the con-
servative domination of the Manchus. According
to Hong You Wai’s appeal, it is rather a good
thing to be a Manchu in China. They belong to
the same race as the ruling dynasty, and hold
almost every State sinecure. Besides, every
Manchu, man, woman, and child, whether in
State employ or not, is entitled to a pension of
about Bs. per month ; and if the common Chinkie
isn’t very respectful indeed to this superior caste
he meets with something sudden. The Sydney
Chinamen are most anxious to have a dollar’s
worth of patriotism, but the movement is some-
what hampered by the vision of what would hap-
pen to a subscriber to the fund if he were to visit
China and find the Empress still on the Ptacoclt
throne.
“ Ringer ” to The Bulletin :
Militarism (or Jingoism) will, in the near future,
be recognised as an infectious disease of the most
virulent type. Without such theory it would he
impossible for us in the interior of Australia to account
for the present awful outburst on the coast. Australian
fair play is a waning virtue if we are to he judged by
our newspaper reports on this Transvaal business.
Before the war we were informed by the most reliable
authorities that the full strength of the Transvaal and
Free State troops combined was 21,000, with a maximum
of 31,000 (this latter was said to be an over-estimate).
England has at present at least 64,000 in the field, and
there are many thousands more at sea on their way to tffe"
same destination. They are armed with weapons of
destruction beside which the Boer guns and shells are
harmless. (By the way, were not asphyxiating shells
condemned by the great Peace Conference? Lyddite
kills by asphyxia when its explosive foree is spent:
it also kills by poisoning food and water within a
radius of 75 to 100yds. of the exploded shell.) With
all kinds of odds thus against him the Boer so far
has made a good stand for home and country.
Is it because of this stand that the population
of coastal Australia is shrieking for his blood ? To the
bush mind the martial spirit, shown h.v your city braves is
only comparable to the ardor with which a mob of blacks’
dogs attack a wounded’roo. But as I said at the start,
we, far away from the Jingo epidemic, must see things in
a different light altogether. For instance, we view the
man who uses the white flag to cover a retreat (perhaps
in ignorance) as less cowardly than he who takes advan-
tage of a proclaimed truce to attack an enemy whom he
could not otherwise heat. The coast resident in his pre-
sent frame of mind only sees treachery in the man with
the white flag. Again, you fellows “outside ” will excuse
us if we discover a certain amount of heroism in the
action of the eight Boers who stood out to be shot to en-
able their comrades to take up position. The big dailies
show their contempt for sucli trifles by printing them in
small type, while the English boy who shot three of the
flying enemy gets a heading of capitals. When the in-
evitable reaction sets in perhaps some Government in the
group—or, better, the Federal Parliament—plight offer a
prize for the discovery of the bacillus of Jingoism'.

WM. MAHER.
Don’t Neglect a Common Case
of Piles.
IT MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS RESULTS.
When people generally understand that all such
fatal diseases as fistula, ulcer of the rectum,
fissure, etc., almost invariably begin in a simple
case of piles, they will learn the wisdom of taking
prompt treatment for the first appearance of
trouble in this quarter. Doan’s Ointment will
certainly cure every form of piles—itching, bleed-
ing, protruding, and blind piles—and hundreds of
lives have been saved by using this cheap but
effective remedy right at the start because at such
times a single pot will effect a cure, while in the
old, deep-seated, chronic cases several pots are
sometimes necessary before a cure is effected.
Here is a case in point :
Mr. William Gilliver, of the well-known firm of
Gilliver and Curtis, Railway and General Con-
tractors, and whose private address is “ Avoca,”
Bankstovni, has written the following unsolicited
letter which we herewith publish in full.
Messrs. FOSTER-McCLELLAN CO.,
76 Pitt-st., Sydney.
Feb. 14 th, 1899.
Dear Sirs,; —In justice to you and suffering
humanity I write to say that I suffered from
itching piles for 22 years. I tried many doctors
and pretty well all kinds of patent medicines, blit
got relief for a short time only. Seeing your
Ointment advertised I bought a pot—and did not
use more than one-half of it, now six months ago
—and lam perfectly cured. You may use this as
you wish. —Yours gratefully,
WILLIAM GILLIVER.
It cannot be repeated too often that Doan’s
Ointment will cure itching piles. IT WILL
CURE THEM ABSOLUTELY. But do not
take the manufacturer’s word for this; ask or
write Mr. Gilliver. He knows, for it cured him,
and he lives at Bankstown, a suburb 12 miles
from Sydney. Is not that the best possible kind
of proof ? Could there be better ?
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all dealers at 2s 9d
per box, or will be posted on receipt of price by
the proprietors, Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt
st., Sydney,
But—be sure it is DOAN’S.

Here in the tropic haze the gallant sun
Unto the Lady Moon gives Courtier place—
The velvet stars look out, and one by one
Take on a kind and softly steadfast grace.
The orange perfume swoons within the bud —
Love makes his nest and foldeth up his wing—
Mere passion hath been chastened in the blood ;
The love hath come that makes the Winter—
Spring !
The frangipanni and the wild musk vie;
The silver scrub is threaded by a spark
Where the quick fireflies flame their hour, and die,
And vanish in the dark.
And so this orange scent brings to the sense
The years long gone when love first to me came
And said unto me, “Live, indeed, from hence.”
And filled my heart and veins and blood with
flame.
Into the lonely island of my youth
Long years agone, a true heart came a-land
And left me glad and wondering at the truth,
Like Crusoe at the footprint on the sand.
Once did I,say in pride and boyish scorn
That Love’s contempt should give me no alarms,
Saying, “ More fit that fame my brows adorn :
The world is wider than a woman’s arms !
“ The world is wider than her arms—and Power,
And Learning and Revenge have greater bliss ” —
Pardon, most sweet ! I knew not all thy dower,
That Power and Learning live within thy kiss.
I gave my careless love as : brindled dawn
Gives the red sun to man and all his kith ;
And found me gyves that never may be sawn
Come from the careless forgings of the smith.
The sweetness of thy speech around me floated
Soft as high thought and gone ere I might seize—
Liquescent, low-voiced, tender, honey-throated—
Soft as the shore kiss of sustaltic seas.
And yet, oh first voice ! —heard at the first by
chance —
For ever echoest thou in my heart alone,
As though Asaph, by Love’s old necromance,
Had made one note a surging sea of tone.
All love’s intriguing foes did straightway go—
My galleons of pleasure ’neath the tide
Evanished with their crews—my sins below
Sank with my foundered argosies of pride.
My life was dust and ashes in the fire,
And waste as wasted water from the mill;
My soul—an instrument thou didst inspire ;
My heart, an empty cup which thou didst fill.
We built a city of our love, and lo !
God straightway sent new suns on it to shine ;
We peopled it with our beliefs, and so
One-half the folk is yours—one-half is mine.
The poem of the first impassioned illusion
Is dumb —for its recall we may not crave ;
For marriage is love’s baptism, chrism, and
fusion ;
Not the sad consecration of its grave.
Ever by deed, or thought, or word of mouth,
We find again the days behind us cast —
We see again old seasons’ bud and blowth—
We lift the shining eymar of the past.
As light is wedded to its co-mate heat—
So am I wed to thee in age and youth ;
As form is blent and into substance beat;
As goodness welded into highest Truth.
Clean Love ! the marrow and the core of life !
The flesh ! the blood ! the pulse ! the high de-
light !
The generous selfishness of man and wife !
The strange familiarity of the night!
The unlike likeness, and the kindly ire—
Receipt by giving, and a madness wise—
Victorious surrender ! unconsuming fire 1
The intelligible, inarticulate eyes.
Rolling and growing as stars do grow in space,
Finding the recreant feet each day new mesh—
The flower of glory from the bud of grace—
The honeyed linguals of sweet flesh to flesh.
Love’s gift is only his who love can keep ;
It takes up its own home, or lives a waif !
Vain to cage love—it leaves you while you sleep,
And goes where it belongs, and so is safe.
Vain to bind love with fetters, or with cords,
Vain, if its home be not with you, are vows—
Vain, if its roof be not your roof, are words—
Vain the proprietary kiss between the brows.
And God hath no respect for any man
Except he love ! The Dead Heart shall not win !
Except he truly love, for him the ban —
And no respect for any man hath sin.
"bit unto us, though Time the eye may dim,
The quick flush fade —the God-like strength be
spent;
Our love knows yet no ship to transport him
From his old messuage and tenement.
Nor comes the day wherein our misty eyes,
Seeing our dead beliefs, shed bitter rain ;
Seeing the stains and sherds of our old Paradise,
Like perished pictures oii a broken pane.
When all beliefs were wrecked I held but one—
When sad the shore and haggard grew the sea,
When fret and trouble blotted out the sun,
I held fast to my troth and trust in thee !
Thy love hath given my soul the calm of trees—
The peace of cypresses bathed in the moon,
When all the world knows never any breeze,
And earth lies stark to sky in Danae swoon.
Thy love hath given me peace—so high ! so deep!
Mv heart hath nested and his wing is furled.
—just at the dawn I watch thee in thy sleep.
And, watching thee asleep, I watch my world !

A Trick of Fate’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fallen tree held Jasper with a firm but tender
grip. When he recovered consciousness he found
himself lying face-downwards under the great
butt, preserved from immediate death by the
broken end of a stout limb which was driven into
the ground on his right, and had allowed the
trunk to pin him securely without damaging his
bones to any extent. The weight of the upper
part of the tree was balanced on this stump, and
on the elbow of another limb a few yards from the
head of the prostrate man.
From his shoulder-blades to his loins Dick
Jasper was gripped with a firm, insistent pres-
sure, the pressure exerted upon a captive mouse
by the clawless, velvet paw of a playful cat.
There was a pain in his right side, proclaiming a
broken rib, and his head bled a little from the
blow that had stunned him and preserved him for
a more dramatic conclusion.
Within reach lay his loaded gun, and on a
branch near was perched the native bear towards
which his attention was directed when the burn-
ing tree struck him down. The joey was clinging
to her shoulder, and the two were staring at him
with round, unblinking eyes—staring with a
stupid solemnity that Jasper found to be most
exasperating in the course of an hour or so.
Meanwhile the hollow trunk was burning
fiercely. There was a draught through, and the
low, vibrant murmuring of the flame was con-
tinual, and in due time begot in Jasper a
quaint belief that there was a waterfall inside his
head. Before night came down the miserable
man had worn his voice to a reedy whjsper calling
for help. No help came, the Hills were full of
echoes, the voices of the bush were mocking,
merciless, and the monkey bear and her little one
sat immovable amongst the drooping leaves, star-
ing at hjm, the light of the fire reflected in their
small, beady eyes. '
Jasper found leisure for many curious ideas, bub
the one to which he was most attached was the
belief that the horror that had come upon him was
entirely due to the bear with the fatuous face and
the round eyes, in which he discovered a human
malignity. He forgot his deadly danger in his
hatred of the animal that sat gloating upon him,
and suddenly remembering his gun, uttered a
shrill cry of joy. He drew the gun to him care-
fully, and, with much cunning, took deliberate
aim and fired, killing the mother on the spot and
breaking the leg of the joey. The little animal
crept towards him uttering plaintive cries, and he
seized it and killed it with his bare hands
By daylight next morning he began to feel the
heat of the fire. He thirsted like a damned soul,
and suffered in anticipation all the agonies of a
slow and horrible death. Presently a black mon-
grel dog came trotting out of the scrub on his left.
Hope blazed in his soul at the sight of it, and he
called to it with whispered endearments. The
dog drew near, smelling at the body of the
bear, and Jasper tried to coax it with raucous
whispers. He had a foolish hope of inducing the
dog to scratch away the dirt about his body.
But when the brute saw him he snarled, and crept
away. He snatched his gun, and his voice broke
in a ridiculous squeal of rage as the dog fled. Dick
had his finger on the trigger, but he did not fire.
Recollection came to him, and he put the gun
down again with unnecessary caution, and tkere
was a strange and ominous expression in the face
of the doomed wretch. He realised that the
charge in the left barrel was his dearest posses-
sion.
The fire stole nearer and nearer, and Richard
Jasper’s torments grew into an anguish unspeak-
able, and at lengtH unbearable. He had cocked
the gun, and placed it directly in front of him,
the muzzle to his forehead, the butt against a rock
projecting from the ground. He had chosen to
die quickly, if die he must.
A little flame ran along some loose bark and
set fire to his coat. Jasper lifted his head and
looked about, a last hopeless searching for help.
He saw no living thing. His clothing was burn-
ing, the fire ate into his flesh. With steady hands
he turned the trigger against an edge of the rock,
and keeping the muzzle to his head, jerked it for-
ward smartly.
After the explosion, Richard Jasper lay still.
A second later the burning butt of the tree, over-
balanced now by the weight of the bougks, rose
slowly upwards to the height of about 10 inches,
then went up with a jerk, leaving the body lying
free upon the grass below.
EDWARD DYSON.
“ Steff” : Recently heard following from
a young Maori (son of an ex-chief) on the Trans-
vaal trouble. “Isay te Bor is quite right ;he
just te same as te Maori—he is only fighting for
his land. Te Whiti tell us at Parihaka that one
day te Maori rise up like one brother and take
back all they not got now. I say te Bor is just te
same as te Maori ; he rise up like one brother to
fight for isself. Will any gentlemans buy me a
beer ? ” -
Chief-Justice Onslow, of Westralia, says
it isn’t our duty to inquire into the justice or
otherwise of the Boer war—that matter was
attended to “by Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour.”
So, presumedly, if Onslow saw' Lord Salisbury and
Mr. Balfour jumping on an infant, Onslow would
go and jump too. An alleged man, or jellyfish,
whose theory is that we shouldn’t have any soul of
our own, but should hold that whatever Salisbury
and Balfour do is right, couldn’t do otherwise
than jump.
The tired political feeling which comes of
seeing the same crowd too long at the loaves and
fishes has given some new words to the Australian
language. The cry of the Tories in Maoriland
is that they believe in Liberalism, but that “ Sed-
donisin ” is abhorrent to them. “Seddonism”
presumably means the anguish caused by Seddon
getting the salary instead of the other fellow.
“Reidism” was becoming a current w'ord in
N.S.W. before Reid drifted off the stage, and now
a Melbourne Tory paper rises to state that Victoria
had grown weary of “ Turnerism.” This habit of
charging Premier Smith with the dreadful sin of
“Smithism ” suggests poverty of invention.
Herbert Spencer, the philosopher, in a
letter to Leonard Courtney :
I rejoice that you and others are bent on showing that
there are some among us who think the national honor
is not being enhanced Dy putting down the weak. Would
that age and ill-health did not prevent me from aiding.
No one can deny that at the time of the Jameson raid
the aim of the Uitlanders and the raiders was to usurp the
Transvaal Government. He must be wilfully blind who
does not see that what the Uitlanders failed to do by
bullets they hope presently to do by votes, and only
those who, while jealous of their own independence, re-
gard but little the independence of people who stand in
their way can fail to sympathise with the lloers in then-
resistance to political extinction.
When a man gets interested in his business he
is very liable to forget about himself.
And when backache comes —when he feels de-
pressed and out of sorts, he contents himself with
the thought that he has worked too hard—he will
let up some of these days, when he gets the busi-
ness going a little better.
But he DOESN’T let up.
The backache gets worse and worse. The
doctor says “ Nervous Prostration ” —advises a
trip to Tasmania or New Zealand.
But is it nervous prostration ? No, it is the
kidneys. They can’t stand the strain put upon
them—they need help—they must have help if
serious trouble is to be prevented.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have helped
thousands of hard-worked men and women here
in Australia to do their work easily, and keep
their health through it all. Here is an instance :
Mr. Maher, whose picture is given above, is an
old resident of Melbourne, living at 241 Latrobe-
street. “My back had been very bad,” says Mr.
Maher, “up to a year ago. It not only pained
me severely, but was so weak that I could scarcely
stand straight. The pains were located in the
small of the back, over the kidneys.
“That was one evidence thatmy kidneys were out
of order, but the other evidence was plainer. The
kidney secretions were of a very high colour, and
unnatural in quantity. I want to say that I have
not only obtained relief from the kidney trouble,
but I AM CURED, and Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills are alone responsible for this. I have
had no return of my trouble now for some months,
since taking them, and am thankful to feel I am
all right again. You may publish this as it is
true, and it may do good to others.”
(Signed) William Maher.
It would be well if doctors and everyone who
has any kidney trouble, would carefully read the
above straightforward statement.
When your kidneys are not doing their work, it
will be manifested by‘‘'pain or dull ache in the
back, rheumatic pains, sciatica sediment in the
urine, scanty supply, scalding irritation in
passing, obliged to go often during the day and to
get up during the night, uric acid, sleeplessness,
nervousness, irritability, sallow, unhealthy com-
plexion, puffy or dark circles under the eyes, loss
of energy and ambition.
If your water, when allowed to remain undis-
turbed for twenty-four hours, forms a sediment or
settling, or has a cloudy appearance, it is evidence
that your kidneys and bladder need immediate
attention.
If you have any of the above symptoms Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills will set you right and cure
you. We will gladly send you the names of
thousands who have testified to what Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have, done for them. No-
where does the proverb “ Delays are dangerous 15
apply with such force as in kidney derangement.
When Bright's Disease has set in the kidney
tissues are breaking down and passing away every
minute. The strength of the body is sapped,
steadily, surely.
Inasmuch as Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
alone stop kidney derangement should they not
be used without an hour’s delay when the above
symptoms give unmistakeable warnings ?

"I wish to say to every one that I have used a great deal of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla in my family. I believe it is the best family medicine there i 3
in the world.
“ Once, while I was on a vessel trading to the East Indies and also while I
was living in Calcutta, I used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for impurities in my blood,
and with the best results. I always took a stock of it with me when I went on
my voyages. I could not feel safe without it. For eruptions of the skin, boils,
and such affections it is a quick and sure cure. I recommend it to everybody
suffering from impurities in the blood, showing itself in any way whatsoever.”
This is what Mr. W. A. Lindsay (whose portrait, with that of his wife and
child, is here given), of Stanthorpe, Queensland, Australia, thinks of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. Because of the multitude of such cases, the people call Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine. n
Because some other preparation may be called a sarsaparilla is not the
slightest reason that it is anything like “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. If you wish
these quick results, these safe results, these sure results, you must insist upon
getting “Ayer’s.” Make a particular point of this.

PASTEURISED
BUTTER •• •
The same remarks that apply to milk apply equally to butter. Pasteurised butter is made from the very finest
cream, consequently the butter has a fine aroma that only Pasteurisation can give. There are a few, we are
pleased to say, only a_few, idiotic folks who will not be convinced of the value of the process ; but it is satisfactorv
to know that these are getting less daily. The difference in price between Pasteurised, beautifully-flavored butter and the
ordinary make is only i|d. per lb. It would pay consumers well to give six times this difference. Heads of households should insist
that their grocer supplies Pasteurised butter, and if he will not, send your Orders to US, and we will deliver it at your doors
Good butter such as we have described is appreciated always, whereas at afternoon
at any price. The famous “ Berry ” brand Pasteurised butter can be ob +^ — J -
