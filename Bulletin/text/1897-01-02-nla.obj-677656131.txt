‘MARY, PITY WOMEN 1*

You done the worst you know.

You—you ’ave brung the 'arm.

An’ now you’ll off an’ run
With some new fool in tow.

You can say little more to Dyson than “ Wel-
come I’’ His merits are obvious ; his defects, in
comparison, are nob. Though he flies neither
▼ery high nor on a very strong pinion, his work is
generally pleasant and sometimes impressive.
And Dyson takes pains to do his best. Selecting
from memory some incident, some scene, pathetic
or humorous, he tells its story or paints its picture
in well-pondered measure, with the aid of vivid
epithets or graphic vernacular. The field he
treads has hardly been skirted by earlier bards,
who seem merely interested spectators of the
miner at his work. Dyson, once miner himself,
knows his subject to the foot of the letter. His
area of experience, indeed, is limited to the
methods of a rather primitive sluicing and reefing
in Victoria ; but mining operations are generically
the same everywhere, and the manager of the most
modern winding-plant can thrill to the pioture of
“The Old Whim Horse” whom some strange
memory impels to plod round the whim-path of
the long-deserted mine—
He hears in the sluices the water rushing
As the buckets drain and the doors fall baok:
When the early dawn in the east is blushing,
He is limping still round the old, old traok.
Now he pricks his ears, with a neigh replying
To a call unspoken, with eyes aglow,
And he sways and sinks in the cirole, dying ;
Prom the ring no more will the grey horse go.
And even a modern cyanider can enjoy the de-
scription of Finn’s far-back mill—
All the heads are different sires, and the horses
Are so crazy that the whole caboodle rocks,
And eaoh time a stamper thunders down it forces
Little spirtings through the crannies in the box.
then the feed-pipe's mostly plugged and aggravating,
And the pump it suffers badly from a cough ;
Every hour or so they burst a blooming grating,
And the shoes are nearly always coming off.
She goes biff, puff, bang, bump, olitter-clatter, smash,
And she rattles on for halt a shift, and lets up with a crash ;
Then silence reigns a little while, and all the land is still
While they’re tinkering awkward patches on the tin-pot
mill.
, * » *
Dyson’s youthful lot was cast amid a fine com-
munity of Austral Cornishmen, and some of his
best pictures in prose and verse are made of the
lights and shadows of the Cornish character. The
devout Brother Peetree made his bow in The
Bulletin not long ago—
Brother Peetree always Started with a murmured sup-
plication,
Knelt beside a form, serenely, with a meek, submissive
face;
But he rose by certain stages to a rolling exhortation,
And a wild, ecstatic bellowing for sanotity and grace;
And he threw his arms to Heaven, and the seats went
down before him
As he fought his way along the aisle, and prayed with
might and main,
With hysterical beseeohings. Then a sudden peace fell
o’er him,
And he finished, sobbing softly, at his starting-point
again.
And the elders, to their ears pale with reverential fears,
And the sisters and the ohoir indulged in hot, repentant
tears ;
And the sinners for salvation did with eagerness declare,
When beloved Brother Peetree wrestled mightily in
prayer.
“ The Trucker,” one of Dyson’s early contribu-
tions to The Bulletin, remains among the
strongest pieces in the new book. There are
some good lines in “ The Prospectors,” now first
printed :
As the soft breeze stirs all ths tender green of the bush
that is newly born,
And the wattles blaze on the flats and gladden the hills
with the glow of morn,
We are trenching high in the stony slopes, or turning the
creeks below,
Or the gorge re-echoes the thud of picks and the songs
that the miners know.
When the lode strips clean with a yellow sheen our for-
tunes are fairly won ;
When the dish pans bare, up with tent and ware, and
hurrah ! for the outward run.
• • * •
The pleasant task of tasting may end with a
stanza or two from “The Worked-Out Mine”—
The engine-house is dark and still,
The life that raged within has fled ;
Like open graves the boilers chill
That once with glowing fires were red;
Above the shaft in measured pace
A rotted rope swings to and fro,
Whilst o’er the plat and on the braoe
The silent shadows come and go.
Ah 1 woeful mine, where wives have wept,
And mothers prayed in anxious pain,
And long, distracting vigil kept,
You yawn for victims now in vain !
Still to that god, whose shrine you were.
Is homage done in wild device;
Men hate you as the sepulchre
That stores their bloody sacrifice.
+.
Really, as Jeffrey said (we hdpe it was Jeffrey),
“ this will never do.” Mr. Gay grows too
irritating. Mr. Gay is a Victorian writer of
verses. About a year ago he published some
of his verses—sonnets. Simultaneously a flock
of paragraphs rose in the air and settled on
the newspapers, reciting how Mr. Gay was a poor
and hopeless invalid on a sick-bed, who, while
rapidly proceeding from Gay to grave, solaced his
dying hours by dictating poems to his nurse.
Therefore, buy Gay’s poems, price two bob.
• * * *
A particularly harrowing paragraph, as Mr.
Gay admits, settled on The Bulletin, and was
duly printed in black ink and sympathy. But
objection was made at the time to the fashion of
ad misericordiam pleas in literature. Mr. Gay, it
was declared, should keep his deathbed out of his
poetry : the Muse must walk on her own legs, not
on charitable crutches. And Mr. Gay protested
that he had been misunderstood.
♦ * * *
Well, nearly a year has passed, and The Bul-
letin is glad to hear that Mr. Gay’s funeral
seems as far off as ever. If he is dying, he is
only dying as fast as the rest of us. We are all
shorn by the same scythe, and there really seems
no reason why any particular little blossom
should discount its obituary praises in advance.
* * * •
Anyhow, nearly a year has passed, and Mr.
Gay bobs up again with another little book of
verses—price half-a-orown this time. And, sure
enough, here is the old flock of deathbed advts.
back again. One of them struck The Bulletin,

Now, Air. Gay. will doubtless repudiate respon-
sibility for this kind °f thmg , ! t
not silence his claque? And why does he set
literary teeth on edge by offering his new volume
to a host of bet hanked patrons, as thus—

have presumably sent flattering letters or bananas.
“ Gratitude by all means ; but why don t men
do these things in private? What is there m
literature more hateful than the advt. ot
cheap literary Maecenas?
• * * *
And so it goes on, with a beautiful unan-
imity of back - scratclu is. Drunton Stephens
says Gay’s sonnets are “ worthy to be pre-
served among the treasures of the language :
Gay retorts by another sonnet which calls
B.S. “eldest and first of Austral singers,
and claims kinship (1) because they are both
poets—more or less ; (2) they are both Scotch
—entirely ; (3) they are both going to die sooner
or later. The Misses M. E. and H. A. Sampson
are thanked for “much kindness,” and there is a
sonnet to Miss A. M. Sampson (deceased). Again
—by all means; but why advertise the names ?
Mr. Gay has plenty of literary instinct: why will
he not avoid even the appearance of bartering
the Muse’s favors for woollen comforters ?
* * • *
Some people say it is in bad taste to write like
this; but in how much worse taste is it to give
reason for writing like this ? One’s pen moves
unwillingly ; but more duty is owed to Literature
than to the litterateur. And Mr. Gay is quite
good enough poet to rely on public appreciation,
without permitting his friends to clamor for
public charity. “ Christ on Olympus,” indeed,
is a mere mouthing of sonorities—a nothing ; but
one or two of the accompanying sonnets are
fair (most have the expression of a man who
is walking with his wife); and two or three of the
miscellaneous verses are rather better in a level,
monotonous manner, easily pardoned to a weak-
pulsed mger. “ The War of the Ghosts ” suggests
Stevenson, but the thought is well handled ; and
—here is another rendering of the Love and Death
idea. [The versions run now : G. F. Watts —
Love friend; Death enemy. Syd. Jepheott:
Love and Death, both friends. Wm. Gay : Love
enemy, Death friend. Room for one more bard
or artist with : Love and Death, both enemies.]
There is a pretty set of figures called “ A Sea
Maiden,” whereof one verse—
Her breath in sweets doth more abound
Than fragrant equatorial gales,
Her voice is pleasant as the sound
Of rising winds in idle sails—
may be quoted for the pleasure of disagreeing
with Melb. Abgus dictum that “gales” ruins the
simile. “Only a very boisterous breath indeed
should be brought into comparison with a gale.’’
But there is no violence about the poetic gale •
when Burns wrote of lovers breathing their tender
tale “beneath the milk-white thorn that scents
the evening gale,” he wasn’t referring to a hurri-
cane; and in Mr. Gay’s verse the idea of frag-
rance is paramount.

Norman Gale is only a minor poet, but there is
a fresh, open-air fragrance about his milkmaids
and buttercups often more satisfying to the soul
than the psychological balancings of better brains.
He is fine and physical, a Pan-worshipper who
woos naiads in brooks and nymphs on haycocks—
sweats in the sunshine and sings when the
harvest-moon glows red over the trees. His
high spirits are catching and tonicky. Lately he
has issued a pretty book of children’s verses, full
of dainty line illustrations which admirably match
the print. Author is much indebted to artist, yet
artist s name is not mentioned for praising. Some
examples of the skill of both will surely be wel-

printed that it pains the eye. It is time, too, to
protest against the fashion of padding books with
advertising sheets, no matter on what bad British
precedent founded. One wants one’s poetry, at all
events, “unmixed with baser matter.”
THE PURSUIT.

And I did flee from Death—
“ O Love, I burn, I die for thee! **
I cried with anguished breath.
“ O Death, I fear thy dark pursuit I
O Love, I burn, I die !
O Death, withhold thy evil foot!
O Love, no longer fly ! ”
Then Love no longer fled, but turned
And stabbed me through and through ;

My pains did all Bubdue*

COLDS ON THE CI [EST, BRON-
v iS u AND ,ASTHMA RAPIDLY
IuKLD hi Hearne s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
* most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently Die diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne's Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

Dr. GIBBONTS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
SPECIAL DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
man y years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men
who suffer from any of the following symptoms,
namely : —Frequent headaches, giddiness, drowsi-
ness in the daytime, irregularity of the bowels,
feeling of fullness after eating, specks before the
eyes, halos or circles round a candle, cold hands
and feet, pains in the back or under the shoulder-
blade, tenderness of the breast-bone on pressure,
palpitation of the heart, clammy hands, an
aversion to society, a fear of something dreadful
about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, ftc.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life long misery.
On Receipt oe 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all SPECIAL DISEASES
may be quickly and permanently CURED,
without loss of time and money. This book
will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send

NECESSARY FOR THE CURE,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest

PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all'impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelaide, October 30, 1886.
Baron Berzilius’——
—==-Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS* REPORT.
These Bitters I recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chromo
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. : —The B.tter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB-I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my talcing two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
1 hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.

All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of (he Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
Uke ROW’S STEANET WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to al
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

and remanded on another charge. Once in prison
it required a Judge’s order to get him out to be
tried on the second charge. Eventually the
magistrates had to reconsider the sentence and
amend it to a fortnight’s lock-up so that they
could lay hands on him on the second charge.

A Small Side Issue.
Despite the fact that the Federation pro-
blem has been discussed more or less con-
tinuously all over these provinces for the last
six years there is one strictly practical aspect
of it which, so far as The Bulletin is aware,
has not yet been even mentioned. There
has been much poetry shed on the question,
and much straggling eloquence, and much
high-flown imagery about Australia’s “ des-
tiny ’’—whatever a “destiny” may be—and
many other things ; but the purely business-
like side of the case has been considerably
neglected. Therefore the Federal delegates
are likely to go to the Convention with no
definite instructions on certain points about
which their instructions should be very
definite indeed. Most of these points relate
to finance, which is the weak side of all
Australasian Governments. Federation im-
plies, among other things, the establishment
of a central authority which will take over
and consolidate the public debts of the
several provinces, and convert them, as
opportunity offers, into one stock at a uni-
form low rate of interest, with one central
authority in London to manage the business.
The provincial Legislatures will be relieved,
in one act, of their great financial incubus’
which will be shifted on to the broader
shoulders and, it is to be hoped, the more
comprehensive brain, of the Commonwealth
Government. And the question which no
one seems to have asked as yet is whether
the provincial authorities will then be allowed
to commence piling up a new debt apiece to
replace the one they have lost, or whether
the power of borrowing money shall be
absolutely and permanently taken from
them. The Bulletin is of opinion,
for many good reasons, that it should be
taken from them. The general idea, judging
from the fact that no one has yet raised the
question, seems to be that the blessed privi-
lege of running in debt and accumulating
future insolvency remains as a matter of
course.
This paper’s contention is, and always has
been, that borrowing, if logically permissible
at all, is permissible only for the construction
of works which yield a direct revenue to pay,
or partly pay, the interest on loans. Bor-
rowing for roads, bridges, lock-ups, guns,
ammunition, gaols, lunatic asylums, statues,
public offices, art-galleries, museums, dredg-
ing-works and the like is pure, unmitigated
fraud ; it is a device to avoid the necessary
taxation or the necessary retrenchment in
order to make ends meet —a scheme by which
unscrupulous and incompetent Treasurers
get credit for bogus surpluses and keep up
an appearance of sham prosperity, and
thereby disguise their own incapacity.
None of these things produce revenue, or
are really assets in any fair sense of the
term. The roads require to be kept in re-
pair ; the bridges not only need to be kept
in repair but need periodical replacement ;
so do the lock-ups, gaols, and miscellaneous
buildings ; the dredging that is done to-day
needs shortly to be done over again to keep
pace with the continuous process of silting-
up. None of these things are assets, because
they are not saleable ; in fact, they are
liabilities because they involve a continuous
outlay for maintenance and supervision.
And as every year there are old struc-
tures wearing out which have to be re-
placed by new ones, the bridge and
lock-up and gaol and public office and other
items are as distinctly part of the regular
annual expenditure as the salaries of the
Civil Service. The theory that a bridge is a
permanent work which has only to be paid
for once and is done with, and which may,
therefore, be fairly charged to posterity, is
the thinnest fraud imaginable. It will be
necessary to go on building bridges at the
present rate for a century or so before the
country is sufficiently opened up, and long
before the work is finished the old structures
will want rebuilding, and before that is
finished, in another century or so, another
general rebuilding will be due, and so on ad
infinitum,.
* * * *
Almost the only works of any size which
can fairly be charged to loans are railways
and telegraphs. These will be taken over,
along with the existing debts, by the Federal
Government, and it will look after future
extensions, therefore it will also look after
any future borrowing for extension purposes.
If war or invasion should come this way, and
it be absolutely necessary to raise money for
purposes of bloodshed, that matter will also
belong to the Federal Government. There-
fore, almost the only purpose for which the
Provincial Governments can want to borrow
money is the old swindle of making a bogus
surplus by charging current expenses to
loans. They will have practically no repro-
ductive works to invest borrowed money in,
therefore they have no honest reason or ex-
cuse for borrowing at all, and there is no
visible reason why they should have any
borrowing powers whatever. The division of
power between the federal and provincial
authorities offers the bestpossible opportunity
to draw a sharp line between legitimate and
illegitimate loan expenditure. The federal
authority won’t have charge of roads and
bridges, therefore it can’t fool away loan
moneys on these prolific sources of swindle,
even if it would. The provincial authorities
will have charge only of practically unpro-
ductive works, which should not be charged
to loans, therefore it has no honest necessity
for any powers of loan-mongering whatso-
ever.
* * * *
If the Provincial Governments retain their
present borrowing powers they will almost
inevitably start to accumulate new debts as
soon as they are relieved of the old ones.
Therefore, the first result of Federation will
be that there will be seven debts instead of
six, or six debts instead of five, as at pre-
sent, which is hardly the result that Austra-
lian unity was intended to produce. The
new provincial debts, not being backed by
the Federal credit, will not participate in the
general reduction of interest, consequently
this advantage will be partly nullified. The
Federal legislature will attract the best in-
tellects in Australian politics, and the men
who muddle the provincial debts will pro-
bably be of an even lower grade than
heretofore and considering the results
which past financiers have produced, this is
a truly awful consideration ; therefore, there
is all the more reason why their powers of
cooking the public accounts should be limited.
If Australia is ever going to straighten up
and try to live honestly, and be reasonably
independent and self-reliant, and if its Trea-
surers are ever going to rise above the level
of fraudulent bankers and perpetrators of
bogus balance-sheets, this is evidently the
time and the opportunity. Otherwise the
future history of Australia will probably be
one long record of borrowing by the Com-
monwealth Government, more borrowing by
the Provincial Governments, provincial in-
trigues to get the new local debts taken over
by the Commonwealth when they grow too
burdensome, and similar troubles. The
shortest way out of the difficulty is by the
insertion of a clause in the Constitution to
the eftect that the Provincial Governments
shall have no borrowing powers whatever.
And if this arrangement cannot be anived
at, the next best thing is to enact that no
future provincial debts contracted by any of
its members shall be taken over by the Com-
monwealth under any circumstances what-
Then there will be no surreptitious
shifting on to the nation at, large of local
road and bridge expenditure incurred with-
out any national authority; and any province
which overruns the constable can default
peacefully on its own without serious damage
to the Federal credit; and any province
which proposes to swear off - and live cleanly
in the future can abolish local borrowing by
enactment of its own Legislature, and secure
for itself the advantages of its own economy.
The question at issue is a small matter just
now. and one easily dealt with, but it wi
probably be a very large one by-and-bye it
decisive measures are not taken.
The Horrors of Protection.
The Sydney Telegraph man who writes the
weekly article on the Horrors of Protection in
Victoria has of late broken out very badly
indeed, and is making an awesome show of him-
self with great masses of his own manufactured
statistics. The said statistics are so wildly
absurd that it is impossible to suppose they
deceive anybody, even the writer, but they are
interesting as samples of importers’ logic. I he
following is a fine instance :
DIRECT COST OF CUSTOMS DUTIES
(Except Duties on Intoxicants and Narcotics).
Government revenue ... ... ••• £ 999 > 999
Gross profits of trades thereon ... ... 540,000
Increased price charged by protected manu-
facturers ... ... **• ••• 2,600,000
Importers’ gross profit on one-half thereof ... 260,000
Retailers’ gross profit on two-thirds thereof ... 664,000
Total cost ... ... ••• £4,964,000
The direct cost of protection to Victoria, therefore, is
£4,964,000 a year, and of this enormous sum only £900,000
is reaped by the Government, while over £4,000,000 goes
into the pockets of private people, or is as much wasted
as if it were used to pay men for digging holes and filling
them up again. On an average, therefore, every Vic-
torian man, woman, and child pays £4 4s. a year in purely
injurious Customs duties, or every father of a family—
—counting a family as six persons—pays on an average
£25 a year to uphold the protective system.
* * * *
It thus appears that the traders pay £900,000
in Customs duties, and that they charge this to
the people along with £540,000 direct profit
thereon, to say nothing of £924,000 more profit
alluded to further down the list. As the trader
charges his profit simply on the cost of the
goods without counting which part of it is
original cost or freight or duty, it would thus
seem that the Victorian importer is in the habit
of making about 60 per shent profit all round.
This will be news indeed to a good many of the
fraternity in these hard times. Further, the
levying by the Government of £900,000 duty on
imports enables the local manufacturer to add
three times as much to his prices, and yet he
can sell as cheaply as the importer—-he must
do so, else he wouldn’t exist. In other
words, if a foreign article costs 2d. per lb. and
Id. duty makes it 3d., the manufacturer adds
more than 3d. to his prices as the natural con-
sequence, and still can sell his goods at 3d. to
keep pace with the importer; consequently, if
there was no Protection, he would be able to
sell his goods at less than nothing per lb. ; in
other words, he would be able to supply them
gratis, and pay people to take them away.
And then, having alleged that the people of
Victoria pay to themselves this stupendous
four millions odd, so that they still have it, and
the country still has it, the “ Horrors ” man
goes on to point out that it is all “ lost.” Also,
as a side issue, he charges £260,000 for
“ importers’ profit ” on goods that are not
imported, and so can’t pay any importers’
profit whatever.
* * * •
Then the “ Horrors ” person proceeds to deal
with industries in general. In every case he
brings out the same result—that there is so
much dead loss through Protection that it
would pay the province better to shut up the
industry altogether, and pension the workers
for life at their present wages, and import the
goods bodily. And when he has proved this in
every case the final result is that it would be
cheaper if all Vic. industries were shut up, and
all goods were imported, and nobody was doing
anything to earn money to pay for them, and
everybody was pensioned off out of a revenue
which wouldn’t exist because nobody was
earning any cash to pay taxes or duties with.
The following shriek about the wax-match
industry is a fair sample :
The clearest and most convincing proof of the loss
which protection inflicts upon the people is furnished by
the novel industry of making wax vestas in Victoria. A
duty of Is. per gross boxes was imposed on wax vestas
Taking advantage of this duty, the London firm of R
Bell and Co. established a factory for their production in
Melbourne in the year 1895. And this is the triumphant
result The revenue collected from wax vestas during
the four years preceding the establishment of the factory
—i.e., 1891 to 1894—averaged £14,089 per year. The
factory started operations during the first half of 1895
and the revenue collected during the succeeding half-years
was as follows J
Tn no qo Bi *' nonths ending Revenue.
December 31, 1895 ... %(ua
June 30, 1896
Moreover, there is every reason to expect that the duty
on matches will yield no revenue next year. Disregarding
and merely taking the present position
to be that the revenue of 1896 will be twice that for the
first six months of the year -viz., £3B74—there is here a
loss of revenue of £10,215. This sum, paid by the people
is now transferred to Messrs. Bell and Co p ’
->-Jonn° UfcpUt ’ acc °rding to Inspector Martin’s return, is
115,200 gross ; and as the factory charges 3d less per
gross boxes than imported matches plus duty are sold
for, the public gams the difference— viz., £1440 a year
The account, therefore, stands thus— ‘ V a '
Loss to the revenue ... ... 1110911;
Less wages paid ... £i 9. in itau,zl£>
Less saving in price ...
—■ 2,690
Net 1055... ... ... I- . ,
It thus appears that because the people don’t
tax themselves £10,215 per annum therefore
they lose that amount; in fact, they lose it
because they don’t have to pay it. And when
the amount they receive is deducted from the
amount they don’t pay away, the difference is
the total loss. And the fact that Victoria now
exports considerable quantities of matches to
N.S.W., where they are sold as cheaply as
similar matches from England, proves no
doubt that the Victorian article is much de’arer
and the alleged existence of the alleged dear-
and S sn r< th eS th l?at Protection is the cause of it,
and so the thing goes round in a circle.
* * * *
On, the soap and candle question the “ Hor-
rors individual is equally mixed. He says •
wit^tutS 8 ’ h V pl ° ying ’ in 1893 > ‘he year
cost of the industry to the people of Victoria is approxi-
mately as follows :

The loss to the people, after deducting the revenue re-
ceived by the Government, is, however, £182,737. Each
operative therefore costs the people over £414 a year,
whereas his wages are onlv £65 a year. If they all were
pensioned off for life at full wages, the annual saving
would still amount to £155,827.
This would be every interesting but for seven
or eight different troubles. Victorian soap and
candles are not dearer as alleged ; the fact that
Victoria now supplies N.S. W. with about as
much soap as England does shows that it some-
how contrives to manufacture as cheaply under
Protection as Britain does under Freetrade.
And even if the figures were correct they only
show that the Victorians pay themselves
,£lBO,OOO a year extra to keep their soap and
candle industry going (in addition to, say,
£400,000 for the goods themselves), and having
paid the money to themselves they naturally
still have it. "Wherefore the Horrors of Pro-
tection gentleman is of opinion that, instead of
paying themselves £580,000, it would be
cheaper to pay £400,000 to somebody else.
Also he points out in the first place that the
importer habitually charges 60 per cent, profit,
but in the soap and candle business, being
severely pressed by local competition created by
Protection, he only charges 33 per cent. Then
he urges that the whole business should be
abandoned to the importer, so that he may
again charge 60 per cent, profit, which would
amount to about £240,000 a year, in order to
save the alleged £lBO,OOO spent in encouraging
local manufactures. Curiously enough, the
Telegraph’s special lunatic, though he repre-
sents the importer as charging 60 per cent,
profit, makes no allowance anywhere for the
saving effected through the abolition of him and
his huge percentage.
* * * *
The narrative is a confused affair all through.
A protected country pays to itself duty on a
small quantity of goods imported in one parti-
cular line, and the duty (which it pays to itself
and which would otherwise have to be made up
by some other form of taxation) is one of the
losses arising from Protection. It doesn’t pay
duty on similar goods locally manufactured, and
the amount the revenue doesn’t receive under
this head is another loss. Consequently, both
the money it pays and the money it doesn’t pay
are dead loss. Then the money which goes out
of the country as the importers’ profit is loss,
and the amount which remains in the country
as the manufacturers’ profit is also loss. Next,
the amount which would otherwise go out of
the country as importers’ loot, if the local manu-
facturer hadn’t partly suppressed that 50 or 60
per cent, cormorant, isn’t profit. And when
the amount that the people pay to themselves
is added to the amount they don’t pay to them-
selves, but which they might pay if someth i n g was
which isn’t, and the amount that goes out of the
country is thrown in, and also the amount that
doesn’t go out of the country, and the thing that
is has been added to the thing that might have
been, the total makes up a huge alleged loss,
for which Protection is responsible. The moral
is that a pint is losing a quart annually, and
has been doing so for a long time, and isn’t yet
quite exhausted, which is a rather larger moral
than any ordinary person can hold.
Booth versus Confucius.
Dear Bulletin, —I lately remarked in your
columns upon the absurdity of the Salvation
Army s expectation of extricating—as regards
the Malay Archipelago—any considerable num-
ber of souls from the remarkably enduring grip
of Mahommed ; and, since it now appears that
the Corybantic Cult proposes, by extending its
operations to Cathay, to encroach upon what
has hitherto been regarded as the special
preserve of the hysterically-evangelical Young
Person, I should like to ask a few
straight-out questions. First, has the Salva-
tion Army the remotest idea that in the life of
the average “Chinaman at Home” the so-
called Christian virtues are very much more in
evidence than in any ostensibly Christian com-
munity ? Also, has the S.A. the faintest con-
ception of the fact that the average Celestial
intellect is vastly more comprehensive and acute
than the average S.A. ditto? Again, what
answer is the S.A. prepared to give to the
intelligent Chinaman who will, to a dead cer-
tainty, put to the would-be proselytiser the
following pertinent questions ?

accords much better than yours with the
moral standards by which you profess to
be guided. What, therefore, shall it profit me
to subscribe to your assertions that Three and
One—God and Man—are identical ? These
things are to me vastly more absurd supersti-
tions than any of the beliefs which you are so
ready thus to characterise in my case. The
question is simply one of intellectual superiority,
and you proceed throughout upon the assump-
tion that this of necessity rests with you. But
you have, so far, done nothing whatever to
prove this ; nor, until you have done so, can
you expect me to receive or respect your doc-
trines about things which cannot possibly be
known.

“Meantime my beliefs—upon antecedent evi-
dence —are at least as likely to be correct as
your own. While you say that I am neces-
sarily wrong I, in return, say merely that you
are probably so ; and to that extent I am wider
thipi you are—and deeper. When you have
learnt the humility which you are always
preaching, and have got rid of your intellectual
disease of gratuitous assumption, you may pos-
sibly not be confined for your record of ‘ con-
verts ’ to that class of my countrymen which
finds its best parallel in the ignorant enthu-
siasts of your Salvation Army.”

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Queensland and the Press.
The corrupt ring of Q. politicians—feeding
their bank with public money which they annex
in private overdrafts—is, of course, not repre-
sentative of the manhood and intelligence of
the province. On any fair electoral system
Queensland would place honest men in charge
of her government. But, whatever the methods
by which the existing Q. administrators reached
office, they legally speak and act for their pro-
vince ; and their acts and speeches must be
accepted as Queensland’s acts and speeches. It
is apparently their wish that the kanaka
country should be reckoned, not as a part of
white Australia, not as the friend of the
southern provinces, but as a lukewarm ally
or a secret enemy. Ignoble jealousies and
pocket-motives have held Queensland aloof
from the approaching Federal Convention to
try and found an Australian nation. Almost
as unworthy seem the measures more or less
aimed to exclude from Q. circulation the
Southern newspapers unafraid of Govt,
threats, unsubsidised by the Govt. bank. The
Bulletin is not here referring to itself. The
Australasian, the Leader and the Sydney
Mail, for example, though generally favorable
to constituted authorities and capitalistic
views, cannot avoid occasional expressions of
disgust at the robbery of the people by the
Northern financial rings. Q. Govt, proposes to
punish objectionable newspapers through their
profits. It prohibits the publication of in-
decent advertisements and gambling advertise-
ments ; and from Ist January, 1897, news-
papers published outside Queensland are to be
charged per 2oz. of weight for postal trans-
mission—which brings the postage on The
Bulletin to 2d., and on the Australasian to
3d. or more. As regards indecent advts. there
is only one opinion : they should not be pub-
lished. But decision as to what is or is
not indecent is often very hard. Obviously
the new law gives any Q. Postmaster-General
power to cause an unfriendly paper a great deal
of annoyance by deciding that its advts. are
indecent, while a friendly paper with precisely
the same advts. may be winked at. The pro-
hibition of sweep advts. may or may not be
judicious, but, on the part or Q. Govt., it is im-
pudently hypocritical. All Q. horse-races are
specially licensed by Govt. ; bookmakers and
totalisators are allowed to gamble openly with
the public for whose morals Govt, professes to
be so solicitous ; and all totalisator-receipts are
taxed 24 per cent, for the benefit of the revenue
—last year’s tax realising £3984. Thus the
Govt, which, with its white face, prosecutes a
newspaper for publishing sweep advts., with its
black hands takes nearly £4OOO per annum out
of sweep-profits ! The matter of increased
postage is the most serious. Its deliberate
object is to shut out from Q. circulation the
large southern weeklies—mostly antagonistic to
the Govt.-—while the large local weeklies
(which exist partly by ingratiating themselves
with Govt., and buying Govt, advts. with
editorial support) are carried at each,
as before, irrespective of 'weight. Again,
if Q. Parliament licenses this, The Bulletin,
though lamenting the narrow spirit shown and
wishing the province a more enlightened Parlia-
ment, has nothing to say. But Q- Parliament
does not license it. The new charge is made
by the Postmaster-General in apparent exercise
of his delegated authority ; and such authority,
if he have it, is plainly far too wide. For, if
theP.M.G. can thus discriminate between the
newspapers of his own province and those of
the rest of Australia, there is practically no
limit to his power. Instead of charging a hos-
tile newspaper per 20z., he may charge it
Is. per Joz., and destroy its circulation com-
pletely. The Russian censor blacks out pas-
sages offensive to Govt., but the Q. press censor
can black out the whole newspaper. Q. Post-
master-General’s attitude will make little dif-
ference to The Bulletin. But, in its anti-
federal spirit and its opportunities for petty
tyranny, it further disgraces Queensland and is
to be deplored by all Australia.
The N.S. Wales Relief-Works Swindle.
Under the above heading an embittered cor-
respondent addresses The Bulletin :
Once a man takes to N.S. Wales alleged relief-work it

thrown in to swell the hours from 6.50 to 6.30. Truly, the
relief of the Foreign-raid Govt, is a grisly thing. Riverina
squatters pay their Chinamen more than this. Once a
reliefer always a reliefer. Let the unemployed work till
every smew feels like a red-hot wire and all things turn
blue, let him sleep on the ground and start with the sun ;
a careful management will see that he makes no more
than will pay for food and perhaps rent. His boots he
must get from the Benevolent Asylum, or steal ; his
clothes he must cadge or pick up in Paddy’s Market, and
b6ar upon him the unmistakeable stamp of one of
“Creers Unemployed,” which bars him from almost
every hope of respectable employment. The present sys-
tem of relief-work benefits only those who superintend it
and grocer Kidman, the Govt, contractor. When the
reliefer runs out of food he gets a certificate from the
works inspector that he has worked so many hours, which
he presents by proxy to Boss Creer, who for 12
hours’ work will advance him an order on grocer
Kidman for two rations, 21b. of rice and one tin of con-
densed milk ; value, 3s. 4£d. The two rations amount to
four loaves of bread, 4lb. sugar (white), of tea, and
61b. beef or mutton, whichever it may suit contractor
Kidman to supply. The 3s. 4b>d. is carefully deducted
from the reliefer’s earnings on pay-day. The reliefer may
have no wood with which to cook his meat and boil water
to make his tea, but grocer Kidman does not sell wood,
and although the reliefer pays the Bureau hard cash for
its order he can only buy with it just what grocer Kidman
and an imbecile Govt, think he ought to require. It he
is very hungry he can eat the meat raw and chew the
tea ; or, if he is a bold, bad, ungrateful man he may steal
the back of a seat from the nearest park. Minister
Garrard seldom inspects relief-works—only once. The
men working at Randwick are sad fathers of families and
mostly men past middle age, and are anything hut
dangerous.
Morality put into Figures.
Ed. Bulletin, —Some little time ago Dr.
came in for a good deal of ridicule "for certain
assertions in re the chastity of the women of
N.S.W. No harm, I take it, can come from a
knowledge of the truth, for which we have not
far to seek. The figures lam about to quote
are taken from Coghlan’s “ Wealth and Pro-
gress,” and are susceptible of being readily
checked. Taking the years ’93 and ’94 to-
gether, it would seem that there were 15,415
marriages, and amongst the ladies who were
parties to these marriages there were 11,385
who had apparently not previously made a
slight trial of matrimony, while 4030 of them
had a quasi-matrimonial experience, as their
first children were born*’before they were nine
months married. Of course, there were some
amongst the 4030 whose delivery was prema-
ture, but against these may be set the women
who, though unchaste before marriage, yet
were not delivered of a child during their first
year. During ’93 and ’94 the illegitimate births
numbered 4947; so that there were 8977 women
whose children were either illegitimate or nar-
rowly escaped being so. Assume that all the
women with illegitimate children ought to
have been married during the years quoted, and
there were or would have been 20,362 marriages,
and of these 8977, or over 45 in every 100,
would have been of women who neglected to
keep their favors until after marriage. There is
another way of looking at the question. The
civil condition of women and their age are
ascertained at the census, and the number of
unmarried women at each age can be compared
with the number of women of the same age who
had illegitimate children during any year. It
is unfortunate that the comparison cannot he
made for the census year. In the figures lam
quoting, the number of unmarried women is for
1891 and the births for 1894. The comparison
errs on one side by reason of the slight increase
in single women in three years, and on the other
side because women in hospitals, gaols, and
lunatic asylums are included. For children
whose fathers and mothers were, as the daily
papers put it, familiar before marriage, I shall
use the euphemism, quasi-legitimate :
The last column represents the chances out of
a hundred of a single woman being with child at
each age. This, however, does not represent
the full case. If you take the number of mar-
ried women at their ages and divide by the
number of children born to them during a year
you obtain the probabilities of conception.
This for (say) age 17 is 2—that is for every two
married women of 17 one child will be born in
a year ; at ages from 35 to 40 the probability is
4to 1 against conception. So if you wish to
arrive at the presumed number of unmarried
women who have been familiar with men dur-
ing a year, multiply the percentage of births by
the chances against conception, which I shall
now proceed to do.
ihus you see that it is perfectly certain at (say)
age 20, out of 1000 single women 53 will have
,their little familiarities with men, while the
chances are that 133 will be so minded, the
worst period being from 21 to 24, where the
actual ascertained frailties are 65 in 1000,
whilst the probables number 169.— Herman
Beckner.
“ There was never a time when any Legislative
Council in Victoria exhibited itself in an atti-
tude more hostile to the broad aspirations of
an intelligent populace than the present. Mr.
Isaacs’s Companies Bill has shared the fate of
Mr. Wynne s, and, thanks to a House composed
of men personally interested in maintaining
loose conditions, the Vic. people have to see
their law continue in the old state of dis-
reputable insecurity to the investing public.
There is a party in the Council, voiced by
people like Mr. Reid, who continually cry out
We want to be let alone. There is no need
for all this radical legislation.’ But what is
the meaning of this fatuous form of words—
this cry to be let alone ? It can only mean
that the dishonesty which has been rampant in
company-promoting is to be continued, or to
have at least another chance to exert itself
against the defenceless part of the community.
It must mean that the hawks of society are to be
permitted another swoop upon the unguarded
pigeons.” Thus spake Melb. Age on Dec. 23.
The situation was fairly depicted. The Council’s
amendments of the Companies Bill had practi-
cally secured a further lease of life for “ the
old state of disreputable insecurity to the in-
vesting public,” and the Turner Government
was in duty bound to at least make an attempt
to obtain something better. But a little bird
came whispering in the editorial ear that Premier
Turner wanted peace at any price rather
than a righteous rebellion against Sargood’s
despotism. Next day, therefore, the Age an-
nounced that “ the Government took a wise
course in recommending the Assembly to accept
the Council s amendments in the Companies
Bill. . . . It would be a mistake to suppose
that the Bill as accepted by the Assembly is not
a valuable reform of the companies law.”
The N.S. Wales Ministry gets on steadily with
preaching Freetrade and practising Protection.
Its latest idea is to call for tenders for 40,000
blankets “to be manufactured locally.” This
isn’t a case of giving the work to the cheapest
tenderer, which is Freetrade ; nor of giving the
local man a certain specified advantage openly
announced and fixed by Parliament, which is
ordinary Trotection ; but of shutting out every-
body except the local maker, which is the most
aggravated form of Protection imaginable.
Even M’Kinley doesn’t go so far as this. And
this Protection isn’t given by Parliamentary
sanction ; it is fixed by the Reid Government
on its own responsibility, with no authority
whatever. And yet the Reid Government is
never tired of preaching that no industry (not
even the blanket industry) should be artificially
supported at the expense of the taxpayers (by
the State taking its goods, for instance, at a
higher price than similar articles could be pro-
cured at elsewhere). Also, it is never tired of
denouncing the late Dibbs-Lyne Government
for inviting local tenders only when it wanted
blankets (we mean iron pipes), and point-
ing out the reckless wast'e and wicked-
ness of the whole business. The Bulletin
believes in Protection, but it regards it as a
piece of sickening hypocrisy when a Government
lives and moves and gets its salary under false
pretences by preaching Freetrade, yet prac-
tises Protection on every possible occasion,
and at the same time brazenly denies that it
does practise it. If Premier Reid dare not live
up to the Foreign-trade creed, then it is time
the Foreign-trade party in the Assembly re-
placed him by a leader who isn’t ashamed of
his alleged faith. The spectacle of Reid, the
Freetrader, practising exactly the same kind of
Protection that he denounced as incurably sin-
ful when followed by Lyne, the Protectionist,
is a tolerably sickening spectacle for any honest
community.
Dr. O’Sullivan, speaking the other day as
president of the Vic. branch of the British
Medical Association, had something to say re
women on bicycles In spite of himself, he
had become convinced that cycling, as gener-
ally practised, must lead to unpleasant health
results. No man with a knowledge of special
female ailments could deny that the use of the
pedal sewing-machine, even when worked under
the most favorable conditions, was a frequent
cause of ill-health, but in cycling the dangers
to the individual were increased tenfold. Nerve
strain when using the machine was certainly at
its highest,” &c., See. The O’Sullivan opinion
is none the more valuable for having been deli-
vered by the president of a medical meeting, but
it is entitled to quite as much respect as the
oracular predictions of a Dr. Springthorpe, or
any other out-and-out barracker for the new
craze. It will not dismay the women who
already ride bikes, and recommend their fair
friends to join them in enjoyment of “ a most
delightful sensation,” but, on the other hand,
Dr. O’Sullivan’s warning may persuade some
of the hesitating ones to pause and look around
before they leap into the little leather saddle.
The question as to whether cycling is healthy
or otherwise for women seems to be answered
in the faces of those who have been longest on
the road. How do the pioneer cyclodonahs of
this warm country look after a couple of years
indulgence in their “ splendid exercise ” ?
How would Ponshopalia (phonetic) do as a
name for Queensland? The whole province,
east, west, north and south, is up the spout!
otab the fatman of other puovinces, and he,
- s °* n e him, bleeds sovereigns ; puncture
the Q. illusion, and as he collapses he exudes
promises to pay. r l he Government party indi-
vidually is in pawn to the Q.N.8., and the Bank
to the Government in its collective capacity.
The squatter is in pawn, and Lazarus at his
gate in the shape of the 160-acre cocky is under
the thumb of his storekeeper, he again under
the wholesale man, and so round to the bank.
Spider, the blackboy, has to crawl into the
bush past the Chinaman’s garden for the want
of a shilling to square “ his open account.” The
Chow s wife and family are mortgaged over in
the Flowery Land for his passage-money— the
Jap. up on the shell-beds owes for his diving-
suit, and little Billy Brown, at the Pro-
visional School, goes in terror of his life because
he can t pay a big boy for the dozen of marbles
he got on tick. In fact, the whole province
spends what time it has over from dodging its
creditor in hunting up the other fellow that
owes it something.
The charnel-men of the law have been threaten-
ingly shaking some of their bags of bones lately
in Australia. The operation makes stenches,
but is useful as a danger-signal, and should
ready people for a code containing as far as
possible all the common law, and so much of
the English statute law as is in force in Aus-
tralia, A clause should be inserted forbidding
future reference behind the code—making it,
in fact, a final statement of the law ub to the
date of its passing. A glance would then show
what was obsolete or unsuited to the circum-
stances of the country, and a cleansing revision
Act could and would be speedily passed. The
work is worth federal action (but federation
need not be waited for), especially as prac-
tically the same English common and statute
law is in force in all the provinces. The danger
of letting sleeping dogs lie, and dead dogs
pollute the legal air, is surely sufficiently shown
to even the indifferent Australian public, when
we have, in a few short weeks, a trial for
libelling a magistrate by sending a complaint
to the Minister of Justice in Victoria, two
instances in the same province of a pedantic
P.M. ordering a suicide’s body to be buried at
midnight, a trial for a “ conspiracy to im-
poverish ” in bydney, and a trial for sorcery
at lamworth. Codification has limitations,
perhaps dangers, but certainly not as manv as
the present no-system.
Writes “ E.M.H.” to The Bulletin :
About larrikins. Whatever vices pertain to this genus,
how does it happen that I, a girl reared in the push-
infested locality, upon going into the street after dark,
should look for probable insult in seeing l well-dressed
men loitering about? Of the larrikins at the corner I
take no heed. Upon one occasion I was protected by a
larrikin from the forced company of one who, by his guise,
would be called a gentleman. This well-dressed indivi-
dual followed me from the city to Newtown after ten one
night, and when I got into the quiet streets, compelled
me by his conduct to appeal to the first man I met, who
was a larrikin, and who snarled at his “superior,” some-
thing in the manner of a bull-dog, and accompanied me
to my friends. When I thanked him he mumbled some-
thing unintelligible, and lounged off with a short
“ S’long !” We certainly do hear of larrikins being expert
m kicking, the use of blue metal, and jumping on people,
but while the brutalities of the “gentleman” are con-
cealed or palliated by society the vices of the larrikin rise
broad-voiced in the ears of the people. If circumstances
compelled me, I would far rather pass through a crowd of
larrikins, trusting to my respectable appearance, than
through the same number of (say) University students.—
E.M.H.
[Which fits in with the contention of The
Bulletin that the respectable woman who be-
haves respectably and doesn’t dawdle is seldom
insulted by the “ larrikin,” who, to do him
justice, is always far more ready to help or pro-
tect a woman than to molest her. Yet, when
the law flogs anyone in Australia it is never a
black-coated “gentleman,” convicted on clear
evidence of having presumed on the privileges
of his social position, but always some unhappy
wretch in workman’s (or, if you like, larrikin’s)
garb.— Ed. B.]
Dear Bulletin,— Often during the last few
years have 1 heard the assertion that “ the
butter-trade saved Victoria.” Did it ? What
permanent good—beyond the sending to Hing-
land of decent cow-fat—has it done? The Vic.
butter-industry to-day is one of the worst-
sweated businesses on the face of the earth—
from beginning to end—from cow to consumer.
I know—l am in it. The farmers round here
(N. Gippsland) pay their milkers from 4s. to 10s.
per week and keep, and they work the usual day-
light till dark, which means in summer 15 or 16
hours a day, Sundays as well. 110 hours a
week ! Consider that, ye 48 hours’ men. The
milk goes to the factory or the creamery. Most
of these country creameries are now practically
the property of three or four Melb. companies.
As a general thing they put one man—in some
cases oply a youth—in complete charge of a
creamery. He has to receive, tally and test
the milk, take charge of an engine and boiler
and two or more separators, pump, &c., keep
the place .clean, and generally run the
whole concern, and he considers him-
self well paid at 30s. per week. At a
butter-factory there are generally three men
employed. The manager gets £2, the other
man 305., and the boy perhaps 10s. They work
from 5 a.m. to about 5 p.m., Sundays as well.
The butter goes to Melbourne, there to be ex-
ported or sold to grocers, &e. The butter
auctioneers work their half-dozen storemen and
clerks from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and twice a week
—on sale-nights—to 11 p.m. ; and they pay
them—well, in God’s name, what do they pay
them now ? Probably £1 a week. I used to
get 30s. in the better times of ’9O, and I was
not the worst-paid. The grocers’ assistants,
who handle the butter last of all, are probably
better-off than any of their fellow-workers,
thanks chiefly to the Factories Act; but farm-
laborers were apparently not worth considera-
tion in that measure, while butter-factories and
creameries were carefully exempted from its
operations, chiefly through the agency of an
interested party in the Leg. Council. It’s a
great trade entirely, but when next you eat
your butter don’t forget the human sweat th it
goes into it, or the many lives worn out to pro-
vide grease for other men’s food.—F. Cooson.

“ Tommy Atkins ” was duly presented by
the returned Geo. Rignold at Sydney Royal, and
proved to be a vast, gorgeous, and beautifully im-
probable drama of the first magnitude. “ At-
kins ” is far above the level of the common or
garden melo-shriek. The plot is decent in a
literary sense; the dialogue is clever ; the mount-
ing is as good as G. Rignold always makes it ;
also, the church-scene in particular is a quite un-
usual piece of Gothic realism and elaborate finish.
“T. Atkins,” in fact, earns The Bullletin’s
warm approval as a vast, costly, well-devised
spectacle which is full of paint and varnish and
green landscape and valuable moral. The heroine,
it is true, goes wrong, and humps the illicit in-
fant about in very much the old way, but her
ejection by her hard old parent is done under novel
circumstances. Also, the father doesn’t relent,
but remains a hard-kicking old churchwarden to
the last, and almost his final wish as he dies in the
sure and certain hope of a glorious resurrection is
that his daughter will remain cold, and wet, and
homeless, and bedraggled about the hair all the rest
of her days. This is in itself a new departure.
Private Rignold is killed in the last act with his
sins, which include robbery with violence and the
throwing of the lost girl over a cliff, on her head,
which is also novel; and the Rev. Plimmer jumps
on his black coat and solemnly swears off the
snuffle of his fathers, and enlists as a private,
which is a startling departure from the usual
dramatic curate. The wicked captain has two
wives, and, though he is only a small man, it
takes four men to hold him back from marrying a
third one ; and when he perishes in the desert, a
disgraced, shot and singed man, he doesn’t repent
or say beautiful things in his last moment, but
dies with a howl and a curse, as he had lived.
After that, the rest is battle, murder, gunshot,
fire and red revolution, and the brown sands of
the desert are covered with glory and dead Atkins.
* * * *
The new co. is better than any which
Rignold has shown tor a good many years. The
Rev. Plimmer is a very fine hero who makes every
point in the character of the fighting curate. The
wicked captain of H.W. Diver is also above par ;
he is a good elocutionary sinner whose energy and
strict attention to crime deserve a long continu-
ance of public support. Diver is an actor of much
promise, and he is a bundle of nerves whose
activity is interesting after the slow impassiveness
of wicked captains in general. Hans Phillips
lends much picturesqueness to the slow, drinky
decadence of Ebenezer Skindle, and two new
ladies, Misses Gresham and Guildford, as the
second and third wives, are pretty and promise to
do well. Also G. Rignold is a satisfactory sub-
ordinate villain, and Miss Watts - Phillips
is as good as that clever little woman usu-
ally is. The merciful removal of the first wife
by premeditated gunshot is a decided relief.
That gaunt waif, by the way, after being fatally
wounded and knocked flat, gets to her feet again
and makes a column of remarks at Diver in a per-
fectly healthy voice, which might be good enough
in a consumptive or a case of death by influenza.
Also, the heroine with the groundless infant isn’t
all she might be, though she might easily be
worse. Taken all-round, however, “T. Atkins”
is a most deserving melodrama ; and the gradual
bloating of the nose of Ebenezer Skindle as that
clerical person sinks into the sere and beery leaf
and becomes a weak follower after skittles is a
moral lesson that is alone worth the entrance-
money.
** * *
Charles M‘Carthy, the new Irish-Amur-
fikin comedian, opened at Sydney Lyceum on
Saturday in “Lady Blarney.” M‘Carthy, as a
hroguey man in woman’s clothes, is certainly a
success, and ranks with the widow Sheridan-
O’Brien and with Frank Thornton as the lady
from Brazil where the nuts come from. This
paper doesn’t enthuse much over the man in
woman’s clothes as a general thing, but, so far
as the part is worth dong, M‘Carthy does it
very well. The play is a Widow O’Brienesque
frivolity to which the author has lent a tinge of
seriousness by inserting a wicked brother who
does enormous embezzlements and leads Harrie
Ireland astray, a disreputable father with a wart
who forges cheques, a good brother who worships
pretty Ida Hamilton, a large, stern captain
who comes home from the briny, sharky deep
to find that his eldest girl is morally
“lost,” and can’t honestly account for the
possession of the jewellery, and various other
things. It is a perverse kind of comedrama, for
Scot Inglis, looming up darkly in the long frock-
coat of sin, and the inscrutable smile of iniquity,
and the glossy bell-topper of black treachery,
wants to marry Ida Hamilton because she is rich,
and Robert Inman won’t marry her because he
is poor; and Harrie Ireland is more or less
willing- to marry either of them, but neither will
have her. W herefore, Scot Inglis sits gloomily
behind a screen embezzling the trust money, and
the captain, in the next room, bellows at his
jewelled girl who is “lost,” and Miss Hamilton
weeps because the good brother is accused of the
forged cheque, and the sinful, warty parent con-
ceals himself behind the furniture.
When these things fail, as they mostly do,
to keep the show going the he-woman cornea in
and rages in brogue, and falls in astonishing calis-
thenics over her train, and generally is an Irish
bull all over the premises. There is a lot of bright
dialogue in the part of the Irish lady, and
M ‘Carthy rushes through it gaily, and keeps the
character alive all the time. Otherwise the piece
is best supported by Scot Inglis, who is as good as
usual, though the long frock-coat shows a slight ten-
dency to be monotonous, by Inman, I rank Glark,
and Misses Harrie Ireland and Ida Hamilton. Ihe
former lady is, so far, a success in everything she
attempts, and, in addition, her stately figure makes
her about the best clothes-advt. in Australia.
Miss Hamilton has the first good part she has
played in this country, and the public, which
hitherto judged her ability by the small characters
which she did under the shadow of the awful
Potter, was surprised to find her make a real
success all through. A few other people help to
make up a generally strong company, ana under
these favorable circumstances “ Lady B. has
rather better prospects than its literary merits call
for.
* * *
Westmacott's pantomime at Her Majesty’s
promises to be a moderate success for various
reasons, about some of which The Bulletin is
not very clear. It is the only panto, in Sydney,
for one thing, and it is beautifully mounted, and
the mechanical arrangements run without a hitch,
and there is plenty of glitter and nice frock in it,
and a reasonable quantity of cave, and as much
hairy demon as any person has a right to expect,
and a lot of variety show—good, mixed, and in-
different. The Lucifers (one male and one female)
are the brightest and most original feature in it,
and are distinctly above par. Brother Lucifer
goes through an astonishing musketry drill with
part of himself for the musket, and shoulders
and presents arms with his own leg in a
surprising fashion. Also, he runs with both
legs round his neck, and kicks two baskets
simultaneously at a height of nine feet. The
average athlete is a dreary person who does
tricks in a dull, stodgy fashion and then goes
away, but Lucifer fills in the proceedings with a
stream of amusing patter, and doesn’t even profess
to take himself seriously. Lucifer is a very big
circumstance and ought to boom greatly. Provo,
the clever juggler, suffers from the fact that he
isn’t at all new, and so do the clever Banvards
and Joe Walhalla. As for “ Sinbad ”in general,
it is just the same as any other “ Sinbad,” and the
other “Sinbad” is so like “Cinderella” that
neither of them can be told from “Jack the
Giant-Killer,” and the whole lot could pass for the
“ House that Jack Built ” without anybody notic-
ing the difference. Crackles’ great joke, “ I’ve
got another hat,” grows wearisome when it
has been repeated 47 times, and it is a
mechanical steam joke at the best. When
Crackles says “ I’ve got another hat,” D’Arcy
Stanfield, as the awful man in woman’s clothes,
lifts up his voice and wails “ I’m such a young
thing, too,” and then Lawton remarks “Oh, I
am a popular man. ” These three statements con-
stitute almost all the real fun of the pantomime.
George Leopold, in the character of Premier
Reid, falls very flat indeed, and in general the
local allusions are old and musty, or else new and
weak. The pantomimist who tries to get a laugh
out of the Soudan goat at this late hour, especi-
ally as the animal is long since dead, is decidedly
out of date. Nevertheless, Lawton’s whistle and
the wonderfully limber Lucifer, and the scenery
and the transformation and the nice girls and the
frocks count for a great deal, and The Bulletin’s
opinion is that if the painful Crackles doesn’t get
another hat too often the management will make
a very much undeserved profit out of “Sinbad,”
despite the fact that three-fourths of the panto,
ought to be killed on the spot. Regarding the
girls, they are all nice in a moderate way, but no
one of them is conspicuously nicer than the rest.
Anyhow, this paper hasn’t got them sorted out
yet.
** * *
The Brough co. made its re-appearance at
Sydney Cri. in “Nancy and C 0.,” a play in four
bursts of comic insanity which rages exceedingly
for 2 2 hours or so, and seems likely to do well.
There is a blessed absence of any moral in it, and
the sex problem ceases from troubling, and the
weary villain is at rest. Nancy is a lady suffering
from suppressed literature which has struck in-
wards, and the worst thing she does is to help a
perfectly respectable young man to write a play.
But, this being a suspicious world, the two are sup-
posed to be bent on surreptitiously hugging each
other, and an ancient and meddlesome person fol-
lows them up and drives them to distraction.
The play consists largely in the agitated flight of
the pair, and their concealment in many places,
and a fatuous pursuit by the meddlesome
patriarch and others, and the falling of everybody
over everybody else’s feet under circumstances
which are too complicated to admit of explana-
tion. The solemn truth of the matter is generally
such a ghastly improbability that it isn’t worth
while making anyone attempt to believe it, there-
fore the people concerned tell awful whoppers to
each other when they are found concealed in the
hat-rack under dim and shady conditions, or
trying to escape up a chimney, and thereby make
the confusion even more aggravated than before.
• * * .
There is a perfect blizzard of suspicious
circumstances in the four acts. Brough, who is
merely trying, in a respectable wig and a weak
voice, to bring the wicked to justice, is himself
snowed up under many base calumnies before the
trouble is over. Mrs. Brough, who helps Roberts
to write the drama, is a bright, fresh, loveable
character, and Roberts himself is a distinct suc-
cess, but circumstances are too much for them
also. A number of other people are either
brilliantly fallen upon in the dark, or else they
rush into dimly-lighted rooms in search of the
alleged person who committed the thing ia
didn’t happen, and can be heard coming down
with the ability of the true artist and being
severely bumped against the furniture. miss
Hope Mayne, who makes her first Sydney appear-
ance in “ Nancy,” promises remarkably well, ana
as the piece has evidently caught on, and Fercy
Ward, another new personage, seems all rignt,
there is little left to wish for. “ Nancy ls > ln
some respects, a shade more impossible than tne
average comedy; in real life somebody must
needs sit on the head of old Ebenezer about the
second act, and tell him such an eminently pro-
bable lie that the whole matter would be cleared
up ; but there is a great amount of mirth in it,
and it goes at a flying pace, and is quite good
enough for any ordinary purpose.
*- * * *
The Brough season is to cover only six
weeks, and in that brief period it is proposed to
produce “A Woman of No Importance, A.
Woman’s Reason,” “Sowing the Wind,” and A
White Elephant.” The latter animal is abso-
lutely new and has just been unpacked.
** * *
The trouble about Sydney Palace has been
so far settled that manager Garner has been bound
over in a small sum of money not to bash manager
Goatcher for a comparatively brief period. The
Palace continues to be crowded every night, and
the most unsatisfactory person in the bill has re-
moved one cause of wrath by a judicious disap-
pearance. Knowles’s sketch of the way various
nations go home when they are drunk improves
with further acquaintance, and the balance of
opinion seems to be that the programme is a little
better than it was in some respects and no worse
in others. Two absolutely hair-raising trapezists,
Wilton and Stack, have been added to the list of
performers, and considering the chances they take
they will either be very popular or will shortly be
dead.
** * *
Chirgwin, the white-eyed Kaffir, is the
principal attraction this week at Sydney Tivoli,
where that versatile person is doing an extra-
ordinary number of things to the satisfaction of
most people concerned. As a vocalist, a performer
on the bagpipes and many other horrors, a, teller
of strange anecdotes ,and a wandering minstrel
and humorist generally, Chirgwin fills a pretty
large bill, and does it quite as well as any other
variety showman on earth.
** * *
The ancient, luckless Sydney Gaiety, which
has swallowed up many managements and many
one-night shows, and where a long succession of
spectres have either walked with difficulty, or not
at all, is open again, under the management of
another of the innumerable Cosgroves, with a loyal
drama of great violence, called “ Under the British
Flag. ” The Bulletin is suffering at present from
altogether too much undigested Xmas drama, and
further details about the “ Flag ” are held over.
** * *
M‘Mahon’s Cinematographe and the other
Cinematographe both remain above ground. Also,
some misguided person has been giving views of
the murder of Lee Weller and other horrors at an
address which it is better not to mention, and
quite an eruption of small shows has taken place
in various parts of Sydney.
*” * *
First impressions of “ Matsa,” the Firm’s
panto-extravaganza, at Melbourne Princess’s, are
very favorable in the bulk. There are points
where “ Matsa ” surpasses the glory of “ Djin-
Djin,” and in all respects the new show has been
calculated to meet the popular demand for expen-
siveness. The story, which begins better than it
continues, is full of open spaces where ballets,
processions, and Gordon’s excellent scenery can
come in. Every inch of opportunity for display
is turned to account. The splendor may be irrele-
vant, but it gets there all the same, and spreads a
sense of satisfaction that sticks to the mind long
after the mind has ceased to wonder what excuse
the spectacle.could have had for happening. For
the present, “ Matsa” is weak in the musical de-
partment. The melodies have been heard before,
or are considerably adapted from familiar sources,
or else they belong to the class of original compo-
sitions which one would prefer never to hear at
all. But catchy numbers are so easily dropped
into a pantomime that the defect is pretty sure to
get remedied very soon. Wi th a first-class orchestra
and plenty of singing ability in the company,
“ Matsa ” ought to please the ear as much as it
delights the eye. And, talking of defects, Miss
Florence Young may as well be reprimanded for
her hard, inflexible style of impersonating a
romantic hero. I lorence deals with sundry super-
natural agencies as though she were buying a
pound of tea. She kills a dragon, or arranges to
extinguish the Fire Queen with a flood in the
most uninteresting manner, and her alleged devo-
tion to Flora Graupner betrays no warmth what-
ever. It is sad to think that Prince will
probably be chewing gum whilst conducting
I rincess Graupner to the altar, and will start the
honeymoon by cracking nuts.
* 4 * * * ,
The Rising of the Nile in “Matsa” is quite
as striking an achievement as the “ Djin-Djin ”
earthquake, and much more suitable to summer
weather. Hie inundation effect was not in its
best working order on Saturday, yet the scene
assured the' .success of the panto. An Aerial
Ballet, with a view of Melb. underneath the flying
angels, is also a refreshing sight. Cloudland
appears to be situated quite close to Melbourne
and the spn-its must hold a magnifying glass over
the Princess s Theatre, seeing that the building in
question covers a space equivalent to about ten
acres in any other portion of the picture. Ancient
Memphis the Mountains of the Moon, the Grand
azaar at Cairo, and the Suez Canal near Aden are
places of special interest in “ Matsa,” which has a
most elastic plot. Several characters are older
than the Garden of Eden, and some are so modern
that they ride into the proceedings on bicycles
previous to being put back 1000 years for reasons
too obscure to mention. No character shone
brilliantly on Boxing Night. George Lanri

Xmas time “ The Serpent’s Coil ” is too dull for
the most part, and not sufficiently comic in its
few bursts of excitement to pass muster as a pan-
tomime. Twenty or more bona-fide Chows from
Little Bourke-street slouch around the last two
acts, and two of the vegetable merchants warble
heathen ballads, but a stage-frighted Chow vocalist
is less humorous than one would suppose. The
same objection applies to the stuffed reptile., and
the devouring flames, and other unrealistic items
in an ill-fated entertainment. They are stupid
beyond endurance. A couple of Cosgroves,
Augustus Glover, John Forde, Wilfred Shine,
and Miss Katie Towers are chief conspirators in
the latest attempt to bring; the Alexandra (alias
Her Majesty’s) back to life, therefore the utter
awfulness of the attempt excites some surprise.

“ The Strange Adventures of Miss Brown,’
at Melb. Bijou, proves to be a light, speedy, well
ribbed-up farce, capable of carrying a 15st. title to
the fore. A military captain, who has an Irish
major to urge him along his lawless way, is the soul
and most of the body of “ T.S. A.0.M.8.” The
captain abducts award in Chancery from boarding-
school and marries her, but before they can digest
their wedding-breakfast the bride is captured by
her guardian and taken back to the place whence
she came. Then the captain, disguised as “ Miss
Brown,” in a wild Irish costume and an auburn
wig, is dumped down at the seminary by the
enterprising major, with instructions to carry off
his bride when the clock strikes 10. Sweet girlish
attentions from sundry unsuspecting boarders
keep the warrior occupied until it is time
for the elopement, which fails miserably. The
bona-fide damsel gets away in a carriage, but
Miss Brown falls into the handcuffs of a detective
after a long unladylike struggle, and next morn-
ing a tattered, unshaven caricature of woman-
hood, with its wig out of curl, is restored to the
bosom of the boarding-school. A quite moral and
satisfactory denouement is brought about by the
news that the captain’s uncle has died, leaving him
an earldom and wealth untold, whereupon “ Miss
Brown ” shakes her muddy petticoats at the lady-
principal and reveals the awful truth. The truth,
coming from the stubbly lips of a live earl, is joy.
fully received.
• * * *
Frank Thornton, as the masquerading
captain, repeats his previous success in skirts.
Miss Brown, dropping curtseys to the high
priestess, or nestling among the other boarders
whilst Angela (the bride) punches a pillow to
relieve her feelings, is an extravagantly droll im-
postor. Moreover, a real atmosphere of ladies’
school life pervades the joke, a particularly good
character sketch being an ardent Red Indian sort
of boarder, played by Miss Bessie Rignold. New-
comers in Fred Shepherd and Miss Flsie Carew
make successful appearances as the major and the
schoolmistress ; also Miss Seabrooke is a pleasing
bride. Another fresh arrival, Herbert Terry, fills
the part of a German music-teacher effectively,
although his accent is very mixed and variable.
The remainder of the cast is mostly an assortment
of virgin pupils, who giggle and fix up their hair-
pins with artless abandon. “Miss Brown”
should run far into the holidays.

“ For England,” produced in Sydney a
while ago, and just now raging at Melb. Royal,
is Bland Holt’s fourteenth libel on Dutch courage.
Indomitable Britons slaughter contemptible Boers
at all points in this ramshackle narrative without
the slightest regard for history. “ For England ”
makes only one concession to the enemy. The
villain is Hinglish by birth, instead of being a
Boer, but, considering that this iniquitous person
occupies an exalted position in the Boer camp,
and hurls “ curse you !” at every Afrikander who
questions his authority, the aforesaid concession
doesn’t amount to much.
* * * *
Probably it was a mistake on the author’s
part, anyhow. An elaborate representation of a
fox-hunt, a series of desperate rescues and glorious
victories in foreign parts, together with an amiable
specimen of stage Hebrew, explained the hearty
reception of “ For England ” on Boxing Night.
The scenery is irresistible, and the tender-hearted
Jew money-lender (Bland Holt) fills a long-felt
want. Having lent his substance to the British
army on philanthropic terms, the financier watches
over the army’s interests in the character of a
friendly Zulu, and fires off funny remarks at the
contending forces. Bland Holt has never re-
velled in a “fatter” part. Miss Frances Ross
and Miss Watson, likewise Cosgrove (who is a
harmless dude for a change), assist in relieving the
monotony of the eternal feud between Baker and
Albert Norman. A word of encouragement is
likewise due to the girl who went wrong. Her in-
discretion serves to divert her thoughts from the
British Flag.

The Wild-Cat Column,
A few days before the prorogation of N.S.W.
Parliament the “Additional Loan Estimates” were un-
obtrusively run through. They amounted to *210,718.
The original Loan Estimates authorised the expenditure
within the year of *2,020,000 on “ permanent and repro-
ductive works” (including *26,000 for arms and ammuni-
tion, *35,000 for cutting down scrub, &c., *3600 for
roads, £376,000 for bridges, dredging, &c., *147,000 for
gaols, lock-ups, repairs, patches, statues, and the like, and
*300,000, or thereabouts, for other unprofitable sundries).
The new estimates provide *150,000 of borrowed money
for dismantling the old Sydney steam trams, which were
built with borrowed money and haven’t yet been paid for,
and replacing them with an electric service; also
*40,000 for repairs to Government House (which was
built with borrowed money and is now being patched
with ditto), for building police-stations in the far west,
sundry offices, some alterations to a park, a drain or two,
and other like wreckage. Out of the £210,000 only
£20,000 is distinctly reproductive. And the above shreds
and patches are what the Reid Government calls “ per-
manent and reproductive works.”
¥ * * *
S.A. is spending .£414,000 of loan money this
year. Its “permanent and reproductive public works”
include £2772 as the province’s contribution to the
defence of Thursday Island (Q.) and King George’s Sound
(Westralia), a sum towards the cost of an expedition sent
out to look for a new stock route to W.A.—the Aus-
tralian nowadays can’t explore except with borrowed
money —*3500 for guns, £9OOO for school buildings, and
similar investments. The Ministry which puts down an
exploring expedition to “permanent and reproductive
works” has a fine gift of finance.

The National Bank of Tasmania presents a
balance-sheet which calls for considerable execration.
The half-year’s profits are £3534 against £4299, *4136, and
£3989 for three previous half-years. Out of this the
board pays a 5 per cent, dividend which, with income-
tax, absorbs £3991, or £457 more than the scanty earn-
ings. This leaves £1575 to be carried forward. Two
years ago the balance was £1607, but in June, ’95, the
National paid a bigger dividend than it had earned, and
it does the same now, and at other times its dividend ran
the earnings very close indeed, so that the net result for
two years is a reduction of its funds by £32. The
National of Tasmania is 11 years old. It has a capital of
*152,040, and a reserve of £22,500. Its dividend has
dwindled from 8 to 5 per cent., and the necessity for
further reducing it to 4 per cent, sticks out conspicuously.
Four per cent, may not be much of adiv., but it is evi-
dently all that the institution can afford just now. The
business seems about the same as it was two or three
years ago, and the large cash reserve ( 1109,000) equals 30
per cent, of the liabilities to the public. If the National
put *20,000 ot this unwieldy mass of cash into State
securities the interest would improve its profits consider-
ably. Otherwise the report gives the usual scarcity of
information, and the decline is set down to the con-
venient depression, and there is nothing in the figures
to cast any light on the solvency or otherwise of the
National’s affairs.

The Central Queensland Land Corporation is
announced in London, its object being “to acquire a
practical monopoly ” of the land around Gladstone,
Queensland. Gladstone has a magnificent deep-water
harbor, and would have been the biggest town north of
Brisbane—only the Fat Men of the day had ground at
Rockhampton, and the railway was started from there so
as to bring trade and boom the town and send up prices.
Consequently, to meet the railway, steamers plod 40 miles
up the dismal, muddy, shallow river, and thereby incur
great expense, and go aground three times on an average
each voyage, while the harbor at Gladstone is deserted.
If a powerful syndicate gets afloat it will probably secure
a western railway connection for Gladstone, and then the
forlorn town will begin to move, and J. Bull will annex the
profits of the boom. A great, large, gorgeous boom
swindle has been waiting to be done at Gladstone for
many years, but no institution had the pluck to do it with-
out the inevitable British capital.

One “ labor-agent ” —this sort of pirate calls
himself a “registry office” —shamelessly circularises his
possible patrons to this effect: —Quarterly subscription,
ss.membership ” ends when the “member” has ob-
tained a billet through the “ office,” even though that
billet may not last a month; fees —“for commercial
situations, one week’s salary (!) ; for professional, educa-
tional, or other appointments, 5 per cent, on one year’s
salary (!!); minimum charge, 10s.” If Outowork gets a
billet at 15s. a week, and has to pay £1 railway and coach
fare, and 10s. to the “registry” cormorant, he having
already paid 5s as “subscription” for “membership,”
and if he gets “the run ” in (say) a fortnight —not an
uncommon practice, by collusion with the “ labor-agent ”
—and has to pay his return-fare to Sydney, he will be just
£1 ss. out of pocket in cash, to say nothing about
the cost of his living while dawdling as a “ member ”
around the “ registry ” office. The Bulletin not long
ago showed how at least one “labor-agent” was in a
business conspiracy with an employer to halve all the
fees from billetees, said employer, on his part, agreeing
to find some excuse to break even a six months’ agree-
ment within a few weeks by discovering faults in his
servant. Those who suck the blood of the miserable un-
employed deserve no consideration from law. Here is
exposed a direction in which it is the clear duty of a
democratic State to interfere with the “liberty of the
subject.”

Outspoken opinion of Labor-member Stewart,
M.P. for Rockhampton North (Q.), on the Electric Power
and Light (shindykit) Bill : “It’s as big a swindle as the
land-grant scheme was.” To do it justice, it isn’t quite.
A municipality concerned has the right—the sole right
during 42 years—to compete with the “ existing com-
pany ” at any time. That is the Act’s only safeguard.
The provision that the “order in council may limit the
term, under which the “ existing eo.” is not bound to sell
to a municipal or local body, and that 42 years is only a
permissible maximum “ life,” is not worth considering—in
Queensland.

Time that the Vie. Crown Law department
ceased to play the fool with public money. Thousands of
pounds have been squandered in make-believe bank pro-
secutions, and now the cable brings word that a hopeless
appeal by the V.C.L. department to the Privy Council
was dismissed last week. This represented a third unsuc-
cessful attempt to outrage common sense in the matter of
probate duty on the late William Pearson’s will. Pearson
(the Long Tunnel mine capitalist) died soon after the
Smellbourne financial crisis, and his executors valued his
deposit receipts in reconstructed banks at current market
rates. The Vic. Muster-in-Equity, who is the same thing
as the Crown Law department, claimed probate duty on
the face value of the documents in question. A fresh
struggle in the local courts resulted in a verdict for the
executors. Under the circumstances an appeal to the
Full Court was disgraceful. The appeal from the Full
Court to the Privy Council was a sin, and the men respon-
sible for it deserve to be dismissed likewise.

that it is produced without any of Bull’s gold to help it

Writes a Barrier correspondent There is going
to be an explosion on the Barrier some day that will go a
long way towards wiping it off the face of the globe.
Right on the borders of the town, on what is known as
the North Reserve, are a number of magazines, always
chock-full of dynamite, gelignite, gelatine, gunpowder, and
other fracteurs. Under the regulations but a certain
quantity can be stored in each magazine—the magazines
being small, galvanised-iron affairs—but the limit is a
liberal one, and there are lots of possibilities about the
business.

It is the practice of a number of London finan-
cial and mining “ weeklies ” —born and fed by the W.A.
boom while it lasted, and now dying with it-i-to publish
big Westralian crushings, omit the poorones, and include
the tailings assays amongst the returns as if the gold had
been extracted and sent to the Mint. This idea is cer-
tainly very rich, considering that nine cases in ten the
statements made re gold in tailings are lies manufactured
to get around tight corners, and that in nine out of every
other ten cases whatever gold is left in tailings stays
there.

From the Norseman, W.A. : “Things are not
too bright here, I am sorry to say. The impression is
that many of the mines will not re-open after the general
exemption. The open-call for prices of a large majority
of the shows has dwindled to almost nothing, a sign of
what the local people think of the field. Ignorant mining
managers have helped to damn it. The correct thing seems
to be to sink 50ft. and then start a fresh shaft until the
ground is fairly scratched, rooted and riddled. What do
you think of a dozen shafts on one lease ? Well, you have
it here. Money by thousands has been frittered away.
When men begin to talk of 15dwt. instead of 2*4oz. the
field may do something, but at present things look blue.”

Eight tons of ore crushed at the Mt. Burgess

something bigger than an 8-ton lot next time.

In his Nineteenth Century article Van Oss
calculates that the profit made by mining in Westralia
this year will be a miserable fraction of 1 per cent, on the
share capital. He describes the ways of the W.A. floater
in London, the lies of prospectuses, the paid—well-paid-
newspaper puffs, and the wiles of finance co’s. But the
warning comes too late. The promoter and boomster
have been and gone with the spoils. And there are too
many of them to gaol.

So much has been said by newspapers concerning
the great richness of a W.A. mine called M‘Clay’s Welcome
that naturally the writer had a suspicion about it. The
W.A. newspaper-mine is usually cursed, any way. The

buting shares are down to 9d. Boomed weekly by wire
and tipped religiously on the Sabbath.

The booming of little Dr. Simon’s operations is
now largely confined to the Norseman mines, where, we
are told, crushing will commence in April, that there are
immense bodies of ore to work on, and success is assured.
Perhaps so, but alas ! we had the same story of his other
mines. The Australasian, a year ago, according to that
great authority, “ Smiler,” had any amount of lOoz. ore;
the Hill End, which cost some £3o,oooand has not crushed
for a year, also had wondrous prospects ; the New Vic-
toria was bought by the doctor for some £40,000 more
than a year ago, and nothing heard of it since Who
puts up all this money, and how do they feel about it up

Pups turning dog: “ The Londonderry North
and South gold-mine, for which the co. paid £lO,OOO and
upon which £5OOO has been spent, has been sold to Mr.
C. Kidman, Coolgardie, for £4OO cash.” Thus endeth the
fate of junipers. These blocks were jumped by Lyons
and Court from the findersof the Londonderry, who made
a technical mistake. The jumpers sold to a Perth crowd
of whom Alick —we forget his other name ! —was the
most prominent. Thj jumpers won all along the line.
The writer thought they would, but the line was a long
one. Tne Londonderry people, having dollied out £30,000
in gold and having a £lO,OOO deposit and their mine as
good as sold for £lBO,OOO, were in fighting trim, and they
soon found some lawyers to keep the game going. No
less than £50,000 was offered for the leases with the
proviso that the title be made unquestionable. The sud-
denness of the collapse of the Londondei ry golden hole
was only equalled by the celerity with which the £50,000
offer was withdrawn immediately afterwards. The
men who stood to the jumpers went down for £15,000,
and as they now sell for £4OO the loss by the famous jump
is just £14,600.

The scapegoat of delay now in W.A. is “the
iniquity of the lahor conditions.” The representatives of
the English co.’s holding leases say that the excessive
stringency of the labor conditions is driving capital out
of the. country. Now, they have the same 3-acres-to-a-
man in W.A. as they have in Queensland and M.L.
Miners’ wages in most of the fields, say in Coolgardie,
Kalgoorlie, Menzies, Kanowna, and Black Flag and Broad
Arrow are £3 ss. a week. The English boomsters say
this is extortion. Yet they have appointed, and are still
appointing, mine managers at £l5OO a year. One of these
£l5OO a year men turned up lately, a week after
he was due, amongst the drunks at the police court, and
he would most likely have made an item in Lloyd’s

Gladiators mine.—W.A. Prof. Nicholas’s official
report is not quite so glowing as this summary of it in the
Financial Times : “ Eleven shafts sunk depths varying
from 30 to 87ft. One reef proved for 1000 ft. to average
lift, in thickness. Ore in sight estimated to be worth not
less than £40,000, in fine gold shoots met with in the
proved 1000 ft. No ore stoped, can be cheaply mined and
milled. One of the richest mines in the district of Cool-
gardie.”

by erecting batteries, comparatively speaking, long ago,
does not strengthen any argument in favor of general
permanency of the Coolgardie lodes. A geological truth
is, that payable lodes do not ‘ live ’ to any great depth in
very hard country. Most of the ‘country’ enclosing
lodes on Coolgardie is diorite harder than the average
mining expert’s cheek.”

The Great Boulder now keeps all its glory to
itself. One time it shed a good deal on other mines, some
a long way off, but pretty close to it in name. Boulders
are running in London at about £B. What price the
others? Boulder Central Extended, Is. 2d. ; Boulder
Consols No. 1,2 s. s\d. ; Boulder North Extended, 2s. 3d.;
Imperial Boulder, 4s. sd. ; Boulder >4 Mile South, fid.
There are several more “Boulders” running from Is. a
dozen up to Is. each, and quite a number have dropped
out altogether.

The awful collapse in London of W.A. mining-
stocks has received the attention of the big papers, while
the little weaklings born and nursed for no other purpose
than to shriek boom are again giving reasons. Water,
machinery, and the want of a railway, have been played
right out. Now it is all on account of the “ bears.” The
Daily Mail declares that W.A. market has always been
rotten and supported by trickery, and that there is only
one strong syndicate left in it. It sees no hope of the
slightest recovery, and says the only course for investors
drawn into it is to take what they can get and quit.
Statist says it was assumed that conditions existed
similar to the Rand, where calculations as to tonnage and
contents can be made on sound bases, but W.A. reefs
pinch and disappear so suddenly that no idea can be
gained as to what the life of a mine is. Daily Chronicle
trenchantly alludes to the fact that of mines representing
66 millions capital only one pays regular divs. It is satis-
fied that not one-tenth of the money sent to W.A. from
London will ever find its way back to those who sub-
scribed it. Altogether the howl of discontent has started
in dead earnest.

Coolgardie, disappointed in the Menzies rail-

scheme for the construction of an Esperance-Coolgardie

has framed some dozen formidable resolutions in connec-
tion with the matter, and is a shining light in the agita-

Editor Bulletin. — I was down the General
Gordon mine lately, and, as the result of inspection, pro-
nounced her a wild cat of relentless ferocity. She may
pan out a couple of good crushings, and then, as an ex-
manager remarked to me in Melb. recently, “ Godelper !”
The rich shoot of opaline quartz cut out in the south
shaft on being sunk on, all the faces thereabouts being in
chloritic schist. Likewise various drives and cross-cuts
from the bottom of the north shafts as well as the engine
shaft, are all in the same unpromising material. The
lode formation is most erratic in its course, and is
traversed by small and uncertain leaders of opaline
quartz and ironstone from which the best prospects
are obtained. The winding plant is set down
close against the main shaft. When the engine starts
winding she will probably pull the entrails out of the
shaft and overturn the poppet-heads.—Yours, The Mug.
Kanowna, Nov. 22, 1896.
A truly wise provision in the new Victorian
Mines Hill is the one enacting that at least 2*4 per cent,
of Ihe profits shall, in every case, be reserved for the
development and opening up of the mine. The regular
procedure is to spend every available coin in dividends ;
then when the reef run's out to make calls for further
opening up, and when the shareholders grow tired of
call-paying to shut up the mine. There are dozens of
good mines in Victoria which paid glorious dividends,
and then when the “streak” gave out presently closed
up, for want of a little available cash with which to search
for a new formation.

The New Loch Fyne (Vic.) is becoming a con-
sistent producer—last crushing, 940 tons, 11290 z. Central
Plateau, 813 tons, 6560z.—g00d enough, but the boom has
faded. Ballarat booms are usually short-lived. South
Star, 1370 tons, 678 oz.—good enough for divs.

Mt. Lyell tally for four weeks ended Nov. 19:
Ore treated, 5483 tons; matte, 571 tons containing
300 tons copper, 15,1670 z. silver, and 1140 oz. gold.
Allowing 10 cubic feet of the average grade of ore to the
ton there are 11 million tons in sight without going
below 500 ft. If this estimate is fairly correct, Mt. Lyell
is good for 600,000 tons of copper, 30,000,0000 z. silver and
2,280,0000 z. gold.

Maoriland Crown mine, for the month, 1188
tons, 26000 z. bullion, value £4628. Value should always

ings. It is rumored that some of the big crushings of the
Merizies field, W.A., are made up of gold mixed with man-
ganese and other base metals, adding to weight and
reducing value, concerning which the W.A. newspapers
and wire-hummers maintain a w'onderful unanimity of

E. C. Lobb, the finder of one of the Queensland
goldfields, has just returned from New Guima, and while
returning was so impressed by the number of men he met
going Papua-wards in search of gold that he thinks some
warning is necessary. He admits good gold is being got
in New Guinea, that the island should be better explored
by expeditions with plenty of money, and that on several
of the small islands gold is being worked, some 1500 oz.
having been obtained last year by himself and others on
Marua. But the locality of the rush is a longwav inland
in the Mt. Soratchley district. To reach it, a swampy and
fever-stricken river has to be navigated, and numerous
high ranges have to be orossed, and, in the absence of a
track, this is next to impossible. The first prospectors
were assisted by about 100 natives, but so many aborigi-
nals died on the way back that they have retired from
this business. Of the few men who got there a big
percentage have died. The rush is not warranted by the
amount of alluvial gold got to date, and fully one-half of
the men who attempt it will never reach the field, or, at
least, will never come away alive.
* * * *
As soon as summer is on the wane, a rush to
New Guinea is a certainty. Many a poor devil will lose
the number of his mess in Papua, for the old Gulf remedies
of quinine and Worcestershire sauce are of little avail
against the Guinea fevers and malaria.

The Macarthur-Forrest cyanide patent has col-
lapsed as far as South Africa is concerned. The High
Court of the Transvaal, from which there is no appeal,
has decided against it, and, as more gold is produced by
cyanidation in South Africa than in the rest of the world
(the local yield last year being over 600,OOOoz.), this deci-
sion may be regarded as the death-blow of the patent.
The fight against it will now be renewed throughout Aus-
tralasia.

Of late, the dark and gory horror hasn’t
been at all well distributed in Australia. Victoria
had Deeming and the decomposed wife under the

FREDDY : “ Mother is going to buy me a bicycle, Mr. Wheeler.”

FREDDY : “ But that will make them big. You ought to see ma’s leys since
she’s been riding.”
baby-farmer and the dead infant buried in the
flower-garden. Next N.S.W. had Mrs. Makin
and her gruesome cemetery in the back-yard, and
now it has the Glenbrook ghoul and his graveyard
in the Blue Mountains. Meanwhile Queensland,
S. A., Westralia and Tasmania haven’t raised one
really mysterious horror among them for quite a
long time. Also, N.S.W. has had two horrors to
Victoria’s one, which is doubtless owing to the
beneficent influences of Freetrade. A country
which languishes in the gloom and shackles of
Protection is bound to go short in its horror.
There is just a chance that that Union s.s. co
captain who boarded the Swanhilda and gave the
captain a pile of papers containing an account of
the Glenbrook mystery may have put his foot in
it badly. Supposing Butler, or whatever his name
may be, is on board : The captain may promptly
shove him down below in irons, and keep him
there until he is wanted. Or, again, he may do
nothing at all except let the news leak out, and
the wanted man may suicide, and thus spoil a
grand trial and a really beautiful hanging. Or, if
the vessel gets very close to land anywhere before
reaching California, Butler may take a desperate
chance and get ashore. Or, again, he may still
be aboard when the Swanhilda arrives at the
Golden Gate, but, being warned of the trouble to
come, he may start promiscuous shooting at the
local police, and, as a result, he may be scragged
in a strange land, far from the refining and
softening influences of home, and the moral lesson
may be wholly lost to this country. Altogether,
The Bulletin regards that Union captain as a
foolish, meddlesome person whose conduct in
touching the paint to see if it was dry may end by
spoiling the picture altogether.

The much-wanted and discussed prospector
suspected of the “ mountain murders ” seems to
have been penurious as well as bloodthirsty. For
instance, he struck out two words in his decoy
“ advt.” at Newcastle to save 6d. His fatal mis-
take of personating Lee Weller was due to a desire
to save passage-money. “On the voyage one is
always making a bit,” was his excuse for not pay-
ing for a passage. Then, after “making a rise,”
he put up at 6d. restaurants and sailors’ homes.
People marvel at any man assassinating others
for the sake of <£s or so, but the case is not with-
out precedent: Nicholls and Lester, for instance,
killed their victims for even less. From at least
one they got only a very poor silver watch, sold
for 135., and a box of olothes on which they realised
18s. 6d. Like the mountain murderer, they car-
ried on a wholesale business and went for “small
profits and quick returns.” Even if the mountain
man killed and buried only three people a fort-
night and netted A 5 per head on them, his income
would exceed the official pay of a member of
Parliament.

that if they apologised
to his complete satis-
faction for past in-
sults offered during
attempted collection
of the bill, he would
pay up with interest.
Inside three days he
collected more diffe-
rent kinds of abject
apology than he had

where the scheme
w-ent wrong was that

The somersault cure is the
very latest remedy for fatness.
When a stout lady of 50 or so learns
to turn somersaults it is alleged
that the exercise has a fascination
which makes her keep at it, and by
daily repetition she grows slender
and muscular. In the early stages
of the business she has naturally
to be helped over by an instructress
—that is to say, she lies down flat,
and an athletic lady seizes her by
the ankles, and stands her on her
head and then lets her drop. But
after a while she gains confidence
in herself and in her knicker-
bockers, and whirls her stout limbs
over her head “ on her own,” with-
out the slightest difficulty. When
she has learned to do this act
without assistance and without
coming down with a stunning
whack on her front part, the fas-
cination is said to take hold of her,
and after that she is liable to keep
on turning somersaults till she is
70 or more.

An Adelaide Lady's Plain Advice to

Probably there is no lady more widely or favor-
ably known m Adelaide than Mrs. M. Davis of
the “ Kensington Academy of Music,” Kensington
I errace, and her experience must carry conviction
to every lady reader. Many ladies have already
profited by her advice given verbally, and many
more who read this will doubtless profit by its
evident reasoning. Speaking of good health and
Warners oafe Cure—which go together—in a
letter dated Sept. 25, 1896, she says : “For nearly
ten years I have used no other medicine, neither
for myself nor children, and have recommended it
to everyone suffering from liver complaint or in-
digestion. I strongly recommend it to all young
girls and women.
ior years. I had been a great sufferer from
attacks of colic or spasms. I was drawn double
with pain, and Warner’s Safe Diabetes Cure gave
me immediate relief. It is also a safe-guard
against the evil effects of that terrible scourge,
the Russian Influenza/ I was stricken with it
last November, and attribute my complete re-
covery entirely to Warner’s Safe Diabetes Cure.
I only recommend it in dessertspoonfuls three
times a day for adults ; and children, ten years of
teaspoonful doses.” There are many brave
women who have suffered as she has done, who are
nearly broken down, and who need to-day a true
friend, and whom Warner’s Safe Cure will make
well and strong again.
From July 18, 1824, to December 30,
1826, 76 executions took place at Hobart, and 30
at Launceston. One hundred and six judicial
murders in 17 months. At the end of that period
Parson Horton wrote to Sydney for help, saying :
“ The wickedness of the people exceeds all descrip-

“ Rhine Violet ”), and “Preciosa,” the sweetest

possibly trickle through on to the floor of the cart*
Therefore, if any customer chanced to imagine
that there was anything wrong with his breakfast
sausage next day he had the comforting assurance
that it couldn t possibly be the late aboriginal who
was the matter, unless that person had happened
to come through the bag, which the co. regards as
quite improbable. Whether the meat and the
aboriginal were or were not in the cart at the same
time doesn t appear; no one, apparently, even
thought of mentioning that aspect of the case.
. The next trouble arose through a chemist writ-
ing to the local paper to the effect that it wasn’t a
nice thing to carry a dead nigger in a meat-cart
whereupon an employe of the Meat Co. knocked
hnn down m the street, and stepped on him con-
siderably. He also stepped on a man who came
to the chemist s assistance. Whereupon the case
got into court, and a magistrate who was much
too civilised for the great West fined the butcher-
man <£3 10s., and stated that it was very wrong*
indeed to carry a dead nigger about in a meat-
cart, however recent the deceased might be, and
that the practice of jumping on people who o'bject
to dead niggers on the meat required to be put
down. And Roebourne in general is now holding
its nose and regarding its breakfast chop with a
cold shudder.

From Pearson’s
Weekly :
The black cannibals of
Northern Queensland
are exceeding partial to
Chinamen. The reason
is said to be that the
flesh of the Chinese is
peculiarly tender and
palatable, owing to rice
being their staple article
of diet. There is now a
nurnerousChinese popu-
lation in the north of
Queensland, and scores
of them who have ven-
tured beyond the con-
fines of civilisation have
been captured and de-
voured by the natives.
But our London con-
temporary misses the
sequel, which is now
ancient history in
Australia. Wily

A Bulletin cor-
respondent :
Life in this Q. district
is very primitive and
idyllic. The place is
chiefly inhabited by Ger-
man. families, a very in-
dustrious, economical,
and self-reliant class,
and very prolific. With-
in a radius of 20 miles
from me there are nine
(unmarried) girls who
have had one youngster
apiece. They go back
to service in the city,
and leave the cherub
with a married sister or
grandmother. It is all
taken as a matter of
course. There is no
baby-farming here: they
are all strong and
healthy. Lately one
girl came home on a
visit to her mother ; left
twins; and went to
service again. There
never was but one main-
tenance case, and the
hank - clerk concerned
squared it by giving
the old man £5O. Nothing to boast of, perhaps, but it’s
better than Sheridanisation.

The other day a deputation of Vic. police
officers waited upon Chief Sec. Peacock to protest
against the further promotion of one Sergeant
Fowler, who, it would seem, has profited unduly
through the influence of baronet Clarke, or because
he was an amateur sergeant-major in the Ruperts-
wood battery before he joined the police as a drill-
instructor. Peacock promised to consider the
possibility of checking this fortunate young man’s
flight over the heads of older, harder-working
sergeants, and The Bulletin herewith records
Peacock’s promise for the reason that the little
matter was not reported at all in the respectable
Sup-press.
LEARNING HIS TRADE.

Apparently the days of the lunatics who
light their pipes with bank-notes are not quite
over. The other day a Brisbane bacchanalian
entered a pub. and ate a £5 note for the edification
of bystanders. Becoming uproarious, he was run
in by the police, and, when sobered up, proved to
be worth precisely 4Ad. Perhaps he fancied
himself a Queensland M.L.A. engaged (to use a
Ministerial phrase) “in digesting a new Bank
Bill.”

The other day a demented artist drove up
to the gates of Melb. Government House for the
purpose of dying, if possible, in Lord Brassey’s
arms. He had lost all desire for life, the stranger
explained, and his beau ideal for decease was to
fall into a long, last sleep upon his Excellency’s
bosom. The vice-regal flunkeys gave the crazy
artist into police custody, instead of conducting
him to Lord Brassey. One glance at that prosaic
nobleman would probably have cured the poor
fellow on the spot.

In Monte Video (South America), accord-
ing to the report of the policeman who brought
back Geake, the pious Gentleman One who
absconded from his bail, legal pioceedings are
conducted on the most courteous principles.
When the prisoner is brought into court, if he is
a reasonably clean and gentlemanly prisoner, the
judge shakes hands with him and possibly gives
him a light for his cigar, and inquires after his
health. The prisoner reciprocates and trusts that
the judge is well. Also the judge, the lawyers on
both sides, the principal officials and the witnesses
shake hands and exchange greetings. The prisoner
is courteously offered a chair, and then business
proceeds. In the course of the trial the judge
and the prisoner address each other in terms of
courteous equality. The Yic. policeman was filled
with scorn at these formalities, and the Melbourne
press talks of Uruguayan justice with contumely.
In Australia, also, the law professes to regard the
untried prisoner as an innocent man who is the
equal of any other citizen, and it acts up to its
theory by ordering him to stand up in a dirty
enclosure behind a row of spikes, while a huge
policeman stands alongside to suppress him
instantly if he attempts to speak to the judge in
any terms except those of abject grovel. And
even if the accused was the most perfect gentleman
in the land, any attempt to shake hands with his
Honor would probably lead to his immediate
execution in the backyard.

Highway robbery is pretty well extinct in
the Australian provinces' but the churches and

under alms.
In a N.S.W. country gaol, the other day,
a chaplain coming to deliver his customary warn-
ing to the wicked to flee from the wrath to come
was closely followed by the visiting gaol dentist.
Latter, being pressed for time, besought that any
who wanted his attentions might be excused from
attendance at the service. The request being
granted, every man-jack of the chaplain’s flock
discovered that he was the owner of a troublesome
molar.
TWELVE O’CLOCK.
A last farewell to Ninety-six,
The old year fading out of view;
Some incidental conscience-pricks
Remind us that it once was new.
What vows were made ! and, O, how few
Have left a lasting trace behind
To indicate the road to Heaven.
Salvation, though, we hope to find
In Ninety-seven.
Fain would each weary bardlet quote,
With well-considered sob or sigh,
Pathetic lines he dreamt he wrote
Whilst Ninety-six went rolling by.
Those verses, that would never die,-
Remain unborn : their music rings
As yet upon no waking ear ;
But we will do gigantic things
This glad New Year.
Here’s to the girl whom we loved best
A dozen vanished months ago !
Perchance the passion then professed
Still keeps an erring heart aglow
With thoughts of dearest So-and-so.
Well, here’s Her health, who e’en to-day
Imparts to life unworldly leaven !
Good wine—good girls--good luck—Hooray
For Ninety-sheven !

WE OFTEN FEEL LIKE THAT.
The sea, a silver hunting-case,
Shuts in God’s watch, the sky,
Jewelled in many holes, that Space
Move not through Time awry.
The headland, like a sofa couched,
Is resting on the Night,
And where its rocky nose is crouched
The waves snore calm delight.
Upon the beach are men who wait
On Providence and sharks :
The moon observes their anguished state,
But does not make remarks.
I dream of epics, odes sublime,
Lyrics without a flaw,
A sonnet-pearl whose stately chime
Shall trance the world in awe :
Exquisite true-love knots Of words
Tied tight in tenderness ;
A song of stars, a song of birds,
With each note a caress.
There is poetry in the air,
Poetry in the sea,
Poetry in the heavens fair—
But, alas ! there’s none in me.

As ever was a summer sky ;
Her iris is the heavenly blue
That shines the fleece-white cloud-bank through,
And I the earth that looks up at
The summer heavens beneath her hat.

A WOMAN’S LETTER .
Sydney, Dec. 29, 189 G.
Mr Dear Myee—
Boxing Day races at Randwick were surprisingly
festive, and more like a Spring meeting than a
Summer one for crowds and dresses. Everybody
had on her best frock, which ran to most expensive
materials, silks and muslins with no signs of wear
and tear. The prettiest figure there was swathed
in a mysteriously-folded bodice of white silk with
no visible means of “ hooking-up,” and a magpie
skirt, and belonged to a tall, slender, city waitress.
A lovely shot silk with puffy chiffon sleeves was
carried about, to the envy of surrounding woman-
kind, by an oofy-looking person with touzled hair.
Fruit dangling from hats gave a “ cheer-up-
cherries-are-ripe ” appearance to the wearers.
Golden hair was largely worn ; more than one
woman looked as if her front name was Maudie
and her second name merely pro tern. The girls
seemed nice, but not altogether Nice, though one
in pink muslin and an artless fichu might come
under both categories. Also there was a military
magnate’s daughter in white, whose parent made
himself reminiscent of India’s torrid clime by
carrying around a huge green-and-white sunshade.
The gilded (and otherwise) youth were mostly
gorgeous in the very latest variety, dark-blue
flannel variously striped—some white, some red.
This draping is largely taking the place of blue
serge, because it is just as smart and is washable.
It was invented for the revolting Guards who
were sent to Bermuda a short time ago ; the lordly
officers could not be expected to conform to out-
landish fashions and give up their style, so an
enterprising tailor was inspired with a great idea
combining cut with coolth, and now the new
notion has caught on everywhere.
The wind on Saturday turned Randwick stand
and lawn into a shoe-show. Vast No. 6’s peeped
coyly out from beneath many a graceful gown and
spoiled the effect, and the woman with shabby
boots below a gorgeous top-dressing was given
away at once. The prize for pretty feet would
have easily fallen to a popular comedy actress,
who, with her sister and brother-in-law, defied the
wind in front of the stand, proudly conscious of
hoofy perfection, which high heels and pointed
toes only served to accentuate.
On Xmas Eve the pantomime at Her Majesty’s
was in rather a chaotic condition of pink tights,
beaded tunics recalling memories of Jimmy
M‘Mahon’s celebrated “bead ballet,” red-legged
imps, green Nautch girls, and general gauziness.
The audience softly folded itself up like the Arab
and silently melted away by large instalments
before the end, for the show didn’t look as if it
were coming to any conclusion at very little to
midnight. The d.e. was occupied largely by
friends and relatives of the performers. An
Amurkan girl showed triumphantly how to look
cool in a scarlet blouse—a very useful wrinkle, as
red is the coming color. Eva Clements, as second
boy, wore a purple suit with huge sleeves, which
made her loom larger than Stella Esdaile, as Boy
No. 1, who wore no sleeves and very little tunic,
and therefore looked comparatively important.
The only stage woman who could successfully put
all her four limbs on exhibition at one and the
same time was Addie Conyers.
Minna Phillips, tied up in gauze bags,
looked Turkish, and sang with Sinbad the prettiest
and most catchy duet in the piece. There is very
little haunting music in this year’s panto. You
don’t dream about its warble, and hear it on the
midnight breeze. “ Good old Santa Claus ” and
“ The Greatest Show on Earth ” are the only two
tunes that stick after one hearing. W. Crackles
has piany new hats, but nary a new song. Mrs.
Lucifer, the new importation, possesses some
pretty skirts, a “ vurry Amurrican ” accent, an
unoriginal dance-step, and a husband who holds
the world’s record for high-kicking. In the
variety scene the girls all wear assorted colors in
tights and look like a box of Xmas crackers.
An Australian girl tells that when staying in
England she visited an unfashionable watering-
place with some friends, and at first felt rather
shy about using the only out-of-season bathing-
machine in the place, said implement being run
by an aged longshoreman. A half-century of
gazing at dipping womankind had made him
blase, and when he saw the new-comer’s hesita-
tion he wearily remarked : “ Lor’, Miss, don’t
mind me. I’ve been at this business 40 year and
legs is as common to me as breakfus’.” A single
visit to the Panto, is calculated to produce the
same feeling, there is so much nether limb in it.
The Centennial Hall was crowded at the usual
“Messiah” performance. A heaviness, as if
hecatombs of roast-goose and mountains of plum-
pudding were piled on its chest, always hangs over
that regulation Xmas-night production. There is
only one thing in music more weighty, and that
is Bach’s Xmas Oratorio, and fortunately nobody
can live through that, and so it is never per-
formed. The man who takes in the “ Messiah ”
as he takes in his dinner on the great annual fes-
tival of over-feeding, is usually the stodgv person
who gloats over the wailing goose” in his
back-yard for weeks before he performs the
Lee Weller act on it at Christmas Eve
and then feasts with iron nerve and jaw upon the
murdered fowl. He is of the soulless sort who
would keep a parrot and train it to cry like a
child to the joy of his neighbors, and has framed
texts hanging in his sitting-room, and a favorite
deceased dog stuffed on a stand, and glaring down
at him with a twisted smile and cold, glassy eye-
balls. Next century, when cremation is “ in,” his
descendant will arrange all his dead relatives in
pots along his dining-room mantelpiece, and point
out to his guests the cinerary urns of dear Aunt
Jane and the ash of Cousin William.
A Xmas treat to sailors was given last week by
some well-meaning but unworldly missioners who
regard Jack in the foc’s’le as a gentle babe, a
cross between a Sunday scholar and an uncon-
verted Hindoo. So they gave 300 of him a tea-
meeting in the George-street rooms : and after
swallowing enough weak fluid to float an ironclad,
the patients were allowed to run away and play
till the subsequent concert began. It was of the
mildly religious type. The nautical feeling was
intensified by a hornpipe benignly smiled upon by
some kind ladies who also patted poor Jack upon
the back, so to speak, and told him to be a good
little boy. The pious command was emphasised
by the present of a Xmas card, a cracker, and a
buttonhole bouquet. Why seamen should be thus
specially favored with infantile gifts is hard to
say. _ Nobody would think of organising a
mission to other trades and decorating a
long procession of, say, fish hawkers or
auctioneers or bookmakers with floral tributes.
But the merchant seaman is expected to
treasure up the little mementoes of his joyfully
riotous Xmas treat, and as he folds his hands
meekly and says “ Now I lay me down to sleep ”
before turning into his bunk every night at sea,
to press reverently to his lips the faded flowers
given him by the kind ladies at the Sydney Mis-
sion Hall.
Miss Emily Hughes, as the deserted wife in
“Tommy Atkins,” begins her career gaudily in a
white gown topped off with bright blue, but dis-
cards color with convention, and takes her father's
curse and her subsequent way through the cold
and snowy world without a hat. Instead, she
wears a stiff, wooden baby wrapped in a shawl.
In the course of the play she discards baby,
too, but the infant subsequently turns up
and is re-united to the harrowed mother, who,
however, never gets back to her pretty frocks,
which is a pity, for Miss Hughes has good taste,
and her stage-gowns give many a hint to observant
women in front of the house. The rest of the
drama is mostly soldier and brass-band playing
“ Tommy Atkins ” on the slightest provocation,
and in 15 different keys at once.
An article in a recent S.M. Herald pulls
down the long-idealised “ Melican gal” from her
pedestal, and tells us poor benighted “ colonial ”
women we mustn’t admire her any more. She is
too selfish and exacting, and makes hubby work
too hard for the diamonds which she wears. It is
all the American man’s fault in domesticating his
angel. Too practical to worship the sex in the
abstract as Venus Victrix or Madonna, he piles
all his idealism on the women nearest him, with
the result, so croakers say, that the type is de-
teriorating through over-much indulgence. That
is because the American woman can do as she
pleases. There are many grumblers about who
honestly think that all the sex should be im-
prisoned in harems and face-veils still. Liberty
can never hurt anybody. “ A woman to-day may
do whatever her body and soul will let her.” But
those two limitations are so substantial that in
3000 A.D. her boundary-line will be very probably
what it is to-day and has been for centuries.
At the Cri. on Saturday evening—first night of
“Nancy and Co.” —there was a smart-looking
house. Stage frocks in the play are unremarkable.
Mrs. Brough, as Nancy Brasher, wears a noughts-
and-crosses pattern silk, pretty pink and black
bodice and flowery head-piece; Emma Temple
has an unbecoming fawn canvas skirt and a rather
elaborate long bodice, while Kitty Hardy fascin-
ates in girly muslins. G. Titheradge makes the
jealous husband Brasher put much expression into
a white top hat, and Percy Ward is a cute little
Willieboy with a street-sweeping coat.
Sydney holiday-makers are a joyously Bohemian
crowd ; they spend the day in harbor picnics and
tumble hilariously into theatres at night with their
hands full of droopy greenery and the marks of
jam-tarts still on their frocks. Even in the dressy
parts of the house they consider a blouse and skirt
and wind-blown hair and a hat hastily unpinned
in the cloak-room as full dress. Only here and
there do bare shoulders and arms dot the d.c. like
trussed Xmas turkeys in a poulterer’s window.
The Melb. Blind Asylum boom worked up by
Her Ex. of Vic. has panned out badly. When it
became known that she was in the movement, the
floodgates of correspondence were opened, and it
rained letters for 40 days and 40 nights. Now
Her Lx. has fled away to sea to escape from the
charitable monster she has created, and which was
fast qualifying her for the insane asylum. The
task of reading the letters is now deputed to the
aides or the boy in buttons, and the loyal sub-
scriber who sends along his or her guinea in hopes
of receiving a vice-regal signature at the bottom
of the receipt is falling in badly. It was the
Herculean task of writing thousands of begging
k-tters for St. Mary’s building fund which helped
to kill Archbishop Vaughan. A former Governor’s
wife was lazier or wiser about her pet charity
She had an autograph letter lithographed on Govt
House stamped notepaper, and thousands of aspir-
mg families used to leave the epistle lying* care-
lessly about their drawing-rooms to delude visitors
into the belief that they were in direct and per-
sonal communication with “Yours sincerely
Hersee Hopetoun.” J ’
Harrie IreJand and Yda Hamilton, as the two
girls in Lady Blarney,” at the Lyceum, present
an interesting contrast. Harrie is tall and fair
and her dresses cling about her in a limp, graceful
way suggestive of coolness, while at the other
heroines entrance the audience rubbed its eves
and thought Mrs. B. P. had come back again.
Y da, the pretty snake-charmer, has adopted her ex-
mstructress as a dress-model, and arrays herself in
gowns built on Potteresque lines and standing out
m stiff folds as if she were enclosed in a hen-
are,lar/e and fl °PPy and tilted at

Miss Beatrice Griffiths is a prodigy who has
grown up. She began her career as a musician at
seven, and still continues to love her art and ta

either languish and fade beautifully out of exist-

But, under Kowalski’s training, Miss G. has

The library of the late Mrs. Carl Fischer, auc-
tioned a few days ago, covered several large tables
in the sale-room, and was a fairly average collec-
tion, which brought no fancy prices. Two
or three really valuable books, which should not
have been sacrificed, were the “Breeches Bible,
“Old Ballads,” the Art Journal, Hogarth, and
Gilroy. Books of this sort are usually slaughtered
at auction. If a careful selection had been made
by an expert, and sent to London for sale, probably
half-a-dozen rare volumes would have realised
thrice as much as the whole collection brought
here.
Many Xmas-pudding mishaps are told me, but
the saddest yarn of all is about the man who
dropped a golden sov. into the unboiled mixture
as a pleasant surprise for the finder. After the
pudding had all been eaten and no coin was re-
vealed he observed that there was “something
funny about the stuff,” and asked who had got the
coin. His missis suddenly remembered having
exchanged samples with the next-door woman
over the fence. So sadness darkened that Xmas.
“Do men admire small-waisted women?” is a
reiterated silly-season puzzle. Why not reverse
it—“ Do small-waisted women admire men ? ” If
so, who and how many? It is like “Do bats eat
cats ? ” in “ Alice in Wonderland ” ; or “ What is
the cause of the lightning ? ” or “ Which would
you rather do, or go fishing? ” or “ Why is a bit
of string ? ” or any other hoary-headed query.
Tight-lacing does as much service as the pin which
saved lives by not being swallowed, because it
kills off girls silly enough to do it, and so works
for the survival of the fittest. Besides, nobody
does tight-lace .now, because bicycling has killed
the practice.
Remote suburbanites have been victimised lately
by a schemer who trades upon feminine bargain-
hunger. His stock-in-trade is a smart buggy con-
taining a convincingly show lady, some samples
of dry goods and a large quantity of shoddy.
When the house-mother eyes him suspiciously,
he offers alarming sacrifices (as per sample) from a
firm in town, obliged to clear out at any cost, and
invariably receives an order for silk stockings at
2s. 6d. a pair, or some other equally tempting
“ line.” Then a thought seems suddenly to strike
the trader, and he brings forth from his trap
some “ not quite such good quality, but still
remarkably cheap” tweed or serge. The victim
usually tumbles in and buys vast quantities of
useless stuff ; the shoddy-merchant drives off,
and, of course, never returns with his wonderful
bargains, and the shoddy serge is angrily scissored
by the woman of the house, and has about a fort-
night’s brief career as school-knickers for the boys.
An up-country town is just now the scene of a
heartless deception practised on its guileless and
unsuspecting Nicest, who hailed the advent of
another young man in the place with joy. He
was a stranger, and the first families took him in
because he is a handsome, clean-shaven, Johnnyish
youth, expert at tennis, flirtation, dancing, and
billiards. When he hints at his probably early
departure, lamentations arise on all sides. But
when he does finally go out into the infinite, and
Nicest discover that they have been honoring
the boots of the chief hotel of a distant town
more wailing will be heard in that district.
It is a tiring thing to have to live up to a label,
but most women have to do so in this weary
world, or get counted out in the great game of
life. In every large family of girls each one “does
something now-a-days, and is branded accord-
ingfly- One is 1 artistic ” —defies every botanical
law in her waratahs and flannel-flowers painted
on wood panels ; another is “ literary,” and sends
shrieks in three chapters, peppered with dashes
and asterisks, to an editor who is craving onlv for
solid facts; while “dear Maud” is “so philan-
thropic, and gets up, with the assistance of her
friends like-minded, entertainments for benighted
factory-girls. 6
A new advertising trick, successfully worked
lately, has been tried by a hard-up musician, who
offered lessons at ridiculously low terms. Several
people enrolled themselves, and beholding in their
instructor a carefully-tailored, handsome, cultured
man, did not hesitate to trust him with cash in
f± aric f- fl s o. some of them lent him more or
less valuable books of sonatas. After the first

by an almost entirely new cast. The new people
that Frank Thornton has brought out, though
taken singly they would not, perhaps, be able to
hold a candle to some old favorites, seem about as
refreshing as a rainstorm could be to this parched
and sun-struck city. ‘ Miss Brown ’ is obviously
a daughter of Charley’s aunt, but she is by no
means as amusing as her aged relative, ana has
not nearly so convincing a personality. Capt.
Courtenay’s make-up, however, is perhaps cleverer
than Lord Babberley’s was, and Miss Brown’s
blue serge with scarlet sash, in the second
act, might deceive anyone. Noney Seabrooke,
a dainty brunette with an insignificant vocal
organ, has an insinuating little manner, besides
which she looked radiantly pretty in the second
and third acts. Her gowns were all simple prints
and muslins with smart satin sashes tied (as all
up-to-date ceintures should be) at one side. Bessie
Rignold, as the girl from Demerara, made up her
face coffee-colored and her eyes deep purple, but
she wore artistic and appropriate gowns. Her
first frock of orange and brown was smart, and she
struck a splendid color note in the crimson damask
with gold sequin trimming of Act 3. Herbert
Terry, as the music-master, spoke like a- faded
Gecko, and looked like a shaven and bleached
Svengali. An incident in a story of Kipling’s is
cheekily ‘lifted’ bodily into the play, with no
kind of acknowledgement. Robert Buchanan,
who once spoke of ‘ little Kip ’ with abhorrence as
the ‘awful Mr. Kipling,’evidently considers the
Anglo-Indian good enough to steal from.
“ Miss Nellie Veitch, Melb.’s most popular and
successful elocutionist, leaves for a trip to Europe
early this month. The Austral Salon, of which
the silver-voiced Nellie is a prominent member,
farewells her somewhat elaborately next Thurs-
day. Miss Veitch may be said to have set the
fashion of “speaking pieces” in Vic.—a fashion
which has brought in its wake much suffering to a
comparatively innocent public, although it may
help a little to cure Australia junior of his native
habit of mumbling and his tired drawl. Lucky
Westralian specs have enabled Miss Veitch to
throw up her teaching for a time, and treat
herself to a Continental tour.
“AMelb. furrier lately received a large order
from the Spanish Government for opossum rugs
for the troops in Cuba. Fortunately for a
languishing fur-trade, a Cuban insect, with an
unspellable name, finds the soldiers’ blanket
so palatable that he consumes most of it
in one night, and, as he has not yet learned
to digest fur, and as Australian opossum is
the cheapest fur that an insolvent Government
can buy, poor old ’poss gets a boom on his own.
Black opossum is considered a superb fur by con-
noisseurs, and if there were not such quantities
of it available, it would take its place with the
sable and seal and other furry aristocrats. Fur-
yielding seals are becoming so rare that sealers
are bewildered at the numbers of alleged sealskin
jackets produced each season. Much - abused
bunny holds part of the key to this enigma.
“ Modern curates are, as a rule, meek, neglected
men, who buy their slippers and comforters ready-
made or go without. One of the Pres. Assembly
orators, the bachelor incumbent of a metropolitan
kirk, always commands attention, if only as one
of the few survivors of an almost obsolete type—
the clerical lady-killer. He once got into hot
water for complaining piteously at a suburban
conversazione of his perils at the hands of his un-
married lady-parishioners. At the Assembly, the
other night, he announced to a hard-headed hall-
full that he had a proposal of marriage to make
which the ladies would value all the more when he
told them it was his first proposition of the kind.
(Dissent). In the end, the conceited creature ex-
plained that he wished to coalesce the blanket-
guild with the medical-comfort league—or some
such twaddle.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.

ket on Saturday nights making his week’s pur-
chases. This distinguished person, who draws a
salary of four figures, carries on his arm a small
clothes-basket, and into this are popped the meat,

dor is a shrewd business man, and battles hard for
every commodity, being keenest of all in his valua-
tion of cabbages. To hear out that consul arguing

Gov. Lamington is earning popularity in
Brisbane (Q.) by painful decrees and slow. “ Old ”
Norman was a popular idol—-though compara-
tively a poor man. Women wept in numbers on
the occasion of his departure, while men beered
each other maudlinly. Atop of this, never had
there been in Brisbane such a hysterical hooray of
greeting as welcomed Lamington (all on account
of Norman), who was reputed to be enormously
wealthy. His refusal to donate to the Eight-
hours’ movement set the first recoil; when, on a
furthercomprehension of matters, H.E. did forward
a cheque, the Eight-hours people stiffly returned
it. But gradually, very gradually, hi's name is
being uttered without sneer or contempt, and the
present verdict is that “ though not so good as he
looks, he isn’t as bad as he first seemed to be.”
George Fisher, described as the ablest and
most useless politician inMaoriland, who has just
got back to Parliament as a Government supporter,
is a man of many parties. Nine years ago he was
Minister for Education in the Continuous Minis-
try, but no one could work with the Wellington
Ishmaelite, and he left after 18 months with a fine
impression of Atkinson’s hob-nailed boot on his
coat-tails. This is only metaphor, by the way.
Atkinson was a hard kicker-out, and a confirmed
nigger-driver, and no man who wouldn’t drive
easily ever stayed in his Cabinet. After that
Fisher was a Liberal. Then in ’9l he was a Labor-
member, but he speedily cooled off, possibly
because he wasn’t offered a portfolio in the Ballance
Government. By ’92 he was a modified Tory
again. In ’93 he stood as an independent
and was defeated, and everybody said his political
career was ended. And now in ’96 Fisher is a
Liberal M.H.R. once more. What he will be next
year no one knows, but his amazing vitality always
keeps him more or less on top. A kedge-anchor
wouldn’t sink George Fisher permanently.
In the Melbourne Review of July, 1876,
appeared an admirable article, entitled “ An Epi-
sode in Californian Banking.” A graphic account
was given of the career of the founder of the
Bank of California, William Chapman Ralston,
who seemed to have been a popular idol because
he disobeyed the rules of old-fashioned banking.
Ralston lent money to brokers to gamble in scrip,
to “ land-sharks ” to cut up estates and build ter-
races, to building societies for loan on long mort-
gages, and to the daring spirits of San Francisco
generally for speculative purposes. A ’Frisco
paper attacked Ralston and his bank, laid bare his
and its affairs, and thereby induced a run which
ended in a smash, and a re-construction in the
absenoe of Ralston, who suicided. The “ episode ”
bristled with trenchant criticisms of heterodox
banking methods, and sneered at the people of
’Frisco for remaining true to the errant Ralston’s
memory. Read in 1896, one would imagine the
great Balzac’s spook had sent the “ copy ” to the
editor of the Mklb. Review in 1876. The writer
was Henry Gyles Turner, then, as now, general
manager of the Commercial Bank of Australia !

Joseph M‘Mul-
len Dargaville, the
Maoriland legislator,
who died at sea re-
cently on the voyage
from ’Frisco to Auck-
land, was for many
years a prominent
official of the Union
Bank, but retired
from the institution
to develop the timber
and gum industries
in the North Auck-
land peninsula, where
he had large landed
interests and where
he founded the town
which bears his
name. Dargaville
was one of the finest
speakers in the Par-
liament of the early
Eighties a Parlia-
ment not by any
means weak in ora-
tory. He was a re-
markably handsome
man—portly, with a
golden beard and a
complexion of peach-
es and cream, but
his principles were
so unfixed that
neither Atkinson nor
Grey, the leaders of
the period, regarded
him as a serious
politician. It must
have been gall and
wormwood to him
when a man who
started life as a car-
penter in his em-
ploy, “ Ted ” Mit-
chelson, attained a
seat in the House
and subsequently be-
came Minister for
Works in Atkinson’s
Ministry.
Rev. Robert
Knopwood(on whose

worse parson, ” said some. At an exhibition of old

cluded one of old Knopwood on his grey pony.

You may readily divine
His mission’s one of mercy,
For he carries with him wine.
The picture, though a speaking likeness, is, from
an art point of view, on a par. with the poetry.
A terrible 14-year-old Sydney infant dedi-
cates “Rhymes by .Ruth ” “to the loving memory
of my grandfather, Alfred Stephen.” Some
verses addressed to the departed hanging Judge :
11 L ,e " as b° rn *'^ le sunshine shone more golden,
The flowers bloomed brighter at his happj’ birth,
'™ san g clearer in the trees and meadows,
The grass grew much more green upon the earth.
But now he’s gone ! a great and gloomy shadow
Seems on us, and it will not wear away j
Let us break through it, look not back but forward
Kemember, we shall see him some glad day.
One more good man is taken up to heaven,
One more bright angel in that happy band,
Care, sorrow, sickness, trouble—alfare over,
And we shall meet him in the Better Land.
The Bulletin is now doing its best to fit in the
grun face of the. remorseless judicial slayer of
poor Mary Brownlow with the conventional idea
of an angel in a nightgown and wings.
One of the Chaffey Bros., when he first
came to convert Victoria into another Garden of
Bden, happened to be proceeding to Echuca in a
first - class railway - carriage upon a blazing
summer day. Whilst the train was passing through
one of the dry and treeless plains, Chaffey, looking
out of the window, remarked upon the lean and
haggard condition of the stock that nibbled the
post-and-rail fences for sustenance. Looking
towards the opposite window, he sprang up excited-
ly. My God !” he exclaimed, “ this is the
slowest country on God’s fair earth. There you
have millions of gallons of water and not the
gumption to run some of it into your dried-up
ground. You want Yankee enterprise here, my
friend—Yankee push, Yankee brains.” Some of
the farmers sharing the compartment slowly took
in the situation and smiled aloud. Chaffey had
been admiring a mirage ! The Bulletin regards
this narrative with suspicion, all the same.


Anothbb sensational turn Las been given
to the subject of the pursuit of Butler or
Ashe by receipt of the intelligence
that the Swaninlda was signalled, and
her Captain communicated with by
pne of the Union Steamship Company’s
vessels trading between New Zealand and
the South Sea Islands. ’
Captain M’Beth also
sent a note to the captain of the Swau-
hilda, warning him that the New South
Wales authorities believed that Butler
had shipped on his vessel.
To sry that the police in general, and
particularly the detective police who have
been mots or lscs concerned with the un-
ravelling of the Mountain murders and the
pursuit of Butler, are disgusted at the
latest phase of the hunt, is but to put it
mildly. The"';
danger is not, so much that Butler might j
make away with himself if lie knows he ia '
wanted;(l don’t think ho will do bo) as ’l-
that he will be put upon ms guard and I
given time to throw overboard the j
jewellery and other property belonging to
his victims, which will be most damning
evidence against him, ans which he is no
doubt carrying in tho bag of whioh he ;
was so careful at Newcastle. '

POLITICAL
POINTS
Of the 59 Acts of Tas. Parliament passed
during the session just closed, no less than eight
are syndicate measures. The future Tas. peerage
will probably have gridirons for coats-of-arms.
The Country, S.A. National Ass organ,
which was recently described in the Assembly as
“a manure-wrapper,” did not long survive the
name. It announced last week that its publica-
tion will cease with the present year.
Q. delegates to the Federal Council, who
would not have delegates to Reid’s Federation
Convention elected by the people, propose to
move, at the next meeting of the Federal Council,
that its delegates shall in future be so elected !
Already the small, far-off voice of Premier
Forrest is heard from W.A. suggesting that
perhaps it would be more convenient to have the
Federal Convention about the end of 1897. Evi-
dently there are still a lot of possible troubles in
store for the movement.
Last days of Q. Parliamentary session were
worked on the “ caw me an’ I’ll caw thee ” prin-
ciple. “You vote for the Brisbane Municipal
Loan Bill, and I’ll vote for the Electric Power
Bill.” Or, “You vote for (or absent yourself from)
the Companies Bill, and I’ll vote for the Factories
Bill.”
Coincidence. At Vic. general election,
1892 Carter, the retiring member, beat Styles for
Will’iamstown by 330 ; in ’94 Styles beat Carter by
exactly the same number. Reason : In ’92 Carter
was the Labor candidate, although they were both
in favor of one man one vote. In ’94 Carter stood
as a Revenue Tariffist and a supporter of Patterson.
Styles was the Labor candidate and, of course,
High Tariff.
Duncan Gillies, in the usual course of
things, is reckoned a fit and proper person to suc-
ceed to the Vic. Speakership. Duncan was a
calamitous Premier, at present he is a deplorable
Agent-General. Therefore, as a reward for having
served his country very badly in two capacities,
he ought to be supplied with a comfortable arm-
chair and a soothing salary for the remaining term
of his natural life,
Westralia has retained, as
regards some part of the machi-
nery of the law, the forms that
were in vogue in the “ dark ages
of Hingland. For example, it
costs to issue a.summons in the
local court —similar to the county
courts of the other provinces—
two pounds, this extortionate
charge being made up of fees to
magistrate, clerk and bailiff. In
Fielding’s days the magistrate
was paid from the fines he in-
flicted upon the unfortunates
who came before him, and the
author of “Tom .Jones,” who
was stipendiary magistrate in
London, characterised the in-
come of .£3OO a year he received
from this source as the “ dirti-
est money on earth.” Again, in
Forrestralia, wheu costs are
given against a magistrate or a
police constable in his official
position, the Government does
not “ stump up,” but makes the
Jay Pay or the policeman per-
sonally “pay the piper.”
Why John Chinaman wins :
“The Chinaman can write all
day, he can work all day, he can
stand for a whole day in one
position, weaving, hammering
gold, or cutting ivory, without
being once attacked by nervous-
ness. This peculiarity makes it-
self apparent in early youth. The
Chinaman can bear any kind of
bodily exercise. Sport and play
are to him unnecessary labor.
He can sleep anywhere and in
any position —amid thundering
machines, deafening noises, the
ory of children, or the wrangle
of grown people, on the ground,
in bed, or on a chair. ’ ’ — Deutsche
Meoizinal-Zeitung.
To replace the obnoxious
Income-tax in Tasmania a Par-
liamentary candidate proposes an
“ Ability ’’-tax on persons according to the rent
they pav for their houses. It is held that rent
paid is a pretty safe guide as to income, and a
graduated tax on the rent basis would obviate the
present necessity for declaring sources of income.
As the man with 14 children and other relations
to keep him poor needs the biggest house he
generally pays the highest rent. Also, the rich
man with a house of his own doesn’t pay rent.
Yic. Public Service Board has issued a
long catechism to every State employe. Some
sample questions :
1. (a) Are you a correspondent for any newspaper or
periodical, or (6) do you write articles or paragraphs or
(c) communicate news to the “ Press ” verbally or other-
s' Do you receive remuneration for same of any kind
whatever, either by salary, fee, honorarium, or other-
wise ?
At a Wellington (M.L.) polling-booth, a
parson met Premier Dick Seddon, and the two
“ passed the time o’day.” (The ennobbled Dob
Stout, who, despite his treble-X surname, is a tee-
totaller, and who is also an agnostic, was an Oppo-
sition candidate.) “I’m goingto vote Opposition,
said the parson. “ Just like you, replied Dick,
“preach Christianity on Sunday, and vote tor
atheists on Friday.”
Sidelight on the aims of reigning Q. poli-
ticians. to be considered from a federal view-point.
By 29 to 13, on last day of sitting, Q. Assembly
affirmed the desirableness of reviving free and
assisted immigration, while it shelved Labor-
member Browne’s motion re the restriction ot
colored alien labor, and Labor-member (wharf -
laborer) Turley’s motion for the insertion of a
minimum-wage clause in contracts.
Y. : A simple solution of the colored-alien
difficulty. In England every employer of a male
servant pays a tax of 15s. per annum per head.
He becomes liable, if the menial is employed
but for a single day. Apply this system here to
the employer of aliens, and the tribe will soon
disappear. The cheap races are formidable only
because they are cheap. Make their employment
costly, and their virtues in the boss’s view will
vanish.
National Ass Abbott, refused publication
in his favorite Sydney daily, has turned his well-
worn cyclostyle on Tasmania. His particular
trouble at present is to warn the smaller provinces
that unless they insist on equal voting rights in
the Federal senate they will be gobbled up by the
bigger states. He advocates one state one vote
for the senate, and, ye gods ! One Man One Vote
for the Assembly. Abbott advocating One Man
One Vote !
It is now proposed that the Federal Con-
vention shall meet in April. When it has drafted
a constitution it will adjourn for not less than bO
or more than 120 days to allow the various Parlia-
ments to discuss the scheme. They will suggest
amendments —five different sets of amendments
and, when the Convention meets again, it will try
to strike an average among all the suggestions and
please everybody as far as possible. When the
amended constitution is finished it will be sub-
mitted to a popular vote in each of the five pro*
vinces for acceptance or rejection. And when it
has steered through all these difficulties, and the
British Parliament has assented to the new consti-
tution, then things will begin to be really started.
WALLACE BROWNLOW, on his favorite trotter
(Menzies, W.A.).
From photo, by Albert Russell.
In N.S.W. a civil servant who has put in
fifteen years’ service can claim a pension if re-
trenched ; should he be fired out before his fifteen
years expire he only gets “ compensation,” which
is a much smaller matter. ~ The other day half-a-
dozen men, or thereabouts, got a few weeks’ notice
to quit, and one man was thrown out instanter.
He was so near the end of his fifteen years that if
he had got the same notice as the rest he would
have been over the line, and have struck the
Superannuation Fund for his pension. Which was
seemingly the reason why he was so suddenly and
furiously biffed—at least, that is his view of the
case.
When the Mildura Bill—by which the Vic.
Government proposes to advance ,£30,000 to
Chaffey’s settlers so as to put the muddled irriga-
tion works in order, and thus give the settlers
the efficient water-supply which they paid the
Chaffey co. for and didn’t get—was before Parlia-
ment, its chief opponent was Levien, M.L.A.
Levien, who was a director of the Chaffey co. and
was largely responsible for the awful failure, com-
plained that the measure was “ unfair ” and “im-
practicable.” The spectacle of the man who drew
many thousands in fees and commissions out of
Mildura, and left it a wreck, severely admonishing
the people who were putting money in to repair
his blunders, was a fine piece of assurance.
Ancient Longmore denounced the “ con-
ciliatory policy” of Vic. Government re the
Council’s scornful treatment of its C°mpani •
Bill as the “ greatest backdown on record. Bong
more must prepare for even more awful shocks
The astonishing circumstance in history o
Victorian legislation up to date has been the
Council’s ignorance of its almighty power.
THE GLENBROOK MYSTERY.
Premier Reid dreams he sate an advertisement.
In Gisborne (M.L.) recently three “ pro-
hibited persons,” not being allowed to buy drink
on the ordinary lines, burgled a house in search of
liquor, and one of them took a long swallow of
what he thought was stolen beer, only to find that
it was carbolic acid. At Napier, another pro-
hibited individual, not being able to ob ain
whisky, took to chlorodyne, and when chlorodyne
led to insanity he sawed his head nearly off with a
razor. Teetotalism has its death-roll as well as
alcohol.
Yic. Leg. Council, being wise in its genera-
tion, passed the State Land Bank measure, practi-
cally without alteration. The Council represents
the property-holding community. The object of
the Land Bank is to supply property-holders with
cheap loans on mortgage. Therefore, this was the
one democratic measure on the Government’s list
the rejection of which would probably have made
the Council’s constituents rise up and tear it in 96
separate pieces, and the 48 Rich Landlords recog-
nised the fact and knocked under.
The “ revelations ” as to the condition of
Vic. Postal Department go to prove that P.M.G.
Duffy is the hopeless incapable of the Turner
Ministry. Somehow it is a recognised thing in
ail the Australias that the hopeless incapable of
the Ministry should be P.M.G. Which is one of
the things which make The Bulletin suggest
that the Postal Department should be run by a
permanent Commissioner, like the railways.
Continuous management by the fool of the Cabinet
doesn’t give any department a fair chance.
Canterbury (M.L.) Times, a strong sup-
porter of the Seddon Government, remarks : “We
should prefer to have a popular referendum-vote
before further borrowing is authorised.” It has
already been proved in Australasia that the
referendum is workable, and the question “to
borrow or not to borrow ” is a clear-cut issue
eminently suitable for decision by a popular vote.
And as nobody really knows what is the popular
opinion on the borrowing curse, the referendum,
which is the one way of putting a single issue
straight before the nation, would come in ad-
mirablv ; "“t here.
Melb. Age barracks hard and barracks
always for Alfred Deakin. The windy orator
with the stubborn black hair is evidently David
Syme’s nominee for the next Premiership vacancy,
and from this fact the decadence of D. Syme’s in-
tellect may be safely assumed. Alf. Deakin,
word-spinning lawyer and dreamy self-deceiver,
will be a bigger failure than even Shiels if his
newspaper champion should succeed in carrying
its point. And hasn’t Victoria already had enough
of the smug prattler who sat smiling at the right
hand of Gillies all through the stinkful boom-
time? A decent, honorable, “clever” fellow in
private life. Nobody doubts the assertion. But,
as a politician, Deakin deserves to be burned at
the stake, or taken up to Heaven without dying.
Expected Vic. candidates for the Federal
Convention include Premier Turner, Attorney-
General Isaacs, Chief Secretary Peacock, Trenwith,
and Dr. Quick —all, more or less, democrats ; three
howling Tories, Sargood, Wrixon, and Fitzgerald,
M’s.L.C.; Mclntyre, who isn’t distinctively any-
thing except a slow, old man, whose one idea,
when anything is suggested, is that the time is
inopportune ; and Deakin, the eloquent man of
long orations and allegedly democratic dreamer
whose mission in life is to find obstacles that no
one had previously noticed. N.S.W. candidates
heard of so far include Premier Reid, the hazy
wobbler ; Lyne, M'Millan, and Joseph Abbott,
all more or less Tory ; Barton, Carruthers, and
R. L. O Connor, three men with moderately demo-
cratic instincts ; Crick, Ewing, the colourless
Cullen, and O Sullivan.
Thus Bismarck (Bismarck’s “Table Talk ).
“ I look upon non-payment
WM, thU Sty-»“ Sr I would on no account
olrt ” Bismarck was right in his way. Universal
suffrage r/'/m«< payment of members is only a
sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.
Brewer Per-
kins, M.L.C. (Q.):
“Gas is good
enough, and we
need not bother
our heads about
electricity.” Hie.
Argument: Gas
means heat; heat
means thirst;
thirst means beer.
The Parlia-
mentary dead-
head scandal is
said to be almost
as indecent as
ever on the Vic.
railways. Not
only the immediato
friends and rela-
tions of members,
but the friends of
the friends like-
wise, travel all the
year round upon
certain white
cards, issued to
the poli t ical
“push ” at the be-
ginning and end
of each session.
These documents
were originally in-
tended to frank
th e wives and
daughters of coun-
try representatives
to and from town
when Parliament
opened and shut—
one journey out
and home again
twice in the twelve
mont h s. Some-
how the cards have
come to be used as
annual free passes
by anybody who
can. Jaeg, borrow,
or steal them, to
which end, seem-
ingly, they have,
in many cases,
been issued bare
of name, date, or specified journey.
Sargood, the Yic. boss M.L.C., wails
greatly about alleged infringements by the Assem-
bly of the rights of the House of 48 Rich Land-
lords. Yet he has the gall to move in the Council
a needless and useless resolution that the plural
property vote ought to Be retained in Assembly
elections. Also, while thus shoving his legislative
oar into the Assembly’s business, he complains
that what the country wants is peace, and that
the Government should avoid “ contentious ques-
tions.”
Clutha (M.L.) is in a curious position. In
1894 it voted for Prohibition and got it. At the
election of a few weeks ago it went back on the
Cold Tea gospel with disappointing results. Only
three issues could be voted on : whether licenses
should remain as they are, or be reducjed in num-
ber, or be altogether abolished. The drink party
voted that licenses should remain as they are, that
being the only way they could express their views.
And they carried their proposition with the result
that licenses do remain as they are—in other
words, they don’t remain at all. Unless it is
made possible to vote for an increase of licenses it
seems that when once the Cold Tea party arrives
no majority can shift it.
It now transpires that Premier Reid, after
the collapse of his Queensland mission, tele-
graphed to Braddon (of Tasmania) and Turner (of
Victoria) asking if they didn’t think Federation
should be dropped. Both returned an emphatic
“ no,” and pointed out that the Enabling Act
specially provided that the movement might go
on if three provinces adhered to it, and asked
why G. Reid agreed to the insertion of that
proviso if he wasn’t willing to proceed when five
provinces were in the movement. Then the half
or less than half-hearted N.S.W. Premier decided
to shove the matter feebly along a little further.
Apparently G. Reid will want a lot of watching if
the Federal question isn’t to drop accidentally
dead somewhere by the political wayside.
“ The Westralian Govt.,” writes a Bulle-
tin correspondent, “is a backstairs concern by
habit and instinct. Suppose you apply preposter-
ously for anything and the local officer rightly re-
fuses it, do you accept that? Not a bit. You
simply go to Perth, see the understrapper in
charge and give him a ‘cut.’ Then you see the
Minister and he—being perhaps worried with the
fair demands of the officer who refused your appli-
cation in the first instance—is delighted to snub
him instead of upholding his action and — grants
your application. It is pretty nearly all ‘ cuts ’
from start to finish. The clerk gets a ‘ cut,’ the
registrar a ‘ cut,’ the surveyor a ‘ cut ’ to put your
lot through and recommend it, and you, if you are
cunning enough and have got money enough, get
anything you want.

N. : “ The finances of St. Paul’s Anglican
Cathedral, Melb., are so shy that all the paid bell-
ringers have been sacked. Whereat rejoicing out
of doors.”
“ One of the most amusing election inci-
dents on record,” writes “ Maxillus ” to The Bul-
letin, “occurred at a political meeting in Wel-
lington, M.L., some four years ago at the time of
a hotly-contested bye-election. Reeves was speak-
ing one night at the Opera House when a conser-
vative wit threw a cabbage on the stage. Some
college boys—with as much appreciation of horse-
play and as little originality as the majority of
college boys—determined to improve on the joke.
Accordingly, on the night of a similar meeting a
few days later, they repaired to the family circle
with an artistic bundle of turnips and carrots.
All might have gone well had they not, in antici-
pation of the joke to come, handed round the
bouquet among themselves for inspection. The
family-circle at election times was the chosen
resort of the wharf-lumpers. Some of them spied
the floral tribute, and the youths were politely in-
formed that if they threw it over they would
follow it. The young humorists placed it under
the seat, making desperate efforts not to appear
uncomfortable. The news was soon passed round
the circle,-and at every interval in the speech-
making pressing appeals were made to ‘ throw
them blanky greens over ! ’ These invitations
were not responded to. At the end of the meeting
the youths rose to slink away. No such luck,
however. They were immediately stopped, and
told to ‘blanky well sit down.’ They did so,
meekly. ‘Now, hawk out them vegetables.’
It was dfibe. ‘ Now, set to work and d d well
eat them.” Sorrowfully the leader distributed
them among his comrades ; sickly smiling, they
fell to ‘ with what appetite they might.’ ’Twas a
solemn meal. When nothing was left but a few
green stalks, they were suffered to steal away,
amid a storm of hisses, catcalls and ironical
cheers.”
Dear Bullrtin,—The dividing-line diffi-

Give us this day our daily bread. A Fitz-
roy (Melb.) baker was lately charged with having
his premises in an uncleanly state. Hits of evi-
dence: Dough-trough dirty, not cleaned for
months ; on shelf above trough a bundle of dirty
rags; flour-shoot resting on floor; at bakehouse
door a puddle of liquid refuse and slops from three
houses at rear ; floor covered with dirt and manure
brought in by baker on his boots ; over bakery a
loft containing stocks of horse-feed, firewood, and
flour, also two pigeons, which roosted on the bags
of flour and deposited various things thereon ; loft
also used as a bedroom and store for old tins ; loft
stairs caked with same tilth as floors ; heaps of
dirt in middle of both loft and bakehouse; no
manure-pit, and open sewer in yard. This baker
had three shops where he sold meat-pies, tarts,
and other cookies fabricated in this filthy Tophet.
Two local .Taypees verdicted that a small fine of
<£l, with £2 2s. costs, met the case.
L. J. Nugent, of the Hermitage, Barron
River (Q.), a capable naturalist, tells the Queens-
lander a good yarn about his happening upon a
number of intoxicated beetles. “Two of the six
were on their backs, apparently dead; another
pair were, by all appearances, wrestling—they
were standing on their hind legs, and had each
other tightly clasped. . . The other two . .
were fluttering and toppling, but, once they fell
on their backs all power seemed lost to them.”
Nugent watched, and found others getting drunk
on the sap of a tree —“ a thick liquid matter
fizzling out of a blister or wound from a knock the
tree may have got.” The sap was like yeast, and
contained a deal of alcohol. Nugent captured the
beetles, which recovered next day, and not one of
them seemed to “ have a head ”on it. What says
the Cold Tea Brigade to this story ?
Dear Bulletin, —In Hyde Park, Sydney,
t’other day, saw threeold-fashioned slum youngsters
working off a joke,on the poor blind wretch grind-
ing an organ at the end of the path. Walking
by they would smartly tap with a pebble the little
open-topped tin box, placed to receive the browns
of the charitable. The old man’s hand would fly out,
accompanied with a muttered “ Lawd bless you!”
to scoop in the copper which was never there.
This was continued about half-a-dozen times, till a
benevolent-looking old lady hove in sight. She
waddled quietly up to the musician, dropped a opin
into the box, and “ Damn you, you young wretch!
—— !” said the blind man. The old
lady fainted.—J.F.D. P.S.—The old lady didn’t
faint, but I put that in to round the yarn off, as it
were.—J.F.D.
Actuary Alsop, of Melbourne Savings
Bank, has his own particularly painful manner of
calling attention to “Thrift.” Every Xmas he
pelts the prodigal and the pauper alike with
maxims, or, rather, he gets the newspapers to hurl
these unnecessary reminders at the Thriftless
whilst he sits in his office waiting for the result.
Mr. Alsop may be doing good, but The Bulletin
has its doubts. His maxims are dangerous when
not irritatingly puerile. “No matter what comes
in, if more goes out, you will always be poor,” is
hardly the text to turn a hardened sinner to re-
pentance, nor does it make a deep impression upon
the struggling householder who saves five shillings
per annum with splendid heroism, and remains
always poor notwithstanding. As for Mr.
Alsop’s statement that “a savings bank-account
has made many a man happy,” it might be more
forcibly applied to Beer. Swallowed in modera-
tion Beer has been, and still is, a much more cer-
tain producer of bliss than the price of an
occasional pint invested at two per cent. Yet
Thirst and Thrift are eternal foes.
Debt Collector: “ It’s no use talking.
There’s his hat in the hall.” Slavey: “WeS,

The Girl who Says "No Trust."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Dame Nature with her fickle ways
Makes mortals mostly weak :
E’en brainless rogues can govern “jayi ”
By force of vulgar cheek.
How oft we love the thing we hate,
And can’t discover why ;
We seek the cause in mood sedate—
The answer is a sigh.
I ofttimes ponder o’er the “ tart ”
Who greets me with a leer,
And wonder why within my heart
I hold her rather dear;
Tis not because she has more charm*
Than other girls I know:
It is, perhaps, because at times
Her little word is “ No.”
God Bacchus mocks the fools devout
Who worship at his shrine :
The proverb tells that Wit is out
When one is full is Wine ;
And yet if cronies two or more
Induce me to a “ bust,”
I still retain my liking for
The girl who says “No Trust! ”
The thirst that I would madly slake
She bids me bear away :
“Dry up!” she says, “for Tottie’s sake,”
And meekly I obey.
My throat is parch’d, my soul I’d sell
To feed the liquor-lust,
But home I stagger ’neath the spell
Of her who cries “ No Trust ! ”
Next morning with a frown severe
I seek that pub. in town,
And Tottie leers the killing leer
Which brings my anger down.
I growl as I have growled before,
Her sweet reply is “ Stuff !
When customers can’t pay for more
They’ve always had enough.”

PINK PILLS SAVED MY
THE EMPHATIC STATEMENT OP A YOONG LADY WHO
BESIDES IN THE HOME OF BEV. J. E. HDNTEB,
THE WELL-KNOWN EVANGELIST.
The Rev. J. E. Hunter, whose marvellous work
in connection with Rev. Mr. Crossley, in the
Evangelistic field, has given him a Continental
reputation, resides in the city of St. Thomas, Ont.
The particulars of the following remarkable cure
upon the person of a young lady living with the
family are therefore of more than passing interest.
To a reporter of the St. Thomas Journal she told
the following story
“I believe Dr. Williams’Pink Pills saved my
life, and I am quite willing that everyone should
know it,” said Miss Harris, when asked if she
would make public her story. Continuing, she
said, “When I was 12 or 13 years of age I was
taken sick. The doctors said my blood was all
turned to water. For five years I suffered terribly,
and was so weak that I could barely keep alive.
If I tried to stand for a short time, or if I got the
least bit warm, I would fall over in a faint. My
eyes were white and glassy, and I was so thin and
pallid that everyone beiieved I was dying of
consumption. During the five years I was ill I
was attended by five physicians in St. Thomas,
two in Detroit, one in London, and one in
Aylmer, and none of them could do anything for
me. I was so far gone that they had no hope of
my recovery. Towards the last my feet and limbs
swelled, so they had to be bandaged to keep them
from bursting. They were bandaged for three
months, and my whole body was swollen and
bloated, and the doctors said there was not a
pint of blood in my body, and they held out
no hopes whatever. I saw in the Journal
about a man in Hamilton being cured by
taking Pink Pills. I thought if they could cure
him they would help me, and I decided to try
them. Before I had finished three boxes I felt
relieved; the swelling went down and the
bandages were removed. I continued taking Pink
Pills until I had taken seven boxes, then irregu-
larly I took three more, one of which Mr. Hunter
brought back from Brockville. I am perfectly
cured. I have not been ill a single day since I
finished the seventh box of pills. I came to Mrs.
Hunter’s a year ago, and she will tell you I have
never been ill a day since coming here, and I
always feel strong, and able to do the work. I
can and do strongly recommend Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills,’ said Miss Harris in conclusion. Mrs.
J. E. Hunter, wife of the Evangelist, told the
reporter that Miss Harris was a good, reliable,
and truthful girl, and that perfect reliance could
be placed on her statements. “She looks like a
different girl from what she was when she came
here a year ago,” said Mrs. Hunter.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are a certain cure for
rheumatism, sciatica, lumbago, loss of physical
strength, weakness, indigestion, and sick headache,
and are obtainable from all chemists and dealers,
or from Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney, who
will forward six boxes for 14s. 9d. (or one box for
2s. 9d.) post free. They restore pale and sallow
complexions to the glow of health, and are a
specific for all the troubles peculiar to the female
sex, while in the case of men they effect a radical
cure in all cases arising from mental worry, over-
work, or excesses of whatever nature.

“Papa’s Hair.”
A gentleman has sent us the following :—“ A few
weeks ago I bought a bottle of your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’
and it has acted with the most satisfactory results.
Previous to doing so, my hair had a mousey color
streaked with grey. The dear children would try
to count papa’s grey hairs, but, because of the
number, could not succeed. Being only 44 years
of age, I determined to improve my hair, and tried
your ‘Papa’s Hair,’ and am pleased to write that,
though at first there seemed little difference, gradu-
ally the hair regained its original color (there was
no dyeing whatever) and it is now strong and glossy.
I asked my little daughter this morning to count
my grey hairs, but when looking for them she cried
out— 1 Why, papa, there are no white hairs; mamma
must have pulled them all out.’ ”
JSf" This Preparation is not a Dye, but acts gradu-
ally on the Roots of the Hair, and restores Grey
Hair to its natural color and lustre.
No preparation will make hair grow better than
“ Pap a ’.s II air. ”
It effectually prevents the formation of Dandriff,
as it is called, the presence of which always denotes
diseased action in the cuticle of the scalp, causing
premature baldness, or a falling off of the hair.
DIRECTIONS.—WeII shake the bottle, and with
a small piece of sponge rub into the roots of the
hair, night and morning, till the hair is restored to
its natural color ; afterwards apply twice a week.

Brisbane excise officers, the other day,
surprised some alleged “colonial ale” that con-
tained nearly three-eighths of an ounce of sul-
phuric acid (oil of vitriol) and a lot of nicotine
per gallon. The average Queenslander likes his
soft stuff” that way ; nothing but boiling nitric
acid with corrosive sublimate and chloride of lime
will do to flavor up his “ hard tack.”

Premier Kingston's Law Reform pro-
posals are not the only reason for his unpopu-
larity with his legal brethren. Recently he was
the means of a big land compensation case being
settled by Judge Bundey, acting as arbitrator,
without the intervention of lawyers on either side.
The Judge made a personal inspection and deli-
vered judgment in court, the whole proceedings
occupying just half a day. Legal expenses next to
nothing !
“ I heard a fragment of a conversation in
a railway train, lately,” writes a Bulletin cor-
respondent, “describing a piece of seashore on
which for hundreds of yards dead penguins were
piled up as high as Oft. Here and there among
them were gigantic crows, so gorged that they
were unable to fly. The penguins had been swept
there by a storm from a line of rocks a little dis-
tance out, somewhere in the neighborhood of Aus-
tralia. Where, please ? ”
The gentleman in “the horrors” who
sees “ snakes ” and thinks them realities is really
wiser than the average doctor, who believes the
“snakes” to be hallucinations. A New York
ophthalmic surgeon has just pointed out that
in front of the actual seeinti parts of the eye
lies a retinal layer carrying the blood-vessels.
In a state of “D.T’s’’ the tortuous blood-
vessels are dilated, filled with dark blood,
and rapidly pulsating. On the sensitive layer
these produce the effect of lots of waggly, squirm-
ing things, which waggly squirmers the befuddled
brain, partly from inexperience, partly from news-
paper allegation, promptly classifies, and not
without some justification, as “ snakes ” —the only
waggly, squirming things it knows.

The same old column of reading matter has appeared
ftn the Sydney Lyceum programmes for many months
past. And the Goatcher management hr.s apparently
taken it over from its predecessor, Williamson, for the
same six alleged jokes turned up on Saturday night as
usual.
Considering that the experienced Arthur Garner is
understood to have shouted rich wines and smoked big,
!at cigars all over two continents in quest of the new
Palace Co., and considering how very ordinary half
;he co. is, it would seem that variety talent is
i little scarce just now. Still, as the preachers say, “ all
things work together for good.” Garner is thrown out
now, and Goatcher has the co. Therefore, Garner is
probably very glad that he didn’t get a better one.
What’s bred in the bone, &c. Veteran actor-manager
George Coppin’s father was a medico by education, but
abandoned surgery to become an actor-manager. Of
George’s children, his son George and three of his
laughters have appeared on the boards, and the fourth is
secretary to Rignold. Son Fred, the sole non-pro. among
the veteran’s progeny, is gold-mining in N.E. Victoria.
Jakoff Hambourg, brother to pianist Mark, of the
furious hair and merciless fingers, is coming into notice as
i youthful phenomenon on the violin. If little Jakoff
resembles Mark Hambourg in face and figure it was
Nature’s duty to give him, some .musical talent to go
dong with the dreadful mane. They used to hang round
the piano plugger as though they could eat him. Musio
Oath charms to move the padded breast.
Now that Australia boasts of Melba, Crossley, and
Frances Saville, to say nothing of minor stars, one wonders
to find this pre-eminence of talent on the side of the
women, while the men are wholly unrepresented.
It would be interesting to hear Madame Marchesi, or Sant-
y, lecture upon the classical method of music-hall voice
roduction. There must be some virtue in the nasal style of
garbling practised by such hard-working professors as
Charles Godfrey and Chirgwin. A comic-opera singer
with a good voice, but an uneducated, has a short life at
the game, yet a Rickards goes on for ever. A certain class
of twang seems to preserve the voice against breakage,
let them knock it about as they may. It lends expression
alike to maudlin sentiment or rough humor, and has con-
siderable magnetic charm for the multitude when pro-
perly worked. Superior singing-masters sneer at the
twang’s barbarity, but they don’t attempt to explain
why a veteran twanger retains his good old top-note in
defiance of all accepted rules.
“Madge Kendal, after a scathing attack on Clement
Scott, of London D.T., has sprayed her hysterical bitter-
ness over the Referee for daring to comment on the
shamefully-neglected state of her brother, Tom Robert-
son’s, grave,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent. “ Here is the letter, and he who reads must
needs run afterwards :— 4 Central Station Hotel, Glasgow,
Nov. 11, 1896. Sir, —As you have been manly enough to
publish my letter !—and what an honor for your paper it
has been !—I will tell you this. ... I offered years ago to
attend to my brother’s grave, but the paper proving the
ownership of same cannot be found, and among so many
has been lost! and (as even you in your ignorance may
know) that unless one can prove the ownership of the
grave, to clean or to alter anything in connection with it
is impossible ! When you write my brother's name again
—do it on your knees ! with your hat off ! I never knew
your paper existed—till I saw it one day on my kitchen
table ! when I told my Housekeeper to burn it. She rang
for the Groom—who sent for the Stable Boy—who did so !
—Yours faithfully, Madoe Kendal.’ Madge is a ‘near’
woman, though, and with all her wealth, gives little
thought to her own sisters striving hard to make that w ay
in life so difficult for educated women in crowded Lon-
don. Perhaps it was the cemetery trustees prevented
her lending a helping' hand or even a protective wing to
her dead brother’s parentless daughter? A tragic queen
sunk in shoddy burlesque.”
Rickards has been wondering whether Melb. Royal
would suit him.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Whene’er I take a walk around,
How many pros. I see ;
An 1 tho’ I sometimes shout for them,
T ley never shout for me.
Miss Frederica Mitchell, the Vic. contralto (it is always
fictoria !), is winning her way into favor in London. Her
mother, a finished vocalist, who sang as an amateur, was
the daughter of a former British Resident in Persia,
where he married a native lady; hence the attractive
Orientalism of Miss Mitchell’s appearance.
The late Frank Cates’s boys are now- in the care of Mrs.
Thos. Kennedy and her husband, the secretary of the
Musical and Dramatic Association, who took them in on
the death of their aunt.
Apropos to variety-artist Priscilla Verne horsewhipping
a Perth man-about-town. The horsewhipping woman is
a coward in that she depends on male chivalry preventing
a hit back, but it doesn’t always work. A few years ago
a weird woman-suffrage gasometer sailed into a Castle-
maine newspaper office, armed with a buggy-whip, and,
after much incoherent oratory, proceeded to use it.
About one minute after there was a wild row like theatre
thunder, and a mass of humanity rolled downstairs into
the main street gutter. Presently editor Mac. was seen
sitting astride a wildly dishevelled female, picking large
hunks of mud out of his eyes and ears, while the office-
boy sat on said female’s head to keep her down. That
female doesn’t tackle country editors now.
Song-writer Tito Mattei often conceives a melody in the
street, and rushes into the nearest music-shop, or even
pub., plays it over, writes it down, and departs suddenly
as he came. His great song, “Hear the Wild Winds
Blow,” he composed in a Margate oyster-shop, in the in-
tervals of a big bivalve supper.
John F. Sheridan’s account of the origin of “ Fun on
the Bristol ” “ I was playing for Jarrett and Palmer in
New York a part in a piece that was not a success ; there
was in it a court-scene wherein a young girl was brought
before the magistrate and fined. I said to Jarrett, ‘ I
wish 1 had that gill’s part instead of this one.’ Jarrett
said, ‘ All right—you can please yourself.’ So next night
I took the girl’s part in addition to my own, arranging
with the man who played the Magistrate to cross-examine
me and take me up sharp. I dressed the part of an old
Irish woman—witty, and a habitual drunkard. This
took, and people dropped in to see the court-scene alone.
George Fawcett Rowe, in New' York, saw me, and Jarrett
suggested his writing me a piece on the lines of the Irish
woman. He wrote ‘ Fun on the Bristol.’ I went out
with it. It was a failure from the start, as it was very
broad—the Count stayed too long in the Widow’s Cabin
and made saucy remarks when he returned to the stage.
Jarrett allowed me to re-write it, leaving out the over-
vulgarity which I saw- was its weak point, and from the
first night ‘ Fun on the Bristol ’ took as played and re-
written by me. In England Arthur Garner saw me, and
engaged me for a six months’ Australian tour. I made
£4OOO, the firm just cleared themselves.”
From a private letter : “ Sardou is now 60 years old.
wrinkled, and half-bald, but in his elastic step and
brilliant eye as youthful as a boy. He is said to have
earned nearly a quarter-million from his plays.”
A New York publication gives some interesting con-
fessions of Thomas Minnock, a star hypnotic subject.
Minnock says the whole business is a swindle, and alleges
that before reaching the top rung he made a complete
physical pain conquest. One of Kennedy’s wretched‘sub-
jects made a similar “ confession ” in Melb. last year.
These fellows have their share of human vanity, of
course, and it pleases them to try and persuade them-
selves that they are free agents in the mesmerist’s show.
All the same, they are under the showman’s influence.
They rehearse their hideous tomfoolery, and know what
they are about to do when they go upon the platform,
but when the fat man puts them through their perform-
ances they are the irresponsible puppets of his will. Pro-
fessional hypnotists have tried to work one another’s pro-
fessional subjects, and failed generally. The subject
might be willing enough, but the new influence was too
weak.
It is a remarkable thing, as theatrical customs go,
that nearly every member of the Brough co. plays under
his or her own name. Mr. and Mrs. 8., Miss Hardy,
Titheradge pfere et fille, Carey, &c., none of them wear
stage names. In most companies the exception is to find
a mummer who appears with his or her lawful name.
A journeying band of brilliants lately struck a country
town. The brightest gem immediately borrowed a pound
from a resident, and hired a cottage at 7s. a week, paying
the first week’s rent in advance. Agent, in due time,
calls for the next week’s rent. Doth he get it? He doth
not. The interview ends by the agent himself lending
the B.G. 6s. ! A day or two later the landlord himself
calls for the rent. Doth he get it ? He doth not. B.G. :
“Oh, I refer you to your agent; I’ve settled with him.’
Position : Won’t shift for a month, anyhow ; nothing to
levy on, anyhow; won’t shift then if don’t choose ; eject-
ment process slow and costly and nothing to be gained
by it 1
Yet another Gaiety co., for Australia, talked of.
“ Doubtless some of our popular actors will presently
give us a romance on the virtues and the redemption of
Judas.”— Rev. Dr. Horton.
“ There are only three kinds of Englishmen I like —the
Irish, the Scotch, and the Dead.”
When Macready produced “ Henry V.” for the last time
in London, John Forster was present at the rehearsals.
An illiterate actress named Mrs. Bunby, cast for Mrs.
Quickly, was much annoyed by Forster criticising her
pronunciation and saying to Macready, “ Put her through
it again, Mac. ; put her through it again.” But she was
comforted by a young actor saying, “ Never mind what
the gentleman says, he is only the author.” By the way,
who did the condensing of the “Henry V.” which Rignold
plays ?
Actor Wakefield, of Brough’s company, is a capabl
Chinese scholar.
It is suggested that George Rignold ought to try Fal-
staff.
An evening’s observation of a newly-reorganised co., in
which the “ young and fresh ” element is very dewy,
developes the idea that the inginue may always be
detected at a glance by the promptitude with which she
pulls her dress down every time she “ flops” into a chair.
The debutante is harried with pale apprehension that the
audience may catch sight of her ankles. Old stagers don’t
trouble to “hitch down.” Nellie Farren used to say she
liked to wear jewelled garters because —well, never mind.
A theatrical agent, just returned from the North,
relates how he once called at the office of a small Q. up-
country newspaper, and finding no one in left the Usual
“ press ticket,” endorsed “ Editor, with comps.” He goes
on to say that they took it literally at that office, and
that the “ed.” and his five “comps.” turned up that
night “on the nod.”
A travelling pro. : “ Holy South Australia ! One town
I was in lately (population, 600 souls) had no less than ten
denominational chapels and churches. I spent a Sunday
there ; I shiver when I think of my experience. Sunday
means, in inland towns, three heavy courses of Salvation
Army, the perpetual clanging of church bells, and half-
cold meals. At one hotel I sojourned in, the people were
so saintly that they covered the canary-cages with cloths
on the Sabbath, so that the birds shouldn’t sing. Fact 1
South Australia is a fine country to keep out of.”
The artful actor told the simple people of Oroagingolong
that he loved them and the place so well that he hoped
to live and die there. Next week he was telling the same
gag at Boulahmine, when a voice roared out, “Why, man,
you said the same thing at Oroagingolong last week.”
“ That’s quite true,” said the blushless actor; “but re-
member I hadn’t seen Bowlahmine then.”
Dear Bulletin, —I had been told it was the second best
Agricultural Show to be seen in Maoriland, and I found
myself wondering what the worst must be like. There
were engines going, and reapers and binders clawing at
space looking like huge crabs ; there were separators and
turnips and other things I’ve forgotten the name of, and
a female who fell off a box, where she had perched her-
self, into the mud. I was glad she splashed some of the
crowd, because she seemed a respectable old lady. I’d
have gone away, for my feet were wet and I didn’t know
anyone, and I didn’t know a merino from a Berkshire, and
the awful Australasian holiday cigar was in the air; but
I’ve read much Lawson and much “Banjo” and much
Bulletin generally, and I wanted to see a real “Jim ” and
a real “ Bill.” There was a chopping contest to come off.
Eventually it started, and I tried to be regardless of a
drip down my back from a taller man’s hat, in an en-
deavor to work up all my old Bill and Jim enthusiasm. I
was getting along nicely when a voice beside me re-
marked, “ Let me see the cows chop.” I did my best to
let the owner of the voice do as he wished. He was a
large man with an unpleasant breath—suggestive of a
buzzard’s. Presently, squeezing all the sarcasm possible
into the remark he ejaculated : “ Chop! . . . I’ll
chop any one of ’em 1 . . . I’ll chop any man in the
country. I’ll chop any man in the world ! ” After a
pause: “And me mate’ll chop me!” Just then some-
thing seemed to annoy him, and I couldn’t get up
till two others got off me, and as I was walking away
wringing the mud from my ear I could just make out his
voice remarking to the choppers : “ Why don’t yer chain
yer dogs to it! ” —X.
Ada Crossley, judging from latest samples of the jam
awarded to her, is within easy distance of earning a
steady £5OOO a year. At present, she must be making
quite half as much. Among sundry notices of her per-
formance at the Sheffield Musical Festival, where she
ranked as principal contralto, London D.T. said “ Miss
Crossley’s voice, if she had no other merit, would plead
for her with golden-mouthed eloquence,” whilst the local
papers were unanimous in praise of the Australian lady’s
artistic method. Birmingham Daily Gazette calls her
“a superb artist, who, to a magnificent voice, adds the
much rarer gift of refined and correct artistic feeling,”
and the Glasgow Daily Mail talks about “the great con-
tralto, Miss Ada Crossley.” In another two years’ time
the Hinglish press everywhere will have accepted Crossley
as a power on the platform. Then she will command a
special fee for her name in addition to the prices now paid
her for singing, and Australia’s chance of hearing its
graceful daughter again before her hair turns gray will be
1 in 50 or thereabouts.
This has been a ’Murkan year in Australian theatrical
productions, and one memorable chiefly for its stage
twang. The “ Trilby” co., the Nat. Goodwin crowd, the
“ Chinatowners,” all from the land of monotone. And
now, in the last month of the year, Brough lets loose a
typical ’Murkan farce, “ Nancy and Co.”
A “ first violin ” tells a S.M. Herald contributor how
once at a private dance he was asked by special request
for a solo, “ und I play something from Chopin to make
the heart break, und when it is over the company clap,
r.nd the lady of the house come forward und tank me
und say, 4 Tell Mr. Chopin how grateful I am to him for
the pleasure he has given us all’—she tink evidently dat
I keep Chopjn in my backyard to write dese little tings
for me 1 ”
Allan and Co. (Melb.), having obtained the Australian
copyright of “ Love’s Serenade,” are publishing that
tuneful souvenir of “The Milk White Flag” at 2s.
“Love’s Serenade” is a hitherto unobtainable ballad
which plump tenor Pacie warbled to Widow M‘Cann
from behind a curtain. The tenor’s kindness in
remaining hidden meanwhile, so as not to spoil the effect
will never be forgotten by The Bulletin.
Glen and Co. (Melb.) issue a Xmas Federal Music Book
and a “ Colonial Musical Cabinet.” The latter, decorated
outside with a picture of the expansive Libbey, contains
“Molly’s the Girl for Me” and a selection' of similar
taffy. In the much more desirable “ Federal ” there are
two new marches, some bright dance music, and at least
one classic song—“ When the Heart is Young.”
According to Charles Dilke, M.P., there
are 54,000 sailors in the British mercantile marine
of whom 34,000 are British. If a great war broke
out it would require fully 17,000 sailors, in addi-
tion to those now enrolled, to take the British
navy to sea, and this demand would sweep off half
the merchant sailors in one act. It would take
11,000 more to man the vessels now in course of
construction, which would absorb most of the other
half, and practically abolish British shipping and

He was an oldish man, and he got up beside me
in the empty ’bus. Presently he sidled up and
said, “ Would you mind feeling my pulse, sir, and
telling me whether it goes too fast ? ”
I felt it. “It seems thin and wiry to me, but I
don’t think it is going too fast.”
“ Thank you, sir.”
In a minute or two he began once more : You
know, sir, I feel terribly out of sorts. I have been
a great drunkard, and am just getting over it. I
feel it, I can tell you.”
“ I suppose you do.”
“Do you believe in prayer, sir? ”
I am not greatly addicted to prayer, but I re-
plied “Yes.” It seemed more respectable.
“ Would you mind praying for me when you
say your prayers ? ”
“ Certainly, if you wish it.”
Just then we passed the Brown Jug Hotel.

MAXILLUS.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The cricket-match N.S.W. v. S.A., in Adelaide,
was perhaps the most extraordinary yet. played. When
NSW made 162 on a perfect wicket Capt. Garrett,
although admitting magnificent bowling was very
distrusted. No one save S.A. less than 300, but tne Jast
wicket fell for 187. Then N.S.W. lost her best men cheap,
but a junior saved a big defeat, and Garrett and Turnei
made victory certain. . >
Nine Australian men played, and only two of
them—Clem. Hill and Kelly— showed any batting form.
Lyons’7B for S.A., in the first innings, was a
grand display of sound forcing cricket. “ Carbine Jack
never played sounder cricket, and one hard hit, which
Coningham should have caught, would have been a safe
fiver in Sydney and Melb. Clem. Hill made 100 in the
two innings by the best batting of the match. Clem, is
the leading artist in Australia on the “ on ” side.
The three juniors in the match — Noble (N.S.W.),
and Evans and Bailey (S.A.)-were complete successes.
Noble’s innings was a fine sample of pretty and plucky
cricket. He went in to stop a rot, and he succeeded.
Bailey went in when three wickets were down for 34, and
stayed there until the century was posted and victory
looked likely for S.A. But S.A. has a tail.
M‘Kibbin, who upset the S.A. apple-cart, comes
back from England a much-improved bowler. Although
pig-fat, he bowled with great consistency. A word for
Garrett, the “stormy petrel’’ of S.A. cricketers. Last
year Garrett made a fine stand with Howell, and secured
victory for N.S.W., and this year he and Turner did the
same. The Sydney University captain, like others of the
old school, knoweth not the meaning of the word “funk.
A bad decision possibly lost the match for S.A.
Darling played a ball hard on to his pad, and without any
appeal being made the N.S.W. umpire called “out.”
Then Garrett again appealed, which was necessary on the
rules, and Darling had to retire. As neither bowler nor
batsmen appealed for the 1.b.w., or anything else, Gar-
rett’s action was, under the circumstances, rather unfor-
tunate, to put it mildly. “ Darling on Umpires ” would
be unprintable just now.
The nine Aus. Eleven men who played in Adelaide
last week have nearly all become stale from a surfeit of
cricket. Iredale and Gregory are obviously out of form,
Darling is only in fair nick, and Jones, although his
bowling seems improved, cannot at present keep up his
great pace as long as usual. The one man who seems
really fresh and lively is M'Kibbin. George Giffen is at
present much hampered by a knock on the right knee,
received in America, which nearly forced him to stand
out of the S.A.-N.S.W. contest.
* » * *
Coincidences : In the first innings of the match
between N.S.W. and S.A., M'Kibbin made 7 not out and
took 7 wickets. In the second innings, he made 8 not out
and took 8 wickets.

Premier Keid is also president of the N.S.W.
Cricket Association. Years ago he accompanied a N.S.W.
team down to Melb., in the days of Charley Bannerman,
Ted Evans, Spofforth, and “Ned ” Sheridan (the “ Scud,”
as he was called). The result was a little while ago
described by veteran “Ned ” Sheridan (now a prosperous
tobacconist in Brisbane) in these words : “ Well, Georgie
was the comicalest figure I ever struck, with his legs
doubled up and toes turned in. His pants was skin-
tight, he had a double chin and a single eyeglass.
We got him to take a strike at the nets. Lord!
we laughed till the tears rolled down our cheeks.
We was all pokin’ it at him, and pitchin’ soft stuff, with a
break from the off to go between his legs. He always
lifted the bat after the ball was past, and fixed his eye-
glass after each ball. We thought him the biggest duffer
we ever saw—until the banquet, when he got up and
made a speech ! Holy Moses, didn’t he talk ! My boy,
you couldn’t bowl him. He nearly talked us silly ; one
minute we was laughing, next crying, and all the time
cheering. I tell you, we never looked on him as a mug
after that speech ; and always after that we used to pitch
’em up to him, at the nets, so that he couldn’t possibly
miss ’em, if he tried.”

Cricketer Ernest Jones’ first question on arriving
at Adelaide was about that engagement offered him by
S.A.C.A. when his capture by Sussex looked certain. “ I
virtually broke off the negotiation,” said Jonah, “when
they cabled me, because I want to stay in Adelaide.”
Anyway Jones says if they don’t make a definite proposal
he will play in Melb. or Sydney directly something valu-
able offers.

A clergyman at an anti-gambling meeting the
other night told a heart-rending tale of a young friend oi
his who had been ruined by “backing a horse in Tatter-
sail’s sweep.” Another said he was constantly annoyed
by the bookmakers on an adjacent racecourse “ voci-
ferously calling the odds.” At the racecourse in question
the bookmakers never call the odds vociferously or other-
wise. The seductive “Who’ll take the last two for six-
pence” is absolutely the only “odds” that are called.
Ditto at a church bazaar.

A Westralian correspondent writes : “ This is a
great province for sport of all kinds. I have been on many
racecourses around Sydney and Melbourne, and have
witnessed many awful things thereat, but it was not until
I came West that I saw daylight robbery practised by the
powers that be. At our meetings it is usual for one of
the stewards to act as banker for the others, and back one
‘ fancy ’on behalf of the syndicate. The stewards’ fancy
wins for certain if it finishes within half a length of the
horse in front. The judge attends to that."

Fleet Admiral’s owner made no mistake in
bringing the colt from Adelaide. In the December Stakes
at Randwick, Patriot was backed down to 6 to 4, and led
to the distance, where Fleet Admiral tackled and passed
him, winning by a length.

The A. J.C. authorities should really study their
Leger and Flat patrons. A wretched array of numerals,
most irregularly kept as regards scratchings, is all that is
vouchsafed them re starters, &c. ’Tis imperative that a
board, on which is displayed not only starters’ numbers
but jockey’s names, be erected for the benefit of the two-

The public keep racing alive, and vet they are
ever being put in the hole. The very latest and most
flagrant take-down was with Cartridge, whose sportin'*- Cl
owner preferred trying to win the Summer Cup to giving
the public a run for Villiers Stakes, a race almost a cer
tainty for Muskets son. Of course, Cartridge failed in
Summer Cup, to the huge delight of the public, who had
planked their money on for the Villiers Stakes. This llth
hour scratching is reprehensible, and the sooner a rule is
passed by A.J.C. to the effect that, “if a horse be not
scratched before 12 o’clock the day before the date for
running, that horse be considered a starter, unless a valid
excuse for his not running be submitted to the stewards ”
the better it will be for racing generally.

The secretary of a country racing-club badly
wanted to eject an objectionable person from the “pad-

man was legally there, and if violence were used an action
for assault might result. The secretary, however, was a
man of resource. Going up to the bugbear, he asked for
his ticket, and, on its production, deliberately tore it up
and said “ Now, you get out of this paddock ! Sergeant! ”
, calling to the local trap) “ this man has no ticket ; see
that he leaves at once. If he doesn’t, put him out 1 ”
and put out he was.

the aforesaid dead bird lositui a particular race. The race
was lost as per contract, but all the stiffening money was
not paid ; hence the action. Mr. Commissioner Shaw ex-

suing upon an agreement to defraud, and gave judgment
for the defending conspirator.

An examination of the photos, of the mile
finish of the Martin-Parsons match casts considerable
light on the reason why the Australian so frequently' loses
a closely-fought sprint. The top of Martin’s head is the
only part of him observable —just a round patch of hair
with the muscles of his jaw projecting on each side—but
Parsons—the handsome Jack—though his wheel is still
a yard from the line, is sitting almost bolt upright with a
saintly' smile at the nearest camera. Parsons might win
a heap more races if he had been born more* ugly, or if
the camera men were warned off the track, or if he broke
his pretty nose in a big smash.

A truly impressi ve sight was Bilmartin’s theatre-
party' at Melb. last week, when the plugger invited his
pacing-teams and other prominent cyclists 40 strong to
the Melb. Opera House. Bill himself occupied a seat in
the centre of the theatre, and, with Parsons on his right
hand, formed a subject for a great historical picture. At
the inter.'al all hands adjourned to a neighboring squash-
shop, where Bill shouted ad lib. Coming into Bourke-
street, the “Rats’ push,” the local aggregation of bare-
footed urchins, mobbed the cyclist and clamored loudly
for a share of his ’winnings. Martin’s iron jaw relaxed,
an 1 he had evidently' come prepared, for he reached to
the pocket of his tail-coat, and scattered sundry handfuls
of coppers on the pavement. To the average Australian,
who has never had any nearer acquaintance with royalty
than an occasional glimpse of King Billy' or some equally
potent monarch, Bill Martin seemed distinctly suggestive
of Henry V. or any other mythical personage distribut-
ing largesse to the multitude.
One of the most pathetic sights of a recent big
cy'cling match down South was the way the prospective
ma-in-law of the defeated competitor burst into tears
when the other man came in. The object of his affection
was more philosophical, and contented herseif with sending
in condolatory messages to his dressing room about once
every minute and a-half. When a man is fairly knocked
out, and his naked body' is being pawed vigorously with
eucalyptus oil by horny-handed trainers, billets-doux
appear a trifle incongruous.

The Zeehan (Tas.) football ground during the
season is a sea of mud. The umpire is perfectly safe, as
after the first quarter he cannot be distinguished from the

out who is which.

Eggs and Bacon were horse-dealers. Eggs was
honest and had money without the experience; Bacon
was a rogue (unlike the average horse-dealer) and had a
lot of experience along with a few “quid.” They went
into partnership. Bacon went out on the quiet and
bought twenty head of horses cheap ; put them in a pad-
dock in charge of a pal. Then Bacon tells Eggs that he
knows where there are some good horses to he bought.
Both go out to inspect. The pal sells the horses (Bacon’s)
to Eggs and Bacon for a big price. Eggs pays for them ;
then Bacon has a row with him. Eggs takes the horses
himself, and is unable to sell them at a profit. Bacon
makes “millions” out of the “deal.”

Algernon was new to the droving, and

sing or whistle all the time to keep the cattle

got sleepy ; then he half-slid, half-tumbled off his

woke, with a confused sense of responsibility, and
ooked round for the cattle. Then he scratched
his head and went to rouse the boss. “Hey!
boss ! “ Yes,” said the drover sleepily. “ You
know that bullock with his tail half-mast ? ” The
diover nodded. “ Well, I can’t see him any-

r----
“About" ten years ago, while en-
gaged in; Shunting, my foot caught
between the rails, and my leg was
fractured below the knee. It healed
in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and
have been obliged, at times, to wear
a bandage. About a year ago it be-
came much worse, and I feared I
should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I did so, and
after taking four bottles the swell-
ing disappeared, and I have not
been troubled with it since.”

“groceries or provisions.”

skinner.
“The simplest hero I ever knew,” said an
old ex-sergeant of the 58th the other day, “ was in
our first Maori war. He and I were carrying grog
to the men in the trenches (Kawiti Pass). It was
dangerous work, and we had got about half way
when I heard him say ‘ Sergeant, I’m cooked.
Take the grog on, don’t mind me.’ On I had to
go. When I got back he was unconscious. We
found by the heavy, blood-trail that he had walked
about 100 yards before he spoke. Later on he sent
for me. He was dying and, as I bent over him,
he whispered : ‘ Say, did the boys get the grog
all right ? ’ I nodded. ‘ Did you tell ’em I didn’t
spill a drop ? ’ Again I nodded, and, smiling as if
he had won the V.'C., he died.”
A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole’s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the
block in Collins-street, Melb., a distance of 660ft.,
and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic: 1, New Books; 2, Second-
hand Books ; 3, Stationery; 4, Music ; 5, Fancy
Goods ; 6, Toys ; 7, Perfumery; 8, Pictures ; 9,
Artists’ Materials ; 10, an Ornamental Exhibition ;
11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery; 14, a Child’s Picture
Gallery ; 15, a Bargain Room ; 16, a Tea Room ;
17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half-a-million books. The
mam walks of the establishment are half-a-mile
long.*
The secrecy of the ballot in remote country
districts doesn’t amount to much. If, in every
electorate, all the ballot boxes were brought, un-
opened, to one common centre, and the papers
mixed together and then counted, the system
would answer well enough. When the dozen or
the few dozen votes given at some outlying polling
' place are counted in the presence of the two local
I squatters as scrutineers, it doesn’t answer at all.
The writer recalls one case where at a very small
polling place three votes were given to a demo-
cratic candidate —the local boss and scrutineer
being a Tory. The three voters were promptly
identified and sacked. One gave himself away by
using his own indelible pencil instead of the one
provided, and the fact that he habitually carried
an indelible pencil bowled him out. The other
two had been regarded with suspicion all along,
and were watched as they put their papers in the
box. The peculiar method of folding gave one
away, and a grimy thumb-mark on the paper
bowled out the other. A lot can be done by
judiciously changing the official pencil; if it is
first blue, then black, then red, and careful note is
made of the voters who use each kind, the field of
research is considerably narrowed down. In a
very small polling place a really smart scrutineer
who knows everybody around can identify almost
every individual vote and act accordingly.

The G-ulf ant-hills would really surprise a
Southerner. They are so thick in certain dis-
tricts that the country almost resembles a large
graveyard. Some of them are of great height—
nine and ten feet being nothing uncommon, and
they are all built in the one direction —due North
and South. This is attributed by many to the
desire of the ants to secure from the sun’s rays the
maximum of dessication. The hills are extremely
hard, being cemented by a glutinous secretion
exuded by the insects themselves. Building and
repairing are only carried on in the wet season.
The model informer—Bismarck.
Quoth quaintly an old Latin medical poem
found in MS. the other day in the National
Library, Paris “ To the patient you promise
cure, but immediately on leaving the room you
say to the relatives that the disease is grave. J lie
event will be that, if you cure him, your merit is
greater and you will receive the greater praise
and fee; while, if he dies, they will say that you
had no hope from the first! ” How keenly modern
in their ways were those belittled ancients!

A few words as to the progress and growth in
Sublic favour of the Registered Alfaline Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W. A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

Mr. Button writes later:—“The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”

weeks, but was getting no better ; and I shall never regret
trying your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect
on my complaint, which several of my work-mates can

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,

him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-

botanist, and the bonafides of his testimonials appear to
be well established.”
Cooktawn Courier, Queensland. —“ Herr Rassmus-
sen, we are glad to say, holds the highest place in the
colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”
Flashes (Society Paper), Brisbane, Q.—“ Herr Rass-
mussen’s labors have resulted in a manner most gratifying
to himself, inasmuch as he has received the highest re-

bably become as well known in Victoria as they are in
New South Wales.”
Evening Journal, Adelaide.—“ Herr Rassmussen
has achieved a high reputation for his skill in manufac-
turing botanical remedies.”
Sydney Trut»>. —“ Herr Rassmussen is sufficiently well

cured many people of complaints which were held to be
incurable.”
The Nord AiiStralisclie Zeitung, Brisbane.—“We
speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-

Australian Star, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the

He Q. bores. It has been demonstrated
that artesian water-supplies exist over 106,000
sq.-miles, or one-sixth of the province. The tem-
perature sometimes rises to 173deg. Altogether
100 miles of bore are down, at a cost of about £900
a mile. One bore out of every four is a failure.
On Boatman station there are three bores, pro-
ducing ten million gals, daily. Think of it!
Enough to supply a town of 200,000 persons with
60 gallons apiece daily.

Despite the “ borak ” poked by Bulletin
scribes, there is a grain or two of truth in the
frog reservoir legend. Thus the Larapintan ex-
plorers : “ As soon as the rain comes the frog
imbibes freely. The water permeates to all parts
of the body until it is swollen up like a cricket-
ball ; then it buries itself deep in the mud ; is
baked in; and lies moist and cool until another
wet season softens its environment.” This on the
most eminent scientific authority in Australia.
It was in a galvanised-iron bush church,
Temperature, 90deg. in the water-bag; ratio of
flies to seekers of the truth, 1000 to 1. The ser-
mon, “ Do unto others as you would have others
do unto you,” had just run dry. Whereupon up
rose six feet of bone and sweat, which wanted to
know why the &c. the roof at the parson’s end of
the show was painted with refrigerating paint,
and the rest wasn’t. And the parson looked
above, pulled a fly from his eye, and, with a sorry
smile, replied: “Ah ! my dear brother, that I
might be the better preserved to preaoh unto my
flook the glorious Terewth.”
Dear B.—-Up West the warm weather is
setting in, and the snakes are beginning to show
out. Last week my girl and two others went for
a walk and met one. Now, the Western creed
is—kill your snake or corner him till someone
comes along to do it. There were no sticks about,
and, not wanting him to continue a live snake,
they chased him ahead for about three miles, till
a lame swaggy came up and dropped heavy on
him. We’ve got the skin hanging up in the bar
of the local hotel, next the whisky bottle. If I
were at all given to exaggeration, I would say they
chased him seven miles, but I scorn deception.

“Cancer houses” are now a recognised
actuality. Dr. D’Arcy Power tells how a house-
keeper whp.had lived in a certain room of a par-
ticular house died of cancer of the stomach. A
year later the succeeding housekeeper who also
slept in that room died of cancer of the liver.
Eight years later her successor in the room died
of cancer of the breast and womb. These three
persons were unrelated by blood, and were appar-
ently in perfect health till they inhabited that
room. Dr. Blyth tells that three successive
tenants of one London house died of cancer, that
a frequent visitor of the last of these three also
died of cancer of the breast and lung, and that
this visitor’s niece, who slept with her, was also
operated on for cancer at 14 years of age. A
similar case to Power’s occurred in a Glasgow
house, where three successive night watchmen,
previously unrelated, and with no can-
cerous family history, died of cancer one after the
other. i

“ When Sellheim was warden there, of course.

“In the case of men and emancipated
hair-cropped women we contravene Nature’s law,
and Nature’s revenge is baldness. If the eman-
cipated woman can be made to understand that
wearing the hair short brings with it the danger
of baldness, she will have to be very thoroughly
emancipated, or she will give up this method of
emphasising her masculinity.” — Birmingham

Freedom: A Fable for Democrats.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Came a folk to proud Olympus, in the peer-
less days of old,
Crying, “Zeus, Great Zeus—O hear us!
From thy banquet-hall of gold
L aid thy peasants ear a moment, for their
plaint is loud and long
Of the grievous slights they suffer from the
iron hand of Wrong,
Of the hard hearts of the Mighty and the
grinding of the Strong.”
Then Zeus answered : “O, my people—came
your asses late to me
Crying, ‘ Zeus, Great Zeus—O hear us !
From the peasants set us free ;
For the loads they give are grievous and our
plaint is loud and long
Of our Freedom reft and rended by the iron
hand of Wrong,
Of the hard hearts of the Mighty, and the
grinding of the Strong. ’
“ Therefore spake I gently : ‘ Asses—Free-
dom suits not such as ye,
For ye love at heart a master, though a
despot oft he be ;
Yet in mercy this I grant you—Race of asses
evil-starred : .
From this day your hides, my creatures,
dented deep and cudgel-scarred,
Shall grow callous and unfeeling when the
blows are falling hard.’
“And your asses went rejoicing. Be ye
wise, my folk, as they ;
If ye will not fight to free you—see ye
toughen day by day ;
Teach your hides to thicken. Know ye—
from your cradles to your graves,
If ye did not crepp as cravens there would
stalk no despot knaves,
If ye were but Jit for Freedom never Man
shoidd make you slaves ! ”
N.Q.
P. LUFTIG.
At Wellington (M.L.), the other day, 14
ladies arrived in a group at the Registrar’s office
to look up the records and find out if the woman
next door was really married as she claimed to be,
that alleged bride being somehow viewed with
suspicion. A careful search showed that there
was no such marriage on the records, and the 14
went away looking happy, to cut the suspected
lady dead and otherwise make things hot for her.
And now the Registrar is waiting to hear of a
horrid butchery with an axe when the woman
next door hears of the kindly interest taken in her
character.
“And wretches hang that jurymen may
dine! ” will soon be once more the truth if the
gto<m-coercion of juries by Judges isn’t more
energetically resented by the juries themselves.
At Orange, the other dav, that little tin Win-
deyer, Judge Docker, couldn’t understand how a
jury “failed to agree in such a clear case.” But
no such expression of private opinion should have
had any influence upon men whose sworn duty it
was to judge with their own judgments, and not
with Mr. Docker’s—even in face of the calamitous
circumstance that Mr. D. “had intended to go
away that night, and now could not do so.” The
jury would, therefore, be locked-up till 7 next
morning (the newspaper report continues) and—-
“he could not order them any breakfast.”' N.S.
Wales has got rid of Judge Windeyer. It would
be well for it now to get rid of Judge Docker.
A fine point of law. A Melbourne man
left his wife in Victoria, and went to N.S.W.,
allegedly in search of work. He didn’t come back,
nor send for his wife, and after a while he van-
ished altogether. The lady applied for a divorce
on the ground of desertion, and Judge Hood
argued the matter out thus : If the old man
intended desertion when he left his wife in Vic-
toria, then the desertion occurred there and the
Court had jurisdiction. If he meant to come
back, but afterwards, while in New South Wales,
decided that he wouldn’t, then the desertion
occurred in New South Wales, and the Melbourne
Court couldn’t interfere. If he was half-inclined
to desert his wife while in Victoria, and arrived
at the other half of the resolution in New South
Wales, then the situation was mixed. There was
no evidence either way, but Judge Hood decided
that he would naturally intend at first to come
back, but drifted gradually into the habit of stay-
ing away, and refused the decree on the ground
that he had no jurisdiction. This may be good
law, but if it is meant as a regular thing it is very
poor common sense. Quite probably the old man
never came to any resolution, but simply post-
poned his return because his pants couldn’t bear
inspection, and kept on postponing it owing to
the continued deterioration of his pants, and
didn’t write because the ink-bottle was dried up.
Most people simply meander, and never quite
resolve to do anything.
Dodging the Inspector .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Saunders and Harrison were teachers in
charge of backblocks schools some 10 miles apart.
JNaturaHy they fraternised, sympathised with each
o hers grievances against “the Department,” and
ipped the mutual wink when the Inspector was
about. Sometimes he visited one school first;
sometimes the other.
One day, however, Saunders was caught nap-
ping. the Inspector wasn’t due for three months
when he dropped suddenly from the clouds. A
new one, too—worse luck ; with fresh peculiarities
to study, and fresh prejudices to wheedle.
He opened fire at once. 1 ‘ Good morning, Mr.
feaunders. Don’t you think it is time your school
was assembled at 10.15 ? ”
Saunders looked uneasy; but led the wav into
the school-house and the examination started.
In vain Saunders looked for some traveller to
convey a message to Harrison. The day wore on,
and the examination was completed. The in-
spector departed, and made for Harrison’s school
by a road which also led to the township of Mary-
burg, wliither he informed Saunders he was going.
Still no message was sent to Harrison. But
next morning a bullock-team passed by Saunders’s,
and bullocky” was entrusted with “ the
message.” An hour later, a drayman passed ;
and, as he was likely to overtake the “ bullocky,”
he was given the message also. Then a horseman,
coming along a short time after, was told to ride
briskly and inform Mr. Harrison that the In-
spector was about.
* * « *
The scene changes to Harrison’s school,
with the examination going on nicely. Suddenly
the noise of a great shouting is heard outside.
a arr i son » the Inspector has been up at
old Saunders’s, and he says he will be down here
to-day.”
“What’s that, Mr. Harrison ?” asked the in-
spector. Harrison hadn’t heard anything, and
the examination proceeded.
An hour later there was a frightful yell outside
the school-house :
Harrison ! Harrison ! The Inspector is up at
Saunders’s school, and he says you’re to look out
for the old devil. ”
Harrison went to the door and returned looking
uncomfortable; and again the work began, and
was proceeding quietly when a third voice, louder
than either of the preceding, interrupted the
inspector. ;
“Stand over, Bloomer, you ——■ ! Gee,
ftoaney ! Boh, Dandy ! Stand oyer, Bloomer,
you ——— ; I’ll kill you, you cowl We-e-ee ! ”
The inspector looked at Harrison curiously, and
there was a short silence.
Then : “Mr. Harrison, the blanky old inspector
has been at Saunders’s yesterday, and the old
blank may be down here soon. ”
“ All right, my man; all right; lam here,”
said the inspector, coming to the verandah.
Then; “Mr. Harrison, are you troubled like
this every day? It is disgraceful,” said the
inspector.
Harrison reigned only three weeks longer in the
service.
On the whole, Saunders “ preferred to resign.”
Q.
H.O.G.
The efforts of Australian Parliaments to
define the hours of labor and construct scales of
wages are, so far from being a new legislative
departure, a very old, almost ancient one. Such
attempts are commonly denounced by politicians
as un-British, un-English, Socialistic, and so forth,
but in reality they are more English than any
other of the prominent movements of the time.
The “ Statute of Laborers,” passed by the British
Parliament, dates from the year 1496, and is in
tenor a factory, workshops and field-workers’ Act.
In it the hours of work are strictly defined and the
wages to be paid determined. That the hours
were longer than now and the wages less does not
affect the point. The historical fact is that the
legislation now called novel in spirit is actually
almost as old as our civilisation.
“Gates closed” is the brief inscription
facing would-be visitors to Sydney Hospital on
visiting-days, the authorities not taking the trouble
to add any intimation that the visitors’ entrance
has been shifted from the front in Macquarie-st.
to the rear in the Domain. This, of itself, means
a long detour, but many persons wait on in
the belief that the gates will be opened directly.
“Why was the visitors’ entrance shifted?”
“Well, sir, you see, it’s the quality opposite.”
“The what ? ” “The quality. The bigwigs that
live in those houses across the road. They made
complaints that they didn’t ought to be sickened
with the sight of all sorts of persons of all classes
flocking to the hospital on visiting-days to see
their sick friends. It offended their eyes.” “Per-
haps, too, that’s the reason why the building of
this new wing was blocked for so many years ? ”
“ The real secret of it, sir.” !!! The quality 11
A proposition drafted for the forthcoming
Lambeth Conference is to the effect that all
bishops of colonial provinces shall take an oath of
allegiance to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Several Australian bishops are stoutly opposed to
the innovation, believing that it tends to a Papacy
of Canterbury, and are determined to make their
opposition heard. . .
Tobacco-smoke largely prevents infectious
disease. For one man-smoker who contracts
diphtheria three non-smokers are attacked. For
practical comparison, women are non-smokers and
men are smokers. Compared by sexes, we again
find three non-smoking (women) diphtheritics for
one smoker (man). Prof. Hajek, of Vienna,
deduces this from the health records of three sue-
cessive years of the Austrian capital.
Habitat: “A rule, stuck up all over
Melb. Public Library, is that uo volume, under
any circumstances, is to be removed. Going, only
yesterday, for the new vols. of a periodica), I find
them all wolfed away by some privileged leader-
writer.”
j n countries where opium-smoking is cus-
tomary, it is not uncommon (says Annals of
Veterinary Medicine, France) to see cats, dogs
and monkeys that are much in the presence of
men acquire a taste for opium, in consequence of
inhaling the fumes given out by smokers. Which
statement can be confirmed by numerous Australian
cas,es, where pet native-bears have acquired the
habit of inhaling tobacco-smoke from their masters,
chewing up tobacco left lying around, and even
eating clay or wooden pipes left about the house.

Branna Satburg.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Branna Satburg was scraping gum in a sod
whare, by Auckland harbor—a big woman, with
pale yellow hair : a Swede, from the shores of
Bothnia.
She sat on an old soap-box, and held a long
manuka stick against her left shoulder. With her
left. hand she held lumps of earth'-encrusted gum
against the stick, and scraped off rust and dirt with
swift, drawing cuts of a sharp knife. The brittle
amber-like substance powdered under her strokes,
and this powder filled the air with the scent of
pines—the ghostly perfume of kauris that had
perished a thousand years ago, hidden in the fossil
resin her husband had dug from the ground.
The candle that lit the windowless whare smelt
like a pineknot. The burning logs on the hearth
were the hearts of dead kauris, dragged from a
neighboring swamp. The wind driving against
the raupo thatch sang the song of pines. The
semi-darkness was the gloom of a pine forest.
Scent of pines, sound of pines, aye, and sight of
pines, for the woman, in fancy, was walking in the
pine forests that slope to the Kalix, and she saw'
the golden moss and the green on the serried
tracks. She trod on a springy carpet of pine-
needles. She saw Carl with the light of the mid-
night sun on his face coming to meet her.
A wave of passion and desire swept into the
woman’s mind. She sprang to her feet; she must
tread on the path of pine needles, feel the spirit
of the forest. She flung open the door and saw
long smooth slopes of dark manuka scrub, stretches
of tidal mud and salt water; and there was her
lord and master toiling up the path with a pikau
of gum on his shoulders, and his polished spade
gleaming red with the rays of a stormy sunset.
A hard smile crossed the woman’s face as she saw
the man sway in his tracks. She clutched the
great knife ; looked beyond him, above him, to the
dark hill-ranges sloping up to the roof of massive
clouds. There were forests boundless and
measureless on those ranges. Pines in countless
millions breathing the spirit of youth.
The man staggered to the door, threw his pikau
on the ground, hung his spade beneath the pro-
jecting thatch and stood before her—a sullen,
burly, ill-tempered fellow, sodden with drink.
“You hag,” he said, “why do you stare with
your green eye at me ? Out of my way ! ”
He strode into the hut and looked around.
“Devil,” he shouted, “you have not worked:
there is no food for me. Bah ! fool! Woman,
was it for this that I took you from Karl Abbstein?
You were not worth a lie. I told him you were
false and he believed, the fool! the fool! ”
“ Fool yourself! ” screamed the woman in
sudden fury, and she slashed the knife she held
across the man’s face and left a red, gaping, hor-
rible wound. He sank to the floor with the blood
pouring on to his chest, and she fled out of the
whare : out with the wind towards the forests on
the ranges. The wind drove lines of rain against
Jter; whipped her forward. She rose up the bare
spur; turned once, and saw spread far below her
the smooth, green undulations of the manuka
country ; she saw, or fancied she saw, that whare
by the tidal creek ; the man with a red wound ;
then she entered the forest, and darkness.
There was no springy needle carpet to walk on.
Wet moss, sticky mud. She pushed upward
through the dripping undergrowth. Upward, for
it was on the high ridges that the pine-trees grew.
She lost her slippers in the mire; lost some of
her dress against the bushes ; her great ..pile of
yellow hair tumbled over her shoulders, and there
was only blackness before her. She walked on
and on, striving: blindly to reach the pine forests,
to breathe their perfume, feel their sheltering
arms.
All was darkness, the rain fell in sheets, and
now before and around her rose barriers of vegeta-
tion, rata vines, thorny lawyers, wharangi and
supplejack. She was imprisoned, but she fought
with Northern fury and won freedom. There
before her was a light—a quaint, high-roofed
Bothnia house. She pressed the wooden latch,
opened the door, and stood in the full light of a
great log fire. A man rose slowly, grasped his
bright felling axe : saw the woman : saw the
yellow hair falling loose, the white face, the big
blue eyes. The axe slid to the floor. “Branna,”
he muttered, softly, “a dream ! ”
“ Karl! ” she shrieked ; “ Karl! Touch me—
clasp me—l am real—l am not false ! ”
F. ROLLIT.
When the Shed Cut Out.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Burhunga cut out the first week in Sep-
tember, Wild, wiry-woolled brutes most of the
sheep were, plentifully daubed with dags, and
burry. The classer smoked and swore, the boss
shook out the sand and grunted, and we who
were on the shearing board never earned our
money harder.
Friday was pay-day. As we hung about “Go-
vernment House,” awaiting our cheques, the
hawkers got to work. First there came an Afghan
—or something colored, anyway. Then “ The
Chump, ” who had bottomed the tally most days,
had his “pitch.” It was his avowed intention to
give that sanguinary nigger “ partikler hell ” ; and
he did it. We had at last learned “ The Chump’s”
strong point: it wasn’t cooking, for we’d run him
at that, and it wasn’t shearing, and it wasn’t
yarning. It was intense patriotism. “ Australia
for the Australians ” was his motto.
From Afghans to Chinamen was a short jump.
“ Don’t ‘ The Banjo ’ say he saw the Chows shear-
ing—yes, not cooking, shearing ? Listen :
I looked along the shearin’ floor before I turned to go—
There were eight or ten dashed Chinamen a-shearin’ in
a row.
And it’ll be those other yellow whelps there next
—eh ? Yes, encourage them to hang round shear-
ing sheds, do.”
And so on. Abdul Khan was given ten minutes
to “get.” He sadly packed his wares, shook up
his reins, and, cursing, “got.”
Abdul Khan, who had camped just outside the
home paddock over-night and so had got in early,
was succeeded by the man from the township
stores who came with his hawking cart. He, too,
spread out his goods around him, and, squatting
down, began to bargain. Again “ The Chump ”
harangued the group. But this time he varied
the argument. He pictured the sweating dens of
the cities.
“ That coat in his hand now—yes, buy it. A
dozen of ’em were finished for a blanky Jew by a
starving Christian girl (the sister of one of us
blokes, for all I know) for 15d.— yes, 15d. a dozen.
Fourteen hours work for 15d. Garn, buy it—and
encourage that sort of thing, too, and bring
another poor devil of a girl to the gutter that
feeds hell. . . . Them boots—Oh, yes, I know
>em, and some of the poor starved wretches that
made ’em. One’s a brother of mine, if he isn t
dead by now. I’d crawl on my splintered bones to
a decent shop where a man gets what he earns
rather than tramp out a pair of them and a man s
soul at the same time.”
There was fire in the little man. The knot
around the huckster got smaller, but the social
and moral reformer stuck to his post; and there
wasn’t a man who mortgaged his cheque.
Then a hawking-boat pulled in and moored to a
tree. But the owner was a Jew, and the super-
cargo had a Jewish name, which he had done his
little best to corrupt —he was Cohen ai d had called
himself Colquhoun —and so “The Chi mp’s ” work
was easy.
* * * *
The office was open, and the cheques were
ready.
“ Thompson,” said the boss, “ I don’t, of course,
approve of agitators; yet I think the men ought
to be grateful to you for urging them to keep their
cheques unbroken until they get to their homes.
I am sorry your own is not larger.”
• * * *
There are two routes from Burhunga to the
railway centre. One is by way of the township,
which is a God-forsaken splotch on a box-fringed
wilderness of sand, consisting of two pubs., a
butcher’s shop, a saddler’s, and half-a-dozen
private residences built mostly of rough-sawn
timber covered with thatch. The other route is
over a billabong, and available only in this droughty
weather.
Three days before the cut-out we had discussed
how we should go. The regular coach people
would take us in for £2 ss. a head. The repre-
sentative of the hawking-boat would take us
down to the township for nothing, and from there
we could get in for thirty shillings. The night
before the cut-out the regular’s agent, having
meantime been offered a subsidy by the two pub-
keepers, said he would carry us right through for
thirty shillings.
“ Oh, well, if it comes to cutting,” chipped in
Rawlins, who ran the Victoria on the Billabong,
and had dropped in quite promiscuously on the
way to the township—“ if they can do it at thirty
bob, so can I; and if you do miss the township
you’ll swallow a pint the less sand and get to town
the sooner. ”
From thirty, the offer went down on the other’s
part to twenty-five; and Rawlins topped it with
“a quid.”
At that Rawlins got the job. No “Chump”
was conveniently on hand to vehemently protest
against the immorality of the competition.
♦ * * *
Rawlins and his pub. are not troubled by
neighbors. The nearest, a boundary rider, is at
the Sixteen Mile, three miles back. At the pub.
Rawlins collected the fares and “shouted.”
Then they had some feed.
The change of horses was made smartly. There
were no suspicious circumstances about Rawlins,
“ The Chump ” observed, pointing to the team : he
didn’t want to take them down. So they drank
again. And again. A casual or two dropped in.
“ The Chump ” suspected one of being “ a scab.”
Triumphantly producing his union ticket, there
was, of necessity, another drink, “ The Chump ”
shouting.
“Yes, why not? A little scratch sports meet-
ing—quoits, and a flat and a hurdle-race, and a
jump.”
“ Sweepstakes, of course,” said “the Chump,”
who had reluctantly taken a hand—“with
the ‘Victoria Handicap’ to follow—yours, eh,
boss ? A couple of quid, shall we say ? ’
Rawlins was agreeable. .
Soon Rawlins’ “ wife’s cousin ” and the girl
from the bar ” had to go out and hold the tape—
“ just for the big go, the Handicap. ”
By this time the running was not absolutely
straight, and there were a couple of falls. There
wag a dispute, of course; but the demure “missus’s
cousin ” was the fair peacemaker. They all went
and had a drink over the fact that there hadn t
been any unpleasantness.
The horses had been taken out again.
“A sing-song? Oh, yes; if you like. And
perhaps Nellie—that’s thewnissus’s cousin, y’know
—will play the piano, and sing. She can, take
my word for it; but she’s a bit shy, and may take
some coaxing.”
Nellie was coaxed accordingly; and then be-
witched us. Three separate fights ensued ; round
six separate pairs of shoulders did Nellie throw
her arms and beg the dear fellow not to quarrel;
and six separate men pledged themselves not to
do it, just for her sake —and then were turned
over to Maggie, “ the girl in the bar,” who mean-
time made such conquests as she could.
“ I wish they’d get dead-drunk, if they must,”
she whispered to each—“all, I mean, but you;
and then—and then I wouldn’t be so busy, and—
and —”
She spoke the rest with her eyes, and each one
thought he understood. Whereupon in ecstacy
he drank, and she sipped, and so he held the
illicit contract sealed.
“I’m afraid they’re going to keep it up all
night,” she said. “Now, go in, do, with the
rest, and don’t hang around here, or there’ll be
suspicion, and then ”
He thought he understood —and went.
* * * *
We took a vote the next day, somewhere
after noon, as to whether we should move on.
But Nellie and Maggie looked out, and—well, we
didn’t go.
* * * *
Two of us threw our swags over our
shoulders that night and sneaked away. I met
one of the most-smitten of Nellie’s victims a
fortnight afterwards in town.
“ Hullo ! Is Rawlins’s coach in ? ”
“ Damn Rawlins ! ”
“ But when d’ye get here?”
“ Tramped in yesterday. Rawlins never drove
an inch past his shanty. There was always a
majority against him starting. Those women
‘ had ’ us. And the little devil Thompson,
‘The Chump,’ why, the missus’s cousin—Nellie,
you know —she’s ‘ The Chump’s ’ wife. And ‘ The
Chump ’ is Rawlins’s buttoner, and his wife’s.
And, by thunder, she is fly.”
