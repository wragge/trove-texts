Under this title the Sydney Freeman’s
Journal publishes a synopsis of Leo XIII.’s
last Encyclical. It is ■
ft document which—
assuming the correct-
ness of the resume—
belongs to a much
higher order of art
than the Russian de-
spatches from Merv or
even than Lord Bea-
consfield’s state-
ments on his return
from the Conference
at Berlin. In the two
latter oases, although
credit is due to the
Muscovite general and
to the British states-
man for the admirable
gravity they pre-
served while supply-
ing their countrymen
and the world with
simple truths of the
Jules Vbbne pattern,
still their art was not
consistent. Through
rents in the garb of
seriousness with which
they covered their real
views, you got occa-
sional glimpses of the
mockery that lay be-
hind. Not so with Leo
XIII. To such per-
fection has he brought
the are celare artem
that, although you
know he is laughing
all the time, you can
never actually detect
him. It is said that
no man with a sense
of humour ever in-
vented or even intro-
duced a new religion.
His face, during the
most solemn rites,
would betray him.
Since reading the En-
cyclical, however, we
believe that, by con-
stant practice extend-
ing over a number of
years, one’s features
may become so accus-
tomed to immobility
that the muscles, par-
ticularly of the m outh,
refuse to perform
their office whether
the provocation comes
from a maxim of
Rochefoucauld or a
flash from Yoltaibe.
It is a singular docu-
ment. Let us exam-
ine it.

“ A governing: author-
ity is necessary for men
constituted in civil sc-
clety-an authority which
ls derived from nature and consequently has God
for Its author. . . . Whatever be the kind of
Government, the heads of States ought to have

will subjects come to respect authority, recog-
nising that it comes from God. To despise lealtl-
toate authority, no matter in whom it is vested, is

Strange, is It not, to think of an aged
man’s sitting at his er *3 i I he world’s most
famous city-a city which has witnessed the
rise and fall of every form of rule devised by
man—to write in fierce condemnation of the
right of men to change their type of govern-
ment? Was the authority of Charles, of
James, of George Ilf., of Lours XIY,,
Charles X., Lours Philippe, the second
Republic and Louis Napoleon legitimate?
If it was, then the English, Americans, and

French have constantly rebelled against
Heaven. Cromwell, William 111, Wash-
ington, Napoleon I, Louis Philippe,
Lamartine, Louis Napoleon, and Gam-
betta were traitors. But, if it was not,
then it was the rulers they pulled down who
were the rebels, if the Papacy acknowledged
the right of the Stuarts, the Guelphs, the
Bourbons, and the Republics to rule, why
did it subsequently ck-owledge as lejiti-
mate the authority of those who destroyed
or defied them ? If the Bourbons ob-
taioel their power from God, the Pope
who crowned the First Bonaparte was
false to his trust. Hortense's bastard
not a'one des’roytd the ill-fated Go-
vernment of ’43, to which he had
sworn allegiance, but destroyed France
afterwards. Having bribed his drunken
soldiery to murder in cold blood hundreds
of Frenchmen and Frenchwomen, he sent
hundreds of the flower of the nation to rot
in the swamps of Cayenne. By means of an
a 1 ministration where every second man
was a thief, and of a court where every
second woman was a trull, he so debauched
a gallant nation that when at last she re-
covered from her long intoxication it was
to find her f u-est provinces ov< r-run and a
merciless foe knocking at the gates of the
citadel. Yet there was no protest from
Leo’s predecessor against this regime of
shame. Louis’ authority was “ derived
from nature, and consequently had God for
its author.” The authorship was strength-
ened by the Pope’s blessing. French bishops
slept on down while Victor Hugo starved
in exile. But neither the Divine suzerainty
nor the Apostolic
blessing, backed up by
an Empress’s genu-
flections before geld
Madonnas and lighted
tapers, availed aught
in keeping the hereti-
cal Prussians from
marching under the
Arc dc Trlomphe,

“The right of go-
verning can only come
from God,” says the
Encyclical. Granting
such to be the case, it
would naturally fol-
low that the men and
women whom the
Creator selected for
such exalted duties
would be the best He
could find. If such is
the fact, then, indeed,
is human nature irre-
deemably corrupt.
Por it is notorious that
the great bulk of the
world’s monarchs
Ihave been murderers,
lechers, fribbles, or
fools—sometimes all
four. Take our own
rulers from the time
of the Norman con-
quest. The bare record
of their lives consti-
tutes one of the mean-
est and bloodiest
pages in the annals of
mankind. Shocking
inhumanity, unbrid-
led lust, treachery,
superstition, ignor-
ance, stupidity un-
fathomable, meanness
mmeasurable, fill the
Ireary page from top
o bottom. No, we
cannot compliment
the Deity on His selec-
tion. Yet it was to
amuse these creatures
that brave men will-
ingly gave up their
lives and chaste
I women their virtue—
that lawyers drafted
savage laws and
pi ies ts sang Te Deurm!

But we must hurry
ra :
“ Therefore, to oast off
obedience and produce a
•evolution In a country
means of sedition is
reason not only against
nan but against God.
. . As the greatest of
.11 duties is that of em-
bracing religion In spirit and truth-not that
which one prefers, but that which God has pre-
scribed, and which indubitable proofs establish as
the only true one-so political societies cannot,
without a crime . . . neglect religion as some-
thing alien and useless, or accept one of a number
of religions Indifferently, according to their good
pleasure. . . . Numerous and clear proofs,
such as the truth of prophecies, the multitude of
miracles, the testimony of the martyrs, and other
similar arguments show that that is the only rell-


lio* which Jesus'Christ himself founded. . . .
op then has divided the government of thehu-
mn race between two powers—the eooleslsstica
ad the civl*. ... One of them has for Its
roximate and chief atm the owe of the goods oi
his world, the other the attainment of the goods
i heaven that are eternal.”
low terrible to think of tho long line or
lluslrious men who, in order to raise their
ellows—to dispel the dense clouds of ignor-
mee in which their struggling brothers were
wrapped—braved neglect, calumny, hunger,
lealh itself, and then think of the millions
who, with the star of the twentieth century
ilmost on the horizon, look up with rever-
aiioe to the writer of such jargon! Accord-
ing to ic there is not a ruler in the world
whose authority is legitimate. All the
thrones and presidential chairs on earth are
at present occupied by rulers who rule by
virtue ot former revolutions. If James 11.
was right then all his successors were wrong.
If Louis XYt. derived his power from God,
whence does Grew obtain his? Fsancls
Joseph should still be Emperor of Ger-
many, and Victoria Queen of America.
Whwe will the absurd list end? In
struggling to be free ail Irishmen wei e
guilty of “treason, not alone against
man but against God.” So were the
Scots, the Poles, the Hungarians, the Bul-
ghrlans, and the French. Or is it that, in
order to obtain the Papal benediction, re-
bellipß must be successful ? This is a danger-
ous doctrine to preach. For it approves of
the sceptic il but victorious sausculoiism of
’B9, and condemns the Irish national rising
of ’9B. Leo’s denial of a man's right to
ohoble his own religion, and nis idea of
what constitutes “iudubitable” proofs of
the Catholic faith are simply delicious. If
the deaths of martyrs prove the truth of a
belief, all religions are equally tine and
equally false. The verity of C ithollcism is
I more i stablished than that of Frotestant-
or Judaism by the slaughtrof St. Bar-
>femew, the fires of Smithfleld, the
nmatiou of the Yaudois, or the abomina-
ns ot the Inquisition. So far, again, ss
raolos are concerned, those of the Parsers,
ddbists, and Mahommedans are much in
vancsof ours. Zoroaster walked for a
>nth on the sea, while our Saviour was
ateutwilh an hour or two. Bdddh a fasted
ree months at a stretch, was fed for six
ars with figs and honey by an ape, and.
th onesermon, converted twelve thousand
akes. A leg of mutton told Mahomet that
was poisoned; the moon not only stood
ilFat his command, but he (ve quote from
ivikg’s “ Life of Mahomet” )

tirades is permitted, Christianity will be
aoed rather at a disadvantage. So with
•ophesies. It will be time enough to settle
ie question of whether or not they have
3 en fulfilled, when any two persons can be
mnd to agree on their meaning. The
huroh says that certain things are foretold
i the Old Testament. The Jevs, whoso
wefatbers wrote the books, say they are
It. Surely it would be only fair to al ow
lese stubborn people a voice in detormin-
ig what their ancestors meant. The He-
brew's trustworthiness may bo open to
Lisploion when vending ready-made cloth-
oig, but it is improbable that he would
alee liberties with his sacred volumes. We
an conceive nothing more irritating than
o write a book and then be told by a
tranger that you did not know what you
leant, while he did. It is not surprising
h*t this stiff-necked tribe has abandoned
rne literature, and taken to book-making,
when it meets with treatment like this.
i. .." ® • • ®
“ The attainment of the goods of heaven
ihat are eternal” appears to be the misan
I'etre of the eoclesiastioal power. But uni-
versal experience shows that the attain-
ment of earthly goods is not beyond its pro-
vince. When a man preaches the advantages
of poverty while living in a palace, he must
not be surprised if an unreasoning world
shoots out the tongue and passes on. When
the founder of a faith is content with rags
and refuse while his followers demand dia-
monds and dainties, it requires subtle argu-
ment to show the applicability of semper
eadem. It is estimated that, before the
Reformation, one-third of all England was
Church property. It would thus seem that
the possession of a fair share of the ephe-
meral goods of this world is not incompatible
with a firm belief in the superiority of po-
verty. A few more excerpts from this power-
ful Encyclical, and we have done. The Vioar
of CrinisT unsparingly condemns anyone
w l ho ventures to “freely think on whatever
subject he likes,” and, with keen acumen,
points out that, “in a society founded on
those principles, Government is only the
will of tho people.” A Government erected
on such a shifting foundation as the people’s
will is apt, we are told, to consider “ that
no religion should be publicly professed;
nor ought there to be any inquiry which
of many is alone true; nor ought ©ne to be
preferred to the rest; nor ought one to be
specially favoured, but to er.c s ai'kc p qual
rights ought to he assigned.” There is little
doubt that Darwin knew more of biology,
Draper of other sciences, and Mill of logic
than all the Popes from Bt. Peter rolled
into one. But it was wrong for them to
think as they liked. The Church alone pos-
sesses that right. In other words, the per-
son who never got beyond long-division is
to lay down rules for the mathematical
guidance of him who worked out the differ-
ential calculus. Suppose that States did in-
quire which of many religions was true, and
rejected Catholicism, what then ?
* • *
“The Idea prevails,” his Holiness sorrowfully
goes 00, “ that princes are really nothing hut
delegates to express the popular will. . . The
u-icontrolled right of thinking and publicly pro-
claiming one’s thoughts is not inherent in the
rights of citizens. . . The origin of public power
is to be sought from God Himself and not from
the multitude. . . The Church judges it not
lawful that the various kinds of Divine worship
should have the same right as the true religion.”
Many more opinions equally luminous are
to be found scattered through this able
letter. Far be it from us to say that princes
do not derive their power direct from God.
We merely suggest that the number of
bayonets they have behind them is an
important factor in the matter. The widen-
ing the Paris streets in order to give “ grape ”
fair play among the crowds may have been
one of the ways in which Providence de-
clared in favour of Louis Napoleon. Pro-
vidential manifestations assume various
eh .p<a. In Burmah they appear as a British
expedition—as a French in Madagascar. A
visit to our own Parliament might lead
to tin opinion that the members’ right
to “ think and publicly proclaim their
thoughts” oould safely be curtailed, but
for the suspicion that they do neither. In
conclusion, we can frankly recommend the
last Encyclical to the curious amongst us,
who, while denied the right of thinking for
themselves, are not prohibited from collect-
ing literary curiositits.
Fobertsonian Liberalism
The man uninfluenced, by personal bias
who, having read Sir John RonEtiTSON’s
address to the electors of Mudgee, will say
that it indicates the adoption of Liberal
principles—which, we have been told, were
to characterise the programme of the Go-
vernment-must be the possessor of a lower
order of intelligence than we should expect
to find outside of the Ministry. Sir John
has been likened to an old hen with one
chicken —“my land-law” —and a perusal of
the address shows that the old hen is
still disconsolate because of the death of the
chicken. The old law was as illiberal as any
land measure could be. Instead of settling
an industrious class of people on the soil, it
has created a source of future trouble and
possibly bloodshed: that is, large landed
estates. The new law has serious imperfec-
tions—in fact, according to our view, it is
founded on entirely erroneous principles—
and in what way does Sir John Robertson
propose to amend it? He has persistently
denounced the Act as a squatters’ measure,
yet he no w proposes to alter it so as to make
it more decidedly a law in favour of the
squatters. A better friend than Sir John
the squatters emld not wish to have. They
have always said : “ Give us a secure tenure
at a fair rental and we shall be satisfied;
you may be sure that if we know there is no
possibiUty of the confounded selectors tak-
ing the land from us we shall use it to the
best advantage by making improvements.”
They have, under the new law, got secured
leases for 20 years; the rents have not yet
been fixed, but when they are we venture
to predict that they will be found to be
totally inadequate the much-talked-of
drought and the fall in the pric-? of wool are
propitious circumstances for the squatters,
considering that their rents are to
be appraised almost immediately—and
now Sir John says in effect:—“ln addi-
tion to the advantages with which you have
said that you would be satisfied, I will
take care that you get compensation for
your improvements on the expiry of your
leases.” Truly a Liberal idea—for the squat-
ters ! The compel sation is to be paid by the
incoming tenant, and it is assumed that for
the privilege of “fleecing” their successors,
the men now in possession will willingly pay
the Government £500,000 at the outset. For
what ? To secure the repayment to them-
selves of £10.000,000, which it is estimated will
be spent on improvements within 20 years,
from which improvements they will have
derived enormous profits! This is the
statesmanlike way in which part of the de-
ficit left as the result of Clans’ bungling,
DAiiiiET’s Imperialism, and Stu art's re-
cent incapacity is to be made up.
• * *
When the Land Bill was under oomidera-
tion Sir John fought most pertinaciously
against the principle of compensation, ex-
cept in the form of allowing the lessees to
purchase land in virtue of their improve-
ments. Why does he not adhere to that
policy ? Because he knows that the people
are unmistakably opposed to it. The pro-
posal which he now makes is still more
vicious. Under the old improvement pur-
chase system, the State, while giving the
I? a privilege —and one which was
valued by the squatters—gained a
liary advantage—that is, if it cm bo
ied that there is any advantage in dis-
% of land at £1 per acre; but under
)hn’s new idea the lessees alone will
an advantage. The principle of giv
impensation to the squatters can only
Rifled on one ground, viz, that they
some right to the possession of the
beyond the term of their lease,
are not compelled to make any im-
minent whatever—so long as they pay
fixed rental the demands of the
are satisfied. It is only right
ppose that when they make improve-
s under these circumstances they ex-
to derive compensating advantage
them during their term of occupancy
e land. They have no right to expect
e paid for any advantage which may
re after they have ceased to have any
title to the land; to assume to the
rary would be to hold that they had a
etual hold of the land. There may, of
se, be exceptional cases, in which it
id seem just to give a man compensa-
tor valuable improvements; but, on
id grounds the principle is not defen-
i as applied to the lands of the people.
■ • *
does not require much consideration to
over that Sir John’s latest proposal is
oughly impracticable, or that if it were
into practice it would be manifestly
ist to some one. Suppose that a lessee
* improvements on his run and that the
rsisers appointed hy the Government
that the incoming tenant must pay
)0 for these, can the State reasonably
him to pay a rental which will corres-
d with the increased value of the land ?
b can, the new tenant will have to pay
ce over for the improvements, and in
instance to a man who has no right to
land. Or suppose that, on the expiration
he lease, no one applies fora new l<?ase,
tie old lessee to continue in possession of
land at the old rental, untilsomeoneelse
ns to pay the exorbitant sum which he
I the Government appraisers may say
resents the value of the improvements?
' what length of time are the improve-
nts to retain the value for which the lessee
to be entitled to compsmsatiou ? What
[movements are to be allowed for V What
obe the basis of valuation—the increased
ue of the land or the actual cost of the
provements? Will not the ptinoiple, if
plied in any form, leal to more gigantic
uds than were ever perpetrated under
5 improvement-purchase system ? t?ir
hn claims that one of the advantages of
; proposal is that the Government will
ver be called upon to pay the compensa-
nin any form. Suppose that, on theex-
•y of a lease, the Minister determines that
a land is required for the purposes of
Element, who, then, will pay the squatter
mpensation for his improvements? The A ct
its present form will not permit of selec-
rs being saddled with such a burden, and
nee, if it is to be borne at aP, it will have
be cast on the shoulders of the State. We
uld continue these pertinent questions to
iy extent, but it would be a wade of ink,
iper, and of precious space, and an un-
erited reflection on our readers’ intelli*
>nee to do so—the absurdity of the latest
chertsonian craze ii too se’f-evideat to
?ed pointing out.
* * *
If this is one of the “Liberal” principles
hich is to bind Mr. O’Shliavan body and
ml to the new Government, he must have
very much mistaken notion of the demb-
ratic mission which he professes to pursue,
a his address to the electors of Young the
[inister for Lands—with the concurrence of
is colleagues, it is to be presumed—openly
dvocated the repeal of one of the redeem-
og features of the Stuabt Land Act —that
rhich provides for a periodical increase
f the rents of runs. The Govern-
ment proposals focussed mean that the
quatters are to get the full benefit of the
•astoral resources of the land, and of rail-
ways and other conveniences provided
>y the State, the latter receiving from
ts valuable estate something less than
sail pay the cost of administration. If
his be Liberalism, we confess at once that
ve don’t understand it.
« * »
Then we are told that payment of mem-
bers is to be a plank in the Government
platform. The principle has had the con-
sistent advocacy of The Boixetin, but we
do not care to see it sacrificed to suit the
purposes of Sir John Robebtson. Has he
not, all through his long and injurious—to
the country —political career, been a deter-
mined opponent of the system; and what is
more, did he not, in the last speech which
he made in Parliament, sneer it in an un-
disguised manner ? If the principle is worth
contending for, it is because of its sound-
ness as a principle, but not as a means of
catching votes with a view of keeping in
office a body of men whose only claim to
their positions is, that, out of 120 members
cf the Assembly, a less capable Ministry,
viewed in any light, could not b® selected.
Here is another example of the “ liberalism’ ’
of this extraordinary Government. Three
members of it are pronounced Protrc-
tionists—Messrs. Hetdon, Garrabd, and
Vaughn— and one, Mr. Young, an avowed
advocate of intercolonial Freetrade—which
means the opening of a splendid market for
the manufactures of Victoria. Yet we are
told that it is the intention of the Govern-
ment to maintain the settled fiscal policy of
the country —Freetrade! How can Mr.
Heydon reconcile his position in the
Government with his self-assumed position
as leader of the Protectionist party ? What-
i ever hope that gentleman may have had
of political distinction, he has most un-
doubtedly lost it for ever by his action in
joining a politician who is opposed to him
in every important principle which he
espouses.
The Law and the Gospel.
The contest between Joseph Symes, the leader of
the Melbourne Secularists, and the Victorian Go-
vernment is one of the most Interesting tight a
which have come off in these colonies for many
a long year. There is a principle at stake in it, a
real motive for warfare, which is more than can
be said for most political conflicts. Excepting to
themselves and their immediate friends and
flunkies, what does it matter to a colony whether
the Jorkins set are “ Ministers of the Crown,” or
the Vorkins set ? People at a distance, to whom
they are only names, can discern no real difference
between them. Let a person in Montreal, for in
stance, be told that Dibbs and his lot have just
been ejected from office in New South Wales, and
Robertson and his lot taken their places, what
does he care ? And no amount of explanation can
make him care a flg more about it than we should
if we were told that Chibbs, Premier of Canada,
had gone out, and Jobertbon, leader of the Op-
position, had come In. But let us hear from any
part of the world that an attempt had been made
by the men la power, egged on by the re-
presentatives of religious bigotry, to silence and
erush some prominent heretic, and that after a
year’s hard fighting the heretic had baffled and
beaten the would-be tyrants, and was holding
them up as a public laughing-stock, and our
sympathies are at once enlisted one way or the
other. If we be social fossils unacquainted with
the great movements of the modern world, or ;re-
ligious troglodytes dwelling in the dark caves of
ancient superstition?, we shall regret the heretic’s
triumph, and marvel at the mysterious ways of
our God; if wo bo lovers of freedom, students of
science, and full of faith in the possibilities of
human progress, we shall rejoice that persecutors
have been foiled, and an Intended victim become
victor. Anyway, the struggle would have a mean-
ing, and wo should take sides In It.
* * •
So Is it with Sykes’ battle. Leaving details for
those Immediately concerned, the broad facts of
the conflict will command attention everywhere.'
The struggle has been a double one, affecting cn
the one hand a free platform and, on the other, a
free Press. In both, the object of authority has
been the same—an attempt to prop up the Gospel
by tbe aid of the law. Symes, as a staunch believer
in Secularism, attacked the Gospel—attacked it
with argument and attacked it with ridicule, at the
same time proffering an open platform to whomso-
ever would come forward to defend it. One or two
shepherds of the flock ventured to debate with the
heretic, but their success was net overwhelming—
not sufficiently encouraging to induce a rush of
new champions. Thereupon the Government was
entreated—nay, commanded—by a section of the
clery and their followers and Press organs to pro-
secute, and, if possible, suppress. A musty Act
WBB dug out Of the depths of old-world tyranny,
and Symes was committed to take his trial as a
criminal charged with keeping a “disorderly
house.” People had come to listen to him of their
own free will—nay, had even paid at the doors to
enter—there had been no clang, clang, clang of a
great bell, to the annoyance of a peaceable neigh-
bourhood; there had been no beating of
drums in the streets, blare of trumpets and yel'.
leg of excited voices—the meeting had assembled,
heard, and dispersed as sedately as any fashion-
able concert audience. But Symb j had to stand In
tbe dookjof a Criminal Court—a Criminal Court
truly in this case—charged with keeping a dis-
orderly house. He defended himself, no jury
could be persuaded to convict, and when he pre-
sented himself to be tried a third time, he was in-
formed that the Government had given In, Htt
platform was free.
» * »
The Act under which bis newspaper, the
Liberator, was assailed Is one which has been
repealed in England as out of harmony with tbe
times, but is still In force—or rather we should
say unrepeaied—in some of the colonies. By its
provisions tbe publisher of a newspaper sold
for less than sixpence Is called upon to obtain
sureties for £6OO against the publication of bias,
phemy and sedition. The greater part of the
newspapers published in Victoria pay no atten-
tion to this Act, but Symes was singled out for
prosecution under it, and fined £36. Ho has been
esked to pay this sum, with costs, the whole
amounting to £136 10?. sd. He sends a laughing
reply, inviting bis perplexed persecutors to seize
his personal estate, which is less than that of a
bishop, or his carcase, if they have the courage to
cast him into prison. Meantime, the Liberator,
the property of a company, with limited liability,
continues its aggressive career, and has been
made the best advertised paper iu Australasia.
• • •
The moral of all this la that it Is about time the
Gospel and the Law parted company. The Gospel
Is either true or It is not true. If it be true. It can
stand attack and ridicule as easily as the system of
Copernicus or the Gravitation theory of Newton.
If it be not true, no persecution can help It which
stops short of the stake. It is childish to begin to
persecute a little, and only fools, or what is the
same thing, bigots in a passion, would suppose that
they could silence earnest men by anything short
of death. So trot out your Melbourne Inquisition
and Elemlngton Racecourse Auto-dii-fe, pious
Christians of the South, or else let Symes and hie
confreres have the same liberty to attack and
satirise you that you claim In dealing with him*

PLAIN ENGLISH.
At a Public Banquet.
AT a dinner given the other night to an unsuc-
cessful suburban Parliamentary candidate, a
bumptious young orator proposed the health
0 f the Legislative Assembly of New South
Wales in something like thv following fashion:
—“The grave duty with which I am en-
trusted has taken me quite unawares—[he’d
been stewing over it for a week]. I feel
I cannot do it justice, and trust you will
charitably overlook the shortcomings, of which
no one is more conscious than lam myself. I be-
lieve that the Parliament of Now South Wales
W UI compare favourably with any similar
body in the world, not even excepting
the Bouse of Commons. There is no doubt
that it contains tbe very cream of the
colony’s intellect. Would-be aristocrats affect
to think otherwise, end meet the statement with a
supercilious sneer. These pinchbeck representa-
tives of a moribund and rotten social system pre-
tend that outside tbe House are to be found men
of Intelligence and education who have never
made a political appeal to the people and are
never likely to do so. lam far from denying that
a few such may be found, but they are the exoep*
t lon. lam still convinced that at a full attendance
In that legislature which is tbe pride of this
country and the envy of all others, will be found
all that this great people can boast of dignity,
learning, and courtesy. There will be heard logic
which would strike a Burke or a Gladstone
with astonishment; polished repartee which would
gend a Sheridan or a Disraeli moodily home,
convinced that sarcasm, playful or pungent, had
left England for good and secured a firm footing
In New South Wales. On cur Statute Book will be
found laws of which Ltcurgus never dreamt -
edicts which surprise strangers with their compre-
hensiveness and humanity.” The lad poured out
a deal more of similar slush which was heard
high over the clinking of glasses and tbe buzz of
conversation. The young applauded, while the
middle-aged and elderly moodily drank undiluted
alcohol, and greedily applied themselves to the
dessert till beads of apprehensive perspiration
formed a network of tributaries on the caterer's
brow before merging into the main channels
g urglng af each side of his nose. We have'attendid
many sittings of the New South Wales Parliament,
looked over the Statute Book, and heard the racy
badinage of the Hite, We can only say that
If our members compare favourably with others,
representative government is doomed. If they
are the cream of the colony, the ordinary milk is
a highly attenuated fluid. Why, out of the whole
120 or so, there are not 20 who have even an ele-
mentary acquaintance with syntactical pecullarl-
tles-not 10 who can speak a few minutes without
making bizarre blunders in pronunciation or con-
struction. With tbe exception of a night spent at
a rustle tea-meeting, or at a country performance
by local Christy minstrels, we know of nothing
that equals In Inspired dulness the proceedings of
the "cream ” when an Important question Is being
harried—nothing that fills one with gloomier re-
grets that the Chinese tongue, or some aboriginal
dialect was not the only form of speech
With which he was acquainted. And the
Statute Book, tool Alasl There will bo found,
enacted with acclamation by the “ Intellect of the
colony,” laws which, It Is not too much to say,
would disgrace a tribe of Papuan head-hunters
Twenty-one crimes for which death la the penalty,
numberless offences for which torture can be
applied. Among the latter are misdemeanours
which, except In Australia, would be met by trifl-
ing fines or short imprisonments. Leaving out the
brutal legislation of early colonial days, we know
of no sadder recent record of man’s inhumanity to
man than the New South Wales Statute Book,
At the present moment.the colony possesses a more
scandalous penal code than any other civil sed
country in the world-bar none. The shadows of
the gallows and of the triangle rest upon It. For
shame, young man I Go take a year’s tour round
the world. If you come back with unaltered
views of New South Wales laws and legislators,
then, Indeed, Parliament will be your fitting place.

Federation Fiasco.
In Hobif r . 0a ° mee tinr of the Federal Council
Why gy I” Pvouilses to add one more to the reasons
befor. I*. aCouncil should not exist at all. It is
A «trai n ?« me * or 14 mlBflts Its time. It Is not
i* 111 DOr Australian. When, months ago,
W 45 a ß .i DER Btp art pointed out that Its title
fsnomcr, Its asscmpMon to be tbe Congress
of a Federal Australasia was somewhat less vain
than It la at present. Now New Zealand Is
away. On the mainland New South Wales
and South Australia are away. Dropping
the Crown colony of West Australis, which,
until Its people possess Constitutional Govern-
ment, cannot well be counted as an ally among
free States, tfco federating colonies on the
mainland represent a smaller extent of territory
and a smaller aggregate population than those
whieh stand aloof. A short time ago the isolation
of New South Wales was not supposed to stultify
the pretentions of the Federalists. It was pointed
out that one colour, with a tenth of the total area
and a third of the total population, could not, if it
chose to sulk, block the way of the others. New
South Wales wes then the tail of the dog. But a
metamorphosis has taken place. Oa the basis of
territory and population the non-Federallsta are
now the dog and the others the tail. Victorian ad-
vocates for Federation receive back on their own
heads the arguments with wh’ch they tried to
break the head of New South Wa'es. But the
metamorphosis effected from the outside does not
destroy more of the pretentions of the Council
than the decay that has been going on in the
1 Inside. The cnly powerful colony to be represented
at Hobart Is Victoria. But the cardinal sentiment
which actuated the Victorias people throughout
the discussion of the question was that wherever
and whenever the Council met the colony’s repre-
sentatives should be men responsible to Parlia-
ment for their actions. Now, neither Mr. Service
nor Mr. Berry will be responsible when the
Council meets. Neither intends to meet Parlia-
ment again. This negatives the primary condition
on which the Victorian Parliament asd people
assented to be represented. The irreeponslnliity
of Messrs. Service and Berry vitiates therefore
the representative character of their presence.
But this vice will permeate the proceedings. If
In so small a Congress, the two most prominent
men be unreal representatives, will not the
general aspect of the meeting he one of unreality ?
It would be bettor if the present pretence at
Federation, wh'eh had Its beginning in tail-talk,
and which reveals a new weakness every steps It
takes, would summarily extinguish itself, and
leave room for the consideration of a scheme
adapted to the requirements of Australasia as a
whole.

Masters of Thought
At the laying of the foundation-stone of the
Warden’s Lodge, at St. Patti/s College, Sydney,
some remarkable speeches were made. That by
Bishop Barry contains statements which will be
nows to many. Among others is the following:—
“There is not in this University, as at Oxford and
Cambridge, a theological tauulty which shall press
into its service, as has been done there, the real
masters of human thought. Too re is not her® a
University Church, which shall gather an academi-
cal audience. Sunday after Sunday, for the highest
religious and doctrinal teaching, and the reason of
that, I need hardly tell you, lies not In the preva-
lence here of really secular spirit (for in
u al f n u- G * • shal * not for a moment
believe), but It arises unhappily from what
we Christians must confess are the unhappy
rehgtous divisions which are the pernlexlfev
of our statesmen.” So we learn at last that
the “ real masters of human thought ” belong to
the theological faculties of the Oxford and Cam-
bridge Universities. Let us see. What additions
have they made to physical science ? None what-
ever. On the contrary, they spat buckets of
venom at the author of the ‘Origin of Species”
and his work—preached how noble it was to be-
lieve that man was fonred from a lump of mud.
and how base to suppose that he was but the last
link in an almost interminable chain. Have they not
had, over and over again, ts» retreat ignomialously
from the positions they took, trembling lest the
nextscientlflc discovery should destroy all their
carefully-planned outworks, and even knock
the citadel of sophistry about thoir ears?
If fighting tooth and nail against the teach-
ings of geology and in favour of the six
days of creation, showing pitiable Ignorance
and exhausting the vocabulary of abuse
In the Coeenso controversy, throwing every
obstacle they could find iu the way of that pro-
gress which threatens to brush them and their
sophisms aside, are nectsaary Ingredients in the
constitution of 4 master minds ” they may fairly
claim the title. Did they give us the "History of
Civilisation,” " Ssrtor Resartus,” “ European
Morals,” "Principles of Sociology,” “Conflictof
Religion and Science,” "Martyrdom of Man,” the
lives of Jesus and Mahomet, or any of the great
works which have changed the current of thought ?
Not they. They were too busy securing fat iiving B
by bolstering up absurd doctrines which taught
that an Omnipotent Creator was a bungling
mechanic who had to keep constantly patching
up a universe which He Himself made. The real
masters of human thought I Alas, if they were
blotted out and a wet - sponge passed over their
works, we would not to-day find men excluded
from Parliament oa account of their opinions, or
standing In felons’ docks In defence of liberty of
speech. No, Dr. Barry, you are really behind the
times. The secular spirit is abroad, and la now so
widespread that whether you or the " masters of
thought" believe in it or not dees not really
matter one lota.

Prominent Paupers.
In the countries where railways are under the
control of the Government there are two classes
of persons who occasionally receive free passes—
paupers and distinguished personages, A New
Zealand cable informs us that the Government of
that colony has granted Cardinal Moran the
special privilege of travelling free upon all rail-
ways in Maoriland. If this is to catch a
vote, the same courtesy has doubtless also
been extended to Bishop Barry. "Unto him
that bath much shall much b© given.” The
munificence of the Government in thus franking
ecclesiastical dignitaries and their suites over the
| railways of the colony is no doubt highly appre-
ciated by the recipients of the favour, but, at best
! lt; la doubtful compliment to those who are
comfortably able to pay their way. For most
certainly they are degraded to the position of
paupers when they travel at the cost of those
whose every pound of tea and sugar Is taxed to
provide free conveyance for "their pastors and
spiritual masters." The successor of St. Peter
when from his chariot in Rome he throws among
1 tbe shouting mob a few email copper coins, re-
peats the formula, “Silver aud gold have T none
but such as T have give I unto thee.” It may be|
therefore, that the dignitaries of the Churches are
actually too poor to pay the cost of travelling on
railways, aud are really bona fide mendicants
obliged to and willing to subsist on the public
charity.
When S r John Robertson supported the New
South Wales attempt to redden Itself with blood
in the Soudan, a section of the Sydney Press pro-
nounced him a thorough statesman, with the
qualities of chivalry and political insight pre_
eminently developed Sir John has now assumed
the position of a statesman, and claims to be the
possessor of a moderate share of political insight.
The two periods touch. That same section of the
Sydney Press now howls itself hoarse in denuncia-
tion of him as an 1 nbecl'e, a driveller, a black-
guard, and an idiot. Furthermore, it writes
oedi-g articles in very good English to prove
that its cor duct is in perfect accord with the
truest canons of j mrnal stio independence. What
toea, we aek, is journalistic vice, journalistic
time-serving, journalistic jugglery, journalistic
humbug ? Wnen Sir John calls the Sydney Prets
a mherable outcome of greed, ignorance, impu-
dence, and dishonesty ho 1«, as far as the section
that glcr.flsd him for his Soudan behaviour is
concerned, altogether within the mark.

For travelling without tickets on a tram-

imprisonment. New Zealand offers Cardinal
Moran exemption from paying fares on all the

one Indignantly asks, “ What haa this aldermanic,

In NS.W. ?” Wo don’t know. But, if it comes to
that, what has the other fellow done to justify it
either ?
Mr. Chamberlain, the English Radical
leader, is a member of the Unitarian body, to
Which his father and grandfather belonged before
him, and he was for years a Sunday-school teacher
in connection with the Church of the Messiah,
Birmingham. “No Unitarian,” wrote a leading
light of the Anglican Church in the London
Standard the other day, " can be a Christian.”
Here is the opening paragraph of a re-
cently-published “Life of William T. Stead”
“ It was flve-and-twenty years ago, in the grimy
little town of Howdon-on-Tyne—it was on the
‘ ballast-hill,’ the playground of the children—that
ahoy of 13 years old felled to the ground a boy
who had gone.to look at a girl who had turned
aside to tie up her garter. That boy has since be-
come the author of ‘The Maiden Tribute of
Modern Babylon.’ ”
Hoctor Gillbee was a well-known colonist,
an excellent surgeon, and one of the old identities
of Melbourne. He lived and died a bachelor, and
remembered all his friends in his will. The bulk
ol the MI.OOO he left was, however, given to his
sister, a maiden hut a year younger than himself-
The good lady enjoyed the fortune for exactly a
year after inheriting It. She passed away to what
spiritists call “the inner life ” on the 4th January,
on which day, a year before, her brother had
“ gone over to the majority.”
The Bulgarian army, which has been so
greatly distinguishing Itself against its supposedly
superior foes, Is, curiously enough, commanded
by mere youths. Thera is no officer In the field of
higher rank than that of major, and the senior of
these passed his first military examination as re-
cently as 1874. The commanding officer of the ar-
tillery brigade is only a captain, and passed into
the army in 1878, and the battalions and squadrons
are commanded by lieutenants and sub-lieu-
tenants. The oldest officer of the Bulgarian army
is only 35, and the remainder average about 37.
Prince Alexander, who has the chief command, is
only 38.

“Come and see bow an American can
fliel’’ the exclamation which came from Freeland
Morrell, as he ascended the scaffold at Melbourne
last week, is a cool speech for a murderer going
to his lest account. It has had its parallel, how-
ever, In many cases. Notably, in that of Thistle-
wood-the Cato-street;eonapirator. It was the in-
tention of this gentleman to turn out the
Government of the day in the summary manner
of blowing the Ministers up with gunpowder
while assembled at an Executive meeting. But
for the traitor who turned informer at the last
moment, the change of Government might have
been made as intended. Thistlewood mounted
the scaffold as firmly and as gaily as Freeland
Morrell. “ Come along,” he said to his more ner-
vous fellow-criminals, “ come along, wa [shall soon
know the grand secret.”
“ John , Esq., of Melbourne,” writes a
correspondent apropos of a paragraph in last
Bulletin, “was the inventor of suicide by super,
inducing an explosion of dynamite in his mouth
while in Northern Queensland. He was one of a
ring in Melbourne which was notorious for floating
“ bogus ” companies, but the most sinned against
that body of promoters, because of his truthful,
fess and bonhomie. The ‘ring,’ tried to shift
theil* responsibilities and their crimes upon a paid
elerk who, however, turned the tables upon them,
and before long afterwards one had escaped to
England under an assumed name; another was in
Pentridge for embezzlement; another was begging
from his would-be victim'in the streets of Sydney;
and the fourth, after making all the amends in his
tiower. which only, after all, amounted to verbiage,
had escaped remorse by exploding dynamite in
his mouth. Thus ‘ the whirligig of time brings
In his revenges.’ ”
Lieutenant-General Prendergast, whose

Added another dependency to the Queen’s do-
Snlons; Won hIS laurels In that fruitful field of
Suction—the Indian mutiny. He was several
fames wounded In the battles and sieges which
lh“n took place, but his conspicuous bravery
trained him rapid and deserved promotion. Sub-
Squently he commanded a detachment of three
Smlpanies of the Madras Sappers In the Abyssinian
wat The force under his command in the recent
Htutinese war amounted to 11,000 men of all arms,
And the expedition proved to be a mere military
hlchih. It is worthy of notice that the late terri-
torial appropriations of England have all tended
to deprive her of that Insularity which hitherto has
been her chief means of salvation. The acquisition
of Burmah brings England into direct contact with
China, and very adjacent to France, just as New
Guinea annexation and African appropriations
have made Germany the near neighbour of Eog-
land. It is passing strange that insular isolation
should be British policy in Europe, but that the
reverse should seem to bo her object abroad. We
give the General's portrait.
They all turn up again! There is no keep-
ing away from the colonies by those who have
once been in them. Those who drink of Nile
water thirst for it until they drink again, So it is
said, and is very likely true, for appetite is a “ fine
kitchen ” and Egypt is a thirsty land in which any
drink tastes delectable. We thought of these re-
turning colonists when meeting old Mat. Caution,

to be out again within ten years to sell another

his mission.
“Among the crowd of Australians who
are now risking a galloping consumption by win-
' tering in London ” (writes our London correspon-
dent) “I select T. C. Binny, Registrar of the Syd-

the fastnesses of South Kensington. I am told
that any Australian who wishes to see him must

little man with the eye-glasses I), who contrives to

Members out of Parliament need looking
up at times. We came across Longmore last week
—Longmore, Minister of Lands in the Berry Ad-
ministration. With his two sons, he has now a
three-block selection on the Tar win River. Away
from politics, this Gincinatus is here at his farm
fattening cattle for the butchers. Passing down-
wards, we came upon Cleeland, the winner of the
Melbourne Cup with Wollomai, and for long mine
host of the Albion, in Bourke-street. He is now
the freeholder of 8500 acres on Phillip Island, there
growing sheep and wool, and parchment and
horses, and a young family to boot. He said he
was happy, and he looked so. Longmore said that
he was happy too, and got to bed earlier than he
did when at the talking shop. Vale was also
stumbled upon by us the other day. Retired from
Parliament and the Attorney-Generalship, the good
man is building a row of stores between the
Yarraandthe Sandridge Road. It was pleasant
to us to see these popular people, long lost to the
public eye, so “ improving the shining hours.”
Writing of the decadence of the Stuart
Ministry in New South Wales, The CoiiONiES
and India observes that it “was internally
weakened by the severe illness of Sir Alexander
Stuart, who suffers from paralysis, and the desire
of the Attorney-General, the Hon. W. B. Dailey, to
take a trip to Europe and enjoy some of the kudos
which he considers he has merited for his patriotic
conduct in sending the New South Wales Con-
tingent to the Soudan.” Well, we don’t see why
Billy shouldn’t start forthwith. Kudos, eh ? Little
things please little minds. Ho could depend upon
Henniker-Heaton “ and slch ” to get up a banquet
for him, and he might succeed in being made the
first colonial peer, with the title of Lord Plainbill,
of the Soudan. A brand new coat-of-arms could
bo concocted for him by the Heralds’ College, with
the Soudan Donkey and Soudan Goat for sup-
porters. Bill would not feel such a coat-of-arms
quite strange to him. He had a lot of donkeys
for supporters all the time. The Heraldic people
would, of course, provide Bill with a pedigree,
passing over the eld sailor’s crimp, and starting
fair with a descent from William the Conkeror,
although, if the truth be told, our dentist is a man
of good extraction compared with Plain Bill.
Zelt, a comedian who had built up for
himself a certain reputation on the banks of the
Danube, recently died at Presburg, leaving a
mountain of billets doux, numbering some 5000,
733 medallion lockets, with as many locks of hair,
410 portraits, 313 scarf pins, and innumerable shirt
studs. Let us see, Yerdi—Green William—ls not
dead. Hum—how many locks of hair will he leave
and how many billets doux ? Zelt’s is probably a
“ best on record,” and the evergreen William will
have to get to work to mash the score.—
Say, Signor Billgreeno,
You now know what we know,
That Zelt was the champion
Masher—he’s dead.
Well, William, old party,
You're still hale and hearty,
Just take care you're ahead,
When your record is read ;
Pxve thousand of billets
Prom sweet little fillies
Takes beating, eh I William.
One moment, sweet Will,
If you can’t win on woman
We’ll bet you that no man
Can beat you by much
In the matter of “ bill.”
A strong point, such as is never made by
the conventional daily paper, is taken by the
Tumiti and Adelong Times:— “ We recently pub-
lished an account of the indignities Mr. Stead,
editor of the Pale Mall Gazette, was subjected
to in Coldbath Fields prison ere the voice of an
ineens ed public procured for him the treatment of
a first-class misdemeanant. Strangely does the
treatment meted out to the Pall Mall editor
contrast with that accorded to Col. Valentine
Baker, who in 1875 was convicted of a grossly
aggravated assault upon a young lady in a railway
carriage. The Morning Post of that date shows
that Colonel Baker was not annoyed by coming in
contact with other prisoners. He was allowed
to wear his own clothes, buy his own food,
furnish his own rooms, and have wine and malt
liquor at his own cost. He was not required to do
any work, and a prison official was appointed to do
all the menial duties of his apartments. He was
permitted to have books and newspapers and to
receive visits from his friends between 9 a.m. and
6 p.m. Can we wonder at the indignation and
anger of the masses at such gross official blunder-
ing, or at the fierce denunciation of ‘the powers
that be ’ expressed by journals which profess to be
written in the interests of the people.” It is im-
possible to resist the conclusion that Mr. Stead
was prosecuted in the interests of the aristocratic
caste.
Many years ago, in the days when mining
excitement at Woods’ Point was at its height and
penniless men scouring the ranges, one day dis-
covered reefs which the next day made them
wealthy, and turned them in £60,000 and
£lOO,OOO within a twelvemonth, the Mining
Department gazetted a warden to the field
who had an easy rough-and-ready method of
settling some of the numerous disputes daily
brought before him. On several occasions he de-
cided that neither of the litigants was entitled to
the claim in dispute, but that It was open to be
pegged out afresh. Which meant, of comae, tbatithe
first man who could get his four four-by-four-Inch
pegs in secured the prize. The first time this learned
magistrate made such a decision of course every
man rushed to the spot, and on one occasion, when
there was a dispute on about a valuable piece of
ground some twelve or fourteen mllei distant, the
best blood in the district stood saddled round
the court house fence, ready to be mounted when
the flat came. And come it did, when old and
young, rich and poor, heavy and light, flung
themselves upon their horses and sped away across
country for the glittering ttake, which this time
fell to the lot of a well-known Israelite, a brilliant
pianist, who has since been for many years a pro-
minent member of the Victorian Ring, and who,
if rumour is correct, has relations who have since
been connected with Royalty. Now a Cornishman
whose luck had been much against him ruminated
considerably over this warden’s queer decisions,
and, on the next notice of an important dispute
reaching him, he carfully provided himself with
pegs of regulation size and, repairing to theground
from whence he had a good view of the surround-
ing country, sat himself down and lit his pipe.
Quietlyhe waited as'the hours went by. Towards the
wane of day he was rewarded. Over the distant hill
he descries two men riding for their lives. He is up
in a moment. At each corner lies a peg; to drive
them in is, perhaps, the work of five minutes, and
as he hammers home the last one, up ride the two
chagrined contestants who have had a neck and
neck race for the last mile, and have agreed to
divide. The lucky possessor was well rewarded t
as the ground turned out one of the richest claims
in the locality, and is being worked to this very
day.
With respect to Captain Sorensen and the
seizure of his vessel, Lieutenant Armit, R.N,, the
New Guinea explorer, writes us from Cooktown:
“ Would you believe it 7 I dined with the Corsair
to-day—areal live pirate, and no mistake. One that
Tryon’s old barges couldn’t sweep off the seas, and
who, therefore, magnanimously came here to give
himself up to our outraged laws. He cast anchor
off the port, and then landed to send a wire to his
beloved down in Sydney. This was a chance for
the myrmidons of the law. A posse of police and
Customs men pulled out under cover of darkness,
surprised the bloodthirsty crew, and made the
vessel their very own. Then the pirate’s crew
had to heave up the mud-hook, and the pilot
brought in the prize. It was a glorious deed,
worthy of the days of Nelson, Drake, or Captain
Corcoran. Ihe arms were piled up in the gang-
ways and sent on shore by the excited victors, and
then the bold Corsair went on board, and—turned
in. Next morning—that is, this morning—the gory
hero of the walk-the-plank business hoisted his
flags, the Portugee at the main, the Danish at the
fore. ‘Down with that flag,’ roared the indig-
nant Cumstoms’ boss. ‘Pull it down yersel,’
quoth the gory one. ‘ You’d better pull it down,’
insinuated Customs No. 2. ‘l’ll be condemned if
I do,’ yelled the Corsair. ‘Holst the British
ensign,’squealed the Customs’ boss. ‘Nary flag,’
said the wizen-cutter, taking a good look at the
infuriated official on the wharf through the bot-
tom of a beer-glass half full of yellow liquid. Off
posted the magnate and returned breathless, bear-
ing aloft a flag as large as a kid’s pockethandher-
chie and quite as dirty. * Hoist,’ he yelled, hand-
ing it to his subaltern. ‘Yahl’ laughed the
butcher. The police interfered, and hauled down
the arms of Portugal, sending up the flag that
braved a thousand years. ‘You’ve done it now,’said
the pirate, ‘you’ve insulted the Portugese flag.’ ‘We
ain’t,’ cried the posse ‘ your ship’s seized.’ ‘ The
deuce it is I Why didn’t you say so before ? ’ says
he of the deaths-head. ‘You’re a piratel’ ex-
claimed the army and navy in a breath. ‘ls that
so ? Then I’ll go for a stroll. Ta, ta, boys; enjoy
yourselves on board with the monkey,’ and so
saying, he stepped into his boat and landed. That’s
how I met him. We kissed the baby, and thea
changed our breath. He was very communica-
tive, had a cargo of spoil gathered in the Western
Pacific—pearl-shell, beche de mer, cocoanut oil,
copra, and tortoise-shell, £4OOO worth. But our
pirate enjoys being called a buccaneer. He
couldn’t find a man-o’-war anywhere. Waited
specially for one, but it didn’t come, and so we
captured him. All that yarn about shooting
natives, stealing copra and shell is a pure inven-
tion.”
Tire Pall Mall Gazette, in announcing
the result of the recent Canterbury election, says!
—‘‘Mr. Henniker Heaton comes from the class
which makes the best members of Parliament. He
has been a journalist, though only in Australis,
whither he went in the days of his hot youth to
cultivate land. He first saw light at Rochester,
and was educated at King’s College, London. In a
political sense, Mr. Heaton is still a stripling,
having seen but 36 summers. He has officially re-
presented New South Wales and Tasmania on
several occasions, and married an Australian
lady.” The Times enlightens its readers as fol-
lows:—“ Heaton, J. H. (Canterbury).—Mr. John
Henniker Heaton (Conservative) 1s a son of the
late Lieutenant-Colonel Heaton. He was born in
1848 at Rochester, and educated at Kent-house
Grammar School and King’s College, London.
Early in life Mr. Heaton went to Australia and
purchased some extensive tracts of land in N.S/W,
and Queensland. He then engaged himself in jour-
nalism, and published ‘ The Australian Dictionary
of Dates and Men of the Time.’ In 1883, Mr. Heaton
was appointed by the Government of N.S.W. Com-
missioner at the Amsterdam Exhibition, and for
his services he received the thanks of that Govern-
ment. He also represented the Government of
Tasmania at the Berlin International Telegraph!®
Conference, in 1883, at which fie obtained valuable
concessions for the colony. He married, in
the only daughter of the late Mr. Samuel Bennett
of Mundarrah Towers, N.S.W.” “ Purchased some
extensive tracts of land,” is good; so is “the lat®

first reads better than “ was tutor to a Riverine

was far superior to “ Sim Bennett, a shrewd ol«
man who passed his earlier years as a composite®
in the office of the S. M. Herald.” Yet, these
truths are really things to be proud—not

POPE’S PIN .
The undeserving and cynical Bohemian who has
never, in commercial phrase, “ consolidated his
position ” by adding up weekly savings in a build,
ing society, cautiously speculating in suburban
land, teaching at Sunday School, marrying into
a rich family, and ultimately attaining the status
of a deacon and a member of the Legislature—and
who* consequently, finds himself all through life
fighting without allies and playing a lone hand—is
apt to sneer at lavish adulation of the sort so often
splashed about at convivial gatherings held in
honour of some departing colonist who has labori-
ously built up a splendid fortune, and la going
to the old country to take his ease. The Bohe_
mlan’s contempt for the plentiful commodity in
question may be partly due to envy, but it is
nevertheless based on a well-founded contempt
for that weakness of human nature which almost
invariably prompts financially successful men to
form themselves into Mutual Admiration societies
just as it incites small dogs to proWl found and
sniff respectfully while the big dog gnaws the
bone he has succeeded in annexing from the un-
wary butcher. We do not make these remarks
with especial reference to the farewell picnic
given to Mr. John Pope, of Parmer and Company,
Sydney, at Chowder Bay on Thursday last? but, as
the names of so many of the powerful phalanx of
business men who attended to do honour to them-
selves and the well-esteemed Mr. Pope (ex-Trea-
surer, by the way, of the bogus “ Patriotic Fund ”)
are constantly appearing in connection with such
affairs, one feels tempted to let them see just for
once in a way how the Guest’s-autobiography-and-
we-are-all-jolly-good-fellows business looks from
a'dyepeptic point of view.
“Captain Broomfield (we quote from a daily
paper), in proposing *Our Guest,’ spoke of Mr.
Pope in highly eulogistic terms, referring to that
gentleman’s connection with various charitable
institutions and philanthropic movements. Three
things especially stamped Mr. Pope’s character.
He was thoroughly loyal to the throne of Eng-
land, and on occasions when something, had been
said against her Majesty, he was the first to speak
out. He was loyal to his Church, and loyal to
his own family. These were three things that
stamped a man’s character, and when a man had
these three qualities', one might be sure that
everything else followed suit. A man true to
those three qualities was true to all the rest.
(Applause.) His loyalty to his Church had been
proved by his giving a site for the Ashfleld church.
(Hear, hear.) As to his business habits everybody
knew that he had put a standing-mark at the cor-
ner of Pitt and Market streets, the goodwill of
his fellow-citizens having enabled him to do
what he had accomplished. He was now going to
England, not for his own pleasure, but to benefit
the health of his family—(hear, hear)—and
everybody hoped the trip would prove exceed-
ingly beneficial to him and all of them, (Ap-
plause).”
It must have been a speech exactly like Captain
Broomfield’s which prompted Marcus Clarke a few
years ago to discourse thusi—
“Business men are the cream of the social bowl-
in their own estimation. The stone pillars, which,
according to the Arabic legend, hold the world up
There never was, or can be, anything to equal
them. You may be the best fellow in the world,
the sole support of an aged mother, and the pro-
tector of a whole boarding-school full of orphan
sisters. You may work like ahorse, and give all
your goods to feed the poor, but if you are not a
Business Man you are sounding brass or a tinkling
cymbal. To be a Business Man is a special gift—a
sort of inherent virtue, like a cast in the eye. If
you are a Business Man you will succeed in busi-
ness—that is to say, you will be a good husband, a
fond father, a conscientious Christian, always vote
with the Government, and when you die you will
go straight to Heaven, If you are a Business
Man people will shout for you, the papers will
write you up, and your friends will give you
prayer-books With gilt edges.”

Captain Broomfield, it will be observed, tells us
that no man who is not loyal to a Throne or to a
certain set of parsons can be a decent and respect-
able person. Those who are Republicans in senti-
ment will, no doubt, accept with becoming hu-
mility the decree of social ostracism which comes
from so distinguished a source; and those of our
American brethren whose fathers fought for
Liberty in the Revolutionary war will, instead of
honouring their ancestors as heretofore, set
those misguided persons down not as patriots, but
as brazen, traitorous ruffians who dared to deny to
his sacred Majesty George 111. a loyalty which the
Almighty had authorised that glorious pig-
headed German monarch to demand froth the
Yankees. Mr. Pope told the assembled company
the story of his career:—
“ He had come to Australia 31 years ago. When
he came he was a poor boy. He came to Victoria,
and went on the diggings, where he soon got £lOOO
worth of gold, but, having spent all that, he found
himself a poor young man. (Laughter.) How-
ever, he got some more gold and went to N.Z.,
where he obtained some timber and sent it to
Melbourne, and it was sold on his account, but hs
never got the proceeds. He went back to Mel-
bourne but did not like it, and came round to
Sydney in the steamer Wonga Wonga 30 years
ago. He lost his hat coming up the harbour, and
landed in Sydney without his hat, and without a
penny of his own in the world. (Lsugoter and
applause.) A fellow passenger offered him a bed
in hia house at Newtown, but he had a companion,
and resolved that they would walk about the
streets till daylight, and he found his first night’s
repose in Sydney on an old seat in the park oppo-
site St. Mary’s. (Applause.) He had already
learned various occupations, but now thought it
better to try his old business of a draper. In that
capacity he was known as John Pope, ‘L.D.’—
Linen Draper. (Loud laughter and applause.) He
had shipped as that at Liverpool, and landed so at
Sydney. He went down to the establishment of
Farmer, Williams, and Giles, and had an interview
with Mr. Giles, who engaged the hands. Mr. Giles
said, ‘ You are not a draper, are you?’ He held
his cabbage-tree hat in his hand, and replied that
he was. Mr. Giles told him they did not want any
hands just then, and he replied, ‘I will wait till
you do.’ He went out, and as he did so he picked
up a pin. A young man came after him and
brought him back to Mr. Giles, who said, ‘ If you
are a draper, you can come on at £3 a week on
Monday morning.’ He accepted the position, and,
to the ladles and gentlemen who had known him
since he held that junior situation, he had to offer
his warmest thanks for his present position.”
There, now I The same dear old familiar story.
How many times have we heard It before? It was
originally told of Lafltte, the Parisian banker,
who, like the political party to whom Mr, Pope aad
a lot of his friends belong, always worshipped con-
stituted authority—who was always “ loyal to the
Throne ” (as Captain Broomfield says), or, in the
words of Clark©, “ always voted with the Govern-
ment.” Lafi.te rose from obscurity, s-;nd his first
start dated from the time h<j picked up a pin,” i
He became banker to Louis XVIIL, but as he “was
loyal to the Throne,” and “always voted with the
Government,” he afterwards became banker (and
subsequently executor to) Napoleon, by whom
the King was supplanted. It is wonderful how
many of the great men of the world commence by
picking up unoonsidered trifles belonging to other
people. Wilson Barrett, the London actor, “picked
up sixpence,” Parkes picked up sixpence, and
John Pope picked up a pin, despite Dr. Watts:—
“ It is a sin to lift a pin,
Much more,” &o.
Judging from their subsequent careers, Parke s’
sixpence must have been a crooked (or an alto-
gether bad) one, while Pope’s pin was indubitably
straight.
Mr. Joseph. Chamberlain M. P.
This statesman, whose portrait appears on our
front page, is at the present time the foremost
figure in the arena of English politics. Although
rot a Minister, his speeches are of more interest
even than those of the Premier, or ths accredited
Liberal leader, Mr. Gladstone himself. Mr. Cham-
berlain is now 49 years of age, having been born
in the end of 1836. In 1854 he entered the service
of a firm of wood-screw makers, of which his lather
was a partnef, at Birmingham. To this part-
nership he subsequently acceded, but retired from
business in 1874, and devoted himself to political
life. His first bid for membership was at Sheffield,
when he opposed, and was defeated by Mr. Roe-
buck, but two years later he succeeded in
gaining a seat for Birmingham. His chief
legislative success has been the Bankruptcy
Bill, which he passed through the House while
President of tEe Board of Trade in Mr. Gladstone's
Ministry. Throughout his career Mr. Chamber-
lain has persistently urge® the Disestablishment
of the Church of England, and the application of
the revenue obtained thereby to a comprehensive
system of free education. By doing so he has
made himself hated and feared by the Tories, who
have, however, usually sought to discredit the
speaker rather than to disprove his facts. In the
not unlikely event of the retirement of Mr, Glad-
stone, Mr. Chamberlain will certainly be leader of
the advanced Liberal party, for it is impossible
that its members will commit themselves to the
care of the opportunist Liberal, the Marquis of
Hartington. Nothing seems more likely than
that the present Liberals will be the future
Radicals, just as in their efforts to “dish the
Whigs,” the Tories of yesterday are in effect
Liberals to-day. Last week we showed the
eclipse of Gladstone by Chamberlain, an eclipse
which is daily becoming more plainly discernible.
The situation is almost pathetic in its interest.
Mr. Gladstone is too old and too timorous to lead
the young party, who exceed Mm as much in the
extremes they are anxious to reach, as they are
superior to him in physical ability. The Grand
Old Man has fought nobly for the cause in his day,
taut must soon yield to another who is ready to
carry on the attack with greater vigour. Glad-
stone is the exponent of the departing and Cham-
berlain the leader of the coming generation of re-
formers. As an orator, Mr. Chamberlain is fluent
of language, concise and clear in his argu-
ment, and vigorous in expression. Nearly all the
important issues debated during the recent Eng-
lish election campaign owed their origin to Mm,
and the coming leaders, Chamberlain and Churc-
hill, rather than Salisbury and Gladstone, have
been the respective champions, As showing the
popularity of Mr, Chamberlain, it is alleged that a
London schoolmistress made her pupils learn some
of his speeches by heart. Of course, there was an
outcry at this, and much vigorous newspaper cor-
respondence, but the “ lady principal ” was wise
in her generation; she knew that Chamberlain
had enough wealthy admirers to make the ad. a
source of much wealth to herself. Although both
hated and feared by Ms opponents, Mr. Chamber-
lain, even by them, is admitted to have a deep and
active sympathy with suffering humanity, a sym-
pathy which furnishes the motive of his political
actions.
Extrac t from a long letter received by a
North Queenslander, now In Sydney;—“Coming
up from the Flinders I had a very hard time of it on
account ef the drought, and lost a good many
house, but I managed to get on a patch of green
grass at , where I spelled for a week, and
found a game of black-gin stealing in progress (to
vary the monotony of the drought, I suppose, as
there was nothing: else to be dor e). ——, of one
station, steals the gin of his neighbour , and
the latter ‘shakes’ her back ag in. Then she is
recovered by the first-named IniLVidual, and now
she is under lock and key at nights. One would
think she would be a charmer after all that
trouble, but she is as ugly as a German baboon.
Both these shakesta are married men, and J.’sP.,
but the wives are away from home just now.
There will be some hair-tearing when they come
back. At each station I passs i on my travels
there is a regular harem of young and middle-
aged gins kept, and thought more of than white
women. Wonderful country thl; North Kennedy.”
Thus does civilisation majestically stalk along in
the torrid North.
When Judges fall out honest men some-
times aet out. This happened 1 tely at Invercar-
gill, N.Z, where Mr. Michael Crow had been in-
carcerated without trial by D Wrict Judge Ward i
for alleged fraudulent insolvc; ey. Some time
ago the same Judge sent another bankrupt before
Resident Magistrate M'Culloch l r prosecution on
a like charge. The RM. dlsmis d the case on the
ground that a debtor could not be prosecuted on
evidence given by himself. This warmed old
Ward up “some,” and he very soon hauled the
R.M. rather roughly over the coals for it. Mao,
however, was game to the b ckbone, and next
time he got perched on the Bench he crowed back
defiantly in reply. Then an her Crow turned
up. This was Michael, i ichael had filed
his little deficiency, and was hopping his
way through the Insolvency Court all right
when Judge Ward, alleging something in his
schedule, sent him to gaol for t ,rss months with-
out troubling the magistrate in the matter—a
clean case of hitting two birds, Crow and Mac,
with one stone. But Crow was not so easily
roosted, The rookery was roured, and flew to his
assistance with one accord. A writ of habeas
corpus was applied for before a Supreme Court
Judge, who decided that the action of the District
Judge was illegal. The late incarcerated Crow is
consequently once more a free bird, and spent
Christmas in the family nest, surrounded by all
the little squabs. And all the little chicks said,
“ Caw, caw, caw I District Judge Ward, caw, caw,
caw,” between every bill-ful of the Christmas
pudding.
A Northern reader hailing from Maokay
(Queensland), writes:—“ln your issue of Novem-
ber 31, page 10, I notice a paragraph containing
lines, ‘My last note,’ written, so you say, by
‘ some cheerful soul evidently contemplating
suicide ’ If lam not in error, the cheerful soul
suicided about 15 years ago in South Australia,
and an account of his death appeared in the
S A. Register of March 31, and in his pocket were
these lines:
“ ‘ From this world, so worn and weary,,
From this inn a broken guest.
Prom its chambers, blat k, unoheery,
I depart, I hope to rest.
“ ‘ I’m no ties of friendship leaving,
No, not e’en a mistress dear;
There’s not one that I’m bereaving—
All alone I linger here.’
“ The next three verses run nearly as you give
them.—‘Nearly peering through the portal,’and
so on; but, insofar as they have been altered, the
suicide’s reputation has suffered. He was named
John Clark, and his body was found on the sand-
hills near the Pilot Station, Adelaide, and beside it
a bottle half full of laudanum, a glass, and a red
pipe. Besides the lines I have mentioned, he left
on paper sundry reflections in this wise;— ‘ I was
about to say friendship, but I remembered I never
had any friends but when 1 had money, so X think
the alteration is just, , , . as for my own
ft® other slde » tfa at Is strictly my
97 fn ? da . r ! T?t any gentleman has anything to

At ft? annual meeting of the committee

I “® ec^ nd J lDB ‘..ft e adoption of the balance-sheets
K d Where else In the colony could a
similar body be found able to make such hand—
yearly donations to charities and institutions
as the Alexandra Amateur Dramatic Club ? I ven-
cure to say in no other township in the colony#
The local club possessed talent which could not be
equalled outside of Melbourne.” We quite be-
lieve this. Indeed, in some things the talents
possessed by the Alexandra amateurs could not bo
excelled in the colony—including Melbourne—
Professionals. The thorough manner
with which these reckless Bohemians would seize
all the telling points in “ Box and Cox ” or “ The
“app/ Man” showed the possession of talents of
a kind which deserved a wider field of action than
was obtainable in a public-house barn, with a
truss of hay covered by a horse-cloth for a bridal
bed and three farm labourers armed with hoes for
a guard of honour. And the way too they took
possession of the bar when the play was over till
nothing but sarsaparilla and tonic water remained
on the premises, showed that their accomplish-
ments were not confined to hlstrionism but
branched out in various directions. Still, while we
cannot but admire the high position secured by the
Alexandra stage—it was mostly in a loft—we think
that theatricals in Sandhurst occupied almost
as high a plane. It makes us young again to think
of the nights when, employed as ticket-taker, we
passed in most of our friends on 1.0.U.S (still in
our possession), and then slipped into the orches-
tra to manipulate the cymbals and triangle. Be-
fore us in the circle were all Bendigo’s men of
“ light and leading,” with the creme of Eaglehawk,
Golden Square, Dead Dog Gully, and Jackass
Flat. There were to be seen the queens of Sand-
hurst society making the air musical with the
piquant badinage and racy raillery in which they
revelled lang syne while conveying the “old
man’s ” dinner to the claim or taking a turn at
the windlass. And on the stage were either a band
of minstrels whose united mouths would encom-
pass an iceberg or a batch of amateurs—cadets >
the first families—whose virulent hostility towards
the English language found vent in scorn like
this:—
First Amateur: “Air you the Dook V’
Second A.: “I ham the Dook,”
First A. (fiercely): Koward 1 Were is my darter?”
Second A. (defiantly): "Minyon. The dams’!
you calls yer chee-i-ld no longer fears yer onnat’-
ralhenmlty. (Aside) ’O sv can I dissemble ? (Aloud)
My kerridge waits— adoo."
Yes. Take them all round, we would back the
Bendigo amateurs against those of. Alexandra.
There may be some little points in the “heavy
father”and“outraged female” lines where the
Alexandra lads have a slight advantage, but, for
allround capacity, combined with fierce ioono-
clastn, give us the Bendigo boys.

Miss Osborn© does not Ida vocal light un-
der a bushel, and even the gallery gamins- not
generally connoisseurs of music, yell for an
“ angoore.” Fanny Sirony improves as she per-
forms better, and this latter contingency happens
with every representation. On Monday night,
While Emily Fox was Binging, “lameo shy.” she
suddenly discovered that bashfulness was not the
ofltf thing that troubled her, for, with a we-shall-
ali-meet in-Reaven expression, she incontinently
fainted to a qu&si-orcht stral accompaniment of
sympathetic sobs from every part of the house.
We have sometimes ventured to hint that Emily
was too prodigal of her imiles, and alleged that
it was not natural for a lady to put on that
heavenly expression when she fainted. Now,
when she subsides involuntaiiiy, we have seen
that it is natural—for Mies Emily if ox.

One of the most comic scenes in the entire
pant, is the appearance of the ancient Briton
In the procession of the Centuries. She comes
slowly on clad in her long hair, a leopard-skin
pinafore, and two or three other things, but the
look of deep*seated and settled melancholy which
dwells Within her face makes the inquisitive
Observer to wondef whether.. she represents
Beadioea “ bleeding from the Roman rods, or
Whether Someone has stolen her woad-box (the
rouge-pot of the ancient Rritons), or, lastly,
Whether she has Just heard that Lloyd, M L.A., is
«Honorable within the Colony. There is also
anothel very comic scene when a lot of the

The Sydney Opera House directorate ha?
been taught a severe lesson by endeavouring to
inHiot” Across the Continent ” on its frequenters
Monday night’s attendance proved the lallacy of
flbslct pftoole with nonset .se» There were not
more than 20 persons in tho tircle.

“Across the Continent ” is a piece abound-
in battle, murder, and sudden death. There are
numbers of “situations” in the play. “Acrots

AS a piece worth seeing. It is hka that. But. it i

this production; It Would present to him a phase
in telegraphic advancement with which he is so far
unacquainted. The telegraph station is to ,be
attached by Indians, who, after cutting the wire,
judiciously clear out and allow the operator to
dteuatx’h a message for a tr in ioaded with troops
to tltura to h B assistance. The train arrives
within threb minutes of the dispatch of the wire -
a rate Of speed which transmission and reply have
not yet attained in this country*

BUt it is the manner of sending the tele-
gram which would double Edison up as completely
Mifhe had been hit in the chest with a paving-
stone When the operator discovers the wire has
been «ut be darts out with the instrument in his
hand, planks it on the head of an old cement bar-
rel, and, without any batteries to the machine, he
clicks at the rate of a thousand words a minute
hi meSsie for the troops. There are about six
troops and seven or eight redskins, and a fierce
and Woody fray takes place. Bach man as he Is
shot, scalped, or otherwise murdered, gets up and
leaves the stage to return in a moment from
anotner quarter of the battlefield in time for a
second round. This encounter is conducted under
Queensberry rules, four rounds and a draw. Draw
the curtain. # m
We cannot, with justice to the performers,
make special mention of any. When the Piece
produced is so w retchedly opposed to the possi-
bilities and so insultingly contrary to common-
sense dictates we cannot assoiiate the names of

The “Green Lanes of England” was the
item for the evening, and juoging by its enthusi-
astic reception, it is fair to lal* r that its run will
tea profitable one to the management. As the
piece has been played )a Australia several tlmqa
before it is not necessary to unfold the details of
thp business. The plot is as long as an attorney’s
bill of fterhs, and as comprehensive as a Wesleyan
parson’s Prayer. It Is a pleasing compound of
Bigamy and burglary, villainy and virtue,
treachery and terruth, mother’s love and murder,
but looks much less “ creepy ’ on paper than
when shown on the mirror of life. As Margaret
Wheatstone, the Innocent maiden, Miss Kemble
was borne on the sympathetic tide of auditorial
favour, and her lightest line woke their plaudits.
The Nelly of Mies Hetty Sherwood was a clever
Serfortaanoe. She was an “ off the stage child,
[r. Dampier, as Gfentlcjman George, was a charac-
ter of the virtuously vicious,Ascription which is
never met in life, and not often on the Stage. Hia
battle between the longing to expose Flint And his
partner In the robbery from old Wheatstone s
desk and his anxiety to get a drink of gin was
thoroughly appreciated by the audience, and iu is
not improbable that, on his next appear an c--,a
flask of the fluid may be lowered to him from the
gallery. On h's attempt to surprise the robbers.
Who had get in by the back window, the loud
Bhodts of. ‘'Sound tbla way, George,” “Hey, here

Boothman and Stark, as a pair of the vilest
of villains, were hissed to their hearts’ content, dnd
the delight of the audience was fully expressed in
the shouts from aloft of “ Pmg him, Selby, Put
the arm-look on him, Jones,” “ Pass him over this
way. Leston.” It Is probable that in front of the
footlights more than once during the evening Bill
and Flint would have spent an excessively bad ten
minutes. This tribute to the fidelity of their per-
formance was not undeserved. The Martin Wheat-
stone of Mr. Edmund Holloway was a finished per-
formance, and his pathos was pathetic throughout.
Stoneham s Frank Selby was the finest effort we
have yet had from him, Harry Leston made the
most, the vary most, of a small part-Gustavus
Jones—the only Jones, a taller. Miss Dampier
Smiles too much and too often, otherwise

"An Indian potentate, on a visit to Lord Dufferin, saw the Viceroy cutting his
newspapers. Asking for the ivory knife, the prlace promised to bring another in re-
turn. He came back in a few days with a young elephant, whose tusks had been
shaped and sharpened. The suimal, Which had been carefully trained in secretarial
work, was brought into Lord Dufferin's library, When it immed stely began picking
up newspapers with its trunk, and afer eatling them, laid them carefully in a pile on

finale to the first part, wherein are introduced
such musical instruments as never were seen
before, and never will be again. Harr Stomach-
ache, as the solo trombonist, has an instru-
ment which must make his —to manipu-
late. There is one defect on the part of the
audience, however, which discounts tha enjoy-
ment ot much of the business of the Academy,—
the applause is always very much too previous, it
Is a wonder that the audience is so short-sighted,
for it is half the joy of one of Amery's songs to
hear him climb to the highest pea>? la the range of
melody and sit straddle-legs across it. Ttrs bucolic
stupidity of prematurely applauding is confined
to an energetic few, but, it spoils the pleasure of
the many.

“Plain Bill and Black- 4 Hide’ Susan” is
string enough on Its lower limbs to run for a
month. It is interspersed with songs, of which
“ Once or T wica ”is a local ditty, and 'Wait till
we spit on our hands,” a ballad whose pathos
occasionally dives fathoms deep into the regions
of the sublime. A boy in white raiment, who
looks an inverted bead of celery, dances a good
hornpipe, and the busine s all through is just
about the antipodes of all that is rational, conven-
tional, or commonplace.

The following sum was worked out by the
District Court Judge after the holidays:—Plain-
tiff sells 16 cows, 9 steers, and 17 calves, at 90s. for
the cowe, 58s. for the steers, and 60s. 6d. for the
calves. Subsequently, the defendant agreed to
give “an average price all round.” Two attor-
neys and his Honor spent some part of a day at
the sum,'and eventually the disburser of even-
handed justice decided that unless the age of the
animals was specified in the indictment, the arith-
metical adjustment of the difficulty could not be
effected. Sutsequontly, his Honor decided that
an average was more difficult to strike than a
ghost, and the attorney on the defendant’s side
declding that an average was as erratic as a streak
of lightning, in that it could never be struck twice
in the same place, leave was granted to move for
a new trial. In the meantime, the figures as above
will be inserted in'the next matriculation papers,
and burners of the midnight kerosene will be re-
quired to solve the problem or be “ plucked.” An
average is like a woman— you are never sure when

The custom has generally obtained in the
Sydney law courts for the Herald man to occupy
the premier position at the reporters' desk, then
the Telegraph, and then the News. How this
came about would be difficult to say, as the Even-
ing News Is an older paper than the Daily Tele-
graph, and, again, publishes some ten hours
earlier than either of the morniog papers, so Its
reporter should have precedence of the junior
morning paper on one count, and of both on the
other. However, the point has never been raised
by them. Within the past few months, the Globs
has developed a reporting staff which carries
dissension into the hitherto placid ranks of
police court journalism, A few mornings ago the
Globe man at the Water Police Court, finding the
Herald chair vaomt, had the temerity to occupy
it, and scratched away pleasantly till a mighty
presence entered the court. It was the Hbbald
man. Rendered shortsighted by the immoderate
use of an eyeglass, the great man was all un-
conscious of the presence of the interloper till
within a few inches of him. Then he stood
aghast. Rallying with a great effort, he said,
with simple and touching dignity: “ Pardon me—
aw—may I trouble you for this seat ? I represent
—er—the Sydney Morning Hbbald.” “Sydney
Morning Grandmother,” was the Irreverent re-
sponse; “I was here first,” “Take me home,”
murmured the Hbuald man wearily when he
recovered consciousness; “oh, take me home.”
They took him home, but he sank rapidly, and Is
now (let us hope) playing a diamond-hilted trom-
bone—
“ Where Sam Cook has ceased from troubling,
And reporters are at rest.”

Asiatics compared to the giant breed that gorges

bedclothes and settle down to prospect for blood-
vessels. When they have laid their pumps and
exhausted you, their stomachs hold about two
quarts each, and they are merry. They merely
bore a few more holes in merriment, and with a
few playful kicks they move away with a Mar-
seillaise to make a night of it at the next bed. You
rise and out your throat, only to find there is no-
thing In your jugular to flow, and you inject some

The snake season being a remarkably dull
one up Townsville way this year, the enterprising
Journalists have had to fall hack on a shark, and
the tale of this shark runs thusly. Ho was 15 feet
no inches long, and, seeing a coral-flsher named
John Bishop skimming around, it occurred to
him that John would be a desirable article to haul
along and fatten up for Christmas. Accordingly,
just by way of putting an edge on his teeth, he
swam up, and bit a block out of John’s boat, just
as a Sunday-school scholar would take a chunk
out of a sour apple. Bishop hit his sharkship a
clout with a pole, and then began to pull for the
shore in a style that would make even Beach flap
his ears with wonder. The shark, however, was
the champion swimmer of his district, and
soon got so close to the boat that the scared
Bishop resolved to throw out all the loose articles
he had in order to divert his follower’s attention,
just as travellers in Russia fling everything out of
their sledges, from their brandy-flasks down to
tbelr babies, in order to cause a diversion amongst
the wolves. Three blocks of coral and a mainsail
were hoisted out first, but the shark took them
down as easily as a country schoolmaster would
plant a plate of corned beef and cabbage. An
empty keg went over next, and after giving it a
couple of shakes to ascertain if there was a “ nip ”
left, the disgusted monster rolled it down, and
oame along more furious than ever. An oilskin
suit and a coil of Manilla rope then gave the coral-
grabber a lead of 200yds., but the shark was soon
alongside again, and was only staved off by
another sail and a heap of fishing tackle. Finally,
the terrified-man got into shallow water, half
naked, and trompletely worn out, and the shark,
giving him a sort of sso-you-agaln-old-fellow
smile, swam slowly home to dinner. [This story,
although undoubtedly true, would be far more
instructive if it ended in tha correct orthodox
manner. The shark should be just about to spring
on Mr. Bishop, when that gentleman, suddenly
seizing his mother’s Bible, which he always carried
in the besom of hla shirt, ihrust it down the mon-
ster e threat, and had the i loasyre of see rg Urn
roll over and die on the spot. Thousands are an-
nually saved from the Jaws of debt by means of
their mothers’ Bibles. If anyone doubts this let
him look In at our pawnshop windows.]

The Sydney Liedertafel have serenaded
the Governor. The Loftus family, who recently left
us, were (according to Granny) great patrons of
music, yet we never heard of their being serenaded.
But then Gus was very careful of his poultry; the
broody fowls might have been prevented by the
noise from attending to the duties of incubation,
while the fat and susceptible ones might have been
induced while under the spell of the music to
leave the establishment. We believe our new
“ Guv ” la not a lover of poultry. We Imagine
he oarea as little for music. He looked the other
night as though he would have preferred to be
alone with a cigar. He is said, however, to be
tolerably familiar with the National Anthem, but
has been known to confound it with the Halle-
lujah Chorus, doubtless from the fact that some
audiences consider it a duty to stand when
either of these pieces is being performed.

Mr. Thurston, who officiated as foreman
of the jury at'Senior's inquest, remarked that a
section Of the Press had libelled the twelve free

wear collars. Why Thurston, who la a man of
more than average Intelligence, could not at once
■pot the spirit of envy which dictated the para-
graph we are at a loss to determine. The reporter
who wrote the article reflecting on the Jurors had
Just borrowed a collar, and, iu the fullness of his
heart at having a rim round his neck, he could not
refrain from guying the oollarless company, “It
IS not pleasant to wear collars this Weather, and
especially hi a hot room like this,” continued Mr.
Thurston in his remarks, after previously observ-
ing that he, “like Moses of old, was slow of
Speech.” By—Nebo’s lonely mountain—perhaps
he is Moses. There is no proof of his death. Hark,
the drum;—
Moses of old with the Lord twice held converse.
And Thurston quite modtstly mentions his
name.

Wandered collarless, shirtless (those Jews are a shy

Through the desert for many and many a year.

They were free In their love of the bush and the

But Thurston, old party, they dodged round the

Where Evening News people would •‘brevi-

For they never wore collars that emigrant party,
And dreaded a slating from blear-eyed young
men.

Would charge them on chances and post them
with pen.

A proposal wps made—and lost —at the
National Regatta Committee meeting 1 to the effect
that all sailing races should be opened to best and
best crews. Year after year we have advocated
that at the principal regatta of the year the pro-
fessionals should be given a ohanoe, but it seems
the amateurs are too strong on the committee.
Aquatic men who remember the contests between
such men as George Montgomery, George Bills.
Colebrook, Fletcher Newton, and others must
look with regret at the present state of things,
when it is the man, and not the boat, inmost cases,
wins the race. Messrs. Fitzhardlnge and Williams
have retired front the open-boat line, end Mr- Sid.

the difference “ handling ’* makes in a boat. Take
Mr. Fitzhardmge, for Instance; with the old yacht
Sybil, he won racrs ont of number, ss with the

a turnout of boata as on tho occasion when the
Lottie made her debut at the Balmain regatta The

run off on the following Bate may. The 24ft. and
23ft. and under boats were alike started at the same
time, the wind blowing from the southwest—the
worst gale, old hands declare,a race wasever sailed
in over Port Jackson before or since. A big fleet
of boats started: Montgomery in the Lottie, New-
ton in the Kingfisher, Ellis in the Duke, a 24-footer
turned out by Dunn, and Griffiths, we fancy, was
at the tiller of the 33-footer, Young Jim. Before
Bradley’s w«a negotiated nearly all the boats had
oome to grief. The Kingfisher, with only pleasure
suit on, carried away her mast; arhongst others
the Halcyon capsized and crowned a man, and the
field had narrowed down considerably by the time
the boats eased off their sheets for the run to the
Sow. Ellis, thinking “ discretion the better part,”
etc., ran into Chowder, and the only boats tc
round the Lightship were Lottie, a large boat
built and sailed by Gardiner—the name we forget
-and the Young Jim. “ Put the small jib on her,
and be blank smart about it I” yelled poor George
Montgomery, and the blanks that fell from his
lips were terrible to hear when It was discovered
the small jib had been left behind, and a knot had
to be tied In the big one. Hauled on a wind, their
troubles began. Gardiner just managed to make

We are sorry to hear the Glebe R.C. senior
crew for the National Regatta has been broken
up by reason of Mr. Georg© Robertson s desertion
of them for a seat in the Mercantile four. It is
thought the Glebe R.C. should not let their crew
fall through on this account, but as the Ever-
green ” very truly puts tbe case, ‘if the Mercan-
tile, which has been in existence the best portion
of a score, can’t raise a fourth senior without
Sammy Martin, bow can they expect the infant
G'ebltes to do so? ” It Is all very well for the
Glebites to make a cry out about Mr. Robertson s
desertion, but let them put themselves in his
place. Mr. Robertson’s show of winning with the
Glebe crew was meagre, we must say very meagre.
Should be win with the Mercantile, of which he is
at present stroke, bis chance of a trip to Melbourne
with the Intercolonial will bo great. Of course
some people will ■ay that it ihakea the change all
the more glaring as Mr. B. is one bf the oldest
members of the G.R.C., and formed one of the
trio to pick the four in which he was Included.
But some people are only too glad to pick upa
point which they think may aggravate a matter.
However, a rumour is now going the rounds that
after all Mr. Martin may stroke the Mercantile
crew at the National Regatta, and should he do so,
we have no doubt Mr. B. will willingly give uo his
thwart to Mr. Martin for the good of his club, or
rather, one of his clubs.

Sportsmen in Sydney will remember tile
last Foley-Wewton fight. On that occasion New-
ton drew out of the battle. ar*.d this in spite or the
fact that all preparations had b*en made for the
fight, which was to he under Queensberry rules,
with gloves to be approved by the police. A ring
had been prepared by Foley at a cost of £24, which
snm was subsequently refunded to him by a
couple of well-known sporting men. Subse-
quently to Newton’s withdrawn’, Foley met him
fa Smith’s piece, and, in consequence of some ugly
remarks made by a fancier of Newtons, Foley
slapped him In the face, and at once chal-
lenged Newton, who gave as his reason for with-
drawing from the fight his desire to fight
with bare knuckles. Newton again declining,
Foley promptly invited him out to the back to
fight for a skinful for nothing. The next arrange-
ment was for a fight at Botany, but the police
hearing of the affair put in an appearance in force,
and stated their Intention of stopping the fight.
Foley had been secreted finder tho seat of. Mt.
George ttiil’s buggy, and flndlrig it impossible to
bring the fight off he. after informing
backer and traimt of the presence of Larry,
offered to find a place where the men could
fight uninterruptedly. This was alio declined,
on the ground that Newton's backer had
now drawn his stake Then George Hill
offered to find the money for Newton, and
£3O each for his seconds. The police, act-
ing upon informal! n furnished them, again
stopped the fight. Foley at length succeeded in
getting a match on in Melbourne, where, after
battling with glass bottles, sticks, and more dan-
gerous weapons, and in the face of threats to
murder him If he beat Newton, in a battle with the
elements of larrikinism and ruffianism, be dropped
on to Peter once and knocked him out. After
this, in consideration of the difficulty he had in
d
getting on a match and the abuse he bad to put up
with, Foley was presented by a few admirers with
a cheque for £5O. Captain M Donald, la making
the presentation, remarked it was a pity that tne
sport should have been so degraded, but hoped
that the men who had helped to drag the manly
art in the mad, would live to eee the folly ot tutor
deeds. Lovers of true sport, whether resident in

McDonald’s sentiments. Foley is now Prepared to

LARKS AT LARRY'S.
At Foley’s rooms, in George-street, Sydney,
the other night, there was a good muster to wit-
ness the wrestling match between Oansdell and
M'Caffery, the Californian, for £5O a-slde. The
turn-up was looked upon by those “in the know'* as
a soft thing for the stars and bars, and 2 to 1 on
the foreigner was easily obtained. After the first

fall to M‘Caffery’B credit 6 to 4 was the best money
offered, and when Oansdell was tipped and the
•cores equalled even money was the market value
•f either man. Young Stewart and M'Kenna put
the mittens on for a merry rally to open the ball,
and in a smart three rounds spiel showed good
play. We are particularly partial to this branch of
athletics, and there is probably nothing which de-
lights us more than a buck in with the pads on.

We do not think so much of the game when
the other man bashes us, but that is pro-
bably because the fun is unevenly distributed.
When McKenna and Stewart retired for repairs
the doors of the arena were thrown open, and the
wrestlers entered. MoCaffery was dressed in a
towel and red trunks, with knloks and striped
stockings. Oansdell was clad in continuations—a
combination of socks and pants- The remainder
of his raiment w»s not worn by him. Norman
Turnbull, who subsequently amused himself by
throwing weights about, officiated as referee.
Harcourt wnted on Oansdell for the first engage-
ment, but gave Way subsequently to Foley.
M’Caffery was looked after by a friend. M‘Oaffery
stripped 1411bs. Oansdell somewhat lighter.
Both men were pretty fit, and as they took their
places on the drugget shook hands with an expres-
sion of cordiality which was contradicted by their
subsequent struggles to throw each ether over,

several leet from the sawdust and glared upon
ea<?h othep with an expression of intense and
deadly.hatred. Then they clinched, and after a
short tussle broke. M'Caffery fought several
times for the arm lock, which Oansdell judiciously
refused to allow him. The French hug was put
on several times by both men, but nothing re-
sulted. Eventually Oansdell went down on his
knoes, and Mao set to work to turn him over.
Getting a good grip of his head he worked it down
till the Grecian nose of the young ’un pressed his
knees, and it seemed sovereigns to sixoences Mao
would score. Just then, when excitement was
manifest amongst the onlookers, Oansdell tbrew a
handsome somersault and got away. The fall
followed shortly, and the men retired. They were
perspiring. Perspiration and wrestling seem to
be intimately associated. Barrington and Adam-
son entertained the audience for a few minutes
with the gloves, and put In some very good work.
Oansdell and- M‘Caffery onoa more faced the
music, end, after a merry spin, equalised the
scores, scoring a good fail. We were
just turning to enter the dressing-room when a
man bumped In the small of the back with a
dumb-bell. It weighed three tons—at least It felt
like that when it touched our spinal column. We
were about to annihilate him, when our attention
was diverted. His size protected (him. Otherwise
our undertaker would again have been employed.
Some more dumb-bells being placed in the ring,
young Turnbull entered, and, seizing two of the
lightest, 631 b. each, he amused himself by playing
catchers with them. Then he snatched the 130,
and erected that a few times. After fanning him-
self with a chair for a brief space, he elevated
a gross—you know 1411 b., and we were
going out to fetch in the last founda-
tion stone laid by uord Carington, when he
desisted. We knew Turnbull years ago in Balla-
rat. He was always a friend of ours. We are
glad to claim his friendship now. It is always as
well to be friendly with a man who treats hundred
weights as trifles. We saw Norman knock two
foundrymen off the sidewalk in Ballarat a few
years ago. They had been speaking about him.
Since then we do not speak about anyone. A man
looks such a fool eliding off the sidewalk on hi?

Dan over the defeat of the alleged Ministry o

that that member's son also possesses ability

City are complete or not. The truth la, Mormon-
lam has got Its death-blow. The U.B. Government
have plainly indicated to the saintly polygamists
that they must either submit or quit. To quit
would be too much of a sacrifice, as they hold so
much property in Utah, The idea of submission is
treated with disdain bv the elders, but some ot
them are quietly doing it, and although they are
promptly boycotted, and passed in the streets as
if tbOy were unclean, the number la likely to in-
crease. The laws against polygamy wornd not
interfere with most Mormon households. Miss
Kate Field, who is expected to visit England soon,
says tbat very pious Mormocs have been known
to be married to mother, daughter, and grand-
daughter at the same time, and to be married to
their own nieces. 'he Bishop of Springfield is
married id four of his brother's dfughters, and
another shining light la married to his half-sisters.
But most Mormons are content with one wire.
The most unoompromidng of the saints, wbo_ are
ready to fight in defence of their faith, are taking
extraordinary precautions to prevent the detec-
tion of marriages- Blit some US. politicians talk
of meeting this by making the punishment lor
polygamy—namely, five years’ impr sonment ap-
ply also to unlawful cohabitation.
Thus a correspondent:—“Editor Bui/le-
tin Sib,—l am a new arrival in N.8.W., and I
find on reading the Sydney papers that every
politicil meeting that is held throughout the
colony and addressed by live Ministers of the
Crown and full-blown M.’sP. are brought to a close
with cheers for the Queen. What, in Heaven s
name, does this mean ? I have been electioneer-
ing in Great Britain, Victoria, Queensland, South
Australia, Western Australia, New Zealand, and
other countries, and never saw a political
gathering of the kind brought to a ter-
mination by an Indulgence in cheers for
the Queen. What is the object of this mean-
ingless and ridiculous practice, here in this demo-
cratic country f Is It the outcome of the servile
loyaltv of the people, or Is it because some of those
who sling their hats in the air and lustily cheer
Her Majesty think their cheers will reach the
Queen’s ears and cause her to bestow on them
some of those meretricious baubles or titles after
wf ich this tuft-hunting community hanker so
much ? Or, is It because the electors are utterly
ignorant of the true principles of democracy, and
know nothing of the dire effects that spring from
the system of royalty of which she is a part?
Pray enlighten me at once on the matter! our
correspondent possibly has never met with the
definition that language is given to enable man to
conceal his thougnte. The same thing is some-
times true of cheers.
An analysis of the statistics relating to the
several colonies for the year 1884, brings out some
remarkable facts, and shows how heavily some of
our neighbours are content to pay for the luxury
of railways. A very large proportion ot the
national debt In each colony has been incurred for
the purposes of railway construction, but only in
New South Wales and Victoria is the charge of
interest on the railway debt anything like covered.
In New South Wales the net rail way earnings for
the year specified amounted to £850,535, being only
£330,541 short of the annual interest charge on the
total debt, fcnd in Victoria the deficiency was but
£393 856, Queensland had to make up £444,8i7 out
ot revenue, after receiving the railway earnings.
South Australia. £404.756, and Western Australia,
wherethe net railway income only totalled £64,
£33,496 Tasmania and New Zealand compare the
least favourably. The former colony lost £9363 on
its railways, s > that amount has to be added to the
interest charge of £187,899, making a total of
£147,161 to be paid out of revenue. New Zealand,
which pays £1,699 764 to the public creditor, gets
£406,140 of the sum from the railways, and the
difference. £1,393,624. absorbs 48% per cent, of the
total revenue. As we have said, N.B.W. figures
are the most creditable in this respect, but there
are some ugly rumours anent the charges made
by the Railway Department on Government ma-
terial which, if substantiated, would serve to dis-
count the sum stated as “ net earnings.
One reason, perhaps the chief reason, for
the very general depression existing in New
Zealand seems to be overlooked by the political
aiiid nuncs who seek to explain the why and the
wherefore of the piesent unsound state of affairs
in Maoriland, That is *be price of land in propor-
tion to population. With a population of only
half a million in the whole colony, first-class
agricultural land is as dear in-say, Hawke s Bay,
Poverty Bay, and Canterbury as in Kent, Surrey,
or Hampshire, with their crowds. Faulty legisla-
tion in the past is bearing bitter fruit in other
places besides Ireland. In Hawke’s Bay, between
Napier and Walpaura, some of the finest land in
the world may be seen alongside the railway line.
This land should support tecs of thousands of In-
habitants, and should be cultivated by a yeoman
population. What is it ? The home of sheep, of
Lelcesters and Lincolns—not men, women and
children. No crops asp to be seen, no grain grown,
nothing but sheep. From the train the eye hardly
sees the grass for sheep, In spring and sum-
mer from 25 to 30 sheep per acre are kept
in these paddocks; there is no room for men.
Labour is only wanted occasionally, and is
procured from the “ special settlements of
Scandinavians located by an ‘ artful dodger of
a politician in the densely-timbared forests
fringing these plains, the settlements of Dane-
yirke, Norsewood, and Ormondville. Nearly all
the arable land is owned by about 40 rich men,
rich beyond the dreams of avarice. These men
employ little labour. Import their stores from
homo—are, of course. Conservative, and cry out
that the colony ia ruined, but forget to mention
that the Public Works policy made their fortunes.
But the banks and the loan companies, have their
olaws on fully half the colony, and pay thumping
dividends, screwed out of the struggling settlers.
New Zealand offers a fine field for the money-
lender. Interest on I mns over there averages
fully two per cent, higher than in Sydney.
A volunteer writes:—“The sentiment of
the concluding paragraph of vour ‘ Iniaginary Ad-
dress’ is one which must be felt in the heart of
every true Australian. If ever we are to fight it
will be in the sacred cause of home and liberty.
This is a thought which should, and no doubt will,
in our day of danger, nerve us all to great deeds,
and to endurance under all adversities. But pa-
triotism needs training and organisation to with-
stand the shook of trained troops in battle, and It
cannot be denied that there is little training
and no organisation among our volunteers. In
mv opinion, you place too much importance on
Se need for mechanical skill. Trotops may
hare good drill sergeants and yet most incompe-
tent commanders; and the best drilled troops are
perfectly useless unless they possess an experi-
enced general and a wc'l organised staff. Sir
Frederick Roberts, at a dinner lately given him in
London, said that ‘ For a volunteer service, which
he considered the only practical one tor the
defence of England, he would not insist on very
areat attention to the mechanical details of parade
drill, but advised constant practice m marksman-
shin. and of mere importance than all, efficient
transport and ambulance systems, and a well-
organised commissariat. There was also great
necessity to k ; ep up teams of trained
artillery horses.’ It is a known lact that
our authorities in Sydney here have never
yet given their attention to B b ch childish
matters as these If we had to take the
field wi should, iu all probability, bo starving be-
fore the necessary forms and orders could be filled
iiu to sanation the purchase and Issue of stores.
The armiery horses on which we shall have to de-
pend, unless some reform is made, are now
quietly munching their com in the bus company’s

The German explorers have discovered an

A tree that wouldn’t resent that doesn t deserve a

found a number of lager beer corks in the neigh-

that the shock that caused the previous visitor to
fall was bottled in Germany.
For a modest little reference to itself, the

Everybody has heard of the “Dames of

authority of Lady Randolph Churchill for saying
that branches of the League “ have bean estab-

Do we think advertising pays? Well, just
drop your eyes over this, and judge for your-
selves. A family in Cooktown lose tneir little ten-

doorstep, asd exclaiming, “Itwss all on account
of that cuEsel drink,” roiled o ver and died on the
soot. In his stomach was found: A fistful of red
hair, a pur of boot-heels, a pair of Knickerbocker
pants, atop, a toy pistol, two green apples,-a knife,
and a piper collar. The ’gator had seen the ad.
and came to return all that was left of the boy.
We can vouch for this, because the editor of the
Miner— a God-fearing man in his own way—tells
the yarn.

The baneful effect of horse exercise is
aptly Illustrated by the Patagonians, Formerly
from chasing 1 the ostrich on foot, these people had
magnificent legs. But. sines the ln Jt,roducition of
horses, the patives’ lower limbs have become
atrophied from disuse, and are now neither so use-
ful nor so ornamental as the sawdust legs-that
dangle at the sides of untamed steeds in a panto-
mime. Oddly enough, the former leg develop-
ment appears to have run down into the feet—
probably from the constant jolting-so that now,
when neighbours visit one another Just aftera
. shower of rain, you know you are in Patagonia by
the network of large waterholes about. Id
interior of N.8.W., owing to a similar cause, there
is a like tendency for the legs to become cylindri-
cal from the ankle up and the feet flatly amor-
phous. Indeed, at the Secularists’ plonie last
Sunday we danced with a Dubbo lady whose feet,
while obliging one section of the public to stand
on cnairs and the balance to go outside and look
in through the windows, could be depended on to
make an impression atter rein and sodj some-
thing in solving the vexed question of irrigation.
One of our crack trainers is a man who,
when it conaes to a question of surrounding vic-
tuals, can hold his own even with a New Guinea
chief who has survived a six weeks shipwreck.
Being too late for his usual training quarters In a
Southern town not long ago, he was forced to put
un at a high toned hotel, the dining table of which
was. to use his own expressive words, generally
“ full ov silver plate, an’ flowers, an til like, but
th’ ‘grub’ wouldnt fill a grown-up muskeeter.
At his first breakfast here, he noticed the bread
was cut as thin as a Passover cake that Trad Just
been tram-carred, but, by placing half-a-dozen
slices one on top of the other and then folding
them up he managed to take the edge off his
hunger. At dinner he was on the alert, however,
and, catching sight of the waiter skipping round,
he shouted across the table, Hey 1 are you the
daisy that carves this bloomin’bread-and-butter?
“Yes sir ” “Weil, go out an’ cut us some good
box logs of it- an’ give us no more ov yer stringy-
bark shingles.” There was a, clergyman at the

In Parramatta, N.S.W., a sect called
Rechabltes have lately established themselves.
They are, as far as can be learned, a people en-
tirely opposed to the principles of shouting or
otherwise spending tneir savings m soakage. A
Jewish gentleman, named Jonadab, his surname is
unknown, started this faith in the days when gin
and religion were supposed to be intimately asso-
ciated. At the founding of the order Democracy
was probably the spirit of the times, but with the
march of intellect the spirit of dead Democritus
has been exorolssd, and now the tents of the
tea-drinkers afford the same skelter for the
soul of grovel as is atfarded by the man-
sion of the Potts’ Point plnonbeck aris-
tocrat. The latest development of the crawl-
ing craze among these liquor-lacking lunatics
has appeared at Parramatta, where the most
recently established ” tent ” has been called “ The
Carington.” What sarcastic soul suggested this
title for the “ tent ” we know not, butfwe do know
we would rather be a toad and live on the vapours
of a smoke-house cellar than be a bottle of three-

their principles, if they have any, to associate

THE MINER'S SRORY
The world bag seen no greater revolution than
that which was effected by the great discoveries of
gold deposits in California and Australia. , Without
doubt these discoveries induced an impetus acd
energy which have, indirectly, but certainly, in-
fluenced the whole human family. The more pal-
pable result which is afforded by the astounding
development of this continent, is apparent to the
dullest perception. Tae greater Biitain of to-day
would have remained a mere sheep walk and cattle
prairie for centuries to come, nad not gold been
discovered in New South Wales and Victoria,
Population would have had but slow development,
aau progress would have proceeded at tortoise
pace. We should have remained to the thought of
the old civilization, the ultima ttiide, of the world—
a vague, indistinct out-of-the-way community,
with no political or social st-ength, and but small
comm ucial or industrial importance
To the miner then, the poineer of our progress,
we owe it, that at this moment we count as a factor
in the history o£ nations. And here it Is interesting
to note how, from the personal and self-see King
exhibition of energies, toe growth and strength of
communities are developed. Tno eager gold-
hunger which animated the hordes of miners who
sought these shores, was the motive force under the
operation of whicn Australis has advanced with
such mighty strides. Whatever industrial strength
we now possess; whatever commercial greatness
may Declaimed by us; whateverof advanoomentia
art and sc ence, in political force or social culture,
is our awn, we owe primarily to the miner. He It
was who, with pick a. d spade, cradle and windlass,
laid the foundation of a State, wni ih, even now
In its first youth, bids fair to accomplish a des-
tiny as brilliant, as powerful in its operations, us
influential in its political effect* upon other States,
as any exhibited to us la the history of ancient
or modern times.
But, in the nature of things, this stupendous re-
sult has rot been accomplished without greats«c-
jrifloe,misery, failure, and disaster All thatglletens
Is not gold, as tne miner well knows If the prlza
of gold seeking are great, tho failures aru nMny f

Lady Carington held her second reception
at Government House last Tuesday afternoon.
The attendance was not quite so numerous as on
the previous occasion, but tne pretty gardens,
verandahs, and refreshment-room were, never-
theless, well thronged. Lady Carington wore a
dress composed of pure white damask, made
slmoly and a perfect llfc, small bonnet of gold net,
with a delicious bunch ®f shaded pink roses in
front, long suede gloves, ana white broehe para-
sol lined with ruby satin. The Hon. Judith
Harbord's loostume showed exquisite tas‘e. The
material was black and grey silk made with
zouave jacket, and the skirt was trimmed with
throe rows of black lace insertion, through which
glimmered the white under-draperies; or«*m
witch-shaped bonnet, touched with plus. Miss
Clara Manning wore a becoming cream dress, with
old go d satin vtst, and the skirt edged with gold
laoe, small closely-fitting yellow straw bonnet,
which suited her comely face admirably. Mrs.
Sydney Want looked majestic in a skirt of black
and white striped satin, and long polonaise
of black satin, handsomely trimmed with
jet. Madame Keilerman also wore blaok satin,
trimmed with rich laoe, small beaded net
tippet, and white bonnet ; Mrs. M’Phiilamy
looked charming in a cream costume, with broobe
vest, and a cunning hat-bonnet, ornate with lilies
of the valley; Miss Throckmorton wore pale-blue
and crepe cloth, long grey gloves,
and light bonnet; Miss Bbsworth, fawn ooatume,
with brown velvet vest and small straw bonnet;
Mrs. Monday wore one of the most tasteful cos-
tumes in the whole assembly, being a pure
white embroidered muslio, with small oape of
same material, and a rather large white poke-
shaped bonnet. The simple, though exquisite
costume, was universally admired. Mia. Brough-
ton wore dark-green satin, with bonnet to match;
Miss Gertrude Ffsoher, cream, touched with ruby
velvet, and small straw bonnet. A oream-striped
broehe dress, with bright amber-satin scarf, was
very striking. Mrs. Prince was attired In a brown
satin underskirt, with draperies of pale gold and
white broehe; Mrs. M‘Doaald wore a handsome
blaek costume and gold ornaments; Mrs. D. Evans,
white costume and yellow straw bonnet. Whites
and creams predominated largely, and were cer-
tainlyamongst the most tasteful dresses to be seen.
There were also dresses which showed that the
wearers possessed more of wealth than of good
testft and also some toilettes which might, with
truth, be designated as dowdy, btdi, taken as a
whole, it was a brilliant assemblage of charmingly
attired ladies and pleasant company. Refresh-
ments were served during the afternoon, and the
little Vernon lads not only played, but varied
their performance by singing a chorus capitally.

Mr. John Sands, of Qeorge-street, issued
Invltatloos to a few people of note to view his
Lit st pictures last Thursday afternoon. The chief
works were “ The Last Appeal” and “The Battle
of Trafalgar.” Lord and Lady Carington, accom-
panied by the Hon. Judith Harbord and one of the
aides, arrived at 4.80 and gave close and critical at-
tention to '** The Last Appeal,” which < coupled a
considerable space at the further end of the gal-
lery. Lady Carington was tastily attired in a navy-
blue silk ‘dress, simply made but charmingly effec-
tive. The small bonnet was m the same shade,
adorned with a single wing. Miss Harbord wore a
pale-blue*zephyr dress, and small round black bat
trimmed with scarlet velvet. The immense crowd
which collected round Sands’ door in order to wit-
ness the egress of the vice-regal party from the
picture gallery, pointed to the fact that there are
far more idlers in Sydney than there ought to be.
The visitors were lustily cheered as they took
their seats and drove away, after which the enthu-
siast!® crowd kindly uaknotted itself and allowed
business men and women to pass along as usual.

There is no longer any need for pleasure-
seekers who visit our pretty Botanical Gardena
with the Intention of remaining there for the day
to encumber themselves by carrying their mlna-
ture hampers containing comforts for the inner
man along with them—somebody has had the
thoughtfulness to suggest that a refreshment-
room should be erect ea on the spot where ladies,
children, and even the sterner sex if they wish,
can obtain refreshments-good, varied, and rea-
sonably cheap. The building has cost the Govern-
ment £lOOO. and was designed by the City Archi-
tect. It is an unique structure, and is situated
in one of tne shadiest nooks la the Gardens. Mrs.
Campbell manages the affair, and already finds
numerous cus ;omers.

Mr. Boyle has been doing good work with
bis singing class the last quarter. Last Thursday
night an opportunity was afforded the public to
judge of the the pupl s, and their pro-
ficiency at singing at sight was highly creditable.
The pupils now number 400, and the classes are
held in tbe Musical Institute, Gastlereagh-street.
During the evening Mr. Boyle was presented with
an Illuminated address on behalf of his numerous
pupils, in acknowledgment of which he made a
speech expressing his thanks.

Messrs. Sohott and Co., of 281 Qeorge-
street, show one of the best musical catalogues of
any firm la the city. Amooget their latest publi-
cations is one of Sydney dmltb’s impromptues
for pianoforte, waloa he calls “ Inquietude.” This
moroeau, though not too dlfiloult, is well worth a
student’s attention, and is both quaint and pretty.
“Une vislte d’Arlequin,” by Jfcienri Kowalski, is
a most characteristic piece, and requires careful
reading to do it full justice. It is dedicated to
Madame Charbonnec-Kellermann. Another piano-
forte piece, by Kowalski, la “ Kermoese Bretoune,”
and is decidedly pretty. A novelty la “ riouvenlrs
d’un Premier Ball,” by L. Streabbog, which com-
prises original waltzes, mazurka*, quadrilles,
galops, &c.—a whole ball programme, lu fact.
The idea is capital, and the book should find much
favour amongst onr dancing community. Bach
of these piofiu itlona is graced by a handsome pic-
torial ©over.

A very enjoyable evening was spent at
she5 he Ferns, Randwlok, on Tuesday, the sfh5 f h of
anuary, when the charming nostces entertained
§ few intimate friends. Dancing and singing
formed the chief part of the amusement a. The
hostess wan attired in a very elegant gown of
brown yak laoe over amber satin and brown moire
bows; her married sister wore white fassa silk and
broad lace; a young lady recently from Melbourne
(who is to be led to the altar shortly by a gentle-
man well known In Rand wick) looked petite and
pretty in handsome black lace and Jet; a Rand-
wick lady looked well in cream muslin relieved
with bias moire and handsome white laoe; two
sisters looked deliciously cool in becoming gowns
of cream. The company dispersed rather early
owing to an alteration in the trams.

Burrowa bachelors gar© a ball the other
day* and In consideration of the refining influence
Lord Oarlngton’s advent Into the colony has had
upon N. 6. W. society. It was decided that this
affair should be particularly exclusive, the line to
be drawn at shepherds. The invitations numbered
160, twenty of whom accepted—fifteen bachelors
and five jadles. A gentleman with a real claw-
hammer suit, crumpled shirt, and stained aids was
considered the beau of the ball, and the five ladles
were simply rushed with partners. When this tall

The Laidlev-Moore wedding was a' very
grand affair. The bride was a blaze of white
satin, diamonds, and pearls. The bridesmaids, fire
In number, wore cream satin and dark green vel-
vet, with valenoieunes laoe trimming, aigrette and
bird in the hair, and bronze shoes. They were
Misses Olive and Edith Moore (sisters of the bride),
Ml-s Rank!veil. Miss Mabel Laldley, and mi»u»
Asgel Merivale. Mr. Vlrner Moore, of Sydney,
cousin to the bride, acted as best man. The bride's
presents were magnificent. It was unfortunate
that the day should hare been so wet and gusty.
Mr. David Moere entertained nearly 200 guests at
Charnwood, after the ceremony. The happy pair
make a tour through Gippsland before taking up
their residence In Sydney.

The Valetta, which arrived on Thursday
evening, has brought out some well-known pas-
sengers-the Bishop of Melanesia and Mrs. Selwyn,
Mr. Carl Sahl (Imperial German Consul) and his
brlde-wlfe, a German lady whom he married in
Berlin three months since. Bishop and Mrs. Sel-
wyn make a very short stay In Sydney, as they
start for New Zealand Immediately, en route for
Norfolk Island. They really left the Valetta at
Melbourne, and travelled overland to Bodalla, the
beautiful estate of the late T. S. Mort, Esa., father
of Mrs. Selwyn, where they remained for a few

“Gaffney," a plain bushman, who frankly dis-
claims all pretentions to educational attainments,
writes as follows; and we opine that there’s more
real thought in what he says than in reams of such
leading articles *' as some very pretentious dally
papers regularly place before the public:—“ That
poem of Tennyson’s on * Vastoees ’ surprises me
(that’s if a little, uneducated mind like mine may
be allowed to say a few words about such a gifted
being). Well, it Las puzzled me to think how a
person seeing so plainly the follies of mankind,
and not being a creature of circumstances, could
ever leave the ranks of men and allow his vanity
to bring him down so low that he might drop into
the company of humbugs, and have to listen to all
sorts of drivel; to become a sort of patent royal
windmill-poet; a setter-up of royal nonsense; and
write the poem on ‘Vastness,’ beats me. In
hig lines of ‘Thraldom for Freedom,’ be is to
mo little better than the half-drunken navvy, who
stands at the bar of a busn shanty, and while bis
clothes are still wet with perspiration, st’ikes up
‘Britons neverchall te slaves;' although, perhaps,
haif-an-hour previous he wets slinging muck in a
railway cutting with the thermometer close upon

master Hies the Sc. Georges Cross while loaded

don’t know they are. I can also feel sorrow for
those that are staves and cannot help themselves,
through many causes ; but people who degenerate
to slavery willingly mad knowingly—not through
want, but that they may share In the company of
fashionable dudes, the vanities and humbugs of
human existence during the few years they live—
for such people the contempt of all real lovers of
true liberty is only what they deserve, whether
they be poets or anything else.”...."Xantipped
<B. Melbourne): We don t sue tnat the highly
educated German gentleman was so especially

out of ten readers would have concluded the
satire was aimed at Lord Carlbgton, and not at the
lick-spittle crew who publish a long paragraph if
he but sneeze, dilating on the grace and talent
evinced in his style of atohee-ing...,"Oneof the
Ol Polloi ”: The circumstance that the trustees of
the Art Gallery specially decorated the premises
in anticipation of a visit of Lord Carlngton, does
not strike us as sycophantic. He is, of course, an
honoured guest wherever he goes, and it is but
usual to make some little special preparation tor
a distinguished and welcome visitor. But in
closing the Gallery against the public, the trustees
perhaps exceeded their legitimate powers, 'ihe
Gallery belongs to, and is paid for, by the public.
Still we don’t think anyone should grumble at one
day of exclusion, considering the object in
i view. Lord Cailngton is trying his best to
I make himself agreable. Apart irom the po 1-
tioal significance of the grovelling which responds
to his advances, we think bis amiable intentions
deserve recognition in the same spirit. One can
be politically opposed to the system a man repre-
sents, yet appreciate his personal good qualities...
“Simple Simon”; The Hon. Francis Longmore,
who, after having helped to fight the battle of the
Victorian selectors and working classes generally
for many years, was rejected .because he had the
courage to take the chair at Redmond's Land
League meeting In Melbourne, and afterwards to
affix bis signature to the Grattan address, repre-
sented the Ripen and Bampoen electorate for
nearlv 20 years. That ungrateful constituency
rejected him because the Press, and the Jin-
goes, bigots and " loyalists ’’ of the South-
ern colony represented him as being a dis-
loyal subject and a sympathiser with Irish
crime, and his opponent Mr. Uren, who Is
a shining light among the Orangemen—went
everywhere about the electorate calling for
oheers for the Queen. Mr. Longmore wasn't
either a Cathuiio or a Conservative at any time.
He was born in the North of Ireland, and be-
longed to the Protestant religion. He proved
himself to be a bold, fearless, honest Radical at all
times, and never compromised a principle. Jhe
capitalists didn't bate honest Francis Longmore
more than they hated Graham Berry. They could
never “ nobble ” Longmore, but they did “ nobble *

unmarried a daughter of John Henniker, and
their son was born at Kochester, Kent, on the 18th
vfl r 3818, so the present candidate is m his 88th
Jlar’ After a preliminary education at the Kent
Se Grammar or High School, he completed his
education at the King's College, London. His
father having died when Mr. Henniker Heaton
was not five years of age, and his mother’s death
having taken place when he attained hla 17th year,
he with the sum of £3OO, was sent to Australia in
the Great Britain steamship under the charge of
55,® torn Gray, in Australia he took to pastoral
Pursuits with varying lortune. At one period of
fra life he held, with his partner and friend, no
less than three million acres of land, on lease, in
ir a ytr • but it must not be understood that this
denoted great riches. Having a great pmchant
for literary pursuits, he embarked part of his
small capital in newspapers with varying success;
and at length he obtained (by marriage) an interest
fn one of the largest and most profitable ne wa-
fers inN.S.W.; which proved much more re-
munerative than sheep and cattle and pastoral
pursuits generally. He now holds a sleeping
partnership in one of the best station on the Bar-
dng Kiver. N.8.W., on which are 35 000 sheen and a
small herd of cattle. Ha has also under lease a
vast tract of country in Western Australia.
•• la 1877 he visited England, and the Home News
of October 31 of th *t year contains a most flatter-
ing description of a dinner given to him, at the
Carlton House, by 40 of his old King ■School com-
panions. Having secured a fortune after 18 or 20
years’ toil, he finally returned to England in 1881,
although retaining his interests in Australia.
“ His public career in Australia is a most credit-
able one, and was marked by many acts for the
public benefit. He bears in Australia a high
character and reputation for probity. The best
proof of this is in the fact that when he was
leaving Australia for England the leading colonists
of all political parties united to do him honour,
and entertained him at public banquets. The last
dinner given to him in Sydney was attended by
the Prime Minister, other members of the Minis-
try. and the leaders of the Opposition. The guest-
list contains the honoured names of Sir John
Eobertson, K C.M.G., Prime Minister of N.B W.;
Sir P. A. Jennings, M.P, the present Colonial
Secretary of the Colony; the Hon. W, J-Trlckett.
the Postmaster-General; Mr. E. C. Cracknel!, the
Superintendent of Telegraphs; the Kev. Canon
Kemmis, of St. Marks, Darling Point, Sydney,
where Mr. Heaton was church warden-[Humph I -
Ed. B.l—the Hon. Charles Cowper, fllgn Sheriff of
N.S.W., &o.” [Who gave to Mr. Charles Cowper,
Sheriff of the N.S.W. Supreme Court, the title of
“ Hon." or the title of High Sheriff ? wr. Cowper
is a very affaole little man, who wears a very clean
white umbrella, and nods to the hangman in quite
a charming way when he wants him to pull the
bolt, but we now learn for the first time that
Charles is “ Honourable ” and “ High.” However,
as G. A. Lloyd is entitled to be officially designated
as the “ Hon.” within N.S W. only, so Charles may
he entitled to the prefix “Hon.” only outside our
boundaries. Henniker, being well-versed m Court
—and Supreme Court—mysteries, should be an
authority on this subject.—Ed 8.l
“In 1883 Mr. Henniker Heaton received the
thanks of the Government of N.S.W. for a gift to
the colony of valuable documents relating to the
discovery of Australia. In the previous year the
Mayor and Corporation of the city of Sydney pre-
sented an address to Mr. Heaton expressive of
their thanks for his generosity to the city.
“In all philanthropic works he has been most
active, and far more benev ■ - than scores of
colonists possessed ©f larger - ; !| His common
sense, his perseverance, and n a .vondertul ad-
ministrative ability was borne testimony to re-
peatedly by opponents and friends. During a
severe illness in Sydney from typhoid fever, the
most extraordinary sympathy was shown him,
and brought out more prominently than anything
else the high estimation in which he was held. At
one period he was reported dead, and most flatter-
lag biographies were written in neighbouring
colonies when the news was sent along the wires.
IYou can’t flatter a dead man. Henmker should
have told the public what the papers said when
they found that after all he was allve.-Eo B] A
telegram the next day announced the crisis as
being over and the patient on the way of re-
covery. A brusque Australian Premier, who was
touched by the news, telegraphed as follows :
• Dear Heaton, I only thanked God twice before.
I thanked Him the third time when the wire
flashed the news you were saved. [lt wul be at
once apparent to every orthodox person that the
Almigaty couldn’t possibly take muck notice ot
thanks from so undevout a person upon snch an
©cession.— Ed B ] . r , j ....
t ‘During the great famine in Ireland in 18. 8-• 9, Mr.
eaton, though an Englishman, was the first to
inaugurate a relief fund, and ho secretly sub-
iscritied one thousand pounds. On the platform
.at the flrst public meeting in Sydney he succeeded
in arranging for the appearance of the Protestant
Primate of Australia (Bishop Barry), with those of
•other religions. The total amount raised towards
the funds inAusiralia for the committee of the
Lord Mayor and the Duchess ot Marlborough (the
another of Lord Randolph Churchill) was £97,090,
au amount greater than the combined subscrip*
tions given by England and Anmrffi*- Thousands
of lives were thus saved by the admiutotrative
ability of Mr. Heaton, who attended the com-
mittee rooms daily, and used his influence with
the leading banking institutions to telegraph at
the rate of £lO9O a day to England free of charge.
“ Mr. Heaton, being a lover ot yachting, offered,
in January, 1830, a champion prize for the best
yacht in the Australian waters over a 30 mile
course. No less than 13 yachts competed lor the
prize, and it brought about one of the most in-
teresting and exciting matches ever held. It was
won by the yacnt Guinevere, the property of the
Hon J. H. Want, the present Attorney-General ot
N.S.W. Mr. Want shortly afterwards proceeded
to England and purchased the ill-fated Mignon-
ette, and on its way to Australia me terriblee*© -t
occurred which led to the imprisonment ot Dumey
and Stephens for cannibalism.
There’s a lot more, but here space falls. It la,
perhaps, just as wed to stop at a place where
Henniker lets us know he la prepared to use, for
election purposes, ©von a case of cannibalism. To
conclude:— „ , r
“It only remaioa to aav something of Mr.
Heaton’s domestic ties. He married iu 1873 tue
only daughter of the late Samuel Bennett, Esq ,
of Mundarrah Towers. Australia, who, on tue
mother’s side, is connected with the Vivyans and
the Carthews, some of the oldest families in Oora-
«v*U.” Joy I
That brawny Soot, Donald Dinnte, has.,
been doing the thing up Adelaide way in the
generous, lavish manner for which Scotchmen
are proverbial. He and Miller got up an athletic
tournament which eame off on the second day of
the New Tear, and trapped the locals with in-
geniously worded handbills and programmes,
seeming to infer that both professors would be
debarred from receiving prizes. However, when
the loot was to be earned the brawny Donald was
in the vicinity, and struggled for it with his cus-
tomary zeal. Koachock, an Adelaide man, beat
him In two events, but Dinnie claimed the spone,
as his opponent had not worked precisely within
Caledonian rules. This excited the crowd, and it
hooted and reviled the lusty Scotchman with
unanimity and decision, and it several times
seemed about to vent its spleen in a free fight
Dinnie has a way of affecting people like that.
Donald likes to wrestle his matches—bona 'flie
ones—in It different styles, but so far he has
unable to drop across a man conversant with so
many. Should he ever come across such a one the
wily Soot will not be beaten, we'll engage, even if
he ha* to increase his list of styles to 28.
The Rev. John Alexander Dowie, now of
Melbourne, once of Sydney, Is known to church-
goers as a level-headed light of religion. He is
also known as a chosen vessel for the attacks of
the emissaries of Satan, who quite recently tried
to dynamite Dowie and hi* tabernacle into the
realms of space. They failed in this effort, and
John escaped. He has lately appeared in anew
character, and poses before the public as a martyr
of the first water. He has lost money. And that,
too, after a business calculation in which 60 to
1 was the odds laid him by Mr, W. Holding, a Sal-
vation Army captain and prominent Devil-fighter.
In the year 1880 it appears that Holding an-
nounced that he had succeeded to a fortune, and
would give £20,000 to buiid a tabernacle for Mr.
Dowie, who was then in Sydney. The result was
that he persuaded Mr. Dowie to give him £3OO to
go to England. Mr. Dowie heard nothing more of
him till he recognised him at nJßalratlon Army
meeting on New Year’s Day, in ihe Albert Park, j
as a conspicuous officer. Holding, on being ac-
costed, made a long confession of frauds, which
he said be had perpetrated in England and here.
Thus do we see again made manifest the fact that
religious men should not take the odds or gamble
in any way, even though the erection of a temple
hung in the balance. William Holding was not, at
the time of making the arrangements as above, so
beaming a lantern of love as he subsequently be-
came, but it is fair to suppose that he became in-
duced to Join the faith In the hope of working a
few more similar gatm s and getting rich enough
to start a tabernacle of his own.
“ There is no use of our subscribers asking
for bread and in reply give taem a »tone. There
! is absolutely nothing doing in town to-day, not is
i there any news.” Bo waits the Riverine stab lu
a recent issue. Well, this la another ooniesetuu of
honesty. The Stab, has, however, waxed vague
in its metaphor. Stones, bread, newspapers, and
scarce local items are ratner distantly related, but
up .Riverine way there is, of course, some allow-
ance to be made for the using of startling simile;—
Tell us, little twinkling Stab,
What your misty meanings are ?
Why is simile like thine
Permitted in the Riverine ?

Wny, blessings on you, llttie Stab,
You bristle nrlght witn witty " par.”
Good ad., and wire, neath leader bead.

Why live up there-a primed farce ?
Leave Riverine, that place is dead,
And go out ” whaling.” Stab, instead.
Harry Lynch and his crowd are ringing
a triple bob-major through the egg-and-buaer
country. They ring the week out at Wollongong,
ana then go to Bulu on Monday. And for the next
three months every one in that district who oan
beg. borrow, or steal a cow-bell, will try to per-
suade his friends that he is an incipient Lynch.
That is tae worst of these Bellringers. As they go
through the country, their progress is marked ny
a line of banged-to-bits cow and dinner bells,
which show that all who have heard the crowd
fancy that it la “ easy enough to play on tnem
bells You just listen to me.” A retail beil-pediar
follows in Harry’s trail three months subsequently,
and it is darkly whispered that Harry ” stands in ”
witn him.

Madame Minnie Hauk, the prima donna,
has courageously denounced the bouquet nuisance
at theatres by coolly Ignoring those thrown to her.
She simply leaves them to be swept up by the
attendants.
Lady canvassers are so plentiful in Eng-
land now that the papers are discussing at great
length the question: Is an election kiss to be
regarded as a bribe?’’ The lawyers don’t regard it
as a valuable consideration.
As a sign of affection, kissing was un-
known to the Australian aborigines, the Papuans,
or the Esquimaux. The few representatives of
these races whom we have seen convinced us that
this restraint was quite natural.
A few bachelors who intended to give a
ball coaxed their lady acquaintances to superin-
tend the decorations of the ball-room. They did
so, and nowhere could the eye rest in that room
without encountering such mottoes as “Paint
heart ne’er won fair lady,” “ What is home with-
out another?” &e„ &o. Yet some men pretend
that women have no business capacity.
Consequent upon the increasing muscu-
larity of women in Indiana, U.S., it is proposed to
alter the marriage service there, so as to make it
read, “ Who dare take this woman ?” And the
brave bridegroom will reply, “ I dare.” Then the
bridegroom will promise to love, honour, and
obey, and submit to be led away by the trium-
phant Amazon. Women’s rights are respected in
Indiana.
Patti and Jenny Lind had a tiff recently
at a private party. Patti had been singing with
great brilliancy an air of Mozart. Jenny Lind
ventured to express her opinion that Patti had
rather hurried the time In the music. “ And lest
you may think,” she added, “that I am like a blind
man speaking of colour, I may tell you that 1 am
Jenny Lind Goldschmidt.” Patti, somewhat
nettled, retorted, “Oh yes, I know you were a
famous singer—once. I have heard my grand-
father speak of you.”
From Modbrw Society: “At the ball given
last week at Sandringham House each woman
appears to have made a determined effort to out-
do every other member of her sex either in the
make and colour of her gown, or by appearing
without a bodice. A waistband and two shoulder-
straps seems to have been the order of the night,
and there was as fine an exhibition of skin and
bones and flesh as could be met with between here
and the antipodes.” Thus do the aristocratic
maidens and matrons of England prove their right
to be considered fast by a determined effort to
out-strlp one another. But what does Society
mean by the “ antipodes.” Our lady friends may
know, but we don t pretend to a knowledge of
feminine articles of alleged apparel.
J am a modest little maid,
Who thinks it more polite
To bid a man “ good evening ”
Than bid a man “ good night."
And if the human members

A leg a “ lower limb.”
1 never speak of feeling sick,
But say that I am “ 111,”
And being in my dressing-gown

In fact, I alway s hesitate
To call a spade a spade,
Because, you see, I try to be
A modest little maid. v
Melbourne is once more to the front with
• matrimonial phenomenon. The bride, at a recent
wedding In that city, owned up to 57 winters, and
the bridegroom was 31. We were going to say
“had come to years of discretion,” but his action
makes the phrase sound like a palpable untruth.
Of course the connubial Katisha had money. The
curious thing about the affair Is that the bride
was engaged to her present hub’s father about
40 years ago, but the course of their true love
did not run smooth. Possibly she was not then
sufficiently matured. Possibly she is now.
Bhe was suffering from a severe attack of
rheumatism on her wedding-day, but is since re-
ported to be better. A man Of 31 is very young
to be entrusted with the care of a sprightly little
maiden of 67. We hope he will take due care of
her, and that she will be similarly cautious about
her money.
In Japan etiquette demands that when a
gent'eman calls upon a lady he shall stay until she
gives him “ the office ”to depart. To go sooner
would be a fearful solecism. This custom put a
Japanese visitor to London in an awkward fix re-
cently. He went during the morning to pay a
Srst call, and found only the lady of the housd at
ome. Hour after hour he stayed: luncheon
came, but he wont not, and during the afternoon
he attached himself to the household furniture as
fixedly as though he were a bailiff, although he
felt himself to be as unwelcome as that official.
At length dinner and the master of the house ar-
rived simultaneously, but still he stuck to his posi-
tion like another defeated Premier of N.B.W.
During the evening the host and hostess took
half-hour spells of entertaining him, and at last
when the clock announced ghost-time he got up,
and, with the most abject apologies tor leaving so
soon, put himself on the outside of the front door.
The visitation was of Itself penance enough for
the lady, but it was not the end of her trouble, for
Jap. told his friends about her treatment of him.
He said he had never spent so bad a time before;
his hostess had made him stay hour after hour, so
that he had at last to he absolutely rude to her,
and depart without her permission. In Sydney,
when a fellow calls on his girl, It is usually the
old man who gives him a hint to clear. Often
enoqgh it is a No. 9 size hint, made in blucher style.
With a sole two inches thick.

sueh advertisements as this,” a lady correspondent
writes us, “ that prevent many honest-minded
women from procuring suitable domestics.”
Quite true, but advertisements of this kind are
hot altogether responsible for the fair writer’s
woes. A Sydney clothing manufacturer told us
the other day that he wanted 100 girls in his estab-
lishment and couldn’t get 30. Such girls, he said,
earned up to £3 a week; 40 of those em-
ployed by him averaged £3 Bi. weekly ;
their hours were by no means excessive, they were
all addressed as “Miss,” instead of “May” or
" IRllaa ” (a fact when to the ordinary woman was
worth much more tnan half-a-sovereign a week),
and they had all their evenings to themselves. It,
of course, seems hard to ladles that they should

It Is so remarkably seldom that we hear
anyone calling out “stinking fish for sale” th f we
feel bound to notice the following item, if
only for the sake of Its novel character. A new
venture In Journalism, called Tne Matrimonial
News has Just been started In Melbourne to fill
the usual long-felt want. The editor’s own words
are that the thins: is to be “ devoted to the promo-
tion of conjugal felicity, having for its object the
abolition of that civilisation which combined with
the cold formalities of society, and the rules of
etiquette, imposes such restrictions on the sexes
that there are thousands of marriageable men aud
women, of ad ages, capable of making each other
happy, who never have a chance of meeting,
either in town or country.” To remedy this, the
News intends to be the means of bringing ladies
and gentlemen “ honestly together,” and at the
same time furnish a budget of readable matter cal-
culated to advance the interests of the married
state. With wonderful irony or ignorance, how-
ever, the editor, who could never have heard of
Mrs. Caudle, heads bis first article “The Peace of
ajeep,” a little matter to which every respectable
sort of father must necessarily be a total stranger.
As If this was not enough to choke any sane man
olt the .business, however, we are treated to
another blood-curdling item which says, “ A wife
in San Francisco lately put a petition for divorce
in the court, on the ground that her husband was
a‘confounded fool.’ The court wouldn’t admit
her plea, because almost every married man would
be liable to the same imputation.” After that, let
us have this deluge that blacks, and
ants are preparing for. Death has no terrors for
us now.
Tne Montenegrins have some very pecu-
liar customs, notably those relating to marriage.
A Montenegro masher does not see his girl until
he is introduced to her at a banquet arranged for
the purpose. If she then consents to drink with
him, the engagement is at once announced. A
similar custom obtains at Clontarf picnics. If a
“ bart ” drinks with a “Joker ” he is considered to
have a registered mortgage on her sweetest smiles
for the rest of the day. In Montenegro tho hus-
band bosses his household in a monarchic fashion,
but his reign does not begin until after the honey-
moon is over. Here again their usages are similar
to ours, for “ lovey” always takes in the milk until
the end of the honeymoon here, afer which
"dovey” has to leave the old man snoring
and go down with the Jug herself. Buc
this is wandering from the subject. On the
wedding-day, In Montenegro, the bride heads
a sort of triumphal procession to the church,
accompanied by her relatives and the local
equivalent of the Sydney Lanceahs and Sal-
vation Army. The bridegroom, on the contrary,
sneaks in as secretly as possible, and departs in the
same undignified manner, amid the openly-
expressed derision of all who happen to see him.
A banquet follows the ceremony, and In the morn-
ing the guests ante-up Britannia teapots, glass
butter-dishes, and similar articles of use or vertu.
If a son is the result of the ceremony, rejoicing
ensues, and the health of both parties is drunk
with the usual He's-a-Jolly-good-fellow accom-
paniment, but if a daughter be found beneath the
fabled gooseberry bush the husband apologises for
the error, and promises that it shall never occur
again. Daughters there are a drug in the market,
while sons are invariably above par. Funny
people the Montenegrins.
Someone has somewhere obscurely hinted
that Jealousy is a part, of course a small one, of
woman’s character. His suspicions would be
strengthened by the report of a scene which re-
cently took place within a Paris cemetery. Tears
ago, it is said, a couple were married in the world’s
metropolis of fashion, and of the linked pair the
wife proved entirely devoted and faithful, but the
husband was entirely otherwise. The wife could
never discover who the other woman was,
although hubby’s unfaithfulness was notorious.
After several years the sinful one died, and the
wife, who loved him to the last, went, on the anni-
versary of bis death, to scatter roses and tears on
the grave. But at the sacred spot she found that
someone else was already employed in this way,
and this other person was a comparatively young
and superlatively beautiful wom»n. They took
in the situation simultaneously, and in less
than 10 seconds teeth and nails were in
active demand, while blood and hair were
a drug in the market. The combat of the
Centaurs and Lapithae pales into utter insig-
nificance compared with this encounter. They
wrestled and gouged and yelled over the grave of
the departed Lothario until the spectators tore
them asunder, and then each departed in much
haste to publish her own account first. There is a
moral in this somewhere, but we have not time to
chop it out now, but content ourselves with the
lament that if a man can get the reputation of
being “a right down bad ’un,” he is always
effusively adored by the more beautiful moiety of
humanity. If, on the contrary, a man gets the
reputation of virtue, his chance of securing “ one
to be to him most dear ” is too infinitesimal to be
worth calculation. We are virtuous (and beauti-
ful), but have never yet been deeply loved, and
would only he too honoured by the love of one
who would —IMatrimonial ads. are inserted at

If the late Governor of Alsace-Lorraine
chastised his subjects with whips, It appears that
Prince Hohenloho intends to chastise them with
scorpions. Where Manteuffel suppressed one
Journal, the present Statthalter suppresses ten.
n the two provinces now, out of all the multitude
of dally and periodical French papers, there re-
main only the Temps, the Figaro, the Gil Blas,
and the Petit Journal to choose from.
Says an English paper:—“At the Derby
Assizes, Kirtfy, a tailor, was convicted of burglary,
and sentenced to 18 months. In passing sentence,
the Judge said Kirby deserved flogging because
he Invited his Maker to * strike him dead if he
was guilty.’ Another man, Clarke, convicted of
another crime, has since confessed to having com-
mitted the very burglary for which Kirby has
been suffering. The innocent man has Just re-
ceived a ‘ free pardon ’ and been liberated, after
undergoing eight months’ hard labour! If the
Government does not compensate this abominably
ill-used man to the tune of at least £5OO he will
have a legitimate grievance to his dying day.
At St. Thomas’ A nglioan Church, Auck-
land (N.Z.), during service on All Saints’ Day, a
number of the congregation walked out. thus and
by this means protesting against certain Ritualistic
practices of the officiating parson. The main
cause of offence was the bearing by one of the
choir of a cross during the singing of the pro-
cessional hymn. Well, personally we are Pagans,
but if the choristers in our Joss-house were to
walk round on their hands, bearing a step-ladder
on each foot, while they bellowed the war song of
the Greeks, we would still have sufficient respect
for tne God we worship, or pretend to, to keep our
seats till the collection boxes were put in motion.
Then we circulate.
Some pious cranks have of late been going
round Sydney with big lumps of chalfe, and
writing, “Read Romans Bfch,” on every discoverable
wall and spaae. But the sons of Belial have fol-
lowed in the track of the cranks, and altered the
inscription to •* Read Romans 18th.” And those
good persons who, prompted by that same idle
curiosity which prompts many people to go to
church, look for the 18th Romans and And it not,
blaspheme somewhat, and sharpen their little
hatchets, that they may fall upon the man with
the chalk. All this shows that the children of this
world are still able to get the weather-gauge of
the children of light, and lick them more than ton-
nage allowance every time.
Amougst the many cholera tales worth re-
telling is one which treats ef a grand roll-up
which took place of all the p agues in the world—
a sort of Monster Unheaitberies Exhibition.
Every known epidemic sent along an influential
representative, and in order to make things hum,
Invitations wvro issued the Press and many
other articles as well The cholera having travelled
a great deal about that time on a starring tour, and
got up Its name, as it were, was given a hearty
welcome, and taken round to be introduced to the
rest of the gay and festive revellers. Mr. Yellow
Jack, Typhus Fever, and the versatile Variola, old
Father Coffin, and many others were greeted by
the cheerful Cholera as old friends, but suddenly
I t' onplng before one he had never seen before he
in amazement, “Have you travelled
1 much, stranger? ” “ 1 have,” was the modest reply
made. “ Indeed,” said the Cholera, “ that’s deuced
strange. You never met me before, did you? ”
“Never,” replied the other. “Queer —very
queer,” mused the Cholera, “ I thought I knew
everybody. Pray what might your name be? ”
“My name,” answered the stranger, “is Soap—
S-o-p-e, S-o-u-p-e, S-oo p, Soap, and don’t you
forget It.” The Cholera said he hoped he might be
struck political If he ever would, and he has kept
his word, for he has shunned the stranger ever
since.
“ Human depravity ” is the title of an
interesting correspondence now going on in the
Argus. We derive all our bad qualities from the
beasts which we resemble, and of which more than
a touch remains in our natures. Had we come
down from the angels we should have been angelic,
but rising from the beasts, as we have done, we
carry something of our ancestry in our blood.
This breaks out occasionally, and we then show
what we really are. The dog, we know, also shows
indications of his wild-dog origin. Getting tired
of the house and the carpets, of the good “ grub ”
found for him, and of the warm kennel, we miss
him for days at a time. On returning, he Is found
to be haggard, dissipated-looking, ragged, and
dirty. He has been “on the burst” and “the
spree,” showing the depravity of his animal
nature, and helping to reconcile us to ours.
Writes a correspondent“ The bush about
Cobar (N.8.W.), though neither dense nor intricate,
counted two lost men a week ago. On Monday a
man was found dead about a mile and a-half from
the gate of Coronga Downs run. His name is
unknown. On Sunday another man was found
dead in the paddock at Booroondara. He lay quite
close to the fence and was without hat or boots.
His name was John H. Richards, and bis father
officiates as Church of England pastor in South
Wales. Both oases show how little use a man’s
judgment is once he misses his way in the Aus-
tralian bush. Each of these must have trudged
for days. It is not unlikely that Richards came
to that fence several times, and each time started
from it assured of making a straight track to
safety. He was bound, however, to wend round
unconsciously in a circle. So with the unknown
man. This is noteworthy in the case of all puz-
zled pedestrians. Nearly all men step longer with
the right leg than with the left. In time, therefore,
a circle is described about the limb of shorter
stride. A foreigner in a city where all were deaf
and dumb would make circles as well as the lost
man in the western wilds.”—[We don’t think much
of this theory. How is it that a lost man who is
on horseback will also describe a circle ? Are
horses right-handed in their legs too 7—Bn. B.]
Young Australia is developing in various
ways. The Unlversity does not get all the talent.
A youthful Australian of 13, named Ballantyne,
objected, and probably with reason, to having a
stepfather. He resolved to remove the obstacle,
and did so with a shot-gun which he borrowed
from a neighbour as “for his stepfather.” The
lender did not take in that the contents only were
intended for that new-made relative of the bor-
rower. The grim little humorist returned the
gun thinking it had done its business, and his step-
father's also, but the charge of shot is likely not to
prove fatal, as he expected. A girl of 18 has been
taken forcibly from her situation by her parents,
the magistrate deciding that they had absolute
control over her until she was 21. It took all the
force of both father and mother to get this obstro-
polous maiden into a waggonette, and “ so home ”
—as old Pepys would write. It is to be hoped that,
when got home, she will not be so ill-treated as
Mrs. Kelly has been by her only son. This dutiful
child has been sent to trial for keeping his mother
in a wild-beast state within barred doors and win-
dows. Unwashed, half-fed, and wholly unoared
for, the poor old woman has been for years con-
fined in a way likely enough to produce the state
of mania she was wrongly alleged to be suffering
from.
California has many wonderful products,
but surely none so marvellous as a fish that has the
power of inflating itself like a balloon. A San
Francisco paper tells a sad story about a crane
that swallowed one of those fish in a collapsed
state, but it had not gone 50ft. above the surface
of the lake who a the fish expanded enough to ex-
plode the crane, which went off like the bang of a
gun, after which the fish came lightly down on
the water none the worse for its short ride ia tha
air. The editor, of course, personally vouches for
the strict acouraoylof this story. Pass the zither;—
Why should we at such a gnat strain.
When we swallow camels daily,
Sure they tell the truth of that crane,
Though the story’s rather “ Whaley
“ Like a whale,” you understand us;
Much that story one resembles,
Sceptic, Infidel, please brand us
If we say that man dissembles;
If we whisper that his story,
Like history, is somewhat doubtful.
Cover him with gleaming glory,
For of truth he’s just about full.
But—and mark us-do you gamble,
Half-a-crown quite gladly we’d owe.
Betting that on its last ramble,!
That crane picked up our lost torpedo.
Touching the supposed Portuguese vessel
which was seize! by the Custom authorities at
Cooktown the other day on an alleged charge of
piracy, the real facts of the case show that the
matter has been somewhat unduly mixed. Im-
primis, the bold pirate is not a Portuguese trader
at all, but belongs to a Melbourne man, Mr. T. G.
Leslie, Secretary of the Brighton Gas Company.
She was despatched last March to the South Seas
on a pearling and heche-de-mer expedition. Pre-
vious to this she was known as a British craft, the
Albert, but at the time the war scare was on, the
owner, to secure her against possible capture by a |
Russian cruiser, went to the Portuguese Consul in
Melbourne and requested that the vessel might be
allowed to run under the flag of Portugal. After
some demur on the Consul’s part this was at length
agreed to. The difficulty remained that the
nationality of the vessel could not be altered so
long as she belonged to a British subject, and a
dummy sale was therefore effected to Mr. Carlos
Straus, of the Patent office, who Is a Portuguese
subject. The necessary proceedings being then
settled, eha sailed for the South Seas, flying the
Portuguese flag. Then came the news of the out-
rages and her subsequent seizure at Cooktown.
Now the case is to be Investigated in Melbourne,
where the owner will be called upon to answer a
charge of fraud for transferring the vessel in the
manner described, the craft being liable, under
these circumstances, to be forfeited to the
Crown.
A Melbourne correspondent writes us:—
“The Trades Unions are going to govern us all
sooner or later. The leaders of these organisa-
tions should, however, remember that a * trade ’
means a calling of skilled labour—something to
which an apprenticeship has to bo served. The
’bus-drivers should have minded that also when
making their abortive strike last August. The
wharf-labourers of will go near to
making a similar blunder, I opine. What skill is
wanted in putting cargo into a ship or taking it
out at the wharf-side ? We did all that ourselves
when landing here 33 years ago—and we could do
it again at a pinch. The strike of the wharf-
labourers is only helping to swell emigration to
Victoria, which may thus get its million of inhabi-
tants before N.S.W. does. Fifty labourers are
coming from Adelaide, and 200 more from New
Zealand, thus illegitimately helping to win the
race for a million between the two colonies. It
looks like a ‘put-dp thing’ in this aspect.”
But we don’t blame the wharf labourer for trying
to get as good pay as possible. A wharf-labourer’s
physical strength which must be great to
enable him to toll, is bis only capital. He
does not enjoy steady employment, and some-
times has very heavy work at Bight. Not
one man out of 50 is allowed by Nature
to handle hundredweight and two hundredweight
burdens with Impunity day after day and year
after year. The man who does this can often be
seen at the hospital very sick and without a cent
in his pocket, He tells the surgeon that he has
" strained himself,” Then the end soon oomea.
To Sir H—P—.
How soon the world's deceived by noise and show!
Alas! how different to pretend and know.
Like some poor highway brook, pretence runs
loud ;
Bustling, but shallow, dirty, weak and proud.
Whilst, like some nobler stream, true knowledge
glides.
Silently strong, and its deep bed still hides.
A.H.T.
They are beginning to cry for a National
Bank in Adelaide. Most of the depression over
there is attributed to tho fact that monetary insti-
tutions have possession of nearly ali the title-
deeds of the land. O wners can neither release nor
get further advances. Stagnation like the pre-
sent, continued for any length of time, will be as
ruinous to the banks as to their debtors. So far,
the banks won’t see that, and theory fora bank
that will take in the whole situation appears to
have reason in It. One of the worst features in
the financial condition of Adelaide is that few of
the directors of the loc \1 banking companies are
identified by residence with the interests of the
colony. Three have no local directors whatever.
A new way to pay old debts has been
invented by Alexander M‘£night, an extensive
owner of property in Edinburgh. One of his
tenants, a young man named Hutton, being back-
ward in his payments, the old man Invited him to
call at his house. Hutton, suspecting nothing,
did so, when Mao proceeded to read a “chapter,’*
which dwelt chiefly on the necessity of self-discip-
line, and the advantages of early castigation. This
preliminary over, he invited his tenant to strip
and kneel down at a chair. Hutton’s clothes
being very shabby, he fancied that Ws landlord
intended to present him with a new suit* and was
about to preface his induction into the now gar-
ments with prayer; ho consequently complied
with this singular request. He was immediately
seized by M/Knight, who bound him to the chair,
and commenced to use a small cane most vigor-
ously about his nether parts, Hutton being at first
too much surprised to resist. However, not being
altogether satisfied with this application of Scrip-
ture-teaching to even day use, he, after a struggle,
succeeded in escaping. His next step was to pull
M'Knlght before a magistrate, by whom the
defendant was fined 30s. and costs, his liberal
Biblical quotations notwithstanding. As the fine
was so small, it Is however likely that the magis-
trate was influenced to some extent by the plead-
ing of the defendant. It does not appear that the
flogger Invited the floggee to partake of
“ whusky ” either before or after the castigation.
Here his system differs from that legalised in
N.S.W. Possibly he considered that in his pre-
liminary exhortation he administered sufficient
spiritual stimulant to render the use of an alco-
holic pick-me-up unnecessary. We recommend
this story to the “ flogging Governments ” of the
colonies. A chaplain attends criminals on the
scaffold, why should not a clerical gentleman also
prepare the minds of those about to be flogged ?
The reading of judiciously-selected passages of
Holy Writ might seem to lend Divine authority to
the proceedings and place them under the direct
patronage of Providence.
During the war with Peru, when most of
the able-bodied Chilian males were mustered to
defend their ’artbs and 'omes, it was Imperative
upon the authorities that girls should be employed
as check-takers on the tram cars. They were so
employed. Let us quote from the Chilian
Mill “ They are usually girls from 20 to 35,
dressed in natty uniforms and jaunty Panama
hats and white pinafores. Consequently it is not
surprising that street-car riding has become a
popular amusement with young men about
town.” Quite so, we can easily imagine how the
pinaforelwould fetch the boys. Lord bless us, we
too, were young once. There is a joke concealed
in the above line. It is hermetically concealed.
We will give an order on Kirby for a gilt-edged
coffin for the solver who can solute the same.
And now we shall sing. Pass the foghorn, James,
sound G. All sing:—
Riding on the tramway,
Happy, gay, and free,
Riding on the tramway,
That’s the game for me.
The modest sum of threepence
Is all you have to pay,
For doing the la-de-da-dl
On the new tramway.
When our Mary drives the engine.
And Dora takes the checks.
We are happy (as we should be).
What should then our spirit vex.
And ’twill solve the curious problem
How to make “them engines” pay
When they put some she-conducfcors
On the Sydney new tramway.

TOUR PHOTO-If you are
undecided where to go to
obtain an artistic and really truth-
ful potograph of yourself, ac-
cept what is but well-meant
counsel, and pay first a visit to
the vestibule leading to the Bur-
lington Galleries in the Sydney
Arcade. There you can inspect an
arrayof portraiture, not of select-
ed specimens, but the every-day
work of Creelman and Co., which
for artistic execution and elegant
finish, couple with moderation
in price, ought at once to deter-
mine your choice in their favour.
You will thereby be but endors-
Ing the almost universal opinion that In all the
foregoing excellencies C. and Co hold quite a
unique position as potographers.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
* There are two in the race," said the trainer, “ to-
day—
That bay horse of Johnson’s and Dick Allen's
grey.
Keep on the bay’s quarter, he’s reckoned a
. snorter;
And mind that grey Norma don’t get far away.
You go straight when the flag falls, and sail to
the front,
But keep pace in the mare for the ‘ heel of the
hunt ’;
They can pass if Inclined to, those two give
your mind to;
Let the bay force the running and bear the first
brunt.
“ I’ll be down at the turning, the second time
round,
Should I hold my right hand up get over the
ground;
If you’re there with bay Plantar, you’ll win
in a canter.
There’s the ‘ Go to the post,”’ as the ball gave
its sound.
'* Now, good-bye, keep your head cool, and mind
what I say—
Let the bay try the hurdles, you keep wllh the
grey;
Make a run from the starter, they'll all travel
smarter,
You can fall back when most of the ruck get
away.”
1 At the post Winter kept us five minutes or
more,
Then the fl«g fell, and off dashed the coloured
half-score;
On my black Nora mounted, the moments I
counted,
Then from out the crush sailing I went to the
fore.
How my black Irish beauty Jumped at (he word
. “go”;
I raced hard at the hurdles (the first one was
low).
Like a deer she bounced over, scarce marking
the clover,
Then I took a pull at her—it riled her I know.
Like a flash Norma passed uB, bay Planter dashed
by,
And The Dutchman and Rocket bard held caught
my eye;
f rode just as the ruck did, strode strong as
. The Buck did,
He was sneaking a point to get by “ on the sly.’
The fitst mile was done quickly, a cracker the
pace,
Though each nag kept his feet in that half of the
race?
With a crash went a hurdle, I don’t speak a
word ill.
But had riding stopped Rocket from getting a
place.
i got through where the gap was, and just at the
bend.
The Buck struck on the hurdles, rolled end over
end;
Young Dick Thornton was under, net hurt for
a wonder—
He was up ere the crowd its assistance could
lend.
The grey mare and bay Planter were making
, their run,
I was lying back waiting and watchitig the fun;
At the turn, as be stated, Dick’s signal I waited,
When I got it she sped like a shot from a gun.
But three clear lengths In front Skylark clouted
the sticks,
And The Dutchman came down like a dray-load
of bricks;
Though he just put his toes on, he landed his
nose on,
Broke his neck, and I passed as he gave his last
kicks.
Then I raced to the leaders and started for home*
Far my beauty but waited the asking to come;
When we challenged old Planter, he answered
instanter,
And grey Norma “ ’mid Homans proved worthy
of Rome.”
But two hurdles to fly ere the straight run was
Bide by sid’e we crossed one like a triplet of deer,
Our silks interblended, the race neirly ended.
We could hear from the stand the dense multi-
tude cheer.
We were riding as men do when riding to win.
Our heads cool, our hands steady, no flutter
within;
Each one waiting his chances, as forward he
glances,
Bre he drives the hooks deep in his thorough-
bred’s skin.
But ten yards from the hurdle we strode stride
for stride,
H would give half my life could I now have that
ride);
The Stand darkly looming, the hoarse voices
booming,
Like the roar on the rocks of the incoming life.
1 could hear the crowd shouting, “The grey
mare’s ahead,”
TfcoUgh 1 knew at that moment my black Nora
fed;
M Old Planter must win it, there’s nothing ehe
in it,”
But crash into the hurdle hay Planter dropped
dead.
‘Then but Nora and Norma were left in the
straight,
And the whips whistled sharp as we dashed past
the gate;
At the distance-post racing, ’twas lightnlag
speed pacing.
Though I felt my black beauty was stopped by
the weight.
At my stirrup was Norma, neck out and head
down,
And I saw on the face of her rider a frown;
He rode like a master, I could not stride faster,
And I thought, on the post, he would just wear
me down.
But I called to my beauty, and cheered and
laughed gay.
For I knew she was doing her best all the way ;
The whip was now idle—the band of her bridle
Just was clear on the post of the head of the
grey.
That one day and victory still dwells in my heart,
Though I’m not as I then was—neat, limber, and
smart;
Fortune treated me sadly, my mare she used
badly,
For black Nora now runs in a fish-hawker's cart.
Lines supposed to be written after the
death of sir George Grey, K.C.B., about
the year 1920.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A man he waa to all New Zealand dear,
Her greatest statesman ne, for many a year;
Boldly he strove the people s wrongs to right.
And stem the growing tide of selfish might.
Determined ever bravely to withstand
The selfish crew who stole the people’s land.
Egregious race, long;cursed in every clime.
Whose doom he prophesied in words sublime;
For land monopoly, though now a crime.
Was thsn a lawful business of the time.
Greater than Grey, the people’s champion true.
Ne’er since his day our fair Zealandia knew.
His matchless eloquence entranced the crowd,
And Fame her trumpet blew before him loud.
In vain his foes, with spite and envy stung,
Yelped out their malice, curlike, at his heel;
Justice and Truth were ever on his tongue,
His only care the people’s woe or weal.
Knightly his bearing, pure in word and deed
Was he, without one taint of selfish greed.
Loved he his country well, his new-found land.
Twin isles, sea girt, with lakes and rivers grand;
Mountains sublime, capped with eternal snow,
And fertile vales, green smiling, far below,
New Zealand height—now grown a mighty state,
Thanks to the wisdom of her statesmen great.
O’er all her fertile plains pure breezes blow,
And peace and plenty all her people know ;
Progressing still In every skilful art,
To please the eye and to enthral the heart.
Queenly she reigns, Pacific seis among.
Where many poets have her praises sung.
Bests here her patriot, for his work Is o’er,
His aged form we now shall see no more ;
Still Is the voice, and mute the lips that long
(With words more eloquent than poet’s song)
Taught such grand lessons, both to rich and poor—
Lessons that shall for ages long endure.
Useful and glorious was the life he led
From early youth, until his snowy head
Victorious rose above his hundredth year,
And then ho calmly, sweetly, passed away,
When his life’s work was finished. Shed no tear,
But strew these wild flowers on his Silent tomb.
Xerxes wept much a century’s work to trace,
When all his mighty host had met their doom.
Yet one more name will men for long revere.
That name is thine, renowned, immorlal Grey,
Zephyrs sweep gently o’er thy resting place.

Rev. Father Wilds’
EXPERIENCE.
The Bev. Z. P. Wilds, well-known city
missionary in New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court, writes
as follows:
“78 E. M th St., New TorJe, May 16,1882.
Messes. J. C. Ayer & Co., Gentlemen :
Last winter I was troubled with a most
uncomfortable itching humor affecting
more especially my limbs, which itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that I could scarcely bear any clothing
over them. I was also a sufferer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; my
appetite was poor, and my system a good
deal run down. Knowing the value of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it for the
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first dose. After
a short time the fever and itching were
allayed, and all signs Of irritation of the
skin disappeared. My catarrh and cough
were also cured by the same means, and
my general health greatly improved, until
it is now excellent. I feel a hundred per
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of the Sarsaparilla, which
I recommend with all confidence as the
best blood medicine ever devised. I took
it in small doses three times a day, and
used, in all, less than two bottles, I place
these facts at your service, hoping their
publication may do good.
, Yours respectfully, Z, P. WILDS.”
The above Instance is bpt one of the many
constantly coming to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla to the cure of all diseases arising
from impure or impoverished blood, and a
weakened vitality.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
cleanses, enriches, and strengthens the blood,
stimulates the action of the stomach and
bowels, and thereby enables the system to
resist and overcome the attacks of all Scrofu-
lous Diseases, Eruptions of the Skin, Rheu-
matism, Catarrh, General Debility, and all
disorders resulting from poor or corrupted
blood and a low state of the system.

TOOTH BRUSH.
Ladies or Gentlemen who wish to quickly and

or moustache, by a new method, or to possess
sound, white teeth and rosy gums are invited
to read the brief but interesting descrip-
tion of these new inventions

Electric Appliances are now

GREAT
ANNOYANCE
has been caused
to all people using
tooth brushes by the
bristles coming out in
the mouth. The Pall
Mall Electric Associ-
ation now take pleasure
in introducing to the Aus-
tralian public a Tooth Brush, which they
guarantee free from this troublesome defect.
The bristles are inserted in the handle by a
patent process, which renders it simply
impossible to come out in use. In ad-
dition to this, the handle of the Brush is
made of a newly invented material perma-
nently charged with an electro-magnetic
current, which acts without any shock
immediately upon the nerves and tissues
of the teeth and gums. The act of
brushing causes this current to flow
into the nerve cells and roots of
the teeth, and, like water poured
upon a plant, it invigorates and
vitalizes o\*cry part, arresting
decay, building up and re-
storing the natural white-
ness of the enamel and
quickly producing
healthful, rosy-
coloured gums.
The handle Is strong,
beautifully polished,
not affected by acids,
Impervious to
moisture, and free
from that un-
pleasant musty
odour exu-
ding from
wet bone
handles.
THE
PALL MAUL
Electric
ASSOC/A TIOIf
1
Now offer to the Aus-
tralian public their new
Electric Hair, Beard &
Moustache Curler. It
is a handsome article, nickel-
plated, with an ebonized handle, and it
should occupy a place in the toilet of
every lady and gentleman in Australia.
By its aid, the hair, beard, or moustache
can be curled in any desired style in from
one to two minutes. For ladies, it produces
the “ Langtry Style,” the “ Patti Bang,” the
“Montague Curl,” and any other styles
desired by ladies wearing their hair in the
fashionable “loose and fluffy” mode.
Those who wear waves or other forms
of artificial hair will find this Electric
Curler a very useful article. It does
not break off and rum the hair,
like the ordinary crimping pro-
cess, and in we* or hot weather
it works as quickly as in cold.
For curling the Moustache
or Beard in a moment, it
has no equal, while it is
so simple in its opera-
tion that any one of
either sex cart* use it
successfully the first
time.
Directions
accompany
each Curler.

A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
" Murdbbl" The terrible word rang in nay ears,
and whirled through my brain, until I thought l
should go raving mad from the mere horror’Of
it. “ Murder 1” and a hand was laid on my
Shoulder, and a grave voice exclaimed, You are
my prisoner I” My heart almost stood still, my
pulse momentarily cessed to heat; the mere
horror of my position came to me with suon
appalling consciousness, that if 1 had actually
committed the deed, I could not have shown more
shrinking, horrified terror. . , .. .
Let me recall the incidents of that dreadful
night in the order in which they occurred—those
incidents, the memory of which, even now, alter
the lapse of months, oomes back to me with.a sense
of unconquerable horror and affright.
lam connected with the Sydney Daily News
as a travelling reporter, and as part of my duties,
found myself, almost at a moment’s notice, des-
patched at a late hour of the night to one of the
most important up-country towns, In order to
report on a political meeting that was to be held
there the next day. Directions as to the carrying-
out of m jLtask were carefully impressed on me
by the Editor-in-charge, and, according to in-
structions, I set out from the office in order to
catch the train leaving at 10 minutes after
midnight. By an awkward mishap my watch had
lost five minutes, and I arrived at the station just
in time to see the train I wished to catch, slowly
moving away. Under these circumstances, all
that was left to me was to catch the next.
Consulting the time-table, I found that the
next train did not leave until six next morning,
but I knew if I caught tbit I should still have
time to fulfil the Important duty I bad been en-
trusted with. How to pass the few intervening
hours was the next question. My home was at
Woollahra, and it was no use entertaining the idea
of returning there for a few hours’ rest. I de-
termined, therefore, to go to an hotel for the
short time that was at my disoosal. The principal
hotel of the neighbourhood I found closed, and
knocking failing to elicit an answer, I left It to
look for another. A light streaming from a par-
tially-closed door attracted my attention, and
looking up, saw that it came from a mediocre-
looking public-house, with "Angel Hotel pointed
across the front. The place did not look inviting,
but as the time at my disposal was short, and as
1 merely meant to throw myself, dressed as I was.
on the bed and snatch a few hours’ sleep, I entered
and asked if I could be provided with a bed.
The landlord, who appeared himself, answered
In the affirmative, and snowed me into a plainly-
furnished bedroom on the first floor.
"It’s a double-bedded room,” he said, and
there’s a gentleman in the other bed. But he’s
asleep and won’t disturb you.”
The room looked comfortable and clean, and I
was tired to death, and so, impressing on the land-
lord the fact that I wished to bs called at half-past
5 in the morning precisely, I shut the door after
his retreating form, and taking off my outer
garments and placing them on a chair near at
hand, threw myself, half-dressed, on the bed.
I slept soundly, but woke with a start when it
was only half light, my mind full of the Idea that
I was on the point of missing the train again.
Looking at my watch, I
found it was barely 5
o’clock ; whilst the silence
that reigned through-out
the house betokened the
fact that nobody was yet
about. It was no use going
tofsleep again, and full of
the idea of the Impcrtance
of not missing my train a
second time, I sprang out
of hed and began to dress
myself. On approaching
the dressing-table, I saw
lying on it a silver watch
and chain, together with a
large heap of money—some
of it gold, but the greater
part silver. It evidently be-
longed to the man in the
other bed. He appeared
to be still asleep, and the
bed-clothes seemed to be
heaped somewhat strangely
round him, so as almost to
hide him from view.
Wondering at the care-
lessness that could leave
so much money at the
mercy of any chance per-
son who might happen to
enter, as I was about to
leave the room I thought I
would venture to give him
a word of warning as to
the ohanoe of getting his
property stolen. The cor-
ner in which his bed was
situated was darker than the part of the room
which I had occupied and which was lighted by
the window; so that I could see nothing but the
bare outline of the man on the bed.
Placing my hand on his shoulder, I gave him a
gentle shake. He moved heavily under my hand,
but without seeming to waken. Bending down in
the semi-obscurity for the purpose of seeing
whether he was drunk—which seemed to be the
ease—l saw that which caused me to utter a cry of
horror and start back, terror-stricken, from the
man was dead, with his throat out almost
from ear to ear 1
I was so paralysed by this terrible discovery that
my blood seemed to freeze in my veins. I put my
hand to my forehead with a feeling of unutterable
horror, but a certain clamminess in its touch
caused me to take it away again with irrepressible
loathing. It was red with blood from contact with
the gory shirt of the dead man. Looking down,
I saw with affright that I was standing in a pool of
blood, that had dripped from the pendent cover-
let. At this horrible discovery my terror became
all the more overpowering, and starting back in
unutterable horror, I rushed madly from the room.
There was nobody about, and I plunged wildly
down the narrow stairs and into a small parlour,'
the door of which stood ajar. Falling almost un-
conscious oa to the sofa, 1 buried my face in my
hands, trying to banish the terrib e picture of the
blood-stained corpse upstairs Ithat thrust its -If
before my gaze. Gradually my mind became more
composed, and I in a measure recovered trom
the first overmastering horror the discovery had
aroused in me. ...
The man was dead; my glance, brief as it was,
had shewn me that. In all probability he had been
dead some hours. But whether it was a case of
murder or suicide, I knew nothing about it, abso-
lutely nothing. A neighbouring clock striking
half-past five suddenly reminded me of my mission.
Mv thoughts all at once underwent an entire
revolution. If I lost the six o’clock train I should
be too late for the object I had in hand. If I failed
to send in my report by the specified time, in all
urobablllty 1 should get dismissed, for I had had
ho business to miss the night train. A wife and
family depended on my exertions; I was bound to
consider them above everything. And supposing
t was actually suspected *f murdering my fellow-
lodger ? It was poselble. I was in the room at the
time—his watch and money might be thought a
tflitiotlng bait—the landlord might swear that the
man was alive when he showed me into the room;
iinder any circumstance*, It would mean delay.
a «these disjointed thoughts coursed through my
mind 1 rose from the sofa, and hesitated between
miking for the front door or alarming the house.
a thought of my delicate wife and three children,
ell dependent on me, decided me; and vowing to
miraalf in order to quieten my conselenoe, that, on
my«t’urn to Sydney. I would go boldly to the
authorities, and tell all I knew of the terrible
?Mi»edv I softly made my way to the front door,
unlatched it, and stepped Into the street. The
fresh morning air revived me wonderfully, and
with one fearful glance round, I walked swiftly
along the deserted street in the direction of the
®*But I'had not proceeded a hundred yards when
I was conscious of a hurried step behind me. In
a sudden— almost puerile-burst of unreasoning
fear I broke into a quicker walk, thpn info a run;
but the hurried step behind me oame nearer and
nearer; and a man, rushing violently against me
threw me down, and then sprang on, top of me.
It was the landlord of the inn. Breathless and
panting, he grasped me by the collar.
" I’ve got you,” he gasped. “ Gome on back with
me."
With a docility that was born of unreasoning
terror I made no answer. I offered no remark. My
brain whirled with the terror and affright that the
horror of my position aroused in me. Without a
word I accompanied him back to the hotel. With-
out a word I allowed myself to be shut up in the
parlour I had before entered; only when a quar-
ter of an hour later, a stern policeman entered the
room, and, laving his hand heavily on my shoulder
exclaimed: “ I arrest you for the murder of the
man upstairs. You are my prisoner;” I turned
blankly round, and fell swooning to the ground.
How the remainder of that terrible day passed
I know not, but at the Inquest next morning I
was brovght out, the object of the execration and
curses of the assembled crowd. My powers of
mind and speech seemed to be entirely numbed at
the horror of my position. Mechanically, I lis-
tened to the evidence; unmeaningly fell question
and answer on my ears. _
The landlord was the chief witness. He deposed
to my having come to the hotel in a state of ex-
citement the night previous to the discovery of
the body—to my having asked for a bed —and to
my having been nut in the same room with the
murdered man. He deposed further to the man
having been alive, to the best of his belief, when
he showed me into the room. He swore to seeing
blood on my hands and face and on my clothes,
and to seeing further traces of blood in the par-
lour at the foot of the stairs. He swore to my
having left the house surreptitiously before any
of the inmates were about, to his having pursued
me, and to my having fled when I heard his foot-
steps. He furthermore swore that he was the
first to enter the bedroom after I had left it—that,
coming to wake me at the appointed time in the
morning, he had heard the front door shut at the
very moment when he made the terrible discovery
that the man in the bed in the corner was lying
there with his throat out. The landlord’s evidence
was damning and conclusive.
The policeman, next called, deposed to his hav-
ing been called in at the Angel Hotel at a quarter
to six, that he had there found the body ot a man
with his throat out, and that the landlord had
accused me of the murder. He gave evidence
that in the execution of his duty he had made
examination of the place. He swore that on toe
bed of the dead man he had found a razor with the
name of the maker (Hocklns) engraved on the
blade, and that in the bag of the accused he had
found a case containing two razors of a similar
make, with an empty space for a third. He swore
to having searched me, and to having found in my
possession a watch and chain, the former of which
had engraved on it the name of Heaton, and that
the same name was found written in a pocket-
book found in the coat pocket of the deceased.
The landlord, re-called, swore to having seen the
watch in the possession of the dead man. Other
witnesses called deposed to my suspicious
flight, to my guilty fear, to my overpowering
terror.
The evidence was thus strongly confirmed. So
damning in character and so appalling was It, that I

had not the courage to avow my innocence, to
swear that if the razor that had done the dreadful
deed was similar to mine it was but by a terrible
coincidence—that one out of my case was at that
moment at the’outlera being re-set. That, if I had
taken the murdered man’s watch and chain in
mistake for my own, it was explainable only by
the overpowering horror that had taken hold of
me at the time. I could have said that—and per-
haps, despite my unreasoning terror, would; but,
a* I endeavoured to make an almost superhuman
effort to recover myself and assert my innocence-
praise be to God I—my vindication came from
another source.
In the midst of the proceedings, a man in a state
of the greatest excitement entered the room
abruptly, and, making his way hastily to the
coroner, handed him a letter.
“ This bears on the case,” he said, deeply. “ Read
.it.”
The coroner took the letter and glanced over it.
All at once he looked up with a different air.
“This throws a different light on the subject,”
he said, “ifit is genuine. Gentlemen of the Jury,
listen to this.”
“*Dbab James,— This is to inform you that
£lO being all I have left in the world out of
the £13,000 the sale of my station brought me,
and as I am thoroughly broken in health
by that accursed drink, I have determined to
commit suicide. I have nobody to consider
but you and myself, and I hope you will for-
give me. When you receive this I shall be a
dead man—killed by my own hand. Pray for
me, and forgive, your loving brother,
“ * J. Heaton.’ ”
“ I am his brother,” said the man, brokenly,
“ and this morning I received that letter.”
I was free. After some legal preliminary to
prove the genuineness of the letter, I was free. I
lost neither position nor standing; but such an
impression did the terrible circumstance make
upon me that I cannot even now—after the lapse
of months—thlnkjof it without the deepest dread.

Gentlemen,—My wife had a severe attack of
Rheumatism, which flitted from joint to joint, for
more than a week, when a friend (In my absence
from home) recommended St. Jacob’s Oil, amd
after two or three applications according to the
instruction* given, she found herself, much to her
surprise and delight, entirely free from pain, and
now always keeps a bottle of the Oil In the bouse.
I am, sir.

IN AN OBSERVATORY.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The Melbourne Argus has been for many weeks,
months, past, publishing controversial letters on
the "Westminster Confession of Faith.” The
groundwork of the creed of Christendom is ques-
tioned therein, as If it were still ail a matter of
doubt and debate. Much of this reads as of the
old controversies on the theological subject* when
It was seriously debated as to what number of angels
could dance on a needle’s point. To common
sense It reads all as does the tediously long trial
of the Tiohborne claimant. Everything in that
case depended upon an assumption, and the little
things that comd be adduced in support of the
truth of it. These minor matters were brought
forward and worried in argument to endless
length, and so with the matters of the “ West-
minster Confession of Faith.” There is no end to
this sort of thing, and it is all as of the dark ages
and of their debates to read of it
Muddled with the matters discussed by Messrs.
Sutherland, Thomson, and Rentoul, we visit an
an Observatory in the holiday-time that Christ-
mas affords for such purpose. The astronomer-
in-chief happens to be alone on the occasion, so
that there is timely opoortunity tor a chat.
" What is science ? ” we ask. He answers,
" The discovery of Nature’s laws, and tracing
their results ”
" What is astronomy ? ”
“ Gathering knowledge of Nature by observa-
tions and deducing the results.”
"Tennyson, in his latest poem, tells us that
‘ many a planet by many a sun may roll with the
dust of a vanished race.’ What does astronomy
teach as to that Is it a scientific truth, or merely
poetical language ?’-
“ True enough 1 Planets are living things like
ourselves. They have their youth, maturity, old
age, decay and death. There are planets observable
by the astronomer in all theio stages. Mars, for
instance, is in a decaying stage—the waters are
drying up. The decay of animal and vegetable
life will f oilo n upon this. The planet then becomes
again what It once was -unfit for life. It dries up
to the condition of a burnt out cinder. In count-
less millions of years it triturates away into
meteoric duit—no atmosphere offering then an im-
pediment to Its doing so.”
“ Is life on all planets alike ?”
“It must necessarily be very different I The
constituents of a planet differ, and so must its pro-
ducts. What lives on one planet could not exist
on another. The men of Mars would necessarily
be of a cast-iron make, compared with the men of
our earth. We exist in an atmosphere pressing so
many pounds to every square inch of our bodies.
In any other differently-constituted atmosphere
we should perish.”
"The life of one olanet could not then be trans-
ferred to another ?”
" Not unless that other was similarly constituted,
which is most unlikely, and indeed altogether im-
probable, if not impossible.”
“ Have you considered what such statements
lead to?” ,
“ Such is our constant study 1”
“ Everything born of a planet dies with it, you
say. Our world becomes, like other worlds, a
burnt out cinder I”
" Yes; that will be the end of It some millions of
year* to cornel”
" Does the life animating us come from this
planet 7”
“ Yes I—much as electricity doei!”
“Nothing of this world can be passed on to
another world 7”
“ No I and it could not exist there if there were
any means of passing it on. We live in an atmos-
phere—as fish do in the water ; with the rarefloa-
cation of that atmosphere we breathe with diffi-
culty—as on mountain top*. Outside that atmos-
phere we die.”
" What medium is there between worlds ?”
" No atmosphere, no medium, nothing but space
and absolute void.”
“ Electricity could not travel then beyond the
world producing it ?”
“ Nothing of the product of a world could leave
it. Generated of the world to which It belongs it
is part of it, and dies with it.”
“ Bear with me for the next question—what be-
comes of the life of this world ?”
“ I have told you it dies with it I”
“ What is the object of creation then ? Why are
all these myriads of worlds made ?”
"It is the law of Nature to make things grow
and decay—to live and die. Countless worlds and
all that is upon them are doing this at all times.”
“ And to no purpose ?”
“ No purpose that astronomers can divine.”
"See what you have led up to I You and I are
to perish with this world of which we are part.
Our life dies with it. What about the soul ?”
“ You ask me scientific queitions, and I answer
them. Science teaches nothing about the soul.”
" I see. You shirk that question.”
“No, I don’t! If the soul be of this world’s pro"
duction, as it must be, scientifically considered, it
must die with the world. I apprehend that what
von mean by a soul is the assumption of theo-
logians who cannot demonstrate its existence.”
n Why do they teach its existence, then ?”
“ It is the best paying butiness so to do-all over
the world. If no money could be made by
theology it would soon cease to bo taught. Re-
ligion Is a means of government, and one of the
chief product* and regulator* of civilization.
Morally, it is our greatest help to keeping order.
Scientifically, it is to be disregarded.”
Wiser, but very much sadder, we take our leave
of the observatory and its astronomer. We have
matter for much thought In the hour or so of In-
formation there obtained. The controversy on
the Westminster Confession of Faith no longer
muddles us, however. We understand now all
about it, and the reasons for propounding It and
for arguing in support of its absurdities—there is
money in it!
AUSTRAL.
“Fac Ne Fac."
This little book is addressed to mothers and
teachers, and 1s dedicated to Mrs. Barry, of
Bishopsoourt. This prepares the reader for the
announcement that it is all about guns. The title
is queer, but when looked at thoughtfully, it will
be found to mean " Do—Don’t.” The author pro-
poses to teach boys and girls how to handle guns.
The peculiarities of the old single-barrel, double-
barrel, and breech-loader are described in terms
which a boy of average intelligence can follow.
We don’t care about the notion of teaching girls
how to shoot. We think it quite time enough
for them to begin to learn shooting when they are
able to throw a stone straight. The author takes
high ground In putting the shot-bag and powder
flask into their hands. He says :—" Taking into
account the smallness of our population and the
danger of invasion by a very superior force, a
regiment of Australian girls with their high
courage would give a very good account of them-
selves,” Such a contingency is possible. He
who conjures up possibilities and proceeds
to draft plans of action, to checkmate evils
that are barely possible is an intellectual
ruminant. At page 17 the author very properly
describes pigeon-shooting as a sport fit only for
lame legs or black-legs. At page 38 he makes
himself personally responsible for the truth of the
statement that on a station in the country a gun
barrel was used as a poker for nine years and had
bean charged all the time. For the rest he sticks
tight to his topic, and writes a book every boy
should read.
Positively the very last of the Melbourne
Cup stories runs as follows: A guileless youth,
who had seen better days in the capacity of tele-
graph master across the border, and who had
made himself perfect iu the art of "taking by
sound,” being lounging round in an inland town,
hit upon a capital idea of raising the wind.
Sauntering up to the window of the local tele-
graph office, prior to the hour the Cup was run
for, he asked the clerk for the Postal Guide, for
the ostensible purpose of keeping the window
open so that he could hear plainly when the wires
flashed the result along. Presently there came
the clicks . . “ Sheet.” Skipping off
at once he slouched into the bar of a sporting
pub., where a goodly crowd of the talent were
waiting for the news, and after a time he ventured
to observe he "had a presentiment that Sheet
Anchor would do the trick;” a remark which was
received with shouts of derisive laughter, and
sundry exclamations such as, "Sheet Anchor, be
blowed.” ‘ Hasn’t got a 100 to 1 show.” "Couldn’t
win a stick race.” “Time you swore off,”
&o. The smart young man took all in good
part, however, merely remarking that he be-
lieved in presentiments, and he wouldn’t mind
backing this one for a
"fiver.” A few seconds
later he stood to win £l3O,
and when the telegram was
at last posted in the bar
announcing Sheet Anchor’s
win, the losers paid up,
and drank the winner’s
health, amidst such re-
marks 8S “ Bigor, he was
plucky.” “Who’d 1 a
thought it?” "Must have
had the straight griffin
that time,” etc. So he had;
and this reminds us that
there are many men knock-
ing round over here who
can stands on the foot-
paths in front of our tele-
graph offices and read
every word that passes
alosg the lines. Those who
remember the collossal pile
the Yankee operator,
Johnny Skae, made by
tapping the wires, and
standing in with a couple
of brokers during the Ne-
vada silver boom can see
what a neat thing in the
same line could be worked
over here, simply through
the parsimony or neglect
of the authorities in not
providing suitable rooms
in which the secrecy of
the “wires” could be en-
sured.
The wealthiest maiden lady in the United
States is-Miss Catherine Wolfe, She does not
centre her affections in a husband, but she has
aspirations all the same. She has determined to
discover the site of the Garden of Eden. For
this purpose she set apart about a year ago the
sum of £35,000, and the Rev. William Hayes Ward
was commissioned, like another Columbus, to
sail on a voyage of discovery. The reverend
gentleman has just returned to America after a
fruitless sojourn of 10 months at the sources of
the Tigris and Euprates. He reports that he
would most likely have been able to "spot” the
site of the celebrated garden but for the hind-
rances thrown in his way by the "unspeakable
Turk.” Miss Wolfe intends to fit out another
Eden expedition, and it goes without saying that
the Rev. Mr. Ward Is to revisit the Orient.—
Fair Miss Wolfe and Rev. Ward,
Spare yourself this useless search;
Know that superstition’s guard
Still shields the secrets of the Church.
Where the Tigris rolls its stream
Till it meets the Euphrates,
Eden—some old poets dream
Garden of pluperfect ease—
Flourished, Anno Mundi, One,
Blossomed for a little space,
When old Adam left, to run
First heat in the human race.
Nevermore he saw the site
Of the garden, why should you
Seek to throw your candle light
On what may, or not, be true ?
Feebly groping in the dark,
Ward and Wolfe, ’tia little good;
Noah when within the Ark
Saw Eden washed out by the flood.
