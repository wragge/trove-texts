RE-ECHOES
“WITH DEATH'S PROPHETIG" BEER.
Lay the bottle there beside rre : put the glass upon
the chair:
You’d better fill it up before you go:
For my hand’s a bit unsteady, and I wouldn’t
like to swear—
And if I spilt a drop I should, I know.
Ah ! many’s the good bottle I have buried to the
world
In obedience to an honest drinker’s code :
Now I’ve come to the last bottle that shall ever
wet my throttle,
And the dead marines are calling down the road.
Well, I’ve done my share of labour, and I’ve had
my share of fun,
And I’ve kissed my share of women in my time ;
And it warms me to. remember —now that I must
out and run—
The glorious sins committed in my prime.
For I followed all my instincts, and they never
led me wrong—
It’s refraining makes the thought of Death a
load :
O, the days of love and laughter—and the nights
that followed after!
And the dead girls are singing down the road.
J*m nearly day; but still...l’m happier when
wetter...
Remember that I honour you, my wife;
For a good girl is good, and a good mate is better,
But a good wife ’s the best thing in life...
I *m thinking of old times, my dear, before I mar-
ried you—
To you and them my last drink is owed :
“ Good-bye ! Here’s luck ! ” I pass ; and now
we’ll break the glass,
For the dead mates are beckoning down the road.
THE BANDY-COOT
[Our Nature Writer explains that this coot does
not come in his proper place in the advertised
series. This is due. partly to the fact that he is a
oasual and unexpected kind of coot, and partly
to our Nature Writer’s belief that he himself
was bom out of series, coming second where he
should have been first, and thus failing, according
to the law of primogeniture, to succeed to the
title and estates of his father, who was an English
noble of the highest degree, with the consequence
that he has to turn out early in the morning to
hunt coots for business instead of partridges for
pleasure, though this is nevertheless a satisfaction
to him, as, indeed, it should be to every person who
has come close to the Great Heart of Nature, which
is full of love and tenderness for the humblest
animal that crawls, and should be worshipped by
everyone who can afford it and sell bis impres-
sions to the newspapers like this.]
THIS BANDY-COOT
I WATCH him, artless and pure. He
browseth on the emerald grass and on
the kangaroo grass, knee-deep on the
sandstone tors. I hear him sing his
light soprano aria when he is cut out of a log
to feed my cattle-pup. I observe the moon
glint on his delicate coat of grey, shot
with silver, and he streaketh hastily
for safety when I sool the pup’s
mother after him. His eyes are brown
lakes, eloquent of his snout is
Eointed like a pig’s. Gaily he cometh to feed
l the grey evening on my swede-turnips,
and crieth tenderly to his mate as he
cometh, in a voice like a squeezed india-
rubber doll. His moans are.music ; his legs
are poetry in motion ; and his claws scratch
worse than a buckrabbit’s. Loving and
courageous is he; his flesh is fairly sweet
when not too old. His nest he buildeth
under low bushes, thatched snugly from the
storm, and every night he burroweth his
way into my corn-shed.
Lightly may shine the moon, gleaming
thro’ the forest; coldly the stars may burn,
set imperishable in the icy vault of blue;
but every evening the Bandy-coot will be
found awake and attending to business. The
weird noises of the Night surround us—the
throbbing of Great Nature’s heart pulsing
more deeply in the darkness ; listen closely,
and you may hear Bandy munching native
carrots, his favourite luxury. Birds of prey
flit to and fro ; noiselessly their wings and
beaks move, seeking their food. Low lieth
the Bandy-coot close to a log; he does n’t
like being snapped up for a mopoke’s
holiday. The Southern Cross, seen on
the horizon, riseth hour after hour,
till it dippef 7 toward the South, heralding
midnight: .-.all the Bandy-coot muncheth on.
Ever as trie hours pass questeth he for fresh
native carrots ; making his wife bring him
the juiciest she can find, whilst he huggeth
the sheltering log or bush, carefully letting
her take the chances.
Fair stands the cornshed by the river flat ;
full to o’er-brimining with the golden grain.
Listen close ! ye may hear the Bandy-coot
playing the devil among the corn-cobs ; or
squeaking with fright- as he heareth the
approaching carpet-snake. In the cocky’s
garden we shall find him where the spuds
grow, nibbling the tubers .-.rid leaving Ihe
stalk. So fards the Bandy—fairest of coots.
Loudly at eve the wind may roar, fiercely
tire rain may fall ; little careth the male
Bandy-coot; he rouseth his wife into the
rain to dig food, while he stayeth at home
and keepeth the nest warm for her return.
Such is true affection.
The age of the Bandy-coot man knoweth
not : some are tough enough to be a hun-
dred ; no amount of cooking will soften them.
His children he lovetli dearer than his wife :
usually eating them when about half-grown ;
in times of scarcity all his relations have to
go. In the day of Creation, Nature left a
wide gap between her masterpieces—the
wombat and porcupine. Into that gap, with
noble self-effacement, steppeth the Bandy-
coot.

AFTERMATH
Tramp ,*
Spring ? Is it Spring at last,
Here in this Austral land ?
Can it be that the Winter has passed ?
For up on the hill where leaves lie dead
The smile of the fresh young grass is spread ;
The wattles shimmer like frozen gold ;
And down in the valley in veils of snow
Like waiting brides the fruit-trees show;.
And the song of the swallow that just now rang
Is the song that last Spring’s swallow sang.
And now that the Spring has come,
I who am growing old,
I will give voice and sing !
It is Spring, it is Spring... But my voice is dumb,
And my heart that once rang can no more ring
Than, the song of the swallow that died last Spring.
O, the Austral Spring is coming, I can hear the
wild bees humming
And *the bell-bird in the ranges singing high,
And the blue wrens in the bramble by the creek
where oft I ramble
In the fragrant air beneath a sunny sky.
And tile wattle trees are stirring with the feathered
songsters whirring
As they seek the sparkling nectar from the bloom
That bedecks, the near and far land with a golden
tinted garland,
Right away to where the lofty mountains loom.
And above the fields of clover with the warm sun
shining over,
Mounting upward, ever upward, on the wing,
Soar the skylarks in their glory as they tell their.
Springtide story
In the stirring, thrilling chorus that they sing...
0, the Austral. Spring has found us, and 'fair
Nature smiles around us
In a brightly-spangled garb of green and gold ;
She has shed her old grey jacket that stood all the
winter racket,
And was woven by the fingers of the cold.
D.B.
Go to Australia ! when the Spring is near,
And listen to the magpie’s morning song
Swelling amid the ranges shrill and clear—
Eohoing through the stillness loud and long.
Wander along the river flats, where grows
The golden*wattle—loveliest of blooms:
All in a perfect yellow blaze, that glows .
Like cloth of gold from ancient Tyre’s looms.
In noontide’s heat go seek the shady banks
Of fern-fringed creeks, which gurgle on their way:
Where merry little waves, in laughing ranks,
Murmur like bees throughout the peaceful day.
When evening’s hush has settled on the land,
Go meet the milkmaid by the stockyard gate;
There you may speak her fair and hold tier hand—
What more can any man desire of Fate ?
MUNDALA.
Dear girls, the. Spring is come again
With almond-bloom and sprout of crops,
With violets that deck the lane
And bloom profuse in-drapers’ shops.
Come out ! come out! the wattle spoils
To shame your hair, tho’ dyed to-day ;
Put on your silks, delaines,, and voiles—
Where are the furs of yesterday ?
Skip out, with glint of lingerie ;
Unheeded let 1 Spring poets bleat
Of Austral land arid spangled sea :
Our Spring trips in with satin’d feet.
Nor empty-handed comes the maid,
But brings a yearly gift for each :
For Thirty brings she. Artful Aid,
For Seventeen the Bloom of Peach.
ANDYS.
As when across the blue eyes of a child,
Ruffles and darkens in that azure deep
A sudden blur of’tears—and wakes from sleep,
But leaves the tender features undefiled
From any lasting mark : so, ealm and mild,
Turns Winter into Spring—the wattles weep
Soft tears awhile, then from their branches peep
The golden tassels—close together piled—
As though the tree were plaflted on a reef
Of living gold, which, mounting thro’ its veins,
Bursts forth to show what wealth its roots immure,
And every swelling bud and dancing leaf
Sways to the music of remembered rains—
Winter’s finale and Spring’s overture 1
M.E.K.
Languor of waking holds the rested land,
And through grey scrub and o’er the bare red
plain
One steals with greening tread and magic hand
To spread Spring’s fleeting garment once again.
Beneath the ground Life’s vibrant pulse grown
strong,
Thrilling the seed and rootlet with its might,
Issues in springing grass and leafy song
And bursts in calyxed beauty on the sight.
Blow winds to which glad golden wattles lend
A sweetness that o’er leagues of plain is borne,
Where grass and wild geranium bend and bend
Till star-flowers Sliqiv-Has poppies thro’ the corn.
Oh, Spring-kissed Bush with blossom-beckoning
hands, °
Whose smile once caught, no other smile e’er
tames !
Dearest I love her when as now she stands—
The radiant Bride that tragic summer claims.

WOMWN AND EDUATION
[The writer of an article reprinted Jul >’ 2]
from The Popular Science Monthly) contended that the
higher education of woman is surely extinguishing' par
race, both directly by its effects on her organisation, ancl,
indirectly, by rendering early marriage impossible for the
average man.” Contributors’ comments follow : no space
for more :—]
ONE WOMAN'S VIEW.
ri’lHE writer’s ideal seems to be marriage at
I eighteen and a family of nine or ten.
M Excellent, doubtless, for the nation ; but
for the individual woman ? Every woman
knows that, leaving out the question of actual
violent pain, each baby means to its mother at
least six months of extreme discomfort. lhere-
fore a family of ten means for the mother five
years during which she cannot enjoy life. How
many men would be willing to give five years
ill-health for the good of their country, and no
other reward ? Why should women be expected
to, and blamed as pleasure-loving and cowardly if
they object?
I am no advocate of the higher education, and
dislike equally the over-educated female who con-
siders babies a bore, and the woman of fashion
who regards them as toys. My ideal career for a
woman is that of wife and mother ; but if she has
a large family it should be recorded to her credit
and not looked on as mere duty to the State. •
A middle-class girl marries—not, let us hope, at
eighteen, when she is unformed mentally and
physically; but at three or four or four-and-
twenty. For the first few months everything is
delightful; an adoring and adored husband, “a
house of her own,” new dresses, and the joy of
being Mrs. Jones. Then comes the mew life. If
she is a true woman, there is happiness of the
highest kind in the .thought of his child and
hers that is to be. Still, the weary round
of days must be gone through. It is a
“detail,” but much of life depends on details.
As the weeks drag on, she becomes more and more
weary ; a sound night’s sleep is impossible ; arid
she dreads, and yet longs, for the coming ordeal.
At last it is over, and worn out and yet happy,
she holds her child in her arms.
Life begins for her again in the old routine; but
the new little life takes much of her time and
energy. Servants and climate are two things
often forgotten in the demai. t for large
families from middle-class Queensland women.
Our long summers are exhausting in themselves;
and with the strain of little children and incom-
petent servants women soon become faded aiid
sallow. In well-to-do English households children
almost from their birth fair under the sway of
“nurse,” but in most; Queensland homes “mother”
has to take her place. “Mother” looks older
than her thirty years; and she would give any-
thing for a rest away from the children, but with
small means that is out of the question. A week’s
holiday at the seaside means harder Work for her.
So. the years'go on, and she sinks into a domestic
drudge. Money does not come with the increasing
family, and butchers’ and bakers’ bills are a per-
petual worry. Before her marriage she was thought
to have a pretty taste in music, but hours are too
precious now to be wasted in practising. Her
only interests now are the children and domestics
—her own and her neighbours’; for she is “ too
tired to read.”
At forty the ten children have arrived, and she
has lost all the brightness and prettiness she once
possessed. She is always tired, and the family
doctor speaks of the necessity of a serious opera-
tion. Still, she has “ done her duty to the State.”
If, on the other hand, she had had four or five
children, with reasonable intervals between them,
she would have kept strong, and have beep able
to look after them’ better. One of them would not
have died of scarlet fever and another of croup.
She would have been a companion to her husband
—which, with ten children and a small income,
was an impossibility.
No, if large families are to be desired for the
good of the country, let us encourage the mothers
with something besides the joy of patriotism.
Instead of subsidising useless politicians, give a
bonus to every mother on the arrival of a fourth
child, and continue and increase it with each new-
comer. Under present circumstances, every
moderately well-to-do woman is asked to sacrifice
herself for the good of the country—and how
much more do the poor ones suffer ?
C.M.
A MAN'S IDEA.
JUDGING from Australian experience, I
should say that the Writer mistakes cause
for effect. Niiae out of every ten girls of
this country who follow-up “the higher
education” are deficient in normal sex-instinct in
the first instance ; and even did they remain in a
state of primeval ignorance would probably be
inferior mothers.
Education possibly aggravates the trouble, for
women who aim at self-improvement refuse
to take the common-sense view of the sub-
ject that men students do. They exalt edu-
cation to a religion, and become as fanatical
about it as any dancing dervish who ever
gyrated his way to salvation. The male student,
if he is exceptionally diligent, spends perhaps
eight hours daily on his work. The rest of his
waking hours are spent in athletics, diversions,
and the companionship of damsels not addicted
to “the higher education.” The female student
has no thought outside her books, and memorises
by laborious study what the male grasps by under-
standing. The studious woman is, in nearly
every instance, a member of a third sex. She
lacks the natural delight in the company of
a man which is taken by even the most cir
cumspect of her sisters not devoted to the higher
education, while as for the little danee-and-
p’cnic flirtations— the conservatory embraces and
tfie kisses at the front gate—that tend to make
life worth living for the majority of the sex, she
regards them with absolute abhorrence.
I am not speaking about the woman of high
intellect, who is a totally different being. As far
as my experience of her goes, she possesses
Erimitive passions above the average; and, when
e sees her coming, the man of moral sentiments
should “get him to a monkery.”
A.B.
COPYRIGHT
m i-IE point is this. In the matter of copy-
I right, Canada and Australia are constitu-
M tionallv and practically in the same pair of
shoes. Constitutionally, because each is
a federation of States under the British Crown ;
and to each, in its Constitution Act, the British
Parliament has ceded express power to legis-
late regarding copyright. Practically, because
Canadian readers, and writers, and artists, and
musicians, and playwrights, and printers, etc.,
have necessarily motives and interests similar to
the motives and interests of Australian printers,
and playwrights, and musicians, and artists, and
writers, and readers, etc.
Therefore, the laws that have been made by
Canada can be made by Australia ; and it is likely
that the policy which has been found good by
Canada will be found good by Australia—since
Canada, working under similar conditions, has
had 33 years’ more federal experience.
J*
Copyright does not include trade-marks or
patents for inventions: these are a matter for
separate legislation. Copyright is the exclusive
right of multiplying copies of a literary or artistic
work (by printing, for example); or the exclusive
right of performing a play or a piece of music.
By law, copyright belongs to the author —to keep,
or sell, or otherwise dispose of during a certain
time. That is to say, when a man writes a book
or carves a statue, or so on, the law says that no
one shall reproduce it without his permission : he
has the sole right of making copies, the copyright.
British copyright laws have force in Australia ;
but some of the British laws are admitted to be
bad, and some were made a long time ago. And
they were made chiefly for Britain, not for Aus-
tralia. Bo the Constitution gives the Parliament
of the Commonwealth express power to make
copyright laws for Australia. That is why
Senator Keating has introduced the Copyright
Bill now being discussed by the Senate.
In many ways this Bill would be a good law ;
but in the main principle it would not.
When Senator Keating framed his Bill, he had
a choice of two ways, of doing it. One was to
follow the example of Canada, and make an Aus-
tralian law for the benefit of Australians, ju ; as
Canada has made Canadian laws for the benefit of
Canadians. The other way was to adopt all the
old or bad laws of Britain, made chiefly for the
benefit of Britain, and try and tinker them up to
date. Unfortunately it is the last way that
Senator Keating has chosen.
&
Canada says to Britain: By our .Constitution
you admit that copyright is a matter that con-
cerns us, and you empower us to legislate
regarding it. Well, these are the things we
want. We want to create art and literature and
music in Canada, and to encourage artists and
authors and musicians by protecting them in the
enjoyment of the profits of their work!Therefore
we give copyright. At the same time we want to
secure for Canadians the best things quickest—
the best things in literary and dramatic and
musical and artistic work, as soon as they
can be had elsewhere. Therefore, we give copyright
to all the world on the same conditions as Cana-
dians comply with —to all the world that gives
our authors equivalent copyright. We also want to
promote Canadian industry—therefore we insist
that, to secure Canadian copyright, works pro-
duced in other countries must be reproduced in
Canada within one month. If they are noi, we
reserve the right to get them the best way we can.
And these wants Canada has provided for.
Senator Keating’s Bill says: We too will pro-
tect local authors. But we will protect foreign
authors just as much or more—far more than
Canada protects them. They need not give any
return for this protection: they need not make
their books available to Australian readers, and
we will do without their books, yet prevent any-
body from reprinting or importing these. They
need not even reciprocate our generosity. And
we will not try to promote local industry: Aus-
tralian books may provide a living for British or
German workmen, but they need not provide a
living for Australian workmen ; while foreign
works will be protected wherever they are printed.
J*
So the otiier point is this. Canada does a deal
better for Canadians than Senator Keating pro-
poses to do for Australians. And Canada and Aus-
tralia have similar powers under the same Imperial
laws.
«►
Sept. Scribner’s prints some curious letters of
Bancroft, the Amer. historian, describing student
life at Gottingen university about 1818. There is
a reference to “Professor Forster, the famous
voyager, who went once round the world with
Captain Cook, and was afterwards made professor
at Halle.”
He was a rude, ill-mannered fellow. A young Jewish
girl happened to he in company with him one evening.
The company was rather dull. She was guilty of yawn-
ing. Forster, perceiving her mouth distended, during
the operation cried out,, “Lord, Miss, I hope you don’t
mean to eat me.” “Never fear,” answered she, “I’m a
Jewess.”
Bancroft’s student habit was to rise before five,
and drink several cups of coffee before seven.
Then he ate a piece of brown bread and butter,
which lasted him till dinner. With the exception
of two, or perhaps three, hours, he was closely at
work till eleven at night.
Eichhorn told me yesterday that he labours at present
from five in the morning till nine at night, that he has
all his life gone on much in the same way ; that when he
was first made professor, he studied 15 hours daily, and
never experienced any inconvenience in respect of his
health.
Now we can explain the dullness of Bancroft’s
historical work—a quarry for less fatigued men to
build from. By the way, in Bancroft’s day, Wolf,
most erudite of professors, had in his ripe age
given up study, and was eating good dinners and
sporting with Amaryllis and others. Bancroft
records this fall (?) from grace with Puritan dis-
approval.

THIS TIME AT MERRYLANDS.
The Case of Mr. H. A-M3ND.
(By a Local lloporter.)
Whilst much of the anguish and grief
which exist in some families as the re-
sult of ill-health is hid from the gaze
of the outside world, and is Unown
only to those who are immediately
concerned, sufficient transpires to ex-
cite the sympathy of every genuine
philanthropist, and to bring forth
strenuous efforts on behalf of suffering
humanity. Here is an instance in which
the reader will recognise a desire on
the part of Mr. Henry Almond, store-
keeper, Park-road, Merrylands, to ex-
tend a helping hand to any who may
be afflicted as he was some years back.
“It was when I was living in Tam-
worth," said Mr. Almond, “that I
I'rst knew what bad health was, and
that must be a good while back, for L
have been living here these fourteen
years past."
“in what way was your health af-
fected V' enquired a man from the
office.
“Weil, for two years previous to
coming here, and for a good while af-
ter starting this business, I was al-
most mad with neuralgia, and you
may guess that having a complaint
like that so long must have had a
direful effect upon my system general-
ly. Heally, sometimes I was fairly rag-
ing, owing to the agony 1 was in, and
many a time wished that I was dead
and out of the world altogether. Oh !
it was a life of fearful misery, and I
pity any poor soul in similar straits.
You may rest assured that I resorted
to pretty well every known treatment
in the hope of gaining some relief, but*
success evaded all my efforts. My
gums, my jaws, the cheek bones were
the parts where the torture principally
existed ; but, curiously enough, there
were days when one side of my face
and head was affected till nightfall,
and then the pains shifted over to the,
other side. And as for sleep—well, do
you think anybody could sleep under
such adverse circumstances V I know I
couldn’t, as a rule, though, at long
intervals, when nature could not hold
out any longer, I lapsed into a state
of unconsciousness that might be called
sleep, and whilst it lasted 1 had the
worst dreams you could think of."
“I don’t suppose you were usually
tit to do much work ?”
“Indeed I was not, and T. was also
so low-spirited that I did not seem to
care whether I was ever able to work
a<~/ain or not. As a, mat ter of fact f
had no interest in anything, excepting
that T wanted to get better if it woro
possible, which didn’t seem very like-
ly, for instead of getting better I got
worse as the months wore on. Shornv r
after the neuralgia attacked mo, 1 no-
ticed that my "digestion was getting
bad, and so it continued to fail until
eventually my internal organs were so
completely unset that even the lightest
of food could not be assimilated. , A.
heavy sensation in the chest, which
made it impossible to draw a deep
breath, was one of my daily. discom-
forts, and after eating a little my
stomach became inflated, and caused
considerable discomfort until the wind
was all belched away. My tongue had
a dirty coating, and the taste in mv
moutli of a morning was most dis-
agreeable-elearly indicating the bi-
lious state I was in ; and another
thing that troubled me was my 81
—very poor indeed sometimes, whiio
my eyes felt twice their proper size,
and as heavy as lead. Between mv
shoulders I had more pains to bear,
and I ached so much across the loins
that it was painful to walk even a
short distance. But you’ve no idea of
the fearful state of nervousness I got
into—used to give little jumps and
twitches, as though I had St. Vitus
dance sometimes, and the unsettled
frame of mind I was in gave rise to
much mental misery also. Simple mat-
ters irritated me, and Caused unduo
excitement, and 1 tell you candidly I
couldn’t find a moment’s peace or hap-
piness anyhow."
■'Alter so much ineffective treatment
how did you manage to get well
again
“This way : A new customer came to
the shop one day, and, seeing how ill
1 was, said ‘Did you ever try Clements
Tonic V I said : ‘Mo ; and i’m sick of
taking physics.’ Be came in again, and
asked if I had got any yet, to which
1 answered in the negative. Be said :
‘Well, try a bottle ; it won’t break
you/ and at last I did, for which I
am devoutly thankful. Oh ! it was like
something you read about in a novel,
the way Clements Tonic served me;
but it was a joyful reality neverthe-
less. To think that I had suffered for
years, and only then had got a re-
medy to do me good was something
to be thankful for, and 1 was, too.
Why, Clements Tonic began to sootho
my nerves when I had only taken two
or three bottles, and ypu couldn’t cre-
dit the amount of ease it had given me
already ; it roused the weakened ener-
gies of mv system and stimulated my
appetite to such a degree that beforo
long 1 was eating as well as ever —
when the neuralgia had entirely gone, of
course you cun guess how < rateful I was.
It is also in regard to indigestion that
Clements Tonic is deserving of recogni-
tion at my hands, for that was, after
all, one of the principal things from
which I suffered. Yes ; my last remedy
fairly opened tny eyes as to what me-
dicine really can do when it is of the
right kind/for in spite of everything
else failing, Clements Ton e set to
work, and put me right in no time. A
few weeks’ use of it made such an al-
tered man of me that 1 had nearly
forgotten wlmt ‘it was like to get up
feebng half-dead with weariness. My
breath was swret, and I had no un-
pleasant taste in my mouth of a
morning, uiy eyes were bright and the
sight good, 1 slept soundly each
night, every pain had gone, so what
more could any man wish for ?”
“And what has your health been
like since V”
“Splendid, excepting on an occasion
when 1 contracted influenza through
getting up all hours at night during
mv wife’s illness. She was suffering
from influenza, too, and soon there
was a pair of us. so we had to close
shop for a while. My word, we did
have a bad time! Wife got like a bag
of bones, but. Clements Tonic made her
eat four or five meals a day, and she
was soon well again, I was awfully
weak and miserable ; mv nerves broke
down, again, and once more I suffered
the tortures of neuralgia ; but not for
long though, as I knew what would
cure me. and so it did. Yes, Clements
Tonic showed its wonderful properties
again, and I’ve such belief in its cur-
ino- capacities that I recommend its
use to all. More than that,
publish mv story in manner that
your mind may suggest.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Nostalgia.
0, dolesome days are Auckland’s now—
Dark, deluging, and chill;
Erom out the misty Manukau
The savage south winds shrill;
And, as across splenetic skies
The weeping clouds are borne,
I dree my weird, and realise
That man was made to mourn.
O, Waitemata’s sullen tide,
And hills bleak, bare, and brown !
O, greyly-shaded countryside
And wet and windy town !
Your winter is my discontent,
Your sombreness my gloom;
Your vapors circumambient
My shadowed soul entomb ;
Till brighter scenes my vision haunt,
As, hungry for the sun,
Far northward, on a rueful jaunt,
My recollections run,
Where tropic aureolas gloss
The stretch of shining sea.
That bounds the Isles of Helios,
And all they mean to me.
There, where eternal summer’s smiles
Make glad the glowing day,
Serenity unruffled whiles
World-weariness away.
There, in a fruitful garden-land,
Sweet Nature’s autograph
Is writ, for all who understand
That man was made to laugh.
Ah, “ Sorrow’s Crown of Sorrow ! ” Yet
The retrospect brings balm.
It is not all a vain regret,
For storm gives place to calm;
And, in the light of former days,
I, somehow, seem to see
A promise which my spirit stays—
What has been, yet may be.

TALAFEKAU.
After All.
When the dust is in your eyes
And the grave damp in your hair,
It may matter very little
What you did or what you were.
You have wit to make men laugh,
You have woes that make men weep;
But that wit and woe will vanish
When at last you fall asleep.
You have gold enough for ten,
For yourself and nine beside;
At the death-hour God will ask you
Why those nine men starved and died.
There is profit sure in loss,
And in giving there is gain ;
And a man may kneel at altars
And be nine times worse than Cain.
He may walk with head held high,
But the murder-brands are red —
The nine scars his forehead on
Tell the world of nine men dead.
In the death-hour he may hear
Prayer of priest and child and friend,
But the pine men shall be waiting
In the lonely evening-end.
What will all earth’s gold be worth
All the prayers and psalms that rise
When he looks—forlorn and stricken —
In their strange accusing eyes ?
When the yellow mould is heaped
On your oaken coffin lid,
It may be that it will matter
What you were and what you did.

Inland.
At the turn of the track the path emerges
To the bare, bleak hill, from the dense, dark
trees,
You can hear the echoes of distant surges,
You can catch a glimpse of the open seas,
A patch of blue on the far horizon—
A touch of color beyond the gray.
It is good to pause and rest the eyes on
The clean, salt sea that is miles away.
It is good to recall the days of roaming—
The gleaming sands in the Eastern bights—
The sparkle of waves from the forefoot foaming,
And the welcome warnings of beacon lights.
The lofty spars and the taut shrouds wailing
Like harp-strings stirred by the steady Trades.
I have left the land and gone a-sailing
In a Ship of Dreams that is manned by Shades.
I can see the curve of the canvas swelling,
Like a captive cloud, ere they sheet it home.
I can feel the shock of the bows repelling
All the serried onslaughts of waves that comb.
I see the flashing of sprays that board her,
And hear the song of the tropic breeze,
The whispered word or the shouted order,
The crash and thunder of topping seas.
But the track winds round, and away from sea-
ward—
Away from the dreams that it brought by chance,
And our thoughts drift down with the wind to
leeward.
As we turn away from the old romance.
The last low notes of the breakers’ chorus
Die, like the days that are dead for me,
We set our eyes to the land before us —
We bid good-bye to the distant sea.

HOME, whether it be palace or cottage, is suggestive of comfort, and to secure
a comfortable home the rich spare no expense. It cannot, therefore, be
said that the reason so many of the homes of the well-to-do are being roofed
with RUBEROID is because of cheapness. Comfort and durability are the
chief merits of RUBEROID; its cheapness is only a secondary consideration.

FROM “SPLENDID ISOLATION”-A
DESCENT.
The Anglo-Japanese treaty, which has just been
superseded by another and stronger bond, was the
first departure made by Great Britain from the
policy of “splendid isolation,” which had been
its vaunt for some decades. The British theory
of foreign politics up till then had been that the
Triple Alliance neutralised the power both of
Russia and France, and left Britain with an over-
whelming navy to be sought as a friend by all
parties. When Russia anti France formed the
Dual Alliance and there were indications—as at
the conclusion of the Jap-Chinese war—that
the Triple and Dual Alliances might, at
the prompting of danger or of profit, act
unitedly, the policy of “splendid isolation’’
didn’t look quite so attractive. “Splendid”
seemed in danger of being supplanted by
“ dangerous ” as the fitting adjective. It would
probably be found, if the veil were lifted from
foreign policy affairs, that at this time Britain
made overtures to the United States for a
defensive and offensive alliance, and found that
Uncle Sam was in a mood to play the splendid
isolation game himself, holding, as he tliought,
cards good enough for a lone hand. Without a
doubt, at that time reasonable overtures to any
European Power on the part of Britain would
have been welcomed, for Britain is still the greatest
country financially of the European group, and
possessed of supreme maritime strength. But the
undesirableness of ‘ ‘ entangling European alliances ”
had become, like Freetrade, one of the fetishes
of the British politician, and when an alliance was
decided upon it was with an Asiatic Power.
(It has not yet become the habit to apply the
adjective “entangling” to combinations with
niggers and heathens.) That agreement, though
only of a temporary and strictly limited
character, was felt to call for some apology.
“Great Britain grants, does not seek alliances,”
was the salve that one British statesman applied
to his country’s pride. Now the remorseless logic
of events forces Great Britain to seek a renewal of
that alliance, on terms no longer limited and tem-
porary, but of such character as the nation has
never consented to since Marlborough’s cam-
paigns against the great Louis.
• * * *
The new treaty will endure for 10 years and so
much longer as it is allowed to go without denun-
ciation after a year’s notice by either Power. In
all Asiatic matters Britain and Japan are to act as
one. If, by reason of an unprovoked attack or
any aggressive action, wherever arising, the
interests of either party are attacked, the
other party must join in the war. It may
be stated as an axiom of war calculations
that the enemy whom you wish to attack
is always the first aggressor. It was the
aggressive action of Denmark in presuming to
have a fleet that made Britain wage the war which
ended in the destruction of that fleet at the battle
of Copenhagen. It was the aggressive attitude
of Spain in refusing to fully recognise his brother
as king that made Napoleon attack that country.
It was the aggressive attitude of the lamb in
persisting in drinking at the same stream that
made the wolf eat the sheepling. For all practical
purposes the reservations about “ unprovoked
attacks” and “aggressive actions” may be
ignored. What remains is the fact that if Japan
goes to war over an Asiatic matter, Britain must
come to its aid. If Britain is attacked in Asia
Japan must join in the war. There is a practical
“ pool ” of armaments for
The conditions under which armed assistance shall be
afforded, in the circumstances mentioned, and the means
whereby that assistance shall be made available, shall be
arranged by the naval and military authorities of the High
Contracting Parties, who from time to time shall mutually
consult fully and freely upon all questions of mutual
interest.
That is to say, Japan has a right to be consulted
as to Britain’s naval and military arrangements,
and vice versa. It is the most complete and whole-
hearted compact possible, with no limitations
about a benevolent neutrality, or suggestions as to
merely keeping a ring and ensuring a fair fight.
In Japan’s next war Britain must join in, even
if the war be against the United States, which
“aggressively ” continues tc hold the Philippines,
or France, which is still “aggressively ” located in
Tonquin. As to the position of Australia, which,
in an “aggressive” sort of way, continues to
partly exclude Asiatic immigrants, its situation is
preuliar, and seems likely to call for a good deal of
negotiation.
• * * *
It must be with a very wry face that Great
Britain accepts this fact. From an attitude remi-
niscent of the sturdy days of the Roman Republic,
which “never made treaties except under terms
of conquest,” the British power comes at one step
down to the level of the days of Constantine,
when Sarmatians had to be subsidised to keep off
the Goths, and Goths to keep off the Sarmatians.
But the treaty with Japan had become necessary,
or so nearly necessary that the only alternative
was a courageous national policy on the part of
Great Britain, a reorganisation of her industries,
a restoration of her agricultural population, and
the devotion of her manhood to the task of
defence. Japan having been sheltered by Britain
until it reached the rank of a first-class Power,
the balance of might could no longer be secured
—as it might have been before —by a treaty,
say, with France. Such a combination might be
left helpless before an agreement between Japan,
Russia, and Germany, which could have attacked
the alliance on land at two points. A national
re-organisation in Britain would, of course, change
the situation ; it would make it possible for an
Anglo-French alliance to defend the boundaries of
France and India by land as well as to command
the sea. But Britain has at present practically
no army, and it is a matter of some doubt whether
it is now capable of making the efforts and the
sacrifices necessary for such re-organisation as will
make national land defence real and possible.
The country has been, for years, becoming
flaccid at the heart. You may still meet English-
men in high places in London, but rather rarely.
That city grows yearly more and more the
Stock Exchange and the amusement ground
of the international financier, and rural England
drifts month by month into the hands of foreign
millionaires. Assuming that Britain wishes to
remain the Britain of to-day, to allow present
tendencies to develop unchecked, the Japanese
treaty is almost essential to the national existence
—certainly essential to the security of India, for
Japan, if not allied with Britain, would almost
certainly obtain an alliance with some other Power.
And, as Japan is avowedly hostile to European
rule in Asia, and there is hardly a Power with
which it could make alliance that is not hostile to
British rule in India, there is only a choice between
an Anglo-Jap treaty for the (at least temporary)
defence of British India, or a Jap treaty with
someone else for the destruction of British India.
• * * *
Withal, the measure of security that Britain
wins is not full, pressed down and overflowing.
Japan, it is true, guarantees Britain in India.
But of what practical value would that guarantee
be in case of an invasion of India? Would
Britain be able to send Japanese troops
through Bengal to the frontier of Hindu-
stan, to thus advertise to its Asiatic subject
that he was under the protection, not
of the superior European, but of another
Asiatic? All that we know about the Asiatic
mind suggests that such policy would be rife
with possibilities of disaster. Britain holds
India, not so much by physical as by moral force.
The bulk of the Indian army is of the subject race,
so that the conqueror does not even hold down the
country with his own arms. Once thoroughly
free the Indian mind from the sense of the inevit-
able superiority of the European —once give him
the idea that an Asiatic from Japan is as good as
an Englishman—and the days of British
rule in India are numbered. On the other
hand, what Japan gains by the treaty is
very real. Its suddenly won position as a Power
is absolutely guaranteed and its overlordship of a
good part of Asia secured. The only danger the
Monkey has now to fear is that of a pan-European
combination against Great Britain and Japan, and
that is but remotely impossible. In diplomacy
Tokio has taken full advantage of the knowledge
that London was in a tight place.
* * » *
So far as Australia is concerned the treaty is, of
course, profoundly distasteful. In the various
conflicting currents of “foreign policy” Aus-
tralia has little interest; but is firm in the
one faith that white race supremacy is the
only hope of democratic civilisation. An alliance
which further buttresses a Yellow Race, and
raises up at our very door a powerful antagonist
of European ideas, cannot be looked upon in any
other light than that of a calamity. But there is
at least this reason for congratulation, that Japan
has not been able to secure—so far as the pub-
lished terms of the treaty indicate—any rights of
free immigration within the Empire which would
-conflict with a White Australian policy. There is
some ground for uneasiness in the cabled news
that Canada “has applied to be brought under
the terms of the treaty,” for there is nothing in
the treaty so far as published to affect Canada.
But, presumably, if there were any secret clauses
dealing with immigration, Australia would have
been info, med, and silence on that point means
relief from a dread which was very real.
BENT IS DOING HIS BEST.
Lately some deluded persons at St. Kilda (Mel-
bourne) gave a smoke-night to that nefarious Tory,
M'Cutcheon, M.L.A., and Premier Bent arose
amid the haze to make a few remarks. The bur-
den of these observations was that Victoria
required more population, and that he (Thomas)
was doing all he knew in the good cause. To
quote a daily paper report, headline and all:
Mr. Bent doino his Best.
Mr. Bent said the time had arrived when the .’ should
consider the question of population. They had ouudings
and institutions and means of government for four times
the number of people here, and they must do what they
could to attract to the State the right class of people. If
thej’ could secure a reduction in the rates of passage, and
have people coming here in thousands, they would be
reducing their taxation and increasing their prosperity.
They were about to submit a scheme of agricultural edu-
cation which would make for the advancement of indus-
try, and in other ways they were doing their best for the
people of Victoria.
If Thomas Bent is doing his best, all that can be
said is that it is a very poor best, and until a really
heavy graduated land-tax is put on —one heavy
enough to break up the great estates, to make
the holding of great estates ruinous, and to make
the accumulation of any more great estates im-
possible—neither Bent’s best nor his worst will
do much good to the population question in Vic-
toria. When the Premier of a State which, for
over 13 years, has sent away on an average 12,000
or 14,000 of its citizens annually, talks about
bringing in strange people instead of considering
how to stop the appalling outflow of his. own
people, it is a humorously wooden-headed business.
* # * *
It is 35 years p’xvce the curse of the great land
monopolies fell • lefinitely on Victoria as to
start driving the *_.mer’s sons out of the country
to look for land. For 35 years almost the only
serious chance Victoria has had of accumulating
population has been in the expansion of Melbourne
and a few other towns, and in the building up of
manufactures in Melbourne and one or two other
towns. The great country population, which
should have grown up concurrently with the city
population, has been suppressed or extirpated by
gross and unpatriotic landlords, who shooed the
people off their vacant principalities, and refused
to let them live on any fair or possible terms in
their own country. Most of the country towns
which should have grown up into prosperous
manufacturing centres are strangled by the
same curse; the land around them is mostly
kept a wilderness by the insane greed of the great
land monopolists. In such a case concrete ex-
ample is far better than loose declamation.
Victoria is divided into 37 counties. Nine of
these are mostly inaccessible mountain top, and
four are almost wholly desert. There are 24
fertile or reasonably fertile counties. Between
1871 and 1881 nine of these showed a decrease of
population, while in four counties which showed
an increase the gain of population was 4, 58, 81
and 123 individuals respectively. Between 1881
and 1891, eight counties showed a decrease of
population, and eight showed a loss of population
between 1891 and 1901. To get down to particu-
lars in some of the worst cases :
* * * *
County op Bourke : This is the county in which Mel-
bourne is situated. Population, apart from Melbourne,
in 1861, was 26,880 ; in 1901, only 21,k73. The County of
Bourke has an area of 1721 square miles, and contains, in
addition to Melbourne, many small towns. Population
outside the towns almost nil. The big estates of the
sheep-breeders start right at Melbourne’s backdoor ; a
few miles out and you strike grass and emptiness and the
curse of the land monopolist.
County of Grant: Next door to Melbourne. Well
watered and very fertile. Population 73,828 in 1871 ;
only 71,03 k in 1901. Contains Geelong, Ballarat East,
Buninyong, Queenscliff, &c.—towns growing ; country
districts being turned into a wilderness. Area, 1834
square miles ; population outside the towns about one
person to two square miles. Mostly owned by one or two
persons, who would rather see their State sink into Tophet
than give up the satisfaction of looking out on their miles
and miles of empty plains and their occasional sheep, and
saying “ We are monarehs of all we survey.” Same
sentiment which influenced William the Conqueror when
he desolated Hampshire to make the New Forest.
County of Daliiousie : Due north from Melbourne, and
only 43 miles distant. Population in 1871, 26,k71 ; in
1901 only 20,878. Fertile and well-watered. Traversed
by railway to Sydney and also railway to Bendigo. Area
1310 square miles. Outside the towns probably one person
to square mile.
County of Talbot : Also in the well-watered area ; 65
miles from Melbourne ; traversed by five railways and
contains ten towns of some importance. Population
in 1871, 8k,762; in 1901, only 57,398. Area 1621 square
miles. Outside the towns population almost invisible.
• * * *
County of Grenville : Towards the fertile west. Con-
tains such important towns as Ballarat West, Smythes-
dale, and Pitfield. Population in 1871, 60,917 ; in 1901
only k8,1k6. Outside a few towns a human being is
almost as rare as an alligator. Area, 1465 square miles.
County of Ripon : Further west; well-watered and
fertile. Population in 1871, lk,olo ; in 1901 only 12,689.
Area, 1759 square miles. Contains four important towns.
Outside them, about one human being to 2000 acres.
County of Follett : In the south-west, by the Glenelg
River. Fertile. Had 27k9 people in 1891 and only 2715
in 1901. Principal town has almost the whole population.
Area, 1103 square miles. About one person to eight
square miles outside the town.
County of Low an : In the west. Area, 4971 square
miles. Had 16,820 people in 1891, and only 1k,190 in
1901.
County of Kara Kara : Traversed by three railways
and contains a number of small towns. Area, 2301 square
miles. Population in 1881, 16,515 ; in 1901 only 16,k31.
Outside its towns, population almost nil.
County of Gladstone : Traversed by four railways and
pretty well watered. Area, 1802 square miles. Popula-
tion in 1881, 19,995 ; in 1901 down to 17,953.
County of G unbower : Has two railways, and three
rivers. Area, 1348 square miles. Contained 8706 people in
1891, and only 8167 in 1901. Average population off the
railway lines about nobody to the square mile.
County of Rodney (where the Kvabramapootra is):
Has two lines of railway ; well-watered ; splendidly irri-
gated at the State’s expense, the local swindlers having
refused to pay. Area, 1699 square miles. Contained
19,155 people in 1891, and 19,1k0 in 1901.
County of Wonnangatta : Splendidly watered by moun-
tain streams,. Abundance of water power. Area, 2224
square miles. Population in 1861, 3972; in 1901 only
2271.
* * * *
There is some material in this for Bent to do
his best upon. With the single exception of Won-
nangatta, which is partly a mountain region, the
counties above enumerated are in the most fertile
and best-watered part of Victoria, and their
decline is owing to the big landlord curse, and to
nothing else under the sun. They are simply
regions where the population is warned off. And
in addition to these counties, which show an abso-
lute loss of population since some bygone census
year when they were respectively at their poor
little zenith, there are others in the fertile Western
District which are practically stationary—Heytes-
bury (444 increase in 10 years); Villiers (168 in-
crease in 10 years); Normanby (250 increase in 10
years); and the like. The whole Western District,
comprising nine counties, or one-sixth of the State
the best-watered, most fertile, and most landlord-
cursed part of Victoria —has gained less than 5000
new population in 30 years, though the State in
general has gained 700,000. One barren, drought-
curse! county up in the Mallee, which has for its
sole advantage the fact that there are no big land-
lords to keep it back, shows nearly twice this prc«
gress. The barren and half-frozen mountain
counties are progressing because they are so poor
that the big land-thief didn’t annex them; yet
they have almost every possible drawback
except him. It is a sorry record. The artisan
and the manufacturer have done their share
to make Victoria a great State —they have built
up Melbourne. The farmer has done his share
and done it well in those places where the
great bloated insolent landlord did not in-
trude, and where the small independent cultivator
had a show. For instance. Grant, the first county
to the west of Melbourne, belongs mostly to one
or two proprietors, and its population has dimi-
nished 3000 in 30 years ; while Mornington county,
to the east of Melbourne, where the small pro-
prietor has had something of a show, showed over
19,000 increase in the same time. Premier Bent
is now “up against” the great Western District
landlords. He can’t make land. He can’t, by
the most desperate search, find good State lands
where there are nonethe most violent
inquiry which Melbourne Age could make only
revealed 14,000 acres of really good land still
in the hands of the State. He can’t get land on
voluntary principles from the great sharks at a
price which will render any big scheme of Closer
Settlement possible, for no great body of small
settlers could afford to buy at the price he would
have to charge after the principal shark was bought
out. So unless he can bring the great estates
down from the absurd values which they have
attained through exemption from taxation
unless, in other words, he can tax them down to a
fair value and force them into the market—the
spectacle of Thomas doing his best will be neither
amusing nor profitable.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Old Age Pensions Joke.
Joseph Carruthers, Premier of New South
Wales, is a sidelong personage in his political
doings. He doesn’t meet his enemy face to face,
but sidles up to him—a trifle to the rear—and
snaps at his tail. He doesn’t propose to repeal
democratic enactments that are gall and worm-
wood to his six-and-eightpenny soul; he rather
notes points that require amendment, and in
his enthusiasm he repairs the Act till it is dead or
useless. He is doing this with the Arbitration
law, and he proposes to do much the same sort of
thing with the Old Age Pensions enactment. As
regards the latter, the measure which he has intro-
duced in the Assembly is a marvel of ingenuity
in the way of small, mean, sour restrictions
calculated to make any self-respecting ancient
cut his throat on the whited sepulchre of
Carruthers’ doorstep rather than accept
his grudging assistance. By way of a first
step towards reducing the number of pen-
sioners, it is intended that henceforth no one is to
be eligible for a pension unless he has lived
thirty-five years in N.S, Wales, and in addition
the years of residence must have been so far
consecutive that the applicant must have spent
35 out of the last 40 years in N.S. Wales. The
present Act requires 25 years residence, and it
must be so far consecutive as to be 25 years out of
the last 27. The suggested change disqualifies, in
one act, all the mass of immigrants who arrived
between 1870 and 1880, and in that period the
arrivals by sea alone numbered no less than
330,000. How many of these remained in the
State it is impossible to say, but as the gold-boom
was then past, and the country was settling down,
it is certain that a very large proportion of them
remained. By way of another innovation, where tie
present Act disqualifies the person who has served
a sentence of five years, the proposed new Act
will disqualify the person who has had a sentence
of five years passed on him, whether it was served
or not; apparently even if it was passed by a
judicial error, and never enforced, it may be held
as a disqualification. The foreigner who has the
requisite residential qualification now gets his
pension if he has been naturalised for 10 years ; it
is proposed to require that he must have been
naturalised for 20 years. The present Act dis-
qualifies for a pension the individual, even if
otherwise eligible, who has an income of £52 a
year or property worth £390; the proposed new
one will disqualify every person who has an income
of £39 or property worth £195. Also, when a pen-
sioner with a little property die§, the State is to
seize the property and sell it in order to recover
the pension, which thus degenerates into a loan.
But these are merely items of grinding economy—
the economy of a mean man who saves money
at the expense of the weakest class in the
community, and hits the person of least re-
sistance, so as to avoid taxing the wealthy
absentee who spends his money in England and
slanders with Stinking Fish yarns the country
that supports him. The peculiar genius of
Joseph Carruthers is shown in certain other
provisions. First he desires to make the examina-
tion of the applicant for a pension public— to
pillory the boasted “grand old pioneer” of so
much sentimental political oratory before a gaping
crowd as a pauper, a mendicant, and a show. This
will, doubtless, save a good deal of money, and if
it were proposed that the applicant must turn up
in court in a nude condition a much larger saving
might be effected. The idea of making the appli-
cant turn up in a nude state is hereby submitted
to Joseph Carruthers’ consideration. The idea
is said to be that this subjecting to publicity
of the old man or old woman will tend to shame
his affluent offspring, if there are any, into
providing for their parent, but that result would
be much better effected if the affluent offspring
were dragged to court and there ordered to pro-
vide for the aged progenitor. Putting the aged
progenitor up for public exhibition in order to
arouse a spirit of liberality in the affluent off-
spring is a circuitous way of doing things and
quite worthy of Joseph. Curiously enough, the
sidelong Joseph, with all his desire to make the
affluent offspring provide for the old man and the
old woman, doesn’t take the straight, simple and
effective method of just making them provide.
Instead of doing this, his Bill falls heavily on the
aged progenitor again, for it enacts that his or her
pension may be refused if the court is satisfied
that the offspring, or any other relatives, are
able and willing to provide. If it proves later
on that the court made a mistake in assuming
that they were willing, or if they lied when
they said they were willing, or if they were
really willing but their willingness promptly eva-
porated, then the aged progenitor may starve.
The proposed Act makes no provision for com-
pelling the affluent offspring or other relative to
live up to the promises on the strength of which
the pension was refused, so apparently any
malignant uncle, or second cousin, or step-son, or
other land-agent will be able to reduce the vener-
able one to hopeless want by promising and not
performing. There is, in all this, a touching
desire not to be too rough on the affluent off-
spring. Again, the whole pension can be
withheld if anybody is willing, or is supposed to
be willing, to partially maintain the applicant; if
part of his maintenance is supposed to be


provided for, the other part can be cut off.
Finally, even if the applicant is of the right
age, has the necessary residence qualifica-
tion, has an unblemished character, and has
no money, no property, and not a relative m the
world, the pension may be reduced as much as
the Commissioner pleases—and if the Commis-
sioner is the sort of man who wants to keep square
with Joseph by making things easy for Joseph s
surplus, he probably will please. If anything can
hasten on the Federal Old Age Pension Act, this
inhuman travesty ought to do it. Fhe whole
business can’t be taken out of the hands of State
politicians like Carruthers a day too soon.
Looking for Land.
Booth’s cable that he has 5000 families, packed
up ready for export to Australia, to be forwarded
f.o.b. as soon as this country is ready to receive
them, has caused a considerable flutter amongst
the State Premiers. They are all hustling around
looking for desirable allotments, with the excep-
tion of the Westralian Premier, who proudly
announces that his land is ready and waiting ;
and the greatest hustle of all is being accomplished
by Bent, of Victoria, who is covering great dis-
tances in his new motor-car, and saying “ Bloom-
ing,” and “Slap-bang,” and “ Huh !” with great
vigor. After five days’ breathless exertion, Bent
and his Minister of Lands, Murray, an-
nounced that they have found an ideal spot on
which to drop a fair-sized parcel of immigrants.
The spot bears the euphonious and significant title
of the Barren Plains, and is situated near Warr-
nambool. There are 25,000 acres of these plains,
all of which belong to the Government, though
they have been, and are still, open for selection.
Present writer knows the place well, and is
of opinion that, if Booth’s little army is placed
there, every individual will die within six
months. The plains consist of a curious, spewy,
barren, treeless area, placed, strangely enough, in
the heart of a forest. No grass grows on them,
the only vegetation being a useless sort of grass-
tree, which no animal will eat. An enterprising
farmer leased a portion of the area once, and put
some hardy young stock on it, with the result that
all but seven died. Even kangaroos and rabbits
avoid the dreadful spot. Two or three months
ago the Director of Agriculture, Dr. Cherry, had
a look at these plains, and he is now experiment-
ing with a plot. He believes that if it is drained
and manured it may be worth cultivating. The
chances are, however, that it may not. Most of the
area is boggy and water-logged for the best part of
the year; and, even if the land could be used, the
roads to the nearest railway are probably the worst
in the State, barring, perhaps, some in Gippsland.
Yet, to inspect this abode of desolation, Bent and
his minions had to pass through thousands upon
thousands of acres of the finest land in Victoria,
which is still practically unsettled. They had to
go—in the train —through huge stretches be-
longing to the Chirnsides and others, between
Melbourne and Geelong. Then, from Geelong to
Terang, on either side of the railway, further large
areas of magnificent land, running right up to the
railway fences, are passed through, with a few
sheep or cattle losing themselves in the rich
grasses. It is no exaggeration to say that, along
this one line alone, there could be settled 20,000
or 100,000 families. Labor-leader Watson put
his finger on the sore spot when he said, in
reference to this same scheme, that a land-tax,
with a stiff progressive incidence, would prove
the best method of finding land for farming immi-
grants.
♦
The Federal Capital.
The Federal capital question is apparently almost
at a deadlock, though Prime Minister Deakin has
hopes of extricating it by a Bill relating to a peg.
The Australian Parliament selected a site in the
district which was declared, by an official appointed
by the N.S.W. Government to report on possible
sites, to be the most suitable in the State. It
selected a site not less than 100 miles from Sydney
as provided by the Constitution. It selected not
less than 100 square miles, as provided by the
Constitution. In asking for 900 square miles it
showed remarkable moderation ; considering that
there is required room for a city and its suburbs,
for a reservoir, for a catchment area to supply
water, and for an outlet for sewerage, it asked for
about the very smallest area that could possibly
suffice. And the Australian Parliament selected
one of the areas which N. S. Wales distinctly offered
by reserving the State lands thereabouts from fur-
ther alienation until the capital was decided upon.
Now Joseph Carruthers, of N.S.W., has per-
suaded the State Parliament to refuse this site,
and has repudiated the offer. Thereby Joseph is
true to his policy of trying to cover his wretched
inability to manage the things that are his busi-
ness by bellowing wildly about the things that are
not his business, by posing largely as the defender
of the State against imaginary incursions and
encroachments, and as the person who will be
brutally uncivil to the Australian Government
even if he dies for it, likewise as the perni-
cious small boy who will stick out his tongue
at the Australian Parliament to the last.
In pursuit of the bubble reputation as the indi-
vidual who defended somebody against some-
thing with an unspecified weapon, and thereby
averted certain circumstances and horrors not at
all defined, Joseph Carruthers wants the High
Court to decide the question, whatever it is, that
lies between him and Prime Minister Deakin ;
and Deakin, with his wearying affability, says he
is willing, if any means can be found to bring the
matter before the High Court. And now Carru-
thers doesn’t know for certain how to bring the
matter before the High Court, but Deakin is
preparing a Bill which he hopes will create
sufficient disturbance to hang the necessary law
suit on. The High Court isn’t supposed to
arbitrate on disputes, but to give judgment on
alleged breaches of law—therefore somebody
must break the law, and must break it in a large
enough way for the smash to attract the High
Court’s attention. So far all that Carruthers
can suggest is that the Australian Government
should drive in a peg to mark the first
beginnings of the new capital site, and
that he should proceed for trespass, and
thus open up the whole question, and it is
possible that the peg idea will be tried in
default of anything better. But it seems also
possible that the High Court will simply say that
trespass is a question to be dealt with by haul-
ing the man who personally drove the peg before
the nearest magistrate. And a magistrate, at the
worst, can fine him about 2s. 6d. ; while he may
decide that, unless the peg is driven in on a
highway where old women are liable tafall over
it, there is no offence. There is no law against
people walking upon unfenced State lands and
knocking about bits of wood thereon. Even if
the peg were painted red, so as to frighten cows,
it would hardly amount to a definite offence, or at
most would be an offence that ass. fine would
cover. Something might be done with Carruthers’
scheme, perhaps, if Prime Minister Deakin’s
minion came over the border and stole a
cow on the proposed capital site, or
slaughtered a heifer there without a licence,
or started hawking without a licence, or
assaulted a policeman, or set fire to the grass, or
set up an illicit still; there are any number of
ways in which the agent of the Australian
Government can attract the attention of the
N.S.W. law, but they all seem to be ways which
may simply lead to the agent being personally
dragged before a J.P. In fact, unless the Aus-
tralian Government sends the Federal army on to
Monaro, and it deliberately takes possession of
900 square miles of country, and warns the local
policeman that he will advance at the risk of get-
ting his uniform torn, and then starts to collect
the dog-tax as a Federal impost, it doesn’t appear
as if there is any certainty that Joseph Car-
RUTHERs’ scheme will amount to anything. The
peg alone looks rather insufficient, unless some-
thing is hung on it by way of emphasis. Perhaps
if it were a tall peg, and had a cross-piece at the
top, and Carruthers were hung on it, the matter
might be brought at once within the High Court’s
jurisdiction.

Educating an Upper House.
On Sept. 20th the Victorian House of Review,
after very brief consideration, passed the Factories
and Shops Acts Consolidation P>ill sent up to it by
the Assembly, and handed it on to Governor
Talbottle for his beautiful autograph. The sig-
nificance lies in the fact that the Bill, which not
only consolidates all measures of factory legisla-
tion, but also regulates the appointment of
Wages Boards, is a permanent measure, and was
actually passed “on the voices.” Certainly that
regrettable Tory landlord Harwood made an ex-
piring suggestion about fixing the Act’s duration
for three years only, but he was ignored. Yet
when, in ’96, Turner and Peacock first intro-
duced the Wages Board principle the Tory pro-
phecies about “restricting trade,” “harassing
manufacturers,” “Socialistic legislation,” “de-
struction,” “ruin,” etc., were loud and pitiful
enough to make the walls weep. That first Act
was passed for a three-years term only, because
the terrified Upper House insisted that it should
be so; since then it has been extended and
renewed; once it lapsed entirely for a few
months while Iceberg Irvine was getting measured
for his new Premiership suit; now it is passed by
the once-irreconcilable Landlords “on the voices.”
If the House of Landlords had passed the Bill of
1896 as a permanent measure an immense amount
of the Parliament’s time would have been saved,
and things would have been just where they are
now. All the wasted energy arose through
the hopeless ignorance of a crowd of legis-
lative dullards, who couldn’t see so far ahead
as the people they help to rule. It took nine
years to educate these mouldy and conceited
M.’sL.C. over this one matter up to the intellec-
tual level of the ordinary bootmaker or carpenter,
and to show them that they were wrong and the
bootmaker or carpenter was right. If Victoria
had only one House of State Parliament it would
be, as regards this law, just where it is now, save
that it would have been spared the loss of much
time, worry, legislative salary, and display of
Upper House ignorance. The reason why legisla-
tion is so pathetically slow is that the Assembly
has always to educate the Upper Tomb as it goes
along, and that place is dreadfully wooden-headed
over its lessons.
♦
Standing Orders.
The Standing Orders Committee of the House of
Representatives has published its suggested rules
for debate, as revised to Sept. 14, 1905. The
House at present has no Standing Orders of its
own, and is working under the S. Australian rules
of debate ; this is due to the desire of the Reid
Indians to carry on a guerilla warfare of obstruc-
tion against any National Government in office,
and the lack of desire to do anything but
get into recess when they win office them-
selves. True, Reid was at one time going
to preserve the purity of the home and to
destroy Socialism by devoting a 1905 session
to Standing Orders, but he got “rattled ” over the
High Court trouble and received marching orders
instead. So the House still lacks Standing
Orders, and if an odd sitting could be devoted to
the consideration of these draft rules before the
session closes it would be a useful thing. There is
not much of a contentious nature in the rules sug-
gested. No attempt has been made in them to
cope with a system of organised obstruction which
might arise (and which, in the tariff and other
debates, actually did arise to a certain extent).
As they are, however, the draft Standing Orders
do away with many of the occasions for obstruc-
tion. For instance, No. 84 :
The following motions are not open to debate, shall be
moved without argument or opinion offered, and shall be
forthwith put from the Chair and the vote taken
(a) A motion for the first reading of a Bill.
(b) A motion that this debate be now adjourned.
(c) A motion in Committee that the Chairman report
progress, and ask leave to sit again.
(and) A motion in Committee that the Chairman leave the
Chair.
(e) A motion to reinstate on the Notice Paper any busi-
ness which has lapsed because of a count-out.
Should any such motion be negatived no similar motion
shall be received within a quarter of an hour of the
declaration of the preceding decision.
“A quarter of an hour” might be changed to
“an hour,” and the claws of the obstructionist
would then be considerably clipped. A proposed
new Standing Order to follow 38—
If the Speaker considers at any time that his attention
is being called unnecessarily to the absence of a quorum
and he is satisfied that there is a quorum within the
precincts of the House he may decline to count the
House.
has caused a great deal of silly comment. It
does not mean, as the REiD-ites insist, that the
Speaker will keep a House going with five or six
members present; but that he may, if he thinks
that a fair course, suppress the obstructive prac-
tice of calling for frequent “ counts ” (all of which
waste time), so long as he is satisfied that there is
a quorum of members in the precincts of the House
doing, or ready to do, business. If, for example,
during debate the jaundiced Johnson or the
wearisome Wilks drives members out of the
Chamber for a drink, or a breath of fresh air, or
the mellow joy of silence, the Speaker may, after
once satisfying himself that there is a quorum avail-
able, refuse to allow those gentlemen—or any equally
deadly bores on the other side—to insist on fellow-
members submitting to the torture of their talk.
If the Standing Orders could be made to read that
a talker failing to keep a quorum should thereby
lose his right to continue his speech, and that the
House should count out only when, the person
who emptied the House being silenced, the ringing
of the bell fails to attract a quorum, it would meet
the case better. But probably that would be too
original a notion altogether, not to be found in
May and therefore anathema. The only really
serious point of criticism in the whole draft is
raised by Standing Orders 254, 255, 256, 257
elaborating the procedure to be adopted for the dis-
cussion and possible acceptance of amendments pro-
posed inßills by theGovernor-General. Now we all
know that the G.-G. has nothing more serious to
do in the way of proposing than healths and votes
of thanks. If he amended a Bill of the Australian
Legislature he would soon find himself out of
office. But the venerable humbug that the G.-G.,
like the sovereign in Britain, has the power of
amendment and rejection of Parliamentary Bills
is solemnly enshrined in the Standing Orders !
There is no reason for it at all, unless it is to mock
the G.-G. with the shadow of powers that he does
not possess. And the G.-G. is an amiable and
capable figure-head, with an amiable and capable
wife, and does not deserve any such gratuitous
“cheek.”
♦
The Effrontery of Certain Absentees
Ip the Westralian Chamber of Mines could use
segments of its cheek in the rock-drills, it would
start anew era in mining. The Secretary of that
body told the Tariff Commission, now sitting at
Kalgoorlie, that mining machinery should be
duty-free because
Mining was taxed by the State to an enormous extent.
It had to pay dividend duties and heavy railway charges.
The price of water was considerable.
And the mostly-foreign co.’s which are looting
Westralian gold pay very little in direct taxes,
and get their water far below cost, and at a rate
quite unprofitable to the State, while, as for
the railway charges, these are not taxes but very
moderate payments for services rendered. The total
of dividend duties for 1904 was £125,000, and the
total mining receipts £121,000. This second sum
represented the fees paid in return for survey,
assay, and inspection services, and the use of
public batteries, and didn’t recoup the State for
the cost of those services, so the shortage was a
sum taken as taxation from the people in general
as a bonus to the mining industry. The first sum
a little more than covers the loss on the Goldfields
Water Supply account, certified to by the Audi-
tor-General as £101,910 for 1904. Since the divi-
dend-tax falls not only on mining co.’s, but on
banking and all other corporations, the proportion
of the total of £125,000 dividend-tax paid
by the mining co.’s is probably less than
£101,910, the deficit on the water scheme
carried out for the benefit of the mine-
owners. Net result, thus, is that mining is
not “taxed to an enormous extent by the State ” ;
on the contrary, it is not taxed at all and gets the
benefit of police protection, cheap posts and tele-
graphs, and all other advantages of civilisation
without paying a cent in return. And the mostly
absentee vampire co.’s represented on the Chamber
of Mines have the ineffable impudence to ask
that the Australian machinery industry should be
prejudiced to allow them free imports !
♦
Secession—from N.S.W.
“X. 8.” writes :
I am about to start a secession movement, and wish to
ask the help of The Bulletin. It is to be a real secession
movement—not a mean and miserable little thing, con-
ceived in stupidity, and dying out in bluster, like John
Haynes’s secession. My object is to secede from New
South Wales, and form anew Australian State. It has
been clear, for a long time—though I say it with shame—
that N.S.W. is no place for a man who cares more about
Australia, the nation, than he does about N.S. Wales, the
State, or Sydney, the town. Putting aside the work
of a few men like Barton and O’Connor and Wise —
who, of course, have been practically repudiated by
N.S.W., and have been uniformly accused of having been
bought by the other States —putting aside the work of
these men, the record of the relations between the State
and the Federation is a record of meanness, and provin-
cialism, and dishonesty. Those are strong words, but
they’re true. The record began with a rank swindle,
perpetrated by N.S.W. on the other States, by which the
majority necessary to secure the passage of the Common-
wealth Bill was raised from 50,000 to 80,000. At least, if
N.S.W. didn’t do this, she allowed George Reid to do it,
and tolerated him after he had done it. The Bill was
carried, against a hurricane of lying and abuse
from the provincialists. But it was only carried
because the arch-provineialist, Reid, haggled
until he managed to insert in it a clause,
which nobody can understand, whereby N.S.W. was to
get the Federal capital. Because nobody can understand
the clause, the establishment of the capital has been
delayed, it has also been delayed because, whenever the
Federal Government made a movement towards settling
it, the State Government and Parliament blocked it.
Meanwhile, the air has been rent with cries about the
wickedness of the Commonwealth in depriving N.S.W. of
her right to the capital. If N.S. W. hasn’t done this, she
has tolerated Governments and Parliaments and news-
papers that have. The Federal tariff was imposed, and
N.S.W. squealed at the prospect of more taxation and a large
surplus which she didn’t want. To-day, she is squealing—or
encouraging Carrcthers to squeal—because the surplus
which she didn’t want shows signs of diminution. The
Federal surplus gave her a chance to be honest, and pay
current expenditure out of revenue, instead of out of
loans. She indignantly refused—or she tolerates and still
tolerates Governments which refused —to do anything of
the sort, and roundly cursed the Commonwealth for
making honesty possible. Not only did she refuse to be
honest herself, but when the Commonwealth declined to
be a party to the swindle of paying for defence works, post
office buildings, repairs, &c., out of loans, she complained of
the gross injustice that Federation was inflicting upon her.
Federation has given her over £4,000,000 of revenue which
she wouldn’t otherwise have had. Still she snivels —or
allows Carruthers to snivel—at the “ cost of Federa-
tion,” and at the difficulty it has introduced into State
finance. The real difficulty it has introduced into State
finance is the difficulty of being quite as dishonest as the
State used to be. Still, See and Carruthers seem to
have surmounted this difficulty without much trouble.
N.S.W. maintains a set of land laws which make it next
to impossible for her own citizens to get a decent piece of
land, unless, of course, they can afford to employ W. N.
Willis. And all the time, she snarls —or allows Car-
ruthers to snarl —at the Commonwealth for preventing 1
people from coming from the other end of the world
to settle on land that they couldn’t get near, even if the
Federal Government paid their passages and met them on
the wharf with a four-in-hand. It’s true that Carruthers
has begun to realise this, in his own mean way, and has
begun to make some land available for settlement. But
when Deakix tried to help him to get some immigrants to
settle on it, and asked in a most courteous way to be
allowed to communicate direct with the Agent-General,
he was met with a piece of rude stupidity which is un-
equalled even in the history of Carruthers. Yet N.S.W.
tolerates Carruthers.
And now, at the end of this record of meanness and
stupidity and dishonesty, this precious Carruthers, who
has muddled the finances, muddled the Lands Commis-
sion, muddled nearly everything he has touched, coolly
tells the Legislative Assembly, in answer to a foolish
question by a person named Anderson, that he “ views
with apprehension ” the prospects of a debate on the sub-
ject of Federal legislation, knowing, as he does, “ the
strong feeling of members of this House, and of the
people of N.S.W., with regard to the effects of Federal
legislation.” Then, by way of being humorous, he tells
one Kelly that he is “ very much inclined to put a notice
on the business paper for Home Rule in N.S.W.” I don’t
mind telling Carruthers that I “ view with apprehen-
sion” the prospect of Home Rule in N.S.W. under
J. Carruthers. Fancy re-transferring the Defence, the
Customs, the Post Office from a Government and Parlia-
ment which, with all their faults, have been honest and
intelligent, to a Government led by J. Carruthers, and a
Parliament which tolerates him. The prospect makes
one shiver.
The fact is, the only branches of public life in N.S.W.
that can be viewed without something very like con-
tempt, are the branches that belong to the Common-
wealth. The Commonwealth, indeed, has its weaknesses,
and very serious weaknesses they are. They arise mainly
from the presence and influence in the Federal Parlia-
ment of people like Reid, Cook, Johnson, Wilks, and
Kelly— all of them persons of the Carruthers type, and
all of them thinking their own cabbage-patch vastly more
important than Australia. There are, unfortunately,
members of the same type from other States. But no
State has produced such a large and baneful crop of them
as N.S.W.
These are some of the reasons why I want to secede
from N.S.W., and found anew, and truly Australian,
State. It wouldn’t be difficult to frame the Constitution.
The first thing- to put in, after preliminaries, would be a
clause making J. Carrutiiers, and all persons like him,
prohibited immigrants, for ever and ever. The next, a
clause making the Daily Telegraph, or at any rate its
scandalous and wicked accounts of Federal matters, a
prohibited import. For the rest, the State may be thrown
open to everybody who is Australian first, New South
Welshman second, and Sydney man third. There are
still a good many of these in N.S.W., as J. Carruthkrs
may find out some day to his cost. I’ll be glad to hear of
intending seceders.

Making His Aquaintance.
From time to time the loyal Britisher who regards
the Anglo-Monkey alliance in much the same way
as the Sunday-school teacher regards the Bock of
Ages, arises and deplores the fact that we do not
know our gallant brown ally as well as we ought
to. Well, we are beginning to learn things about
the ally aforesaid, and it looks very much as if he
will form a violent contrast to Sir Lancelot of
the Lake by the time he protrudes some more from
the mists of the dark ages and the horrid mess of
disembowelled suicide, which latter makes his past
look like a widespread post mortem. A while back
every loyal Jingo deemed it his duty to point out
to his small son the necessity of taking
a lesson from our gallant brown ally, and
spent hours dropping down dead in public places
in his amazement that the Monkey should, in a
mere five minutes, have learned all there was to
learn about Christian and human ethics. In fact,
the tall buildings U3ed to shake with the vibration
caused by Fat falling on the pavement in his grief
that we were on the same level as the anthropoid
ape when compared with our gallant ally ; while
it wasn’t safe to be out in the streets owing
to the explosion of prominent citizens at the
bare thought of the Immigration Restriction Act.
The first large disturbing fact that reached us was
the recent news that our gallant ally, on hearing of
the establishment of peace, had burnt several
churches and a mission station in Tolcio. Next day,
of course, the cable fairly boiled with a perspiring
message tumbling over itself to explain that the
arson was due to a low-down Salvationist spitting
on the pavement, or stating that peace was good, or
doing something equally disloyal. Although all
good Britishers agreed that the arson was justifi-
able, the incident was rather unfortunate ; but
Fat still stated in a thick voice that our gallant
ally’s reputation for patriotism was as notable a
circumstance as a long beer in Hades. In this
age of disillusion, said Fat and the Jingo
press, the law of gravitation is liable to be
proven bogus, and the globe a hallucination, and
W. N. Willis a rumor, and the public debt a
myth, but the one certain fact is the pure fire of
patriotism in the bosom of our gallant ally. We
were asked to believe that when the Universe
went bung the said patriotism would be the only
thing left, and would go on revolving in space
and shedding a bright light on the cavity. And
now even this belief is beginning to get some
severe jolts. The cable man, in an absent-minded
mood, sent a message the other day, stating that
the naval officers of our gallant ally had,
in a year’s operations, embezzled £30,000,
just as if they were Europeans. Seeing that
there were millions of pounds floating about, and
that the embezzlement went on for a year, and
that the Jap is credited with knowing the white
man’s system right through, the chances are that
the cable man is trying to break the full damage
to us gently, much in the same way that Jones tells
Mrs. Smith that Smith has had his hat ruined, by
way of progressing to the real fact, which is that
Smith has been run over by a freight train.
This, however, is a detail; the news is a further
contribution to our knowledge of our gallant ally,
and is accordingly something to rejoice about.
A Hew Arbitration Principle.
Judge Hetdon, the new president of N.S.W.
Arbitration Court, has explained the principle on
which “the question of preference to unionists
will always be dealt with.” He won’t grant pre-
ference on the ground that unionism is a good
thing and should be promoted ; for, “if the Legis-
lature had held that view, it would have made
preference compulsory.” The only principle the
new president can discover is this -
As far as possible the same award must be given as
would have been arrived at by the parties themselves,
So, the casual wharf-laborers’ union having al-
ready won preference, the award incorporates
preference. But constant wharf laborers not
having won preference, they are not granted pre-
ference in the award. Judge Heydon’s guiding-
principle, thus stated, is so fallacious that it should
be promptly changed. Though the Legislature
didn’t say in so many words that unionism was
a good thing and should be promoted, it said that
arbitration was a good thing and should be pro-
moted ; and the only way in which arbitration
can be promoted is by promoting unionism.
Workmen are divided into two classes—those who
agree to arbitrate and who bind themselves by
penalties to obey awards in arbitration, and those
who won’t agree to do either of these things. And
because it believed that arbitration is a good
thing, the Legislature certainly intended that,
unless there were special objections, the class that
agrees to arbitrate should be preferred. Judge
Hkydon says that the Legislature would have made
preference compulsory if it had thought unionism
(that is to say, arbitration) should be promoted.
But in coming to that conclusion the Judge over-
looks the fact that there may be special objections
so strong as to make the general rule unworkable,
or at any rate irksome. Therefore, while clearly
enough indicating that preference was desirable,
it gave the Court discretion to withhold prefer-
ence where special circumstances were disclosed.
If, further, a union can only get preference by
winning it apart from the Court, only those unions
can, generally speaking, get it which have been
successful in past strikes ; and the whole Act is
based on the assumption that the results of strikes
were uncertain and often unjust. It is hot those
who have deserved preference and other
victories that have won them, but those
who have had might on their side,
and not necessarily right. And the Court
is supposed to consider right and not might.
Even now other bodies might win preference, too,
if they could strike ; but strikes are illegal. If
two men had a dispute over a piece of land, and
came before Judge Heydon, the Court wouldn’t
argue like this “ I think if they had fought for
it, Brown would have knocked Jones out; there-
fore, I give the land to Brown.” Yet that is ifm
alleged principle he lays down to guide him
through the difficulties of the Arbitration Court.
It is a principle that ought to be discarded as
being utterly unworthy of a Court that is supposed
to be governed by equity.
Health Minister Cameron has introduced a pro-
gressive and commendable Pure Food Bill to the
Victorian Assembly. Briefly, it provides for
appointing a Foods Standard Committee, consist-
ing of the chairman of the Board of Health, the

Successive Westralian Governments, in their
anxiety to splash up the proceeds of various loans,
have attempted to separate large and enterprising
oolonies of rabbits by running a wire fence for
about 1000 miles across their Great Sand Patch.
The alleged rabbit-proof fence falls down at
frequent intervals, and search parties have to
burrow in the sand to find the posts and straining
joints. The cost of maintenance is, by now,
almost as great as the original expenditure.
Rabbits are swarming on both sides of the fence,
but the fenoe is maintained all the same. Some
extraordinary regulations have been issued by the
bosses of the Rabbit .Department—they have a
department for everything in Westralia. One is
that anybody seen in possession of a rabbit, dead
or alive, may be fined £50, and to even have the
ears, nose or tail of a bunny stowed away in your
olothes is an offence. Rabbits may be shot,
poisoned, or knocked on the head with a tele-
graph pole, but must not be removed from where
they fell. The wayback miners, living for months
on tinned dog and damper, scrupulously observe
the regulations for rabbit suppresion, and no dead
bunnies are left about their camps. The officer in
charge of the Rabbit Department (the Chief
Rabbiter) is Crawford, until recently acting-
Direotor of Agriculture, but superseded by
Chaplin, of Queensland. Now he draws a screw
nearly as big as Chaplin’s for looking after the
fence which divides one rabbit from another.
The Westralian estimates are very instructive, so
far as concerns the art of rushing money down
a steep place into the sea.

Clause six of Senator Keating’s Copyright Bill
reads!—=■
No copyright, performing right, or lecturing right shall
subsist under this Act in any profane, indecent,
seditious, or lihellous work or matter.
This was the cause of a rather interesting debate.
Senator Symon led off by pouncing on the word
“profane,” which he rightly denounced as vague
and meaningless. So “profane” was shot out,
and “ blasphemous ” —which isn’t a very great
improvement—substituted. Blasphemy of course
is largely a matter of education and temperament.
Then Symon tried, rather foolishly, to have
‘‘immoral” put in the plaoe of “indecent.” and
instanced the famous “ Fruits of Philosophy ” as
a hook that weathered the storm of a trial for
“ indecency.” The definition “ immoral ” would
have bagged that book, said Symon. To which
Senator Givens made the apt and obvious reply
that it would bag a good many more—to wit
Byron, Shakspeare (here Symon turned pale),
and the Bible, not to mention Pope, Shelley and
Burns. It is rather amazing that Symon should
be responsible tor such an inept suggestion,
for “immoral” is one of the least definite
words in the English language, Senator
De Largie remarked that he had heard the
word applied to. the writings of Henry George,
And didn’t Walter Murdoch get into trouble
with those eminently respectable publishers—
Ward, Lock, & Co. —the other day for calling
Guy Boothby’s books immoral ? One senator
wanted to use “ obscene,” which is only indecent
writ large; and another advocated “prurient.”
One can imagine the High Court deciding whether
a given work was prurient or not, which again is
largely a matter of temperament, “ Don Juan,”
“Tom Jones,” “Tristram Shandy,” and the
“Canterbury Tales” are all prurient in parts;
but who would deny the benefit of copyright to
books of their calibre, although, as Macaulay
said of Leigh Hunt’s edition of the Comic
Pramatists of the Restoration, they are hardly
hooks to be given as prizes at a girls’ school?
finally, the Senate threw out “immoral,” andi
left the original word in. So any Australian
aufhor, if he wants protection for his books or
plays, must avoid blasphemy, indecency, sedition,
or libel.
— * —
A good deal of the talk in N.S.W. about “ the
obstacles put in the way of men who want to
select Crown lands,” and about the employment
of “cobweb regulations” to harass them after
they have got land, comes from people who don’t
want to see a progressive land-tax. Their idea is
to suggest that there is plenty of suitable public
lands still available if only it could be got. As a
matter of fact, a great deal of the time of local
land boards is taken up in discovering or inventing
excuses for settlers who haven’t complied with the
law. In many of the most hopeless districts a
man may break practically every other condition
of his lease so long as he shows himself a genuine
settler and keeps his rent not greatly in arrears. In
the West, before the Western Lands Commissioners
took that country over, by far the commonest land
board decision was—“ We find that forfeiture has
been incurred, but recommend that it be waived,”
and in 99 oases out of 100 the Minister waived it
accordingly. Granted that some of the depart-
ment’s methods are cumbersome, and that the
administration has been bad in patches, it is just
as well to keep in view the other aspect of the
matter —that much of the yelping about “ vile
land laws,” nialadministration, &c., is the red-
herring cunningly drawn across the trail of a pro-
gressive land-tax by people who want to hang on
to their big estates a while longer. Then, if only
this immigration of agriculturists can be whipped
up, they will be in clover ; the State will have to
get land somewhere, and just about that time the
owners will be heard from, and the prices they will
ask will make the angels weep. Also they will
make the settlers bleed, which will be even more
disastrous.

Mr. A. A. Blackman, who is not one of the great
Stinking Fish party, writes : —
I have just returned from a trip to England after a 3J
years interval. I calculate that I spent—out of a total
of seven months—quite two months in explaining to
all classes of Englishmen—including even some “ great
merchants” (names and addresses herewith)—that we did
not exclude those hatters; also that we did not burn
them alive or throw, them into a dungeon. The extent to
which that myth has got around is simply amazing. In
trains, here, there and everywhere I lost no chance—even
if I only had one of an audience (and I often had more)—
of explaining the situation. I simply explained why Aus-
tralia had—for the protection of the intending immigrant
chiefly—merely followed the United States and Canada in
adopting an anti-contract labor law with important
modifications not allowed by eitherof those countries. I did
not fail once to convince hearers that, properly regarded,
the contract labor clause, under which those hatters were
temporarily detained a little longer on the steamer than
would have been the case had their employer not. ne-
glected to comply with a very simple and trifling official
obligation, was a most wise and proper enactment. I did
not find even one person who was not under the impres-
sion that we had done something' awful to those hatters.
I feel inclined to recommend Australians to let the fatuous
British person slide, and lav themselves out to get—after
providing- the means of employing- them—a good number
of the best class of Dutch, German and Swedish settlers.
These people become part and parcel of the land of their
adoption, and would, moreover, be an acceptable leaven
tending to create that most proper and becoming form of
loyalty—loyalty to one’s own land.

“Better than nothing” is the kindest verdict
that any Victorian jury of disinterested experts
will give to Bent’s Closer Settlement Act. Until
a graduated land-tax shall compel the big holders
to sell their land at a fair market price, and a
Compulsory Purchase Bill shall give the Govern-
ment power to take what it wants, the inducement
to would-be settlers will not be very keen in Vic-
toria. The best of the land purchased thusfar is
only just good enough to tempt settlers under the
stringent terms of the Act. Still there is the
beginning of healthful legislation in the Act,
which serves Bent as an excuse for bellowing his
own praises around the country. It is “ better
than nothing.” And because it has this negative
virtue, the glaring error made by the Closer Set-
tlement Board in the matter of the Overnewton
estate appears pretty much of a public calamity
to hopeful citizens. The Act might have lived to
be respected as a well-meaning thing, but the
Board has brought it into disgrace by selecting six
or seven thousand acres of stony ground for cutting
up into farms. This transaction amounts to a
crime, and the Board now stands to be pelted
with chunks of the rock whereon its lamentable
misdeed was founded.

The Westralian Full Court broke out into an
extraordinary piece of insolence last week. Four
Chinese were charged with breaches of the Fac-
tories Act, and their lawyer had the cheek
to plead in defence that the law was bad
because it was repugnant to some alleged
treaty or other said to exist between
England and China. This plea that a law which
had been passed by an Australian Legislature,
and had the King’s sanction, could be over-
ruled and abolished and obliterated without
notice by a mere treaty was an astounding
sample of cheek, but the Court didn’t even rule
that the plea was bad ; in fact, it refused to
express an opinion on the matter. But it dis-
missed the case on the ground that it hadn’t
been proved that the Chinamen were Chinese, and
then Justice Parker broke into an extraordinary
diatribe against the Act itself and raged at large.
The habit some bumptious Judges have of mis-
taking themselves for legislators is remarkable,
and the necessity for holding an explanation
with these Judges is urgent. No doubt the Fac-
tories Act may seem remarkable to Justice Parker ;
but Westralia didn’t make him a Judge under the
impression that he had theintellect which was likely
to understand what kind of Factories Act the State
required, or the soul that was likely to appreciate or
sympathise with the necessity for such an Act. It
appointed him for the cold, wooden job of
administering the law, and he should stick to his
own wooden job, If Westralia had thought him
the sort of man who could make laws or decide
what kind of laws should be made, it would have
found him a different kind of job.

A Melbourne pressman :—
Melbourne medico H. YV. Bryant, in a recent lecture
under Health Society auspices, spoke a word on the
deterioration of Australian physique. Bryant has for 15
years been examining military’and naval recruits, and so
knows enough about his subject to make him worth
listening to. He says that, in the last two years, the
average of well-made men paraded before him has been
very low. Last Eight-hours Day called into the streets
what was, generally speaking, a procession of weeds.
Bryant spoke mainly of city dwellers, but the same
thing is happening all over Victoria. Some part of ti e
deterioration in the military can be ascribed to reduced
pay—once, a Victorian private got £15 a year for his
drills ; now he gets £6 12s, This narrows the field of
selection. But the trouble is here all right. Australian
games—particularly football—are good enough to build
up an athletic race, but the fact is that, as a
nation, we no longer play the games ; we watch them.
For every man playing foothall on a Saturday there
are 100 looking on, half of them smoking bad cigarettes
all the afternoon. It is a question whether the big pre-
miership competitions, to control athletic games in every
district, do not ultimately kill more muscle than they
develop. Government should look after this matter in
the schools. Education departments here are generally
ceasing, or attempting to cease, their old practices of
stunting body and mind by bad air and insufficient light ;
but they should go further, and make games or gym-
nasium practice compulsory. And for the populace, after
it leaves school, the Government should help to provide
football grounds, cricket grounds, swimming baths, or
gymnasia within easy reach of everybody in every town
and suburb. Finally, knock-off time’ in shops and
factories should give everybody half-an-hour or an hour
to exercise his body. And every young healthy man
found during that hour hanging over a bar-counter, or
cramping his stomach on a billiard-table, or slinging fool-
talk at a tea-room girl, should be publicly dropped into a
deep well.

At first you’re inclined to feel a bit annoyed
about it, and wonder why J. C. Williamson will
do such things. But you look around the house,
packed in every part, and find it merry as well as
full, and then you leave off wondering. Even J.
C. Williamson, you reflect, is entitled to make a
bit of money sometimes. And here, at Her
Majesty’s, in Sydney, he certainly doesn’t make it
under false pretences. The advt. says frankly
that you needn’t bring your brains when you come
to see “The J.P.” If you’re smart enough to
follow the usher to your seat you’re smart enough
to follow Caesar Montague through the three
acts. For one thing, you have followed
him often before. It was a Mahatma
or something that arranged things so that
the first production occurred at the Jewish New
Year; for the years of the Christian era don’t
give any idea of the extreme venerableness of this
old sinner—the gay giddy old smooth-faced
chap who exudes virtue and godly advice at home,
then flies across the Channel (or somewhere), and
gets into such a glorious state that he wanders
by mistake into Suzette’s room. Sometimes he
has a wife, sometimes a nephew. This time it’s a
nephew—it is usually a nephew nowadays, so as
to allow the nephew to get married to a giddy
thing unbeknown to uncle, for which, of course,
uncle will, if he finds it out, cut him off without
a shilling; and uncle always has £96,543
7s. lid. to leave to either a nephew or
the Society for the Domestication of the Polar
Bear, or to invest in Australia if it wasn’t for
Socialistic legislation. The principal difference
between this uncle and most of the others is that
most of the others have been hustling, bustling
comedians, while J. J. Dallas, the new man with
the English reputation, gets his effects in a quieter
way ; and the principal difference between this
nephew and the others is that the others haven’t
married a girl who can wear boy’s clothes half as
well as Miss I lorence Lloyd can. Somebody says
that Miss Lloyd, like all the rest of them that
get into something from the other side of
the wardrobe, gives herself away by smooth-
ing her back-hair. But Florence is' too good
a boy to brush her back-hair up; she
srtiooths it down — which marks all the
difference. Still, in general you can’t lpok
for fine effects in “ The J.P.” It is all
broad farce, and treated accordingly; you
don’t come to applaud finished acting, but' to
laugh; and there's plenty to laugh at. Conse-
quently you do laugh, though afterwards, for the
sake of your own good opinion of yourself, it’s
best to forget all about it. Miss Maud Chetwynd
and Gregan McMahon help to destroy Australia’s
chances of getting the £96,543 7s. lid. which
uncle might invest here if his nephew didn’t get
it; also Miss Chetwynd sings a little and dances a
little, and so does Miss Lloyd ; and the house
warmly approves both dive.-sions. In fact, the
house gets into such a frame of mind that it
would approve almost anything.
* * -* *
“A Woman of Pleasure,” revived at
Sydney Royal on Saturday, is of the saner order
of melodrama, and the sensationalism, though
laid on generously, respects the probabilities
somewhat. The story opens in an English
county, where the haughty Earl (George Cross)
suffers from cold feet and family pride to an
aggravating extent, and consequently his wife
(Miss Eugenie Duggan) proposes to elope with the
villain (Laurence Dunbar). But at the critical
moment she thinks of the progeny (Laura Sin-
clair) and its attractive piping treble, and decides
to endure the family pride, and to freeze patiently
in the cold draughts of the family castle. The
villain, not to be denied, abducts her, and
the curtain goes down on Act 1 with the haughty
earl resolving to cure the wounds in his family
pride by going and fighting for the Empire in
S’Africa, and burning some Boer’s quiet little farm,
and laying waste some Dutchman’s cow. That is
quite a natural transposition for melodrama.
Very often the whole cast is transported, while the
audience is having an interval drink, to Ashanti
or Thibet, for no earthly reason whatever, except
that the property master had some stuff that
would look well in an Ashanti forest or a Thibetan
Llamasery. The exciting scenes in S’Africa, and
the wreck of a transport on its way back from
Boer-slaying, are very effectively set forth, and the
company does justice to its opportunities. In ad-
dition to the principals mentioned, Edmund
Duggan, as a manly cleric, and O. R. Stanford, as
Jim Dench, are persons of some note.

As the Brough-Flemming Co. leaves by
the Waikare for Maoriland on Saturday of next
week, and as the Sydney public has shown no
sign that it is weary of Beauty’s flirtings and the
Bargee s haff ability, ” no change of piece is
announced. Yards and yards of Eight-Hour pro-
cession stretched around the auditorium at the
matinee on Monday, and all the federated seamen
m the yards agreed that the old Bargee (as given
by Mr. Brough) would make a humorous fellow in
the union. At next trip the Brough-Flemming
Co. will stage “ Quality.street,” a quaint, old
fashioned comedy* which Sydney has had the
misfortune to miss this time.
* * *
On October 14. after the Broughs have
departed, Alfred Dampier, a good old favorite of
whom Sydney lias seen nothing for a long while,
will take possession of the Criterion, and com-
mence his career with “ The Bush King.” Some-
thing might be said about the advisability of
making him a President instead of a King, to suit
the sensibilities of a country which has a con-
siderable republican instinct hidden away under its
clothes, but this point may stand over for further
consideration.

The march past the saluting-point of the
victorious Jap troops at the review held by Gene-
ral Nogi, after the fall of Port Arthur, beats all
ordinary processions out of sight. One wonders,
as the line stretches out past the crack of doom,
were any of the Japs killed, or were any absent in
hospital, or was it no one’s day for doing
hari-kari ? The Bulletin, it may be men-
tioned, is retrospecting on Mr. J. C. Williamson’s
Bio-Tableau, now starring at the Palace Theatre,
Sydney. All the pomp and circumstance, and
mighty little of the horrid details and sordid
effects of warfare are shown in the Bio-Flick.
But the Wandering Jew, Scenes in the Life of
Napoleon, the Land of the Midnight Sun, and
other non-bluggy pictures give a brilliant diversity.
The Bio-Flick will razzle until the order “Lights
out ” is given by the management.

If the Professional Musicians had adver-
tised their inauguration concert as “ A Saturday
Pop ” it would surely have drawn a good house.
Programme was capitally selected and ex-
cellently performed, but the advertised words,
“Symphony Orchestra,” scared the populace,
and the few Sydney-siders who would be
attracted by the blessed word Symphony said
they’d go next time-after Brown had told
them how he and Smith liked the first one. Either
that or they went as far as the Lyceum d.c. steps,
when perhaps their courage failed them. Those
steps look as if they led to a prison for steerage
passengers. If management won’t wash them,
at least it ought to provide rushes and
strew them with those old-fashioned vegetables.
Then it would be able to let the sanctified barn
some more. The Misses Collins, two Queensland
girls, with excellent soprano voices that showed
considerable training, made their first appearance
at the “Symphony.” Two solos and a duet
proved them to be an agreeably gifted pair of
youngsters and deserving of all the approving
noise an audience could make.
** * *
It was a pity that Miss Nance O’Neil
smudged her Sydney season with such a produc-
tion as “ The Fires of St. John.” That “master
work ” of Sudermann deals simply and straightly
with a squalid sex incident of the most repulsive
kind and that, too, “with the gloves off.” In the
farm-house of Brauer lives his wife, his daughter
Gertrude, and a foundling adopted daughter
called Marie. Brauer’s nephew, George, amuses
his adolescence by seeking to seduce Marie
in a rough and ready fashion, and doesn’t
succeed. Some years have passed over that
incident when the play opens with George
affianced to Gertrude, and Marie just awakened
to the fact that she “ loves ” George. Theeveofthe
wedding, George and Marie are left alone together
and she seduces him. Kneeling to him, she tells
him that she was sorry that she resisted him
before, and then, in a finale which it is impossible
to describe, it is made clear that no scruples
remain on either side. The light is shut off from
the stage at the critical point lest the curtain
shouldn’t come down quickly enough ; it is a wise
precaution. Next day George marries Gertrude.
* • • •
There can be no pretence that there is any
“ art ” reason for all this nastiness. There is no
shadow of a “problem” such as was urged in
justification of the nauseous “Resurrection.”
The play is just a sordid immorality incident be-
tween a man who is a low cad and a woman who
must be physiologically a maniac, for it is not
natural for an inexperienced woman to take a man
by storm. It is worse than the “Resurrection”
seduction incident, worse than “The Sign of the
Cross ” criminal assault scene, in its revolting and
unreal “realism.” The only literary production
of any note in the same camp is Zola’s “La
Terre.” It is not fair to the general public to stage
such stuff in a theatre to which both sexes and
all ages have access. Only a woman who has
attained the lateral mental development of the ex-
perienced matron could view it unharmed, and it
would not be a pleasant experience for her. Like
the sermons of the improper evangelists it should
be advertised “ For men only ” —if produced at all.
** * *
There isn’t a house in Sydney that answers
more promptly to the call of a good bill-of-fare
than the Tivoli. Manager Rickai'ds’ patrons are
connoisseurs in their way; they can’t be “ kidded ”
with big type and large ink-splashes— not to any
great extent, anyway. For a while lately the
place had large empty spaces ; now, with Rickards’
out scouting for new turns, the empty spaces are
disappearing, and some nights have vanished
altogether. And the bill (the same much-improved
bill that was noted last week) deserves the
business.

Paul Kruger—sexagenarian Kruger on
whom the sun was shining 25 years ago—crops up
again in Bland Holt’s current drama, at Mel-
bourne Royal, where the old man victorious gets a
“reception,” which amounts to a severe comment
on the subsequent war that knocked him out.
“ For England ” is a wide episodical fiction of the
Majuba period, with one act placed in the Trans-
vaal. The dear old Union Jack finally waves
triumphant under audaciously imaginative condi-
tions. The Boers seem to have all the best of it,
in accordance with history, until Lieutenant
Walter Baker is taken prisoner, whereupon the
British rally to the rescue, and the result is an
amazing battle tableau constructed on Waterloo
lines, and showing Baker in the military capa-
city of Bill Adams. He gets the Victoria Cross
for his valor, and returns to England in time
to explain that his late father’s murderer was not
himself, as his blind mother supposed, but Albert
Norman, a villain who has been chasing his
“revenge ” to S’Africa and back until his mono-
mania reduced him to a human wreck. The
earlier acts of “For England” are devoted to
love, and gee-gee, and Manasses Marks, a money-
lender, played by Bland Holt. A hunting scene,
the most picturesque and stirring thing of its kind
in Holt’s horsey records, leaves that active and
intelligent low comedian dangling from an oppor-
tune tree bough, whilst his docile steed walks
away from between his agitated legs. Bland’s
legs appear later in black tights, with trimmings
round the ankles, what time he masquerades as a
preposterous Zulu, but he returns to trousers at
the finish and delivers Norman up to justice. It


The name of the Senator who allows his
aged parents to live on an old age pension hasn’t
transpired yet. Dr. Lloyd, the remarkable Mel-
bourne J.P., who spoke very severely in public
about this alleged abandoned character, now
admits that he has no idea which Senator he was
talking about or where the Senator comes from.
He had been informed of the fact on a postcard
by a person unknown. Some of Dr. Lloyd’s
judgments look as though they were also supplied
on a postcard by parties unknown.

is a memorable finish, mainly on account of a
youthful Manasses—the alleged offspring of Bland
aforesaid. Manasses junior is the weirdest pos-
sible conception of a young Chosen person. His
gentle, nightmare smile is a whole map of Israel.
His trunklike nose suggests a Biblical miracle of
old. Nothing in Brunton’s scenery is quite so
impressive as this Little Benjy, and he has the
further distinction of being alive.

If the story were more reasonable, Walter
Baker’s manly bearing and fine, hearty voice
would make his heroism absolutely convincing.
The British Government should recognise the ser-
vices of Walter as a “ loyalty ” promoter. He plays
his part for ten times its real dramatic worth, and
stems the tide of sympathy that flows towards the
Boer characters. Sty an,-Brawn and others lend a
little comic relief to the bit of Imperial bunting,
whilst Max Maxwell shines somewhat as a
chivalrous Boer, and Norman is the English traitor
who shoots him. The principal women parts,
played by Misses Boss, Ireland, Pollack and Mrs.
Holt, are named Alma, Vera, Lesbia and Keziah,
and, with the exception of Lesbia, who retires
early, they fall into the hands of the Boers, and
narrowly escape an awful doom. But their mis-
fortunes are of minor importance.

The well-decorated but otherwise deplor-
able drama—“ His Majesty’s Servant”—was to
flaunt its foolishness before a disappointed public
at the Princess’s until Tuesday of this week.
“Monsieur Beaucaire” will serve three nights,
and on Saturday a revival of “The Darling of the
Gods ’’comes due. “ The Darling ”is to elevate
Miss Jeffries to the outer heaven for one week,
but it is seemingly an open question whether
Julius Knight will reach the rolling clouds on
this occasion. A painful advt. credits Julius with
the intention to appear as the Lord High Execu-
tioner, a notoriously evil Jap who has hitherto
been and and beyond doubt. One is loth to be-
lieve, however, that the Darling of the Girls can
ever go elsewhere than upwards when he dies.
Probably the angels will manage to smuggle him
away on a rainbow of repentance.

The second month of “The Cingalee,” at
Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), is passing away like
the first one, and Bantock is understood to have
got married in the meantime. Miss Thomas sings
charmingly, the Tea girls cluster round their young
man as before, the missing birthmark retains its
vague significance, the rickshaw is there when re-
quired, and the new extras by Lauri and Miss
Rose Musgrove continue to catch on. The Golly -
wog marries the Dollywog nowadays, and the re-
sult of their dumb union is the Babywog, which
the happy father views with astonishment on his
return from the wars.

Reginald Ford, M.R.G.S., has lately been
talking of the South Polar regions in front of a
well-illustrated sheet at Melbourne Town Hall
and the Athenaeum Hall. Reginald (M.R GS )
refrains from blowing about the dangers and
inconveniences he put up with aboard the good
ship Discovery, and on the ice that blocked her
voyage. He was more modest than half-a-dozen
war lecturers of the Villiers type, and he is
chirpy and fluent, but there is no obvious reason
why Waxeellency Madden or John Forrest should
act as chairman in his honor. Moreover, the
Waxeellency is an error in tactics, seeing that the
public are wisely wary of any show which begins
with somebody in the chair. Reginald Ford, not-
withstanding the letters after his name,’ is a
showman. Hereafter he will travel with a lantern
and 130 slides, under the direction of Edwin
Geach, who regards an Antarctic adventurer or a
conjuror with the same cold commercial eye.

In the presence of a large weather-beaten
audience Prince’s Court declared itself open for a
second season on Saturday night. The Court
with its Chute, Toboggan-slide, Cafe Chantant]
&c., was a very prosperous undertaking last
summer, and now its joys are more varied and the
appointments in general are smarter. A Helter-
Skelter is anew development (or devilment) in
rapid down-hill flight warranted to cure the worst
form of liver complaint with one application of the
treatment. A series of war pictures worked with
moveable figures and assisted by cannonades, are
shown in anew wooden hall, 30yd. x 20yd., and a
new lady diver splashes in the tank where Annette
Kellermann played the mermaid of yore. The
one thing wanting at Prince’s Court just now is
better weather.

The reminiscences of old Melbournians
have received a pleasant shaking-up from the
announcement that Horace Lingard is about to
revive “Our Boys” a.t the Bijou for one week
Lingard claims to have played the aitchless
butterman in Byron’s comedy on 2000 occasions,
many of which were Australian events in the dim
long ago. Some of the surviving members of his
previous audiences will be glad to see him do it
again, if their failing limbs can climb the Bijou
steps, and for the more recent generations there is
the opportunity to sample the brightest work of
an author who was the boss humorist of his time.

At Melbourne Opera House £here are
some improvements in the first part without pre-
judice to the second part. The second part is main-
taining its vast success, and the Jackson Family
appears to grow an inch taller in popular esti-
mation every week. The Jacksons changed their
musical programme last Saturday. The conjuring
triumvirate—Le Roy, Talma and Bosco—will
change their programme next Saturday, and pro-
duce a fresh crop of strange deceptions and un-
accountable poultry. Meanwhile, a wire-fencing
is drawn across the front boundary of the stage to
prevent the geese and things from seeking refuge
in the orchestra.

“ Old Heidelberg ” at Adelaide Royal was
very well received, particularly by the feminine
part of the audiences. Harcourt Beatty did fine
work in a part not too well suited to him, and the
same may be said of Miss Nellie Stewart. In the
writer’s opinion, her growing mannerisms—always
most noticeable just when she aims at appearing
specially aytless and unaffected—don’t go well
with the simple “ Bitte, madeken, zwei glas bier ”
type of character. As for the play, it must rank
with ‘ Trilby as an exotic plant. The gallery—
a German gallery—flatters itself, by the way that
it could name the original of the Prince who was
kept on a chain by his court officials. The co. has
since fallen back on to the old familiar ground of
“ Sweet Nell,” the lady who got rid of all her
rivals in the monarch’s affections—and then said
“good night” and went home. At the Tivoli
I rank Clark and Harry Shine are still rioting
through a picnic known as Muldoon’s, but the

AT POVERTY POINT.
In publishing- a photo, of Miss Florrie Green as “ the
most accomplished dancer in Australia,” The Bulletin, it
seems, raised a storm of dissent from the champions of
the other Melbourne dancing- school, run by the Misses
Hyams. Whereas graceful Miss Florrie embodies all the
virtues of the Green Academy, the airy Miss Maud
Chetwynd trips to the glory of the Hyams school, where
she was formerly a pupil teacher. But there can be no
question as to which is “ the more versatile artist.” Mrs.
Green’s daughter has been an accomplished performer in
public since she was a kiddie.
Cora Urquhart Brown-Potter appeared at the London
Bankruptcy Court last month ; this being the last act of
a sort of tragedy. Mrs. Potter bore up well till she was
asked why she had removed from Bray Lodge two little
Shetland ponies which ought to have been sold under the
bill of sale. Here she broke down, and sobbed bitterly,
I—l was very fond of those two little ponies ! ” Later
in the case she stated, in reply to a question, that the
most successful season she ever had was in ’97 in Aus-
tralia, when she made £9OOO. Her income since had been
about £5OOO per annum.
“S.S.”: “His Majesty’s Servant” at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s is the sort of play that turns the democratic stomach
and justifies the growing contempt for the stage and the
stage-player. In it everything that served for England
and the people against the Stuarts in the great Civil War
is made gross and venal. The piety of the Roundheads is
an abomination ; they are represented as hypocrites,
thieves, curs, and abusers of women. John Lambert,
hero of many a tough battle, is a despicable craven, and
Monk alone is allowed a rag of decency, because he it was
who made the re appearance of that prinked ape, Charles
11., possible in England. Meanwhile, there is comfort in
hearing women complaining that men are deserting the
theatre as they have deserted the ballroom. Such plays
as “ His Majesty’s Worm ” do not attract real men.
“Synic”: The management’s faith in Julius Knight as
a popular “draw” explains the production of “His
Majesty’s Servant,” the weakest and silliest of melodramas
that pretend to be high-class. The consistent unreality
of an Andersonian “ shocker ” is almost preferable to the
foolishness of the aforesaid costume play, written by two
women. A Melbourne girl, who has a romantic affection
for Walter Scott’s novels, suggests that if a. story
of Charles the Second’s early days was wanted the
authoresses of “ His Majesty’s Servant ” might have con-
structed a better play from “ Woodstock.” But
Scott’s yarn has presumably been already dramatised
more than once.
George Rignold’s name isn’t often in the advts. these
times ; but it got in last week. It was in a big formal thing
relating to land about to be brought under the R. P. A.
But the formal person insisted on spelling him George
Richard Rig-nail.
“0.K.” : Watching the Melbourne “Players” at work
upon “ Dandy Dick,” t’other night, one was disposed to
complain not so much of the want of ease in the ama-
teurs’mumming as of its general triviality. They give
so little weight to their characterisations. ’ The best per-
formance—that of the Dean, by a Mr. Hardinge—was
“ thin ” and youthful. Hardinge is an intelligent actor,
and versatile as amateurs go. He played the cockney
sailor, in “ The French Maid,” with abandon, and he got
some clever touches of clerical color into his picture of
the Dean. But he didn’t make himself nearly as old and
pompous as he should have been. The dignitary of 55, or
so, looked not more than 30, in spite of his grey hair,
whilst his widowed sister, the horsey Georgina (played by
Miss Lydgate), had the manners of a girl of about 22. A
similar lack of deliberation in everybody’s speech and
action accounted for the performance falling fully twenty
minutes short of ordinary professional time. Measured
by the clock an amateur performance never goes slow, if
it has been carefully rehearsed. It lacks the weight that
would steady it.
Lempriere Pringle has lately been doing Mephistopheles,
in scenes from the “ Faust ” opera, at London Coliseum,
and the work of that imposing basso gets particular praise!
Tasmania produced two high-class singers in Amy Sherwin
(who went to London years before Melba) and Lempriere
Pringle, but the little island seems to have exhausted
its, vocal strength.
The resemblance in face, figure and style between the
returned Maggie Stirling and Lady Hopetoun is mostly
remarked by people who never met the songstress on the
platform before she went to Europe. The resemblance
now is not as striking as it was of yore. At one time,
Melbourne had two duplicates of Lady Hopetoun appear-
ing in public—Miss Maggie Stirling and Miss Jennings
Carmichael, v. ,o wrote pretty little verses for the Aus-
tralasian. It was hard to say which of them looked the
more like a twin-sister of the vice-regal lady. Jennings
Carmichael took the platform on two or three occasions
as a lecturess on Australian Poetry or “ The Spirit of the
Bush,” or something, and spoke her yarn gracefully in a
sweet voice—the sympathetic sick-room voice of a pro-
fessional nurse. Then she went to England and died, as
nice ex-nurses are too apt to do.
A gentleman of the name of Satan is appearing at
Glasgow Pavilion. He should be a devilish good per-

A lot of Scawttish cautiousness is practised by the audi-
ences at Jessie Maclaehlan’s concerts. Sandy, in the first
instance, samples the auld songs from a shilling seat, and
if favorably impressed he pays another bawbee and moves
forward. Or two of Sandy take a twa shilling seat
between them, and No. 1 retires at half-time in favor of
No, 2, who comes along on his brither’s pass-out check.
They have a long and earnest dispute as to how the two
halves of the entertainment shall be allotted, and if both
favor the first part they toss up for best innings—best 6
out of 10.
Jones, a nigger corner-man with Frank Clark’s show,
sing-s a song called “ I’ve got a white man working for
me.” It tells of a nigger who pays a white man two
dollars to shovel a load of coal into a cellar, and as the
white man toils the nigger sits on a fence and sings, jeer-
ingly, “I’ve got a white man working for me.” °ln the
second verse the white man gets annoyed, and throws
the nigger and the black audience that has collected
round him down into the coal-cellar, and the bruised coon
has a white man working for him no longer.
On a recent Monday night (Sept. 26th) “ The Cingalee ”
was nearly broken in two at Her Majesty’s Theatre, Mel-
bourne, by a tack that stood on the stage with the busi-
ness end upwards. At that point where Margaret Thomas
plants a soft, convincing kiss on the mouth of Haigh Jack-
son, and the long baritone should assume a look of idiotic
happiness, his features suddenly twisted in agony. The
audience wondered what Margaret had been eatino-, till
Jackson stooped and with a mouth working like a valve
pulled out of the sole of his boot and threw to the ground
something that fell with the tap of steel. Then Jackson
walked out on one heel and one toe, without waiting to
kiss or sing any more. It was fortunate that the tack
was not discovered by one of the four Cingalee maidens
who sit down with such a heart-stirring thump on the
floor.
“Edyson”: Am just recovering from that stunned
feeling after a visit to “The Cingalee.” Nothing in the
merit or demerit of the performance produced the shock,
but when the play was nearly over I suddenly recollected
that somebody had been awarded £4OOO damages or
something, because somebody else had borrowed or
conveyed the amazing original features of his comic
opera and built “The Cingalee” out of them. The fact
got me down. Why, I wonder in a dazed way, am I
writing comparatively difficult stuff, and selling it for
shillings, while it is possible to have second and third
hand matter stolen from one at such enormous profits. I
write to say I’ll provide thousands of similar ideas, and
go halves in the damages with the collaborator who will
provide the thief. Consider “The Cingalee” opening in a
tea garden, as “ Florodora ” did in a flower garden. Lauri
is chasing a little lost princess in “The Cingalee ” ;he was
chasing a little lost heiress in “ Florodora.” As a Chow
in “San To3',” Lauri steals things, and makes precisely
the same comic excuses as he does when he steals things
as the cocoa-colored humorist in “The Cingalee.” In
“ San Toy ” the heroine is borne away to a nabob’s palace ;
the same thing happens in “The Cingalee.” The
‘ Prapses” happen in “Florodora”; the “ Golly wogs”
happen in “ The Cingalee.” Where is the £4OOO worth of
material, that the builders of “The Cingalee” cribbed
from the niilitafy gentleman? The value of the thin«-
must lie in the 'fact that the brown girls dress in tight
white bed-gowns, and frequently assume a bowling posi-
tion with their backs to the audience. This is considered
a successful feature and meets with genera] approval, and
yet when Nance O’Neil merely turned her broad back on
the public how the experts yelled 1 I give it up.
A daughter of the late “Teddy" Lonnen promises to

“His Majesty’s Servant” lets loose a Swinburnian re-
miniscence—" I’ll fight for the lilies of virtue, or die for
the roses of fame.” The ladylike authors evidently
thought Swinburne’s “ lilies and languors of virtue ” good
enough to annex, but shuddered at the thought of an
audience of the admirers of Julius Knight’s legs being
asked to contemplate “ the raptures and roses of vice.”
“Melb.”: Stepping into a Victoria Parade tram, on
Sunday night, I met Fifine. Not wishing to glance rudely
at a strang-er, as I thought, I yet was conscious of the
presence of a most beautiful young lady, something
Parisienne, dressed in a salmon-lined fabric or confection
of perfect taste. Fifine ! Ten years younger than she was
10 years ago. All this after a stage career of the arduous
kind. As a girl, you were plain, Fifine, and knew it.
You determined to win by talent. So you warbled
your path into our hearts, and acted with the height of
chic. But by what transformation have you entered
the ranks of Beauty ? Here you are undeniably beautiful,
after conquering the London stage as well as the Austra-
lian, and even coruscating as the Belle of Drury under as
much calcium focus as ever George Rex plunged into.
Zangwill’s “Merely Mal-y Ann,” the new play of the
Tittell Brune co., is another claimant for the tear-pro-
ducing- record, long in dispute between “Camille’’and
“ East Lynne.” It was the howling success of the season
in the Big Smoke.
Eleanora Duse, who lately gave her farewell perfor-
mance in London, is one of the few actresses who have
played Juliet at 14, at which age Shakspeare places his
heroine, though it is usually turned to 16 in the per-
formance. Duse, child and grandchild of players, was
quite a stage veteran at 14, as she had acted with a
strolling company from a very early age. Her youthful
Juliet was acted in Verona, the city of the play, with
striking success. Duse is now 44.
Howard Vernon first appeared as a professional at
Ballarat (Vic.), at the age of 18, as Eglantine Roseleaf, in
the old farce “ Turn Him Out.” His first operatic essay
was made with Madame Simonsen’s co. at Sydney in Feb.,
1872 (he played Baron Puck in “ The Grand Duchess ”).
His Melbourne debut (King Bobeche in “Bluebeard”)
was in 1873, at the Opera House, under W. S. Lyster’s
management.
I fcThe love of a gamble in our country is as characteristic
as the IO U. At the “ drammer,” the other night, Ruth
the forsaken had been kneeling, hatless, within the
shadow of the villain’s belltopper, pleading to be “ set
right before the wo-erld ; ” but Randal the Rancid had
only sneered in evening dress and moved off slowly in the
direction of the chrome and crimson sunset. The young
curate entered, an took the girl to his ’eart, and it was
just then that “the bloke” behind me broke the silence
of the gods. “’Ere,” he said, “I’m bettin’arf a dollar
the piece wid no lid marries the pilot.”
“T.D.”: Have had opportunities lately of seeing
exactly what sort of chimera is being chased by the
average Australian musician who goes to England. An
orchestra with which I sang last week at a fashionable
seaside resort included among its members one of the
world’s very best known ’cellists. The accompanist, who
was also a member of the orchestra, is ordinarily con-
ductor of one of the greatest Continental opera houses.
The double bass player was principal scraper of that
unweildy instrument at Drury Lane ; and the first violin
is known throughout Germany as leader of a big orchestra
there. Salaries averaged £3 a week. Of course they
were only filling in time during the international off-
season, but what would Hattenbach, Allpress and Co. say
to playing three programmes a day—six hours work,
seven days a week—for three obscure sovereigns.
Some more dramas suited to Anderson have been pro-
duced in London lately. One of them rejoices in a festive
heroine known as the Tiger Lily, whose mother (a circus
lady) was bitten by a tiger shortly before the birth of her
offspring. Therefore, the Lily is addicted to tigerish
instincts when the moon is at its full, and she goes around
clawing and scratching her acquaintances with all the
ferocity of the animal that bit mother. In another
current bellowdrama the principal man is a vampire, with
a countenance like unto the “ Face in the Coal-Scuttle.”
Every time the Vampire wants a new lease of life he kills
a pure young maiden and sucks her blood. Another male
character is about to commit suicide when he meets an
evening-dressed toff who wears a red mask, and proposes
a game of cards to decide which of them shall jump over
a cliff. The toff, losing the game, carries out iiis contract
faithfully, but before tumbling off the cliff he gives the
red mask to the other man and bids him wear it until
death, and the other fellow masks himself accordingly.
The grotesque horrors that delight Cockney audiences
appear to be going from awful to worse. Australia, by
the grace of Anderson, is bound to get the pick of these
shocks, so there’s a time coming when the “ Countenance
at the Ash-barrel ” and the “ Galvanised Corpse ” will be
remembered as insipid suggestions of future enormities.
“ S.S.”: To my mind, and speaking as a mere man, the
best-dressed woman on the Australian stage just now is
Harrie Ireland, of Blandolt’s co. The tall, auburn native
carries a frock to perfection, and her dresses are devised
with wonderful taste and artistic discernment. I dare
say there are several actresses in Australia who spend
twice as much on their wardrobes, but there is not one
who gives as much satisfaction. H.l.’s clothes are artfully
composed, they belong to her alone, and in color, forni,
and fit deserve the prize every time.
“ T.D.”: Went round to London Oxford Hall to hear
the Fitzstubbs twins, from Sydney, do their first turn on
the English boards, and sustained a great shock in an
incidental way. Programme gave out that somebody
named Kopski was going to do something, and presently
an apparition manifested itself in verification of the
announcement. It was suave, clean-shaven, dress-suited,
and carried a head of hair modelled on the Liszt pattern,
and it made some remarks to the audience about classical
music, after which it sat down at a grand piano and was
joined by the skimpy orchestra in a Mendelssohn
concerto. I was puzzled as to the identity of the
apparition. It seemed familiar, yet I knew not Kopski.
At last the truth flashed upon me. It was David Cope,
formerly a Sydney pianist, who has apparently found
someone’s hair restorer extremely efficacious. David
seems to have struck petroleum.
Travelling Australians, who are used to the complete-
ness with which grand opera is staged in Sydney and
Melbourne, when it is staged at all, ' are knocked over
when they first hear the older operas at Covent Garden
and some other great European houses. During the
recent Covent Garden season the recitative portions of
such old favorites as “ Don. Giovanni,” “Don Pasquale,”
and “ II Barbiere ” were accompanied, not by the orches-
tra, but by a tinkling piano somewhere in the win«s.
Even when Caruso sang, his voice was supported merely
by a chord here and there, and after an act or two the
persistent “tum-tum,” always on the same couple of
chords, was extremely irritating.

[For The Bbueti n.]
I might have kissed you, my sweet, m.v sweet,
On that bright, starlit night in the olden time.
In “Lovers’ Retreat ” in that golden time,
I might have kissed you—’tvvas meet, ’twas meet,
For roguishly smiling, with eyes a-dance,
You dared mo to do it; I missed my chance !
I might have lost you if I had been
Content with the answer you gave me first—
The positive “ No ! ” in decisive burst ;
Yes, then had I lost you, my queen, my queen !
Again I besought you. With downcast glance,
You answered me “ Yes ” ; I had missed my chance
I might have died and been laid to rest,
When I was so ill in the Spring last year.
But still I recovered, my dear, my dear,
For I thought that your heart would be grief opprest.
Ah, folly of mine to quit that trance !
I might have been buried ! I missed my chance !

The holy calm of the Methodist Church at
West Devonport (Tas.) was disturbed during a
recent week-night service by the apparition of a
male person who had nodings on, save a handker-
chief tied around his head. For the rest of him,
he was as bare as Adam before the Drop. The
fleshly visitant entered at the main doorway of
the tabernacle, bowed to the officiating shepherd,
and petered into the outer- darkness. The choir
was singing a hymn at the time, and the lady
warblers, it seems, had been gazing at the appari-
tion with doubting eyes until the shepherd
remarked to the leading basso, “That man is
naked,’ whereupon the basso went in vain pursuit
of the retreating form. Worshippers facing the
pulpit saw nothing of the awful thing, but they
knew by the blushes of the girl choristers that an
object of shocking interest must have put in an
appearance. In the event of the nude person re-
peating his offence, he will find the eyes of the
whole congregation on the look out for him.
IN THE STREET.
EXCITED ORATOR: “If Carruthers ’as got any
backbone ” (with emphasis) “ why don’t 'e
bring it to the front?"
The dredge Pioneer, which Premier Bent
imported from England into Victoria, turns out a
sorry joke. It was imported on the ground that
it couldn’t be made in Australia, and when it was
proved that similar dredges had already been
made in Australia, Bent was a shocked man. Also
it was imported to serve as a model for local
builders, and when he was confronted with the
fact that the plans had been drawn up here and
sent to England for the instruction of the English
builders, Bent was a confused and angry man.
Anyhow the shoddy English concern was im-
ported at great expense, and ever since it arrived
it has been under repair to make it workable, till
at last an impression begins to gain ground that
the best thing to do is to pull the bad bargain to
pieces and rebuild.
After many struggles and delays, and after
throwing up the inquiry and then coming back to
it, and after numerous stipulations about protec-
tion, Parson Woolls Rutledge gave what he called
evidence before the Select Committee in support
of his tale about a discharged N.S.W. civil servant
who couldn’t get back to the service till he turned
R.C., and who, on turning R.C., was imme-
diately re-appointed at about £lOOO a year. The
evidence was, after all, hardly worth the trouble
involved in extracting it. All that bore even
indirectly on the case was embodied in seven
umouncements:—
(1) “ Many years ago statements came to me,” &c.
(2) “ On one occasion I was informed,” &c.
(3) “Several persons spoke to me,” &c.
(4) “ One gentleman particularly was very indignant,”
&c.
(5) “ On several other occasions persons spoke to me,”
&c.
(6) “ One gentleman spoke to me seven years ago,” &c.
(7) “ A few years ago a gentleman told me,” &c.
There is a great deal of the tattling old woman
about the parsonical character. Except in one
case, Woolls Rutledge neither said who told him
nor what he really was told ; he seems to have
lived in a mist of suspicion and hysterics, like
Mrs. Snagsby, in “ Bleak House,” who had fits of
violent jealousy among the cockroaches re the
“goings on ”of parties unknown. A cold business
man would have asked for the statements in
writing ; then he would have looked up the Public
Service List to see whether the alleged convert was
really engaged at the magnificent salary alleged ;
and he would have sent an intelligent individual
to find out, at a cost of perhaps 7s. 6d., about
what date Hall began to frequent the R.C. church,
and he would have compared that date with the
date of the re-appointment. But the unbusiness-
like parson, living in an atmosphere of old women
and tea and buns, seldom does things in that
fashion. He holds up his ear like a vast paper
bag for the collection of rumors, and when his ear
is full he slops over. He hears the vague suspicions
of the old lady with her face tied up in a red cloth,
and the shadowy apprehensions of the partially-
deaf man who thinks he read somewhere that the
Pope is a quadruped, till he becomes like a large,
foolish coal-scuttle, filled with vague reports about
nothing in particular. The habit of “ visiting the
flock ” and sympathising with their corns gets him
down. Probably the best idea would be to hand
the whole business over co women, and to pass an
Act indemnifying the clerical profession in case it
says anything libellous when it has hysterics on
top of the Book of Deuteronomy.

Sub-inspector Dungey, of Melbourne, has
made the authorities there very angry by a brief
report in which he alleges that the city police are
either raw recruits or drunks, and the force has
almost torn its own uniform in its haste to

“The wickedest people in the world are
in Sydney,” according to bankrupt Moses Cohen.
Moses Cohen is himself in Sydney, by the way,
having been brought back from Auckland on a
charge of fleeing from his creditors ; so is Becky
Cohen, who was also brought back from Auckland,
and who had a large amount of money sewn up in
her singlet; and the city is also blessed with the pre-
sence of Solomon Cohen, who didn’t leave with
father Moses and sister Becky, but stayed behind
and gave them away to the creditors. Minnie
Cohen, however, is not on the premises at present.

In olden days, when troops were raised by
feudal lords from their family retainers, it was
only natural that the men should be clothed in the
livery and carry the crest of the baron,
whose servants they practically were. Now
regiments are not raised by county magnates,
and things are different. But Governor Tal-
bottle, of Victoria, went bustling down to
Hamilton, the other day, to congratulate the
members of the 11th A.L.H. Regiment on
the fact that they wear the crest of his
Excellency’s livery buttons! Fancy the
Hamilton trooper of the A.L.H. bursting with
pride at this honorable distinction, shared with
Talbottle’s flunkeys.

Bairnsdale (Vic.) is just now pondering
the case of a degenerate of an unusual
class. The damsel is 15, but “ very strong
and well-developed for her age.” Qn a recent
Saturday afternoon she took it into her head
to seize a small girl of six, bundle her into
the Roman Catholic Church in Main-street, lock
the doors, and then wallop her severely for no
apparent reason—the two being entire strangers.
She seems to have been a calm and
methodical lunatic, for she first removed the
child’s clothing, then lambasted her strenuously
with a strap, standing on her neck the mean-
while, so that the frequent passers-by should
not be disturbed by unseemly outcries.
Having thoroughly chastised the infant, the
damsel knocked loose one of her teeth, pulled it
out, and put it in the collection-box. She next
tried to soak the victim in the vessel containing
the holy water, but, finding this too small, she
dragged the unfortunate baby to an adjacent
horse-trough and soused her emphatically. Then
she cautioned the child to hold her peace, and
departed. The damsel seems a fit mate for that
crazy Cheltenham (Vic.) youth, of similar age,
who enticed a small boy from Melbourne into the
bush and practised an exactly similar piece of
liendishness on him, a couple of years ago. He
was adjudged temporarily insane, was speedily
released, and was soon after convicted of an
attempt at an even worse horror.
“T.D.”: Boothism is such a decadent
affair in its birthplace now that, after twelve
months of London, I can count on my fingers
the number of times I have heard its voci-
ferous “captings” raving and its well-drilled
bands a work. The Salvarmy is too beastly
respectable especially when one harks back to
the days when as a timid kiddie, he was
afraid of being taken through the streets of
Fog town by night because of the frequent skir-
mishes between the Boothites and the long-
vanished “Skeleton Army” which warred
upon them. The “ Army” has big,
respectable head-quarters in Queen
Victoria-street, opposite the shop
where John Taverner exhibits Vic-
torian peaches and jam, and plaster-
of-Paris nuggets. Otherwise it has
mostly deserted its back lane for a
snug little chapel that
once belonged to the
Wesleyans, or the
Baptists, or the Dir-
tites, or the Never-
Washers, or other
creeds too numer-
ous to particu-
larise. Likewise,
it has replaced
the ancient tam-
bourine and the
three -penny
mouth - organ
and the jew’s-
harp with a
beautiful mili-
tary band that
would sooner
discourse Tscli-
aikovvsky than
“ Bill Bailey,”
and the “Halle-
lujah ” wench
with a vigorous
past has given
place to a meek
Mary-had- a - little-
lamb creature who
has been carefully
brought up to be an
“Ensign” or some-
thing at an “ Army ”
establishment. It was the urgent appeal of the
Lady with a Past and the Bloke who used to stoush
policemen, that caught the London mob, but the
mob doesn’t go to the chapels which have been
acquired by Booth. The papers here publish
cables to the effect that Northcote and other
nobility have been entertaining Booth—a pretty
sure token that the white old person in the uni-
form doesn’t get down among bedrock slumdom
as he used to do.
A North Queensland court found itself
tied up in hard knots the other day. It had a
solicitor before it, charged with murder. Late in
the proceedings one of the parties wanted some
depositions put in as evidence, and the police
magistrate, who had been hearing the case, got off
the bench, on summons, to put them in. The
C.P.S. took the P. M.’s place on the bench, and
then ruled that the P.M. couldn’t put in the
depositions because he (the 0.P.5.), and not the
P.M., was the custodian of the papers. The
P.M. couldn’t argue with the C.P.S., the
C.P.S. being for the moment the boss, so
the P.M. got out of the witness-box and
went on to the bench again. Then the
C.P.S. got off the bench and went into
the witness-box, and tendered the depositions.
The P.M. said that he couldn’t over-rule the pre-
vious bench’s decision, but as the C.P.S. hadn’t
seen the depositions signed he couldn’t swear to
anything, so he (the P.M.) couldn’t let the depo-
sitions go in. Just about this time one of the
parties drew attention to the fact that the P.M.
couldn’t be both a witness and a judge in the
same case, and long arguments were threatened
on that subject, when the P.M. said he reckoned
it didn’t matter anyhow—he couldn’t think of
committing the man on the evidence. Then the
crowd cheered, the constable called for silence,
and the P.M. and the C.P.S. went into their
offices to sort themselves out.

“ 5.A.0.” : I have just been inspecting a
large printery where women compositors have
taken the place of men. The tendency of the
times seems to be that the man can’t marry
because the woman has taken his job, and the
woman can’t marry because she is too busy on the
job she has taken. Moreover, she can’t marry
because she doesn’t earn enough to keep the man,
and, in any case, the man has degenerated through
lack of employment and isn't worth marrying.
THE EXCUSE.
TEACHER : “ This doesn't look like your father's
writing, Tommy.”
TOMMY : “ Well, it’s as near as I could get to it.”
George William Carveth, an ex-naval man
who has struck hard luck at Owaki (M.L.), is
such a curious case that it is hard to say whether
he is a martyr in asm all way or otherwise. Any-
how he looks like one. In 1848 he arrived in a
gun-brig at the then perfectly new and raw settle-
ment of Maoriland, and met a girl of 16, whom he
didn’t marry, though he lived with her for a year.
Then he went away to sea, but in 1859 he met the
same girl in Sydney (she was then aged 27), and
the old love revived, and again they lived toge-
ther in peace and happiness. Later he was called
away to America, but he returned and met his
girl again at Nelson, in 1863 (she was a girl of 31
by that time), and the flower of affection bloomed
some more in the garden of life, and they lived
together for a while—and parted. When he re-
turned from China he found her living with
Mr. Brown, so he married Mrs. Nesbit.
The years rolled on. His wife died at
last, and Brown died at last, and almost
the last words of Brown were a request that
he would look after his old love (now a girl of
about 70). So the blossom of true love once more
asserted itself. By this time defendant was past
his best hustling days and- very poor, but he
bought a cart and the skeleton of a horse for 305.,
and took the old lady out for drives on fine days.
Then she fell sick, and they couldn’t well eat the
horse, so he applied for an old age pension on her
behalf, and to help her to get it swore that she
was his wife —which she wasn’t. And now the
old battler is doing 12 months.

An unemployed man reported an inter-
view with Queensland’s Treasurer recently to
some mates by paraphrasing Laurence Hope :
The Rev. Percy Nall, son of a well-known
Sydney journalist, arid a missionary in India, has
returned with a very poor account of Bengal
under British rule. The people of Eastern
Bengal, he says, are generally indifferent to
Christianity, because Western science and Western
worship of Mammon have got hold of them. Also
the Hindu—probably inspired by the example of
the Japs—is talking now of a natiorial religion,
and wants no foreign gods or goods; in some
places there is a boycott, not only of the British
missionary, but of British manufactures. In-
temperance and the use of opium are on the in-
crease, and the license of the native press is mis-
chievous. Altogether it is not a very cheering
picture, either from the missionary or the “ Im-
perial ” standpoint.

N.S.W. Attorney-General Wade finds it
hard to forget his halfback and three-quarterback
exploits in football, and thus breaks out:
It was the experience of other nations that the boys
who were bookworms did not make the practical men
who carried on the true work of a country in the battle
of life.
But the best footballer may become a lawyer, and
what then ? The lawyer class does not carry on
true work ; it is the mere hireling of the disputa-
tious, ready to argue oh either side of the case.
Max Muller and Herbert Spencer were book-
worms.

When a man wantonly addresses another
in opprobrious terms and that other feels impelled
to knock him down, but reflecting that the law
says
Whosoever in any public street, thoroughfare, or place
uses any threatening, abusive, or insulting words, or
behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace,
or whereby a breach of the peace may be occasioned,
shall, on conviction, etc.
he determines to set a good example and appeals
to the nearest police court, how does he fare ?
Badly, almost ignominiously. N.S.W. Banco
Court (Darley, Cohen and Bring) backs up the
Full Courts of Victoria and Queensland in deciding
that the offensive person must actually cause a
breach of the peace, or must be proved to have had
the intention of causing it, before a conviction can
follow. The inference appears to be that the
abused person can only get the law on his side by
first knocking down the offender to show that his
language caused a breach of the peace.

The High Court came to a great beer
decision last week. Some “dandelion beer”—
a temperance drink —was found on analysis by the
excise officers to contain more than 2 per cent, of
alcohol, the maximum allowed by the law to cheer
the heart of the teetotaller. Defendant pleaded
that, as made, his dandelion beer had nothing like
that amount of bite in it, but after it was bottled
a secondary fermentation had produced extra
alcohol, and the High Court held him blameless.
It is a, glad verdict for the prohibitionist, who will
now, probably, be able to get fairly “ forward” on
his beverage since secondary fermentation is a
thing that may happen to anybody. And if
it doesn’t happen, it may be arranged. In
the case under review there was no arrangement,
and the presence of the extra alcohol was purely
accidental. But if the accident doesn’t happen often
enough it will probably be hurried up by bad
teetotallers.
One William Cribb astonished the Brisbane
Y.M.C.A., the other day, by conditionally hand-
ing to that body a Gfeorge-street block worth
£25,000. Cribb, now pretty old, has only of late
years become religiously-inclined. A condition of
the gift is that the Y.M.C.A. pays the donor or his
wife an annuity of £4OO a year, which, at present
rental, will leave a balance of £4OO to the good
Young Men. This donation is the richest that
has yet fallen to any holy organisation in Queens-
land. The Y.M.C.A.is nowthrowingchests all over
the place, and is going to incorporate itself by Act
of Parliament, and already it talks airily of
closing the hotel on the corner when the lease
f ills ip, and of many things.
DEAR OLD UNCLE.
“ Do you believe dot all men are brothers?”
“ Vell,some of them must be, for I haf a lot of

A Melbourne bench got some information
lately as to the hours of oyster-saloon waiters,
when a couple of ex-cOuntrymen of the late
lamented Xenophon were shown to have been
worked, one 76 and the other 89 hours per week.
Eight hours’ sleep, 15 hours’ work, and one hour
for meals, toilet, recreation, amusement, etc., etc. !
Even the honoraries were shocked enough to
speak severely to the Greek sweater, and Demetrius
Phriedphysh was fined £5 altogether.
The scene at N.S.W. Lands Commission
when Peter Close confessed his master (whether
Peter spoke the truth or not has yet to be shown)
was dingily impressive. There was none of the
usual adornment of the legal tragedy—no coat of
arms, no j udicial throne, no wig of horse-hair, no
uniformed tip-staffs, criers nor police; just a
dusty room with a statuette of some forgotten
celebrity in an advanced state of grime, a
table or two, a judge looking stern and
sorry in his ordinary every-day habiliments, and a
big handsome witness seated uneasily in a chair
making statements which, if true, blighted for
ever his own character and that of W.P. Crick,
ex-Minister for Lands. A Court of Justice
showed that it could be awful without the frippery
that is defended on the ground of the necessity to
impress the vulgar, for when the reluctant witness
first mumbled “Mr. Crick,” a cold stillness, elo-
quent of much, settled on the dusty little room,
with its small group of listeners. Mr. Close was
asked as to the fate of a certain fee he had re-
ceived. Half, he said, he had devoted to his own
use. “ And the other half ? ” asked Mr. Pilcher,
suavely. “You put me in a most painful posi-
tion,” objected the witness. “And the other
half?” asked Mr. Pilcher. “That went to the
Minister.” “To whom?” “To the Minister,
Mr. Crick.” Thus the Lands Inquiry entered on
its final stage.

The art-union prize-money which “ fly-
flat ” Naughton refunded to St. Vincent’s Hospital
management will be distributed among all the
general hospitals of Victoria. This decision shuts
the mouths of numerous vociferous sectarians who
protested that their little bits in the art-union
gamble were intended to benefit St. Vincent’s
Hospital only; and they wouldn't “agree” to
any general distribution of the cash that Naughton
anted up. It didn’t occur to the owlish dissentients
that St. Vincent’s had already got the whole of
the legitimate profit of its unfortunate scheme.
The money paid away in prizes was gone for ever,
as far as the hospital was concerned, so the fact
that Naughton had handed over to the police a
portion of the fraudulently-obtained £5OO didn’t
give St. Vincent’s a just claim to it. From first
to last the detective in charge of the case treated
the hospital as an injured party, whereas the
punting public who got no chance of a prize for
their money were the injured ones. Naughton
also was taken in. Instead of the light sentence
he expected when the’tec bluffed him into relin-
quishing the boodle he received five years with
tough labor.

There are limits to the resisting power of
even a whale. The Ortona ran against one the
other day and cut it in two, greatly to the
disgust of old members of the local fish population
no doubt. There was a time when a whale could
safely bump the biggest ship that floated, but he
can’t do it now. The ocean is going to the devil,
in a Tory way of speaking. Whales are no longer
respected.

A document of great historic interest in
Australia—one which the original owners pre-
sented to Sydney Art Gallery some years ago—has
disappeared. It is the requisition written by
John Macarthur, and signed by 134 other settlers,
asking Colonel Johnston to depose Governor
Bligh and assume the reins of government. It
was in a glass case with other Johnstonian relics.
Relics have strange wandering habits. A very
early volume of the Sydney Gazette disappeared
from the Free Public Library some time ago, and

Goodchap that Australia, “to mark its gratitude
to the Royal House of Brunswick” (presumably
for having looked after the blessed succession so
well that our eyes were recently delighted by the
si gilt of the Yorklet), should change its name to
“Brunswick,” and should call its Federal capital
“ Guelph.” It is added that whilst he was Prime
Minister, G. H. Reid promised to consider this bit
of crawl.

This year the Adelaide prison authorities
have been investigating the effects of drinking
cheap wine upon all persons locked up for
drunkenness. During three months covered by
the inquiry 50 per cent, of the mm and 70 per
cent, of the women “drunks” ascribed their fall
to “ pinky.”
In preparing the next edition of his
pamphlet favoring the dumping of Chows in Aus-
tralia, bookseller Cole ought to consider a Mel-
bourne love episode. A yellow exemplifier of all
the virtues ( vide pamphlet), after helping to
develop this country’s great natural resources by
fossicking for gold at Bendigo, came to Melbourne
and paid court to a white damsel. When the lady
gave him the cold shoulder he tried persuasion, on
two occasions, by throwing corrosive acid over her.
The tractable and industrious immigrant showed
great surprise when a policeman arrested him
while he was figuring out how much more acid it
would take to soften the heart of his adored one.
Many of our lovable visitors from the land of the
stinkpot fail to see much harm in flinging corrosive
chemicals about tne landscape, and the peaceable
aliens who rioted in Little Bourke-street a while
back varied the device by throwing powdered
glass and red pepper in each other’s eyes.

The earnest Victorian agriculturist who
goes to Melbourne once a year at show-time makes
some humorous mistakes. One
of h i.m, with a rather larger
out break of whiskers than usual,
got into the cabmen’s shelter
in Carpentaria-place with the
idea that it was a tram. The
Jehu-edifice remained stolidly
where it was, but the bushy
waited on with the calm ex-
pression of a mountain waiting
for Eternity. A cabman drove
up in about three-quarters of
an hour, and persuaded Bill to
climb into his cab, as the other
vehicle was hung up for an ex-
tended course of repairs. Bill
climbed, and his whiskers
streamed proudly down Collins-
street a few seconds after, the
cab not being large enough to con-
tain them all at once. It’s an ill
mistake that doesn’t blow somebody
a fare.
Sydney Wharf Laborers’ Union used to
insist on preference to unionists on the wharves,
and framed its rules to drastically limit the
number of its members. The daily papers were
shocked at this “union tyranny,’’and the high
Protection that the wharf laborers had built
around their industry was gradually broken down.
Now investigation by the Arbitration Court shows
that the average wharf laborer cannot earn a
living wage, not so much because he is paid at too
low a rate, but because he cannot get enough
work to do. There are 1250 union men to do
work which would only suffice to keep 500 in full
employment. This, in a way, justifies the old
policy of the union which the Tory press so
bitterly denounced ; and now that same press
has the impudence to scold the Wharf Laborers’
Union for not “ better arranging the work.’’

After all, the Dill-Macky campaign does
not bite deeply into the lives of the people. The
other day, in a Vic. country town, a young woman
nearly sacrificed her life trying to rescue a boy
from drowning. And she was a strong R.C. and
the boy a son of a strong “ Orange ” family ; and
between the two families there had been a good
deal of sectarian bitterness.

An obscure item on Tasmania’s estimates
serves to show up the-British navy and its ways.
The annual cost of the occasional descent of the
warships, when the summer girl congregates at
Hobart, used to be set down as £445. Included
in this was a yearly charge of £7O for breakages.
Whether this extraordinary mortality among the
crockery was due to the light frivolity of the
summer girls is not stated, but somebody thought
that to debit one-sixth of the whole charge to
broken glass and china was too strong, and dif-
ferent arrangements were made. The Admiral
now pays for his own breakages, and the break-
ages are said to have got down to about £2 a year.
Which suggests that the summer girl doesn’t dance
on the best tea-set now.

We consequently have placed upon us the positive duty
of so directing the industrial life of the State that oppor-
tunities for the youth of the community to earn some
contribution to the maintenance of their home shall not
be unduly restricted, and in no way can this be more
legitimately done than in the distributing houses—
drapery emporiums, ironmongery establishments, and the
concerns which adopt the title of universal providers, and
others whose business entails the handling of large quanti-
ties of merchandise covering innumerable small items and
great variety of goods, and necessitating the division of
the business into numerous departments.
A noble ideal. Make ribbon-sellers of our boys !

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Treasurer Carruthers has decided on a new way
of presenting N.S. W. revenue returns ; he keeps the
revenue from the business undertakings separate from
other receipts. “ Revenue proper ”he calls the latter,
which is by way of a joke, seeing that the total includes
proceeds of land sales, repayments made to the Advances
to Settlers Board, and rents from “Rocks” resumptions.
Proceeds of land sales are not revenue ; and why
Sydney Harbor Trust should be a “ business under-
taking ” while the Rocks resumptions are not, isn’t
explained. The division is arbitrary and absurd.
The Advances to Settlers business is as much a commer-
cial undertaking as the Sydney Harbor Trust ; and the
interest on country towns water supply and sewerage is as
much a receipt from a business undertaking as the re-
venue from the Metropolitan and Newcastle water and
sewerage systems. Oarruthers’ object is apparently to
crowd into his “ revenue proper ” list as many as possible
of the things that don’t call for any expenditure, and to
put into the “ business undertakings ” just those things
that call for heaviest expenditure ; so that presently
Joseph will be able to discard the “business undertak-
ings” altogether when comparing his own vast
qualities as an economical financier with the
“ extravagance ” of the Australian Government. The
Darling Harbor rents are “revenue proper”;
they will swell Joseph’s figures, and there won’t
be any expenditure to speak of on the other side. The
same with “country towns water supply—interest ” : this
will swell revenue, and there will be no expenditure
against it; it is merely a matter of collecting interest
from local councils. The same with the advances to
settlers repayments and interest. On “ revenue proper ”
J. Carruthers will thus be able to show a surplus of vast
proportions, available for interest and the assistance of
“ business undertakings.”
For all practical purposes this shuffling of figures
is worth nothing—probably less than nothing, because
Treasurer Carruthers will no doubt arrange matters so as
to reflect great glory upon himself, and that may help to
maintain this unsatisfactory person in office longer than
he might otherwise stay there. Further, it is possible
that, since Carruthers only includes in the “business
undertakings” those few works which give the best
return, he will use that return as a bait with which to
borrow more money for other “ business undertakings” ;
the vast amount spent in other things which are not in-
cluded in Carruthers’ “ business undertakings ” will be
pushed under the counter, or otherwise kept hidden.
But this one thing is certain : Carruthers and Carruthers’
officers can’t make one division when dealing with
revenue and another when dealing with capital
and loans. If they say that the railways and tram-
ways, Harbor Trust, and Sydney and Newcastle
water and sewerage services are the State’s only
business undertakings, then they will have to also reckon
those as the only permanent and reproductive works in
which Cohen’s money has gone ; and in that case the
frayed gag that practically the whole of Cohen’s money
is in “ permanent and reproductive works ” —that is, in
“business undertakings”—will have to be dropped. In
short, either Carruthers’ division of the public debt, or
his new division of the public revenue and expenditure,
is a hollow fraud. To a great extent they are probably
both frauds.

John Jacob Schuh, manager for a firm with the
beautiful names of Schneider and Abrahams, lately gave
some interesting information to the Senate’s Select
Committee on the Tobacco Monopoly. He reckoned that
now the Tobacco Combine, or Trust, or Shark, or Octopus,
or whatever it should be called, manufactures about three-
fourths of the Australian output of cigarettes, and that
.Schneider and Abrahams produce the other fourth or
thereabouts. The rest of the manufacturers, he holds,
are hardly worth counting. Therefore if Schneider and
Abrahams are swallowed up the Combine will own the
whole business. The Combine supplies most of the
demand for machine-made cigarettes, while the
other firm is in the hand-made business, but as
the Combine has started to turn out hand-made
cigarettes also it evidently intends to annex everything - .
It considers that the cigarette business is its pie, and like
a great American pie-biter, it means to have that pie un-
less the Government intervenes. And it means to have
the tobacco and cigar pie also, likewise any 7 other pie it
sees lying around. According to John Jacob Schuh—
who, being in the business himself, has no love for a
Federal tobacco monopoly, and, therefore, isn’t likely to
encourage it by promising large profits—the Australian
Government could make about £48,500 a year more, by
running the cigar and cigarette manufacture as a Govern-
ment monopoly, than it makes out of the Customs and
excise on these articles. Probably if the Government
monopoly included tobacco, a profit of £lOO,OOO would
easily be made—perhaps more than that, for allowance
must be made for the fact that John Jacob Schuh wasn’t
trying to encourage a Government monopoly. That in-
come would pay off the cost of the transcontinental rail-
way to Port Darwin inside 20 years—perhaps in much less
time —and the transcontinental line would add a new
State to Australia. The idea has much to recommend it.
Australia doesn’t owe anything to the tobacco octopus
that it should be tender about treading on the eight legs
of the creature.

A table with a bearing on the Australian
financial situation:—
British National Debt. Average
Reduction Increase Price of
(millions). (millions). Consols.

1894 .. 5 .. .. 101
1895 .. 7 .. .. 106

1901 .. .. 58 .. 94
1902 .. .. 61 .. 94
1903 .. .. 31 .. 90
1904 .. .. .. 88
The quotations down to 1901 are for 2f per cents. ; after
that for 2j per cents. ; but that does not affect
the movements. While the debt was being reduced
the price of the national stock went up rapidly,
and with hardly a break ; as soon as the reduction was
stopped and the debt began to mount again, the price
dropped just as rapidly and regularly as it had risen
before. , Some other causes were probably at work ; but
giving all that in, the figures are a striking proof of the
effect of a sinking fund on public credit, in 1897, while
Britain was steadily wiping off seven millions a year, it
could have borrowed for renewal purposes at 112 ; in 1904,
when the sinking fund had been dropped, and the debt
had for years been increased instead of diminished, the
same transaction could only have been carried through at
88 —on 24 per cent, worse terms, that is, than previously 7.
Australia, during the next 10 years, has loans amounting
to £66,077,000 falling dqe, which will have to be renewed ;
and if it doesn’t take the hint thrown at it by the British
figures (and Canadian figures throw out the same hint),
it will miss a. remarkably fine business chance. If a reso-
lute effort to establish a sinking fund out of revenue
(every other sort of sinking fund is a fraud) won’t appeal.
to some reformers as a matter of common honesty, it
might appeal to them as a good stroke of business.

There is again vague mention in Sydney of a
desirable bank amalgamation—the A.J.S. and the City,
with probably a separate Assets Realisation concern to
take over any inoperative accounts. A large saving in
expenses could be made, and possibly a large increase in
efficiency, if the suggestion were carried into effect. In
their present condition neither of them is sufficiently pro-
gressive to be much of. a credit to Australian banking ;
and, though the new deposits in the A.J.S. are amply
covered and more than covered by the whole of the securi-
ties, while the City’s deposi to are safeguarded by the bank’s
large capital, the whole banking position would look better
if the two concerns were put on a new basis. As for the
City, whose shares have suffered severely of late, the last
balance-sheet showed that it could write a further 33 per
cent, off all assets, other than coin, &c., out of share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves). But it is just as
certain as anything can be that is based on published
figures, that no such writing-off is called for. If only the
small reserves and half the capital were written off, the
disclosed earnings would be equal to £6 Is. 2d. per cent,
on the other half, which is about the same as the Com-
mercial of Sydney’s earnings, and rather more than those
of most Australian banks. These shares are £8 paid ;
present market value is about 575. 6d. On the published
accounts, and assuming that the bank is writing-off
enough for current bad debts, the market has thus taken
quite a gloomy enough view of the shareholders’ position.
If something cannot be done in the way of amalgamation,
then the City’s position would be strengthened by facing
the situation and writing down values. The return
would then show up decently, and a deal of unnecessary
anxiety would not be felt —in fact, it wouldn’t be
suggested.

The figures which follow, relating to the year’s
business of the principal Australian gas co.’s, are not
worth as much as such figures ought to be worth. The pro-
fits are shown net ; but it is not possible to say in most
cases whether a fair amount, and in some cases whether
any amount at all, has been allowed for depreciation.
Further, whereas some co.’s put their depreciation allow-
ance aside and call it a reserve fund, in which cases the
reserve is not a real reserve at all, others write the
amount off absolutely, and it disappears from the accounts
altogether. With a few exceptions there are no published
accounts worth less than those of gas co.’s, and no class
of security, as a whole, in which the investor is more in
the dark, assuming he can’t go further than the published
accounts for information. The result is some-
times the disaster that has happened to the
Rockhampton (Q.) concern, which gaily went ahead pay-
ing big dividends until part of the works was run to an
absolute standstill ; then, without any reserve to replace
the worn-out plant, a large part of the business neces-
sarily collapsed, and dividends collapsed with it. Such as
they are, here are the figures :

No other class of business generally in the hands of public
co.’s pays such large divs., on the whole, as this of gas
supply. Launceston gets down to 4 p.c., but that is
because of the cheap municipally-owned electric supply
with which gas has to compete. Gas co.’s generally scorn
the suggestion that they hold a monopoly. They quite
approve the competitive system, they say. And this 4
p.c. dividend is the result in almost the only case in which
there is any real competition. Otherwise gas is generally
a most profitable business. The Brisbane co. shows, for
the past half-year, a profit at the rate of £lO 11s. 6d. p.c.
p.a. on its entire assets. South Brisbane shows £9 15s. ;
Bendigo just upon £9 ; Goulburn, £8 16s. ; Brighton
(Vic.), £7 10s; Newcastle and North Shore, £7 ss. ; the
Melbourne co., after paying - heavy interest, £6 2s. Id. ;
the Sydney co. (Australian Gaslight) £6 Bs., after paying
interest on loans (including debentures) amounting to
£436,453 at June 30 last. Taking capital and reserves as
at the date of the last available balance-sheets, the profits
on shareholders’ funds made by the co.’s of the State
capitals were

Lighting is a public necessity ; and the public pays from
£7 up to nearly £l9 per cent, to companies for the supply
of it. Such figures are not calculated to make the public
more content with private ownership.

During - the year the co. has raised £30,000 on bonds,
though only £20,000 is shown in the present accounts.
The premiums on this issue., £B4, instead of being put to
reserve, are shown in profit and loss, and included in un-
divided profit in the balance-sheet. The amount is small,
but it remains an unsatisfactory way of dealing with the
matter, all the same. The co. 12 months ago had £29,930
of floating debt, including overdraft. The bond-issue has
wiped off £12,478 ; the balance of the money has gone
into plant. Even now, therefore, there remains £17,452
of “ sundry creditors,” so that the co. will not have a
clean sheet even after it takes the other £lO,OOO of bonds
into account. For a co. which has been making such
large profits this is not satisfactory. Still, the co.’s slide
backwards has been stopped. Some figures

In 1904 things had drifted so far that the div. was only
shown as fully earned by cutting down the allowance for
wear and tear ; but things have improved a little. Even
now, however, the allowance is under 2 per cent, of the
total sunk in plant, works, &c. ; and it is doubtful
whether that is adequate, remembering that the 2 per
cent, (or less) has to cover repairs and renewals, which are
not separately charged, as in some concerns.

The foreclosed properties, which were written down
in 1903, are now valued at £13,808, being £1497 less than
12 months ago ; properties realised during the year show
£407 profit on the written down values. On the average
value held during the year the net rent (after paying
; rates and repairs) shows £4 7s. 6d. per cent. These pro-
perties, £3838 of loans (£3401 last year) and £1450 on
deposit, are all the co.’s resources. On the other side, it
owes only £l3 to the public ; in 1898 the liability was
£15,466, so that the clearing-up has been very satisfac-
tory. Having now practically a clean sheet (except for
the lost capital) this society goes out of business, the
Second Queen Building Society taking over all its assets
and liabilities.

The year has shown a profit of £1320 ; but then nothing
has been written off for wear and tear of plant, &c.,
which stands in the accounts at over £37,000. If only 2
p.c. is charged (and for machinery that is not enough) the
net profits would be reduced to £5BO for the year,
or at the gorgeous rate of £1 18s. Bd. per cent,
on capital. It is quite clear that things cannot
go on at this rate. In 1902-3 the year’s gross profit was
£2214; next year, £2155; in the past year, £1320.
Already the net return on capital has got down to less
than half the interest payable on Government stock.
And yet the directors report that “ the machinery has
been fully employed during the year.” It is not that
Australian mills can’t get the work to do ; the trouble is
that they are compelled by law to pay reasonable wages,
whereas the foreign factories with which they must com-
pete are under no such obligation. To the Labor party
it should be obvious, from this and other co.s’ disappear-
ing profits (they have completely disappeared in many
cases), that it must abandon either its Wages Boards and
Arbitration Courts and high-wage ideals or else
its fiscal - sinking and low-tariff sympathies. The
present tariff is clearly not high enough to
permit this co. (and others are in a worse plight)
to go on under existing wage-conditions; and
the party will have to make up its mind which it will
have—(l) lower wages, (2) closed factories and no wages,
or (3) high tariff. Not only has the co. earned the
miserable rate of interest previously mentioned, but its
overdrafts and other public liabilities have increased
from £7450 to £8247; and the steady movement the
wrong way must, of course, only hasten the acute
trouble with the banker which is already afflicting at
least two co.-owned Australian woollen mills. And when
the banker steps in in that spirit, the workman generally
steps out —it becomes mostly a matter of realisation
then.

The profits shown a few years ago were, to some extent,
fictitious, the assets of some subsidiary co.’s having been
absurdly over-valued ; hence the writing down 12 months
ago. But the business is still remarkably profitable ; and
through the prudent policy of cutting down the dividend
the reserves are increasing rapidly. Shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserves, taken together) show for last half-
year earnings at the rate of £l4 Bs. per cent, per annum.
In the past 12 months business appears to have expanded
rapidly. In July, 1904, the co. had £23,790 in cash or on
deposit; £20,000 of this has since been put into stock or
is represented by outstanding accounts, and the co. also
owes £39,444 as against £27,639, also represented by
stock, &c. It is an erratic and to some extent risky busi-
ness ; and these movements probably mean big profits or
big losses—the season will settle which. The co. owns
the whole of the stock in the M'Culloch Carrying Co.,
Limited (£12,500). That co. lately declared a 6s. dividend ;
but this does not affect Wright, Heaton, and Co., which
takes credit for the profits half-yearly as they are made.
It is a curious arrangement.

“ Agency and commission,” which brought in gross
£3915 in 1904, in the past year realised £6437 ; the jump,
the directors frankly say, js “ due to circumstances which
cannot be expected readily to recur.” But the co. is
in a comfortable position, anyway. It has deposits,
mortgages, and other investments of £17,914 ; and,
on the average held during the year, the interest
earnings show just 5 per cent.—sufficient of itself
to pay the very tidy dividend of 8 per cent, on capital.
What is the gross amount of trust estates in hand is not
disclosed ; apparently, however, the co. goes considerably
outside ordinary trustee business, and derives much profit
from other sources. But for that, the extreme irregu-
larity of the profits would suggest that the co. takes
credit for the full corpus commission on trust estates as
they come in, and leaves all future expenses to be borne
by the running commission, which is often inadequate for
the purpose. The co. gives very little information, and
what its practices are can’t be stated definitely ; but the
matter is worth inquiring into. This disposal of the
corpus commission is the one thing that throws suspicion
on many trustee co.s’ published accounts.

The Mutual Store has been undergoing re-organisation ;
competition had been giving the co. a wilted look. It is
stated that there has since been much improvement; but
“accumulations of old stocks have been disposed of at
greatly reduced prices, materially affecting the years
profits.” The accounts, however, don’t show this pro-
ceeding, which would be tantamount to a writing-off of
reserves. The incident shows, nevertheless, that the cold
eye of suspicion must be turned upon reserves that con-
sist largely of stocks of retailers’ merchandise. Some
other figures to show how things are shaping :

W.th debt and working expenses moving down and gross
trading: profit moving up a trifle, the outlook is certainly
a shade less gloomy. The least satisfactory feature is that
the co. grabs still another dividend that hasn’t been fully
earned ; and that calls for particularly severe remark in
view of the miserable size of the reserves compared with
the liabilities to the public. Those liabilities won’t shrink
along with the assets which stand against them ; there-
fore a co. that owes £1 for every £1 of its capital, which
is about this co.’s position, ought, as a general thing, to
put twice as much to reserve as a co. that owes nothing.
Yet this co. goes on term after term setting aside nothing
at all.

An excellent feature of this new society (it is now three
years old, and began from very small things) is that,
unlike most co-operative societies, it isn’t afraid to build
up a reserve. An annual and fixed 5 per cent, of the
gross profits goes to the fund. Apparently also all
bonuses uncalled for go the same way. The accounts are
not as clear as they might be on this point; £35 has dropped
into the reserves in the past half-year without explana-
tion, and, though included in the foregoing as profit,
may be the amount of these uncalled-for bonuses. An
annual 5 per cent, is written off stock, buildings, &c., and
10 per cent, off plant; considering where it is that the
society hangs out its sign, this is certainly not
any more than enough. The accounts lump share capital
and loans ; likewise the interest thereon. This might be
improved upon. The society has liquid assets (exclusive
of stock) amounting to £1903 (including £1416 outstand-
ing accounts, which, in a co-operative retail business, is
excessive); liabilities total £3458, £1250 of which is
balance due on premises. The business has increased
very rapidly ; the turn-over already amounts to £25,000 a
year.

Another of those little co.’s which are teaching the
farmers that the papers and politicians who have been
telling them about the blessings of individualism and the
beauties of self-reliance have all the while been bailing
up the wrong cow. This little co. (which, by the way,
sends out a very clear balance-sheet) is, like most of them,
working on a very small capital; but there is one thing in
its favor —its “ sundry debtors ” item is very small, so its
risk of being struck heavily by bad debts is not great.
Present turnover amounts to over £50,000 a year.

Australia is making the usual fool of itself over
its zinc ores, and is feeding the foreigner instead of itself.
Average price of American zinc ore (60 per cent, zinc) for
past six months has been £8 17s. 6d. ; high price was
partly due to the Joplin mines being flooded. Spelter in
America sells at about the same price as in London, so,
assuming £25 per ton as the average value, 60 per cent,
zinc ore would be intrinsically worth £l5. Deducting
£8 17s. 6d. paid to the mine co.’s, £6 2s. 6d. is left to
cover smelting and other expenses, losses of metal, and
to provide profit. Broken Hill 40 per cent, zinc concen-
trates, with spelter at £25, are intrinsically worth £10;
and as the co.’s only get about £2 per ton, the returning
charges must come to £B, with the value of any silver
and lead recovered thrown in. As a ton of zinc concen-
trates contains between £2 and £3 worth of silver and
lead, the foreign buyers have thus a good thing on. The
American mining co. gets about half the intrinsic value
of the ore, while the Australian co.’s get only one-sixth,
or at the most one-fifth. The difference is accounted for
mainly because Australian ore is carried half round the
globe to foreign smelters. There is competition for
American zinc ore ; there is probably none at all to
influence Australian prices, because the buyers represent
a foreign spelter trust. The carrying of over three tons
of zinc ore to be smelted down into one ton of spelter is
preposterous in view of the local coal resources. Australia
has all the natural elements in favor of local spelter
works, but that may count for nothing if the trade has,
unaided, to face foreign bounties and subsidies.

Baillieu’s people, who are putting £50,000 in the
Broken Hill South Blocks in return for half the mine, turn
out to be the Lake View Consols Co. This is only the third
time this S’African sort of finance has been introduced to
the Barrier ; previous occasions were when the Camden
Syndicate got a block of Junction shares, and the recent
transfer of a big block of Block 14 shares, but the latter
went into private hands. Bewick, Moreing were respon-
sible for the South Blocks deal. Both Hertzig and Hoover
spent much time on the mine during August. South
Blocks formed part of the B.H. South ; latter co. floated
it off in 200,000 shares —100,000 promoters’ and 100,000
contribs. Five years have been spent exploring to
440 ft., where there is a 21ft. lode. Most development has
been at 300 ft. ; lode there runs about 24ft. Everywhere
it is rich in lead but very poor in silver ; and under two
years ago, manager Wainwright, of the South—one of the
most successful managers on the line—did not see his
way to recommend erection of expensive plant; he
couldn’t see enough profit to compensate for the risk.
Profits will be small; but price paid is low. L.V. Consols
not only gets half of the mine for £50,000, but the £50,000
goes into the property, £35,000 of it in plant. Arrange-
ment is to form a new co. in 200,000 shares ; old share-
holders take 100,000 of these, of which contributors only
get 25,000. It was expected that they would kick
against that proposed division, but they have taken it
like lambs.

Registered in London lately “ The Broken Hill
Syndicate ” ; capital, £5250. With all t lis money it pro-
poses “to acquire freehold and other lands, farms,
mines, mineral, and other properties, grants, concessions,
leases, claims, licenses, options, mills, stamps, smelting,
and other works, &c., in Australia, or elsewhere, and to
carry on the business of diamond, gold, silver, copper,
iron and general miners, quarrymen, smelters, founders,
diamond merchants, metallurgists, financiers, crnstruc-
tors and owners of roads, tramways, and other works

Veteran manager John Howell—a very much
aged veteran —returned to Australia in time to hear that
the London syndicate had exercised its options over the
Conrad mines, Howell (N.S.W.). The syndicate took
over the King Conrad a couple of months back ; it gets a
controlling interest now in the Consolidated, and the two
will be worked together. The syndicate began its explo-
rations last October, putting up £lO,OOO, to be spent on
the Consolidated. The ore developed at 400 ft., 140 ft.
below the co.’s deepest workings, settled the matter.

lie N.S.W. Mines Department’s report in 1890
that a few tons of ore were sent from Coppabella as long
ago as that, a correspondent writes :—“ This ore came from
Mt. Gifford. A hunter named Parsons found galena on
Mt. Gifford, and taking some with him he called at
Musgrove’s house and showed him the ore and where he
got it. Musgrove, in turn, showed it to a man named
Bowman. Bowman took a five-ton trial out, and that
was the last that was ever heard of it.” Mt. Gifford (now
known as Irvine’s) is about five miles from the Coppabella
Proprietary.

G. H. Blakemore, the Cobar Syndicate’s
manager, who had a good deal to do with the decision
to put the old O.S.A. (Cobar, N.S.W.) to another trial,
gives his opinion of the unexpected lead development.
The old shaft, 332 ft. deep, was continued to 457 ft. ;
leaving sft. for a well, they opened out and rushed in
a crosscut “ 24ft. long, practically all in high-grade
carbonate of lead. First 4ft. is worth about 15 per cent.,
next 9ft. about 30 per cent., and a bulk sample from the
last lift, assayed 52J per cent, lead, ldwt. gold, and
lldwt. silver.” This last stuff should be worth £7 12s.
per ton, gross. Blakemore thinks they should get a big
body of stuff ; but nothing definite can be said as to that
yet. In any case, however, the find could not be worked
from the present shaft. The £5O syndicate shares have
touched £3OO ; there are only 44 of them.

Everybody who sees the 0.K., Chillagoe dis-
trict (N.Q.), is satisfied with it as a surface prospect;
practically nobody is satisfied with the development work
done. Some blame the conditions on which Thos. Gibb
was engaged as manager ; he gets £lOOO a year and 2 per
cent, of profits. Whether it really affects the policy or
not in this case, payment by results in this way is
generally bad ; it is an incentive to a manager to rush out


The Bankers’ Magazine (London) September,
1904, writes re the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance
Society Limited: —“ At the close of 1875 its funds
amounted to £2,864, and twenty-eight years thereafter on
December 31,1903, we find them increased a hundred-fold

average, has seen £lOO,OOO added to the funds.”*

Experiments were recently conducted at the
Ivanhoe Mine, W.A., by the metallurgist Mr. Brett, with
the Wilfley Slime Table on the fine sands. The results
achieved were astonishing. The amount of concentrates
saved (vide, p. 298, “Monthly Journal of the Chamber
of Mines,” W.A., July 31, 1905) has, by means of the extra
Slime Table, been increased by 45 per cent., whilst the
total gold values have increased 60 per cent. Of this
Concentrate saved by the Slime Table, 92 per cent, is
pure Concentrate Slime. The results of the experiments
have been so satisfactory that the management have
ordered 11 more with the intentions of installing them
forthwith. It is then proposed to increase the number to
25. The Austral Otis Engineering Co., South Melbourne,
are the sole manufacturers for Australasia.*

The big S. Australian Farmers’ Co-operative
Union, Ltd., which has an annual turnover of nearly half-
a-million, has just owned up to another bad year, again
through disastrous deals in wheat. The society made a
profit of £1174 in other directions, but lost £6640 on
wheat, thus going another £5466 to the bad. There is
serious talk of winding the business up ; but the farmers
who are afraid of a wheat ring will ni-nbahUr r. a
ore and let dead work slide. Anyway, as long as it lasts
at the O.K. there isn’t another manager in Queensland on
quite so good a wicket; the arrangement yields Gibb close
on to £3OOO a year. In other respects the management of
the co. is extremely economical. It has been proposed
lately to shift the office from Cairns to Brisbane. Result
would inevitably be to increase management expenses;
and there would be little or no advantage except to the
share-jobber. Mine’s output continues remarkable for
such a youngster; last three weeks’ profit was £12,500.

Adelaide has been having a huge gamble in
Smith’s Creek (N.Q.) tin ; 40,000 shares were handled in a
week. Capt. Warren, who pricked the bladder once, has
been up again, reporting more hopefully (as he did, by
the way, of the B.H. Junction recently); but the mine
needs £lO,OOO spent on it, he says. Co. can’t now
have 10,000 shillings available ; and the people who put
in more money will want the big end of the mine—if there
is a mine or a big end. The people behind Smith’s Creek
ought to be left to have their own gamble ; pretty safe to
say that the outsider will fall in nine times out of ten.
As to Capt. Warren’s hopes, note that they are largely
based on better values in the end of the 300 ft. drive south.
A crosscourse is about due there, judging by what
happened at upper levels ; and tin values mostly improve
near a slide or crosscourse.

Queen Cross, Charters Towers, has struck
another heap of trouble, its fine mill and plant having
been wrecked by explosion. Affair is another Charters
Towers mystery. At the beginning of last year shares
were £3 ss. ; last week, about Bs. The collapse was
so sudden and complete that it probably turned a head or
two. That is the only explanation visible. Once before
the Towers had a similar disaster; and bad feeling was
supposed to be at the bottom of that also. In that case
the idea was that one firm was controlling the
mine, and that the firm had enemies ; in the present
case, though nothing of that sort has happened,
directors have been justly blamed for neglecting
development work, and thus precipitating a crisis. Divs.
in 1903 were £215,000, and £220,000 in 1904 ; but while the
directors rooted that out, pretty well all they did in the
way of prospecting was a bit of diamond-drilling; and
the drill has been a ghastly failure on the Towers.
Result was that when they could not pick up the expected
Victory stone, returns collapsed. But the principal
sufferers were English and not Australians ; former used
to hold the stock heavily, then sold out for a song, and
afterwards bought back at boom prices. Nevertheless,
to show that some ex-North Queenslanders considered
the stock worth holding, even at the big prices it
went to, W. D. Casey, of Sydney, the biggest holder, held
on to his bundle, and is holding on still. Present value of
stone known to exist in the mine is about 4s. or 4s. 6d.
per share.

Brilliant St. George, Charters Towers (N.Q.),
must soon put its shutters up, as far as regular dividends
are concerned. In 13 years the co. has got through

has paid £755,400 in dividends. Half-year just finished
saw 12,876 tons crushed for £27,776 ; cyanide bullion and
concentrates brought the value to £3 17s. per' ton.
Term before last stone averaged £4 4s. Bd. for 13,315
tons, and £36,000 was paid in dividends ; last term
only £IB,QOO. Expenditure was £29,555 ; receipts,
£49,693. After paying £lB,OOO in divs., and £9OO
in div. tax, there was a surplus of £1238, which
was placed to reserve, and built it up to
£19,521. As soon as the underhand stope is finished, and
it won’t be long, a start will be made in earnest upon the
pillars. These will assist the mine to keep up appear-
ances for some time, as there is a considerable tonnage,
from No. 16 right through to No. 4. Of course there are
possibilities in the shallow ground, and a cross-reef un-
worthy of notice in the good days is now being tested. The
Victory has put a winze down some 130 ft. on the George
boundary. Reef showing may averagea footof 12dwt. stone.
Prospecting is being carried on from the George shaft, but
there are some doubts as to the level being on the right
thing. Co. has a treatment plant of its own two miles
away from the mine. As there is no likelihood of sufficient
stone from outside sources being forthcoming to keep
the mill going, the directors are thinking about securing
and developing some new property with the £19,521
in hand, less 6d. dividend declared for October. As
something over £5 per 10s. share has been paid in divi-
dends, holders would do well to practise self-denial for a
term, because £20,000 is hardly sufficient capital to open
up a new property with. Costs in the well-run George
have amounted to £2 ss. lid. per ton.

Encouraging reports are made of the Oaks,
Mount Hutton, 25 miles from Rockhampton (Q.). Pros-
pectors got first gold last February, and traced the prob-
able source to the crest of a hill, where they found a
formation. Good specimens were got in trial shafts.
Capital of the co. which was then formed is
£24,000 in 10s. shares; half fully paid, the balance
to ss. Already £llOO in dividends have been paid.
Co. has not been able to exactly fix the thickness of the
workable material ; there is a patchy rubble seam, apart
from the regular lode material. Lode consists of quartz
veins, with ironstone. There are traces of cobalt, man-
ganese, nickel, and other metals in it. Lode has been
proved to a vertical 130 ft. Reward claims are 1500 ft. by
400 ft. ; and 16 tons crushed from the eastern ground,
1100 ft. from the main shaft, gave 260 z. A Huntington
mill is being put up ; plant will then treat 500 tons per
month.

Difficult to get the real strength of the Ohillagoe
position under altered system of management. Ex-
general manager Greenway in his own sanguine way was
satisfied before he left that the metallurgical operations
were going along nicely, and continuing so would pull the
co. out of the mud. (A lot of mud would, however, stick
to it.) In addition, he did not think the Etheridge railway
scheme of any account whatever ; in fact, was of opinion
it would cripple the co. Railway-superintendent Back had
different views on the railwav question, and also conflict-
ing views concerning the part the metallurgical opera-
tions should play in the whole Ohillagoe scheme, and
that’s how the publicly-reported friction happened. From
present North Queensland developments, and not over-
looking the possibilities of the Etheridge field, Ohillagoe
concern appears to more and more assert itself as a pro-
position for a railway man.
* * * *
Candlish, the Georgetown, Etheridge (N.Q.),
king is a typical Queensland goldfield boss. Over 20 years
on the field ; is a storekeeper ; finances and feeds the field
in bad times, and just about owns it in good times.
Queensland miners do not place much faith in technical
training, but the storekeepers do, and in the end they
become the boss delvers. Process of successful evolu-
tion in N.Q, is something like this Arrive ; keep a
store; keep up your pecker; keep the miners;
keep the mine. Then go South, where the mine, or what
you have got for it, keeps you. At present, Candlish,
who is a much esteemed man, owns the Havelock, Nil
Desperandum, the Queenslander, half each of the Better
Luck and the Dry Hash, besides a battery at Struggle
Creek. He evidently knows the Gulf country, for he
scorns the idea of rail communication with Normanton.
If a line is built, it must connect either with Almaden or
Mungana, or at all events must give communication with
an eastern port. There’s no possibility of a port in the
Gulf.

Economist Curie estimates Mt. Morgan (Q.) to
be worth £2,900,000, or £2 18s. per share. He figures it
out this way :
Five years’ profits on old mine .. £650,000
Net profits on gold-copper ore .. 2,100,000
Cash in hand 150,000
Total .. .. £2,900,000
This assumes copper at £55 per ton. When the new
copper development at 750 ft. was exhaustively reported
on, the manager, taking copper at £6O, estimated that
there was £2,489,000 profit in that section.
* * * *
W.A. State batteries during July treated 8600
tons for 94400 z. bullion, valued at £34,000. Total treated
to date, 272,850 tons for 319,2000 z., worth £1,184,200. The
batteries are worked at a loss of something like £lO,OOO a
year; but, indirectly, they are a great benefit to the
state, and keep a lot of men employed. Chief reason
they do not pay is that they are nearly all obsolete plants
—most of them so old that they are constantly breaking
down and under repair.
* * * *
At Tuckanarra, on the Murchison (W.A.), a
party of miners some time back abandoned a show, after
about 300 tons of stone. There was no battery
would not pay to cart the stone that distance, so went o 9
in search of something better. A State battery has since
been put up at Tuckanarra, and the other day a couple
of men pegged out the deserted claim and put the stone
through. It went 14dwt. to the ton and gave % clear
profit of over £5OO.
* * * i
Randalls (W.A.), of which great things were
once predicted, has turned out a very low-grade field.
The district is intersected by large strong lodes, but
values all round have been under lOdwt., and not payable
under existing conditions. One mine, the Surprise, has,
however, got a rich bunch ; 3 tons have returned 481 oz.
Owners have kept their own counsel, as, until the parcel
was treated, no one had any idea that such ore existed.
Average of other parcels treated during the month was
only Sjdwt.
* * * *
Southern Cross (W.A.), very little heard of for
years, is looking up again, and will shortly add consider-
ably to the gold yield. The Greenmount, Fraser’s South
Extended, Transvaal and Northern Blocks Syndicate will
all shortly be running 10-head mills, and among them
should easily treat 5000 tons monthly. Manager Hamilton,
of Boulder Prop., has a working option over a show at the
Cross, which is now being developed; so this long
neglected field may again make a noise in the world.
i* • * •
Princess Royal Central, Norseman (W.A.), is
still being energetically developed by manager Hender-
son, but with poor results. Hundreds of feet of driving
and crosscutting have been done at 950 ft, but no pay ore
has been located so far. This is the first deep level
mine tackled in W.A., and owners deserve better luck.
* * * *
Hidden Secret, Kalgoorlie, once so sensational,
is now a very humdrum show. The rich shoot has either
petered out entirely, or had a break, and the mine is now
an ordinary affair. While the shoot lasted it gave 483
tons, yielding 79860 z. of gold and 37,3220 z. silver, worth
£35,700, and it paid £32,400 in divs. Driving is still being
done at 200 ft., and the shaft is being sunk to 300 ft. No
show in the vicinity has struck pay ore, and the feverish
working of the north end of the Kalgoorlie field is over,
though prospecting is still going on.
* « * *
Great Ophir, Davyhurst (W.A.), is being
equipped with a 20-head mill from the defunct Lady Loch.
Mine is already adorned with a Krom roll and cyanide
plant, but no amalgamating tables, and consequently the
coarse gold is all lost. Co. was recently reconstructed in
300,000 shares of ss. each, of which shareholders in the old
co. were entitled to two for each old share held. Public
were offered 100,000 shares with a 2s. assessment; but,
although a month has elapsed, no information has been
given as to the result. A pretty good thing to leave
alone.
* * * *
Ivanhoe Junction, Kalgoorlie, has long joined
the silent list, as Manager Hawkins is no boomster. He
is now leaving property to take chartre of Tarcoola
Blocks, and a new man is to be appointed. Property
seems to be hopeless ; any ore found is merely in
bunches and of very low-grade, as the test crushings put
through at instigation of Tom Hewitson proved. All the
other co. ’s owning shows in the vicinity have given the job
best, and the Junction should follow suit.
* * * *
Chaffers, Kalgoorlie, is now being developed at
400, 600, 800, and 1000 ft. Manager Cape still reckons that
the ore, though low grade, is payable. He says that his
predecessors took out the ore too wide, and consequently
the test crushings from the dump were a failure. For
position (next the Horseshoe) the mine is unassailable;
but, unfortunately, the pay shoot petered out before
reaching it. The area is too small and too much cut up
by railways and roads ever to be much of a mine.
* * * *
Boulder Deep Levels (W.A.) look less hopeful
At 1100 ft. the lode is broken up in the west drive, and
is of no consequence. Going east it is rather better, but
certainly not good enough to pay. Marvellous assays
and samples again come from the mine, exactly as at the
time of the scandal; but, though mine is open to inspec-
tion, no such stone can be seen. Where does it come
from? Many shares were bought on the field on the
strength of these specimens, and the buyers are feeling
very sorry for themselves. Who sold ?
* * * *
Associated, Kalgoorlie, still has a lot of possi-
bilities. In the west crosscut at 1200 ft. a lode 18ft. wide
carrying streaks of telluride has been cut on the Perse-
verance boundary. This development is of great import-
ance to both mines, as the underlay is slightly to the
west. The Oroya shoot is opening out well at the three
points intersected, and is adding greatly to the value of
the reserves. Developments since Manager Roberts took
charge in May have entirely altered the outlook, and, once
the alterations to plant are completed, co. should be a
leading div. payer.
* * # •
Fingall Associated, Day Dawn, floated in Perth,
in January, 1904, is said to have been passed on to Bull.
The working of the mine by the Perth crowd was a
ghastly failure. After muddling along for some months
it closed down for want of funds. The vendors did not
even get the £5OO cash stipulated for, but only 125,000
fuily-paid shares, which were never negotiable. The
mine adjoins Fingall Consols on the North, but so far as
tested does not seem to have much of a future, though it
must be admitted it hasn’t had a fair run. If Bull puts
up enough working capital, and gives’ a reliable man
charge, something may be heard of it.
* * * «
The two recent discoveries of gold below 4000 ft.
in Bendigo have given mining there the greatest fillip it
has had for years. In New Chum Railway, at 4225 ft.
good prospects have been obtained, and the other day,
in the Victoria Quartz, gold was got at 4100 ft. It is
likely now that half-a-dozen other mines will
set to work to send their shafts down another
quarter of a mile or so. This new phase of
mining will necessitate almost a revolution in Bendigo
methods. Already the shafts —generally 10ft. by 4ft.—
have proved too small for work below 3000 ft. New Chum
Railway has a 10ft. by 4ft. shaft. For 800 ft. it is merely a
skeleton with the compartment not boarded up. Yet the
management complains of being cramped. There is no
doubt that the mines to go any distance below 4000 ft. will
require new shafts. This would be necessary, in most
cases, for ventilation purposes, anyway. Rock tempera-
tures at these levels go as high as 106 degrees, and the
ventilating capacity of alO x 4 shaft is too small. Most
of the shafts were sunk by rule of thumb in the
old days, and many of them are screwed, or
twisted, or bent, or something. Nothing but constant
survey can keep a shaft accurate for three-quar-
ters of a mile, and it is only within the last few
years that Bendigo has seriously considered the surveyor
as a factor in mining. The cost of the new mining is, of
course, high. Where 4dwt. and sdwt. paid dividends at
1500 ft. or 2000 ft., it takes pretty well Joz. to pay expenses
below 3500 ft. Nothing under Joz. is good at 4000 ft. or
below it. So the stone in the deep levels has to
be better than that in medium and shallow levels.
Every truck of deep-level dirt has to be hauled
three-quarters of a mile. That takes to 3 minutes.
When men are being hauled it takes 7 to 8 minutes.
The plant has to be powerful, and the wear and tear
on it increases out of all proportion to distance
sunk.. The rope alone of a 4000 ft. shaft weighs two tons ;
allow another three tons for cages and trucks, and it
must have a breaking-strain of 50 tons. Then men at
4000 ft., in a hot, enervating atmosphere, cannot do any-
thing like the work of men at 2000 ft. It takes three men
to do two men’s work. Another innovation for Bendigo—
one that must come, and should have come years ago—is
the introduction of two-decker cages, so that two trucks
can be hauled instead of one. At present, the deep mines
wind one half-ton of dirt at a time three-quarters of a
mile. It is a long time since Ballarat saw the extrava-
gance of that system, and adopted two-deckers. Still, as
far as writer knows, there is not a two-decker cage in
Bendigo. An efficient spray to lay the smoke and dust
after firing is another thing badly needed to save time
and, consequently, money. With improvements such as
these there is no reason why mining should not be con-
ducted successfully at far below 4000 ft., provided good
enough stone can be got.
* * * *
There are already upwards of 20 barges and
dredges working in the rivers and creeks of north-east
Victoria, and for the moment all the public co.’s are
making a profit. Private concerns are owned by Mrs.
J. A. Wallace and Fletcher Bros.; and, as they are putting
up more plants, there must be a bit in it. The Fletchers
are building a new pontoon on the Yackandandah Creek.
The warden is kept busy hearing applications for for-
feiture of unworked leases, applicants being usually suc-
cessful. A Maorilander is securing much ground,
presumably for a Maoriland syndicate ; the other day he
secured the forfeiture of a lease at Osborne’s Elat, and
Lockardt’s Creek. Up at Bright there will be 10 more
plants at work shortly, and from there eastward, for
nearly 40 miles, ground is pegged out in spots.
* * * *
Glenfine South, Pitfield (Vie.), has gone back to
first intentions. Originally an alluvial show, it blazed
out as a quartz mine, paid a fair swag of divs.,
collapsed, and now is re-appearing as an alluvial
mine. It might be left alone to work out
its destiny if the good of the public did not
demand one or two things. First, it needs to be
pointed out that none of the adjoining mines could be
classed as rich, and the extent of wash in them was
limited. In the Glenfine South old alluvial, the
average of the dirt was low, and the mine could
never have paid divs. if it had not been for the quartz.
The present deep run has to be proved as to extent and
richness. The co. has certainly got on a rich run of wash,
but the rich dirt is only in one working. The Ballarat
crowd is making the most of this rich patch, as is its wont.
Dirt from said crosscut will go over 2oz. to the fathom,
but there are plenty of signs that the rich run is petering
out as drives advance. In any case, to pay 10s. for shares
at present is a gamble, which the history of the field fails
to justify.
• • * *
If Victorian coal co.’s are feeling the pinch of
hard times, they have no one save themselves to blame.
It is not that the coal is bad —as a matter of fact, it is
good—but the seams are narrow, the faulting is tremen-
dous, and the railway carriage is a handicap which even
a State grant cannot compensate for. Outtrim-Howitt
Eassed on a lot of scrip to Bull, so he nurses that baby;
ut other shows had not the same wisdom. Jum-
bunna balance sheet just out shows that, although
output went up from 22,000 to 27,000 tons for the
half-year the co. increased its debit balance rather badly.
Mine wages amounted to £14,000 for the six months, and
the value of the coal sold was over £17,000; so that the
margin left was small. The whole position seems to
resolve into this : Gippsland co.’s cannot, on account of
natural conditions, pay divs. without concessions from
the Railway Dept., so long as there is hard competition
from Newcastle. But it would pay the State of Victoria
to work the mines for the railways and to sell the surplus
to the public. Seddon hadn’t half the same chance with
his coal mines, but he took the risk. Isn’t Labor leader
Prendergast able to show Bent the way for a live deal?
* * • *
Alluvial mining in Victoria, outside the dredging
shows, presents a long vista of fading possibilities. To
start with, the J. Bull mines at Moolort and Charlotte
Plains are not interesting the universe, save in the
estimates of the richness of the wash at the Victorian
Deep Leads. At the other end of the Berry system
there isn’t a mine, outside Madame Berry West, on
the dividend list—calls look perilously near in the
Extended. Cathcart Prop., at Ararat, is languish-
ing ; the Avoca shows aren’t a-going; at Pitfield,
Glenfine South is giving a flash in the pan; at
Rutherglen, Great Southern isn’t doing a great deal
more than holding its own; and ditto at Chiltern
with the Chiltern Valley Mines. Then at Maryborough,
Duke United can’t strike the lead; Burnt Creek
is too poor for divs.; Duke and Main Leads
Consols have to beat the water ; Chalk’s No. 3 wants gold ;
and there is a big fly in the Main Lead North, which per-
haps will be disclosed now that dividends look like being
endangered. It is very sad to write, but from north
to south Victorian deep-lead mining has never been less
prosperous than to-day.
* * * *
It is hard to apply the ordinary rules of
analysis to the flattening out of the Briseis Extended
(Tas.) shares, because to do so would mean the un-
ravelling of a lot of market intricacies, which,
perhaps, will never be disentangled. The first error
was simple. An estimate was made of a yield.
This was an error. The evidence seems to
show that what was thought to be a fair allowance was
made for iron and sand. It is not unusual to make such
estimates. Still it was an error to have refrained from
saying that the clean-up was an estimate. The next error
was in not making Northey’s letter respecting the yield
public the minute it was to hand. Thus two main errors—
first the estimation, secpnd the failure to publish. And it
can be said without the least degree of harshness
that it is the latter phase that shareholders are likely to
question about most closely. That the market had an
idea that the return was not likely to come up to the
figures reported is shown both by the persistent selling
and by emphatic assertions on the point days before the
exact yield canie out. What everyone wants to find out
is who sold and why. The mystery may never be solved,
but the fact remains that those who talked spoke accu-
rately, and those who sold made profits.
* * * *
Some day it will have to be made a misde-
meanor for a tin co. to report results in the form of
“black tin” or “tin oxide.” Briseis Extended (Tas.)
reported 15 tons 14cwt. “black tin”; over four tons of
this turned out to be black iron sand. It was then
estimated that 11 tons 6cwt. of stuff going 70 per cent,
tin could be obtained ; but about the only solid fact in
the recent report is that 10 tons were sent to the
smelter. The “ black tin ” method of reporting results
is one of the things that the people who are rushing into
tin specs, will curse by-and-bye.

Re rapid shaft sinking (“ Redcap,” B. 14/9/’O5),
W. Uren writes “ Years ago I was one of 24 who con-
tracted to sink a shaft, 12ft. x 4ft., within 3in. timber,
with a 12in. frame every 50ft. Our contract started 100 ft.
from surface : ground called for two kegs of powder per
week. In nine weeks we sank 234 ft. 6in.. Work was
plumb and true. Shaft was on Learmonth’s claim at
Egerton, now, I think, held by the Black Horse Co. I
have had over 50 years’ experience, and have not known
this record to be beaten.”

“E. Hill” claims the Australian record for
quick shaft sinking for Charters Towers “ Queen Cen-
tral Block sunk one month 145 ft. and timbered'32ft.; size
15 x 4 in the clear ; four chambers ; rock drilling machines,
Ingersoll’s ; dynamite, gelignite. Last fortnight’s sinking,
75ft., which we claim a record for Australia.” Another
correspondent submits this as the S’African record
“ Jupiter shaft, Simmer Deeps, was sunk by Mr. Howard,
an American manager, 127 ft. 6in. in one month; shaft
was 28 xB, and in blue rock.”

The result of another liquidation was reported
to Melbourne Practice Court last week. After having
had its doors open for deposits and any other trifles that
might come its way for about 3J years, the British Bank
of Australia shut up in 1901, and ever since then it has
been in liquidation. It had thus been in liquidation just
four times longer than it was in business. The awful
thing was more or less an offshoot of the Anglo-Australian
Bank; and besides borrowing close upon £lOO,OOO from the
British Bank of Australia, the Anglo-Australian held a
heap of the former’s shares. In other words, the Anglo-Au-
stralian practically ran two businesses, and reached out
after two lots of deposits, and to a great extent used both
lots of deposits to prop up the one lot of rotten securities.
Then, when the bottom dropped out of the boom and the
Anglo Australian smashed, the liquidators put in a claim
against the busted A.-A. Bank for £515,365 for calls, and
guarantees, and other things, and told the depositors and
other creditors that they didn’t think the whole lot was
worth the paper it was written on. The liquidators were
right; the net result of the liquidation is that £933 is
available for debenture-holders and unsecured creditors,
and the latter can now get Jd. in the £. And after they
have borrowed a decent enough coat to go and collect
their ha’penny in, they will probably meet some old-time
land-boomer in a silk hat in Collins-street, and he will tell
them that Labor legislation is ruining this country and
that the foreigner won’t send money here for investment
on account of the Socialists and the six hatters.

A prospectus witli the eye-filling title of “The
Co-operative Credit Bank of Victoria, Ltd.,” was issued in
Melbourne a few days ago. It turned- out to be just an
ingenious little scheme for running a sort of Mont de
Pi6t6 in connection with the Civil Service Stores. The
the Co-operative Credit Bank, pledges his salary or his
watch, and gets, not cash, but so much credit at the
stores. The scheme, which is to be run, more
or less, in conjunction with the Civil Service
Co-operative Stores, is a pretty severe reflection
upon either the pay or the providence of the Vic.
public servant. And it has a name that will still re-
call unpleasant memories to some grizzled Presbyterians.
There was a Co-operative Credit Bank in Glasgow in the
’7o’s. It gave 18 per cent, per annum for deposits, and it
was mostly, if not wholly, a certain Richard Banner
Oakley. The 18 per cent, interest was paid regularly for
a while, then two detectives stopped the bank as it was
getting into a train one night, and found all the
assets in its carpet-bag. Exactly how many months
or years the bank got, this writer dis-remembers, but it
delivered an eloquent address from the dock upon the
co-operative credit principle.

“Weary Bull”: When “J. Pannikin” told
you that the most pitiful sight in White Cliffs opal field
was the crowd of women and children “ specking ”
from a lucky gouger’s claim, he didn’t say what forced
these people to do that sort of thing. Poor opal at
present is absolutely unsaleable, the market being con-
trolled by German buyers, who constitute a ring. There
is nothing to prevent them giving £5 for opal honestly
worth £lO an oz., and the higher grades accordingly.
What can the poor miner do ? Take it or starve 1 For
every gouger on opal 75 are on absolutely nothing ; most
of the other 24 who go to make up the 100 are on potch
and colors. As a rule, when a digger is lucky enough to
get on to a patch, he is not very particular if he loses a
few stones ; and those that go specking on his dump are
trying to get a stone or two with which to buy a tin of
treacle or jam to break the monotony of bread. I know
of a family, 11 all told ; the man has sunk 15 holes, all
over 30 feet, and seen nothing. The buyers are the only
people who do well; most of them don’t have to stay at
the game long. They work in with the Continental
crowd, who seem to control the market. It says very
little for the enterprise of the English-speaking race that
this should be so ; but that it is so everybody interested
in opal-mining knows. Yet, though it controls the
market, Germany produces practically no opal itself;
White Cliffs furnishes about two-thirds of the world’s
output, and still has not the ghost of a say in fixing
values.

Parts of Argentina appear to be booming just
now with a wild land drunk at inflated values. Phil
Hardcastle, an old Christchurch (M.L.) boy, who holds a
big position at Bahia Blanca, says there is a feverish rush
to buy and unload properties. One property for which he
paid £2OOO he sold for £5OOO, and in a fortnight it was
priced at £12,000. Another property was sold for £llOO
and resold next day for £4OOO. “ But the crack will come
sooner or later. A couple of bad harvests will alter the
whole aspect of things.”

is : Have a little wadding worked up to a point, and
some sticky substance—bicycle solution, for instance, but
the juice of a thistle is best. Wait till the bee is drink-
ing, then stick the pointed end of the wadding on to its
back, taking care that the wings are not touched. The
bee rises and makes a line for home. If your wadding is
the right weight, you can sight the bee all the way to the
tree ; if it is too light, it will out-distance you ; if it is too
heavy, it can’t fly at all. Experience only will teach you
the right weight, as bees in some districts carry weight
much better than others. One peculiar thing about the
bee’s flight is that it always rises suddenly straight up
just before reaching the tree, and then descends. As
soon as you see the bee rise you know it has reached
home, even though you don’t see it descend. The other
bees always kill the weight-carrier. Why, I don’t know.
Possibly the wadding is such a disguise that they don’t
recognise their fellow bee.
CRUSHING.
TRAMPEDIAN : “Madam, in giving me food you
help an actor who has been on the principal
stages of tie world.”
MADAM : “Be the look of yer I think there's one
stage yer missed.”
TRAMPEDIAN : “ Name it, madam.”
MADAM : “ The bathing stage.”
“ Val ” : It is curious how anything ap-
parently uncanny affects the stomach of a nigger.
Was travelling along the Murray with a friend,
when we fell in with a few natives. One was
very persistent with his “Baeea, boss.” My
friend, who is blessed with a perfect sat of false
teeth, turned sharply on him, at the same time
opening his mouth wide and allowing the top row
of teeth to fall on the lower one. The fearson.e
sight was too much for Binghi, who turned pea-
green, and distributed what breakfast he had had
that morning on the parchedroad. Immediately
after he turned and fled.
“W.L.D.”: In answer to “R.J.E.’s”
request (B. 21/9/’O5) for personal information of
the pleasures of snakebite, here are two vivid
recollections. While camping up Middle Harbor
(Sydney) some years ago, I carelessly grabbed a
30-inch tiger snake in mistake for a harmless
young diamond. Having evidently just cast its
skin Hoplocephalus Curtus, junior, was a bit
sick and not in first-class working order. It
showed a marked reversal of form by biting first
and puffing after. Had the angry expansion of
the neck preceded the bite, I might have dis-
covered my mistake in time and cast the reptile
away, but as it was, it drove its fangs in
thrice between my left forefinger and thumb.
Then I knew. Whipping string tightly
round the wrist, my companion wanted to
cut out the bite, but the shakiness of
his excitement made me snatch his knife
and jab it into the wound myself to make it bleed
freely, while he rushed to the nearest habitation
for assistance. As I walked bade to meet assist-
ance the parts around the bite began to blacken
and swell, and a numb feeling overspread the
hand until it reached an intense degree of pain.
The wrist began to puff, and a tingling ran up the
arm, followed by a sharp, pricking pain behind
the eyeballs. Then the forehead gradually
tightened across, until the temples throbbed as
though they would burst; vision became blurred,
and I stumbled along, unable to distinguish
obstacles in the track. A stifling feeling crept
round the heart, which pulsated with a series of
convulsive throbs, followed by mere flutters, till I
lost all consciousness. This proved to be about 15
minutes after the poisoning. The first-aid party
my mate had rounded up saw me fall down, and
rushed me with a profusion of their snake-bite
remedy—rum in lemonade bottles. What with
rum, exercise, and the fact that the venom did not
come from a full-grown factory, I pulled through ;
but for a fortnight my arm remained painfully
swollen, the skin itself cracking with tension, and
the flesh discoloring as with one big bruise. An
ugly black blister formed at the elbow, burst, and
all was well. On the second occasion, a short,
thick, reddish snake—variety not discovered, but
not a deadly one—fastened on my right forefinger
when I was gathering wild flowers, and made things
extremely uncomfortable. The resultant symp-
toms were the same as before, only very much
modified, except as to the persistent swelling of
the arm. This was more pronounced, and for
three weeks the individuality of the fingers was
almost completely lost, but the discoloration was
not so great as before. As instancing the exist-
ence of a peculiar belief, some people invariably
inquire when snake-time comes round each summer
if I do not feel a recrudescence of the pain.
“Alec Zander” : The pure-bred dingo
not only doesn’t bark, he also bites differently
from the domestic dog. To this fact a friend of
mine was indebted for retaining a portion of his
beauty. Riding through the sandhills on Inna-
inincka station (S.A.), we came across a dingo
hole with fresh tracks. My friend, on the spur
of the moment, stooped to look in ; as he did so a
dingo bitch looked out and bit him clean through
the two cheeks, but it being a snapping bite the
holes were clean punctures and soon healed. A
tame dog would have removed most of the face.
He had the satisfaction of killing four pups,
and doesn’t look into holes any more, barring the
hole at the top of a tumbler.

“ The Lyre ” : At a hare drive recently on
Currandooley Station (N.S.W.;, several Gussies
and as many Reginalds who had come from the city
to shoot were persuaded tojoin the “drivers.” This
was after the host had seen them handle their guns,
by which handling he had lost several valuable
sheep, some temper, and a boundary rider. They
were accommodated with quiet mokes, and
managed to hang on most of the time ; though
the horses seemed to think they had struck some
sort of a lunatic asylum. On a halt being called
for refreshments, the horses Were tied up to a
fence, and when the signal for re mounting was
given, the asylum made a wild rush to see which
of it could mount first. The nags, of course,
showed their horse-sense by snapping their bridles
and going off in a land-agenty way. Once again
they were ranged along tbe fence, when the long-
suffering host said, “Now, you fellows mustn’t
rush your horses. Go up to them quietly and
speak to them in an off-hand way—as you would
salute a human being.” It broke him up con-
siderably when all along the line he heard —
“ Good day, old boy ! ”
“ How do, ole fellah ! ”
“ Naice weathah !”
“ Awfully faine day ! ”
And the most pronounced idiot of the contingent
lost his nag again through raising his cap at close
quarters, because, as he explained afterwards, it
was a lady horse.
• * * *
“ Borig ” : Re barkless dogs. The Chinese
edible dog, if he is a dog, does not bark, and one
I knew would only eat vegetables. A friend was
keeping him in the country for a Sydney gentle-
man. He (the dog) was the surliest, crankiest-
looking beast I ever saw, and had a blue-black
tongue like a goanna’s. The cattle dogs and tykes
around hated him with a deadly hatred.
* * * *
“Ed.”: State forests and river flats in
Victoria are leased for grazing purposes, and
bring in a few pence per acre per year. The
new trees as they come up are eaten off by
stock, and saplings never grow to any height
because the sheep and cattle nibble the young
shoots. Living on the edge of a State forest, I
have planted box and ironbark seedlings, but only
with good tree-guards do they make any headway.
By a careful thinning-out and cleaning up of these
forests, profitable work would be found for the
unemployed. Quick-growing pines should be
planted in South Gippsland in sandy country
where the rainfall is good (there is much of this
land between the two Gippsland railway lines).
These pines would provide soft woods in place of
those imported from the Baltic and elsewhere. By
the way, cork-oaks flourish in gardens round about
Melbourne, and if these were planted on a large
scale they would in a few years provide a supply
of Pork bark for stoppers and corlc-dust for fruit-
packing. Already in the Mallee and northern
plains there is a scarcity of timber ; these at one
time heavily-timbered districts will yet have to
devote land to tree plantations in order to provide
firewood and fencing timber.

“Jim Pan”: Curious tastes some of the
Far-Outers have. At Mulgabelah a mail-change
groom, who never buys or borrows meat, but eats
rabbits wholesale, had four fowls, which used to
worry old Mother Threeteeth, of the little roadside
pub. She complained and complained that the
fowls ate her fowls’ feed and ruined her seed-beds.
Friction arose. One day the lady caught the four
fowls and took them straight home to the groom’s
gunyah. He chopped their heads off and threw
their bodies on to the ash-heap. “ Aint ya goin’t’
eat um ? ” “ No, I can’t a-bear poultry,” said the
devourer of rabbits. The crows had a rather
choice feed. '
THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER.
“ Would you mind me standing in your garden
an hour or two occasionally? I would so
much like to sketch those lovely trees of yours.”
“Not at all, Miss. Only I teams yer, my old
woman’s terribly jealous.”
“Paul Cupid”: Re snake-bite (B. 21/9/’O5).
Having been in company with a person from the
time he was bitten till he recovered, I would
describe the symptoms as : (1) on being bitten, he
displayed an extraordinary activity and a great
command of language; (2) on seeing two teeth-
marks in his leg, a sudden pallor, a loss of interest
in mundane things, and a mumbling as if in
prayer ; (3) complained of no pain, only a slight
numbness at the bite, which was very slightly
swollen ; (4) a great desire to sleep; and (5), on
recovery the next day, the general appearance of
a man who had no recollection of how he got
home the night before.

Sydney D.T., in its “On the Land
weariness, tells how to scald pigs. Inter alia: —
Do not put the hog in the water until life is extinct, or
the skin will be reddened by the cooking of the blood in
the capillaries beneath.
Nothing about the feelings of the hog! But
don’t add torture to death, or you will spoil the
look of the bacon.

The annual Sydney stud rabbit sales loom
near. Already it has been seriously suggested to
N.S.W. Government that, instead of trying to ex-
terminate the rabbit, its breed should be improved
by the introduction of Angora rabbits. The
Angora rabbit is said to be as much superior to
plain bunny as the Angora goat is to the seces-
sionist politician.

“ Yarrum ” : One of our oldest natives
told me that he frequently noticed that the
coastal blacks —living chiefly on fish and oysters—
were full-blooded and weighty, whilst those of the
table lands and further back, feeding on wallabies
and the like, were lanky, narrow-chested, and had
legs lilce pipe-stems. My old friend knew one
dusky savage—tomahawked at Brisbane Water by
his gin—who was considerably over lflst., whilst
ho never met an out-back darky that went over
12st. The active lives of the hunters for food
may have had something to do with their spare-
ness of body. The fishermen, from mostly sitting
about, would naturally become corpulent. When
they got to war the lean and lanky men used to
get all over the fat fish-eaters.

A S. Australian Sunday thirst is mighty,
and must prevail. The police were busy watching
the pubs, for Sunday trading. They were deter-
mined no beer should be sold that day. A local
man was thirsting. He promptly gave a drunk in
charge for “insulting behavior” in front of his
premises. It took two constables to run the
drunk in, and as that is the limit of the force in
the town, the thirsty one rushed for the first pub.
and got his beer while the police had their hands
full.

“ O’-Fipp ” : I have found a Fatman’s ideal
worker. He is working on a Vic. Western District
station for 12s. a week, can neither read nor write,
and boasts that he has never had a bath during
his 60-odd years of life. According to him “the
doctors say baths is bad for yer.” He believes in
witches, and suffers from corns, Freetrade vievvs
and Yellow-Pupism. He says the Labor party is
trying to bring in the “minyonmum label ” and
the “ union franchise,” and if it brings in theso
weird monsters all immigrants will be thrown into
the sea. He has a vague idea that the “squire ”
he is working for discovered Australia ; also that
William of Orange beat Bonyparty at Waterloo.
Says he doesn’t know what this place is coming to
when children fail to tug their forelocks at the
squire’s approach. They were always taught to
greet their “ betters ” humbly in his native village
in the Cold Country.
A PEG ON WHICH TO HANG A CASE .
The Federal Capital site question was alluded to in
the Legislative Assembly by Mr. W. Young, who
asked the Premier whether Mr. Deakin had yet carnea
out his promise to drive in a survey peg', with a view of
bringing about a breach of the peace, so that the ques-
tion might come before the High Court for decision.
Mr. Carruthers replied that he did not desire to bring
about a breach of the peace. The proposal was simply
that a peg should be put in on which to hang a case.

4 ‘ Gilrooney ”:
The rabbit is a
target for all sorts
of pastoral and
agricultural ana-
themas, but he is
doing something
for this country
which Australia
might well be
thankful for —he is
teaching the rising
generation how to
shoot. Go to any
home in the bush
to-day, and you’ll
find the little sport-
ing rifle regarded
as an indispensable
part of the house-
hold parapherna-
lia. Walkthrough
the paddocks after
school, and you’ll
see young Austra-
lia dodging from
tree to tree, or
creeping on his
hands and knees, or
formulating some
strategical move
ment to bag the
wonderfully elu-
sive bunny. It is
quite a common
thing to see the
whole family, from
mother down to the
six-year-old imp of pre-
cocity, astoundingly proficient with the rifle.
And yet, just because an accident happens
occasionally (very occasionally, considering
the number of rifles in use), some of our
grandmotherly pressmen and idiotic legisla-
tors want to restrict the use of firearms.
J3ah ! the rabbit, instead of being a curse
to Australia, may yet prove to be an all-
pervading blessing. And after all, a fatality
now and again is a very light price to pay
for teaching the young Australian idea how
to shoot. For, mark my words, the pre-
cocious bush-boy, who is to-day dodging from
cover to cover in quest of bunny, will be a mighty
valuable asset by-and-bye when the invader tills
his cartridge-belt and begins shooting for keeps.

“Watty” : Can support “ Jlay X.” (B
10/8/’O5) re the wonderful indifference of the
blacks to pain. Some years ago, when they were
plentiful along the Bight, a fight took place
between the Esperance tribe and a combined
team of Jerrimungup and Cocanarup warriors,
the visitors had travelled 150 miles. About 200
bucks were in the melee. They fought where the
town of Ravensthorpe now stands. Before hos-
tilities commenced each tribe lit a fire. Spears,
war kylies and nullas were used., As the battle
progressed casualties were numerous. Many
penetrated thighs and calves. If they went
clean through, the wood was snapped off and
drawn out, and a fire stick was then thrust
through the wound. The spears were all barbed
a ll i° n ? S *^ e were extricated from the
fiesh by passing a long-bladed knife along the
shaft until the barb was located and both drawn
out together. This saved the wound from being
too jagged. After the bore hole had been cauta-
rised with the fire stick, the wounded again rushed
into the fight anxious for revenge. Such rough-
and-ready surgery produced good results, as these
wounds invariably healed. Stomach and body
wounds received similar treatment. It takes a lot
to kill a nigger.
A CHIP OF THE OLD BLOCK.
“Now, vader, look oudt! ’ Arf-a-crown, or I

“ Thurla ” : In the matter of those people
who have been writing re Old Sofala (B. 24/S/’O5) :
Sergeant M Carty succeeded Sergeant Meagher,
who was stationed at.Cowra (not Corowa) about
three years. He was removed to Walgett in 1870.
Sergeant Sutherland was shot by George Grey, a
Cotton Valley native (Goulburn district), ’at
Horan’s Hut in 1868. Several Cotton Valley
natives were taken on in the Force, in the hope of
arresting Grey ; but he was never caught. I have
the foregoing on the authority of Police Senior-
Sergeant Ewing, who was a member of the gold
escort mentioned by “ Burrowong.” A few years
ago I met a bushman who spoke of meeting, on
the Paroo, a semi-lunatic named Grey, who used
to boast of shooting Sergeant Sutherland at
Horan’s Hut, on Benni Creek.
NON-COMMITTAL.
PUBLICAN : “ What's the beer like?”
DRINKER (dubiously): "Well, it's wet.”
“ Wilbea” : Re “H.G.’s” wail (B.
13/7/’05). If he is referring to the ancient pestle
and mortar discovered on the Yodda goldfield
(B.N.G.), this find was given by the owners,
certain miners, to the resident magistrate, who
promptly sent it to the British Museum for
identification. These two implements are of
granite, and roughly carved. The natives have
never seen anything similar, and have no record of
any race prior to themselves. Fragments of orna-
mental pottery have also been dug up on the north-
east coast; they were totally different from any-
thing now in use. By the way, last year, at Fisher-
man Island, Port Moresby, at low water was seen
the almost complete fossii of a man, embedded in
the coral. Immediately some very zealous Govern-
ment officials proceeded to blow the figure out
with dynamite, and, as a consequence, only a few
fragments were recovered, which were promptly
sent by one officer to his sister in London. Every-
thing goes to London.'
* * * *
“ D.H.R.” : A deal of money used to be
wasted by the old-time squatters in the matter of
green-hide. Bullock after bullock used to
be skinned and the hide flung raw on the
fence from sheer habit, till at length there
would be an accumulation of a hundred or
two. Then they would be hauled down and
burnt to make way for others. No one ever
thought of selling the hides in those days of
recklessness and plenty ; and even had they
done so, the lack of transport service would
have effectually precluded any such practice.
Also hides were many more in a week in
those wicked dark ages than now. Nobody
killed his own calf then, and salt would
often run out six months before a fresh
supply of rations arrived, and so a neigh-
bor’s bullock was slaughtered every time
a pound of steak was wanted. On one
station, on the Warrego, over 170 bul-
locks were slaughtered in 10 months, and
on another ranch on the Upper
Darling, where there were over 30
white men and two or three tribes
of aborigines to feed, 282 were killed
from one burning of skins to another
—eight months. Fancy the land kings
nowadays throwing the hides away on the
odd occasion on which they kill a beast ! They
would never be able to pay those £6OOO cheques
to land agents if they indulged in such waste.

“D-H.11.” : The alleged benefits accruing
from the Shearers’ Accommodation Act are
not very apparent. Round this (Walgett, N.S.W.)
district, most of the old huts were preferable to
the new ones. The old ones were built of slabs,
and with a little ingenuity on the part of the
shearers could be made fairly weather-tight, and
were always moderately warm. The new ones
are mostly built of galvanised iron, and, as
shearing commences hereabouts in July and early
in August, they are little better than refrigerating
chambers. The shearers and shed hands are
constantly affected with bronchitis and other lung
troubles. There are no fireplaces in the huts, and
as the floors are mostly boarded, the manager
especially stipulates that no oil-drums or other
improvised fireplaces shall be used.
Nulla : ‘ C.H.R.” says “all Tasmanian
lizards are harmless.” But, barring a rare Mexi-
can and S. American lizard, are not all legged
reptiles so ? That is, as far as poison glands are
concerned. I know the go.’s bite often turns into
a nasty sore, but the irritation is probably caused
by the virus on the teeth, as in the case of a rat’s
bite. Solomon Islanders poison their arrows by
sticking them into a decaying body, a chief’s for
preference. Well, what price a go.’s teeth ? Con-
sidering the carrion he surrounds, he should be
deadlier than a deat|i-adder.

“The Prooshan” about an unusual
animal
Some time in the seventies, the proprietor of Mumble-
dool Station purchased a swamp buffalo bull and cow at
one of the Aquariums, trucked them to Devlin’s Siding,
and had them driven to the station. The bull was a low-
set model of a beast, and hairless, save on the point of
his tail, which resembled a pig’s. He was noted for other
special qualifications of course, the chief being his love of
water, and a strong smell, peculiar to his kind and not
unpleasant altogether.
One day, Rambulate, the overseer, struck a traveller
making a fire in the lane to boil the billy. His mate was
just coming back at full speed from the dam, his hat
gripped in one hand, an empty can in the other, and
with wild eyes and hair on end. He declared he’d seen
“ the orfulest blanky thing in the blanky tank a man could
clap eyes on, come up outer the water, just where I leans
down to dip the billy, and sniffs at me.” “Pooh, that
wouldn’t hurt you, that’s only a buriyip,” said Rambulate,
but it was a long time before he could coax the man over
to the dam. Then, stamping on the bank, he shouted,
“ Billy Billy ! ” Whereupon the buffalo climbed out and
started towards him, but the swaggies shifted like
greased lightning, and, gathering their substance, fled.
Some weeks after, a drover camped on the station-
fence with 490 cattle. Rambulate said to the man in
charge: “ There’s a buffalo bull in that paddock, and if
he takes it into his head to come down to-night look
out.” Drover said “ He’d like to see the bloomin’ buffalo
that ’ud shift hie camp ; ” but about 2 a.m. that bull did,
come down, like a smell on the fold, and a stampede fol-
lowed on a very magnificent scale. After the fragments
were collected, and the news passed round, drovers
camped elsewhere.
One day, after Billy had been on the run six months, a
new hand started ringing in Bill’s paddock, all unaware
of the bull’s presence, and was working round a big tree,
when, hearing a sniff behind, he looked round and con-
fronted William. His dart for home was meteoric, and,
on meeting the overseer, he said : “ By ghost, I got a
nice fright up there to-day. Yer might ’er told me about
that blanky injy-rubber bull yer got there—frightened
hell outer me.”

“T. A.”: The S.A. Cold Water partyis right
when it claims that there are too many licensed
houses in the State. Nearly every country town pos-
sesses unnecessary pubs.—mournful, desolate piles,
generally kept by disappointed pessimists, and
frequented by the village dead-beat and a dissi-
pated dog. They are the monuments of the beery
borrowing days, when the country was too irre-
sponsible or too drunk to worry about details, and
much of Cohen’s “ little allowance ” went into the
till of Bung. Port Augusta, the dead northern
seaport, is the awful example. It possesses 11
pubs., paying among them about £7 10s. in weekly
rent. Some of the “licensed caretakers” pay no
rent. In the “good old days,” every house did a
flourishing trade. To-day, trade is rapidly be-
coming a matter of barter.

“M.A.0.U.”: “San Remo” is correct
about morelia varigata (carpet snake) attaining
17ft. For a morelia that is not a record by
a long chalk. It is no novelty here (Cape
York) to be startled in the night by the
fowls, and on investigation to discover a monster
of 14ft. or 15ft. long with half-a-dozen birds com-
fortably packed away in its copious stomach. Our
record here is 19ft. sAin. in length, with a girth
measurement of 27in.
A temperance yarn :—-
A coterie of hard-faced fogies were discussing “ Ro-
mances of Fortune,” as suggested by the series of articles
in the Argus. One aged liar had just finished his con-
tribution to the entertainment, when a humorless-looking
person with a long wilderness of upper lip cut into the
talk :
“I know a darned sight better romance than that,” he
said. “You’ve all heard of Bill the Buster? Well, old
Bill used to go about the bush pretending that he was
prospecting—leastways, he did when he wasn’t drunk.
He never found nothing except once, and that was the
skeleton of a blaJc gin. Bill used to pitch fabulous stories
about the strikes he was going to make. While waiting
for them he was a sort of shocking example through over-
indulgence in liquor. This had gone on for years, and
although Bill never earned any money but a bob now and
again for odd jobs done for worthy citizens of the town,
he always proudly described himself in official documents
as a mining speculator. Well, at last the local constable,
the criminal season being kinder ebb-tide like, was
obliged to speak to him. ‘Bill,’ says he, with dignity
and sternness, ‘if you don’t sober and take some legiti-
mate exercise instanter and forthwith, I’ll be compelled
to do me unpleasant duty and run you in on a charge of
being a vagrant and a confirmed and unmitigated ine-
briate, contrary to the statutes, and with insulting
behavior to the force.’ Bill was staggered. ‘l’ll go out
to my mine in the morning,’ says he, ‘and pursue the
elusive goddess fortune with a pick.’
“ Next day Bill contrived to get hold of a time-payment
pick, shovel, and dish and slid into the first easy-looking
abandoned shaft he could find on the outskirts of the
field, to make a show of doing something and satisfy the
law. Bill started to pick at the bottom of the hole.
Presently the pick hooked into something. Now Bill’s
nerves wasn’t too good and the light in the shaft was dull,
and, as the thing on the pick kept coming and coming out
in great coils, Bill’s hair began to rise, tie had before
seen many varieties of snakes, but a reptile which seemed
as endless as a deep sea cable was anew experience. In
a clammy panic Bill broke the record in getting out of the
shaft, and fled wildly and blindly through the bush until
he dropped from exhaustion. Next day he took the
blessed pledge, and has never touched a drop of alcohol
since.
“ But the most curious thing is what happened next.
When Bill had fully regained his normal condition of
mind, he one day went back to the shaft to get his left
property and see if there really was a monstrous reptile
in it. He then found that on the previous occasion he
had unearthed a great length of rope left there by the
original owners of the mine. He also found that the side
of the shaft had fallen in, and Bill was electrified to see
the ragged edge of a rich gold lode exploded. Eventually
Bill floated the mine, called it the ‘ Jim Jam Block One,’
and from first to last took £91,427 3s. 9fd. out of it.”

LITTLE BOY (reading the news): “Say, father ,
how many hands did you have when you

The intelligence of the dog
sometimes seems almost supernatural. Hogan
belonged to a lodge composed entirely of perfervid
“ greens,” and Brown to one of equally rampant
“ yellows.” The lodges meet weekly at the local
town hall. Each man possesses a dog which
attends him to the lodge meetings, and (until
lately) if the animals chanced to meet there was
instant fight. But Brown (who was yellow) fell
in love with a colleen, and for her sake he ’verted
and joined Hogan’s' lodge of good Romans. The
first night that the ’verted Brown put in an
appearance at the new fold, Hogan's dog emerged
from under his master’s chair and, running eagerly
to Brown’s quadruped, welcomed him with every
sign of gratification; and in a short while the
pair were playing together in perfect amity, and
ready to make common cause against White’s dog
if it turned up.

From the Family Reader (England),
8/7/’O5 : —
Tarantulas are bred in Australia for the sake of their
webs, the filaments of which are made into threads for
balloons. They are much lighter than silk.
Possibly the Booth emigrants wish to come out to
our tarantula farms, having invented a process by
which the webs can be made into big-drum
material.
A CONVERSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A revival epidemic, like typhoid or the ’flu’,
Spread out as fat as Boiling- Downs, upon the far Barcoo.
Amongst the greatest converts who were brought to hope
and grace
Was Peter John Macpherson, who was owner of the place.
He owned all Boiling Downs, and all the land for mile 8
around,
And he saw his chances in the sky were anything but
sound.
When opening his Bible, he of other rich men read,
He marked with consternation all the things that volume
said.
To yield up all his riches was a thing he could not face,
So he questioned many parsons on the horror of the case—
Of the camel and the needle, and the things that they im-
plied ;
And he asked them of his prospects when he reached the
other side.
But he asked them with much cursing, and the parsons
mostly fled,
And said they would not gladly take his place when he
was dead.
They felt that harps and halos, and wings and golden
crowns,
Were not for men who swore like Peter John of Boiling
Downs. i-
. $ "
At last he found some comfort, for the Reverend Jonas
Bray , f :
Explained the Bible stcry in a soft, consoling way.
“ The needle was a gateway through which passed the
folks who sinned ;
Any camel .could get through it, if the beast were only
tinned.”
So Peter kept his riches, and he made no further search,
But went away in haste and joined himself unto the
church ;
But sometimes with anxiety his scanty locks are thinned
As he dreams that he may also have to go to heaven
tinned.

MIXED POLITICS.


A scientific gentleman has discovered
that the world Is steadily growing colder,
and sooner or later the time must arrive
when the whole globe will be ice-bound.
The question then arises, 'how Is
any kind of life to be preserved ? But
Mr. Martin, the savant in question, re-
minds us that alcohol congeals at a much
lower temperature than water ; thus. If
alcohol could be substituted for the water
which constitutes the greatest portion of
living matter, it might be possible to
prolong the existence of life for a few
hundred thousand years after the Oulf
Stream had become a glacier.
Well, that's something to took forward
to I How delicious It will be a few years
hence to sit on a nice cool glacier In Syd-
ney Harbor and keep yourself alive with'
good, wholesome, nourishing grog, and
to know that all the never-touch-lt
cranks and prohibition agitators had been
frozen out long ago.

CHIEFLY IN N.S.W.


George Reid’s misreading of Opposition to
mean Obstruction—with a big o—makes him an
unconscious incentive to the abolition of Party
'Government. The lolly-sucker never admits that
there should be only one party in the Common-
wealth, the party of D.C.L.—the whisky of that
ilk being the principal power in expanding the
principle of progress. The D.C.L. brand doesn’t
appeal forcibly to George. It is the Whisky of
the Wise, and he will never be wise.*
PERSONAL ITEMS.
What a world of difference between Peter
Close and Peter Open !
Ethel Mills, the best' short-story writer
among the literary women Australia has pro-
duced, is now in London doing well. She has
had short stories accepted by the Pall Mall and
other magazines,
“Fifty years ago I was a member of a
church choir,” said Vic. Premier Bent the other
day. He added that “Praise God from Whom
All Blessings Flow ” is his favorite hymn, and
Tommy regrets it is not so much sung now as it
used to be.
Speaker Cowley, of Queensland Assembly,
is a man of endurance. During the recent all-
night debate on the Land Monopoly Tax Bill he
didn’t once rise from the chair from 7 o’clock at
night till the same hour in the morning, when the
House adjourned for breakfast.
Tommy Burgess, claiming to be the oldest
Australian-born compositor, died lately at the
Royal Park Institution for old men (Vic.). He was
a lightning type-setter, but saw visions, and was
well established in the mussel and periwinkle
trade long before the lino, invaded his calling.
Mr. E. Riley, appointed Labor represen-
tative to the Arbitration Court, has had a useful
Union career in Victoria and N.S. Wales. He is
Scotch by birth, like his predecessor, and is a
sensible, moderate man, who will undoubtedly be
a success in the Court if Joseph fails to assassinate
it.
Little Cohen (S.A.) has climbed half way
towards the summit of his ambition, for he is now
Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He is a ver-
satile young man, for although a Jew he once led
a Wesleyan choir in Fiji. It is almost necessary
to have led a choir of some sort to succeed in S.A.
politics.
London Spectator announces the appear-
ance, in its pages, of a series of “How it
Strikes an Australian ” articles, by young Aus-
tralian author J. H. M. Abbott, son of late
Speaker Abbott (N.S.W.). Abbott has done
excellent work in journalism, and wrote the best
Australian book on the S’African war.
Ancient Captain William Jackson Barry,
of Maoriland (the man who rode on a whale), has
been left a handsome fortune by a relative who
died in Hampshire (Eng.), so he will be able to
spend his declining days in comfort. Barry’s idea
of comfort consists in bringing out another book
of hoary reminiscences.
Nigger labor advocate GOVERNOR LE HUNTE,
of S.A., and the HON. “LITTLE RED
RIDING ” HOOD , his secretary.
The removal of the remains of W. C.
Wentworth from Vaucluse, near Sydney, is pro-
posed, owing to the subdivision and sale of the
property. The “ Father of the N.S.W. Constitu-
tion ” died in England, but the body was taken
out and buried at \ aucluse to satisfy local senti-
ment. James Martin’s speech over the grave of
“the first of first-born Australians” was declared
by those who heard it one of the finest orations
delivered in Australia.
The lowly Christian modesty of some
people is a beautiful thing. The four pictured
“Men of the Hour” in “ Bleeds ” Fitchett’s Life
for September appear in this order: W. H.
Fitchett, LL.D., editor of Life ; W. W. Jacobs,
author of “ Many Cargoes ” ; the late John Hay,
ex-TJ.S. Secretary of State ; the Hon. Elihu Boot,
John Hay’s successor in the U.S. Cabinet. But
quite a number of things in the same issue aren’t
about Fitchett.
Jeremiah Twomey, ex-M.L.C., and pro-
prietor of Temuka Leader, apologised to the
squad of New Liberals (Maoriland’s “ New Libel ”
party), after they had, sued him for £lOOO apiece
for defamatory remarks in an article called “ The
Soiled Doves ”; also, Jeremiah paid all exes.
Twomey had faced an action brought by another
politician just previously. Quite lately it was
Jerry’s boast that he hadn’t had a libel suit in
22 years. He has since had five in about five
weeks.
The Glen Innes (N.S.W.) school exhibit
tion, at which Inspector S. H. Smith will consti-
tute a camp of teachers., and give daily expositions
of how to conduct a wayback school, recalls the
exploits of C. Wesley Caddy, afterwards a Sydney
journalist, in a similar capacity in the Palace
Garden grounds at the great Sydney Exhibition.
Caddy, a highly efficient country teacher, was
brought to Sydney by the Department to show
visitors to the Exhibition how the master of a
country school performed his duties. He held an
imaginary school and taught imaginary children,
but he was a great success as a show. Few Sydney
people had seen a bush schoolmaster in harness,
and they took Caddy’s burlesque quite seriously.
So did the authorities for that matter.
Sam Smith, late workers’ representative
on the Arbitration Court Bench, now very ill, has
been in politics one way and another since he was
14 years of age, one of his duties at that period
being to call together the colliers for meetings in
a Scotch village. Ever since, on sea and land, he
has helped labor movements wherever he found
them. He is still under 50.
Some birthdays in October are : Editor
Bonython, M.H.R. (S.A.), 57 on the 15th ; Judge
Hartley Williams (Vic), 62 on the 15th; James
Fairfax (N.S.W.), 71 on the 17th; ex-wicket*
keeper A. H. Jarvis, 45 on the 18th; and Presi-
dent H. J. Wrixon (Vic.), 66 on the same day ;
Kingston, M.H.R. (S.A.), 55 on the 22nd; ex-
Premier Neil Lewis (Tasmania). 47 on the 27th;
ex-Judge Boucaut (S.A.), 74 on the 29th.
Died at Mosman (Sydney), the other day,
aged 65, W. W. Johnson, timber merchant, rail-
way contractor, pastoralist, mine-lessee, news-
paper proprietor, steamship-owner, and other
things too numerous to mention. He constructed
the tramway from Newcastle to Wallsend ; held
stations in the Scone and Singleton districts, and
was lessee of the Cardiff (N.S.W.) colliery. He
was a pioneer of the steamer traffic on Lake Mac-
quarie ; also he was part proprietor of the New-
castle Herald and a director of the Wallsend Gas
Co.
A Victorian National League speaker,
advertised as a University she, expatiates at
length, but to little purpose, on the evils of
Socialism. One inquisitive country person one
night casually inquired of what University she
was Bachelor of Arts. The dame had to own up
that she had never taken a degree of any sort,
and that the cap and gown she wore denoted
nothing but a desire to look learned and superior.
The Stinking Fish, anti-Socialistic party seems
unreliable even in its clothes.
There must have been a spacious curse
somewhere about the family or person of the late
unlamented heroine of the Richmond (Vic.)
tragedy—the dwarf, Rosina Hubbard. First, her
sister's baby died of suspected poisoning; then
her brother, ditto ; then she poisoned her mother;
then her lawyer met with an accident and lay
in the hospital for weeks; then the solicitor,
who took up his legal brother’s case, suicided ;
finally, Rosina herself passed out. Now the
lawyers who are fighting over her will feel them-
selves carefully every morning for unhealthy
symptoms.
So far the N.S.W. Lands Commission has
dealt with 91 payments to land-agents. Of these
W. N. Willis, who left for South Africa, is said to
have collected 51; Peter Close, who rounded on
his alleged mate, seems to have got 23; Charles
Bath, who wouldn’t explain who signed the bill
for £l5O, has five ascribed to him; and R. D,
Meagher, who wants to get back into the honor-
able profession of the law, is credited with four.
The other eight are divided among six men. The
biggest fee mentioned (£5554) is charged to Willis ;
so is the smallest (£10), which shows a great mind
able to deal with large things and also to descend
to infinite detail.
A story which may be true :
David Syme, of the Agb, has been interesting himself
in spiritualism lately, and his gaunt, hard figure and
Carlylean face have been conspicuous at recent Melbourne
seances where a potent wizard produced relics from Troy,
articles of interest from old Babylon, and brick records
from ancient Egyptian tombs, along with such modern
trifles as weird fresh fish wet from the sea, and curious
Indian bakements hot from the original oven. Syme
beheld these things with Caledonian "caution. Then the
other night he arose, and asked the Indian spirit then
under control to produce an Indian vernacular paper of
that day’s date. The spirit discovered a hitch in his
business arrangements. He asked if the gentleman
wouldn’t prefer a pickled herring from Yarmouth or a
cockchafer from Thebes, as his Indian communications
were cut or something. Davy persisted in a sad, Scotch
way, saying he wanted the paper badly. Then the spirit
got angry, and said it would see him in a helmet first, or
sounds like that, and a Caledonian stern and wild drifted
from the seance, saying it would be a verra gude show if
it were a great deal better.
Melbourne Herald lately fossicked out
the oldest Melbourne natives, three of whom are
Mrs W. Hogg, of Inverell (N.S.W.), born at
Captain Brown’s station, eight miles from Mel-
bourne, July 13, ’4l; Mrs. K. T. Churchman,
born where Richmond Town Hall now stands,
January 1, ’42; and Mr. W. Cheney, born on
what is now the Royal Arcade, in January, ’42.
There doesn’t seem anything remarkable about
these elderly persons except that they made an
early start, so to speak. Possibly they have heard
more about the “great natural resources” than
the rest of the citizens; and doubtless the
“Socialistic trend of existing legislation” has
grieved them more and more every year. Cer-
tainly, Mrs. Hogg was stolen by blacks when she
was a baby a day old, but as those harmless
nonentities returned her as a useless encumbrance
the day following, she had barely time to catch a
cold, or any other complaint.
Water-jug Foster’s long endurance was at
the bottom of a good deal of the feeling shown
during the discussion in N.S.W. Assembly upon
Waddell s Bill for the abolition of j udicial pensions.
But it should have been remembered, on the other
hand, that several Judges—such as Windeyer—
died promptly on coming into pension, and most
Judges died in office. Whether the system is
right or wrong, the length of the pensioner’s life
should not figure as an argument one way or the
Other. When Gavan Duffy proposed to leave
politics, the Vic. Parliament was prepared to pass
him a gratuity of £5OOO ; but Gavan’s friends said
his health was so bad that a couple of years would
end him, so a pension of £lOOO a year was substi-
tuted as a matter of economy. Gavan drew
the amount regularly for some 40 years. This
looked like getting at the public, but it was merely
an incident in a gamble—the public might have
won.
Thomas Woolner, pre-Raphaelite sculptor
and poet, mentioned as an old-time Melbourne
resident (B. 7/9/’O5), wrote to English friends in
1853 that he had “a good prospect of getting a
statue of the Queen to do for Melbourne.” A
hitch arose in the arrangements, and Melbourne
managed to do without Her Majesty’s statue
(which James White now has under way) for 32
years. Woolner came to Australia with another
sculptor, the late Bernard Smith, members of
whose family still live in Victoria. Like most
immigrants of the period, Woolner and Smith put
in a spell at the diggings, but they had no luck.
Melbourne National Gallery contains four of
Woolner’s busts and medallions. When he re-
turned to London in 1854, he was promised the
commission for a statue of W. C. Wentworth
(playfully called “Wentworth the Lag” by Ford
Madox Brown, who records the incident in his
diary). After various delays, another sculptor
got the job. W. M. Rossetti, annotating Brown’s
diary, surmises that “the Lag” refers to Went-
worth’s lagging habits. But all Australians were
‘ ‘ lags ” of another kind in the slap-dash estimation
of English writers half-a-century ago.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA.—A TORY DREAM.
The Victorian Eight Hours pioneers are a
long-lived brigade. Next year the jubilee of the
movement will be celebrated in Victoria. Of the 52
pioneers only 16 are on record as having “ crossed
the bar.” Great preparations are being made for
the celebration of the 1906 anniversary, and Labor-
leader Prendergast is compiling a history of the
movement.
Some anthropological observations. In
proportion to stature, Spruce Myth has the
smallest foot in the House of Representatives,
Willimotor Kelly the largest. O’Malley is the
hairiest man, Higgins the baldest. The largest
noses (among the Gentiles) are those of Wilks and
Glynn, and the biggest mouth is hidden by the
whiskers on the face of ex-parson Ronald. John
Forrest has the greatest weight and the thickest
neck, and Pumpkin Smith has the most remark-
able beard.
The relatives of an Australian Judge, now
dead, say that, during the last days of his life,
there arrived, addressed to him, many letters in
which the writers stated how glad they were at
his Honor’s sufferings and approaching death, and
stated that there was no doubt that his Honor
would go to hell. Almost the last words of the
Judge were : “ Painful as my duties were in many
instances, I believe I am leaving behind me no
enemies.” So little do some men know what other
men think of them.
J. T. Walker and W. J. Lyne are the only
active N.S.W. politicians of the Federal Conven-
tion who stand up with fair consistency for the
Constitution they agreed to and helped to devise.
Reid, even when in power, sneaks out ways to
undermine the Commonwealth and enhance the
power of the States, his Own. State in particular ;
Carruthers spends his sour and uncivil soul o’
nights searching for imaginary grievances against
the Australian Parliament; Brunker thinks the
new-fangled system? awfully bad for N.S.W., his
cow; M‘Millan sulks, snaps and snarls; Abbott
is dead; Wise is abroad; and Barton and O’Connor
have left politics.
On one of the small old mining townships
in Victoria there is a man who, some years back,
went with a party of zealots of both sexes to assist
in converting the Chow to Christianity. When
he left his native place he was a young fellow of
fine physique and cheerful disposition. He re-
turned a mental and physical wreck, and nbw the
very sight of a Chinaman either throws him into a
fit, or brings on an outbreak of lunacy. Then the
poor wretch displays abject terror, and runs to
hide himself, screaming pitiably. Hidden under
a bed he witnessed the revolting massacre of a
mission party by Chinese fanatics during one of
the risings a short time back, and his present con-
dition is the result of that experience.
John Mathieson, former Commissioner of
Kanakaland, and afterwards of Victorian rail-
ways, seems to have settled down very comfort-
ably to his position as general manager of the
Midland line (England). Since taking up the
work his own salary has been increased by a thou-
sand or two, and now stands at about £4500,
whilst his company the other day decided to give
him a lieutenant at £2OOO a year. While the
Midland mileage of lines is not astounding, the
train mileage beats that of all Australia put toge-
ther, and, as Mr. Mathieson explains, the greater
the number of trains, and tlm less the line accom-
modation, the more complex the job. Also the
joint use of lines with other companies is the
biggest trial English managers have. John
Mathieson, in fact, avers that his old billets in
Australia were just child’s-play when compared
with his present one. At the same time, he
carries responsibility well, and is as spruce as ever.
In pursuance of its recent penny ’orrible
policy, the Argus published last week a bush--
ranging story of the roaring AO’s, for the particular
purpose, perhaps, of introducing the name of Peter
Snodgrass, father of Mrs. Janet Clarke. The
paternal Snodgrass is described as a Melbourne
clubman, and an “adventurous spirit ” who fought
two duels without drawing his adversary’s gore.
In one case he was so valorously excited that he
fired downwards by accident, and put a bullet
into his own big toe. However, Snodgrass helped
to kill a bushranger in the Argus yarn (his aim
being fairly accurate at very short range), and
after the surviving desperadoes had been cornered,
he and the other adventurous spirits signed a
paper promising them “lenient treatment” by
the Law. This document proved worthless,
legally and otherwise. The three prisoners were
finally carted to the gallows, each seated on his
coffin, and in the presence of an admiring Mel-
bourne populace they were hanged by the neck.
If they got any lenient treatment it must have
been in the next world.
The report that Nicholas Willis has gone
amissing in South Africa seems to blow through
the atmosphere once a day these times. When
last heard of, Nicholas had made limited progress
at convincing a judge in Natal that the warrant
sent over for him was bad, but he had got his bail
reduced. People who know the one-time bush
Nicholas reckon that if he really wants to go he
will go, and that if he doesn’t want the local
police to find him they won’t find him. Nicholas
is still a mighty active man on the kopje and the
veldt, and trifles like a kloof or a donga are
nothing to him.
Captain Ernest Gaunt, who has been
appointed to the second-class cruiser Cambrian,
newly-commissioned to the Australian station, is
a son of Judge Gaunt, of Yictoria. He joined the
navy in 1878, and, as Lieutenant, was Commis-
sioner at Wei-hai-Wei (China), and Administrator
of the Province in 1898-99. For his services
during the Boxer unpleasantness he was thanked
by the Austrian and German Commanders-in-
Chief. Later he went to Somaliland what time
the Mad Mullah was very mad thereabouts, and
commanded the landing party from the Mohawk
which “ avenged ” the death of Italian naval
officer Lieut. Graban. For this he received an
Italian military medal, and was thanked by the
Italian Chamber of Deputies. So he can fairly be
classed as a much-thanked man. It isn’t every
man of his age to whom three great Powers have
addressed a few well-chosen remarks. Another
son of Judge Gaunt is also a navy man—Com-
mander Guy Gaunt, of the Cressy, stationed at
Portsmouth.
Ex-barrister Richard Colonna Close, who
died of heart failure at Sydney, the other day,
aged 65, was a native of England, and an Oxford
University graduate. He began life as an Angli-
can parson in charge of Pitton chapel, Devon-
shire, and was afterwards chaplain to the Life
Guards (Blue). He was an excellent linguist, and
during a lengthy spell in Russia was Professor of
Languages at St. Petersburg University, and
tutor of English to the late Czar Alexander and
the Grand Dukes Sergius and Vladimir. He
began his Australian career in a Brisbane pulpit,
and later went to Melbourne to edit the
Federal Australian. Next, he moved to
Sydney, and was called to the Bar in 1882, but
some time back he was disbarred at his own re-
quest, and admitted as a solicitor. The Law
didn’t treat him too well in either branch. He
was an earnest Federationist, a strong supporter
of the old age pension principle, and something of
a local institution.
Violent language from Melbourne :
Tom Bent, seeking opportunities of exposing himself as
a long-eared animal, never misses any events connected
with musical and literary competition that come off
within a comfortable motor run of the Vic. metropolis,
and of all the follies with which untoward success and
newspaper flapdoodle have swelled the Bentian head, the
idea that he is a connoisseur of poetry and general litera-
ture and a reliable musical guide is the most lamentable.
Bent on a public platform, singing snatches of execrable
songs in a voice like a cross between the complaint of a
scorched dog and the lament of a bull calf, is only a little
less wonderful than the same massive person giving the
public points about literature and literary taste. He even
makes up wedges of shameless verse, and fires them off
with a complacent fatuity that sets the people shrieking
with laughter, although it never- seems to dawn on Mr.
Premier that he is being laughed at because he is a ridicu-
lous object doing monstrously idiotic things. It is now
quite a popular joke to lure Bent to prize distributions in
connection with these competitions,, and pull his leg till
he gets up and sings, or recites, or tells senile anecdotes
about his old-time theatrical excursions. When you hear
an unusually hoarse and horrid roar in the vicinity of
Melbourne now-a-times, you know it is either put up by
the crowd at an exciting football match or by the push
fooling Mr. Premier to the top of his Bent.
“ Talking of bushrangers,” said an M.L.O.
the other night in the N.S.W. Parliamentary
library, “ always brings up to me poor old Hoddle
White. He sat beside me over there in the
Council for years, and the last conversation we
had before the great shadow fell on him was about
the sticking-up at Deniliquin. White, as you
know, was there in the Bank of New South Wales,
the Deniliquin branch, and the ’rangers fell on
him armed to the teeth. They roped him up, and
made off with £8000; but blest if the young
fellow didn’t break free and make after them, and,
what is more, he took back most of the money and
landed the outlaws into the hands of the police.
He did something almost as remarkable on the
Gympie road, in- Queensland, on another occasion.
He was a white man every inch, and the pink of
honor ih sport. I think I was the first to notice
anything wrong with his mind. Over a oup of
tea in the refreshment room he persisted in calling
his famous Oup horse by the name of his yacht.
He wasn’t drinking, and I set him right a couple
of times, but he had the ideas twisted, and I left
him, not knowing what to say. That was fully
six months before anyone thought of Callan
Park.”
Holland is the latest country to propose
the adoption of the universal militia service
system of army defence, which is just now being
urged in Australia. European peoples generally
are finding that conscription is too burdensome,
and even France now moves towards the Swiss
militia system.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, October 3, 1905.
My Dear Arini,—
Lord Alastair Mungo Graham, the prize 19-
year youngster of the Euryalus, was carefully
hedged round during his stay in Sydney.
He’s a son of the house of Montrose, and
painfully valuable. Lady Fanshawe feared
an Australian alliance. And she had good
reason. Pretty Mrs. Forbes Sempill used to
chaperone the most dangerous damsel, who is
also very pretty. Those shore luncheons worried
Admiralty House, and the lordling was invited to
stop there during the few days the Euryalus
would be at Port Melbourne. He declined
without any show of regret. Consequence: he
was commanded to leave when the Euryalus did.
And that was next morning.
Mr. Peter Close, whose evidence before the
Lands Commission caused such sensation, is a
well-known social figure. His wife raises Persian
cats. She is a daughter of the late Judge Joseph-
son, and married first a Mr. Bowyer, a school-
master. Some daughters (Bowyers), small, dark
and foreign-looking, adorn the Close mansion.
One is married to a fashionable doctor.
Pilcher, K.C., who had the (doubtless) disagree-
able task of putting the painful questions, is a
personal friend of the family.
Acting-Governoress Darley floats about opening
little shows and presenting prizes, and generally
filling in the vice-regal gap till the Rawsons arrive.
Her sister, Mrs. Cockshott, assists. All four
“Rolf Boldrewood” Browne ladies made what a
London Society paper calls ‘ ‘ charming marriages.”
The other two are Lady Peter Scratchley and
Mrs. Molesworth Greene.
Miss Eadith Walker has been giving the pina-
fored and knickerbockered members of Pointer
families a taste of her hospitality. Sixty young-
sters assembled at “Yaralla,” and the party
proceeded along acquisition lines. When the
guests weren’t taking food they were ac-
quiring presents. Small spades were handed
to them, and they dug for buried treasure—nor
did they dig in vain. A small Milner Stephen,
dressed as a postman, delivered letters that had
come through the Concord post-office addressed to
every little guest. There was no scamping of
details. And every letter contained a present of
value. Miss Walker goes to Europe in February,
and takes with her the nice-looking girl, Miss
Atkinson, who is always about with her these
days.
A globe-trotting lady who headed for Europe
some time ago left behind her a record for
generosity mixed with severity. I presume
she had what may be called the Spasmodic
Temperament, Ax all events, during her stay in
Australia, she adopted a girl of financially-decayed
parentage, and made her life a dream of happi-
ness. The girl had only one moderately present-
able dress when the dream commenced, but she
immediately had ten, and in addition it rained
bangles, and pocket-money, and motor-car rides,
and theatres. With it all, the adopted daughter
was ruled with a strong hand, and the respect and
obedience due to a parent were rigidly exacted
from her. Still it rained as I already mentioned,
and almost anything on earth that the new daugh-
ter asked for (with the respect due to a parent)
came her way. But at last she forgot the respect
due to a parent, and, instead of asking for the
11th pretty frock, she ordered it herself. The
adopted mother said nothing, but there was a cold
look in her eye. Two days later, the girl came
back to the hotel from an outing to find the
adopted mother gone. The beautiful clothes and
jewellery were gone—all except what the girl had
on her and the worn dress which reminded her of
the days of her poverty. The hotel bill was paid,
and on the mantel-shelf were two articles—a letter
which spoke severely about the sin of disobedi-
ence, and sixpence to cover tram-fares back to the
decayed parental roof.
I want to meet a woman who has good eyes yet
does not roll them ceiling-ward every time
you speak to her. A minute ago I asked a fine-
eyed woman the time. Her eyes sought the roof
while her hand went to her belt where her watch
was ambushed. Then, after reluctantly dropping
her gaze on the dial, she again looked heavenward
arid replied “eleven.” Sometimes a pig-eyed
lady fancies she has soulful saucer orbs and pro-
ceeds to do devotional antics with them. Then I
feel as if I want to be horrid with a hat-pin.
Latest matrimonial engagement of interest is
that of Mr. Ashley Teece, a son of the A.M. Pac-
tuary, to Miss Giblin, a Tasmanian girl. Bride-
groom-elect is studying for the Church. Talking
of. weddings: three Sydney girls are to marry
men-o’-warsmen next month. Miss Mosely,
Miss Gollin, and Miss Reading—last is one of
the Fairfax-Readings, and Mrs. James Fairfax
will give her a reception at the mansion on windy
Bellevue Hill, where even the earth has to be
nailed down, lest it should blow away.
Sydney University Dramatic Society gave a
performance of “The School for Scandal ” at the
Palace Theatre last week. The matter is too
painful for further mention.
A man who signs himself “Ne’er-do-Weel,”
and who writes like it, sends me this:—
Of all her insane notions, woman’s craze for having her
clothes fastened where she can’t get at the fastenings
seems to be the insanest. A registry-office keeper told
me that a woman, badly in want of work, refused a good
place as housekeeper to an old couple because, “ there
bein’ no servants kep’, there’s no one I could ask to button
up me blouses.” In a tram, a few days ago, noticed the
woman in the seat in front of me had four buttons of her
blouse undone ; result, about one square foot of bare skin,
stays and frilly things. She was young and pretty and
serenely unconscious. I hesitated for a moment. I re-
membered “ Do unto others as you would they should
do unto you,” and I tried to imagine myself a young
and pretty girl with my stays on public exhibition. Then I
begged her pardon (the hypocrisy of man !), told her what
was the matter, and proffered my assistance. She smiled,
blushed most charmingly, thanked me, and accepted, and
I covered her nakedness and other things. But next time,
When I offered assistance, the lady froze me with an icy
glare, stopped the car, and got off, the sun glinting on
her undressed parts as she stepped down. Which shows
the variable nature of the sex.
That obnoxious word of the marriage service
—“obey”—has been excised by the Method-
ist Episcopal Church. Henceforth a bride of
that faith will be called upon to “love, honor
and keep” her husband, and if she doesn’t
want to obey they can arbitrate. The substitu-
tion of “keep” for “obey” may lead to more
trouble than the original obnoxious phrase. Men
of inactive temperament will say that “keep”
means to maintain, not to retain, a husband. Some
of the 80,000 men that Coghlan and Dr. Arthur
say are in excess of women in Australia may now
marry—women of the Methodist Episcopal label.
An Australian, polishing her notes in London,
tells_me that a lady at whose parties she has been
singing, on gratis principles, promised her “a
treat.” The promise, when fulfilled, took the
form of a dinner at the famous hotel known as
Claridge’s. As the girl has to follow the strictest
of dietary rules, the treat didn’t amount to much.
Dry biscuits, apples, and a table water made up
her meal ; but, she adds, “ I was interested in
three men and two women at an adjacent
table. Didn’t notice them till one sympa-
thetic waiter told us that they were Mr. William
Rockefeller, the Standard Oil magnate, Mr.
Westinghouse (the famous brake man), and Mr.
George Gould. The ladies were Mrs. Rockefeller
and Mrs. Gould —the most plainly dressed women
in the dining-hall. A third lady joined them at
coffee. The duke who waited on us didn’t know
her, but opined that she was an Australian.
‘ When she goes out driving she carries an Aus-
tralian parrot chained to her wrist, and
amongst her luggage is a wallababy.’ But to
return to the millionaires. There were five of
these gold bugs at the hotel at the one
time the three mentioned and a Vander-
bilt and a Whitney. A daily paper told
London next morning that when the lift boy
hoisted the quintette he was lifting something
that represented £50,000,000 sterling. With
servants of various grades they swamped 30 rooms.
I may mention that my hostess has quite dropped
me for talking to the waiter. When she pointed
out (in the carriage on the way home) that no
English gentlewoman would behave so, all would
have been well if I had seemed penitent, but I
asked ‘ Well, if I hadn’t behaved so where would
the treat have coma in ? ’ I sing no more at her
parties ! ”
When a departing amateur artiste gives a con-
cert in the Town Hall, how the expenses eat
into the takings. Rent of hall, £2O; erecting the
temporary timber platform, £110s.; stopping the
chimes, 10s. ; and eight attendants (no matter if
the victim wants only three) at ss. each. And
the money has to be paid by noon on the day of
the benefit, else the doors won’t open.
Mrs. Yorke Syme, sister of our own Yes-No,
and wearing her famous diamond buckles, is in
Sydney, to attend the marriage of her niece, Miss
Ewan, who to-morrow weds Dr. Hall, of Parra-
matta. Then four Ewan girls will have married
medical men. Another visitor here is Mrs. C. 0.
Lance, whose husband ran lectures and glorified
magic lanterns in England in the interests of this
continent. Mrs. Lance will be remembered as Miss
Christie Fuller, a favorite pupil of Madame
Christian.
Madame Maggie Stirling, looking very fresh
and unchanged (save for the better), in a
Clamorous blue hat and grey serge tailor-
made, discourses modestly (over her aprieot-
tait and black coffee at the Australia) on
the kindness of ex-Covernors and consorts to her.
Actually an ex-Governor has his uses. The
Ha. ; p lens especially always gave her the close
han 1 clasp. Madame Maggie has the latest news
of the Australian colony in England. For the
rest, she opens her Sydney season to-night, and
this afternoon the Highland Society puts on its
kilts and gives her a bagpipe and haggis reception.
Miss Eva Champion, the fluffy little Maori-
lander, raised higher the already high hopes of
friends for her future prospects by her singing at
Mrs. Quesnel’s concert.
Two picturesque harpists at Amateur Orchestral
concerts are Signor Hazon’s daughters, Eugenia
and Rita, aged 16 and 13 respectively.
Mr. Jack Scantlebury, who is now part-owner
of the Ebitish Australasian, comes back here
before Christmas to fix up for correspondence.
Re fascination of legs. Heard a man say that
he had gone to the recent performance of “The
Bohemian Girl” just to see Miss Yiolet Mount in
the quite short skirts of Arline, the gipsy girl.
His opinion was that “ they ” were very straight
and pretty. He didn’t mean the skirts, you know.
Actor Albert Gran, who opens here with Tittell
Brune on the 14th, is walking from Brisbane
to Sydney. He is not sobbing, or begging, his
way—he’s just padding the hoof for the sake of
exercise and new scenery, and perhaps advt.
(which is hereby given), and at intervals he sends
wires to the management of Her Majesty’s brag-
ging of the number of miles he has flung behind
him since last wire, and telling how his boots have
gone back on him.
Hobson, the stockily-built actor, who plays
the part of George, in the “Fires of St.
John,” used to be Miss Nance O’Neil’s brother-
in-law. He was Miss Lillie Lamson’s first
husband, but the pair proved to be not com-
patible in disposition. Only that and nothing
more. They were just not accurately mated, and
the marriage bond tore in consequence. Now
there is a new brother-in-law, but Miss O’Neil’s
opinion of the ex-one is of the highest.
The best house of Miss O’Neil’s season in Sydney
was that drawn by “The Fires of St. John.”
Very few persons seem to have read the drama,
and the rush of Society hoping to be almost
scorched by the “Fires” nearly knocked down
the box office. The moral law was challenged,
but not so obviously as Society and a crowded
giggling gallery expected. A man at the back of
the d.c. summarised the opinion of many when
he said loudly, “Look here, the whole of this play
is a milk biscuit compared with the balcony scene
in ‘Romeo and Juliet’ or with ‘Mrs. Tanqueray.’”
And then he breathed hard through his nose.
A certain theatre manager, now departed, once
told me that “he couldn’t stand Dobson and
Cummerbund and them sort of playwrights.” He
meant Ibsen and Sudermann, I believe. I don’t
think there is a dramatist named Cummerbund,
nor one called Dado, but I feel somehow that
there should be. Anyhow, the writers in question
gave way, on Saturday night, at Her Majesty’s, to a
farce on the stage and to Mrs. H. Kelly’s Japanese
theatre coat in the stalls. No one wanted the
farce to start while they had that kimono for an
objective. The wearer obligingly made an excur-
sion or tw’o so that the back of the vivid crimson
garment Was on show. It expounded at the top
of its voice, in gold and silk emblazonery, the siege
of Port Arthur from a Jap. view-point, a dragon, a
cock-fight, Fuji Yama and chrysanthemums. But
it suited the Canadian immensely. One of the
Harry Rickards family got a novel effect from
concentric rings of coral in her back hair. They
hung from either end of a jewelled spike run
horizontally through the knob. Two (apparently)
sisters had turquoise combs in hair that was like
the blackest of black velvet. The blue drew the
eye to the black and vice versa, and evoked some
admiration. The Frank Gardners were boxed
with the J. C. Williamsons. In evening fluffery
and jewellery, and showing a perfect neck, the
French visitor is a beautiful creature. The
Gardners were to have started for the pleasant
land of France and Frank’s automobile works last
week, but the illness of their child delayed them.
Whilst artist Frank McComas (who married
recently a Californian belle) and his bride were at
breakfast, a morning or so after the wedding, a
Bohemian friend of his who considered he had
been coldly received by the artist, shut a.kangaroo
in the room. The ’roo bounded in a way which
put to shame the bounder responsible for its
appearance, and there were some hysterics.
McComas writes to a Sydney friend that he is
going to buy a place in England and make that
country his home.
You’ve heard of the Potts Point ’bus? It’s
driver is much loved by Potts Pointers. When
he wants your fare he just slips his hand down
through a hole. A lady, who had taken a monthly
ticket, asked him, “How shall I let you know I
am in the ’bus ? ” “ Just squeeze my hand, Mum,
instead of putting a penny in it. That’s how the
ladies who have season tickets lets me know.”
Rather a curious coincidence that the two pro-
fessional beauties, Mrs. Brown Potter and Mrs.
Langtry, have done the drop-scene act fairly
simultaneously. Both are faded beauties, and
both are going in for vaudeville, and each is
bankrupt of her ranches, her steam yachts, horses,
and villas, but, worst of all-in such cases—her
youth. Yet if Mrs. Langtry’s reminiscences were
published—and if she told the princely truth in
them—they ought to buy her much Kidderminster
carpet to keep her off the cold, cold world.
M. Eugene Lucciardi, the Vice-Consul for France
(he succeeded the Narcissus Count, who now makes
Society arabesques and cuts fleur-de-lis capers
among the ’Friscan elite), gave a beautifully-
chiselled lecture on the “L’Aiglon” of Rostand
before the Alliance Francaise some nights ago.
With brows bent and firm intent to know at
least what nouns he used, divers Australians
assembled and riveted their gaze on the gentle
Eugene’s ferocious moustache. Besides the lec-
ture he recited a poem, and Mrs. McMillan
took the place in recitation of some-
one who was ill. Mrs. McMillan is one
of the best speakers in French that Sydney
possesses. Among others who say “ oui ” with
great success are Mrs. Arthur Lassetter, the W. P.
Manning girls, and Mrs. Harry Levy. When
foreign warships are in port, and the brazen
cannon form only part of a scheme of decoration
for At Homes on board, those who can speak
idiomatic French are sure of a large and admiring
following of officer and middy. The majority of
the foreigners, Japs included, find their way
easily about the Froggy language.
Latest announced naval engagement is that of
a Bathurst belle to a man on the Challenger.
Lady was staying with Mrs. Lassetter, of “ Red-
leaf,” when hand-holding started.
A Sydney artist in hair says that things are
looking up financially in this State. Orders for
artificial hair “and packets of ladies’own comb-
ings to be made up” are rushing in from the
country. During the lean years of drought time,
hairworkers had a thin, grey time. A transfor-
mation and a tail of hair that will hang up behind
the door are not so necessary as a piece of corned
beef.

It is generally thought that there is no
cure for stoutness, because the usual treatments
only confine themselves to combating single
symptoms instead of attacking the root of the
disease. Pyrolene Pellets remove not only the
superfluous fat, but also the internal deposits of
fat which hinder the action of the heart and lungs.
We advise a trial. Pyrolene Pellets improve the
breathing, give the heart freedom, and enable the

to the rescue when my doctors and ! alii
other remedies had failed. One doctor
pronounced it scrofula, the other eczemas.-
The little one was one solid sore, wiffr
scales and scabs from head to foot, when
I started using Cuticura Soap and Oint--
ment. The result was wonderful, and!
now my baby’s face and body are smooth'
and clear.” (signed) Mrs. Mattie Shaffer.
THE DUTY OF MOTHERS
At the First Sign of Disfiguring
Humours Is to Use Cuticura
the Great Skin Cure
Every child born into the world with
an inherited tendency to torturing, dis-
figuring humours of the Skin and Scalp,
becomes an object of the most tender
solicitude, not only because of its suffer-
ing, but because of the dreadful fear that
the disfiguration is to be lifelong and
mar its future happiness and prosperity.
Hence it becomes the duty of mothers of
such afflicted children to acquaint them-
selves with the best, the purest, and most
effective treatment available, viz.: the
Cuticura Treatment, consisting of warm
baths with Cuticura Soap, and gentle
anointings with Cuticura Ointment, the
great Skin Cure, and purest and sweetest
of emollients. Cures made in childhood
are speedy, permanent, and economical.
Cuticura Soap, Ointment, and Pill., are «>ld throughout the
world. Depots: London, 27 CharterhouseBq.; lVris.fi Rue de

B®“Send for 11 How to Cure Disfiguring Humouift”
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 2, 1905.
Mr Dear Yarrie,—
Miss Talbot—niece of Victorian Gov. Reggie-
shipped for Europe last Tuesday as quietly as she
came. She made no pals in Toorak, but clung
close to her cold lengthy relatives throughout the
visit.
Prince Ferdinand Umberto, expected here
as a visitor shortly, is a cousin of the Due
of the Abruzzi, and comes of the most com-
plicated and inter-marrying stock ever raised by
royal Italy. If his tastes run on Abruzzi lines,
there’s a good time ahead for any notably beau-
tiful barmaid who happens to encounter him.
Dame Forrest comes back to Melbourne in the
train of the Gov.-Gen., and Bigjohn himself goes
to the Sainted City to meet her. All the Federal
dames snort at “the Westralian busybody’s for-
ward tactics.” But the Forrests do not care a jot
what is said. They just hustle steadily ahead.
The new Commonwealth G.-G. caddy joins his
chief at Fremantle. He comes with a hyphen and
a brave bachelor record. By the time all the aides
gather round the little G.-G., not a vestige of the
mighty atom will be seen. There are some advan-
tages about that; his Ex. may be reported as being
present at a show when the public have really only
viewed his bodyguard, who are really not sur-
rounding him at all but surrounding nothing,
while he is having a quiet snooze at home. That
would be a step towards the ultimate development
of the G.-G. as a purely mythical functionary.
The mayoral pasteboards for the dance of the
10th have as a tag the impressive intimation—“ to
meet their Excellencies the Governor-General and
Lady Northcote.”
The L. C. Mackinnons changed their plans
about returning early from the Cold Land, and
now loiter (bai Jove !) on Lord Clinton’s moors for
the season when the fowl finds himself suddenly
dead. Meanwhile the junior Lachlan Mackin-
nons spread the Scotch damask and the family
silver m their new Toorak residence for many
small and particular sprees. The Scotch bride
turns out to be a cheery hostess.
A bevy of the Tooraketty neighborhood gam-
bled a vay a recent afternoon, with Miss Dolly
Nicholson as ringleader. Bridge was the play, and
after a close run Miss Fairbairn and Miss Lang-
tree claimed the prizes.
A frivolous but gimlet-eyed dame is showing
a fine neck-pendant as the result of her bridge-
winnings for this year. All the cats of her
acquaintance are saying unkind things of her
“marvellous run of luck.” “I win now and
again,” says one fair dame, “but it all goes in
buying fancy socks or hair restorer for Fred, to
propitiate the brute. It’s the only way to meet
nis objections.”
Bridge may have its evils, but a gay he-butter-
fly has unearthed one of its virtues. The bridge
maniacs have no time for wicked philanderings,
and the men are out of it. It is the one sport at
which the trailing sex is sufficient unto itself.
A well-known bachelor here has been given
occasion to remember the fable of the Arab, his
Camel, and the Cold Night. He “flats” in
Collins-street, and from his sitting-room a dear
little balcony branches out. Fellow flat-dwellers
in the same building dropped into the habit of
begging leave to take the air on this convenient
spot. Some she-flatters heard of the bachelor’s
amiability, and drifted out by his leave on the
same healthful mission. Soon they took complete
possession, and the lawful tenant was too shy to
intrude. One day, coming home early from toil,
he hoped that none of the aggressive creatures
would be holding his balcony against him, peeped,
and was horrified to see—not any lounging females,
but a high line of long lace stockings flapping in
the breeze before the upward gazers of Collins-
street. Then he gave notice to leave the building.
Inquiries were made by the caretaker, and subse-
quently the bachelor was prevailed upon to with-
draw his notice to quit on the understanding that
the she-flatters withdrew their stockings and the
clothes-line and themselves from the balcony.
Mrs. Everard Browne keeps on killing the fatted
calf for her spouse. He has been back from his
globe-trot quite a month or two, but the delusion
of a fresh arrival is maintained, and the slaughter
of the calf continues. A feeling begins to prevail
that if the calf is killed much oftener it will soon
be dead.
Miss M’Carron, a daughter of the late printer,
revolves in a minuetting train at the Princess just
now. She experienced the break-down of a pro-
posed matrimonial alliance, and since then has
been sampling the joys and troubles of stage life
with the Knight-Jeffries Co. She’s of the cameo
type, pretty as a living picture.
The local detachment of the Australian Field
Artillery has scattered pasteboards for a final
military dance. All the Brass-and-Braid hops of
the season went off gleefully, and with consider-
able dash, because all the prettiest polka-trippers
hereabouts rolled up in gay competitive chiffons.
The Talbottles turned up to the Stirling matinee
with friendly intentions to admire the returned
warbler at all vocal costs. After the final song
they made a detour to the wings and purred over
the singer. After that the straight pair, backed
by an uncomplaining caddie, stalked off to talk
Epilepsy Colony funds to a set of Toorak Jellybys.
The untiring Austral Salon once again put
forth its gentle paw in greeting to a returned
singer last week. This time the paw was extended
to Miss Maggie Stirling. The Salon must be very
tired by now. It has sent away hundreds' with
trophies and good wishes, and it has cooed with ever-
ready gladness over the return of quite ninety-nine
singers who need not have journeyed so far as
Europe to train the top C that wasn’t worth
while. Perhaps the worst shock the good-natured
Salon ever received was the speech delivered by
one vinegary little penwoman two or three years
ago. The snuffy one expressed her joy at leaving
Melbourne, and very defiantly stated that she left
without a shadow of regret, and hoped never to
come back.
Musicians regard with increasing alarm and
disgust the many affluent girls who are training
their vocal notes in the way melodious. The
fashionable tootler was an asset in the eyes of the
professionals a while back—when the profession
was teaching her to toot; but the result of the
top 0 cult was not anticipated. Now it is mani-
fest. The Toorak warblers croon lullabies and
plantation ditties for their friends at entertain-
ments, and the hired song is dispensed with. Any
high-toned hostess can rally up her girl chums to
supply melody for her At Home, and the pro-
fessional of the exacting appetite and the fee
ceases to be a necessary part of the scheme of
things.
The cat hobby must have reached the stage of
lunacy in the Cold Country. In a recent Field,
I came across an answer to a catty correspondent
advising her not to use her own brush on pussy’s
diseased coat, as that might cause the parasite
trouble that affected the cat to spread to the
owner.
Prefer Bert turned out to the Findon Harriers’
meeting, the oilier Saturday, in the State motor.
He wore his shiny top-piece and Sunday flogger,
and the dust was bad ; so he landed at the
Moonee Valley course looking like a comic baker
who had been rolling in the flour-bin.
Fancy hops for kiddies have had a disastrous
effect. Youngsters of studious habits have caught
the polka craze and throw syntax to the winds
when there’s a chance of a festive fling in fancy
rig. Several school mistresses are protesting
against such ball-room dissipation, and in one or
two instances a personal appeal has been made to
intending hostesses without success. So a consulta-
tion of pedagogues is mooted to wrestle with the
evil of the hop.
The T. H. Paynes have a new motor at which
all the small brown dogs in the Toorak neighbor-
hood yelp viciously. The car is a gorgeous one
with many silver gleamings about the body, and
looks like Aladdin’s lamp in a hurry. It is guaranteed
to preserve its terrible pace in the teeth of a gale
and to be a calm composed vehicle no matter how
serious the emergency.
An unusual incident marred some rather fine
bridal proceedings a few weeks ago. The ’groom
drank his own health so often, and responded to
so many flattering toasts, that he became totally
unconscious of the blushing bride by his side and
his festive friends in general. He refused to
budge from the table of rejoicing, and could not
be induced to change his wedding garment for his
travelling kit. The bride wept, and the honey-
moon trip had to be postponed.
It was worth Mrs. J. Fisken’s while to go down
before an attack of bronchitis for a few weeks to
enjoy evidences of the widespread concern as to
her bill of health. ’Phone messages arrived by
the hundred, and floral attentions were served up
with the pasteboard of inquiry day after day.
Complete recovery was hailed with applause.
Mrs. Fisken has been far more popular since her
marriage than when, as the wealthy widow
M'Caughey, she carried things off with a high
hand, and made many of the frilly ones snort. A
bland, cheerful hubby is the reason of such popu-
larity.
Suburban Mayors and Mayoresses are doing
well out of this year’s revelry. After one return
hop a sufficient sum remained to purchase a grand
diamond jewel for the Worshipess, and a collar
stud or something for himself. Only in two
municipalities did the Mayors refuse the return
hop and gewgaw.
Some scrupulous dames in a big hostelry ob-
jected to certain busty portraits of a theatrical star
being displayed all over the place. The manager
refused to cast them aside, and the dames pro-
bably are now wearing winkers to shut out sight
of the obnoxious articles.
Mrs. Watson, one of the frilliest of frockers,
tried matrimony a second time last Wednesday,
and had a limited but choice spree at the Grand
after the marriage. Her groom bears the Greek
name of Lazarus, and has large interests in the
big up-country town of quartz and voices. The
little dame’s bridal turn-out was a dream of shell-
like chiffon with Irish crochet laid on plain over
the most attractive contours. A lovely toque of
small dimensions went with the toilette. Nothing
neater has been seen in this State for a long time.
I hear of a champion mean man. The girl of
his heart is blessed with a heavy purse. When
the ring of approval came to be discussed, he
begged her, as a great, dazzling, blinding compli-
ment, to accept his late mammy’s dress ring for
the pledge of their betrothal. Hather dubious of
the intended flattery, she accepted. Then play-
fully he started to borrow her tram-tickets. In
the fullness of her newly-engaged heart, she
regarded this as one of the intimate blandishments
of love. Later, he hinted for a gift of the new
chiffon ties. Still dazzled, she spent her sus-
pender-money pn the gift. But when accompany-
ing her to kirk, one Sabbath, he tenderly asked
her if she had any small change to loan out for the
soup-plate that receives the widow’s mite and the
bachelor’s button, she waxed indignant. Now the
engagement is cried off. _ “To support a man
after marriage is not a circumstance,” says this
heiress, “to paying for a lover’s halo on the
strength of his departed mother’s dress ring.”
The theatrical engagement that leads on to
wedlock is not common, but that of Claude
Bantoclc is one to date. Early last week the
criers were out proclaiming the fact to the
town and the newspapers. Claude, it seems, is
the youngest hope of Dr. Granville Bantock, of
Upper Hamilton Terrace, London, and the
charmer of his choice, Miss Ada May Cale, a
Ballarat native.
The conveniences of life for a flutterer are on
the increase. Boudoirs are being opened up
where one can be thoroughly and freshly crimped
and powder-dusted for a trifle. One goes into a
renovating parlor looking greasy, dusty, limp,
One reappears the very glass of fashion.
The thatch has been brilliantined and trimmed,
the complexion renewed, the hat adjusted, the
veil hoisted to the stylish height—in short, the
whole feminine gear set trim and taut. The she
club isn’t in it with a boudoir that effects all this
m ten minutes.
Mrs. Norman Menzies is said to be hankering
after the footlights again. They all do. On a
Saturday night she hangs over them from her box
like a guileless, sublimely unconscious school-girl,
getting almost within range of the lime. Her idea
is to skip to the front in “ Yeronique,” a musical
farce that she has been studying for more than
drawing-room purposes. The Menzies are not
objecting. Their Dolly, they think, can do
no wrong. So well is she beloved.
The Ladies’ Work Association had all Toorak
stalling 1 it at the Saturday Bazaar, ready, as your
Dan O’Connor would say, for their work of “ non-
felonious robbery under the most lovely of
ar-r-rums.” They were in white muslin rigs and
mostly paper hats. Miss Cumming wore a hat
the size of a duck-egg above her pert face. Miss
Atherton was too severely laundered to look as
huggable as usual. Miss Fairbairn and Miss
Dimple Anderson shared the cake for the most
spotless and summery turn-out. Some of the white-
decked took to furs and cloaks, for the, breezes
round the hall were eager and nipping. Miss
Lesly Madden, as the cashier, must have had her
fingers pinked and polished at frequent intervals,
for at the very end of the show they were the
admiration of all who dealt with her in small
change. The Chomleys, the Brodribbs, and the
Armytages gurgled and fussed round their particu-
lar domains with any amount of starchy frill,
while the onlookers gaped on their antics.
The commotion at the coming of the Stonington
Dame to that Needlework Bazaar was wild. At
the very moment she was climbing the Town Hall
steps with a pink Aide in tow, the presentation
orchids couldn’t be found. Everybody tore round
for the missing blooms. At the 59th second of
the last minute Mrs. Harper clutched the
bouquet from its hiding-place and bounced
to the door brandishing the vegetables in
her excited paw. They were thrust on the
cafcn Ex. before she could protest any.
Then, in the stress of kow-tow, someone caught
the Talbottle dame by her haughty shoulders and
swung her round —to receive the gushful smile of
an over looked matron. And for the rest of the
afternoon her Ex. wore a chilled look of amaze-
ment.
A swagger widower, whose crepe-band has not
braved the breeze for any length of time, is look-
ing round again. Up to the present, most of his
attentions have been served up to a dame whose
own weeds are a shade worn by time. The widow
in question has much wool-wealth and a figure
more youthful than her top-tier.
Big breezy Miss Clara Clifton is resting during
“The Cingalee” season by taking any amount of
pedestrian and equestrian exercise. She has a
big chestnut, and rides into the regions of gums
and wattles whenever the weather is smiling.
Miss Muriel Cumming sees the race carnival
out, then goes to her gorgeous sister in Fog City.
The Rupertswood dame has always been a trump
to her people and a right bower to the Cumming
girls.
Talma, the lady who is a valuable distraction
and aid to the magicians at Rickards’, is 'the most
vital spark that ever adorned an illusion. She
flashes on and off the stage during the whole of
the amazing turn, talking, laughing, cake-walking,
in glistening serpentine raiment and contagious
good-humor. Her own turn of coin spinning and
minting while you wait is dexterously executed.
Further incitement is given the A.N.A. song
and recitation trophy-struggler by having his or
her photograph published and scattered broad-
cast. But the youth who elocuted “Casabianca”
in his salad days may live to regret it, and will
then be haunted by camera-proof of his early
foolishness. It will be almost as embarrassing as
having preserved against you a biscuit-picture
showing your nude babyhood set out on a shell,
like an extra large joint on a very small dish.
The wealthy widow of Councillor Tom Fogarty
embarked by the Himalaya for London last week.
One of the objects of the large dame’s visit is to
collect cats and dogs of high degree from ducal
and other noble fanciers. Some Pomeranians are
to be selected from an aristocratic doggery, and
Lady Marcus Beresford’s corner in cats is to be
encroached upon for the pussy fancier of the
Fogarty family. The late Councillor Fogarty
made his wealth in the wholesale grocery line and
hoarded it carefully, which fact enables his widow
to have a pretty taste in cats.
The leading epicure of this State pronounced,
on returning from a 27th jaunt over the world,
that it becomes a dear joy of the palate to taste
meat, fruit, and vegetables as raised in Australia
after the kind of stuff served up in the crack cafes
of the earth. Geelong asparagus in the opinion
of this man is the finest raised in the world.
The latest poodles to parade the block are to be
seen in green art covers—like the chintz coming
into vogue for morning-rooms. A St. Kilda-road
Miss of uncertain age takes a pair of the chintz-
covered poodles for a promenade on fine mornings.
Another who drives a Victoria takes a linen-
covered cushion for herself, and leaves a maize
satin one, with wisteria delicately trailed thereon
in the finest silk thread, to the thing of bark and
bite. And the man in the street who hasn’t a
whole coat, or a cushion, or a pair of sound boots
to call his own, looks on in jaundiced disgust.
Foremost to the cry of “ Tally-ho ” dash Miss
Alison Fairbairn and Miss Dolly Nicholson. The
pair have the showiest mounts of the season, the
trimmest figures, the sportiest boxers, and most
slap-dash coats. The best she-sport going
puts her equipment first among the joys of the
chase. Only when certain of looking trim and
taut and right in the picture does she give her
thoughts to the hounds and the excitement of a
gallop through bracken and gorse.
The loss of the Loch Vennachar brings back
memories of two other lost Loch liners—the Loch
Sloy, wrecked near Cape Borda, in April, ’99, and
the Loch Ard, whose tragedy happened over a score
of years ago. The sole survivors of the latter were
apprentice Tom Pearce and Miss Carmichael,
whom Pearce saved at great personal risk. Now
Pearce’s son, an apprentice, has gone down in the
Vennachar, almost within cry of his brother
Robert, an apprentice on the Loch Etive, now
lying at Williamstown (Vic.). From the Loch
Sloy three sailors and a passenger scrambled on to
the iron-bound coast, and subsisted anyhow till,
a fortnight later, one of them staggered into the
house of a bush settler. The settler hastily orga-
nised a search party, and succeeded in saving the
other two sailors, though the passenger was dead
when found.
There is a good deal of wrangling in reference
to the Government House garden fete at Adelaide
—at least so a correspondent informs me. The
British Nurses’ Association, one of the institu-
tions that is to benefit by the fete, desired to draw
out of it, but Lady Le Hunte requested that it
should remain in, adding “ When a request comes
from Government House, it is really a command.”
The latest arrangement is that all articles not sold
at the fete shall be distributed to charities as Lady
Le Hunte sees fit, and shall be distributed as
“gifts from Government House ” ! Stall-holders
say that, under these circumstances, there will be
very few unsold articles.
Miss Florence Hamer—the footlighter of the
eyes—has a liking for the Inky Way. All day
long she plies a grey goose-quill with great
industry. Members of the co. are puzzled as to the
subject. Some say she is preparing a seven-act
domestic farce, and others that she is in the throes
of a long jeremaid on the drama as it is played bv
the misleading people of the day.
Yours, TRYPHRNA.
A cheeky thing is the North Pole Road at
Keilor (Victoria).
Mr. Byron Brown has been giving the
Maoriland public some information as to how
Freetrade in kerosene raised the price to the
consumer:—
When the duty of 6d. per gallon was taken off kerosene
it was reckoned that the price of 9Jd. per gallon would
lu » ”*?• That was the case for about a month, but
then Mr. J. D. Rockefeller got wind of the alteration and
took steps to reap the benefit. Soon the price went up
and up, until now the quotation is 10fd. per gallon.
Last year M.L. imported 4,420,000 gallons of kerosene,
and Rockefeller is making out of the people £110,512 by
comparison with the returns when the duty was in force.
A few days ago an Adelaide horse-tram
ran over and killed an old man. Ifc was stated by
the driver at the inquest that the vehicle was
travelling at about three miles an hour when the
aged me got in the road. And yet the driver was
not cautioned for furious driving, like Messala in
the chariot race, or Jehu, the son of Nimshi, who
arrived at Jezreel with his back hair streaming in
the wind.
Melbourne Age remarks that the deter*
mination of his parents to remove from the Loch
Vennachar, recently lost off Kangaroo Island
(S.A.), a lad who recently completed his appren-
ticeship “ would appear to have been arrived at
by Providential intervention.” Is one to under*
stand that the Age’s Providence also intervened
to cause the men who remained on the vessel to be
drowned ?
“1.K.”: It is alleged that some dis-
satisfied subscribers intend taking action to test
the legality of Melbourne Hospital committee’s
action in voting £5O, intended for charitable
purposes, to glorify their own crawlsome instincts
m gaining the title “Royal.” In future, this
body will be known as the Melbourne Hospittle
committee.
Combining business with pleasure, Vic.
Premier Bent opened theßallaratSouth-street com-
petitions, got a verse of alleged comic song off his
chest, and then strolled round and bought two
million bricks for the State at 295. a thousand.
His just-signed agreement with the Brick Com-
bine allows him to buy anywhere over 30 miles
from Melbourne, but as the aforesaid combine has
the sole right to supply the 4,000,000 bricks
required for the new station, everybody is won-
dering what Thomas is going to do with this
Ballarat purchase. It is but a week since Thomas
and Tory McKetchup were patting each other on
the back for having got the Combine’s bricks at
355. Now it appears they could have got them at
295. all the time.
An inventive genius in Melbourne is
a PPlymg for a patent for a contrivance whereby
wheels are fitted to the human form in a manner
that will wipe out the bicycle in all its shapes as a
means of conveying mankind up and down the
face of the earth. The method of connecting the
man and the wheels is said to be quite simple, and
the man’s weight is to do the rest; therefore the
heavier the man the greater is to be the velocity,
and when Bent starts nothing in all Australia
will be able to overtake him, except George Reid
and Arthur Morgan. Thus does the perpetual
motion craze rise from its grave for the
1,197,824,813,946,218 th time.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Australian postal revenue would look up
if a more effective check were kept on the regis-
tration of newspapers. Adelaide Stock and
Station Journal, for example, is purely a circu-
lar of stock agents’ weekly sales with no right to
newspaper privileges; and there are many such
publications in the Commonwealth.
If N.S.W. Parliament retains in the
Liquor Bill the clause which provides for fining
a publican who serves a “prohibited” person, it
should, in fair play, provide that the prohibited
person shall wear a badge. The mere record of
a name (often Smith) on a list is not enough ; the
prohibited person will use other names, and go to
publicans who don’t know him.
Rep. Robinson wishes the Australian
Government to issue as a Parliamentary paper a
digest of the Canadian laws relating to immigra-
tion which, he contends, are more liberal than
those of Australia. If Robinson really wants the
public to be enlightened as to why Canada is pre-
ferred to Australia by the emigrant, let him call
for a digest of the Canadian tariff. He will find
the whole story there,
South African war medals were inquired
after in the House of Reps., the other night, by
Paddy Glynn, the S. Australian Demosthenes.
It appears that they are not in great demand.
In fact the honor is so little appreciated by those
to whom it is due, that the authorities have still
about a peck of the base metal gauds on hand and
unclaimed, and it is thinking of charging storage
on them.
Australia is now entertaining as a visitor
Dr. F. Otake, director of a Jap. woollen mill.
He cames to Australia to see about buying wool
which will be made up in Jap. mills by workers
paid from 6d. to 9d. per day, and then, in part, be
re exported to Australia —where it should have
been made up in the first instance by workers
earning from 6s. to 9s. a day ; and would be, if
Australia had a sane fiscal system.
In many centres the post-office is not run
by the Government directly, but is sub-let to a
storekeeper, and there have been several instances
cited of sweating under this system. It is the
duty of the Australian Government to see that
every postal employee is honestly and decently
paid, and it cannot “ contract out ” of this respon-
sibility. Close supervision should be exercised
over the working of contract post-offices.
The usual crop of suggestions had sprung
up around a clause of the Shearers’ Accommoda-
tion Bill, in the S. Aus. Assembly. “ I wish you
would let this clause through just as it is—Mr.
Kingston drafted it for me,” said Premier Price.
And promptly every suggested amendment was
withdrawn, and the clause was adopted exactly as
it stood. Then the House cheered.. A small
thing, but a unique tribute of trust and affection.
From “Gr. Ell”:
Our variegated brother in the Holy City threatens to
emulate the worm that is walked upon. A choice collec-
tion of turbans and pigtails has held a meeting in the
vicinity of Light-square and formed an ■“ Asiatic League.”
The precise objects of the association weie not stated, but
Mr. Chumbuddy Earn said that they had submitted
quietly to repressive legislation long enough and “ the
time had come.” Messrs. Curree Singh, Bad Ehum, One
Sing and other conservative gentlemen made various
sounds in support, and the meeting closed amidst much
enthusiasm and smell. It is believed that the new society
will be affiliated with the National Ass and Parasitic
Producers’ Union, and will vigorously co-operate with
these organisations in their efforts.
A recent Sydney 'Telegraph article,
written with tears in the inkpot, asserts that, if
Australia were not so hostile to colored immi-
grants, quite a lot of Chinese students might come
here, and spend £1 a week -each in the country.
This loss is terrible. If we opened our ports, and
let in 1000 Chinese students, and if they spent £1
a week here, that would be £52,000 a -year ex-
pended in the country, equal to 3d. per inhabitant
per annum. N.S.Wi alone loses more than twice
that amount by importing the one small item of
bags and sacks instead of making them locally, as
a sane and energetic community should do.
It says a lot for the mess that ex-Premier
Daglish made of things during the brief period
that Labor was in office in Westralia, that when
Premier Bason and his new Tory colleagues went
up for re-election each one of them was returned
by a larger majority over his Labor opponent
than he achieved at last general election. If
Daglish had been a Kidston or a Price he would
have captured Rason’s seat instead of losing his
own portfolio.
Rason, the new Premier and Treasurer of
Westralia, after announcing in a brisk, cheerful
way that the estimates showed a deficit of £323,000,
said that his predecessors had proposed taxation
to reduce it. But as the proposed tax would only
bring in £31,000 during this year, he wouldn’t
have it—he would rather have nothing than
£31,000. Which also apparently means that
Rason would rather have a deficit of £323,000
than one of £292,000 any day.
Proposed now that the N.S.W. Govern-
ment should spend half a million in rescuing from
the clutch of land monopoly, the Peel River
estate. But why not make half a million by
doing so? A stiff progressive land-tax, with a
50 per cent, surtax on absentee-owned holdings,
would force the Peel River and other such estates
into use, and at the same time bring in revenue.
Besides their economic dishonesty and extrava-
fance, partial resumptions with cash will always
e open to suspicion of corruption and land
agency.
As a reason why Westralia should live on
loans instead of revenue, Rason, its new Premier,
declares proudly that it is the richest and best
State of the Commonwealth. This is good
aboriginal logic. The bigger and stronger the
nigger, the less he carries himself, and the more
he makes his gin carry. And Rason proposes to
run the country on the lines of our despised and
shiftless black brother Bill. The only difference
between black brother Bill and Rason is that Bill
throws his load to the lubra ; Rason throws his to
the piccaninny.
A WILD GOOSE CHASE.
Bichard Edwards., member for Oxley (Q.),
should., on his performances, be elected leader of
(the Stinking Fish party. He was in Japan a few
months ago, and while there a perky Jap, who
evidently subscribes to the Argus, asked him,
“What about the six hatters?” This sank deep
into the soul of Edwards, and when he spoke in
the Australian Parliament, the other evening, he
attacked the Immigration Restriction Act with
surprising fury. His remarks occupy 35 columns
of Hansard, and they are thickly sprinkled with
references to six hatters, six potters, Mrs. Tozer s
maid, and somebody else’s groom. And Edwards
actually voted himself for the very clause —the
contract clause—which he now curses.
No political party calling itself “ national ”
ever occupied a much meaner position than the
Foreign-trade party in Federal politics. Its head
and front, its elected leader, the representative of
its political existence, declines to represent it in
Parliament except at times when his private
business permits. Fora Prime Minister s salary
he will represent it; he has done so ; but he will
not lead his party as an Opposition on a mem-
ber’s allowance of £4OO, and his party is content
to do with odds and ends of his spare time rather
than subscribe as much as will satisfy his
demands. And while things are thus, the so-
called leader and his party pose _ as the only
patriotic and self-sacrificing politicians in the
Commonwealth.
In N.S.W. the country person appears to
have a quite incurable idea that he shouldn’t pay
for his own roads like the city person, but should
loaf and cadge for them on the loan funds or on
the general community. Therefore the Local
Goverment Bill is met at every stage by the cry
of Twadded, M.L.A., that the country districts
want to be quite sure —dead sure —that it wi l
mean no t ixation, and by the yelp of Nielsen or
Griffith who want to know “why people should
have Local Government shoved down their
throats."’ It is questionable if two candidates
h ive been returned to N.S.W. Assembly in the
la t 40 years who weren’t elected on the under-
sti iding that they were just perishing for Local
' Government,-but apparently most of them didn’t
mean it.
Mr. John Meagher, the medieval, op-
posing the Smoke Nuisances Bill in N.S.VV.
Legislative Council: —
It was Scripturally announced that where TherewM
fire there must be smoke ; therefore, the present would
have been an absurd Bill to have passed.
It would be interesting to know where Meagher
gets his Scripture from. This looks like public-
house Scripture—not the Bible variety.
The International Harvester Trust having
attempted to extend its operations to Maoriland,
to the prejudice of local manufacturers of agricul-
tural machinery, Seddon promptly promised .Par-
liamentary intervention to “prevent the trust
injuring a promising industry in the State and
throwing out of employment a large body ot
skilled workmen.” There is no concession to the
Foreign-trade fad about Seddon. He votes for
Maoriland industry every time.
Half the time of the average commercial
man seems to be spent in faking some cheap or
fraudulent substitute for a genuine article of food.
The other day Customs Minister Lyne ukased
that henceforth “koffee” should pay the same
duty as coffee. This vile substitute for an honest
beverage is prepared from wheat, barley, and rye
—burnt grain, in fact. When Australia really
decides to jump on commercial immorality it will
levy a treble duty on such messes.
One Sydney morning paper calculates that
the N.S.W. Government, on the terms of its con-
tract with the Lithgow ironworks, will pay away
£26,661 to establish a new iron, industry ; the other
estimates the payment at nearly £46,000. The
amount, whatever it is* will be spread over a num-
ber of years, so it doesn’t come to very much per
annum ; still the Freetrade conscience is a good
deal broken up over it. N.S.W. pays over
£1,000,000 a year in reduced railway rates to keep
the “great primary industry” of agriculture afloat,
but that is a different thing. Agriculture is the
blessed old “backbone of the country’’—though,
on the figures, it looks more like a parasite than a
bone.
Premier Price promises, if he retains office
for a year, that Adelaide shall have electric trams.
Presumably he means to alter the present ridicu-
lous Act, which prohibits the Government from
carrying out the work of electrification, and only
authorises it to buy the trams from the present
syndicate and then lease them to a new syndicate.
The alleged supporters of Bent in the Yic.
Assembly are just about as weariful and
obstreperous as the Federal Opposition. The
passage of the Milk Supervision Bill has become
so; gradual that it now averages about one and a
half clauses a day ; in fact, without the help of
the Opposition Swinburne would not get his bill
through at all. The education of the farmer and
the improvement of his herds and dairies will not
only advantage the community generally but will
also yield a huge profit to the farmer himself ; but
the farmer steadfastly refuses to be washed—at
least, his special representatives say he does.
The rejection by iST.S. W. Legislative
Council of the Bill which was to re-christen the
suburb of St. Peters as “ Brampton 1 ’ has done
more to convince the people of that brickmaking
locality that one House is quite enough in a State
Parliament than the Council’s half century of
opposition to democratic measures. St. Peters
Mayor Spackman thus rises to the situation and
rages at large :
If the Upper House, which in no way represented the
people, treated them thus ... it would be necessary to
takeaction. It would then be the duty of the people to rise
and demand that their wishes should not be thwarted by
an irresponsible', non-elective body.
The “struggling settler” in N.S.W., in
addition to all the aids and bonuses he now
receives, is to be further subsidised by being
supplied with rabbit-proof wire-netting on credit.
The best subsidy the struggling settler could
receive would be the establishment of a dozen
manufacturing towns in different parts of the
State, so that he might have a market for his pro-
duce close at hand, instead of having to send most
of it to Sydney or to England; and the best
remedy for the rabbit is population. But N.S.W.
votes against both these things, and prefers to buy
wire netting with borrowed money to fence in a
Freetrade wilderness.
The Opposition in the Australian Parlia-
ment has fought savagely against the provisions
of the Commerce Bill for securing the honest
branding of exports. They want freedom of ex-
port—for stinking fish yarns, stinking butter and
bad apples. And this in the interests of the pro-
ducer ! As a matter of fact, there is no measure
which would better help the honest producer than
an Act which subjected every item of export to
rigid supervision. That would, in a very short
time, make the word Australian mean “prime
quality ” in all the markets of the world.
“This is one of the most undesirable
immigrants you could possibly find, 1 ’ said Mel-
bourne magistrate Panton lately, referring to an
expressionless-looking German who had been sent
out to the care of the head of a big foreign
firm in Melbourne, and, getting a billet at £1 a
week, had straightway set out to rob his em-
ployers. Panton didn’t say anything about the
big man who got him the billet, or the other firm
which employed him at £1 a week; yet he was
probably quite right about the immigrant himself.
America would have promptly returned him
whence he came—as being a pauper and a person
with a criminal countenance —but what sort of a
noise would the Stinking Fish press have made
had the Australian Customs officers refused a
landing to this German?
That public misfortune, Tom Mann, is
again preaching his favorite remedy for lack of
employment—the cutting down of the working
day to six hours, so as to make the.little scrap of
employment go round, There is £30,000,000
worth of well-paid work per annum waiting to be
done even now in Australia if only this country
had the sense to shut down on needless iinpqrtg.
There is about £220,000,000 of debt to be paid
off. There are several dozen million acres of good
land to be put under cultivation as soon as the
land monopolist is got rid of. And Mann, the
undesirable immigrant and apostle of loafing, has
one remedy to propose for all evils—that Aus-
tralia should sleep, eat and declaim about its
“ chains” for 18hours a day six days in the week,
and all the 24 hours on the seventh day.
According to the Sydney daily papers of
Wednesday week, Mr. 0. Lane, the new Presi-
dent of the Baptist Union, said a lot of severe
things about the laws of the Commonwealth—this
among the rest: —
The legislation which committed to gaol the skilled
artisan who comes to our shores to teach us more intelli-
gent methods, lest he should have some share in our pro-
sperity. . .was evidence of self and self-interest which must
be conquered before we could enter upon the path of true
progress.
This paper would like to ask Mr. C. Lane if he
was correctly reported in the above statement,
and, if so, who was the skilled artisan who came
to our shores to teach us more intelligent
methods,” and who was committed to gaol ? For
if he did say what the Sydney Telegraph charges
him with, and unless he can point to some artisan
that this paper doesn’t remember, he is
an unpatriotic slanderer, and anything but an
ornament to the Baptist community.
One of the most humorous incidents —if it
hadn’t the possibilities of tragedy in it—in con-
nection with Booth’s proposed export of 5000
families, is the announcement that Westralia is
ready to receive its parcel now. Poor old Booth,
who evidently thinks all land is the same, told a
Daily Mail person that he had been offered
20,000 acres of “lovely land, in Westralia, at &.
an acre.’' “It has a river running through it,”
said Booth, joyfully, and he went on to picture
the delight of the new settlers when they peached
this garden of Eden. It is only a few month®
since several Victorian farmers, lured by the state-
ments of a paid agent from Westralia, went across
to take up land ; and, after an exhaustive search,
came back declaring that there were only
about 1000 acres of decent agricultural soil in
the whole State, and that John Forrest’s friends
at Bunbury had hold of that, and had held it for
50 years or so.
After an absence of nearly a month,
George Reid turned up again in the House of
Reprehensibles las,t week. When the round,
stout man with the .eyeglass returns to the House
after an interval there is always the same weary
old programme. The large individual stands at
the table, and in a loud, high-pitched voice makes
a general mention of everything that happened
while he was away, and runs querulously through
all the old myths and legends that have been
exploited by the Tory press for a year. The bony
spectre of Anti-Socialism, the draggled old
stuffed dummy of Constitutional Government, are
the leaders of a two-hour procession wherein the
Six Hatters grin, and the Six Potters gape, and,
the Ticket-of-leave-man rears his dusty head, ror
two hours he shrieks and perspires, while Johnson
and Williemotor Kelly cheer wildly. Then the
talky hero, damp and steaming, is led forth from
the chamber and given a large bottle of lemonade,
and he vanishes for the rest of the sitting.
Sydney papers and politicians had hardly
finished expressing their indignation at the state-
ment of Prime Minister Dealtin, that the bad
land laws of the States were one great obstacle to
immigration, when three things happened : (1) It
was announced in the S.M. Herald and lele-
graph that a number of farmers were leaving
northern N.S.W. for Chili because, though there
is still good State land in the northern district,
the lazy, wretched and incompetent Administra-
tion won’t make it available, nor will it force the
great private estates into the market; (2 ) five
farms—the largest only 394 acres—were thrown
open for selection at Dubbo, and there were 660
applications for them ; (3) Premier Carruthers
decided that the best he could do for the immi-
grants he is inviting from England is to send them
out to the Pilliga scrub, about 450 miles from
Sydney, far away from markets, away from rail-
ways, on the edge of the Great Drought, an,d
half-a-mile from perdition. This is mostly a bar-
ren region. It depends on the chance of artesian
water being found, and when the artesian water
is found it is often so loaded with mineral that it
kills all vegetation.

“Speaking at Seymour, Mr. Graham, M.L.A., said he
was hoping that something would come along to make
the Federal Parliament mend its ways. It not, he felt
certain that something would arrive to dissolve the
union.” —Melbourne Age.
Thus an angry M.L. A. takes his unlamented way
To found a rival Commonwealth of one,
And by filling up each groove, for a time should make it
prove
The best-conducted country ’neath the sun ;
He’ll be Premier and porter, P.M., and letter-sorter,
And tax himself to pay himself the pelf
Allotted him by him ; but his quaint secession whim
Soon will make him try seceshing from himself!
Then as private M.L.A. he’ll complain, in just the way
That he is now complaining hereabouts,
That as Minister his daring drives him almost to despair-
ing,
And his recklessness doth fill himself with doubts ;
And he’ll rise in Opposition to condemn his own position,
And tell him he’ll secede and make him rue it,
And as Ministerialist he’ll reply, “ You won’t be missed !
Then he’ll try to leave himself. But can he do it ?

Recent Adelaide Medical Congress was
able to see at A. M. Bickford and Son’s establish-
ment proof that the Australian can manufacture,
if given a chance. That firm showed several
locally made surgical instruments including a
“ Glover’s crutch ” —a very intricate affair.
Lawyer Jellicoe, of Maoriland, has been
explaining to the English press that Australia is
losing population, and that “the only State in
Australia prospering is N.S.W., thanks to the
statesmanship of Mr. Reid.” During the Reid
period (1894-1899) N.S.W. sent away about 1900
more people than it received. Jellicoe says in a
lofty way that Agent-General Coghlan, who
objects to some of his statements, “should first
inspect the official records,” but apparently
Jellicoe himself is not on speaking terms with the
official records.
In the case Rae v. Rae, N.S.W. Divorce
Court went rather against the common-sense con-
clusion from the facts. The Rae marriage was an
utter failure. The husband sought relief on the
ground of desertion, and seemed to have estab-
lished his case, but the Judge held that the wife’s
mental condition barred him from a remedy.
“ There was ample proof of mental derangement,
and of actions making it clear the unfortunate
woman was not always responsible for her
actions by reason of her mental condition.”
The theory of the divorce law is, or should be,
that when connubial relations are no longer possi-
ble, the marriage contract should be voidable on
the application of either party. At present insanity
is not a cause of divorce, for the reason that there
is a lingering trace of the old ecclesiastical law in the
idea that divorce is a “punishment” and it would
not be fair to “punish ” for insanity; but there is
no doubt that, with the growth of common-sense,
hopeless insanity will be recognised as as good a
reason for the dissolution of a marriage as the
death of one of the partners. It is death in a
sense-mental death. Meanwhile there is no
sense in stretching the law so as to make a
“mental derangement” have the same effect as
insanity. A very great number of women are
hysterical, and hysteria is a mental derangement
which it would be dangerous to recognise legally
as equivalent to insanity.
After all the bitter curses it has thrown at
the Labor party, S.M. Hekald, the other day,
printed this refreshing bit of truth from F. A. A.
Russell’s article, “ Australian Problems” :
It is difficult to see how any fair-minded man can with-
hold admiration for that great party. Anyone who
believes in that sound motto which, as Carlyle points out,
expresses the feeling in which all great revolutions have
had their national basis: “ The tools to the man who can
use them ” —anyone who believes in that motto must see
that it was inevitable and fitting that Labor should play
such a part in Australian legislation as it has done for the
last 10 years. The writer has no sympathy whatever for
the lay citizen who comfortably spends his evenings in an
armchair, behind a cigar and a long whisky and soda, and
curses the Labor party. Labor does not spend its even-
ings in inaction, but understands politics, organises, and
uses its vote. By virtue of energy and attention to prac-
tical affairs, the Labor party has enjoyed the confidence
of all its natural supporters ; and, having a large follow-
ing with clear and definite aims, well-disciplined, it has
been for some time past the most powerful and definite
factor in our politics. The leaders of the Party have
deserved well of their followers, nor ha.ve they deserved
ill of their country. No great financial scandals have
enmeshed the real leaders of Labor. Contrast the solidity
and perseverance and self-confidence of the Labor party
with the dissolution, apathy, and distrust prevalent in
other parties, and the spectacle is not pleasing. What
member of a Reform League in New South Wales puts
any trust in Mr. Carruthers ? Compared with Labor, all
other parties in Australia are sick, indefinite, and incom-
petent. j
“ D’Harum ” keeps an appointment:—
When in Sydney, a little .time back, I accidentally made
the acquaintance of a very charming girl, and arranged
to meet her, at the George-street corner of the G.P.0., at
8 o clock, one Thursday night. The Post-office, to me,
seemed to be the meeting-place of the majority of Sydney
couples. I stood on the steps and waited patiently for
my girl. Scores of fellows came along and were found by
scores of girls, but I waited on. I was new to Sydney,
friendliness of the ladies who passed quite
startled me. Though I had never been introduced to any
of .* he “) ( dor > fc remember seeing any of them before), they
said, Good night, dear,” stopped and talked to
me, and invited me to call. The idea of me going
to their homes without knowing their fathers or
mothers. I don’t know if there is anything taking
about me, but quite 30 said “Good night” tome. A
gul, with a feather in her hat as large as a good-sized
eagle, kept passing me there in the gloom, and gazing
into my face in a puzzled, inquiring sort of way. At
last she stopped and asked in a very bashful way, “ You
ain’t the bloke I ’ad t’ meet to-night, are yer?” I said I
thought not, whereat she observed she thought not too,
and confessed to me that she had mashed a bloke on a
Manly boat, and had arranged to meet him, but she had
forgotten his face because she had never got a good view
of it. I assured her that my open countenance was not
that of the bloke. During the next half-hour eight men
asked for matches, and 14 street arabs came begging
cigarette cards. I began to get angry at the girl not
turning up, and when a policeman who had passed and
repassed me almost 50 times, came by once more, winked
knowingly, and said, “ I don’t think she’ll come now, old
man,” I decided that Sydney girls are fickle, and that I
should henceforth shun them as I would one or two
serpents.

When somebody threw me fair and square.
But I “ passed ”in time—and who would care
For a rattling fall? We won that day
Finished the game with a goal to spare—
That was in ’BO. Throw it away !

Sydney’s last football flutter for the season was
the re-played finatfor the Gardiner Oup under Association
rules between the Balmain and Kozelle teams, which had
tied the previous Saturday in spite of 20 minutes’ extra
play. Both clubs put exactly the same men into the field
for the second tussle, and excitement ran high. Both
sides were nervous and over-anxious, still it was a great
game to watch. Rozelle attacked violently, the Balmain
goal-keeper fell in the act of saving, and Rozelle secured
the leather again and shot a goal. This was followed by
frenzied attacks by Balmain, but the defence was sound,
and the first half ended without the score being altered by
either side. The second half found Balmain attacking
more furiously than ever. Play raged all over the ground,
back and forwards, and then, out of a sudden mix-up,
Balmain equalised the score. Flushed with this success, it
attacked again from the kick-off. Rozelle, momentarily
dejected, did not rise to the occasion, and before it had
time to think, Balmain had shot another goal amidst tre-
mendous excitement. Then Rozelle pulled itself together
and played the game of its life ; but Balmain struggled as
though its immortal soul was in danger, or its rates were
likely to be raised if it lost, and held its lead to the end.
This is the fourth time Balmain has won the Gardiner
Goblet, the former occasions being in ’95, ’96, and ’97.
« * * *
In spite of numerous free counter-attractions
28,057 persons (as against 32,668 last year) parted
£lO6l 17s. 6d. to see the Yic. Football League final on
Saturday. The Railways put on specials from Ballarat,
Bendigo and Geelong, and the country came to town to
see a great battle between Collingwood and Fitzroy. Up
to half-time they got their, money’s worth in a fair,
strenuous, open game. It was so hard-fought and so
close that at quarter-time ’Roy had notched but three
behinds to ’Wood’s one, while at half-time the scores were
level—l goal 3 behinds each. It was a pretty game to
watch, the bigger and heavier ’Woodsmen never able to
rush or overpower the lighter, but quicker, ’Roys. But
after the spell ’Wood couldn’t get its system going properly
—the chief exponent thereof, Condon, being useless with
a sprained ankle —while ’Roys put in several brilliant
exchanges that rattled their opponents and brought them
three more goals and three behimis, while ’Wood could only
tally one of each. (This latter was from a lovely low kick
by Peers, who, the night before, had driven 40 miles over
the western plains to catch the morning train from
Geelong to Melbourne.) The last quarter was mostly a
fierce struggle by ’Wood to score the needed 15 points.
The whistle, for breaches of the rules, was going continu-
ously ; and thrice hot-tempered players exchanged fistic
compliments, a handy constable having to threaten
summary arrest to stop one scuffle. Outside, barrackers
raved and bellowed, a few getting as far as the
black-eye stage. But all ’Wood’s endeavors gained
them only one poor behind ’Roy’s defence was
too solid, and when the bell rang it found latter pre-
miers by 4 goals 6 behinds to 2 goals 5 behinds. ’Roy
first flew the pennant in’ 95, and has been top-dog on four
occasions since. Undoubtedly, the best team won, and
the victory was due chiefly to concerted play.
* * * *
Across, the park, at East Melbourne, some
15,000 spectators mildly applauded the Association
leading clubs Richmond and North Melbourne-
fighting their “final,” but as both had the right
to challenge there was always a dim suspicion
that they were not straining themselves. On
the play it looked quite a straight game, the
chief trouble being that North seemed to have
a notion that a behind was as good as a goal,
while Richmond put a new man on the forward
line, and was mightily pleased when he kicked five goals
out of the 7 goals 6 behinds scored against North’s
3 goals 10 behinds. This habit of kicking the wrong side
of the post is fatal. As a result of the previous Satur-
day’s “ scraps ” the committee had wiped out one player
for the whole of next season and another for half, so
Saturday’s discussion was of a distinctly peaceful charac-
ter. Next Saturday North “challenges” Richmond for
the premiership—the last match of the season—and if the
rain holds off, and Bent quits bellowing, and Yes-No will
stop in Sydney, there should be a great uproar and a
large house.

North Sydney, despite its wholesale dismember-
ment, beat Balmain at cricket, hands down. Its two sawn-
off limbs, Gordon and Middle Harbor, were soundly wal-
loped, but their downfall was a great moral victory'com-
pared to the awful crushing that Glebe, Burwood, and
Redfern gave Paddington, Sydney, and Central Cumber-
land respectively. Talk about Togo and the Baltic Fleet,
listen to the scores:—Glebe, 3 for 205 (innings closed),
against Paddington’s 76, and 9 for 25 ; Burwood, 3 for 227
(innings closed) against Sydney’s 83 and 94 ; Redfern, 366
against Central Cumberland’s 68, and 9 for 122. Nobody
reached a century, but there were some dandy bowling
figures. _

Pye, the Parramatta cricketer generally credited
■with being unjustly used by the great Noble during the
past two or three years, was also badly' treated by a recal-
citrant motor-car which jibbed or shied or something.
A broken wrist was among the injuries, and will affect
his cricket this season. Anyhow, Pye is seized with the
golf mania, and is more interested in “putting than
“cutting,” and “foursomes” have more charm for him
how than “fivers.” Appointed to a place on N.S.W.
second team selection committee, he promptly resigned
therefrom. ,

Alick Bannerman, who received in 1878 the first
ball ever bowled to a white Australian in England, the
bowler being Alfred Shaw, was bowled by Bowden in
each innings this week for one and two. Does not the
veteran lag superfluous on the stage ?
“Slip” : Clever little stumper Carter, son of a
• Sydney suburban undertaker, started last Saturday with
a modest 25, marked by strokes to every point of the
compass. Without a peer in Australia for the last three
years in his own special line, his rejection for Kelly and
Newland was just about the most glaring of the crimes of
the last boodle-hunting syndicate’s engineers. Carter is
on the Blackham-Pilling plane, and this year should see
him behind the sticks for the No. 1 N.S.W. eleven,
permanently fixed there for some time to come.
A willow enthusiast writes: A brutal day
marked the opening ot N.S.W. cricket season last Satur-
day, but Labor Monday, when the games were resumed,
had its compensations. Pity the authorities don t start
at 11 a.m. on this holiday instead of 2.16 p.m. The oppor-
tunity for a full day’s play should be seized, seeing that
the majority are limited to 3J hours per week, on Satur-
day afternoons. The objection that an extension of time
for play in that particular round might unfairly influence
the destination of the champion flag should be over-
weighted by the extra benefit of one whole glorious
day’s cricket. And, after all, the play’s the thing—hang

N.S.W. Cricket Association will continue to
try and instil vim into country cricket by bringing teams
to Sydney in November. Unless the country sloggers
show better form than they did last year the effort will
be a vain one. The trouble is, of course, that there is
such a swarm of good cricketers in Sydney waiting for a
show in representative cricket that country members get
no chance. As the Scripture saith, it is easier for an ele-
phant to passthrough the eye of a needle than to push
an old player out of the N.S.W. team, and while that is
so Country Week will continue to be a wearisome failure.

N.S.W. Cricket Association and Sydney Cricket
Ground Trustees are squabbling over the appointment of
a trustee. The Cricket Association has invariably ap-
pointed its president a trustee, and when Eeid (he of the
eye-glass and dog) was president of the Association, a
couple of years ago, he was placed on the trustee-
list. Now there is a new president, W. J. Trickett.
and Reid has been deposed from the body of trustees,
upon which the Association is trying to place its presi-
dent. The other S.O.G. trustees are wroth, and are
nominating Reid for the billet again ; hut the Association
is ignoring them altogether, and has appealed to Minister
for Lands Ashton, fiver since the Cricket Association
had to drag the S.C.G. trustees to law in order to teach
them their business the trustees have been unpleasant.

It ia stated that the home-coming Australian
XI. hasn’t been a very happy family, and the fact
that the team is dragging itself in pieces towards
Australia gives color to the report. As to the financial
result of the tour, the amount per head to each cricketer
will easily top four figures—that is, including the Maori-
land part of the tour. As the Board of Control will take
over the management of all future teams, this bonanza
will probably be the last.
The idea of alloting three points for a win out-
right, and two for a first innings victory, is likely to
produce greater interest in Sydney first-grade cricket.
Hitherto, when a team was disposed of, the opposing side
waded in to flog the bowling unmercifully, and remain at
the wickets for the full time ; but the alteration of points
will cause the closure to be applied, and the bowlers given
a better chance. It is bowling talent that needs brushing
up in Australian cricket generally, and the Association is
on the right track to stimulate a branch of cricket which
has been considerably neglected in the efforts of players
to score centuries and gain the vanity of a headline in the
daily papers.
• • * *
Outside of the test matches the Australians
had very useful luck as a rule—winning the toss against
the strongest of the counties, and getting the best of the
wicket. What might have happened to them in two or three
instances nearly did happen at Bournemouth, where a
“ scratch” England XI. had brought the scores to a dead-
heat before the last Australian batsman (Bill Howell) went
in. With the wicket wearing badly the team that won
the toss was nearly strong enough to win the match, and
had it been Lancashire, Yorkshire, or even Surrey playing
under the same conditions the game would probably have
gone against the visitors. Considering how many tricks
are played by the weather in England, it is a rather lucky
Australian XI. that doesn’t get slipped-up by one or other
of the strongest bowling counties. A respectable score
on a fairly hard wicket, after which a heavy rainpour,
followed by bright sunshine —and the thing is done.
At the opening of a new turf wicket at Singleton,
the other day, the member for the district (Mr. James
Fallick) bowled three balls to the mayor (Mr. York), and
then he bowled three balls back. Didn’t transpire if the
wicket was constructed out of loan money. Probably it
was. _ .

Christchurch and Wellington (Maoriland)
Cricket Associations propose to inaugurate electoral
cricket with residential qualifications. Under the present
system the crack clubs get more players than they want,
and the weaker ones cannot get enough to make a decent
showing. The electoral system introduces a slight element
of chance into the business—even a cricketer cannot
always choose the locality of his own residence.

Sturt (S.A.) lacrosse club has finished up an
astonishing season, in which it has played 12 matches
with other Adelaide clubs, and won them all, beaten St.
Hilda (Vic.’s premier club), and also, single-handed, beaten
combined Westralia (in Adelaide) and combined Victoria
(in Melbourne). It is not likely that any club in Australia
ever before had the chance of taking on two whole States in
one season at any game whatever, let alone beating them.
The Sturt figures are nearly all records: 200 goals in the
season by one man, Humphris, and H by him in one
match. This last record was once equalled by Phil
Newland, who is a better lacrosse player than wicket-
keeper. # # . ,
Ancient oarsman Richard Green, who won the
Sydney National All-comers’ Outrigger race in 1867 and
’6B, announces that his son Frank is going to reach out
for the championship of the world. Francis certainly
looks, in his portraits, a hefty young man. The most
remarkable thing about him is that he will use a fixed
seat, both father and son holding the sliding apparatus in
hearty contempt. If Francis, on a fixed seat, can down
men like Stanbury and Towns, then he is the most remark-
able rower Australia has seen for many a long day. At
present he is located in Wellington, Maoriland, but will
shortly be in Sydney with a challenge to Stanbury to
come out where the ducks swim and show what he is
made of. _ _
* • * *
Stanbury hasn’t yet covered the deposit put up
by George Towns for a return match for the champion-
ship, but is' waiting a reply from Durnan, the Canadian.
Towns’challenge, before the previous match had grown
cold, has had the effect of keeping the champion in his
outrigger on the Parramatta River, as he desires to avoid
growing too bulky. Towns plugs away at boat-building.
A huge crowd of the sons of Erin gathered at
the Friendly Societies’ Ground, Melbourne, to watch the
N S.W.-Victoria inter-State hurling match. Hurling is
the Irish national game, and although this writer is a
Sassenach, he has no hesitation in declaring it a very
good game indeed —one of the best, in fact. N.S.W. was
very confident (the game is younger in Victoria than on
the Sydney side), but the Victorians were apt pupils, and
although less scientific at the start they had a lot more
energy than the visiting team. Moreover, the presence
of the Church, in the person of Father Rohan, was a
tower of strength to the local men. The N.S.W. men
caught beautifully (the game allows the players to catch
the bung with the left hand and slog it with the
hurley, which is carried in the right), and, moreover,
were able to do much more effective work than
the Victorians with double-handed strokes. But Father
Rohan and the Victorian base man, Bourke, played
sound defence. At the end of the second quarter the
Cornstalks were leading by 2 goals 3 behinds to 2 behinds,
and things looked blue for the men of Bent’s State. By
this time the Victorians had got accustomed to one
another, or got over their shyness, or something, and
played a much more systematic game. Some beautiful
passing rushes took place, and the N.S.W. fortunes began
to sink, and the end of the third quarter saw the scores
2 goals 3 behinds all—a most, remarkable thing. The last
quarter was desperate, but the Victorians, prevailed, and
the game ended in the defeat of N.S.W. by 4 goals
6 behinds to 3 goals 6 behmds. Just possible that another
match may be played next Saturday. Hurling, by the
way, is one of the most ancient field-games of the Celtic
rale, and has been played for nearly 1000 years under
practically the same rules as govern it to-day.
With a hope that the process will reveal the
best amateur athletes to represent N.S.W. in the cham.
pionships meeting in November, Sydney University will
battle against the combined clubs and public schools in
an all-day programme shortly. Considering that the
Uni. contains whales like Barker, Waddy, andTFutter, not
to mention other leviathans, the result of that days
tussle ought to make sole selector Dick Coombes task an
easy one. _ „

The death of Charles Tudor Bird, a one-time
celebrated long-distance ped., who came out here with
Frank Hewitt, recalls to mind that though he was
credited with being able to run 11 miles within the hour,
he never succeeded in any of his attempts at the featin
Australia. The best he ever did was 11 miles in 63min.
from the 14-mile post on the main road, Tasmania, to
Cooley’s, at New Town. A reputed successful attempt m
Victoria was proved a fraud, three or four feet having
been cut out of the centre of the measuring tape. A
contemporary of Bird was another long-distance runner,
Mat Higgins, who could run 10 miles in 60 minutes.
Higgins has been for many years, a member of the
Tasmanian police force, and has risen to the rank of
sergeant.

A guessing match at the recent Live Stock Show
in Adelaide showed results that were cut down very fine.
The victim bullock was duly slain, and weighed when
cold 115541 b. A leading squatter had guessed 115441 b.,
and two other shots (one by a lady) were within 241 b. of
the exact figure. The 350 shillings received went to the
Children’s Hospital, less £7 for prizes (nominally, but the
squatter returned the fiver he won). The £l7 which the
bullock sold for also went in the sacred interests of
charity, so the dead animal may reckon that he perished
in a good eause.

According to evidence before the Victorian
Police Commission, one city constable was transferred to
Dim Distance for “improper interference at a football
match.” It was deposed that this man found life so
unbearable after his rash act that he prayed to be sent
right out into the desert where he wasn’t known, ana
where he could start life afresh. It is.assumed that his
“ improper interference ” averted the dismemberment of
an umpire. # #

The ancient Hebrew gentleman who wrote that
the race is not to the swift was evidently acquainted with
bike racing of the road variety. As in the Goulburn-
Sydney race, so it was in the Warrnambool to Melbourne
contest. Mighty Jack Arnst, who rushes along at the
speed of a locomotive, and the rest of the back-markers
never had a show. W. E. Hawley, of Victoria, who
finished first, was on the 25min. mark, and is the same
rider who, the week previously, won the 25-mile road
championship of Australasia at Campbellfield course
(Melbourne). R. Finlay and E. J. Turner, second and
third men respectively, both had 60 min. start,
and even in a 165-miles run such handicaps tell.
The road was heavy from the effects of a night’s down-
pour of rain, and of the 196 acceptors 42 re-
tired at the last minute. Then 38 dropped out on
the road, including those who met with accidents.
Falls were numerous. Two riders collided, also one ran
down a local cyclist, whilst another rode over a young
lady. The back men, flinging themselves along at top
speed to overtake the field, had the most spills, and the
constant battering of the King’s (or Bent’s) highway took
the steam out of them. It is said that Hawley finished
quite fresh. Well, his actual riding time was only 9min.
26sec. more than Jack Arnst’s record time for the same
race, and if he got so close to the record on a wet road,
with competitors falling around him like ninepins, and
finished “ quite fresh,” then he got ahead of the handi-
capper. #
The Sydney Summer Nights-Amusements syndi-
cate has decided that there shall be a Sydney Thousand
this season, to take place, as usual, in March, 1906. The
first fortnight of November will see five nights’ racing at
Sydney Cricket Ground, which will be illuminated as
usual. Up to date there are no particulars of what foreign
riders are likely to be here, neither has there been any
notification of what particular measures will be used to
keep the bookmaker out of the soup.

Cycle racing in Victoria has not been too clean
at the best of times, but, during the last couple of seasons,
the roguery and thieving carried on by a section of riders
and their “ trainers ” would shame a Petticoat Lane Jew.
Saddles, shoes, tyres, wheels, chains and, finally, whole
bicycles disappeared. The sufferers complained to the
League officials. And at last the L.V.W. is makings move
to clean out undesirables. Hitherto, all that so-called
“trainers” had to do, was to present themselves at the
League office with a shilling, and they received in exchange
a trainer’s ticket, no questions being asked. The class of
riders these so-calledtrainers” look after are, for the most
part, as undesirable as the trainers themselves, and the
only “prize money” they ever get is that which they
receive from just as undesirable bookmakers, for interfer-
ing with the favorite and so spoiling the latter’s chance of
winning. How some of these riders and trainers live on
the game is a mystery, for they do not honestly earn
enough money to keep a Chinese skeleton in rice. The
League is now submitting applicants for training tickets to
a searching examination, and only those who are known
to the officials as decent-living men are registered. Several
“professional” cyclists who are known not to be too
straight have also been assured that their doings both on
and off the racing track will be closely watched this
season, and that they must walk the chalk line of un-
swerving rectitude to avoid lifelong disqualification.

The tournament for the Victorian amateur
billiard championship produced some very bright play
towards the finish. Jacoby, last year’s winner, failed
quite brilliantly in the game that put him hors de combat.
His two biggest breaks topped 60, and two more were a
shade higher than the best of his opponent, who beat him
by 16 points. But whereas Jacoby is rather an “ in-and-
outer,” the other fellow, Haley, is a first-class plugger,
and in a subsequent game he averaged 9‘6 per innings-
very fast billiards for an amateur on a championship
taffie. *
In refusing “ Tote ” Wren’s nominations for the
next meeting at Flemington, the V.R.C. committee seems
to have acted on very ancient suspicion, without stating
any suspicions whatever. What’s the matter with Wren
nowadays that wasn’t always the matter with him ? Ten
months ago, rumor had it that the victory of Wren’s
Murmur in the Caulfield Cup race was partly achieved
by the same tactics that won an Austral Wheel race for
Wren’s Bill Martin—tactics that subsequently came to
light in a Melbourne law court. Truly or otherwise, it
was stated as within the knowledge of many people that
nine of the jockeys in the Caulfield Cup field had been
“deadened” in the interests of .Murmur. A careful
official inquiry, with a wise expenditure of cash, would
put the “ authorities ” iir sufficiently full possession of the
facts of such yarns. And having got the facts, it would
be their duty to trot them out instead of uttering myste-
rious indirect pronouncements.

Tote-man Wren is exercising the V.R.O.
intellect over a lordly sort of scheme. Subject to that
body’s approval and patronage, the Collingwood person
says he will purchase a site for a new course at Eltham,
and guarantees £lOOO for each day’s sport of six events.
As a side inducement he casually mentions an intention
to associate his proposed ground with an annual classic
event carrying a £lO,OOO stake. The V.R.C. will probably
look askance at a proposal which may ultimately relegate
its own classic Gup to a second-class seat; and, anyway,
are there not too many races already, and isn’t that land
at Eltham wanted to settle Booth’s undesirable immi-
grants on ?
“ 0.K.” ; Where is the justice of income-taxing
a racehorse owner —say G. G. Stead—upon the stakes he
wins in any Australian State? If his racing-stud be
regarded as a trading concern he is fairly subject to a tax
on the annual profits, but the money gained at one
particular meeting is not annual income. A merchant
doesn’t pay tax upon his successful deals. His working
expenses and losses in “ job lines ” are set against them ;
the profit (if any) for the whole year counts as his income.
To tax Mr. Stead upon his N.S.W. turf winnings as though
they r presented a clear business profit is a manifest
imposition. A man may lose money by his racehorses
every year (irrespective of betting transactions) whilst
receiving considerable sums in stakes from the clubs he is
dealing with. Suppose he buys a gee for £2OOO, and it
wins £5OO, and then breaks its neck. His loss is £l5OO
and he is taxed on £5OO profit.

The supplementary edition of Miller’s Sporting
Pamphlet brings the list of Cup-horses’ performances up
to September 18, and throws the light of the recent
A. J.O. meeting upon this guide to “form.” A devout

rough conclusions re the oldest and hardest worked of

York, the crack Australian hurdle-racer, was
shipped to England last week, and is likely to win the
next Grand National Steeplechase in the Cold Country.
There’s no patriotic objection to York being exported, for
he could have no bearing on the breed of horses here-
abouts. He will, doubtless, finish up between the shafts
of a cockney hansom.

Re the agitation for a really Australian Derby.
Why “ Derby ” ? Most of the important Australian races
are labelled with slavish copies of English popular events,
except the Cups. Why should this be ? Why the blessed
“St. Leger”? Why “Epsom” and “Newmarket”?
Worse still, why the “ Grand Nationals ” ? If the V.R.C.
holds a Grand National jumping race one week, how can
the V.A.T.C. hold another equally “Grand” National
next week ? We have the Melbourne “ Cup.” Why not
call the next most important race a “ Saucer ” or a
“Boomerang”? Don’t let us call it a “ Plate.” “Plate”
is reminiscent of the heirlooms that Jeames, the flunkey,
cleans in the hereditary halls of the Duke of Over-Wallop,
at Wallop, near Bogley-under-Lyne.

The mantle of Annette Kellermann—if so brief
a garment can be called a mantle —has fallen upon
Beatrice Kerr, the amateur Vic. girl champion, who made
her first appearance in the public tank at the opening of
the Melbourne Shoot on Saturday evening. Beatrice is
pretty, athletic, and brown, but otherwise bears no
resemblance to her illustrious predecessor. Despite her
muscular arms and legs, she exhibits no signs of the
plumpness which threatened to destroy the contours of
Miss Kellermann. She is a little Venus. Without a scrap
of fragility, she is graceful and dainty and essentially
feminine in all her movements, and the black and silver
snake-like bathing dress she filled without a crease could
not have been coaxed on a prettier little figure with a
shoe-horn. Beatrice is only about 16 or 17, and hails
from Albert Park, where she carried off many champion-
ships and won enough medals to make a bathing costume
—as bathing costumes go.

“Uppercut”: Remarks (B. 28/8/’O5) re Wren
and pugilism were obviously written by somebody who
doesn’t know the tote proprietor. To express fear that
Wren's personality may corrupt pugilism is much like
saying that the promoters of Tatts. would corrupt the
Sydney land agents or the Melbourne butter brigands.
Until recently pugilism in Victoria smelt like the
speech of a Tory politician on Australian products.
The management’s aim was to beat the fighters out of as
much as It could, and the fighters in turn took it out
of the public and rigged things shamelessly. Wren
stands to many people as synonymous with Satan, but, in
fact, he is a business man pure and simple. _ He is out for
cash every time, and his whole success is due to ms
appreciation of the fact that honesty, towards those he
has direct dealings with, is the best policy. His Colling-
wood tote was built up by the free advertising it obtained-
about his honesty. Once, when Wren was fined on the
evidence of a disguised policeman who entered the tote
and backed a winner, he sent along the amount of the
winnings to the police station, and. the incident was-
trumpeted from Dan to Beersheba. With Wren running
pugilism, there is every probability of fair-fought battles
—anyhow until the game gets important enough to make
a crook fight worth big money.

The Sydney public did not roll up in over-
whelming numbers to see Messrs. Gould and Cullen
damage one another at the Gaiety Club on Saturday
night. Bruising is a game at which a rose does not smell
as profitably by another name, and yet, in the majority
of cases, it is the unknown men, the unsophisticated
beginners, Who put up the best scraps. When they have
been at the game a long while they grow wary, they
learn how to avoid punishment, and they develop
a business instinct which, even in the absence of
any formal understanding, gives the paying public
as much frill and as little gore as possible for
its money. Oullen and Gould were very unso-
phisticated, and for four bitter rounds Mr. Gould raged,
trying to dismember Oullen, Esq.—who kept his chin out
and hit back for all he was worth. Then the ferocity o.
his attacks began to tell on Mr. Gould, and he slackened
off somewhat; but Mr. Oullen grew enthusiastic, and
commenced to make the pace. Mr. Gould rallied occa-
sionally, and tried to respond, but Mr. Cullen whirled
round him, bashing, jabbing and poking till, at the end
of the seventh round, Mr. Gould intimated that he was
“ satisfied.” Anyone who wasn’t more than merely satis-
fied with what Mr. Gould had received must be just a
plain, unvarnished glutton.

gives his experince of the toto in
Melbourne : A friend who was known introduced me and
I was made a “member.” Somebody took down my
name, address, occupation, and gave me a scrip worth 25.,
purporting to be a share in a company of so many thou-
sand shares. There was a number on the scrip which you
make use of in betting, and your name never need be
mentioned. I went down the room. There was a long,
high counter, and sitting behind this a couple of clerks-
with records of each race and the horses backed
for wins and places. A long platform at the back sup-
ported a huge blackboard, marked off for the different
races. A couple of men were on the platform armed with
pieces of chalk. I went to the counter and backed for a
win and a place. The clerk recorded it, called it out, and
the blackboard boy put a stroke each side of the name,
the left side representing a win and the right side a place.
Half an hour before the race the tote for that race closed.
Before this happened I scanned the room. All sorts were
congregated, high-collared dudes rubbing shoulders with
bottle-oh and barrow men. Some were eagerly looking
at weights, others telling of a “ dead cert. Someone
comes in cautiously and sidles up to the counter and lays
his five wins and five places. Others hear it and think it
must be good, and soon the tally of the horse is stretched
out, which makes prospects of good dividends look small.
The tote is closed, but not before someone has
picked up some friendless horse and put a little
on him to keep him warm. A bet of ■ that
sort sometimes comes off and brings a rich reward. After
some little time a bell is rung, and a bush falls on the
room that would do credit to any prayer-meeting. Slowly
come through the names of the scratched horses. A
groan goes up when some horse with something like 45
wins and 60 places gets crossed out. The next exciting
event is to see how your neddy is regarded on the course,
which is gauged by the betting. Your hopes rise when
the price of your favorite shortens. After two or three
flashes of brisk work in straight-out betting, all is quiet,
and then dead silence until a ring comes, and you hear
the names of the placed horses read out. The dividend is
soon calculated, and there’s a big crush for the cash.


Since the White Star Line placed in the Austra-
lian service five 12,000 ton twin-screw steamers with iden-
tical accommodation for one class of passengers only, the
Australian public have shown their appreciation by taking
whole of the accommodation during the passenger
Beason, which covers departures from Australian ports
between February and May of each year. Family parties
especially favor this line, which has established itself as
“ the holiday line ” for a large portion of the community.
Intending passengers residing in any part of the country
districts are supplied with plans of accommodation, and
all other information, enabling them to book as reliably
as if they were able to visit the steamers while in port.
Messrs. Dalgety and Co., Ltd., are agents throughout

a careful stulv of this book anyone may become ft
skilled hypnotist, and,either for practical purposes or
for amusement, may learn to exercise this strange and won*
derfai power over others. The possession of this faculty is
of inestimable value to persons in all ranks of life. It is
employed, oonsoiously or unconsciously, by every successful
business man, politician, actor, preacher, orator and
teacher. Without its influence the most accomplished speaker
fails to arouse the interest of his audience, while by its
power every argument becomes effective, every appeal is
responded to, ana the entire assemblage is swayed and con-
trolled at the will of the orator. Similarly in business mat-
ters, <m Q man succeeds where another fails simply because the
one becomes en rapport with the person with whom he deals,
while the other cannot. The first chapter of the instructions
«pl*ins that everyone may hypnotise, the seoond chapter
gesoribes the methods of hypnotism, and so on throughout

tion of the theory and practice of this most wonderful

Brisbane Daily Wail was started origi-
nally to barrack for the Philp Government, but
that reckless combination was ordered to stand
down by a general election before the paper saw
the light. Now the fatherless organ is trying to
form a new party on its own account. The planks
of its platform mainly consist of “ WHY ?” The
Wail is waving its gamp and asking why Queens-
land has not a population of nine millions; why
there are not thousands of new agricultural indus-
tries ; why there are not thousands of factories;
why the country’s mining resources are not yield-
ing hundreds of millions every year ; and uttering
many other whys to the same effect. Presumably
the new party is to bring about all these hundreds
and thousands and loose millions, but, so far, it
seems to consist of one member, Somerset, who
has done nothing in particular save abandon the
Morgan Ministry and join old busted Philp over
the Land Monopoly Tax.
Over 40 sheep-breeders in N.S.W. were
notified by Government order, 90 years ago, to
call at the Government woollen factory at Parra-
matta to receive such quantities of cloth as they
were entitled to on account of wool delivered at
the factory. The Foreign-trade craze has caused
a lot of retrogression in 90 years.
On Lyne’s very sensible Commerce Bill,
which endeavors, so far as State Frights allow,
to force both local and foreign traders to be
passably honest, Joe Cook made about 300
orations. As each clause appeared the Opposi-
tion Talk Machine got on its legs and asked in a
loud tone of pained regret: “Is this a horrid
dream?’’ In one brief spasm the One Man
Pantomime from Parramatta scattered the fol-
lowing gems of mercantile wisdom :
Why add another needless statute to the many by
which Australia is now afflicted ? ... It all goods going
out ol the country should have the truth told regarding
their weight, size, quality and grade, I want to know
whether this is not grading in its very essence... A trade
secret ought to be regarded as sacred If the Bill were
passed in its present form it would place the Minister for
Trade and Customs in the position of a Czar of Commerce.
... In the harvester ease the Minister increased the
price of machines by an arbitrary act.... lam told that
the ordinary Chinese has no knowledge whatever of
weights If we alter the size of the tins in any way—
even by stamping the weight on them —the Eastern races
will not look at them.... The word of a reputable mer-
chant should be accepted.... It is a good principle,
which has worked, well for thousands of years, that when a
man buys an article he takes the risk of making a good
bargain. In this case, however, it is proposed to set up a
standard for him The Bill will strike a blow at the
commerce of Australia.
Already something of the glamor is being
rubbed off the Booth immigration scheme. The
latest news is that the immigrants, or a large pro-
portion of them, are not to “go on the land ” at
once, but are to work for wages for an indefinite
period, till they raise a little money. But until
Australia gets a tariff that will really help along
local industries—until it imports a great deal less
and manufactures a great deal more—there isn’t
enough wages work to keep its own people em-
ployed. Of course, the Bootliites—seeing that
they feed mostly on hallelujah and on the smell of
a hymn—can work for less than current wages,
and can drive out some of the men who are already
employed, which is what Booth’s hallelujah band
is doing wherever the Big Drum curse has pene-
trated. Still, that is not exactly the sort of thing
that was promised. This country wanted an
influx of sturdy, independent settlers—not a rush
of servile cheap labor, vacant about the eye and
retreating about the chin, with its soul in Booth’s
pocket, and the front of its cap worn out through
much touching of it to persons in authority, and
its ear frayed through listening for the commands
of its hook-nosed apostle.
G. 0. Klug, manager of the Boulder Per-
severance mine and the Fremantle smelting works,
has been telling the Tariff Commission in Wes-
tralia that “ when they wanted highest efficiency
they had to import machinery from abroad ” ;
wherefore machinery, fire-bricks, coke, and all
kinds of belting should be admitted free. The
young man who tells the Commission this
is an Australian, trained in Australia, mostly
at the Adelaide School of Mines, and in
the Broken Hill Proprietary Co.’s works.
But as “the highest efficiency ” is always foreign,
what is the Australian Klug doing in his present
billet ? And what are half-a-dozen others of the
most successful managers in Westralia doing in
their billets? Australia now produces as good
managers as any in the world, because it has been
in that business some time, and has schools and
mines and smelting works ; if it isn’t producing as
good machinery as any in the world (in some lines
it is), it is only because the works haven’t been
established. Obviously the brains are here—or
else Klug and the rest shouldn’t be where they
are.

A GREAT FEMALE MEDICINE.
Females who value health should never he without these Pills. It has been admitted by physicians that
women cannot too highly value them. They have given health and spirits to hundreds, who, without them,
would have been in their graves. They purify the blood, remove obstructions, and give the skin a beautiful,
clear, healthy, and interesting appearance. A bottle of these Pills is a great medical companion at certain
periods. Prom one to three should be taken every day until relief is obtained. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
1 ills, are a permanent and positive cure for Biliousness, Indigestion, Constipation, Headaches, Sallow Com-
plexion, Liver and Kidney Troubles, Piles, Pimples, Boils and Blotches, and for Female Ailments.

A new way by which woman can earn a
more or less dishonest pound or two has been
shown in England—and it looks like a way that
may be spread to other parts. On the express to
Cornwall the Great Western Railway Co. has in-
stituted the lady’s maid. The male attendant
who roams the corridors, polishing boots and
bringing the cup of tea, and saying “Yessir,”
Australia knows ; why not the maid, who will
attend to the back-hair in the morning? A ship
without a rudder would have about the same
chance of getting women passengers as one with-
out a stewardess; and the marvel is that
some enterprising chick in a cap hasn’t pushed
herself into the corridor car long ago.

remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition ot ill-health
known as “ run-down ” <r “out of sorts. Females

matism, Lumbago, Pains and S.iffness in the

What with one thing and another, Australia’s old
enemy, Decline of the Birth-Rate .(it was on him
that the Stinking Fish party cut its teeth, so to
speak) has had to go and hide himself in a cave.
The old humbug got a nasty set-back when it was
pointed out that the real thing was, not the
number of births, but the excess of births over
deaths—it wasn’t much gain to a country to have
a boom in babies if it also bad a boom in corpses.
And the latest figures from that point of
view show Australia not anywhere near the
bottom of the list, but right _ away at
the ti\p, wearing proud feathers in its tail.
Taking the Australian figures for 1904 and
other countries’ figures for 1903, as far as the
Registrar-General of England gives them (and he
reckons that he gives all that are worth having),
little Tasmania stands absolutely ahead of all
others, with an excess of 18'55 per 1000 of average
population—an annual gain of 18'55 per 1000 by
excess of births over deaths. Westralia comes next
with 18 - 43; Maoriland third with 17'37. The Ger-
man Empire shows up pretty well with 15 - 7 ; the
only other European country that beats it is the
Netherlands, 16‘0 per 1000. Yet N.S. Wales
beats both of them, and has a small infant and a
large decimal to spare. The United Kingdom, as
a whole, with 12T, isn’t entitled to wear as much
frill as even Victoria ; and Victoria’s record is by
far Australia’s worst. From the way the original
Stinking Fish party used to talk on this subject,
Australia got the idea that its record was just
about as bad as France’s ; and France, even with
recent improvements, can only score an increase
of I'9 per 1000. It isn t crape, then, that Aus-
tralia needs to bind its births, marriages, and
deaths statistics with ; if they want any binding
at all, the sort of ribbon that they put on the
prize ox at the show seems the correct millinery
for the situation.

Willy Kelly, who provides comic relief
in the House of Reps., arose to hotly oppose
the provisions of the Commerce Bill, which
prohibit the exportation of deleterious foodstuffs,
remarking: “Surely, sir, we are only concerned
about the health of our own people.” This just
shows how substantial is the alleged Imperialism
about which the Kelly person is constantly
barking. As long as it only means spending
Australian money on condemned British ironclads,
on which Kelly’s Piccadilly friends may find
billets, he is whooping round with a Union Jack
like a dancing Dervish filled with bhang. Directly
it comes to protecting the rank and file of hard-
working British people from being poisoned by
adulterated produce, Kelly is out to barrack all he
knows for the unscrupulous Australian agent of
whom the butter brigands are a fair sample.

RHEUMATISM CURED
From Mr. Wm. Milnes, Pallet-street, New Chum, Bendigo, Victoria.
“ About eight years ago I was, for a considerable time, a great sufferer from rheumatism. Acting
on the advice given me by several people, I took Warner’s Safe Cure. lam pleased to say that, when
I had taken the contents of two bottles, I was cured.
From Mrs. Nellie Davidson, 32 Keig-street, Newtown, N.S.W. . ...
“When living in Boggabri, about 18 months ago, I was laid up for nearly the whole winter with
Rheumatism, and could not obtain any relief from any of the several medicines I took. One day 1
saw a iram oh let issued by you in which was described a case similar to my own, and 1 decided to try
whether Warner’s Safe Cure would also benefit me. I took three bottles of the medicine and am very
glad to say that I was completely cured and could go about my work cheerfully. I have not felt the
slightest symptom of the return of any rheumatic pain since that time.
From Mrs Elizabeth Bosher, 77 Henderson-road, Alexandria, N.S.W.
“Previous to leaving England, about 40 years ago, I was a great sufferer from Rheumatism
which continued to trouble me for about 24 years after my arrival in Australia. I consulted several
doctors, but they failed to do me any good. I also tried various advertised remedies with the same
unsatisfactory result, and despaired of ever getting relief from the pam. At length I tried Warner s
Safe Cure—for what reason I cannot tell you, because I did not expect to get any more benefit from it
than from the many other medicines I had taken. I was, however, very pleased to notice a decided
change for the better after a short course of Warner’s Safe Cure. The pains slowly but surely left me,
and at last I became quite free from them. This happened 16 years ago and I can honestly say that I
have not suffered in the slightest degree from Rheumatism since that time so that Ihave tc-than
Warner’s Safe Cure for perfectly and permanently curing me. I may say that my case is very well
known in Alexandria, as I have for 40 years resided within half-a-mile of my present address.
From token five bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure for Rheumatism, and
that the result was marvellous. The pain has all left me, I have gained a stone m weight, and am now
in good health.”
From Mr. William Pollock McAuslan, 10 Russell Place, North Wilhamstown, Vic.
“ Some eight years ago I was laid up with a very persistent attack of Rheumatism and although
I was under the care of a leading medical man, at the end of four or five months, instead of getting
better I was growing gradually worse, and m the doctor’s own words, would never make any .perma-
nfnt improvement I fearing that his words might come true, I refused to take his medicine any
WreV K as a last' hope gave Warner’s Safe Cure and Warner’s Safe Rheumatic Cure a trial.
From the taking of the fi'ret dose I could see hope ahead, and in a very little while all pam had left me,
and I never had the slightest sign of any relapse until my complete recovery some seven weeks later.
The doctor’s words, thanks to Warner’s medicines, have not been verified, as from that day, eight
years ago, to this, I have not had the slightest symptoms of that dreadful complaint.
GOUT CURED .
From Mr. R A. Thompson, Mining Engineer, 148 Adelaide Terrace, Perth, W.A.
When writing you some time back as to the efficacy of Warner s Safe Pills m biliousness, I
mentioned being Ibout to try a course of Warner’s Safe Cure for Gout The result of taking the
medicine was simply wonderful, as many people in Perth can testify, and I speak of the
benefit I received. The action of the medicine was this : First a gradual toning up of the stomach
then better appetite purer blood-making, and slow (at first) but sure disappearance of the Gout. J-he
food takenduring tJcourse was plain but wholesome. 1 am glad also to tell you , that many of my
acquaintances have derived great benefit from both the Safe Pills and the Safe Cure.
LU IVIES AGO CURED .
From Mr F. L. Seager, Waratah-street, Darlinghurst, N.S.W .
“About six years ago I had an attack of lumbago, so severe that I could not walk for nine weeks.
I tried many medicines, porous plasters, and electric batteries, without material relief. My docto
could do notS for me. Hearing so much about Warner’s Safe Cure I decided to try it After
t a kino- the first bottle I felt greatly relieved, and started to walk again, and after taking eight bottles
I was°completely cured. I have not suffered in any way since, and strongly recommend, Warner a
Safe Cure to anyone afflicted with a similar complaint. I consider the medicine invaluable.
SCIATICA CURED .
From Mr .Tames Spencer, 62 Queen Street, Fremantle, W. A. ... . ,
“ Some years a«-o I was a fearful sufferer from sciatica. Most excruciating pain seized me, extend-
ing from theliip right down to the ankle. None but those similarly afflicted can imagine the agony I
endured The pain deprived me of all sleep. I could barely move about. I had medical aid, but it
did not relieve me. My attention was called to Warner s Safe Cure, and I commenced to take it,
deriving benefit after the first few doses. By the time I had finished four bottles the pain had all
vanished and I could again get refreshing sleep. I have every reason to believe that Warners Safe
Cure has'eradicated all rheumatic poisons from my system, as I have had no return of the pain since
that time.”

Business, Robbery, etc.
“S.” : The Bulletin, discovering the wiles of
wicked house-agents, neglected an impudent trick fre-
quently worked by the spielers in the game. House-
owners have a very bad opinion of the honesty of poor
tenants, based on the belief that these people almost
invariably skip by the dark o’ the moon, owing one or
two weeks’ rent; whereas it often happens that the left
tenant is discredited with the agent’s lt is a
common trick of the business to pouch the last payment,
and represent the late occupant as having neglected to
square up before lighting out. If the owner is a hard,
passionate person, who shows a disposition to hunt for his
money, the agent manifests his zeal in his principal’s
interest, explaining soon afterwards that he captured
the lost tenant at great personal risk and dragged the
amount from him ; but the house-owner who is reluctant
to run down a defaulting tenant generally loses a little
bit on every second occupier in this way. With the other
tenants he has a big chance of falling in for a few shillings
also, through the agent’s bad habit of shifting oil the
date of taking possession a week or so in the account
rendered.

“San Remo” is right about the
chemist being, in reality, a conscienceless JBarabbas. Not
so long ago, for a joke, I asked a Melbourne chemist for
an ounce of sodium chloride.. I thought he would
“ notice,” but no—he solemnly put up and labelled about
a teaspoonful of common salt, for which he charged 3d.
Again, the country storekeeper will sell anyone lib. of
Paris green, for spraying’ trees, for 6d. ; the chemist com-
pels you to go to the trouble of getting a witness and
signing his poison-book, and charges you Od. for about an
ounce. Or spirits of salt (muriatic acid). Take your
bottle, and you’ll be lucky if you get more than a dessert-
spoonful for 6d. The ironmonger sells it at 3d. for a good
half-pint. Also there is something suspicious about the
regularity of their charges. For a prescription composed
of common drugs—probably costing less than Cd.—the
universal charge is 2s. 6d. Years ago I got a prescription
made up successively by about a dozen chemists. The
first charged 35., and not one of the others raised or
lowered it by so much as a “ thrum.” Finally, I wearied
of this monotonous 35., so I dashed down half-a-crown and
picked up the bottle. The chemist took the coin and said
nothing.

“ Mirumbeck ” : There are few trades in which
tricks play such an important and profitable part as that
of the retail jeweller. Certain retailers arrange with the
manufacturer to turn out certain lines of brooches, rings,
and chains stamped much above the quality that the
articles will assay. When heavy-weight gold wedding-
rings and keepers, reputed to be 18ct. fine, are daily
advertised at less than the cost of a 9ct. article, the wide-
awakes should become suspicious, but nowadays the sale is
to the cheap, and as long as the article is fairly well-
finished and looks all right, customers come. One Cohen-
stein trick is to put a bar and swivel pretty near the
quality stamped, while the body of the chain is almost
base metal in quality. In the country any stamp passes
with most people. A firm has only to stamp letters in a
ring (say a.s.s. or f.a.k.e.) and the average purchaser
thinks it* stands for 15ct., or some high-class mark. Wr.ter
is pestered to the verge of insanity after the visits of a
tribe of colored hawkers, with customers handing in a
bulky type of gent’s signet ring, to know if it is gold. One
look from the expert suffices to convince him that the
thing is worthless, yet the purchasers, who thought they
were getting gold (and so they were —Assyrian gold)
because the article was stamped with one or two undeci-
pherable Asiatic hieroglyphics, will argue that the things
must be gold—as long as my patience lasts.

“ Robert Hap ” : My friend Umberto Peanutto,
had been heavily fined for allowing a chunk of lead to
accumulate under the right side of his counter scales. I
dropped in to condole with him in some measure. I
found him hard at work polishing, with an old sock, the
crimson-coat of the succulent apple. There was a sinister
gleam in his eye, and he seemed disinclined to talk until
I proceeded to denounce the tyranny of the Inspector of
Weights and Measures. Then Umberto exploded, and
covered me with the contempt that he’d bottled up
against the Australian nation for a long time. “ Ah-h-h !
You! Poke it the borax! Gam—play it the football I

Foreign-trade press.

James Gray, secretary to the S.A. State Chil-

mission that he knew of a workman who, being in urgent
want of £47, borrowed it, agreeing to pay £6O in return
by weekly instalments of 10s. The man has since been
paying £2O per year for eight years, and still owes £6O.

“Vulcan”: Michael was a commercial tra-
veller. An out-back compatriot gave him a sucking-pig
with which to appropriately celebrate March 17. To
travel to Svdney the grunter was placed in a sugar-bag
and stowed secretly under the seat of the railway carriage.
This, amongst other things, saved freight. At the first
refreshment stop somebody firmly stood on the prospec-
tive pork. Michael’s subsequent arguments with a polite
but determined station-master were mostly hot words and
pathetic references to “ a little bit o’ ashlip o’ a pig,” but,
notwithstanding, the bundle of grunts was charged
7s. 6d.— freight on live stock at mail rates. The “ shlip ”
was tenderly put in the family backyard. It couldn’t
keep quiet there, so in time the local inspector of nuisances
called. Within the next two days the cost of that sucker
rose to £2 7s. 6d.—the extra two sovereigns being the fine
for keeping “ noxious animals within 40 yards (or some-
thing like that) of a public place.” Michael was exces-
sively rude to the inspector outside afterwards, and this
made the inspector resentful. Within 48 hours he was
again rapping at the family portal. The door was opened
by Michael himself. “Oh 1 you distorted blank ; come
crawlin’ to see if that little shlip o’ a pig’s here yet, have
yer?” The inspector allowed that Michael read his mind
well. “ Well, see now,” said Michael with ferocity, “ may
you stew for all eternity in an extra special sheol if I
didn’t cut the variegated, crimson blank’s throat yester-
day, see.” The inspector lost all interest in pork just
then ; hitherto he’d been aggressive, now he became
polite. “ Will you show me your license, please.” “Me
phwat?” “Your license for killing animals on the pre-
mises,” said the inspector firmly. Michael was still so
stunned a day or two later that he hadn’t a word to say,
when a prosy beak held him up as an awful example of
wilfully lawless citizenship, and raised the total cost of
that sucker to £5 7s. 6d.

A settler in the Stratford (Maoriland) district
borrowed £3OO on the security of a farm. In eighteen
months the lender foreclosed, and the farm was sold for
£440 by auction. The debtor asked for a statement and
got it. It was for £44o—the exact amount the farm had
realised. There were legal expenses some £lO, auc-
tioneer’s expenses £l3, a judgment debt and some rates
and taxes that together amounted to close on £4O, and
the rest was swallowed up in all kinds of things, chiefly
interest and interest on interest. These the sold-up one
could not dispute, but there was one entry which looked
as if it had been altered from 12s. 3d. to 15s. 9d., and for
which no voucher was produced. And the settler is con-
vinced that there was 3s. 6d. of abalance legitimately due
to him, and that the item had been altered because the
man who mopped up all the rest couldn’t bear not to
mop up that also. When a man gets the mopping up
habit it is practically incurable, like the habit of not
being born.

“ Nardoo ” : Is there such a thing as justifiable
assassination ? If so, where can I buy enough of it to
annihilate a firm of girdle-builders. I don’t want to bring
you in as an accessory before or after the fact, but if you
don’t know any firm of reliable family assassins that sell
murder in the bottle, I must refuse to take The Bulletin
any longer. From the aforesaid firm I have received
eighteen letters, all bent on encasing—with a battery—
that portion of my anatomy which is kept for food. lam
physically strong, and not looking for any such environ-
ment, but circular No. 18 (enclosed) tempts me. Out of
pure compassion (for my ailment which doesn’t exist), this
firm of complete strangers reduces aforesaid girdle from its
immense real value to a sordid 20s. The death of these
people is essential. I have looked for murderers in the
directory and can’t find any.

TIRED
Tired ! And supper yet to get for the men in the fields, and after supper
washing dishes, cleaning up, and preparing for the morrow, while the men
sit round and rest and smoke. The question as to this tiredness is : How
much of it is due to overdoing, and how much of it is due to womanly
weakness? The tiredness which comes from a hard day’s work is compen-
sated for by sound sleep, which “knits up the raveled sleeve of care.”
But when tiredness is only another name for weakness, sleep often refuses
to bring its comfort, and the new day finds the weary woman still aching
from the labors of yesterday.
Natural weariness is cured naturally by rest. The weariness which
comes from womanly weakness is cured naturally by using the Freeman
and Wallace’s Prescriptions, which make weak women strong and sick
women well.
Patients write in this strain
“At the time I began taking your medicine I was very weak. I
had a tired feeling all the time, could scarcely walk, pains in head and
stomach, and very bad taste in mouth on getting up in the morning, and also had
other troubles. Four different physicians attended me, but only gave me tem-
porary relief. I bad almost given up in despair when one of your little pamphlets
was handed to me. I sat down and read it carefully, and then wrote to you
describing my ailments. You replied, advising a course of treatment with your
medicines. I took each alternately, as advised. Before I had taken two doses I
commenced feeling better. My heart and stomach felt relieved of that burdensome
feeling. By the time I had finished with the two bottles I felt young as a girl of
sixteen. Concluding I will say X had taken three or four kinds of patent medicine
before trying .your remedies, which made me feel worse instead of better. I think
yours is the best medicine on earth for women.”
Such a cure is one of the many accomplished by the useof Dr. Elizabeth
White’s Favorite Prescription, and she is Principal of the Women’s De-
partment of the Freeman and Wallace Institute, and is registered by the
Medical Boards of New South Wales, Victoria, New Zealand and America.
The statements contained in this letter have their counterpart in the state-
ments of numberless other women who have been cured by the same means.
She was weak, had a tired feeling all the time, suffered from serious trouble,
&c. She was attended by four different physicians, and received only
temporary relief. Took three kinds of patent medicine, and felt worse in-
stead of better. Had almost given up in despair when she was led to use
our Favorite Prescription. After using two bottles she felt “Young as a
girl of sixteen.” No wonder women think that our remedies are the best
medicine on earth for women. She has a right to think so ; the right of a
woman who, finding no help in other physicians or medicines turned in
despair to Dr. White and her skilful methods, and found a quick and com-
plete cure. There is no guess-work about such commendations of this
great medicine for women. It is the praise of women who are cured weak
women, tired women, suffering women, restored to perfect health and
youthful vigor. Here is another form of letter: —
“ When I commenced the use of your medicines I was quite run-down in
strength ; was weak and tired most of the time,” write other patients in different
strain. “ After taking six bottles of your wonderful remedies I felt like a different
person, and was able to do my work without knowing what it was to feel tired.
My complexion was also greatly benefited.”
There’s a point in this letter every woman will appreciate. Sickness
which undermines the strength, plays havoc with a woman’s looks. A run-
down, tired woman has no roses in her cheeks. It is reasonable to suppose
that when our remedies restore the health it should also restore the
appearance of health. It does. It rounds out the hollows in the cheeks,
restores lost flesh, and makes the skin clear and wholesome.
The methods of The Freeman & Wallace Medical Institute
are commended to women as safe and reliable for the cure of womanly ills.
Their remedies heal inflammation and ulceration, and cure female weak-
ness. They are the best tonic and nervine for weak, run-down women,
tranquilising the nerves, encouraging the appetite and inducing refreshing
sleep.
Sick women are invited to consult Dr. Elizabeth White, M.D., Princi-
pal of the Women’s Department, by letter, free. All letters are treated as
strictly private, and sacredly confidential. Address Dr. Elizabeth White,

WHAT IS CATARRH?
MEDICATOR.
ħ
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs, it injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
til eges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge,passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want

Making Money
I was born on a Maine farm. I have made some
great successes in business. My greatest through
Co-operation.
I took $1,500 ($306:2:6) capital, supplied by
Farmers, Women, Physicians, Clerks, Clergymen,
etc., in Belfast, Maine, and in an honest, but very
profitable business, earned and paid them through
BELFAST NATIONAL BANK, $5,000 ($1,020:8:2)
in Cash dividends in the first six months, $25,000
($5,102:0:10) in cash dividends within the next
year, and in 18 months I paid them in round
numbers $330,000.00 (£'67,346:19:2) CASH.
This is HISTORY. Reads
like a fairy tale but it is
TRUE. I made poor
people rich. They helped
me earn the riches. Just
read that over again. I
had $1,500. I earned
and paid my stockholders
$330,000 in cash in 18
months. Every stock-
holder got their share.
That’s my Way of doing
business. You must be-
lieve this statement is
TRUE,for, if I werelying,
I wouldn’t tell you the
place where I earned the
money, and the BANK
where it was paid.
I have learned the great
Value of the right kind of
co-operation, learned how
to make money fast in an
honest, profitable busi-
ness from which millions
are made every year.
I now have a new busi-
ness of the same kind,
only my field is the World.
It is incorporated under
the laws of the State of
lE. F. Hanson, Ex-Mayor
of Belfast, Me..U.S.A.
Ex-Pres. B. & M. L. R. R.
Maine and the U. S. Gov’t. The Stockholders are
absolutely protected from any liability. They are
safe guarded by law. My plan one of extended co-
operation. Stockholders everywhere who can give
me information and lend their INFLUENCE. The
dividends must be large.
I already have 4,000 stockholders in the TJ. ».,
Canada, England, Cuba, Mexico, Sandwich Islands,
Gibraltar, etc. I want a few more. The shares
are going fast. You can invest 4s. or £ 100.
Monthly payments, if you wish. It will be safe
and we will make it grow. This is no gambling
or “shady” scheme. It’s legitimate business.
You will be treated squarely and honestly.
I place 30 years of untarnished business record
behind that statement. I only ask you in your
own interest to INVESTIGATE. You shall have all
the Proof you want. References, .Bankers, Bus-
I iness Men, Church and Public Officials, etc. Send

THE FA.MOXJS REMIEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
TTAS the largest sale of any chest medicine in the world.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest experience delightful and immediate relief ; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting’ in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs" have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufhcien ,

THE REFORMATION OF HARDEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PORT Romahapa, with its blue hills
and sleepy harbor, was the picture of
tranquillity. The hills, pyramid-shaped
and covered with bush, dipped sheer into the blue,
gleaming' waters, and great rocky faces, overhung
with flowering manuka, set the passenger on the
deck Of the incoming steamer wondering where
on earth a landing was to be made. But round a
giant ridge of sandhills the town nestled on the
tiny space of level ground, which was always
being increased by the quarrying and blasting of
freestorte for building purposes.
The Port was infested with “pugs.” It was a
dull, monotonous place, and no one lived there
who was not obliged to. It was torn with the
strife between the “Sea Lions ” and the “ Pilgrims
of Peace.” Who and what the Sea Lions were
originally has always been more or less of a
mystery, but at the time I knew them they were
an unruly push of (principally) waterside toilers.
To them the publicans kow-towed, even to the
extent of free beer, and when any of the push was
run in for riotous conduct, counsel was always
engaged and the fine promptly paid.
The Pilgrims of Peace were affluent. All the
best.people belonged to it, and all the tony young
men were members of its physical development
clnB3, which was presided over by an expensive
instructor. The society had originally been
founded by Mr. Harden, of the Goods Depart-
ment, for the specific purpose of putting the Sea
Lions in their proper place. After nearly six
months’ stubborn fighting, this object was about
attained.
The Pilgrim boom reached high-water marie
when Mr. Harden, going out fishing one night,
heard cries for help proceeding from a small house
in a disreputable lane, and, upon investigation,
discovered a stalwart coal-heaver vigorously beat-
ing his recalcitrant wife. Twenty minutes later
they took that son of toil to the hospital. It was a
chivalrous deed, and was mentioned with unctuous
approbation in two churches and three Sabbath
schools the following Sunday, and held up as a
model and a pattern for muscular Christianity to
the rising generation. Christianity was always
aggressive in that quarter of Maoriland.
As a matter of fact, Harden was a truculent
brute, a born fighter, and a bully. When there
were no Sea Lions to quarrel with, he began to
practise his “art” on anyone.who dared to differ
from him on any subject, and when he took to
fighting die other members of the staff, the Traffic
Office assumed an interest in him.

Manager Mackenzie had been spending a week
in the country, and had returned chockful of
energy. He smiled blandly as he stood on the
hearth-rug and shook hands with Fluter,
“How have things been going—all right, I
hope ?”
“Yes, but for one diing. There has been a
most unaccountable outbreak of assault and bat-
tery all over the section. Harden, of the Goods
at Port Romahapa, is the Worst. He broke up
Grant, the sub-S.M. ; so I shifted Grant and sent
down Wilkie. He had a row with Wilkie two
hours after the latter’s arrival, and meeting him
off duty, gave him the father of a hiding. Sol
relieved Wilkie and sent down Leslie, and he’s
made a worse mess of him than he did of Wilkie.
As Harden’s uncle is ex-Premier and may be the
head of the Government again any day, I made
the brute take his annual leave, and held the case
over for your decision. ”
Manager Mackenzie swore energetically, and
then remarked that political control was the worst
of failures.
“ Were all these atrocities committed off duty?”
“All except Leslie’s—that took place in the
goods shed while they were both on duty, and
Leslie demands Harden’s dismissal in accordance
with the rule.”
“ What does the rule say?”
“ If upon inquiry it is found to be proved ”
‘ That settles it; we won’t make any inquiry.
Has Leslie anyone behind him ? ”
“No, thank heaven, he’s on his own. Seems
to be a bit of a lubber; writes poetry and can’t
telegraph worth a cent. ”
“ H’ m '■ Writes poetry, does he ! That means
hell be hobnobbing with newspaper men and
letting things out. Well, just shift him, and first
chance we get bump him out of the service alto-
gether—-you are sure he’s got no one behind him ?”
“ Quite ! I’ll make a note of it.”
Then Manager Mackenzie went off to his club
feeling that he had done a good morning’s work.
* * * *
Three weeks later Jones, commonly known as
the Labor Saver, who was relieving at far-away
Popatunoa, received a pitiful letter from Leslie
asking the loan of a few pounds. His sister, who
had been suffering from consumption of the throat
for years, was dead; his mother’s health had given
way under the shock; and to crown all, he himself
was under notice of dismissal for some telegraphic
blunder which had cost the Department a few
pounds in compensation. The “bumping out”
had eventuated. Leslie dated all his misfortunes
from the day that Harden had battered him in
Port Romahapa goods shed ; and he asked Jones
to use any influence he had on his behalf on
account of the old lady.
The outburst of language Jones perpetrated on
that occasion was a topic of admiring reminiscence
on the part of Jimmy the Rake for years after-
wards. Jones wired twice the sum requested and
sat down and indited a letter full of vengeance to
Harden at the Port. Harden was promised faith-
fully that immediately Mr. Jones was free he
would call in at the Port and “snap his cowardly
neck like a blanky carrot.”
When that letter, all wrath and sudden death,
arrived at the Port, Harden was absent on his en-
forced leave and blissfully unconscious of what
was going to happen to him when he met Jones.
Having relieved his feelings in this manner,
Jones set to work to try and save his friend’s
billet. He was on terms of social intimacy with
the Old Man, and he wrote him a brief note, in-
forming him that the trout in the Kuriwao stream
were biting beautifully. He also spread himself
on the personal beauty of the rather notorious
wife of squatter Matheson, and mentioned that if
the Old Man came up on a Saturday they could
put in the Sunday at Matheson’s.
The Old Man arrived by the Express midday
■Saturday; and Jones having left the junior in
charge, they proceeded to Squatter Matheson’s in
a neat turn-out Jones had procured for the occa-
sion. On arrival at the homestead, however, they
found that the lady was indisposed—confined to
her room, in fact —and that Matheson had gone to
Willowford to bring out a trained nurse and the
doctor. They had a look round the place, and
then, after a snack, went back to Popatunoa, and
found the usual rainstorm in full blast.
As Manager Mackenzie didn’t care about fishing
in the wet, they spent the evening in the parlor
of the hotel where Jones had his headquarters.
The Old Man talked shop persistently. Jones
discoursed fluently for two hours on how to im-
prove the station at “merely nominal cost,” and
then ordered champagne. The Old Man’s eyes
sparkled, and he rubbed his hands together glee-
fully at the word. Jones saw the opportune time
had arrived, and he told Leslie’s story in a voice
that would have done credit to an elocutionist.
•* * # •
The Old Man shook himself.
“I’m sorry I didn’t know all this before I
recommended his dismissal. However, I’ll make
another report and a certain recommendation ;
perhaps, for once, Caesar may be merciful. I
don’t know what to do with Harden. His crowd
are a nasty lot to deal with. I suppose you
couldn’t suggest any method of curing him ? ”
“Yes,” replied Jones, expectorating with great
accuracy on to the fire-dog. “ Get some hoodlum
who has no idea of fair lighting to give him a h—l
of a doing. Some rough, who’ll hit him when he’s
down, and tear his clothes and dance on him.
Why, I remember”—
“Here’s the supper—by Jove, that’s the very
idea. As soon as you’re through here I’ll send you
down to the Port,” said the Manager, interrupting
J ones before he got properly warmed and reminis-
cent.
For a moment the Labor Saver gaped at him,
and then he laughed. But Manager Mackenzie
filled his glass, and pushed the lettuce and a
breast of cold fowl towards him, without a smile
on his face.
* * * *
Harden’s holidays were running out, and Jones
had only two more days to spend at Popatunoa.
So Harden packed his gripsack and started to
drift down from the Lakes towards home and
work. He left Windy Plains by the early train
to catch the express for Romahapa, but the wind
stuck up the train, and he arrived too late for the
Express, and had to get permission to travel by
the Northern Stock special as far as Ballantyre,
The same day, Jones, having handed over Popa-
tunoa, decided to have a little excitement in the
shape of poaching trout in Aparima River. He
had boasted of his intention to have a day’s
poaching just to see what it was like, and Ranger
Burtqtl Was on the look-out. Jones went down to
Aparima by No. 1, blissfully unconscious of the fact
that Burton had driven down the night before,
When the train steamed into the station Ranger
Burton was lying in the rushes about 150 yards
above the railway bridge, waiting for Jones to
come along the track with a gaffing hook under
his arm, probably wrapped up in brown paper.
When an hour had passed without Jones putting
in an appearance, Burton grew suspicious. He
came out of his hiding place, and as he wandered
down to the hotel for a hot breakfast, he imagined
himself in J ones s place, and after long con-
sideration decided that he would have dropped
off the train two miles up, and made for the river
above Chinamen’s Bend with a view to working
up the stream.
This is exactly what Jones had done, only he
was working down the stream. Burton made a
hasty breakfast, and took horse and galloped to
Mulligan s farm, five miles above Chinaman’s
Bend, and worked down the stream, with a view
to meeting Jones as he worked up. So for half a
day he tramped down the rocky bed of the
Aparima, wondering wherever Jones could be
wasting time. Then, when the sun began to
slope downwards, it suddenly dawned on the
ranger that the poacher was working down stream
again, so as to strike the railway line. He
borrowed a horse, and galloped at full speed along
the road to where he reckoned Jones might be.
Leaving his horse with a Chinese gold-miner, he
started down the rocky bed across the great
shingle bars on foot. When he came to a face of
jutting rock, he swept the river bed with his
glass. The golden sunlight gleamed on the bright
gaffing-hook in the hand of a tall, burly man in a
knickerbocker suit, who was bending over a rocky
ledge half-a-mile away, and as Burton got the
focus he knew the figure for that of Jones. The
gaffing-hook flashed, and the tall man sprang up
with a fine four-pounder on the point. Burton
cursed with a mighty joy as he saw the trout
added to a bundle which the tall man took off a
ledge of rock close by.
Next moment Burton was fairly leaping over
the shingle. The penalty for a first offence was
£2O, and the ranger got half the fine, which Jones,
being a man of means, would surely pay rather
than go to gaol. Burton concealed himself as
much as possible as he ran. From another vant-
age point he took a second glance at his quarry
through the glass. Then he cursed in another
key. The tall man had caught up his bundle of
trout and was bounding over the rocks like a wild
goat.
Ranger Burton knew the hardest chase of his
life had commenced, for to secure a conviction he
must secure the trout and the poacher, and he
didn’t feel quite sure what he would do with
Jones when he caught him. A fairy tale about
what happened to the man who caught the tiger
occurred to him as he went stumbling over the
shingle, for further concealment was useless.
From up the reach the Chinaman, standing by his
cradle, looked on with a smile of Asiatic child-
ishness, till the two figures vanished in the haze.
The Stock Special was toiling up Banmuir
Grade, and Harden had paid his footing in liquor
to such purpose that when a second lot was
obtained at Aparima he realised he had overdone
it. The brakesman was paralytic, curled up
among a heap of dead rabbits consigned to the
freezing works at Ballantyre. Old Jack, the
driver, was very groggy, and they were progres-
sing up the grade by a series of jerks which
threatened to snap the draw-bars every moment.
Guard Merton was hilarious, and told of the
mighty drunks of the olden days. Then he
became serious.
“Look here, Mr. Harden, I want you to stand
to me—that d d brakesman’s dead to the
adjective world. I’m goin’ on to the engine. As
soon as we get over the knot of the hill old Jack’ll
whistle for brakes. Just crowd it on for all you’re
worth, and stick to it tight. I’ll come back over'
the trucks, putting down the brakes as I come,
or we’ll have a bolt down the other side, and
perhaps a smash, and I’ve got a small wife and a
large family at home. Pity we’re all drunk.”
Harden grew anxious. Merton was not fit to
go climbing over the trucks filled with stock. It
wants a cool head and a strong hand for that—and
Merton couldn’t walk straight. A cold sweat
broke out over Harden, and he was just going to
propose that they get old Jack to stop at the top,
but he heard the end door of the van banged too,
and it was too late. Merton had gone.
He walked to the recess and saw that the
ratchet of the hand-brake was working freely.
What was to be would be, he thought, and looked
out of the side window. The land was flooded in
moonlight, they were half-way up the grade, and
down below, the Aparima wound away like a
ribbon of silver.
The door at the far end of the van was suddenly
opened, and Harden’s heart gave a leap of joy.
He would be able to get Merton to stop at the
top how slowly the train was going ! Good
heavens!
It was not Merton. It was a tall, burly man in
a kmckerbocker suit, carrying about a dozen trout
on a piece of flax. His face was flushed, his
clothes were covered with mud, and the water ran
out of his clothes and squirted from his boots as he
strode down the van.
C H ;^ den bad read in the morning paper a big
headline about an escaped lunatic, but he had not
troubled about the details—and here the lunatic
He would be firm. He stepped out boldly :
Well, where are you off to, my man ?”
The man in knickerbockers wiped the water out
of his eyes and looked at him.
“Bully Harden—hoo-blanky-ray!” he whooped.
“ Yes, Mr. Harden—that’s my name.”
Well, you’re the bloke whose neck I promised
to snap like a carrot, aren’t you ? ”
"I no ’ m y fl ood man > you are mistaken ! ”
Oh, yes, you are—you’re the Pilgrim of Peace
cur who walloped little Leslie. Take that, you
damned ruffian ! ” and he bashed Harden across
the face with the bundle of trout.
It was a mighty blow, and it knocked Harden
back into the window recess. Jones rushed in to
get to close quarters, but Harden stuck out his leg
and it caught the Labor Saver under the breast-
bone add sent him to the floor.
Quick as Harden was, Jones was quicker. He
rolled over and sprang to his feet, and dealt
Harden a right-hander on the ribs as he did so.
Harden had never seen Jones to his knowledge,
while the Relieving Officer had seen him frequently
as he passed the Port in his journeys to the north.
Harden’s ignorance of the personality of his
assailant made him desperate, and had he had fire-
arms Jones’s brilliant career had ended suddenly
that night.
But he had nothing, and the muddy apparition
came at him with 12 fish and a savage resolution
that really seared Harden. He yelled loudly for
help but the rumble and rattling of the train and
voice 6 P^ antine snorts the engine drowned his
There was not much time to yell. He was
bashed and banged unmercifully. He had been
knocked down on a box of eggs which had burst
all over him. Iwice he had been sent bump on
to the drunken fireman, who cursed and rolled
over But Jones had overdone it. He had just
finished an exciting four miles cross-country con-
test with the ranger, and his strength was giving
out, and Harden was fresh. He defended himself
with skill, and Jones knew that he must knock
him out in the next few minutes. Harden soon
discovered that his weird-looking assailant was
weakening and commenced to make counter
attacks. He got to holts and tried to drag the
.Labor Saver to the door to heave him out, but
that was hopeless. The Labor Saver was like a
wild beast.
.Be gripped Harden by the collar and pounded
him savagely, and then with a mighty rip tore off
his silk vest and shirt.
Harden retaliated by tearing the front out of
Jones s raiment. Then they rolled over and over
tearing and ripping all they could. When they
staggered to their feet they were both hampered
j u j rags t^iat clun & round them. Harden
dashed the door open, and tried to heave Jones
through the aperture. Jones closed with him and
fell on him. This was about the eleventh round,
and it left them with practically nothing on but
their boots. The rules weren’t Queensberry—
rather a mixture of Chinaman and bulldog.
The drunken brakesman wakened up, and
stared in amazement at the sight. Then he shut
his eyes to see if he could still discern it. Sud-
denly, the train seemed to stop momentarily and
to make a mighty leap backwards. Jones and
Harden clung to one another in a frenzy of terror.
“ The couplings have parted ! ” “ We’ve broken
away 1 ” they shrieked, simultaneously, and each
hung on to the other to keep him from the brake,
the application of which meant instant destruc-
tion, as the van was in front and the avalanche of
trucks behind.
* * * *
When Driver Jack realised his train had broken
away, he let go both his whistles for all he was
worth, and the screeching attracted attention
where it was most Wanted. The S.M. hurried
across to the platform and saw that everything
was clear, and the surfacemen’s wives above the
bridge rushed out and took the babies from
between the rails. Then the runaway trucks
went roaring past, over the bridge and away down
into the hollow where the station was, and came
to a standstill on the level at the top of the incline
beyond.
Jack came back cautiously with his engine and
solitary truck. Merton was still thanking his
gods that Harden hadn’t put on the brake, and
the S.M. and the surfacemen jumped on the foot-
plate, and in two seconds they were in the van.
There they found one tall battered man with no-
thing On but a boot, and with twelve desperately
trodden-on trout in his hand. Mechanically Jones
had gathered up his fish like a true sportsman
when he saw death in the near distance. There
was also a tall battered man dressed in two boots
and a wild expression, but with no fish.
The latter was the reformed Harden.
He never assaulted anybody afterwards.

STOMACH TROUBLES
Bile Beans Bring Prompt Relief
THE stomach is a very important organ, and when in
a disordered condition, a multitude of ailments are
the result. No other organ is taxed to such an extent
as the stomach, and it is only natural that occasion arises
when it calls for some assistance in performing the heavy
duties allotted to it. Bile
Beans afford this assist-
ance, and enable the
stomach to continue per-
forming its natural func-
tions. Mr. H. E. Neville,
of 52 Addison-road, Mar-
rickville, Sydney, writes:
“I have much pleasure in
testifying to the merits of
Bile Beans. I suffered with
terrible pains in my side
and stomach, for which I . .. „
used several so-called remedies, but could gain no re .
A friend recommended Bile Beans, and presented me wit
a few to try. These I tried, and gained almost instant
relief. Thus encouraged, I purchased a further supply,
and, after taking four doses, the pains left me entirely, and
I have had no return of the malady, I can with confidence
recommend Bile Beans to anyone similarly afflicted.

Upon the Hills.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE is a nobler, purer air
Upon the hills ;
An atmosphere—a breath so rare
My being thrills
With the delights of living !
There is no rancor and no strife —
No malice here;
One borders on the better life,
Where strong wills steer
Past doubting and misgiving.
The noble gums sway down their heads—
To me they murmur gravely ;
The spiders spin their fairy threads,
And loop their grass-stalks bravely ;
And I —l think what I should think —
Of purest patriotism ;
Australia’s own warm breath I drink —
Afar from sham and schism !
The rivers wind them back and forth,
And breezes blow
Out of the balmy, tree-topped north,
And then I know
How grand a country mine is.
The essence of the Bush instils
A hope that I
May sleep for aye upon these hills
When last I die,
And have my humble finis.
Australia’s heart is beating here—
O gracious Land of Glory ;
Her mighty soul is pulsing clear
Upon this promontory.
Here at his ease a man might sleep
Within her bosom vernal—
And hear her life-blood throbbing deep !
And take his rest eternal.
O land of mine, I do aspire,
Each living day,
To catch your cadences of fire
In some swift way,
And be your chiefest singer.
You need an arch-interpreter—
Born of the soil—
To carry your sweet voice of myrrh
To those who toil,
Yet you your message linger.
There is a stirring in the heart _
Of those born of your passion ;
O that I had the minstrel art
To stir them in some fashion !
I’d waken all the dormant love
Of country hidden in them ;
Gum-boughs that sing and sway above—
Give me the power to win them !
Upon the hills I sing a song
That some may hear
In some far city’s distant throng
Or other where,
And set their true hearts beating
Eor her, our Mother of the Bush,
Serene and grand—
The goddess of the great hills’ hush
Our own dear land,
Who sends her children greeting !
Upon the hills I sing a song—
Straight from the heart it gushes,
Like some vast river swift and strong
From its deep source it rushes.
I sing the song of Liberty
The song Australia tells me
To send from these far hills to ye—
As loyalty impels nie !

GRANT HERVEY.
The Coward.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS Evans unfastened the gate that even-
ing on his return from the colliery, his
mood was very bitter. He was a small,
timid man, and keenly aware of bis constitutional
failing. And now, in spite of his caution, what
he had dreaded for so long was, perforce, thrust
upon him. And the very worst man in the
colliery, big Charley Ryan-ah, well he knew
what would be the result of the fight to-morrow
He knocked viciously at the door, and Mrs.
Evans, divining in one quick glance Ins ill-humor,
let him in silently. Contrary to custom, he did
not enjoy his tea; the thought of the coming
ordeal had taken full possession of his weak, little
mind. And when his wife left him later in the
evening to visit her people, he sat down to nurse
his terror. Which, of course, made it worse. His
memory would not be stilled on the subject of the
Ryan-Briggs fight, six weeks ago Gruesome
details obtruded themselves, principally of Briggs
bleeding face and broken nose. And the funny
thing to Evans’ timorous spirit was that Briggs,
after his defeat, could laugh and shake hands
with the man who had disfigured him. Big
brutes like this were evidently insensible to pain.
But he was not built that way, and he wondered
shrinkingly how it would feel. Thirteen stone of
baresark Irishman scientifically concentrated into
one darting fist. Plainly a thing to be feared.
He knew himself for a coward, and the knowledge
made him bitter against the normal man, who lias
naught but contempt for this failing. He might
sham sick to-morrow—but it would only put on
the evil day. And his thoughts turned to Death,
as to a protecting friend. How he wished he
could go to sleep and never wake. The ticking of
the clock irritated him with its ceaseless suggestion
of the inevitable to-morrow. Tick—tick—tick-
damn the thing ! He rose, and m his fit of nervous
temper drove his fist through the clock face, and
swept it, a whirring protest of released machinery,
to the floor. The gfass cut his hand, but he was
past fear now ; at another time the sight of his
own blood would have made him sick. And
suddenly his eye rested upon a . means of escape.
It lay on the mantel loaded in six chambers,. He
nicked it up, and peered, fascinated, into the
cylinders, whence tie ugly little bullets peeped
hie adders One pull, and Ryan’s brutal strength
cS> totrouble him, And there is little
doubt, but that this fantastic coward would have
fiddled about with the venomous little weapon,
until induced by sheer terror, he had shot him-
self, but for the saving interruption of his wifes
return. He had barely time to replace the pistol
on the shelf when she entered, She saw the
broken clock, and her eyes questioned him. I
wTs looking for-matches,” he said foolishly. Her
subsea uent language restored his sanity. The
wUd romance of suicide faded under her wither-
ing commonplaces about a clock worth at most
ssf6d But Re shivered as he realized how near
lt Ncx tnior nin g he went forth feeling like a con-
demned^Zn wL sees the grey dawn of his last
day on earth. And behold, upon the Stockton
An^Ryan^catclbng^^h^oGthe Sinking Evans,'
malm loike you. ’Twas this way—the bhoysi laid
foive t’wan ye’d not turrn up to-day, ye d be so
sheared. An’ ye’ve won me two-poun -ten be yer
pluck. B’ gob, Oi’ll shtand yez as much dhnnk
as ye can howld.” , _ ,
The revulsion of feeling dazed Evans tor a
moment. And then rage, the rage of the sheep,
seized him. The unspeakable agony of the pre-
vious night, the numb despair of the morning,
could never be forgotten. And this grinning fool
had made two pounds ten out of it. He hit out
as he never dreamed he could hit. Ryan did not
expect it, and took it on the angle of the jaw. He
dropped, and Evans, hardly realising the knock-
out, stood over him with spasmodically-clenched
fists, murder glaring from his eye. At length the
Irishman showed signs of life. He looked owlistily
at the fists of his conqueror and grinned weakly.
“ F’r a little wan,” he declared “ yer a wonder.
No ! Oi’ll not kill yez—’twas me own fault, an Oi
bear no malice. Let me up an’ shake hands. Yer
the furrust mahn that ever knocked out Charles
Ryan. An’ Oi think ye’ll be the last.” And so
the episode closed in the bar of a small pub. at
Stockton, whence, a little elevated by beer and
pride, Evans departed arm-in-arm with Ryan a
quarter of an hour later for his day’s work in the
darkness of the pit. . .
“ I fought big Ryan to-day,” said Evans to his
wife that evening—“knocked him clean out.”
“Serve the big brute right,” replied Mrs.
Evans indignantly, “to fight a man o’ your size.
It only shows what pluck will do.”
Evan hesitated a while. “Ryan’s not a bad
sort,” he at length admitted magnanimously;
“he bears no malice whatever.”
HOWARD ASHTSON.
In a Restaurant.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was five minutes past one and they
were in the very thick of the dinner rush.
Everywhere there was the hum of talk,
scraping of chairs, and rattle of knives and plates.
The proprietor’s wife—a big, red-haired, angry-
looking woman—stood in the pay-box next the
kitchen partition, taking the cash and overlooking
the work of the waitresses. Every now and then
she would slide open a window in the partition
and screech through an urgent order, or shriek
wildly about somebody’s steak or tripe.
As I waited, an anxious-looking girl fluttered
from the far corner of the room to the pay-desk
and muttered something in the red-haired lady’s
ear. The red-haired one whirled round to the
open window and bowed her head.
“Roast beef!” she screamed. “Roast beef,
you wretch —and be quick about it ! ’
Then she turned back to the desk, took two
shillings, filed the checks, and felt her back hair.
There was a sudden sound of thumping.
“ What is it ? ” she snapped, wheeling round to
the window. .
I half rose, and caught sight of a curious white
face, with black whiskers growing on it, talking
rapidly back from inside the window.
“Oh, shut up!” , . , ,
“Shut up, yourself! shouted the face, and
vanished. . , , ,
That was all I heard ; the noise had drowned
Somebody touched me on the shoulder. I turned
and found the next diner grinning at me.
“’Er ’usband,” he whispered. “ They re avin
a row. Been at it f’r the last ’arf-hour.”
I thanked him and looked round for a glass.
“ Tripe an’ onions,” wailed a girl.
The red-haired one turned to the window.
“ Tripe,” she shouted, “ tripe an’ onions.”
There was a faint cry within, as if someone had
been stabbed.
“ Tripe you fool, an’ onions 1
“ Steak two! ” howled the lady.
“ What ?” from the kitchen.
“Steak, you ass !”
In a moment the face with its whiskers was back
at the window and talking—talking its hardest,
to judge from the way its jaws moved.
“Well, shut up, then, an’ send it out!’
“ Don’t you dare to speak ! ”
“Roast beef one,” chanted a shrill voice.
“ Plum pudding two; custard two ! ”
“Go t’ blazes !” shouted the face, and disap-
peared again.
“Come here!” screamed his wife after him.
“Do you hear, you wretch, come.” passing
waitress yelped something ,at her.) “Oyster
soup two —an’ get it at once! ”
In response there was an angry yell trom
within, then shouts and sounds of scuffling.
The red-haired one stopped dead in the act of
taking a shilling, and breathed hard through her
nose. Waitresses stood motionless in the pass-
ages, and the diners, cowed into silence by the
shadow of impending tragedy, gazed at each other
and waited. The place that, a moment before,
had resembled a hungry zoo, was, in a flash, as
silent as an egg. ,
Then there was a sudden gasp of rage, and,
with a swish of silk, the proprietor’s wife swept
from the pay-box and, sobbing hysterically,
vanished round the corner.
Eour seconds of horrible silence, then the mas-
sacre began. . ,
Two screams and a howl —frenzied tramping ot
feet—more screams —thuds —slow, heavy thuds
crashes —more thuds and screams.
At the sound, the petrified waitresses came to
life again, and, dropping dishes, plates and knives,
answered with screams and cries for help, btrong,
brave men shouted and stood on chairs to get a
better view. . .
Suddenly from behind the partition an old man
staggered, and fell in the midst of the seething
mob. There was gravy on his grey hair, and
lumps of fat were clinging to his coat. _
He was dragged to his feet and questioned. _
“ She’s hitting him,” he panted ; “ she’s hitting
him with the corned beef ! ”
Instantly there was a chorus of screams that al-
most drowned the uproar within, and a kindly
waitress, crying miserably, picked the scraps of
fat off the old man and dropped them into my
glass.
For about another minute the racket proceeded.
Then something came flying through the air and
landed with a thump near me. Immediately the
ghastly thudding and howling in the kitchen
stopped, and only a subdued sound of sobbing
broke the silence that had descended like a bene-
diction upon the scene.
The old kitchenman, with a glad cry, caught up
the heavy object that had fallen near me—it was
the coined beef—and hurried behind the partition.
Out came the vengeful lady of the red hair,
hysterical and spattered with gravy, but still alive
and ready for duty. .
“ That brute !” she sobbed, “ he tried to strike
me —actually tried to strike me!” Without ex-
plaining whether he had succeeded or had perished
in the attempt, she struck her bell, and in tones of
deep emotion ordered the resumption of business.
Round the corner appeared the head and
shoulders of the old kitchenman. “ Corned beef s
orwvgain!”heyelled.

Weak and Delicate
Debilitated and Languid for Years. Health and Vigor now Fully
Restored. Most Remarkable Cure.
m
/
Mrs. Mabel Boulton, of Turbot
St., Brisbane, Queensland, sends
us her photograph, and says:
“From my infancy I was weak
and delicate, and grew to be any-
thing but a robust child, suffering
from debility, no appetite, and
the usual consequences of such
complaints. But my parents,
hearing of the health-restoring
properties of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla,
procured some for me, and I am
happy to say that after having
taken two bottles I regained
health and vigor, and a good
appetite, and have not troubled
the doctors since. I am now
married and have a family of my
own, am strong and well, and can
recommend Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
as a good family medicine.”
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is certainly a splendid family medicine. It is just as
good for the child as for the parent. The only diiference is in the dose.
The thin, pale schoolgirl is as much benefited as her tired, nervous mother.
The rapidly growing boy, weak and languid, is as promptly aided as his
overworked and overanxious father. Keep this grand medicine in the house.
A dose at the right time will often save a long and expensive sickness.
All Sarsaparillas are not alike. Look out for that. Avoid the many
substitutes and imitations. Insist upon getting “ Ayer’s.”
