This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably'
known Dispensary that now boars his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the loading colleges
and hospitals of Europe, lie has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi!
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who sutler from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness daring

irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes?
bash fulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back, Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the cars and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which load to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary exponce. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case lias
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. Ho will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a kst of care Cull y-pfe-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by Are.
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treat ed
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

X am aware Hint I am not stviol.l, following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
S| ecinlist for the t eatm-nt of this class of disc so. but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia (he
apatiiy shown by bna'ilh'.i lira in the treatment of
Ciironic and Nervous (cinplainls has induced men of 1 lie
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Unity Telegraph, Nov.
6th Ith and t-th. 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed Of their money but what is of infl .iteiy
greater importance, their health is injured also, It is
therefore time that I.('gaily Qualified Men entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly imposv ble for those who are suffering
from the-e diseases, who arc soattm od over ell parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not n.ly
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, but T also add
to the usefulness of rug profession and in no tuny lessen my
personal dignity,
Mv Qualifications I invite tin, fullest Investigation info. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon io the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of oiservin ; the many phases of the Nervous a id
Sexua 1 Svstem, and to be; onve acquainted with the most scientific methods ot ehectuig then; cure.
Mv sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults mo he is informed at Ihe
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with raise and specious promises, and
If I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete ami permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.
