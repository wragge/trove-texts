The New Theatre
Huntly Carter made a pilgrimage through
Europe, seeking The New Spirit in Drama
and Art (Palmer), and brought back im-
pressions of post-impressionism in art, much
information of new devices fo*r the improve-
ment of the theatre, and a sense of the
tremendous importance of rhythm in the
modern drama. Art and the drama in Europe,
we learn in our placid Australian biliabong,
is in a state of portentous ferment; especi-
ally do we note that in the simple matter of
the mechanical adjuncts of staging and light-
ing we and our theatrical managers in Aus-
tralia are in the theatrical Stone Age.
Recognising that the theatre and drama
of England are in a transition state, Huntly
Carter examined the ideas now being experi-
mented upon in the chief art centres of
Europe, especially the attempt to evolve a
new type of theatre, a new stage and a- new
setting. His own dramatic ideal, it is as
well to note, as it tinged all that he saw, is
a national drama comprising :
A rhythmic conception of play, player,
decoration and music. This drama will' be
represented in a rhythmic form of theatre.
Everything henceforth is to be orchestrated
to produce a single but infinitely varied
total effect. We need a stage which lends
itself to the simple and single vision, that
brings even the most unintelligent spectator
into the action of the drama and holds him
there, that promotes a direction of effort on
the part of all concerned which will unify
the results.
But he found that Europe was searching
for artistic rather than rhythmic results.
“The pioneers of the new movement are
chiefly concerned with attaining artistic sim-
plification, unity and suggestion.”
As for the modern realistic drama, Huntly
Carter decides that, biologically consid-
ered, it is a complete failure. He points out
that the disillusionists did not go far enough.
They attempted to represent degeneracy— :
marked deviation from an original type, as
seen in an unhealthy offspring—by actors
physically and beautifully normal. The
stigmata of degeneracy were missing, though
the mental imperfection was ably repre-
sented.
They wrote up the diseased fragments of
social iife, and they engaged normal types
to represent them, either because they had
not the biological knowledge requisite to
complete their undertaking, or because they
had not the courage to scour our infirmaries,
hospitals and lunatic asylums for the real
thing. .. .Their stage families have not even
a nose in common. . . .So to-day we are faced
with a disenfranchised drama confronting a
theatre whereon is written: “This house
is a house of art; but ye have it a den
of disease.” Ibsen, for example, has never
recovered from Mr. Bernard Shaw’s victim-
isation of him. Together with Shakespeare,
he was butchered to make a Fabian holiday.
The drama that the theatre needs, accord-
ing to Huntly Carter, is “a symbolic, social
and cosmic drama, not a drama of the debat-
ing-hall and the dissecting-room.” So off he
started to track it down iii Europe.
In Paris he found Bergson, classic revi-
vals and the artistic movement in the the-
atre. There he found The Blue Bird pro-
duced with infinitely more artistic effects
than it was possible to give in London —and
presumably in Australia. Owing to lack of
modern staging methods, the Parisian produc-
tion was inferior to its first production at
the Artistic Theatre in Moscow. As the
third version pleased Australian audiences,
what must the Moscow' presentation have
been like?
In Germany. Reinhardt, the producer in
London of ' “The Miracle,” rules. And
everywhere on the Continent the question
how the drama shall be housed and.staged in
the most efficient and artistic -manner is fore-
most. Reinhardt gets his effects by the em-
ployment of four modern innovations: the
revolving stage, the round or concave horizon
formed by a white concrete wall enveloping
the stage, the new system of horizon and
centre-stage lighting, and the use of a stage
entirely cleared of conventional canvas
scenery. The first offers a solution to the
problem of quick change's, expeditious hand-
ling of scenes, and act-division. The second
adds appropriate perspective. The third
brings the back of the stage into line with
the front, and reduces the old. harsh effects
of fqotliglits and sidelights. None of these
modern innovations are in use yet in Aus-
tralia. Instead we have what looks almost
like the proud boast of Oscar Asche—or
Oscar Asche’s press agent—that in his pro-
duction of A Midsummer Night's Dream in
Melbourne a stage staff of 70 men is re-
quired—7o men, when the work could be
done by a motor and a few switchmen.
Without elaborate waits, Reinhardt staged
the second part of Faust— and the produc-
tion of this extraordinary piece of work has
been the despair of German producers ever
since Goethe completed it. For, as Huntly
Carter nicely remarks, Goethe put every-
thing into Faust 11. except drama. Rein-
hardt possesses two theatres in Berlin, and
is aided in his efforts by leading poets,
musicians, authors and stage managers.
To-day we can represent actions which a
Shakespeare, or Sophocles, or Goethe could
never attempt to express. These are tre-
mendously important actions, carried beyond
spoken language by the language of move-
ment, and the visualised scene. .. .Thus,
through its co-operation with enlightening
music and eloquent decoration, dramatic
action must attain a height undreamt of by
the ancients, as well as by those moderns
who are engaged in the fruitless task of
adapting old forms of drama to the new
forms of representation.
The Ilebbel Theatre is mentioned as an
Edition de luxe —the last word, for the mom-
ent, in theatre building. And all through
Germany there are others. In several the
Fortuny system of lighting is employed
In consists, technically, of two parts—a
dome and a system of lighting, which can,
however, be used without the dome. The
object of the system is to obtain the effects
of natural sunlight either in direct rays or
diffused. These effects are obtained by the
use of an absolutely white light thrown on
to bands of colored _silk that act as reflectors,
and so diffuse the light over the whole scene.
It has many advantages over the present
system. It does aw'ay with the present un-
satisfactory method of obtaining a sky pers-
pective. by throwing colored limelight directly
on a white-washed wall or revolting back-
ground, and offers instead a method that
produces a wonderful illusion of a far-reach-
ing perspective. It eliminates the patchy
effects of the use of battens, floats and perch-
lights all over the top and sides of the stage,
and produces instead a uniform-tinted atmo-
sphere enveloping everything. Again, it dis-
penses with the use of a great deal of stage
lumber, wings, flies, etc.
The beautiful Kunstler Theatre in Munich
aims at artistic simplicity. There are no
wings, the spectators being so placed that
they cannot see behind the scenes. The
scenery is painted in monochrome and built
solid, so that the shadows from overhead
will be as natural as possible. But the
scenes, the investigator found, are too tightly
held by the decorative stationary frame.
The decorative movement in Vienna has
given birth to the Viennese Theatrical Cos-
tume and Scenic Studio. Its efforts to repro-
duce beauty on the stage are largely on the
lines of the Kunstler Theatre, Munich, wdiich
is actively engaged in putting frames on
stage pictures-
It is largely concerned with the attempt
to obtain the effects of direct light and cast
shadows, and is making interesting experi-
ments in painting and lighting scenery.
Jt
In Buda-Pesth another definite step has
beeh taken toward the artistic evolution of
the theatre. There an inventor discovered
that it is impossible to set a good landscape
on the existing stage, that stage pictures are
bound to be mannered artd unnatural, and
crowd effects inartistic, that the setting of
the scenes occupies much time, and that
owing to the narrowness of the exits and
entrances it is not possible to. bring on a
large crowd with any degree of naturalness.
So hh invented a new' stage. He got rid of
the primitive hanging backcloth by construct-
ing an immovable wall, sufficiently high and
wide to limit the sight-line of the spectator.
It could be prepared to receive any lighting
effect; he white-washed it and ingeniously
pierced it with invisible holes for star-
light effects. Then he divided his stage into
two parts, the back part close to his wall-
screen he used simply fok big panoramic
effects or for “crowds.” He constructed this
portion in three separate movable sections, by
means of which large things like ships could
approach or recede in a natural manner.
Next, in order to dispense with intervals
while scenery was changed, he constructed
his front stage in three parts, a centre and
tw'o side platforms moving on wheels. By
this means one scene can be struck and set
while another scene is being played. And
this innovation logically led to the dispensing
of side wings altogether. Then he was com-
pelled to get all his lighting from the top :
The mechanism for controlling and work-
ing this revolutionary stage is very simple
and economical, and the stage manager can
. obtain all the results lie desires by merely
moving a lever here and there. . . .It shortens
the waits. It dispenses with the use of the
conventional proscenium arch. It gives a
natural perspective to the scene. It allows
three scenes to be set at once. It promotes
economy in the use of scenery, and it gives
the scene-shifter a holiday. '
Another aspect of theatrical progress is
the remarkable growth of the open-air the-
atre in Europe. Each summer more new 7
open-air theatres are opened, and their popu-
larity is enormous. The classical, the reli-
gious, and even the contemporary drama is
played. But in a performance under these
conditions much has to be sacrificed. After
all, the conventions are necessary, and
Nature has no conventions. 1
J*
Moscow has the best organised and
equipped experimental theatre in the world ;
and, one wonders, why Moscow? The answer
is that the Moscow theatre is due to a band
of enthusiatic artistic Moscovians :
They resolved to get rid of trie ■ old-
fashioned theatre, its out-of-date plays, scen-
ery, actors and laws, and to set out in search of
new plays, new scenery, new acting and new
laws. They have found some of each.. . .Its
new naturalistic methods of acting came as
a revelation to a public long accustomed to
the old conventions of the declamatory
school. Indeed, the extraordinary attention
paid to the technique of acting, and the
over-emphasis on detail and effect, came to
most playgoers in the nature of a “new
thrill.”
It was at this dangerous stage that a new
aim came into the Moscow theatre. Its
name w r as “Stylization,” and its ideal, “To
give everything in the scene the harmonious
style of a conventional type and the immo-
bility of the ancient Greeks.” Words, ges-
tures, movements, decorations, costumes, all
were to be set vibrating in unison. But there
was one drawback to this vaguely expressed
ideal. There w'ere no plays that fully met
the demands of immobility or stylisation.
Enter Tchekoff, carrying the article in
demand: —
His peculiar genius for the stage and the
extraordinary technique of his plays, so ad-
mirably adapted to the natural methods of
the players, brought the first great success
to the Moscow theatre, upon which it has
never looked back. Tchekoff practically created
an immobile form of drama, and with his
arrival at the Moscow Theatre came a new
era of stage-production.
The theatre is admirably equipped. It
has a Very large stage provided with a revolv-
ing centre, the round or concave horizon, the
new horizon lighting. Perhaps here, says
Huntly Carter, the problems of stage-light-
ing, seen in the attempt to obtain the effect of
direct sunlight or diffused light, a truthful
distribution of light and shadow', are nearest
solution. And mentally it is still better
equipped. It took the theatre two years to
produce The Blue Bird, and, to produce
Hamlet, three years. The whole time was
occupied in experimentation. To the actors
the theatre is a university and a home. And
the theatre is now a paying concern. As
the management proposes to build a new
theatre costing £lOO,OOO, there is evidently
money in artistic ideals—in Moscow.

The New Spirit in Drama and Art is fully
illustrated wfith photographs and plans of
theatres, with daring dress designs, with
technical illustrations of staging and with a
gallery of Poet-Impressionist pictures, many
of them reproduced in color. For the reader
interested in art or the drama the book,
despite its rather rhapsodic style, will prove
of remarkable interest. Chiefly, however, is
it important in bringing home to us in w'hat
a stagnant biliabong Australia, in respect to
culture, remains. Many of these tendencies
rampant on the Continent of Europe will
doubtless tire themselves out; but the spirit
that is stirring the waters there has not yet
visited Australia. The book is especially com-
mended to theatrical architects and theatrical
managers.

An Empire prize novel competition is an-
nounced by Ilodder and Stoughton. A
sum of £lOOO will be divided into four prizes
of £250 each for the best novel submitted
from a resident or native of, respectively,
Canada, Australasia, India, and British
Africa, the latter title to include any colony
or dependency not included under the other
heads. Competitors for the £250 offered for
the best Australasian novel must be
Australasians by birth, or by . residence
of not less than one year, though not
necessarily resident now. MSS. must
be marked “Competition,” and be re-
ceived by Hodder and Stoughton. St.
Paul’s House, Warwick Square,,London, E. 0,.
England, by March 31, 1914, must not be
more than 150,000 words in length—SO,ooo-
- is recommended, and must be accom-
panied by a form to be obtained from Hodder
and Stoughton on request. The decision
will lie announced in TnE Bookman. The
final adjudicator for Australasia will be
Charles Garvice. One wonders why Gar-
vice? ITe is the author who has a “girl” or
“Cupid” or “love” in every title of his manv
novels, and turns out his two hookloads of
sentimental slush per annum with an ease
that does not inspire us with much respect,
for his critical or judicial abilities. Canada
has as her adjudicator Gilbert Parker ; India.
A. E. W. Mason; and Africa, etc.. Rider
Haggard—=all authors of repute, and all with
some connection with the countries assigned
to them. There is no evidence that Garvice
ever was in Australasia. In a recent
“colonial” special number of The Book-
man, his name is not mentioned. The selec-
tion does not inspire respect, and doubtless
will seriously limit the Australasian com-
petitors to the writers, if we unhappily
possess any, of Garvicean sentimentality.
A new series of Art Treasures of Great
Britain, in shilling parts, is being issued bv
Dent. The aim of the publishers is to make
familiar the art. including not only pictures,
but sculpture, drawing, pottery, metal work,
ivories, and Oriental Art, in the public
museums and private collections of Great
Britain. One feature that will be appreci-
ated is the inclusion of modern work. No
too-familiar masterpieces will be reproduced.
The first volume, with reproductions in
photogravure, color and half-tone, comprises
work of Jan de Mabuse, Rembrandt, Gains-
borough, Whistler —not in color—Nardon
Penieaud (an enamel triptych), Greek sculp-
ture and an early French ivory. The mere
Philistine wonders w T hy in the early repre-
sentations of the Madonna and Child the
mother is always fully clothed and the
baby naked. Even in an Australian summer
it is considered necessary for a newly born
child to be clothed. One wonders if the old
masters ever had any families.
“The Orange Tree Series of Children’s Books”
(Constable) includes two stories republished from
Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Wonder Book for Boys and
Girls (1851) and three children's stories by Dickens.
The latter are admirably and humorously illlustrated
in color and line.
The Commercial Artist
Spake W alter Jardine, aged 28, back f rnm
a bnet study in commercial art in the r, ; ,
States and London:— e Lmte «i
I was in America for three months and in
London tor two; but I had to cut mv f
snort owing to my inability to stand th
extremes ot climate in America The \
Students’ League of New York is the finest
school 1 know' of. There everything is tauetir
and practically everv well-known illustm„(
and commercial artist in America has nawH
through this well-equipped school. Person
ally 1 found invaluable the classes on lil us '
tration and Composition, Costume Sketching
and Anatomy. g
Lor the Australian art student who wants
to be an illustrator or commercial artiste-
poster and catalogue work —I should recom-
mend three years’ study in America For
illustration work the Art Students’ League
New York; for commercial art, Chicago’
This city specialises: there is, for instance’
a special firm for tailoring artists, liut a
good way would be for the Australian stu-
dent to start in San Francisco and work
east. He could begin by trying for a job in
an advertising firm or a firm of artists, start-
ing as an “improver” ; and with the experi-
ence he would get, it should be easy fdr him
to Work his way up. An improver is a copy-
ist of other artists’ wmrk for his firm.
As for his chances, a young commercial
artist in good repute in Australia would be
a second or thud-rater on Ins arrival in
America ; but after tw r o or three years’ work
he could easily hold his own. V was told
that in my line, as a suiting artist, I was the
equal to any of the Americans except Leyen-
deeker, who is the only top-notcher. 1 did
very well indeed at piece work, the pay of
which is three times as great as that in Aus-
tralia. But it is as well to admit that, just
as in England, in the U.S. it is necessary to
have some influence to get' in. I knew a
chap on the New York World, and through
him 1 soon got plenty of Work for advertising
tirms. But the climate !
The scope for advertising work is enor-
mous. What is regarded as a small order
for a catalogue is 500,000 copies; and the
house of Kuppenheimer orders millions of
catalogues at a time—and they are works of
art.
If an Australian commercial artist can
stand the climate he would be a fool, speak-
ing from a purely monetary view-point, to
come back to Australia. Unless, of course,
he wants the honor an<J glory of pioneering
commercial work here. 1 Why c-an’t the Aus-
tralian commercial artist make good here?
First, the etching is against the
machines, but the etcher. The Australian
etcher is usually a good workman, but the
American etcher is invariably an artist.
Next, the printing here is not up to the
standard of America. And, finally, the Aus-
tralian commercial artist has the Australian
business man to contend against. This in-
dividual has not been educated up to the
advertising value of good work, and simply
won’t pay * for it. There are, however, a
few firms who do know' that the extra £lOO
they pay is going to bring them in an extra
£lOOO. And that extra £lOO. distributed
between the artist, the etcher and the printer,
will give him a job that w T ill have almost
the appearance of the best and most fascin-
ating American wmrk.
That Australians can hold their own was
quite evident to me. I met several who were
"making good.” Busson, on the N. Y. Times,
draw's a salary of £l2 for four days’ work a
week, and is free to do any outside work he
likes. Alek Sass, on N. Y. World, is doing
very well; but, then, he possesses a distinc-
tive style, and anybody possessed of a dis-
tinctive style and good draughtsmanship can
do remarkably well in the U.S. In com-
mercial art, Harry Weston would swiftly
make his name famous, while for illustration
work Norman Lindsay has only to arrive to
be engaged at top prices. There are only
tw'o possible competitors to him in America
—Orson Lowell, of N. Y. Life, and the
climate.
l r es. it’s a great training ground for any
student: the rew’ards are sure, and our men
can easily hold their own; but. personally,
the climate over there is.. . .well, that’s just
w'liat it is.

Talbragar, Dubbo,
Jan. 6, 1913.
Dear Sirs, —It is now
about four months since
your Air Gas Machine was
installed in my residence.
Its efficiency has exceeded
all expectations; for light,
economy, cleanliness, as well
as for cooking purposes, it is
the best that I know of. My
20-Light Machine provides
sufficient light for all pur-
poses, in addition to supply-
ing gas for the stove. To be
able to do all cooking by gas
in a country home at a
moderate cost is a con-
venience that must appeal to
anyone making a gas instal-
lation, esnecially when do-
mestic help is at such a
premium. Wishing you all
the success that your machine
merits. —I am. yours faith-
fully, (Sgd.) F. 0. WAKE.

STOP
SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Ividnev Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.

Helene: A Lover’s Curse.
Helene hath murdered love, and therefore
she
Shall find on earth nor love nor charity ;
When love she craves, then fast and ever
faster
Upon her soul irreparable disaster
Shall fall, and sick with misery she shall
learn
How a heart breaks, how cruel and how
stern,
And oh, how lonelv is a world unfilled
By Love, now lying dead beyond return,
The love that she has killed.
Helene hath slain sweet Cupid, and for this
Shall Cupid’s mother cast her out from bliss
Into the darkness, full of vows unspoken,
Hopes unfulfilled, and all things bruised and
broken ;
The void wherein are death and mould and
rust,
The grave to which all sterile blooms are
thrust,
Where souls long damned lie laughing, ev'n
as I,
To see love trampled lifeless in the dust,
The love she made to die.
Helene kissed once, and would not kiss
anew,
So shall she go unkissed her whole life
through
By any true-love kiss, but she shall languish
With loveless kisses that are only anguish ;
In every lip that seeks her lip at night
Venom shall lurk, and little adders bite ;
But true love’s nectar shall be in them
never,
Because, although kissed once to mad de-
light,
She w r ould not kiss for ever.
Helene, your eyes are fountains whence
shall flow
The salty tears of wretchedness and woe ;
Dim they shall be with all the aching sorrow
Of sad to-day and dread of dark to-morrow.
When on the sunless path of years to come
You see no golden ray, and all is dumb
Save that owls hoot, ghosts shriek and pale
mouths whine;
Then, then you shall recall how cold and
lxumb
You left this love of mine.
Helene, I see a bruise on your white breast.
A broken heart that suffers without rest.
I see upon your longing and your hope
Fate pounce, a hangman with a knotted
rope;
Yea, things more horrible and grim and
hard
Wait on your footsteps, and you cannot
guard
Your soul from them by any feeble crying
Because so ruthlessly you struck and marred
Sweet Love when he came sighing.
Helene, the curse is on you even now.
Avenging Venus leans with heavy brow
Over your sun-bright head : therefore beware
The poisoned sting in every kiss you share :
Make ready for sharp sorrow: brace-your
heart
Against the pain of breaking: for the smart
Of burning tears prepare your frightened
eyes;
Since cruelly you left to die apart
The love that slaughtered lies.
A lover, who for one brief hour was given
A glimpse of Paradise, a hope of Heaven
By his dear mistress; but was soon dis-
dained
Since in her heart an icy prudence reigned—
Lo, where in cool, sweet loveliness you lie.
Mocking I say farewell: and laughter high,
And wrath, and scornful hate are in my
verse:
And though such laughter into tears be nigh.
Laughing I speak this curse.
N.S.W.
ADAM M‘CAY.
Clandestine Love.
I slink along the shaded lanes,
I shun the lighted street,
I go to most excessive pains,
To try and be discreet.
I do not walk with Alice fair
In open ways by day.
Because some people strolling there
Might have a lot to say.
I shirk the radiance of the sun,
The open pathways green.
In such bright spots by anyone
We never have been seen.
I cannot walk with my twin soul
As other lovers do;
Upon the beach we never stroll.
In daylight never woo.
I do not write to her address.
She does not write to mine !
Of correspondence I confess
No one has seen a sign.
We speak of Love in whispers low.
I’m married and discreet.
And She is married, you must know,
This lady that I meet.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/' is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any
part of the contents of this number is hereby ex-
pressly reserved by the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read, and, where prac-
ticable, acknowledge in the “ Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the form
of Political, Social or other Articles, Verse. Short
Tales or Sketches (those dealing with Australian sub-
jects, and not exceeding two columns in length, or,
say, SOOO words, are specially acceptable), Paragraphs,
Letters or Newspaper Clippings. All communications
will be regarded as strictly confidential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when
the address is specified and stamps are enclosed. But
no MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these
conditions are observed. When MS. is forwarded with-
out stamps for return it will be understood that the
copy is to be destroyed if not acceptable. Personal
applications for return of MS. cannot receive atten-
Don. The Bulletin desires, further, those sending
MS. to distinctly understand that it is not respon-
sible for the preservation or transmission of MS.

Anyone supplying to The Bulletin original

sufficient merit and interest and adapted for direct

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AND
THE CAMEL CORPS.
J. C. Watson, ex-Prime Minister, has
spoken a word which, though it may or
may not express the opinions of those in
the Federal Ministry, is full of danger.
According to the former leader and present
guide of the Labor party, there is no need
for a transcontinental north-and-south rail-
way for some time, the Territory being best
developed from its own ports. If there must
be railways, let them, he says, be constructed
within the Territory itself; but the expendi-
ture on a great railway from North to South
is something against which the late Labor
leader feels called to protest—and, signifi-
cantly, lie made his protest at a function
given by the Commonwealth Government,
whose representative present —the Minister
in charge of Territory affairs —had no subse-
quent word of reproach to offer. Moreover,
Watson was careful to preface his remarks
with a statement that men in active poli-
tics might not care to say such things on the
eve of a general election, thus leaving it to
be clearly inferred both that he knew his
opinions to be secretly shared by Federal
Ministers, and that such opinions were un-
popular among Australians to the extent of
alienating votes. It was a damning admis-
sion. and one which goes far to rob Watson
of whatever title he formerly possessed to
be classed among broad and clear-sighted
Australian statesmen.
* * » #
The development of the Northern Terri-
tory from its own ports has been going on
for half a century, the opportunities for
settlement have always been great, the ad-
ministration by South Australia did nothing
to retard, even if it did little to advance, the
progress of the country, and yet the white
population, exclusive of the large number
of officials lately dumped into Darwin, is
only about one to 400 square miles. Wat-
son admits that the chief port lies right in
the track of navigation, and it may fairly
be said that the Territory has always hail
as much in the way of shipping facilities as,
in its state of development, it could expect;
yet the plea is seriously put forward that the
means which have hitherto failed to settle
the country will now succeed. When an ex-
periment has had a trial of 50 years or
more, and does not make good, it would seem
reasonable to cast about for other methods;
and the strongly-expressed ooinion of every
recent visitor to the North, who has gone
there without prejudice, is that the trans-
continental railway is the method that
holds out the most promise. To say that
such a railway will carry little produce in
its earlier years is to say nothing. The rail-
way is required to develop the trade which
it will afterwards carry. By sea, Darwin
is at present 15 days distant from Mel-
bourne. The completion of the overland
railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek can
reduce this easily to 80 hours. Practically,
Darwin is now as remote from our centres
' of population as Ceylon or the islands of the
Central Pacific. Direct railway communi-
cation can bring the return journey within
the scope of a single week. In that differ-
ence lies the exact and specific reason why
the Territory is still without population.
Australian settlers have a perfectly reason-
able and natural objection to isolating them-
selves in a place that, through lack of rail-
way facilities, is so distant from centres of
Australian thought and feeling that it is, to
all intents and purposes, a foreign country.
Developed from its natural ports alone, the
Territory might, in two generations, have
the population of a Federal constituency;
linked by railway with the present settled
areas, it might, in a single generation, be
the richest and most prosperous seventh of
the Commonwealth. The transcontinental
railways of the American continent were
not required, in the first place, to carry the
goods and produce of the Pacific seaboard
to Boston and New York; but their con-
struction induced settlement, created trade
and gave a fillip to the western portion of
the country which could have come in no
other way. In the same manner, no one
contends that the transcontinental railway
is intended, primarily, to carry to Adelaide
the gold, pearlshell and bSche-de-mer obtained
in the North, or to bring cattle or wool to
a southern market; but it is contended, and
rightly, that the railway will cause settle-
ment, which will make trade, which will,
eventually, pay many times over the cost of
construction.
Were the object of the Commonwealth
solely and only the settlement of the North-
ern Territory, Watson’s remarks about de-
velopment from its own ports would show
an utter lack of statesmanlike nower to
grasp the situation ; but the Territory means
more to the Federation than that. Aus-
tralia’s tremendous danger lies in its empty
lands which face the great ports of Asia,
and are, in sailing distance, actually nearer
to them than to the cities of Australia. If
the black-and-tan races gain a foothold on
this continent, it will be through the front
garden of the North ; and once any consid-
erable number of Asiatics is lodged in any
part of the continent, our dream of a White
Australia is gone, .and the pollution, spread-
ing southward, will paint itself in tragic
human colors across every State. If our
lands remain unsettled, alien incursions
that are without any sort of international
significance may be as destructive as a regu-
lar invasion, and for either invasion or pri-
vate incursion, the coast of Northern Aus-
tralia must be watched and guarded. The
settlers of the Northern Territory must be
the frontier garrison of our race, and for
purposes of defence a transcontinental rail-
way must be constructed that will enable the
more populous States to support that garri-
son, and put up the largest possible sort of
scrap against any invader. The railway to
Darwin is thus, first of all, needed for de-
fence purposes, and so urgent is the matter
of its construction that even now it may be
too late. A distance of 3077 miles separ-
ates Oodnadatta and Pine Creek, and pushed
ahead at the rate of a mile per day it would
be three years before the rails were linked
up. Allowing for a widening of existing
gauges, and the delays which always have
to be taken account of, it would be much
more likely to be seven years before troops
could be conveyed in smartest time to the
point of danger. And seven years is a very
long time when you already hear the enemy
sharpening his gun and whetting his powder.
When the enemy batters at the Darwin
gate, and our citizen soldiers rush to shake
off his death-grip, there are two ways in
which they may cross the continent. One is
by railway, the other by camel. All Aus-
tralia is to-day divided into two camps on
the great matter of defence. There are the
railway men and the camel men—the men
who believe that preparation by modern
methods is the best safeguard of our shores,
and the men who are ready to trust to luck
and send a few small boys on camel-back to
look for the enemy when he has already made
good his landing. It is pitiful to see J. C.
Watson throw to the winds his larger Aus-
tralian views and join the camel corps. It
is quite true that it is of ships, and not
camels, that he talks, but it comes to just
the same thing; for if the Northern Terri-
tory is to depend on ships for its develop-
ment, Australia must depend upon the evil-
smelling beast for its defence. But worse
than Watson’s desertion of the cause of
Australian defence is the hint conveyed in
hi" words that he is the free spokesman of
the Federal Ministers whose tongues are
tied because an election is near. Is this to
be interpreted that the transcontinental rail-
way is no more than an election trick, and
that the men in power are prepared to play
fast and loose with a matter of such vital
national concern? It must be bitterly con-
fessed that every action of Fisher’s Minis-
try in its dealing with Northern Territory
matters gives form and color to the hint
conveyed in the ex-Prime Minister’s speech.
If it is really the case that the transconti-
nental railway is to be indefinitely hung up
at the bidding of alleged statesmen who are
too blind to see its urgency and importance,
it F time that the people whose, votes rule
the coming election said something on the
matter. What The Bulletin wants, what
every thoughtful citizen of the Commonwealth
wants, is a direct statement from Fisher,
given without hedging or shuffle, as to
whether he also has thrown over the cause
of Australia and joined the camel corps.
And lest his answer, if satisfactory, should
be regarded as merely having relation to the
elections, he might also mention the exact
date at which he will have a thousand men
working on the line.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Sydney Ferry Hold-up.
Whatever else comes out of the strike of
Sydney ferry-hands which cut the city in
halves last week, this much is certain —the
traffic to Milson’s Point must be taken out
of the hands of the company that now con-
trols it. It is quite possible, no doubt, that
if the State ran the business a strike might
still happen ; but if a strike did happen the
public would at least be able to deal with
the responsible parties. If the Government
was to blame, the public could punish that
Government and eject it. In any case, it
would have a voice in the selection of the
responsible Government. That Government
would represent the people, so far as our
system allows, and that fact alone would be
calculated to prevent any such extreme
action as the ferry hands took last week.
Though N. S. Wales certainly has had one
short-lived tramway strike, the State rail-
ways have never been hung up in all their
long history. The public has, on the other
hand, no say whatever in the choice of the
directors of the Ferry companies, and no
control whatever over them. These men
and their managers v be the most grasp-
ing and unreasonable and irritating men to
be found in the country. The shareholders
who choose them look to them to make divi-
dends ; that is their principal job. The
chances are, therefore, that they wilt be
money-grubbing, endangering the public
convenience and safety for the sake of sav-
ing sixDence here and threepence there. And
if convenience and safety are sacrificed, the
public has no redress against them. It
cannot eject them from their seats on the
Board; on the contrary, since the biggest
parcels of shares are most likely held by the
Fattest men in the community, it is highly
probable that the more the public cries out
against these directors the better the Fattest
shareholders will think of them. This is all
utterly intolerable. The State has built
lines of railway and tramway converging at
Circular Quay on the one side of the Har-
bor and at Milson’s Point on the other, and
it has left the connection in the hands of
men who may actually get kudos for har-
assing the public. The ends of the chain
are designed to serve the public; the central
link is designed, not to serve the public, but
to make dividends for a few private people
who may have the most profound contempt
for the opinion of the public. Whatever
else may be done, the connecting link must
be promptly taken out of such hands. It is
not the time to discuss whether the general
ferry service of the Harbor should be in pri-
vate or public control. That is a larger
and more debatable question. There is one
thing obvious—so obvious that it is really
beyond debate—and that thing should be
done on the instant. A less futile man than
J. McGoweN would have done it within 24
hours of the commencement of the trouble.
The Day of the Little Nations.
Through the uprising of the Bulgarian
peasants and the Servian pig-feeders, a new
and difficult element has come into inter-
national politics. The big nations have,
through their enlightenment and civilisa-
tion. which means their love of ease and
distaste for special exertion, lost a lot of
their lighting force. The small senn-bar-
baric nations, on the other hand, appear to
have a tremendous lot of “go” in them. The
fact that these little wasps can sting, and
don’t in the least mind being stung in re-
turn, has made all Europe put a bewildered
hand to its forehead. Had England suffered
losses as great in proportion as those which
have fallen to the share of Bulgaria in the
present war, the whole country would long
ago have been mad with' hysteria. Had
Germany been killed and wounded to the
same extent, the domination of Prussia
would have been in danger, and the Imperial
throne would be shaking like a skyscraper in
an earthquake. Yet the Bulgar person goes
on with the bleeding, and will evidently see
it to the bitter end. It is the' lesson half-
learned in the Boer war. and now driven
forcibly home. Every half-civilised State is
loaded and liable to go off in both barrels, to
the great inconvenience of the diplomatic
person who thought that because it was
small it could be safely handled. From the
Australian point of view, the new develop-
ment is full of hope and full of danger. It
means that, few as we are, if we are in dead
earnest, and get all our shooting machinery
and transit and other arrangements in pro-
per order, most people will be afraid to speak
unpleasantly to us; but it also means that
we have not merely to fear a great Jap in-
vasion, or the mighty hosts of a China
awakened to life and power, but that any
one of the little barbaric nations of Asia
may rise to sudden strength and challenge
our right to hold the part of this continent
that we have not yet learned to use. Big
nations might count the cost; smaller
nations —and they are mighty big nations
when their numerical strength is compared
with our own —might regard success as
cheap at the expense of three-quarters of
their blood and all their treasure.
The AVfrite Man in the Pacific.
Tuus Australia’s Minister for Defence r
F. Pearce, in the Australasian £ ’ G-
and Military Annual (just issued
The Australian ideal is that there shnnla i
the defence of British interests a strong ?> e for
fleet, jointly contributed to by each n 1 acitic
having interests in the Pacific providing 9 r? mini °n
taming a fleet unit which, together with main '
force which the Government of the United 8 ?/ naval
may see fit to maintain there, would form lng ? om
for the defence of British interests in th? 135
in time of danger. rac 'nc
With a bit of luck, this ideal is in n f •
way to realisation. As a matter of fact>
might have been well over the horizon Sow
if Maonland had thought a few years mr
as it is beginning to think now, and if
Canada had decided about the same time t
take its coat off like a man to defend its lif
and honor and prospects, instead of buying
weapons for old father Bull to do the scran
ping for the whole family. Thus, 2?
now. there would have been at least tw
Dreadnoughts in the Pacific for Australian
defence —the Australia and the Maorilandb
for the “gift” warship which lousepii Ward
stampeded his country into persuading 1
Bull to build for himself in his own vard
at his (Bull’s) personal expense could—
and. no doubt, would —have been the first
outcome of a local navy policy: a Dread
nought owned and controlled in Maoriland
and stationed thereabouts, instead of in the
North Sea or some other unhandy place to
bring a warship from in a hurry. " Likewise
Canada, instead of pursuing Bull with a
flash-in-the-pan contribution of three Dread
noughts' (which Bull can have on some-
thing like the same terms as he received
the Maoriland), might have had them con-
structed for itself and planked into the
Pacific with a splash that would have re-
sounded through a century of the Younger
Nations’ history. Had such an unfortunate
difference of opinion not existed amongst
statesmen, tuft-hunters and plain fools, the
White Man's fear of the swarming of Asia
would rest easier on his chest o’ nights.
Japan has, at present, four Dreadnoughts
in Pacific waters, and another building or
about to be built. Hard financial times
will keep Nippon at that battleship strength
until 11)16, wdien four more will be added
to fleet. Experts reckon that in that
year Nippon will be able to land an army in
Australia, if it has a hankering that way;
but a lot may happen in three years. One
thing practically certain is that “the number
of Dreadnoughts will play a most important
part in the argument when it starts, and it
is something to know that it would not be
impossible for the White Man to throw
seven of the ironclad devils into the scales
—three from Canada (provided the proposed
scheme stands), one from Australia, one
from Maoriland (provided it is on the China
Station by 11)16), another “gift” vessel from
the. Federated Malay States, and (if the
decision of the 1909 Imperial Conference at
London holds good), one from the East
Indies squadron. All this is very comfort-
ing, even if the realisation of the project
appears at present vague and dim. But dim
as the signs are, they point to an awaken-
ing amongst the peoples of the Dominions
from the mental sloth into which they have
hitherto wallowed as far as their defence is
concerned. The old idea of paying subsidies
to the Imperial navy, and having all the
eggs in one basket, is being rapidly rooted
out. J. Bull has made it clear that he can
no longer pretend to be a reliable protector
of his unwieldy empire. The job is too
massive for him, and the time is ripe for
some stalwart assistance. The form that
assistance should take was mapped out for
Australia by Bull himself, so that no mis-
take should he made about it, and. Dr.
Arthur notwithstanding, all other schemes
are merely an embarrassment to the old
nian. They are worse ; they are an impudent
intimation that he is an incompetent old
driveller. With the turning of Maoriland
to a policy of some self-reliance, an enor-
mous stride will have been made towards
the ideal. James Allen, M.L.’s Minister
for Defence, w r as enthusiastically sent off a
little while ago to talk over this very ques-
tion with the British authorities, and at the
farewelling proceedings he made very plain
what the basis of that talk would be. This
is what he said :
It seems to me an absolute necessity that if we
in these Southern Seas desire to keep open our
trade routes we should establish a fleet in the
Pacific to supplement the one in the Atlantic. I
think the burden of such a fleet should be borne by
those who live in the Pacific. There is no reason
why Australia, Maoriland, Canada, South Africa
and even India should not take part in the defence
of the Pacific.
As for Canada, the signs there need not be
disheartening, even though they be exasper-
ating. With the Laurier Government in
power, the country was pledged through its
Parliament to a local unit of sea defence;
but Laurier’s defeat brought to the Trea-
sury benches a party that, temporarily, any-
how, favored a cash subsidy and “gift'
Dreadnoughts. Three, Dreadnoughts were
offered, but there was a healthy condition
attached to the offer that if it was desired
by Canada at a future date to take over
control of the ships, no obstacle should be
put in the Dominion’s way. The not re-
mote chances are that the disturbance now
going on between the two parties in Canada s
House of Commons on the subject will be
sooner or later decided by the country, when
the naval policy will be definitely fixed.
And if a spirited, nation-like decision is for
a local fleet, the White Man in the Pacific
will begin to loom across the shadowy
future of things with much more definiteness.
The Sydney Government House Muddle.
The centre of dispute in connection with
Sydney Government House is changed, but
the decision of the Full Court does not seem
to have closed the argument. The State
Governor is equally with the Governor-Gen-
eral the King’s representative. The party
in power, though beaten on the first point
of law submitted, may, therefore, possibly
decide to recall the State Governor from
the slopes above Rose Bay and •e-establish
his throne in Macquarie-street, and then the
row will start afresh ; for the ultra-loyalists,
fierce State spiters as they are in all other
matters, are determined that the boss vice-
regal person of Australia, and nobody else,
shall occuny the house of many chimneys.
It is an amazing situation. The McGowen
Government is pledged to abolish the office
of State Governor, yet Carmichael sug-
the other day, that the State Gover-
nor might be sent hack to Macquarie-street
to avoid extravagance. Some people have
as strange notions of economy as they nave

Black and White Pictures.
The Government of India, through the Brit-
ish Government has desired the Common-
wealth to warn white widows and spinsters
hereabouts against the foolishness of marrying
adventurous Afghans and Pathans who lure
them with “lying stories of the magnificence
and comforts of their homes, of their status
in their own country, and of the future life
of the wives” they are going to adore. Ihe
Indian Govt, declares that, having captured
a gullible white woman, the black humbug
takes her away across the North-Western
frontier of India and sells her at auction :
The miserable woman is (loomed to a life of close
imprisonment under barbarous conditions, and when
her attractions wane she becomes simply a household
slave. She lives and dies within the walls ot a

who marry Europeanised Indians, of “Cni-
Q T‘ ty e educ^ on ’’:. and so forth . and are
«nm,L t 0 rn,. llfe of miser y by their dusky
spouses. Ihe young Indian who is sent to
J-ngffind by a wealthy father to be educated,
and is thereafter treated as a bizarre orna-
me,n. of civilisation in “upper circles,” is
not infrequently as dangerous a fraud as the
( fiinese who married Miss Russell, in
Melbourne, the other month. But even if
he lie a person of solid property in his own
country his marriage with the white girl
whom he takes to his precious native home
proves a terrible disillusionment to his *vic-
v>m ‘ j P° or wretch! embarking on a

a bride to be avoided by the experienced
Anglo-Indian passengers, and an object of
pity to the saloon stewards, who know what
awaits Desdemona at the other end of the
journey. The bridegroom’s motley crowd of
relatives will stare at her as a curio, and
whilst the. men smack their thick lips in
contemplation of her, the ignorant women
will hate her for her intrusion. White soci-
ety shuns her ; black society boycotts her.
Her position as a married woman is not
worth a string of beads. The deception
practised on the white woman in such cases
ia ajffiost, if not quite, as cruel as where the
Afghan is concerned; but it is neither In-
dian nor British Government policy to make
the truth public.
Group Settlement in the Northern
Territory.
The descendants of the most ancient vari-
ety of Briton appear likely to make a
descent on the Northern Territory and estab-
lish themselves there in force. The Welsh
colony in Patagonia has been looking for a
change, and Robert Williams, late Cus-
toms expert at Wellington (M.L.), has re-
ported in thrilling terms on the advantages
of settlement in the Territory. The conclu-
sion of his Report is as follows :
I feel that I would be wanting in duty and
patriotism if I did not urge you with all my might
to abandon your inhospitable home under an alien
flag and lose no time in availing yourself of the won-
derful offer now before you. Never in the whole
history of British colonisation have such inducements
been held out to the white settler. Australia needs
to people her vast spaces of the North. Her need is
your opportunity !
Williams has announced his intention of
leading the way by taking up land in Aus-
tralia’s-' front’ garden, and has thrown up
his : Government job to do so, and there is a
very big chance of his countrymen shaking
the dust of S, America from their whiskers
and joining him. This looks like very good
business. In an absolutely new country,
group-settlement has very much to recom-
mend it. A bunch of people bound together
by some ties of friendship or kindred aim
will feel its isolation less keenly, and will
warm up to greater enthusiasm, than those
who go single-handed into the wilderness,
leaving all their friends and associates in
Gippsland, County Clare or the Black
Forest. The most successful colonisation
done in Maoriland was along these “group”
lines. Otago was given to a Presbyterian
cmwd; Canterbury to a bunch of Church
of England enthusiasts ; Taranaki was first
exploited by men of Devon; Moutere, near
Nelson, is occupied by the descendants of
a single German village; the Forty-Mile
Bush and other parts of the Wellington
province are held by the sons and daughters
of hardy Norsemen; in the Far North, in-
dustrious Austrians are covering the barren
hillsides with vines • Akaroa is a French
settlement; and up and down the Shaky
Islands there are the descendants of Shet-
landers, Scottish Highlanders of various
clans, and Irish exiles who fled from the exac-
tions of the rent-lord. All of these came to
the country in friendly moos, whose mem-
bers helped one another through the trial
years of their initiation into a new life, and
all, with the exception of some weird and
detached Highlanders, have in the end iden-
tified themselves completely with the coun-
try of their choice, and become Maoriland-
ers. The Territorv, with its immense un-
peopled areas, is a splendid field for group
settlement, and the Welsh invasion may be
the beginning of an important development.
Meanwhile, there is a word in the report
made by Williams to his Welsh com-
patriots which Federal Ministers might
paste in their hats:
It is to be hoped that the agreement (with regard
to the railway) already entered into with South
Australia will be adhered to, and that no considera-
tion, political or otherwise, will be allowed to de-
flect the direct bisecting line of the continent from
Adelaide to Darwin.
Everything turns upon that. The country
is all that it should be ; it is the statesman’s
faith that is in doubt.

Jimmy McGowen Throws a Boomerang.
McGowen’s refutation of Wade’s state-
ment that house rents had risen because of
the scarcity of labor to build dwellings,
proved • most unpleasantly convincing. As
usual Wade fell over his boots through his
fatal habit of making statements before in-
quiring into facts. McGowen produces the
facts, but in doing so furnishes a damning
indictment of his own administration. On
March 6 Sydney, he says, had 2000 men out
of work, including 100 ironworkers. 150
bricklayers, 50 carpenters and a large but
unspecified Dumber of painters. Already
processions of unemployed have been seen
in the streets, and there is a general feeling
that things are going to be worse before they
are better. The real reason that rents are
high is because owners of houses realise that
as much cash must.be raked in as possible
before the slump arrives. McGowen’s deal-
ings with Cohen have created only a ficti-
tious prosperity, and the person interested
in collecting rents recognises it as such. He
has seen things like it before. Also, the
capitalist who builds, jerries or otherwise
produces terraces and things, is filled with
very grave doubts. If the present boom
could continue, he would have houses and
cottages up even if he had to lay the bricks
himself an'i hold them in position with stick-
ing-plaster until he had them leased ; but he
also sees a winter of discontent following
last upon a summer of borrow and squan-
der, and he holds off to watch events. So,
had McGowen kept his non-borrowing
pledge, there would have been more houses
aV ij » e * n a t lower rents. There
wouldn t have been much unemployment either,
tor had the fiscal-sinking crowd in Federal
politics not been provided with cash
through the fictitious prosperity caused by
the States’ borrowing, they would long since
have been compelled to tackle the work of
raising the tariff walls to a decent height.
MCDowen s explanation is thus a boome-
rang which, after knocking out Wade, has
rebounded and hit James himself very hard
in the stomach, or thereabouts.

White Australia and the Tariff.
The Ma State’s Government lately called
tor tenders for strawboard, and the Com-
monwealth Board Mills. Ltd., replied with
a quotation of £8 4s. per ton, delivered in
Sydney. Simultaneously, a Japanese firm
quoted a price 21 p.c. lower—and the Ma
fetate s allegedly white-labor Government
gave it the contract. That shameful fact, re-
membering many things, is understandable-
what is not understandable is that the Com-
monwealth Government should have allowed
the iniquity to be possible. The present duty
on strawboard is 30s. per ton ; and when it
is remembered that the Dutch strawboard
manufacturers pay their employees from 15s.
to , Per week, and the Japanese far less,
wlnle the Commonwealth Board Mills pav
Iff*™ 48 % t( k B4s ; P er week - the farcical
nature of the Protection” is obvious.
.ere was a feeble attempt last session to
give the duty a small lift; but, apparently,
the importers spoke softly to a few fiscal
sinkers or other time-servers, and the pro-'
was rejected by a narrow majority.
±ne JNational Government knows this; it
knew that the importations of strawboard
™« ed from £28151 worth in 1910 to
£48,911 worth in 1911; it knew that Aus-
tralian workmen are thus being deprived of
work that they should get; and it knows
tnat Japanese workmen are getting it
instead. Yet it calls itself a White-
Australian Government! When will these
people see that adequate Protection is an
essential part of the A*hite Labor

“Quiz” tells of another happy arrange-
ment: —
The Master Printers’ Combine of Melbourne
euphemistically styled Typothetae, is going the pace
with a vengeance. When, on the genesis of the
movement, Ihe Bulletin placed it under the
microscope and probed its motives, no little sore-
ness was caused. Indeed, its official organ, The
Pmnteu, was furiously indignant. But somehow
the thing grew, and it has enough vigor now to
cease worrying about a possible post-mortem. It
boasts of embracing to-day a high percentage of
city and suburban houses. Its secretariat in Col-
lins-street is a sumptuously equipped institution
controlled by a staff with gilt-edged salaries. It is
here all the big “nobs” foregather to stack the cards
and give instructions to the hirelings as to how to
play them. The “costing” list prepared by the
combine is the last possibility in the way of ex-
ploitation. There was a growl of dissent from the
smaller craftsmen when the list was issued, but the
big fellows had their way. Next, when the fiat
went forth that there was to be no more competi-
tion, that prices were to be absolutely uniform, and
that when a printer had a customer on his books he
or she was to remain his property for ever and
anon, matters wore a somewhat angry appearance.
But again the big man won. All manner of threats
were made in order to bring in recalcitrant prin-
ters. These included such convincing suggestions
as the financial thumbscrew and svstematic boycot-
ting. The timid ones went in. Their small stock
of courage oozed out like ink from a leaky barrel.
There are still, it is true, a number of self-respect-
ing printers holding out —but at what a cost?
Tyranny has materialised in a hideous form. Paper
warehousemen in Melbourne, as well as indent agents,
have point-blank refused to supply material to these
non-combine printers. And, to make matters more
fiendish, Adelaide and Sydney houses are in the
swim. Surely this is the quintessence of the bar-
baric boycott! What a stunning demonstration it
is of the cruelty that is possible under a Constitu-
tion that is allegedly a warranty of freedom !
»
The Laborite who thinks that the tariff
doesn’t matter, and the other one who fancies
that Customs duties are an invention of the
Devil to fatten the capitalist, ought to have
been at a meeting the other day when the
manager of one of Melbourne’s largest boot-
manufacturing concerns told his remaining
etnployees a few solemn truths about their
business. He reminded them that they were
steadily getting fewer in number, and even
those that remained were mostly on half-
time ; he told them that if they acquainted
themselves with the existing Customs tariff
on boots and shoes, and considered the pub-
lished figures of importations, they would
perceive the reason of this lack of employ-
ment ; and he coldly assured them that,
while it mattered a great deal to them, it
mattered little to him. He merely had to
earn dividends for his shareholders, and he
could, under the present tariff, just as easily
do that by importing as by manufacturing.
He had already, in fact, imported 40.000
pairs of boots this year, and it was likely
that he would import 10 times as many
before the year was out. But if the tariff
were made Protective he could not import at
a profit, and his shareholders would sneedily
tell him to set his machines going again. So
the shareholders are not desperately inter-
ested in making the tariff what it ought to be
—looking at the matter from a selfish point
of view. The people who are interested are
the boot-operatives and their wives and fam-
ilies, since importing brings them no profit.
All they get out of it is the sack.
Sydney very nearly got some fried hospital
patient the other night. The Coast Hospi-
tal, a group of wood and iron buildings, faces
the Pacific on a breezy cliff where the fresh
sea winds can blow the germs skyward. All
around is dense scrub containing plenty of
turpentine, and ready to blaze furiously at
short notice. The nearest fire station is
miles away. During burning-off operations
the other night the flames got beyond con-
trol, and began to roar towards the sick
people’s inflammable shelter. The brisk sea-
wind seconded the motion, and helped it
along so well that the hospital morgue and
the body it contained were surrounded and
singed, and one of the wards missed destruc-
tion by a few yards only. While the staff
was beating the fire out, the patients, lying
helpless inside, became hysterical, and the
nurses had to stand by in case it became
necessary to rush them into the open. Just
when the situation seemed hopeless, the
wind veered from south to west, and started
to drive the attacking flames towards the
sea. The first section of the distant brigade
hadn’t yet arrived, so it was mere chance
that averted the tragedy. If hospitals must
be made of wood and iron, it seems a fair
thmg to clear the surrounding land so that
the risk of a wholesale grill by bush fire will
be eliminated. But, on the face of things,
there doesn’t seem to he any reason why im-
portant and permanent institutions should
be flimsy woodsheds.
“Six-and-Eight’s” little bomb:—
„ A . point ca P«ble of causing; consternation, mental
contusion and kindred emotions, has been raised in
connection with the Sydney Government House case.
~,7®. Co " st ' t !; t , I , on . Act of 1855 vested only the waste
lands of N.S.W. in the Legislature, and as the Gov-
ernment House grounds weren’t waste in any except
an economic sense, the contention is upheld that they
are still in the direct charge of the Imperial Gov-
ernment, and quite beyond the control of local
authority. But a lot of land in the State was far
from being waste in 1855. Already, the bvst por-
tions ot it had been alienated, and the settlement
had spread far out into the wilderness and stuck
the survey pegs of Private Enterprise all over the
landscape from Watson’s Bay to the sunset. A lot of the
argument which applies to the land on the shores of
harm Cove must therefore have a wider application,
tor it the Imperial authorities handed over onlv
waste lands everything that was occupied or pur-
chased by Private Enterprise before 1855 must be
under Imperial control also. Which means or seems
t ( > mean that the State has no right to interfere
with a single clod of N.S.W. earth which had become
private property or had been set apart for any pub-
lic purpose before 1855. It is a cheerful ideas and
one with at least enough sporting chance of being
good law to make certain fat persons leap high in
the air, wave their abdominal extensions round
their heads and sing “Rule Britannia” with a loyal
vehemence that may disturb the chained kangaroo
m front of the G.P.O. If Private Enterprise could
only shake itself free from State law in its applica-
tion to all lands alienated before 1855, and every-
thing done on those lands, what a time Svdney would
have! It is a great idea, and if taken up with
solid enthusiasm the cry of Imperial Rights might
drown even the slogan of State Frights in its volume
and intensity.
One Mr. Kwei Chih, of the Maoriland
Chinese Consulate, lately spoke reprovingly
about the White Australia policy:—
Yours is a big, fertile country, and so sparsely
populated. How are you going to get it populated
if you insist upon these restrictions? Consider the
state of the Australian ‘aborigine. He has been ren-
dered almost extinct by a philosophical idea of iso-
lation. There has been no intercourse with other
nations, and he is dying for want of it. Australia
must not restrict itself if it wants to become a great
nation....My own country was degenerating until
we opened the doors about 50 years ago. Now we are
glad to get ideas of Western civilisation.
As requested, The Bulletin has consid-
ered the case of Binghi, and finds that while
Bmghi was permitted to carry out a “philo-
sophical idea of isolation,” he was alive; he
only began to die when he began to have
intercourse with a nation of a different
color. In fact, it was the very intercourse
which Kwei Chih reckons Binghi needed
for his perpetuation that has caused his vir-
tual extinction. On the other hand, The
Bulletin agrees with Kwei Chiii that
Western ideas are valuable goods to have
about the premises, and that Chinese ideas
are inferior. And because Australia wants
the best goods discoverable, it has decided to
keep , out the inferior article; and Mr.
Chih’s implied confession merely supports
it in that attitude.
“Milmeridien,” from the Front Gate : —-
Was it Prof. Spencer who instigated the ab-
surdity of appointing as chief protector of Northern
Territory aborigines an otherwise worthy but super-
annuated gentleman of 66? What blazing folly it
is! Any man who understands the Northern nig.
must have a big affection for our dirty, sore-eyed
and ill-treated countrymen. They lie like gas-
meters and smell like dead sharks, but they’re the
kindliest things on earth. Always they are show-
ing us in actuality the things our Wowser brethren
enjoin on us, but which we never do ourselves. I
have never known any of these Northern men
to bear malice for personal injury. They may
kill for jealousy, for superstition, and in spiteful
cruelty; but there’s a lot of generosity and chari-
tableness in them. And the local Administration’s
policy is all in the interests of the white man, as it
was under the old regime to which the new-old protec-
tor belongs, and not for the blacks the Australian
people desire to protect. The Administration is
bad through and through. You can’t get any land
in all these millions of acres unless it’s a fresh-
water selection on the Daly—up to 1000 acres,
e\ery farm teeming with fish, crocodiles (porosus),
ducks and geese, and scarcely enough dry land at
present to grow a cabbage. The Daly River fraud
is going to make a row loud enough to be heard in
China when the “farmers” arrive to claim their
sections. You certainly can get a grazing ar<‘a
(with permissive occupancy for a year) up to 250
square miles, at a shilling per head per annum for
big stock and 6d. for small; but you’re liable to be
thrown out on three months’ notice. The Common-
wealth Government invites people here (and in the
case of Americans pays the exes.), and then tells
them they can’t get land except on these very
foolish terms. It’s all a farce, but there’ll be
tragedy behind it all. A few weeks back a concrete
and iron bridge over the railroad was completed.
It cost about £2OOO. The Administration now
finds it was stupidly planned and constructed, is
incapable of carrying the traffic, and that (as the
crown of the joke) it was built on private land
without the owner’s consent. So —we have de-
molished it with dynamite! Grotesque; but, after
all, only part of the piece.

“Vagabond” tells of Egyptian light and
Australian darkness: —
In Egypt I found several points of similarity
between that country and Australia, and I also had
to regretfully take off my hat to the superior way
in which Egypt has grabbed Opportunity by the
forelock, or, if Opportunity hadn’t a forelock, the
way Egypt got to work with the hair restorer and
raised a sufficient crop to get a grip of. Port
Sudan is an excellent instance of a long-distance
look into the future. Only 15 years ago the Sudan
was the happy hunting-ground of the Mahdi and
the dervish tribes. The Omdurman performance
burst that, and then Egypt began to .figure out the
Sudan’s prospects of trade. There was already a
railway to Alexandria and Port Said, both flourish-
ing seaports with good accommodation and shipping
facilities and connection such as Sydney and Mel-
bourne possess. Egypt did some tape-measuring,
and concluded that cheaper and quicker transport
would boost the backblocks of the Sudan and the
country generally. Suakim was selected as an out-
let, and a railway rapidly strung along to it. That
was in 1904. Suakim was good enough in its way
(as Port Jackson and Port Phillip are good enough
in their ! ways) ; but it was evident that another
and better port would help trade and the country,
even as other and better ports would do ditto for
Australia. A survey showed that there was a natur-
ally good position for another port at Port Sudan,
just as it "is admitted that Twofold, Jervis, Port
Stephens, etc., are good natural ports. Egypt
took off. its coat or its jibbah or whatever it
wears, and got such a hustle on that Port Sudan
was formally opened as a harbor in 1909. (Here the
Australian "narallel falls dead.) The new outlet
was on the beach of a sandy desert without even
an occasional camel on the horizon ; now there is
an up-to-date port, sizzling with electric arc-
lamps and purring with electric capstans and elec-
tric cranes. Of course, it couldn’t have come into
existence without the backing up of the railways,
any more than our deep-water ports can. But the
Egyptian and Sudan Government railways are
there for the good- of the country, not of the fat
cities. The Railway Department- reckoned that
trade would come from Kordofan arid. Obeid if the
railways went to them. The Tails hurriedly

Cathedral Church of St. Andrew’s, Easter Day
10.30, Anthem, “Oh, Give Thanks.”
—Sydney advt.
Now the Easter bells, are pealing, and I
draw me to the fold,
Where in gratitude I raise my voice on high
To a kind and loving Providence for bless-
ings manifold,
For the miracles that awe and edify.
Teh* the Miracles are with us, we can see
them day by day—
Think of ’Enley when he prayed for Den-
man’s home;
Prayed confusion on disloyalists who’d drive
“the Flag” away—
Now is judgment ’gainst them entered on
the Tome.
Oh, give thanks, ye meek and lowly, while the
ferry strike is on,
Fbi> the Daily Telegraph is by your side.
It has risen from its thraldom as the Rich
Man’s myrmidon ;
It is with the stricken host this Eastertide.
This wealthy eo., it thunders, has had pay-
ment in advance,
Y« “ignored an undertaking” to the crowd.
In effect, it’s joined the strikers in their
brutal arrogance—
Which is more than even Wealth should be
allowed !
Oh, give thanks, my fainting brothers ; comes
of penitents one more,
With a pious look upon his eager face.
This be Joseph Cook, ex-Tory, yea, but
, _ Tory now foreswore;
His sins are purged, no more a hardened
case;
He will fight the goodly battle for the
wearied under-dog;
From the people’s cause he ne’er again will
rat.
Shout a fervid hallelujah, write his name
in Heaven’s log—
Joseph Cook, Esquire, the Labor-Democrat!
Oh, give thanks and burn your incense for
the law of this our land
That is sweeping all the evil from our track :
For the “cat” that swings and whistles so
that all may understand,
No matter what in intellect they lack.
Sing hosanna for the gallows (this is Cruci-
fixion time,
And ’tis not long since the Cross to gallows
changed)—
What sentimental fool was it who said the
law’s a crime
That sentences to death a child deranged?*
Let us close, beloved brethren. What a heri-
tage is ours !
Yea, and glorious the Nation we shall be !
Oh, sing a psalm of ten to von, nor heed the
cloud that lowers
Where Asia turns and hovers hungrily.
For our little brother Billy he is learning
how to drill,
And, by and bye, in twenty years or so,
We shall have a grown-up army that for
readiness and skill
Will give ’em all a fair and willin’ go.
We shall then chastise the heathen, and the
wicked shall be broke ;
Our star-spread banners flaunting on their
walls.
And, now, the Lord be with you all —go
out and have a smoke,
And watch how Thumper wallops googly
balls.

went, and the trade is filling its part of the
contract. 1 had to take off my hat again
to the Sudan Railway Department and the Gov-
ernment that breathes in its nostrils. I chatted
with several shippers, but I couldn’t hear of any
wheat or rice being allowed to lie and rot at the
railside becai se there were no trucks to take it to
the sea. They couldn’t understand why this should
be when one has only to notify the Railway Depart-
ment that the goods are there. “Don’t they know
they 11 have to carry it?” asked one of the simple
souls in amazement, when I mentioned how things
were with our Ma State railways.
Just; as Easter was happening, Victoria’s
Works Minister Edgar opportunely discov-
ered that the long-discarded Symonds chan-
nel ’ , from Williamstown to Queenscliff,
could be made available for ocean-going boats
by an uncertain amount of dredging, re-
peated at intervals ; so he “arranged” for the
Eabmet to meander down the bay in the
Lady Loch on a voyage of inspection. It is
surprising how clearly the sandbanks, bars,
etc., on the bay floor can be seen from the
deck or a free picnic steamer—especially
when viewed through a glass tilted at the
usual angle.

had incautiously asked him if the shilling was the

The launch rolled deeply in the green swells, and
the silent passengers, cramped underneath the roof,
searched the cabin for life-saving gear, and, observ-
ing none, wondered if any was carried overhead
they went on wondering. The familiar harbor, so
exceedingly narrow and shallow when mail steamers
are clumsily getting in the way and disturbing the
bottom with their .twin screws, seemed unusuallv
deep and empty. It had the bleak, clean-swept look
ot a busy street early on Sunday morning. Circu-
lar Quay corner, where the trim white-and-yellow
terries usually give a sidekick' to their rippling
green-and-white skirts, looked like the entrance to a
church on a week-day. The ferries themselves,
clustered thicklv at their wharves, were uninhabited
f., fnbkckss. A few wobbling launches crawled
like.futile beetles about the Milson’s Point pontoon
where, at ordinary times, the big boats of the ser-
vice glide like trays of undrowned flies, and pretend
they are just as useful as, a bridge.
„ Tl ' e shilling launch did not impudently wobble to
the Sydney Ferries’ leased jetties in Circular Quav •
it just tottered gently to one of the Fort Macquarie
jetties and allowed its passengers to jump ashore to
the penny tram. During the shoreward scramble,
some of them noticed that the roof was unencum-
bered with lifebelts. The life-saving gear of the
launch, if it existed at all. was concealed as well
as if it had been opium. Some of the landed people
took the penny tram round to the city; others
started on the long, hot tramp uptown. As I went
I figured my water-travelling exes, for the day thus :
Self, two trips to and from office, 2s. Wife and self,
double trip to and from theatre job at night, 4s. •
total, 6s. Well, if it breaks me, I will have the
consolation of knowing that Private Enterprise got
it all. Blessed be Private Enterprise! Its meat is
also its poison, and its poison is its meat; conse-
quently, dear brethren, it is in no danger of dying
out altogether. Let ps prey.
That signpost of Tory incompetence,
Charles Gregory Wade, leader of the Oppo-
sition in N. S. Wales Assembly, has returned
trorn China and Japan with his capacity for
putting his foot in it thoroughly recuper-
ated. The other day. he fell clumsily upon
a couple of “Liberals” who are not satisfied
with party arrangements, and was promptly
and painstakingly cuffed by one of them
(H. D. Morton, M.L.A.). One biff:—
, I* J s just as well for' someone to stand up and
tell Mr. Wade openly and candidly that all through
the country, amongst erstwhile Liberal supporters,
there is a total lack of sympathy with his party and
its tactics under his leadership.
Morton says that. his own contemptuous
opinion of Wade is clearly shared by the
country, and quotes as proof that when Car-
handed over the Premiership to him
(Made), the party’s majority in the Assem-
bl/ was 18. Three years later, at the poll
of 1910, the majority dwindled to a mino-
rity, while the chance of making up lost
ground at the elections this year is almost
as small as Wade’s national spirit.

“Why Women Love Wowsers,” with
Get-Rich-Quick Niblo as the first Wowser
stage-hero in history, was explained at
Sydney . Criterion on Saturday. They love
him chiefly for his beautiful black clothes,
his neat fiat flat, his fondness for church,
his holy face, his humility, and the
bright hope that he is a fraud.
And Nathaniel Duncan, “The Fortune
Hunter,” is a fraud —the useless son
Of an indulgent father, who brought
him up expensively and then died broke.
Nathaniel discovers not only that he dis-
likes work, but he can’t get it. His
rich friend, Harry Kellogg, suggests a way
to become a millionaire in one year. One
way, as Mr. Niblo has shown us, is to in-
vent a covered carpet tack ; the other is to
marry a female rube. Apparently, there
are several million female rubes in the U.S.,
all inhabiting small country towns. The
bright young men of these backblock vil-
lages slip away to N’York to sweat blouse-
making factory girls or to corner sawdust
sausages in Wall-street. The bright young
girls are left. Kellogg fits out his hard-up
friend with the latest striped socks, and
sends him down to corner the marriage
market in the backblocks. He follows
instructions and bashfully accepts the
hand of the selected heiress.' Unfortunately
he has fallen in love with the daughter of
the drug-store where he got employment.
But he has made that derelict chemist’s
shop pay, and the derelict chemist has in-
vented a method of making gas—which
should come in useful in Sydney when the
next quarterly gas strike is due—the
“pattent” of which is worth £lO,OOO. He
has, therefore, no hesitation in allowing
the. heiress to break the engagement by re-
fusing to clear himself from the accusation
that he is an absconding bank cashier.
Such is the slight . plot, but the comedy
“goes” with the cleverness of the incidental
business and the rattle of the dialogue inher-
ent in this sort of American play. A useful
touch of pathos is introduced in two delight-
ful characters, that of the derelict inventor
and his drudge of a daughter. And the
final curtain, though obviously manufac-
tured, finishes the. comedy with American
slickness.
“THE MAN ON THE BOX,” AT THE
LITTLE THEATRE.
W. R. Hunter
as Pierre, the
Colonel's chef.
Fred Niblo, as the Wowser, is afforded
more scope for comedy than in “G. R. Q
Wallingford,” to which comedy “The For-
tune Hunter” is a first cousin. There are
the same rubes in each, and the plot and
setting are strikingly similar. Mr. Niblo
shows himself an expert and pleasing com-
edian. His antics behind the sodawater bar,
and his assumption of the Wowser and the
shop-walker manner, were unctuous, though
tinged with a tendency, easily forgiven, to
clown. In the first act, as the useless
young man, down and out, he proved him-
self a convincing actor. Miss Josephine
Cohan, who appears as a slatternly girl in
the_ petered-out drug-store, had the oppor-
tunity denied her in her previous appear-
ance of proving herself an accomplished
comedienne. She never stresses her
emotions; the character is real. Ray L.
Royce, as the genial dreamer-inventor with
the sweet smile, was also absolutely in
character. But both he and Miss Cohan
were exhorted by the gallery to speak up.
Robert Greig, as the business-man who
backed his friend to marry a million dol-
lars, had the task of talking hard all through
the first (and womanless) act, and man-
aged it. Edwin Lester, the richest rube,
gave a consistent rendering of the part, and,
as a “Wallingford” youth, E. Pirie Bush
confirmed the good impression he had
already made. The other backblocks
heroine, Miss Marion Dunn, did her best,
and Miss Beatrice Holloway’s infantile
charm was well placed in an ingenue part.
The other characters, all of whom shouted
most of the time, except ope who was
pleasantly drunk, gave the plav the 1000
horse-power necessary to carry it over the
patches of badly metalled roadway of the
plot.
“Puss in Boots” is just getting into its
stride at Her Majesty’s, Svdney, and the
fact is already plain that its colored tights
will have to be pursued far down the corri-
dors of Time.
At Sydney Royal “The Sunshine Girl”
will wink out on Frida v night. She will be

vivalist, “The Belle of New York.”
“THE MAN ON THE
BOX,” AT THE
LITTLE THEATRE.
JUDGE
WATTS
(ARTHUR
CORNELL)
TAKES
TEA.
“We hope to see you here again. Remem-
ber, we are here every night. Hugh Buck-
ler, managing-director of the Little Theatre,
Sydney, shot a look of humorous appeal at
the crowded first-night audience, and seemed
refreshed by the answering roar. Leading
lady Violet Paget, in response to a special
cheer, smiled and faltered her thanks over
the usual rampart of flowers, and the new
curtain made a final rustling descent. The
Little Theatre (late Standard) waves its
golden sign-light in Castlereagh-street, just
alongside the Central Fire Station, and the
wandering playgoer can always . find it by
breaking a street fire-alarm and going back
in state on an engine.
“The Man on the Box,” with which the
season opened on Saturday, is a three-act
dramatisation of Harold Macgrath’s novel
of American society life. It is a bustling
comedy which starts with a misfire practical
joke. Lieutenant Robert Worburton dis-
guises himself as a coachman with the idea
of driving his sister’s carriage home after a
dance, and kissing her as she alights. He
manages to get on the wrong carriage, and
drives off instead with a couple of strange
ladies. Captured by police, he is locked up
for the night, and next morning the kissed
lady (a friend of his sister’s, with whom he
has fallen in love, but to whom he has not
yet been introduced) calls and pays the fine
of the handsome young stranger. He accepts
her challenge to take service with her family
as coachman, and endures various mild humil-
iations while she is falling in love with
him. The reckless but gentlemanly pa of
the bride-elect sells a Russian diplomatist-
spy the plans of some fortifications. Being
a hero of boundless wealth, 11., Buckler
light-heartedly snatches the plans from the
Russian, and arranges to redeem pa’s note
of hand next morning. The play is. sugary,,
and the central idea highly improbable; but
it contains some good comedv scenes, is
brightly worked out, and the Little Theatre
company—an agreeably even array of talent
-—gets every ounce out of it.
* * * *
Hugh Buckler is almost an ideal Worbur-
ton—the resistless army youth of romantic
fiction. Violet Paget makes a suitably be-
witching Betty Annesley—the rash young
lady who engages the kissing coachman. She
handles her comedy scenes with vim, and
wears Some exquisite gowns. Reynolds Den-
niston grapples skilfullv in a minor key with
the unheroic part of Betty’s busted pa; G.
R. Souper deals lightly with the role of
v\ orburton s reporter friend, Henderson;
and Arthur Cornell makes Judge Watts
the fussy old man without whom no
light comedy can get along. Others play
with a thoroughness that give the production
a polish; the mounting is adequate; and,
generally, the playseeker is confidently ad-
vised to go, along and inspect foy himself.

Business has been brisk at the Pitt-street
(Sydney) stand during the past week, and
the fine party of mummers playing “Dr
Wake’s Patient” for the Ilamilton-Plimmer

ing of applause, which, it may be recalled
in this season of Christian humility and
horseracing, the dour Carlyle warned re-
cipients was not fame.
Wirths’ circus can’t accommodate the
crowds that want to feel the momentary
but delicious thrill of wondering whether
Mrs. Garcia’s somersaulting car will
land right side up. La Belle Victoria
still swings gaily as a bird on her long

through the middle air. the elephants bow
with their usual grace, “Lizzie” is as cheer-
fill as ever, and the clowns sprinkle the
performance with their wonted sorrow.
Proof that Ireland is a most distress-
ful country was found by hundreds
of confirmed Australians who visited the pic-
ture show put on for the past three nights
at the Town Hall (Sydney). “Ireland To-
day” the show was nominated, and the title
conveyed a fair view of the position. The films,
to a considerable extent, were what is known
in the trade as “rainy”—that is, flickered
and split—due, possibly, to over-work; but
they illustrated to painfulness the gulf in
suffering Ireland between ignorance and pov-
erty, on the one side, and arrogance and
wealth on the other. So much for the in-
habitants as the photographer screened them ;
and, presumably, he did his best, since his
main object was to secure the appreciation
of their kith abroad. For so much of the
scenery as was shown, this scribe has little
to say, except that the fellow who wrote that
Heaven reflected in Ivillarney was a
poor traveller, or else the original press
agent of the Golden Shore overdid the thing.
It was somewhat discouraging, too, to con-
template. the exhibited samples of Irish
beauty-girls and reflect upon the raptures of
some of the Celtic poets and other peddlers in
imagination. Still, it wasn’t the fault of the
girls ; and if the camera-man had known his
job he would have surreptitiously run into
his collection a few Manly surf maidens, and
saved the reputation of a wickedly-depleted
nation.
If the first appearance of “Milestones,” at
Melbourne Royal, fell a trifle short of ex-
pectation, it was not that rumor had rated
the comedy too highly, but that the theatre
seemed somewhat large for a play of very
limited action. Nothing to speak of happens
m “Milestones” save the breaking off of com-
monplace marriage engagements, through
the interference of relatives of the contracted
parties, or the withdrawal of objections to
an engagement after it has been advanced,
or the free and independent betrothal in the
third act of a middle-aged couple whose mar :
riage was prohibited in the second act, wheii
they were young. The little incident that
closes the domestic story is the prettiest,
perhaps. Old John Rhead, having remarked
that the rebellious young women of the new
generation are heartless and “unsexed,” is
surprised by his up-to-date granddaughter’s
Graceful display of sentimentality. Then he
snakes his head over the rose she has brought
him as a peace-offering, and reflects that
We live and learn.” For ancient people in
the audience, “Milestones” is a sermon with
the old, old text uttered in its final words.
For the young, it is full of sweet flattery,

“The Chocolate Soldier,” originally adver-

ing on for six nights more; and, meanwhile
this acceptable but ill-balanced revival Will
not be disimproved if Wynne continues to
lepiace Roberts in the Alexius part, as he
did last Saturday. The present co. makes
the opera, go louder than of yore—for that
matter, the stage and orchestra are nearer
to the back of the house at Her Maiestv’s
than at the Royal—but it goes less grace-
fully, and leaves the spirit of Bernard Shaw
further estranged from the travesty of his
comedy. Yet Melbourne should be glad to
get these extra six performances ere “The

-^? e E y il Men Do,” at Melbourne
S 1 be . au thor, Theodore Kremer, has
the nnri-or up to his famous outrage,
The 1 atal \\ edding, and copied the com-
plications thereof. Just as in that tremen-
dous shindy a fond mamma was separated
from her doleful husband to be fed by her
cheeild during the period of estrangement,
so in the present rumpus Ruth Bingham is
divorced by her fatuous Gilbert and sus-
tained by the coppers of her darling kid, who
goes forth in his ickle bare feet into fashion-
able quarters and shines the boots of the
multitude. As heretofore, also, the author
of the trouble is a stylish miscreant. Harold
Crane, the twin brother of a semi-mystic,
the Rev. George, who differs only from
Harold inasmuch as he has a kind of gap
in Ins walk, while Harold has holes in his
reputation. Harold, of course, is aided in
his devilry by the customary lady who plavs
a big hand in the divorce proceedings, and
is, later, a witness to his assassination of
brother George—a crime indicated by a
gurgle from the O.P. wings. The pair even-
tually tall out, and they carry their crazv
argument into _a cathedral interior, where
Harold, preaching a bogus sermon in the
vestments of his relative, is attacked by his
passionate female accomplice, p,nd the nair
stab one another to a gory conclusion.

the irrelevant warbling of the Choir Boys of

sort of Jekyll-Hyde impersonation. Cyril
Mackay, Beckett, Miss Remee, Miss Wal-
ton and the ninpers Crossley and Churches
rake other parts agreeably enough, the onlv
inconvenience” in the team being Miss
Bryer, whose stridency in a long, foolish
part develops from a quaintness into a
serious complaint. The scenery will, per-
haps. add another leaf of laurel to the brow
of Kege Robins, but the drama will not en-
hance the prestige of Theodore Kremer.

in his rude Spanish way, and soon has the

Of Spencer’s effusions at Melbourne
Olympia The Bulletin selects “When

of buried treasure and wickedness generally,
with a ’tec uncovering the nefarious con-
duct of a banker, a lawyer and a handsome
lady, what time a lovely lieutenant plays
the devil with a bashful maiden’s heart. A
quaint contribution was “The Virtue of
Rags,” the idea of which strolled or strayed
into the plot from that fruitful source of
suggestion, “A Message from Mars.” “Six'
O'Clock” was one of those tense, dramatic
trifles that pack a life’s excitement into two
or three minutes; while all that can be said
for “Willie Watches Over the House” is
that the programme ought to be fined a
large sum for misdescribing it as a “comic.”

settled down in ceremonious, cow-like fashion
in the bog of circumstance. I know of no-
thing like it. Napoleon might have pro-
vided a parallel case if, during the retreat
from Moscow, he had abandoned all attempt
to defend himself or his men, and just posted
notices on trees intimating to all Russians
that any pursuer injuring himself with the
abandoned guns of the French army need
not look to him for compensation.

"'lth the same becoming modesty that characterises
my remarks in The Theatre.
Consider the nerve and pluck of Herbert
Bradford, of Brunswick (Vic.), livery-
stable keeper. On the evening of March 15
he was driving the foremost of a string of
14 four-horse drags along the Beach-road
between Sandringham and Brighton. The
night was black and wet, he was alone
on the box-seat; inside were nearly a score
of passengers. Coming to a level crossing
he noticed the gates ooen for him, and the
gatekeeper and a friend standing beside
them, talking. Just as he got on the rails
the further gate, on the “down” side, was
either shut against him or blown so by the
wind, and he stopped dead. At the same
instant he saw the lights of an on-coming
train from Sandringham, on the “up” line.
The gatekeeper shouted to him to go back—
with a four-horse drag and about three
seconds to do it! He could jump to safety
and leave the picnickers to their fate; but
he wasn’t that sort of man. He could sit
there and meet it bravely with the rest; but
he wasn’t that sort of man, either. Swifter
than thought he pulled the horses round and
drove them, plunging and rearing, over
rails and sleepers along the “down” line.
The back of the drag was caught by the
engine and ripped away; one passenger had
some broken ribs and several suffered shocks
and minor casualties. Only one man, mis-
trustful of the driver, jumped—and jumped
straight to his death, merciful in its swift-
ness. Every other life was saved.

SOCIETY
“Kola”: The Federal Parliament has its
hands full of work, certainly, but surely it
might find time to pass a short Act forbid-
ding marriage between whites and colored
people. One case has been prominently in
the public eye; there are scores of other
cases that, being merely sordid, never get
there. Why not follow in the lead of Cali-
fornia? There such marriages are illegal,
and the local infatuated and ill-balanced
Miss who wants to marry an Asiatic has to
go north to British Columbia to perpetrate
her foolishness. Public sentiment would be
found almost wholly behind such a measure ;
the only opposition would come from the
small knot of brethren who continue to
preach the futile old gag that “all men are
brothers,” but would mostly faint if they
were told that their daughter was “walking
out” with a Chow vegetable John. Fur-
ther, cohabitation between the two races
should be made illegal, with a penalty on
both the male and female. What is the use
of orating about a White Australia when
Chows and Hindus are allowed to marry
our white women and breed piebald Aus-
tralians?
“Ru” : A newsboy was punished the other
day in Melbourne for yelling his wares too
loudly, and a lot of people were filled with
holy glee. I want something done to the
German band. Why an able-bodied mob
should be allowed to block the streets in
business hours, making noises that are
merely distressing to those who are doing
real work, has long been a great mystery.
Also, why are they allowed to publicly beg
for alms? Is a man supposed to have a
special privilege like the blind and lame
because he is too lazy to do honest work,
and chooses to blow wind into an idiotic,
tube of brass for several hours a day? Tom
Carlyle defined dirt as “matter in the wrong
place.” The German band is in the wrong
place; therefore, the German band is dirt.
If the Gaud Mayor and City Council' of
Sydney want clean streets, let them give the
tram tickets a rest and remove the big dirt
first. Failing that, somebody will rise one
of these days and kill the German band with
an axe, and when the case is put fairly to
the jury, it will bring in a verdict of “Highly
Commended,” or words to that effect.
“N or M”: Hobart is seeing beautiful
visions. Its big pier stretches to comple-
tion, and will soon be prepared to accom-
modate anything afloat. Its length will be
1210; the depth of water is 60-odd ft., and
the approach is broad and deep and without
rocky vertebrae. Each year sees the build-
ing of larger and yet larger vessels. The
White Star line’s latest addition runs to
18,000 tons —too ponderous a monster to
play tricks with the Melbourne rip, which,
it will be remembered, showed claws to a
far smaller vessel a short time ago. The
depth of water there is all right in calm
weather, but a heavy sea alters the case,
and a big liner, wallowing in a trough, finds
the lid of Davey Jones’s locker dangerously
close. And to hang about waiting for the
weather to moderate means an expense of
at least £5OO a day. So Hobart sees itself
becoming a depbt for oversea trade and a
great distributing centre, and it already
wonders where it should put the long-talked-
of docks
CLEANED OUT.
DR. K VL-HALL: “You see, I put old Jones on
his feet again!”
HIS F RIEND: “Yes, I noticed he drove his car
before, and can't even afford a tram [?]are
now."
A favorite caffi is endeavoring to infuse a
purple note into the oppressive grey calm
that sits on Melbourne in the early Sabbath
hours. Some of the Most Expensive, who
love to play at being wildly Continental, are
supporting the idea, which consists of get-
ting fizzy refreshments between midnight
and cockcrow from the hands of a masked
female, who also does a mild turn that fails
to bring a blush to the cheek of the most
hopeful. No outsider can secure a seat,
much less a table, for this late revelry. Seri-
ously considered, the mask is a pretentious
fraud. A Collins-street milliner with vaude-
ville yearnings alternates the star role of
mystery with a little soubrette who isn’t
continuously behind the footlights. It is all
very painstaking, and the simplest sinner
wili find it not worth the sacrifice of a
Good Night’s Rest.
TACTICS.
“Hullo, pore Bill’s got his gruel!"
“Oh, pore Bill’s awl right — ’e’s just lyin’ low."
“Montalex”: “0.1 v.” (B. 20/3/T3) gets
right on to the nail. I wear no creedal
label myself, but, as an Irishman, I have
always strongly objected to the R.C. at-
tempt to make a “corner” in Nationalism.
To say nothing more of Parnell —an Angli-
can of English descent —has “the Church”
so soon forgotten Robert Emmett, Wolfe
Tone, Smith O’Brien, Lord Edward Fitz-
gerald, and all the rest of the non-Catholics
who fought in the front rank of National-
ism? The present writer’s grandfather was
a member of the last Irish Parliament; and
I know that he was offered a heavy bribe
(not in money) to vote in favor of the
Union, and —Anglican, Tory and military
man though he was —promptly and scorn-
fully refused it.
“Pontius Potter”: Hobart has an untidy
way of burying its dead. Years ago, in the
old insanitary days, the good English cus-
tom of planting corpses around a church
was adopted. It may have been conducive
to the odor of sanctity, but it left the city
with a sprinkling of weed-grown and aban-
doned graveyards that would shed discredit
on an Asiatic community. Within gunshot
of the G.P.O. half a dozen crumbling and
decrepit cemeteries are failing desperately
to hide the bones of their occupants. Vaults
have burst open, and disclose the rotting re-
mains of cheap coffins mingled with gaping
skulls. Sportive dogs leap down and rum-
mage among the bones of the dear departed,
and small boys try their marksmanship with
stones on the plaster angels that cant drun-
ltenly on the verge of yawning sepulchres.
In the summer the rank weeds catch fire,
and the woodwork railings get charred a
funereal black, and occasionally the stone
boundary walls collapse in places and spread
over the adjacent tombs. Citizens whose
incomes will not allow them to pay the
necessary sum that entitles them to the ser-
vices of the municipal dustman creep out by
night and deposit their refuse in the handi-
est subsided grave. The trouble is that the
churches derive no more "revenue from these
boneyards, and when God’s acre ceases to
pay a dividend it goes the way of other
non-paying business propositions. The more-
recently deceased are getting no better at-
tention, and Private Enterprise is stowing
them away on the same old principle in the
midst of residential suburbs. The fool-law
that demands a grave to be at least 6ft.
deep neglects to remark how many bodies
may be buried therein. The result is that
to say that certain departed are entombed
is to exaggerate the case. Altogether, Hobart
is not the place that a tidy man would
choose to die in, and the neglect of the
authorities is making it a bad place for the
casual resident who has a desire to live.
The other day, J. Bull handed out 18
months’ gaol to the aristocratic Suffragette
who fired the Ivew Tea Gardens. On the
same day, a mere laboring bloke was
awarded seven years for making a bonfire of
some cocky’s hay stacks in Kent. The labor-
ing person may think he got a compara-
tively unfair deal, particularly as the Anarch-
istic female will, in all probability, starve
her way out within 18 days; and he will
know better for the future. When next he
has an edge on a man. he will get the missus
or the best girl to join the nearest Suffra-
gette league. She can then dynamite his
enemy’s residence, poison his whisky, or tie
kerosene-tins to the tail of his house-dog
with impunity—or next door to it.
THE ONLY WAY.
“I've promised the wife to give up drink from
the first of the year.”
“How will you manage it?”
“Send her away for a holiday."
THE HOLY BLOUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The open-work blouse will live in fashion ; and
skirts, though they may change a little, will pro-
bably keep the curves of the figure now so much
admired. — Fashion item.
Who makes a poem to his mistress’ brow
(A faultless crescent over starry eyes)
Is too ideal for our ladies now,
Who care not inspiration for, nor sighs ;
And so my ardent glance makes gay carouse
Around the yoke of Muriel Edith’s blouse.
Man he makes garments for his nakedness;
Women use clothes their charms to advertise.
Once crinolines and all their swollen dress
Hinted at beauty, which was mostly lies;
And Princess robes that only youth could bear
Were fatal to the lady fat and fair.
And then the bustle, to exaggerate
The part that schoolboys used once to be taught
on ;
Man’s coats, superfluously to state
That woman likes as manly to be thought on ;
And then she threw away these modes of apes,
And was converted to her primal shapes.
Tight bodice, tight short skirt and curven stays
To make her figure an imperfect S
(For which her trepidatious tamer pays)—
The front and southern bourgeons of her dress
At last, returning to her ancient shape,
That snake who Eden shared with the First Ape.
Now, by the straight front and the swelling bust,
By grace of webbing and suspenders she
Raises the reptile’s shape from ancient dust
(Ere Adam lost his job in Arcady),
And comes to ask us with her ancient lies
To start an orchard in New Paradise.
I’ll make no moan unto a brow of light;
I’ll sing no verses praying “Death come soon”;
I’ll not grow hoarse by crying to the night;
I’ll raise no howling rhymes unto the moon;
A cage of lace my waking thoughts shall house -
The teasing perforations of the blouse.
Flesh-pink beneath the ventilated white,
Flesh-pink the breeze knows, though I may not
see —
Oh, ivory column gleaming in the night,
The neck that grows out of sweet mystery !
Oh, Sol., thy life has chosen well, well done !
Wise Singer of the Song! Oh, Solomon!
Lips of geranium, skin of cream and rose;
The eyes like pools; the brow as white as milk ;
The dainty head and its mock-haughty pose;
The neck of ivory that shines as silk;
The glance that’s daring and yet seems afraid —
The terror of becoming an old maid.
And the arcana, underneath the laces,
Hinting near facts and mystery far away,
The unknown beauties of the fragrant places,
The ears pink as the shell new-flushed with day;
A breath like scent of hay and breath of cows,
Above the meshes of that meat-safe blouse.
I care not how all other ladies dress,
Nor when, if she change not, all fashions cease !
Oh, blouse, the haven of white silences,
Hiding from men the snowy hills of peace;
Let fashion go in hoops; or, nude, carouse,
So long as Muriel wears a Holy Blouse!

One of the most humorous results of par-
son Albert Knight’s bolt with his best girl
was the Bishop of Ripon’s personal address
to the flock of the wandering shepherd. The
Bishop was introducing a temporary shep-
herd to the forsaken ones, and he spake as
follows:—■
Y ? U L h m\ gon fu throug i 1 a fier y trial of faith. You
must hold together and stand firm and steady for
your faith which has been so sorely tried. Mav
the winter of this discouragement be turned into a
glorious spring-time!
Now, the simple truth is that the brethren
had been enjoying the time of their lives.
Their cup of scandal had been filled to over-
flowing and sugared with three lumps. They
had derived the greatest possible spiritual
satisfaction from assuring one another that
the shepherd’s little lapse was just what
they had feared would happen, inasmuch as
the young woman was no better than thev
had expected. What the deali Bishop called
°f faith " was, therefore, a
delightfully warm realisation of their most
cherished suspicions.
THE GREATER TRAGEDY.
SHE: “I think a woman must be cracked who
goes to bargain sales.”
H E: "Yes; but it’s worse for her husband —he
gets broke.”
NATURAL LAW IN THE SPIRITUOUS WORLD.
LAWYER (badgering Witness): “How many whiskies had you before 10.15?”
WITNESS ( ge tting tired of it ): "Oh, I dunno. I don't put down every drink I have.”
THE BENCH (chipping in): “ No? I hen what do you do with it?”
at 4i le liev - A# I' aw - Preaching at St. Paul’s,
Melbourne, on ‘ social cancers,” quoted with
emphasis: “Go to now, ye rich men, weep

the text _as an unworthy reference to the
forthcoming referendum.
“Paroa” : Maoriland has
been under a cloud of
smoke for the last month
or two, in addition to its
usual pall of mortgages.
Amongst other things con-
sumed is “Hone Heke’s
flagstaff,” at Russell—
about the most historic
relic in the whole country.
1 A scrub fire did for it
what Hone Heke and an
axe did for its predecessors
no less than three times
nearly 70 years ago. Many
reasons have beeft given
for this action of his, such
as that he regarded the
flag as the emblem of the
enslavement of the Maori;
but the Maori version was
that it was an emblem of
tapu to keep trading ships
away. So Hone Heke,
being covetous of rifles,
powder, etc., made his first
chop at the flagstaff. It
happened that just as he
did so Customs duties were
repealed, and ships came
trading to Russell again.
Naturally he thought he
had hold of the right end
of the stick, so he chopped
down the thing as soon as
it was put up again. The
third time he went a bit
further, and, on March 11,
1845, not only chopped
down the flagstaff, but
sacked and burned Russell,
or Kororareka, as it was
called then. And so began
the first Maori War.
According to a breathless cable message,
Ohio (U.S.A.) is threatened with something
extra-special in the way of Wowser legisla-
tion. A political person called Capple is
feeling dreadfully shocked at the immodest
dress now worn by women, and is introduc-
ing a Bill to keep the fashions in the way
they should go. Women’s dresses must be
solid affairs, with no holes in the lace or em-
broidery, and not one particle of skin must
be allowed to show more than 2in. below the
neck. But, really, if the people of Ohio are
ail such prurient-minded decadents as the
proposed measure suggests, wouldn’t it be
better to shut them all up in an asylum?
“Warrumbucca’s” kick:—
Someone in authority should be led out in the
cold grey dawn and shot or otherwise suitably
dealt with. The N.S.W. troop trains provided for
transporting the Light Horse units from Ouean-
beyan to their various detraining stations after the
recent camp were a disgrace to a civilised com-
munity. I saw nearly all the trains leave Quean-
beyan when the camp was struck, and had the plea-
sure of a long trip in one myself. Not one lava-

tory carriage Was provided, and, in some cases,
troopers were fired into ordinary suburban car-
riages for a long distance journey. I do not know
whether the Molonglo River water was responsible,
but diarrhoea was epidemic in camp, and the ab-
sence of lavatory accommodation was severely felt.
As fully 80 per cent, of the Mounted troops are
serving voluntarily in order to gain practical know-
ledge of defence, it seems to me that the best car
riages available should have been placed at their
disposal, while the derelicts might have been passed
on to the bagmen, politicians, etc., who, as a rule,
do not care a darn about National Defence. When
the time comes the average Australian Light Horse-
man will be prepared to travel by cattle truck, if
necessary, but in piping times of peace he should
be provided with, at least, decent accommodation.
England’s White Slave Traffic, bad as it
is, is small potatoes alongside some of the
awful results of Freetrade and Low Wages.
At the Pioneer Club at Wellington (M.L.)
the other day an English visitor named Miss
Hodge put it as delicately as she could when
giving one reason for the Suffragettes’
uproar:—■
They were fighting to gain a living wage for the
sweated women of Britain, upon whose labor so
much of the revenue was built—labor that was so
badly paid that many of them found it impossible
to live, and so, unless they preferred death, were
forced to, live in the worst possible of all ways,
there were big firms in London, whose employees
were so badly paid that they were expected, to sup-
plement their wagfs in this way, and who were given
latchkeys as a hint that no questions would be asked
as to how they spent their off hours.
The Latchkeys of the Bottomless Pit digged

N.S.W. Full Court has brought all its
big guns to bear on one small bush pub. It
seems that in 1907 the Burrangong electo-
rate was graced with 40 puhs; one for
each day in Lent. In that year the electors
at the local-option poll voted Continuance.
In 1908 a publican in the electorate was
convicted of disrespect towards the law and
his license was cancelled, thus reducing the
Pubs to 39, one for each Article of the
Church. In 1910 the local-option poll again
happened along, and again the faithful voted
Continuance. In 1912 a prospective Bung
asked for a license to be granted. Local
Wowserdom hotly opposed the application
on the ground that the electors had voted
Continuance the second time on 39 pubs,
while if the license were given the number
would .be 40; and it was argued that
Wade’s Liquor Act doesn’t allow opinions
to be expressed on the ballot paper in favor
of more pubs. The Licensing Bench held
that 40 was the original number of licenses
allowable, and to the joy of the thirsty the
Full Court upheld this sensible view.
* * * *
“Briner”: Studying the log of our cruiser
the Melbourne, I thought of Graham Berry
as, in a manner, the virtual author of the
present strength of the English Navy. Eng-
land was quite satisfied witih its fleet when
Berry, as Victorian Agent-General, flung a
bombshell at the Colonial Institute. He
declared that the English navy must be
enormously strengthened, and claimed a
fleet equal to that of all the rest of the
world! Of course Germany was small
potatoes then; France was much ahead.
Berry particularly declared that the coaling
stations were unprotected. This fired Tenny-
son into writing his celebrated poem on
Naval Weakness. By his express direction
an extract from Graham Berry’s speech is
prefixed in every edition of that poem. A
national clamor arose. The Admiralty pro-
posed building 70 vessels. Randolph
Churchill, then Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, opposed this programme, and his
fall resulted. By a coincidence, his son
Winston also opposed recent naval exten-
sions ; but he changed his tune when, ap-
pointed to the Admiralty, he could get at
the back of things. The 70 vessels author-
ised in 1889 were followed by another large
order (the Spencer) in 1894; and soon
Germany came in to flog England up some
more.
The illustrious Justice Ed-
wards, during the recent crim-
inal sessions at Auckland
(M.L.), handed down the cat
for the flogging of four sexual
lunatics (one an old man).
Owing to a flaw in the Act a
fifth escaped, much to the ex-
pressed regret of Edwards,
who promised to draw the at-
tention of the Minister of
Justice to the gap in the law,
so that the triangle might be
erected there also. If Ed-
wards’s remedy for the dis-
ease is not successful, The
Bulletin desires to draw the
attention of the Minister of
Justice to the fact that there
is still the rack, the boot, the
thumbscrew, the searing iron,
and, if the worst comes to the
worst, the faggot and the
torch.
The scriptural dictum that “unto him that
hath shall be given,” seems to have been laid
to heart by the Federal Government, which
recently announced its contribution of
£2OOO to the Scott fund. Yet the splendid
heroism of the miners at Mount Lyell, which
was displayed in the hour of real need, and
not to win fame or titles, obtained only—
let’s see? What was the princely sum which
ex-miner Fisher’s Ministry voted to the
fund for the relief of the Lyell widows and
orphans?
DUE OSTENTATION.

And en-er-get-i-cal-ly smack it.

A bunch of guns and maddened horses,

Or hide her flight beneath a bushel.

Abominate equivocation,
And hold the nation should afford
Each Earl his proper ostentation.

Should have a crimson uniform,
And like a tropic thunderstorm
Descend upon the lower orders !

“Sundown Jack”: Bill had been skiting
about his rough riding experiences when the publi-
can mentioned that there was an “outlaw” in the
yard. Did Bill reckon he could ride it? Bill reck-
oned he could ride it round the spouting of the
pub roof. So they poured an enthusiastic drink (or,
maybe, two) into him. Then Bill viewed the horse,
and they had another drink. He chose a saddle
and then there was a bob in (somebody put in Bill’s
bob). Then Bill remarked that it was a long time
since he had tamed an outlaw, and the crowd sus-
pected that Wm. was getting cold feet. So they
started to put a pint (or, mayhap, a quart) of Dutch
courage into him. Each stage in the process of
catching and saddling required another nerve
soother. He had a final one before he gathered his
reins and grasped the stirrup. All stood dumb-
founded. Perhaps they had judged him unjustly.
Then Bill's mate stepped from the spectators, and,
tapping him on the shoulder, said: “Bill, remember
the promise you made your dying mother.” With a
bowed head Bill stepped back from the tame moke.
“Boys,” he said; “it’s a fact. I promised mother
I’d never ride another outlaw. I can’t do it.” With
that he staggered from the yard, but far be it from
me to suggest that Billiam staggered through drink.
It was emotion at the thought of his dying mother
that got him down and sat on him.
“Karee”: Can “yabber plenty” many an
abo. dialect, but, have never struck “Myola.” The
nearest to it I know of is “Myalla”—bark coffin or
burying ground, and “Mawoollah”- —corroboree or
initiation place. A euphonious and appropriate ap-
pelation for Kink’s capital would have been “Mool-
looyan”—plenty dust. Or Baltabbilla —no-plurry-
water.
CONSTERNATION IN TOPHET.
The arrival of some of the Sydney milk supply.
“Pick” : Talking of “runaway holes.” Near
the Bungonia Look Down(N.S.W.), at the lower end of
a deep gully, a considerable stream pours firstly into
a roomy cave, and thence drops down an enormous
perpendicular shaft. Without again seeing the light,
the waters reach the Shoalhaven River at a point
over a thousand feet below the entrance to the shaft.
The underground passages are about five miles long,
The shaft itself has been explored during dry times.
At the bottom there is a series of limestone caves,
with a marvellous splendor of stalactites, stalag-
mites and petrified reeds. Ingress to some of these
wonders has of late years been made easier by
means of a few ladder ways, and the place has be-
come a popular local ‘resort, though it is still without
the conveniences that its interest entitles it to.
‘Silas Snell” : Donn started it. He went
over the Hump to visit the Colletts one Sunday after-
noon, and planted expectations in the heart of
Ann. He had met Ann at Scower’s hop the night
before, and the Sunday afternoon visit was a curious
coincidence, to say the least of it. The Hump was
not a considerable elevation, but a jaunt over it
to John Collett's house on the Springs side was try-
ing on a hot Sunday. Tommy’s second visit took him
to Collett’s fence at the foot of the Hump, a
quarter of a mile this side of the Collett demesne.
Ihe couple met there three times. Then the meeting
place shifted a quarter of a mile up the east side
of the rise, still further from the home of Ann. It
lingered there a week or two, when the rendezvous
jumped another couple of hundred yards up hill. In
three months it arrived at the top of the Hump, and
oscillated round the apex for some time. In seven
weeks the tryst started down the west side. It
reached Hanging Rock in February. By March 2
it had arrived at Bill’s Leap, and on the third
day of April Tommy and Ann met at Tommy's log
fence. On the Sunday following, Tommy Donn found
Ann sitting on the red rock near his hut, when he
awoke from a prolonged after-dinner nap. At the red
rock Tommy made a brave stand for a matter of 80
days; then one afternoon he gathered his belongings
into a blue blanket, and started off down the iron-
stone road. Ann intercepted him at Wonnan’s corner,
and Tommy explained that he was just taking swag
exercise to keep his back in, and allowed Miss Col-
lett to lead him home again. Two weeks after this,
Tommy, with the same weight up, made a dash for
the station at Honeysuckle. Ann encountered him
on the platform, and Tommy explained that he was
expecting an uncle of his from London. Mr. Donn
was rather moody throughout the walk home. At
the red rock he faced Ann. “Look ’ere,” he said sul-
lenly. “The fact iv it is, yo’re wantin’ t’ marry me,
’n’ it’s no use yer tryin’ t’ hide it!” After that,
subterfuge was useless. Ann married him.
“D.M.” : Is the Australian the biggest leg-
puller on earth, or what happens to the strangers
from oversea that, after talking to a few of us, they
write such gorgeous information about this country?
The other day “The Empire Annual for Australian
Girls,” edited by A. R. Buckland, M.A., wandered
into my house. One section is devoted to “Some
Australian Snake Stories,” by W. T. Greene, M.D.,
M.A., F.Z.S., and this is how he begins:—
There are many kinds of snakes in Australia, many
of which are extremely venomous—the diamond
snake, for instance, the carpet snake, . the whip-
snake and others.
He goes on to relate that travelling in the Plenty
district (near Melbourne), his companion picked up
a piece of curled wattle-bark, from the end of which
glided a diamond snake of the largest dimensions —
“that is to say, nearly three fest long! ”
Had my companion... .been bitten by the reptile
his tenure of existence would have been summarily
terminated in from 20 to 30 minutes.... There are
harmless snakes in the Australian bush as well as
venomous ones, and among the former is the black
snake, or southern python.
And not a word of warning is given against the
deadly jim-jam, which teaches its young to pursue
remittance men. Too bad !
“Mallarapoonie”: In case the Methodist
Conference or some other body of sports is short of
a thrill, let me recommend alligator trapping. The
best style of ’gator trap is a narrow stub yard,
shaped like a cattle race, and built on the tide-wash
with wings opening to the
water’s edge; while the most
efficient bait is an aged he-
goat. William, very much alive,
is placed in a small enclosure at
the landward end of the ’gator
pen, and when the saurian saun-
ters up to investigate, he inad-
vertently engages the mechanism
of a trapdoor, which falls unex-
pectedly behind him. An ad-
junct hereabouts is a rough
gallows, erected over the ’gator
pen, so that the beast may be
handled with facility. Only
scientists or late arrivals in the
country ever shoot or kill a ’gator
in his trap. A corpse of that
kind on the premises is too
dreadful. The old hand of North
Australia nooses his capture by
the neck, hauls him up to the
temporary gallows, and, while his
forepaws claw the south-west
breeze, methodically disembowels
him. The beast is then freed,
and waddles to the beach and heads for the open sea,
showing amazing vitality until the sharks, attracted
by the scent of blood, rush him, or, failing sharks,
his own kind set upon him like wolves.
“Grallina”: I can tell “Mallarapoonie”
(B. 20/2/’l3) of another dumb animal that can
count fairly well, and that is the nag that earns his
oats in any coal mine in the Newcastle or Maitland
district. I’ve seen him bringing out heavy loads
from the bords, day after day, to the accompani-
ment of the yells and screeches of the wheelers. But
sometimes a driver who is on a “you’ll do” (i.e.. a
bribe from the miner to give him more than his
ordinary share of skips) will try to put an extra
tub on to Pilot. That is where his arithmetic comes
in. He counts the jerks as the couplings draw tight,
and if there is an extra bump he stops, and neither
sleepers nor iron sprags can persuade him to budge
an inch.
“Yam”: The assertion by “Fax” (B.
27/2/’l3) that “the tuberculin test for cattle is of
no value,” is opposed to the dictum of the highest
scientific authorities. The final report of the English
Royal Commission (which sat from 1901-1911) states
that the test is absolutely reliable. Not until the
tissue of the udder is breaking down with tubercular
disease, or the cow is becoming emaciated, is the
secretion of milk visibly affected; so, before any-
thing can be detected by sight, the cow may for
months be giving poisonous milk. It is horrible that
Fax and others should be content to wait until the
EVASIVE.
SERGEANT BRANNIGAN: “ Whin Oi sid to the accused, ‘Did ye stale Ring’s alliged
horrses last wake? the mahn gave me an [?] ansther."
MAGISTRATE: “ Well, what did he say?"
B RANIGAN: "He sid, 'Ye ould divvil, ax the pigs!’"
disease is in the advanced stages before culling the
cow. Re dirty milkers as described by “Jersey” (B.
6/2/’l3). There is no doubt at all about his re-
marks applying to a great many Victorian dairymen.
I know Gippsland well, and though a steady improve-
ment is going on in the districts supervised by the
Government, even they have still a long way to go.
But all of Gippsland is not under the Government
control, and not 50 p.c. of the entire State. The
balance is in the hands of the shire councils, and
their administration of sanitary laws in this regard
is either nominal or altogether farcical. Here in the
north-east of Victoria the conditions are deplorable.
It would be absurd to say that the dairying is done
on business lines, though there are a large number
of cows. Along the Murray the dairies in N.S.W.
are very much superior to the ones in Victoria. On the
Vic. side, as well as in Gippsland, the competition for
cream supply among the factories leads to faulty
grading of the cow-fat, and the pooling of the cream
in the churns tends to discourage the scrupulous care
necessary to produce a high-class butter, as the pro-
fits are also bulked.
EVERYTHING.
MRS. MURPHY: “ Hows everything at your
house, Mr. Hooligan?”
MR. HOOLIGAN (henpecked): "Oh, she's all
,oight, fank you."
“ J.C.A.”: We’ve got one or two coots at
home without waiting for the festive back bushman
from Manchester. We had a Queensland-born youth
up as surveyor’s apprentice, and he filled the comedy
part easy. The second day of his appearance he was
left to boil the billy while the party did a half-hour
job at the head of a line. On returning we found
him sitting on a log, looking at a billy full of water
and a heap of sticks. “Hullo,” says the boss, “have
you no matches?” “Yes, I have plenty matches,”
says his Nibs, “but I haven’t got a bit of news-
paper to start the fire with.”
“Southern Cross”: Anybody know why
the eaglehawk does not seem to increase and multi-
ply and wax prolific in Australia? He is a long
liver (has been credited with scores of years), and,
as far as I know, has no enemies ; and, as the old
people put in a claim for one to two maternity
bonuses every year, he should by this time be a
notable feature of the birdscape. Yet he is so rare
that, in a three months' trip on the South Coast
(N.S.W.), I saw only two or three of him, though
no poison is laid around those parts, and the wild
ranges afford an ideal home.
“Inehiquin”: “Yannatherra” is quite right
about the dog being the farmer’s best friend. Blake
was going to sell 300 sheep at the Millicent (S.A.)
market, and arranged (as he was 16 miles out)
to paddock them the night before the sale
at Brown’s. When he arrived there it was
getting dark, so he opened the gate, drove
the sheep into the paddock, and cantered on
to Brown's house. There he learnt that Brown had
forgotten the arrangement, and had left some 200
of his own sheep in the paddock. It was too late
and too dark then to do anything, so, resigning all
hope of drafting the sheep in time for the market,
Blake went to bed. Next morning his dog had
gone. Blake cursed himself for a fool for not
chaining him up, and rode off to the paddock.
Arrived there he found the gale open. He rode
all over the paddock. Brown's sheep were all
there, but not one of his own. Cursing, he shut
the gate and rode off to the market. There he found
his dog and his sheep. He kicked the dog for its
carelessness in leaving the gate open.

“A Perry-Winker’: Can anyone supply
'me, gratis, with a reliable remedy in the case of
a horse who has swallowed an overdose of paddy-
melon? Just at present my stable is in deep
mourning over the death of one of the horses; he
was A 1 in the morning, but a corpse in the
afternoon. And the only way I know to remove
the curse when it gets into the animal’s innards
is by a post-mortem, and a horse is never the same
when a coroner has finished with him. Just now
when the farm horses are out in the stubble —where
the melon seems to thrive—the time is ripe to hand
out any information on the subject.
* * * *
“Frae”: I’ve read all these endurance
stunts of mokes and blokes and other animals in
Australia with much patience, and now I propose to
quote a case which will out them all. At the
North-eastern Saw Mills, at Cheviot (Vic.), there
resided a cat with six kittens on her hands (father’s
address unknown). When they were a few weeks
old she used to bring home a small bird oc-
casionally, but one day she faded to return to the
mill from a hunting expedition. Nine days later,
one of the bushmen, returning from work, heard a
faint mewing from some bushes. On investigation,
he found the cat transfixed by a sharp stake, upon
which she had evidently landed when springing for
the earth from a tree trunk. She was in such a
position that it was only with her fore paws that
she could reach the ground. There she hung, and
endured untold agonies from the wound, exposure,
hunger and milk pressure. Nevertheless, the vitality
of the beast was such that when released and cared
for she rapidly recovered and took over the family,
which in the meantime had been boarding with a
frail young aunty.
DEAD EASY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Bill shakes hands with "Jh the mob
At Chance-it, on the Yarrangob,
You’ve got to understand
That Bill is bound for Sydney-side
To cut his cheque out good and wide
In style to beat the band.
For Bill has not been there before ;
In fact, I must say, furthermore,
He has not further sped
Than once or twice to Down-and-Out
To slake a predatory drought
And paint that small place red.
“Well, so long, Bill,” the boys once more
Shout after him in hearty roar,
And Bill he waved his dook.
When Ginger King ran up the hill,
And yelled, “I say, there, hold on, Bill;
I wanter ask yer—look,
When you get down to Sydney-side
Where do you reckon to reside?
Where will you bunk and grub?”
“Gorstruth,” says Bill, you oughter know!
When I get inter town—What-o 1
I’m stopping at the pub!

“WORTH POUNDS,” SAYS WANGANUI WOMAN.
“Nearly every summer I have an attack of dysen-
tery,” says Mrs. E. J. Vinall, Dublin Street, Wan-
ganui (N.Z.). “Last summer I was so bad with it
that I had to consult a doctor, and not getting any
relief from his prescription, decided to give Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy a trial. The re-
sult was amazing; I felt my usual self after three
doses. Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is
a wonderful medicine, and I would not be without a

“Gouger”: About the most cussed of all
the world’s beasts of burden is the donkey. I had
experience with a team of 17 over heavy sand coun-
try in AV.A., and that’s how I know. Also, I had
one blackboy with me, and that's how he knows.
Remember one morning when we had done six miles,
the sun poured down like liquid Sheol. . “Donkey
fellar travel all right come along night?” I asked
the blackboy. “Him fellar all right. Him walk
along quick night time,” the native replied. It was
16 miles to the next waterhole. AVe turned the team
out for a few hours, and started again in the cool of
the afternoon. All went well, until the dark set in.
That was the donkeys’ knock-off time, and they
stuck to the rules. I tried moral persuasion ; I tried
a little intellectual argument; I knocked the whip to
ribbons, smashed the handle, and lost my beautiful
contralto voice for ever. Meanwhile, the stars were
shining beautifully from the far-off heavens. I sat
down exhausted, while the boy unyoked the team and
drove them five miles back to the waterhole. Never-
theless, it is marvellous the weights the little brutes
will carry. One team of 24 used to pull a load of
seven tons over 200 miles to a way-out station in
N.AV. Australia. The trouble is to get them loaded
and started. I’ve seen them pull the packs off with
their teeth and kick the stuffing out of them. I’d
as soon try to manage 17 wives as 17 donkeys, and
that’s putting the case as fairly as I can for all
parties.
THE WANDERER'S RETURN.
“By cripes, they've pulled down the poor old
pub and built an empty paddock in its
place. ”
“Kukipi” : Re “Yarrum’s” pet shark (B.
31/10/’l2). In the AVilliams River (Papua) there
is a huge alligator known amongst us white men as
“John William.” He is the chief marine scavenger
of the native village of Motu-motu, and sometimes
disputes with the village pigs for pride of place as
principal land-garbage remover, also. In these
encounters the hogs generally get the worst of the
argument. Should a nigger be in the way when
John AVilliam is carrying out his land duties, the
nigger is removed, too. It is quite a daily event to
see John AVm. swimming near the shore where the
village is built, and in view of any natives who may
be on the beach. Should they jeer at him or throw
stones. Jno. AV. treats the matter with contempt.
a vessel anchors off Motu-motu, he noses
around for anything he may pick up. On one occa-
sion an oil launch, which is Often in the river, and
whose captain knows John’s ways, happened to be
anchored near the shore opposite the village. The
saurian came along as usual, and endeavored to get
aboard. A passenger, becoming alarmed, beat him
off, whereupon the captain interjected, “AVhatcher
hittin’ John AVilliam for ? He’s hungry, and only
came around for a feed.” And with that the
skipper passed a junk of salt beef overboard. John
AVilliam collared it, and swam off.

BOUNDARY RIDER: “ Why you kick up big row with Billy?"
MARY ANN: "That pheller no good! He play cards all lars week an ' lose all my plurry

“Windy Wellington”: Let the immi-
grant score one. He was engaged on the wharf here
unloading Oregon pine. The other day all hands
were carrying 4x2 scantlings from the ship and
dumping them on the wharf. The Yank crew every time
carried two pieces and hustled like bees. Not so
new-chum Pat. He carried one every time, and did
it with a sedate stride. AVhen the mate observed
it he went for Pat: “You lazy hound, why in
thunder don’t you take two, the same load as the
others? I don’t want to be here till Christmas.”
Pat looked very serious. “Ut’s this way,” he said,
“the other divils are too lazy to walk back for
the second piece.”
* * * *
“N. or M.” : “Tiaki’s” remarks anent the
perils of timber-getting recall a grim accident that
occurred at the Huon, where the big Tasmanian trees
come from. Bill and Tom were busy chopping out
a living, when Bill’s
axe slipped and,
shearing clean across
one foot, left a sick-
ening gash. It was
no time to go for
help. His mate, real-
ising the need for im-
mediate treatment,
got the half-fainting
man on his back, and
toiled off with him to
the doctor, Bill re-
marking feebly now
and then that his
boot was dripping
blood. Fortunately
the doctor was at
home, and the boot
having been carefully
cut away, it was
found that there had been no luemonTage—for the
reason that the skin was not broken; the gash ex-
tending no deeper than the leather. It takes Tom
to tell the rest of the story ; but no respectable
family paper would print it.
* * * *
“Fax” : “N. or M.” and “Leo Lear” (B.
9/1/’ 13 and 6/2/’l3) are very emphatic in calling
the starling an imported pest, and have hardly a
good word to say for him. I would advise them to
visit this district (Yarram, South Gippsland). Down
here we mention the starling in our prayers. The
bird made its appearance here five seasons ago, and
in that time it has wiped the grasshopper curse
right out, and is now busy doing ditto to the cater-
pillars. And when it has finished the caterpillar it
will probably tackle the fruit, or the cows, or our-
selves. There is no more striking spectacle than
that of a Starling .eating a cow.
. “Bulloak”: Daly had reached the stage
where he saw red, white and blue jim-jams pouring
out of the bedpost, wherefore they put him into the
Inebriates’ Retreat. He had resided there a few
weeks when we heard rumors of his complete re-
covery, so McGuire went to visit his pal and make
certain. On his return I asked McGuire how Daly
was. “He’s no better,” says Mac, “and between me
and you he’s getting worse.” “How’s that ?” says
I. “Well,” says he, “I put it to Daly, ‘How are
you, old man?” and he said he niver felt so well in
his life. So I says, ‘Never see no snakes, Daly ?’
‘Nary a one,’ says he. And, would you believe it, all
the time he was speakin’ the things was climbing
and creeping all over him.”
“Poonie”: I don’t want to appear argu-
mentative, but must dispute “Te Babarantiko’s”
statcfflfent (B. 13/2/’l3) that T. Tanna, Esq., of the
South Pacific Islands, is not a decadent institution.
I can’t supply figures, for the reason that, in many
instances, figures relating to the ravages of disease
among South Sea Islanders simply don’t exist; but
my own personal knowledge convinces me that “Te
Babarantiko” is wrong in his generalities however
correct he may be in his specific instances. AVhere-
ever the march of white “civilisation” has pro-
gressed in Oceania the brown races have invariably
gone down. Not only that, but “civilisation” (of an
unspeakably loathsome order, in many instances)
visited atolls and islands where it didn’t take up its
permanent abode, but merely remained long enough
to leave a dreadful reminder of its stay. And where
the Asiatic either followed the white in the Pacific,
or was introduced by him, leprosy was heaped on
syphilis, as shame might follow shame, or as one
injustice might be piled upon another. In the Fiji
group, in Tonga and the Ellice Islands, and in most
of the older-settled quarters of the Pacific, the brpwn
race has suffered all the time. Only lately, right
under our noses in Australian-administered and sup-
posedly-clean Papua, and within hail of the big
white settlement of Port Moresby, where a Govern-
ment medical officer and supervisor of native troubles
has resided for the last 20 years, cases of both loath-
some diseases have been dragged to light. And if
the medical officer lately appointed to inquire into
disease in Papua can dig out leprosy and things in
CORNISH RECRIMINTIONS.
1ST COUSIN JOHN: “ When thee'st open thy

2ND COUSIN JOHN: “And what thee'st open

such a place as the village of Hanuabada, Heaven
help the less-known centres of native population!
To my certain knowledge, many of the inhabitants
of the outlying archipelagos of Papua—from Sudest
to Woodlark and the Trobriands, and back again to
the mainland—are sufferers more or less from the
Red Plague; and there’s nothing much surer than
that to produce decay in a people.
“Eddyson”: Crater was held to be blame-
worthy. It was he who incited the Rev. Walter
AVinterfleld to visit Cup-Cup. Meeting the R ev
Winterfield at Cross-roads, sitting dubiously in his
buggy, Crater had paused to give advice and invite
confidence. Cup-Cup, he said, was a place offering
a spacious opening for evangelical enterprise. Cure
Cup was without priest or parson, and five weddings
and three christenings had accumulated, pending the
arrival of a certified clergyman. There had not been
a service at C'up-Cup in eight months. In fact, Cup-
Cup was a splendid stand for a parson seeking to
spread Christian knowledge and make an attractive
collection of threepenny-bits. The Rev, Walter
AVinterfleld needed no further persuasion; he whipped
up, and took the road to Cup-Cup. He had re-
ceived his call, he said. Cup-Cup welcomed the Rev.
Walter. He put up at Crater’s, and was attended
with infinite care and given the best of everything.
He performed four marriage ceremonies and three
christenings at fancy prices, and his service in Cole’s
Hall was so great a success that he followed it up
with two lectures, one for men only, the other for
women only, one shilling admission. Cup-Cup is
bitter about those lectures to this day. They were
a grievous disappointment. Then good Parson AVin-
terfield disappeared in a most mysterious manner.
His clerical suit was found on the banks of Crab
Creek, and Cup-Cup was thrown into a state of pro-
found emotion. For two days the adult male popu-
lation devoted itself to fishing for the missing shep-
herd in the waterholes along Crab Creek. Several
tradespeople who held the Rev. AValter’s cheques
betrayed a touching uneasiness. AA’alter had not
paid Crater at all. Neither had he paid for the
stabling of his horse. In fact, Mr. AVinterfleld had
been exceedingly remiss in making payments, but
had collected with commendable promptitude. On
the fourth day the cheques came back, each endorsed
very legibly in a firm, round hand, “No account.”
The third day brought the Rev. Ephraim Chill, a
small, timid, wrinkled clergyman of 30, who said
he had been recommended to the place by a tall
stranger with a blue wart on his chin. AA’interfielrl
was tall, and had a blue wart on his chin. “The
good fellow told me I should presently find a cry-
ing need for a minister of the Gospel at C'up-Cup,”
said little Mr. Chill. “He gave me this letter of
introduction to you as a prominent personage.” Chill
presented the letter to Crater. It ran: “Give North,
and Ambury, and Kettlewell, and Smith my compli-
ments, and urge them to get married again imme-
diately. I forward herewith a guaranteed parson.
—Yours sine., AV. AATnterfield.” So AValter AA’in-
terfield was no clergyman. Once more the four
couples made haste to the wedding. Cup-Cup was
out about £BO, and had bnly the horse and buggy
to recompense it. Subsequent disclosures enlight-
ened it on that point. The horse and trap, with a
bag of parsonical garments, had been stolen from the
front gate of an Anglican clergyman at Ballarat.
Furthermore, AValter AVinterfleld had sold the turn-
out to Hodgkin, of Tip-Top.
“Mowyle”: The star act of the great
comic opera, “Re<T Tape Tangles,” has just been sup-
plied to a South Australian town by the colored
comedian. For months past manless and bulldogless
households have spent the broiling nights in armored
garrisons, with the keyhole barricaded and the poker
under the pillow. The cause was “Peeping Tom,”
an elusive nocturnal marauder with a taste for bed-
room windows as a favorite means of entrance and
exit. Through a piece of woefully inartistic care-
lessness, which can only be ascribed to too much
civilisation, the peeper has at length been identified
as none other than the official black tracker of the
local police force. After conscientiously tracking
himself to some non-committal dead end, his sense
of security as a specialist proved his undoing. The
carefully lost trail was picked up later by the police
and followed back to departmental headquarters,
while a hat dropped at one of the elusive one’s ports
of call and boots retaining some of the country
traversed did the rest. The giddy jester has fled at
full speed on account of ill health, and will
reside in future at one of the native reserves where
windows are few and nobody seriously minds what
anybody else sees by night or by day.
“Wal” : The remarks of “Te Babarantiko”
(B. 13/2/’l3) re the tridacna clam of the South
Seas ate correct in regard to
the monster on the beach in one
of the Gilbert Island lagoons,
but I think that there is even a
bigger specimen (alive) on a
reef near the island of Mailu,
Papua. It measured quite 4ft.
along the closed lips, and,
although seven natives and my-
self worked for some three hours
trying to shift it out of the
coral, in which it was embedded,
we had to abandon it on the tide
rising. When I say that it bit
a 6in. mangrove pole clean
through, it will be seen it was
worthy to be called a patriarch
amongst clams. Some four years
ago a beachcomber brought a
big one into Maopa, Papua,
which scaled over 6cwt., and I am certain the one
at Mailu was almost as heavy again.
“Barnder”: “Pick” wants reliable infor-
mation regarding any latter-day performance of
black-trackers. Here is one experience. About three
years ago a blackboy, by name Jimmy Keating, was
murdered with an axe on Lily Creek, Cairns (N.Q.),
Suspicion fell on another nigger named Charlie Gor-
don, who had last been seen in his company, and was
missing the next day. The police called in the ser
vices of tracker Jacky Sullivan, a nigger who ha
been brought up amongst whites. J-cky tracked
Gordon across country for 47 miles to Mareeba, where
he was located hiding in a yard. When thq. police
rushed in one side he rushed out the other, an
again made for the bush. After another 20 miles o
tracking, they ran him to earth in a timber-hauler s
hut, where he had gone for some tea. I know other
instances; but that’s my contribution.
THE DINGOES DOWN THE CREEK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It isn’t what you drank before you banged into your
bunk,
Though it may be that your midnight griefs in
shilling tea are sunk;
But when you wake and shudder with strange geese
upon your grave,
AVhen you hear the yelping chorus and the howling
starts to rave,
When within the black bush shadows all the tongues
of sorrow speak,
You will learn the hidden anguish of the dingoes
down the creek.
Did you leave your love in Melbourne with her sleep-
less pillow wet?
(By the look she wore at parting she’ll be grieving
for you yet),
Now you’ve blewed your blessed wages on the blisses
of Outback,
And you’ve got to write and tell her that vou'H have
to keep the track —
Oh, you'll think of her at midnight when you start
at every shriek,
For the dingoes prod like conscience when they’re
howling down the creek.
You may be as hard as anvils, with a tough and
calloused soul,
Blanketed and fully nourished, and prepared to
nicely roll
Down the quiet seas of slumber, broad and billowy
and deep,
Or your mellow pipe’s narcotic may have lulled your
crimes to sleep;
But your own familiar devil will display the yellow
streak
AA’hen the dingoes howl together like the lost along
the creek.

This is not the first time the Bar of N. S.

sworn on the same day, but the boycott was

At the luncheon which followed the chris-

zen, who evidently attributed their absence
to the fact that the blackguardly Labor Gov-

Died in Adelaide, suddenly, Alexander
Clark, who had taught nearly half of young
S. Aus. how to sing, more or less. He had
been training the young idea for 55 years—
first in a Great Western Railway school in
England, then at St. Andrew’s Cathedral
School in Sydney, and, finally, starting
nearly 40 years ago, under the S. Aus. De-
partment. He head-mastered some of the
biggest schools in the State; but his heart
was always with his singing and his soldier-
ing, and he trained tens of thousands of
youngsters for the public school indoor
‘displays” that are a feature of S. Aus-
tralian life.
The Oldest Inhabitant has his doubts:—
Mr. George Hamilton, who died at Ben Bullen
near Oapertee (N.S.W.), a few days ago, at the re-
puted age of 110 years and seven months, claimed
to be the son of a Colonel Hamilton, and to have
been born on board the Silver Eagle in Port Jack-
son, in 1802. The old man, who said he remem-
bered William Cox going to make the first road over
the Blue Mountains, asserted that his father was
Acting-Governor of N. S. Wales for six days. Un-
fortunately for Mr. Hamilton’s memory, the only
military doing duty in N. S. Wales from its founda-
tion till 1810 was the Rum Corps, and there was no
Colonel Hamilton or any officer of that name in the
Corps. Also, the records from the foundation of the
colony up to 1810 don’t mention any such ship as
the Silver Eagle having arrived in Port Jackson.
THE LOVERS.
Few men know more about commerce
statistics than Sir Alfred Bateman, a mem-
ber of the Imperial Royal Commission
lately gazing with astonishment at Maori-
land’s mountain of debt. For 50 years he
has been engaged in making them up as
ammunition for the big political guns of
England, and has done his best, from behind
the scenes, to make the reputation of 20
Presidents of the Board of Trade, including
Lloyd George. He tells a good story about
John Bright, a former President of the
Board. Bateman’s predecessor, as head of
the commercial dept., was requested to pre-
pare a report on a commercial treaty about
which there .was considerable difference of
opinion. Bright, who was not one of the
most studious occupants of the president’s
chair, read the report and attached this
memo.: “After reading Mr. ’s most ex-
cellent and well-reasoned minute twice, I
cannot make out whether he is in favor of
or against the proposed treaty; but his
arguments on both sides are so cogent that
in either case I concur.”
Harry Hawker (son of squatter George
Hawker, Speaker of Adelaide Assembly
from 1860 to 1565) who was killed while
‘hunting” in Hampshire (Eng.) about
Christmas time, left a tidy little £120,000
behind him in S. Aus. His father had a big
area of pastoral land, which was equally
divided among a large family. Old George
Hawker has the distinction of being about
the only legislator in S.A. whose vote was
ever influenced by a Parliamentary speech.
The late Tom Price, afterwards Premier,
pleaded fervently for the first Factories Bill,
and, to the surprise of everyone, George
Hawker, supposed to be a Conservative,
crossed the floor and voted for it. He said
afterwards that he could not have slept
peacefully that night had he opposed it after
hearing Price’s eloquent appeal. Rich
squatter as he was, Hawker also gave the
vote which enabled Kingston to carry his
progressive land-tax resolutions through the
Assembly, and he repeated the vote subse-
quently on the Bill, despite the frantic ex-
postulations of his brother squatters.

James Holland, M.A., for

tired. Joining the service
40 years ago, he knew all
about the hovels in which
learning was instilled into
the young Australian of the
’so’s and ’6o’s. His influ-
ence had some effect iu in-
augurating the re-building
of schools policy, which was
really begun in 1878. N<>w
he sees where mistakes were
made. “Most of the archi-
tects,” he said the other dav.
“were trained in Great
Britain. They were used
to the gloom of the English
climate. When they came
to Australia the first thing
that struck them was the glare. so they built
the new schools to keep out the light.” And
they succeeded, with dreadful results to the
ventilation also.

Dr. Norris, who went from the Victorian
Health Department to take charge of the
Quarantine business on behalf of the Com-
monwealth, moves on now to London to see
that only physically fit immigrants set sail
for Australia. The old billet was worth
£lOOO a year, and the new one is worth only
£800; but Norris was an unexpected appli-
cant, reckoning that he would gain more
than £2OO worth of experience per annum.
F. M. B. Fisher, Maoriland’s Minister of
Customs, is due at Melbourne shortly to talk
reciprocity at the conference between repre-
sentatives of Australia, Canada and, of
course, M.L. He is the young man of the
Ministry, and has found little difficulty in
capturing the limelight from a dull platform
team. And he can stand it, even if it sets
fire to the premises. He is a strong Cold
lea-party man, as was his mentor, the late
tommy Taylor; also, he is a front-rank
tennis player. Sydney Daily Telegraph,
referring to him the other morning, said he
was “one of the handsomest men in M.L.’s
House of Representatives.” That may be
so too; but it was hardly worth mentioning.
Tom Jones Chia, the thoughtless little
Chinaman who sits committed for trial in
Melbourne on a charge of shooting at his
Consul, evidently lost his little head. There
are, so far, only two witnesses for the pro-
secution the Consul and the John who took
Chia into custody. Both of them swear
that the prisoner, after his arrest, stated in
English that he had meant to kill the Con-
sul and do likewise to himself. Evidently
the little chap’s tongue ran away with him.
However, it is _ still open to the defence to
nigue that Ghia was naturally telling the
untruth when he boasted of what a devil of
a murderer and suicide he had meant to be.
Died at Granville (N.S.W.), Henry C
Antill, second son of the late H. C. Antill,

father, who was in the 73rd Regiment, came
out with Macquarie in 1809, and was at-
tached to that Governor’s staff during his
ong rmgn in the colony. When Macquarie
left in 1812, Major Antill settled on his
grant at a spot which he named Picton,
atter the most famous General with whom
he had served ; and he named his own home-
stead Jarvisfield, after the old home of
Governor Macquarie in the Isle of Mull
Jarvisfield is still in the Antill family.

the inkpot, Poole, who always wanted to be at the
preaching, took a South Melbourne church, and
next moved to Queensland, where he found his
position in the South Brisbane church. He staved
there 30 years—as long as he could stand up. A
determined teetotaller, he combined it with a vast
amount of smoking. At the Age office he alwavs
seemed to have a new clay pipe in his mouth. The
habit saved his life at the wreck of the Lveemoon,
by the way; for he happened to have gone up on
deck for a smoke just before the vessel struck and
sank.

The latest N.S.W. Law List shows that

The most ancient members of the Bar are
not working—Henry Carey Dangar ad-
mitted in 1854, and William Alexander
Long, admitted in 1862. The father of the
Bar, leaving out Messrs. Dangar and Long
is C. E. Pilcher, called in 1867. He does
not look for briefs now, either. The oldest
solicitor is A. C. Quaife, of Stanraore, who
was admitted in -April, 1862. His runner-
up is A. W. Castle, of Taree, admitted in
October, ’62. Then follow Henry Deane
(1863) and J. F. Fitzhardinge and Fred

Making his first speech in N. S. Wales,

ably doesn’t know that a namesake of his,
Sir Edward Strickland, a retired Army
officer, was behind W. B. Dailey in the
matter of sending that contingent. Strick-

and this old soldier it was who grasped
that opportunity to light and feed the

“Senior Stripe” identifies the accused:—
Tommy O’Callaghan makes room for A. G. Sains-
bury as Victorian Commissioner of Police on April
1. The two most curious things about O’Callaghan
are his State uniform, which he designed himself,
and his close and serviceable friendship with Jack
Murray, the Chief Sec. O Callaghan recently con-
fided to a Melbourne paper that he was of German
extraction. Presumably he adopts Blucher as h:s
ideal. Blucher seems to suggest boots, and bools
suggest police. On the other hand, John Milne, the
inspecting superintendent, who steps into Sams
bury’s shoes, models himself, confessedly, on Napol-
eon, although facially he more closely resembles
Lord Charles Beresford. To call him “Nap” is the
sincerest form of flattery. It is only a fiction that
policemen are mainly irishmen. O’Callaghan is a
German whose name is probably a low-Dutch cor-
ruption of Ilohenzollern; Milne is an Englishman;
at least two of the Victorian force are Jews; am
Fitzroy rejoices in a constable with the fine old
Irish name of Mafferzoni. If his Christian prefix
were Spiridio, he could open da oyst without ex-
citing suspicion.

Six months ago the directors announced that they
thought they were “justified in complying with the
repeated requests to increase the dividend to the rate
7 p.c. p.a.” Seeing that the visible reserves had
actually shrunk in the preceding" five years, although
a dividend of only 6 p.c. had been paid, there was
no apparent justification for the increase; and
already the reserves have to be bitten into to pay
the 7 p.c. Still, it is so easy for a shipping co. to
stuff away undisclosed profits that one is never safe
in declaring that profits were less than the dividend.
Here, for example, are some tell-tale figures re-
lating to this Newcastle Co.:—
June, Dec., . June, Dec.,
1909. 1911,. 1912. 1912.
Ship property .. £85,350 £62,401 £58,875 £56,551
Freeholds, etc. .. 3,036 1;684 1,484 1,700
Plant, etc. .. 5,446 4,407 3,462 3,414
Liquid assets .. 24,624 56,688 61,260 69,491
Note how the book-value of the ship-property has
shrivelled, while the liquid assets (bank deposits
mostly) have grown like Jonah’s pumpkin. Cer-
tainly the co. may have sold ships for cash, or col-
lected the insurance money on vessels that have been
lost, but the chances are that the bulk of the re-
duction in the ship-property item is due to writing-
down—in other words, profit (or, more strictly,
revenue) has been put aside ostensibly to provide for
renewals. Obviously, the visible profits can be made
to look great or small as the unspecified amount
dropped into that renewal fund is little or big.
On the record of the co. this paper is inclined to
think that the provision for < repairs and renewals
and replacements is very ample, and that, probably
for prudential reasons, the management under- rather
than over-states the true profit. Latterly the co. has
been having more wharf-side troubles, and its ex-
penses have gone up, while apparently trade hasn’t
increased. And as those expenses are likely to keep
up, even when trade slackens, the wisdom of the in-
creased dividend still looks doubtful, even allowing
that the co.’s position is better than it is made to
look on the official paper.

Considering that “tin.? season has been the worst
experienced for many years” (vide directors’ re-
port), the profit shown is extraordinarily good. But
in a, business of this sort you can’t go much on one
year s figures. The usual practice is to take in
stock at a very low valuation, and, when beasts are
sold, to show the net surplus realised above that
valuation as profit. Also, of course, the net revenue
!T om , the , wool-clip is profit. Last year, though
7 !!,, p were shorn » the lambs marked totalled
only 4835. On the other hand, in view of the bad
season and the high prices ruling most of the time
for stock, sales were fairly large. Further, the
wool market has been very good. These things ac-
count for the satisfactory profit shown. Future
figures will, however, be affected by the poor lamb-
ing—you can t shear a sheep that has declined to
be born or to live after it has been born. And even
for the past year the profits wouldn’t have shown
up anything like so well if an average amount had
been written off improvements. This is the record
in that matter for some years past:—

The co. was formed to buy Bundaleer and Thurul-
goona, over the Queensland border, in the Far West.
It paid far too much for them, and it had many
dull years in which to whip the cat; but it has
succeeded in getting its once-big debt down to prac-
tically nothing. In 1899, after a few good years, it
was struck by a bad drought, and showed a net
loss of £36,092. At that time it had a mortgage
of £60,000 and other liabilities amounting to
£3902. Altogether it owed on December 31 last
only £lOO7, and it had about £25,000’0f liquid
assets, in addition to stock (£55,582). The change
in the position is excellent; but it has only been
brought about by skimping dividends. Moreover,
there is liable to be an end to the earning capacity
of some of the capital. “No provision has been
made for the wastage of the leases, which now have
22 years to run for an area of about 1050 square
miles. Station and improvements (not counting in
stock) represent £216,812 of the total capital of
£292,005. Probably at the end of the 22 years
the co. will still find most of the area available;
but there’s a risk about it. Meantime the selector
is liable to drop in, and though he pays for improve-
ments he doesn’t usually pay anything like the cost
price. However, much profit can be made at th’s
business in 22 years, given favorable conditions. The
trouble in this case is the excessive capitalisation,
the result, of course, of the over-valuation of the
back countrv when the co. was formed (1882). A
similar holding now would be considered dear at half
or even one-third the money. The co. is in 97,335
shares of £3 10s. paid to £3, and valued in the
market at about 265. There are nearly enough liquid
assets and stock (at valuation) to represent that
amount.

This bank has kept on a fairly even keel so far as
profits are concerned since its last issue of shares in
1907. The average well-conducted bank has a strong
objection to showing erratic profits. Such results
suggest that the concern is carrying on a more or
less speculative business; and the public naturally
doesn’t feel happy in leaving its deposits with a bank
that speculates. The basis of the modern banking
business is credit. It wants to be trusted. It, there-
fore, never wants to even hint that it has made a
heavy loss—a thing which would, of course, suggest
the possibility of further heavy losses. Hence the
practice of accumulating what are called internal
reserves. A bank can have those reserves in all sorts
of ways. For instance, supposing it made £lO,OOO
more than it had been showing recently, and sup-
posing it had £lOO,OOO worth of Government stock,
it could regard that £lOO,OOO as worth only
£90,000. By doing that it would wipe out that
extra £lO,OOO of profit. But the juggle wouldn’t
affect the market value of the Government stock a
cent. Presently the bank might have to meet some
heavy losses. If it chose it could then sell the
Government stock and get the full £lOO,OOO for it;
in other words, it would make a profit of £lO,OOO,
which profit could be set against the losses; and so
the losses would never be disclosed any more than
the abnormal profit was. It is a system of equalis-
ing disclosed profits—a system practically forced on
banks because people are inclined to take alarm if
a bank which showed a profit of £50,000 this year
showed one of only £30,000 next year, as it might
very easily do without having sustained any really
serious trouble.
In theory a bank should never make losses. It
is supposed to always have securities to cover its
advances, etc. But in practice things work out
differently, and one never knows when its contin-
gency fund may be called for. Some years ago this
Commercial Bank of Tasmania, wanting to make
its reserve fund extra safe, decided to go into
what was regarded in Right Thinking circles as
absolutely the most gilt-edged security in the Em-
P ire -British Consols. For various reasons those
Consols have, however, shrunk in value, and paper
worth £lOO face value is now saleable at only £73
7s. 6d. Now, if a Government undertook to pay par
for its paper at some time or other, a co. might
possibly be justified in keeping the stock in its
balance-sheet at par. But Consols are perpetual:
that is, the Com. of Tasmania is not entitled to at
“yf l ™ 5? *0 the British Treasury and demand
£lOO for the £lOO bond. All it can do is to go
into the market and sell. For that reason the
market price is the only figure at which a bank is
entitled to keep such securities in its balance-sheet.
I his has meant that, as Consols have shrunk, the
value has had to be written down out of profits.
Jjie following shows what has happened of late
(the face value of this bank’s holding is £160,000):

Ihe £BOOO struck off profits this half-year brings
the stock down to £72 p.c. of its face value; and
as the present price is £73 7s. 6d., provision has
been made for some possible future shrinkage.
Meantime, though the stock is worth less in the
market than it used to be, it produces as much in-
terest as ever it did ; so that, so long as the bank
doesn t want to sell the stock, it is just as well off
as ever it was; and the profit which has been used
to write down the book-value of the stock is also
earning money in some other direction. In this
way the bank has been strengthening its position
and its dividend prospects.

A pretty rapid growth of advances is disclosed
there —and the chances are that it is not very cheap
money that is going out now. When the principal
State of the Commonwealth is desperately paying
the equivalent of about £4 7s. p.c. p.a. on a 10-year
loan, the public can’t expect cheap money. Booms
are fine things while we’re drinking the champagne-
but there is more than one sting in their tail; and
when the bank s customer has to pay an extra 1 or
2 p.c. for accommodation, he will know who to
thank for it. More than all others, James McGowen

This bank now holds only 32 p.c. of the public’s
money (deposits, etc.) in liquid form; and it won’t
be safe to make advances and thus reduce it much
below that point. In fact, even 32 p.c. is generally
reckoned a bit over the safety line.

The co. has had a record half-year, so the directors
invite shareholders to come along and have a “jubi-
lee bonus, this being the tenth vear of the co’s
operations.” The Bulletin hasn’t heard that the
shareholders scorned the invitation. There is this
to be said for the directors: they are under no de-
lusions with regard to the maintenance of these
boom profits. They know that the State’s wild bor-
rowing must, and will, end presently; very likely
they know that if it doesn’t end before it will end
simultaneously with a bad season and a slump in
production. When that transpires, things threaten
to be extremely bad, because of the excessive in-
terest which the people will have to pay on the
recently-borrowed money. There is thus every
likelihood of a very bad time ahead in the construc-
tion trades; and this co. is going to suffer worse
than most from that trouble when it arrives. There
will be a gradual revival afterwards, of course ; but
normal conditions, when they return, won’t, so far
as this co. is concerned, be anything like the boom
conditions that have prevailed lately. The man
who thinks of buying these shares on the strength
of the £7OBB profit made in the past six months
had better, therefore, cool his head with the icy fact
that in the corresponding half of 1905, after the
bad times of 1903-4, profits sank to £612 and the
dividend to nil. Admittedly the financial position
has been very much improved since then. Here are
some figures:—
Dec., 1905. Dec., 1912.
Liquid assets .. ..£2986 £17,221
Liabilities 7814 1,710
Deficit .. .. £4828
Surplus .. .. £15,511
That means that the co. is anything from £BOO to
£lOOO a year better off now than it was then—
provided that the £11,004 now represented by book
debts, and included with liquid assets, is good
money. On the other hand, over £lO,OOO of the ac-
cumulated profit has been transferred to capital, and
some new shares have been issued, so that it takes
a trifle more to pay a 5 or 10 p.c. div. than it used to.
The transfers of reserves really amount to the restora-
tion of capital, because previously when the State
got into the backwash of one of its periodic booms,
ss. in the £ of the capital had to be written off
as having dropped through a hole somewhere and dis-
appeared. This alone gives a hint as to the char-
acter of the co.’s business.

Bananaland is taking a long while to find out the
benefits of co-operation. This is the co.’s 34th
birthday, and yet it isn’t the flourishing concern
it should be —not by miles. The capital is very
small —only £5OlB. Possibly if the co. got in a
little additional money it could open out more
stock and make a more attractive showing. Also,
it might be able to escape from its overdraft —not
a large one (£1257 net), but still too much for a
concern which ought to be doing nothing but cash
trading. Unfortunately, the co.’s customers haven’t
learned the benefits of cash trading yet. Of
£22,942 of sales last half-year, £17,539 were made
on credit. That, of course, means that the co. can’t
buy for cash either, and thus the customers and
shareholders rob themselves of the benefit of trade
discounts.

The copper boom is mainly responsible for the long
jump in profits and dividends. Standard metal
averaged £73 Is. 3d. last year, compared with
£56 Is. 9d. in 1911. That is to say, the improve-
ment was £l7 per ton—or so near to £l7 that
the difference doesn’t matter. The fine copper in
ore and tailings was 6251 tons, and £l7 per ton on
6251 tons amounts to £106,267. If, therefore, the
co. had merely made the profit resulting from the
advance in the metal, there should have been
£106,267 to divide. And as it didn’t'* make
£106,267, it follows that the cost of production
last year was greater than the average market price
was in 1911. On the co.’s own showing this is how
costs have worked out: —
1907 .. £73 17 9 I 1910 .. £54 11 2
1908 .. 54 16 8 1911 .. 51 12 5
1909 . . 53 3' 11 I 1912 . . 56 18 9
That, of course, is per ton of copper.
Two points of importance have, therefore, to be
considered: (1) What is the price of copper likely
to be in the future? (2) What are the prospects
for a reduction in the cost rate? As to the price,
copper is a most erratic commodity; but in the
past 10 years it has never been down below
£52 15s. The average of the lowest points touched
each year for the past 10 years is £5B 11s. It
seems to be a very safe thing to assume that the
average price for the next 10 years won’t be lower
than the average of the lowest points touched in the
past 10 years, the tendency of prices in general
being upward. To figure on £6O seems safe.
To figure on £65 seems not very risky
Nothing even so definite as that can be
said on the subject of costs. In metallurgy the
greatest advances are being made in the utilisation
of what were formerly waste products. For a
good many years past this co. has been reaping a
crop of copper from the old tailings dumps by the.
cementation process. The co. doesn’t now mention
the cost of recovering metal by this very cheap
method; but in 1909 the costs, including smelting
charges and heavy depreciation on plant, amounted
to a few pence over £45 per ton. And it had
been lower than . that. The slimes are now being
attacked. But suitable stored by-pToducts, the accu-
mulation of 52 years or so, will not last much
longer, for the Wallaroo residues are not adapted to
the cementation process. Excellent results are how-
ever, said to have been got of late from the flotation
(Minerals Separation) process. The directors don’t
whoop about the matter, but general-manager Han-
cock says: “During the latter half of the year a
little over 200 tons of copper was obtained from
the mundic and tailings dumps, and the residues
from the plant represented about 0.3 p.c. copper ”
The plant is being extended, and there is very
little doubt that a lot of reliance is to be put on
this process in the future. This doesn’t apply to
tailings only, but to slimes and crude ore as well
An entire re-organisation of processes seems indeed
likely in the future. And there is room for it
Apart from the very heavy loss of metal by the old
concentrating process (at Moonta almost exactly
25 p.c. of the metal was non-recovered last year),
the costs are very severe, especially i

The Melbourne-owned Bourke’s Hill, Em-
maville (N.S.W.), has paid another 6d div
a further tribute to the policy of reorganisation
entered upon some months ago. Prior to that the
show was a very lame duck, partly owing to in-
sufficient water. A more certain supply has been
got from the Severn River. The plant also had to
be thoroughly overhauled and removed. Moreover
some ground which the co. was sluicing on a
royalty basis was advantageously' bought outright
These alterations necessitated a couple of calls, but
the_ shareholders should now have ahead of them a
period of fair profits.
B. H. Junction North is the fantod*of the
sharemarket. Two years ago (April, 1911) lead was
£l3 and shares 16s. In December, 1911, lead had
risen to £l5 11s. 3d. and shares to 255. This
spurt was helped by the improper ls. dividend (De-
cember 21, 1911). For 1912 lead averaged £l7
15s. 104 d., and yet the Junction North had to re-
construct and make calls. Shares next took a neck-
brealong drop below Bs. ; but lead boomed to £23
and they came up again to 255., with no very defi-
nite prospect of a dividend. Since then there ha«
been a slump to 10s. The mill is asserted to have
achieved a metallurgical success in the treatment of
slimes, but the extraction from all products milled
is under 8 p.c. lead and soz. silver, and costs are
heavy. The return for February (four weeks) was
2279 tons of concentrates (340z.' silver, 56 p.c. lead,
14 p.c. zinc), so gross metal contents figure 1276
tons lead and 77,4800 z. silver. Two grades of con-
centrates are, however, made, and it is the price that
can be got for the goods that counts. The latest
hint is that the fine slimy concentrates are finding a
market; and if that is so, and lead keeps up, the
market may recover a bit. For a nerson who wants
to enjoy peace of mind, Junction North scrip is, in
spite of that prospect, a poor counter to gamble
with.

P. G. Morgan, Government Geologist, has
driven several spikes of hard, cold fact into the
comfortable belief held by Maorilanders that the
shaky Isles contain such unlimited supplies of coal,
iron and oil that they arc destined to become the
great manufacturing centre of the Pacific. This has
been one of the baits held out to Cohen when fresh
loans were required. It has been harped on per-
sistently by the press and politicians of the type of
the one who, when giving evidence before the Em-
-111 . Trade Commission, referred to the countless
millions of tons of coal yet to be discovered. He
was asked, “Are you a geologist?” “No,” was the
reply; ‘but lam a man of common-sense and have
been about a bit.” According to Morgan, however,
after allowing for waste, etc., there is only sufficient
coal for 100 years, even at the present rate of con-
sumption and increase of population. As to iron,
there are 22 million tons of ore. Taranaki iron-sand
contains titanium, and is difficult to smelt; besides,
] t is scattered along miles of coast-line. Regarding
oil, it is surprising to learn that a refinery, with a
1 y ca P acl ty. of 10,000 gallons, is being erected,
though the daily production of the wells is so far
only 689 gallons. A Job’s comforter is Morgan in
these straitened times.

“actual” of 5.73dwt. value and 78,385 tons “prob-
able,” averaging s.3odwt. The tonnage shows little
alteration compared with the previous vear’s figures,
but the grade is down a trifle. The Board remarks
that while nothing of importance has been found
iatelv it is comforting to note that the reserves have
not shrunk to any extent. Since the beginning of this
month a cable has come to hand announcing that the
absorption of the Hainault has been sanctioned by
shareholders of both cos. The abolition of duai con-
trol will, it is estimated, reduce administration costs
by at least £5500 per annum and will cut down
expenses in other directions.

Last year Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) treated
155,603 tons for £248,083. Local expenditure
amounted to £185,000 or thereabouts, and on top of
this has to be reckoned depreciation, London office
exes., and other charges at present unknown. The
dividend distributions for the year aggregated
£69,062 or a few thousands more than the gross
working profit, and a good many thousands more than
the actual net surplus is likely to total. The main
shaft has been deepened to 2652 ft. on the underlay,
and the big winding engine referred to in back num-
bers of this paper is nearing completion.

The cheeky Gwalia Central (W.A.) has
lately been puffing its prospects, and inferentiallv
leading London to believe that it had something
in common with the Sons of Gwalia and most of the
remaining riches on the Leonora field. Inquiries
since made by the Agent-General and others from
the Mines Department have revealed (1) that the
co.’s belongings comprise two more or less worn-out
leases known as the Trump and Trump Extended,
situated on the other side of Leonora township, and
about two miles away; and (2) that nothing is
known locally of the rich finds that are being
placed to the property’s credit in London. About
18,000 oz. have been taken out of the Trumps during
the last 12 or 14 years, but only 2090 z. represents
last year’s output. They are not, in their present
state of decrepitude, the class of venture that a
sensible co. would care to bother about.

“Bar None” : Have seen Bullfinch’s official
plans. They show a fair-sized patch of sweetening
ore in the old boom workings ; also a larger tonnage
of milling-grade reserves. Values are, however, mis
erably poor at No. 3 level in and around the locality
where a continuation of the rich stuff was looked
for; but, of course, the unexpected may happen and
another enrichment be met with in deeper ground.
The Northern series is a mine in itself. At the No.
1 level official plans and assays show the shoot to
have a length of 450 ft. and an average for 21ft. of
about 13dwt. stuff for 400 ft., and a look underground
at that point proves beyond doubt that the ore is
there. Judging by the development already done,
length, width and values will continue to 200 ft. At
300 ft. the first 60-odd feet of driving has averaged
655. 6d., but it is a moot point whether the lode
• that is being opened up at this depth is the main
make or a branch. Mill supplies are at present being
drawn from five different sources, and unless the co.
has made a bloomer in its assay values a return of
£3 per ton on present reserves should easily be
maintained for two years or more. The plant is an
eve-opener as regards efficiency and economy, and re-
flects credit on its designers and builders.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) is more rick-
eftv than ever. Profits are becoming harder and
iiar.ler to get, and, judging by underground appear-
ances, a resumption of dividends is very unsure.
What seems to puzzle supporters of the stock most
of all i< that, although work was to have been com-
menced two months ago on the rich make cut just
inside the boundary at 2480 ft. by a crosscut from the
Boulder workings, nothing has been heard about it
since, and the market has weakened to 355. The
Bulletin said at the time that this enrichment was
part of one first met with in the Boulder at 1900 ft.,
and followed down in that property almost to the
point where it passed into the Horseshoe. It is rich
and wide in the Boulder, but has a length of only
from 30ft. to 40ft. Then values dwindle consider-
ably. No doubt they have done so also in the Horse-
shoe. Hence the official silence.

The following is believed to be a true
and faithful statement of Edna May’s position. Cr.:
20,000 tons of actual and probable ore in sight at
(say) £4 per ton = £BO,OOO. Dr.: Mining, milling
and extraction. £20,000; plant equipment and sun-
dries, £12,500 ; total, £82,500. Estimated sur-
plus, £47,500; or, approximately, £1 per share.
Then there is speculative value to be taken into ac-
count ; but the sick condition of the neighboring
Greenfinch is considered to discount this considerably.
The co. is,, however, putting down a new shaft to
prove the reef at 150 ft., and this work should throw
a good deal of light on the matter.
Meekatharra (W.A.) produced a 14dwt.
average (44,5040 z.) in 1912, and, bar accidents,
it will do better fit ill this year. As in previous
vears its chief means of support in 1912 were
Fenian, Ingliston Consols, and Ingliston Extended.
The first-named has now yielded between 80,000 oz.
and 90,0000 z. and paid >161.165 in divs. The
other two have also turned out a lot of gold, but
only the Ingliston Consols has given shareholders
anything, all the profits earned by the Extended
being put back into the mine or laid out in equip-
ment. The adjacent Queen of the Hills, with its
estimated £lOO,OOO profit in sight, has its first
clean-up this month. The co. is very sanguine,
but there are unkind persons who say that the gold
in the mine is less than the coin expended in
making preparations to take it out.
Greenfinch, at Westons (W.A.), is having
a drowning-man sort of struggle. Prospects have
been anything but rosy for some time, and, judging
by the bottom, the end isn’t far off. As a last
resource some boring may be done in the eastern
end to prosuect the ground in the direction of
Duff’s and the Edna May leases.
Ida H. (W.A.) asserts that the rich shoot
is continuing at 1070 ft. and trending towards the pro-
posed extension of the incline shaft. This is de-
clared to be a most encouraging feature. The shoot
has, it adds, now been proved to go 101 ft. and to
average 3oz. Bdwt. for a width of 19 inches. The in-
formation is also imparted that as this is the longest
shoot of this grade known in t’’o history of the mine
the Board has decided to sink the incline shaft a
further 100 ft. in order to “assist rapid develop-
ment, ensure good ventilation, and enable the ore to
he more economically extracted.” Good ; but past
experience hasn’t had a habit of confirming esti-
mates made about this show; so caution is advis-
able.

Shaft Sinkers, Ltd., of Victoria, is out
tor more cash. This co. started out with £5OOO
to demonstrate at the Great Poseidon lease, Tarna-
gulla, that it could successfully use the freezing
method for drifty ground on deep leads. So far
trouble has hung to the Shaft Sinkers, Ltd., which
couldn’t pick up the stuff in- Australia it wanted
quickly to freeze the ground. Time hasn’t, how-
ever, been altogether wasted. The co. has hitched
on to its venture seven miles of the Madame Hop- ,
kins lead, three miles of the Working Miners-
lead, and eight miles of the Ascot lead,
thus freezing up a vast block of mining
land. Shaft Sinkers not only does this, but produces
facts about the Working Miners and other leads
which invite one Alfred A. Billson, Minister of
Mines, to inquire why such areas shouldn’t be
manned. The reply may be that the Shaft Sinkers
proposes to pop its little lot of assets in London
for £lOO,OOO in cash and £lOO,OOO in shares.
But whether Bull will come up to the scratch de-
pends on whether he has forgotten the money he
dropped under Bewick, Moreing and Co. at Moo-
lort, Rutherglen and Ararat. Meanwhile, the tale
is told that J. Bull has suggested to Shaft Sinkers
to form a co. of a million, with a fifth interest to
Shaft Sinkers. To evolve £200,000 out of £20,000
in this way would be a snap that would appeal to
Jack Baillieu, now that he has screwed up the Cocks
Pioneer coffin.
“Jimmy” Mackay bad better keep a close
eye on Poseidon Alluvial. It isn’t in accordance
with sober Scotch ways for a stock to be up at
18s. and down 25 p.c. two days later. There seems
to be the suspicion that a leakage exists some-
where. If that is not so, then Poseidon Alluvial is
a stock to beware of. The novice in deep-lead
work doesn’t know that the clean-up in the sluice
boxes is made daily, but it is a fact that ought never
to be lost sight of when a man is trying to measure
up the strength of the market.

Woah Hawp Canton, Ballarat, is moving
more spryly at 1200 ft. than of old. There driving
is being hustled up in the black slates to the south,
as with the Prince Regent and Dalzell leases to
draw upon the co. has plenty of scope for pro-
gressive work in that direction. West, beyond the
big slide, there is also the chance that payable
quartz may be got; while at 850 ft. the western
indicator is to be picked up with the object of
finding Tinworth’s shoot of gold to the south. A
hit here would galvanise a section of Ballarat that
is as inert as the Labor party over Protection.

Those who gave up Confidence Extended,
Bendigo, as dead, rubbed their glasses when they
saw a block of shares swallowed by a cute Beehive
broker, who is credited with a liking only for safe-
snaps. His present preference has reason in it.
First of all there is the chance of butting into good’
stone at 2500 ft., such as has put Windmill Hill in
such good heart. Next is the hope of picking up-
some good dirt adjacent to the Oollman fault, both
at depth and in the upper levels. Surveyor Cundy
is to help in unravelling these problems, and Bendigo,
likes Cundy.
When Burnt Creek, Maryborough (Vic.),
started to pay dividends three months ago, The:
Bulletin wasn’t very cheerful —-it doubted their-
continuance. Now the news goes round that the-
show may close down. Reasons given are high:
cost and low efficiency of the labor available. T'oi
these may be added a third and greater. Burn*
Creek never did more than flatter its followers-
Working first on the Bet Bet lead, it only won®
out its pumps. When it got on the Duke lead Sth
found floods of water, some puggv wash and am-
uneven bottom to the gutter. Conditions like tFwse
stick up the best mine unless the gold is plentiful!,
and Burnt Creek never could set up as a record-
breaker in that respect.

Ajax Central, Daylesford (Vic.), on a
capital of £12,000, has already parted up £6ooo'
in divs. and is still going. The Murrav-Rain
crowd is believed to be in possession—which means:
that no idea is given, any more than in the Ajax
or the Nuggettv, of the extent of the mine reserves:
and their value. The mine has developed better
than the touts expected. Work to the west at
541 ft. is just now the programme, and if the
shoot lives there and opens up to the average of
the stone broken at No. 5. a few more will cer-
tainly Z added 6 to the list of divs., for at No. 5
there has been 110 ft. of stone Bft. wide north of
the shaft, all real stingo. Overhead the reef has
been proved to split, but about an equal quantity
of work down south of the shaft has helped up
reserves. Still, even if there had been no pinching
of the reef at this point, and even when other shoots
are throw into the scale, a very liberal valuation
has been given to the mine by those who back it in
the market at its present price.
* * * *
Apropos the Minnie Moxham (N.Q. l,
complaint was made (B. 27/2/’l3) that, though
the mine was worth the promised new trial, the
promoters and vendors were opening their mouths
too wide. C. A, Jenkinson, the secretary, now
assures The Bulletin that the £3OOO cash which
the syndicate is taking “is being put back by the
vendors into the co.” That’s better.
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, notices
an improvement in No. 5 level. Recent crushings
have averaged below £5 per ton, which comparts
poorly with last year’s 3899 tons for £24,902. The
tonnage put through is, however, too limited to give
any sound opinion of the value of the mine. Three
important points to watch are the extension of No. 5
level, deeper development to No. 6, and lateral
driving off No. 4 east level in search of the hang-
ing-wall section of the reef below the old workings. The
deepest winze from the latter was showing a good
make of stone when work was suspended; in fact,
this prospect caused the directors to drive No. 4.
Whether the Day Dawn lives below 2600 ft. cannot
be told : but the Brilliant Block is sinking on a for-
mation below 2000 ft. vertical, and that formation
is supposed to be the Day Dawn.
One of the old water-jacket smelters has
been removed from Mt. Garnet to the Mammoth
copper mine at Klondvke (Q.). If Garnet were
not a freehold, the chances are that a diamond
drill would be put through the bed of zinc
that cut the copper out. It seems a pity that a
mine that gave such rich returns from the surface
should be allowed to go without another trial—by
boring, anyway.
The directors of Mount Molloy (Q.) have
notified shareholders of the failure of the re-con-
struction scheme. It was the Balkan war and the
Labor party that did it, it seems. Rotten
management in the past had nothing to do with
making a re-construction necessary, of course. It
never has.

The hand of Herman is in the new flutter
over the Mt. Balfour Copper Mines (Tas.). At first
it would seem as if the £3OOO spent in sending
Hector Macdonald and Langford to London had gone ;
hut this is not true, because Macdonald’s Tasmanian
Railway and General Trust kept things going to the
end of last year before it threw up the snonge. That
■crowd’s complaint all through was that Australia
didn’t back up Bull. If they knew what the average
Australian bull thought of the Balfour copper field,
they would not have wondered at it. Anyway, the
Trust still holds that the agricultural and forest
land along the line will bring in revenue to the co.’s
railway : so it has reserved the right to take uo half
the shares in the New Mt. Balfour should Herman’s
Australasian Guarantee Corporation, Ltd., decide to
father the float. To date Mt. Balfour has had spent
on it £38,309, including railway, £16,512;
■mining, £6482 ; surveys, £3218. Then £3300
has been lodged with the State authorities, and pre-
sumably the other £9OOO has gone in “missionary”
■expenses. The Australasian Guarantee Corporation’s
■obligations to the Mt. Balfour, should it form a co.,
Is to put up £200,000 for general purposes, to give
the Balfour folk £160,000 in shares (or half de-
bentures) in the new co., and to pay £2500 cash,
presumably as refund of a deposit to the Government.
A trifle of £9OOO is required to complete the first
section of the co.’s line (11 miles). It looks as
though it will cost £lOO.OOO for 40 miles. Then
there must be power works if electricity is to be
used, so that a big hole will be made in the
£200,000 if all Mertz’s ideas are carried out.
As The Bulletin expected, there is
mothing in the rumor that General-Manager Bell-
(enger, of Great Cobar, won’t return to Australia.
A cable comes saving that he will be back in Aus-
tralia next month, and will start at the mine again
in June, or thereabouts. Meanwhile, acting G.-M.
Danvers Ppyver is holding his end up very well.
But he is having his troubles, partly the results of
patched-up plant which is constantly going wrong
and holding up the output.
The demand for tin shows a regular increase, and
prices are likely to remain at a figure that will pay
any sound proposition first-rate returns. Tin mining
is a big industry at Stanthorpe (Q.), and a Brisbane-
Ipswich-Stanthorpe syndicate has secured the option
over a property that competent geologists report
very highly on. It is situated nine miles from Bal-
landean, on the Brisbane-Sydney line, and 14 miles
south of Stanthorpe. The mineral leases form one
block of 65 acres, and a prospectus has been issued
on behalf of the Bee Hive Tin Mining Co., Ltd.,
with a nominal share capital of £65,000, divided
into 65,000 shares of £1 each, of which 43,000
shares are available for application. Of these 7000
have been already arranged for, so that 36,000 are
now offered for subscription on the following terms.
2s. 6d. per share on application and 2s. 6d. per
share on allotment, with calls not to exceed 3d. per
share per month. Development work has been going
on steadily for some time. Mr. E. A. Derrick first
reported on the property. Then Mr. W. H. Rands,
A R S M., F.G.S., examined the find, and subsequently
Mr E. O Marks, 8.A., 8.E., Assistant Government
Geologist of Queensland, ran the rule over it. Their
reports are very favorable. For instance, Mr. Der-
rick says: “The recoverable black tin for the whole
300 yards of surface dirt round the contact should
be at least l i p.c.” Mr. Brands’s comment on this is;
“! am of opinion that Mr. Derrick’s figures are pro-
bably under the mark both as to quantity and as to
tin contents.” Mr. Marks’s report is even brighter
He took two lines of samples of the surface dirt at
chain intervals, above and below the contact. the
11 samples so obtained practically prove an area of
2) acres and average 0.74 p.c. metallic tin equal
to about 251 b. black tin per cubic yard. Wherever
cuts have been put in on this side the surface soil
has been over 3ft. in depth, so it is a reasonably
safe assumption that the 2) acres contain 12 000
yards of soil, carrying 110 tons metallic tan, worth
£24 000 gross. Mr. Marks says further: As the
soil elsewhere along the contact in the vicinity is
known to carry tin, there is no reason to presume
ithat the area sampled is by any means the total area
that will be found to carry payable tin A similar
area, adjoining the foregoing on the north side, has
since been sampled; it assays 2.57 p.c. metallic tin,
giving a result of £104,000 for the five acres. Sur-
face tin has been found on the south sl ' ]e sO ,
payable quantity, without consideration of the lode
matter at all. AH the geologists who have inspected
these lodes agree ®n the probable existence of true
lodes, apart from the contact lode : 31 tons of the
•contact ore were sent to Messrs. Lohmann and .
for treatment, and gave a return of £56 16s. per
ton gross, with tin at £2lB 10s. on day of samp
ting ” It is believed that the application and allot-
ment money will be sufficient for treating the
alluvial tin, and the returns from this should be
worth far more than the capital that will be re-
quired to be called up. Full prospectus and form of
application may be obtained from the broker Mr.
T PP A Bond, Brisbane, member of the Brisbane
Stock’ Exchange; or from the provisional secretary,
Mr W A Dvmock, Australian Bank of Commerce
Chambers, Tpswich (Q.). The Brisbane Courier of
March 8 contains an abridged prospectus as well.
It should be well worth the while of anvone wishing
to invest in a tin proposition to get full particulars
of this company.*
Hampden-Cloncurry (Q. ) is smelting
nearly equal quantities of ore from its two most
important mines. Last month Hampden supplied
1944 tons and the Duchess 2140 tons. The Salmon
(a limestone show) forwarded 216 tons, and 180
tons were purchased. The most important develop-
ment of late has been the improvement of the copper
values at 92ft. below the 550 ft. level in the
Duchess. A blank was met with in the sinking
of this winze, but it has been followed by a make
of 22 p.c. ore. The strike of pyritic ore at 412 ft.
in Hampden No. 1 shaft is of almost equal im-
portance. The evidence that dense sulphides live
below 400 ft. puts new heart into the enterprise.
The return for last month was 539 tons copper,
189 oz. gold and 50630 z. silver. Taking copper at
£6O, the value of the base metal was £32,340.
If half of that is profit the co. will be doing very
well.

A great mistake, when erecting new works'or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleiohert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*
°h Bishop! Also all the shares I bulled
Uo shriek and rave;
This Turkey-lolly war my leg has pulled

Copper is down, and lead is sick, and I
See but a loss.
Come thou and pat my head and help me try
To bear my Cross.
Hampdens have broken forty bob, and look -
To fall ten more;
Ardlethan booms no more than Joseph Cook,
And silver’s sore;
All flesh is grass and strongest men can trip.
Oh, for the spoil!

With holy oil.
All stocks are nervous—most are broken down!
Come to my aid!

A credit frayed.

With oil and prayer.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, March 24, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
The Stricklands have put off their garden
party this week. The brutal and entirely
useless slaughter of King George of Greece,
who seemed to take an unusually intelligent
interest in his job, is the cause. King George
was the Dowager Alexandra’s brother, so
his tragic death puts a black edge on vice-
regal junketing for a week or two. Nothing
more frivolous than the laying of an occa-
sional foundation-stone is likely to be toler-
ated.
The Easter Show developed no symp-
toms of the dry winter in this State.
Governor Strickland landed a neat
parcel of descriptive matter on the
little patch of Axminster at the offi-
cial opening. “An exhibition unrivalled in
this continent and famous throughout the
world,” said he. Mild applause from the
front row of the crowd, which was almost
asphyxiated by the heat, having steadily
broiled in the sun for an hour or two before
the vice-regal foot trod the pure-merino
sheep-pen in the stand. (While the Show
committee is spending money in excelsis on
various new buildings, etc., it has overlooked
the shabby shed, not half large enough for
present requirements, which is ironically
called a “grandstand.”)
Miss Strickland, a tall girl with corn-
colored hair and eyes of Wedgwood blue, re-
ceived the homage of the agricultural ladies
who were herded with the political petti-
coats.
Fate destines Speaker Willis to be chcek-
by-jowl with Mr. Francis Suttor, President
of the Council. They get neck and neck at
official gatherings, and no one could say who
was an eyelash in front of the other when
Governor Strickland was opening the big
cattle parade. Mrs. Trefffi, the show lady
in the present team of State Cabinet Minis-
ters’ wives, wiped the floor with the personal
appearance of any other political dame pre-
. sent on Wednesday. Old rose, in some soft
shimmering drapery top-dressed with black
hat, did the damage.
A few freaks fluttered about the Rand-
wick lawn on the first day of the Easter
races, _ but they came only as spies rather
than in battalions. Summer heat downed
the desire of the fat to get into grotesque
autumn garb, and the fashionable lean wore
their gossamer garments and mighty little
else, as has been their custom for some
months.
A new female hat may be mentioned with
some fear and trembling, though the boy in
the.street will receive it with shrieks of joy.
It is a small black silk tile, rather low and
flat in its roof. Thus far, it is distinctly of
the male species, and appears to have been
built for the head of an A.D.C. But a Bird-
of-Paradise perched on its narrow brim, a
little to one side, makes it a sexless brand
.of millinery. Worn at the races by a lady with
*a brawny figure and a sunset complexion,
■one of these man-woman hats attracted
frantic attention, till two more of the same
species loomed on the lawn. Each dame who
:got round under one of these autumnal shocks
was blessed with a jaw that naturally placed
Iher above the weak fear of criticism.
The short coat which is cut away in front
;and rounded off into a neat little sparrow-
ltail behind was present in legions. A vivid
Iblue ninon of this cult, worn over a cream
«kirt laid out in broad blue stripes, sounds
{aggressive, but was It, and the girl inside
i-a-a aw r ay from competition.
Stamped velvet of the kind we used to
sma%e into book-markers, in the days of short
muds and giggles, is one of the newest forms
2. f fethato vanity. The tall figure of Mrs.
3. S. Brunton was well groomed in a pow-
(der-blue jacket of this pile, worn over a skirt
in some silky . drapery. Mrs. Lebby Hor-
<dern, in floating white garments fine as
•gossamer silk, out-feathered some of the best-
tdressed plumage on the lawn. Pretty Etta
Norris, who wears periwinkle blue as a regu-
lar habit, had a small fur tail twined round
'her Easter race hat. A deadly varietv of
yellowish-green, defined by untutored Man
:as the color of the worst bilious attack he
-ever encountered, crept into the frocks of
some of the. expensively clad. Mrs. Mick
Dalton, a nice-looking young matron with
"2 n ivory complexion and the willow-wand
figure of a French doll, appeared in one of
these wicked jaundice-green gowns.
The Philip Morton girls have brought
back from Europe lots of the latest style
m quiet, dead-leaf tones, a mile or two
away from the shrieks they affected in early
and precocious flapperhood. Jean Morton
has grown, up into a very chic young
maiden, with a handsome pair of dark
brown velvet eyes. At one race-week orgy
of clothes, she wore the best-cut coat and
skirt exhibited by any young person in her
vicinity. It was built of one of those
new-tinted cloths that look like the sands
of Sahara when the sun sulks behind the
horizon.
The country sent us stacks of hearty, be-
•XTTuf-11 acs f°, r .fhe riot. McKinnons,
McPhillamvs and McMasters are magnifi-
£?« t ™- advertlse “ ents for the stability of
.N.S.W. pastoral pursuits, and the ‘solid
mash acquired by our suffering squattocracy
Women riders at the Show were a smart
and workmanlike lot. Mrs. Stace was once
more champion horsewoman, and confided
that she doesn’t like the ride-astride so
well as the old horned side-saddle. A small
girl, in a long white coat, sliced up behind,
and short divided skirts, rode her pony
astride round the Show ring like a
bird. Miss Dolly Fogg, who sits like wax
in her saddle, snatched the equestrienne
prize, with Miss E. Courtney, a dashing
second, hard at her horse’s heels.
Mrs. Walker, a Melbourne visitor, is the
large and cheerful-looking aunt of Mayoress
Cocks. Auntie Walker belongs to the genial,
sweet-natured type of elderly matron, ad-
dicted to flowered muslins of big patterns
and ample dimensions; and she looks a
credit to her daily bread. Slightly old-
fashioned beside the slim silhouettes of
1913, Mrs. Walker, all smiles, surrounded
the Easter bun like a halo or a benediction.
Lord Dick Nevill is over here for the
races. He slipped his gorgeous chamber-
lain’s collar, at present inky-black for the
untimely end of poor George in far off
Salonika, and crept unofficially into this
port. . On Saturday his extreme length,
clad in a meek sac suit, stalked across the
Randwick lawn, pursued by the buzz of a
swarm of friends.
There will have been private hops in the
I addmgton Town Hall and under the domes-
tic shingle at Darling Point before this
meets you. The Frank Davenports’ dance
this Tuesday brings out a flock of debutantes,
including the daughter of the house. Mrs.
I rank is one of our nicest-looking matrons,
who cheerfully cultivates the art of looking
as young as she feels—which is 30 or less.
The Mutton Matrons and other members
of the country nobility are giving the most
extensive hop of a tame Easter. A ton or
two of flowers have been snipped off for
decorative garlands, etc. The Paddington
lown Hall, which has about the most satis-
factory floor of any public building in this
town, is the place and Wednesday the date.
Uampbells, Whites (from up Muswellbrook
way), McMasters, Chisholms, Dangars,
Morts, Wills-Allens, pud half a score more
matrons whose husbands’ flocks and herds
munch a fat share of N.S.W. grass, are the
hostesses.
Most of the “Society” gatherings have
been engineered by women. Though a few
eligible bachelors have been morally squeezed
into answering back with a dance on Friday
night, a thrifty habit of not wasting cash on
other people’s champagne is noticed amongst
our gilded youth of 40 summers or so.
Beastly rot, don’t you know, stumping up
for parties for gangs of women !” said one
bright youth who was asked to lend his aid
to a race-week revel. “They lap up such
gallons of fizz !”
The Arthur Morgans, from Bananaland,
have been in the perspiring throng that re-
cently surged round Sydney’s Easter bun.
He is President of the Leg. Council in Bris-
bane, and grows side-whiskers as a regular
habit. For many years he was reign-
ing sovereign in Warwick (Q.) and its
adjacent pastures, and laid down the law a s
proprietor of the local newspaper.
A usually sprightly dame drops in a line
from the Federal camp at Canberra. The
line got waterlogged on the journey, hence
its belatedness. “The climate,” says she,
‘with the exception of the day of the chris-
tening, was everything that Canberra’s
fiercest opponents have declared it. We
arrived in burning heat, and went into camp
near the scene of the O’Malley’s Federal
crow. Since then, it has rained, hailed,
wailed, and, I believe, snowed on the hills.
\V e took our best frills, but goloshes and
an Arctic rug were the chief necessities of
life. It was fine for the show, but at other
times the wind has nearly torn the hair off
our heads. The unfortunate Light Horse
had many of their tents torn to tatters by
the gale that shrieked round the village of
canvas huts. The Denmans must have had
a blue and chilly time in their camp, for,
like others, they had no fire to warm their
toes. None of the inhabitants of milder
regions who lived under canvas at Canberra
“arlv in March. 1913, are likely to make
any frantic rush for suburban homes on
these wind-swept plains.”
Amongst the last strikes of summer are
the South Coast coal upheaval and the
sudden jibbing of the Sydney ferry-hands
An absent-minded North Sydneyite was
waiting on his usual wharf on the first
morning of the ferry hold-up. “Say, Mister
don teller know there’s a strike?” said the
casual boy who was dangling his body over
the pier. Thanks my lad,” says the man
of learning, 111 order a fuel stove this verv
day!
Artist Rupert Bunny writes from Paris :
The news of Rignold’s death brings back youthful
memories. I was so stage-struck when I had seen
him that I begged my father to apprentice me to
him, as I thought that was the prosaic path that led
to fame. If I hadn’t grown so ridiculously tall, or
rather lanky, I might have stuck to my first love,
the stage. Oddly enough, I was offered' a first-class
engagement in U.S.A. by a manager who chanced to
see me in some amateur affair we got up for the
American Club in prehistoric days. I was heavily
disguised with a wig and a false nose for this per-
formance, and even the shyest person can be more
than daring under such circumstances....
I am working hard, as I have two things going
for the Salon; if I have time I may try to finish
another picture for the Academy-, but fear I won’t
be able to manage it. . . .
It is a very funny thing, but to a certain extent
an artist must remain as simple as a stup’d child to
do really good work. An Abbe, a friend of ours
here, used to teach drawing to some children in his
parish. He observed that the stupidest drew best,
and I quite realise why. If you ask a child —an
ordinary, normal one—to draw you ; house that you
see about a mile away, she (or it) a- once starts by
drawing a square and putting in a, ors, windows,
etc., which are not seen at that distance probably,
but are remembered by an observant child ; whereas
the stupid youngster copies what it sees, and gives
you the real impression of distance. Most painters,
I fancy, find that one of the most difficult things in
art is to be able to forget what a. thing is really
like in detail, and try to see it as if their eyes had
just opened for the first time in their lives.
Concerning the Futurists and other
strange mushrooms that have sprung up in
the Latin Quarter, Bunny remarks: —
Art in Paris at present is in a state of revolution.
It requires strength of character and judgment to
decide what path to follow. Broad, flowered roads
which lead to destruction are opening all round one,
and I fear a great deal of the younger talent will
follow them down to oblivion. To-day, with this
post-impressionism and cubisme, etc., everybody is
a “genius,” and every youngster a “master” after
six months’ loafing in the Quartier Latin. The snob-
bism which has got' into art is appalling. People
pose pretentiously as they assume the comprehension
of absolute insanities. “Insanities” is a compliment,
but I can find no other word. Of course, in this modern
movement there is some good, but it’s very danger-
ous for the men who haven’t gone first to the foun-
dations.
Artist Julian Ashton, who has done so
much fine teaching in Sydney, tells a tale of
two travellers who were caught unawares
by the shock of the French Futurists’ wild
daubs. Traveller the first, an Australian
abroad, was lying on th« broad of his back
at the exhibition, kicking his heels in the
air, and emitting grunts, yells and other
symptoms of frenzied mirth. The floor was
covered with sawdust, presumably to prevent
the crunch of boot-leather breaking up the
harmoqies on the wall. Traveller the
second, recognising the person writhing in
the sawdust, rushed up and said, “What’s
the matter?” “Matter!” says he. “God
bless my soul, look at the show! We’ve
struck the finest comic cuts on earth !”
The ancient Standard has passed into
oblivion, to make way for its regarnished
survivor, The Little Theatre, which was
ouened at least three times last week.
Mayor Cocks was the first to officially click
the latch. This ceremony was performed
with a corkscrew. Two days later, half the
frills of Darling Point and most of the
Pottses and the Pipered Points sailed up
the main passage to get as near the orchestra
as possible. Having talked down the music
with great success,, the company broke into
fragments and chattered like mammies in a
large underground cell, well and truly fur-
nished. Here our sex can retire to sip
coffee while its legal lord (or someone else’s)
dashes into the night air to inquire about
the nearest bottled dog.
Mayoress Cocks was the godma of
the second opening of The Little Theatre,
having been secured for that purpose by
Hugh Buckler and beauteous Violet Paget.
The latter, by the way, had the best-brushed
head of golden hair present. General
Gordon seemed to suddenly smite the
rafters of the ladies’ cellaret'te, which
is designed to accommodate short, fat
women, rather than tall, lean men. The
musical Hollanders, the long elegance of
Mrs. Tom Rolin, a selection from the family
of Moses, the George Earps (little Mrs.
George just visible under the brim of a
fashionable millinery tomb), and Reynolds
Denniston, who has a finger in this theatri-
cal pie, rose from the surface from time to
time.
Zanelli, who came with the Melba Opera
Co., and has lingered on this shore ever
since, now packs up for Paris. Before throw-
ing a farewell kiss to the nicest-looking
persons hereabouts, he sings his swan song
in the Concordia Hall on April 8. Fiddler
Cyril Monk and the small, brown-eyed
Esther Kahn are amongst the assistant
artists.
Contralto Eugenie Boland is returning to
Sydney in May after about five years’ ab-
sence. The tall, fair girl from Toowoomba,
who is an ex-pupil of Madame Christian,
has been earning considerably more than a
crust in the English provinces and else-
where since she went forth to try her voice
in other climes. The inevitable welcome-
home concert is pending.
Ray Royce, the recently-arrived actor
from N’York, has played gentle, old-man
parts for so many years that he has assim-
ilated the character, and now wears it off
the boards. He’s so mild and suave in
manner that it is alleged he would apologise
to the stage doormat if he rubbed it up the
wrong way. Noting this extraordinary
meekness in a ’Murkan mummer, one mem-
ber of the J.C.W. staff remarked a day
before the “Fortune Hunter” opened: “You
don’t —er- — look, much like an actor?” “No,
sir,” says Royce, “but I hope to to-morrow
night.
One of the lighter touches in the S’Africa
soldiers’ dinner the other night was an
apology from the Gee-Gee for his unavoid-
able absence. As his Ex. would have to
bring along a portable bed and camp in the

may be taken as “received.” This is tl

One of the innumerable Suttor familv

was married the other day to squatter
Walter Barnes, of Dryaaba station, U n

eligible and elusive bachelor in those parts

The Macarthur-Onslows and Mr. “Ossv”
Watt are going to shape the destinies of the
“Twilight Home” for old ladies, as directors
or something of the kind. The next thing
is to get a building-site which all hands will
like. When the Home for Incurables wa«
moved from its humble tenement in a mean
city street to an airy mansion at Ryde sur-
rounded by a generous acreage of grassy
lawns, the people most concerned were
deeply offended. They were getting “too
much country life,” and for the first few
months they poured their sorrows into the
ear of every visitor. “To them that’s born
and bred in the town,” said one old dame
“there’s no place like the city. ‘You can
hear the birds singin’ in the trees where you
are now,’ ses one lady to me. I just told
her I’d rather hear the milk-cart clatterin’
down the street, or a man singin’ out
‘prawns’—and so I would!” If the Twi-
light Home is to have garden space and
breathing room, it can’t flap its blinds with-
in a stone’s throw of the G.P.0.; yet if the
committee gets too far from the madding
motor, high-spirited old veterans will want
to know if they’re going to be buried aliye,
or what?
The thunder of Willie Kelly’s oratory was
drowned in the uproar of the great Beef and
Bacon show. Willie addressed the “Liberal”
ladies of Rose Bay and adjacent lawns at an
evening party on March 19. Unfortunately
the oration fell up against dailies crowed
with tons of matter re pumpkins and prize
pigs. In consequence, what Mr. Kelly really
o d say to his lady friends about the wicked
ways of the Socialistic Tiger which gobbles
up young and tender maidens when they’re
not hanging on to the political coat-tails of
little Willie, is chiefly surmise.
Horticulture for women and the Right
Way to intimidate the Australian hen to lay-
eggs in Lent and other high-priced seasons,
is again struggling to the fore. The neces-
sary information will be locked up in lec-
tures, which begin on March 26 at No. 7
O’Connell-street (city). Mr. 11. R. Harris,
who knows all the subterfuges of the wily
fowl, is announced to give the first exposi-
tion on her many vices and occasional vir-
tues, for the benefit of women who want to
l ’unge into the chicken trade.
The Royal Art Society has invited its
friends and enemies to a private view of
cabinets on April 5. On the 7th the public
will have a chance of dropping its sixpence
at the portal.
The new autumn hats are either as small
and round as the Easter egg, with a chook’s
feather dangling behind, or fairly large and
strewn with a blizzard of ostrich plumes.
May 28 is fixed as the date for the whoop
of triumph to be raised on the top of Mount
York to celebrate the centenary of the cross-
ing of the Blue Mountains. Mt. York itself
will gain a water-tank and a pavilion. The
latter is not to be fenced off with barbed
wire, or guarded by an armed force. After
distracting discussion, the celebrations com-
mittee has decided to trust the tourist,
though he is so prone to attack mountain
scenery with a penknife. He will merely be
requested not to hack bits oat of the
memorial pavilion—and the rest will be left
to his own good sense, if he has any.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORLAN.
“Y.Z.” Yon must have noticed the difference
in the public frame of mind with regard
to the two Antarctic tragedies—that which
leaves Scott and his companions under a vast
monument of ice, and the other that buried
Mawson’s companions in eternal snow. The
one stirred humanity to its depths; it har-
rowed our souls within an inch of the limit,
and left us barren of compassion and cash.
The other has had scarcely any more effect
upon the public’s sensibilities than might
have been occasioned by the disappearance
of two Dutch inebriates from a fish-scow in
the Yarra. Yet, all things considered, the
end of Mawson’s men was quite as tremen-
dous and tragic as that of Scott and _ his
little band ; and, in common fairness, civil-
ised communities were called upon to be
almost as disturbed and pathetic over the
one as they were over the other. But it
could not be. Let this be a warning to
heroes, teaching them to beware of the anti-
climax. Every hero should know when to
die as well as how, and the one who elects
to perish magnificently right on the heels of
another who has used up all the available
human emotion is absolutely certain to be
cut dead.

THE creator of “Little Nell” you surely know and love. His books have

Oliver Twist, Jenny Wren and Agnes Wakefield —all of his characters

Suppose by an accident of environment you had never enjoyed
Dickens —that his works had no meaning for you—that you
had never read them. And, further, suppose that not only
Dickens, hut Shakspeare, Milton, Thackeray, Irving and all
literature were forbidden you. The world would be dull

Yet do you know Robert Schumann—as great in music as Dickens in
literature? Dickens wrote “Nicholas Nickelby,” but Schumann composed
“Carnaval.” “A Christmas Carol” is no greater or more appealing than
“Traumerei.” Who can listen to “The Two Grenadiers” without a thrill
of exultation ? And Schumann is but one of a thousand famous composers.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 24, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
After Lady Fuller has settled her young
family at school, she intends to stay awhile
with grandpa and grandma in Wiltshire
(Lng.), and tell the old folks all about the
vice-regal achievements of son John. Her
Kx. feels the need of a quiet holiday, and
will not return till next October. Later on,
Auntie Phipps, who has just landed on In-
dian soil, is to join her again. Meanwhile,
the lonely Gov. and his reduced staff will
struggle along and wrestle with the food
problem. Help Wheatley, whose billet was
kept open for him, has definitely decided to
stay in England. This is disappointing, as
Y\ heatley is a useful sort of man who
can control a household. • The food depart-
ment has now been entrusted to Secretary
Wilberforce.
State Government House is getting very
confused with its visitors’ list, and the staff
lias been smudging ink on its ears trying to
plan a way out of the difficulties. As things
are at present, each shower of invitations
brings forth a crop of complaints from the
local nobility. Daughters get invitations
while Mamma is ignored as completely as
if she went out washing by the day. Then
Mamma bears down like an angry cow on
some anguished young man with beautifully
brushed hair, and demands to know who
will chaperone her girls if she is not to be
asked inside the place? One married man
received a vice-regal dinner invitation at his
club. . There was no mention of his more
talkative half, so he guessed it was purely
a man’s spree. When the lady in the next
mansion mentioned to his wife that she had
been invited, the fat was instantly at the
telephone, and the Fuller staff received an-
other jolt by wire. Governor Fuller should
sool his forces on to the compilation of a
secret. tome, to be called “The Feedirg
Families.” Perhaps it would be best to
have it in one of those books with removable
leaves. Then when poor old Smithjones fell
with a social crash, a Help, in faultless
clothes, could painlessly extract him from
the ledger without spilling ink over the sur-
vivors.
Prior to his departure for London as
Agent-General, Peter Mcßride was tendered
a final farewell in the shadow of the Gaud
Mayor’s rabbit-skin; while the Mayoress
entertained Mrs. Peter and her friends in
the “blue” room of the Town Hall. The
amateur music was so plentiful that guests
were forced to sub-edit their conversation,
ihe blinds were drawn, and the light was
dim enough for a spiritualistic seance. Mrs.
Peter, a handsome woman, was neatly
dressed in navy-blue tailorings, and sup-
ported a smart feathered hat. Young daugh-
ter Kathleen, also smartly tailored, wore a
cunning little presentation posy dangling
from a bracelet, whilst mamma bore like a
shield a brilliant shower bouauet handed to
her by the Mayoress. Mrs. Davey, with pink
roses in her hat, and Mrs. Pleasance, accom-
panied by a blue-and-white daughter, were
amongst those who sipped and chattered.
Mrs. Garnett inhabited a delightful gown of
mole color and purple, and Mrs. Geoffrey
Svme, her daughter, looked dainty in black
and white. During an interval in the music
a young and sweetly-frocked matron lisped
a fairy story. The organ did not groan
heavily over this function. Mr. and Mrs
Peter, with daughter Kathleen, left by next
morning’s mailboat, after a delightfully
tiring week of farewells.
The Druids’Bazaar blazed open on Saturday.
Before midday the echoing Exhibition was
tuff of carriers asking pietously “Ey!
Where s this ter go?” and aproned society
matrons rushing in three directions at once,
while, outside, motors jostled, and furniture
vans blocked the entrances, and scornful
shovers dredged unwieldy parcels from the
depths of fiery chariots. By two o’clock every-
thing was in order and ready for the solemn
opening ceremony by the Denman lady. The
attendant Help was Nutting, who wore im-
maculate white spats, black and white troll-
's of faultless cut, an irreproachable tie,
and a clean collar. Two serious policemen
made a pathway for the usual processional
visit to the stalls. Her Ex. wore black and
white stripes, pearls round her neck, and
black plumes on her hat. A velvet-collared
and very hot Druid of particular eminence
worried in advance of the little procession,
bide by side with him panted Mr* Hood,
crowned with a savage circlet of pink feath-
ers. Gaud Mayor Hennessy, severely frock-
coated, escorted his wife, who had all she
could do to keep up with him. Mrs. Fel-
stead’s white frock contrasted nicely with
Mrs. Brennan’s dignified black rig.' The
latter lady had no less than eight daughters
bushranging for charity. They are practised
brigands.. Pa is a Past Grand, or something
of the kind. Help Nutting had hard work
to get through, since convention compelled
him to linger behind and settle up for the
stall purchases of her Ex. Little Judith
Denman was also, included in the party, and
Nutting looked quite pleased when she tugged
imperiously at his sleeve, and insisted on
bemg taken behind the scenes to meet some
of the lady performers on the trapeze!
Her Ex. was due at the George Chirn-
sides’ Werribee place for evening dinner
and the week-end. As Werribee is a good
20 miles out of town, she began to sprint.
Possessing a fine sporting stride, she covered
much ground once she started to speed up.
The watching crowd was greatly cheered
when her dignified train had to start jog-
ging to keep within coo-ee. The social
handicap finished at the tea-tables in the
rooms of the Exhibition Trustees/
The far-out suburbs of Oakleigh and Mul-
grave joined forces in an original stall
laden with fruit and vegetables. Mayoress
Arnold Westley wore a low-necked white
muslin frock, and sold apples. Mrs. Wilmot
and Mrs. Tait, of Hawthorn, pushed off
potatoes, onions and home-made crabapple
jelly. Mayor Westley looked on with a
proud smile and helped trundle marrows
and things. Mrs. Quinnell, of the Austral
Salon, handed in a stout cheque to the
funds. The Salonettes did not fix up a
stall, but just plaved bridge a little, and so
got some money together.
Last week Prime Minister Fisher superin-
tended the marrying of his- wife’s sister to
Eli Edwards, one of our crack yachtsmen.
Christina Irvine was a bonny vision when
decked out in her silk and lace and crowned
with the conventional veil and blossom.
Tetty Fisher, the Prime Minister’s small
daughter, with an enormous pink sash
round her chest, carried the white satin
cushion for the bride to kneel on. The
grown-up maids were sister Miss Irvine and
Miss Edwards—one all pink and the other
all white, like cocoanut ice. The affair was
billed as a quiet function, but 50 relatives
saved it from being absolutely noiseless. Hugh
I aterson and his wife, sisters and daugh-
ters were the only guests not actually allied
to the family. The two clever Paterson
girls played the Wedding March, one
manning the piano and the other a violin.
Mrs. Andrew Fisher looked handsome in a
black gown that was built in London.
(Warning to Angry Interjector: “No! this
is not the place to talk about Protection!”)
Grandma was a soft vision in grey. And
the finale was all motor whir and confetti.
Mrs. Davey, ex-Mayoress, is now doing
a round of farewell tea-and-bun feasts
arranged by friends. She is listed as an
April departure for England. Davey’s
nephew has hung on to his job of Gaud
Mayor ot London for another term, and he
is anxious to board and lodge his aunt and
uncle while he reigns. Unhappily, business
will keep Uncle Davey here for another four
months; but as soon as he is free he will
steam after his buxom dame and escort her
back early next year.
Another pair of wanderers who intend to
turn Europe upside down are the doctoring
Godfrey Howitt couple. They sailed last
week in the tall ship Otranto.
Clara Butt approaches. She has left
America after a sustained conquest, and is
coming hither with the usual retinue. The
caravan, which, of course, includes all the
children, is timed to arrive in May, 10 days
before the opening bars are played. The
first concert will inaugurate the new Tait
concert hall, which is guaranteed to be fitted
with all the modern improvements.
A Canadian visitor, Mr. Cockshutt, is in
Melbourne making a noise like a million-
aare. His little dinners and suppers are per-
fect things in their way, and mothers of
nice girls are _ endeavoring to find out if the
rich and hospitable stranger .is a bachelor or
a mere grass-widower. On the last night of
the Asche-Brayton season, he dined a num-
ber of people at Menzies’. took them along
to the theatre, and afterwards suppered at
the Savoy. Others of the audience made
their way to the same place for the final
gorge of the day. The Asches themselves
had a table with a fountain in the centre-
piece threatening the electric globes with its
spray. Lily showed a considerable expanse
of dimpled shoulder and a few jewels above
the heaped flowers. Oscar’s face, shirtfront
and diamond stud radiated with good nature
and prosperity. None of the late feeders
disturbed their drowsy shovers until the cold,
thoughtful hours that walk on cold feet be-
fore the dawn. Rupert Clarke came on from
the theatre with another hungry party; and
Mrs. Garnett, with the Derhams and 'daugh-
ter Mrs. Syme, floated in to join another
contingent. '
Mrs. Cadoyin (once upon a time Bendigo's
Loyie Mueller) is now established with iher
Italian sculptor-husband in a flat; at White-
hall —the Melbourne Whitehall, not thqhis-
tonc London palace. Cadorin’s beautiful
statuary is all over the place, jostling‘tor
room with the sideboard, the piano an| the
coal-scuttle. One of the most pathetic sights
in the world is an art treasure fighting for
house-room with ordinarv furniture.
A cold, wet wind did its villainous best
to spoil the Fairbairn festivity, but, in spite
of all, a crowd of the Most Exclusive came
along to do their duty. The function served
as a general good-bye to daughter Alison
(who has since steamed off to London, after
collecting her captain husband and the small
Stewart Balmains), and as a welcome to son
Clive’s bride. Geordie Balmain and little
Valerie Purvis distributed fans imprinted
with a musical programme. Maggie Ster-
ling and daughter, Claude Schilling and
Weston Pett supplied the music ; but the in-
tended audience mostly eluded the melody,
and hurried away to play bridge. Mamma
Fairbairn was a gorgeous spectacle in ame-
thyst panne piped with parrot red; her hat
was cosily swathed with fur. Mrs. Balmain
wore an airy lace garment and a blue hat,
which fluttered with ostrich plumes. Pretty
Mrs. Clive was enclosed by yards of spiral
drapery as grey as the day itself. Millers,
Langdales, Clarkes and Emmertons abounded.
George Fairbairn wandered about wearing
a troubled look. The crowd was fed under
canvas, which, being soaked, showered rain-
drops on the gay plumage below. The at-
tendant brass band got exceedingly wet on
the lawn, and drank between bars the rain
that poured into their instruments.
The Good Friday holiday crowd, flocking
towards the Flinders-street station, stopped
and gaped, thrilled by the suggestion that
there was a funeral procession to make splen-
did the official gloom of the day. But it
turned out to be merely a vice-regal party
coming away from St. Paul’s Cathedral after
morning service. Governor Fuller led the
procession, endeavoring to conceal his nat-
ural chirpiness under a black top hat, and
talking in furtive undertones with Help Cur-
wen, who flapped sorrowful black coat-tails.
The Fuller lady, heavily draped in black,
followed with t" r o fair-haired children, both
of them woe-fully clad. A black nursery
Help towed another sad infant in front of
an attendant group of clergy. The lugubri-
ous march terminated at the kerb, where the
yellow motors were in waiting.
Aileen Bell, the Bananaland heiress who
has been staying with the Norman Army-
tages, was farewelled by Mrs. Norman at
the Alexandra Club. The hostess smiled
over the buns in pretty clouds of black, while
daughter Edna, robed in blue, hovered in
attendance. The departing Bell gurgled her
good-byes in a chalk-white frock and a hat
decorated with a rose of great size. Sep
Miller’s wife, fresh from her travels, looked
well under a wide satin lid. Violent color
contrasts were to be seen on every side.
Mrs. Hodges sported a violet sash 'over a
magpie blend. Mrs. Scobie Mackinnon shep-
herded a grass-green daughter. A brilliant
streak of purple located Mrs. Douglas Men-
zies, and a splash of aggressive blue pro-
claimed. Mrs. Clarke. Mrs. Seaton Williams,
the Wrixon dame, and George Paxton’s neat
wife were other features of the costly
kaleidoscope.
The Bowes Kelly matron brought over a
horrible attack of bronchitis from the Speck,
and was thereby defrauded of the gaieties
that accompany the Autumn horse-frenzy.
Her just-out girleen (who, by the way, has
inherited the maternal good looks) is now
tackling the housekeeping problem with
great courage. The elder son, Moncton, is
an elegant ’Varsity boy who fairly soars
out of his boots. He soars 6ft. sin.
Grey-haired Millie Carter is starting off
on a second tramp abroad with her bosom
friend, Mrs. C. M. Lloyd. The trip is in-
tended as a sort of consolation prize for win-
ning health after many weary months of
sickness. It was not appendicitis, but neu-
ritis, that kept her in her room, and her best
chiffons in the wardrobe. The departing
pair will give a tea in the Alexandra Club
on the last day of March.
Lawyer Warming proposes to chip into
the matrimonial boom. His fiancee is Lilian
Samers, the pretty daughter of Councillor
Samers, of Avoca.
Some cheery young men who had invaded
a Victorian country town incited the local
bachelors to arrange a dance. When the
programmes came out, it was found that
various trots and hugs had been mixed up
with the custom-honored gyrations. The
local dowagers started to cluck excitedly,
and sped to and Lo kicking up the dust,
until all the new contortions were called off
and the programme amended. The names
kill the modern dancing novelties. They
would have a much better chance of passing
the censors if they could be given dignified
processional labels like the St. Paul’s This
and the Westminster That.
Public opinion is an awful snag some-
times. W hen Mr. Woolacres and Mrs.
YV oolacres the second sailed into the dining-
room of a first-rank hotel, a sort of con-
certed shudder ran through the room. Fallen
cutlery rattled on plates, and the sibilant
piss of silk dresses sounded like 40 serpents,
as the women turned round to stare and
gasp, “How dare they!” The sympathy of
the house was plainly with the first Mrs.
oolacres. Later on, a deputation, swollen
with righteous indignation, approached the
manager, and put it plainly to him that they
could not continue to breathe the same
whisky and hash as the new Woolacre pair.
The thrilling episode terminated with the
more or less dignified retreat of the new
u oolacres towards a less partisan shelter.
After heating that the close friendship
between a wealthy Toorak widow and an-
other matron had been cut off like a tele-
phone conversation, a few people at a fash-
ionable bun scramble were astonished when
the widow made a bee-line for her former
friend’s husband, and remarked pleasantly:
“Ah, Mr. Dash. I do feel sorry to think you
nave been so deceived in your wife.” The
unfortunate man reeled where he stood, but
came’ up bravely with: “So do I!' But I
think the less said about it the
husband can’t be expected to talk A
about how he was deceived in hkT ently
one. The subject is too stale ™ dearest

In the midst of all this the Milne-Fotheringham
wedding occurred at Chalmers Church. The bride
a tall, handsome girl, looked her cheerful best in
conventional white and carried a sheaf of cream”
lilies. Her four bridesmaids were in soft tones of
p mk and. blue, mauve and yellow, which is more
sensible than cramming half a dozen women into i
color which probably suits only one or two of them
Toasts were drunk and speeches made at the Fother
inghams house at Magill.

Mr. W. Howchin had congratulations showered
upon him at the meeting of the Public Library
Board on Friday. The Australian Association for
the Advancement of Science has presented him with
a medal in recognition of his original research in
Australasia. Mr. Howchin is a keen geologist, and
can unfold many a tale of Australia’s goings-on in
the glacial epoch.
The whirl of winter is beginning. Invitations are
out for a datiee at Mount Lofty on trie Thursday
after Easter. A committee, about a dozen strong
is responsible for the festivity.
A cold, bleak wind reduced the attendance at the
Autumn regatta to its lowest terms. Oncp more the
Murray Bridge crew came to the front; but in the
Ladies’ Race the tables were turned and the country-
men were left languishing in the distance.
The Easter exodus from the city was great, and
accommodation in the hills is at a premium. Mr.
IV. Bakewell is having a house-party at Mt. Lofty
for the Easter week-end; it is hostessed by his
daughter, Mrs. O’Leary. Other lucky folk who havp
houses in these plutocratic heights are planning to
drive their friends over to Oakbank. Old stagers
complain that this Onkaparinga meeting is now too
luxurious, and sigh for other ways and days. Secre-
tary von Doussa takes no part in these repinings, and
watches the steadily-improving returns with a proud
eye.
Miss J. O’Halloran Giles leaves fpr England at the '
end of April, with Miss Mabel Marryat. Miss Meek
■and Mrs. Melville leave next week. Miss George, who
was farewelled by her one-time pupils at the High
School on Wednesday, has also booked for Europe.
The Port Adelaide races drew a redotd crowd to
Cheltenham on Saturday; but lovely woman mostly
stayed away. The totalisator showed an advance
of nearly £2OOO on last year. The sweetest thing
for backers was a -£l7 10s. dividend paid by Mar-
ooned in tlie Island Handicap.
The League of Empire is pushing on the move-
ment to erect in Adelaide a memorial to explorer
Sturt. So far neither he nor Flinders have any local
masonry to their honor. Light and Stuart are
Adelaide’s favored ones—with a Hercules and a
Queen Victoria in bronze near by.
The Misses Hawk os, of Koonunga station, have

Holman lias been telling the London
Daily Chronicle that Labor unrest in
N.S.W. has practically ceased. A visitor,
who has spent the last month in Sydney, has
been heard timidly asking what things are
like when the unrest really gets to business.
The Rev. S. Knight, at a Methodist Young
People’s Demonstration, Melbourne : “Put the
same excitement into church matters that
is expended on football matches, and you’ll
simplv set the land on fire.” That’s all very
well, but there are things one can’t get ex-
cited about. Cold suet duff, for instance.

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE DEFENDER , AND THE SAME
OLD SPIRIT.
Mr. Bruce Smith yesterday said the adoption of
the Referenda would be the greatest calamity that
ever happened to Australia. Political wreckers and
declared partisans were trying to force them upon
the Australian people.— Sydney paper.
The anti-Defence person makes strange
remarks. A Maoriland specimen of the
alleged Socialistic kind suggests mildly that
“when our Defence scheme is fully work-
ing, thousands of our youths will be re-
jected, not for financial but for political
reasons.” Which apparently means that, in
the view of this convinced preacher of the
doctrine of brotherhood, John Smith could
not be trusted with a rifle lest he should go
out and shoot his boss in token of blood-
relationship.
Two new amusements threaten the elector
in Victoria. One Renwick announces him-
self as a Freetrade candidate for the Senate,
which is equivalent to a nice young mis-
sionary-bishop announcing to the cannibals
of Malayta that he is succulent and tender,
and has never smoked tobacco, which is a
filthy weed. The other amusement is the
earnestness of the Age in its attempt to
become anew the electoral power it used to
be ere David the King waxed old. The new
crusade is conducted with stodgy conversa-
tions between the candidate and the elector.
The one-time trumpet of the Age is a
squeaking fife now; and it makes matters
worse by losing the music and playing bag-
pipe noises out of its own head.
“Side Lights” prods somebody:—
The men whose job it is to search out and look
after Australian ports will have to keep moving—
especially those whose job lies with ports that
haven’t got too much depth for the liners they
already know. The vogue of big and bigger steamers
has advanced with a jump during the past few years,
even the past few months. In England it was re-
cently demonstrated clearly by hard-headed men
who don’t care a cuss for anything outside the
question of what pays best, that it costs only 20 per
cent, more to carry 10,950 tons dead weight than
to carry 5910 tons. There were a lot of other im-
portant conclusions about higher speed and block co-
efficients, etc., but they are small fry besi'de that
20 per cent. fact. Owners and builders grabbed
the lesson with both hands, and hurriedly started in
to slam together bigger boats. The results are in
skeleton form in all the British yards to-day.
Four ships are building of over 20,000 tons. These
are Aquitania, Britannic, a new Holland-American
liner and a Red Star liner. The Royal Mail Steam
Packet and Pacific Steam are building liners of over
15,000 tons, and two Cape mailboats will go beyond
that. On the stocks there are in all 10 boats of
between 15,000 and 20,000 tons, nine of 12,000 to
15,000, and 16 of 10,000 to 12,000. Australian
lines can’t afford to ignore the cheapness of the big
boat. The first question, therefore, is how long will
it be before a fleet of 20- to 30-thousand tonners is
running to Australia? And the second is how many
Australian ports will be able to accommodate them?
Did anyone mention Jervis Bay and other neglected
deep-water harbors ?
THE BRITISH LION.
ENGLAND IN APATHY.
London, March 7.- The Guardian says that while
Australia has established a system of national mili-
tary service, and Canada has assumed the defence
of her coasts and frontiers. England has neither the
men nor the stomach to take up a like task, but
prefers to shout at football matches and eat sweets
in picture palaces.— Cable.
Commonwealth Statist Knibbs is advocat-
ing a five-year instead of the statutory 10-
year census. Serious discrepancies between
the Federal and State Statisticians are of
frequent occurrence, and 10 years is too
much to wait to clear them up. As long as
the Commonwealth pays the States 255. or
any other sum per head per annum, a fre-
quent census seems a necessity. The 10-year
event was adopted so that we might be just
like England; and we are not just
like England. England has unification,
while Australia, for the moment, thinks that
unification is some sort of untried dope
which shouldn’t be uncorked in respectable
company.
N.S.W. Works Minister Griffith had a
little heart-to-heart talk with the Hoskins
firm the other day, and said he thought he
was paying too much for the pipes that the
co. was making. If the firm couldn’t see
its way clear to meet him, he rather thought
the Department would start its own pipe
works and make the State independent of
Private Enterprise in the matter. There-
upon the S. M. Herald blew u" with a loud
leader, in which it declared that the Minis-
ter was not amenable to reason, that he was
either bullying or electioneering, that his
attitude represented an unscrupulousness
without parallel in our history, or it was so
much piracy. Less than a week before, the
Herald, commenting on “The Passing of
the Leaders,” wrote :
Men of ability and established position are re-
fraining from coming forward into public life.
The strain and worry of public life, the unwarranted
attacks on their character, sincerity and honor, all
discourage men who would be valuable legislators.
Does the Herald think that to declare a
Crown Minister either a bully or a pirate is
fair criticism calculated to cheer him up and
keep him going, and encourage others to
come in and share the compliments?
The Argus is heavily sarcastic because of
the Federal Government’s persistence with
its Referendum proposals; —
So it proposes to continue to pester the stupid
people until by force of repetition it gains from
their mere weariness what, owing to their want of
intelligence, they so emphatically refused to grant
before.
But The Bulletin can’t remember that
the Argus threw the same gibe at the direc-
tors of the A.M.P. Society for appealing again
and again to the members for authority to
push business in Britain. And it can’t
remember either that the Argus has told
the “Liberals” to leave off trying to oust
Labor Ministers because an attack has
been repulsed already. Also, when Scott
made one attempt to reach the Pole and
failed, what was the Argus doing that it
referred to his British bull-dog pluck m
having a second go at it?
Joe Hanan, who represents Invercargill’s
thirst in the Maoriland Parliament, has
been digging out some facts, with intent to
prove to Cohen that his investments in the
great Loan Land are all right. The export
figures per head of population he works out
as follows, excluding odd pence: Maori-
land, £2l; Australia, £l6; Britain, £11;
S’Africa, £9; Canada, £8; Germany, £5;
United States, £3; India, 10s. This may
be a very joyous story for Cohen, but, apart
from the fact that the figures mean little
unless you know what a country has to
export in order to pay interest to its foreign
creditor, it looks like pretty poor manage-
ment. A country that can send away £2l
worth per head in mutton, wool and other
raw materials could afford to keep a very
fine population at home to make better use
of most of the articles that go to help out
Bull’s breakfast and replenish his wardrobe.
Joe Cook has been opening his mouth
again, with the usual disastrous results.
The man of the many-colored coat was
snarling at the maternity al-
lowance, and remarked that no
one could even guarantee that
the money was going to the
person entitled to it, as there
was no machinery to follow it
to its destination. Apparently
Joe doesn’t know the payment
is made by post-office order,
payable only to the mother her-
self ; and if that isn’t “machin-
ery to follow it to its destina-
tion,” then the post-office order
business (which Joe himself
had a good deal to do with
when he was P.M.G.) is a
fraud. Incidentally, Joe re-
marked that some ladies got
the bonus and promptly paid
the money into their political
funds. Then he stopped. He
had given away one of the
“secrets” of the Great Liberal
Party.
A card from the “Constitutional Union,”
Melbourne, invites an army of local citizens
to become plural voters under the Electoral
Act of 1910, Prior to receiving a card
of instructions to the contrary, the average
tenant of a city office supposed One Man
One Vote to be the law in elections for the
Vic. Assembly. But the Constitutional
Union advises him as follows: —
Your City Vote for the Leg. Assembly, in addition
to your vote for the district in which you reside, is
now a Political Right of those who have Property
or Business Interests in the city.
The mere renting of a small office in a sky-
scraper building is a “business interest in
the city,” and. according to this reading, a
couple of hundred plural voters may be shel-
tered under one roof, thanks to the Electoral
Act of 1910.
King George of Greece was assassinated
last week. Another lamentable tonic for
the strengthening of Royalty and “Loyalty”:
Worse than useless, killing kings;
Monarchs leave successors;
Long as law allows such things,
Kings are not transgressors.
Bullets that have laid them low
Better far had missed ’em.
The assassin’s bomb or knife
Terminates a harmless life —
And serves a harmful system.

A ghastly tragedy took place in George-
street, Sydney, the other night, when Jim
Smith, the Australian citizen, got into an
argument with his other self, Jim Smith, the
N. S. Wales man. Jim the Australian ex-
pressed a quiet hope that Jim the Cornstalk
would vote sensibly on May 31, and make
the national Government strong. Jim the
Cornstalk accused Jim the Australian
of trying to wreck the glorious Constitu-
tion and destroy the grand old Mother State.
The Australian portion of Jim replied that
there was something wrong, as both the
Constitution and State Rights couldn’t be
wrecked by the same amendment —one or
other of them must be aggrandised. He
also inquired which were the greater, the
rights of the States, or the rights of the
people living in the States; and, anyhow,
what were State Rights? He answered him-
self by remarking coldly that State Rights
were mostly Trust Privileges. Whereupon the
N.S.W. portion of Jim screamed that,
according to Joe Cook, there were no trusts.
The Australian part of Jim pointed out
that an investigation by Glvnn, Attorney-
General in the Dbakin Government, revealed
the presence of 33 trusts and combines in
Australia, only about four of which could
be dealt with as the Constitution stood ; and
it was declared that Parliament was power-
less to deal with the other 29 in the pre-
sent state of the Constitution; wherefore
Jim the Australian asked Jim the Cornstalk
whether he liked trusts and high prices so
much that he didn’t want any body to have
power to deal with them- Just about this
point the N.$.W. portion of Jim became
exasperated, and he made a violent assault
upon himself, howling that he would not
have his State Rights taken from him, or
his glorious _ freedom cut down. He then
took a running jump at himself, and was
last seen by the astonished poliee in hot
nursitit of himself in the direction of Callan
Park.
There are occasions when the State Pre-
miers can show a most Federal spirit. Re-
cently the question of an Australian contri-
bution to the Scott fund cropped up, and
Prime Minister Fisher communicated with
the various State Premiers, asking if they
intended to act independently. There was
a unanimous decision on the part of the
State Insects that the Australian Govern-
ment was the right body in the right place.
So Australia will put up £2OOO.
ROUND AND ROUND.
Diagram showing the progress of the Fed. (but
still Hungry) Liberal party.
louseph Ward, at an Irish national
dinner in London, declared that every
Irishman in Maoriland had willingly borne
his share of the Dreadnought “gift.” How-
does Ward know? On the earliest possible
occasion after he had made the “gift” on
his own authority, he was kicked out of
office. If Ward has any evidence besides
that, in support of his theory that M.L.
favored his policy, he ought to produce it.
“Martin Luther”: How do the Liberals
imagine vain things if they expect to put
the Laborites out with such a leader as
Joseph Cook! He spoke at a Defence
dinner the other night, and was the one
speaker to prove a bore. Watson is always
magnetic because he is manly; Pearce’s
manner becomes attractive because he is so
much in earnest; but when the man with
the “e-10-cution” of a galvanised-iron taber-
nacle began to bleat I felt that there may
be worse inflictions than a Jap invasion. As
thus (verbatim) :
The Sou-eth Arfrican wa-ugh did moah for the
eon-sol-eed-ashun of the Empta/i than any othah
event in the ah histor-ee of the Eirip iah. I bee-leev
tha-at the wa-ugh was a nee-cess-itee of the Era-
pi ah and a writev-us wa-ugh. You appiaw-ud tha-
at, but you nev-ah sto upd to a-ask wheth-ah it was
a writey-us wa-ugh. It was ee-na-uff for you-u
tha-at the Emp-iah ca-alled.
Self-righteousness in every inflection, all
cadences falling self-consciously as a cur-
ate’s when the summer congregation slum-
bers through the threats of a material Hell
and the menaces of everlasting damnation.
THE CALL TO ARMS.
Liberals must awake, arise—gird on the armor—
and strike for the right.— Daily press.
" Now then! Produce your weapon and wade
in and distingtiish yourself !”
J. L. Fegan, who was Mines Minister in
the See Cabinet in the early ’9o’s, has been
unearthed to contest the Hunter Federal
seat against Matthew Charlton, the Labor
member. The mining vote is the deciding
factor in this electorate, and Fegan, an
ex-miner—very much ex —is looked to as a
forlorn hope.
DEVELOPMENT FROM WITHIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I say there is no need for a transcontinental
railway for some time to come. There is no need
for the expenditure of millions of money for a rail-
way north and south.... Don’t misunderstand me.
Developmental railways within the Territory are
necessary, but I protest against the construction of
the transcontinental line. — J. C. Watson.
We really do not need to build
A railway to the North at all;
The tropic fields are all untilled,
The population still is small;
In cautious haste we must begin
To fill the country from within.
A hooker prowling round the coast
May bring a settler now and then,
Or we may get by camel post
A straggling band of mining men;
While farm and station, gold and tin,
We still develop from within.
For we shall teach the cane to grow,
And strew the vales with tilth and corn,
While population starts to show
Its full intention to be born,
And stalwarts of our kith and kin
Develop grandly from within.
In one short fifteen hundred years.
Or eighteen hundred at the most,
We shall have mastered all our fears
And built some towns along the coast;
For in the end to fame we win
When things develop from within.
A strong horse-doctor at the wheel,
With plenty of officials near,
Fills us with pride and makes us feel
His is the proper way to steer ;
Our solid faith in him we pin—
His Excellency is within.
A railway costs the very deuce,
And might be money thrown away ;
Officials have their proper use,
And we are glad their screws to pay ;
With these in wisdom we begin
To fill the country from within.
There is no hurry ; all goes well;
We can afford to rest and wait —
At least until the Asian hell
Breaks loose upon our northern gate.
Then we shall yell and howl like sin
For rails to bring some soldiers in.
N.S.W.
MARY McCOMMONWEALTH.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
This week-end was dull from the Sydney
sportsman’s standpoint. Cricket was off, the big
clubs mostly sending friendly teams into the coun-
try. Sailing was likewise off, and the sole pastimes
were horse-racing, bowls, boxing and running motor-
boat ferries. The last was almost as lucrative as
horse-racing. One lucky launch-owner is said to
have raked in £lO9 for Friday and Saturday, and
then he went forth on Sunday to pick up the fat
crumbs that fell from the hastily-organised Govern-
ment service—and got ’em.
* * * #
The first day of the A.J.C. Autumn meet-
ing saw over 40,000 people present, all intent on
taking down the bookmakers; and, needless to say,
most of them came home, more or less fleeced. For
the stars in their courses and the high gods in
Olympus fight for the bag- of Patrick Iscariotstein.
In the great Doncaster Handicap the public went
baldheaded for Hartfell, the son of Ayr Laddie by
Light Heart, and long before starting time the best
on offer was two to one against him. Meanwhile
his half-brother, Jolly Beggar, Ayr Laddie’s son by
Lady Trenville, with 21b. more to carry, was beg-
ging at. 12’s. Barring his stable, no one seemed to
want him particularly. His jockey wore a white
cap, and when the race started that cap was
like the white plume of Navarre —-always in the
front. It flashed away from ’he jump, and 21
horses thundered behind it. It made the pace a
cracker till they turned into the straight;
and then a grey horse wc.it alongside. But
he stayed there only a second or so; the
white cap streaked to the front again, and
thundered for the goal. The whips came down
like hail flashing in the sunlight; the horses
bounded under the urging of whip and spur; but
the one that bore the white cap swept on, and won
by a length and a half —another classic race for
“Lucky” Connelly. A curious thing was that the
1912 and 1913 Doncasters were run in exactly the
same time, lmin. 40sec. Hartfell, the unlucky half-
brother who carried the public hopes and coin, was
nowhere, swallowed up in the ruck. It was Jolly
Beggar’s race from start to finish.
Some curiosities of Saturday’s Doncaster mile.
This is the sixth time the race has been run in
lmin. 40sec. The 22 starters were equally divided
into those carrying more and those carrying less
than Bst. It was the 27th Doncaster, but for the
first time, in the history of the race nothing less
than Bst. was placed. Jolly Beggar carried Bst.
131 b., Sir Willie Bst. 3Tb. and Golden Hop Bst 41b.
Moreover, the next five past the post also carried
over Bst. (St. Medoc Bst. 51b., Malt Mary Bst. 71b.,
Cider Bst. 91b., Hartfell Bst. 111 b. and My Gavonni
9st. 41b.). The foremost of those below Bst., the
most dangerous division in handicaps, was Seaton-
dale, a rank outsider, who came ninth with 7st. lib.
After the mob of 22 that raced for the gilded
Doncaster, the little bunch of seven that came out
for the St. Leger mile and three-quarters looked
ridiculously small. Wolawa, the son of Wallace,
by the Infanta, with Bst. 101 b. up, was made fav-
orite very promptly at five to four against. Barios
was second favorite at nine to four against. The
only other to attract coin xvas Harpist—the rest
were not seriously considered. Barios flashed to
the front, accompanied bv Cagou, and stayed there
till they entered the. straight side by side. Behind,
the thunder of Wolawa’s hoofs gave warning that
he was coming. At the distance Cagou fell back, and
Wolawa, gathering speed as he flew, raced home a
l°ngth to the good, in 3min. 6jsec. Cagou was four
lengths behind Barios, who had sparkled consider-
ably. The time was 3-Jsee. better than Jacamar’s
last year, and has been beaten only four times
since 1890. The—record run for the race was
Cadonia’s 3min. 4fsec. in 1911.
Everyone expected to see Piastre do something
this meeting, but ouite a lot of people apparently
did not suspect that he would do it in the Autumn
Stakes, which had only £lOOO of added money.
Otherwise Patrick Iscariot would never have laid
seven to four against him. And yet it is in
w.f.a. events that Piastre has come so suddenly to
the front this season. Probably the presence of
such horseflesh as Hallowmas, Eudorus and that
capable but cranky steed Cadonia, who always has
big possibilities about him, threw Piastre some-
what in the shade. Still, he had some claim to be
called favorite, with Aurofodina and Eudorus close
up. Eudorus, Jacamar and Ladv Medallist accom-
panied Piastre round the field till the home bend
was reached, where HalloWmas came up with ffriri
and raged like the heathen in suite of his sanctified
name. But Piastre had tens of steam in reserve,
and hounded awav. while Hallowmas left the strug-.
gling Jacamar behind, and went after the fleeting
son of Positano. - A hopeless chase. Piastre won
as he liked, with the great imported gee-gee four
lengths behind, in 2rnin. 35Jsee.
• * * * *
The Sydney Cup demonstrated what most
followers of horseflesh have long suspected, that
Cadonia, when he feels inclined, can travel like
Satan in pursuit of a fat Wowser soul when he feels
inclined. The trouble apparently is to get the noble
animal to feel that way. This" was the 48th Cup,
and the 3min. 28isec. put up by Cadonia has been
beaten only twice—by Wakeful in 1902, when that
wonderful mare did it in 3min. 28sec. neat; and by
Tartan in 1905, when that noble little prad flew
over the distance in 3min. 27sec. Wakeful carried
9st, 71b., Tartan 7st. 131 b., and Cadonia 9st. 7 lib.
The £5OOO added money drew a field of 27, and
there were chances of some beautiful bumping.
Cadonia got a bad one, which shook his jockey up,
but he stuck tp the job and made a magnificent
finish, winning? by half a length from Cagou, with
Jacamar i. third. Cagou and Jacamar both ran a
splendid race, and it was when the issue seemed to
swing between Cagou and Jacamar that Cadonia, who
had been forcing his way through the field, came
with a terrific burst of speed and overwhelmed them
both. Hallowmas, who had been made favorite at 5
to 2 against, finished in the ruck, without eyer hav-
ing shown any symptoms of being a winner. Other
public fancies were Barios, at 6 to 1 against; and
Moorila. at 8 to 1 against. Cadonia, in the public
estimation, was a rank outsider, and went out at
anything from 25’s to 50’s. It w 7 as a sore smack to
the public.
< * * *
“Flat”: Wherefore all this talk of “sur-
prises” over the victories of Jolly Beggar and Cado-
nia in the Doncaster and Sydney Cups respectively?
The Newmarket Handicap and Australian Cup sup-
plied reliable form for the punter to lay hold upon
had he the wit to do it. Jolly Beggar and Cadonia
filled second places in the big events down south,
and, while the increased weight hindered the New-
market winner, Relievo, the Australian Cup winner
was withdrawn frofn the tussle for the Sydney uten-
sil. There has been no “form” which pointed so
glaring^ 7 to what might happen for many and many
a day. Still, the sapient punters could not see it;
neither could the tipsters, and Jolly Beggar was
allowed to go begging at 12’s, while Cadonia was
not even asked for. Verily the way of the punter is
hard and his sight dim.
* * * *
“0.K.”: If the .Doncaster had been run
at Flemington, the starting price of Jolly Beggar
would not have been eight to one after opening at
14 to one on the course. It would probably have
ranged from sevens down to fours. On his performance
in the Newmarket he was the pick of the handicap.
The judge placed him two lengths behind Relievo
in passing the post, but the general impression was
that he nearly caught the leader. Anyhow, the
difference between the six furlongs sprint and the
Doncaster mile seemed to be all in favor of Jolly
Beggar. The Westralian nag ranks as a stayer.
At Flemington, when he just missed the big
coup, he was running a lot short of his distance,
and from a Victorian and Westralian point of view
he was a good thing for the Doncaster if the stable
backed him. The fact that Hartfell started favorite
meant that a great army of local punters had seen
Merton’s horse win the Epsom in the spring, and
the books had got him heavily backed with Hallow-
mas for the double. As for the Sydney fancy for
Cider, on his A.J.O. Derby form, it seemed absurd to
Victorian punters. Cider was doing very well up
to the time he got an attack of colic, after which
he was foolishly raced for the V.R.C. Leger, and
was probably weakened for an indefinite period. In
any case he would have had no visible pretensions
to beat Jolly Beggar at a difference of 4lb. only.
A somewhat amazing feature of the A.J.C.
first day was the stampede out of the Sires’ Produce
Stakes. On Thursday morning somewhere about 20
were in the book, but by four o’clock that afternoon
all but four had faded out, paying a fiver apiece to
avoid having a share of the £2OOO subsidy. A
remarkable instance of a general public movement.
Last year saw a dozen compete. Beragoon was an
odds-on favorite at once, 11 to 8 being the quota-
tion. Radnor was second favorite at 3 to 1 against,
and he justified the faith in him by finishing with
the favorite’s nose at his girth, having covered the
seven furlongs in lmin. 281 sec.

Something will have to be done to dis-
courage the papers from publishing pictures of
horse races taken at right angles to the course. The
animals are not horses in the picture; they are
dromedaries, bunyips, or prehistoric humorosities.
And any jockey has a first-class claim for damages
for being represented in the awful positions in which
the alleged pictures show him. Some day a man
suffering a recovery will gaze upon one of these
wondergraphs and go mad or fall down dead, and
his family will recover millions in damages.

The conduct of the back-benchers at Syd-
ney Stadium on Saturday night, when a Tasmanian
and a Westralian fought for the resident light-
weight championship of Australia, suggests that a
new official is urgently required. For some reason
the back-benchers took a sudden fanev to Alfred
Morey, the Westralian, and just as sudden a dislike
to Jack Read, the Tasmanian holder of the title.
It expressed its prejudices by hooting Read vigor;
ouslv if he did well. It hooted him if he did
nothing. It hooted him for being on the face of the
earth. On the other hand, Morey had only to wipe
his nose to cause the w 7 elkin to be split by bellow-
ing cheers. He was cheered when he sat down, he
was cheered when he stood ud, he was cheered when
he landed wallops, he was frantically cheered when
he failed. Once he hitched his pants and the roof
rose. This sort of insanitv calls for the appointment
of a number of kickers, clad in mail and armed with
metal boots. Apart from this unpleasantness the
fight was an interesting bout, fought in ding-dong
style. Read was as dogged as ever, and played his
own style of the game to perfection. His trouble
was that his style was not the sort to cope with
such an opponent, who was elusive—almost evanes-
cent, in fact—-and capable of hitting with equal
force with either hand. In plain English, Read was
up against a better boxer, and the rest was equal.
And, naturally, the extra quality of the Westralian’s
boxing won the fight. He was not always elusive,
however, and it _ was quite common for Read, ex-
pecting to see him fade out of reach in tantalising
stvle, to come with a fearful rush, only to find that
Morey was standing his ground and poking out an
unerring left to meet that rush. That sort of thing
hurt. Read landed some heaw body blows, but
Morey’s condition was just perfect; and, anyhow,
he managed to do the swin'rin'r-door act in most of
such occurrences. Yes, undoubtedly Morey was the
better boxer.
The large crowd at the Summers-Picato
fight in Sydney Stadium on Easter Monday night
saw a very hard-fought, heavy-punched battle come
to a sudden and almost sensational end. The sad-
eyed, handsome Americo-Italian lad proved a
tougher nut to crack than the hard-hitting Johnny
Summers expected. Not that Summers ever under-
rates anybody; but Picato is a borer of the most
virulent order, and he takes punishment like a
statue—just bores and bores and bores till the op-
portunity comes, and then.... crash ! On Monday
night he bored, and landed blow after blow that
shook Summers severely, and forced the gritty
little Englishman to provide special defence for his
midriff. All the time Summers landed repeatedly
on the American’s faoe and head. Picato merely
shook his top-piece and came on again. Summers
wisely backed away, and hit hard as he backed.
But there were times when the ropes prevented him
backing any further, and then there was awful
slogging. This happened in the third round, when
Picato banged and smashed so that for a moment
it looked as though Summers would go. But he
blocked and hung on, and got through. In the
fifth he came again in deadly style, using his left
with destructive effect. Picato still bored in, and
got nasty punches for doing it; but he went on bor-
ing and driving Summers backwards. The end
came in the middle of the 19th. Picato glided in,
and hit and hit. Summers was at last hurled
against the ropes. But, like Grenville, of the Re-
venge, he was full of sting. As he rebounded from
the ropes his left drive caught Picato fair on the
chin, and the smite was as the smite of a hammer.
Picato fell. At eight he rose, dazed- Summers
came like a whirlwind and heat him to the floor
once more; then the voice of Authoritv said,
“Stop!” and Summers had won his first fight of
the tour.
* * * *
As might have been expected, Les O’Don-
nell, the bull-dog, is far from satisfied with the end-
ing of his terrific scrap with Dave Smith. He de-
clares he was just picking up nicely, and beginning
to feel a warm glow of anticipation, having realised
that Smith had shot his bolt and the sting had left
his wallops. But for the police interference, he be-
lieves he would have won. Perhaps! But Tammy
Burns said the same after his scran with Johnson had
been stopped just in time to save him having his
head knocked clean over the gasometer outside the
Stadium. When we’re in good nick, we all feel that
the sledgehammers of the day before yesterday were
mere thistledown.
The last heard of Jim Barry, the man
who made the sudden exodus from the ring at Bris-
bane after Langford had placed one on his ribs, was
a letter from Lewisham Hospital to the well-known
sporting writer, W. F. Corbett. It was a rambling
letter in which the evanescent pug declares that “no
one knows how 1 have suffered.” He denies that he
fooled the public, but in the next line admits that
he was quite unfit to enter the ring, and wanted to
call the bout off, but was persuaded to go on. Then
he remarks that he may pull through with the help
of God, and that he only went into the ring because
he had an aged mother to support, and could will-
ingly do it on one leg when she requires cash —-pro-
vided, presumably, he got his money in advance. As
a letter writer Barry is worse than as a boxer, and
Heaven knows that’s about the limit. He doesn’t say
what is wrong with him —whether he has a broken
rib, or is trying the rest cure, or suffering from cold
feet. * * *
The two colored brethren, Samivel Lang-
ford and Samivel McVea, fought a 20-round mill at
Brisbane on Saturday night, and had a merry time
of it. It was not 'the gory affair that their last
meeting in Sydney was, when McVea literally dripped
blood all over the place, and every blow Langford
struck sent red spray over the disgusted pressmen.
In fact, for a while McVea held his own and made
thing's more or less lively for the sawn-off one, so
that at the finish the referee said it was a draw.
The Sydney-to-Melbourne Motor-Car Reli-
ability Non-stop Test has drawn 24 entrants —15
from N.S.W. and nine from Victoria. To the last
event of the kind, held in November, 1905, Victoria
sent 16 cars, N.S.W. but four, and South Aus.
three. It was a terribly drawn-out tussle. Only
four dropped out on the run to Sydney, and of the
other 19 no less than seven secured full points. A
further deciding run was held from Sydney to Med-
low and back, another 132 miles, and only one car
(N.S.W.) lost points, leaving six Victorians still
dead level. Then they ran back to Melbourne in
four stages. One car got smashed up and five re-
mained still dead level. They agreed to remain
level. They were W. R. Grimwade, W. B. Wilkin-
son, H. Tarrant, Syd Day and G. Hobbs.
The mixture supplied by the London
Coupe and Motor-cab Co. to its drivers at per
gallon was not benzol, after all, but a mixture of
paraffin and petrol, which it has discovered will yield
a mileage equal to that of petrol. A lot of engineers
are experimenting with a carburation device to pro-
perly vaporise kerosene, and so end the incessant
struggle with the petrol bill.

J. Bolger, of Wagga, who won the Dun-
lop gold watch by slipping across from Melbourne
to Sydney in 23hr. 41min., is to be, or has been by
this time, presented by his club with a gold badge.
The Sydney Bicycle and Motor Cycle Club is mighty
proud of Bolger’s performance, which certainly was
a great one, and it is a fine idea to institute a
sort of Order of Derring-do. If it is kept up, the
chances are the club will suddenly become famous.
It wilj *tso probably bury a few members; but that’s
all in the game—the motor-cycling game.

H. W. Nesbit, a well-known Victorian
racing cyclist, has taken on an easy task—the
lowering of old “Plugger Bill” Martin’s Australian
one hour motor-paced bicycle record. Bill put up
31 miles 1425 yards, which is quite antiquated.
The world’s best was put up by Guiernard (France)
at Munich, where the handsome Frenchman with the
ugly name ran 63 miles 255 yards in 1909.

Some German with a name quite impossi-
ble to spell, has been testing lubricating oil as
applied to motors and motor cycles. He was
anxious to eliminate the perfume, and discovered
that by adding a little aceton to the lubricant the
value of the oil was quite unimpaired, but when it
burned it emitted no odor. Probably the next mail
will bring particulars of the quantity to' be used,
and then we shall have no need to suffer the tor-
tures of the lost when our best friends waltz past
us in their car.

The march of the motor. Last week some-
one made an official count of the vehicles that
passed along St. Kilda-road during 24 hours. Horse-
drawn contraptions totalled 1500; motor-propelled
vehicles 1100. Of course, St. Kilda-road is the
best and most popular short run for cars around
Melbourne; so the figures are of very narrow appli-
cation. The proportion wouldn’t hold good on any
other track in the State.

Maoriland and N.S.W. Rugby Unions
having patched up their squabble, friendly visits
will be resumed in the coming winter. The Ma State
team will drop in on Maoriland in August, and
Maoriland will repay the call the following season.
Also, a Maori team has been handed permission to
assault the gate money to the uttermost at Sydney,
and will commence on June 2. It sounds like a frag-
ment of the sporting intelligence of the years agone.

When Orange meets Green on the football
field things are apt to become like a foretaste of
Sheol. On November 16 of last year Linfield met
Belfast Celtic in the presence of 10,000 spectators.
The barrackers did their share by firing revolvers in
the air and singing “Gor’ Save,” the “Wearin’ o’ the
Green” and other ditties. Several hundreds of police
patrolled the ground. Nothing more dangerous really
happened than the defeat of Belfast Celtic by four
goals to nil.

The few Victorians who stayed on in
Adelaide for the lawn tennis championships had a
profitable week. South Aps. is, like the Englishmen,
great in singles, but no good in doubles. R, V. Thomas
easily put out Wertheim (Vic.), and Justin O’Dea
licked Raws (Vie.), while none of them could ex-
tend Roy Taylor in the challenge round. Playing
together, however, Raws and Wertheim were well
ahead of Taylor and Thomas and all other pairs. The
superiority of Melbourne’s ladies made the Mixed
Doubles one-sided. Two Victorian pairs contested
the final, won by Wertheim and Miss Watson from
Raws and Mrs. McArthur. Miss Waxman won the
Ladies’ championship. A good volleyer, with a
variety of strokes—and incidentally very good look-
ing, and only 19-—-she should have a big" future.

There has been a slight alteration in Davis
Cup arrangements as far as Australia is concerned.
Wilding, now in England, has cabled that he won’t
he available so Horace Rice (N.S.W.) will make
the trip. Thus Ma supplies all the players. Rice
and Jones will leave by the Ventura on April 5 for
America, where the preliminary round is to be
fought. Doust, the third man, will be waiting for
them. While they are visiting Unc. Sam a series
of matches will be held against various Yankee
teams, with a vietv to fattening the association’s
purse. The big match is down for the middle of
June.
The inter-State bowls upheaval began
Sydney last Saturday, when N.S.W. inhospitably
feated its guests—Victoria by 120 to 79 and QuJnl‘
land by 101 to 87. Still, bowls i s a tramf -ir'.
which, like the Frenchman in Killaloo, one never
knows what they’ll be up to next; so it is au itp
possible that before the blow-out ends the other
Staters may reap a fearful revenge.
Champion swimmer Longworth’s monopolv
of State and club championships is growing so
stupendous that he will soon come under the opera
tion of the Anti-Trust law. Last week the 100
yards and the 440 yards of Eastern Suburbs (Syd-
ney) were thrown into his treasure chest; the ioo
yards in 58 l-ssec. and the 440 yards in sniin
58 3-ssec. Which are both worthy efforts.
* * * *
The bad old custom of filling-up the bookies
with fizz at the expense of the owner of a winning horse
was observed with special absurdity at the Victorian
Club the other Monday. Messrs. Baillieu, the owners
of Almissa, shouted the wine, but didn’t come along
to help drink it. A bookmaker, in proposing their
health, stated that “the members of the ring, as
a body, did not begrudge the Messrs. Baillieu 'their
victory,” which strikes one as a choice example of
the piffle talked on these occasions. Why, in the
name of almighty Odds, should the bo'oks begrudge
any particular owner a victory, except on the under-
standing that they would prefer every blessed horse
to get beaten? After this patronising announcement
of the ring's feelings, Mat Ellis responded on behalf
of the Baillieus, and proceeded to chant their praises.
Forgetting that he was merely their mouthpiece, and
not their advocate, he described them as “the best
sportsmen in Australia.” But why should any race-
horse owner —good, bad or indifferent—be expected
to pay a tax, in the form of costly liquor, on his
rare occasional winnings? The only people who
stand to win on every year’s transactions are the
books, who never, by anv chance, call the losing
owners together and invite them to drown their
sorrows in champagne.
The Australian Garrison (Sydney Divi-
sion) is nursing what looks like a world’s big-gun
record. A heaving target was towed out through
the Heads, and the quick-firers placed the whole
bundle of 21 shots into the object in lmin. 33sec.
Nothing like it has been done on this station be-
fore, and it proves that Australian gunners, given
the wherewithal, will prove ugly customers in a
big-gun scrap.
It cost Essendon £1678 to win the Vic.
League ’oofball premiership last season, though Col-
lingwood won it two years before on about half that
sum. The £1678 included players’ wages, £773
(over £2 per Saturday per man) ; trainers and
coach, £244; medical fees and sea baths, £164;
players’ refreshments, £95; insurance, £7O; testi-
monials and . wedding presents, £110; certificates,
medals, etc., £4B; uniforms and boots, £80;
allowances and holiday trips, £94. After that, it is
not surprising to learn that the committee finished
the season £52 in debt, expenditure being £2132
and receipts only £2OBO.

From the Liberal presentation of the case
against the Referenda, as put forward in
the pamphlet issued under authority:—
Momentous public issues are involved. This is
an appeal of citizens to fellow citizens, in their
common interests and tor the sake of Australia,
against the rash, reckless and unreasonable wreck-
ing of the Federal Constitution, which must result
unless the people’s answer is a resounding “No.”
One would think that the Labor party pro-
posed to chip something off the Fed-
eral power, instead of which it is pro-
posed to increase the powers of the Austra-
lian people—the verv people to whom this
fool-appeal is made. The Liberals are evi-
dently quite convinced that the pedple are
not to be trusted. Yet Joe Cook says he is
voing to call himself for the future a
Democrat.
“Scrutineer’s” grievance:—
Th e wages paid to election officials by the Home
Affairs Department are about the limit in clerical
sweating. The “day” (vide regulation 13) runs
trom 7 a.m. to 12 p.m.—an eight-hour day with
nine hours overtime. For this double day a door-
keeper gets 10s., or 7d. per hour. An ordinary poll-
hours) gets 15s. a scrutineering poll-
clerk (17 hours) gets a guinea, a presiding officer
two guineas, and an assistant returning-officer three
guineas.- A returning-officer gets 10s. per week for
routine work, and from £25 to £3O for the six to
eight weeks’ work involved, in an election. An
electoral registrar gets from £3, the minimum for
a 1000-voter poll, rising -by--steps of ss. for each ad-
ditional 100 voters, till the £l5 maximum is
reached. Keeping all the claims, removals, transfers
and alterations, checking, dating and acknowledging
same, and writing them into a 10,000 or 12.000
roll for £l5 per annum, is sweating of the most
gilt-spurred rooster character.

NE of the best proofs of R-C-H
value is the number of buyers
who heretofore have been
driving cars costing from £a°° to
And there’s a good reason for it. You
get in the R-C-H the utmost in comfort,
in looks and in strength. You get power
sufficient to take you and your family
wherever you want to go, and faster
than you’ll ever want to drive. You get
an economy of operation impossible in
the high-priced car. You get complete
equipment of the best quality. And you
save from £lOO to £2OO.
The easiest way to prove these things
is to let us demonstrate the R-C-H to
you. We’ll do it whenever you're ready.
And we’re perfectly willing to abide by
your judgment.

EMULSION
When a mother praises a U
remedy, it is an indication W
that remedy is good. But
when thousands and thou-
sands of mothers, year after
year, praise SCOTT’S Emul-
sion, it is PROOF that it is
quite unequalled as a remedy
for weakness and children’s
ailments.
Both children grew
strong on Scott’s.
“ My daughter was suffering with a
severe attack of whooping-cough, I
gave her Scott’s Emulsion and she is
now stronger and better than she has
ever been before.
My baby was very ill with bronchitis,
and nothing did him good until I gave
him Scott’s Emulsion. The bronchitis
has now disappeared and he is gaining
strength and vigor every day. ”
Edith Nicol, Hill Street, Leichardt,
Sydney, N. S. W. 16.6.11.
Imitations are not good enough
for you. Therefore, avoid risk of
error and disappointment. Ask for
SCOTT’S Emulsion and see the
Trade Mark on the package.

ANTINEURA6THIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Lech
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that . not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be

doesn’t fling promiscuous bricks at Private Enter-
prise. It doesn’t even throw promiscuous bricks at
combines. It believes, in fact, that a vast amount
of waste results from 30 bread-carts tearing along
one street to supply the residents thereof when the
job could be all done by one cart. But it realises
that, if one cart is given the job, the public must
be protected against exploitation by a monopolist.
That’s why it is keen on getting for the Common-
wealth power to deal with injurious trusts and com-
bines. The great thing is to get public necessities
and services supplied at the lowest possible price,
with fair pay to the men actually employed ; and,
so far as this paper is concerned, it is a secondary
matter whether the job is done by P.E. or the State.
....Fred F.: We’ve been looking for an epic on the
Founding of the City; and here it comes with the
blessed Bun: —
A weary wanderer seeking toil
Came strolling o’er the virgin soil
Of the newly christened city,
His throat was dry his feet were sore
He’d had no drink for hours before,
The sight would kindle pity,
But his hopes rose high though he was dry.
He came at last on the capital site
Where Gov. and Ministers had their skite,
And though consumed with a mighty thirst
His eyes grew bright and were like to burst
For bottles around him they lay thick
The sole remains of the christening trick ;
His smile grew calm and most serene
When he captured one, not a dead marine;
Says he to himself as he took a pull
A man need have no fear here
For though of water there’s not a drop
It seems a man Can-beer-ere.
. ...H.A.F.: This is a poor market for puns....
Gracchus: We don’t know. Ask Joe Cook. He
doesn’t know, either; but he will tell you.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
M.A.T.: As art it is unripe. As a jest it fell off
the tree- many seasons ago, and is no longer market-
able.
A Melbourne weekly makes the brilliant
suggestion that the influx of immigrants to
Australia should be increased a hundred-
fold, and maintained year by year. “Give
us immigrants enough and the rabbit plague
will soon disappear. These new-comers find
bunny very palatable.” And after the over-
whelming horde of workers have eaten the
rabbits they can. of course, return to their
old occupation of living on one another.
An assistant meteorologist at Melbourne
Observatory cut short his career the other
day under circumstances which reflect the
same old discredit on the teaching of sport-
ing melodrama, wherein the hero invariably
averts his impending ruin by backing the
winner for immense sums. The suicide,
who had two summonses weighing on his
mind, wrote to his wife: “Darling, I tried
to get the money, but could not, and as a
last resort went to the races, and, of course,
lost. I thought--you would be better off
without me. I am an absolute rotter.”
Apparently he was sape in all respects save
his estimate of himself. Absolute rotters
never commit suicide. They merely curse
their luck and live on.
“Southern Cross” lodges a complaint:—
It's about time that opposition was shown to
Jokook’s parrot-cry that Labor has introduced the
principle of spoils to the victors, that Labor Minis-
ters openly admitted that they ascertained the
political opinions of highly-placed officials before
they were appointed, that the first bold attempt at
the Americanisation of Australian politics had been
made by Labor, and so on. So far from this being
true, it is notorious that both Federal and State
Labor. Cabinets have had such bad attacks of the
timid feeling that 90 per cent, of all their big ap-
pointments have been given to Liberal officers, often
of the Toriest types. In fact, Labor has been almost
as resolute in placating and pushing Liberal place-
hunters as the most reckless of Liberal Governments.
What makes Jokook’s charge all the more
monstrous is that during all the riotous vears
of Liberal maladministration the system of spoils to
the victors flourished, to the almost total excluding
of even the ablest and most energetic civil servants
who happened to be even unaggressive Laborites. As
for the most capable officers who were militant
Laborites, they were turned down time after time.
“Kidette”: The Vic. Education Depart-
ment is losing a lot of its young male teach-
| ers, who are deserting to join either the
Commonwealth Service or some other branch
of the State Public Service. Over 50 p.c. of
the young fellows' who pass the junior teach-
ers’ exam, can, without extra cramming,
tmss the Public Service clerical exam. In
the Education Department a junior of from
17 to 20 gets for his first three years £4O,
£5O and £6O. provided he can pass his yearly
! exams. And they’re not trifling, so lie has
to study hard all the time. Then, when his
three years’ service is up. he can apply for
a sixth-class school at Lord-Knows-Where,
at a salary of £l2O a year. If, instead of
being so foolish, he gets into the general ser-
! vice, he starts £6O and rises by half-
yearly steps of £10; so at the end of three
years he is receiving £l2o—as much as he
would be eligible for if he were teaching.
And, meantime, he will hove received over £lOO
extra in salary. Moreover, the work is simple
'by comparison with trouser-dusting: promo-
tion is quicker; there ii no night study and
lesson preparations; .and he can mostly live
in civilised country. No wonder, then,
Frank Tate is short of males to fill his
worm-eaten little schools.

As the Michelin is the simplest in design, so it is unquestionably the safest

Body Covered in Red Rash. Much
Swollen, Could Not Rest at
Night. Used Cuticura Remedies
Ten Days, Completely Cured.
144 Moreland St., Footscray, Vic.—•
“ Last September I got a severe chill which
made mo very sick and all my body was
covered in a red rash and was much swollen.
The itching and burning were terrible, I
could not rest at night as the warmth
made it woi’so. I tried a lot of different
so called remedies, zinc ointment, boracic
and lots of other things before I received
the trial tin of Cuticura Ointment which
immediately gave mo great relief. I then
sent for another tin from the chemist, also
the Cuticura Pills and Cuticura Soap. I
used the Cuticura Soap and warm water
and then applied the Cuticura Ointment
for about ten days. I was then completely
cured and have not since had any return.’!

falling hair, and promote its growth and
beauty. Special directions for the treatment

are agreeable, effective, convenient and

An Interesting
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. xYllen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.
Dr. B. Allen’s (u.s.a.>

Walnut Stain
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,

Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell/ne that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
tormina . and suggested that-I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

The Inky Way.
There are few gold mines on the Inky Way. W. F.
Monypeny, a director and leader-writer of the Times,
and sometime editor of the Johannesburg Star
( £2OOO a year), left an estate worth only £175.
During the last few vears, Monypeny had been writ-
ing the life of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beacons-
field, and the second volume came out a few days
before his death. Another small will of interest to
inky-wayfarers is that of Emma Lavinia Hardy, wife
of Thomas Hardy, the novelist. She left only £2lB.
And that was above the average. Many writers only
leave the gas burning and the dog in the backyard.
It is a beautiful thing to help the widow and
comfort the fatherless; but there is nothing in it if
your trade competitor gets as much advt. out of it
as you do. The Sydney papers wept gallons of tears
over brave Captain Scott and poor Lady Scott, and
sent round the hat with enthusiasm to aid the relief
fund. And every day the S. M. Herald said what
its own fund came to, and the Gaud Mayor’s fund
and the Chamber of Commerce fund, and the fund
that is being raised in Britain; but never a word
did it mention of the rival Daily Tele-
graph’s fund, the Daily Telegraph being
a paper which, having no bowels of compassion,
could never, of course, be advertised as responsible
for a charitable fund. And morning by morning the
Daily Telegraph printed its list, and the Mayor’s
list and the various other lists —always, however,
excluding the S. M. Herald’s, lest that reptile con-
temporary should share a little of the limelight.
That, you see, is all to prove how the S. M. Herald
and Daily Telegraph really admire unselfishness,
and how utterly disinterested they were in pouring
out their gallons of hysterics and whooping up
public sympathy.

The Coolgardie Miner (W.A.) is undergoing
another editorial clean-up. This time “Bullant”
Mclntyre, of Southern Cross, is to go and guide the
destiny of the sheet. In the early days a man would
have "been laughed down in derision had he dared to
suggest that the day would come when it would
take the camp all its time to run a local rag. But
the old champagne town is down to beer, and rather
stale beer and not much of it at that. The new
proprietary is secretaried by Holman, M.L.A., who
was Minister for Railways in the previous Labor
Government.
“Quarter Single”: So many of the members of
the Victorian Ministry have been seeking new nests
lately, that the following announcement in the
Argus comes,,as no surprise:—-
“The State Cabinet yesterday decided to continue
the egg-laying competitions at Burnley.”
Alec Peacock will probably not compete. He may
be engaged merely to do the cackling.
* * * *
Howard Willoughby, the lovable, who has passed
from the Argus to the asphodel, had a habit of
stacking on the bookshelves, behind the editorial
chair, such volumes as were forwarded for the ten-
der mercies of the reviewers. One of the books,
having been dealt with, found its way back to the
shelf. It concerned the management of Sunday
schools, and the reviewer did not want to be in-
criminated by retaining it in his possession. Now,
there was a godly youth in the office, who was much
interested in Mothers’ Guilds, Leagues of the Cross,
Time and Talents Clubs, Reapers and Binders’
Unions, Gleaners’ Bands, and such. He laid eyes
upon the book, and the commandment about covet-
ing received a compound comminuted fracture.
When Willoughby arrived in the office, the youth,
much in the spirit of Imam Din, khitmutgar, wor-
shipfully soliciting the discarded polo ball from
the Heaven-born, in Kipling’s story, asked the editor
if he might have the book. “C-certainly,” said
Willoughby, with his gentle, stammer. “Y-you are.
I p-presume, g-greatly interested in these things?”
“Very much indeed, sir,” said the sad youth. “Ah,
well,” said Willoughby, as he handed over the book,
“d-don’t worry: y-youTl grow out of it —y’you’ll
g-grow out of it!”

“Rosna” (from London) : Australian writer and
traveller, Mary Gaunt, has packed up her typewriter
and best frock, and gone to call on China ; and here-
after a fat volume on the yellow-man’s acres be
confidently expected. On her way back she will pro-
bably take boat or aeroplane for the Northern Ter-
ritory, and write up her own country for a change.
* * * *
“Blinky”: I was assigned a stunt recently which
must be nearly the limit. An old Maori had died
at his pa ; he just died, and no one worried. It
was summer, which fact probably irritated the
corpse. The whites in the neighborhood heard the
corpse and began to feel suffocated. They drew the
attention of the authorities to the matter; hence
my trip, together with a health inspector. We
had absolutely no difficulty in locating Hori’s abode.
The inspector was provided with a large syringe
and a tin of formalin. - Fighting our way we
reached the door of the whare. Hereabouts _ the
heads of the tribe intruded and asked our business
in quite an unconcerned way. My friend consigned
them in toto to the place where Hori’s soul probably
was, and got his syringe to work on the whare. He
next telephoned to town for a zinc coffin to be ready
in five mihutes. Then the picnic began. He mus-
tered the tribe in the “big house,” produced another
tin of formalin from his trap and set to work. I
worked the pump, and he sprayed the inhabitants
from head to heel. Then the coffin arrived, but I
refused service when it came to transferring Hori
to it. I had had quite enough for one vear. The
inspector commissioned some of the lads to per-
form the ceremony, and they took to it with avidity.
It must have reminded them of dried shark.

“W.”: The Australian Journalists’ Association is
understood to be seriously considering whether it. is
anv longer wise to keen itself aloof from the common
herd of unions. Recent High Court decisions have
fractured the faith of the members in the Federal
Arbitration Court as a reliable shelter in stormv
times, and the ease with wh : ch some daily paper
proprietors manage to repudiate “honorable under-
standings” has made many of them wonder whether
the term “gentleman of the press” really means
much more than the euphemism “ladv-heln.” after
all. Amalgamation with the Typographical Society is
being clamored for by some bold pen-soldiers, while
the advocates of a newspaper employees’ federation
are more numerous than waterholes in the Cotter.
* * * *
I The linotype sometimes says what the sub-editor
dare not. Here’s a case. In a quotation from the
diarv of Lieutenant Campbell anent the Scott expe-
dition, the Age (15/2/’i2'i relates the pleasure of
the party -at finding a depot of nrovisions left behind
bv a previous crowd. In fact, the lieutenant frankly
admits that they took a “day off in honor of the
occasion”; and at'the end of •the’ dav they “fell
ldllarrppdpoarvailloss P shruddll hrdlu uunmhh
asleep” ! Sometimes people do say things like that
after a dav off.
♦ ♦ * *
“Digamma”: As an old pressman, anything that
Mark Twain said on the subject of craftsmanship is '
worthy of attention. The most valuable remark he
ever made was this: “As to the adjective—-when in
doubt, strike out!” The sure sign of an unsure
workman is his effort to attain effect bv piling ad:ec-
tive on adjective, especially in headings—“Shoriripg
Accident: Man’s Dreadful Injuries; Ssh l Fatal-
ity.” Headings like these are all too plentiful, and
in the instance given two lines are wasted on adiec-
tives that merely make the reader impatient. “Fatal
Injuries” tells the story—it leaves two lines avail-
able to tell how the accident happened. Restraint
is ten times as effective as splurge, and tragedy is
not rendered more impressive by being bello’wed. The
surest road to grandeur is simplicity. The sub-edi-
torial staff who issued the Authorised Version of the
Bible knew this, and with them the unnecessary
adiective would have had as much chance as a cellu-
loid cat chased bv an asbestos dog through Hell.
* * * *
The Yankee interviewer gets a good word at last.
“I consider the American m'' + t' o d,” says Clara Putt,
“much superior to the English. The average Eng-
lish reporter sits there waiting for you to say some-
thing, until you begin to feel as uncomfortable as
be looks. The American, on the contrary, nuts you
completely at your ease bv doing most of the talk-
ing himself, and all you have to do is to fill in the
conversation.”

STOCK SADDLE
£6 6s.
This Stock Saddle is by far the most
“Popular” throughout the Commonwealth,
because our Customers say so, and the Man
who has ridden hundreds of miles in one of
these saddles knows what he is talking about
when he says “That Uhl’s Stock Saddles
Can’t be Beaten for service and comfort.”
Built for real hard wear—hand sewn
throughout, sin. kneepad, on substantial tree,
extended facings and solid point to panel,
brass mountings (nickel if required), fitted
with girth, crupper, surcingle, 4-bar irons
and stirrup leathers.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
ntg
It has a hog-skin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
long flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron ’stirrups,'and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/- Mention of The
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained

IN
BANANA LAND
“A.E.D.” : Certain fruit merchants, backed
by the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, are
squeezing the Commonwealth Government in
an effort to get it to abolish the import duty
on: bananas, on the pretext that Queensland
cannot produce the fruit in quantity or
quality to supply the Australian trade.
Vefily the Little Australian dies hard.
There are thousands of acres in coastal
Queensland where the banana can be grown
to perfection ; and given a shipping service
equal to the Fijian, with reasonable protec-
tion against the fruit produced by Ram
Bagh and co., the output in the North, could
be trebled, and a decent living offered to a
considerable number of white settlers who
would soon embark in the industry and
sprint for the baby bonus in their spare
time. Under present conditions there is a
bare living for the battler. Abolish the
duty, and the plantations will soon be de-
serted, and a trade witb big possibilities in
it will pass to the foreign nigger.
Lawyer A. J. Thynne ,
M. L. C., Queensland.
At last the Queens-
land State Labor
Conference has fired
the insane “Stop-
page of State-aided
Immigration” plank
out of its fighting
... platform. On the
other hand, at the
A. W. U. Conference
in Sydney, it was re-
solved that this
meeting views with
disfavor the policy of
the N. S. W. State
Babor Government in
following the former
Conservative Govern-
ment’s policy of bring-
ing out free immi-
grants to co m. p e t e
with the bush-workers
of Australia.” And, to
a great extent, the
A.W.U. is boss of the
Australian Labor
movement. Inciden-
tally, the whole Labor
press condemns' the
dumping of immi-
grants into big towns
where they compete
with Australian arti-
sans, and the A.W.U.
says they’re not to be
thrown into the coun-
try to compete with
bush workers. In the
name of White Aus-
tralia, where are they
to be landed and sub-
sequently employed ?
The 13 superstition
was well-nigh dead in
Banahaland, but the
recent inquiry into the
Southern railway
smash may revive it.
The unlucky engine
concerned in the
trouble was known as
the “13 Down.”

A TARIFF MATTER
MRS. BUSH PUB (to travelling artist): “ An ’ 'ow many o' these pietors can
I 'ave for a shilling?"
ARTIST: "That depends, madam, on how many weeks board and lodgin g I
can have for a shilling .”
The' father of the Brisbane City Council,
sturdy John McMaster, has been a member
for 42 years. Things haven't improved
much since he became an alderman, so he
still feels at home. The city has no real
town hall, _ and no sewerage system; its
ferries are in a shocking condition, and its
so-called public baths are shuddersome in-
stitutions.
Rev. Hulton Sams, Bananaland’s boxing
parson, gets on splendidly with the rough-
and-ready bush blokes amongst whom he
labors. But he is heavily handicapped in
one respect. He has, of course, to be his
own choirmaster, and his singing voice is
poor, likewise his ear. Latterly, he was
holding an informal service at a wool scour,
and started his trustful congregation on a
hymn from an impossibly high note. They
struggled along chokingly for a few bars,
then cracked and trailed into an embar-
rassed silence. “That was started too ’igh!”
ventured one' chorister at last. Then a long,
slab-sided Australian who had shrieked his
best and failed, burst out indignantly, “Yers
too blanky ’igh alltergether!” And Sams
said not a reproachful word about profan-
ity, but started them off again from a lower
note, and all was peace and sacred melody.
“S.S.S.” from Far Up:—
, * n r t , hc ', Gul , f . ° f Carpentaria country the medicine-
ien ot the lvoko-niundi peoples are pastmasters at
the sorcery yclept, pointing the bone. The imple-
rnent used is pare of a man’s thigh support, topped
by a bolus composed of human kidney fat and hair.
The spirit of the original owner of these
articles is expectedto get busy with the
blabk magic as the occasion requires. Should
the bone be pointed in the direction of the
victim over running water it merely makes him
very sick or unhappy; when it is pointed over a
“ re ' • kills. I saw a -very old medicine-man put
01 ? e ' °f these uncanny instruments on the ground,
while .he squatted soma yards away and mumbled
incantations. With my own eyes I saw that bone
rise up and bow to the audience thrice. On two other
occasions 1 saw the same thing happen. I’ve seen
other weird performances in Papua. -We had a hos-
pital orderly boy who went mad one day, and,
clad only in his sie-hie, did cannibal dances and
howled a prophecy to the effect that the mail
steamer would arrive next day (it was a very un-
certain vessel to chance a prophecy on) ; that a fat
white medicine man would be a passenger consigned
to the hospital where he would raise plenty of
trouble, and that at a goldfield (500 miles away)
too'many men would “dead.” It all happened just
that way. The mail boat rolled up in the morning,
the fat doctor fulfilled his part in the prophecy of
the mad native, and about 600 boys died on the
fields as the result of an epidemic.
Captain Mackay, Queensland’s harbor
master, told the Pearling Commission that
“diving was no,work for a white man —it
was too cruel.” When asked if it wasn’t
equally cruel for the Papuan natives, he
replied: “The sea is the playground of the
natives.” Times seem to have changed. We
used to be told that the sea was the play-
ground, battlefield and general skittle-alley
of John Bull. Now, however, John is only
expected to play skittles when human life is
not at stake. When life is on the table, the
honor belongs to the noble black person
whom we are “protecting.”
YYjn de Wifi : “T. Catt,” arguing in
ayor of the boys of a secondary school
being allowed to take their compulsory drill
together (B. 6/3/’l3), mentions that the
school companies show a higher efficiency
than the others. This has been borne out in
the brigade tests in Queensland. Four com-
panies which had won the battalion compe-
titions fought it out, and finished this wav:

.port Higlj School, 594; Lismore A Com-
pany, 545 ; and W T arwick K Company, 409.
Andrew Fisher and Joe Cook, protagonist
and antagonist, milk and vinegar, had much
in common to begin with. Both started to
earn their living at a very early age.
Both took to Sunday-school attend-
ance, Sunday-school teaching and lay-preach-
ing. Both, crossing the seas to Australia
turned to mining, though Joe soon sought
the easy job of weigher. Both entered State
Parlmments as exponents of Labor ideals
Thereabouts divergences began. But in the
a pMC US - eS both b r ecame Ministers, Cook
tcLm, w a , n OE-Labor Government and
hisher as Works Minister in a Labor one
They entered the Federal House in 1901 as
directly hostile. And both will be Federal
Prime Ministers if Cook’s star looks up bu
it will be a very mad kind of star if it does.
Wmnholt, who is to run against Andrew
1 isher for Wide Bay, is evidently regarded
as the White Hope of the Liberals. At pre-

The Indooroopilly tennis club tournament
on Monday drew a fair number to Auchen-
flower. Jacky Radcliffe (the Youngest
player to shake an inter-State racquet for
Queensland) and his sister carried off the hi?
prize.
The races on St. Paddy’s Day didn’t
bring out anything extra-noticeable in the
way of frocks. Mrs. Cecil Palmer wore an
imported garment of black ninon. and the
other really smart woman on the lawn was
Mrs. .Eneas McDonnell, of Toowoomba?
who was a walking demonstration of the
uses of spongecloth and spotted ninon.
The argument about the meaning of the
word ‘Canberra” reminds me of a man who
used; to vow that he spoke every aboriginal
dialect in Queensland. Once, at the blacks’
camp at Myora, I heard an aged Binghi give
Ins free and candid opinion of the ambitious
linguist: “Missa Jones come down here, we
gammon we understand ; yabber vabber.’ We
make yabber yabber, he gammon he under-
stand.” And the whole dusky crowd roared
with laughter. The point of which is that
it is useless listening to the blather of a
nock of newspaper correspondents who
know almost as much about Binghi’s language
as they do about the stone-age language of
the Eskimo. The one man whose remarks
can be relied on concerning the meaning of
Canberra is Archibald Meston, Banana-
land’s tourist ambassador at Sydney. He
says the word means “young jackass.” For
myself, I can't say anything as to the
young, but I’m willing to risk a pair of
gloves about the jackass. There is a town-
ship north of Brisbane named Nanago, and
for long the alleged aborigine experts argued
as to the correct interpretation of the word.
All sorts of romantic suggestions were made,
until one day a well-known local native con-
fided that the word was the nearest black
brother could get to the pronunciation of
William Goat’s sister.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIAN JANE,
The alien hotel-help question is still alive
in the Far North. Lately a Church of Eng-
land parson stayed at an Irvinebank pub
which employs alien help. Next day he
received a letter telling him that if he stayed
there again his church would be “listed.”
Which reminds this paper to ask, again, how
soon the unions are going to “list” their own
members in western towns where the Chinese
are piling up fortunes out of the custom of
unionists’ wives.
The directors of the Sydney Ferry cos.
reached the top-note of even their impudence
on Monday. They apparently hadn’t done
a thing to provide the public with the service
they had taken money-in-advance for; and
when the Government started to get moder-
ately busy they proposed to lease the State
their boats, provided that the Government
undertook not to employ so much as one of
the men who had gone on strike. That
ought to open the eyes of Sydney to the
sort of men they are in whose hands the
public trusts the ferry traffic; and if the
public doesn't insist oh a change, it de- ,
serves all the inconvenience and fleecing it
will get in the future. For the co. itself to
refuse to employ any of the men would have
been bad enough ; that it should attempt to
pass the curse on to another party to whom
it proposed to merely charter its vessels was
too contemptible for words.

Take care of the Pennies so
that the Pounds can take
care of you
You lose money because your system does not show you
where every Penny comes from and where it goes.
It does not tell you how much you
should have! you take what you find —and guess
whether it is all your profit.
A National Cash Register will take care of
every penny you take in, and give you a complete record
of every transaction in your shop.
It will pay you to investigate this system at once and
see what it will do for you! Don’t delay

Theßoycl Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis, 1
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.
Milk Food No. I. From birth to 3 months
Milk Food No. 2. From 3to 6 months
Malted Food No. 3. From 6 months upwards
Th? ‘AllenburyV Ru*ks. A
valuable aduition to baby's dietary
wi.en ten months old and after These
Rusks are specially useful during the
troublesome time of teething. When
eaten raw they mechanically aid the

Are YOU
DEAF 4 ?
If you are deaf; or going deaf, ytfu Will t)fe glsld to
hear df a Simple add Scientific devibe which restores
hearing, no matter hdw old you arfe. .No try St cry of
Secrecy about it; we describe it lully, add explain
just hdw it acts. Yod use Spectacles as Sight rhagdi-
fiers, ahd itl the Same wav you use this sourid magni-
fier td hear better, Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Commoh-senSe EarDrdms are invisible add Cdmfort-
able. No one cad tell you are wearing theid. They
rest the eat nerves by taking the Strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistirict Soudds. What a
relief td have done with that tiring Strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
eveh when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
onfe ds jt lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys eVen the fairitest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being df the, softest rubber, it cannot '""-t the car.
Tt fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, i f
,vou have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
e<9
e?
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair, You will never
mjtet ti-ving the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. you mav wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you. wish. Children can wear them (we
have special Sizes lor children from six to twelve),
Even a child can insert attd remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £l (the fee for a doctors single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fihe nickel remoter, and also atl
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent von
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’.t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

He. lives his life who dreams his dream

Full overhead
-The sun was huge, a sullen clot of red.
The sun went out Beside a still lagoon
I saw her stand enamored. Never moon
Had poured that glory in her eyes, I swear-
Nor could the Seven Pleiades compare
With all the starlight squandered on her
hair.
I stood in wonder and as one enthralled
’The while she beckoned to me, called and
called
With such a voiceful silence, never sound
Was heard like it to make so rich a wound
Within a heart whose throbbings only sought
To cease upon the rapture that she wrought.
She beckoned to me but I could not move
Seeing her only by that still lagoon,
Too troubled at the tender gleam of love
That promised me so sumptuous a boon.
Alas for me! Alas! The vision fled.
Full overhead
The sun was huge, a sullen clot of red.
The sun went out Attired as a bride
Came one to meet me, riding down a plain
Of endless yellow sand. Her bridle rein
Hung idle by her, needing not to guide
The thing that bote her, with a spotted
hide
Like to a leopard’s and a lion’s mane.
Or what it was or who was- she or why
They came, I knew not, wishing but to die.
For verily was hunger in her mouth.
And verily, a fearful hate had she
And in its swollen tongue I read a drouth.
Licking those famished jaws so fearfully!
Nearer they came towards me, and their
breath
Scorched on my flesh as hurtled out of hell,
And I, who had not quailed to grapple
death,
Felt hope within me shudder at the spell.
Ah, well for me it was The vision fled.
Full overhead
The sun was huge, a sullen clot of red.
The sun went out Beneath the umber
shade
Of dark-green wattles, dropping globes of
gold
In scented largesse o’er her, sat a maid
To pain the eyes, so dazzlingly arrayed
In silvern garments was she, shot with gold
To match her crimson braided hair, un-
rolled
In golden billows o’er her swelling vest.
With rippled, girly laughter, she caressed
The heap of golden tokens at her side.
And taking tiny fistfuls, held them up
In both her hands, togethered as a cun
Laughing the more to see the spoilage glide
Between her fingers with a clinking rush
That startled all the silence of the bush.
But when she spied me, witness of her play,
Her laughter stayed to wreathe into a smile
Of sweetest welcome, knowing no dismay,
Bidding me dally at her side a while.
Alas for me! Alas!....The vision fled.
Full overhead
The sun was huge, a sullen clot of red.
The sun went out. . . .Was ever fairer grace
Than hers, who sprawled upon a poppied
lawn
In indolent delighting, all her face
Glowing with suppliance for a passion-
space?
Pink was her flesh as though a summer
dawn
Had joyed to make her nakedness divine
With rosy tinting; from her heavy lips
There came a sweetness that, whoever sips,
Is drunken with desire. Like a wine
That makes the blood in wanton tumult
flow
Througli all the veins, her eyes had magic
skill
To bring who looked upon them to her will,
And give them sweet carousal in the arms
That longed to bourgeon lovers with their
charms.
Alas for me ! Alas ! The vision fled.
Full overhead
The sun was hug#, a sullen clot of red.
The sun went 0ut.... A thunder tumult
crashed
Through all the heights of Heaven and the
glare
Of vivid lightnings yellowed all the air,
As, mounted on a coal black stallion, dashed
A maid whose eyes and golden tresses spilled
A glory on the darkness. Sword upheld,
She shouted and the thunders made reply,
As though exulting at her battle ery.
She shouted, and no other thing I sought

But follow, follow, follow in her wake,
And, gluttonous for slaughter, lull the ache
That pained me bitter for her wild eyes

Alas for me! Alas ! The vision fled.

The crimson-sided, thorn-crowned form of
Him
Who died for Ilis ideal in the dim
Grey mists of early legend. Softly on
Her kneeling grace the candelabras
streamed
A flood of golden glory, till it seemed
As though her urgent soul were peering
through
The body’s gaoling. Deeper, deeper grew
The ardors of her vision, till she made,
Whiles as her body in its raptus swayed,
The airs in waves pulse from her, over-
weighed , ,
With fumes of heavy incense, and her eyes
Glowed with a flame, so rich her ecstasies.
Alas for me! Alas! The vision fled.

BERNARD INGLEBY.
Parvey the Philosopher.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PARVEY was a small, thin, sallow,
wispy-bearded man who regarded
himself as a devil of a fellow amongst
women. The women and girls who dealt at
his little read.v-cash grocery shop in a Mel-
bourne suburb humored his harmless delu-
sion. As he passed them pounds of sugar
or tea, or pints of treacle or kerosene,
across the counter, he winked with amorous
facetiousness, and they replied with coy
smiles or eloquent nods. To them it was
merely fun, and, now and then, overweight
or good measure. To Parvey it was Glory.
Every night when he went home to Mrs.
Parvey—they lived in a private cottage uot
far from the shop—he told her of the con-
quests he had achieved during the day, and,
figuratively speaking, laid them at her feet.
His idea in doing so was to make her realise
the magnitude of her good fortune in having
all to herself such an irresistible Lothario
as he (Parvey) could be if he liked to let
himself go. Rut Mrs. Parvey knew the
amiable little braggart too well to be much
impressed by these stories. Sometimes,
however, she would affect to be furiously
jealous, and refuse to be placated until the’
secretly-delighted Parvey had bought her
another ring, or an expensive bangle, .or,
maybe, a gold necklet. In this way she
managed to acquire a considerable quantity
of jewellery—over £BO worth, in fact. It
was in the boom' time, and Parvey was
doing w r ell. He had married his ideal woman
and adored her.
Mrs. Parvey was a florid-complexioned,
full-figured, full-blooded, reddish-haired,
light-eyed female with a head like a cat.
Parvey was not her ideal man, although she
had married him. But he gave her plenty
of money to spend, dressed her well, and
was her slave in all Things. Consequently
she despised him. He had, at times, a dim
suspicion of this, but his vanity always
brushed the doubt aside. “Julia knows when
she’s well off,” he used to say to himself on
such occasions. This was true enough in
the main. Julia Parvey was no fool. But
almost always, to a woman of her tempera-
ment, a day comes when passion strangles
judgment. And then curious things are
liable to happen.
When this day of days came to Julia
Parvey, she opened to it as a rose opens to
the sun.
• Bovis was the very antithesis of Parvey.
He (Bovis) was a thick-set, bull-necked
young butcher, with curly hair and a sen-
sual mouth. He was understood to be in a
good way of business, though he had not
been long in the suburb. It was impossible
for a woman liae Julia Parvey—who began
to deal at his shop—to look with cold in-
difference on this superb male animal, over-
flowing with vitality as vigorous as her
own. As for Bovis, he fell in love with his
handsome customer the first time he saw
her. It was a case of mutual swift attrac-
tion of red blood-corpuscles, In affairs of
the heart of this sort the march is rapid.
One day in taking change from Bovis Mrs.
Parvey absent-mindedly left her plump
bediamonded hand in his for a moment. He
boldly squeezed it. She glanced at him re-
proachfully. He laughed. They understood
each other.
Bovis became so infatuated as to be in-
cautious and compromising. He wrote
letters to her. Now any Christian reader
who has ever engaged in an amorous in-
trigue knows that it is fatal folly to set
down hot, passionate words, or even warm
terms of endearment, in black ink on cold
white paper. But Bovis was nothing to
boast of as a Christian, and, even if he had
been, was too much in love to count conse-
quences. Mrs. Parvey found it necessary
to remonstrate with him. He heard her
out, and answered (in a masterful way that
completely conquered her heart.) “Now
look here, Julia. I sold out my business this
week, and the money’s in the bank. Are
you willing to leave Parvey and come with
me to some other colony where we can be
happy together?” After some pretence at
hesitation she consented. It was arranged
that they should elope on the following
Saturday. , . ,
“I shall not come empty-handed to you,
Dick, dear,” she said. I shall have my
jewellery at any rate.”
“D —n your jewellery! I want you,
said Dick.
Then Parvey made a discovery. It was
not much of a discovery, but quite enough
to invest him with tragic interest in Ins
own eyes. He walked quickly into the
room, where his wife was, and stood glar-
ing a’t her, without speaking, for a moment
or two. He felt himself to be master of the
situation, and the sensation was so novel
as to be almost enjoyable. His wife knew
at once that he had found her out, and, in
a flash of inspiration, decided upon her plan
of action. . . T ,
“You have been deceiving me, Julia, he
said when his voice came to him ;
“You don’t mean to say so? she replied
lightly. , ...
“I S ay you have been deceiving me—

On FARM, SHEEP-RUN,
and CATTLE-STATION*
Zam-Buk is Invaluable.
The true value of Zam-Buk is nowhere
more readily recognised and highly
appreciated than among the busy toilers
on farms, sheep and cattle stations and
outback selections,
where the workers —
who are, as a rule,
fifty, one-hundred or
t w o-h und r e d-miles from
medical assistance —need a
balm with soothing and
healing properties, combined
with the power of cleansing
and “sweetening” wounds,
and preventing “ gathering,”
festering, inflammation,
poisoning and disease, such
as Zam-Buk ONLY is.

It maybe at the plough; in the workshop; while splitting fenrino-
branding, or shearing ; or in the homestead itself-the hands receive na
cuts and burns, and the body and legs painful bruises and abrasions whirl',
require the immediate soothing, healing antiseptic and germicidal powers
of Zam Buk to prevent any tendency to festering or poisoning, and ensure
prompt and perfect healing, thus enabling the worker to continue his
work without inconvenience, or loss of time and money.
Ex-Station-Manager's Praise.
Mr. W. G. Paine, ex-manager of Wandovale Cattle-station, Queensland and
residing at Baker Street, Charters Towers, (Q.j, has proved the value of Zam’-Buk—and
incidentally the wisdom of always having a pot handy-for a deep wound caused through
being horned by a bull, and writes '“ Some two years ago I was manager on Wandnv*£

Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those yrtio reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

“ I have been a resident of Rockhampton since the year
1866, and of late years have been a sufferer from Indigestion.
To make a long story short I gave myself up as done with this
world when I happened to take up the “ Daily Record,” in
which I read of the cure for my complaint—Chamberlain’s
Tablets. lat once got a bottle and started on them, and
before I had half finished it I felt as if I could eat and enjoy
my food, which I could not do before. You may wonder how
I lived. I used to live on crushed biscuits until I started taking
that wonderful medicine—Chamberlain’s Tablets.”
MRS. M. A. HAWKE, yEast Street, Rockhampton, Q-
shamefully,” he repeated in a louder tone.
“Parvey, you’re mad, or you’ve been
drinking,” said the offended Lucrece.
“Am I? Have I?” he exclaimed angrily.
And drawing his right hand from behind
his back, in which position he had kept it
till then, he showed her a fragment of a
letter. She took it carelessly, glanced at it,
read “Darling Julia —my own dear love,”
and handed it back with a laugh. Her
levity made him furious. “What man dared
write that to you?” die almost yelled.
“One of my admirers,” she replied, still
laughing. “What about it?”
“ ‘What about it!’ she says,” he cried.
“Why you barefaced, brazen”
His wife put up her hand —she could have
knocked him down with the back of it if she
had liked —and the word he was about to
use died on his tongue. Her time had come
to speak.
“You!” she said slowly and scornfully.
“You to talk to me in this fashion, after
pestering me for years past with stories of
your carryings-on with strange women!”
“But you know there was nothing in
them —it was only harmless fun,” remarked
Parvey, suddenly reduced to acting on the
defensive. It was a horrible wrench to his
vanity to make this admission, but it had to
be done. He might have spared himself, for
all the good it did him. Mrs. Parvey cast
a withering glance upon him. “Only harm-
less fun? You would have me believe, then,
that you were telling me nothing all the
time hut paltry, miserable lies? And you
call yourself a man! Bah!”
The wretched Parvey found himself com-
pelled to choose between the horns of his
own self-constructed dilemma. But first he
tried to take a position between them.
“No, I don’t mean that,” he said. “At
least, not in the way you”
“I should think not,” burst in his wife
with splendidly-simulated rage. “You are
not the kind of man to stop at half-measures
where women are concerned. Parvey, you
are, by your own confession, a profligate—
a wicked rake —and yet you accuse me —-
me —after I have put up with your infi-
delities for years, and said nothing! But”
(taking a step forward and speaking with
slow, sneering emphasis) “I give you fair
warning—as you’ve given me the name, I’ll
have the game.”
Parvey went away a prey to confused
and conflicting feelings. He felt mean, yet,
at the same time curiously proud. The
wretched little animal was actually flattered
by the knowledge that his wife regarded
his innocent over-the-counter flirtations as
serious liaisons.
“She called me a wicked rake,” he
chuckled to himself several times during the
afternoon.
Mrs. Parvey, after he had gone, threw
herself into an easy chair and laughed till
the tears ran down her cheeks.
“It seems almost a shame to deceive such
a simpleton,” she murmured, when her
laughing fit was over.
* * * *
Parvey was, however, not quite as great
a simpleton as his wife took him to be. He
knew, partly by intuition and partly through
certain observations he had made, that she
was preening her wings for flight, and de-
cided to cut those wings as close as he could
when the time came. It was not long in
coming.
When he came home for lunch on the
following Saturday he entered the conjugal
bedroom to look for something, and noticed
signs of packing as for a speedy journey.
“It’s to be to-night, then,” he muttered.
“Very well!” He opened the drawer in
which Mrs. Parvey kept her jewellery, and
found it (the jewellery) done up in a neat
parcel. He slipped the parcel in his pocket,
went in to his lunch, ate it, and returned to
the shop without a word.
Bovis —who had been watching him from
the window of an hotel across the street —
rushed over to make Mrs. Parvey hurry up
with her arrangements. That conscien-
tious matron, however, informed him that
she couldn’t think of clearing out until she
had cooked the dinner for the following day.
“I may be going to act badly by Parvey,”
she said ; “but I’m not going to be so bad
as to leave the poor man without his Sun-
day’s dinner.” And she was thoroughly
serious. Bovis fumed to no purpose. “Men
don’t understand how a woman feels about
these things,” she observed.
However, the dinner was cooked at last,
rrand then, with a clear conscience, Mrs. Par-
vey dressed herself for her journey towards
the Unknown. When she was nearly ready
„to start she went to her drawer to get her
jewellery. The drawer was, of course, empty.
She realised in an instant what had hap-
pened.
“The mean scoundrel!” she exclaimed,
grinding her strong white teeth.
A few minutes afterwards she was in her
husband’s shop. A number of women were
standing at the counter waiting to be, or
being, served. Parvey was, as usual, ex-
changing winks and jests with them. Yet
he must know that she was about to leave
him! The callous brute! She tugged at
her wedding ring until it came off her finger.
Then, stepping forward swiftly, she cried,
“As you’ve taken so much, you can take
this.” And she flung the ring in his face.
It retjounded and fell on the floor. Parvey
picked it up quietly, placed it in his vest
pocket, and continued serving his customers.
That night when he went home he found
the house empty—as he expected it would
be.
“Julia’s gone, right enough,” he solilo-
quised dismally. Then, after a minute or
two spent in reflection, he said, almost cheer-
fully, “Well —there are others.”
This was Parvey’s first start as a philo-
sopher. And the irony of it was that it was
suggested by his wife affecting to regard him
as a Don Juan. Her flight had another
effect. It caused him to sell out of his busi-
ness. He felt that he was no longer in a
position to indulge in gay badinage with his
lady customers. He knew that they would
pretend to sympathise with him, and that
would be more than he could stand. So he
left the suburb, and, a week afterwards, was
once more making conquests of the sex
from behind the counter of a branch estab-
lishment of the City and Suburban Supply
Co.
• • • •
Bovis and his Julia went to Sydney.
When she told him the story of the im-
pounded jewellery he laughed boisterously,
and said that Parvey was a smarter man
than he had taken him to be.
They went everywhere and saw every-
thing, and, for a time, Julia enjoyed herself
to the full capacity of her sensuous nature.
Yet there was a fly in her ointment. Bovis
was willing enough to spend money upon
her, but he would give her none to spend on
her own account. She taxed him with this
on one occasion, and he replied with a coarse
laugh, “You don’t suppose I’m such a fool
as to give you the chance of clearin’ out with
some other fellow, do you? Not with my
money, you don’t.” Then he laughed again
and kissed her, but she was not pleased with
him.
Bovis, though a fine animal, had the de-
fects of his good points. When drunk (which
was his condition now and then) he was in-
clined to be brutal. Once he gave her a
black eye—a dangerous experiment to try
upon a woman with such a cranial conforma-
tion.
One day, after they had been in Sydney
about six months, the innate vulgarity of his
nature broke out in a hideously disillusionis-
ing fashion. He had been to the races, and
returned sour-mnd with bad liquor and bad
luck. It was a luxury to have Julia to spit
his spite upon.
“I’m d—d near dead broke,” he snarled,
throwing himself into a chair; “and you—
you (unprintable epithet) are the cause of
it.”
Recriminations followed fast and furious,
and Julia received her second black eye.
Next morning Bovis was repentant, and
apologetic. Julia answered with words of
forgiveness ; though her swollen face and the
thin straight line of her lips, which at other
times looked like a rosy double-bow, might
have made him doubt the genuineness of her
speech. But Bovis did not understand
women. _ If he could have seen what was
passing in Julia’s brain just then, he would
never more have gone to sleep under the
same roof with her, in the sure hope that he
would awake with a sound throat in the
morning.
He went out again that day, and returned
in an amiable humor.
“Got a letter from my brother,” he ob-
served.
“Yes,” said Julia, not raising her eyes
from some garment she was making.
“Yes, and he tells me there’s a good billet
open for me in Bendigo. So pack up and
we’ll go to Melbourne by next boat.”
They went by the next boat.
Bovis left Julia with her mother —-an old
lady who was singularly free from the pre-
judices of her sex and aae. “I shall only be
six months up in Bendigo.” he said, “and
then I’ll come back and make another start
in Melbourne. You take this” —handing
Julia £3O in bank-notes —“and furnish a cot-
tage. I dessav I shall be able to run down
two or three times and see how you’re gettin’
on.”
Julia, with a strange smile on her lips,
took thp money and placed it in the bosom
of her dress.
Some mornings afterwards, while dressing
in her bedroom, she heard a familiar voice.
“It’s Purvey.” she murmured. Should she go
out and meet him and have the trouble over?
She was a bold woman, but she bad tact
enough to know that her best policy, in the
circumstances, was not audacity.
She opened her door quickly, and then
started back, as if in amazement at seeing
Parvey in the room. But he had come pre-
pared for the meeting.
“It’s all right, Julia,” he said pleasantly,
“you needn’t run away. I'm willing to let
bygones be bygones if you are.”
He looked so clean, so sober, so nice and
considerate, and, in a word, so un-Bovis-like,
that Julia burst into tears —real, unsimu-
lated tears.
“Don’t cry!” he exclaimed, adding, by way
of philosophic consolation, “It’s no good cry-
ing over spilt milk.”
This made her laugh—hysterically. Then
she cried again.
“The past need make no difference,” said
Parvey. the Philosopher. “See. here is your
ring,” he continued, slipping it back to its
old place on her finger. “I keot it for you.
I knew you’d come back some time or other.”
It would be nrofanity to pry upon the
affpeting reconciliation that followed.
Parvey, before leaving, told his wife that
as soon as she was ready he would take her
to Albury, where there was a grocery busi-
ness in which he had a share, with the option
of buying out the whole concern at a cheap
price. He thought it would be a good in-
vestment.
“Here’s £3O towards the purchase, dear,”
said Julia, taking Bovis’s money from a
drawer arid handing it to her husband, who
took it without a blush.
“I reckon he owes me that much, anyhow,”
was all the comment he made.
* * * *
On the morning following, Julia received
a letter from Bovis, stating that he was
coming to Melbourne that day on business,
and asking her to meet him at the station in
the afternoon when the Bendigo train
arrived. She sent for her husband and
showed him the letter. “We’d better go to
Albury by the express this evening: I don’t
want to have any trouble,” said the pacific
Parvey.
They were at the station at 4.30 p.m. to
make sure of not missing the train.
“I’ll _go in advance and prospect—Bovis
may still be there waiting for you,” remarked
Parvey.
Bovis was . there—walking up and down
the platform in what appeared to be a state
of extreme irritation.
Parvey told his wife what he had observed.
He mustn’t see us. Surely he won’t stay
much longer?” she exclaimed, nervously
Parvey was also nervous. Their flight to-
gether began to appear like an illicit clandes-
tine elopement. Meanwhile, Parvey took two
first-class tickets for Albury.
Just as the express came in Bovis went
into the refreshment-room.
Parvey and his wife seized the opportunity
to dive into a carriage, into the furthest cor-
ner of which they cowered, quaking guiltily.
Bovis reappeared on the platform, arid
strolled along, glancing carelessly into the
carriages, as if to kill time. But, although
he peered into the very compartment in
which they were sitting, he did not recognise
them.
As the express steamed out of the station
the escaping pair looked into each other’s
eyes and breathed a long sigh of relief.
Bovis stood gazing listlessly after the
disappearing train, and then muttering, “It’s
no use waiting any longer—she must' have
had some other business on hand,” he turned
on his heel and left the platform.
