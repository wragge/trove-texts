ONE MORE
WEEK
ONE MAN, ONE-PLUS VOTE
THE DEPRESSING thing about the
South Australia elections was not that
Uncle Tom Playford had gerryman-
dered the , electorate, but the numbers
of people' who had come to believe
this was only right and proper.
“If Labor were to take a sincere non-
party attitude toward this question they
would grant that an ex-Digger who
30 years ago took up a soldier settle-
ment block in a remote country area
and by sheer hard work and courage
made a success of it would be entitled
to a little more say as to who was
going to run our country than, say,
a New Australian drink waiter with two
years’ residence in the Enfield elec-
torate; I mean in no way by making
this comparison to cast any aspersions
on New Australians or drink waiters,”
ran a letter in the Adelaide “Adver-
tiser.” That may not be democracy, but
that’s South Australia.
GLOOMY EQUATION
“THE CIVIL AID program just isn’t
achieving much in Vietnam. All the
medical teams in the country are able
to do in a year could be achieved just
Alister Brass...in the thick of it
as well by stopping the war for one
day.”
This is the gloomy equation Dr.
Alister Brass brought back to Australia
with him last year after five weeks in
Vietnam gathering material for the
“Australian Medical Journal.” He has
since expanded these articles into a
book, “Bleeding Earth,” just published
by Heinemann.
“Civil aid just doesn’t seem to get
there somehow,” he said. “And I think
when the war’s all over, it won’t be
seen as having played a great part in
it. Civil aid will be effective only when
the war has been stopped. Imagine all
the work that goes into mending a
shattered leg, then put that up against
the fact that one bomb can wipe out
a whole village. And who knows how
many people don’t get to the hospitals.
“The pacification projects miss out,
too, for a variety of reasons. The Aus-
tralians have done a lot to help the
villagers of Hoa Long. But Australian
soldiers still get sniped at, because
families of the Viet Cong live there
and they’re never going to be friends.
Lie says that one of his objectives in
making the trip was clarification of
some of his more muddled feelings
about the war, but rather than clarifi-
cation, proximity sometimes meant con-
fusion. “I had fairly definite ideas be-
fore I went, but when I got there
I found how easy it is to be definite
when you’re in the privileged position
of being so far away. In the thick of
it, it’s hard to make up your mind.
I’m thinking now about a man I met
there—the outspoken editor of a Saigon
newspaper which was shut down be-
cause he published a photograph the
Government didn’t approve of.
“He was bitter, but if the Com-
munist regime had been in power, I
dare say this man would have been just
as outspoken against it. And at least
he still had his personal freedom under
the South Vietnamese Government.”
Dr. Brass, the son of journalist Doug-
las Brass, was born in Melbourne, read
Medicine at Oxford, spent time in the
United States on an Exchange Scholar-
ship, and worked in Gibraltar before
returning to Australia five years ago.
He originally planned to stay only for
a year, working at the Royal Alexandra
Hospital for Children, but he has been
here ever since.
His work in the wards of the Chil-
dren’s Hospital and hl» trip to Vietnam
have influenced him against the prac-
ticality of bringing Vietnamese children
here, either for treatment or adoption.
“I don’t think any child would be
happy in a strange hospital in a strange
environment. I think people should try
to help them in Vietnam, rather than
somewhere else. There are the excep-
tions, of course. If there’s an injured
child—and just no one to treat him
where he is, then you can’t deny him
treatment—here, in the U.S., or in
Britain. But as a general rule, I think
the best idea is to fly in plastic surgeons
to Vietnam for, say, two months, have
them treat people while they’re there,
and perhaps teach other doctors some-
thing of what they know so they can
continue their work after they’re gone.
“I’m against adoption, because a child
can sit in a hospital for weeks in Viet-
nam without a sign of any of his rela-
tives, then his mother or aunt or some-
one will turn up, after searching for him
all that time.
“Also, I think it’s almost impossible
to bring up a child in a strange country,
to pluck him from his own environment
into an entirely different one. With a
baby, it might be justified, but I sus-
pect the motives of some people who
want to adopt Vietnamese children.
Often they’re prompted by guilt over
Australian involvement in the war.”
SHORT SIGHT
THE DECISION of Vaucluse House
Trust not to allow the house to be used
for a few days by a film unit making
“It Takes All Kinds” in Sydney seems
particularly idiotic, but then the Trus-
tees may in recent months have lost
some confidence in themselves and their
decision-making.
When the National Parks and Wild
Life Act was proclaimed last year, the
Trustees of Vaucluse House made
strong claims for exemption. One letter
to the papers on their behalf spoke of
the “careful authentic detail” of their
work. Before you could say William
Charles Wentworth, letters began com-
ing in pointing out errors in dating and

attribution of pieces in the house and
also complaining about the despoliation
of the surrounding park.
Vaucluse House is of almost no
architectural importance and of only
moderate historic interest. Once the
National Trust finishes its work on
Old Government House, Parramatta,
dating from 1798 and the home of
Governors from Hunter to Fitzroy,
it will palpably be of less.
Vaucluse House is simply a minor
tourist attraction, but it happens to be
in a city which makes nothing of
better buildings of real historic inter-
est, such as the Hyde Park barracks.
The Trustees would not allow the
film unit there because it would have
meant excluding the public. Some of
these are on organised tours and could
have been rerouted without difficulty.
The film company, as rent for the two
days, could have been asked to pay
for Press advertisements notifying that
the house would be closed.
The Trustees of Vaucluse House
are unhappy about being brought under
the control of the Minister for Lands,
but there seems a good case for giving
the Minister for Tourist Activities
some say over the running of places
which may attract tourists. And if the
Minister for Tourist Activities cannot
see the value in having Vaucluse House
and other parts of Sydney used for a
film for international distribution, as
compared with minute notices in buses
saying “Visit Historic Vaucluse House,”
then we are all wasting our time.
LESS THAN HEROIC
THOMAS KENEALLY’S novel
“Bring Larks and Heroes” has been
received with something less than
enthusiasm by London reviewers.
Emigre Robert Hughes reviewed it
for the “Sunday Times,” so that
hardly counts. The “Observer” reviewer
found it “pretentious,” but said that
“Mr. Keneally’s often fine style shows
signs of having learnt much from
Patrick White, but it also reveals an
individual talent of distinct promise.”
However, David Halliwell really
pulled it apart in the “Spectator.”
The book, he says, is unreadable.
“This novel,” he writes, “first published
in Australia, comes to us with a fanfare
from its native critics: Thomas Keneally
has been hailed as ‘Australia’s most
individual stylist since Patrick White.’
“A stylist he most certainly is. He is
all style. Perhaps this is wise of him,
since his material seems to consist of
little but platitudes. A platitude is a
platitude is a platitude until it’s been
tricked up to become a profundity. Mr.
Keneally applies his style to every obvi-
ous idea and commonplace event in
sight until they become almost incom-
prehensible. Almost, because if you
want to play detective you can still dis-
cern the dreary old bones.
“The style itself is awkward, dis-
jointed, and lacking in rhythms. Mr.
Keneally beats up a phrase until it dies
of dislocation. This is why the book is
so tiresome to read. Style does not con-
sist in applying arbitrary contortions to
what would otherwise be straight-
forward. Genuine style is the true mani-
festation of the material. Ideally, it is
the only manifestation possible. Manner
and matter are one. But when, as in
‘Brings Larks and Heroes,’ there is only
manner, we are left with nothing that
matters at all.”
All this, we are sure, will not per-
turb, or even surprise, Mr. Keneally,
who will go on developing his talents
without help from critics, whether fav-
orable or not. However, it may disturb
some of those who have praised Mr.
Keneally fairly extravagantly here. We
shall be watching for signs of doubt or
discomfiture in their ranks and also
for shifts in course.
FAMILY SHOW
ONE MOMENT last week we were
blanching under the full impact of the
art-violence syndrome with almost
simultaneous previews of “Bonnie and
Clyde” and “In Cold Blood,” the next
we were discussing the enduring popu-
larity of Viennese operettas.
Marcel Lamy, the 64-year-old direc-
tor of Paris’ largest theatre, the
Theatre Chatelet, is here with three
French singers, 300 costumes, and nine
tons of scenery to stage “Waltzes of
Vienna” at the St. Kilda Palais
Theatre, Melbourne, and later at the
Tivoli, Sydney.
He arrived in Sydney on one of the
mornings Warren Beatty, the star of
"Bonnie and Clyde,” should have, there-
by casting himself in the unfortunate
role of consolation prize. But despite
the fact that he doesn’t speak English,
he overcame both handicaps with a
certain Gallic vivacity and the help of
entrepreneur James Laurie, who acted
as interpreter.
Via Mr. Laurie, Mr. Lamy said
that the Chatelet had been serving its
patrons an unvarying diet of operetta
for the past 40 years and their appe-
tites weren’t flagging yet. In fact, most
of Europe’s opera houses devoted three-
quarters of the year to operettas, leav-
ing a scant three months for opera.
Mr. Lamy is here for five weeks,
and doesn’t seem to be worried about
problems at the Chatelet during his
absence. It is currently showing “The
Prince of Madrid,” a production which
has already carried out more than 400
performances and is securely ensconced
until September. “Waltzes of Vienna,”
first performed in Vienna in 1930, has
since done a sterling 2000 perform-
ances, but has not been staged for the
past five years.
Apart from the conductor and the
three stars — Nicole Broisson, Anne-
Marie Sanial, and Andre Jobin — the
90 members of cast and orchestra will
be Australian, with ballerina Kathy
Gorham doing the choreography. A
family show, Mr. Lamy calls it, which,
after all, is something that can’t be said
for “Bennie and Clyde.”

Headache cure
Gives long-lasting relief from nervous disorders caused by congestion of the
business communications system.
The best way to get rid of a headache is
to eliminate the underlying cause. The
STC Pentaconta Pushbutton PABX does
just that for businesses suffering from the
strains created by slow, outdated tele-
phony. Pentaconta, the most advanced
business telephone system there is, puts
automation to work in the office, elimi-
nating the bottlenecks that slower systems
produce. Pentaconta also simplifies
switchboard operation, makes a good
impression on people, and helps a busi-
ness achieve a new level of overall
operating efficiency.
Big claims? But the STC Pentaconta is a
big step forward in telephony. If you are
accustomed to one of the older systems
you'll be surprised to discover what
advanced features are now available. For
example, in Pentaconta-equipped busi-
nesses it is no longer necessary to call the
operator to transfer a call to another
extension. An outside caller can, in fact,
arrange to be connected to a series of
extensions in sequence. His call will be
automatically re-directed to the operator
each time a conversation is terminated.
There are enough features to fill a book.
Ask us and we'll send you the book the
brochure on the Pentaconta, that is. The
Pentaconta comes in line capacities to
suit all businesses. Ask us to tell you more
about it and what it could do for you.

Ever been caught
by a boom ?
's
V
There has never been a time in Australia’s history when people have
been as wine conscious as they are now.
But the great upsurge in interest, coupled with a dry year, have created
shortages of many of the best wines Australia produces.
One of the things about a boom, when the goods are in short supply,
is that standards can slip.
Orlando’s standards will not slip.
For years, in anticipation, we have been thinking ahead - planting new
areas and new varieties, developing and exploring new techniques and
equipment - and we will continue to do so.
But even so, current demand has outstripped us.
If you find difficulty on occasion in obtaining your chosen Orlando
table wines, we hope you will remember that while we would like to take
advantage of the boom, we are utterly convinced that it is more
important to preserve the quality that has achieved such high
recognition of our wines at home and abroad.

Even grannies
can learn —with
$100 and guts
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THE ONLY PERSON doing the talk-
ing at the first meeting of the Inter-
national Stunt School in Sydney is its
principal, 28-year-old actor Barry
Hayes, who, without buck teeth and
sideburns, is a blurred version of Max
Bygraves. Mr. Hayes is sitting in his
office and stuffing $lO notes in his
pocket, scribbling receipts for Ken and
Frank, a couple of tractor-drivers who
are enrolling tonight, and saying sweetie
it costs every bit of $lOO to put ’em
through the course, what with the high
cost of premises and everything, martial
arts alone costs $l5 an hour, sweetie,
yeah there’s $ll extra for Equity, but
say, what d’you think of the school,
will it go, what do’you think, eh?
Well, when sweetie arrives, the place
is filling up on the first floor with men
in a variety of leisurewear with hair-
styles to match, and they’re sprawling
around this hot reception room, with
its purple leatherette stackables, in all
kinds of Jimmy Cagney postures. There
is a handful of women who stare down
into their laps. And what they’re doing
here is getting to know one another
and their instructors before meeting up
again the following night for the first
of the 12 2-hour lessons, which is set-
ting them back this $lOO plus, and
which they all hope will open the door
into that glamorous, lucrative business
of film-making. The one that is said to
be happening in Australia.
A more immediate door opens and
out walks, for heaven’s sake, Beth
Churchill, dressed in purple. No, she’s
not stunts, she says, she’s television
course. From Mr. Hayes’ office there
is the sound of crisis. He has lost Ron.
Where is he? He was here. No, he was
there. Where the thank God, he’s
here. The television course sashays out
on a cloud of Chanel No. 5 and these
aspiring stuntsmen look up with a
what-the-hell’s-happening expression in
their eyes. “OK, boys,” says Mr.
Hayes, “you go in and give the ladies
a hand with their chairs.”
So here everyone sits in a state of
quivering anticipation and the princi-
pal says OK now, everybody, just relax
and be informal. Now, in case every-
one’s wondering what women are doing
here tonight, well, it takes guts, real

guts, to do a thing like this and these
ladies have guts. There’s Hazel over
there with her daughter, and Mrs.
er he can’t remember her name,
sitting with her husband. Hazel is a
grandmother, he adds. How do you
do, Hazel? Hazel, who is 55 and runs
a children’s dress shop in Mount
Druitt, jogs up and says how do you
do and giggles. Now, Mr. Hayes wants
to know where are his instructors, you
know, where are they? He is referring
to fencing instructor Roland with the
Laughing Cavalier set who walks in
with his assistant, Steve. It is the first
time, says Roland, they have actually
taught. And ah here’s Ron Ben-
nett, Mr. Hayes’ chief instructor, who
is martial arts. Well, you could say
he’s gonna teach the art of falling.
Now, the next thing, says Mr.
Hayes, is suggested clothing: oh, jeans
or T-shirts, Hazel could wear a pair
of slacks or something. Oh, don’t worry,
everybody, we’ve got beautiful mats to
break the fall. They shoud be beautiful,
they cost $l5O each. Incidentally, to be
serious for a moment, if anyone does
hurt themselves the school cannot be
held responsible. The way they look at
it is, everyone volunteers to come into
this, you know, of their own accord; so
it’s up to students to look after their
own bodies. He is, however, thinking
of starting a scheme whereby for 25
cents a week students can insure them-
selves, he’s got a friend in insurance.
What is vital is for everyone to get
photographs taken for identity cards so’s
Joe Blows cannot step in and pass them-
selves off as them. They’re a bit like
that in this business. Mr. Hayes knows .
Actually, what he envisages is getting
200 stunt people on the books. He hopes
to get them known in China, Hong
Kong, Singapore, world-wide in fact,
that’s why it’s called International, see?
And he wants them to know as long as
they work hard for him he will work
hard for them, but he’s not in this just
for the money, he says, he wants to help
the Australian film industry.
A proportion of students seem mes-
merised by the sound of Mr. Hayes’
voice. He jerks them up with a small
item of news about the film “It Takes
All Kinds,” for which, unfortunately,
there is now no call for'their services,
but he has heard, only today, that the
next 12 Goldsworthy productions are
his, and then there will be many calls.
Meanwhile, a lady from the yoga
school is coming down tomorrow. Roma
Blair. Or her representative. To teach
them to relax. Not that Mr. Hayes
won’t be tense tomorrow; he always is
just before working. He was, in fact,
the other night on TV. Did anyone see
him on Friday? Hazel did? Oh good.
Did she enjoy it? Oh good.
Afterwards Hazel wonders if she’s
doing the right thing getting involved
with this. Ah, well, she says, it’ll be
different.
... Sweetie, what can Hazel do? Oh,
she’ll be good for brawl scenes . . .
D you wanna take my picture? asks
Mr. Hayes.

All well bibbed
and
bibbing well
AT FIRST one felt a little self-
conscious in a bib. Immediately on arri-
val at the Rutherglen wine festival, one
had to buy this green plastic bib. It
had a pocket - in the front to hold the
souvenir wine glass. Some wore their
bibs around their necks, some wore
them slung low around the hips so
that they flapped like a loin cloth,
but it was a brilliant idea. It vvas like
being a cowboy equipped with his six-
shooter, a man was always equipped,
night and day. There wasn’t always
lime to wash it, and after three days
of festival the glass had a permanent
stain of red crust, which could be
described as the red crust of courage.
Last week it was the beer festival,
this week it was the wine festival at
Rutherglen. You will be getting the
idea that your pioneer is permanently-
addicted to the demon, but please
understand that this arduous labor was
undertaken with only an altruistic de-
sire. to serve the community.
It was hardly a time for being fes-
tive. The district has been savagely
hit by drought and frost. The vintage
this year will be down at least 75
percent, so much so that the commit-
tee had to abandon the grape-picking
contest. There were not enough grapes.
Then there were many who felt it
unwise to hold a second wine festival
only within 12 months of the first.
Would anyone be interested?
Dear reader, sometimes the citizens
might get bored with rose, begonia,
jacaranda, hyacinth, and petunia fes-
tivals, but their warm-hearted, simple
interest in wine festivals is unflagging.
The crowds descended on Rutherglen.
Nothing quite like it had been seen
since the gold rush. It was impossible
to get accommodation within a range
of 50 miles. The president of the fes-
tival, George Sutherland-Smith, jun.,
thought they had catered well with
7000 bibs and glasses: they went on
the first day. He rushed in anothcr
desperate emergency order of 1000
glasses, which came on the Saturday,
and when they arrived it was like the
relief of Mafeking, but even these were
far from sufficient.
Rutherglen was most attractively-
decorated for the occasion. There were
vine leaves trailed around the dear
old veranda posts up and down the
main street. The shops dutifully dis-
played bottles of wine in their win-
dows. The electrical shop had a bottle
of Seppelts burgundy sitting on top
of the stereo. The hardware store had
Morris’ Cream Sherry in among
the hammers, spanners, and Spread
Satin paint. The hairdresser had Geh-
rig’s White Port among the curls, and
the fish and chip shop had a bottle
of Morris’ Old Tawny Port nestling
with mussels, pickled onions, scallops,
and fish. The combination was novel.
The only shop that was undecorated,
the only shop that kept itself pure
from the demon, was the TAB.
On the Friday there were balls at
Rutherglen and Corowa. Among the
wines served were the 1962 Brown’s
Cabernet - Shiraz - Mondeuse from
Milawa, and the All Saints Cabernet-
Shiraz of 1966, finishing with a very
old Morris’ Muscat. As said earlier the
crowds descended, particularly young
people. The streets were thick with
MGs, Sprites, and veteran Austin-
Healeys. Mr. Sutherland-Smith led the
dancing in the streets, and at times
there was a Haight-Ashbury atmos-
phere with people wandering about in
bare feet. One of the most vivid sights
was a lady sitting by the wheel of a
truck drinking wine out of a bottle
through a straw.
On the Saturday morning there was
a wine auction out in the open out-
side Seppelts. Mr. Douglas Seabrook,
the wine judge, commented on the
bottles before they went under the
hammer, so to speak. The prices weren’t
quite as wild as last year, but there were
some interesting items. Dozens of Mil-
dara Coonawarra Cabernet-Shiraz,
1964 and 1963 fetched $4B each, and
their 1967 Coonawarra Riesling went
for $4O.
The best price was $65 for a single
•bottle of Dawson’s 1935 Whittle’s
Claret, the last of the vintage before
that vineyard went under the plough,
“Dry wines are very popular this year
it’s the drought, you know!”

and Mr. Seabrook, with a haunting sad-
ness in his eyes, described it as a superb,
beautiful wine, as good as anything
that came out of France.
There was a smorgasbord lunch for
500 in the Memorial Hall and they
could have sold tickets for 1000. It
was lovely, all the wines of the district
were on show, and, nicely bibbed, one
could wend one’s way back and forth
and around the products of Messrs.
Bailey, Gehrig, Smith, Brown and what
have you. There was an all-female
orchestra on the stage which sleepily
played strains of “Li’l Ole Wine
Drinker Me.”
During the afternoon it was said to
be most gay. There was a float parade
with lots of marvellous floats depicting
wine, but alas one cannot give a report.
Your correspondent was resting, girding
his loins for further efforts that night.
You must understand that 'Victorian
Parliament passed a special Act so
that various licensing arrangements
could be made at the festival. So the
sports ground and Lake Moodemere
became very nice licensing areas.
On the Saturday night we had the
starlight barbecue at the sports ground.
Over 5000 paid to get in, but great
enthusiasm was displayed. Citizens were
snicking under hedges, scaling fences,
swinging like Tarzan from trees, and
it could safely be estimated that by
9.30 p.m. 10,000 were starlighting at
the barbecue.
The entire ground was a solid,
breathing, festive mass. There were
hay bales to sit upon and the entire
atmosphere was wine. Even the Egg
Board was handing out wine recipes.
One showed how to brighten breakfast
with scrambled eggs, mixed with three-
quarters of a cup of white wine.
You may well ask how they got wine
to such a vast crowd. The efficiency
was something to see. They had a
series of booths, the wine was in ten-
gallon stainless-steel barrels. Then to
each barrel was an air pump, a plastic
hose, and pluto tap. It takes a little
time to get used to having your wine
served from a pluto tap, biit as long
as they keep playing “Li’l Ole Wine
Drinker Me” you get used to the idea.
The special licence ran out at 10.45
p.m. and by that time it was a scene
of true Bacchanalian beauty. The next
morning was infinitely more peaceful
with a wine seminar in the Memorial
Hall. Papers were given by George
Sutherland-Smith, sen., of Rutherglen,
and John Brown, of Milawa. At one
stage there was a knock on the door
and a timid character asked: “Please,
is this a church meeting?” The
festivities continued for another two
days. At one vineyard 2000 people
went through in one day with the
citizens in the noonday sun working
their way from the gentle rieslings to
the heavy artillery muscats.
Upon leaving the area one received
a car sticker: “WE SURVIVED THE
RUTHERGLEN WINE FESTIVAL—
DID YOU?’’ It was a matter for some
debate.

way to do it. This is our "T.C.” mpdel. It’s
almost identical to its brother, but hotter.
For an optional extra $2OO, you get a 19%

The currency crisis
a change of era
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
IT IS NOT possible to underestimate
the seriousness of the present world
monetary crisis. We may now be in one
of those periods of history when a con-
ventional system, that has worked well
and in which there was universal con-
fidence, is about to break down. History
suggests to us that such a disintegration
will be followed by some other system,
but that the transition is more likely
to be painful than not, and that to the
participants in such a crisis the “solu-
tions” are not always immediately
obvious.
There is no final logic in how the
world finances its trade. A system that
works may have absurdities that affront
the reason of those who put forward
more rationally devised schemes. But
if a system works, that doesn’t matter.
What matters in world trade is that
some efficient system of bookkeeping
should be combined with a sense of
confidence. The world’s bookkeeping
has never been better. But the sense
of confidence may now be eroding so
quickly that the present system will
stop working.
There is no single villain in this
drama. There is no point in singling
out Britain’s long and debilitating series
of sterling crises, or de Gaulle’s obses-
sion with gold, or the decisions of indi-
vidual speculators. These are, them-
selves, symptoms of the disease rather
than its cause, although they have, each
of them, worsened the general condi-
tion.
The weaknesses of sterling have been
due not only to a number of individual
acts of British mismanagement but also
to the fact that sterling, which per-
formed the role of financing a third
of the world’s trade, was an essential
part in a piece of machinery that was
beginning to work badly. The first signs
of this occurred in the 19505, when
almost every year the British gained
more money in selling goods and ser-
vices to the world than they spent in
buying goods and services from the
world, yet there were still successive
sterling crises. And that hitherto un-
imaginable phenomenon “the dollar
crisis” had begun to appear.
The 1950 s were not without prophets
of new systems of international finance.
Mr. Harold Macmillan, for instance,
privately saw it as the principal prob-
lem of British Governments and one of
the world’s main concerns, but his
Treasury and his Chancellors of the
Exchequer didn’t seem to come up with
anything. Nor, if they had, would it
necessarily have worked.
It seems likely that in the 1960 s the
weakness of sterling has been both a
victim of changing responses to inter-
national finance and a precipitant of
new changes. Unlike the 19505, the
1960 s revealed basic weaknesses in
British industrial strength. The British
were beginning to import more of the
very kinds of goods they tried to sell,
and in exports their growth was least
in those new areas in which other
exporters of manufactured goods were
growing fastest. At the same time Mr.
Wilson seemed incapable of restoring
confidence. Even so, although the weak-
ness of sterling made things worse, its
main contribution was probably to make
them worse more quickly. Things were
probably going to get worse anyway.
In the same way President de
Gaulle’s policy has speeded up a trend
that wise observers have seen coming
for many years. Even the speculators
did not do the killing. They are merely
the vultures and jackals, in for what
they can grab from the feast. Nobody
killed the present system. It is not dead.
It is weak and unprotective. The scav-
engers are feeding off it while it is still
alive, thereby hastening its dissolution.
In looking at the immediate future
one cannot be either precise or optimis-
tic. Even the French must now have
some doubts about their gamble on gold.
If President Johnson could just put
up the price of gold overnight, and if
there could be a co-ordinated response
from the other trading countries, the
French could make their point. But an
American President cannot put up the
gold price without Congressional appro-
val, and, even if Congress was in a
panic, this would probably take time. In
that time there could be a serious dis-
location in world monetary movements
and perhaps in world trade. But even if
de Gaulle’s ambition is fulfilled, why
would uncertainties cease? If the price
of gold can go up once, it can go up
again. We might end up behind where
we started.
The greatest danger is that a number
of nations might take individual actions
in the British style, attempting instant
deflations. If America did this, its de-
flation would deflate the world. The
lesson must now be clear enough that
the great trading nations are locked to-
gether in an indissoluble embrace of
self-interest in which to seize a momen-
tary advantage by hitting someone else
is to hit oneself. Creditor nations have
as great a responsibility as debtor
nations to find quickly a way of con-
tinuing the finance of world trade. In
fact, theirs is the greater responsibility:
it is easier for them to restore equilib-
rium than the debtor nations and per-
haps only they can do it. One hopes
that the closer we approach possible
disaster the more likely it is that
national prejudice will be overcome.
Now let the torture
inquiry rest
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
UNDERSTANDABLE EMOTION
surrounded last week’s discussion of
the Vietnamese woman captive mal-
treated while under Australian interro-
gation in .Vietnam in 1966. Many
parliamentarians are ex-soldiers with
war memories. Others like Sir
Wilfred Kent Hughes (Liberal, Vic.)
and Tom Uren (Labor, N.S.W.) were
themselves wartime POWs exposed to
Japanese brutality.
It was in this atmosphere that Oppo-
sition Leader Gough Whitlam, himself
ex-RAAF, charged Prime Minister John
Gorton, also ex-RAAF, with breaching
his belief that “Governments ought
never seek to .suppress news or infor-
ication whether those Governments feel
it is for the moment to their advantage
to do it or not to their advantage.”
A dispassionate examination of what
actually happened confirms that what-
ever might be said against the handling
of the affair by the Army Department
the Government in the final analysis
took not only the proper but probably
the only course open to it.
The sequence of events was this: Mr.
Martin Russ, an American author,
alleged that a Vietnamese woman cap-
tured with a radio had been subjected
to maltreatment by her Australian
interrogators.
Lynch, a new Minister obviously ill-
informed by his Department, denied
Russ’ allegations
Mr j ohn s'orreH, a Melbourne
journalist, then publicly stated that he
ha.d witnessed the maltreatment and
identified himself as Russ’ informant.
With disagreement on the accuracy
of the allegations, the open inquiry that
Gorton was then predisposed to favor
was appropriate.
But then came a development,
The documents covering an inquiry
held in the field a week after the ind-
dent took place were received in Can-
berra and placed before Cabinet,
These documents, as Lynch told the
Parliament, confirmed that Sorrell’s
version of what had happened was
“substantially true.” This changed the
situation entirely. There was no dis-
pute on the facts—they were admitted
—and, therefore, there was no reason
for an inquiry.
Long before political pressure and
publicity had developed, the Army, act-
ing independently, had demonstrated

HAY FEVER
Up till now, to get relief from an attack, you used a drug of some sort; no doubt you
have been doing that for many years and you'll continue doing it if you don't use
Membrosus. You wonder what this Membrosus is? Well, it's a dry inhalant, completely
different in every way from all other treatments. There are no drugs and you don't use
it just to get relief from an attack when it comes. Instead, you inhale regularly every
morning and evening whether you have an attack or not it takes about five minutes.
What happens? You'll find the attacks will become less severe and less frequent, and
after a while no attacks at all. That can happen even though you have had the
complaint for many years and you have despaired of ever getting worthwhile relief.
Here's what one happy user says: "Yesterday I got up without coughing the first time
for fourteen years. Four months ago it took me an average of 35 minutes to walk from
the station to my work . . . not a great distance either, and I was always knocked up
and short of breath. Someone told me about Membrosus, the DRY INHALANT TREATMENT.
I tried it as I have tried a dozen other things, hoping for relief. Imagine my surprise and
intense joy when, after a short period, I felt a definite relief. And when the other morning
I got up without coughing the first time in fourteen years, I began to look at life
anew. Now I walk to my job comfortably in seven minutes, smoking my pipe and suffer
no discomfort. Now there is no coughing, no tight bound-up feeling. I am able to lie
down and sleep at night without the nightmare of an attack and enjoy meals without any
ill-effects".

There is also a special Membrosus treatment for Catarrh , Sinus
and Antrum Trouble.
that it would not condone such condu*,.
by holding ,an inquiry and removing
the man involved from interrogation
work.
The only thing that could be cavilled
at was whether a reprimand and the
removal to other duties of the service-
man who had shown lack of self-control
in the interrogation of prisoners repre-
sented sufficiently stern action.
As I understand it, Cabinet was
issued an instruction that all future
cases involving wrongful treatment of
prisoners be referred to the Army
Minister and to Army headquarters in
Canberra.
This means that future penalties will
be fixed by detached persons sitting in
safety thousands of miles away—
concerned with such things as mainten-
ance of Australians’ international image,
of the terms of the Geneva Convention,
and of the necessity for upholding
standards of international behaviour
that would not provide a justification
for enemy reprisals against captured
Australian servicemen.
Whether the punishment was ade-
quate may be a matter of debate.
Uren produced a very proper thought
—that prisoners in Australian hands
should be protected not only by the
Geneva Convention but by the fact
that Australia is a civilised nation.
But though he was undoubtedly
speaking against the background of his
own wartime POW experiences, I
thought he overemphasised when he
described the Australian interrogator as
a “sadist.”
A solitary incident of that kind, in
such circumstances and after a man
has lost mates and believes he is trying
to save mates, does not justify him
being described as a sadist. It merely
shows that he lacks the self-control to
deal with prisoners in certain circum-
stances, and this the Army recognised
by transferring him to other duties.
Personally, I do not believe that
Labor has thought through the conse-
quences that would flow if at this stage
it forced an inquiry into events which
nobody now disputes happened.
Such an inquiry would force dis-
closure of the name of the man
involved.
The man is presumably a professional
soldier. He may serve overseas again.
He might fall into enemy hands. While
Uren and others might argue with some
justification that the Army should have
done more than just transfer him,
nobody could possibly argue that his
punishment should be left to an enemy.
The Government with its instruction
that all future cases involving mal-
treatment of prisoners should be re-
ferred to Canberra, where factors other
than a man’s simple and human desire
to save the lives of mates will be
weighed, creates a new situation which
as far as is humanly possible should
prevent a recurrence of an event that
could affect the welfare of Australian
POWs in enemy hands.
It is on that basis that, in my view.
Labor should let the matter rest.

AUSTRALIA
In the Labor benches you
couldn’t hear the possums stir
DESPITE FORECASTS of a Whitlam
offensive when Parliament resumed last
week, the Labor Opposition dis-
appointed its supporters among the
Press commentators with its slow and
cautious challenges to the Government.
Only a few front-bench Labor men
got to their feet to ask questions of
Ministers. Many obvious questions were
left unasked —so much so that on
Thursday, the third sitting day, new
Education Minister Malcolm Fraser,
answering a question on university re-
search money put up by one of his back-
bench colleagues (and accused of rig-
ging it as a “Dorothy-Dixer”), com-
mented that he had waited two days
for the Opposition to ask the question.
He didn’t want his prepared answer to
go to waste.
Apart from referring to the Speaker
as the President and calling Honorable
Members Honorable Senators, Mr. Gor-
ton acquitted himself well in the de-
manding job of leading the Govern-
ment on the floor of the House. As he
told the Party meeting before the
session began, he intended to take the
offensive. Rather than simply answer
Opposition charges, he would take
every opportunity to seize them and
throw them back as counter-charges
against the Opposition.
As part of this policy, Mr. Whitlam’s
suggestion that the Viet Cong girl-spy
be brought to Australia to give evidence
in the inquiry on her treatment was
mercilessly ridiculed and compared to
Dr. Evatt’s letter to Molotov at the
time of the Petrov affair.
Mr. Whitlam’s aides, charged that
the ALP wasn’t stirring any possums,
gave the reply that these were still early
days. The Opposition wants to see what
Mr. Gorton is like. If, as they tenta-
tively claim, he is a man who tends to
proclaim policy on his feet, then they
will try to draw as many statements
out of him as possible hoping to profit
by his boldness and bluntness. However,
some Labor men (especially in the
Senate) fear that Mr. Gorton may out-
manoeuvre Mr. Whitlam by his tough,
head-on offensives.
Labor claimed that they had started
two hares last week. One was in getting
Trade Minister McEwen to admit he
had not abandoned his scheme for an
Australian Industries Development Cor-
poration, which on the advice of the
Treasury was rejected by Cabinet last
year. The second was in drawing out of
Mr. Gorton a confusing statement on
the future of troop commitments to
Vietnam.
They did not claim success in the
Viet Cong girl-spy case. While they
have rather halfheartedly maintained
their call for an open inquiry, they are
privately admitting that the Govern-
ment, by coming clean on the substan-
tial truth of allegations of maltreat-
ment, stole their thunder.
Labor’s tactics will be two-pronged,
as indicated by their preliminary prob-
ing last week. They will try to exploit
to the maximum obvious divisions
within the Government, the chief of
which is that between the coalition
partners, especially between Mr.
McEwen and Mr. McMahon, but with
secondary divisions occasionally appear-
ing as recently between Mr. Bury and
Mr. McMahon. The other prong will
prick at Mr. Gorton in the hope that
he will make a statement of policy
which he is later forced to change.
Mr. Whitlam’s supporters hope that
they can firm the Party on to their
Leaders’ latest Vietnam pronounce-
ments. Dr. Cairns, who at Monash
University said he, personally, would
like Australian troops pulled out of
Vietnam immediately, is himself being
pulled out of his advance position back
into line with Mr. Whitlam’s policy
that Australian troops should be kept
and used as a lever to get the Ameri-
cans to change the emphasis of the war.
Have veteran Left-wingers like Tom
Uren, Clyde Cameron, Sam Cohen, and
Lionel Murphy been sold on this new
soft line of Whitlam’s? There is some
evidence that they have. In the Parlia-
mentary Labor Party only Mr. Arthur
Calwell, the old possum-stirrer himself,
appears likely to challenge Mr. Whit-
lam openly. He may become isolated.
Mr. Whitlam and his supporters have
been privately displaying the prospects
of office to their followers. Their line
is that the Senate elections show that
Labor could attain power in 1969 if it
walks down the Whitlam middle road
on foreign policy. They say it would
not be impossible to win the DLP vote
Parliament’s resumption last week, scene of the offensive-that-never-happened


Army Minister Lynch...no inquiry
to their side. The hard core of the
DLP rank and file have been alarmed
by Mr. Gorton’s recent statements
suggesting a downgrading in priority
for defence and they are puzzled by
Mr. Whitlam’s more realistic line on
South-East Asia. DLP leaders for their
part are worried whether they will be
able to discipline preferences if Gorton,
moving left, meets Whitlam moving
right.
Bowing to these and other pressures,
Mr. Gorton last week moved back a
little out from the impasse of his
January statement that no more troops
would ever be sent to Vietnam. In
answer to Dr. Cairns he said he had
meant that no more troops would be
sent as a result of the Viet Cong TET
offensive. He could never be held to
say what his Government’s policy would
be in future.
Another strand of Labor strategy
might be to mount an attack on an
alleged isolationist tone in some of
the recent statements on Government
foreign policy, in particular to look for
any belittlement of Australia’s potential
role in the South-East Asia region.
The Whitlamites are now developing a
genuine enthusiasm for what Australia
can do in co-operation with various
South-East Asian countries, which are
no longer written off as nothing but
corrupt military dictatorships.
Benefit funds
Independrent check
WHEN HIS FELLOW parliamen-
tarians were canvassing support for him
as a successor to the late Mr. Holt,
they said of John Gorton that he would
be very quick to spike Opposition criti-
cism of Government policies. He is
starting to show this quality.
The Governor-GeneraTs speech open-
ing Parliament announced: “It is pro-
posed to arrange for an independent
inquiry to be held into the operations
of the Hospital and Medical Insurance
Funds which provide benefits under
the (National Health) Scheme.” This
is mainly in response to several lightly
reported speeches in which Mr. Whit-
lam criticised the funds.
Mr. Whitlam has said: “Australia
has too many health-insurance funds.
Many of them compete with one
another through lavish advertising cam-
paigns. They erect prestige office
buildings on costly city sites. They
purchase and operate executive aero-
planes. Between 1952 and 1966, the
operating costs averaged between 13
and 15 percent (to U.S. and Canadian
costs of seven and eight percent). The
Commonwealth Government sets a
ceiling on operating costs of the funds,
but one-third of them regularly ignore
that ceiling.” He also accused the
Funds of accumulating excessive
reserves and said some of the smaller
ones should be forced out of business.
Health Minister Dr. Forbes wants the
independent inquiry for his own reasons.
Such a great deal of criticism of vary-
ing reliability has now been floated by
so many different people that he thinks
an independent inquiry will throw use-
ful light on the real situation. Un-
doubtedly he is being assured by his
Department, which is responsible for
the licensing and policing the opera-
tional guidelines of the funds, that all
is well. An independent check is always
helpful to a Minister.
The Government thinks the inquiry
will show that many of Mr. Whitlam’s
criticisms are unsound. Its own surveys
show that many of the tiny funds which
Mr. Whitlam thinks uneconomic are, in
fact, very well managed. In many cases,
small company staff funds give sub-
scribers excellent benefits since adminis-
trative overheads can be carried by the
firm. But the Government expects that
some of the large funds, especially two
in N.S.W., will be exposed as suffering
from the bureaucratic inefficiencies of
giantism. It hopes that the inquiry will
come up with constructive suggestions
on the scales of benefits, reserve policy,
and administrative procedures. Com-
puterised data-processing is obviously
one way of achieving economies.
Quite separately from this, the Gov-
ernment will be doing three other things
in the area of social welfare. Health
Minister Forbes is said to be hopeful
of major progress in this area with the
new Prime Minister, and will most
likely be arguing for enlarged levels of
Commonwealth assistance to the Benefit
Funds, independently of the inquiry.
The Government will soon introduce
its proposals for helping chronically ill
people. This involves a complex scheme
of enlarged Commonwealth contribu-
tions to hospital bills for the chronically
ill, and a Commonwealth-States joint
scheme for nursing homes.
Also, of interest to Social Services
Minister Wentworth, Mr. Gorton
announced that he is negotiating with
the States an agreement for sharing the
cost of benefits for deserted or separated
wives in need but ineligible for Com-
monwealth benefits. (A six-month
period of separation has to elapse.)
This involves ticklish problems of
negotation with State Governments.
N.S.W., S.A., and Queensland each
have existing schemes and the Com-
monwealth proposals will probably save
them money. On the other hand, Vic-
toria has none and Sir Henry is
reluctant to give to the scheme.
Social S ervices Minister Wentworth ... sharing the costs


Defence
Plans coming up
Defence Minister Fairhall and Mrs. Fairhall when their son returned from Vietnam
FOR THE FIRST time since the
defence build-up was initiated by Sir
Robert Menzies in 1964, the Australian
Armed Services are to be without the
guidance of a long-range plan. The
present three-year plan ends on June
30, and from then on their expansion
will be without the framework pro-
vided by long-range targets. As late
as November last year it was hoped to
be able to initiate a new three-year
defence plan on July 1 this year, but
the Government has now abandoned
the effort.
Present thinking is that the three-
year plan will be postponed 12
months. The Government wants to
settle the details of its contribution to
Malaysia-Singapore defence before it
launches out on the new plan. So it
wants to see through the five-power
talks in May in Kuala Lumpur and
hopes that by August or September it
will have detailed lists of Australian
manpower and hardware requirements
for the area, year by year as the British
leave. On this timetable the three-year
plan would be ready to be presented to
Parliament in October or November,
to provide a guide for budgeting in
1969-70. The plan would operate from
July 1, 1969, to June 30, 1972.
In the meantime there will be little
change in the size of our defence
forces. The Governor-General’s speech,
written by Mr. Gorton, reflects his wish
to use the nation’s economic growth for
civilian needs, defence getting a lower
priority: “The cost of providing
defence will this year be over $llOO
million and will rise in the coming two
years as a result of commitments
already entered into and expansions
already made. This represents a very
significant proportion of available
resources and any further increase in
the proportion of total resources
devoted to defence in the future will
need to be considered against the other
pressing requirements of this nation.”
Defence Minister Fairhall will be
making a major statement on defence
in Parliament after the Easter break.
In that, he will break the news on the
cost of the F-llls (about $2BO million)
and other big equipment purchases
overseas. He will also define in general
terms the implications for defence
planning of the British withdrawal. In
his Governor-General’s speech, Mr.
Gorton referred to the possibility that
the British might still have a mobile
amphibious force available for use in
South-East Asia after the abandonment
of Malaysia-Singapore bases. But
Defence Minister Fairhall is said to be
urging his fellow Ministers to forget
that one, pointing out that the British
are now training and equipping for
exclusively West European conditions.
Having cancelled orders for long-range
transport and strike planes, they have
no capability to deploy here even if
they had the desire to do so.
Another significant shift in Govern-
ment policy occurred last week when
it became apparent that there is to be
no ceiling on our Vietnam troop com-
mitment after all. In Parliament, Mr.
Gorton said that he had made his no-
more-troops-for-Vietnam statement in
answer to a question on the implica-
tions of the Communist TET offensive,
and intended to indicate that in
response to this there would be no
increase. “As for next year, or the year
after or future years,” no Government
could ever be committed to what it
would do. Mr. Gorton changed the
printed Hansard version to weaken this
slightly, so it read: “I am not, and never
could be held to be, in a position of
looking years into the future.” The
present ceiling is, however, to be inter-
preted flexibly with small increases in
support units being permissible. For
instance, only a few minutes after the
PM Jhad spoken these words, Army
Minister Lynch was saying that if the
experience with the present 19 Cen-
turion tanks in Phuoc Tuy was good,
more might be sent. And, of course,
they will need men to operate them.
But though Mr. Gorton has relaxed
his position on our Vietnam troop
commitment somewhat, he is clearly
less enthusiastic about it than the late
Mr. Holt. He sees it mainly in terms
of paying the premium on the insur-
ance policy of the American alliance.
Where Mr. Holt referred to our troops
being there in support of the Vietnamese
people, Mr. Gorton in his G-G’s speech
put the Vietnam commitment in these
terms: “My Government will continue
the support accorded to the United
States of America and the Government
of South Vietnam . . .” The point fre-
quently made in the past by Mr. Hok
and Mr. Hasluck that the defence
South Vietnam is in ultimate a defence-
of Australia itself did not appear any-
where in the speech.
Since better - fight-them-there-than-
here has been the basis of popular sup-
port for our Vietnam commitment, this
was a very significant omission.
The Country Party
Under attack on redistribution
LABOR IS toying with the fascinating
possibility of attempting to use the
Australian Lligh Court, guardian of the
Commonwealth Constitution, as the
enforcer of the principle of “one man,
one vote.”
If the move succeeded, Labor would
have, through the instrumentality of
the highest and most impressive judi-
cial body in Australia, defeated through
legal processes the implacable political
manoeuvres of the Country Party for
a loading of Australian electorates in
favor of rural voters.
The Opposition Leader, Mr. Whit-
lam, who is a QC as well as a par-
liamentarian, revealed last week the
way Labor’s mind was running.
Whitlam, who was condemning
scathingly the extent of the South
Australian gerrymander, which threat-
ened to eject from office Labor Premier
Don Dunstan, despite his command of
54 percent of the S.A. vote, pointed out
that gerrymandering was not unique to
South Australia. It existed in other
Australian States. In fact, if the
Country Party got its way, it would
invade the Federal electoral arena,
Whitlam had obviously been think-
ing of ways to thwart the Country
Party demand that rural electorates
should have a 20 percent loading
against urban electorates a demand
upon which the CP is so insistent that
it does not mind if, in getting its way,
it strains perilously its relationships
with its Liberal coalition partners (who
have a wing, led by N.S.W. Liberal
MP Harry Turner—and Social Services
Minister Wentworth which agrees
with Labor that a vote should be of


equal value wherever located in Aus-
tralia).
Whitlam revealed that he and his
colleagues believed that there were
prospects of thwarting the CP through
judicial processes.
He claimed that Section 24 of the
Constitution, which says that Members
of the House of Representatives shall
be “directly chosen by the people of
the Commonwealth,” was modelled
upon the section in the • United States
Constitution which has produced a
series of United States Supreme Court
decisions against gerrymandering and
upholding the principle of “one man,
one vote” in both Houses of the United
States Legislature.
In the course of his judgment in the
Dunstan and Whitlam ... getting their heads together on redistribution
Reynolds v. Sims 1964 case, Chief
Justice Warren said, “Legislators repre-
sent people, not trees or acres. Legisla-
tors are elected by voters, not farms or
cities, or economic interests. To the
extent that a citizen’s right to vote is
debased, he is that much less a citizen.
The basic principle of representative
government remains, and must remain,
unchanged—the weight of a citizen’s
vote cannot be made to depend on
where he lives.”
Whitlam, speaking as a politician but
obviously backing this in his other role
of QC, said that Labor believed that
the Australian High Court could be
persuaded to accept the view of the
United States Supreme Court.
If the High Court could be persuaded
to this viewpoint, it would be a case
of really putting the fox among the
chickens. The Country Party believes
that unless it gets the loaded redistri-
bution it is determined to secure
through political processes, it is faced
with political extinction as rural popu-
lation continues to erode to the cities.
It would undoubtedly strike out in a
lot of directions ... a situation
deliciously pregnant with possibilities.
Rural industries
A new flexibility
THE SIGNIFICANCE of the Federal
Government’s $25 million scheme to
reorganise the dairy industry lies not
only in what it will achieve for dairying.
It also has significant implications for
all the other rural industries that are
producing the wrong things in the wrong
places in Australia.
The $25 million will not go very far
toward buying up the properties (at
improved capital values) of the 24,000
dairyfarmers now earning a net income
of less than $2OO a year and reselling
them at their unimproved capital value
to other land-users (or other dairy-
farmers seeking to get economies of
scale through larger holdings). If all
eligible dairyfarmers took up the offer,
it would cost about $75 million, so the
Government apparently expects few
more than one quarter of them to do
so. At least to begin with.
These are not major producers, and
since many of the properties will
doubtless be acquired by bigger, more
efficient dairymen (although meat
producers and tree-growers may take
some), there seems little prospect that
the scheme will go far toward reduc-
ing the nation’s milk production, on
which it pays a subsidy of $27 million
a year.
So the industry is going to depend
almost as heavily on finding export
sales in steadily contracting world mar-
kets as before. The scheme means that
about 8000 fewer people will feel the
pinch: but the pinch from sterling
devaluation and Britain’s entry into the
Common Market, if it happens, is still
there.
But at least the scheme, the details
of which were announced by Primary
Industries Minister J. D. Anthony last
week, is some sort of recognition that
Anthony. .. nothing sacred in land use
there is nothing sacred in the way
Australians are using the land; that
given enough prompting the Govern-
ment is prepared to try to change it.
For Australia was settled in a
higgledy piggledy way with land-use
decisions being influenced by many
other factors than whether it was the
most economic thing to do. Some of the
products that were right once are right
no longer; markets have changed but
production goes on for ever, protected
from the realities of changes in demand
by artificial barriers thrown up for
many reasons —some of them related
more to electoral necessity than the-
community’s needs.
Once begun, a rural industry is hard
to change; the large amount of money
paid out in bounties, subsidies, and sup-
ports is evidence that many of them
cannot be justified by economics alone.
And, as in so much of manufacturing
industry, there are other protective
devices; in dairying it is estimated these
effectively cost far more by excluding-
cheaper N.Z. products than the annual
subsidy and that together they make up
about $7O million a year. (The Aus-
tralian dairy industry’s exports only
total about $lOO million a year.)
But the dairy scheme provides a
flexibility in allocating resources that
has not existed before, and it is in the
nature of politics that once having
begun it will continue. The question
now is whether the principle will extend
to the other industries that are in
danger, like dried and canned fruits
—and even wool.

MR. C. E. BARNES IS not one of
the Prime Minister’s favorite men. A
tall, handsome gentleman of great
dignity, who obviously likes the pomp
and ceremony of Government, he is
something of a hangover from the

Barnes...casting doubts
caused trouble frequently by casting
doubts on whether Australia was really
prepared to give New Guinea inde-
pendence, and so providing endless
copy for Radio Peking and Radio
Moscow in their anti-Australian propa-
ganda.
But coalition tradition has it that
the Liberal leader chooses Liberal Min-
isters and Mr. McEwen chooses his.
If Mr. Barnes had been a Liberal, he
undoubtedly would have gone in the
Ministerial reshuffle when Mr. Gorton
came to power. Mr. Gorton is doing
the next best thing. First he is taking
part of Mr. Barnes’ job from him by
transferring administration of the
Northern Territory to the Department
of the Interior. Second, and more
important, he is laying down the line
on New Guinea. This came through
strong and clear in the Governor-
General’s speech, where he said, “The
destiny of Papua and New Guinea is
to become a self-governing country
developed for independence if, and
when, it is clearly demonstrated by the
majority of the indigenous population
that this is what they wish. My Govern-
ment’s basic policy for Papua and New
Guinea is therefore to develop it for
self-determination.”
This puts “paid” to Mr. Barnes’
repeated attempts to keep the door
open for some form of New Guinean
internal self-government within the
framework of overall Australian con-
trol. The seventh State idea is finally
dismissed.
W.A. Elections
Finally, the minerals squeeze
BILL AND KATHERINE VINCENT
saved every cent —spent their last
dollar on a block of land. Not land
they had dreamed about, but all they
could manage. But they cannot build.
The ads say “block is deposit,” “ample
finance.” The “finance” involves first
and second mortgages at such high
interest rates that it would swallow
Bill’s wages. He earns $53 a week.
His application for a Housing Com-
mission home is returned —“not
eligible”—he earns too much. And so
Bill and Katherine search for a rented
home—every day more desperately.
They will go without anything and pay
Charles Court. .. hindsight
the extortionate rent demanded just to
get a home. Any kind of home. But
that door is closed, too. CHILDREN
NOT WANTED—the final shattering
insult.
This is not the script for Cathy
Come Home, in Mr. Wilson’s pinched
Britain, but the story in Mr. Brand’s
affluent Western Australia ... at least
it is how Labor was painting the situa-
tion in some imaginative advertising
before the March 23 State election.
Housing has been an issue for years; it
was recognised by Sir Robert Menzies
on the strength of information supplied
by Western Australia, and was taken up
and used successfully in his last elec-
tion. The hardship level of people who
earn too much to qualify for State
Housing Commission low-interest rents
and loans has been pointed out
repeatedly. \
But the bitterness at the price of land
and shortage of houses, and the extent
the State Government was being blamed
for this, frightened Liberal supporters
in the final stage of the campaign.
Because of their age and financial
security, most policymakers would not
be fully aware of just how tough things
are in this respect. But the increasingly
young electorate certainly is aware of it.
And this became the main election
issue, being used to surprising effect by
Labor.
This was shown up most clearly in a
television show last week which gave
viewers direct access to Mr. John
Tonkin, Leader of the Opposition, and


Mr. Charles Court, who spoke on behalf
of the Government. An estimated 3000
callers jammed the switchboard in the
late show, and land specula-
tion and housing costs was far and
away the most contentious topic. Mr.
Court was able to point out that the
Government had already made what
might, in earlier Governments, have
been been considered un-Liberal moves
—placing restrictions on the terms of
land sold, to squeeze out speculators.
There would be a record number of
houses built in the next three years, he
said, just as there had in the past three
years; and one in four of the houses
was State-built, the highest proportion
of any State. But he insisted that the
auction system was the “frankest and
most effective yet devised” for disposing
of land, even Government land which
was being made available to help
dampen prices. To this Mr. Tonkin
was able to make the point that “the
Government is selling land for as much
as it can make; it’s doing nothing dif-
ferent from the land speculators.”
The other hot topic on “Election
Hot-Line” concerned Dr. Maurice Benn,
serving a prison sentence for the mur-
der of his severely mentally retarded
and hyperactive baby son. Mr. Colin
Campbell, Comptroller - General of
Prisons, has called Dr. Benn a model
prisoner for whom further imprison-
ment serves no purpose. It was widely
expected that a recent Cabinet review
of a Parole Board recommendation
would bring about his release, but
Cabinet decided he should stay in prison
and would not reveal the Board’s
recommendation. Mr. Court, quite
rightly, claimed that “the atmosphere
in which the case was considered was
not in the best interests of justice” with
“an atmosphere of pressure, particu-
larly political pressure.”
Asked about royalties from minerals
ventures, Mr. Court said that hindsight
might enable people to say that the
State should have received more from
W.A.’s Opposition Leader Tonkin ... Government land-speculating
the companies coming in—to which Mr.
Tonkin heartily agreed. Then he let
slip a phrase that might not go down
so well in the boardrooms of London
and New York: “It’s a matter of judg-
ment at the time just how far you can
squeeze these people.”
Victorian ALP
'A' -day coming?
PREDICTIONS THAT the Victorian
Labor Party central executive is about
to be overturned have been as frequent
as forecasts that the drought is about
to break and have extended over an
even longer period. But if there is no
sign of moisture in the wind there are
a number of straws in it, each indicat-
ing that a day of Armageddon for Vic-
torian Labor may not be far off.
Last year Mr. Whitlam began his
address to the annual conference of the
Victorian Party with the words: “In
the seven years since I last addressed
the Victorian conference, the Australian
Labor Party has lost three national
elections and a Senate election. Each
defeat has been heavier than its pre-
decessor . . .” The Whitlam moral
was: “In both national and State elec-
tions, Labor in Victoria has consistently
achieved the lowest vote in Australia,
and the lowest vote at any time since
Australia became a nation.”
The trouble with the attack was that
it remained a moral one. The unions
failed to rally against the Victorian
executive; the State Parliamentary
Party maintained a timorous silence;
and the demoralised branch structure
simply continued its quiet process of
fading away.
Last week the leader of the Parlia-
mentary Party, Mr. Clyde Holding, took
the first public opportunity to display
the attitudes he has for some months
been revealing in private councils. He
agreed with Sir Henry Bolte in expres-
Holding and Wilkes ... Parliamentary
Opposition leaders
sing concern at a newspaper column,
“Labor Speaks,” published weekly in
the Melbourne “Herald.”
For anyone looking for a fighting
issue, an easier target could not have
been presented. The column, issued
under the authority of the State secre-
tary, Mr. Bill Hartley, attacked Sir
Henry Bolte for breaking an electoral
promise in bringing in new taxes. It
went on with the statement:
“Labor then charged that Sir Henry
was not telling the truth.
“It was able to do this because senior
officials in the Premier’s Department
and the Treasury were seriously con-
cerned that the Premier was misleading
the electors.
“They knew what he planned and
they felt it their duty to appraise the
Parliamentary Opposition of these
plans.”
It was significant that after Mr.
Holding joined in the attack on this
statement by the spokesman of the Vic-
torian executive a close friend of his,
Mr. Colin Pratt, announced his resig-
nation from the executive. He has
since been dropped as chairman of the
Party’s foreign affairs committee.
Whilst Mr. Holding and Mr. Pratt
were making the public announce-
ments, a group of unions which support
them was organising a boycott of this
year’s ALP State Conference. Some of
their members are believed to have
urged that all dissident unions with-
hold their affiliation fees from the
Party until democratic reforms are
made in its administration.
Meanwhile at the branch level dis-
affection has been shown in the efforts
of members to get their branches to
disaffiliate and run anti-executive
“Whitlam-ticket” candidates at the
next Federal and State elections. If
ever there is to be another Labor split
in Victoria this could be the year, but
the shrewd money still argues that the
drought will break first.


OVERSEAS
WHY THE GOLD RUSH
HAPPENED
GREED, FEAR, hysteria, and ignor-
ance, caused European civilisation’s
seams to creak last week, and at Wash-
ington on Sunday they had a partial
victory. The French threw their urban-
ity out of the window and, with the
London gold market closed, punched
and fought like animals to get gold at
$45 an ounce. Men in Throgmorton
Street and around the City were des-
perately worried, as those old enough
to remember the dark days of 1931 be-
gan to stir. Others were desperately
stupid. “I’ve never been so relaxed in
my life,” quipped one American broker
as the New York Stock Exchange
opened.
When America’s gold reserves
haemorrhaged, travellers suddenly
found all those financial transactions
they have learned to take for granted
hard or even impossible. While foreign
exchange dealings were frozen, in Lon-
don exporting ground to a halt The
mighty dollar, once the lingua franca of
world money, had caught the plague.
There were fears that a flucht in die
sachwerte, a stampede into material
things, the German fever of the
’twenties, might be under way. “People
were mainly buying things with the
least workmanship: and the most value
in stones or gold,” said Cartier, the
London jewellers. “People are putting
paper money into unset diamonds,”
reported Mappin and Webb. Said Ger-
rard, “They’re beginning to say what
is the use of having money?”
More dangerous still was the widen-
ing credibility gap between the United
States and Europe. “There’s one word
that’s really beginning to get under
my hide that over-used five letter
word, shock,” grumbled an American
broker. “Three weeks ago we liquidated
all our Wall Street holdings,” said a
London merchant banker. “Just after
Christmas the technical situation on
Wall Street began to look extremely
grim. Most of the market technicians
■there for the first time were refusing
to believe what they saw.”
Yet despite London’s pessimism,
many Americans seem unmoved. Wil-
bur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, and the man
who has resolutely blocked President
Johnson’s proposed ten percent tax in-
crease, retired home to Arkansas last
weekend to attend an “Ain’t Wilbur
Great” dinner. Some American econ-
omists were pointing to the strength
of their economy, incapable of grasp-
ing that even Goliath could take a
tumble. “All the noise is on your side
of the water,” gibed an American. “I
don’t know why you had to close the
Stock Exchange.”
The one technically solvable prob-
lem of world liquidity was suddenly
escalating out of all control.
The root cause was America’s per-
sistent balance of payments deficit.
Although America sells, as exports, far
more than it buys, as imports, its favor-
able balance has been more. than swal-
lowed up by the flow of capital out of
the U.S. Much of it has gone to estab-
lish American business abroad. Some of
it financed American citizens travelling
abroad on holidays. But, above all, it
poured out to pay the growing cost of
the Vietnam war.
For nine years now the American
deficit has been flooding the world with
dollars. As these dollar balances have
grown, the holders have begun to get
restless. They see no end to the deficit,
and although they have always had the
right to turn those dollars into gold,,
there was a growing realisation that
America might one day be forced to
increase the price of gold to protect
its reserves.
The speculators began to see this as
long ago as October, 1960. Demand
then forced the price of gold on the
London market up to $4l an ounce.
It was the Bank of England which
persuaded the Americans of the dangers
of the price of gold on the private
market being higher than the price at
which the Americans were prepared to
sell gold to other central banks. It
amounted to an “unofficial” devalua-
tion of the dollar.
The result was the creation of the
“gold pool.” The central banks of
Britain, Belgium, France (which has
since withdrawn), Italy, Holland,
Switzerland, and the U.S. agreed to
provide the London market with enough
gold to meet all demands from specu-
lators and to hold the price at $35.
The weakness of this system to
put it very crudely was that a vast
superstructure of credit had been
Through a rear door of the Bank of England goes a convoy of gold bullion flown
from Fort Knox to London on Saturday to shore up the depleted British pool


erected on a small supply of gold.
While individual countries, in their
national economies, had emancipated
themselves from their dependence on
gold (and used the printing presses
instead) the world had not. It was as
though a 20-stone man were forced to
balance on one leg. And the result was
that countries were forced to pursue
a beggar-my-neighbor policy of trying
to acquire gold at one another’s ex-
pense. Everyone suffered, but the
poorer countries were worst hit of all.
This element of instability tended to
grow with the American payments
deficit. But continual assurances, first
from President Kennedy and then
President Johnson, that the “dollar was
as good as gold,” kept the speculative
pressures damped down.
However, each reassurance had less
and less effect—as they did with the
pound over devaluation. (As with Mr.
Wilson, if'President Johnson had acted
earlier, the crisis might have been
avoided.) The statement of the central
bankers on the weekend before last
that they would continue to support the
dollar at $35 an ounce simply increased
the speculation. Two new elements had
increased uncertainty: General De
Gaulle, and the war in Vietnam. The
General has never made any secret of
his contempt for America’s puny efforts
at controlling its payment deficit and
of his distaste for the Vietnam war.
He gave a positive lead to speculators
by changing the dollars in France’s
reserves into gold. His deliberate
attempts to embarrass the U.S. sharp-
ened and aggravated the crisis, thereby
threatening, for political ends, a system
that carried the main burden of sustain-
ing world trade.
Simultaneously, each extra soldier
sent to Vietnam was seen as one more
reason why America would eventually
have to increase the price of gold.
At the beginning of this year President
Johnson announced measures designed
to cut the American deficit, then run-
ning at $3500 million, by $3OOO mil-
lion. Incredibly, even this failed to con-
vince the speculators that America was
serious. First, many people doubted
whether the measures would be as
effective as the Administration hoped,
and, secondly, there was no sign of the
Vietnam war ending. Two things seem
to have sparked off the current panic.
First, the Viet Cong offensive in Viet-
nam and America’s apparent intention
of throwing in still more troops and
money, and, secondly, the growing and
outspoken disquiet expressed by leading
Americans, such as Senator Jacob Javits,
over the present gold policy.
When the bankers met last weekend
in the Federal Reserve Board’s white
marble headquarters on Constitution
Avenue it was already assumed that the
most likely immediate solution was a
“two-tier system” for selling gold. This
scheme was announced on Sunday. It
means that the official price for deal-
ing among central banks will remain
at $35 an ounce, while the free market
for private speculators will be allowed
to find its own level (probably around
$45).
The alternatives were:
• America could simply have an-
nounced that it was no longer pre-
pared to sell gold to other central banks
or anyone else.
• It could have given in to the specu-
lators and raised the price of gold.
• It could have continued to meet all
Key figures in the gold drama
Bill Martin
Sir Leslie O’Brien
Pierre-Paul Schweitzer
Michel Debre
Karl Blessing
MANY PEOPLE when they learned
that the fate of the world depended
on a handful of central bankers must
have felt their blood run cold. The
public image of the central bankers
may have stayed the same since the
Depression, but their corporate
character has changed much since
then.
The banks directly involved in last
weekend’s crucial meeting in Wash-
ington included the central banks of
the United States, Great Britain,
West Germany, Holland, Belgium,
Italy, and Switzerland, with France,
of course, on the sidelines. Once a
month the heads of these seven banks
meet in Switzerland at the Basle
Club, first for a meeting, and then
over dinner. They know one another
well, better than they know many
of their own politicians.
The central central banker at the
meeting was Bill McChesney Martin,
chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board. His background is appealingly
self-made in the best American tra-
dition. He was the youngest ever
President of the New York Stock
Exchange before the war. Martin has
the reputation of being a good,
sound, conservative thinker with no
flashy revolutionary ideas about the
monetary system.
He works very hard in a methodi-
cal and unhurried way, and once
complained that President Johnson
got so impatient listening to him
that he felt as if any minute he
would set the beagles on him.
Martin is able to be comparatively
independent of his Government, both
through his constitutional position
and through his strong personality.
He has already served under four
Presidents. But his independence in-
sulates him to some extent and is
apt to make him shun the real poli-
tical significance of money: in this
case the fact that the weakness of
the dollar is fatally entangled with
the cost of the Vietnam war.
The British central banker, Leslie
O’Brien, was at something of a dis-
advantage. Britain was felt by most
of the others at the meeting to be
too close to America already.
O’Brien’s influence was also neces-
sarily limited by the sorry history
of devaluation.
Of all the Europeans, probably the
most independent from his Govern-
ment is Karl Blessing, of the Bundes-
bank. He can even put up the bank
rate without consulting the Govern-
ment. Blessing was fired by the Nazis
in 1939, joined Unilever, which he
left in 1958 for the Bundesbank.
His record in international rescues
is impressive, but he has always been
stern about the American and British
balance-of-payments.
One of the most outstanding
bankers on the international scene is
the Governor of the Bank of Italy,
Guido Carli, who sits in an exquisite
damask room in front of a painting
of St. Sebastian. He has been one
of the strongest advocates of co-
operation between central bankers
and of a European currency.


demands, but have tried to eradicate
the speculation with a massive attack
on its payments deficit.
The real objection to the last pro-
posal was that if America had clamped
down on domestic growth in order to
reduce imports this would immediately
have been felt around the world. What
America would not buy, others could
not sell. Other countries might also
have been tempted to retrench at home,
thus stifling what growth there is in
international trade. In theory, countries
with substantial reserves, like France
and Germany, would have been pre-
pared to grow as fast as possible and
risk balance of payments deficits in
order to maintain the momentum of
international trade. But the trouble was
that there is a shortage of international
reserves. These have not grown as fast
as world trade, and even those countries
with what look like comfortable re-
serves of gold and dollars still believe
they are not big enough and so feel
vulnerable and unable to pursue growth
at the expense of their reserves.
This is why, now that the crunch
has come, sooner or later an increase
in the price of gold might be the next
stopgap.
True it is primitive. By now the
world ought to have reached the point
where it can dispense with that yel-
low metal.
But an increase in the price of gold
would increase the value of reserves in
relation to international trade and coun-
tries might not be so endlessly con-
cerned to put their balance of payments
before domestic growth.
However, a change in the price of
gold would be a terrible blow to
American prestige. The dollar is the
only currency tied directly to gold. All
other currencies are tied to the dollar.
If gold were increased in price, this
would amount to a devaluation of the
dollar. This is not quite as bad as it
sounds, since most other countries
would probably maintain their relation-
ships with the dollar. But some might
not. This would be more of a worry
for Britain than for America. Coun-
tries like Canada and Japan might
take the opportunity in the general
realignment of exchange rates to de-
value. This would cancel out some of
the advantages of Britain’s devaluation.
Alternatively, America could have
decided to stop selling gold to anyone.
In effect, to “demonetise” gold. This
was unlikely, simply because no one is
quite sure what might have happened
and central bankers hate uncertainty.
It is possible that the world’s blind
faith in the value of gold would have
sent the price through the roof even
if it,were no longer tied directly to a
single currency.
Alternatively, it might have been
treated as just another metal like, say,
copper, with its price determined by
the uses to which it could be put. This
would have meant a fall in the price,
since gold is actually useful only for
ornaments, filling teeth, and for coating
the umbilical cords of walking space-
men.
Under the two-tier system that has
been adopted, America will go on pro-
viding the central banks with gold at
$35 an ounce, but the gold pool will
be closed down and the private market
allowed to find its own level. The
danger of this system is of “seepage”
between the two markets. It is possible
that the smaller central banks might
continue to cash in their dollars for
gold at $35 an ounce and sell the pro-
ceeds on the “unofficial” market at say
$45 an ounce, pocket the profit, and
then repeat the process ad infinitum.
Who are all these speculators? Any-
one who is legally allowed to buy gold—
plus a few who are not —and who has
the necessary cash or can borrow the
money. Britons and Americans are not
allowed to hold gold, but no one would
be surprised if a few sharp millionaires
had built up substantial, untraceable
holdings under other names with foreign
banks. Canadians and most Continen-
tal citizens are free to buy and hold
gold, although some countries, like
“The VIP treatment, Gallagher, he’s struck gold!”
France and Japan, have strict controls
on the import and export. of gold.
Throughout the Middle East gold hold-
ing is free.
Actually, identifying the individuals,
companies, and, indeed, the countries
speculating in gold is next to impossible.
Buying orders come from the thousands
of banks spread round the world, and
the ultimate destination of the gold
bought is a close secret. But there are
hints. The traditional buyers are poles
apart: the Middle East oil sheiks and
South American millionaires on one
hand and the peasants in France and
the poor in India on the other. These
traditional holders began to reinforce
their buying.
They were joined by the professional
speculators who have borrowed massive
sums of money on the European money
markets at high rates of interest and
bought gold. Most ominous of all, it was
clear that many banks were buying for
their own account, that manufacturing
companies were pulling spare cash out
of the money market and buying gold,
and that some of the smaller central
banks were running down their dollar
balances by buying gold.
What did they hope to gain by this?
They were after a handsome profit.
They bought this gold at just over $35
an ounce in the belief that America
would eventually be forced to raise
the price of gold, perhaps to $7O an
ounce.
The speculators still look on it as
the world’s best one-way bet. The price
of gold has been fixed at $35 an ounce
since 1934, while other prices have
roughly quadrupled. The chance of the
price of gold falling is, therefore, vir-
tually non-existent. It is now rising on
the free market and there is still
the chance America will give in.
Where will it all end?
The two-tier system might be a
transitional face-saver, and the price of
gold might later be increased. It is
too late for more sophisticated solutions.
The world will have given way to
primitive and irrational forces, but the
pressure on gold and on international
liquidity will abate and the crisis will
pass.
Slowly, ever since the Bretton Woods
Conference in 1944 established the In-
ternational Monetary Fund, the world
has been working toward a system in
which man created sufficient credit to
meet the needs of trade rather than
have trade restrained because there
was insufficient gold to finance it. Last
year the IMF took the first step in
creating a system, a new type of in-
ternational money in the “special draw-
ing rights.” Unfortunately, the bankers
had not moved fast enough. This
scheme has still to be ratified by the
respective Governments. Whatever else
happens, the move toward the eventual
demise of gold is not likely to be
abandoned. Bankers can always foresee
disaster, but prefer inaction. Are they
likely to get away with it again?


U.. Democrats ’ fight
Kennedy's gamble
ONE WINTRY afternoon two or three
months ago, Senator Robert Kennedy
sat in his office on Capitol Hill quietly
explaining just why he could not con-
template getting into the Presidential
race this year. Any direct challenge to
President Johnson on his part would, he
argued, inevitably be seen as an act of
vengeful usurpation. It would divide
the Democratic Party irretrievably and
disastrously, and it also could not help
harming the anti-war cause by imperil-
ling the prospects of re-election of all
those liberals in the Senate and the
House whose only hope of survival was
to be all things to all men.
Undeniably, it was a persuasive and
powerful case and only as his visitor
rose to go did Senator Kennedy sud-
denly cast doubt on just how far it
represented the whole story. “I think,”
he murmured softly, “I might be able
to get the nomination, but that’s by
no means certain. And you can’t just
wound a king.”
Despite the lofty justifications offered
today by the Senator for taking the
greatest gamble of his career, there is
no doubt that the main reason why he
has now entered the race arises from a
shrewd calculation that with LBJ’s
world falling apart it has suddenly be-
come possible for a Kennedy to strike
at the President with a real chance of
bringing him down.
For months, Walter Lippmann has
been portraying Lyndon Johnson as a
latter-day Herbert Hoover but it
probably required the current gold
crisis with its built-in threat to
America’s whole economic stability to
bring home just how apt and deadly
that personal comparison is. For, as with
Hoover 40 years ago, the impression
gradually growing in the public mind
is of a President who has lost control
of the situation who stumbles about
bludgeoned and bewildered in the
nation’s highest temple of government
as pillar after pillar crashes down.
If Kennedy bitterly regrets one
thing it is that he lacked both the
courage and the foresight to move be-
fore. For as events have worked out, his
decision to challenge the President
at the present stage cannot help but
look like the behaviour of a man moti-
vated more by ambition than principle.
American politics, however, is a
rough, mean game, and even all the
liberal shock and dismay at the ruth-
less speed with which Kennedy moved
to rob Senator Eugene McCarthy of
the fruits of his New Hampshire vic-
tory cannot quite obliterate the central
fact that Bobby Kennedy is the one
Democrat whom Lyndon Johnson has
always feared.
The only consolation which the
White House is perhaps entitled to feel
is that, if Kennedy had deliberately set
out to demonstrate to the world the
truth of every charge that has ever
been levelled against him, he could
not have done himself more damage
than he has in the past few days.
There is certainly no question of the
bitterness now felt about him, not just
among the President’s supporters but
also and far more seriously
among all those who have given their
allegiance to McCarthy. Before Sen-
ator Kennedy can even begin to get
his campaign off the ground, he will
need to do some massive repair work
to his own image with the American
liberal community and particularly with
the young and idealistic within it.
It will not be easy. For if, as seems
the most plausible intepretation, Bobby
Kennedy genuinely believed that by a
raw demonstration of muscle and power
he could shoulder Gene McCarthy out
of the race, he certainly misjudged his
man. Beneath McCarthy’s quiet, don-
nish demeanor lies a very tough mind
and will. Indeed, he emerged from his
meeting with Kennedy last Wednesday
afternoon not just angry but con-
temptuous, too and not all the
pleading of his friends could persuade
him afterwards even to return Kern
nedy’s recurring telephone calls.
In the end, however, the political
imperative in the situation seemed
bound to prevail. Whatever Bobby Ken-
nedy and Gene McCarthy may feel
about each other now, nothing can alter
the fact that in order to defeat Lyndon
Johnson they need to work together.
Certainly in the Kennedy camp
in contrast to the more romantic dreams
harbored by the McCarthy forces
there are absolutely no illusions about
just how daunting a job, even given
unity, defeating an incumbent President
is going to be. As tenant-in-possession
of the White House, it is Lyndon John-
son today who holds and controls all the
weapons from the carrot to the stick,
and, despite his current high-minded
posture of being wholly above internal
party conflicts, no one expects him to
be at all shy of applying every bit of
pressure available.
Although LBJ’s renomination may
now have come under serious threat, he
certainly cannot yet be counted out.
There are 2622 votes at this summer’s
Democratic Convention. Of that num-
ber, the President is virtually certain of
retaining the backing of the solid south,
amounting to 614 votes in all, or nearly
a quarter of the total. He can also count
on holding on to at least some large
Northern States, where the local Party
chieftains have renewed their pledge
of allegiance to him.
But the real chance for the anti-LBJ
effort must inevitably rest not so much
on hard statistics as on an emotional
stampede. If there is one thing even
the smallest-time American politician is
terrified of, it is being identified with
a loser, and the real danger to LBJ
is that the impression will remorselessly
grow that even if he succeeds in hold-
ing on to the nomination in August he
cannot hope to win in November.
There are even those who believe
that in the end this may persuade the
President not to seek a second term
Senator Kennedy announcing his
decision to run against President
Johnson
which, if won and completed, would
incidentally make him the longest-
serving President in American history
after Roosevelt. That, however, hardly
seems a very likely possibility. It is
clearly far more in LBJ’s character to
fight to the end.
All sorts of explanations and interpre-
tations have been put forward to
account for Senator McCarthy’s stag-
gering showing in New Hampshire
last week: it has been suggested that
he owed his triumph to the helpfully
timed televised hearings of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, to the
bleak rumors appearing in the news-
papers about 206,000 more troops being
needed for Vietnam, even to the nice
manners and model behaviour of the
thousands of students who canvassed
and worked devotedly for him.
All these things played some part, but
far and away the strongest factor was
simple dissatisfaction with the state of
the country and equal distaste for the
President’s own style of leadership.
It was not, in fact, so much an anti*
Vietnam vote as an anti-LBJ vote.
And that is the measure of the chal-
lenge the President now faces. In the
broad context of the whole American
electoral system, New Hampshire may
have been no more than a tiny pebble
but, as Aneurin Bevan told the
House of Commons in his resignation
speech in 1951, “It is always small
stones that start great avalanches.”"
Perhaps the only serious question about
the avalanche that started on the hills:
of New England last week is whether
it will wash Lyndon Johnson away at
the Democratic Convention in August,,
or on polling day in November.


Malaysia's Parliament
Vital matters
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Kuala Lumpur
“WILL THE Minister state whether
bust-developer equipment used by a
number of beauty parlors in Malaysia
at present has been approved by in-
ternational medical and health experts
and whether the Minister of Health
is satisfied that such equipment is not
dangerous to the health of users?”
asked the Senator. Minister of Health
Bahaman bin Samsudin said deadpan
in reply: “At present the'use of bust-
developer equipment does not require
approval of international medical and
health experts. Such equipment is con-
sidered not dangerous to the health o!
the users” no doubt to the strain
of a few hear, hears, and maybe an
odd giggle.
Visitors to the Senate Gallery could
have heard this exchange in Malay-
sia’s Dewan Negara recently atnidst
some irate “they’ve-let-us-down-we-
should-let-them-down” rumblings vis-
a-vis Britain and some gloomy prog-
nostications on the economy. Well, of
course, Malaysian maidens are not
alone in pursuing vital statistics and
profile a la occidental. The point is
the question was asked, and some
Ministry of Health official had to
run around getting the drop on bust-
developers. Had anyone in the Japa-
nese Diet, one wonders, asked a similar
question about the unhappily still
popular eye-straightening operation?
Malaysia’s Parliament has just
finished its six- or seven-weeks’-long
Budget session. The Dewan Raayat is
in continuous session Monday through
Saturday as befits a House of Repre-
sentatives, while the Dewan Negara (all
Senators appointed) meets for about
a week. I say continuous only in re-
lation to days, since both Houses
keep regular hours, only into late-
night session if too much business re-
mains when the time comes to adjourn
sine die. The usual Dewan Raayat
day consists of a morning session, ten
till one, and an afternoon one, four
till seven or eight o’clock.
While the parliamentary proceed-
ings here have never regained the
electric, fiery atmosphere that per-
tained in the months preceding sepa-
ration, they are by no means as sedate
as the hours. The Budget session
five or six other sessions each of less
than a week constitute the parliamen-
tary calendar is frequently used
to generate political heat and not a
little light as well. The general debate
on the Budget is used as a political
platform by all Parties. At question
time Ministerial weaknesses are probed
and much interesting information
emanates as a result. Two favorite
targets this year have been the Minister
of • Commerce and Industry for
allegedly not doing enough to en-
courage Malay advance in that field,
and the Minister of Transport for
allegedly not doing enough for the
Malaysian half of Malaysia-Singapore
Airlines with both Ministers giving
back more than they got.
Most Bills are well debated if very
rarely substantially amended, though
even here it would be easy, too easy,
to ignore the substratum of parlia-
mentary compromise which underlies
the parliamentary dialectic. For in-
stance, a particularly controversial Bill
recently passed imposes penalties for
those failing to give the national
anthem due respect. Several Members
I spoke to were uneasy at the pros-
pect of the law being enforced in
cinemas wherein, unlike say, Thai-
land, Malaysian audiences do not
automatically rise to their feet for
the national anthem, “Negara Ku.”
So while there are plenty of
Malaysians who maintain that Parlia-
ment doesn’t work, there are, in fact,
plenty of signs that it does, the more
so if one compares the fate of parlia-
mentary institutions elsewhere in the
region. Thailand has been fudging the
issues of whether or not to have an
elected Assembly for years, and the
present crisis in Vietnam and Thailand’s
own insurgency problems will probably
result in the issue being avoided still
longer. Interestingly, though, the Thais’
new constitution separates the legisla-
ture from the executive, according to
informed sources. This could mean that
elections and the Assembly become
meaningless: equally it could be a
Thai solution to a difficult problem of
getting the parliamentary machine
ticking over in the first place.
In the Philippines, Congress first,
last, and all the time mirrors the Fili-
pino politicians’ seemingly infinite
capacity for intrigue and manoeuvre
and, as a result, is more a forum for
conspiratorial politics than anything
else. The Philippines needs tax reform
and more tax revenue. President Marcos
is not the first and will certainly not be
the last to suggest such reform. This
Congress, like others equally represen-
tative only of the wealthy elite, will
probably allow his proposals to languish
Malaysia’s Minister of Transport, Tan
Sri Sardon ... under attack
or else will decimate them. The Con-
gressional stress is on the theatrical,
not the practical.
It is too soon to write off parliamen-
tary institutions as unbefitting the Indo-
nesian political genius. All that one can
say is that the present legislative
scarcely attunes itself to Indonesian
national requirements in that, for ex-
ample, it so long delayed passing the
foreign investment laws. The only
criticism that one can make of General
Suharto’s “stacking” of the Indonesian
Parliament is that he took too long over
it in the first place.
Last, but not least, Singapore. Un-
doubtedly, in the pre-Malaysia days,
the Singapore Legislative Assembly was
really alive and the centre of the
nation, as the Barisan Socialists sought
to overthrow the People’s Action Party
through parliamentary cliff-hanging.
Today the Assembly is but a pale
shadow of its former self as the PAP
tries unsuccessfully to have a dialetic
with itself.
Compared to these, the Malaysian
Parliament is neither out of place nor
ineffective. Unlike Thailand, the legis-
lature does affect the executive: ques-
tion hour alone gives Malaysian civil
servants and Ministers plenty of cause
for concern. Unlike the Philippines,
Parliament is a means for getting things-
done. Unlike Indonesia, an Investment
Incentives Bill was proposed and passed
this last Budget session. Unlike Singa-
pore, there is not a complete dearth of
opposition and also the Alliance
Government is rather better at criticis-
ing itself than is the PAP.
But then Parliaments, in developing
countries particularly, are not to be
nor will they be welcomed for their
own sake. Comparisons are meaningless
compared to the overall question
how well does Parliament serve Malay-
sia?
In that it is a forum for discontents
to be articulated and for compromises
to be reached, it works well. Those who
criticise its function are for the most
part criticising, in effect, Malaysian
politics the steamroller Alliance
majority and the complacency it en-
genders, especially as it is faced only by
a lackadaisical and spasmodic, as well
as disunited, opposition. Nonetheless,
the Dewan Raayat is a means for at-
taining some national consensus and
growth, though the Dewan Negara
which, to my knowledge, has only
amended a Bill when it concerned par-
liamentary allowances, is less easy to
justify.
Put another way, when I visited the
Dewan Raayat for the first time in a
while, a Minister was being attacked
on account of the sewage system in
Ipoh. As is usual he replied that “when
funds are available, etc., etc.” Some-
where a civil servant had been scurrying,
someone was worrying, another was
defending. The people of Ipoh may
well get sewage satisfaction much
earlier as a result, and certainly much
quicker than they would do in most
other South-East Asian towns.

WRITERS’ WEEK has become a usefully self-
contained part of the Adelaide Festival of Arts, and
this year attracted about 200 writers. These pic-
tures show some of them at an informal gathering
in Adelaide
By DENIS O'BRIEN
IT WAS only natural that some of
Adelaide’s starchy social attitudes
should begin to wilt after five Festivals
of Arts, but this was revolutionary.
There, in the dining-room of the South
Australian Hotel, was author Tony
Morphett, wiry beard and all, sitting
in a monastery-brown sports shirt, open
at the neck; all under the blind eye of
Mr. Louis, the grand and imperious
guardian of the dining-room’s sanctity
and a man who hasn’t flinched from
tackling such avant-garde dressers as
Bob Dyer and Tommy Trinder.
Only a few nights earlier, impresario
Harry Miller had extended the boun-
daries of the South’s tolerance by sweep-
ing in with an opera crowd for an
after-theatre drink in his Snowdon-
sweater dress-suit ensemble. Now, at a
nearby table, he eyed Morphett coolly
and muttered, “Bet he wouldn’t get
away with it after the festival.”
But he might. He just might. Al-
though, this year, Adelaide seems to
have lost its grip in the staging and
administration of the festival, allowed
it to become an amorphous sprawl of
variety without invention, the city itself
I 1 ? 8 a smooth adjustment to the
biennial show and now accommodates
t 0 j ma gi n e an Arts Festival being
Brisbane (too selfconscious)
and wasted on s^d {tOQ deter ; .
minedly blase) . Melbourne's Moomba
Festival looks like a threat, with its
administrative strength and developing
cultural ambition, but Adelaide, as
John Batman might have said, is the
place for a Festival of Arts.
Tony Morphett had been wearing the
same s hirt all day, which is not so much
a commentary on his wardrobe as a
remark on the sacrifices which have to
be made in the cause of festival involve-
ment. There just isn’t time enough to
Bo everything. It is hardly a valid criti-
cism to say that there’s “too much” to
see, do, and hear, but it is extremely
difficult to go home with more than
phantasmagoric impressions. Unless,,
like the worshippers who attended for
Writers’ Week, you specialise.
Writers’ Wepk has hprnmp a rnm-
fortablv self-contained entitv within the
and “a"*“enoughTurp“d
momentum of its own to continue even
if Sir Robert Helpmann opted for a
fun . timc career making records
«r James Bond films. Writers' Week,
too > 1S one of the most demonstrably
meaningful festival events because it
aims t 0 encourage cultural debate in-
stead of passive spectating. It is possible
to attend all the debates, lectures, semi-
nars, and readings available on the
writers’ program and to get an invigora-
ting course of cultural and intellectual
therapy without once hearing Rita
Streich, Tito Gobbi, Marlene Dietrich,
Acker Bilk, Peter O’Shaughnessy read-
ing Lawson, or Tamas Hqckl, the Hun-
garian whistling virtuoso,
Many writers visiting Adelaide, in-
deed, do not foot it beyond their own
program. Perhaps that is why so many
of them seem narrow-minded and con-
versationally boring. Yet it is only
Writers’ Week which offers to yank the
public in from the cold of dollars-and-
cents patronage. At least it is possible
to question Hal Porter on his novels,
whereas one can only applaud Miss
Dietrich (too ritualistic) or boo her
(unthinkable) for her eternal imper-
sonation of a singing Miss Haversham.
With practitioners of just about all
the arts in town and airing their
flowers, it was only the writers who
grabbed the nettle and staged an open
forum on the question of Government
aid for the arts in Australia. Not sur-
prisingly, it resulted in a lot of
rhetoric, but it did attract the attend-
ance of Dr. H. C. Coombs in his new
hat as chairman of the Australian
Arts Council. Goaded by Stephen
Murray-Smith’s no-nonsense sharp-
tonguing of the System, Dr. Coombs
revealed more of his attitudes .toward
the arts than ever he did when he
governed the Elizabethan Theatre Trust
from behind its imperturbable opera-
ballet mask.
Because he seemed stung by Murray-
Smith’s remarks, Dr. Coombs spoke
with subjective conviction, and it could
be that the new Arts Council is going
to be a much more potent and practical
organisation than its bureaucratic
establishment and leisured silence has
us t 0 ea j. Coombs wants men
with money, discernment, and influence
around his council table. He doesn t
want artistic practitioners at the top.
Allowing for the immediate reflex
action by outraged actors and painters,
this sounds good thinking. Any Arts
Council commanded by an incompati-
bility of artistic temperaments must be
doomed. Dr. Coombs sees the practi-
tioners functioning as advisers to his
nine-man council, doesn’t want a
bureaucracy, and, although he didn’t
spell it out, gave enough hints to sug-
gest a better future for drama. The
climate could be improving,

causes in which he did not believe.
Dickey currently is Consultant in
Poetry in English to the Library of
Congress, Washington. He doesn’t think
poets would greatly suffer if there were
no copywriters to help them sell their
poems.
Max Harris, who is Adelaide’s most
industrious bookseller and writer,
wasn’t present to give an opinion. In
fact, cultural rubberneckers who went
to Adelaide to see Mr. Harris flourish-
ing his person through the festival, as
much as his preliminary opinions on
it, might have been disappointed. He
wasn’t much on view. “You wouldn’t
expect Max to mix with hoi polloi,”
said a Writers’ Week official. “But if
you really want to look at him you’ll
probably find him in his bookshop.”
He wasn’t there, either unless he
was hiding behind the stacks of Harris
tea which rise, strangely, at the front
of his store.
Meanwhile, hoi polloi mixed amiably
at an organised “informal gathering” in
Adelaide’s Royal Admiral Hotel, an
interesting pub conducted by Giuliano
Di Francesco and advertising such un-
common counter-lunch specials as
Fegatini di Polio alia Veneziana and
Fried Cheese and Sausage, 45 cents a
time.
The writers lunched on an excellent,
but less exotic, smorgasbord and drank
by generous courtesy of Martini and
Rossi. Out on the back patio C. P.
Mountford, Olaf Ruhen, Roderick Serle,
Thomas Shapcott, Hal Porter, Edward
Lyndall, Tony Morphett, Lyn Harring-
ton (“She’s our guest from Canada and
is going to give a special lecture on the
subject ‘Making travel pay off’”), Ohe
Kenzaburo, a young Japanese writer
who seemed badly in need of an inter-
preter to help him relate socially, and
Hans Magnus Enzensberger, a German
poet with what the young woman des-
cribed as “the undernourished attrac-
tiveness of Yevtushenko.”
George Finkel (“I write for the
teenage market”) had come from
Springwood, N.S.W., and was a bit
peeved because only one of his books
was in the South Australian State Lib-
rary, and that in the research section.
Rod Serle was luckier; his latest book,
“Ships,” was being launched in town
that week.
A few of the writers thought the
organisers could have arranged better
exhibitions and displays of books. Only
two were mounted in conjunction with
Writers’ Week an exhibition of pub-
lished Australian poetry and manu-
scripts, and another of English child-
ren’s books of the 18th and 19th century.
But then Peter O’Shaughnessy was a
little sour at the amount of official
effort being put to the promotion of
Marlene Dietrich at the expense of his
production “The Recruiting Officer,”
and a tourist, drinking interval orange-
ade at a performance of Patricia
Hooker’s “The Lotos Eaters,” was in-
censed that one local newspaper “gives
more space to the visit of this Ena
Sharpies woman than it does to festival
reviews.” Yet it was only on the Press
that Violet Carson and the festival
clashed. She attracted large crowds
wherever she went, but the festival’s
geography somehow protected the inno-
cent.
Geographically, the festival isn’t as
inconveniently muddled as many com-
plain.
The halls and little theatres are scat-
tered, and Adelaide does need a Festival
Hall complex if only to give the show
a bricks-and-mortar anchor. But no-
where is really very far from anywhere
else in Adelaide and when one gets
there the environment usually is a lot
better than Sydney equivalents, at least.
Some of Adelaide’s small theatres
the AMP, the Arts, Theatre ’62, and
the Union (particularly the Union, with
its comfortable and recently opened
downstairs bar) are enviably pleasant
to anyone with long memories of hard
nights at Sydney’s Independent.
What has been presented at this year’s
festival, though, is another matter. It
hasn’t been a vintage year. Quality
seems to have been sacrificed for erratic
quantity. A Festival of Arts doesn’t have
to be a Festival of National Arts, but
Adelaide this year would have been
less confusing if some of the extraneous
entertainments had stayed overseas.
Except Frank Lazarus and Maggie
Soboil, that is. They came, as a late
addition, from South Africa by way of
the Perth Festival and, in terms of
artistic discovery, they are the hit of the
season. A young and attractive couple,
they detonated a joyously funny late-
night show of parody and inventive
nonsense on the fringe. It won’t stay
there long. While they were still warm
from the glow of their exciting first
night, Harry Miller signed them for
Sydney, and only later wondered where
he’d present them.
He’s also determined to retain the
rather meaningless sub-title “an anti-
cultural evening” which Frank and
Maggie had thrust at them when they
arrived in Australia a couple of months
ago. Labels hardly seem to matter. Their
clever and devastatingly wicked parody
of Marlene or their capsuled production
of “Macbeth” as a musical comedy
are sufficient to sell them.
Among the welter of less satisfying
entertainment in Adelaide, Frank and
Maggie will escape the notice of too
many. After a morning of Arthur Boyd,
a lunchtime of Rob Inglis, a matinee
of “The Runaway Steamboat,” and an
evening with the Salzburg Marionettes,
the Lazarus and Soboil Late Night
Special is beyond the energy of cultural
weaklings. There is too much of it all.
As John Douglas Pringle said, when
presiding over a Writers’ Week lecture,
“While many of you were boozing at
the Old Admiral or whatever it is. I
was listening to our guest speaker give
an excellent address on French music.”
But, then, man can’t live by music
alone.


Bettina Gorton —woman
of many words
By RAY TAYLOR
WHEN the American Educational TV
Network asked me to do a film inter-
view with Mrs. Gorton, what was my
reaction? At first stormy. Especially
when I found that the request had been
granted by the PM’s Press Office.
“Just like them,” I ranted. “They
won’t even accord you the courtesy
of enmity. I spend years as a pro-
fessional malcontent, rousing the
rabble, signing everything, and what
happens? They embrace me. Would
they let Sahl or Buchwald get near
Ladybird? Would de Gaulle allow the
‘Le Canard Enchaine’ crew in to do a
personal profile? No.” Then I stopped
to think, which I usually do after I
speak, and my sound North Country
common avarice made itself felt. Who
knows where this might not end if it
were successful? It could start a
whole new, and much needed, career;
one in which I, in turn, could strut
and preen up and down my split-level
apartment in front of starving and
grateful hacks. I need never spend a
penny on personal transport again. I
would become the confidant of the
Great Ladies of our society. Time the
broads had a look in, anyway; it’s
indicative of the tenuousness of sexual
equality that the worst writer on the
paper always interviews the women.
Poor dears, they become the personal
property of cherubic crocheters like Mr.
Godfrey Winn and his ilk.
And so, blithely selling out and mov-
ing toward Frostland, I arrived at Pent
House Number Two of the Sheraton
Motel. It was filled with one camera
and the round dozen people necessary
to operate the thing; the place an in-
ferno of lights and the floors bestrewn
with cables and wires which led to the
audio operator, who was crouched over
his panel in the lavatory. Anxious mem-
bers of the Press corps stood around,
and I could see at once that they took
a dim view of me, having, perhaps,
realised that I was the satirical person
who kept getting chucked out of tele-
vision stations. They did a quick check
to ensure that the whole thing was not
being done for the Viet Cong and then
Mrs. Gorton arrived.
Right on time, and if I were one of
your Winn-type writers I would say that
she was dressed in simple good taste.
The producer started in to introduce
Mrs. Gorton to everybody in the room,
which now looked like a Marx Brothers
set. “You’ll never remember all those
names,” I scoffed. “No, but I remember
faces,” Mrs. Gorton replied quietly. So
quietly that the audio operator inquired
from his place in the lavatory whether
Mrs. Gorton could please speak up. On
this I was adamant. The lady had a
good, slightly husky quality to her
“mid-Atlantic” accent and must not be
subjected to false projections. And what
was more, riding the levels was the job
of the audio operator. “Shove the
microphone closer, then,” he answered
mutinously.
Before any television interview, and
particularly when it’s in color, where
the make-up lends one the texture and
color of the underbelly of a frog, a cer-
tain amount of tension is created; as
you sit, knee-to-knee, with the subject
not moving because it would spoil the
composition and croaking out things
like: “Now, this won’t hurt; just relax,”
for all the world like a dentist who has
suddenly realised he doesn’t know what
the hell he’s doing.
Well, sir, it didn’t matter how many
times Mrs. Gorton said, “Relax,” I was
dissolving into a tiny bead of perspira-
tion while she sat there as calm as if
she had made more movies than Joan
Crawford. Her features are ideal for the
camera, too: strong, broad, with the
caramel bright eyes level and steady.
The smile economical but warm, and
as she sat there smoking my Gauloises,
I could see why some columnist had
compared her with Signoret. There’s
the same air of complete repose; the
quality of stillness which is an innate
thing and cannot be cultivated. The
darting quick ripples of intelligence
which illuminate and attract so much
more than any conventional chocolate-
box concept of beauty. To me, though,
she resembles more the sympathetic
Hollywood prototype of the American
mother; a fined-down Fay Bainter. I
remarked on her poise, and was it due
to any Maharishi-inspired meditation?
“Not with the Maharishi,” she said,
“although I think I understand what
he is trying to do, having been through
seme of the Buddhist and Islamic forms
of meditation. Mainly though, I do my
meditating when weeding the garden.
The physical action involved takes care
of my New England puritanical sense
of guilt.” “What,” I said, “you mean
to say you never just lie around reading
trashy French novels?”
“O.h, yes,” she smiled. “It helps my
French.”
There’s lovely country around Maine,
which I have always thought of as the
original model for the Christmas Card;
so many pictures have I seen of it
buried under deep snow and it was
these long, cold, blanketed nights that
first gave Mrs. Gorton her abiding
passion for words as she wrapped her-
self up in the dictionary. Later she
attended Bangor (pronounced as the
Welsh) and took Romance languages,
the pursuit of which led her to the
Sorbonne. Denying any complicity in
the American Sentimental Journey to
Paris she stated, emphatically enough
for any audio operator, that she was
a long time after Scott Fitzgerald, any-
way. On vacation from the Sorbonne
she spent the time with her brother in
Spain, who was then studying at
Oxford. With him was a young man
called John Gorton.
It’s been Australia and Asia since
then, with only one early trip back
home. Mrs. Gorton seems to go along
with Thomas Wolfe that you can’t go
home again. There’s disappointment
there. Nostalgia becomes a more potent
force over the years, yet one which
feeds not on Place but on Time. In
1965, after one of the longest recesses
in history, Mrs. Gorton picked up her
studies again at the National Uni-
versity in Canberra working for her
MA through the unusual medium of
Indonesian literature.
This academic determination was
due, not to the “finding oneself” pro-
cess employed by so many American
women, but simply because Mrs. Gorton
likes to finish what she has started. In
between times—when not meditating in
the Kerang orchard, or over a tractor,
or looking after the three children (the
two sons have taken the predictable
course of the Canberra younger set and
gone for the law) Mrs. Gorton has been
working with a team on the compilation
of a Malayasian-English dictionary. I
would say that this philologic devotion
stems more from the old obsession
with words than any belief in greater
communication th r ou g h language,
although Mrs. Gorton stoutly main-
tains that Esperanto is still alive and
kicking. Which I must admit was news
to me. But, as is obvious from the
mention of meditation, she is, too, in-
tensely interested in the culture and
the folklore of these Asian countries:
and right at the moment I can’t think
of a better address for a person of these
pursuits than Canberra.
While on the subject of her husband’s
political life she inadvertently employed
the word “performing.” The good old
semantic training made her regret it
immediately. I reasoned that if you sub-
scribed to Sartre’s philosophy we were
all of us playing a part, anyway, and
that, therefore, the use of the word
was genuine and right. She doubted

this, both my argument and Sartre’s,
but felt that this was neither the time
nor the place to get into a polemic
discussion of existentialism.
“Well,” I followed up, “how do you,
for instance, see yourself in the role of
first lady?” Those long, steady looks
of Mrs. Gorton’s render her the kiss
of death for the average Australian
television interview, where the subject
never really listens to the question
because as soon as it is begun he has
started thinking of the answer and,
conversely, the interviewer never listens
to the answers because he’s thinking of
the next question.
“I don’t know about it being a
role,” she said slowly. “I’ll take it
as it comes and do what I can.” And
pragmatism, for once, sounded like
something more than a handy rationa-
lisation of unpreparedness.
Television, she believes, has enabled
the politician to get his message across
more effectively and has circumvented,
to some degree, the disagreeableness
of the extreme climes in which cam-
paigns seem invariably to take place.
Which certainly makes more sense
than a lot of the convoluted prose of
Marshall McLuhan, a gentleman of
whom Mrs. Gorton seems to be bliss-
fully if not enviably unaware.
Television, to her, remains primarily
an entertainment medium and she
shares Mr. Gorton’s, by now, famous
viewing tastes. “Maybe it’s his form
of meditation.”
I suspect that the lady has now
lived long enough in Australia to be
chary of the appellation of Intellec-
tual. “In any case,” she said, “my
husband is more intellectual than I
am.” Ganberra pleases her. It affords
the right mixture of town and country
one to complement the other, as
in the combination of hard physical
work on the land with academic
studies.
She went on to tell me that life
there, as in most places, was lived
on two levels so that the represen-
tatives of dissident countries could still
find some degree of amicable relation-
ship on social occasions. Fond of en-
tertaining and good talk, Mrs. Gorton
seems to have had no reason to side
with those critics who claim that the
woman in Australia is little more than
a feudal chattel.
Then we ran out of film. The Press
corps said they would like to check
the tape to see if there was anything
which should come out. Well, that’s
the communications business for you!
All the same it would be a great pity
if some hustler of a PR man were
to try to make a freaky, publicity
gimmick out of this quiet, charming,
and, in spite of what she says, intellec-
tual woman. Sadly, for my new-found
career, there are very few Mrs.
Bettina Gortons.


The Cabinet: learning to know
thy neighbor
By PETER SAMUEL
WHEN MR. GORTON, as the new
Member for Higgins, was introduced to
the House of Representatives last week,
with Mr. John McEwen on one arm
and Mr. William McMahon on the
other, the cynics recalled Mr. Mc-
Ewen’s public veto on Mr. McMahon at
the time of the struggle for the succes-
sion to Harold Holt. However, to recall
this incident was not really cynicism,
but idealism. The better comment might
have been a simple: “That’s politics.”
Cabinet government is usually the
result of compromises between dis-
parate individuals. All that we are now
witnessing in Australia is a return to
normal after the extraordinary domin-
ance Sir Robert Menzies exercised over
his Cabinets during his last years of
nearly absolute power. Unless Mr.
Gorton achieves a similar dominance
(which seems unlikely as an immediate
possibility), political power in Australia
is going to rest, as it traditionally has,
in the balance of forces in Cabinet. And
why not?
In this, the differences between the
men involved are a mixture of differ-
ences in political philosophy and
interest on the one hand and differences
of personality on the other. This article
will look at the philosophies, interests,
and personal styles of the five disparate
individuals who at present make up the
principal “forces” in Cabinet. These
are the Prime Minister himself, his
deputy, Country Party Leader John
McEwen, his Treasurer, William Mc-
Mahon, his External Affairs Minister,
Paul Hasluck, and his Defence Minister,
Alan Fairhall.
Mr. McEwen stands out from his
four senior Liberal colleagues in politi-
cal philosophy and interest. Since he is
the centrepiece of a Party whose natural
rural base is being whittled away by
shifts in the workforce toward the
manufacturing and service industries, he
is forced into seeking support beyond
the countryside. His solution is to mould
a Party of “all-round protection” for
groups unable to stand up to free com-
petition with overseas producers
whether they be rural exporters want-
ing subsidies to sell in other counti'ies
or manufacturers wanting tariffs or
quotas against imports. This brings him
into a conflict of Party interest and
philosophy with the Liberals, whose
stress is on the importance of free com-
petition, efficiency, and the minimum
of artificial protection for vested in-
terests. It brings him into the sharpest
conflict with Mr. McMahon, because
Mr. McMahon and his Treasury are
the most vigorous and articulate sup-
porters of Liberal philosophy. In
week-by-week departmental and Cabi-
net work it is between Mr. McEwen
and Mr. McMahon that the conflict
most often arises irrespective of per-
sonal feelings.
The extent to which this conflict has
gone was last week reflected in a meet-
ing of the Parliamentary Press gallery
of journalists. There anti-McMahon
and anti-McEwen factions were locked
in violent argument over a proposal
from the anti-McMahon faction to deny
Parliamentary Press gallery facilities to
Mr. Maxwell Newton, an antagonist of
the Country Party Leader and his poli-
cies. The proposal was narrowly de-
feated. But anti-McMahon people claim
that the Country Party and ALP will
fight their cause in Parliament.
This is by far the deepest dispute
within the Government Coalition, but,
as usual, there are others. Mr. Hasluck
has lost support among fellow Party
members for his statement in defence of
Mr. McEwen’s veto on Mr. McMahon
as Prime Minister. Mr. Bury’s sup-
porters were quite open in telling Mr.
McMahon that Mr. Bury should get his
job at the time of the succession
struggle, and Mr. Bury might have got
it had anyone but Mr. Gorton replaced
Mr. Holt.
Also, as usual, each of the five top
men in the Government has reservations
about the capacities of the others. Mr.
Gorton is being criticised for a lack of
judgment and political immaturity, Mr.
McMahon for a propensity to make-
enemies, Mr. McEwen for his disruptive
partisanship and an obsession with the
Treasurer’s associates, Mr. Hasluck for
his unworldliness and bad public rela-
tions, Mr. Fairhall for his general lack
of political or administrative bite.
Differences in personality, style, and
manner of working also affect relations
between the top five in the Government.
Take their backgrounds. McEwen is
almost a different generation from the
others. He is a retiring sort of man with
an old-world courtesy and sense of form
possessed by none of the others. He can
exude a certain charisma and dignity
even while looking for an extra seat for
a late arrival at a Press conference. In a
way none of the others can, he can give
a sense of presence.
Mr. Gorton is at the other extreme
with his casualness. He is able to make
everyone in his company feel perfectly
at ease. Where Mr. McEwen will create
an atmosphere in which he can over-
awe his company, Mr. Gorton will
speak with people as his equals: two
directly opposite rural stereotypes, but
in style Mr. Gorton is by far more con-
temporary, and more genuinely relaxed
than Harold Holt.
Mr. Fairhall, the successful Newcastle
businessman, Mr. Hasluck, the quiet
intellectual, and Mr. McMahon, the
quick-witted barrister, each reflect their
different city backgrounds. Where Mr.
Gorton is characterised by a blunt,
pointed way of speaking in interviews,
which is excellent for TV, he is only
now learning the ambiguity of phrasing

which politicians characteristically em-
ploy to leave freedom for future
manoeuvre. Mr. Hasluck is the most
systematic of the five in speaking,
envisaging his structure of argument
from the beginning and progressing
from point to point after each is quietly
made. Both Mr. McMahon and Mr.
Fairhall are a tumbling cascade of ideas,
haphazardly arranged in off-the-cuff
conversation, but impressive for their
fluency. Mr. McMahon is the more
forceful and purposive in his speech,
perhaps mainly because his is franker
and more opinionated. Mr. McEwen in
private is identical with the public
McEwen, the slow, sonorous phrases
maintaining the great man imagery.
The top three Gorton, McEwen,
and McMahon are all moody fel-
lows, given to sharp bursts of anger and
occasional periods of sulks. Hasluck and
Fairhall, on the other hand, are re-
markably level-tempered, Fairhall being
almost always amiable and Hasluck
friendly in a quieter way.
In style of work all five again differ.
Mr. Hasluck undoubtedly is the hardest
office worker, getting in each day at
Canberra Public Service time, 8.30 a.m.,
and often working through to midnight,
with only short mealbreaks.
Mr. McMahon and Mr. Fairhall are
9 a.m. men, who always work through
until 6 p.m. in office, but often do
several hours after dinner. Mr. Mc-
Ewen is a 9.30 arrival, working back
only when pressed. Mr. Gorton has
the shortest office hours arriving at
10.30 a.m., taking long mealbreaks, and
rarely coming back in the evenings
except when Parliament is sitting. Like
Mr. McMahon, he works from home,
telephoning a great deal, working with
people over a meal or a beer or beside
a swimming-pool.
Mr. McEwen, like Mr. Gorton and
Mr. McMahon, often works on planes
(where Australian politicians spend as
much time as metropolitan commuters
spend in their motor-cars). Mr. Has-
luck, on the other hand, is strictly an
office-working man. He generally reads
thrillers or detective paperbacks on
planes, brings nothing official home
with him, and spends his out-of-office
hours reading history, delving into his
10,000-volume library, or talking with
his author wife and her Perth friends
in the artistic and intellectual com-
munities.
Their tastes in recreation also vary.
Mr. Gorton is typically suburban. He
likes TV, grog, tennis, and swimming.
Mr. Fairhall is a deep-sea fisherman and
radio ham. Mr. McEwen enjoys talking
farming to experts and acting the jack-
of-all-trades around his property, fixing
a bung windmill or devising a new drive
for a tractor. Mr. McMahon enjoys
good food and drink and fierce games
of squash best. Mr. Hasluck has des-
cribed his hobbies as reading, riding,
and tombstonery.
Relations with staff and public ser-
vants could hardly be more different.
Mr. Gorton most' often expresses dis-
appointment in their output, finding
them negative, calling submissions
“wet blankets on ideas.” Of the five,
he is the greatest loner. He also de-
lights in disregarding the “proper
channels” and probably only operates
through departmental heads when he
thinks that the head will be the man
with the information or the idea.
Otherwise he tends to go down the
line to the specialist. Mr. Hasluck is
the opposite. He works by a strict
view of the separate functions of de-
partment and Minister. He works
mainly from his office in the basement
of Parliament House, mainly with Sir
James Plimsoll, the departmental head.
The Prime Minister has, so far, writ-
ten most of his speeches himself
drafted in a scrawl of soft, black pencil,
or else given off the cuff, with an
absolute minimum of departmental
assistance. Mr. Hasluck will usually
discuss a forthcoming speech with Plim-
soll, get departmental notes, then dic-
tate a text, using occasional points from
the notes. Mr. McEwen mostly relies on
his department yet also completely
dominates it. He is the most completely
geared-in with his public servants. Over-
seas, he will spend up to 18 hours at
a stretch with two or three second-
division officers. All his statements and
speeches are a joint effort being dis-
cussed first as notes drafted in abrupt
ungrammatical form, then personally
put into McEwenese phraseology by the
man himself, as he strides around his
room and dictates to his secretary. Mr.
Fairhall will start by asking for notes,
but rarely finds that he gets anything
remotely suitable. He speaks his state-
ments and speeches into a dictaphone
on his desk. Being a great electronics
man, it is appropriate that he communi-
cates with his personal staff by press-
button intercom while all the others
are press-button buzzer men who sum-
mon their aides to the door.
Of the five, Mr. Fairhall and Mr.
Gorton are the best person-to-person
politicians, masters of the quick phrase
and handshake. Both have closer re-
lations with backbench members of
Parliament than the others, seeking
them out more frequently and giving
them time to talk and relax in their
company. Mr. Hasluck is evidently a
Western Australian separatist at heart,
making a great point of seeing Western
politicians and visitors to Canberra in
a way he will not see the rest of us.
Where his relations with the Press are
minimal (as are Mr. McEwen’s and
Mr. Fairhall’s) Mr. Gorton and Mr.
McMahon are particularly accessible to
journalists.
Despite their long associations in Par-
liament and politics, none of the top
five sees much of one another outside
Cabinet. Each is yery different from
the other, and an outsider’s impression
is that they have little in common but
their Government. But that’s what
they’re for.


SOUTH-EAST ASIA
Where the axemen wait
The concluding article in a series on the British pull-
out from South-East Asia,
by HARVEY STOCKWIN.
IN MAURITIUS recently four men of
one community, armed with axes, were
about to cross a stream in the direction
of an isolated home belonging to a
communal “enemy.” By chance a
British military helicopter, something of
a novelty in Mauritius, passed overhead.
Fearing the imminent arrival of the
police, at the direction of the “eyes in
the sky,” the axemen made off. It was
only much later that the helicopter pilot
learnt he had saved the beleaguered
homesteader. Actually, he had seen
nothing.
The story is a parable for the British
presence in South-East Asia. There are
numerous “axemen” around the region
who know the “helicopter” can arrive.
As one looks toward the future two
questions present themselves. What will
the disorderly elements do when they
know the “helicopter” cannot arrive?
Will even some of the as yet “orderly”
elements change their calculations now
that they know, for sure, their options
are changing?
Certainly they will. For domestic poli-
tical reasons the British have not even
clothed their withdrawal in a modest
veil of mystery or ambiguity. For once,
there might conceivably have been a
case for “muddling through.” It is
now no secret that belated (and inade-
quate) ANZAC, Malaysian, and Singa-
porean pressure was consistently
applied through 1967 until recently,
requesting that at the very least no
specific dates should be attached to the
departure on the irrefutable grounds
that, in many more ways than one,
forewarned is forearmed. The appeals
went unheeded. What little “deter-
rence” remained vanished as a result.
Any residual obligations that Britain
agrees to honor or which are wrung
out of her are, in a sense, irrelevant.
Deterrence diminishes with distance,
and Britain, come 1972, will be at a
distance militarily and politically.
Deterrence from a distance? What
about ICBMs and all the modern
means of annihilating distance? The
fact is ICBMs, and all that, do not
make more ordinary weapons redun-
dant there are many people and
forces undeterred by the sophisticated
hardware simply because it is not
credible in the prevailing circumstances.
Ultimate weapons deal in ultimate
threats, intermediate weapons deal with
lesser ones. The British presence fits and
has fitted in more ways than one, inci-
dentally and accidentally, because it
was equipped to deal with a wide range
of threats, and was reasonably skilled in
knowing when to use which part of
the range. Confrontation was a classic
example of this. There were nuclear
bombers in Singapore and, of course,
nuclear bombs, though the fact-was not
heavily advertised. There were other
heavy conventional weapons. Their use
was not threatened, only implied. The
power struggle was resolved in a lower
key.
But now the accelerated withdrawal
would seem likely to have that eroding,
subversive quality that you normally
associate with a burgeoning insurgency.
Everybody says everything is going to
be all right, but deep down, antlike, the
foundations for complacency are being
removed.
So far some contradictions have been
observable in that Ministerial state-
ments have spoken both of replacing
the departing British hardware and
also of not embarking upon such a
course. Obviously this is a vicious
dilemma. Militarily, to replace only
some may be ineffective powerwise, but
even that may be economically ruinous.
To replace none might well be a
gamble powerwise, but it might pay
off in that other spheres of government
expenditure will not have to be slashed.
As it is, to hold the line in defence
and other expenditure this year in the
face of Malaysia’s declining export
revenue, Mr. Tan Siew Sin’s treasury
has had to do some slashing.
Similarly maybe worse with
Singapore. Before and within Malaysia,
the island’s defence expenditure was
relatively small. Separation and in-
dependence have brought additional
burdens in this field as in others. Lee
Kuan Yew talks merrily about missiles
and jet fighters and has been, accord-
ing to informed (and concerned)
ASEAN sources, a considerable shopper
in the apparently fashionable market
for Armalite rifles. All such expen-
ditures are being undertaken against
the background of a gross national pro-
duct which will have to increase by
nine or ten percent per annum in
order not to decrease.
On the subject of the economic con-
sequence of withdrawal, what will be
the effect on foreign and even domestic
investment, the flow of which is vital
to the Malaysia-Singapore economies?
Once again the accelerated withdrawal
would seem to have an erosive effect.
The simplification that the British
presence “defends British interests in
the region” conveys an incorrect im-
pression, conjuring up as it does the
image of a capitalistic English Shylock
raking in his profits behind a barrier
of British bayonets. The whole busi-
ness is, of course, a good deal more
sophisticated than that. Western in-
vestors often view things regionally to
a greater extent than Western Govern-
ments. Confrontation, separation, post-
separation Malaysia-Singapore differ-
ences, Vietnam, these are but four situ-
ations which have tended to diminish
investor confidence and put off foreign
investors interested in industries from
which they calculated to get their
money back in five years or less. More
particularly for the big international
companies and those thinking of long-
term investments such as plantations.
Both categories calculate in terms of
decades, even generations, not merely
years. And for them the British with-
drawal will almost certainly appear as
one more variable uncertainty making
the long-term picture that much more
difficult to calculate, especially in terms-
of stability. Undoubtedly Finance
Minister Tan Siew Sin was on the right
track when he announced the speedy
promulgation of an Investment Incen-
tive Act in his Budget Singapore
acted similarly in 1966—but objectively
a reservation must be entered as to
whether the track will lead anywhere.
Will the accelerated withdrawal lead
anywhere? Is there anything that can
be said in its favor? If it mainly
prompts pessimistic forebodings can it
partly offer any optimistic hopes?
In fact adverse possibilities are so
many, the prospect so gloomy that in
the immediate aftermath of the
Thomson visit in January one Singa-
pore Minister speculated out loud to
me “Maybe the British have fooled
us, using the post-devaluation crisis to-
carry out a policy already decided
upon? Maybe their computers have
told them South-East Asia is in a mess
and they’ll have to spend £BOOO million
to defend £BOO million!”
All this was said half in jest, tongue
in cheek, in the full realisation that the
British presence was never likely to re-
quire such astronomical sums in order
to be effective. And, of course, for
those who, through their Anglophilia,,
see the perfidious Brits as calculating
every move carefully, the argument
must have a certain appeal. Nonetheless
the Minister’s words underline the fact
that if there is some good in this
British action then it is damn hard
to see it. Since several papers carried
the suggestion, obviously someone in the
Labor Government is hoping that the
East of Suez retreat will one day
be seen as comparable to granting of


independence to India and Pakistan in
1947 and the decolonisation of Africa
in the late ’fifties and early ’sixties.
This close it seems more likely that due
to the style, manner, timing, and speed
of all three departures, some future his-
torian might fit all three events into a
chapter on the “art” of scuttle.
In this connection it needs stressing
that it is the way the task of with-
drawal is being done, not the decision
to withdraw itself, that puts regional
security in jeopardy. Maybe therefore
some positive aspects will emerge, but
emphatically it will be because of luck,
not judgment.
For example, come 1971 even
now for that matter (one hopes) —and
the soporific effect of the British being
here is ended. In their various ways
Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, and
New Zealand (even the United States?)
have taken too much for granted too
long. If now they simply have to take
into account a lot of realities they have
previously preferred to ignore, then that
can only be for the good. One of the
more gratifying aspects so far of an
otherwise miserable affair has been the
way in which Malaysians particularly,
but Singaporeans also, have acknow-
ledged that Britain is acting in accord
with her own interests if not theirs,
ruthlessly and without sentiment. It
would be tremendously reassuring if
one could be certain they will take the
lesson to heart. Then, to give only one
example, one could be reasonably sure
that after their long downward slide
Malaysian-Singaporean relations would
at last start to improve substantially.
There is, however, some hope that
not only in Kuala Lumpur and Sing-
apore but in Djakarta, too, a keener
awareness is growing of how critical
Malaysia, Singapore, and Sino-Malay
communal relations are to the area’s
security. It all reminds that not once
but several times in the post-separation
years we have heard people exclaim
that only if the British said they were
going in 24 hours would they have any
real leverage on Singapore and Malay-
sia to come closer together. Again half
in jest, but that now for 24 hours you
can read 46 months. There may well
be some improvements whether or not
the British use their residual influence
to secure this end.
For the rest just about the only
other “good” thing about this de-
parture is that the extreme Left in both
countries no longer has an imperialist
red rag being waved at it. Funnily
their reflexes are still too automatic and
Barisan Socialists, for example, continue
to attack the Anglo-American im-
perialists as if nothing had changed.
Sooner or later they will have to wake
up to reality. Unhappily when they do
it may w r ell be into 'a rather more
encouraging environment for their acti-
vities than pertains at present.
In conclusion, Britain’s acceleration
into top-speed betrayal of her responsi-
bilities and obligations is far, far easier
to see as part of the general world
drift toward chaos or instability,
violence or disorder, poverty or misery
than in any other way. The decision
to quit by 1971—taken in haste, repent-
able at leisure —contains no vision of
tomorrow in a world already chronic-
ally short of such an invaluable com-
modity.
But it does contain within itself
tragic portents for tomorrow. Austra-
lia, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Singa-
pore have made mistakes, notably in
not seeing, early on and clearly, the
writing on the wall. But Britain has
made some bad calculations. As ever
there will be a price to pay for
everyone.
That price might well be heavier
than that suggested already in these
articles. First, there can be no denying
that one argument which has carried
much weight in Britain has been put
succinctly by British Labor MP Mr.
Christopher Mayhew: “It is all too easy
to show that our trade competitors who
have no military presences do as well as
we do or better; that our investments
can not be protected by our aircraft and
frigates; and that our military presence
hinders rather than helps our commer-
cial and financial interests.”
The argument, of course, reeks of the
“they’re all right, Jack, what about
me?” spirit that Britain today is not
alone in espousing. Then there are
the fallacies. Can anyone seriously
pretend that by putting trade first one
can assure peace a policy that has
not worked and the world shows no
signs of allowing to work? After all,
if Britain quits to compete better with
the Germans and the Japanese, then
America can also quit to take them all
on tradewise, then everyone can “quit”
and a peaceful world trading com-
munity of mutual interests will flour-
ish? Of course, Britain quits in the
hope that America will never com-
pletely quit, and so the Far East will
still be good for British commerce.
Further, Mayhew misses the point
entirely with the stress on military
presence when, needless to say, that
military presence was subordinate to
Britain’s having a political presence, as
yet accepted and, given statesmanship,
potentially useful. One might be able
to accept the last part of Mayhew’s
argument in part were it true that
for Britain the choice was between
joining an outward-looking Europe and
abandoning East of Suez. De Gaulle
effectively sees to it that there is no
such choice.
More important still: behind this
viewpoint, behind what has been so
accurately described as a “washing of
hands” in relation to South-East Asia,
there would seem to lurk an even
more disturbing reality. At time when
the haves and have-nots are locked in
somewhat lethargic, and in some ways
meaningless, confrontation at the
UNCTAD Conference in New Delhi,
one more major national chooses to
act in such a way as to suggest the
developing countries are merely outlets
for the developed world’s trade and
finance.
Developing countries may talk as if
they only desire trading opportunities
and investment, but what they really
want, in essence, is a meaningful poli-
tical relationship which bridges the
growing rich-poor north-south diver-
gence. This is not to argue that mili-
tary presences are the means to create
such a relationship. It is to maintain
that Britain’s recent actions stem
basically from political indifference,
from neo-isolationism. It is said that,
for example, when Britain has cut her
military expenditure she will be able
to give more aid and to assume a
mediator role between the developed
and developing. Her actions are more
contrarily suggestive than such words.
Even further beyond, there is the
looming spectre of a world divided
along racial lines. Mayhew suggests
belatedly a residual presence in Aus-
tralia. Are we to assume then that
Britain can still defend her white
cousins whilst forgetting about her
brown and yellow ones in Malaysia and
Singapore?
That’s going too far you say? I can
only report having recently seen the
problem from both ends, as it were,
from England and from Malaysia-
Singapore. In England there are a
growing number who consciously or
subconsciously for understandable or
for invalid reasons do employ a double
racial standard as they (occasionally)
look outward on the world. In Malaysia
and Singapore by contrast there is a
considerable if diminishing number
who look toward Britain with largely
non-racial feelings of affinity and
friendliness. Naturally in the present
circumstances they feel let down who
can say how they will feel on the morn-
ing after? One fears that the world’s
most tragic gap also grows wider.
Britain’s accelerated withdrawal
therefore creates a profound sense of
unease in relation to both regional and
global “security.” Forget all the clap-
trap spoken about “defending the free
world.” It should be a meaningful
phrase but, as things stand, still man’s
chains are everywhere apparent. Forget,
too, about the defence of Western
values —in a cold hard power situation
such as Vietnam any real values are
bound to be annihilated. Even forget
about “creating an Asian balance of
power,” since power balances pre-
cariously among the powerless and
the relatively weak. Remember in-
stead the irony of ironies that at the
very time when events showed how far
removed still the huge American
presence in Vietnam is from being
identified with a purposeful dynamic
nationalism, the lesser British presence
voluntarily dispatched itself when it
was to a large extent so identified.
For Australia the message is simple,
clear, devastating. No poodle-petting.
No patronising. No indifference. No
apathy. Britain had a political role to
play. She still had power. She still had
influence. She chose not to use them.
Australia has no choice.


BUSINESS
AND FINANCE
Affording a defence build-up
AS IF TO ANSWER Labor Minister
Bury’s claim that real wages have
ceased to grow since the defence build-
up began, the Commonwealth Statis-
tician last week issued statistics on
average weekly earnings. For the
December quarter of last year, average
earnings went up from $63.40 to
$66.10 a 1.5 percent increase, sea-
sonally adjusted. During that quarter,
according to the consumer price index,
prices rose by 0.9 percent. Every
quarter this year has shown a similar
sort of margin for wages over prices,
so that, for the calendar year as a
whole, wages have risen by 6.3 percent
to prices 3.3 percent. The margin
probably represents just about the in-
crease in productivity, so profit mar-
gins will, by and large, have been
maintained. We will have no statistics
on that until the quarterly National
Accounts are finally got out (appar-
ently having been badly delayed by the
last postal strike).
Mr. McMahon, the Treasurer, had
earlier made much the same point
using statistics available at the time.
He pointed out that consumer spend-
ing per head, deflated by prices, had
increased since 1963 by 3.8, 2.5, and
2.2 percent respectively in each finan-
cial year. The drought year of 1965-
66 was particularly bad and below the
average of the 19505. But generally
the higher rate of growth of the
economy (attributable largely to a
faster-growing workforce in relation to
population) has given us room for a
defence build-up and an expanded
Government sector without having to
restrict rates of growth in standards of
living or private investment.
The strange thing about the recent
trend of Mr. Bury’s remarks is that
they may suggest recent wage increases
granted by the Arbitration Commission
have hot been deleterious to the
economy, and that they can continue
to be granted without weakening Aus-
tralia’s cost position. If, in addition, the
Commission is to be only an adjudica-
tor and does not have to take account
of assessments of the economic con-
sequences of its decisions (as Mr. Bury
suggested in his unfortunate Chamber
of Manufactures speech), then we can
expect repetitions of the metal trades
case.
Retailing
Inevitable moves
LAST WEEK Mr. Matthew John
O’Neill presided over two board meet-
ings that decided in favor of merger
or takeover deals. As chairman of
Boral he announced that Boral would
merge its petroleum refining and sell-
ing and petrochemical operations (but
not its road-surfacing business) with
the Total distributing set-up. And as
chairman of Mark Foy’s he agreed that
McDowells had made a fair enough bid
for the troubled Sydney retailer at
$4.3 million.
But they were very different kinds of
deals; the Boral-Total link, which had
been widely rumored, was inevitable
following Esso-BHP’s massive oil dis-
coveries which would have required
Boral, as one of Australia’s refiners, to
take a rising proportion of this higher-
priced local crude oil, without having
any tied outlet for the refined motor
spirit which makes up about half its
output. (At present, Boral buys its
crude from Caltex under an agreement
that requires Caltex to buy back the
refined spirit.)
Mark Foy’s decision also had a feel-
ing of the inevitable about it. The
family has been fighting about how to
run this company for a decade; it was
touch and go a couple of years ago
whether the company would wind itself
up. Now, in a nicely ecumenical move
to coincide with the new understanding
announced last week between Catholics
and Masons, the Masonic McDowells
have won the approval of Jesuit-
educated Mr. O’Neill and his board.
McDowell’s decision to sell the
Mark Foy’s Piazza store’s freehold, if
it gets possession, and eventually to
vacate the area still remaining to re-
tailing (most of the upper floors have
long since been turned into rented office
space, which appears to return Mark
Foy’s far more than its shops do) is in
sharp contrast to the decision made by
the newly merged Buckinghams-F. J.
Palmers operation in another “un-
fashionable” location.
It intends to redevelop the old Buck-
inghams store in Oxford Street into a
$7-million complex containing a retail
store, airline terminal (Ansett-ANA),
272-room motel, 78 self-contained flats,
cinema, offices, shops, restaurant, car
park, and bank over a one-acre site in
a 14-storey building due to be com-
pleted within two years.
Until the Buckinghams part of the
complex reopens in May next year only
Winns of the big retailers (apart from
the chainstores) will be holding the
fort in the once-lively Oxford Street.
And Buckinghams’ directors do not ex-
pect the closure to affect their profits;
the cost savings involved in not having
to carry the present site (which has
been sold to the National Mutual Life
Association as the financier of the de-
velopment) and the use to which the
cash can be put just about offsets the
loss of profits (and, anyway, the group
is doing increasing business from the old
F. J. Palmer store in Park Street).
Public works
Bizarre suggestion
MR. WHITLAM will really have to do
better in his economic proposals if he
is to be thought to have an edge on
the Government in domestic adminis-
tration. Last week, in a speech in Vic-
toria, he revived the hoary old Cal-
wellian proposal for a National
Development Commission “similar to
the Australian Universities Commis-
sion” to recommend works to be
financed by a “National Development
Fund.” The idea that the Common-
wealth and the State Governments
would hand over selection and financing
of public works to independent commis-
sions is really so bizarre as to be
comical. It is all very well for uni-
versities (though, even there, control of
finance is firmly retained by the
Treasury), but the suggestion as it
stands only subjects its author to
ridicule.
In his comments on water planning,
Mr. Whitlam did have some points.
More study is necessary of desalination,
especially when the large plant off the
shore of Los Angeles is reported to be
producing fresh water at 10 cents a
thousand gallons. Sydney water from
the Warragamba costs somewhere
around 25 cents, Melbourne’s new water
is costing 30 cents, and goodness knows
what Adelaide’s costs with all that pipe-
line and pumping needed—possibly 50
or 60 cents. If these initial reports on
Los Angeles desalination costs are cor-
rect, then there will be little case for
continuing to go further from our big
cities in search of rainwater.


THE WEEK
BRIEFLY
For the ecoAomy : Outside pressures gold, the
British Budget, Senator Kennedy as a “peace” candidate for
the U.S. Presidency were the main news . . . Bank lend-
ing commitments rose 25 percent in 1967 to a record
$1714 million against a 23 percent rise in 1966.
For the markets S Gold dominated trading on world
houses with London subjected not only to pre-Budget
speculation but also closing after Thursday’s gold-boom . . .
And in New York, prices eased ... In Australia the market
ended on a nervous note after an uneven week.
For companies: BHP, which has doubled its
estimate of likely oil production from Bass Strait to 240,000
barrels a day by 1970, is to drill, a new wild cat well, Perch
A-l, on a new structure only about 12 miles from the
Gippsland coast . . . Hamersley Iron has announced plans
to make metallised agglomerates at Dampier . . . Oil Drill-
ling and Exploration has staged a major profit recovery . . .
Recently floated Mineral Deposits was “on target” with a
modest rise in interim net profit after a 28 percent rise in
gross . . . But rival mineral sands producer Cudgen fell
below expectations . . . Magellan will spend $1.3 million
looking for oil in Central Australia.
Boral (whose profits are down 25 percent and whose
shareholding in BHP shares has now been almost sold out) is
to merge its petroleum and petrochemical interests into a
$5O million group with Total . . . Directors of Mark Foys
unanimously recommended to shareholders the $4.3 million
takeover bid from McDowells, which reported higher half-
year profits . . . Slater Walker Securities intends to make a
bid for Plastalon Holdings of about $1.50 a share . . . Tas-
manian Board Mills is resisting a $1.7 million bid by Asso-
ciated Pulp and Paper . . . Lithgow Valley Colliery directors
appear unenthusiastic about a bid from Mining Traders
Ltd. . . . Blair Athol is wringing a higher offer out of CRA
. . . Stocks and Holdings has admitted defeat in its bid for
the Hotel Australia to the MLC-Lend Lease partnership.
After. losing several millions, the unsuccessful Gallaher
International cigarette group is shutting up shop in Aus-
tralia and selling its trademarks, leaf stocks, and equipment
to Philip Morris . . . Consolidated Press Holdings, which
owns 85 percent of Television Corporation, is to follow its
subsidiary’s lead and return half its capital.
Fears of industrial disturbances and higher wages follow-
ing the metal trades awards have taken the gloss off higher
profits in the half year from heavy engineering companies
Bradford Kendall, Tulloch, Comeng, and Australian National
Industries . . . Profit of appliance and hardware maker
General Industries rose fractionally despite “extreme com-
petition” . . . Tooheys reported higher interim profits fol-
lowing last July’s acquisition of the Miller brewery . . .

tralian Chemical, Blue Metal Industries, Pongrass, Bebar-
falds, Tarax, Reed Consolidated Industries.
“Steady” results came from Carlton Investments, H. B.

dustries, Television New England and Koitaki . . . Evans
Deakin expects a thumping loss for the year . . . Drought-
affected Horwood Bagshaw reported its first loss in 20 years.
MEN AND
MATTERS
MR. COLIN J. HARPER, who at 38
succeeds Mr. E. P. M. Harty as general
manager of Australian United Corpora-
tion in a week or two, always looked a
likely candidate for possibly the key
private finance job in this country. The
impression strengthened last year when
Harper gave about the frankest run-
down imaginable on the possibilities
facing overseas-owned companies bor-
rowing on the Australian market when
speaking in Canberra to members of
the Australian British Trade Associa-
tion. He spoke with the authority of
experience of the interminable time it
takes in Australia to get new issues into
the market place, and of the run-around
such borrowers were (and still are)
getting in Reserve Bank and Treasury
circles in their efforts to follow the
imprecise guidelines which the chair-
man of Australian United spoke so
scathingly about (with little effect) at
the company’s last annual meeting.
For the past five years Harper has
been manager of Australian United’s
new-issue department and has been
deeply involved in the tortuous process
of getting corporate issues over the
official obstacle course as well as with
underwriting in general for the group.
Born in Britain of Anglo-Australian
parents and educated at Winchester,
Mr. Harper first came out here in the
early ’fifties, following two years’
national service, to work for a year or
so with Zinc Corporation, then returned
to London with the conviction that
Australia was far from being “a wild
frontier” as popularly thought in
Britain. Determined to get more
qualifications to make a successful
career out here, he qualified as an
accountant after five years’ apprentice-
ship with a Scottish firm, and in 1958
joined Anglo Australian Corporation.
He married an Australian (who was
on the royal family’s staff) and re-
turned here, became N.S.W. manager of
Anglo Australian Corporation in 1960,
and when this concern merged with
Australian United three years later
took charge of the new-issues depart-
ment. He lives in South Yarra with
his wife and two boys.
THERE WERE FEW more dedicated
tin men in Australia than the late Ken-
neth Craig, who started the Aberfoyle
group and presided over its fortunes for
many years from 100 Collins Street.
Five years ago, when looking for some-
body to run his new Aberfoyle manage-
ment company, he lighted on Mr.
M. B. Moorfield, who subsequently suc-
ceeded him as Aberfoyle Holdings’ man-
aging director, donning the tin mantle
at the same time. Now only 47, Moor-
field, who has four tin mines as sub-
sidiaries as well as various company ven-
Colin Harper
M. B. Moorfield
tures including the troublesome Green-
bushes on his plate, has divorced Aber-
foyle well and truly from the rest of
Craig’s minerals’ offspring in Collins
Street. Some time ago he set his grow-
ing tin family up on its own in St.
Kilda Road, not that he’s often to be-
found at home there because his tin
mines are all in other States.
Craig was born in Northern Victoria
and Moorfield across the border in
N.S.W., where he went to Hay High
School and on to Sydney University,
graduating in mechanical engineering
before going into the Army for five
years. The war over, he linked up with
John Proud, present chairman of Peko,
to design mining plant for a while,
worked for James Hardie in a similar
role and later at Humes as chief engi-
neer in Singapore.


Did you sell your Western Mining near the top,
before the split? Trendex subscribers did.
Do you have good profits in Broken Hill South, C.R.A., Hamersley,
Kathleen Investments, Mount Isa, or North Broken Hill ?
Do you want to keep them, or see them drift away ?
Some of these stocks, too, may be about to fall. Which are they?
Protecting Gains:
What a thrill it was to buy Minster at around 520 in 1963
(adjusted for issue) and see it climb to 800 within a year.
Great, if you took your profit when the “topping out” signs
then appeared, at the time of the bonus issue. But is it great
if you are still holding the stock today, just above 100? What
a thrill, too, to have climbed with Pioneer Sugar from 200 to
480 in 1963/64, and to have taken one’s profit when the selling
signals appeared soon afterwards. Not much of a thrill to have
held it while it slid to one third of that price again, last year.
Much the same story will be told, a year or two hence, for some
of the mining and oil stocks which are riding high today.
Selling at the Top:
Our clients didn’t sell the 10 shares of Western Mining which
changed hands at the peak price of $5B on 7th February. We
don’t know who did. Do you? Nor did our clients sell any of the
few hundred shares which sold at $57 on the same day. Our
clients don’t usually sell right a't the top. Who consistently does?
However we do prefer to sell near the top, rather than hold all
the way down. We prefer making millionaires, to marytrs.
Of course, one difficulty is to tell whether a setback in price
is just a temporary reaction, or the beginning of a big slide.
That’s where Trendex comes in. And Trendex is usually right.
The Top in Western Mining:
There were plenty of price setbacks or reactions in Western
Mining on the way up. Over the last six months or so there had
been reactions from 2150 to 1730, from 2250 to 1900, from
2800 to 2460, from 3160 to 2650, and so forth. What was so
different about the reaction from $57 to $5O?
The selling signal for Western Mining became apparent
several days before the split, and we sold for our portfolio
clients mainly on Thursday, 22nd, and Friday, 23rd February,
mostly at $5O and $5l. In the Friday (23rd) issue of Trendex
(copy on request) we said:
“Western Mining Corporation faces a magnificent future as an
Australian giant. It is an industry, not just a mine. Eventually,
we have no doubt, the share price (adjusted) will be consider-
ably higher than it is now. Three weeks ago we said, however,
that the probable direction of the next share price movement
‘must be judged from hour to hour, in the light of current
market action’. The chart in that issue has been updated and is
presented again as a one-dollar chart. . . . Whatever the future
holds for Western Mining as a company, and for its eventual
share price, the market action in the last few days has now
confirmed a downright bearish outlook.”
Everyone knows what has happened to the price of Western
Mining Corporation, since then.
Running Against the Crowd:
From time to time somebody sounds off about the market
being “too high”. Authorities are quoted as saying that inves-
tors must be “extremely selective”, and that “many” of today’s
high riding stocks will have falls. But why doesn’t somebody
tell us which ones? Trendex does. When the Trendex selling
advice for Western Mining was given on 23rd February, a
bullish outlook for the stock was practically universal. Article
after article, apd circular after circular, told us how wonderful
the new ore discoveries are (as indeed they are!). They told
us how the smelter plans showed that there must be much more
“up the sleeve”. They told us that the share split would create
much higher demand, and estimates of $lO, for a start, were
common. Nobody, though except Trendex said that the
shares were about to take a heavy fall.
Trendex has been similarly outspoken, against popular
opinion, many times in the past, when heavy plunges in par-
ticular stocks were in prospect.
On Taking Profits:
Naturally there is quite a difference between the position of
the share trader and that of the portfolio investor. The share
trader, who pays tax on his profits, will not hesitate to jump
in and out of stocks if there is a profit to be taken, and it is
in danger of evaporating. However the investor, whose primary
purpose is the building and maintenance of a portfolio from
which he will derive returns, must adopt a different view. He
naturally will welcome capital gain in the value of his port-
folio. Everybody likes to see an increase in their assets and
the more the better. The investor will be quite prepared to ride
out normal share price fluctuations, provided the longer-term
company outlook (and therefore, presumably, the share price
trend) are sound and attractive. But the prospect of a sub-
stantial share price fall is another matter. Nobody likes to see
the market value of his assets cut in half. Everybody is entitled
to protect his assets if they are in danger. Not every share
price plunge ends happily with a stupendous recovery, either,
as too many “long-term investors” have learned to their cost,
in both industrial stocks and mining stocks.
Trendex Portfolio Management:
The Trendex principles are used for the timing of both
purchases and sales of stocks in portfolios managed by Trendex
& Co Pty Ltd. That is why Trendex -portfolio clients get the best
of both worlds buying the right stocks at the right time, and
selling them, too, at the right time.

THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
A false sense of
security from
foreign investments
BY J. C. HORSFALL
THERE’S A LOT of talk in high places
about the standard of living, some of it
at cross purposes. If we have to talk
about the standard of living, let it be,
one suggests, about the future. How
good a standard can we afford and still
make the necessary arrangements for de-
fence? A crucial difficulty about this
question is that there seems to be a gulf
between some of our political leaders on
the extent to which we should be pro-
viding for defence. Lord Casey’s address
at the opening of Parliament doesn’t
help much to resolve it. It complicates
postulations on the future of the stand-
ard of living. Another complication is
that nobody knows even roughly the ex-
tent to which the whole economy, with
its defence, development, immigration,
and standard-of-living requirements is
going to be supported by capital inflow,
without which all four would be at a
substantially lower level than we’ve
managed to push them as a result of
massive importations of private capital,
especially in the past few years.
It could be that we’ve been lulled
into a false sense of security on the bal-
ance-of-payments fronts as a result of
the huge amounts of overseas capital
coming here in recent years. It has to
be freely admitted, however, that, des-
pite radical changes in the sources pat-
tern of private capital inflow in the past
few years, our balance-of-payments per-
formance has been highly satisfactory.
Over the five-year period to June 30
last we have had balance-of-payments
deficits on current account totalling
$2826 million (averaging $565 million
a year). Over this period monetary
movements on international accounts
were a net $243 million in our favor (a
net gain of $lO million in international
reserves and an improvement of $l6l
million in our IMF position, plus $3O
million not specified). The current
account “gap” has been bridged with
something to spare by net apparent
capital inflow of $3069 million, or $6ll
million a year over the five-year period.
The sources pattern of private-capital
inflow as coming from undistributed
income, direct investment, and portfolio
(including institutional) investment in
companies has changed significantly in
recent years. Averaged over the period
1947-48 to 1963-64, undistributed
income accounted for 32 percent, direct
56 percent, and portfolio only 12 per-
cent. In 1964-65, the first of the two
record years of capital inflow, the shares
were: undistributed 21 percent, direct
71 percent, and portfolio 8 percent of a
$546 million total. The next year,
when capital inflow was $664 million,
they were: undistributed income 17
percent, direct 48 percent, and portfolio
34 percent. Last year, when the total
was $457 million, undistributed income
provided 24.1 percent, direct 36.5 per-
cent, and portfolio as much as 39.4
percent. r
The big disappointment in our
balance of payments last year, to my
mind anyway, was not so much that
we failed to sustain our intake of over-
seas capital at the record level of the
year before, or that, despite the magni-
ficent export result, we lost $177 million
in international reserves. It was more
that there was a drop of 49 percent
in direct investment of overseas capital
(as distinct from plough-backs) in con-
cerns controlled (as defined internation-
ally) by overseas interests (there are
now 1500 or so of these overseas-
controlled branches and subsidiaries of
overseas parents operating in Australia).
Last year they imported $167 million
new capital. This, compared with $327
million the year before and $4Ol million
in 1964-66 (a record), was the lowest
intake since 1962. The fall in direct
investment last year accounted for most
of the drop from $664 million to $457
million in what the Commonwealth
Statistician calls “total overseas invest-
ment in Australia” for the year.
This lower intake of overseas direct
investment accounts in large measure
for the flatness of fixed investment in
Australia last year. From the continued
flatness of fixed investment it looks as
if inflow of capital from this source has
failed to revive much, if at all, in the
current year. Moreover, in view of the
U.S. and U.K. capital-export curbs,
a recovery seems improbable for a
couple of years at least. This throws
us back to the other two main sources.
Of these, as for undistributed income,
the outlook is unpromising. Its trend
is downwards. And what of portfolio
and institutional investment, the main
prop of the capital intake last year
($lBO million out of $457 million)?
Though we are still getting sizable
amounts of portfolio investment (mainly
from the U.K.) and institutional invest-
ment (from the U.S.) the future out-
look for them looks bleak: the amber
lights are up for the former and the
red for the latter.
A substantial revival in overseas
direct investment in companies doesn’t
look at all probable over the next year
or more unless it comes from outside
the two most prolific sources of supply
thus far, the U.S. and Britain. These
two countries have provided practi-
cally all the direct overseas invest-
ment in companies here in the past,
though some others such as Germany,
Belgium, Holland, Sweden, and Japan
have been responding more to the
attractions in the past few years.
Countries other than the U.S, Britain,
and New Zealand stepped up their
overall investment here from $53 mil-
lion in 1964-65 to a record $93 mil-
lion in 1965-66 (latest available figure).
Apart from the obscure prospects for
direct and other capital inflow from
the U.S. and Britain, spreading the net
looks all the more urgent because of
the declining contribution forthcoming
from undistributed profits of overseas-
controlled branches and subsidiaries.
The sad fact is that this contribution
has been falling away both absolutely
and relatively to other types of over-
seas investment. Last year the contri-
bution of undistributed income dropped
from $ll5 million to $llO million,
which compares, say, with the peak
received from this source, $136 million
in 1958-59.
On the other side of the investment
cent there’s a strong upward trend in
overseas remittances of investment in-
come. Last year this debit to the
BOP increased from $375 million
to $4OB million. Added to that there’s
a rising trend in remittances of other
property income which have more than
doubled since 1959 and last year in-
creased from $5O million to $55 million
for 1966-67. If the economist at Syd-
ney University who gravely misinter-
preted my mention of such a possibility
last year is still with us, he may care
to note that last year’s income outflow
compares with total private capital in-
flow of $457 million for the year. How-
ever, I don’t think we are on the run
or in dire straits on that account, not
yet, anyway. Be that as it may, my con-
stant guide, philosopher, and friend in
such matters is no longer his former
colleague Professor Wheelwright, but
the Treasury’s 1965 White Paper on
Private Overseas Investment in Aus-
tralia.




URANIUM-IRON ORE -GOLD-RARE EARTHS
URANIUM
One glorious decade
Geld is not the only mineral in the news. Last week there were indications
that the Mary Kathleen uranium mine held very significant deposits of rare earths
that could he at least as important as its uranium; there was news that Hamersley
planned to put up a plant to make “metalised agglomerates” following its deal with
Hancock and Wright to examine their extensive Hanwright iron-ore deposits; and
the Australian uranium mining industry came closer to its “one glorious decade”
when the scramble for uranium should bring high prices and profits. In the follow-
ing pages The Bulletin looks at these four developments.
Australia’s reserves of uranium are small by world standards. And at present
they are lying idle because there are no contracts. But soon they should be in
demand, although Australian miners will have to be quick to avoid missing the bus.
For, as the “Economist” points out in this article, the uranium, boom may last for
■only one decade. So all eyes will be on Riotinto Zinc Corporation, which controls
Mary Kathleen Uranium, through Conzinc Riotinto of Australia, to make certain
that it does not favor its wholly owned Canadian uranium subsidiary, Rio Algom,
in the search for supply contracts. RTZ’s local partner in the MKU mine
(Kathleen Investments) is already uneasy about the fact that Rio Algom is cur-
rently working on contracts won for it by RTZ, while MKU still has none. But
there could be riches to come.
FOR ONE GLORIOUS decade, from
1973 to 1983, anyone sitting on a
uranium deposit will be able to name
his price. The long-term contracts
placed at depressed market prices in
the late 1950 s will have run out. The
third generation of nuclear plants,
which have very modest fuel require-
ments (they reuse a high proportion of
their own waste), will not have been
built in sufficient numbers to have any
significant effect on uranium demand.
And across the world nuclear stations
will be crying out for uranium. At the
turn of the year there were more than
60 stations on order in the U.S. alone,
with a combined generating capacity
-of well over 50,000 megawatts: more
than the total generating capacity of the
British Central Electricity Generating
Board, which is the biggest electrical
utility outside the Iron Curtain.
How big will the bonanza be? The
last uranium rush in the 1950 s brought
to light new deposits all over the
world, including rich and easily ex-
ploited ones in the U.S., and prices fell
from their original scarcity value of
between SU.S.IO and SU.S. 12 a pound
(SU.S. 11.50 to SU.S. 13.50 at current
prices) to below SU.S.4. Recently, they
have begun to creep up: uranium oxide
sells now for between SU.S.6 and
SU.S.7 a pound, but only for relatively
short-term contracts and there are not
many buyers about.
The Japanese, when they signed 10-
year supply contracts in Canada last
autumn, allowed themselves to be
panicked into accepting a price rising
steadily over time. The details have not
been published, but the Japanese are
thought to have agreed to pay as much
as SU.S.B a pound by the mid-1970s
and even more thereafter,
The mining companies would like
this to set the pattern for future long-
term contracts. But the Japanese were
in a weak negotiating position. They
were coming into the market for the
first time, were already committed to a
nuclear power program that is small by
American standards but sizable by any-
one e lse’s, and had no domestic reserves
of ore to f a p back on. More exper-
ienced buyers Britain, for example—
are likely to hold out for tougher
terms
2
fall “ uranium prices that oc-
cui red in the past decade was not
caused only by the discover y of new
deposits. High prices stimulated pios-
peeling, and the prospectors success
happened to coincide with a slump in
the prospects for nuclear power. The

embargo is still in force,
The Canadians, their sales almost at
a standstill, were obliged to compete
for what remained of the free market
with South Africa, which produces
uranium as a by-product of gold mining,
and Australia. All three cut prices sub-
stantially, and none so hard as the Aus-
tralians, who had small, easily exploited
deposits that they ran down for all they
were worth. This time round, it is dif-
ferent. There is no danger now of a
slump in demand. The nuclear-power
stations that are replacing oil and
coal-fired ones in Britain and the U.S.
are doing so because they are com-
petitive, with a price advantage that
is increasing all the time. The price
of uranium forms such a small element
in the cost of a modern nuclear-power
station that it could double, or worse,
without any visible effect on the cost of
atomic electricity.
The uranium producers know this,
but they also know that doubling the
price of uranium ore would pull in
new sources of supply. If the floor to
prices looks like levelling off in the
1970 s somewhere between SU.S.7 and
$U.5.7.50 a pound ($U.5.7.50 seems to
be what American utilities are paying
now to their own domestic suppliers,
as against the $U.5.7.60 a pound for
which they can buy oxide from the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission), then
the ceiling could be around SU.S.IS a
pound.
At that price, it becomes worthwhile
to exploit vast deposits of low-grade
ore in Sweden which could keep the
market adequately supplied far into the
future. If prices show any signs of
rising above that, then it will become
economic to switch over to a British
process for extracting uranium from
sea water, which is stuffed full of it.
As the eighth most plentiful metal in
the world, there is. no physical short-
age of uranium. It is simply that some
sources of it are cheaper than others.
Estimates of workable world reserves
have been based in the past almost en-
tirely on figures supplied by the mines
themselves and they, egged on by the
Canadian mining lobby, have had an
interest in making the prospect look as
bleak as possible. There was so much
criticism of the estimates compiled in
1965 by the European Nuclear Energy
Agency of OECD that the agency has
revised them, with the help of the
International Atomic Energy Agency
in Vienna, and produced within the past
two weeks a new set that puts the future
in a more reasonable light. They are
shown in the map.
The U.S. and Canada rank, in that
order, as the countries with the biggest
supplies of cheap ore, and also the big-
gest reserves of lean ores to fall back
on when the rich veins run out. And
both countries have rather more
uranium than the estimates suggested
two and a half years ago.
Third most plentiful, in terms of
sheer tonnage, is Swedish uranium,
which is uncompetitive in the present
state of the market but which, if prices
once rose above the SU.S.IO a pound
level (which the Japanese contracts
come close to doing toward the end of
their life), would start progressively to
influence supplies. South African
uranium is in a class of its own; reserves
are the fourth richest in the world,
but the grade is too low to justify
uranium production except as a by-
product of gold mining. So the outlook
for South African uranium depends on
what the South Africans think is likely
to happen to the price of gold. At the
moment, they feel it will rise some time
around 1970, and they have, in conse-
quence, increased substantially their
estimates of the tonnage of uranium
that South Africa could produce at
competitive prices, i.e., up to SU.S.IO
a pound. The figure has in fact in-
creased from 140,000 tons to 220,000
tons, with as much again of higher-cost
ore in reserve.
The one new source of uranium
which has not figured explicitly in any
of the previous estimates of world re-
serves is the French discovery in Niger.
It has taken ten years to confirm the
existence of uranium there in com-
mercial quantities; French guesses at
the size of the reserves almost certainly
underestimate them by a very consider-
able margin and the effect of the find is
to turn France from a uranium importer
—the French were trying two years ago
to place contracts for 100,000 tons of
uranium in Canada—into a country
that is at the very least self-sufficient
in nuclear fuels and could become an
actual exporter. The removal of
France from the uranium market has to
be balanced against noises indicating
that the U.S. may lift its embargo and
resume uranium imports in mid-1973.
It will have to do this some day or
other; the question is when. The rate
at which nuclear-power stations have
been ordered recently in the U.S. makes
it look as if demand will have out-
stripped the annual capacity of the
domestic mining industry, which is
around 11,000 tons to 12,000 tons, by
the early 19705.
At its peak, however, the American
industry did build up to 17,500 tons.
And rather more important it is being
said in the U.S. that the rate of order-
ing new nuclear plants has abruptly
fallen off since the beginning of the
year. It is too soon to see practical
evidence of this, but the impression
remains that the utilities feel their
present investment will last them for
some time. And if this is so the de-
mand curve for uranium will not rise
anything like as steeply as expected.
World production is now running
at 20,000 tons a year, although at
its peak it passed 40,000 tons. Not
until the early 1970 s is world de-
mand expected to catch up even with
today’s output, but from then on the
big nuclear plants now under con-
struction will begin to require fuelling.
Annual demand is expected to be back
to the peak figure of 40,000 tons by
1975 and to double in the following
five years. Cumulative requirements
are put at nearly 200,000 tons by
1975, and nearly 500,000 tons by
1980.
Present estimates of uranium re-
serves in the non-Communist world
suggests that at a price of: under
SU.S.IO per lb. there are 826,000
tons; at SU.S.IO-SU.S.IS per lb. there
are 780,000 tons; at SU.S.IS-SU.S.3O
per lb. there are 664,000 tons.
This is what creates the prospect of
a golden decade for the mines, and
gives them a powerful interest in stock-
piling their uranium now in prepara-
tion for the boom to come. The long-
term U.S uranium contracts begin to
run out from 1971. Britain’s, which
include 12,000 tons of Canadian
uranium bought under duress and much
protest in 1962 for a little over SU.S.S
a pound (oh, happy days, never to
return), will probably be adequate to
meet needs until close on 1975.
By that time, half the demand for
uranium in the non-Communist world
is expected to be American; the mines
could, therefore, have Britain and the
U.S. as the two biggest customers at
that period over a barrel, knowing
full well that whatever price they
charged would not affect the onward
march of nuclear power.
Some of the gilt will be rubbed
off: if the rate of ordering of new
nuclear-power stations has, in fact,,
begun to fall off sharply in the U.S.;
if the serious prospecting for uranium
inside the U.S. that restarted in the
middle of 1966 discovers any sizable
new deposits; and if the U.S retains
its embargo on imports of uranium so
that American utilities are obliged to
continue buying from high-cost
domestic producers instead of, much
more cheaply, from abroad. This would
halve the market for Canadian, South
African, and Australian uranium, and
with France ceasing to import would
put the British negotiators of the U.K.

IRON ORE
Hamersley’s tactic
HAMERSLEY’S PLANS to make
‘‘metallised agglomerates” are signifi-
cant not only as the development of “a
novel and exciting raw material for the
world’s iron and steel industry” (re-
quiring new production techniques)
but also for the effect they will have on
the W.A. iron-ore industry.
And a side effect is that it now looks
certain there will not be rival steel-
works in Western Australia. Originally,
the W.A. Government had insisted that
the major iron developers should not
simply use the north-west as a quarry
but that they should also upgrade the
iron ore at least into iron. But Ham-
ersley Iron has now confirmed sugges-
tions first made in The Bulletin last
October that it will put in a metallised
agglomerates plant at Dampier, so it
is evident that this kind of upgrading
nf the West’, ore will satisfv the
ot the Wests ore will satisfy the
Government.
Hamersley’s plans followed sugges-
tions that the Mt. Newman ion-ore
group may do likewise rather than build
another steelworks in Western Australia
in addition to the one BHP are
developing at Kwinana. As explained
last October in The Bulletin, the mak-
ing of metallised agglomerates involves,
the direct reduction of ore into feed
for steel furnaces without first having
to make it into iron in a blast furnace,
Lump ore or fines can go into a
rotary kiln with raw coal (which may
ver y l° w grade) that fires enough
heat to burn out the oxygen from the
iron oxide. What comes out is not iron,
but almost as good and a lot cheaper,
This is instead of the blast-furnace
system of using a high-grade coal and
reducing the ore at 1500 degrees centi-
grade in a shaft furnace,
Hamersley s metallised agglomer-
ates news * ls clearly related to the new
developments in'the iron-ore mining
£ ene announced two weeks ago when
Hamersley agreed to go into a joint
75-25) deal with Hancock and Wright
to evaluate the Hanwright resells
(also in the Hamersley ranges) and for
the deposits Hamersley Iron holds at
Paraburdoo, 35 miles south-east of its-
present mine at Mt. Tom Price.
More and Mawby
SIR MAURICE MAWBY’S address
last week to shareholders of Hamersley
Holdings cleared up several points
raised in last week’s comments concern-
ing the company’s future in The Bulle-
tin mining page.
The first is that the additional pay-
ments of 50 percent of Hamersley’s
profits which were previously called for
under loan agreements with North
American banks will not now be
required. The company will not be
repaying these loans before their due
date, but will take the full seven-year
period.
While this rearrangement of loan
repayments will give Hamersley the
use of an extra million (td spend
on agglomeration and) if necessary, the
Mt. Bruce iron-ore project) over the
next seven years, it means that the pos-
sible interest savings of up to $1.5 mil-
lion per year, referred to last week, will
not take place,
The second point is that our assess-
ment of the extent of the benefit the
company is likely to receive from the
recent High Court decision on taxation
was perhaps optimistic. Although the
actual amount of tax saved will be
considerable in terms of dollars, it
defers by only one year the date on
which the company will become liable
for taxation on profits.
A further point of significance is
that the decision by the company to
commence secondary processing of ore
(apart from pelletising) tends to re-
inforce the suggestion that profit-
ability on a per-ton-of-ore basis will
diminish in the years ahead. Profit per

ton of iron ore has probably not yet
reached its peak, but the costs involved
in both pelletising and agglomeration
will not be insignificant. While these
processed products command a higher
price and carry a freight saving, con-
sumers will hardly be willing to carry
all the costs involved in this processing,
and will presumably be reluctant to
forgo all of the savings involved in
shipping costs. Whereas Hamersley’s
existing contracts for lump ore are at
prices in the region of $8.90 per ton,
the 17.9 million tons of pellets which it
has begun to produce (under which
annual shipments at the rate of of 1.79
million tons will commence next month)
will be at a price of $10.50 per ton.
From this differential of $1.60 per ton
Hamersley has to pay the cost of pellet-
ising, and the margin of profit is clearly
less than the $2.66 per ton earned in
the last quarter of last year from ship-
ments of straight ore.
The moves into secondary processing
of iron ore will undoubtedly place
Hamersley in a very strong .position in
the long run from the point of view of
access to markets. It will give the com-
pany a good edge over competitors
supplying straight iron ore, both from
Australian and overseas sources. At the
same time it also affords Hamersley
some protection against the possibility
of becoming too dependent on Japanese
orders, as the production of agglomer-
ates will almost certainly facilitate the
establishment of the company as a sup-
plier to Europe, and possibly to the
west coast of America.
THE NEW
IRON LINKS
The Hanwright deal
HAMERSLEY STATION homestead
is built of banded hematite, with an
iron content of 35 percent. The door-
stopper at Mulga Downs Station is
made of blue asbestos; and this hunk
of rock was the direct cause of the
blue asbestos industry being set up
pre-war. Lang Hancock’s family own
both these properties in the Hamersley
Ranges, which have become one of the
world’s richest sources of high-grade
iron ore. This heritage, and Hancock’s
subsequent experience in the region, was
behind last week’s announcement of
plans for a joint venture between the
Hamersley Iron partners Rio Tinto-
Zinc Corporation and Kaiser Steel
and the Hanwright partners Lang
Hancock and Peter Wright.
The knowledge that the Fortescue
Valley is the area’s best natural outlet
is the key to the engineering; the know-
ledge that vast areas of iron-bearing
country lie south of Mount Tom Price
and around Wittenoom is the key to
the economics. History was made last
week when Lang Hancock, never before
known to shy away from presenting
staggering facts, would not put a figure
on estimated tonnages within the Han-
wright tenements simply because people
wouldn’t believe him. (This is a fairly
general reaction. Dr. Bill McLeod of
Geological Survey, points out that’the
total figure of 15,000 million tons is
arbitrary: “It’s like asking how much
water is there in Cockburn Sound;
there’s enough to float our ships and
that’s all we need to know ”)
Hanwright have found that their ori-
ginal scheme, as big as it was, has out-
grown their cap J ty , 0 and
run «. In the link with Hamersley, they
- have found a ™y g« going two
'years earlier than they mirfit W other-
wise. The first job T J the
engineering and mining feasibility
studies; these are scheduled to be fin-
ished in September. If these are clear
and the State Government turns the
green light on reasonably quickly, then
the joint venture could be working soon
after next season’s Wet. Said quickly
enough, the ifs of this operation tend

to get lost; nevertheless they are critical
to the whole operation.
Looking at the position optimisti-
cally, as Hanwright do, the 75-mile
railway down the Fortescue Valley
from Wittenoom to Tambray could go
down at 1.2 miles per day. Much of
the mine site construction is laid on at
the Wittenoom township, which
served the blue asbestos industry whose
1966 purchase by Hanwright set of?
the chain reaction that led to last
week’s agreement. From Tambray a
ten-mile spur-line would link with
Hamersley’s Tom Price-Dampier line,
cutting through the Chichester Range
south-east of Midstream. Then the
linking line from the Cape Lambert
end would start, working back to-
ward the spur-line. And the final rail
link would be from Hamersley’s town
of Tom Price back into rough country
around Pirraburdu, 38 miles to the
south, where vast high-grade orebodies
await feasibility studies.
Hanwright stood to lose their leases
if they could not produce the figures
in June. So it is a great advantage
from their point of view that the back-
ing of Kaiser and RTZ will help them
fulfil the terms of their agreement
with the State Government to the
letter. Their first submission was to
have been with the Government on
June 30, and despite optimism that
a sales contract would soon come to
them, all their previous plans were
contingent on landing a 25 million
ton contract over 10 years. In the
first phase of their scheme, they under-
take to spend $7O million setting up
a project capable ultimately of hand-
ling 3 million tons of pellet exports
each year. The tough timetable of
this called for a firm assurance of 10
million tons of pellets to be exported,
starting at 1 million tons in 1972
building up to an annual 3 million
tons by 1977. Metallising (along the
lines of last week’s announcement by
Hamersley) must follow by 1981.
And Hanwright have stressed that the
new arrangement will enable them to
meet all these commitments.
If this program is to be met, then
the forecast of getting under way in
1969, though optimistic, may be neces-
sary. By this time Mount Newman’s
construction program would be over,
with exports scheduled to start in April
of next year. The two schemes would
dovetail nicely; it has been State
Government policy to seek to phase the
big operations as far as possible, avoid-
ing inflationary pressure on labor and
resources. But this makes no allowance
for the Cliffs project, and if looked at
with extreme suspicion the Hanwright-
Hamersley link could be construed as
a way of Hamersley hedging their bets
against Cliffs failing to get off the
ground.
For Hamersley, the deal provides
access to Cape Lambert. If Dampier
is tied up, they can divert their rail
traffic along the ten-mile spur-line near

Hamersley may find it necessary in the

now shows signs of resuming an upward
trend with excellent growth potential.
Since listing in May, 1967, a very steep
3100 percent uptrend was followed to
a high of $7.80. A slower 700 percent
uptrend was resumed after a reaction
resulting in a new high of $9.50 in
November, 1967. A sideways movement
has continued after the fall to $7.40
until the current week, where prices
have risen to $9.20. A short to medium
term target of approximately $l3 is
a distinct possibility once the resistance
level at $9.50 is broken and the overall
picture suggests the possibility of a
“measured move” to $2O. This more
optimistic move will be confirmed as
the trend develops. Last sale price on

THE TABLE below sets out estimated earnings for local goldmining companies
at gold prices of $U.5.52.50, SU.S.7O, and SU.S.iOS (currently $U.5.35). The figures
take no account of any change in earnings from other products, such as copper in
the case of Peko-Mount Morgan. They are simply the effects of a gold price rise
added on to last year’s profits, except in the case of Peko-Mount Morgan, where
combined gold production has been estimated after taking into account higher gold
production from Peko’s Juno mine and low gold production at Mount Morgan.
The present subsidy paid to marginal producers is based not on revenue but on
costs, and it has been assumed that the existing subsidy arrangements will be with-
drawn if the price of gold is increased. We are indebted to Sydney sharebrokers

AN INCREASE in the price of gold has massive implications for goldmining
stocks. For it would bring a far greater proportionate rise in their net earnings,
since there would be no addition to costs at all while gross revenue would soar.
To some extent this would be dampened in the case of those miners receiving the
Commonwealth’s gold subsidy, the removal of which would absorb some ot the
increased earnings. But a 50 percent rise in the present price would multiply
owners’ profits by as much as 11 times; a doubling or trebling would have fantastic
results. There is still a chance it could happen here.
RARE EARTHS
M.K.U.’s nice surprise
RARE EARTHS are not rare and they
are not earths. But they could mean a
lot of money to Mary Kathleen
Uranium. In last week’s annual report
directors indicated that there had been
encouraging results from their investi-
gations into the possibility of recovering
rare earths in their tailings dumps. In
the past year they had spent $40,000
looking into the matter. The immediate
implication of rare earths in the tailings
is that there must also be rare earths
in the unworked orebody.
And if these turn out as profitable
as foreign mining operations of these
minerals, then Mary Kathleen (as at
least one influential Sydney broker
says) may be more valuable as a rare-
earths producer than as a uranium
miner—particularly as they could be
extracted in a process that could also
presumably remove the U2OB from the
orebody at the same time. So far corn-
pany men say that not enough investi-
gation has been done into the tailings
(and none into the orebody), so the
extent of the deposits has not been de-
fined. They also say that although ex-
traction costs may be high, some of
these rare earths are very valuable and
are worth several hundred dollars a
pound,
According to the influential E. and
M. J. Metals and Minerals Market
review, the future of the rare earths
industry is “really beginning to take on

a healthy glow that may suddenly
develop into a fantastic increase in con-
sumption.” And it says that, despite
some stumbling blocks, there is a pros-
pect that rare earths could become one
of the glamor materials of tomorrow.
Rare earths are really metals and are
fairly abundant, being called rare
because the elements were discovered
in scarce minerals. But they are costly
to produce and a deposit would have
to be large and good to make it worth-
while. They have been known for a
long time, but their chemical properties
are so similar that separating them was
too expensive and the only practical
way to buy one rare earth was to buy
them all, which explains why a market
for them has been slow to develop.
Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation, which
indirectly owns 53 percent of Mary
Kathleen Uranium through its 85 per-
cent holding in CRA, dominates the
rare-earth business. A recent copy of
the Metal Bulletin showed that RTZ’s
involvement, which began at Rio
Algom in Canada as a by-product, has
been rapidly expanding in America,
Britain, and Japan in what it calls a
“fast-growing industry.” There is only
one company with whom RTZ is not
aligned that is actively manufacturing
rare-earth products (excluding Misch-
metal, which is used in lighter flints).
If MKU’s deposit proves to be good,.
RTZ may have to make up its mind
whether it wants a 53 percent owned
subsidiary actively competing with its.
own operations in other countries.
The particular rare earths that Mary
Kathleen mentions in its report are
yttrium and europium but company
men say there are also lanthanum and
neodymium and probably others in
the tailings. Europium and yttrium
have done well out of color television;
they are in color television phosphors.
They are used in mercury vapor lights,
and europium is also used in nuclear
energy control rods or fuels. Yttrium
has a potential use as a stabilising ele-
ment in refractory materials.
The europium and yttrium oxide
consumed in each color television set
amounts to only a few grams (1 to 2.
of europium and 15 to 25 of yttrium)

You can be sure of greater reliability from the Timken bearings you’re using
now —exactly as you’re using them now. You can expect to calculate longer
bearing life without paying more for it —or having to make a single design
change.
And in new designs, you can cram the required capacity into a smaller space
and pay less for it in the bargain! Bearing load carrying capacities are now
increased up to 33% on more than 80% of all Timken bearing part numbers.
A load rating increase of 25% more than doubles the calculated bearing life.
How can we be sure? We made improvements in uniform processing, in steel
making, crowned rollers and bearing geometry. And we proved the results
through a worldwide quality audit program, followed by laboratory "life” tests
and confirmed by actual field experience.

RARE EARTHS
and there are 454 grams to a pound,
which costs about $650 for europium
oxide and $5O for yttrium oxide. The
reason europium is so highly priced is
that it takes about 10 tons of ore to
produce one ton of rare-earth con-
centrate, which yields a mere one
pound of europium oxide.
Of the other rare earths, cerium is
used in making modular iron, con-
tinuous cast steel and non-ferrous
alloys, polishing powders for all kinds
of glass, and is a glass decoloriser; in
larger amounts cerium and neodymium
make glass opaque to ultra-violet light,
giving it uses in welders’ lenses, good-
quality sunglasses, and special optical
filters. They also are used in color
television tubes to prevent discolora-
tion. Neodymium (which has applica-
tions in lasers), praseodymium, and
samarium oxide increase infra-red
absorption in glass, and lanthanum
oxide improves the index of refraction.
New uses are being developed for
rare earths; for instance, a year or so
ago a new glass filter plate contain-
ing a rare-earth oxide (neodymium)
was developed to improve the bright-
ness and contrast of pictures received
in color television sets. And the E. &
M. J. Metals and Minerals Markets
review thinks that the market potential
of this new application for neodymium
is significant, as each filter plate takes
about of neodymium oxide (and
in the U.S. alone there are about eight
million color television sets produced a
year).

Tax dodging
and a stake
in masonry
WITH THE END of the financial year
now looming up, it’s time to start think-
ing about tax dodges. Here are a few
(legal, of course) worth considering.
Taking up shares or subscribing to calls
in oil and mining companies is a good
one. The amount paid is usually either
wholly or one-third deductible from
taxable income. Increasing your life-
assurance premiums is also worth while
remember premiums up to $l2OO
are now allowable as deductions. The
shot is to take out a short-term policy
which has a quick build up of surren-
der value and which provides for a
high percentage of this surrender value
to be borrowed back after only two
years. This way you can have your cake
and eat it, too. Admittedly you have to
pay 7 percent for the privilege of
borrowing your money back, but it is
not hard nowadays to get a stock yield-
ing 7 percent and giving capital appre-
ciation as well, plus that the interest
rate is probably peanuts on what you
will save on your tax bill.
A dodge used quite extensively by
professional traders who are classified
as such by the Tax Department is the
old rights issue lark. This is how it
works. Shares are bought when their
price is heavily pregnant with rights to
a forthcoming issue. After the issue, the
shares are flogged ex-rights. The trader
then claims on a loss on turnover.
That, of course, isn’t the end of it.
When the new shares purchased with
the rights are sold, the trader is then
taxed on the difference between the
issue price and the selling price. The
beauty of the system, however, is the
fact that it can reduce a trader’s tax
liability at a time (such as 1967/68)
when prosperity has put him into a
high tax bracket by allowing him to
spread his profits into the following
tax year when his rate of tax may not
be so high. So much for ways of saving
money.
Now for ways of getting it together
in the first place. You may remember
a stock I had in the portfolio last
November, Jaywoth Industries. The
company is in the masonry business
in Sydney and Brisbane. Last Novem-
ber I bought it for 15 cents and sold
it out shortly after for a few cents
profits. However, because the company’s
shares were so cheap I loaded up with
4000 of them and when all those cents
profits were counted up it turned out
to be a very rewarding sort of deal.
The stock now looks as if it’s got a
few cents profit in it again. The reason
is simple its prospects are now
much better than they have ever been
at any time in the company’s past
history. Actually, you may recall from
my November writings that the com-
pany’s history isn’t all that brilliant.
It started off in 1960 and immediately
turned in four years of losses. Things
then improved and the next three years
were all profitable. The profits were
relatively small but they were never-
theless profits. Jaywoth now looks
poised for the breakthrough and the
current year looks like being it! Many
factors point to this:
1. The reorganisation and enlarge-
ment of the Brisbane facilities which
affected profits last year are now bear-
ing fruits and should give profits a con-
siderable boost.
2. The current high level of activity
of the building industry generally
should ensure that all the company’s
plants are working at full capacity.
3. The Chairman’s prediction in
September last year that the first six
months in the current year look like
being the company’s best ever.
4. The subsequent interim report for
the six months to 31st December which
revealed that profits were in fact sub-
stantially higher than those of the
previous year.
5. The increase in the dividend rate
from 4 percent to a minimum of 8
percent.
All these factors, plus the fact that
the company has $520,000 in tax losses
up its sleeve, which means no tax bill
for a year or two, make Jaywoth look a
better than usual bet for both immedi-
ate and term benefits. I once again
loaded up. I bought 5000 at 22
cents and won’t be at all surprised to
see the holding quoted at par (25
cents) or better in the very near
future. I will, however, be most sur-
prised to see them quoted at less than
today’s price for quite some time (if
ever).
It looks as though I made a mistake
several weeks ago when I stated that
Mr. Ken McMahon was a director of
Mining Traders. He in fact resigned
last December.

The Melbourne market
Days of cleansing
and recovery
THE MARKET TAKES a long time
to forget and forgive companies that go
out of the dividend list and its memory
is, perhaps, at its best when considering
textile companies like, say, Yarra Falls
and Davies Coop, which in their day
were the totes of the Stock Exchange.
Davies Coop, of course, is rather a law
unto itself these days, for although it
is doing quite well and pushed up its
earnings, though not by much, in the
latest half year it has the awful thorn
of Viyella’s big shareholding in its side,
so that not much advance on the cur-
rent price of 35 for the 50-cent shares
is to be expected even with the divi-
dend yield showing 11.4 percent on last
year’s 8 percent payment. As we’ve
pointed out before, sterling’s devalua-
tion has increased the cost by 6 cents
a share should Viyella follow its ill-
fated previous offer with another of the
same amount in Australian currency,
and presumably the home front would
get up in arms again if it has a second
try.
Yarra Falls looks a different kettle
of fish altogether. Its $2 shares at $1.28
are rated a shade lower compared to
their par value than Davies Coop’s. It
went out of the dividend list in 1963-64
after having raised its payment from
7 to 8 percent in the previous year and
only returned to it with a modest 4
percent for last year. In the interim,
the company had a most torrid time.
It posted a net loss of $465,000 in
1964- before making a tortuous re-
covery in the two following years with
earnings showing 0.9 and 5.7 percent in
1965- and 1966-67 respectively. The
latter out-turn was hardly good enough
in itself to warrant paying a dividend
again and a payment would presumably
have been deferred had the prospects
not looked so bright to the board. The
profits story last year was only a
$10,158 net result in the first half on
capital of nearly $5 million, followed
by a very good second half of $270,000
(reflecting a substantial uplift over the
whole economy), which boosted net
profits to $282,000 for the full year. In
the background of the 4 percent pay-
ment (made as a final) for the year
was a highly satisfactory order book,
which promised even higher profits this
year. The promise has been fulfilled, at
least thus far. The first half’s profit of
$269,000 (compared with the above
$10,158 for the same half last year)
was announced last week.
Obviously textile shares, though
better regarded now than a year or two
back, look pretty small beer beside all
the minerals goodies in the market’s
offing. But in the case of Yarra Falls,
at least, some capital appreciation in
the shares could be somewhere around,
if not just around, the corner. For not

only |do dividend and earnings prospects
look bright but also, when it sinks in
that the group’s new divisional arrange-
ments, its accelerated obsolescence
program, and its new concentration of
activity schemes (such as the consolida-
tion of modern equipment from the
Bentleigh and Abbotsford mills) are
having just as telling an effect on
profitability as better trading. Again,
$1.6 million of unsecured notes was
received from earnings a few years ago,
and more recently the sale of surplus
assets, writing off redundant plant (how
textile companies love to hang on to
out-of-date plant!), the elimination of
intangible assets, and so forth.
A lot of water may still have to pass
over the falls, especially at Abbotsford,
where the diminished level of the Yarra
might yet mean a curtailment of
operations there, before all this sinks in.
Talking of this sort of ordeal under-
gone by Yarra Falls, it is not so long
ago that Freighters Ltd. was so sick
that a well-known stable of Sydney
company revivers was put to work on
it. A few years ago, one of the partners
of that stable, Mr. K. O. Humphreys,
who had subsequently become chair-
man of Freighters, came down to Mel-
bourne to tell us he’d done an Augean
job on the company. But somehow
this proved to be a premature assess-
ment because setbacks came to postpone
the day of cleansing and recovery.
Last year’s headlines read “dividend
held at 8 percent but not covered.”
Last week’s figures from the company
indicate that possibly a new dawn had
opened because “true” profit was con-
siderably more than doubled in the first
half of this year with a lift on the
corresponding half last year of 122-2-
percent, albeit only a steady 4 percent
interim being declared. For those who
still feel dubious about this form of
showing, the comparison is made (as it
should be) after eliminating the big
sums included in last year’s profit from
revaluation of investments and other
assets. The board would also seem to
have some doubts because the interim
sees profit as having dropped from
$179,280 to $167,771.
Although the chairman is one of Aus-
tralia’s leading accountants, it seemed to
be quite silly last year to have made
good the shortfall of profits to meet
the dividend by using $134,803 of net
proceeds on assets account and $2084
from the general reserves. It would
have been more realistic and sensible to
have cut the dividends. Anyway, it
would take more to pull the wool over
the market’s eyes. For a long time it
has rated the shares near the bottom of
the class. A slightly better view was
taken this week, but the shares are still
among the dunces with a tag of 38
cents. At this price they give a dividend
yield of 10J percent. However, the
sharp rise in “true” net profit in the
latest half looks very good.

When it’s so darned hot that your office is an
oven, your factory a furnace, your staff slows down.
That’s bad. Bad for production and bad for
profits. What to do? Insulate with SISALATION
heat-reflecting aluminium foil insulation.
Inexpensive Sisalation makes summers 15 degrees
cooler and slashes winter fuel bills up to 40%—-
think what this means in terms of improved
productivity. Everyone works better because they’re
comfortable and happy.
When insulating new or existing offices and fac-
tories, build-in the extra comfort and added weather
protection of Sisalation 450. As an added benefit, when
left exposed as a ceiling surface, its high reflectivity
improves light distribution.
Sisalation 450 has qualities no other foil can match:
it’s guaranteed fire-resistant for life and is double-
reinforced for added strength.
A proved method of insulation, Sisalation 450 is
used extensively in factories, schools, warehouses,
and in cold stores operating at sub-zero temperatures.
Before you spend a cent on insulation in your factory
get the straight facts about SISALATION 450.

Behind every great man, there’s a workhorse! MACSQN
In the engineering field, it’s
more often than not a Mac-
son Lathe. Macson is the
eager workhorse behind
almost every successful en-
gineering plant in Australia.
McPherson’s began manu-
facturing Macson Lathes
during World War I. Those
early Macsons satisfied
Australia’s desperate need
for quality machine tools,
but were mainly patterned
on overseas lines. Today’s
models, from the smallest
with its 16 inch swing, to the
largest with a 54 inch swing,
are wholly designed and
manufactured in Australia
by McPherson’s in one of
the world’s most modern
machine tool factories. It
was Macson that helped
make McPherson’s famous
both In Australia and
throughout the world: And
Macson’s high grade perfor-
mance has built many a big
business since.

Security analysis
Hanimex Corporation is a much
misunderstood stock
FAR TOO MANY Australians are'in-
clined to mistrust the nonconformist
and to “knock” what they don’t under-
stand. In the securities world this fail-
ing in character is as prevalent as it is
in other areas of our national life.
Hanimex Corporation Ltd. is one of
the most misunderstood companies
listed on Australian stock exchanges.
The company exports equipment and
components to an annual value in excess
of $2 million (this represents 0.5 per-
cent of Australia’s total manufactured
exports and the value of its exports
is growing at about 10-15 percent a
year); commands a sizable share of
the photographic-equipment business,
not only in Australia but in the United
Kingdom and Europe; is a sizable
international trader in photographic
equipment, selling, for example,
Japanese equipment in England, Ger-
man equipment in the U.S.; and is
now taking on the giant Eastman-Kodak
group, the all-powerful king in photo-
graphic film. A David among Goliaths;
how, you may ask, can an Australian
company succeed in being an inter-
national trading success and still satisfy
shareholders back home? Well, Nicholas
Aspro did it, so did Kiwi, and so is
Hanimex doing it today. Granted, Hani-
mex is an unusual company by the con-
servative and unimaginative norm we
are brought up to deal with in this
country, but why does it deserve its
present stock-market image of doubt
and uncertainty? Here is a glamor com-
pany without a glamor stock-market
appeal.
On a breakdown of company turn-
over by geographic regions, Australia
represents 46 percent, United Kingdom
30 percent, Continental Europe 14 per-
cent (of which most of the sales are
earned in West Germany), and the
rest of the world about 50 countries
takes up the balancing 10 percent.
Selling branches are located in all Aus-
tralian mainland capital cities, includ-
ing Canberra, and at London, Hanover
(West Germany), Toronto (Canada),
Hong Kong; and in October, 1967, a
new branch was set up in Chicago
(U.S.). A 50-percent-owned associ-
ate operates in New Zealand, and there
is a buying-office subsidiary in Japan.
On an employment breakdown, the total
direct payroll is just over 780 76
percent of the staff is located in Aus-
tralia and the balance in the overseas
countries just mentioned. Three fac-
tories are operated by the group -- the
mother factory set on a 21-acre site at
Bcookvale (Sydney), with subsidiary
plants in London and Hong Kong.
In Australia, the composition of turn-
over appears to be divided in this
approximate mix: 60 percent in
amateur photographies that is in
projectors, previewers, still and movie
cameras, lenses, screens, flash equip-
ment, and photographic film; 10 percent
in electricals, which includes magnetic
tape, prerecorded magnetic tape, play
tape, tape recorders, domestic fans,
heaters, and desk lamps; and 30 per-
cent in industrial and office equipment
such as sound-movie projectors, graphic-
arts equipment and materials, copying
machines, including electrostatic copiers,
film-processing equipment, X-ray film,
calculating and adding machines, micro-
film equipment and materials.
Hanimex people now control 40 per-
cent of the Australian photographic-
equipment market (excluding film), 10
percent of the local photographic-film
business, and 10 percent of the local
magnetic-tape market. In 1965 the com-
pany ventured into photographic-film
processing with an agreement with
Perutz (West Germany), and started to
produce reversal color slides. In
October, 1967, operations were extended
to include reversal color film and nega-
tive/positive color prints both in 35mm.
these are made available in both
the Hanimex and Fuji brands
and there is also now a range of Hani-
mex brand Bmm. movie film. Fuji
Photofilm Co. ranks in Japan as No. 1
in photographic film, and is one of the
top international leaders in this field.
Another step forward was in Decem-
ber, 1967, when Hanimex opened a
color-film processing service in Sydney.
This is to tap the lucrative market in
color printing and developing, arising
from amateur photographers leaving
their film for developing with their
family chemists. Whilst the photo-
graphic-film business is dominated by
Kodak, Hanimex is out to capture a
large share, and already ranks equally
in size with the Agfa-Gevaert groups in
Australia in the No. 2 slot in this
industry.
In magnetic tape and prerecorded
magnetic tape (the company has an
agreement with Festival Records for
canned music), Hanimex is the only
Australian producer, and this is regard-
ed as a major growth area. The mag-
netic-tape market is said to be growing
in Australia at about 15-20 percent a
year and the photographic film and
equipment market at about 10 percent
a year. /
In England, Hanimex claim 60-70
percent of the slide-projector market
and 20-25 percent of the overall photo-
graphic-equipment market (excluding
film). In February, 1966, a factory was
opened in London to produce viewers
and projector accessories, and products
from this plant now not only supply the
U.K. market but are being exported to
the European Free Trade Association
countries (mainly Scandinavia and
Switzerland) at the free rate of duties
now applying to photographic products
made in the U.K.
Hanimex’s subsidiary in Japan, Photo
Export KK, operates a buying office
for the group and trades in products
and components produced by up to 50
Japanese companies. This Australian
company has made a lot of money in
climbing on the bandwagon of Japan’s
fast rise to the top in the world of
photographic equipment. In Hong
Kong, the Hanimex subsidiary employs
about 80 people in a factory producing
very good quality lenses, and also trans-
formers for slide projectors.

* In addition to the cash dividend in 1967, a
bonus of stock was made in November, 1967, in
the ratio of 1:10. The combined dividend payout
in stock and cash in 1967 was equivalent to 10.5
cents.
These statistics throw up Hanimex’s
problem over recent years in congesting
its growth in assets and turnover, and
pre-tax profit has wavered with a
falling off in margins in relation to
turnover. According to the company,
the decline in the profit margin to turn-
over was mainly due to an increase in
advertising expenditure. Hanimex cur-
rently spends about 6 percent of its
world turnover on advertising. The de-
cline in pre-tax profit in 1967 largely
came about as a result of difficult trad-
ing conditions in the U.K., but this
position has been rectified. The low tax
to pre-tax profit ratio is widely misin-
terpreted by many observers. Under the
Australian Government’s Export Tax
Incentive Legislation, Hanimex is able
to credit much of its overseas market-
promotion expenses on a double-deduc-
tion basis. This is a very legitimate tax
practice, one which has received Gov-
ernment blessing, and is exactly what
the Government intended under its
Export Tax incentives, first introduced
in 1961, to encourage greater manufac-
tured exports. This legislation has re-
cently been extended and renewed for a
further five years.
At 95 cents the stock offers a divi-
dend yield of 10.5 percent, and the
price-earnings multiple is 5.9. Despite
some difficulty in maintaining an in-
crease in pre-tax profit over recent
years, consistent with the growth in
sales, I think the stock is considerably
undervalued and is currently available
at bargain-basement prices.

AND STATISTICS
Big news brought different responses to BHP and Hamersley;
BHP's doubling of its Bass Strait reserves left it 5 cents cheaper
by the week’s end while Hamersley moved up 65 cents. Gold
stocks all rose sharply during the week but lost some of their
gains on Friday; tin stocks all eased. There was a touch of the
old speculative spirit in the market during the week as mining
rises outnumbered falls by 68 to 30 in Sydney. Takeover stock
Duly and Hansford moved up to within 2 cents of the TRW
bid; newsmakers Lend Lease, Philip Morris and Myer all
improved.

THE LAND
The chequered path to unity
FARMER UNITY is in the air once
again and that air seems likely to be-
come quite clamorous before long. Is
it perhaps rather more than coincidence
that one of the last great waves of
public unity discussions took place when
the previous wool reserve price scheme,
in 1965, appeared to threaten farmers
with a new type of interfering bureau-
cracy? At any rate, round about that
time, the N.S.W. division of the Aus-
tralian Primary Producers’ Union
somewhat surprisingly joined the New
South Wales chamber of the National
Farmers’ Union. Nowadays wool’s
problems are just as obvious, while
drought and devaluation, in addition to
the usual run of complaints, may be
pushing many farmers toward the old
desire “to speak with one voice.”
Not that, in N.S.W., the recently
announced agreement of the United
Farmers and Woolgrowers’ Association
and the Australian Primary Producers’
Union (New South Wales division) to
amalgamate need necessarily expect a
speedy consummation. At present the
agreement rests within a joint com-
mittee of the two organisations; it calls
for full ratification by general councils
and annual conferences. The UFWA
president, Mr. C. D. Renshaw, would
indeed feel happy to anticipate “further
amalgamation of primary producer
organisations, eventually.” He might
also recall one of his general councillors
saying, as late as 1966: “On the present
basis we can’t have an amalgamation. It
would be like combining the Roman
Catholic Church and the atheists. If we
are going to talk to the APPU it should
be on the basis of a takeover, not amal-
gamation.”
Some of those strains might still
exist, so the passage through councils
and conferences won’t be easy. But at
least one of the conditions of the
UFWA councillor now applies: fulfil-
filment of the proposal is apparently to
mean that the State organisation of the
APPU will cease separately to exist.
The amalgamation will thus be called
the United Farmers and Woolgrowers’
Association. Curiously enough, however,
much of the old single-commodity
domination, which has cut across so
many plans for unity in the past, ap-
pears to remain. Admittedly, this is
difficult to overcome with the present
grouping of national bodies. The pro-
posed UFWA, so far as wool and meat
are concerned, is to retail federal affili-
ation with the Australian Wool and
Meat Producers’ Federation; wheat in-
terests will still be affiliated with the
Australian Wheatgrowers’ Federation;
dairy, fruit, and poultry sections of the.
APPU, in their new guise, can oper-
ate “with certain autonomy.”
The selfsame kind of commodity
distinction could also disturb the sweet-
ness and light on the unity talks going
on in Victoria. There, conferences on
federal representation of primary pro-
ducers “on general matters” have
brought together the Australian Wheat-
growers’ Federation, the Australian
Wool and Meat Producers’ Federation,
and the Australian Primary Producers’
Union. A very old aim is being ex-
pressed a federal organisation to
embrace the National Farmers’ Union
and the APPU. The Wheatgrowers’
president, Mr. J. R. Kay, goes so far
as to mention “a harmonious atmos-
phere and considerable agreement.”
One of the pioneer and foundation
members of the Victorian Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Association, Mr. C. P.
Wohlers, is not very cheerful about all
this chatter over grower unity, and
casts strong doubts on its usefulness.
He, himself, had been responsible for
pushing through, in 1933, the inclusion
of woolgrowers in the previous sole
wheatgrowers’ organisation, which then
became the VWWGA. Now Mr.
Wohlers writes with evident feeling: “At
that time I was more interested in
wool than wheat, and I regret to say
that this was the worst service I ever
rendered to both the wheat and small
woolgrowers.”
He goes on to argue: “I believe, in
view of high costs at home and the
uncertainty of overseas trade, rather
than joining up with other branches of
primary industry, the wheatgrower is
in desperate need of a Wheatgrowers’
Association admitting only wheat-
growers.
“I also believe the woolgrower is in
for a bad time. It is proved that his
product can be effectively substituted by
manufactured fibres.
“Rather than amalgamation with
others, representatives of these great
industries should be coming apart to
safeguard their own interests as far as
possible.”
In conditions of individual com-
modity crisis, that type of reasoning
probably exercises as much appeal to
farmers as the power-bait of what a
completely united farmer organisation
could accomplish on the political and
economic fronts. In truth, it has only
been on very general matters (land
taxes, probate, for instance) that farm-
ers have been able to reach quick
agreement in the past. Commodity
affairs have tended to emphasise the
pleas for non-interference by parties not
immediately concerned.
Nevertheless, the drive toward farm-
er unity has taken too much impetus
to be wholly reversed. The goal of
eventually amalgamating the National
Farmers’ Union (a federation of com-
modity bodies and top State organisa-
tions) and the Australian Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union (composed of individual
farmers) acts as a powerful magnet
throughout much of the farming com-
munity. Many of the existing linkages-
and planned co-ordinations have just
this in view. The difficulties are im-
mense, involving as they do a bevy of
marketing boards, research groupings,
and, not least, the Australian Wool
Industry Conference.
Perhaps the best short-term hope is
that farmer organisations could attempt
to abolish a tremendous amount of over-
lapping. That could lead to a much-
needed increase in efficiency. It is not
entirely obvious that one large mono-
lith is to the public interest of our
pluralistic society.

Let's all support water research
LAMENTATIONS, accusations, and
recriminations about water supplies
have been falling faster lately than the
longed-for drought-breaking rains.
For the time being, at least, the issues
have become hopelessly confused and,
until the bickering ceases, any calm
voices capable of directing a construc-
tive approach to our basic national
problem are likely to be completely
drowned out. Water, after all, is our
first necessity, for which man with all
his ingenuity has been unable to devise
a substitute, beer notwithstanding.
Rather more than half Australia’s
population has been directly incon-
venienced by water shortages within
the past three years and the national
income has been seriously curtailed.
Right now, the whole populous area

south of a line from Sydney to Adel-
aide and embracing northern Tas-
mania is parched by the driest year
since records were kept. It is no wonder
that the question of water supplies, at
long last, is raising passions**
But although emotive controversy
rarely solves problems, in this instance
it could achieve great good by arousing
an enduring concern and general
interest in our water resources. Although
all of us have known since about half-
way through primary school that Aus-
tralia is the driest of the world’s large
land masses, almost all of us have pro-
ceeded as if we did not. One might as
well look for star sapphires in Coles as
native gardens adorning our suburban
(and often country) homes. Certainly,
we have done the obvious things—built
dams where the building was easy and
the water seemed plentiful, established
irrigation areas with heavily subsidised
water, sunk tanks and bores more or
less haphazardly, searched out and even
bred some drought-resistant plants,
protected catchments and enacted some
commonsense legislation pertaining to
the ownership of water. We have also
made some monumental goofs, such as
the Ord River Scheme. A few imagina-
tive souls have had a go at rainmaking,
evaporation control, and desalination,
and while some degree of success has
been claimed for these ventures they
have not yet made any practical impact.
If the present critical shortages of
water succeed in creating popular
awareness of the urgent and vital need
for overall planning in the collection,
conservation, and utilisation of our
national water resources the greatest
obstacle to progress will have been
washed away. Public apathy about water
has always occluded the formation of a
national policy and an orderly progres-
sion of development. Under the cir-
cumstances, sectional interests have
never had much trouble in securing
their needs while passing the bill on to
someone else in the community to pay.
However, with public opinion support-
ing the rational exploitation of our
water resources, the next step find-
ing the money to support independent
but mission-oriented research should
not be so difficult. Perhaps it might not
be too much to expect that public water
users, which includes almost every-
body, would follow the example set by
such groups as the woolgrowers and
levy themselves to pay for research.
G.ne cent, say, per thousand gallons
would hardly crush the penny-conscious
wage earner and yet would amount to
a goodly sum enough to give us an
effective Water Resources Research
Institute. Alternatively, the CSIRO
with a little internal reorganisation
might be able to put its finger in the
dam wall and save us all. The CSIRO
has a large Division devoted to Land
Research even though we have an ex-
crescence of land. By now this Division
must surely have mapped and con-
sidered the potential of pretty well
every square mile of terra firma com-
prising Australia and its territories.
Maybe the time has come when it
could switch its emphasis and resources
to the study of water. Such a simple
expedient would not lay further stress
on anyone’s pocket.
With money on tap and a large glam-
orous home established somewhere for
the study of water problems, the third
essential step should follow even faster
than the second, namely, the recruit-
ment of water scientists, engineers, and
economists. Lack of suitably trained per-
sonnel has retarded the development and
efficient utilisation of our water resources
almost as much as the indifference of
the general public, the shortage of
money, and the absence of a national
research centre. It was not until 1963
that we managed to get together a
review of our total water resources. Even
then the accounting contained much
guesswork and has left many gaping
holes still to be filled. Australia was
able to muster only ten papers to pre-
sent at the “Water for Peace” confer-
ence held in Washington last May, and
several of these merely described hap-
penings such as the establishment of the
World Meteorology Centre in Melbourne
rather than report progress in the devel-
opment of our resources or our know-
ledge of them. The U.S., an area still
slightly larger than Australia and in-
comparably better-watered, tendered
some 400 papers at this conference. On
a population basis alone we should
have submitted 20 papers. Our new
Minister for National Development
might look and see whether some of
the brains and money being sucked into
certain currently fashionable pursuits
such as nuclear energy and astronomy
might do more for the general good if
turned into water.
Since its inception in 1955 the Water
Research Foundation has done a sterling
job with the tiny sums at its disposal.
If it could not possibly support a re-
search institute then at least it has col-
lected a library about water and housed
it at Manly, N.S.W. Considerable use is
being made of it and requests for loans
come in from all over Australia and
sometimes from overseas. The original
intention was to found a National Water
Library, but the measly $200,000 needed
could not be raised. The Foundation
also worked hard for a Federal Bureau
of Water Resources, but has had to
settle for an Australian Water Resources
Council, a body with similar status to
the Australian Agricultural Council. It
is still battling to get a small annual
research grant from the Commonwealth.
With the exception of Tasmania and
South Australia, all the other State
Governments provide the Foundation
with some financial support. Neverthe-
less, it has had the use of less than half
a million dollars since 1955 to imple-
ment its blessed aims, which are to pro-
mote and support scientific and tech-
nological research into all aspects of
the efficient use of the water in this
Commonwealth. What could be more
laudable and deserving than that?

Adelaide Festival, Theatre
Failure on a large scale
By ROBERT WARD
AS THEY rush from pre-theatre drinks
to pre-theatre parties, then mingle with
the more respectable artists over post-
theatre drinks and supper at the Festi-
val Club, Adelaide’s matrons and burg-
hers no doubt would solidly maintain
that the Festival was a success, again.
The truth is that the theatre is a
failure, while with most other things
success has depended to a large extent
on the efficiency and taste of the ABC,
the good graces of the Trust, and
the assembled writers’ collective inten-
tion to enjoy themselves at any cost.
It is hard to believe, but after ten
years the only thing the Festival
authorities would seem to have learnt
about plays is how to effect a bigger,
more embracing, more suffocating com-
promise between what they can under-
stand or find politely acceptable and
what they can get producers to pro-
duce. One bright, even laudable, inno-
vation with this Festival was the intro-
duction of commissioned works, and
in theatre this meant Patricia Hooker’s
“The Lotos Eaters” and a children’s
play “The Runaway Steamboat,” by
Eleanor Witcombe. In itself the idea of
commissioning works for a Festival is
excellent. It could be extended beyond
plays to include music, opera, ballet,
paintings, and sculpture. But intellig-
ence, knowledge, experience, and artistic
imagination are needed by the selectors
if only some of the gambles are to work.
And it is a real gamble. No selector
can know what the playwright will write
or what the sculptor sculpt. A case in
point is Miss Hooker’s play, which is a
good try. Her Lotos Eaters are mem-
bers of the “Cargo Dumpers Union,”
and her play could, I suppose, be de-
scribed as a satire on Australian indus-
trial relations. The protagonists are
the Commo union representative, the
anxious young shipowners’ represen-
tative, and the port authority public
servant. The story is concerned with
the desire of the shipowners to load a
shipment of sugar by a deadline, and
with the union’s quite unreasonable
frustration of this aim. The audience is
allowed several belly-laughs and a
number of sniggers at the gross, in-
efficient, big-bellied Australian worker,
the ineffectual public servant, and the
conniving union representative, and
then settles back to be bored about
half way through the first act, or to
watch the stage clock, painted stolidly
at nine-ten, being referred to with
lonesco-like perversity as showing a
dozen other times but that.
Richard Campion’s production
dresses up the play with multifarious
sound effects, “Advance Australia Fair”
at the appropriate ironic moments, and
a great deal of clowning and business
among the Dumpers. The small measure
of cohesiveness the play has is due, I
feel, to his Herculean efforts in this
direction.
“The Runaway Steamboat” is
another failure, and I think this was a
bad idea right from the start. It is
written, I would guess, for an audience
of between eight and 14 years, the very
LEFT , Eleanor Witcombe,
who wrote “The Runaway
Steamboat” for the Festival
ABOVE, Patricia Hooker,
author of “The Lotos Eaters”
years When television asserts on the
young mind adult standards of realism
and when, if theatre is to be enter-
taining, it should be the real thing. It
should not at all be a story of “music-
hall” villains, naughty rich girls, funny
old ladies, warm-hearted boat captains,
seen through an Enid Blyton haze.
Peter O’Shaughnessy’s production
of “The Recruiting Officer” is very
neat and professional, with a style
and swagger peculiarly O’Shaughnessy
and 18th century at one and the same
time. Barry Lovett plays his Kite as a
good-humored, slightly cockney spiv,
while John Norman’s Captain Plume is
a smiling and curiously guileless rake,
and the cast, on the whole, is satisfying
and entirely in command of their parts
and the play. Stan Ostoja-Kotkowski
designed the main set, which is an
excellent town square with boudoir and
drawing-room drops, but the Severn
Side set by an unnamed designer is, by
contrast, a completely uninspired piece
of 19th-century rustic nonsense, with
plaster bird-bath and cut-out canvas
foliage. It marred the production.
Having said that, one must now ask
why the play was selected as a suit-
able Festival production. It is acknow-
ledged as the first play presented in
Sydney, and perhaps that makes it
significant. In this production, the Aus-
tralian prologue and epilogue are
spoken by convicts, and the conceit
is that they also take part in the play.
Thus we have it placed in its local
historical perspective, and I suppose
this is interesting. It’s just that it is
not as interesting, significant, or
valuable to an Arts Festival as Shakes-
peare, Marlowe, Sophocles, or a major
modern play, would have been.
Finally, perhaps the most or
only really exciting theatre presen-
tation at the Festival is that by Frank
Lazarus and Maggie Soboil, two
peripatetic South Africans who pre-
sent a late-night show which they des-
cribe as “an anti-cultural evening.”
Needless to say, the show is put on
independently of the official Festival
at Theatre 62. They are both highly
intelligent and talented classical actors,
and in their translation from straight
theatre to revue they display comic
technique of an exceptionally high
order.
In their present show there are four
sketches, “Adam and Eve,” “Nursery
Rhymes for Adults,” “The Legend of
She,” and “Hello Macbeth.” The last
could be subtitled “Salad Shakespeare,”
since in to it they have packed every
musical cliche on Broadway and every
labored quotation since the First Folio,
and in performing this they create
what must surely be one of the best
send-ups in theatre history.


Adelaide Festival, Opera
Half-baked “Don Carlos”
By JOHN CARGHER
Don Carlos. Verdi. Tannhauser. Wag-
ner. Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera
Company. Her Majesty’s Theatre,
Adelaide.
HALF A LOAF is better than no loaf.
Unfortunately, the half-loaf “Don
Carlos” presented by the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust to Adelaide Festival
audiences was also half-baked. All the
ingredients for success are present, but
they cannot be brought to fruition in the
existing setting and the unimaginative
production. It’s all very well to stage a
spectacle opera of this kind because a
cast able to sing it is available. Saving
costs by using the same setting with
very minor alterations for seven scenes
of wildly different character is quite
another matter. It is asking too much
of any audience to imagine two differ-
ent garden scenes (which follow each
other!) consisting of the same floor-to-
ceiling giant wire mesh cut-outs and
nothing else at all! And burning heretics
at stakes without any inflammable
materials in sight is absurd.
Perhaps we should be grateful for the
opportunity to see and hear “Don
Carlos.” It belongs squarely in Verdi’s
middle period, after the lively tuneful-
ness of Rigoletto-Traviata-Trovatore
and before his last two great master-
pieces. Uneven as it is, “Don Carlos”
contains a tremendous amount of mag-
nificent music, and it has a far above
average dramatic content. For once the
complicated plot, based on Schiller’s
play of the same name, is peopled with
characters whose motives we can under-
stand. The love of a man for the step-
mother who was once promised to him
in marriage is interwoven with a story
of self-sacrificing friendship and politi-
cal chicanery involving the self-deter-
mination of Spanish-occupied Flanders
in the time of the Armada. At present
neither cast, conductor, or producer
John Young can bring any of this to
life. The characters persistently address
themselves to the audience, and the
lengthy recitatives are sung in Italian
without any idea of their meaning until
Verdi’s flesh-and-blood images resemble
little more than a flock of chickens aim-
lessly running around in their ever-
present wire cage.
Nevertheless, most of the cast sing
and act well enough to show that the
half-loaf they are aiming at could end
up as quite a tasty sandwich. Neil
Warren-Smith rises magnificently to the
occasion.
It was not possible to judge Lauris
Elms’ vocal potential as Eboli, as she
appeared to be indisposed. Dramatically
she made this noble villainess into a
sneering conniver, thereby undermining
the effectiveness of her final scene of
contrition. Rosemary Gordon continues
to improve season by season. She may
never become a great actress, but she
acquitted herself very well indeed
vocally and succeeded in obtaining the
right kind of sympathy for the tragic
queen torn between love and loyalty.
An almost identical assessment may be
made of Alexander Major, an all-
purpose baritone who tried valiantly to
bring the lily-white nobility of friend
Rodrigo to life and almost succeeded.
The casting of leading singers in minor
roles was a happy idea and produced a
startlingly good Page in the form of
Maureen Howard. Wasted talent, it
could be said; yes, but what a pleasure
after the usual squeaking novice from
the chorus trembling in her ill-fitting
shoes!
There remain a strength and a weak-
ness. The role of the ancient blind
Grand Inquisitor is an important one;
in fact, he dominates in and also behind
the action. Using the remnants of a
once-beautiful voice, Alan Light was
superbly impressive in the role, a stroke
of casting genius. Unfortunately the
problem of the title role is less simple.
Don Carlos has the largest role and a
most difficult one, since he has no fam-
ous arias or set pieces or even oppor-
tunities to shine dramatically. Even the
best of tenors have been known to leave
but little impression as Carlos. Reginald
Byers is not the best of tenors. He has
a fine voice with a ringing top which,
unfortunately for him, was endowed by
nature with a timbre which went out
with Fernando de Lucia. Once upon a
time Mr. Byers might have been greatly
admired; today his lachrymose singing
strikes us as painful. He has obviously
been taught by one of those teachers
who preach “relaxing of the muscles of
the body” while singing. This means in
practice a slackening of the knee;, .very
time a high note approaches, and leaves
an impression of spinelessness sadly out
of keeping with the noble figure of Don
Carlos.
It would be unfair to criticise the
chorus, which was often joined by the
principals, in failing to make contact
with Robert Feist in the orchestra pit.
While his efforts down there were far
from bad, he failed to produce the drive
and urgency which are needed to bring
a Verdi opera to life.
“Tannhauser” is unexpectedly suc-
cessful. Stephan Beinl’s production
moves well, the scenery is modern yet
identifiably what Wagner asked for,
the costumes by Kenneth Rowell are
superb, and the cast more than
adequate. In the hands of Carlo Felice
Cillario the orchestral playing and the
extremely difficult ensembles on stage
come to life brilliantly. One can no
longer plead inexperience for the
Trust’s orchestra; after this we know
that it is a major musical unit which is
just as good as the man at the helm.
Ken Neate has returned to play
Tannhauser. He looks the part, he acts
it very well indeed, and he has the
right voice for it, though it is disfigured
by a pronounced tremolo. Marcella
Reale has succeeded in mastering that
previously uncontrollable vibrato, and
makes an appealing Elisabeth in spite of
the use of silver nail polish in
medieval Germany! Raymond Myers’
voice cuts magnificently through the
crowd scenes, but he fails to bring any
character to Wolfram or his evening
star, and Morag Beaton’s Venus proves
again that she is by far the best resident
soprano Australia possesses.
South Africans Maggie Soboil and
Frank Lazarus have been the hit of the
Adelaide Festival fringe. They are pre-
senting a late-night show there. They
have been in Perth and will go on to
Sydney

Adelaide Festival, Art
Scrutiny rather than involvement
By ELWYN LYNN
Adelaide Festival Exhibitions. Art
Gallery of South Australia.
Llewellyn Gallery. Art School of South
Australia.
NOT SO STUNNING as of yore, the
collections of the fifth festival at the
South Australian Gallery invite scrutiny
rather than involvement and provide
for our divided generations, those who
prefer the even tenor lingering over
Sickert and George Lambert, the latter
showing a rare, sharp immediacy of line
in a 1918 sketch, Outside the AIF
Headquarters, Cairo. Lambert was best
when outside officialdom, as his fine
landscape sketches prove; his war scenes
(think of Paul Nash in comparison) are
overconcerned with anecdotal exactness
and his portraits grew too sweetly flam-
boyant.
Praised for tolerance of modern art,
Lambert became rather indulgent about
his own, but he and others could hardly
be indulgent about the dull decorative-
ness of the 33 French tapestries from
Aubusson (three by Andre, five by
Fumeron, 25 by Mategot); only Mate-
got’s Kowloon having that structural
vibrancy and positive intricacy that is
our substitute for Gothic and Renais-
sance unfolding narratives and alle-
gories. There is nothing as good as
Sydney’s Lurcats at the Art Gallery of
New South Wales and Anzac House
or the Le Corbusier and Vasarely at
Australia Square. Seen again, Coburn’s
In Praise of the Sun is a little too
heraldic and Plate’s and Schlicht’s,
woven in time for the festival, while
teaching the French something of focal
emphasis, don’t take enough advantage
of the medium; Plate’s remain paint-
ings, but Schlicht’s Trice is lyrically
gay about dispersed scalloped shapes.
The Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Flemish,
German, and English 17th-century
drawings from the De Witt Collection
are concerned with similar simplifica-
tion, but the essences they seek are
psychological. The thin, melting lone-
liness of Lodivico Carracci’s Holy
Family, the wispy trees of De Bisschop’s
avenue, the auriferous bistre stains in
Paul Bril’s Rocky Landscape, and the
fading, dotted hills and unkempt trees
in Breughel the Elder’s Panoramic
Landscape are about serenity or a
tamed ruggedness. Areas of Collot’s
stalwart, tiny figures fade into the white
eternity of the paper and Giovanni
Grimaldi’s walled town on a formidable
hill renders the atmosphere untroubled
and auspicious. The tumult of dashing
lines and stains in Van Dyck’s Brazen
Serpent is balanced by Saenredam’s
faded blue geometry in a church
interior. Though there are no master-
pieces, the 62 drawings, intimate in
scale and touch, offer infinite pleasure.
Walter Richard Sickert was after the
intimate, unposed life, but apart from a
few last colorful pieces brought a
Manetesque gloom to his worship of
Degas and a love of smudged paint as
vehicle of atmosphere to the homage
of Whistler. He wraps his houses, like
those in La Grande Duquesne, in
muted, balmy gloom, but forms always
assert a modern, frontal pressure.
There is no equivocation in the splen-
did show of fifteen Australian potters
from Marea Gazzard’s rotund monu-
ments to the primacy of clay to Wanda
Garnsey’s orthodoxy; the magisterial
and poetically glazed pots by Hughan
certainly contrasted with Bill Gregory’s
pop-colored ceramic designs on glass,
Ron Rowe’s Surreal tubular circles on
cylinders, and Milton Moon’s cylinders
exploding into strange growths. The
idea of bringing these potters and
Levy, Blakeborough, Derek Smith,
Weston, and the Englunds together is
one that could be repeated.
No such singleness informs the col-
lections of contemporary German and
Nordic Art, coping with the problems
of the aftermaths of action painting in
ways so different from post-painterly
abstraction. The Germans, along with
Arthur Boyd, must wait until next week;
the Nordic painters, apart from some
like Finland’s Auguston with his large,
cool teardrops on pale blues and Mor-
tenson’s flat wood reliefs on seven
identical cheese boards, like a quietly
desperate informalism, a controlled
chaos as in the really accomplished
Carl-Henning Pedersen with pale blue
animals and humans, done flatly in
curves and sharp angles cavorting in the
ultramarine sea. You’d expect some
Strindberg-Munch-Ibsen angst and you
get it with Shantz’s landscape seemingly
being peeled of the earth, in his coat-
torso on a coathanger and Teleman’s
bas-relief face emerging from the
wallpaper and bearing the floral design
as its skin. Even in Langmyr’s Pollock
abstractions and Bakken’s stained paper
collages, introspection prevails. Few
national characteristics are discernible,
but fceland’s Gudjonsson puts the issue
succinctly in the fine catalogue of all
the exhibitions: “national characteristics
in art are going or gone—individuals
and their differences still remain.” (Yes,
Iceland.)
Franz Kempf at the Llewellyn is an
individualist w'ho places themes above
technical virtuosity in a series of aqua-
tints and richly luminous watercolors,
the latter combining a Chagallian fan-
tasy with cubist deployment. His prints,
with their velvety blacks, ecstatic move-

his craft which so beautifully meshes
forms.
The Esso Australia-wide student is
vital and heartening: like the Germans
and the Nordic artists, these students
don’t think color-field painting is the
only salvation. The winning prize by
Ross Anderson combined visceral forms
with hard-edge, just as did John Firth-
Smith in winning the Young Contem-
poraries in Sydney.
It’s the eclectics’ answer to purism.
Pamela Miller, fellow winner with An-
derson, combined formal crispness with
scarlet Tworkov vibrance, and the
variety continued in arresting collages
by Stephanie Ambroziak, John Neeson,
and Mervyn Coles, a glowing Fauvist
interior by Peter Dawson, some curious
clues cast on an empty surface by Jenni-
fer Yelland, a first-class optical work by
Korytnyi, and a strange lion-headed
man in a Hockney decor by James
Allen. Nothing as good as Margaret
Worth, Watkins, Johnson, or Firth-
Smith in Sydney’s Young Contempor-
aries, but far more heady diversity. The
news is that there are no uniformly
brain-washed students around.
Films
Black and White
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Hurry Sundown. Director, Otto
Preminger.
Woman Times Seven. Director,
Vittorio de Sica.
“THE GOOD ended happily, the
bad unhappily. That is what fiction
means.” So, in “The Importance Of
Being Earnest,” does Miss Prism com-
fortably sum up the technique of
novel-writing. Since I haven’t read
Gilden’s book “Hurry Sundown” I
can’t say whether he works on this
principle, but Otto Preminger and his
scriptwriters are all for it; the nasty
people get their come-uppance, and
the nice ones are rewarded in the end,
though they may have gone through
hell on the way there.
Preminger frequently chooses sub-
jects for his movies on modishly con-
troversial subjects, but since his social
conscience is never as strong as his
desire for box-office success, he’s care-
ful not to make his arguments too edgy
or thought-provoking. Here the ques-
tion of racial prejudice it’s set in
the deep South in the late 1940 s
is never honestly discussed.
Preminger won’t allow any subtle-
ties of characterisation. He sees every-
thing in black and white but, as it
were, the other way round: every
Negro is a noble soul only showing
momentary anger after ill-treatment
that would try the patience of a
saint, whereas whites are corrupt and
bigoted, or at best cowardly or stupid,
Perhaps this was to ensure the film’s
acceptance below the Mason-Dixon
line, since even the deepest Southerner
can feel comfortably that at any rate
he’s not as bad as these caricatured
white villains.
Technically, of course, the film is slick
enough, prettily colored in a postcard-y
way and with plenty going on in the
way of love-making, dynamiting, sudden
death, and even the standard courtroom
scene. Jane Fonda struggles gamely to
make sense of a muddled character, but
Michael Caine, grossly miscast, is too
busy keeping his accent from slipping to
do much acting. As for Faye Dunaway,
we’ll have to wait for “Bonnie And
Clyde” before we can say whether she’s
really the star discovery of 1968.
Since Vittorio de Sica is an extremely
good actor, it seems a pity that he will
spend time on direction, at which he’s
not at all adept. His extravagances and
overemphasis are particularly jarring
when applied to a trifle like “Woman
Times Seven,” which demands a grace-
ful wit and style to make it all worth-
while. „
It’s a series of unrelated and mainly
pointless anecdotes, in which occasional
funny gag or bright performance seems
better than it is from sheer rarity value.
Shirley MacLaine is an engaging girl,
but not up to carrying a valueless film
on her own, and for all her undoubted
talent she really needs directorial dis-
cipline. “I’ll yell as much as I like!” she
cries to a fellow-player during one
sequence. Unfortunately Vittorio de
Sica has let her do just that.
Theatre
Beckett with a bite
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Old Tune. Samuel Beckett.
Viaduct, Melbourne.
USUALLY A REVIEW seems com-
pletely out of place with a Samuel
Beckett play. After the final curtain it
might be more seemly to pen an
obituary. In Beckett’s writing we hear
the world-ending whimper of Eliot’s
prophecy.
What, then, makes Beckett so damned
entertaining? Even Johnny Speight, the
cockney author of “Till Death Us Do
Part,” is grateful for his influence. It
is surely that Beckett is the ultimate
and funniest gallows-humorist sort of
Chaplin of the last laugh. Life is empty
and even obscene, so let’s shrug it off
with a sardonic snicker.
Actually “The Old Tune” goes
further and ventures a bleak smile.
While the play is consistent with
Beckett’s hostility to life, it is strangely
amiable toward people. But, then, the

play is an adaption from a work by
Robert Pinget, and isn’t listed in
Beckett’s bibliography.
It concerns an aging barrel organist’s
reunion with an old friend. For almost
an hour the two dilapidated comrades
sit and warm themselves by the glow
of their memories, arguing over names,
places, and dates but in complete
agreement as to the nastiness of the
modern world. Their blood quickens as
they reminisce over some busty girl-
friends and freezes as the traffic
thunders by their bench.
Stanley Page has shown considerable
courage in choosing this bleak comedy
for lunchtime theatre. It would be
hard to imagine a play less likely to
form queues at a box-office. But if he
has lacked an audience, at least he’s
had the satisfaction knowing that the
production was fine. The old men were
played by Michael Howley and Frank
Bren, and I’m ashamed to admit I don’t
know which was which. However, the
man with the barrel organ was very
good, while his frog-voiced friend in
the flannel singlet was nothing short
of brilliant. The season of lunch-hour
plays continues with scenes from Law-
rence Housman’s “Victoria Regina,”
with Michael Howley and Bev Dunn.
I expect to be able to tell them apart.
Perth Festival
Quiet fade-out
By DUNCAN GRAHAM
PERTH’S 16th Festival faded quietly
out of existence. The final two weeks,
following some excellent early theatre,
were notably anticlimatic with the ex-
ception of Lucero Tena and her com-
pany of flamenco dancers.
Miss Tena, making her first appear-
ance in Australia, was billed as the
world’s foremost castanet player, a
rather nonsensical claim. However, she
upgraded the lowly castanet to the
status of a musical instrument with
extraordinary skill that added another
dimension to her rhythmic, colorful,
and precisely co-ordinated dancing. Her
company suffered from comparison with
Miss Tena, and the program could do
with some adaptation to Australian
audiences.
The Zagreb Soloists did not arrive
they were struck by sickness —and were
replaced by the Jerusalem Chamber
Orchestra. The Jacques Loussier Trio
and four Australian Composers’ Work-
shops filled the music program. Judith
Wright looked in to talk poetry twice
but somehow didn’t reach the people.
But the people, in crowds of 6000 and
more, took their music and other enter-
tainments less seriously or had it
presented more flamboyantly - and
thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
A local bank sponsored four, free
open-air concerts in a central city park
and did not make the mistake of using
amateur performers. Music to suit all
brow levels was provided and
thoroughly appreciated by the relaxed,
casually dressed audiences who lounged
around the grass.
Last year 156,000 people attended
more than 50 attractions, including
films. This year’s figures are not yet
available, but assuming they are similar
and that the average festival-goer
attends about five events, then only
30,000 of a State population of 900,000
are being reached.
Official promises were made this year
that the W.A. University will give up
festival control to anyone willing and
competent to run it: Eastern States
entrepreneurs please note. It is a won-
derful thing that Perth, busy with
industrial progress, has time and a
place for culture; it would be better
still if more were involved.
Adelaide Festival , marionettes
Miniature Mozart
By JOHN CARGHER
Salzburg Marionette Theatre. Norwood
City Hall, Adelaide.
THE REFINEMENTS of European
culture are not limited to the obvious
arts. Miniature variations have tradit-
ions which are just as valid as those
of music, painting, or sculpture and
the best of these keep abreast of the
times along with their bigger brothers.
The most impressive thing about the
Salzburg Marionettes is not their sup-
erbly lifelike manipulation but the
modern scenic design, which is a model
any major theatre would find hard to
equal.
There is a direct tradition of oper-
atic puppetry in Salzburg going back to
the 18th century, but the company now
visiting Australia was established in
1913 by the father of Hermann Aicher,
who now provides his own developing
tradition which ideally weds the past
to the present. By using first-class re-
cordings of known Mozart operas, the
dramatic content of the evening takes
care of itself and only the visual aspect
needs interpretation. Professor Aicher
has wisely decided that facial expres-
sions of puppets singing opera cannot
but end as caricatures of life. He solves
the problem by increasing the size of
puppets, stage, and settings until an ap-
proximation of a fully detailed stage
picture is attained and peopled by char-
acters which move uifder the direction
of an experienced opera producer. The
whole thing is then placed well back
from the audience, leaving the impres-
sion that one is watching live opera
from the back of the gallery. While
there is strain at first to discern detail
which is not there, the realism of the
figures’ physical movement is such that
one actually imagines facial movement
taking place, though there is none.

Zoe to rhyme with show
From ROBERT FELDMAN in New York
AT AN AGE and in a condition when
she can still enjoy it, Zoe Caldwell has
reached her prime. Still short of her
35th birthday “And with all me own
teeth, luv” the Melbourne actress
has made it very big on Broadway.
Her play, a hit, is almost guaranteed
to run a year; she is earning a whop-
ping big salary, coyly stated to be “in
four figures”; American fans argue
whether her name is pronounced Zo,
Zoey, Zo-uh, or Zo-ay (it properly
rhymes with “show”); she is stylishly
pursued in print by the New York
“Times’ ” drama desk; limned by the
news-weeklies; her somewhat indiscreet
love life becomes a matter of inter-
national titillation (she is slightly rope-
able over that); a Press agent is on hand
to limit Press interviews to 20 a week;
when she develops a throat tickle, her
management puts in a call for the
same specialist who treats President
Johnson; she whinges about the high
rate of taxation.
In short, Zoe Caldwell is a star.
More than just a pretty face and
figure, she is an actress who will be
around prominently for a long time,
barring marriage, childbirth, retirement
to Australia, or other calamity. All this
is a long way from the lean and hungry
days of repertory in Australia and of
working in places like Manitoba (“I’m
very large in Manitoba”). It is farther
still from Melbourne’s, Methodist Ladies’
College, where Zoe never had a teacher
remotely like the one whose fascinating
pathology she illuminates on the stage
of the Helen Hayes Theatre eight times
a week.
Zoe’s vehicle to stardom is a virtual
one-seater, a tour de force for the star
alone. “The Prime of Miss Jean
Brodie” was originally written by
Muriel Spark as a novel centring on a
spinster teacher in a Scottish girls’
school in the 19305. It has been adapted
for the stage by Jay Allen, an Ameri-
can. It opened first in London last
year with Vanessa Redgrave in the
starring role. The broadway premiere
was in January. The bravas, from
critics and audiences alike, haven’t
stopped since.
“The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie” is
a play about schoolgirls and their
bizarre teacher that few schoolgirls will
be permitted to see. Jean Brodie is
hardly a Miss Chips.
“Give me a young gel [sic] at an
impressionable age,” Miss Caldwell
burrs, in a Scottish, accent slightly tinged
with Australian, “and she is mine for
life.” She tells the girls they are “la
creme de la creme,” and has them
singing “Traviata” and discussing
sexual intercourse.
The teacher successfully flouts
authority, in the person of the head-
mistress played by Lennox Milne. She
rises magnificently when asked to
resign because of alleged misbehaviour
with a male teacher. She will not resign.
“You shall have to assassinate me.”
But in the second act we come to
see that Miss Brodie is really just using
others to nourish her delusions and
risk the romantic acts which she her-
self does not dare attempt. Although
she refuses to carry on a love affair
with a married art teacher, she pro-
cures one of her nubile students in her
place.
She is finally dismissed, “assassin-
ated.” “I think I am past my prime,”
Miss Brodie says sadly at the final
confrontation, which she loses. We don’t
know whether to rejoice or cry.
The role calls for a tremendous range
of moods and emotions. Zoe, an actress
whose technique and power may be un-
matched on the English-speaking stage
today, carries it all off very nearly.
The shortcomings have not escaped
her, however. One of these is a ten-
dency to take off on the character, to
satirise it through exaggeration. “I
didn’t read all my notices, only those
with adverse criticism,” she said, in an
interview conducted in her shoebox
dressing-room (no star on the door,
only a scrawled “Miss Zoe Caldwell”).
“I don’t have to read my praises, like
some smug, toffee-nosed star. I know
I’m good, but I can become better.”
What’s it like being a star? “I just
work harder. Listen, luv, in my terms
I’ve been a star a long, long time. It’s
not just a matter of billing and salary.
When you’ve played St. Joan, when
you’ve done Cleopatra with Chris.
Plummer, when you’ve played the
Adelaide Festival that’s when you
feel like a star.”
Stardom does, however, bring the
problem of taxes. As an Australian citi-
zen (“I’ll never give that up”) Zoe has
a full 30 percent of her salary chopped
off at the top, before the regular
deductions. American Actors’ Equity
takes another five percent to punish
her for being a non-resident alien. After
agent’s and other fees, she is left with
less than one-third of her salary. But
she is saving on rent of which more
later.
The endless Press interviews are a
bore, too. “When I get tired of saying
the same things, I just invent some
new ones,” she confessed, chirping like
a schoolgirl. “I’ve just got the reporter
from ‘Home Furnishings Daily’ be-
lieving that I spent all my holidays on
sheep stations in the outback. I gave
her a very imaginative picture of the
construction of country houses. That’s
better than telling her I was behind
the perfume counter at Myers, isn’t it?”
Then she added bitterly: “What’s
the difference? They \lon’t write what
I tell them, anyway.”
The allusion was to Miss Caldwell’s
private life, a domain which, chiefly as
a result of her own candor, has added
a certain spice to the published accounts
of her career. Even the good, grey
New York “Times” unbent to mention
that she had had five major love affairs,
“among them an Australian guitar
maker and several leading men in the
theatre (in 1961 when she was playing
Bianca to Albert Finney’s Cassio in
‘Othello’ at Stratford-on-Avon, she
was named co-respondent in his wife’s
divorce suit).”
Zoe does not deny that she is “very
much in love, luv,” with her producer,
Robert Whitehead. An eminence on the
theatrical scene since the war, the
Montreal-born producer has run up a
fabulous string of hits. His first major
achievement, in 1947, was in bringing
another Australian star, Judith Ander-
son, to Broadway to do the risky
modern version of “Medea” (by Robin-
son Jeffers).
Recently Zoe told an Australian
interviewer that, if she married any-
one, “it will be Bob.” Evidently, she
regretted that slip, because she has
refused to repeat it or say anything
further on the subject.
“Actors spend so much time in the
spotlight, in the land of make-believe,
that when it comes to the private
things we like to underplay,” Zoe told
me. “After all, I’m not the girl in the
bakery shop whose one opportunity to
shine in her life is her wedding.
“But when it’s time to settle down
with my children, no question.” Then
her eyes went slightly out of focus.
“Dear God,” she said, “please let me
have a child.”

One of the world’s super-nuts
By JAMES McAULEY
Teilhard de Chardin: A Biography.
Robert Speaight. Collins. $5.65.
Teilhard de Chardin: A Guide to his
Thought. Emile Rideau. Collins.
$7.35.
WHY THE FRENCH should be so
good at it, I don’t know; but Teilhard
de Chardin and Claude Levi-Strauss are
now chief purveyors to the reading class
of pseudo-illumination by the use of
trendy mod metaphors. We have only
McLuhan to pitch for the Anglo-
Saxons.
When Teilhard was taken to see the
de Chardin ...“ totalising” people
nuclear research centre at Berkeley, the
huge cyclotron immediately became a
metaphor. With his seer’s eyes he saw,
in place of the cyclotron, his own in-
vention, the Noosphere, as a huge
machine for processing you and me,
dear reader, in order to produce the
“ultra-human.” This vision gave him a
deep-seated calm and joy, which I am
unable to share.
Teilhard stands in a long line of
super-nuts beginning with Joachim de
Flore. Their characteristic is that they
know which way the world is going
namely upwards into a totalitarian para-
dise, where automatic unanimity will
prevail, because those who are not with
it will no longer be with us. The ascent
to this higher level necessarily involves
the elimination of recalcitrant and
retarded elements.
In Teilhard’s system, those who be-
lieve in “progress” will be separated out
as a controlling elite, while unbelieving
elements like Pius XII and Gilson and
Maritain and Medawar will be dis-
carded, in favor of people like Julian
Huxley, U Thant, and Roger Garaudy.
To hear him tell it, the idea does
not sound as crude as this; but if that
is not the practical meaning then I
don’t know what he means. The “cari-
cature” of his thought which I will
be accused of making is the real up-
shot of it.
How is the elimination of the unfit
to be effected? No doubt the grand
laws of “evolution” work inexorably,
but a “leetle” assistance from the en-
lightened elite is included. Medical and
biological manipulation of the human
raw material is apparently acceptable:
eugenic measures, and even brain opera-
tions, may be appropriate, so long as
performed by the right people.
Teilhard saw no hope in our vulgar
democracy. He welcomed Fascism
in 1937 not unreservedly, but never-
theless as “a fairly successful model of
the world of tomorrow” and “a neces-
sary phase during which men would
learn, like an exercise, their metier as
human beings.” So long as the move is
toward “totalising” people, the kind of •
totalisator is of secondary importance.
Like many fastidious persons, he was.
not too fastidious about mass treat-
ment.
Needless to say, after the war, Teil-
hard saw his super-neo-Christianity
inevitably merging with Communism to
create a higher Marxo-Christianity. His
“reasoning” is typical: it is because “in
the nature of things everything that is
faith must rise, and everything that
rises must converge.” This is the sort
of remark that makes Ouspensky look
like an amateur. Teilhard’s emblem
should be an oojah bird, with “the
higher the fewer” on a scroll held in
its claws.
It is one of the ironies that this
enthusiast who wanted to congeal the
whole of humanity in his comprehensive
scientoid fantasy should think he was
conducting a battle against “integrism”
in the Catholic Church. If “integrism”
is the attempt to turn Christianity into
an ideology by identifying it with one
particular socio-cultural outlook or pro-
gram, Teilhard is the integrist-as-
progressive opposed to the integrist-as-
conservative.
Robert Speaight’s biography of Teil-
hard is very good. He is lenient to the
point of indulgence in regard to Teil-
hard’s intellectual oddities and muddles,
so that a hasty reader might think that
he has passed over the problematical
aspects. But he has carefully respected
the facts.
What he brings out is the integrity
of character, the purity of motive, the
candor, the physical and mental cour-
age of the man, who is so much finer
and greater than his monstrosity of a
system. The best witnesses to his
personal quality are his most effective
intellectual opponents, Maritain and
Gilson, who make a point of distin-
guishing between his personal sincerity
and the confusion or worse of his ideas.
Such a paradox can only be resolved by
conceding to him an exceptional
amount of naivete, for which there is
abundant evidence.
The other thing that needs to be said
is that Teilhard’s dottiness does not
necessarily invalidate the core of per-
sonal “vision” from which he started.
That moment in the Chinese desert in
1923 when, lacking bread and wine
to celebrate the eucharist, he conse-
crated the visible world in a kind ol
“mass upon things” is an authentic
gleam.
For addicts and critics alike, Emile
Rideau’s compendium of Teilhard’s
thought is useful. Again, many of the
problematical aspects are fairly repre-
sented. Personally, I would rather read
the homespun Samuel-Smiles-like
thought of Mao -in the little red book;
it is shorter, less ambiguous, and less
muddled with sub-poetic rhapsody.
Inside Nabokov
By R. G. HOWARD
Nabokov: His Life In Art. Andrew
Field. Hodder and Stoughton. $7.00.
NABOKOV’S NARRATIVE tricks no
doubt often leave the average reader
feeling nervous and confused their
effect on the critic (and reviewer), who
has to press still further into the
Nabokovian hall of mirrors, can be even
more disturbing. Constantly on the look-
out for hidden traps and hidden mean-
ings, he is liable to suffer energetic
hallucinations.
It would be going too far to describe
Andrew Field as hallucinated, but he
certainly does spend a lot of time devis-


ing solutions to what are surely non-
existent problems. Most relevant here
are those narrative tricks involving the
narrator’s own identity. There are two
clear-cut examples of the trick I mean.
The mysterious Smurov in “The Eye”
turns out to be none other than the
narrator himself (to no one’s surprise),
and similarly, but for different reasons,
Fyodor, in “The Gift,” writes about
himself in the third person, with fre-
quent lapses into first. For these par-
ticular tricks Nabokov has ample
justification, and it is also worth noting
that the tricks are quite open-handed.
Now it is not obvious, nor is there any
literary justification for the theory, in
my opinion, that “The Real Life of
Sebastian Knight” is written by
Sebastian himself, as Field maintains.
It is even less reasonable to suppose, as
he does, that “Invitation to a Behead-
ing” is written by its hero, Cincinnatus.
Field also maintains that Smurov is not
mad, but is an exceedingly wily artist
pretending to be mad for the purposes
of his art. The same interpretation is
given to Hermann’s madness (in “Des-
pair”), and even to Humbert Hum-
Vladimir Nabokov. .. selfconscious
anguish
bert’s. (I cannot help thinking of Oscar
Wilde’s question about the critics of
“Hamlet.”) Other considerations apart,
these hypotheses reduce nearly all
Nabokov’s novels to one formula.
“Pale Fire” will be accepted by any
reasonable reader as the product of
two quite distinct men John Shade
(the poem), and Charles Kinbote (the
commentary). Nevertheless, some have
maintained that Kinbote is actually
author of both commentary and poem.
Field rightly dismisses this claim
(though it would fit his artist-pretend-
ing-to-be-mad theme better than either
“The Eye” or “Despair”), but he puts
forward the alternative claim that John
Shade is the author of the whole book.
To me this makes no sense. It robs the
novel of its warmth and substitutes
mere smartness.
The theme of trick narrators is asso-
ciated with that of doubles. Field dis-
cusses this subject but he misses what
is to me its really important aspect: the
most frequent Nabokovian doppelganger
is selfconsciousness. All his major char-
acters describe a split in themselves into
the one who acts and the one who
watches. The watcher is, of course, the
narrator in those novels where the hero
tells his own story. Selfconsciousness is
thus the source of art; at the same time
it is the source of anguish to the artist.
“Lolita” demonstrates that it can also
be the means of his salvation.
Field, like most other writers, con-
siders that “Lolita” is Nabokov’s great-
est work to date, and his chapter on this
novel is the best in the book. He points
to Humbert’s duality (echoed in the
double name), the good and evil sides
of his nature, and suggests that the
murder of Quilty is symbolic of Hum-
bert’s victory over his evil alter ego.
A similar interpretation is offered for
“Invitation to a Beheading,” but this
is less convincing: Cincinnatus C (double
name again) also has a double repre-
senting his perverted side this time
it is a question of artistic perversion.
His alter ego is Monsieur Pierre, the
executioner, and in the end it is Mon-
sieur Pierre who is “executed,” symbol-
ising Cincinnatus’ emergence as a true
artist.
Ambiguity is fundamental to Nabo-
kov’s art, and multiple interpre-
tations are inevitable. I am bound to
admit that there is a case for all the
interpretations offered by Andrew Field
—and this is what makes his book so
stimulating. If I seem to have nothing
but criticism for the book, I now want
to correct that impression. His is a mag-
nificent piece of scholarship. He has
achieved the incredible feat of tracking
down and reading almost every word
Nabokov ever wrote. To the reader this
will seem unremarkable until he learns
of the vast amount of writing still un-
translated and uncollected. Most as-
tonishing is the existence of some eight
or nine plays (one of which, “The
Waltz Invention,” was translated last
year), but in addition to these there are
three novels, three volumes of short
stories, and six of poems, not to mention
all the critical writings. Not only does
Field give an account of this material,
much of which is likely to remain un-
available to those of us who do not read
Russian, but he always has something
interesting to say about it, even if one
cannot always agree with what he says.
Despite a few shortcomings, this is-
an immensely rewarding book for any-
one interested in Nabokov. In contrast
to the only other study on the subject
(by Page Stegner) it is a deeply con-
sidered piece of writing which should be
a standard work for years to come.
Not a fugue but a fag
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Orchestra and Beginners. Frederic
Raphael. Cape. $3.85.
RAPHAEL’S REPUTATION has
grown quickly: the screenplay clever,
quick, superficially bright of “Darl-
ing,” a brilliant version of Hardy in
“Far From the Madding Crowd,” and
the irritatingly directed “Two For the
Road,” a potentially interesting study
of a marriage with clever time-shifts,
ruined by the fact that Audrey Hepburn
can no longer play a young girl and by
Albert Finney’s dispirited performance
as her husband.
Raphael’s novels have on the whole
been weightier; ingenious in the case of
“Lindmann,” perhaps his best work; the
others are rather tiresomely involved.
“Orchestra and Beginners” is his most
complex fiction to date and, alas, his
most dense.
The setting is England an England
at war quite clearly remembered, it
seems, from Raphael’s own childhood.
The prep school which forms the focus
for one of its two main narratives
Raphael is fond of a split-level structure
is shown with all the horrible vivid-
ness of total recall, while the Anglo-
American background of the central
figure, Marcus Strauss, is reflected in
Raphael’s own: he was born in Chicago.
Marcus’ American mother is clearly and
rather cruelly drawn, a talkative, sub-
Coward figure with more attempts at
wit than revelations of it, and the
Jewishness of the boy Marcus’ father is
displayed with no less prolixity. The
prep school’s horrors as they impress
themselves on a sensitive child are
deliberately but not quite appropriately
used as parallels to the constant pres-
ence of the threat of Nazidom, and we
get a carefully inserted flashback to
Strauss pere’s harrowing experiences in
a German school.
The theme is fairly strong, but not
strong enough to sustain the tortuous
and overheated prose of the narrative.
We become exasperated by the idiotic
wordiness of the dialogues between the
husband and wife, Leonard and Linda,
and their intolerable conceits, and it is
hard to escape a suspicion that Raphael
is not mocking them, but instead wrote
their words with enthusiasm. If that be
so, the reflection on Raphael himself
could not be worse. For all his scrupul-
ous assembly of period detail, he is in
this performance a dull and humorless
contortionist.

NATURE'S FINEST
Involved poet
By MARGARET IRVIN
An Eye For a Tooth. Bruce Dawe.
Cheshire. $1.95.
IN ONE OF HIS poems, “Advice To
An Interplanetary Visitor,” Bruce Dawe
asks the Visitor to give comfort and
kindness when he comes across the last
survivor on this bombed-out planet.
Break the news to him gently
that he is the sine qua non, the ulti-
mate reason
for everything.
The last two lines could be called
Dawe’s manifesto. To him, man may be
cruel, pathetic, and utterly unwise, but
he is tremendously significant and never
to be considered expendable. This en-
dorses one’s view that, even in his
moments of anger and satirical sharp-
ness, the poet has the compassionate
mind which interprets, very different
from the observing mind which merely
records.
Dawe is more than observant; he is
perceptive, and he approaches the
human being and the dilemmas of love
and hate in a way that sets him apart
from the detached cynic and committed
sentimentalist. He is very interested
indeed, involved in our pursuit of
terror and destructiveness, as if to say
we know we are on the way to hell, yet
we keep going. “The Scavengers,” “In
The New Landscape,” and “The
Saigon-Dalat Night Train Runs Infre-
quently” seem to ask: is this a compul-
sion or an inevitability? The poet’s
answer to this difficult question is, per-
haps, to see everybody and everything
exactly as they are in an equally diffi-
cult network of reality, and, having
done this, to open the heart to love, or,
if this is impossible, to pity.
In “The Victims” he contemplates
death by murder, seeing in the city’s
dead of night the ghosts of the victims.
He says:
if I looked up just once their faces
would harrow me for ever, the girl
who accepted the lift, the tortured
bookmaker, the pensioner burned to
death by five boys . . .
but they have had only
the pitiful newscaster to sing their
requiem
and, at evening, a sudden
aria of headlines . . .
They stand in the puddled light,
their feet
swathed in newspapers, the fountain
bleeding heavily upwards . . .
We have to face facts even if they
leave us so sick and raw we want to run
away.
“Beatitudes” is a powerful poem with
a beautifully realised ending. What it
portrays has been accepted for so long
as normal. What it infers is horrific.
After all, the best of S.F. contains more
than a modicum of poetic justice.
At times Dawe goes off-beat — for
instance in “A Home Away From
Home,” which is marred by a senten-
tious ending; and in “Breakthrough,”
where the tone is heartless and slick
enough to be labelled: In Bad Taste.
On the other hand, a poem such as
“Katrina” is completely true. Parental
torment, fear, despair, love, and hope
are contrapuntal. It is not often that
Dawe is frankly lyrical, so “Prescience”
is, in this collection, a poem with a
difference. One comes upon the follow-
ing with an astonished pleasure:
To feel already the unending ache
Of Adam and his exile, every tree
Loud with the grief of birds recalling
Heaven . . .
To think, to feel, to know this, is but
death
Fore-tasted, like those first mysterious
tears
With which the exile, plagued by
echoes, hears
His irrevocable sentence in each
breath.
“An Eye For A Tooth” is packed
with people from infancy to old age.
They live and die in catastrophic
times. Though the mood is often
elegiac, it is a virile book, ending with
an allegorical poem, “The Frog
Plague.” Poets have always been great
ones for warnings and prophecies.
ANIMUS
He escapes, and I see him walking,
walking,
sometimes on circles of thin air,
sometimes pedestrian as you and I,
but easily expressing our despair
by the weight of his footfall, and
again
taking with a light step our peace
and. joy
away from vicinities of pain.
With him, I hear the unpronounced
spoken as naturally as the sky
articulates blue particles, the white
pitch and toss of the daytime moon,
and the high
tensions that hold us to impossible
devotions. I pay the penalty of those
who risk the inexpressible.
I am not bound to him by love.
All he gives is an awkward passion—
nothing to do with sex or pride or
rage,
rather the very devil of unreason.
Above this chaos, the spools of air
he treads wind up the meaning of
time, and then
unwind what I am made to hear.
He is the skill that takes me for
a fool unless I learn to walk
every so often the dangerous air,
and, with his accent, rhymes and
rhythms, talk
of what concerns us, the necessity
that releases him from the dark cage
that is
locked and bolted and chained in me.

OEUI
SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
Smothering
the star
with extras
NOW THE State elections are over
I can come clean. I was driven by
some demon desire to run for Premier.
My policy had nothing to do with pen-
sions, cost of living, or building more
State schools. I wanted to give my
promise to the entire community that I
would ban vegetables plated with the
main dish.
I have nothing whatever against
vegetable accompaniments, but for
heaven’s sake is it necessary to encircle,
smother, and suffocate the star appear-
ance with so many extras? This
thoroughly untidy habit is also
extremely hazardous. One tentative
knife cut is often enough to set up an
avalanche of peas that spread out over
the table like a nightmare snooker
match.
I’m told by several dedicated res-
taurateurs that they also abhor the
“heap” technique, but they say, “The
public want it they need to be
educated”! The service of vegetables
from separate dishes is well established
throughout Europe, England, and the
United States. We appear to be the
odd ones out. In those countries the
vegetables are usually charged as a
separate item instead of our “all-in
cost,” but this suggestion brings panic
to the eyes of every restaurateur here.
“Can you imagine how our customers
would feel if they saw peas cost
them 20 cents?” they cry.
I asked a leading restaurateur how
much he allocated for vegetables when
working out the cost of a dish. As a
basis for comparison we selected a plain
grilled steak. He serves this with two
green vegetables and french fried
potatoes. He starts by taking the raw
steak cost of 50 cents, adds 66 2-3rds
percent for food profit, 33 l-3rd per-
cent for service, and an additional 5
percent in case some customer has
false teeth and sends it back. The sell-
ing price is, therefore, just over $2.
Vegetables are also costed and their
selling price ranges from 15 cents to
30 cents, or even more in the case
of the real “heap” merchants. The
total reaches the now familiar $2.30
mark.
“Surely it is possible to reduce the
cost of the ‘all-in’ steak to $2 and
put the vegetables on the menu at,
say, ten cents each?” I asked. “Yes,
this is possible, but how is the customer
to know what the original price was—
he will still consider the vegetables as
extras!” Perhaps the secret lies in
vegetable preparation. This could also
eliminate the major crime perpetrated
by our restaurants.
I ■ have quite a “thing” about green
vegetables, largely, I think, because my
mother had more rows with our chefs
over this point than any other. Anglo-
Saxons, no matter where they live,
are well known for their utter dis-
regard for the poor old “greens.” Why,
if something is so beautifully colored
by nature, does it have to be boiled
into a grey, pulpy mess?
In Europe, where the separate charge
is made, the vegetables are treated to
simple yet quite discernible garnishings.
They are also often freshly cooked or
at least “finished” on a lamp by the
tableside. The difference is chalk and
cheese. Our vegetables are boiled to
obliteration and float on their backs in
a pool of slightly undersalted water.
There are those among us who see
nothing wrong with a plain boiled fresh
vegetable. Agreed when fresh and
perfectly cooked!
But I can see no reason why butter,
cream, freshly ground black pepper,
nutmeg, bacon, bayleaf, parsley, lemon
juice, lemon zest, pearl onions, thyme,
basil, oregano, buttered breadcrumbs,
sauce bechamel, or hollandaise cannot
be added to enhance their attractions.
Whatever happened to the little peas
cooked in stock with baby onions, ham,
herbs, and lettuce? Where have all the
braised celery hearts gone? . . . and
please, those long, fresh french beans
cooked in butter, garlic, and nutmeg.
Try them and you’ll see what I mean.
With lib. of thin, stringless beans
you’ll need 1 garlic clove, loz. butter,
salt and black peppercorns to season,
\ lemon, 1 tablespoon parsley, and a
dusting of nutmeg.
If the beans are thin, young, and
tender, leave whole, if larger, then cut
into three-inch lengths. Squash the
garlic with a knife (do not chop or
crush), squeeze half the lemon, chop
the parsley, and measure butter. Place
the butter in a pan, add garlic, then
beans. Season, cover, and cook approxi-
mately ten minutes on medium heat or
until tender. Toss from time to time
with lid on. Just before serving, add
the juice of half lemon, parsley, and a
light dusting of nutmeg. Remove the
garlic piece.
On their own, vegetables like these
are a small masterpiece surely worth
a 20-cent charge!
I believe in at least trying to spur
some action to remove the present un-
civilised custom, so I propose a cam-
paign and urge you to join me. The
next meal I have in a restaurant will be
ordered for the star item alone. I shall
ask for it without vegetables. I shall
then ask what fresh vegetables they can
prepare with heavy emphasis on
fresh. These I shall request to be served
separately. If the service is refused, I
shall leave. Join me, won’t you?

Terminology
I was somewhat disconcerted to read
in “A More Comprehensive Role” (8.,
March 2) that I had been “relieved of
command of the Task Force” in Viet-
nam. I think, sir, this could well come
under the heading of “Things which
might have been better put,” since the
terminology used means only one thing
to a soldier that I was sacked!
I hope the writer of the article did
not mean this. I relinquished command
in the normal course of reassignment,
and received with some pride the con-
gratulations of General Westmoreland,
the Chief of the General Staff and the
Minister for the Army on the achieve-
ments of the Task Force under my
command.

[The Bulletin agrees with Brigadier
Graham that this might have been
better put. His reposting was, of course,
part of the normal process of Army
postings. Editor, The Bulletin.]
Backing away from Britain
Tour article (8., March 2), was a
superb reflection on the current Aus-
tralian thought on Britain. In the light
of this thought it is surprising that you
expect Britons to regard the Australian
people as cousins when they consistently
behave like spoilt, ill-bred children.
After Britain has been successfully
bled white defending ungrateful Com-
monwealth countries it is a blatant lie
to state, as you did, that “the Common-
wealth has been all but useless to its
member countries other than Britain.”
Australia has happily waxed fat whilst
British conscripts and British money
kept it secure, but as soon as Britain
decides enough is enough, Australia
feels entitled to turn a blind eye on
Britain’s past generosity and to accuse
It of letting it down. Perhaps the Aus-
tralian people feel that Britain should
have continued in its old role until
every Australian did not need to go to
work.
It is time the people of this country
did a little more toward helping them-
selves and other countries in this region.
The old excuse —“We’re only a small
country, mate,” is used to cover up for
all kinds of deficiences.
For myself, I can’t wait to get back
to Britain, where, as your accompanying
photographs showed, initiative is not
considered as a commodity that can be
bought second-hand on the overseas
market.

An Englishman's word ...
After reading your article entitled
“An Englishman’s Word” (8., March
9), I feel I must protest. The writer
completely ignores England’s economic
position and the fact that there are no
jobs in England for Kenya’s Asians.
They would have to be supported in
England on the National Assistance.
Does the writer think it better for Eng-
land to fulfil present obligations and
then find that there is no way out of
her economic difficulties at all; or is it
better to (regretfully) break promises
in order to survive? The writer is doing
what many Australians (in my experi-
ence) do in condemning England, but
not suggesting a suitable alternative.
Finally, I would like to say that I
think it presumptuous of an Australian
magazine, with Australia’s “enlightened”
attitude to the racial problem, to risk
comment on another country.
Mrs. W. Read
Torrensville, S.A.
In contrast to “Observer’s” comment
in the same issue, there is an excellent
factual article (8., March 9) on the
question of Kenya’s Asians. Unfortun-
ately it is marred by its title
“Britain’s ‘natives’ just aren’t being
civilised.”
The problem is not simply one of
being civilised or not being civilised.
This implies the existence of only one
civilisation and only one pattern of
behaviour. For better or' worse, nature
and mankind have evolved over thous-
ands of years a pattern of diversity
comprising many different civilisations
with different cultures, religions, mar-
riage laws, and even personal hygiene.
Such differences cannot be successfully
mixed together in a generation or two.
Britain, with the current problem of
Asian migrants from Kenya, is learning
this simple truth the hard way.

The Catholic bishops
The suggestion made in a recent article
(8., Feb. 24) that Catholic bishops are
not easy to approach is contrary to my
experience. I came as an unknown
immigrant to Australia 21 years ago
and have had audiences with at least
a dozen bishops on matters of social
welfare, without any fuss or difficulty
and with some ultimate success.
The real barrier to laymen with
progressive ideas in the Catholic Church
lies in its decentralisation into dioceses
responsible only to Rome, and to
parishes in which the parish priest is
canonically supreme.
The layman looks instead for an
Australian primatial see, ruling bishops
who in turn rule parish priests, with
the whole system advised by a clerical-
lay Synod. Unversed as I am in the
details of Church government, I would
not commit myself unreservedly to
such a system.

Fishing, on the rocks?
A year ago Brian Hoad’s comment
on the Australian fishing industry
(B. March 9) would have been com-
pletely justified, for, if not a construc-
tive total loss, it was close enough to the
rocks to be a very poor risk indeed.
Twelve months rather than 12
miles has wrought the major change.
In that time the Australian Fishing
Industry Council has formed strong
and active branches in all States (not,
as reported, in N.S.W. alone) and
before The Bulletin goes to press again
will have held its inaugural National
Conference in Canberra.
This cohesive industry body, repre-
sentative of the fishing, processing,
marketing, and servicing sectors, offers
to the politicians and administrators
of the States and the Commonwealth
criticisms of the current non-policy
and, more importantly, solutions to
the plethora of problems surrounding
the industry. As these are being effec-
tive with government, other primary
industries might follow our example
and add to their organisations those
sectors which market their product and
service their industry, to speak with
one voice.
The first major step required is a
national fisheries policy formulated by
govei'nment and industry to provide
the foundation for a strong and viable
contributor to the national economy.
A contributor which, of all the pri-
mary industries, has the greatest poten-
tial for immediate growth. Within two
years the export value of marine pro-
ducts will double (from those mol-
luscs and crustaceans omitted from
your correspondent’s figures), and
within five years will reach
$lOO million annually, much of this
from the prawning industry north of
Capricorn.
As the embittered critic quoted, and
having viewed the situation from
within the ranks of government as
well as industry, I realise the way
is long, dark, and difficult, but since
the Australian Fisheries Development
Conference a year ago, AFIC has
provided the light at the end of the
tunnel to beckon government and in-
dustry along at an increasingly urgent
pace in the face of foreign competi-
tion and pressure upon our marine
resources.

Alcoa aluminium is
helping send horses
round the bend.
Safely.
Put yourself in the jockey’s saddle.
Your horse is boxed in. He’s hanging
into the running rail. Suddenly 900
pounds of racing machine hits the rail
at 35 miles an hour. A serious accident?
Less likely at the Warrnambool track.
Warrnambool Racing Club in Victoria
has invested in a running rail of gold
anodised extruded aluminium, made
by Alcoa.
Aluminium doesn’t splinter and break on
impact. Its resilience cushions the blow,
reduces the risk of injury.
Installation was significantly faster
than could be achieved with timber.
And cheaper in the long run, because
Alcoa aluminium can’t rust, and never
needs painting.
Alcoa aluminium will put you on the
right track in solving manufacturing
problems, or making the most of your
product opportunities. Just call your
nearest Alcoa Regional Sales Office.
