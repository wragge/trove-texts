The Sense of the Country
Sir Henry Parkes evidently had not been able
to realise the seriousness of the change in his
position when, on the meeting of Parliament, he
undertook to explain the significance of the recent
elections. He had obviously failed to grasp the
idea that he no longer was in a position to speak
nx cathedra, and to insist, as has been his wont,
upon his own opinions, even though they were
transparently fallacious and repugnant to reason.
Sir Henry, in the last half hour of his nominal
Premiership, still presumed to speak as though he
were vested with real authority to express, as the
chosen leader of the colony's affairs, the sentiments
of the people. He had clean forgot, or not yet
learned to understand, that no man in the country
had leas right than he to assume a knowledge of
what is in the minds of the electors. 'J he con-
stituencies had just freshly shown that he had
misunderstood the ideas of the public for a very
longtime past, and that his interpretation of their
desires and tastes had been abhorrent in their eyes.
Perhaps, however, Sir Henry’s assumption of a
right to present himself as spokesman for the con-
stituencies, and as interpreter of their meaning
and wishes, was not a mistake, but an impudent
shift of calculated strategy, designed to force the
hand and embarrass the policy of his successors.
He undertook to explain the significance of the
elections. The country, he said, had decided that
there should be a reform in the land laws of the
colony ; it had decided that the Parkes-Eobert-
son • ’abinet was not the Ministry to carry it out;
and, finally, it had decided that the reform should
be undertaken immediately. If the Assembly had
silently accepted this triple interpretation, the
new Ministry would have been placed in a. false
and difficult position at once. Fortunately, the
absurdity and dishonesty of Sir Henry’s assump-
tion was detected instinctively and universally ;
and his attempt to explain the sense of a community
which had emphatically repudiated his guidance
was frustrated by a general and prompt expression
of dissent.
I • •
It would have bean correct had Fir Henry
Parkes confined the application of hia remarks
to the late Assembly—that Assembly which, by
the Governor’s favour, he was enabled to dis-
miss for coming to a decision very closely re-
sembling that which he essayed to ascribe to the
constituencies. But in getting rid, by a penal
dissolution, of that Assembly, in revenge for its
insolence in daring to rnn counter to his conve-
nience and wishes, Sir Henry has had the mis-
fortune to raise up, in the new Assembly, a body
infinitely more comprehensive in its objections to
his system of administration and to his policy.
The decision of the electorates has obviously
reduced the technical point upon which the
Government was defeated to insignificance com-
pared with other causes of objection developed
during the electoral campaign. The decision of
the country, honestlv interpreted, has certainly
been that the Eobkrtson-Parkes conception of
calling a codification of the land laws a reform, is
repugnant to the sense and desire of the country,
and that a genuine revolution in the present effete
and mischievous system is wished for. But there
has been no intimation whatever that the Gauntry
desires that this revolution sball be hastily or
inconsiderately wrought. Sir Henry Parkes and
his colleagues may imagine that, since they have
been flung out of office with every evidence of
dislike and contempt, and since some of them
have been degraded altogether from the position
of Parliamentary representatives, the Heavens
have fallen, and nothing that can happen there-
after can be sufficiently startling to jar the nerves
of the community, unstrung by the greatest of
conceivable catastrophes.
# * •
In the eyes of Sir Henry and his colleagues,
their fall has, no doubt, been the ultimate and
supreme cataclysm, and after that no convulsion
can be worth guarding against. But. outside the
ring of the dazed dozen men who find all their
vanities vanish like the magician's money,con verted
into dirt, few will be likely to consider that the
world has come to an end because Parkes
and Kobkrtson are out of office. The refor-
mation of our agrarian system is a very arduous
task, and not to be flippantly fiddled with
or hurriedly organised. Mr. Stuart has shown
that a system of reformation is already broadly
outlined in his mind. But between the general
principles which a man in Opposition may indicate
as, in his opinion, essential, and the detailed codi-
fication of jtheso principles and their embodiment
in a draft'llill, there must necessarily lie a wide
interval—an interval of steady work, of mature
consideration, and of laborious and minute ad-
ustment. Every part of a coda—which must
necessarily, in view of the frightful complications
created by the vaiious Acts passed during the last
twenty years, be so framed as to provide for the
most intricate eventualities —must be so adjusted
as to operate harmoniously with every other part,
and to form a homogeneous whole. Sir Henry
Parkes is, we conceive, utterly mistaken if ho
imagines that because the country is weary of
him, and sick of Sir John Kobertson’s ob-
structiveneaa', it has lost its own balance and been
smitten with a craze for cenvulsionary proceed-
ings A radical change in the land laws is de-
manded, beyond question ; but there has been no
sign whatever that the country demands the work
in such haste as would militate against its
value, completeness, and permanency. On the
contrary, the country has given proof of singular
patieno", and of a steadfast determination to
afford every latitude to whoever professed a will-
ingness to do the work. It waited quietly for
four years, till the Parkes-Eobertson Govern-
ment should redeem its pledge to execute the
duty. And it was only when it became unmia-
takeably clear that the late Ministry did not
intend to do the work at all, and was deliberately
and superciliously fooling the people’s representa-
tives, that they could no longer, whatever their
personal dispositions,' uphold the Cabinet.
• « •
But apart from his misrepresentation of the
sense of tho country respecting land reform, Sir
Henry Parkis still more grossly misinterpreted
the soopo and purport of the people’s sentiments
as conveyed by their reaent choice of representa-
tives Probably. Sir Henry is the only man in
the community who could be at once so audacious
and so foolish as to pretend to be oblivious of tho
personal significance of tho recent elections. It
is true that the Ministry went to the country
ostensibly on their land policy. It is true also,
that they endeavoured, hnd miserably failed, to
qualify that concrete question by raising and
tacking on to it their favourite and formerly win-
ning dodge of sectarian embitterments But it is
also true, and so universally the sensation of the
eleptions that it is an evidence of cynical con-
tempt for the intelligence of the public for Parkes
to pretend to ignore it, that the strongest expres-
sion and meaning conveyed by the constituencies
had no reference at all to land policy, but con-
stituted a tremendous and unparalleled condem-
nation of the Cabinet, individually and oolleotively,
a disgust of its methods, and a refusal to submit
any longer to its mal-jidministration. It is pro-
bable that never before iu the history of constitu-
tional Government has so powerful and unmis-
takable an expression of public condemnation
proceeded from tho body of a people without an
impeachment succeeding it. No wonder that the
ex-Presnior tries to imagine it has all been an
ugly dream—that three of his colleagues have not
been rejected by every constituency they a*ked to
elect them; that the hiombers of the Assembly
who wore most deeply implicated in his transactions
were not plucked down from public station in
numerous instances; that his own peculiar hench-
man, hia Mbphistopheles— pretended servant,
but real master—was not forced to reooil in every
company, by decent men turning against him tfee
oros: eion the hilts of their swords. No wonfer that
he endeavours to flatter himself and persuade the
osuntry that these things are but tho figments of
their diseased imaginations, and that he himself
has not just begun to recover breath after being
spurned from every front door which admits to
Parliament, and after squeezing in as a last te-
source through a backstair, of which the key was
handed him by a political scullion.
• • •
But it is indicative of the extent to which his
infirmity of contempt for the intelligence and per-
ception of the people of the colony has gained
possession of his faculties, that he should have
conceived for one moment that so transparent and
specious a pretence would impose upon anyone
Mr. Stuart and his colleagues are now the
official and authorised exponents of the sense and
will of the constituencies —not Sir Henry
Parkes. It is to them that the country looks for
an announcement of the meaning and purport of tho
change just effected. And it is very certain that,
no matter what manoeuvres may fbe employed
against the new Ministry—no matter what leagues
and plottings may be concocted among -disap-
pointed aspirants for office, who would avenge
their own fancied slights by sacrificing the con-
venience and interests ®f the country—the people
as a body will insist that the new Cabinet shall be
afforded a fair chance of showing its quality—due
time for considering and preparing its measures—
and, above all, sufficiently oontrnued tenure of
office to enable the formation of a judgment as to
whether it supplies what is at the moment, we
believe, the essential and prime desideratum iu the
majority of minds—a Ministry of straightforward
methods and honest purposes.
The New Ministry.
Mr. Stu hit's selection of colleagues has been
somewhat precipitately denounced in some
quarters. It was not of course to be expected
that any Cabinet the Premier could form would
be acceptable to the adherents of the Party of
Corruption. The* organs of that faction have,
however, done good service. They are so desper-
ately hurt by the selection Mr. Stuart has made
that one can’t help perceiving that almost any
other combination would have suited them better.
This is the most hopeful sign of the day. What
the new Administration is capable of, as a body,
we have yet to learn by observation when it geis
to work.
• • •
But preconceptions are worth something, and it
is clear that to the advocates of corrupt adminis-
tration the new Cabinet is very unwelcome, indeed.
From this it may be inferred that the combination
is regarded as a very formidable on o, ami one
likely to bo iff actual for the which it
has been created —honest, vigorous legislation,
and thorough clearing up of the myfl enes of tl o
“Too st’ong (Imiulstratiou.” 'Theor g an a of that
ex-Adminutr*tion, with a plevsing and really
infantile ingenuousness, repeatedly • touitts than
almost any o.her combination would,have pleased
them better. Tn is can nut bu .jbe giaiiijiig to
such as desire that Mr. stuakt sisileoinn should
be an effective one Another em ouragii.g indica-
tion is that oven the Evening News, which from
opposing the Parkes Govern inii*T has stepped
on to denouncing the Stuart Ministry, does not
venture to suggest any other list or any single
substitution.
• * •
When one leaves this negative sort of ir quiry,
and tries tne positive t ystem, there is still ampio
room for the liveliest hopes. What the members
of the Stuart Cabinet may prove to be collec-
tively as «u Administration, can only he ascer-
tained by experience of their methods. No or o
can absolutely foretell what exact sort of politics!
amalgam the fusion of so many distinct individu-
alities may yield. But when the Ministers am
considered man by man, it is seen at once that in
the main and essential dotideratum —persons 1
integrity and directness of purpose—Mr. Stuart
has been highly successful. We should have pre-
ferred to have seen stronger men than Messrs.
Farnell and Cohen. Mr. Daluby is a superior
man to any of Parkes’ colleagues ; and it will
bo seen, immediately a comparison is made, that
the weakest men in the present Cabinet am
powerful when contrasted with the weakest meu
in the last Ministry.
m • m
Mr. Wright's inclusion has taken everyone
by surprise; but already this new man has, oil
the hustings, thrown off the mantle of silence an I
mserve which obscured his abilities, and has at
least partly justified the choice. It may, then-
fore, be conceded that the new Ministry warranis
hopeful anticipations. A fair and considerate
trial can alone show whether it is deserving i f
definite and deliberate support. What the country
requires is straightforwardness beyond all things.
The Meat Trade
With the grass growing at the rate of an inch in
the week all over Australia, thanks to the rains
which have freshened the last months of 1882,
there is every prospect of plentiful fat stock.
The outlook naturally suggests reflections as to
the great industry which, sooner or later, is
certain to take shape in connection with the meat
trade.
• • •
Wo do not propose to discuss the supply of the
Sydney market. That riddle defies solution by
ordinary rules. Up to this time, whether grass
has been plentiful or not, 'the consumer has
derived little advantage either in the form of a
reasonable price or good beef and mutton. Fat
bullocks are now sold at Homcbush at 25a. per
one hundred pounds, or 3d. per pound, with hide
and tat given in ; and the consumer pays the retail
butcher, a a of old, lid and 7d. cost of distribu-
tion and trade profits add from one hundred to
,,ouo hundred auo thirty per cent, to the wholesale
price, and the deterioration in quality seems to
keep pace with the increased expense The new
Market Company may possibly overcome the

Fortunately for the owners of flocks and herds,
the disposal of their staple is not limited to the
markets of Port Jackson ; and equally fortunate it 1
is for those who may wish to embark in the open-
ing enterprise, a boundless field of supply exists
outside the pastures of New South \Vales. In®
markets of the Mother-country are being steadily
opened. There is little doubt that the experi-
ments now being systematically conducted, will
result, in time, in the establishment of a standard
trade second only to the wool export. But, we
have, within an easier distance, markets of very
considerable capacity for consumption, offering
the inducements of higher prices and lower freights.
The chief of these will, without doubt, be found in
the great Indian Presidencies. A few years will
likely see steamers for Calcutta loaded with frozen
meat, fish, butter, and fruit. This line is, how-
ever, not yet taken up by our business men. The
trade which promises to open first will supply a
smaller and more scattered community, with this
important distinction- that it comprises a capa-
bility of extension which we have no means of
estimating. In many a bungalow overlooking the
sunny seas of the Straits, there dwell climate-worn
merchants and planters making money and support-
ing large establishments, and most of these men
would at times give a week’s profits for a good joint
of wholesome meat. In these Settlements there is
no lack of money and of the luxuries that money
can get; but even Burgundy and Chablis at four
dollars a bottle will not wash down with satisfac-
tion the vile limp tissue, like a compound of street-
goat and milker’s calf, which the Chinese butcher
sells under the desecrated name of beef at a shilling
per pound. In the same seas, mail-steamers—
British. French, and Dutch—are passing daily,
filled with passengers tired of curried fowl and
cookery flavoured with cocoa-nut; and every
skipper of them would lio-to for an hour or two if
he could get a couple of good CXS bullocks or a
dozen Warrego wethers.
• • •
So far, price would be no obstacle to the sale of
good frozen meat; but in forecasting the profit-
able consumption, it is worth considering whether
the well-to-do Chinese and Mohammedans would
not also be customers for Australian beef and
mutton at a fair figure. There is little doubt,
though, that the military and naval dep6ts main-
tained by the different European Powers in these
seas would take our moat at a higher price than
it fetches in the London market; and if its native
stock is so diseased as is generally reported, the
whole meat supply of tbese small communities and
garrisons will depend on colonial shipments.
» • •
The beef production of Australia is quite equal
to all such demands The increase of cattle stock
la Queensland will soon make the muster of the
Northern colony far beyond that of New South
Wales. For eight hundred miles of coast, cattle
breed and fatten in a fashion seldom seen farther
South—for all the way from the Tweed River to
Cape York, there is grass and water, with no frost
and with little drought all the year round.
Already, in the neighbourhood of Bowen and
Cleveland Bay, herds of cattle—numbering ten,
twenty, and thirty thousand head —are as common
as herds of two and three thousand are in New
South Wales. A good bullock can be grown in
Queensland at a fair profit for .£4 10s., and the
frozen carcases are certain to be saleable at the
numerous freezing establishments now being
opened up North at a corresponding price. The
supply of mutton is not so certain. Sheep are
kept now only in the inland districts of Queens-
land, and the surplus goes South as store stock,
to be shorn and fattened in Riverina. The num-
ber of sheep available for freezing will then depend
on the Southern market. But the supply of
cattle on this side, and the certain demand on the
other, leave little doubt of a good result if the
enterprise is well carried out. Any quantity of
beef can be got in Queensland for 2d. per pound,
and there should be some margin if the people in
the Straits are willing to pay only eight-pence.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Disappointed Office-Seekers.
THE ordinary agitations which attend the formation
of a new Ministry are bubbling merrily in the political
cauldron. The fitness of a man for office may generally
be measured as inverse to his anxiety to enter it. The
leader of a party has invariably ten times more diffi-
culty in arranging the secondarj appointments than
the leading ones. There always exists a host of second
and third-rate men who conceive that they have special
aptitudes or special claims for minor positions in a
Cabinet. The most troublesome of all, however, are
the persons who, without concerning themselves about
aptitudes at all, go entirely upon so-called rights.
Such individuals, ordinarily, are so infatuated about
what they regard as their claims, that they entirely
lose consciousness of the fact that when their imagined
title to personal consideration clashes with the in-
terests of the country, their “ claims " cease to have
a particle of force. The most convincing proof a man
can give of his unfitness for office, is solicitation for
it, either in person or by henchmen. A man who would
stoop to beg for a portfolio, will stoop to other un-
worthiness when he has gained it. A man who will
threaten revenge unless he be admitted to a Ministry,
demonstrates his lack of principle. He says, in effect,
that he is satisfied that Brown is a leader after his own
heart, and has selected in the persons of Jones,
Eobinson, Smith, and Thompson, capable men, who
will do their duty to the country, and whom he will be
willing to join in office. But if Brown intimates that
he prefers to add to his colleagues someone else, the
aspirant for office practically declares that the country
shall not benefit, if he can help it, by the talents and
honesty of the men with whom he was so anxious to
associate himself. Unless his claims be satisfied, the
interests of the country may go hang. He will rather
help to reinstate the faction he had declared incom-
potent and corrupt, than help to preserve to the State
the services of men ho had so firmly believed in that
he almost grovelled for leave to join them. This is
precisely the attitude of some self-seeking politicians
at the present juncture with regard to Mr. Stuart and
his Cabinet. It is no secret that one or two men have
absolutely pestered the Premier to include them in
his Ministry, and that, in revenge for Mr. Etuart’s
preference for others, they are now moving heaven and
earth and ditch water to throw impediments in the way
of the new Administration. It no other grounds for
rejecting a volunteer colleaguo than indecent urgency
of solicitation had been apparent to Mr, Stuart, that
*1ob« would have been conclusive reason.
The Newtown Election.
Mb. Copeland is apparently the only one among the new
Ministers whose re-election is to be seriously opposed.
There should be no mistake as to the significance of
the opposition offered to Mr. Copeland's re-election.
Mr. Mitchell, who offers himself as a candidate, but
a few w«eks ago stood as an opponent of the Parkes-
Koisektson system of administration. The contest
between him and Mr. Copeland was then conducted on
a narrow and personal issue. The question for the
electors was whether they preferred a new and untried
man with more intimate local connections, or an ex*
perienced and proved politician, whose qualities had
borne the test of years of public service. The question
now to be decided is a much larger one. Mr. Mitchbll
no longer represents the public feeling against the
Parkes-Bobertson system. In opposing the Min*
ister for Works he opposes the Ministry which
the recent elections practically called into exist-
ence for the purpose of instituting a better
system of Administration. Mr. Copeland clearly
represents the party of reform; Mr. Mitchell
represents ostensibly himself and a preference for
some other indefinite Cabinet. In reality, he is the
instrument of disappointed office-seekers, whe hope to
avenge themselves on the Premier by supporting his
candidature; and he is the catspaw of the adherents of
the regime of irresponsible and corrupt Government
which the people of the colony have Just shaken off.
The success of Mr. Mitchell would be a success ef the
party of Mllburn Creek and North Shore Bridge swindles 5
and, although it would not shake, it would certainly
impair the moip.l influence of the Government among
the waiters upon Providence in Parliament. Mr. Cope-
land was, according to our ideas, wrong when he ques-
tioned the propriety of opposition offered to a Minister
seeking re-elootion. There is nothing sacred about the
seat of a Minister; and if elevation to office tends to
give birth In Mr, Copeland’s mind to ideas of special
exemptions and privileges, the sooner he checks that
inclination the better. It was that spirit, carried to
an extreme, which Induced Sir Henkt Parkes to frame
his notorious Privileges «f Parliament Bill—one of the
most disgraceful attacks upon the constitutional
liberties of the people ever concocted in a free com-
munity. Had Sir Henry Parkes himself, or Mr. John
Davies —that living embodiment of the Pabkesian
system of government —come forward to oppose Mr.
Copeland, nothing could have been fairer. Even in
the case of Mr. Mitchell's candidature, the electors
have no more than they are entitled to when an oppor-
tunity is afforded them of revising their votes, and
declaring whether they are satisfied with the personnel
of Mr. Stuart’s Cabinet, and whether they are as well
satisfied to be represented by Mr. Copeland as
Minister as they were to be represented by him as a
private member. The electors are perfectly within
their rights in returning either candidate. But there
is a clear distinction with reference to Mr. Mitchell’s
own position. His candidature is unmistakeably an
act of hostility to the principles upon which he stood
only a few weeks ago. Ho is notoriously pushed for.
ward by disappointed office-seekers, and it is a matter
of common knowledge that he calculates upon having
the support of all the adherents of the Administration
he denounced when he last offered for election.
Mr. Mitchell is the adopted of the MoTburn-Creekites
and the North Shore Bridge tricksters, and independent
voters will do well to boar that fact in mind.
Party Pugilism.
I
So the D. T. yowls about the late Opposition having
made a mistake in making the election of the new
Speaker a party question. Just take note of the true
state of the case. This was the little game. Sir
George Wigram Allen was to have had a walk over.
1 Sir George Wigram Allen was then to have shortly re-
! signed in favour of Water-Jug Foster or Wisdom, Sir
George Wigram Allen was next to have gone home on
a Parkesian triumphal tour, and tout for a baronetcy,
through the influence of the Brothers M* Arthur, who
sit upon the right side of the House of
Lastly, when Sir George Wigram Allen, Bart., came
back —by the way, the D.T. would call him “ Baron
Allen,” not knowing the titular distinctions of the no-
bility, barring, of course, a Scotch laird—the "Speaker’s
Chair” was to be made over in perpetuity to W/ater-
Jug Poster or Wisdom if the Bart, didn’t care for it.
A fine case of barter ? It was the last soap-bubble the
I Parkes boys attempted to blow. But it’s been “busted,”
The party aspect of the question becomes funnier than \
ever when seen from this standpoint. Instead of by a *
3 Bart., the House is now chair-chidden by a Barton, j
Foster’s water-jug is “ crackeder nor ever.” Allen ,
J gloomily haunts the Globe with his hat over his eyes. (
j Parkes looks round with suspicion on all of his j
colleagues, and asks himself : h How did the ‘political .
1 puppy’ find it out P” And the D.T. immediately comes \
3 out with a loader on the monstrous sin of party j
election. I
Parkes’ Tools.
1 The Ministry of Corruption does not dare openly to
- oppose with its declared supporters the re-election of
3 members ef the new Ministry, and has also sagaciously
3 perceived that for any candidate to be supported by the
r organ which during its tenure of office was the apologist
1 for its most Infamous acts, would be to ensure his
• rejection. With characteristic adroitness they have
1 hit upon a smarter expedient. Keeping themselves
> carefully In the background, and relying upon the
, expertness of their “ underground engineers,” they
i have availed themselves of the exasperation of dis-
> appointed aspirants for office to attack the Ministry of
3 Reform. And it must be admitted that this dodge has
a worked very well so far. Working with these base
t materials, the expelled gang has succeeded in gaining
0 command of one journal which helped to pull them
7 down. Of course the Evening News could not de-
1 cently support the Parkes-Daviks-Bobertson crowd
3 so soon after denouncing them, root and branch. But
0 it has not been difficult to humbug proprietors who
r have no personal aptitude either for journalism or con-
- stitntional studies, that there is nothing incompatible
» with their past course when they adopt as proteges all
t the disappointed ex-opponents of the Parses Cabinet,
» who, being refused portfolios, prefer their private
s rancour to the public interests. Sir Henry Parses
1 and his henchmen must really be congratulated upon
s the dexterity with which they have circumvented the
i Evening News, and under the thinnest and most spe-
s cions of disguises taken possession of it, to serve their
1 purposes. It is equally adroit in them to make cats-
7 paws of all that was self-seeking among their late anta-
r gonists. At the forthcoming re-elections it must bo
7 clearly borne in mind that there are only two parties
b before the country—the Parkes Party, and the Party
of Reform, of which Mr. Stuart and his colleagues are
the acknowledged leaders. If there bo any other,
where is it ?—what is it ? —of whom is it constituted ?
The lines are as sharply defined as at the general election.

“ Honest John ”
It must be pretty generally known by this time that
the most active among the disappointed office-seekers
who have now set themselves to revenge their exclusion
from the new Ministry is Mr. John Sutherland—
“ Honest John.” It is also generally known that, by a
singula* fatality, during the Parkes rdgime it was
inevitable, when any piece of land was sought for public
purposes, that none could be discovered so suitable as
some lot in the possession of a man possessing political
influence. But few persons are aware, perhaps, that
when, yielding to public anxieties, the late Government
decided to remove the powder magazine from Gout
Island to some locality less dangerous to the city in
case of an explosion, a piece of land hold by a syndicate
or ring, of which “Honest John” is an important
member, was a site pressed upon the Government. For
this land “ Honest John” and his associate proprietors
advanced a modest claim of thirteen thousand pounds/
Very nearly as much as the Milburn Creek compensa-
, tion vote. This claim has been floating about the
Government Departments for some time. Not inten-
tionally held in abeyance, with the view of keeping
Honest John and his fellow proprietors on their good
political behaviour, of course, but just lost sight of.
, Forgotten. A trifling demand for £13,000 compensa-
. tion lost sight of and forgotten after the Darling
, Harbour and Milburn Creek sensations. Nothing more
, natural, of course. While Honest John’s friends
[ were pestering the life out ef Mr. Stuart to take him
; as a colleague, this little claim was still floating about
, the Departments—but then remembered ; no longer
, forgotten. The ex-Treasnrer, Mr. Watson, suddenly
, at this time recalled the little matter to mind, and had
L ihe documents brought before him. Two days before
the Parkes Cabinet formally resigned, Mr. Watson
f who may not have had an idea that Honest John was
r trying, and calculated to succeed, to become a member
of Mr. Stuart’s Administration, made a minute to the
L claim that it was “to be resisted to the uttermost.”
i The same land had been offered to him for £25 per acre,
in lieu of £6O per acre as now demanded, and ho had
L refused the oiler as excessive. The record of his
j refusal may turn up. Anyhow, it does not stem to have
disheartened “ Honest John,” who must havc.imagined >
3 when he put in his amended claim for more than double
L the first amount, that he knew some dodge to get
3 round the Treasurer’s (unrecorded) refusal. And it
3 was while the beautiful affair was unsettled that
3 “ Honest John ” got his friends to press for his inclu.
3 sion in the C.-.binet. A beautiful little Milburn Creek
j trap set for the new Government. Honest John and
Honest James! And it is Honest John who is
p working up the Opposition to the re-election of Cope-
land and Reid. “ Honest, honest— lago I”

THECREAT
ONE OP THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
IN a recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Triokett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
** I have found St, JACOB’S OIL a sure and certain
cure, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in book, brought on by over-ex.
ertion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble.*'
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he says
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, at
what all our young men want.

it splinter and fly off like the Western, but it affords that domestic desideratum of some kinds of English coal of
heating an iron or cooking a steak as thoroughly and cleanly as a charcoal or breeze flro, while it imparts to the
steak none of that disagreeable odour of the unwholesome fumes given off by a breeze or gas lire.

was a squatter in New Zealand. He use a often

A nephew of Robert Burns ran the first Scotch

used to meet in the manse kitchen, over whisky

•When the lately deceased Anthony Trollope
, some years ago on a visit to his son, at Mortray
Nation, near Forbes, an inquisitive traveller of the
sushing style, abruptly saluted him with, “And are
fou really the famous Mr. Trollope ?” ‘ I believe so,"
wus the not over-cordial reply. “ Oh, I’ve read ever
many of your works," gushed his interlocutor. “It
j a pity you had not something better to do;" was
tbe frosty reply, and tho enthusiast collapsed and
decamped-
General Antoine Eugene Alfred Chanzy is dead,
and is to have a State funeral. Chanzy was by far the
ablest and most determined among the heretofore un-
vnown French Generals who opposed the Germans in
the war of 187'J-l, and he was, perhaps, the only one of
them who scored a genuine victory (it wasn’t a very big
one) at Coulmiers. He was a brave, energetic, and
clever man, and his death inflicts as great a loss on
French militarism, which boasts few able and tried
commanders, as did that of Skobeloff on the armies of
tbe Czar.
Lieutenant Ponsonby, who led the Criterion
birmaid astray, and was deprived of his commission—
this being the first instance of the kind that had come
under the notice of the Naval authorities I—is now
divorced from his wife. Mrs. Ponsonby had a citation
served on him when he was at the inquest on Emma
Cammiegs. It transpired that while he was ‘carrying
on " with Miss C., ho had given Mrs. Ponsonbv to unde .
stand that he had “gone to see his mother's grave.”
Decree nisi with costs. Let’s see. It’s almost time we
heard that the ex-lieutenant “ contemplated visiting
Australia."
We are sorry to see that Dervish Pasha is under
arrest at his own house, for bungling the Egyptian
mission. This was the gay old boy, it will be remem-
bered, whose wife presented him, on his return from
Cairo, with a beautiful young Circassian, to add to his
collection. This item of intelligence Ciroassian’d no
small surprise when first mode known in European
circles, and the conduct of Mrs. Dervish was much
eulogised by gentlemen generally. It seems to us that
if Dervish, under these circumstances, bo only im-
prisoned in his own house, he hasn’t much to complain
of. When h« gets tired of it. wo don’t mind taking a
turn there. Our address is 21 Pitt-street.
There was. so it seems, a bit of a disturbance
in the Biyal Arcade on Saturday night. It appears
that a wall known politician was passing through, with
soma ladies, when he was accosted by one or two
larrikins, who made pointed reference to certain hats
(which shall be nameless). The upshot was that the
“political party,” who is of stalwart build, saizsd
(unadvisedly) one of the delinquents with a view of
having him locked up. His companions, however,
assailed the captor with such a heterogeneous variety
of epithets that he deemed it wise to let the man go.
This is all we know about the matter. And it is not a
fairy tale, although the scene is laid in Arcadia.
The marriage of Lord Charles Soofct, son of the
Duke of Buccleuch, with Miss Ryan, of Melbourne,
will not be nearly tho first instama of a colonial girl
being raised into Burke and Dshratfs magic list.
Other instances were—Lady Limerick, from Sydney ;
Miss Stephens, of Tasmania, who became Countess ot
Donoughmore; and Miss Gray, of Queensland, who
became Lady Phipps. And while we are amongst the
aristocracy, we are reminded of the heroic Eton youth
who broke his umbrella over the imbioile starveling,
Roderick Maclean (while he was safely held, of course).
Considering how well his pa did out of the colony, the
least young Salmon could do would be to come tack
and give a colonial girl a lift into the nobility—when he
becomes a peer.
Mr Pope Cooper, the Queensland Attorney-
Gbneral, has been npoointed a judge of the Supreme
Court there. Mr. P. C is a ladies’ man, and is great
on straw-coloured kids. It is reckoned that, from
this date, breach of promise trials will be on tho
increase in Brisbane. “ The fair plaintiff," etc , nhou Id
have a good show. Pope is married very much, though
—matrimonially Coopered, in fact. His career has !
been unchequered to a great extent, the most startling
incident of his life being a recent buggy accident, when,
it is stated, he was pitched out on his head upon a log '
and injured the rag very much. We couldn’t say these '
little things if we were in Queensland. The papers 1
there have our Tull perm it situ to say anything they
liks about our judges.
The Rev. Mr. Wallaoo, Vicar of Lanarth, Corn-
wall, has just been divorced from hia wife—on her 1
petition, this worthy pastor, it teems, used to pull '
h«r hair out “ by handfuls," caM her unparliamentary
names, kick her in the apple-pie receptacle, and other I
things of an equally playful nature. We wonder what J
text the rev. gentleman took for hia sermon on the
Sunday after the decree nisi was pronounced. Possibly, 1
from Is. Ixiii. 3, “ 1 have trodden the wmo-press alone," ’
or' 1 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my {
own?”—Matt. xx. 15. And when M'Elhone takes to '

It was the wish of Garibaldi that hia remains
should be cremated, and the authorities insisted < n .
carrying out his wishes. His widow protests that j
she dressed the General for death, and then fainted t
She was for twenty-two days confined to her bed, and .
then (onnd that, instead of the arrangements for the *
cremation being carried out, as desired by her husband, *
an atrocious piece of medical experinaentalization had rj
been substituted. She complains, bitterly, that “ her
husband’s body was placed in water, as if it was a cod. g
fish; they disembowelled him like a fish, and then j
buried him in a coffin.” Of course, the widow’s tears ,
we nothing. Signori Bleed, Drench and Co. will in

A few years ago, Lady Dudley was regarded by •'
many people as unquestionably the handsomest woman t
iu England ; but now—well, a woman’s beauty can’t 3
last for ever. Luckily for her, her position does s
not depend on her looks, like the others. Her husband, b
the Earl of Dudley, though ns plain a looking man as v
yen would meet in a day’s walk, is one of tne richest I
noblemen in the kingdom, and the combined forces of I
rank and money which she has on her side have enabled n
ter to do what none of the others would have dared, v
Unlike the others, she has ever spurned the notice and w
attention of the Prince of Wales, going so far es to ii
refuse to speak to him. Indeed, she has been known *'
on more than one occasion to deliberately turn her a

And poor old Bourband is dead,
A Mr. Leybourne, who has been cast in
) damages amounting to £BB in Auckland, for breach of
promise, seams to be as philosophic now the case la
settled as he was chivalrous in conducting it. Ho says:
“ It is pretty well known that I could have quashed the
case had I told all I knew, but I would rather pay than
hurt her character. I have got off for the sum of £BB
altogether, at £2 per month. This will not hurt me,
and no doubt in after years I shall be glad. These
payments monthly will compel her to wait 30 moiths
before the costs are paid/fcnd before she will get any-
thing for showing herself up to the public so rldi-
■ oulously.” It isn't everyone who would take the matter
i so lightly. But considering that the more chivalry a
man shows in such oases tho less mercy the woman
displays, we’re not sure whether he ought not to have
told it all, if she wouldn’t let him alone. But, anyhow,
we wonder what it was ho knew and would not tell.
The Australian Eleven were, it seems, far from
i being social successes in England, and the absence of
so many leading orioketers from tneir valedictory ban-
quet, is due, according to the London Figaro, to the
tact that “one or two of the Eleven might have learnt
lessons in politeness from some of our acknowledged
professionals.” This is a very hard thing to say, of
course, and very unpleasant to listen to j but it seems
to be not utterly devoid of fact. It is on record that
soma of the Eleven juggle depressingly with their
knives at meal-times, and one of them has a tendency
to drink his tea in oyster-like gulps from his saucer.
Another has been known to drink the contents of his
finger glass, and to “ worry ” his bread. Then many of
the gentlemen have formed eccentric notions on the
subject cf English syntax, and get hopelessly fogged
upon matters —simple in themselves—not pertaining to
the peculiar profession they have adopted. It is not
the fault of the Eleven if t'-ey are not Count D’Orsays,
but it is to bo wondered at that they don’t improve.
Perhaps they don’t care to be polished, but prefer to be
typically Australian. This is not unlikely. But, then,
we would gently remind them that almost any one can
ha typically Australian, but soc.al polish is with diffi-
culty acquired—even by a cricketer.
If Lord Charles Beresford had not been one of
the most remarkable officers in the British Navy before
the Egyptian war, his smart doings with tho Condor
under tho forts ®f Alexandria would have made him so.
He oomes of a daredevil family, being brother of the
Marquis of Waterford, and has been in the Navy from
the age of 13. When 17, he received a gold medal from
the Liverpool Humane Society for saving a man’s life
at risk of his own, in the water; also the bronze medal
from tho Royal Humane Society, later, for a similar
act. He served in six men-of-war, was lieutenant in
1868, flag-lieutenant on the Galatea in 1872, commander
in 1875, and was promoted to be captain last year.
Though a splendid sailor on duty, he was as reckless as
the wildest colt when off It is related how he took a
11 ig from the mast at an American Consul’s house, and
hung it in a clothes-basket on the masthead of his own
vessel. Of course, there was a great row ; and on
Beresford being ordered to pull it down, he flatly re-
fused. Ha would certainly have been “ sacked," if a
judicious friend had not telegraphed to his mother, and
the answer came, “ Put tho flag back, for my sake.” It
was back in an hour, and the giddy young gentleman
actually—to make his penance more complete—had
himself photographed halt way np the mast, fetching
the drapery down.
That intrepid warrior, Lord Charles Beresford,
has had an ovation (all to himself) on arriving at High-
cliffe, where his mother, the Marchioness of Water-
ford, resides The people took the horses out of his
carriage and drew it to the mansion. They then asked
for fce-r, and subsequently gave three cheers for the
cheese. His Lordship afterwards addressed the
coastguard, and said ho was glao that gallant body
thought ho had done his duty. Then the Coastguard
gave him a foghorn salvo, upon which “Charley”
quoted Harry Lsvien’s speech at Tim worth, and said
that “it was the proudest day of his life,” etc. Then
the mob dispersed, and B. sent “Wales” (we
suppose) a lively account of how he had “ caught on"
with the unwashed. Lord Beresford is a commander
in the navy, his vessel being the Condor. There is no
record, however, as te the manner in which his Lord-
ship’s ship is condoroted—Lord B. being mostly on
shore playing lawn tennis with the Princess Beatrice
and Madelle. Noiele. Oh, and while on the subject of
heroes, we may state that the Duke of Connaught
had a magnificent reception at Windsor. The people
decorated the town, and tho Major, in a half-hour's
speech, thanked the Prince for bleeding for his suffering
country. All this time the Duke (who is a full-blown
General now) was wondering how tho deuoe at the
forthcoming review he would ever get his brigade out
of Hyde Park when once it was boxed in there. No’
notice, by the way, seems to have been taken of the
Duka of Teok, who want to Alexandria to take care of
the royal General. The usual ingratitude of the world I
Now that Mrs. Langtry is gone, the other pro-
fessional beauties of less note, who had to play second
to her in the baanty line while she remained in England,
have begun to plume their heretofore overshadowed
feathers, and the windows of the print shops are bud-
ding forth with photographs of Lady Lonsdale, Lady
Garvagh, Mrs. Livingston. Thompson, Mrs. Cornwallis-
West, and Mrs. Wheeler, Mrs. Cornwallis-West has
genera’!?, in a popular sen.-p, counted number two after
Mrs. Langtry. Some people there are who think her
the prettier of the two. Bat her figure, though un-
doubtedly a fine one, does not approach that of the
Jersey Lily, and her artificial face will not compare for
a moment with Mrs. Langtry’s pure natural complexion.
At a ball Inst wiuter, a distinguished foreigner, before
he heard Mrs. Cornwallis-West’s name, supposed she
was some opera-bontfe actress who had got into the
place by mistake, she was so painted and powdered
over cheek, arms, and neck; her eyes were so picked
out with belladonna, her corsage was so d£oollets, her
voice was so loud and boisterous, and her puses and
gestures had such a decided smack of the heroines of
Offenbach and Le Cooq. On her bodice just over her
heart she wore a large gold padlock. This, she in-
formed several young men who inquired its meaning,
was the lock to the entrance of her love, adding, with a
glance worthy of Schneider in her best days, that even
her husband had not the key. Major Cornwallis-West,
the man who occupies that uneviable position, is a
gentleman of considerable private means, arising from
large landed and mineral interests in Wales. In favour-
able comparison with Mr. Langtry, he goes about with
his wife.
We came across a typographical veteran the
other day, who when he was an apprentice—away back
in the first half of the century—used to carry ” proofs"
to Dickens, At that time, the great novelist was
publishing his books in monthly parts. They were
printed by Bradbury and Evans, of Whitefriars, in
whose establishment our informant was then employed.
The monopoly of printing them is said to have made
the fortune of this firm. The circulation was over
60,000 a month. So that whatever Dickens said was
law in the printing-house at Whitefriars, and accord-
ingly, when on one occasion certain of the compositors
—who seem to have been as perverse then as they are
now—to whom his "copy” had been given, out it up
into nice little slips so that they might all have a slice,
he wrote this laoonio note to the head of the firm.
"It your compositors—blast theml —will insist on out-
ting up my copy I shall take my work away from you.”
Th« guilty typos wero called up and "sacked" on the
spot. But they made it right again with the sveraoer
by the present of a bottle of wine. Dickens was a
wonderfully clean writer—in Ihe compositors’ sense.
His ‘ • proofs ” were returned with hardly an alteration.
In this he was tho exact opposite of Balzac, the French
novelist, who used to drive his printers mad with his
voluminous alterations and additions. Dickens never
wanted more than one “revise,” where Bilzao would 1
insist upon having twenty. When the manuscript was ;
’‘bet up," one proof used to be sent to Diokens and ’
another to Forster—author of “ The Life of Dickens." 1
The alterations hardly ever extended to more than ]
additions or subtractions of “ and," ” the,” and inch i
liae comparatively unimportant words.
A telegram in the Heeald of Monday an- 1
nounosl tuat a body, found in the muddy waters of the
Albart Park lag >on on the previous Thursday, had been
identified as that of Mr. F. J. Mercer, of Sydney, who
immediately prior to his death “ was in destitute cir- .
oumstaaces ” Panvre diahle! It is not suoh a very i
long while since he was, perhaps, the best dressed nan i
in Sydney, and ho was well known until a few months I
ago as a handsome and genial •• man about town." The ■
telegram gives his age at “about 30," but he must
have been considerably older, as he had not «nly j
practiced his profession as a solicitor in London, i
but had served as an officer in the Austrian army as well, 1
and kis colonial experience extended over a space of i
I some two or three years. Mercer’s story is the storj
. of the earthenware pots trying to float down the
stream with the brass ones. When managing olerk tc
i solicitors in Sydney and Brisbane—in which lattei
j city he not long ago lived for a time—he “ went the
( pace," and was sought after by men who had more money
to spend every year than an ordinary professional man
, could earn in five. We remember writing a chaffing nar.
about Mercer, and he came round one day to punch in.
> We were too busy to be punched that day, so he said
he’d call again. Bat he never did. Latterly he was
| out of employment, and to make things worse got a
! sunstroke, which affected his hearing, and probably his
brain. Ho was not regarded as likely to commit
suicide, and, a few days before he died, he wrote cheer-
fully to friends here—to men whom he knew intimately
and who would gladly have sent him money had
he asked it. There are many in Sydney who regret
bit terrible and untimely and, and who are sorry
that they have not only been deprived of the oppor.
trinity of ministering to unfortunate Mercer in his
necessity, and of thus, perhaps, averting his fate, but
that their friend’s remains have received burial at the
hands of strangers.
So the English Government won't recognise
Valentine Baker as Commander-in-Chief of the
Egyptian army 1 We are surprised at this, since
Valentine is, despite his little rail way-carriage episode,
in high favour with every member of the Royal Family
—the Queen alone excepted. Why, even after his trial
and conviction at Croydon, a special message of the
“it-will-be-all-right-old-fellow” description was broaght
to Baker from the Prince of Wales by Viscount Valetta,
and he was permitted to drive away to Holloway Gaoil
in his own carriage, amidst the lamentations of his
officers, while, after the verdict, the fair plaintiff was
very nearly mobbed by a number of persons of both
sexes who “doted on the military.” Colonel Baker,at
the time he was in command of a hussar regiment, was
one of the most envied men in the kingdim. The set
he mixed in was the set, and both Prlnoe Arthur and
the Duke of Edinburgh were, in common with their
brother, greatly attached to him. When he came to
grief there was great consternation in E jyal circles—
even the Dnke of Cambridge personally interceding
with the Queen for Baker being allowed to keep his
rank in the army. But it was no usv. Htr Majesty’s
sympathies were with the doctor’s daughter, it was
weakness on her part, perhaps, but than the weakness
of woman is proverbial. In prison, Baker had three
rooms, and during his incarceration amused himself by
writing some rather bad books, and by entertaining his
friends—all of to him manfully. There
were curious stories told of the doings in Holloway
prison—of the visits of "Charley” Beresford and his
brother the noble L ord Marcus. Fabrications, many
of theie, doubtless. But what is undeniably true is
that the prosecutrix was offered (she was engaged) a
dower of no less than £5OOO not to prosecute, and that
prior to Baker’s departure from London for Turkey he
was entertained at a private dinner by all his principal
bachelor friends, amongst whom was the future king of
England. On his return he was feted as a her*, and
re-elected a member of all his clubs— ‘ White’s,” the
*• Raleigh,” and ” The Rag," included. And yet he will
noc be recognized «s the Commander-In-Chief of the
army of Erypt 1 Eh, hien, the world must be growing
moral. When the fate of nations is concerned, people
are apt to forget all about little mistakes in railway
carriages. They’ve forgotten a heap of things about a
very much greater personage than Valentine Baker.

The Royalties have given a big fillip to mnsio.
They have actually made it fashionable. Therefore,
vice royalties patronise the art But these kinglings
object to pay. The other month the Governor of a
neighbouring colony felt inclined for a musical evening
—on the cheap. An aide accordingly waited on a
young Giro.an professional pianist, not lang from the
Leipsio Conservatoire. Let us call ihe pianist Her-
mann. The aide intimated that his presence would be
tolerated at Government House on such a date, and
smiling tlandly, departed. Hermann thought the
matter out, and next morning wrote, saying that hu
fee for a musical evening would be five guineas. The
following afternoon again came the Governor’s jackal.
“ Oh, His Exoelleaoy does not propose to pay.” “ But
you proposed that I should play." “ Well, you know,
my dear fellow, that is rather another matter. His
Excellency's guests are supposed to contribute to the
pleasure of the ovenimr ’* “But I am not one of His
Excellency’s guests. You came to me as a professional
musician, and as a professional musician I hive given
you my terms. I have received no invitation ” “No
invitation? Is it possible? We can soon arrange
that. Ta-ta,” Next day, sure enough, came a formal
Invitation, and as Hermann ac epted, went, and played,
His Excellency thereby saved live guineas. It His Ex.
oellenoy had been some purse-proud squatter or other
plutocrat, we should have called him a mean
dog 1 While ou this topic, it may be remarked
that there is quite a stir in South Australian music
lust now. The intention is to allure a good man to
Ssuth Australia by guaranteeing him a decent income.
Eacordotal Boult, and other silly amateurs, suggest
that South Australia should obtain a musical graduate
from Oxford or Cambridge. His position, diploma,
wauld give weight, &j. But who ever came across an
Oxford or Cambridge musical graduate worth a red
cent ? These University musical formularies have
never distinguished themselves in the practical field.
And there are men like Max Vegrioh, unattached, at
present, in Victoria ; and Pascal Needham, one of the
greatest musical geniuses Australia owns, wasting his
ate as a bank manager at Freemantle! When men
such as these latter have made a reputation, then the
barren University comes forward with honorary degrees,
and seeks to claim fellowship with their splendid
talents and ownership in their triumphs. “ Better
fifty years of Vogrioh than a cycle of degrees.”

Gentlemen,—The result of the recently-expressed
will of the people having been the overthrow of the
Parkes-Rohertson coalition, it became the duty of the
leader of the Opposition to form an Administration.
Mr. Stnart did me the honour of ashing me to join
him, and I have done so. My acceptance of the office
of Minister of Public Instruction makes it necessary
that I should again offer myself for your suffrages. I
do so in the hope that you will approve the important
step I have taken. Should it prove otherwise, I will
retire from the public life to which you introduced me
with undiminished gratitude for your former kindness.
Awaiting a further opportunity of addressing you,
I am, your faithful servant,

WOMAN ITEMS.
♦
In the milliner's bill of a French lady, recently
before the courts,' the following items appeared:—.
Garters, flounced with point lane. 700 fr. 5 garters, with
horse’s hoofs in diamonds, 7000 fr.; garters oasoa.
douses, 261 fr. Garters with lace flounces we can dimly
picture, and garters with horse’s hoofs wo can faintly
imagine, but what are garters cascadeuses ? Sounds as
if they would come down.
We regret to hear that there is in the minds of
the designers of costumes, au intent to bring women
down to one democratic level, by making them alias
much alike as possible Well-rounded figures being in
the minority, yet every woman insisting on having one,
it is obvious the dressmaker must rise to the emergency.
Some dresses have been made of late almost precisely
similar back and front. It would scarcely be conve.
nient to find the front of a lady’s waist indistinguish.
able from the back; yet Worth’s latest efforts seem to
have an ominous tendency towards this awful state of
affairs. We can only hope that a pardonable prejudice
in favour of the more familiar outline of the female
form will avert the threatened catastrophe.
Some of the mammoth dress bazaars of Paris
are marvellous palaces, where all that is rich, rare, and
costly in the world seems spread out for the temptation
of woman. On busy days, the great Bon Marche has
been known to havo seventy thousand visitors. The
men of genius who manage these stores set out with
the idea that woman is their prey j for her their trap
is sot; and on her cupidity and coquetry rests the real
secret ©f thoir success. A oynica l knowledge of woman’s
nature is indicated by the fact that, though almost ex-
olusively women’s goods are sold, yet 90 per cent, of
the employes are men. Why ? Because the big spiders
who spin the dazzling web of a drapery store have re.
marked that you must have men to coax and conquer
women, and to wring out of them all their substance.
The more mew you have, the more women will come to
be wheedled out of their money. The women prefer to
deal with men. Women, moreover, are jealous of one
another ; the shop saleswoman is often more graceful
than the patron she is serving ; she knows it, and she
can’t retrain from showing it. Henoe irritation, which
is death to trade. And so it happens that at present
the departments of millinery, corsets, and trving on,
are alone in the hands of feminine employe j. Men pre-
side over the counters of morning-gowns even, and in
some of the stores men take the measurements for
dresses. The utter reliance on the patronage of women
is proved by the circumstance that on all the Bon
Marche billheads, labels, address cards, only “Madame"
is printed ; never “ Monsieur." Thus aro the gilded
nets spread for the butterflies of fashon.
There was a Carnival over in ’Frisco which seeme
to have been as big a boom as oar Old English Fairs wetS
here. This is how one old oynio, with true Buchanan
fervour, goes for it“ What is this carnival p It is
the apotheosis of everything that is vulgar, of every,
thing that is inartistic. A lot of young girls and old
women, painted and raddled like harridans, ate
assembled ia the pavilion night after night, engaged in
an exhibition which is a gigantic bore. True, there are
some pretty girls—not too many, by tho way—but oh,
those awful old women ! And where were those lank
and skinny youths, with spindle-shanks and knock,
knees, procured from? Tho sight of an immature
stripling clad in the garb of a Roman or Grecian
warrior, his awful get-up crowned by a round, simper,
ing, foolish face, bowing and bobbing to those among
the spectators who have the misfortune to know him,
would be droll if it were not sorrowful and dull. I can
not see why the fast that a number of benevolent
ladies want to do benevolent things should warrant
young girls in parading themselves before a grinning
mob, partly composed of salacious and dangerous old
bucks, and partly of equally salacious but not so
dangerous young ones. Ido not see why it warrants
these young girls in displaying to the gaze of crowds
portions of their anatomy which they had much better
reserve for the contemplation of their future husbands.”
D’ye hear, Bishop Mahogany ?

HAUNTED.
In a middle street of this
Town a haunted house there is :
Chilly-looking in the light—
Ghastly at the dead of night.
It was built, not long ago.
As a place where each small Show,
Chancing then in town to stay.
Might set up its “props" and play.
So they had a splendid ppr»e,
And they christened it .v.ih glee.
Saying “ Know ye, one and all,
This is the Victorieril.”
Flocking round its portals, then,
Came in crowds the Minstrel-men;
Combination, caravan,
Pure-tred, piebald, black-and-tan.
And they played, and played, and played.
While a shilling could be made;
Until they, beyond a doubt.
Flayed themselves completely out.
Then they advertised, you know.
They had gone up Nor f h to show —
When you see “up North” on bills,
Once again road “ Surry Hills."
Anyhow, the management
Managed still to gee a rent:
For they, when its socks were thin,
Took the homeless drama in.
Drama direst over seen,
’1 hat lor many weeks bad been
Flaying nightly at the Morgue
To a blind man and his “ dorg."
Even this at last grew sick.
Ho they paid it—with a brick—
And fell back on lah-di-dah.
Amateurish opera.
Very much a hit was this
• »nce—then very much a miss.
First night, friends it did enthral j
Last night, spiders on the wail.
To the rescue, then, there came
Man of world-wide fighting fame:
Ran a wondrous Show of Shows—
Music and vermilion hose.
And thenceforth that Hall was known
Everywhere, from zone to zone,
As —you’ll yell when this yon see—
Young Dutchee’s Academoe.
But, alas I its luck was gone; ’
Public coldly stared upon '
Jenny’s ankles, Tessie’s toos.
Lovely lines of Lillie’s hose.
Then there fell upon the Hall 1
Gloom and sorrow like a pall, J
Till, with all his pasteboard things, *
Came the man of many rings.
Owner thought a "pile” he’d struck— |
Changed its name again for lack j \
So the title of that Hall (
Now is Zulu Thompson’s Kraal. ]
Zulu splashed round gifts there—some, ,
Still tne luck nohow would come;
Deadheads dropped in there, and chaffed,
Everyone but Zulu laughed. j
Still the Diorama runs— ]
But this Hail the night-hawk shuns; ,
For there, when the mo jn is low,
Ghastly figures coma and go. j
* * *
We have received a poster about as long as the
youngest member for Mudgee, and as gorgeous as
Zulu Thompson, when that resplendent showman has
all hie jewels on, which, wa gather from its contents, is
intended to galvanize the country towns into the know-
ledge that the “ Sparks Combination of Star Artistes "
is about to visit them. These are very small “ stars ’’
—of the kind that we should call Skye-teiriers. Some
of the ladies of the company, however, are universally
admitted, even by their mends in the profession, to be
clever. It is a good thing to bo so olever that nobody
even dreams of envying you. And, fortunately for the
world, this thing is as common as it is good. The
names of theso ladies are respectively Lillie Howard,
Emily Elliott, Lira de Vero and Nora Martin;
of the gentlemen. Charles Holly, Fred Wilton,
.Tehn Gilmore, Professor Sanden, and George
Turner. Our sorrow at losing this galaxy of genius
is only lightened by the parting promise the agent—
Mr. Durham—gave us, that in case things went badly
he would bring such of the company as would have
survived the fury of the i“ busheea " back in his boot
And speaking of the agent, this is the modest way he
has of putting the wond at its ease regarding his show
I’Ve quote from the bill: “ The management take this
opportunity of assuring the Press and the Pub.io that
nothing of a nature to offend the most faslidion < and
icfined [fastidious and refined wbat P Cuttlefish!'] will
be permitted in their organization, and hope, by giving
an entertainment that will amuse the audience, and
elevate the stage, they will at the sami time secure the
patronage of all classes.” Elevate the stage ! How is
that for high? Why. dear boys, you are too ridiculously
humble. You should at the same time lay yourself out
to purify politics, reconstruct religion, and—get hash.
Principally, get hash. Tte company is a good enough
little company—as such companies go—however. They
opened at Gonlburn on Monday last. From there they
go to Wagga, Narandera, and Hay. Thenco they play
through Victoria.
* * * *
Just a few weeks more, and we
Will lose our own fairEmelie;
For Mr. Wilson, the lessee.
Has told us confidentialee
That from the tenth of next month he
Has let the Opera House, to be
The home of high-class comedee.
For on that date, as sure as sin,
Tho Polks will gaily polk-a in
We hope that they will score a win.
• • •
The entertainment given by Mr. and Mrs. Polk
and company is highly praised by the Melbourne critics.
Which is what we expeated, as they—the Polka—brought
a good name with them from Amoriea when they landed
here. Mr. Polk is a tall, fine-looking fellow, with an
American penchant for wearing his teeth olean. Mrs.
Polk we have not Been, but we hear she is very charm-
ing. And, by the way. they have done very good busi-
ness in Melbourne. Probably, when they come here,
they will open in “The Strategist," which is their
strongest card. They need have no fear of injurious
criticism over here, anyhow. They can always make
sure of a favourable notice from the Shroud by
putting a plate of sandwiches under its critic's chair.
It will be well to replenish this dol« after every act,
because sometimes his friends of the Rum may drop in,
after having had, who knows, bad luck with the corned
beef at the corner bar. But this advice to the coming
comedians mav be premature after all, as in all likeli-
hood the poor old Shroud will be stiff by the time
they arrive. * * * *
They had a pony and a jackass drawing the
sledge on to tho stage in “Fatiuitza* on the first
nights. Suddenly the jackass disappeared. It came
back a week after, completely broken up, with its ears
drooping wearily down its neck, its ribs caved in, and
its tail making piteous attempts to take root in the
mud. It seems the hoarse horao that runs the Shroud
had fallen down a vault, and broke its leg, while trying
to break open a colliu to root out a possible new sub-
scriber, and Wilson, the losses of the Opera House,
had, in a weak moment, lent them his jackass as a

again. The mouldy horror that hangs like a miasmatic
mist around the place where what with dreary but
characteristic faoetiousness is called the “ reading-
matter” of this earthy journal, is wormed wearily out
by dead-eyed, mildewed scribes, together with the task
of wading through the dank drivel of “ Biron,” and
the graveyard ooze of the other " humourists," was too
much far the poor j ackass. Only the dread of falling
again into the clutches of the pit-prowlers keeps it
alive. It need not fear much longer. The worms are
even now gaping for the Ghoul s Qazetie —nobody
else ever looked for it.
** * *
Now, dear public, we are going to give you the
real square business about the Gaiety pantomime. We
have net, up till the present time, been able to give it
that amount of attention which a number of very nice
people—mostly those who play in it, and their friends,
by the way—seem to consider it deserves. We have
been the prey of remorse for over five minutes about
this ; but the faet of the matter is, we got a fit of en-
thusiastic piety a little white back, and pledged our-
selves to specially revise the Scriptures, and wiite a
new hymnology for the Salvation Army. We don t
know whether we made much of a job of this, but,
hallelujah 1 we know that wa are saved, anyhow. Per-
haps somebody would like to have a specimen of one of
our new hymns. Here is a chorus, of which the Can- a ,
tain of the crowd, now in Sydney, was good enough to a
speak in very flattering terms: T
Oh ! we’ll roll up together to the bully golden gate,
Peter he will pass us in—that good old boss 1 tl
So bump along, and jump along, and hump around the S

This is hardly after the school of Moody and Sankey,
or Dr. Watts, but we think it is a heap livelier than any
of theirs. So after this excursion into the empyrean,
we return to the sinful world again.

It was on—let us see—yes. Saturday night last e
wtien we wont to the Giiety. Wo found no difficulty in t
getting a seat, though wo did not come in until the *
pantomime had begun. The house was not bad. but on <
such a night ana in such a season, and with snob an

Not rhyme with Eosa ?
At last, O Rosa ■—
We must turn prosah
Eun rhyme to Rosa 1
which reminds us that we didn’t finish that sentence
we started before we rushed into the foregoing lyric
We meant to say that, under all the favour-
able circumstances mentioned, we can hardly under-
stand why theie was not a larger audience. If it had
not been for the unfailing support of the Tribes, Satur-
day night at the Gaiety would have been no better
than any other night.

Mr. Frank Towers (All Ben Sloper) is by far the
funniest figure in the pantomime. And he hasn t got
to struggle much to achieve this either. Johnny
O’Neill, though, is a first-class Widow Sinbad He
100 a s as if he had made up for the character from a
study of his washerwoman, taken when she was stand-
ing at the back door, and tbe girl was telling her that
Mr. O’Neill had gone to the “ Guv’nor’s levee and
wouldn’t be back tor a week. We like Johnny for his
fat good-natured Irish face, and his judgment m
whisky. As for Tom Buckley, we think we never saw
him looking so handsome as he does in the character of
Cetewayo Certainly he goes through his part very
we ll—especially that part where he has to hug the
fair Petnah.

Hafiz (Miss Vergie Vivian) is very pretty. We
wish the others were—hem I —Haf-iz pretty. The
>• Fiist Fairy," by the way, looked as if she would
" never be happy again" until she could pass a six-
months’ holiday in a sandwich sb«p. To her and one
or two others the reverse of the Gregorian pun would
,ppl y —not angels, but angles Tue Old Man of the
Sea. according to Mr Towers’s conception of him, has
evidently reached his second childhood before the play
begins The audience are facetiously cautioned upon
the piny-bill not to mistake him for Sir Henry Parkes
There was no need of this. H e look s more like a perform,
ing Angora govt th>n anvthing else wo can think of on
the sudden. Miss May Vivian (Captain Abdallah) is a
large and lovely creature—but mostly large. It we were
choosing a captain wo think we should courteously but
firmly skip her. Not, mind you, that we don t think she
is all that—and a good deal more than —the most
exacting critic could require, but simply that we can-
eider the crust of the earth is too thin at this end to
be trifled with. # # #
As Sinbad, of course, Eosa gets the fat
of the piece. When we come to think of it, we like her
a good deal- bat not much, in this charaoter. In a
certain lino of comedy, Eos iis very effective. This is
not the line. But she does look a nice captain, and
drills her soldiers with a gay disregard of military
uonseoutiveness or disciplinarian detail. She is a very
bright martinet—a diamond-drill, in fact.
• • •
But the soldiers. Let us finish laughing. The
soldiers are the multi oat-looking lot of little tatterde-
malions wo ever saw anywhere. Such as are not cross*
oved are shock-headed or knock-kneed or else three-
cornered Their uniforms appeared to have been made
for them by a lunatic with a theory that suits should all
bo constructed of a cer tv in size and boys cut down or
built up to ii 'hem. We wonder whore Prank got
thvse boys. Wa think ho must have had them made to
order, too Wo noticed a wild look in the eyes of some
of them, which at first we p it down to hunger, but wo
ware mistaken Turning the binocular on them, we
discovered that there were several buttons missing from
their coats. Bo this was tbe secret: the little scoundrels
bad gambled them away to other boys, which other
boys we detected by their ineffectual attempts to hide
their exults Hon under a mask of demure uncon-
sciousness. We areas much surprised as grieved to find
that Mr. Towers allows such depravity to exist among
his employ ds.

WHAT WAS IT?

And wistfully looked in—
A squalid-looking wretch, and poor.

Zulu Thompson’s Kraal, alias the Viotorieral,
is nightly filled by a highly intelleetnal and
appreciative audience, each one of which carries
a carpet-bag or a meal-sack under coat or shawl.
They are to stow away the " presents ” in.
Speaking of those, by the way, we noticed
that the sofa we saw in the front passage last
Saturday night was suspiciously similar to the one we
saw there the Saturday night before. Perhaps some
people have a prejudice to drawing-room suites, and a
preference for tea-trays and mantel ornaments. But as
we know that a suite is given away at the Kraal almost
every night, wo don’t pay much attention to this,

The scene-paintings of the Diorama are almost
as good os new, and the figures better than new. be-
cause they have got thoroughly into the hang of the
business. Only the draj-bafiocks do show the wires in
their hoofs when they lift them up; and there is no
concealing the fact that the war-steeds do sometimes
manifest an inclination to walk three ways at once.
But this, again, is nothing.
• • •
We noticed that everybody in the audience
looked with malignant suspicion at his neighbour.
Each one seemed to be counting up how many possible
*• verses” the other might out him out of. And the
eyes of all, we saw, were not directed to the show,
bat skewed round to the gift-stands on eaeh side of the
proscenium. Whenever wo gazed steadfastly at one of
these expectants, he or she would blush nervously,
turn around, stare fixedly ahead, and then in about two
minutes veer back again to the magnetic tea-pot and
candlestick rack.
* * •
Our entrance seemed to cast a pall over the
prattle of a couple of young men whom we very
unconscious of their existence, and equally careless, if
we had been aware, whether it was out off that very
moment or not—did the honour of sitting down in
front of. One whispered something, which, we sup-
pose, was a caution to the other, as it wound up with
the remark that we—we, immortal gods I—would pos-
sibly give them 11 a turn in the Bulltteeh. Thia is not
the first time we have noticed incidents of this kind.
So that we hasten to inform persons of this sort that
they may set their maoassared brows at ease as far as
wa are concerned. We have something batter to do
than giving ‘‘turns” to gooseberry-headed oafs and
foal-foreheaded fools. If a thousand of them were
eternally damned to-morrow, we wouldn’t think the
information worth a line of nonpareil.
* ♦ *
And, by the way, Zulu Thompson says his card-
board eattle walk on wires, because they are of a wiry
breed. This is Z ilu-logical. Also, that one of the
ambulance bullooks, which turns up later on, after
having been stuck full of spears by the enemy in cross-
ing the back-sceuc, is not killed because he is assegai-
oious animal. We think this is about enough.

Mr. Geo. Forbes is to have a benefit at the Gaiety
tbia (Thursday) night, when “ Everybody’s Friend” will
be played. The performance is to be under the patron-
age of the first families of Darling Point. It is, there-
fore, politely requested by the committee of the concern
that those who go there will, if they don't carry a pair
of binoculars, at least wear an eye-glass. We shall put
on our new cardboard cuffs, anyhow, out of compliment
to George, who is a nice little fellow, though he does
drawl and think things a boah. And—cower when yon
read this—Reginald Bloxsome, Esq , is to take part in
the play. Also, Tom Buckley I We don’t thins that
the names of professional gentlemen and mere amateurs

monious manner. Wedon’t, indeed. Rosa Towers, also,
is going to play, and Dr. Byrne, and Mrs. Stammers, and
a lot of others, including the hcneficiarc himself. How-
ever, as he is just about to leave us to go to England,
the fair thing, we think, will be for the public to give
him a good house; for, after all, he is a gentlemanly, ii
not a groat, actor; and noblesse oblige (oujowrs.

Mr. John For da makes an Irishman of Steipan,

with an amused guffaw, “ that’s nothing. I have

, Muagrave has taken to smiling now regularly.
He hates mankind no longer, for mankind crowds to tne
Pantomime. In a word, “ Aladdin” has done upto now
the biggest business over known—beating “ Patience,
and ” Li Masootte,” all to pieces, and placing Rignold S
biggest successes nowhere. Next week, the piece wul
be newly peppered with locals, and one or more of the
actors will be furnished with a fresh song. Johnny Hall
has now completely clutched it. Not only has he formed,
an artistically humorous conception of the part, but his
voice has considerably improved in timhre and volume.
When he tries his hign C in *• You can’t get ’em,” you
can hear him quite plainly in either ot the stage-boxes.
After this, Johnny will have no “ call” to grumble at ns.
Mr. Hall gives as an excuse that he wasn't heard for
the first few nights that when screwing himself up for
a chest note, Mr. Seagrave entreated him not to sing so
loud for fear he should wake—the echoes. Miss Jessie
Grey is full of Greyoe. Her song and dance, however,
only suit her moderately well. She would do well to
substitute—the redoubtable Harry Vincent being agree-
able-something else. “ Pretty as a Picture,” or soma
brand new thing from 'Murker. Maggie Knight, wo
don’t mind telling you in a whisper, draws a fine audience
of her own every evening. He is elegantly attired, and
his moustaches have the “ Life Guards’ droop. He sits
up in the circle, at tho side, every performance, and
sighs so deeply that tho man whe does tho limelight
’ has caught a cold in the back of his neck. No one knows
i who he is, and opinions differ as to whether he is a

Harry Leston’s Wee-ping has been from the
first a very great success, and. ho “ gets" tho people
nightly. Mr. Bam. Poole has settled down into his lot
I all right, but, not being a nigger part, we do not thiuk
he plays Bo Sli quite as it was aboriginally acted. And,
talking of Sam., he was kind enough to enlighten us re
the “Vagabonds" King Charley—or, whatever it la-
in “No Mercy,” which he advertised as “the work of
his brain," and thought people were taking notes of
tho words and. business. Well, Mr. Poole states that,
beyond a crude conception. King Charley—words, biz.,
make-up, and everything—is entirely his own concep-
tion. Alas, poor Julian, and his £5O reword on the
last night of tho piece ! To return to the Pantomime.
Wa must really give Docy Stewart and her nice pa a
line. Miss Stewart works with a will, and gets tho
bulge on the others in the singing line, while, as a bur-
lesque actress, she—however, we'll stop here. Other-
wise, it would take the scene-shifters such a long time
to sweep up the teeth and eye-lashes “ after the battle.”
Mr. Stewart makes what fun he can out of a negative
part, and Mr. A. Farley also gets a ripple out of tho
tew Hues assigned to him —a part not a quarter good
enough. We notice that Miss Grace Henrique?, who
looks nice in a fair wig, gets bouquets. This is good.
It shows that the Sydney theatre-going public are dis-
criminating in their favours to actresses. What they
like is real talent—not mere beauty of form and figure.
And Miss Henriques has three linos which she speaks,
in confidential tones, to the prompter. Bah !

It is of course to Gordon that the enormous
success of the piece is mainly due, but he has been ably
assisted by Mr. Peake, whose harlequinade scenery is
of a Peaketuresque descriprion, and by Mr. Vinson, who
has made the jewels (not Vincent, cheerful comp.), and
by Mr Norris, who is the chromatic artist, and surtout,
par example, by Mons. Massartic, who has had to mani-
-1 pulate a number of ballet ladies —all of whom shine
more at the mangle than at the dance. Of the Mathews
1 family we can say no more than that they are, perhaps,
I next to Miss Henriques and the man who plays the
; 4 r um, the biggest draws in the piece. Theodore and

We are glad to see that the Rand wick Asylum
children are now " off it.” In 1879 they drank £131195.
9d. worth of grog; but this amount has gradually de-
creased, till £3 la. lOd. covers the wine and spirit bill
of the children. Is this only a coincidence, or do the

The Giddy Old Thing of Hunter-street says
in a leader (!)“ The Household troops are a body of
men, some of whom possess and display the most splen-
did physique. In war they must be terrible, but when
they came back from Egypt they showed that they
could be as gentle as children.” Well, we like to see a
girl speak up for her soldier. But we think “ gentle as
children” is rather piling it on. We fancy, on the
whole, the Guards are as gentle in war as at home,
where they haven’t got a chance of making things
lively for the Knightsbridge publicans, and fighting
duels with their belts at street corners. Their gentle-
ness, however, with the cooks in the neighbourhood of
their quarters has never been questioned. There is one
thing certain: that is, that the Household troops suffer
more damage at homo than abroad, since, in one week,
we have read of two of them being knocked on the head
with a quart-pot in a public-house cellar; whereas,
during the whole Egyptian campaign, they only lost
one soldier.

It is said in China that “ women and children
spend every cent they earn.” Well, they don’t save
much hero. Servant girls getting 17s. per week go to
the dress-circle at the Boyal, and trip round in silk
dresses for tea at Quong Tart’s. Kids, too, think
nothing of spending half-crowns in Arcade toothache,
and double that amount in an endeavour to get drowned.
And in cigars, we have seen the little son of a mechanic
expend at one pop as much as a Chinese jeweller could
earn at hard work for a week in his own. country. We
have never seen a Chinaman spend anything in this
country, though.

A theological student, with the appropriate
name of Priestley, was charged with murdering a man
in Auckland, N Z., the other day. As far as we can
make out from the evidence, it was simply an overflow
of piety which made him hatchet his victim to death.
If this be so, and piety increases with preferment in the
church, what an awful depth of crime he would have
sounded if he had lived to have been a curate!—and
then a rector I—and then a dean!—and finally an arch-
bishop 1 We shudder to think of it. It is well this
saintly enthusiasm dies out when the candidate
takes holy orders—immediately, sometimes.
Henry Harrie Cooke, ex-M.L.A. at Forbes, has
found ont that " the best remedy for bleeding at the
nose, is the vigorous motion of the jaw as if in the
act of mastication” This is what we road in his
paper. Evidently, then, on the same morning as he
wrote the article in favour of Parkes, some one sent in
either a pound of candles or a side of bacon. To this
alone can we attribute the discovery embodied in this
nose item.

There has been a row at Perth, in a newspaper
office, and Mr. Stephen M. Stout, late editor of the
Inquirer, has had to “part” three pounds for insulting
Mr. Horace Stirling, one of the proprietors. No one
seems to know what the insult was, but we suppose it
was the usual row about the goose and case of oranges.
We remember a row of the same kind in Sydney, when
the proprietor of a paper, on Christmas eve, carted into i
his buggy all the " samples” except two pumpkins and
a box of toy soldiers, while the staff were expectantly
waiting with gunny bags to “ collar” in the reporters’
room. The sub-editor then resigned, but consented to
resume duty again for two tins of salmon and half a jar
of planus. The others were pacified with a sample can
of railway lubricator each, which they took home in the
firm belief that it was butter, and only one found out
the difference, as on coming to the office next time, with
a very green complexion, he said that clotted cream
always made him bilious.

Now that Cetewayo is restored, all he wants is
an army to protect him. This comes of civilizing
niggers. Before we spent a million or so bursting up
the old man’s kraall, and giving all his wives to John
Dunn, all Cetewayo wanted to protect him was a half-
inch coat of railway-grease and a sceptre shod with
hoop-iron. Now he requires an army to round up his
cattle, and a special staff to get together his wives.
Egypt wants an army of protection, too. We hope to
goodness our Paddington heroes will never win anything,
or else the special constables would have to be called
out to see no harm happened to them. This is modern >
warfare, with a vengeance. It’s too terrible! Worse

Now, here is a little tale which could not be called from
any other source than the columns of a religions paper, .
and as a piece of stately Church intelligence we welcome
it exceedingly. Our contemporary is evidently making
strides. We don't say, though, in what direction.
Oar old friend, Peter Campbell, is at Newcastle ri
wrestling with Beelzebub, and his address is box some- h
thing at the Post-Office. Peter has published a hand-
bill (4pp. foolscap!!) which he calls, with delightful a
simplicity, the 11th annual report in re (sic) —
"ME. PETER CAMPBELL’S
Australian Voluntary, Undenominational, Evan-
gelical, and Itinerating, Town, Village,
Bush and Gold-fields,
Gospel Preaching and Philantrophic Lecturing,
Also Medical (!) and Charitable
Mission.
Instituted upwards of eleven years ago, viz., on
27th December, 1870.”
This is good. Especially “medical.” Wo had a dose
of Mr. Campbell once, but it did hot agree with us. We
were too sinful. "No salary,” says Peter, "has bean
accepted by me for eleven years.” Evidently, then, ho
is able to worry along very well with his collections and
his “ box." We see that Pete has raked in £35112a. I
during the past year, and that, at the present time, the
Mission cash in hand is £0 oa. Od. <\ 11) There’s nothing I
like getting things balanced up neatly 1 Peter publishes
a variety of " testimonials,” none of which, however,
appear to have contained a cash enclosure. Miss Car-
miohael thanks him for “original hymns and leaflets,”
which will " prove a comfort to her on her homeward
voyage.” Mr. W. A. Looney (I) from Ballarat, also (as
might have been expected) is eulogistic of the gifted
missionary; while Sir William Jervois accepted a copy
of his " Melbourne Exhibition discourse ” for the ooal-
box. Perhaps the funniest of all is from Mr. Solomon,
a printer of Pitt-street. Says this gentleman (alluding
to having printed the Wasp):— “From Mr. Henry
Solomon, 156 Pitt-street,, Sjdney, the regular printer
for many years for Mr. Campbell’s Mission —* You are

Mr. Campbell’s labours were “ brought into connection !
with any definite Church organization, it would spoil
their special character,” which is a good though a
cruel joke: and Holloway, the pill-man, writes—“ You

People who don’t make a living by it are
beginning to be aweary of sueh a surfeit of cricket. The
Herald’s Melbourne correspondent, in his last letter,
_ says: “ I hate cricket; but, if there is anything I hate
.'worse than cricket, it is football.” This is severe, but
happy. Now we—let us tell it with Bunthome-like
candour—we don’t care about cricket now The affair
has grown too sordid; and the language of the cricketing
reporters has become so mournfully monotonous. We
have long been haunted by it. But you shall have our
“ straight griffin *• in a simple little measure (we will
add, and at once dash the hopes of the Shroud people
to the ground) of poetry. Here you are:—
AFFECTING MEETING BETWEEN THE
SPEAKER AND HIS EXCELLENCY.

Hope your face I’ll soon get used ter."
Hon. Toby.— “Oh, Lord Loftus, tell me true—
How’s the bantam and the rooster ?”

A WILD SUGGESTION.
[Eespeotfnlly offered to the Eev. and handsome Dr.
Colletti, on leaving for Italy and receiving a testi-
monial.]
Another pnrse, and ere on board you get
Another inkstand and a coffee-set;
And slippers worked by dainty hands to boot—
A “ C.” in beads, embroidered on each foot.
And then the choir!—those singers must, you know.
Hand round the hat, dear boy, before you go;
And when they've scooped in ev’ry bit of ** tin,”
Come round and give it with a sheepish grin.
The sacristans will give—the acolytes
Will mournfully contribute their poor mites;—
The dead, too, o’er whom tombstones are erected.
Would give—if 'twere convenient to collect it.
All things considered, we predict, indeed.
Most holy Father, you will " hold the greed."
A little whisper, though, ere you depart,—
A little something that should touch the heart I
There are upon the streets on which yon tread.
Parishioners who—foolish things!—lack broad.
Well do what priest has rarely done before—
Oat of your purse give something to the poor ;
’Twill be a graceful thing—no one can doubt it—
And think, too, of the novelty about it.
The ant-trade is a curious line. The eggs are
sold for feeding peasants. Big fortunes are made by
some ant-merchants. There is Mademoiselle Blanche,
of Paris renown She has negociants in all the depart-
ments that possess large forests, and never receives
less than ten millers’ sackstul of ants daily, her trade
extending even to Germany. For all her pile. Made-
moiselle would be rather too much of a matrimonial
catch. Her face and hands arc tanned as though they
had been prepared by some skilful tanner; she is
clothed in buffalo skin, and in spite of this armour she
is devoured by her stock-in trade. But her skin has
become so hardened and insensible from long practice,
that she can now deep surrounded by sacks full of her
merchandise undisturbed by their stinging. No parti-
cular person would care about being a sleeping partner
in such a eonoern.
Here is a string of orient pearls from the
Ncozb:— "A box containing money and other valua-
ble has come ashore. The contents had been ab.
straoted.” "The white population of New Zealand hag
increased by 75,521 persons in 13 months. This is ex-
clusive of Maoris.” “Archbishop Vaughan takes a
* spell ’ in April, when he goes to Europe on a holiday
trip. His mentor and Fides Achetes Dr. Gillet accompanies
him.” No pen but Alfred’s eould have dashed off these
sybilline sentences. We have always given him credit
for deep humour, but we never thought he oonld be to
fathomlessly funny as this. At the same time’we think
Dr. Gillet has good grounds for an action against the
Nooze. Alfred is a sly dog, though—whenever he wants
to abuse anybody, he always invents new epithets.
What is “ Fides Achetes ?" Trojan for saveloy ?

This is the time of the year when retailers pri- 1

The Order of St. Michael and St. George is now

A celebrated team of cricketers, who stayed at

Up Gympie way, a little girl was recently

The weather has been so cool this Christmas at
Adelaide that the colonists believe boll is no longer
located near. There is no knowing what Billy Townsend
could do. He always worked hard for his adopted
country, and his powers of persuasion were remarkably
great. Nothing like having a friend at court I
Queensland humour, like Queensland rum, is
frequently almost fatal. Up in Maryborough, lately,
three blackfellows, who were drinking in a hotel,l be-
came troublesome, and the landlord, taking down a
gun, jocosely shot one of them in the back of the neck,
and asked the trio to leave. They left.
Says the Shroud: “The Chief Secretary of
Victoria was called upon by Sub-Inspector Larner to
resign his office in the police.” The 11 Chief Secrecary
was, was he ? It’s peculiar how these sick scribes get
the “police” mixed up with every second item. It
would be less peculiar, only the police are lenient.
A “ married woman,” sixteen years of age, was
Iving drunk in one of the principal streets of this city
the other day. Her husband had beaten her, and she
had got drunk “to spite him." We are tired of moraliz-
ing about these atrocities. Here the fault was on
neither side. The parties should never have come
together—the girl should have been in a reformatory,
the man in the hulks.
An enterprising obemist sent a box of tooth-
paste to the Shroud office, the other day, when a man
in authority there, happening to hear of the oirenm-
stance, want into the reporters’ room to inquire about
the matter. He then found the staff had borrowed a
loaf from over the way, and were making anchovy sand-
wiches.
More Muddle. Tolls were collected at some
gates on New Tear’s Day, although the bar-keepers’
business died the same instant as poor old Anno

busy crawling out of the mud and Scraping its clothes,
that it had no time to attend to the paltry affairs of an
“ ungrateful public.”
The mathematical professor for the Shroud,
after laborious processes of calculation, has discovered
that breach-of-promise Fryer’s salary of lls. per day
amounts to a gross income of just £1 per week. Now,
if Fryer were on the Shroud staff, we might understand
this convenient little style of “ book-keeping by no

Jack M'Elhone says the Botany blacks were
starving upon Christmas Day. What of that ? One-
third, anyhow, ottheir white brethren who were feasting

prayer are healthy—and they get plenty of prayer,
anyhow.

Judge Dowling thinks that jurymen should
have an arm-chair and a table in front of them. We
think so too—jurymen on criminal cases. We might
also suggest water-melon, copies of the Holy Howl,
and other light refreshment. With regard to the jury-
men who try libel cases in the Supreme Court we have
something to suggest for them also. But it is neither
arm-ohaira nor water-melons.
Because a boy round Bendigo (Yic.) way, threw
(for luck) a hob-nailed boot after a newly-wedded pair,

Living is high just now at Bonrke—extremely
high We have it on the authority of a “universally

“Pastor Allen, in his last temperance howl, says
that “ on the day of the election waggon loads of men
with short black pipes conld be seen going to the polls

short necks and wide months. As for men with barbed

A certain veterinary surgeon in this city who

supplying the staff with a novel luxury—soap, of course
—if he happened at the same time to be in the butter
trade and would consent to “take it out” in t hrouds.

A well-known athlete named Chaplin, living in

This is appropriate, but jet astonishing to us. We
were, up till now, under the impression that the soul of
the hanged bushranger had entered into the body of

then; so, we suppose, if the horse has it, he has none
now.
Mr. Muller, a Hungarian gentleman, is a bit
unsettled. He lit a cigar the other day, and, after a
puff or two, found himself sailing towards Pasth in a
Budaful manner. He brought up a mile or two off
Isaged, and picking himself together with difficulty,
harked hack to inquire what was up. He then dis-
covered that all his weeds were charged with dynamite.
His merchant explained when he came out of the hos-
pital that the affair arose out of a mistake. Mr. Muller

Queer facta for Temperance folks. The Mel-
bourne Hospital report shows that a surgeon, disig-
nated “ A,” treated 422 patients, and prescribed for
them 471 pints of brandy, 83 bottles of champagne, 192
pints of wine, 11 pints of whisky, and 900 bottles of ale
and porter. He lost per cent, of his patients. “D”
treated 333 patients, to whom he gave 271 pints of
brandy, 147 pints of wine, 2 bottles champagne, and 92
bottles ale and porter. He lost 10 per cent, of his
patients. “F ” gave 600 patients 467 pints of brandv.
86 pints of wine, 3 pints of gin, 18 pints whisky, and 52
bottles of ale and porter. He lost 18 iper cent. “E ’,

63 pints of wine, 3 pints of whisky, 11 pints of rum,

A lot of Senior-sergeants of Police are to be

abuse their benefactors”—that is to say the doctors and
other officials connected with that institution. Now all

A certain very melancholy journal which is,
we believe, published in Bathurst, is, we learn, to be
disposed of shortly on the Art Union principle. We
remember having seen this paper once—round a cheese,
we think—but it had such an uninviting, not to say
repulsive look, that the only attention we cared to give
its literary matter was to wipe the cheese-knife on a
strip of the 44 leader 44 This paragraph, however, is
written with a serious purpose, so we must not he
frivolous. The Gaming Act is very hard on a man who
raffles a clock or a terrier pup. We don’t see why,
therefore, the Crown should not prosecute the promo-
ters of this raffle, while we do see why it should. There
are these two grounds for a prosecution. (1.) The
raffle is not for a charitable object, in that the paper
will surely kill the man who wins it—cases where this
would be charity are not considered bcoinso cises of
this kind have as tittle to do with papers as they can
help. (2) The paper is not a work of art—unless
a special provision is male in the clause regarding
Art Unions for the products of aboriginal art. We
trust the authorities will take notice of this matter.
Of course Christmas couldn’t pass without the
purgative poets wading up to their nocks in knock-

" Over a lowly virgin's child.
Seraphs wheel on wings of fire.
Singing God and sinners reconciled.
Anthems spring from every lyre."
That’s good, and we could predict the usual brilliant

A jolly old Churchman in a N.S.W. district,
who liked his living to be, like his Gospel, good, sent hia
revered Minister some very ohoioe wine for Communion
purposes, and announced his intention of being a
regular communicant. Next Sunday, the whole of the
most pious church members were simultaneously
attacked with gripes. The presenter of the wine after-
wards interviewed the parson, who ooelly replied,
“ Well, yen see, my dear brother, I found your wine too
good for Church purposes, so I placed it in my cellar,
and bought a lot of cheap colonial. Stay till Igo down

A Campbelltown boy went to wake up another

sut thoroughly, pulled the trigger and shot the other
boy through the skull. Then the boy woke, but refused

“ Electric light at Circular Quay a groat ano

He believes a terrible accident will be caused one of
these days, and then the Legislature will compel all
wires to be earned underground. In the event of a
building, to which electric wires are fixed, being hnrnt
down, the firemen would have all their time folly
occupied dodging the electric currents. If a fireman
chopped the wires with an axe (in mistake tor the

he would tumble into the nearest gutter with all the
wild enthusiasm that a long-lost che-ild with a straw-

The Forbes election ended in a big drunk. A
certain gentleman (wo will not say a legislator) foaling
sleepy, and being under the impression that he was at
his hotel, took off his shoes and flung them out of the
window. They are now being utilised, we understand,
for tho carriage of timber.
A TEAGEDY.
One Deas lit his fire with powder.
Then came a bang load, then one louder ;
The fire out roared,
Then upwards ho soared—
Bight in the direction of Chowder.
Not long since, we told how a R.C. clergyman
| exhorted his flock to “ stump up,” or he’d have to go
without his Christmas dinner. Now another “ Ahmin ”
grinder—having got a few months’ leave—has sent cir-
culars round to his lambs, inviting them to meet for
the purpose of raising a testimonial to him, or he won’t
be able to go. For of such is tho kingdom of Theology.
A gorgeously-dressed —well —lady at the great
cricket match in Melbourne was flashing the English
colours to an enormous extent, when Ivo Bligh hap-
pened to enquire of Captain Standish who she was.
The Captain said ho would ask, and soon came back
seyingi “Oh, that’s Mrs. Blank. She was born In Bal-
larat, and they used to call her tho * Long-Handled
Shovel.'"
The last quarter’s Victorian Customs returns
show a drop from £4990 to £1246 in tho hop duties.
There was an increase in imported beer, but no falling
off in excise that cannot be accounted for by the aboli-
tion of the beer duty. These are “ pints," which, wo
think, quart to be-’ere considered. What is the beerial
substitute for hops? Go slow, and don't guess in
jumps.
The last story about tho Czar is that he was
discovered standing in one corner of his palace dodg-
ing big rubber footballs, which his attendants were
throwing at him. It is supposed that he was practising
for his coronation. If there is any man in the world
we would like loss to change pieces with than John
Davies, it is the Czar. Every wag who has one joke to
crack, cracks it about him.
A man in Auckland recently murdered his wife
with a boxdron. She had previously thrown a toasting-
fork and a brick at him. This is all the fashionable
N.Z. intelligence we can rake in this issue. We believe
that the sympathy of a portion of the Auckland people
is so far with the bereaved husband, because, when his
wife throw the brick at him, she broke the kitchen
clock.
He had married a dashing girl. He liked them.
Well, he used to be away all day at his biz.; but one
morning he thought ho would take a couple of hours'
lounge on the verandah before facing the glare. Ho
was just dozing, after a pipe, when he hoard the piping
voice of his eldest-horn say “ Don't ceme in, Mr. Fitz-
Gubbins: pa ain’t gone yet.” He is doubtful on the
subject of dashing girls now.
It was noticed that a detective had twins (we
mean his wife, of course), but we now have to chronicle
the fact of an artilleryman’s wife being similarly
favoured. This heroic bombardier has now a family of
five and as he has 14s. a week to keep them on, it will
be seen that he is gradually acquiring a condition of
great affluence. Oh, and by the way, we mustn’t
forget that he gets his contract rations. This is indeed
a blessing.
The editor of the Murrumbubfah Signal (!)
saved a man’s life, and the man sent him £5OO. Tho
day it arrived the hotel boots was chartered to grind at
the double demy,and the Editor was seen doing the rustle
block with one glove and a cane. There is a rumour about
tho township that he has ordered a belitopper from
Sydney, and the minds of the populace are greatly
excited; and intelligence reached ns just before going
to press that he only bows to the bailiff, and is “dead
cuts” with the gravedigger. Phew!
A lady writes to the Tamworth Observer to
ask them to say that she fell in the gutter and got two
of her legs broken, and asks what they’ll charge for in-
serting the item. “There is nothing to pay, good
madam ; we aro ever ready to attend to the complaints
of ratepayers, and we only trust the Council will as
readily remedy the evil of which you complain, as we
direct attention to it.” Wo wouldn’t charge a lady for
this, either; but if she broke more than two, legs
she would have to pay “ Hold the Fort ” rates.
The S.M. Hirald chaffs a parliamentary can-
didate for his faulty construction of a sentence, thus :
“ One gentleman says, 4 1 trust that tho foregoing sum-
mary of my views will bo deemed worthy of yonr
approval ’ Probably he means, 4 1 trust that you will
approve my views, as set forth in the above (!) sum-
imury.’” Now, faulty construction is not half as
stupid as bad grammar. It doesn’t matter much, but
when you get such a hypercritically correct writer, you
feel inclined to ask him when tho adverb “ above ’ bo-
came an adjective ?
A Miller’ a Point divine, recently gave his j uvenile
flock a picnic Objecting on conscientious grounds to
Olontarf or Chowder, he invited his crowd to the Flag-
staff Hill, aud after letting thorn cool themselves there
for 6 or 7 hours, buns and ginger-beer were served out,
and the proceedings terminated. The minds of the
punils are now portly exercised as to the prevailing
prifee of lithofraoteur, and partly as to tho peculiar
effdhta produced by ginger-boer and buns on empty
little stomachs.
They are getting civilized in the Far North. The
first local in the Palmer Chronicle is as follows
••Baffle,—The throwing for the piano, machine and
kilter takes place this evening at the Criterion Hotel at
9 o’clock.” Evidently tho police up there have got
more to do than grease their whiskers and persecute
young ladies at church fairs for gaming. Tho paper,
too. is not afraid of its opinions. We wonder, by the

The Walhalla Chronicle must have received
its inspiration from the Shroud, the Western Post,
the Baewon Argus, or similar journalistic ventures.
We cull from it the following enthralling paragraph :
“ The heaviest rams (sic) which have fallen for some
time visited Moondara and the neighbourhood of tho
Tyres, and Tangil, on Sunday and Monday last, the
graizers being jubilant (sic) over the downpour which
they freely express could not hare come at a better
time.” It is plain that our Victorian friends are dons
at journalism. But we found that out when the Bum
came over.
Sydney Punch, we see, has changed hands,
Messrs. Hicks (the former proprietor) and J. G.
O’Connor being the advertised buyers. The purchase-
money was £351 Ooce upon a time—before the advent
of The Bulletin—Punch was a valuable property. A
little while ago, when the Daily Telegraph began to
chaunt its praises. Punch must have been worth at
least £5O. But it has succumbed to the adulation of
its fatal King-street admirer, and been sold for less
than the price of a time-payment funeral. Once, when
we were prosecuted for libel, Mr. Darley, Q.C., praised
Punch, and said he liked its “ wholesome fun.” Thirty

Lewis Scott is going up for an aldermanship (of
Leichhardt); and, if he gets in, he announces himself
ready to put down several things, including choir-prac-
tice, suicide, mosquitoes, and the introduction of
trousers’ buttons and bits of tho Evening News into
tho Petersham sausages. Lewis’s address to the rate-
payers was listened to attentively by his baker and
ginger-beer merchant. The latter applauded vocifer-
ously ; but it was subsequently discovered that he was
hard of hearing, and thought Lewis was advance agent
for a circus. After this speech, Mr. Scott was seren-
aded by tho populace with a kerosene-tin obligato, and
driven triumphantly homo to his mansion in the ice-
cream part. Lewis’ return is considered doubtful as he
is being opposed by the sexton —himself a humorist.
We have received several communications on a
matter which has become too publicly talked about to
render hushing up possible. It is well known that a
few days ago one Civil Servant horsewhipped another
in the Surveyor-General's office. Had this been any
petty personal quarrel, where momentary passionled to
Mows, it might be both charitable and seHsible to let
it drop ;it could scarcely concern tho public But
1 every one is aware that it is not such a case We are
in full possession of the facts ourselves ; we know the
names and positions of the parties, and know exactly
how and why one officer administered castigation to
1 another. We do not purpose to publish t’ eae parti-
culars—not yet,—for we presume an official inquiry
will be held Even though the fracas be over, Govern-
ment cannot be utterly disregardful of the characters of
its officers, who are at least supposed to be gentlemen
’ It is because we know the why, and others know it, that
we say such inquiry, a strict and stern one, and a fair
decision, are called for.
The Hon. Ivo Bligh was a great sensation in
’ Melbourne. He was invited to a gothic villa at south
Yarra the other day, and ho had to take his boots off
before he could get in at the door, and, when he pulls
his hat down so as to shade his eyes, he looks like
i Mayne Bead’s Headless Horseman dismounted. He is
no relation to the historic Nellie Bligh who was told to
i Bring the broom along.

There is an old lady living up in Penrith, who
resided in that town 52 years without ever seeing
Sydney. She name down with her husband —who
hadn’t been here since the completion of the railway—
for the first time on Boxing Day Her impression of
the metropolis was that it was a flourishing branch of
hell, and she started right back home, taking her
unwilling husband with her. His idea was very differ-
ent. Ho believed he had got into a kind of Paradise,
where a man might get drank and be happy all his
time. Of course, this enthusiastic estimate was a
reaction from the experience of Penrith, which is
famous for the worst liquor, served in the dirtiest
glasses by tho ugliest barmaids in the world. It ia
famous for nothing else except, perhaps, a steam
lannch, driven with a fish-kettle, wnich runs up and
down the Nepean Biver for tho benefit of tourists.
Here is a letter which was sent to the editor of
a Cooma paper lately:—“ Dear sir i se by a paragph in

and please to alter the word Fate for his teat and give

Had it af been a mouev man some long paragph wold

thought; to have found tho “Intelligent Vagrant” in
Geoma? There is no donbt about it, however : such
periods could never have b*on turned by another pen.
The internal evidence, also, ia overwhelming. Even in
Cooma, and before he could Lavs been there many honra
—for it is a long tramp to Mouaro—they seem to have
taunted him with being “thik sculod.” Poor old

Old Mo., of Wellington (N.Z.), a wily old son
of Napthali, got rich by usury. He wanted to become
a member of the Club, and was nominated. But the
Gentiles ruthlessly pilled him. Mo. sat about paying
them out. Now, it was the Club’s boast that their
edifice (like our vanished Garden Palace) was the first
object of beauty seen coming up the harbour. Mo.
bought the proper site, and right in front of that “object
of beauty" erected a huge, ugly, grimy, frowning five-
storied warehouse, and is talking ab*ut making it a
boiling-down establishment. When visitors come
along and ask where’s that fine building, the Club, Mo.
sends 'em round to the back, and laughs deep down ia
the depths of his Israelitish soul. Fact.

Two holy men were talking about rain
lately. “We had a drought which had almost de-
stroyed our crops, when, in answer to our prayers, it
rained copiously," said one. " What foolish people,”
said the other, “you must be not to have prayed for
rain before you had lost half the crops.” This reply
sounds like sense; but it isn’t, for all that If prayer
couldn’t bring down rain, it couldn’t influence the other
laws of nature. It is quite as easy to believe that the
Almighty will reverse the law of nature that regulates
rain, at the entreaty of a man with lawn sleeves and
a fat pannob. as to believe that He will suspend the law
that links effect to cause all along the line of ages, and
ties the soul of man inexorably down to tho oonse-
qnonces of its own misdeeds, at the prayer of tho same
person. Of course, wo believe both—the clergy are
amongst our staunchest supporters. It we didn't, wo
should want to know of what use all these high-
salaried, well-fed, broadcloth-covered gentlemen are to
the publio who support them. But with instinctive
delicacy we feel that this question would be ns im-
pertinent us it is inconvenient. Therefore, wo simply
look on in silence and—wink.
We have dug up another new poet. We don’t
know where he lives, because, with a caution ohorao-
toristio of tho true child of the Muse, ho prefers to
keep his address a profound secret between himself and
his washerwoman. But that don’t matter. Here is his
first fancy :
“ The wild rcss in the woodland burns.
The dragon fly darts o’er the nils ;
Upon the wind from marble urns
Tho mignonette its fragrance spills.
The which my idle fancy turns
To pills."
Now, this is not at all bad. It combines the sweetness
of Simonides with a poetical peroration worthy of
the late Minister fer Mines. But the following is
unique
•* The cows walk around
Upon the ground,
With look profound.
“ They never stop to drink.
They only wink.
And don’t think.
“ They hear the crows caw.
They hear the jack-daw.
But they let that pats,
While the emerald grass
They chaw."
There is a Saxon simplicity about this which is inex-
pressibly charming, after the laboured lyrios of such
drivellers as Swinburne, Tennyson, Morris, and the
rest. This new poet of onrs, in addition to having a
keen eye for noting the habits of animals, has also a
command of idyllic cadences worthy of Theocritus.
But, in sober earnestness, w- think this last a cameo.
It is too funny to be made fnn of.
In Queensland there ia an aboriginal refuge
called Durundur. The blackfellows are induced to
settle there by the preliminary present of a blanket and
subsequent doles of damper and tobacco. At present
the total number who are living in luxury at this
reserve is forty. The trustees thereof, in their report,
state that even those few are decreasing every day, and
put a head on the whde philanthropic folly about
civilizing the Australian aboriginal in three sentences.
“ The natives are without ambition or desire to live in
any other way than as a nomadic race. Any restraint
or persuasion to change, or even to modify their habits
of life, is only irksome and troublesome to them. Wo
shall, therefore, continue as we have hitherto done, to
regard them as an unfortunate and short-lived people,
and to extend to them such help and consideration as
circumstances will allow." This ia the stack truth.
Numbers of good people are d -ooived every day by
melon headed missionaries who whoop at the giaaud-
watery enthusiasm of old ladies at D .rcas meetings by
descriptions of the dreadful spiritual state of tho blacks
and of the obligation of all who held anything from
half-a-orown upwards to assist in bringing them into
the fold. Why, it would cost more to fumigate them
than their souls would be w rth. And the attempt at
civilizing, as at present oonduotod, cannot succeed with
them. Nothing in nature m over dono violently. If
you can get the first generation you take in hand to
wash twice a year and wear at hast one garment, you
will have made a huge stride. By the time they wash
fortnightly, and begin to get expansive in soap, three-
fourths of them will get cold and go dead of consump-
tion. Civilization, syphilisation and rum will soon
solve the native question.
Mr. G. Neville Griffiths, M.P.
Our portrait this week is that of Mr. G. Neville
Griffiths one of the members for East Sydney.
Mr. Griffiths was born in this city in 1840, and is
the second son of Mr. G. R. Griffiths, of Griffiths,
Fanning, and Co., of Spring-street, Sydney. At
an early age heentered Dr. Wool’s school at Parra-
matta, and in 1853 ho proceeded to England to
continue his studies there and on the Continent.
In 1800 he took his degree at Cambridge, and re-
turned to the colonies. After residing in various
parts of N.S. Wales, Mr. Griffiths went out and
formed a station in Western Queensland. This
was in 1865, and he remained engaged in the
rough work of a pioneer till 1871, when he re-
turned to N.S. W. Since 1874 he has carried on
business as pastoral agent, and, owing to his largo
experience in the pursuit, he has been very success-
ful. Mr. Griffiths was for some years a director of
the A J.S. Hank. He has taken an active and
prominent part in the project for the export of
frozen meat, and has assisted materially in other
ways to develop the great pastoral interest of the
country. Mr. Griffiths is comparatively an un-
known man, but his programme, as announced in
East Sydney, is vigorous, liberal, and progressive.
He begins his political career under the rare
auspices of a victory on principle.
A new disease, which is either attributable to
the consumption of parasitic mutton-food or to tho
“ election” of Sir Henry Parkes, baa broken out at
Tenterfield. The symptoms are at first like those of
mild strychnine poisoning ; then follow mania and con-
vulsions, during which the patient tries to dash his
brains out, and to bite anyone who comes his way.
Thus a writer in Vanity Fair: —“ The cap-
sizing of the Austral is an event which ... I can-
not bat regard with unmixed satisfaction. Again and
again in these columns have I pointed oat the great
danger there arises to shipping from the practice of
building then with ballast compartments which, when
the vessel is loaded, are pumped clear of water and left
full of air in order by their buoyancy t® support a
greater weight of cargo; tho result being that the
vessel is thus turned into a light bladder, with a heavy
weight on top of it. No doubt a vessel thus handled
will boar more cargo; but she is, under these circum-
stances, in a condition which renders her likely to
"turn the turtle” at any moment on the slightest pro-
vocation. I have called attention to tho practice and
pointed out its danger more than once; and, as it Is clear
that the owners of tho Austral do not read Vanity
Pain, or do not pay that attention to its warnings that
all reasonable persons are bound to give, I sincerely
trust that they may lose their vegan! altogether, and
thus laaru a lesson which the voice of pure reason b-H
failed to toaeh them.’*

MR. HENRY COPELAND,
Joseph Chamberlain of the New South
wiles Assembly, and the well-tried man who,
rhapa above all others, aided in deposing the
Aiinifltry of Corruption and Snufflebusterism from
its high perch. ]
Henry Copeland is now Minister for Works,
nd has been condemned by the Evening News j
an j t jj o Imported Daily for his action in accept-
ing that position, instead of the Ministry of Mines. (
Mr. Copeland’s reason for declining the
portfolio of Mines was
That he himself held largo mining interests,
and that he could not conscientiously
serve two masters —himself and the country
—as did the late Treasurer, who, being
a private wharf-owner, “ managed ” the ,
publio wharves.

The Evening News condemns in Copeland
what, according to its own showing, would, a
few months sinee, almost have redeemed the
character of WATSON.
The oat is out of the bag, Sydney Smith (0 i
shade of the genuine article!), who supports
Copeland’s opponent, goes to advertise at New-
town the thirst for office of Noah Sutherland,
whose friends, for purposes of their own, have
named him “ Honest John.”

is the tool of three disappointed office-seekers—
John Sutherland
David Buchanan

who, while loudly professing indifference, were
secretly, through their friends, using the ex-
tremest pressure to force Mr. Stuart to include
them in the Ministry.
Who is Sydney Smith ? Why, a relative of
Smith who has joined Tom Chapman in
business. Who is Tom Chapman? Why,
John Sutherland’s son-in-law. And who
is John Sutherland? Why, ‘‘Honest
John.”
“ Honest Noah Sutherland ” (who was in
his prime when Captain Cook arrived here) was
not given office because —
(1) He is an almost unlettered man, and utterly
unfit to control trained officials.
(2) Because when a colleague of Parkes ho was
a mere tool in the hands of the Public
Works officials, who naturally wish to see
him hack.
(3) Because he belongs to the old regime and to
the order of played-out political stalactites
and rock-oysters.
(4) Because the Stuart Ministry found out
that there was a land-compensation grab
on, particulars of which, etc.
David Buchanan did not get office because
he is the most selfish, unreliable, and unpatriotic
politician in Australia, who has shed his skin and
changed his colour more often than even Coonan-
barabi Bey.
Dan O’Connor was not given office because he
is a man of words, not of ideas, a “bladdorskite,”
who is all things to all men —who utterly lacks
political independence and sincerity, and is in fact
the Greek Oily Gammon. Wore Dan. O’Connor
and his disappointed friends made Ministers, who,
to quote his own ‘‘luminous” words, "could
wolld this hetherojanyus mass into homo-
genayaity
Why Mitchell, the wolf-in-sheep’s clothing,
should not be elected :
(1) Because he wishes, sow-fashion, to devour
his own offspring—because he is endeavour-
ing to destroy the as yet untried Govern-
ment he helped to bring into power.
(2) Because he is the nominee of Water-Jug
Foster and Co., and is being " sooled-on ”
and backed by the whole of the corrupt
faction who, during the Parkes’ regime,
skulked about the Treasury with a com-
pensation crowbar in one hand, and a
plunder-bag in the other.
(3) Because he is* hut the despised tool of a
well-whipped crowd, who, themselves, fear-
ing renewed defeat, are ready to Coal-esoe
with anyone against the regime of political
cleanness.
(4) Beoause Mitshkll is a political nonentity
—having been twelve months in the As-
sembly without doing anything beyond
acquiring for himself the nickname ot *‘ the
wooden coal-man,” and for his seat ‘‘the
wood and coal heap ”
(5) Because he avowedly comes forward on a
selfish question of personal pique, and
beoause personal politics have been the
parents of corruption in this colony.
(6) Beoause, should Mitchell ha successful, the
work of last election will be undone—be-
cause Mitchell’s success means Parkes’
triumph—the disintegration of the Aus-
tralian national party the fusion of
the Professors of Self with the Party
of Corruption. Because he and his
supporters are trying to raise a reli-
gious cry. The electors all over the
country have just decided that +hey are
sick of sectarian politics. Now that the
country has got rid of the Denominational
bug-bear, let no man, successfully, raise up
a new one. Chuck him out.
Let every man who wishes to advance the
prospects of honest up-straight and down-right
Administration vote tor Copeland. The Stuart
Cabinet promises to work without faltering or
flinching. There is no reason to doubt the recti-
tude of their intentions. The sensible course is
to give them a trial, judge by their actions, and
if they turn aside from the straight path, The
Bulletin will bo the first to start the kicking
which will hoist them from Bridge-street to
Tenter-field

POLITICAL POINTS.
“ Sir John Robertson should have been elected
Speaker," say some of the journals. But how can you P <
The American Civil Servants cannot vote any t
more. Ours can, but they can’t vote enough, can they, 1
Sir Henry ? ‘
Mr. Longmore’s opinion of Mr. Munro is that *
the latter is "the assassin of the Liberal party," and (
a thousand Judas Iscariots rolled into one." (
Since Mr. Barton’s election, one of the disap- <
pointed aspirants for the Speakership has behaved him- f
self in a most extraordinary manner, and has had a
dispute, which nearly culminated m a fistic encounter,
with a member of the Cabinet.
A man was looked up at Walgett for drunken-
ness just previous to the opening of the poll at the late
election there. A canvasser for one of the candidates
bailed out the ‘'drunk," lugged him round to the booth,
saw him record his vote on the right side, and then
toted him back to the look-up again. This is what is
called " intelligent voting” in this country.
“ It would be indeoent enough under any cir-
cumstances to display this craving for instant power,
but in view of the fact that the Opposition have 87
members against them, it would seem to be as quixotic
as it is unreasonable to hasten their own collapse.”
Daily Telegraph of a fortnight since.
When will you, crass lopsided Bum,
Talk common souse, or else be dumb ?
H«w long will rave that Winding Sheet,
That weekly howls there in King-street ?
West Australia has in some respects been ahead
of somewhat sleepy New South Wales. Long ago, com-
pulsory education was adopted, and High Schools
established to a limited extent. The Mayor also, as in
some of the sister colonies, is elected by the vote of the
ratepayers, thus doing away with aldermanio cliques,
and makinglthe position higher and more honourauie.
DAN THE DESEBTED.
" A noticeable man with large grey eyes,"
And hair of silver grty.
Sits with the Ministry aud sighs,
And sighs, “ Oh, well a day 1
" ’Twas my lance helped the foe to rout,
1 My eloquence that put them out,
•Twas I that led the fig^t;
i Now I'm deserted, just wh n, 10,
I thought I’d a portfolk
How wrong to put in Wright 1”
John Davies, and not Mr. Campbell, was to have
had the Postmaster. Generalship when it was relin-
quished by the late Hon. S. C. Brown, John was, in
1 fact, promised the position. Bat the Ministry heard
something, and, ns a consequence, " Little Pillbcx
interviewed the Mayor. “Is it true that you will
■ opp-ee Mr. Davies sh-uld he accept office and clfor
burned tor re-oleotioa ?" “ True as gospel,” replied
the Mayor. Whereupon “ Little Pillbox ” made tracks,
and John Davies detidod that he'd better try and post-
pone being kicked iuto oblivion.
What art thou, Copeland, quickly tall,
A Catholic or infidel ?
A Baptist, come! Or is it this,
A follower ot Jefl'eris P
A Swcdanborgian—oh, bnt stay !
Do you with Bible Christians pray ?
A Presbyterian can you ha—
An advocate of buns and tea ?
Those holy souls who grease each day
Themselves ere they begin to pray ;
And when through praying they have got,
Just finish up with “ something hot."
Bahl take our tip—in no form revel—
J ust " tell the truth and shame the devil.”
The Licensing Act has worked so well during
the past quarter that the revenue returns show an in-
crease of £20,781 in the sale ot spirits as compared with
the same quarter of 1881, whilst licenses show an in-
crease ot £1032. And the Postal Department has been
so successfully managed that it yields a decrease of
£6751 for the same p r od. Something wrong about
that, Mr. Wright—now, isn’t there P
The quality of the man whom John Davies,
countenanced by Tom Slattery, instigated by Parkes,
and backed by the Calico Jimm ca, has had the insolence
to thrust before the electors of East Sydney as a cau-
didate, is shown by the style of his address on the
hustings. This is how ho spoke ot Mr. Reid, the
gentleman whom the East Sydney electors have twice
returned at the head of the poll. “ Mr. Beid had shown
himself a sympathiser with crime of every degree, and
as their representative would be the p itrou of thieves.
Mr. Keid was properly qualified to represent the
criminals of New South Wales ” The electors will know
howto avenge the insult thus offered to them.
The little Coal man who is opposing Mr. Cope-
land for Newtown is rather funny, out wo hepo that nis
coal is better than hia logic. Ho cw’t make out why Mr.
Copeland opposed Mr. Toaat-and-Water Foster 1 Oh 1
Ha seems to forgot that Mr. C. was not, like little Joe,
a hanger-on of Parkes’s until ho saw the game was np,
bnt opposed the dictator tooth and nail, and on me out
against W.J. purely for the purpose of putting out
one of a hostile Ministry; whereas little Joseph’s
"opinions" (let’s say views 11) on the Land question
ate identical with those of Mr. Copeland, Bah 1—
Stick to selling coal, Joe,
You make the worse of heotore;
Why strive (when you can sell yonr coal)
To sell the poor electors ?
The Rum thinks W. J. Foster “ weak-kneed.”
Can weak knees be born of weak teas? Our little
friend from Melbourne also says that W.J. is to succeed
Ikey’s brother as a District Court Judge. And as Mr.
Josephson’s resigned, we may make a little joke with-
out fear of being sent up for life. At the conclusion of
a case one day, he said, "The Court will reserve its
decision until after luncheon.’’ Then, when one o’clock
came round, a note was sent by the bailiff, the contents
of which were: 11 Dear Ike,—Come round here and have
a chop with mo in my room.” We forget who sent it.
bat the envelope bore the following superscription:
“ I Josephson, Esq , Macqnarie-stieet.” At a qaartor
past two precisely the Court delivered judgment.
The diamond-bedizened Beaney did not get
licked in the Melbourne Province Legislative Council
election for want of advertising Ho brought out a
full-sized supplement to the Herald which was nothing
but Beaney. Leading articles, correspondence, spicy
"locals," wit, humour, and the “poet’s corner,” all
Were advertisements, and all were Beaney. A Cate-
chum on Beaney expounded the candidate's merits in
the convenient form of question and answer— e.g :
Who gave Bowling its grand start around Melbourne?
Dr. Beaney. '
Bowlers vote for Beaney.
Who sent his ticket Wk for the “ Cricketers’ dinner/'
answer, "declines to go ?" Ham !
Cricketers, vote for Beaney.
Who took a dozen and invited bis personal friends to
accompany him ? Dr. Beaney,
Vote for Bounty.
Why does the Doctor wear diamonds ? To encourage
trade and please the eje.
Vote for Dr. Beaney.
Why does Dr. Beaney give such costly banquets with
an unlimited supply of sparkling gold top ? Because
" life is short and time is fleeting," and social enjoy-
meat and good fellowship is promoted thereby.
Vote for the social Doctor.
In the " Poet’s Corner" ware sung the Doctor's sue-
cot sea in the healing art—
" The Doctor can cure, with a skill almost sure,
All the ailments that trouble our bodies ;
The same talent and skill, with an infinite will.
Must bo uselul in Parliament lobbies."
&j. &3.
The Doctor’s views on practical legislation wer» liberal
and original He was in t >voar of Protection, and a‘so
in favour of Free Trade. Ho wemd oheapeu the Yau
Vcau, retinue telogropa charges, abolish newspaper
postage, and pay elf the National debt. Bo went u
tor sight-hours’ labour and early closing, “ no payment
of members ot Council,” but “ payment of coroners'
juries.” Me would also " support opening cigar shops,
and fruit shops on Sundays.” Aud jot the ascetic
Ham, who returned hia tickets tor the cricketers’
dinner, andis opposed to the social enjoyment ot a
dance,” was elected over the Doctor's head.
OPPOSITION TO THE MINISTRY.
Dan (for himself and John Davies): M I am wid you; I’m not in eƒis. Hang the country !”

The .£lOO aside race, Tnobetfc y. Largan,
arranged for last Saturday, did not come off, the
Englishman's friends having on tbe previous night
failed to show up with the final deposit of £59.
At a special meeting of the N.S.W. Coursing
Club, it was decided that the Challenge Cup should be
a 33-dog instead of a 16-dog stake. The division of the
Cup will be—Winner. £100; runner-up, £149; third
and fourth, £69 each; 4 dogs, £29 each; and 8 dogs, £lO
each.
Layoook v. Guildford, iu light skiffs, on the
Parramatta last Saturday, resulted in an easy victory
for the latter, who, after being led for a mile, rowed
his opponent down The steamers were crowded with
people who imagined they were going to see the race
Triokett v. Lirgtu,
Rather severe comments have been made anent
the running of Little Wanzar in the Two-year-old
Sailing PUte on New Year’s D ty. Tho owner, Mr.
James Dirgin, states that ho gave instructions to
Gough, tho joote/, to get well awav with his horse and
then to take a steadier or pall aud oooae at the finish.
He did take a steadier.
The stakes won at the late Y.R.C- meeting were
paid over on Tuesday. The Hon. W. Pearson received
the largest cheque, his share being £1759 : Mr. T.
Haines. £815; Me. E. Do Mestre, £339; Mr. C. Wilson,
£325 .• Mr D. 8. Wallace, £215; Sir T, Elder, £209 ; and
Mr. S. Miller, £l4O. Thnso, with smaller amounts,
brought the total up to £3991.
The handicap race for 24 feet open boats, in
connection with the 8. A.B C., was sailed over the
usual course last Saturday afterno ?n, and resulted in
a win for tbs Dreamland by 2 min., the Adelphi
second, and the Vr.'tor third. Now that the Adelphi
has been beaten from scratch, some little interest
will be attached to these 24 feet open boat contests.
Mr. A. P. Smart is one of the pluokiest sports-
men on the N. 8. Wales turf. Hia latest sr>ec. is the
purchase of Archie, the winner of tho N jrmandy
Stakes, for 1359 guineas. It will be remembered that
Mr. Smart gave 2000 guineas for Warwick at Mr.
Town’s sale of yearlings. Archie is a magnificent colt
with splendid breeding. He is by Rapidity, out of
Eugenie.
The match between the Carlton and the New-
castle Clubs, played at Newcastle last Saturday and
Monday, resulted in a win for tho Carltons by six
wickets. Nunn, of the latter club, played exceptionally
well, his score being 63 in the first innings and 114 in
the second, besides bowling 7 wickets in the first and 6
wickets in the second innings. Hogue also batted well,
as did Wood, Smith, and Lawrence for the Newcastle
Club,
For ways that are dark, the Parramatta R.C.
are peculiar. They have had in training for some time
past a representative crew for the purpose of swooping
down at tho National Regatta and scooping in the
prize for the Club fours. At midnight, the resident*
on the banks of the river are startled out of their
slumbers by the splashing of the oars of this mysteri-
ous crew, who, under cover of night, imagine they
can avoid discovery.
The match for the trophy presented by the
N.B.W. Gun Club took placs last Saturday, 12 members
competing. Tbe winner turned np in Mr. W. C. Hill,
who proved himself an Australian Dr. Carver, killing
the whole of his ten birds in splendid stylo. Messrs.
G L. Lord and F. Gannon killed nine birds each, and
divided second prize. Daring the afternoon a sweep-
stake was shot off. when no fewer than neven out of ten
killed all their birds, and divided.
The first elevens of the Warwicks and Carltons
met on the Association Ground last Saturday afternoon.
The Warwicks won tho toss, and went in first, aggregat-
ing 128, the top scorer being Hiddilston 56, not ont.
M’Hals and A. Gregory also batted very well for 21 and
19 respectively. The Carltons only managed to pnt
69 together for the loss of 9 wickets. Nunn scored 19,
and after him Callaolior 18, and Briscoe 15. The bowling
of Downes for the Warwicks was exceptionally good,
which accounts for the low score of their opponents.
Following is a list of the future engagements of
tho lion. Ivo BMgb’s team January 12 and 13, Hobart

Just as Jem Mace was leaving Auckland he
changed a lot of notes for sovereigns with a bank
teller, who shortly afterwards discovered that the notes
were £lO short cf the sovs. given. The teller rushed
out aud found Mace ripping cocktail in a pub. The
“ statuesque pugilist” pooh-poohed the teller's yarn.
The teller taed t,« bluff him with a detective. No go.
Then too pleaded in forma pauperis That fetched the
pugilist, who said : •• Well, young ’an, I'll give yer a
liver. And now yer can toss n-e * double or quits’ if yer
like.” But the teller didn’t like.
The Melbourne Argus is very jubilant regard-
ing the recent International match it saya : —"Such
a Uecioivo victory as that obtained by tho Australian
Eleven over a picked team of English amateur aud pro
fessional cricketers was not at all anticipated. . . .
Whilst congratulating our cricketers on their well-
deserved victory, we are only expressing tbe general
feeling when we regret the English players did not
make a better game of it It is not to be denied that
they have somewhat disappointed the expectations
which had been raised regarding their batting
strength."
Last Tuesday a pigeon match took place for
two guns, one by Powell and Co, and the other by
Adams and Co., when nixtean of our principal knights
of the trigger competed. The birds were in good condi-
tion, and the shooting excellent. Only three killed
their seven birds. In shooting off Mr. Uickeon missed
his ninth bird, which fell dead about a foot ont of
bounds, and Messrs. W. Hill aud F. Gannon agreed to
divide. Two sweepstakes were shot for afterwards.
The first was divided by Messrs. "Carver,” G. L.
Lord, and D dgratta, and the second was won by Mr.
“ Carver.’’ The latter is in a fair way of keeping up the
name he has assumed.
The Intercolonial eight oar race, which takes
place this year on the Parramatta, is fixed for 29th
April. Concerning this event, " Cloanthus," writing in
the Australasian, saw:—“lf Booth, Triokett, Hop-
kins, and Hughes can oe reoured to start with, there
need not be much difficulty in finding four others to
make a really first class crew. Senior, Graham, Anker-
son, Leverett. and Webster, if all be available, are well-
tried men. And if Mr. Q. Upward could be prevailed
upon to undertake the training and coaching of the
crew, I am sure that we shall have nothing to fear from
oar N.S.W. friends.” "Cloanthus" evidently learns
little from experience.
The bolting of the Polk totalisator promoters
from Melbourne with £2OOO of the public money tolls
its own story ?.nd points its own moral. With so many
similar examples, it is a wonder to ua that the public
still continue to place their trust in these mushrooms,
Here, tho proprietor of any tobacconist’s shop may ad-
vertise his £lOOO (or more) sweep, aud the baokors rash
with their cash to him in the most simple-minded con-
-Bdenoo._ The most foolish and short-sighted set of
people in the world are the backing set. They never
calculate the risk they make or the odds that are offered
them, but accept with a calm meekness what is given
by tho bookmakers. Trust only good men.
SPORTING GLEANINGS.
The N.S. Wales team of cricketers were enter-

The immense number of Christmas cards sent

Now, this is worth noting. We have the dis-
tinction of placing on record the first profession of
Nihilism in Sjdney, In flve-and-twenty years we
expect that Nihilists and Socialists will have become
quite as far advanced towards aeceptanoe as respect-
able as Radicals are to-day, and that Krapotkine will
be remembered with the same respect as to-day at-
taches to Cobden, and Sophia Perovsky’s memory
ranged in the same nieho with that of Charlotte Cor-
day. By the way, we wo:. dnY what was the name of
the spirited lady who killed Gambettn. But all this is
introductory. A respectable tradesman, who sends us
hia card, writes to take exception to the extract wo
published last week, having reference to the personal
appearance of that prominent Nihilist refugee and
Socialist leader. Prince Krapotkine. Oar Sydney
tradesman signs himself "A Nihilist," and there is no
manner of doubt that he is what he professes to be.
We don’t believe he is tho only adherent to Nihilist or
Socialist doctrines iu Sydney, by a long way. But he is
the first who has had the courage to frankly and de-
finitely announce himself. We gave a description
from a hostile source, as it happened, of Prince Krapot-
kine. Cocoa-nut-shaped head, fringe of long greasy
hair, snub nose, plebeian aspect, and so forth. Pro-
bably correct. Our Nihilist critic need not be
vexed. A man may have a pyramidal head, a
snub nose, and a plebeian aspect, and vet be a true hero.
Despite his unattractive external. Prince Krapotkine
may be a genuine and self-sacrificing reformer. He is a
fugitive from Rns .ian despotism, and under sentence of
death by that atrocious government. Prinoe Krapot-
kine has long ago renounced his title as repugnant to
his principles of equality, and he has, like Elysda
Reolua, the greatest geographer of the ago, who—as we
lately mentioned, gave hia daughter in marriage without
priest, lawyer, or registrar—equally, writes our oorres-
pondent, " declared war against all the sham moralities,
distorted laws, and hypocritical customs cf so-called
civilized society, of which the very roots are infected
and corrupted. Mr. Krapotkine," continues ‘A
Nihilist,’ •• is at tho headof a movement at present only
in its fir.t stage of development, whose task it is with
all means to annihilate this society. Partizans such as
ex-Prince Krapotkine of this revolutionary movement
abandon their high social position, and use their talents
to elevate and arouse the poor andjjoppressed,! with
whom they oast their lot, living in poverty and perpe-
tual persecution and misrepresentation, expecting no
other reward than imprisonment, torture, exile, execu-
tion, and even the jeers of the very people they are
striving to benefit."

Recent revelations have shown that the selling of sham
jewellery for real is enormously prevalent. A superb
bracelet, given by a Continental sovereign to a British
ambassador’s wife, was found, in London, to be merely
a sham, though there is no doubt it was presented by
the donor as genuine, and bought by him as such. In
another case, a gentleman took a bracelet which had
been given to his wife by an uncle to whom money was
nothing. The jeweller intimated it was false. The
donor was communicated with, and he took it to the
firm from whom he had bought it for five hundred
guineas, and indignantly demanded an explaontion.
They admitted the jewel was a sham, but insisted they
had been deceived by their own workmen; and the
principal immediately wrote the purchaser out a
cheque for the full amount. This is a hint for people who
have bought jewellery at certain places in Sydney

SOCIAL.
♦
Last Friday night, a private plain and
dress ball was given Dy Mr. Alexander Geddes at Corry’s
Gardens, Botany. A special tram conveyed metropolitan
visitors out, and, by the time local guests arrived, about
eighty were present. Pity, It rained. Yet this was only
an apparent misfortune. As it was, the rain outside
kept all the party in, and tho floor was full and the
scene lively all the time. Arrangements had been
effected for the grounds to be illuminated with the coy
dim lanterns made by childlike Chinese ; but tho rain
came down on those pretty lanterns, and—like Stuart
did the Government—put them out. In the pavilion
they were all right, of course, and from a little distance
looked very picturesque. Capital refreshment tables
were available all the evening, and completed the comfort.
A band of six from town. In white uniforms, provided
music. And, now, as to who were there. Most of the
gentlemen were in evening dress —a few in fancy, such
as a Middy, Student, Officer, Ac.; and tho ladies, as
they always do, pleased themselves—and others. Mr.
Alex. Geddes, of Fern Villa, wore the undress uniform
of a Gordon Highlander, and Mrs. Geddes au evening
dress of blue satin and cream, with tinselled grenadine
and white laoe trimmings, and blue wreath of frosted
convolvulus. The tall form of Mr. John Martin, of
Martinville, was disguised as a Squatter ; and two fair
daughters of the new Minister for Lands were in cream
cashmere, figured silk and laoe trimmings, and holly.
A Botany young gentleman wore a claret-coloured
swallow-tail, which was a mystery to everyone, and—
a beautiful fit. From Redmyre came throe popular
sisters: one in a very nice dress of maroon velvet bodice
and cream satin skirt, elaborately puffed, and embel-
lished with laoe and flowers—her sisters respectively in
blue satin with pink, and white satin with blue trim-
ming. Mr. Parker was a Cricketer, and Miss Parker a
delicious Polly is bine and cardinal—such a one as would I
be a “ Folly to remember, but wiser to forget.” Messrs.
Moyse and Hamilton wore the neat grey uniform of the
Suburban Bioyole Club; Miss Holroyd, a fancy dross,
Bed-White-and-Blue, and Miss Beaumont a handsome
bine satin with tinselled trimming, pink roses, and blue
wreath and shoes. From Rosebank, Glebe, came two
Misses Geddes, in envam puffed cashmere—one with
heliotrope and one pink trimming; and an elder sister in
an admirable make-up of “ domin' thro’ the Rye”—soar-
lot skirt, white muslin polonaise garlanded with poppies,
rye-stalks, and field flowers, and a straw hat dressed
with flowers and ribbons. Mrs. Corbett was welljdressed
as a Daughter of the Regiment; and Mias M'Leod as a
Fishwife, in blue Galatea stripe, with dark blue skirt
band and sailor collar, very neat Miss Fanny M’Lood
appeared in the pretty and original character of Mir-
anda, in Shakespeare’s " Tempest;’’ the dress was
white uun’s-veiling, plain tight-fitting body, out halt
low at the neck, with short pointed sleeves falling
loose behind and caught at the shoulders with gold or-
naments ; short skirt with puffed draping at back from
the waist to top of gathered flounce, and paniera
gathered oloselv at the waist and falling half-way down
the skirt; the fl ounce, neck, and papier* edged with
golden satin, and Swiss belt of same; golden coronet
and bracelets, dangling strings of gold beads, necklet,
golden fan, and white satin shoes. A Batavian young
lady was a picturesque German Peasant; and a Balmain
young lady was a Gipsy Queen, and the best danoer on
the floor. A Spanish Lady in black net and ofeam
eatin, pink roses and black laoe, was stylish. Of course,
there was a belle;
Bat really we’re not prepared to say
Whether the title of honour should go
> * To the maiden who lives near the Convict Bay,'*
Or the damsel who came from Ultimo;
Whether to Folly so sweet and gay.
Or Shakespeare’s heroine —we don’t know.
But sure wo are as we live to day—
And we must be fair, or nothing, yon know—
That either maid, were the other away, 0
Would be lovely as lover could wish to show ;
IF wo had a choice, themshould both of them stay.
And sooner dm than let either go.
That’s vague ; but it’s safe, and it’s all we’ll say,
And it’s true, and it’s fair; and we’ll leave it so.
In spite of ihe rain, the time passed so pleasantly that
it was nearly 4 before all were ready to go, and then,
three cheers having been given for Mr. and Mrs.
Gedde*, a special tram whisked the company away,
dropping wme on the road, and landing the rest in
broad daylight at the various plaoss in town.
Mr. and Mrs. C. J. Burney, of Surry Hills, gave s
a picnio on Saturday afternoon last, to nearly 100 t
friends, most of whom were in the happy heyday of •
youth. They went in tho Britannia to Longueville,
' and across to Tambourine Bay, where the customary
proceedings took place, and dancing to stringed music,
also refreshments, were attended to. Among the ladies, ,
mostly in sateens, were two Misses Burney, in neat j
black costumes, two pretty girls from Oxford-street, in
black, and two young ladies from Darlinghurst in white ]
linen, embroidered, and heliotrope trimmings. Very ]
lively was a Stanley-street maiden (of a big ohapel i
choir) in mouse plush, and snnflowoss over her rosthetio |
face; and a young lady from the ancient suburb of ]
Woolloomooloo, in peacock blue, was fair to look upon, ,
her countenance being neatly framed with pink roses, j
wild friz, and doru laoe. After tho company had had 1
six or seven meals, a Government slave proposed three

The wedding of Misa Kate Child with Mr.
Henry Croaker, of Wpodville, caused—like spoons often
do —a good deal of stir. It was at Morpeth, on the 2nd
instant. Tho bride looked well in white cashmere and
moird, real laoe veil fan heirloom), &o. Four fair girls,
sisters of the bride (one) and bridegroom, were capti-
vating in cream sateen and laoe, and large cream hats.
Tho venerable Archdeacon Child gave his daughter
away, and the knot was tied by the Bishop of New-
castle, assisted by Canon Tyrrell and Rev. Mills. The
choir rendered some music, in which the bridegroom '
joined heartily. After the ceremony, breakfast was
provided at tho Parsonage; and if no fatted calf had
been killed, modern measures of an equivalent kind had
been taken, and the choir and school children were
j right festively entertained in honour of the event. Mr.
j and Mrs. Croaker left by the evening train.
At the Synagogue, on the 3rd instant, a largo (
and fashionable assemblage gathered to witness the i
marriage of Mr. Henry Harris, of Christchurch (N.Z ),
to Miss Esther, eldest daughter under tho roof of her i
father, Mr. Henry Cohen, of Llandelly Terrace, Mao-
leay-stroet. The bride looked charming in a beautiful
white silk broohd, trimmed with pearl lace, long train,
veil, and wreath of orange blossom and clematis She
was attended by eight as pretty bridesmaids as any
bridegroom would desire to do honour to h.sohoice:
Misses Fannie, Elsie, and Constance (sisters), and
Cohen (cousin) of the bride, Conway (2). Harris and
Levy; in short dresses; four of cream sa?tia brooh<s,
and four of pink silk brochti, all trimmed with Spanish
laoe, and the front of each crewelled with roses and
ferns, all the orewelling done by the nimble fingers of
of the bridesmaids themselyas. Wreaths of ferns and
pink flowers, black silk stockings, and black shoes
steel beaded, were worn by all, and baskets of flowers
completed the equipment. The ceremony was per-
formed by Rabbi A. A. Levi, and the choir, of which the
now Mrs. Harris was a member, interspersed it with
mnsio. The happy pair stood, as usual, under the
canopy, four groomsmen being on each side, and the
eight maids two ani two orf'raised steps beyond; and
at the conclusion of the service they came down, each
kissed the bride under the canopy, and then passed cn
to her escort, a lively and very pretty piece of music
being sung meanwhile from the gallery. All was then
over, and a move was made to the carriages. The bride’s
mother wore heliotrope brocaded satin, with prune
satin de lyon flounce, nonibon lace, white lace bonnet
Sffhd feathers, with heliotrope flowers.
mother wore shaded prunebrocaded satin, honiton lace,
and bonnet to match : Mrs. Lewiason, a fawn coloured
ficelle, showing a pretty figure off well; Mrs. B. Cohen,
a terra-cotta check satin: Mrs. K. Kurts, bronze satin
body with blue satin skirt, beautifully crewelled; Mrs.
H. Solomon, bronze satin body and train, with robed
front of cream satin, bearing handpainted flowers of
great beauty; Mrs. Montague Levy, a black satin
broobd trimmed withjioniton lace ; Mrs. A, Brodziak,
black satin broebj, with jet front, cream bonnet; and
Mr*. Rogalski, a black satin brochd. with pale blue
bonnet. The show of dresses was exceptionally flue,
and pretty faces seemed almost the rule. Breakfast
was held at Nitbsdale, and later on, after the knotted
ones had gone off on their honeymoon, the guests,
numbering some 150, were entertained by Mrs. Henry
Cohen at a ball. The bridesmaids, all " nods and becks
and wreathed smiles,” were conspicuous among the
gaeats, and a demoiselle from Goldah House, in white
and cardinal was graceful and sparkling. Not till dawn
drew near did the dancers depart from tho merry
scene.

* Alfred W. Castle, solicitor, was up at the
j Central on Monday. He had got drunk, and had proved
j himself, by the style in which he mauled about several
j ladies who happened to pass him, to be the perfection
3 of intoxicated beastliness. Ho was fined 41s. Anyone
t but a drunken solicitor would have got six months.

t About New year a party of ycpne fellows from
i the Railway Department went up to Old Junes, and
. gave a concert in aid of the local charities. The only
1 local charity in Junee is the Public School organ, which
, is consumptive. The wool store was brilliantly lighted
i for the occasion by six tallow candles, and an early
English kerosene lamp that went out whenever anyone
1 applauded. Notwithstanding, the concert was the
f most successful ever h»ld in Junee It was tfce first,
i Mr E B. Taylor gave “ He like a soier fell,” and his
. high C raised a storm. There will be a worse storm if
i they ever see him up there again. Mr, Percy Roberts
3 sing “ Over the Garden Wall i” but nobody had heard
. it in Junee before, and they quite liked it. Mr. Duff’s
t performance convinced the audience that he had been
1 only haif named. Society is high-toned Junee way;
, the young lady who dishes up the pudding won’t pass
7 you the sugar basin unless you’ve been introduced—
a quite Junee sais quoit young girls, in fact. Junee is a
3 nice place to spend a holiday—only there’s no place to
3 stay at, nothing to see, and hardly anything to eat.
