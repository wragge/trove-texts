MELBOURNE’S CLUBS are known to

CHANGED BRAND
— > •
THE GOLD-COLORED Datsun 2000
belonging to Mrs. John Gorton was
photographed and written about during
the controversy on entry of Japanese
cars into Australia, but, apparently,
nothing happened to make Mrs. Gorton
feel she would prefer another brand.
However, Robert Macklin, Press secre-
tary to the Minister of Trade, Mr.
McEwen, sold his Honda sportscar a
month or two ago.
REACHING NEW HEIGHTS
FOR MONTHS now the citizens of
Melbourne have been waiting for news
of the next stage of their Arts Centre:
the proposed lofty golden spire, the
restaurant, and the five theatres. A
“Herald” reporter then gave the news
—things were being held up because
the first estimate for the second stage
was $27 million.
However, our man Batman was ex-
cited. He started to add up $14 mil-
lion for the first stage, $27 million
for the second stage, total $41 million
altogether. Perhaps the Arts Centre
could outcost the Sydney Opera Plouse?
But no, he is still a long way behind,
$14 million at least. But he does make
this suggestion: Victorians by un-
selfishly buying lottery tickets have done
much to build the Opera House. Vic-
torians are always in the prize lists
and a Victorian won first prize a fort-
night ago. Therefore, Victoria should
now start a $200,000 Arts Centre lot-
tery to pay the $27 million. Then, at
last, we would have beautiful co-
operation between the States, each buy-
ing tickets in the other lottery for
culture.
MISSING THE BOOK BOAT
BRITISH PUBLISHERS, who export
70 percent of their product, have missed
the boat in the field of elementary
science textbooks, members of a British
book trade mission admitted. 1 he mis-
sion has begun a 16-day Australian
tour.
The leader of the mission, Richard
David, of Cambridge University Press,
said that Americans give a broader and
less academic introduction to science;
this suits Australian needs.
Prime aim of the mission, which
■ will cover ground between Perth and
Townsville, is to seek out parallels be-
tween British and Australian needs.
David admitted that even if British
publishers can establish an Australian
market in elementary science textbooks
it would be two to three years before
American competition was met. David’s
story is the same as that of so many
British exporters. “We have become so
used to exporting in the book trade that
we have tended to take our markets for
granted," he said.
LIGHTER SIDE OF THE V. AND A.
NORMAN BROMMELLE’S is a rich
mellow voice, redolent of fine wines,
good cigars — in fact, embodying the
civilised air one might expect of the
Keeper of the Department of Conser-
vation at Victoria and Albert Museum.
In London, he is in charge of a
staff of 30, all engaged in the pains-
taking business of restoring and pre-
serving artistic reminders of earlier
times. He is in Sydney to give a series
of lectures, and will visit Australian
galleries and museums.
Life at the V. and A. may be lived
on a fairly esoteric plane, but as Mr.
Brommelle’s fruity tones conjured it
up this week, when he met the Press
at the British Council’s office, it does
have its lighter side.
“One of our costume experts, Stella
Scott, can date a painting with in-
credible accuracy by the costumes on
the figures in it.
“She's discovered that Titian has
depicted all the magd.alens in his pic-
tures dressed in the height of fashion,
while the clothes of all the virgins
are five years behind the times. She’s
not fooled by pictures of nudes either,
because she’s found that artists paint
nudes according to the style of the
period. For' example, all the nudes
painted around Jane Austen’s time had
higher waists because cf the dresses
in vogue then.”
Fashion, according to Mr. Brommelle,
also works against the art forger, who
subconsciously invests the forgery with
contemporary characteristics.
“Some of the most famous forgeries
of this century were done by the
Dutchman who faked Vermeers. Ver-
Norman Brommelle ... fashion and
the forger
meer was thought to have done some
religious paintings, but no one had
ever found them, so this fellow went
ahead and did them. One was authen-
ticated by an art historian of the time.
It was at the beginning of the war.
“But if you look at them now, you’ll
see that some of the women in them
look vaguely like Greta Garbo.”
His wife, who is a microscopist at
the National Gallery, is called upon
frequently by Scotland Yard to identify
forgeries. “She had taken a piece of
paint for analysis from the Goya which
was stolen recently. She was the only
person to have a sample of it, so she
worked with the police a good deal.
“At one point, the thieves posted
the police a package containing burnt
fragments which they said were pieces
of the painting. They said they’d
realised they couldn’t get the money
for it and had burnt it. My wife spent
several weeks analysing those frag-
ments and finally came to the conclu-
sion that they were pieces of old lino.”
Forgers, he added, are having a more
difficult time these days against such
formidable scientific weapons as X-ray
fluorescence and carbon dating, but

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
forgeries are still being attempted be-
cause purchasers of objets d’art don’t
always consult scientists for proof of
authenticity. “I think subconsciously
they don’t want to be told they have
a fake, so they don’t come near us.
“Sometimes, though, it’s not possible
to catch a fake out technically. You
know by intuition that it’s not right be-
cause you’ve worked on so many
paintings. The art historians are usually
the first people to spot a forgery, then
they turn it over to the scientists.”
Mr. Brommelle read physics at Ox-
ford, although he was more interested
in the arts, and went to art school at
night. During the war, he was “trapped
in the aluminium industry and got fed
up, so I went along to the National
Gallery and said, ‘Will you take me
on?’.”
They did, but with a guarantee of
only a year’s work. Nevertheless, this
was enough to make Brommelle “throw
up the pension job at the aluminium
works” and take a chance. “I started
from scratch — sweeping floors, cleaning
palettes, but fortunately, an American
scientist had just come over to teach
new methods and I worked with him
for a whole year, becoming a full
picture restorer.”
At the Victoria and Albert, Mr.
Brommelle is in charge of a team of
specialists — “there are the furniture
people, restoring French marquetry and
so on, those who work on paintings,
prints, watercolors, and posters, the
ceramics department — we have a fine
collection of Meissen — and the sculp-
ture section. The V. and A. has the best
collection of Italian Renaissance sculp-
ture outside Italy.”
CAT OUT OF THE BAG
LOCAL MEMBER for the A.C.T. Mr.
Jim Fraser, MHR, is not one of the
Parliament's most active performers.
The epitome of the parish-pump poli-
tician, he spends most of his energies
working on behalf of constituents who
come to him for help. The story is told
(by Fraser often) of the constituent
who had a stray cat run down by a
car outside his house. Unable to get
the Department of the Interior or any
of Canberra’s other public agencies to
come and take it away, after two days
he enlisted the help of his local mem-
ber. Mr. Fraser threw his parliamen-
tary weight behind the campaign for
a decent burial for the cat, ringing
departmental heads and chatting them
up to ungum the bureaucratic works.
Cheery promises that they would be
“right on to it” came to naught, so Mr.
Fraser saw only one way to satisfy his
constituent’s needs. Taking a shovel
and a sack from his garden shed, he
. drove his cream Mercedes to where the
cat lay and found it a final resting place.
This is by the way. But Mr. Fraser
in Parliament is a great one for trying
to dig up examples of misuse of par-
liamentary privilege by politicians who
visit Canberra. 5ome months ago he
put on the parliamentary notice paper
a series of questions inquiring of the
Minister for the Interior the waiting
time for government houses in Can-
berra and also asking how many Minis-
ters and ordinary members had govern-
ment houses or flats.
Last week he finally got his answers.
The waiting time for ordinary Canberra
citizens wanting accommodation ranges
between 26 and 55 months, depending
on the type. Four Ministers occupy
government houses when in Canberra
— Hasluck, Freeth, Bury, and Nixon.
This would have made excellent
propaganda among the voters who are
on those long waiting lists. Except for
one thing: there was one parliamen-
tarian inconveniently named, none
other than Mr. Fraser’s leader, Mr. G.
Whitlam, also occupying one of those
scarce houses.
NEW FRONTIER
BUSINESS JETS, a firm which runs
charter flights by fan jet Falcon, have
a seven-day, 8000-mile trip to parts
of the north-west, which they call the
New Frontier Tour. Australia never had
an old frontier, for various* reasons,
mainly desert, but there is perhaps no
reason why it should not have a new
frontier.
However, we found the new frontier,
as described by the travel adviser for
Business Jets, Miss Anne Gleeson, some-
what baffling. “Coming into the new
frontier itself you don’t find Red
Indians or wild men of any sort, or
even log cabins, but you do land in a
new man-made town that just seems to
have squatted there in an orderly,
planned fashion,” she is quoted as
saying.
“Port Hedland,” she adds, “is like a
modern scientific version of old-time,
mining-rush towns, seething with activ-
ity, a place where men are men and the
only thing missing is the TV saga of
gunfights, sheriffs, goodies and baddies.”
We hope that the pilot has got a clearer
idea of the country he is flying over
than Miss Gleeson seems to have.
KING CELEBRATED
EASTER traditionally means the
victory of life over death. Melbourne’s
least traditional church, St. Matthias’,
North Richmond, celebrated the Resur-
rection by holding a memorial service
for Martin Luther King.
St. Matthias’, Anglican part of the
Collingwood-North Richmond com-
bined parish, was accepted as a com-
bined Anglican-Presbyterian-Methodist
parish three years ago after a battle
with the Anglican hierarchy. Its vicar,
the Reverend David Pope, had corres-
ponded with King since 1964 and had
invited him to come to Australia to talk
on race relations and the Vietnam war.
King was shot before he replied to a
letter asking him to come this year or
early next. Meanwhile King had sent a
tape recording of a speech and more

This girl is able to handle 25 external lines and hundreds of internal extensions, with smooth
efficiency . . . and still look after the petty cash.
The first thing you notice, when you
install the STC Pentaconta Pushbutton
PABX, is the staff saving. One girl can
supervise a large board, like this 200-line
extendible unit, with ease. You'll also
notice the gain in communications effi-
ciency.
Your customers will notice it too. They
will discover that calls into your business
are always answered promptly, never
cut off. You will find inter-departmental
and outside calls all go through faster.
Fact is, you now have working for you the
most advanced business telephone system
there is: STC Pentaconta.
The STC Pentaco-nta does more for you
than any other system. For example, any-
one in your organisation receiving a call
will be able to transfer the caller direct to
any other extension, simply by pressing a
button, .without recalling the operator.
Anyone, on any extension, can hold an
outside exchange call while making a
second call, inside or outside. You can
even dial from any extension direct to
your mobile radio vehicles. These features,
speed and reliability, make the STC
Pentaconta much more than a telephone
system: it's an investment in overall
business efficiency. And more and more
companies, large and not-so-large, are
finding how well it pays off.

letters. Comments by King on Vietnam
began and ended the order of service.
The tape-recording followed excerpts
from King's "Letter from Birmingham
Jail,” which Pope read on national
TV after the assassination.
After prayers (rewritten by the three
clergymen of the parish: . . . ‘"For a just
and equitable distribution of the earth's
resources . . . for the peace of the
world, on behalf of the aspirations of
the Vietnamese people . . . we com-
mit ourselves through Jesus Christ”),
there were a fourth folksong from soul-
stirrer Margaret Roadnight, a hymn,
the dismissal (Go forth in your struggle
against poverty and oppression . . .),
a collection for Dennis O’Donnell’s
appeal to the Privy Council, a re-
minder about “Richmond Citizens
Against the War,” and three verses of
“We Shall Overcome.” Dr. Jim Cairns,
the local member, delivered the oration.
After the service, the bearded, six-
foot-four, thirty-one-year-old, agnostic,
organ-playing vicar agreed with us that
his philosophy was similar to King’s.
He said he believed in a Christianity
shorn of metaphysics. “When Jesus is
cast as a semi-divine figure the
miracles and all that—He is no longer
very helpful.”
Pope’s secular approach parallels his
secular parish. It is an area marked out
for urgent slum clearance. It has had a
tough past which has not been forgot-
ten. Pope combines parish activities
with a vigorous political life. He is an
active ALP member and the co-ordin-
ator of Victorian Vietnam protest.
When the issue of the Bomb is alive he
is the man behind that. He is, to use
Pope’s words about King, “a man who
got involved.”

BUY A BADGE
FOR BOLTE
YOU MAY HAVE noticed that Sir
Henry Bolte lost his Western Province
by-election. The winner was Mr. Clive
Mitchell of the Country Party. You
appreciate what this means. He lost
control of the Upper House. He can be
thrashed by a coalition of the Country
Party and Labor any time they choose.
Of course, Labor always wants to thrash
him, so the choice is up to the Country
Party. Therefore, in a country of elec-
toral curiosities we now have a curio
almost as strange as that of South Aus-
tralia. The Party which has less than
one-fifth of the seats can push us around
from that red plush anachronism in
Spring Street, the Legislative Council.
Sir Henry blamed his defeat on two
factors. First, the drought. And this was
unfortunate. Even despite some very
strong speec hes in the House, the good
Lord failed to deliver the water. Then
he blamed the Federal Treasurer. "Be-
cause of the raw deal we get from Can-
berra we have been forced to bring in
a tax to which people object."
It is quite right. Sir Henry has been
short of money and he was at his wit’s
end to find a new way of taxing people.
Then he hit upon this receipt tax. It
works this way—one cent is deducted
from every $lO you receive. It is not
much, but it is another income-tax, and
if you are in the habit of receiving
every week a nice cheque, say, S4O, it
is irritating to discover that now,
because of Sir Henry, it is only $39.96.
Oh, it is only a last resort. He has put
up the tax on probate, he has made us
pay five cents for our cheques, he has
put the bite on the Gas and Fuel Cor-
poration and the State Electricity Com-
mission, and he has every racehorse
working like a dog for him.
But wait, has he tried everything?
The other day I was reading through
some 1908 copies of The Bulletin and
our beloved journal was up in arms
about the wowsers, how they always
escaped the tax man. Always it was the
poor, decent, smoking, drinking, betting
chap that copped the lot. So The
Bulletin set out to devise a plan to sort
of round off things.
Of course, The Bulletin was abso-
lutely right. The Government incredibly
failed to take note of the idea and
countless millions of dollars, enough to
buy squadrons of Fills slipped away
because of it. Let us pick on a year,
say, 1965-66. In that financial year
drinkers helped the Federal Government
with $35,786,000 for spirits and
$302,652,000 for beer. The tax on
cigarettes and tobacco was $244,477,000.
Then Tattersall’s, that lottery which
was pushed out of Queensland and New-
South Wales because they thought the
idea so wicked, turned in $6,294,000.
Racing in Victoria made for Sir Henry
$12,190,000. And motor-cars? Could
w r e include those under the general
heading of sins? Why not, they’re more
dangerous than anything. Petrol tax
was $148,149,000. Driving licences in
Victoria were worth $1,797,000, and
Victorian motor registration brought
$24,244,000. Then the Commonwealth
tax on car sales was $151,831,000.
Have you sported the terrible inequity
of the thing? The fellow who smokes,
drinks, buys lottery tickets and drives
a motor-car is helping his Government
handsomely as a loyal good citizen. I
mean, every time a fellow at the pub
downs a pint he knows that more than
half of the monev is really going to
the Federal Treasury. Undoubtedly this
is the reason why some chaps drink so
much. They know that by sinking their
pints they are unselfishly helping some
pensioner or, perhaps, their cobbers in
Vietnam. And again as he smokes his
cigarettes, even though he realises this
is a drug that could kill him. he keeps
on smoking because he can help pay
for a dam on the Ord River, or some-
thing.
Now. there are a great many people

in the community with very sincere
convictions. They feel it is wrong to
gamble, therefore they refuse to bet on
the TAB, scorn all bookmakers, and
will have nothing to do with lottery-
tickets. There are others who, for simi-
lar reasons, will not drink or smoke. I
don’t know whether there is a religion
that is against the motor-car, but there
should be.
But can you understand the terrible
dilemma of these people? They do not
want to be left out. They, too, want
to pay their share, to help their cob-
bers in Vietnam, to build that dam
on the Ord. They realise that if only
they could splurge a little on the TAB,
then their money would find its way
to Victorian hospitals, and because of
their deep-felt convictions they are left
out.
Imagine the frustration, the awful
guilt complexes that are being created.
The clean-living chap can drink as
many raspberry vinegars and pineapple
juices as he likes, but he is still not
helping the boys in Vietnam.
The reason things have come to
such an extraordinary pass, is'this:
horses, liquor, and smokes are quite
popular and therefore so beautifully
easy to tax. Now, 60 years ago The
Bulletin saw all this and devised a
scheme whereby non-smokers etc.
could be taxed. They would register
in the same way that you would now
get a TV or radio licence and there
would be a badge to cover each cate-
gory or a gold badge to cover all of
them. It is a little complex in that
it comes into State and Federal fields
of taxation, but it is one that could
be collected most easily by the Federal
Treasury.
For more than a year now I have
been worrying and working over this
gift to the country and at one stage
I even drew up a Bill: an Act relating
to the imposition and collection of
tax upon non-drinkers, non-smokers,
non-gamblers, and non - motor - car
drivers. This was to be called the
Abstainers’ Act. It’s provisions briefly
were this. For the purpose of the Act,
abstainers were all wage-earners over
18 who did not partake of tobacco, etc.
Non-drinkers would be required to
buy a green badge, annual cost $10;
non-smokers a brown badge, $10; non-
gamblers a red badge, sls; and non-
car drivers or users a yellow badge,
S2O. Then a gold badge to cover all
these categories could be bought at
an annual cost of S4O. Penalties for
failure to purchase badges, SSO for
first offence, SIOO for second, and six
months imprisonment for all offences
thereafter.
The idea is not far-fetched. Ad-
mittedly, it does depend a great deal
on trust, but we are dealing with trust-
worthy people. Thousands upon
thousands will want to bear their red
badge of courage, or even better the
gold honor badge. It will save us all.

IT IS 10.30 a.m. and Randwick’s
bungalow territory is jammed with
status cars packed chrome-to-chrome,
excepting for two Mercedes w'hose
chauffeurs guard ten-foot gaps wdth the
kind of proprietorship that comes after
years of driving quality employers.
Today they are at the Sydney thorough-
bred yearling sales at the Newmarket
stables in Barker Street. Sixty cents to
get in. Fifty cents for a fat, easy-to-hold
catalogue bound in shiny baby-blue. To
the left, pies and liquor on sale for
the masses; that is, those who don’t buy
but are there for the thrill. To the right,
breeders Reg Moses and Frank Thomp-
son’s private lunch party, by invitation
only.
The atmosphere is genuim Marl-
borough country. Where men are men.

In hacking jackets and doeskin pants.
And the women are correct in mid-
season linen with matching pull-on hats
and gig-lamp sunglasses. Actually, says
auctioneer John Inglis, they don’t have
trouble wfth the women, you know,
over accidental bids. No one looks at
them. They are just there. But he has
known men to make the right gesture
at the wrong time. Well, a wink, for
example. Or the raising of a finger.
Mr. Inglis, in pink shirt and pork-pie
hat, is up in his box playing it cool. He
needs to. Hot competition is expected
today from buyers like Sydney million-
aire Stan Fox, the Foyster brothers, who
paid last year’s record colt price of
■539,000, South Australian trainer Bart
Cummings, and the Asian syndicate,
with Mr. Filipe Ysmael, as one 'news-
paper puts it sinisterly, as their acknow-
ledged leader. Actually, Melbourne

Mr. Ysmael sits there nursing his
transistor.

Randwick hang out their washing and
hear it all on the loudspeaker system, it
must comfort them to know someone’s
got all that cash to spend on a horse,
while all this goes on an elderly gentle-
man potters in and out of the ring
sweeping up manure. He is oblivious to
everything. Bucking yeJrlings. High
finance. Tense bidding. He sweeps like
a man possessed until John Inglis, who
says concentration is everything in
auctioneering, lose that and you’re done
for, leans nearer the microphone and
yells, “Tell that fella to get off.” He
continues till lunchtime, cajoling blood
from stone, giving them guilt com-
plexes . . . Mr. “X” is very disap-
pointed not to get 10,000 for his horse,
but, sigh, he will sell for 2000 . . .
and “. . . come, now, gentlemen, you
cannot pass up this opportunity . . .”
They can. Reserve price is $3OOO. Take
her out. Then: “The owner accepts
2600, but he’s disappointed” . . . “Go
for your life, gentlemen, you won’t find
a better colt anywhere, tell him to put
in the money, Barney, and he won’t be
sorry” . . . “Now here he is, the star
colt: I want 8000, right, you’ll bid 2000
. . . come on, gentlemen, make it even,
another 100. Thank you, Mr. Raymond.
Lovely to see you here, Mr. Raymond.
Thank you very much . . .”
Here is Harry. Now horsebreaker
Harry Myers has led Mr. Inglis’ horses
for 20 years, and at saletime is what
newspapers call a spotter and what
Mr. Inglis calls a helper. Harry has a
way with horses that is distinctive.
Today, in lovat pants and brown check
shirt and with a Cary Grant smile, one
filly comes to near kissing him, and
everyone says aaaaaaaaa-h. Harry turns
up the candle wattage a fraction . . .
Meanwhile, over on the lawn outside
the stables, early guests for the Moses-
Thompson lunch arrive. Mrs. Thompson
says this is not intended to be anything
big, but it does make a break for every-
one to get away from that ring. Ah,
here they come. There’s Mr. Filipe
Ysmael, the acknowledged leader, with
his transistor going full blast. He leaves
it on a chair, belting out pop music
which is not appreciated by everyone,
nips into the tent for his salad and
drink, then props it up for the racing
results. Mr. Lloyd Foyster is gasping
for a cup of tea and settles for black
coffee. He cannot say he’s a fixed idea
how many horses he’ll buy, but six or
12 are nice round numbers. He is always
glad to return to the country, where
everything is so clean. Lord Beresford,

Ross Campbell
THE STAFF MAN
WHO CAME IN
FROM THE COLD
THE TELEPHONE rang on the desk
of Herbert Bungley, assistant sub-
manager of the accidents department
of the Reliable Insurance Company.
“Bungley speaking,” he said.
A voice said: “Hello, Herb. Did you
know they’re sending you to the
Darwin branch?” It was Ronald Ear-
well, of the firm’s life office.
“Are you sure, Ron?” said Bungley,
his face pale. “I haven’t heard about
it myself yet.”
“It’s quite definite,” replied Earwell.
“They want you to go there by the
Ist of July.”
"Thanks, Ron. I’m glad you let me
know.”
The transfer would involve diffi-
culties. But at least he had advance
notice, thanks to the Ron Earwell in-
telligence service. Bungley wondered
vaguely, as he often had before, how
he got his information.
Ron Earwell was one of the devoted
band of office finders-out. There is at
least one of them in every big business.
He or she always seems to know what
is going on before anyone else does.
Ron’s biggest coup was his discovery
of the firm’s impending takeover of
Eezee Car Credits. He scored another
important beat with the news that Mr.
Totley, the chief accountant, was on
terms of intimacy with Miss Romping,
a typist in the marine division.
It is strange that writers of suspense
fiction have neglected the work of the
office intelligence gatherers. Cold-war
spies and counter-spies have had more
than their share of attention, and the
Bond stores are overstocked to the
point of glut. Yet the little-known lives
of operators like Ron Earwell hold
ample interest for fictional purposes.
These experts may not carry a licence
to kill, but their activities are replete
with furtive meetings, confidential files,
and undercover excitement.
Take the story of how Ron learned
about the dismissal of Des Wordspeed,
the Reliable’s star fire-insurance sales-
man. There had been rumors that Des
was on the skids, and several others
were hoping to step into his shoes.
Late one afternoon Ron had a telephone
call from Gerry Mumbell, of the
securities division.
Gerry said in a low voice: “Can I
see you in the Wellington at five-
thirty?”
‘‘OK,” said Ron. “Something im-
portant?”
“I think you’ll be interested,” said
Gerry. He was glad to do Ron a favor,
because Ron had given him a useful
advance warning of some changes in
the annual holiday schedule.
When they met in the saloon bar of
the Wellington, Ron ordered drinks.
Gerry said quietly: “It’s about the
Rooster.” (That was their code name
for Des Wordspeed; it alluded to his
private life.) “You know Trixie Nat-
ter, the Admiral’s secretary?” (The
Admiral was Mr. Snapley, 'manager of
the fire division and a keen yachts-
man.) “She’s a good friend of mine.
She told me about a big blow-up when
the Rooster was in the Admiral’s office
today.”
Out of the corner of his eye Ron saw
Harry McDimm, of the fire division,
coming over to join them. He said
quickly: “As I was saying, the trouble
with Norths is their weak defence.
They’ll never get into the finals until
they stop tackling fresh air.”
They talked football until McDimm
had finished his drink and gone.
Then Gerry said: “The Admiral
came down on the Rooster for claiming
expenses for a party he gave for two
switch-girls in Newcastle. The Rooster
said they were good contacts, and the
Admiral said he supposed there was
some good contact at the party. Then
the Rooster got abusive and the
Admiral told him he could start looking
for employment elsewhere. Don’t let
anyone know I got this from Trixie.”
“You can trust me,” said Ron. “I’ll
be back in a minute.”
He went to the red telephone and
rang Ted Dingwattle. “Ron here. The
Rooster’s had it,” he said, and hung
up. Dingwattle worked fast and was
appointed before long to Des Word-
speed’s position.
Though Dingwattle was grateful for
the tip, he found himself a little irri-
tated by Ron’s omniscience.
A few months later his wife had a
baby—their first son. As he returned to
the office from the hospital, he-thought:
“At least this is some news I’ll be able
to break to Ron Earwell.”
He ran into Ron in the corridor.
Before he could speak, Ron said: “Con-
gratulations, Ted! I was hoping it
would be a boy.”
“Did you know we were having a
baby?” asked Ted blankly.
“Yes,” he said. “I knew eight months
ago.”

Another way to fight
the Vietnam War
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
IT IS NOW becoming increasingly
clear that, although President Johnson’s
initiative for a Vietnam settlement
appeared to come out of the blue, it
was, in fact, the expression of a line in
Administration thinking that had been
quietly developing for some time. The
Administration had decided on a change
of policy on Vietnam. It was simply a
question of which policy to change, to.
In the critical year of 1965 the
assumption had been that either
America had to admit that its interven-
tion in Vietnam had failed or it had to
take over most of the fighting. Both the
South Vietnamese Government and the
South Vietnamese Army appeared to
be at the point of disintegration. The
decision was to take over most of the
fighting. This was done in a massive,
and typically American way, and in the
limited terms of military objectives it
was successful. It became clear that,
militarily, America could not be de-
feated. But, for various reasons, the
American Administration also became
convinced that America could not win.
There had been considerable restora-
tion of morale in the South Vietnamese
Army, and improvement in the Govern-
ment of South Vietnam, but the Ameri-
can Administration was increasingly de-
pressed about the apathy of the ordin-
ary South Vietnamese. No matter how-
successful the American military effort,
it was not enough to reinvigorate a
people whose senses had been blunted
bv guerilla terrorism and sheer con-
fusion. It was just as depressing to con-
template the corruption and inefficiency
of government, particularly in vital
areas such as the police. This was not
a matter of morality corruption is
still an important part of the method of
government in most countries. It was a
matter of efficiency. That reintegration
of South Vietnamese society around the
Saigon Government that would mark
the real "winning” of the struggle in
South \ ietnam did not seem to be
occurring quickly enough.
These and other considerations led to
increasing scepticism about the meaning
of a ' 'military victory" and the fear that
if a military victory left other things
as they were in Vietnam it would not
be a victory. This could mean that
if, after a “victory,” the Americans
withdrew their troops, the Viet Cong
could then achieve in “peace” a take-
over they had failed to achieve in war.
The alternative seemed to be to keep
great numbers of American troops in
South Vietnam for a generation or so—
not merely as a security garrison to
deter aggression (which would be all
right) but as a prop to the social and
political fabric of South Vietnam.
At the same time the American
Administration had no doubt that
there was in South Vietnam a wide
and genuine wish to avoid Communist
government. The difficulty was that this
wish was not sufficiently transformed
into successful South Vietnamese action.
The American Administration had even
less doubt that a sudden and humiliat-
ing American withdrawal might have
disastrous results in South-East Asia
and perhaps in other parts of the world.
But within the American Administra-
tion there were factors that appeared
to offset even this consideration, most
notably the inhibitions on American
flexibility elsewhere in the world and
the political turmoil at home.
The drain on resources in the Viet-
nam War was reduced by a policy of
deliberately depleting military inven-
tories elsewhere in the world, a policy
that was described laconically in the
magazine “Armed Forces Management
as “only a marginally effective flirtation
with disaster.” The object of this policy
was to avoid that great surplus of sup-
plies that has followed every other war,
but as one general put it: “This busi-
ness of trying to fight the war and
come out even is a poor way to run a
war effort. Either you come out with
excesses or come out dead.” As it turned
out the name of the marginal disaster
was Pueblo.
The alternative was to increase mili-
tary expenditure, but the domestic tur-
moil released by the Vietnam War
seemed to make this impossible. The
reasons for this turmoil are not relevant
here, but it is worth wondering briefly
if the war would have aroused quite
such passionate and stupid denunciations
in America (and elsewhere) if the
President of the United States had been
John F. Kennedy rather than Lyndon
B. Johnson. There would seem little
doubt that, in 1965, rather than walk
out, President Kennedy would have
increased American intervention in
South Vietnam; but there would also
seem little doubt that he would have
been better at selling his policies to the
world and to the American people.
It is now several months—dating at
least from the Pueblo incident—since
the conviction took over the American
Administration that there should be a
change in South Vietnam, either a
change in the way in which the war
was conducted or an attempt at settle-
ment. Or—as will be suggested later—
both.
Belief in a victorious settlement col-
lapsed. There was no chance of uncon-
ditional surrender. If a complete mili-
tary victory was to be discarded, it
was folly to imagine that a complete
diplomatic victory was possible. Perhaps
the best that could be done was to get
the best of a bad settlement.
The latest issue of "Foreign Affairs"
reveals that one of the most acute
analysts in the American Government
put it like this: “There are three things
worse than a bad settlement of Vietnam
right now. The first is an invasion of
the North and a confrontation with
China. The second is the same bad
settlement two or three years from now
with all the additional casualties —which
is about the best we can expect. And
the third alternative worse than a bad
settlement now is a good settlement,
delivering all the Administration’s
demands, four or five years from now.
For four or five years of that level of
risk, even if we avoid a war with the
Chinese, will wreck all our other objec-
tives around the world and tear our own
society here at home into shreds.”
At the time this statement was made
there were no prospects of even a bad
settlement. What was being considered
then was a shift in policy in Vietnam.
Now that there are prospects of a bad
settlement, this shift in policy has been
put on ice. But it is likely to be adopted
if settlement talks fail altogether (as
they might) or if there is a long period
of negotiation.
This policy can be described briefly
and bluntly as: The South Vietnamese
should do more for themselves. They
should be given the main responsibilities
in the war, with the Americans back-
ing them and giving them reserve
strength. If they succeed good. If
they fail, there would be at least the
consolation that it would have been their
failure, and not the Americans’, and that
general American credibility might not
be destroyed.
Behind this policy of “de-American-
isation" there are three central assump-
tions. One is that by seizing the initi-
ative and running the war the Ameri-
cans may have by accident further in-
creased the apathy and demoralisation
of the South Vietnamese. The second
is that the international dangers of
defeat in Vietnam may have been
greatly increased by the Americans put-
ting themselves, rather than the South
Vietnamese, on the line. The third is
that the policy of search and destrox,
the attempt to turn the war into a battle
between main forces, has failed. If
the Americans had a million men in
Vietnam rather than half a million they
might have been able to pursue both the
search and destroy policy and the policy
of rooting out the hidden administrative
apparatus of the Viet Cong in the vil-
lages and towns. But with so much con-
centration on attempted military battles
(in .which the Americans were at an
immense disadvantage because their
enemy was hard to find) the pacification
program did not succeed. The Viet
Cong infrastructure is still there.
The de-escalation of the military
struggle would mean that priority was
given to protecting most of the people
of South Vietnam rather than to costly
and usually unsuccessful military actions
against enemy main-force units and,
by this method, and by economic assis-
tance and policies of reform, gain their
friendship. If this worked it would

SINCE 1753
mean, gradually, that the Viet Cong
underground would collapse, isolating
the main-force units in their hideouts.
If the main-force units came out to
fight, the Americans would be at an
even greater advantage than they were
in the Tet offensive, because they would
have more deployable reserves.
But, for such a policy to be success-
ful, de-Americanisation would be
essential. The Americans are never go-
ing to get the full co-operation of the
ordinary people of South Vietnam. That
co-operation can be given only to a
South Vietnamese Government and its
representatives. The ordinary security
role in the towns. and villages would
have to become entirely a South Viet-
namese responsibility, with American
and other allied troops acting in reserve,
to be called on when needed.
Economic assistance and reform could
also be carried out successfully only by
the South Vietnamese. The Americans
could content themselves with' paying
the bill. This would irritate the Ameri-
cans. There would be muddles, per-
plexities, and corruption. But efficiency
is not finally a question of style but
of results. For the South Vietnamese to
be the sole agents of pacification pro-
grams is the only way in which pacifi-
cation can work. It might not work. But
nothing else will. It is worth giving the
South Vietnamese a go, and the effect
might be to release in mere of the non-
Comnninist Vietnamese some of those
energies that characterise the Com-
munists.
This might not be likely to happen
with the present kind of South Viet-
namese government. But for the Ameri-
cans to insist on a policy of de-
Americanisation might in itself force the
present Government to widen its appeal
and its effectiveness by incorporating
into itself those elements in South Viet-
nam that could give it greater credibility
and vigor. This might happen. It might
not happen. It might lead to a weaken-
ing of the Government. But what is the
alternative?
There are two great issues in Viet-
nam. One is the future of South Viet-
nam. One is the future role America is
to play in South-East Asia and in the
whole world. The future of South Viet-
nam must finally be settled by the South
Vietnamese. America and its allies can
assist them, but they cannot take the
final actions for them. What is also im-
portant is that by taking so many
initiatives in Vietnam, and by assuming
such prominence there, America has
put its whole credibility as an ally at
risk, so that as things stand now too
great a climb down in South Vietnam
would weaken American credibility
everywhere. The principal disaster most
of America’s allies seek to avoid is not
their own political collapse but armed
invasion. A policy which allows the
South Vietnamese to do the best they
can for themselves has risks for them
—but it is not such a risk for the rest
of the world. And is the only policy
that could lead to success in Vietnam.

WHEN THE LEAST |
MEANS THE MOST
...the little-known ‘Law of the Minimum’ is the
key to a big leap forward in Agriculture.
Because of its great age, this continent
suffers some seriously limiting defici-
encies which have occurred with the
passage of millions of years. Gradually,
the face of the continent changed and
with it the pattern of climate and soils.
It became the driest continent on the
face of the earth. Soil leached out to
become deficient in vital elements—
singularly deficient is the element phos-
phorus.
Thus, the scene was set —and with it
‘The Problem’ for the man on the land.
Unpredictable rainfall, recurring and
often disastrous droughts, limiting soil
deficiencies, the need for large land
‘holdings’ in order to maintain income,
the inevitably increasing cost of work-
ing the land and consequent diminish-
ing returns.
Foremost and of,critical importance in
the overall problem is the fact of soil
deficiencies, because it is here that im-
mediate and startling results are being
achieved. These very deficiencies have
been the spur to a major breakthrough
in plant nutrition and productivity.
These developments stem from a thought-
provoking fact of plant growth known
as ‘The Law of the Minimum.’
This law says that the ‘maximum ceil-
ing of performance’ of all plants, be they
grain crops, pastures, fruit or vines, is
set by the most deficient soil nutrient
element present, despite the abundance
of all others.
So, in fact, the least dominant factor
becomes the most important!
If the balance of soil nutrients is correc-
ted by supplementing those in short
supply, full advantage is taken of all

nutrient elements and yields are drama-
tically increased. All resources—water,
land, labour and capital investment—
are then used to full advantage and
dormant potential is realised without
any substantial increase in cost.
The process of correcting the balance
of soil nutrients may be best undertaken
by the application of chemical ferti-
lizers containing the nutrient elements
vital to plant growth. The most import-
ant of these are nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium and sulphur, because these
are required in large amounts. Second-
ary and trace elements, notably calcium,
magnesium, molybdenum, zinc, boron,
are also necessary.
Today, Greenleaf is manufacturing fer-
tilizers containing these elements in the
varying proportions required for the
balanced nutrition of our crops and
pastures.

AUSTRALIA
Will the ALP choose political
power or Victorian purity?
By ALAN REID
THE NEW ALP split is complicated by
personality clashes, State feuds, old
hates, and current jealousies. But
basically it is being fought over the
concept of whether or not there should
be overtures to the Democratic Labor
Party for a reconciliation.
On one hand, there are those like.
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam,
who believe that Labor is in the busi-
ness of politics to gain power, power to
be used to further the interests and
well-being of those who support Labor
electorally. This group consists, as far
as Labor’s elite is concerned, mainly of
Parliamentarians, though it does not
by any means include all Parliamen-
tarians. Nor is its membership ex-
clusively Parliamentary. They view
themselves as the realists. They are
essentially the “numbers” men. They
can add two and two together. They
can also do the simple arithmetic of
the Australian electorate, in which
Labor can generally rely upon 45 per-
cent of the votes, the Liberal-Country
Party combine can rely upon another
45 percent, and who is to hold govern-
ment is decided by the remaining 10
percent.
With the DLP holding and giv-
ing the impression that it is likely to
hold indefinitely the loyalty of at
least eight of this 10 percent, this ALP
group takes the attitude that there is
a mathematical compulsion upon
Labor for either reconciliation or a
deal with the DLP.
At the moment, they believe that
the prospects for reconciliation, or,
more likely a deal, with the DLP are
favorable. They know that some of the
most influential figures in the DLP
and persons outside the DLP who are
nevertheless an influence upon the
DLP, like Mr. B. A. Santamaria are
growing increasingly disillusioned with
w y hat they consider the Gorton Liberal-
Country Party coalition’s lack of
dynamism in both international and
social fields. With Labor’s and the
DLP’s social programs not markedly
different now that Labor has aban-
doned its opposition to State aid for
denominational schools (once a DLP
policy monopoly), this group believes
the time is ripe for an ALP-DLP deal.
Talks have been going on unofficially.
The ALP groups know that the DLP
will extract concessions. The first con-
cession will be the replacement or
reconstruction of the present Left-wing-
orientated Victorian ALP Executive.
The second concession will undoubtedly
be a modification of Labor’s foreign
policy.
On the other hand, there is a second
group within the ALP which holds
that Labor is in existence to maintain
the purity of its political doctrines.
This group considers Labor to be the
dynamic of Australian politics, whether
in government or opposition. Under
modern Australian conditions, they
argue, non-Labor parties are kept in an
unbreakable lockstep with Labor. If
Labor is socially radical, the non-Labor
government has to be socially radical.
The government might not be as radi-
cal as a Labor administration, but it has
to match Labor’s broad pledges, such
as on full employment and social ser-
vices, with adequate performances in
the field of full employment and social
services. Even on foreign affairs the
field in which recent non-Labor gov-
ernments have tended to differ most
widely from Labor a non-Labor
government can go only as far as
Labor and international events (and
this ALP group believes tnat its analysis
of international events and the shape
of the future is more accurate than its
opponents) permit.
Supplementing the inflexibility of this
ALP group on the necessity to preserve
Labor’s radicalism is the belief, now
growing pathetically aged but given
seeming justification at times by events
within the Liberal-CP coalition, that
sooner or later the Liberal-Country
Party combination will collapse under
the weight of internal differences and
Labor, as the only alternative, will be-
swept into the power vacuum then exist-
ing on the Treasury benches.
Once this necessarily lengthy explana-
tion is understood the otherwise inex-
plicable events that took place within
the ALP Federal Executive, including
the proposed resignation of Opposition
Leader Whitlam at next week’s Parlia-
mentary caucus meeting and the Federal
ALP Executive’s devotion of almost
three full days to a wrangle on
whether the credentials of Tasmanian
delegate Mr. R. B. Harradine should
be accepted, take on meaning.
The Executive was not fighting on
Left, Gough Whitlam, and,
above r R. B. Harradine,
leave the ALP Federal
Executive conference. At
right, federal secretary
Cyril Wyndham talks to
the Press


whether a man named Harradine
should be accepted as one of Tas-
mania’s two delegates to the Executive.
What the Executive was fighting on
was whether approval should be tacitly
given for continuance of the negoti-
ations (known to be already in train)
for reconciliation or a deal with the
DLP.
For Whitlam it was a frustrating
week which culminated in his seem-
ingly impulsive decision (I for one
cannot find anyone of significant
stature within the Labor Party whom
he consulted before he made his de-
cision) to resign his leadership and
seek a vote of confidence by contest-
ing it before Parliament meets on
Tuesday, April 30.
He must have realised how shrewdly
he had been outmanoeuvred when he
secured his much - vaunted Federal
Executive reforms which he intended
should add himself and his deputy,
Lance Barnard, to the then twelve-man-
strong Federal ALP Executive. Instead
of adding just Whitlam and Barnard,
the Executive, with seeming generosity,
added all four of Labor’s Parliamentary
leaders. On division after division,
Whitlam last week found his vote and
Barnard’s nullified by the votes of
Senate Labor Leader Lionel Murphy
and Senate Deputy Leader Sam Cohen.
He even had his nose rubbed in the
dirt on his telegram to his Parliamen-
tary followers in which he complained
about Murphy and Cohen voting against
him on the Executive.
Less than an hour later, one of his
own Parliamentary followers, Mr. Mar-
tin Nicholls, MHR, S.A., moved a
motion seeking Executive endorsement
for the proposition that Parliamentar-
ians on Federal Executive were not only
entitled but expected to exercise in-
dependent judgment on matters before
the Executive.
Whitlam (who has never realised
that on the Federal Executive he is
dealing with tough pros, not amateurs
who succumb to a fluent speech) was
jammed into the humiliating position
that he had to repudiate his own tele-
gram. If he had not, he would have
gone down 14/1.
It was a disastrous meeting for Labor
electorally. It revealed Labor’s Par-
liamentary leadership as split from top
to bottom. It left Tasmania boycotting
the Federal Executive and Whitlam
boycotting the Victorian ALP.
It was a disastrous meeting for Whit-
lam personally. His task now is to see
that the caucus meeting next Tuesday,
when he resigns his leadership to seek
a vote of confidence by recontesting the
position, does not end as disastrously.
The only way in which he can prevent
disaster is by “downing” Murphy and
Cohen and replacing them on the Fed-
eral Executive with his own selection.
Indonesian co-operation
What Malik said
THE LACK OF imagination of those
who run this country’s foreign policy
is something The Bulletin has often
pointed out. It was vividly illustrated
last week when Indonesian Foreign
Minister Adam Malik arrived on his
official visit to Australia.
Getting off the plane and having met
External Affairs Minister Hasluck and
his handsome daughter-in-law, Mr.
Malik invited journalists present to
come over to his hotel, where he would
hold a Press conference.
He seemed pleased when asked about
possible defence co-operation with Aus-
tralia; the ABC’s Les Love quoted to
him the statement by the new In-
donesian Ambassador to Australia,
Lieut-General Badan Hidajat, at the
official ceremony when he presented his
credentials to the Governor-General a
fortnight ago: “Closer co-operation in
the field of security for the purpose of
safeguarding the integrity of our two
countries should be developed.” He
was asked whether he envisaged a
bilateral security arrangement with Aus-
tralia, and, answering through the First
Secretary of the Embassy, Mr. Alex
Marintek, whose English is excellent,
he answered: “Yes, at this stage we are
thinking of it. We are studying the
question. We will think about it and
we will talk about it (with your
Government).” Questioned about New
Guinea he was even more precise: “If
there is a threat from outside we can
oppose it together, if the threat is from
within we can co-operate to wipe it
out.”
There was no misunderstanding. Two
reporters present at the time speak In-
donesian and both confirmed the cor-
rectness of the First Secretary’s trans-
lation and the interpretation being put
on it by journalists. No External
Affairs Department officials were pre-
sent at the conference, but, on hearing
of what the Indonesian Foreign
Minister had said, Departmental
spokesmen began an astonishing
exercise. Journalists present were in-
dividually telephoned and attempts
made to persuade them that Mr. Malik
had not said what all their memories
and notebooks recorded.
Checking with the Indonesian Em-
bassy early in the afternoon, jour-
nalists were told their interpretation
was correct and that there was no
thought of any rebuttal.
But External Affairs in the end got
their way, even though Mr. Malik’s
rebuttal did not come until the next
day. Taking journalists aside at the
ECAFE Conference, he said his inter-
preter had made a mistake. He hadn’t
been talking about defence. “We are
only talking about a trade and aid
agreement and about an agricultural
agreement at present.” When speaking
of threats to New Guinea he had meant
those threats were connected not with
defence but with illiteracy, poverty, and
underdevelopment.
External Affairs officials afterwards
said they were only concerned to
scotch the idea that Mr. Malik was
intending to talk about some ANZUS-
type mutual security treaty.
It seems that what Mr. Malik pro-
posed to discuss with the Government
was some sort of general treaty of
friendship and non-aggression. There
is no suggestion that he was thinking
in terms of any defence treaty with
Indonesia’s Foreign Minister, Adam
Malik, with the South Vietnamese
Ambassador, Tran Kim Phuong, in
Canberra last week
specific mutual obligations for assist-
ance in time of attack. He also appar-
ently wanted to discuss military co-
operation. Indonesia would like to
send servicemen to some of our mili-
tary training establishments.
All these developments are completely
consistent with the Government’s
frequent statements in support of
greater regional co-operation in South-
East Asia and there was astonishment
in the Services that the External Affairs
Department should appear to want to
discourage them. Australia obviously
does not want to be put in the position
of being committed to helping the
Indonesian Government to suppress
dissident regional elements, whether in
New Guinea or other parts of the
country. And it does not want Indo-
nesia to lose valuable Russian economic
aid by identifying itself too closely
with Western countries." But Mr. Malik
is the best judge of how far he can go
in that regard.
Perhaps the most likely explanation
for the External Affairs’ action against
Mr. Malik was simple annoyance at
him for the way in which he broke his
statement that he was interested in
talking defence. It just wasn’t Mr.
Hasluck’s way of doing things.
Not that the Government lacked
other ways of doing things.
In Kuala Lumpur, Arijiy Minister


Lynch declared that Australia might be
able to send more troops in its assist-
ance to Malaysian defence. “He should
keep his mouth shut,” was one Minis-
ter’s comment on reading the report.
If anything, there was going to be a
reduction in our troop commitment.
And when the subject of a Vietnam
allies’ meeting was raised, the Prime
Minister’s office wrote off the idea in
a very cavalier fashion. So, evidently,
an opportunity to discover American
negotiating intentions and possibly put
an Australian view on what com-
promises are desirable is forgone.
Defence
F-111 credibility
WHEN PARLIAMENT resumes next
week, its first main item of business
will be a statement by Defence Minis-
ter Fairhall. It is a long-awaited
speech, the Government having prom-
ised last year to make full reports
on the cost of the F-11l swing-wing
bomber project, and on the defence
implications of the accelerated British
withdrawal from this area.
The cost of the F-11l is understood
to have risen some $3O-$4O million be-
yond the last announced figure t)f
$240 million. But the apparent cost of
the project may be reduced by a deci-
sion to abandon plans to fit out six
of the planes with advanced recon-
naissance equipment. But Fairhall
will have to explain the effect of this
on the capability of the fleet. On the
face of it, the lack of reconnaissance
planes would reduce seriously Austra-
lia’s capacity for independent military
action, and would affect the credibility
of the bombers in the case of an
American withdrawal from Asia.
Of the $U.5.370 million credits
arranged in 1964 for purchases of
defence equipment in America, $9O
million is still unused. Orders have to
be placed before June 30 if advantage
is to be taken of the financing arrange-
ments. These provide low-interest
money repayable over seven years,
and the Treasury wants the Govern-
ment to take full advantage of them.
So an announcement of further defence
equipment purchases is very likely
soon.
The Army wants a variety of equip-
ment for which, in Vietnam operations,
it has to depend on the Americans:
medium and heavy artillery, gunship
and troop-carrying helicopters. The
Air Force needs troop-carrying trans-
port planes to supplement its Hercules
fleet. And the Navy is putting up argu-
ments for an expansion of its escort
and anti-submarine capacity.
Cabinet has had several long sessions
discussing the attitude which our
representative at the UN should take
on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty. So far, it has not reached
agreement. The most likely compromise
for the time being is a wait-and-see
decision: an effort to put off the
Australian speech until it is clear what
neighboring countries intend to do.
President Johnson’s decision not to
run again has thrown heavy doubts
on the continuance of the American
presence in Asia and many people in
government see it as an extra reason
for not signing the nuclear treaty.
Even if they do not think we should
now build the bomb, they argue
we should not close the option off.
Mr. Fairhall has made clear his
opposition to our signing the treaty,
stressing that it asks Australia to sign
away a right of unknown value for a
whole 25 years, during which all sorts
of changes in our strategic situation
and in military technology could occur.
But, unless Cabinet is unexpectedly
able to come to agreement in the
meantime, it looks as though Mr. Fair-
hall’s defence statement in Parliament
will not touch on nuclear matters.
ECAFE
The acute problem of peace
ONE OF THE original UN officials,
Mr. David Owen, the Director of the
UN Development Program, began his
address to the ECAFE Conference in
Canberra by complimenting the organ-
isers on the documents they had pre-
pared. These are more than a foot high,
and journalists staggered under their
weight. Appropriately enough, one of
them dealt with the subject: “Measures
for controlling documentation.”
But in among the inevitable boring
windiness and pleasantry of such
occasions every single . delegation
started by congratulating Mr. Hasluck
on his election as chairman of the Con-
ference (a sheer formality since Aus-
tralia was the host nation) and saying
how beautiful Canberra was —a number
of important matters were discussed
and a variety of interesting views ex-
pressed.
The Secretariat of ECAFE con-
tributed to the dialogue by a strongly
opinionated survey of the region’s pros-
pects. It said emphatically that the pro-
gress of the past few years —especially
the spectacular increases in food pro-
duction in India and other countries—
was a recovery only, and did not
presage any trend toward faster pro-
gress in getting food production ahead
of population. It argued that peace in
Vietnam would cause acute problems
of readjustment for many countries in
the region, since so many were doing
well out of supplying materials and
rest and recreation services to the
Americans.
There was welcome evidence of co-
operation in industrial development.
In iron and steel production, notorious
once because of countries attempting
over-large prestige plants, six South-
East Asian countries are agreeing on a
planned division of labor, so to speak.
Taiwan is concentrating on mills to
produce hot rolled coils and plates
for the region, the Philippines is
specialising in cold rolling, Indonesia
in merchant bars, and so on. The
American firm Koppers Co. is acting
as main adviser to the group. Aus-
tralia evidently has offered to develop
an iron and steel research institute for
the region. Cambodia, Laos, and Viet-
nam have made requests for similar
Hasluck chairs the ECAFE Conference
last week
assistance in working out joint plans
for iron and steel manufacture.
Australian delegates did not make
much early impact at the Conference.
External Affairs Minister Hasluck made
only one really strong statement:
“against the problems bedevilling the
international monetary system and
adversely affecting both trade and aid
flows.” So long, he said, as these prob-
lems remain, the economic advancement
of developing countries will be in-
hibited. Considering that the Aus-
tralian Government has discouraged in-
vitations to join the groun of ten central
bankers who are principally concerned
with international monetary reform, it
was a surprising stress to put in a
speech.
Mr. Hasluck showed no sense of
occasion. The only announcement made
by Australia was that we had agreed
to participate at the second Asian-
Trade Fair at Tehran in 1969.
There was no announcement about
contribution to the special agricultural
funds of the Asian Development Bank
(such an announcement will have to
be made some time, with Japan and the
U.S., the other two developed members,
contributing generously). There could
possibly have been a statement that on
the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam,
Australia will devote the resources it


saves to economic aid? The one per-
cent aid target advocated by so many
different international forums is steadily
being approached by Australia, and it
would have gained Australia good pub-
licity to have set off the Conference
with a pledge to reach that goal by,
say, 1972. But it was left to others to
make the gestures and get the head-
lines.
Nuclear power
Canberra first
THE AUSTRALIAN Atomic Energy
Commission is putting to the Common-
wealth Government a detailed proposal
for the country’s first nuclear power
station. It is planned for Canberra, and
The Bulletin understands it would be
located on the Molonglo River, a few
miles east of the city. The only nuclear
plant existing in Australia at present is
a tiny experimental reactor at Lucas
Heights, near Sydney.
The proposed Canberra station is a
200-megawatt plant estimated to cost
$4B million, and if the go-ahead is soon
given it will be completed by 1975.
Canberra is on the main 330-kilovolt
transmission line linking-the Victorian
and N.S.W. electricity grids and the
Snowy Mountains system. But the capi-
tal city’s baseload electricity is relatively
expensive because of its distance from
the baseload stations north of Sydney.
(The nearby Snowy provides only peak
power.)
The Canberra nuclear station would
provide power at less than half a cent
a kilowatt-hour, compared to the cost
of baseload power transmitted the
200-odd miles from N.S.W. coalfield
stations. It is, therefore, an economic
proposition for supplying the rapidly
growing Canberra power market. By
1975 Canberra’s peakload demand is
estimated to have risen from today’s
90mW to about the 200mW figure, so
it would fully take up the power being
produced by the Molonglo River
nuclear station.
In Canberra’s slack power hours the
station could feed cheap electricity into
the N.S.W.-Victoria grid. One proposed
use for this surplus is in the nearby
Snowy Mountains region, where it
could very profitably be used in
“pumped-storage” systems. These make
use of cheap surplus electricity to pump'
water from low reservoirs up to high
reservoirs so that the capacity of the
hydro scheme to generate peak load
power is increased. One such system is
already being installed at the Tumut
Three station, and this, together with
the Jindabyne pumping station, could
put to profitable use the off-peak sur-
pluses from Canberra’s nuclear plant.
The Atomic Energy Commission
proposes the Canadian and Indian
heavy-water moderated system, which
has the advantage of using raw
uranium as a fuel and does not re-
quire overseas processing. American,
European, and Japanese nuclear plants
require enriched fuels, and unless Aus-
tralia were to embark on a really
large nuclear program we would be
dependent on other countries for the
ennchment processing.
The Canberra design very closely
apP roxl (y* ates the Douglas Point
Candu station in Canada, which has
been in operation for some time now.
Canada is in the process of building
a plant at Pickering using the same
system but ten times as large pro-
ducing as much power as the entire
Snowy Scheme.
The Australian Atomic Energy Com-
mission could co-operate very closely
with its Canadian counterparts, though
many ticklish diplomatic problems
cou d be generated if Australia asked
foi extensive assistance. The Canadians
have insisted in their arrangements
with the Indian Government on under-
takings not to use the plutonium by-
product from their nuclear plants for
bomb-making.
This is not the Australian Atomic
Energy Commission’s first proposal
for a nuclear power station. Its first
proposal, in 1963, was for a plant simi-
lar in size to the Canberra one, near
Adelaide—but the capital cost at that
time was in the region of $lOO million
and unit costs of the electricity would
have been 0.9 c per kWh more than con-
ventional power plants. Technological
advance has drastically reduced costs so
that in a number of places Canberra
being the most obvious nuclear
power is cheaper than any other,
South Australia is no longer favored
because of the Commonwealth’s com-
mitment to provide it with finance for
natural gas from Gidgealpa and the
fact that its power needs are now well
catered for.
Another strong argument in favor of
the Canberra location is the lack of
constitutional and legal complications
in building and operating the plant on
Commonwealth Territory.
Other submissions to the Government
suggest that it make a general offer
to State electricity authorities that it is
prepared to consider helping them
finance and build nuclear power plants
if surveys show that they come close to
conventional stations in cost,
Australia lags far behind other ad-
vanced countries in nuclear develop-
ment, and is also backward compared to
several developing countries such as
Spain, Bulgaria, Argentina, and Pakis-
tan, a jj 0 f which have nuclear power
plants in the course of construction,
j n t he United States and Japan there
are now more nuc l e ar power stations
under construction than conventional
thermal and hydro plants, and the
Atomic Energy Commission in its last
annual report pointed out that through-
out the world there are now 184 plants
in operation, under construction, or
definitely committed. About a dozen
more have since been announced. Aus-
tralia’s first at Canberra could be num-
ber 200.
Prime Minister’s Department
Wash-up in the think-tank
Prime Minister Gorton leaving, hospital
last week
WHEN Prime Minister Gorton
announced he was dividing his Depart-
ment into two, his spokesmen ex-
plained that the idea was to concen-
trate Cabinet work in the new Depart-
ment. The remaining members of the
Prime Minister’s Department, then left
free of servicing the Cabinet, could
become a “think-tank.” So far at least
things are not working out that way,
and no one even in the Department
claims that many ideas are coming
out of the pool.
Some members of the Department
don’t even like the idea of it being
a think-tank. “The whole Government
should be a think-tank,” one said last
week. He thought the best way to des-
cribe the division of responsibility be-
tween the two Departments was to
say that the PM’s was to advise the
Prime Minister, and the Cabinet secre-
tariat was to service Cabinet and its
committees.
In Cabinet secretariat the head,
Sir John Bunting, has three senior
second-division officers and a small
collection of assistants. If, as the

Prime Minister has been saying, he
intends to transfer a certain amount
of work from the full Cabinet to
Cabinet committees, then they will be
very busy. But reports so far suggest
the committees have not even been
formed, so that as yet the new Depart-
ment does not have much to do.
Prime Minister’s meanwhile ploughs
on with its routine work: answering or
passing on to other Departments the
hundreds of letters addressed by pri-
vate citizens to the Prime Minister,
preparing notes on submissions made
to Cabinet by other Departments, and
helping the Prime Minister with notes
for his speeches and statemehts. Some
sections are doing purely administrative
work related to Australia House in
London, looking after the Governor-
General, or arranging visits by foreign
VIPs, for instance.
Four sections of six or seven officers
each are concerned with policy —-
economic policy, economic develop-
ment, economic general, and defence
and external relations. It is these
which are supposed to become the
“think-tank.”
Whether they come to justify this
d(‘ r cription will depend on the perfor-
mance of the new departmental head,
Mr. Len Hewitt. A man of tremen-
dous energy and drive, he is known
among senior public servants and
Ministers for his role in the Treasury
where he was that Department’s
leading examiner of requests by other
Departments for money. He acquired
the nickname “Dr. No.” His bluntness
over the years in knocking the argu-
ment of the spending in Departments
has earned him widespread hostility.
The Prime Minister’s Department
by itself can only be a very limited
“think-tank” because of its lack of
specialisation and detailed knowledge
of problems. It will only acquire a
significant think-tank role if its relat-
ions with other specialist Departments
can be developed. And this depends
very niuch on Mr. Hewitt’s ability to
develop a new relationship with his
colleagues.
South Australia
The quick kill
THE FALL of the Dunstan Govern-
ment in South Australia last week had
been freely predicted, but this did not
stop people from finding the process
intensely interesting. First of all, there
were the usual formalities in the morn-
ing with the swearing in of Members
before the Commissioners. Then came
the election of Speaker, when the Gov-
ernment unexpectedly nominated an
Opposition MP, to the surprise of both
the Member and his Party. Recover-
ing quickly, they in turn nominated the
Independent Mr. Tom Stott. In the
19-19 Party situation Mr. Stott’s vote

for himself carried the day, and, fol-
lowing formal congratulations, he went
off to change into his wig. The new
Speaker and the Cabinet then went
over the road to see the Governor, and
then back again to await the Gover-
nor’s return visit.
His arrival was heralded by several
hundred demonstrating students whose
smoke bombs are the closest South
Australia has come to having a “gun-
powder plot.” Their chant, “we want
democracy,” drifted into the Upper
House as the Governor read what must
have been the shortest opening speech
in the history of colonial legislatures,
taking about two minutes and announc-
ing electoral reform as the only
measure his Government wished to in-
troduce.
Back in the Lower House, the Gov-
ernment was still Mr. Dunstan’s and
he rose to move that a Court of Dis-
puted Returns be set up. When the
Speaker had finished reading the
Premier Hall... no fair go
motion, Mr. Steele Hall moved that the
House adjourn. This was the quick
kill. The House divided, the Speaker
gave his casting vote, and Mr. Dun-
stan went over the road to resign.
The next day, Dunstan moved out of
the Premier’s office and his staff were
crying and Hall moved in beaming.
That afternoon, as Leader of the
Opposition, Dunstan made a surprise
bid in the House to introduce a motion
to amend the Constitution Act and this
was the final testing of the Speaker,
who had previously said he might act
independently on electoral reform. The
House divided, the casting vote went
against the measure. The new Govern-
ment introduced its motion setting up
a court of Disputed Returns, and when
this was passed the House adjourned
for a month with the Court sitting
almost immediately.
The Court of Disputed Returns will
have two seats before it —Millicent
and Chaffey. Millicent is held by the
ALP by one vote, and the LCL will
argue for a further recount to include
a number of previously disqualified
postal votes. Chaffey was a surprise
petition, being introduced subsequent
to the ALP’s decision not to take the
seat of Murray to the Court. Chaffey is
now held by the LCL who have a
majority of 550 votes. But the discovery
last week of an opened bundle of un-
counted votes on a shelf in a city news-
agent’s shop, and of a noticeable dis-
crepancy between the numbers of Chaf-
fey electors and the votes counted, sud-
denly threw shadows of serious doubt
on the declared Chaffey result. The
additional votes could have markedly
changed the distribution of preferences
for the seat.
As the Parties stand now, any effec-
tive redistribution will require the sup-
port of both sides of the House. The
Constitution requires that an absolute
majority of members vote for con-
stitutional amendments, and in an
equally divided House any Party oppos-
ing a change can eliminate the Speak-
er’s casting vote by simply having one
Member step outside. If the LCL
argues effectively about Millicent and
unseats the ALP, and retains Chaffey,
it would have an absolute majority
and the power to redistribute the elec-
torates any way it wished. At the
moment its intentions would seem to
be only a little better than those which
gave South Australia its present gerry-
mander. . j
Premier Hall has been very straight
about this. He has said simply that his
Party favors a 45-Member Lower
House comprising 25 metropolitan
seats and 20 country seats, with a 30
percent difference in seat quotas. Even
forgetting about this newly introduced
allowable disparity, one commentator
has pointed out that the scheme would
lead to country electorates with about
9000 votes and city electorates with
about 16,800 votes, with the consequent
easy possibility of continuing minority
Governments.
Only one thing militates against a
further cynical redistribution in South
Australia, and that is the quite direct
criticism of the State’s political
immaturity by the interstate Press.
The afternoon Adelaide tabloid, the
‘“News,” has even devoted its second
page on several occasions to the re-
printing of interstate editorials and car-
toons. This has dismayed a great many
people not at all used to candid Press
criticism of South Australian politics.
Hall has blamed Dunstan for much
of this criticism, claiming that he sold
the State short by encouraging inter-
state newspapers to be biased. If this
were so then Dunstan’s power to influ-
ence the editorial opinions of nearly
every major Australian newspaper is
quite remarkable. The truth is that as
it is at present constituted in South
Australia, the LCL will not accept the
fact that most Australians in most
places are genuinely interested in the
idea of a democratic fair go.


OVERSEAS
South Vietnamese don’t know
whether to laugh or cry
LIKE TRAGIC and comic masks
flanking the stage, the mouths of prom-
inent Vietnamese politicians and offi-
cials in Saigon are turned down or up
today—depending on whether they are
on the right or the left—as the drama
of United States disengagement opens.
Most of Saigon’s anti-Communists are
hitter at the American move. Most
“neutralists” are gently jubilant. “The
name of the game,” a disillusioned
Right-wing official said coldly, parody-
ing the current American get-on-the-
team phrase, “is desertion.” “And the
chief victim,” a Left-wing parliament-
arian added happily a day later, “is
to be President Nguyen Van Thieu
himself.”
It was useless to object that the
Americans had promised their full sup-
port to President Thieu as the elected
and constitutional head of State of
South Vietnam. That earned only the
contemptuous rejoiner that President
Ngo Dinh Diem had also been upheld
by the Americans as the elected con-
stitutional head of State, and had ended
up in a pool of blood on the floor of
an army weapon carrier. Washington’s
-exclusive backing of Thieu simply
served the purpose of discouraging the
detractors and rivals like Vice-President
Nguyen Cao Ky from plotting his over-
throw, it was claimed, for Ky knew that
if he seized power from Thieu he might
be giving the Americans a perfect ex-
cuse for washing their hands of Vietnam
altogether. For this reason alone, men
more accustomed to coups than con-
stitutions, were staying their hands.
1 But Hanoi had refused to deal with
Thieu, and since the Americans were
bent on negotiating he would have to
be ditched, it was argued. Thieu’s own
refusal to talk to the National Libera-
tion Front, and his pledge to fight on
alone against the Communists, even if
the Americans abandoned Vietnam
irredeemable without Washington’s sup-
port —would provide him with graceful
excuses to resign. He might then be sent
abroad as an ambassador.
Wa ngton’s announcement that the
final total- of 549,500 Americans will
not be increased and that the major
military effort is to be “turned over”
to the Vietnamese, so that U.S. units
can be “drawn back” has confirmed the
more cynical Vietnamese analysts in
their views.
The launching of the mammoth
military operations “Complete Vic-
tory” and “Carentan 2” to clear 20,000
Viet Cong out of the provinces around
Saigon and to sweep the hills of Hue
and Quang Tri are regarded as no
more than battles for bargaining coun-
ters at the truce table. And South
Vietnamese believe that the bombing
pause is a put-up job that comes very
close to treachery. If,' as even “neut-
ralists” agree, Hanoi has been hard
hit by the bombing, the pause will give
the North Vietnamese time to catch
their breath and mend their fences. If,
on the other hand, the Communists
are building up for a new Tet offen-
sive June is favored as D-month
in order to improve their own bargain-
ing position, or to try to win the war
outright, the pause for talks will enable
them to shovel men and arms south-
wards all the more freely.
Between the down-turned and up-
turned mouths sit the real audience,
the 17 million people of South Viet-
nam on whose mood and morale the
country’s will to fight for fitting terms
must depend. But they have yet to
reveal whether they think the scene
calls for tears or smiles.
Perceptive men among Vietnam’s
anti-Communists, dismayed by the first
halting steps that could yet take Hanoi
and Washington to the conference
table, are, above all, worried about the
morale of the armed forces and of
the 17 million ordinary people from
whom they spring. For they fear that
a Communist “peace offensive” could
soften up the people more effectively
than any war.
Officials in Saigon anticipate that
the Viet Cong will now launch a
double-pronged onslaught on the
hearts and minds of the millions. They
will strike home the bloody lessons of
war with new attacks, including a pat-
tern of vicious assaults against the
quarters of the wives and families of
regular soldiers and of the regional
troops and “popular forces” defending
district towns and villages.
At the same time they will urge
the men themselves that it is ridicu-
lous to fight on when peace is around
the corner and the struggle is virtually
over. They will assassinate the recalci-
trant and stiff-necked, and simul-
taneously entice officers and officials
into giving them their allegiance by
promising them that those who repent
At Saigon University President Thieu
said there might have to be a general
mobilisation
early will be spared punishment for
past anti-Communist sins when the
National Liberation Front takes the
country.
The unity of the South Vietnamese
will be destroyed. The morale of the
troops will flake away. On the out-
skirts of Saigon and other towns the
truce-happy checkpoints will become
slovenly and complacent, letting through
the closed up lorries driven by under-
cover Viet Cong cadres whose contents
no one will know until the claymore
mines and the Chinese-made grenade
launchers wreak sudden havoc in the
city centre.
It becomes painfully clear that the
most ordinary Vietnamese are unwill-
ing to sport boldly the colors of either
side. During the Tet offensive the VC
punctured the capital like ah egg, even
if they did not crack it open. At the
same time the assault on South Viet-
nam’s towns drew into the urban areas
most “revolutionary development” -
teams and 18 out of 51 Vietnamese
battalions, respectively responsible for
improving and protecting sanitised
hamlets ostensibly cleansed of Viet
Cong. These abandoned communities
inevitably reverted to the political
jungle as the VC cadres slipped in
among the peasants again with their
compelling compound of ideology and
intimidation.
American officials say that through-
out South Vietnam at least six and
sometimes eight out of ten of their
pacification teams are back in the vil-
lages. But they cannot promise security


twice and they can no longer work in
hamlets remote from the provincial and
district capitals, for they need the pro-
tection of Vietnamese troops who are
now reluctant to move far from wives
and families quartered in the very
towns which the Tet offensive proved so
vulnerable.
Across the mountainous jungles and
swampy waterways, ministries in Saigon
can again send pay to provincial
officials. The roads are largely open in
daylight and letters get through to dis-
trict towns. But it is the shadow admin-
istration of the Viet Cong with its
own provincial and district officers, its
own village and hamlet chiefs, that
controls the rice and recruiting.
Men are thinking in terms of survival
—their own and that of their families.
Recruited by the Viet Cong or drafted
by the South Vietnamese army, the
peasant conscript will shoot not to be
shot, play the hero simply to stay alive
and defend his own. Morale and
loyalty, therefore, are in the two pans
of a balance that may be tipped by a
breath of defeat or victory on either
side. It is for this reason that the
“hawks” in the Saigon Government
regard with despair what they see as
the soul-sapping news of the first over-
tures of peace,
If negotiations open and lead to a
collapse of morale among the citizens
and soldiers of South Vietnam, the
world may be astonished to see how
swiftly prominent anti-Communists
among the country’s generals and poli-
ticians prove ready to cross over to
their former enemies—on the principle
that if you can’t lick them, join them.
For while some of them may believe
in a just war in Vietnam, none believes
in a just peace.
The Communist world
The germs from
Prague
IT IS hard luck on Mr. Brezhnev and
Mr. Kosygin. Just as things seem to be
moving their way in Vietnam, they
have run into bad trouble nearer home.
Russia’s leaders are seriously alarmed
by what the Czechs’ experiment with
freedom could do to the structure of
Communist Europe. Mr. Kosygin had
to hurry back from Iran to attend a
session of his Central Committee just
before Easter. On April 10 the com-
mittee, having heard Mr. Brezhnev’s
report, issued a clarion call for vigil-
ance, discipline, and a relentless
“struggle against bourgeois ideology.”
The alarm over what is happening in
Prague has spread very wide. The East
Germans were the first to make hostile
noises. Then the Poles mounted their
Kosygin arid Brezhnev. .. behind their smiles alarm over the Czech experiment
of combining Communism and freedom
attack on their own dissenters. Now it
is the turn of the Russians. A ghost is
haunting the bureaucratic leaders of
Eastern Europe. It is the ghost of
change.
The Russians and their friends are
worried about three main things. The
first is the way the Czech economic
reform is moving. The Russians believe
that Communist countries have not yet
reached a state of economic develop-
ment in which they can afford to do
without a protective wall against the
capitalists outside. If the central
planners’ monopoly over foreign trade
is abolished, they say, individual Com-
munist firms will be faced by capitalist,
industrial giants and will rapidly be
dominated by them. The fear is seldom
spelled out, since it involves an admis-
sion that productivity is lower in Com-
munist countries than it is in the capi-
talist world.
The Russians’ second worry is about
Czech foreign policy. If the Czechs
continue to push ahead along their own
road to Socialism, the changes they are
making are bound to have a bearing on
their conduct in the councils of world
Communism. It might even lead in
the end to a realignment of their
foreign policy. But this has not become
a real problem yet. The Czechs have
shrewdly put first things first. They
have'concentrated on domestic reform
and proclaimed time and again their
fidelity to the Soviet alliance. Herr
Ulbricht in East Germany is obviously
perturbed by the West Germans’ interest
in what happens in Prague. Yet by
comparison with the nationalist rebel-
lion of the Rumanians, the Czechs’
foreign policy is still relatively
orthodox.
The real Czech heresy is political. It
is the open debate in Prague that has
sent a shiver down the spine of estab-
lished Party rulers throughout eastern
Europe. It is not pleasant to admit
that you are frightened of freedom. Yet
it is obvious that the criticism of official
policy that is now allowed in Prague
strikes at the very heart of the system
which eastern Europe got from Stalin
and under which it still lives even
though the worst of Stalin's tyranny is
a thing of the past. This is why the
Party bureaucrats in Sofia, Budapest,
and Warsaw are alarmed. This is why
Mr. Brezhnev has precipitated his cam-
paign against recalcitrant writers. Where
no political opposition is allowed, it is
the writers who transmit the germ of
heresy.
What disturbs the Soviet leaders is
not so much debate at the top as the
publicity that is given to it. In all the
politburos, not least the Russian one,
the men at the top fight it out over
programs and personalities. But they
do so behind closed doors. Once a
compromise is struck between them, it
becomes the official Party line and is
imposed from above through an
obedient Party machine. But if the
veil of secrecy is lifted from the dis-
cussions at the top, the debate will
inevitably spread to the rank and file
of the Party and probably beyond it to-
the country at large. Three years ago
the Italian Communist leaders tried an
experiment in “publicity of debate.”
They gave it up very quickly because
democracy was spreading too quickly
for their taste. If it was too much for
the Italians, it would be unthinkable
for the Russians.
If the right to dissent is to mean
anything, even if only within the Com-
munist Party, it will have to be guaran-
teed. The minority point of view must
be allowed to organise itself on a con-
tinuing basis. It must also be allowed
the means to broadcast its views through
the Press, the radio, and television.
This is the very least that will be neces-
sary if the present system is to demo-
cratise itself in any significant way.
At the present stage of development
in eastern Europe this guaranteed right
to dissent within the Communist Party
is probably more important than toler-
ating small non-Communist parties.
These puppet parties are mere ven-
triloquist’s dummies. They in no way
disturb the pyramidal system of rule,
in which all decisions come down from
the apex. It would make very little
difference if such nominal parties were
permitted in Russia, too. It is much
more important that there should be
some kind of democracy within the
Communist Party. That would be the
Eastern equivalent of consensus politics
in the West. It would be a guarantee
for nervous Communists that the basic
features of their society, such as public
ownership of the means of production


or central planning, would not be
abolished.
The bureaucrats who would feel
themselves threatened by this sort of
reform will doubtless protest that even
a form of limited democracy within
the Communist Party would contain
the seeds of the Party’s destruction.
They will say that it could lead to
some kind of two-Party system. They
have a point. A political group de-
feated in a debate at the top of the
Party hierarchy would tend to take the
matter to a wider body, say the Cen-
tral Committee. If its case were popu-
lar and it had the means for present-
ing it, it would naturally try to appeal
to public opinion. Just how much of
a. threat this poses to the men in power
depends on how much the mass of the
population has come to accept the
political and social system these men
are trying to uphold. The Czechs can
probably afford to be less dictatorial
than the Poles. At the same time, the
amount of coercion applied by the men
in power may well be much more than
is required. This is true of Russia,
which could certainly afford more
political relaxation without any real
danger to the foundations of its system.
In allegedly defending Socialism, Mr.
Brezhnev and Mr. Kosygin are really
defending a form of bureaucratic
government on which their own power
and position rest.
The Czech experiment is more im-
portant than the Yugoslav one.
Czechoslovakia is not an outcast from
the Communist system as Yugoslavia
was. It is more highly developed and
more sophisticated than Yugoslavia is.
It exercises that much more attraction.
For all these reasons, the Czech attempt
to combine Communism with freedom
is of historical importance. But for Mr.
Brezhnev and his colleagues in Russia
it is a case of heads you win, tails I
lose. If the experiment gets out of
hand, the Soviet leaders could be faced
with a problem as frightening as the
one they faced in Hungary in 1956. If
it succeeds, no amount of vigilance
against intellectual dissenters will pre-
vent the infection from spreading and
from threatening the rulers of other
Communist countries. This is why
all eyes, particularly those in the Krem-
lin, are now on Prague.
The Presidency
The Nixon doubters
MR. RICHARD NIXON re-entered
the American election campaign in
Washington on Friday after a two-
week absence from the political scene.
Appearing before a crowded ballroom
audience of newspaper editors, he was
on his best form. He was commanding,
fluent, and impressive, demonstrating
once again that if the American elec-
torate wants a President who can think
on his feet and possesses a real grasp of
all contemporary issues, then there is
a serious case to be made for the man
who served for eight years as Eisen-
hower’s understudy.
Surprisingly, however, this is a case
that it was much easier for Mr. Nixon
to make two or three weeks ago than
it is today. Now that the dust has
begun to settle, it looks more and more
as if the real casualty of Lyndon John-
son’s Withdrawal, of Bobby Kennedy’s
power bid, even of Hubert Humphrey’s
expected decision to enter the race, is
the candidate who at first seemed least
affected by their decisions.
In a way it is hard to know why
Richard Nixon has not gained, as he
might legitimately have expected to
do, from being the one stable factor
in an otherwise transformed situation.
As Republican support for Nixon,
seen announcing his Vietnam “mor-
atorium” on Friday, wavered last
week, a possible benefactor was
Mayor John Lindsay of New York
(left). He was reported to have
made a deal with California’s
Reagan (below with Nelson Rocke-
feller, who is also expected to enter
the running shortly)
Perhaps the cruellest answer is tho
best: that all that has happened has
at last injected excitement into the
contest, and excitement and Mr. Nixon
are not natural stablemates.
He is an orderly, methodical, well-
organised politician, never at a loss
for an answer but equally never cap-
able of producing an original idea.
For Americans he is, as it were, part
of the furniture: a man, or so the gibe
goes, who has been about for so long
that he has even ceased to be con-
troversial.
As such he was a plausible horse for
the course against a personally un-
popular President. But against Bobby
Kennedy? Against Eugene McCarthy?
Against even his own fellow old trouper,
Hubert Humphrey?
Even the Republican Party, it seems,
is beginning to have doubts. From
State caucuses all over the country the
message last week was the same. While
in no way repudiating Nixon, a mass of
prospective delegates to the Republican
Convention have suddenly decided to
stay uncommitted.
It is hard on Nixon, as there is little
he can do about it. His whole campaign
strategy is in shreds. His original com-
mitment to a virtual marathon course
in the primaries was designed to show
that he was, after all, a winner. But
the object of that exercise was frus-
trated when, in Governor Ronald
Reagan’s vivid phrase, “the other team
didn’t show up.”
Again, his proclaimed plan to present
himself as the experienced helmsman
of American foreign policy has been
demolished by LBJ’s sudden change of
course over Vietnam. He made an
unctuous announcement that he “will
observe a moratorium on any dis-
cussion of Vietnam so that the Presi-
dent of the United States can have
his hands free in what are delicate
negotiations.”
• Perhaps most damaging of all, Mr.
Nixon has also lost the one line in all
his perorations that always got applause,
his insistent demand for “new leader-
ship” has been snatched from him by
the presence in the election of three
new Democratic candidates.
Ironically, it is now Nixon who is
old hat, and the Democrats who seem
to offer the wind of change. As long
as he can maintain his position of
lonely eminence as the only announced,
serious Republican candidate, Nixon, of
course, is safe enough, at least for his
Party’s nomination. But as circum-
stances change, so do people’s minds.
Governor Nelson Rockefeller is widely
expected to announce within a week


or two that, whatever his previous
hesitations, he is now ready for the fray.
That by itself might not frighten
Nixon —it is too late for Rockefeller to
get into any primaries (except as a
write-in candidate). And anyway, given
the scars of 1964, he is probably the
easiest rival for Nixon to beat at a
Republican convention.
Far more disturbing to the Nixon
camp are persistent reports that Ron-
ald Reagan of California already
nominally entered in both Nebraska
and Oregon is also preparing to put
his armor on.
Few seriously believe that Reagan
could emerge as the national Republi-
can standard-bearer his actor’s smell
of grease-paint still sends shudders
down the spine of the Republican
eastern establishment but, like a
modern Warwick, he may well be pre-
pared to risk a primary battle or two
against Nixon in order to establish his
claim to be a king-maker.
’ If Reagan couldn’t put on the crown
himself, who would he give it to? The
most intriguing report last week was
of a deal between the Governor of
California and the Mayor of New York.
City. Publicly, Mayor John Lindsay
at 46 probably the hottest property
In American politics is maintaining
an impeccable disinterested front. It
would be hard for him to do anything
else,’ since Governor Rockefeller totally
controls the Republican Party in New
York State.
But privately the story is said to be
rather different. It is freely admitted
that until a month or so ago John Lind-
say never believed that 1968 could
possibly be his year for the White
House. But in the light of all that
has happened he is said recently to
have come to accept (almost reluct-
antly) that for him it may now be this
year or never.
Malaysia
No political
sex appeal
From HARVEY STOCKWIN,
in Kuala Lumpur.
THE ALL TOO. predictable course of
Malaysian politics has been disturbed
by the arrival of a new Party on the
scene. While it offers the twin hope
of a changed scene and less predicta-
bility, it is too early to forecast its
future, especially as both its arrival and
initial impact have been disappointing.
Essentially the ruling alliance be-
tween the United Malays Nationalist
Organisation, the Malaysian Chinese
Association, and the Malaysian Indian
Congress still dominates. The Alliance
may not have obtained freedom from
opposition like the People’s Action
Party Government of Singapore, but it
still retains a two-thirds majority cap-
able of constitution changing when
awkward issues such as separation of
Sarawak arise. The Labor Party obtains
its momentum from the Chinese
educated and a good deal of its in-
spiration from Chairman Mao. The
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party competes
with UMNO for the loyalty of the
crucial rural Malay vote but offers the
rural Malay no ideological prospect of
advancement.
The Partai Raayat on the other
hand offers ideological prospects but
obtains no loyalty. The Democratic
Action Party has taken over where
Tunku Abdul Rahman ... little to
fear from the new Malaysian Party
the PAP, pre-separation, left off, mis-
takes and all, which means, in effect,
that its organisation capacity and multi-
racial professions are directed almost
exclusively at the urban Chinese and
Indians. The People’s Progressive
Party remains the Seenivasagam broth-
ers, and most unlikely ever to expand
beyond the confines of the largely non-
Malay town of Ipoh.
In short as for the PAP in Singapore,
so for the Malaysian Alliance: no one
challenges it ,on its chosen central
ground. The Alliance performs the
not inconsiderable feat of not only
straddling the environmental emotional
gap between the urban Chinese and
Indians and the rural Malays (and
Chinese) but it also spans the
geographical political distance between
east and west Malaysia.
Hence the interest in the recent for-
mation of the Gerakan Rakyat
Malaysia or Malaysian People’s Move-
ment. While Gerakan offers no im-
mediate prospect of bridging these
gaps, it looks like straddling another —
the growing gulf between the people’s
hopes of opposition and the Opposition
Parties’ incapacity to meet such hopes.
Gerakan has several important fac-
tors going for it. First it gives Mister
Opposition himself Doctor Tan Chee
Koon a better forum for his free-
wheeling Christian Socialism than that
of being as previously the English-
educated mouthpiece for the Labor
Party. Secondly, it has reduced the
number of other Opposition Parties
by one since the Penang-based United
Democratic Party of widely respected
Doctor Lim Chong Eu was dissolved to
enter Gerakan.
Thirdly, Gerakan represents an im-
port breakthrough in that some leading
academics have forsaken their ivory
tower and some leading trade unionists
their neutrality in order to either spon-
sor or support it. The only catch is that
the former Professor Wang Gung Wu
leaves shortly to take up an academic
appointment in the Australian National
University while Professor Syed Hussein
Alatas works in Singapore University.
Last but not least, the inaugral Gera-
kan declaration hit at several Alliance
weaknesses and the new Party has got
off to a multi-racial start, aided con-
siderably by Doctor Tan Chee Koon’s
present pitch for increased pay for
religious teachers—a line that ought to
pay rural dividends.
Unhappily there is as much going
against Gerakan as going for. First and
last it has only kept the Opposition
ranks at the same numerical level when
politically there would seem no alter-
native but that they should be reduced.
The inaugural meeting last week in
Kuala Lumpur suggested strongly that
Gerakan’s promise was more in the eyes
of its beholders than in its own punch.
Over a thousand lower-, middle-, or
working-class Malaysians of all com-
munities turned up a big atten-
dance by KL standards eager to
get the message, anxious to be moved
by the movement. All they got was a
handout. The new Gerakan leaders
were so anxious to speak in all four
languages that they forgot their primary
task was to communicate, to send their
thousand-odd disciples away into the
coffee shops and toddy taverns with a
clear view of Malaysia Gerakan-stylc.
The main speech of the evening was a
flat dissertation by the new Party’s
Chairman, Professor Alatas, on Gera-
kan’s objectives. In the American idiom,,
the Party was for everything from
motherhood to apple pie. “That speech
sounded as if all the intellectuals
wanted to squeeze every concept they
held dear into it,” commented one of
the few purely middle-class witnesses.
“It was like a Victorian tea party full
of noble aspirations and polite obser-
vations.”
Not once during the meeting was the
audience roused, even though one could
sense arousal would not have been dif-
ficult even in English. An oppor-
tunity was missed. The hungry were
not fed. Political sex appeal was not
established. To be fair, Gerakan, in
accordance with the rules of guided
democracy, awaits registration as a
political Party, but on this showing the
Alliance Government need have no
fears in granting it. Not for the first
time the multi-racial but primarily
English-educated leadership of a new
Party in Asia had demonstrated how
far removed their class can be from
establishing rapport with the masses
for whom they would legislate and over
whom they presently preside.


STUDENT POWER
The angry young world
U.S.: Impassioned campus feeling is behind Eugene McCarthy
Germany: Serious riots over the shooting of a student leader
ALMOST ALL OYER the world,
wherever young men and women are
concentrated in halls of higher learn-
ing, there seems to be frustration and
anger and indignation, and a readiness
to quit their studies for the heady
pleasures of violence in the streets or
on the campus.
Few countries have escaped it. It
seems to be part of the life of nations,
like political crises and financial disas-
ters. It is as if there were a Students’
International at work, spreading the
word and the technique from Califor-
nia to Tokyo, to Manila, to Djakarta,
to Berlin, to Rome, to London even
to Sydney or Monash.
The only common denominator to all
this frenzied activity seems to be the
demand of the young for full parti-
cipation in the State and society. It is
a new Children’s Crusade, but far
more effective than that tragic pilgri-
mage to the East.
It has forced changes in universities.
It has affected politics, at least locally.
In South Korea it served to evict a
president. In Belgium it overthrew a
government. In Indonesia it drove
Sukarno, the Father of the country,
into obscurity, in Turkey it hurried
Premier Menderes to the gallows. Minis-
ters of government go among students
now at their own risk.
There is little positive in this world
wave of unrest which at times seems
to be simply against all authority. Such
positive generalisations as are made are
feeble cliches about international
understanding, love, tolerance, and
peace, and even these are expressed
with a ferocity that can turn into hate-
filled violence.
But on specific issues they are clear
enough. Students everywhere have the
time, the energy, the cohesion to act in
violent concert. Most of them are kept
poor enough to be angry without star-
ving. Their ivory towers are open now
to all the winds of the world. They
are symptoms of what is wrong in
various countries. They cannot wholly
be ignored, even if they are not wholly
surrendered to. They are one of the
great natural phenomena of our times.
In their protests against the general
set-up of a democratic-commercialist-
industrial State, American students
seem to have been the leaders, rebel-
ling against the successful if partial
manifestation in their country of their
great-great-grandfathers’ dreams, some-
times rebelling even against the very
basis of modernity its belief in
rationality. Sometimes they move back-
wards from intellectualism into a do-
it-yourself or do-it-with-drugs mysticism;
sometimes they move sideways into
romantic political enthusiasm (Castro,
Ho Chi Minh); some of them provide
new, vigorous impulses to American
political life.
No one can doubt that the threat
of total alienation in the universities
is very real. Great academic institutions
like Yale have publicly announced that
any student going to prison for his
refusal to be drafted will when he
is released from jail be restored to
his university place just as if he had
returned from Army service. Military
or even Central Intelligence Agency
recruiting has become virtually im-
possible on any campus. Indeed, many
university authorities, in the hope of
preventing violence, have formally taken
the step of banning it themselves. As
for members of President Johnson’s
Administration, they are reported to
have been advised not to risk appear-
ing before any university audience.
It is in this context that Senator
Eugene McCarthy’s moral victory in
New Hampshire had a special signifi-
cance. More emphatically than any
other election in history, the New
Hampshire contest was an example of
student power in action and in
action, what is more, within the estab-
lished political system. Thousands of
students poured into New Hampshire
during the final few weeks of Senator
McCarthy’s campaign. In one weekend
alone 13 busloads had to be turned
away because the student organisers
simply could not cope with them. They
came from colleges, large and small,
rich and poor, in defiance of the diktats
of the New Left, whose propagandists
had made it only too clear that Senator
McCarthy’s stand was at best an irrele-
vance and at worst a deliberate estab-
lishment .trap.
Nevertheless, the students set to work
in many cases probably almost;, as
an experiment; they wanted to test-
as °ne of them put it whether it
was really possible for “their system
to be made to respond to our de-
mands.” In the end, they found that
that could happen which perhaps
is the basic difference between Wash-
ington and Warsaw,
Is it also the difference between
Washington and West Berlin? The
German student movement now
setting the pace in riots and destruction
—was prompted originally by the
American example, but it has acquired
its own German undertones, coming
from distinctive student traditions, and
from the collapse into coalition govern-


ment of the two-party system in West
Germany; and with more emphasis on
power.
But what is the power to be over? As
'the tumultuous West German student
movement, committed to revolution and
Fidelismo, spills over the walls of the
universities into the nation at large,
this is a central question. Power over
their own universities? Professors elec-
ted by undergraduates? Or power over
the. political life of the whole nation?
The March congress in Munich of
the Union of German Students (VDS)
saw the conquest of this comprehensive
body by the revolutionaries. It also
saw the practical acceptance of the
idea of the “political mandate.” This
means the right of elected student
bodies to speak up and act, not only
on university matters grants, hostels,
and the rest but on the affairs of
the whole wide world.
The public attitude is ambiguous. On
the one hand, there is ferocious anti-
Communism, especially in Berlin
which detests the red flags and the
revolutionary passion. There are plenty
of those people, too, who shout about
“taxpayers’ money” and the student’s
duty to stick gratefully to his books. On
the other hand, the student though
expected to revere the godlike authority
of his professor - is also regarded
with awe himself, as an elite.
Germany, like the rest of Central
Europe, was brought late to nationhood
by the fanatical patriotism of two or
three generations of 19th-century
students, the Burschenscaften and
those who fought for the liberal uni-
fication of 1848. Bismarck gave Ger-
many its form as a State, the students
had already given it its soul. Thus, the
German public finds it hard to dis-
miss student claims to be once again
the political spearhead, the national
elite. A student is more than just a
boy or girl learning to be something,
and this old-fashioned, anti-technocratic
attitude which is both conservative and
humanist carries on into the extra-
ordinary German interpretation of
“academic freedom.”
In Germany, this does not mean only
intellectual freedom to teach and learn.
It means, quite precisely, the right to
stay at a university as long as you like
without being thrown out because you
fail examinations. It was West German
efforts to curtail this “freedom” to
introduce the more ruthless efficiency
which a modern technical society re-
quires which in large measures pro-
voked the present student movement.
Reversing neatly the conservatism of
the term, the Left-wingers defend the
old freedom as the bastion of “conscious
emancipation” against the “alienating
manipulation of late-capitalist bureau-
cracy.”
The movement began in West Berlin,
as an effort to gain better student rep-
resentation and to break down the
authoritarian principles of the profes-
sorship. But when the university and
city government reacted with alter-
nating panic and police repression, the
movement developed very rapidly
within two years into a general
offensive against “the power structure”
everywhere. After the riot of June 2,
1967, when the police ran wild, killing
one student and injuring scores more, a
wave of fanatical solidarity ran through
the whole student population. With a
wave of riots and demonstrations, the
movement showed that it had taken
firm root all over West Germany.
The core of the movement is a “New
Left” group, the German Socialist
Students’ League (SDS). For years a
mere sect, the SDS and its ideology
now guide and mould the thinking of
many thousands of students and sixth-
formers. It is a completely revolution-
ary theory directed against “bureau-
cracy” in East and West a clever
analysis of the “decay” of parliament-
ary democracy and the “manipulation
of opinion” in modern industrial
States. It believes in provocation, in
making so-called liberalism expose its
real nature power monopoly and
thought control.
The movement in West Germany
as hostile to “establishments” in Eastern
Europe as in West does not intend to
form itself into a Party. Its hope is to
form a spreading nucleus of “conscious-
ness,” an understanding of how one is
exploited, which will gradually convert
ever-wider circles of the more aware
working class. The centre of its hopes
for society in Germany is that this
passive people will be taught to manage
its own affairs at every level, through
systems of workers’ councils and voting
bodies, on the shop floor, on the cam-
pus, in every office, in every school-
room.
Meanwhile, turmoil that for six
months has swept through Italy’s
ancient universities, from northern Turin
to Palermo in the deep south, is still
gathering momentum, unchecked by
recent bloody clashes with police. It is
likely to go on doing so throughout
the coming weeks of campaigning for
national elections due in May.
“Reform or bust!” is the student cry,
and no one need be surprised if, after
the years of official promises, political
infighting, and neglect, Italy’s 400 r OOO
undergraduates are getting something
more than impatient. The campaign
for reform in the universities started its
latest season in November, and in
February students occupied not for
the first time the Rome Architectural
Faculty, stopping lessons, holding up
examinations. In the ensuing riot, 160
police and 50 students were injured by
the official count.
On, one point everyone now agrees:
reform is long overdue in Italy’s anti-
quated, overburdened, and inefficient
system of higher education. Based on
a 1933 law laid down by the Fascist
regime, the university set-up stands con-
demned by its dismal results., With
400,000 students attending 30 universi-
ties a small figure in a population
of 52 million the annual number of
graduates is only 30,000, or one in 13.
Rome: “Long Live Ho Chi Minh,” the
cry on the Via Veneto at the U.S.
Embassy. The issue of education reform
is also disrupting Italy’s universities
Nor is the standard of graduates satis-
factory, especially on the technological
and scientific sides. Shell Italiana’s
President, Signor Diego Gucciardi, re-
vealed recently that of 20,000 appli-
cants for. jobs at Shell’s new Taranto
factory almost all were totally unquali-
fied.
University teachers, on the whole,
support the students. But they are dis-
turbed and public sympathy is lost
by the way in which the so-called
“student power” leaders remorselessly
work irrelevant aspects of their Left-
wing politics into every university pro-
test. “Long live Ho Chi Minh!” cry
the marchers. “Hangman Johnson” read
the placards. Students occupying facul-
ties at Rome University have been
listening to taped speeches by Rap
Brown, the American “Black Power”
leader. It is one of the few U.S. imports
they can approve.
While in Germany specifically
student grievances burst out into
revolutionary programs for the world
and while in Italy student grievances
have been spiced with politics, although
not to the same extent, de Gaulle’s
France keeps such a tight hand on its
student population that current univer-
sity disturbances have a circumscribed
domestic look. Agitation is concentrated
in the halls of residence the cites
universitaires and its objects are
limited to winning a more relaxed
regime for the 15 percent of students
who live in them.
But beneath the precise demands an
urge for more control of their own
affairs, which they share with rebelling
students throughout the world, is swell-
ing. Public attention has been focused
on one student demand, to the neglect
of the rest of their platform: the de-
mand that girls and boys, who live in
separate blocks in the cites universi-
taires, should be allowed to visit each


other’s rooms freely. But the “no visi-
tors from outside” rule which in
some places extends even to relatives
is only one irksome aspect of the disci-
plinarian regime in the cites now pro-
voking frequent, occasionally violent,
opposition. Students are forbidden to
disseminate propaganda, political or
religious, in the cites; guest speakers,
meetings, and publicity are censored;
cultural activities are initiated from
above.
Where a French student lives and
where he learns are often far apart —
at least for those who manage to get
accommodation in a cite universitaire.
The cites tend to be built, where land
is available, on the outskirts of the
towns. The universities tend to be
established in the middle. As a result,
the cites are dormitory suburbs, often
in bleak, unattractive surroundings,
rather than campuses providing ameni-
ties for a self-sufficient community.
The most turbulent of them all is
Nanterre, set in a grim and shabby
industrial landscape outside Paris,
which is part residential, part faculty—
Britain: Roughing-up of Defence Minis-
ter Healey at Cambridge last month-
shocked middle-aged Britons. So did
anti-Vietnam mob violence which
spread to London’s West End
and whose library is not yet built.
Nanterre, with a student population of
1200, demonstrated against the “no
visitors” rule last Easter. In November
last year, there was a partial staff strike.
Last January, Nanterre students armed
with benches put to rout police who
were trying to break up a demonstra-
tion. Nanterre has a reputation for
vice prostitution, drug trafficking,
abortion and violence. But the most
significant feature of Nanterre is that
agitation always begins . in the new
faculty of Sociology, where staff and
students alike find government control
more oppressive than the traditional
disciplines do.
Unlike universities in Britain,
America, and Germany, French
universities have little autonomy. What
is taught and how the university is
administered, as well as how much
money is spent, are decided by the
Government. Wherever a student signs
on, he will meet the same curriculum,
teaching methods, and exercises. Under
the pressures of new knowledge, and of
the enormous expansion of the student
population now over 500,000 the
inflexibility of the French system is
felt to be intolerably cramping. Re-
forms are promised. But the French
students want some say in what the
reforms will be.
It may be significant that it is in
those West European countries
Holland and the Scandinavian countries
where there is the greatest acceptance
of material progress as an acceptable
human ideal that student revolt is least
significant.
Dutch students have a high place in
society, partly because they come from
the better-class homes, tend to avoid
extremism, and work hard to gain
the paper qualifications which are an
essential part of the Dutchman’s status
quotient. Only eight percent of them
come from working-class homes, com-
pared with about 25 percent in Britain.
The long period of study which they
undertake between five and seven
years means that the average student
is relatively mature, and has too much
to lose if he takes up his time with
demonstrations and student politics.
A group of students from Amsterdam
has been granted broadcasting time by
the Dutch Government, together with
substantial financial backing to set up a
radio and television university. The
initiative came from the students, not
from their professors. At the University
of Utrecht a group of students are
studying their professors’ lecturing tech-
niques and marking them accordingly.
The Government also listens seriously
to the National Student Committee's
complaints and advice on students’
grants, and is about to bring in new
legislation.
But the quiet period may be reaching
its end. In the elections last month for
the National Student Committee, the
Left-wing student group Vakverbond
won a majority. Their policy is much
more militant, and starts by rejecting
the whole of the Government’s educa-
tion program. It remains to be seen
whether they can use their power with-
out destroying their influence.
Scandinavian universities, which grew
up not so much as seats of learning as
institutes for training civil servants, have
handed down an authoritarian, or at
least a legalistic, turn of mind. And
since the political systems of the Scan-
dinavian countries have removed many
of the fundamental antagonisms, the
development of student power in the
forms displayed elsewhere has been
inhibited.
Opposition to authority has usually
taken a muted form with the professors
as the sole targets of protest. But this
time-honored conservatism of Scandin-
avian students has been partly under-
mined in the past few decades. Uni-
versities which used to be almost
exclusively middle-class now have
working-class students firmly en-
trenched. Their appearance has pro-
vided the raw material for a radical
turn in student politics, although it
is not the children of the workers who
have taken the initiative but the sons
and daughters of the bourgeoisie bene-
fiting from their presence.
But radical trends are masked by
the grand apathy of most Scandinavian
students. They are at university to
study, and their chief interest lies in
getting their degrees and finding suit-
able jobs, with occasional rests for
alcoholic and sexual refreshment. Stu-
dent politics depend for their existence
on a small, articulate, and generally
Leftish minority. It is they who dom-
inate Student Representative Councils,
and provide student opinions to the
general public. It is from them that
the modest degree of student unrest
has come, and it has taken the form of
demands for more say in the running
of the academic side of Scandinavian
universities.
But violence and demonstrations have
been absent. Discontent has been
minimised and concentrated into recog-
nised channels, for student democracy
has deep roots in Scandinavia.
In Britain the outbreaks of students,
their violence, and their endless
demands now arouse a bitter anger
in most middle-aged hearts. Here the
generation gap gapes as painfully as
anywhere else in our society.
Of course, there is nothing new in
student disorder. But it has changed
under the democratisation of the old
universities and the creation of new
ones. Before the war, the British uni-
versities were small, few, and domina-
ted by the privileged. Their disorders
tended to consist of hearty and good-
natured battles between hospital stu-
dents or else the tipsy and boring frolics
of the rich. The records of Oxford and
Cambridge are full of these “the
sound of the Upper Classes baying
for the sound of broken glasses.” They
were not thought worth any serious
newspaper attention.
But the national anti-Vietnam dem-
onstration in the West End of London,
on March 17, was something different.
It was student-inspired, and the spec-
tacle of a mob, ready and eager for
violence, running, and fighting the
police as if they were the students of
some banana republic, caused real dis-
gust and concern.
The situation differs from university
to university. All of them have student
unions, whose president is usually given
a year off study. He is elected, not on
a political basis but because he is a
good speaker, or efficient, or a nice
chap. Some of these, like the Union
President of Exeter University, just hap-
pen to be extremists.
The activists appear to be anti-
American and to prefer issues in which
it is possible to clobber the United


States. That is simply now the fashion-
able direction of protest. But, nonethe-
less, the real example for the present
behaviour, whether it be protest or
clothes or hair, came from California,
and a surprising number of American
students are prominent in the British
student actions.
In England, it really began two years
ago at the London School of Economics,
which has a strong tradition both of
high intelligence and radicalism. Very
few other universities in England have
escaped their sit-in, their strike, or their
demonstration.
The causes for which they act vary
widely from month to month. There
is a hard core, bent on the disruption
of society, who wall seize on any issue
at any time. The bomb is no longer a
visible issue, neither is disarmament.
Drugs, facilities for birth control, mental
health care, representation of students
on university bodies, the size of their
government grants, all have exercised
them. They do not care for the govern-
ment or institutions of Britain. They
care passionately about Vietnam.
Of course, the majority of students
are preoccupied with getting on with
their work, and with a good degree, as
the prize that offers a good job on the
side. But revolutions, even in the uni-
versities, are made by minorities.
One feels on more familiar ground
in Belgium, where simple old-fashioned
nationalism has prompted significant
student revolt. As a combination of two
disparate races, Belgium is itself a piece
of unfinished business left over from the
19th century, and its student revolts
last year might just as well have
occurred in 1867 as 1967.
The University of Louvain is an
ancient Catholic university in what is
now the Flemish-language sector of
Belgium. When the Flemings insisted
that its French-language department,
which has about 8000 of the 20,000
students, should move to a new univer-
sity in the French-language sector, the
French professors refused to go. This
caused the Flemish students to begin a
movement which eventually split the
Government and led to its downfall in
February.
The future of stable government in
Belgium, even of Belgium itself, now
appears to depend on student reaction.
In this sense Belgium students are
“Asian” rather than “European.” Their
struggles reflect struggles within the
community at large, whereas most of
the European and American student
revolts are struggles against the com-
munity.
In the same way there is familiarity
in the student movements of Spain,
which reflect the classic liberal image
of the freedom-loving students rebelling
against authoritarian governments.
Most of Spain’s student action takes
place at Madrid’s University City, on
the outskirts of the capital. It was
here a generation ago that most of the
severe fighting happened in the Civil
War. At times there is violence. The
students taunt the police and may hurl
bottles and stones. Standing by are
mounted police wearing plastic helmets;
their main armaments are riot-control
water-cannon trucks.
The police are not allowed into the
buildings the faculties of Philosophy
and Economic Science are the most
popular for assemblies without per-
mission of the Rector. So they charge
the students outside, using flexible
leather truncheons, which bruise but do
not seriously injure.
Spanish university students seem
surprisingly tranquil today. But this
comparative calm does not mean that
all is quiet on the university front.
The students are still demanding, as
they have for many years, the right to
form their own independent organisa-
tions as opposed to the State-sponsored
Sindicato Estudiantil Universitario
(SEU), which is the only legal body
recognised by the university authorities
and the Government. The demand for
an independent students’ union seems
reasonable enough, and has the sup-
port of many professors. But to the
Government of General Franco, this
seems to represent something of a threat
to his regime, because the official SEU
is part of the vertical trades union
structure created by the Falange, and
if the students succeed in getting their
independent union, then it is believed
many workers will demand the same
right.
A small hard core of Left-wing stud-
ents would like to show more solidarity
with the workers, but the workers show
little sign of wishing to co-operate with
these mainly middle-class, well-dressed,
and frequently car-owning amateur
revolutionaries. They are probably right,
for these disturbances have been going
on for a decade and more, and many
of those who shouted for liberty in 1955
are now professional men who are
respectable pillars of the establishment.
Are the insurgent students of War-
saw, the rebellious students of Prague
to be classed as part of the world-
wide army of young intellectual pro-
test? If there is a connection—and
one suspects that such a connection will
be glaringly obvious to the historian
of ideas in 20 years’ time it is hard
to find similarities on the surface. Only
the timing is in striking unison. As the
West Berlin students began their bitter
guerilla war with the city police, so the
universities of Poland and Czechoslo-
vakia came rapidly to the boil. But the
subjective ideas are very different.
In the West, the students or their
sophisticated leaders are warring
against a facade of liberal tolerance
in their societies behind . which lurk
policemen guarding moneybags. They
are Maoist, romantically intolerant,
dogmatic. In the East, the revolt is also
against authority, but in the name of
personal liberty and the rule of virtues
considered as traditionally liberal
free speech and Press, freedom of
assembly and combination.
The Polish students are rioting for
the second time in ten years. They
helped' in the months which preceded
and followed October, 1956, to break
down Stalinism and bring Mr. Gomulka
back to power committed, as they
thought, to new ventures in socialist
democracy. When they discovered their
mistake, that Mr. Gomulka was prac-
tical but highly disciplinarian, they
came into the streets. In October, 1957,
after the boldly independent magazine
“Po Prostu” was shut, the Warsaw
Polytechnic students collided with the
police and touched off four successive
nights of savage rioting.
Disillusionment followed. By the
early ’sixties observant Poles were
worried about the scepticism, the alien-
ation from adult society, of this genera-
tion. At the same time, it was clear
to these observers that this was also
the best-educated young Poland which
had ever existed. The regime’s huge
educational investments had paid off
vastly in sheer intelligence, quanti-
tatively, but not in political commit-
ment. It was a contradiction.
Gradually this dissociation began to
sour and ferment. Detachment turned
to a rather formless resentment. While
the Press sniped uncertainly at “jet sets”
who worshipped Western cars and
Belgium: Students at the famous Louvain University were active in riots which
brought down the Government of ex-Premier Paul Vanden Boeynants in February

records, two young lecturers at Warsaw
University produced a political mani-
festo which led to a first-class political
scandal and to their imprisonment.
Kuron and Modzelewski had sug-
gested an anti-authoritarian, slightly
anarchist form of society. In itself, this
vision did not make much impact, but
the sharp official reaction as so often
in Poland suddenly awakened public
interest. From a trough of indifference,
political activity began rapidly to rise,
especially at the Warsaw University.-
The Party and the internal security
organs tightened their grip on students.
This did not prevent the series of up-
heavals and public rows which followed
the dismissal from the Party of the
young and revisionist Professor Leszek
Kolakowski in late 1966. This, in turn,
led to the Michnik Affair, the harass-
ment of a student who had supported
Kolakowski and who with a small
group of friends had kept alive the
ideas of revisionist Socialism in the
university.
But even in early 1967, these rebels
were only a tiny group, heavily watched
over by the police, and very conscious
of their impotence in a campus where
students were under great political pres-
sure. Only the Middle East war, which
produced a crisis of confidence between
Government and a population which
was generally pro-Israeli, revived a de-
fiant climate in the universities. A
mere spark was needed. It came in
February, when the authorities shut
down a classic Polish play and then
expelled Michnik and a colleague for
demonstrating against the decision.
The astonishing solidarity with
Michnik and the others, provoking
thousands of students into Warsaw street
battles with the police, which became
a general student insurrection through-
out Poland, has not much to do with
the Kuron-Modzelewski program or its
successors. A petition of one Warsaw
college to the Parliament avoided
cloudy ideas like democracy by workers’
councils, and concentrated on concrete
complaints: the arrests, the police viol-
ence, the censorship, the breaches of the
citizens’ constitutional rights.
The Polish students, then, are asking
for greater democracy and legality
within the existing Socialist framework.
They are neither conservative nor Left-
revolutionary. The fact that many of
those politically active are of Jewish
extraction is adduced by the Polish
Press as proof that the unrest is a
Zionist-West German imperialist con-
spiracy. The evidence does not bear this
out. The accusation is relevant to cer-
tain intricate contests within the Party-
leadership, not to what Polish students
say and do.
The Czech students present a very
similar picture. We do not yet know
what the "results, the indirect results,
of the Polish riots on the Polish Gov-
ernment and Party will be only that
they will be profound. In Czechoslo-
vakia, these results are already to be
seen. Reforming Communists had been
preparing the ground for change for
years, when a major quarrel between


the writers’ union and the “conserva-
tives” around President Novotny took
place last summer. As in Warsaw, in
the case of the banned play, the troubles
of students and artists reacted together.
In October, the students marched on
Prague Castle in a demonstration
against lack of light and heat in hostels,
which was also a protest against Stalin-
ist methods and men at the top. The
scandal of this march, and the police
brutality which followed it, did much
to shatter the authority of the “con-
servatives” and make possible the vic-
tory of Mr. Alexander Dubcek and his
democrats at the January plenum.
As free speech now bursts out for
the first time in 20 years, the students
are still playing their part. Their de-
mands are radical but conventional:
they want free and secret elections
(they intend to put up their own candi-
dates) and a multi-party system. At
the same time, they are prudent enough
to obey messages from Mr. Dubcek to
stay off the streets, and keep their
sympathy for the Polish students within
bounds. Delighted with what has hap-
pened so far, they remain rather scep-
tical about the ability of a Communist
Party to run a genuine democracy.
A critical question in all student
insurrections is that of contact with
the working-class, the young worker.
In Poland, this has been lacking since
the great moments of 1956, and this
month the Government was able to
use armed workers against the
students.
In Prague, too, there is some mutual
lack of understanding, with older
workers fearing that “liberal” reforms
will cost them their jobs and resenting
students prating about mere intellectual
liberty. It is ironic that while Czech
intellectuals are now touring factories
ond urging workers successful!) to
join the movement for democracy, the
students have broken up the old unified
youth movement (Czechoslovak Social-
ist Youth) and are setting up a separate
student organisation on their own.
Immediate aims in East and West
contrast the one seeking constitu-
tional liberties, the other an anarchistic
system beyond “liberal democracy.”
But there are also profound similarities.
Both groups rebel against the over-
whelming power-bureaucracy of the
modern State in East and West. Both
feel that these States have drugged the
working-class through mass media so
effectively that it cannot be counted on
as an ally. Both call themselves
Japan (left): Youth protests have
become as traditional as many
other things in Japan. Indonesia
(top): The fall of Sukarno was
hastened by young militants. Pub-
lic corruption has been a more
recent target. Vietnam (top right):
Election-rigging charges were the
occasion for this march through
Saigon. Korea (right): More of the
old give and take—in Seoul
socialist, and both believe in the mission
of the young intellectual —in this
situation as the midwife of history.
Russia? Students rarely hit the head-
lines with public manifestations and
demonstrations, but within the con-
fines of their own institutions they are
known to be assertive. In private they
are far more sceptical of the world
around them than they are given credit
for. But experience handed down
through generations of students born
into an authoritarian society has driven
them to disciplines and subtleties to gain
their ends.
It is important to distinguish among
the large mass of Soviet students. One
category of difference is between the
science and technology students, and
the students in the humanities faculties.
Another important difference is between
the rural students, who flock to the big
universities on scholarships, and the
students brought up in cities and indus-
trial towns.
As a rule, the science and technology
students are bolder and more demand-
ing, as well as prone to public mani-
festation of their discontent. Their sec-
urity of jobs and livelihood is not so
affected by participation in rebellious-
ness. The humanities students are in a
more sensitive position. They are dis-
pensable. Involvement in any kind of
disapproved activity may seriously
affect future jobs, their chance to travel
abroad, and promotion,
Students from a rural background are
less sophisticated and more conserva-
tive than urban students, and so are
naturally inclined to keep well within
bounds of permissible behaviour,
There is no broad ideological moti-
vation among Soviet students. What
affects them most, and rouses their ire,
are the poor material conditions and
petty restrictions. Most college students
live rather poorly, since their grants are
small, although tuition, books, and lodg-
ing are free. They get only about 30
to 40 roubles per month, which will
barely pay for adequate food,
Russian students are either dependent
on their parents to make both ends
meet or have to undertake supple-
mentary jobs to see them through
their course. Poor living conditions, lack
of proper food and recreational facili-
ties ruin the health of many by the
time they have completed their higher
education. They get into what the
authorities consider mischief, out of
sheer boredom more than anything
else.
One of the most popular and potent
forms of student protest in Soviet
institutions is the wall paper. It is
through these wall papers that students
pour out their discontent, satire, and
anger. -Wall papers are eagerly scanned
and when excitement runs high among
the students the papers change rapidly
throughout the day. But it would be
misleading to believe that, infected by

Union, or goaded by their own frus-
trations, Russian students will take to
the streets.
Contrary to the world trend in
student rebellion, counter-revolution is
at work in the universities of Latin
America. Student power has been exer-
cised long enough and some would
say irresponsibly enough to produce
an establishment backlash from Buenos
Aires to Santo Domingo.
Throughout Latin America students
are being tamed by troops and police.
In Santo Domingo
and Panama,
students long ago
resorted to arms. An
abortive guerilla up-
rising sprang out of
the University of
San Marcos, in
Lima, the oldest
university in the
southern hemis-
phere. Students
have even brought
down governments.
The future of
student power, how-
ever, is now being
decided in the more
stable South Ameri-
can S'tates.
In Arg e n tina,
where a military coup d’etat was
helped along by the provocation of
student nets, counter-revolution has
scored its biggest success. Within a
month of the June 28, 1966, revolu-
tion, the military government headed
by General Juan Carlos Ongania had
taken over Argentina’s ten State uni-
versities. Student participation in tri-
partite government was abolished. Stu-
dents are forbidden to discuss politics
unless carefully chosen text-books
touch on the subject. Student organisa-
tions have also been prohibited and,
after a year with armed police out-
sie the faculties, and plainclothes
police spies in the lecture halls, Presi-
dent Ongania is able to announce that
he has restored order.
The same sort of government
authority over the traditionally inde-
pendent universities has been estab-
lished in Brazil, although the national
character and the less authoritarian
regime of General Costa y Silva have
seen that it is less rigid. All this has
come about partly because of the
breakdown of democracy in Argentina
and Brazil. When the soldiers take
over, years of. resentment toward the
students is quickly manifested.
Today most Latin-American govern-
ments identify students with Com-
munism. It was the excuse used by
the military regime to send in police
to beat students and professors into
submission in Argentina. Public
opinion, outraged by student violence,
supported the crackdown.
Student power in politics became
manifested because a voting age of
18 ensures that a university is a politi-
cal stronghold. But the advent of
authoritarian governments even the
progressive President Frei of Chile has
a dictatorial manner has seen a
movement to strip the students of their
influence.
The student revolts of Asia reflect
some of the same differences in impulse
and function as do the student move-
ments of Europe. They have helped
topple governments. They have pro-
tested about fees.
There has been a particularly heroic
quality in the students of Indonesia.
Their entry into the anti-Sukarno cam-
Australia: As with many of the vogues their elders adopt, Australian students’
protests are mainly slavish to overseas fashions
paign provided that disturbance in the
streets that assists in the unsettling of a
tyrant, a function in which students
now seem to play the role once given
to the city mob, or the rising proletariat.
In Saigon the anti-Diem student move-
ments showed considerable sophistica-
tion; they co-operated with the
Buddhists up to a certain point, and
then gave them away when their in-
terests diverged. In Seoul, a monument
now commemorates the student demon-
strations that helped overthrow Syng-
man Rhee.
There have, however, been special
concerns in Asian student movements
t h a t be meaningless in Europe.
of t h ese a notable example is the par-
ticular consideration usually given to
rural reform and village life. In Indo-
nesia some of the most enlightened
student leaders have been attempting to
turn the KAMI movement, first thrown
U p as a weapon against Sukarno, into
a movement that might assist in rural
regeneration. This is part of a more
general concern with living standards
f or ordinary people, understandable
enough in communities whose problems
are no t a ffluence, but privation, and
sometimes starvation. It can often
extend to demands for stable govern-
ment (less corruption, less inflation)
that would be unimaginable to the
students of Berkeley or Berlin. While
liberalism and rationality are sometimes
now despised in America and parts of
Europe, to many Asian students these
constitute their principal hope for the
future.
Asian universities are not without
their unrest on purely university mat-
ters. Understandably so. Lack of books,
lack of teachers, lack of dormitory
accommodation, and other material
deprivations can reach a degree that
makes the protests of European students
seem mere petulance.
They are weaker, however, in anti-
Vietnam demonstrations, partly because
they have more to demonstrate about
at home. Anti-Americanism is usually
most evident where Americans are most
evident: overtly in Manila, covertly in
Bangkok.
It is only in Japan that the full
range of demonstrations regularly
occurs. Not unexpectedly, Tokyo can
boast examples of
demonstra-
tions against every-
thing European and
Asian students have
demonstrated
against.
As elsewhere, to
the active students
themselves the real
problem seems not
too much protest
but too little. Even
at the time when
students in Djakarta
were risking their
lives in demonstrat-
ing against Sukarno,
one of the real
problems of their
leaders was what
they should do about student apathy,

avia, hoi such rebellion as there is,
as wltE ot^er vogues, overseas trends
set pace. Predictably, when the
Committee for Nuclear Disarmament
was active in Britain, there were small
CND movements in Australia; when
Maoism and Castroism became fashion-
able in America they also became
fashionable among small groups in Aus-
trajia, but although they have caused
some disturbance in student newspapers
they have not caused much disturbance
in the streets. There has been practi-
cally no concern with distinctively Aus-
tralian issues, the principal exception
being the immigration reform protest
of the early 19605, which seemed to
fizzle out when Vietnam teach-ins were
imported from abroad,
As in Britain, the tradition of student
demonstration was more in the line of
the rowdyism of gilded youth than in
effective political action, or heroic
despair, although it has also been
“political” at least since Sydney’s
Margaret Street, demonstrations against
Dutch policy in Indonesia in the
19405. However, the most effective
demonstration of student power in Aus-
tralia remains the Parramatta Road
demonstration outside Sydney univer-
sity in the 1950 s when students lay
down on the road and demanded
traffic lights. They got the traffic
lights.


Eyes and options open
By SANDRA HALL
THE MOST FREQUENTLY heard
versions of a Pommie’s Adventures in
Lotusland are not happy ones. Stricken,
as we seem to be, by national self-
doubt, we seize on every opinion damn-
ing our weather or our food, chiding
us for our lack of hospitality, or writing
Australia off as a cultural desert.
However, the immigrants with the
most interesting things to say are not
necessarily those most often heard. The
people I spoke to here are among the
luckier ones, since they have skills,
which meant the business of finding
a job was not a serious problem. They
have moved about a bit before, so the
shock of a new country was not so
great as it seems to be for the general
run of immigrants. In many ways their
attitude seems remarkably like those
of many Australians on the move: eyes
and options open.
But they still have criticisms they
feel it would denote a cabbage-like
disposition if they did not and they
feel they have the right to air them,
since they are living here.
In London, Jeremy Johnston was one
of many ambitious young insurance
brokers at Lloyds whose promotion was
assured at some unspecific, and
probably far-distant, time in the future.
His solution was South Africa, where
he knew Lloyds had an office, but he
made only half-hearted attempts at a
transfer, and thought little about the
idea, until he discovered the firm had
connections in Australia, and he de-
cided to emigrate. “My friends were a
Jeremy Johnston ... social life is
better
load of sceptics in fact, my landlady
was convinced I’d be back.
“My parents were a bit sad my
mother shrugged her shoulders and just
accepted it, but my father said if he
were a young man he’d have done the
same.”
For the first two weeks in Sydney
he was lonely. After that he was too
busy ever to think about it again. He
found that the structure of the insurance
business in Australia makes brokerage
a more competitive field than in Eng-
land, and without the feelings of
anonymity which had frustrated his
ambitions at Lloyds, he was more in-
clined to increase his efforts.
Yet, paradoxically, he doesn’t find
it’s any easier to save money here.
(“Accommodation, for one thing, is
pretty expensive.”)
“But then, social life —• except for
the pubs is better. When I got here
I had mostly English contacts, and I
shared a flat with a very sociable
Englishman with lots of Australian
friends.
“After about two months we gave a
party for about 40 people, all of whom
I knew by then, so it didn’t take me
very long to meet Australians. Then,
of course, I’m marrying an Australian
girl, but I think I’d decided to stay
even before I met her because of
my career and because I like the climate
so much.
“I’ll retain my British nationality,
though a certain pride, I suppose.
Brenda Powell . .. dismayed by political
apathy
If it were possible I’d like to go back
to England every four years or so.”
On the debit side, Jeremy is amazed
at Australians’ political apathy (“the
last State election generated about as
much interest as a city council election
at home”), and about snobbery here.
“I think, if anything, the snob thing
is worse than in England. For one
thing, what school you went to matters
a lot loyalty to schools is far greater
here, seems ‘to linger on, perhaps be-
cause Australian men are all schoolboys
at heart.”
Brenda Powell is the wife of Gareth
Powell, the Welsh publisher who settled
in Australia a year ago, after, selling
his business interests in England in
order to start afresh here.
“The British climate was one of the
main reasons for us leaving,” she says.
“We have two children and one of them
suffers from bronchitis, so we knew we’d
have to take him somewhere else
eventually.
“But as well as that, Gareth was
bored and wanted to try something new
and I didn’t like the thought of staying
in London, in one place, for the rest
of our lives, either. Canada seemed too
cold to consider, so Australia was the
logical place.”
Gareth Powell had visited Australia
the year before, but Brenda was seeing
the country for the first time when
they arrived in Sydney last autumn.
“I had ail the usual fears about going
so far. My mother is a widow and I
didn’t like the idea of leaving her alone.
And it’s always taken me a long time
to make friends, wherever I am.
“It was very bad for a week, but I
found I was only missing the little
things two-storey houses, papers
delivered through the door ... We
stayed in a motel for the first week,
then took a furnished house at Glades-
ville. No, houses aren’t hard to find
if you’re prepared to spend enough
money.”
Powell has formed a company which
publishes two magazines and has
brought out several books in the past
year. And Brenda, who worked as an
editor in publishing houses in London,
helps in its administration. “There’s no
lack of talent here,” she said. “There
is less competition, of course, but that
works both ways, because the small
population means that money for
everything is spread more thinly, so
it’s not automatically easy to get on.”
The abrupt change in hemispheres
hasn’t bothered her (“the emphasis is
shifting from Europe to South-East
Asia”), but just as Jeremy Johnston is
dismayed by political apathy here, she
finds it hard to become absorbed in


Australian politics. “It’s difficult to sort
out the State and Federal Governments,
but more important than that, I’m a
Socialist, and there’s no Socialist Party
here.”
Kathy Hollow was a neighbor of
Brenda Powell’s in England, and had
similar reasons for leaving; the health
of one of her children, the daunting
prospect of spending the rest of her
life in the same house in the same
street. When her husband, who works
for a travel firm, was offered the oppor-
tunity to work in Australia they
decided to emigrate.
And predictably, in the first week
after their arrival in Sydney several
months ago, she wished they hadn’t.
“It was pouring rain and I felt like
going straight back. We stayed in a
private hotel until we found a house
which to us seemed dear. It may not be,
because people seem to live better and
eat better here than they do in England.
“But education is certainly more ex-
Kathy Hollow . .. education is more
expensive
pensive here. In State schools in
England, everything, down to each
piece of equipment, is provided by the
Government. There are no fund-raising
P. and C. committees as there are
here, and there seems to be less con-
formity in British schools. Children are
allowed to work at their own pace.
“When I first put my son into school
here, the headmistress told me he would
have to change the way he did his
maths, because they worked down the
page here. To me, it didn’t seem to
matter very much which way they set
it out. Then I saw her a few weeks
later, and she told me the system had
been changed since she’d last seen me.
They were now working across the
page.
“That kind of conformity worries
me although my son seems happy
enough now he’s settled in."
Brian Adams is 22 one of the
young Britons who, each year, set off
on the English version of the overseas
working holiday. He spent three months
travelling overland, hitch - hiking
through Europe and Asia, and choosing
to come on to Australia because of the
lure of higher wages.
His is a “no strings” look at the
country, unaffected as he is by family
commitments or any driving, necessity
to make good here because of disil-
lusionment with England.
“I’ve wanted to travel since I left
school,” he says. “But my father said
get a job first, so I worked in a bank
until I was ready to leave England."
Young Britons may not yet have quite
as much enthusiasm about the overseas
working holiday as their Australian
counterparts, but “The Times" personal
column is always full of advertisements
placed by young people looking for
others to share costs in a car trip across
Europe, through the Middle East to
India, and the agencies which run bus
trips across the same routes are well
patronised.
Other people take jobs in Hong Kong
or Bangkok, some go on to Canada and
the United States, but probably most
head toward Australia once money
starts to run low. Brian is working for
a Sydney finance company and "earning
a lot more than I would be at home.”
“Banking in Britain is very stuffy.
Wages are graduated, whereas in the
job I have here, you negotiate your
own salary. In England, somebody
might be doing a much more respon-
sible job than somebody else, but if he
hasn’t been in the bank as long, he
won’t be earning as much.
“You seem to get promoted faster
here. I find it’s not so regimented,
either. As long as the work gets done,
it’s all right, and you can dress more
casually at work, which means there’s a
better atmosphere in the office. It’s
easier to get to know the people you
work with here.”
Brian has experienced no “anti-
Pommie” reactions, although he has
met some Australians who have been
happily harboring the cliche image of
the Englishman as a creature habitually
outfitted in pin-stripe and bowler.
One thing which has surprised him,
and other English people, is our system
of State Government. “It’s so parochial.
And there’s this N.S.W. v. Victoria
feeling. I was with some people when
the America’s Cup was being run last
year, and we were talking about Dame
Pattie’s chances in the race. And some-
body said ‘they’re not Australians in
that crew; they come from Victoria.’ ”
On the other hand, he has found
Australians united in their dedication
to the national preoccupation—gambl-
ing. “In England, the working classes
and the very rich gamble. Here, every-
body does whether it’s the lottery
ticket, the races, or the poker machines.
Sure, we have the pools in England,
but I think something like the Opera
House lottery would be harder to fill
there.”
Brian has been here a little more than
a year, “and despite my criticisms, I’ve
enjoyed it here more than I have any-
where else before. Partly because of the
outdoor life, I suppose . . . it’s just so
easy to have a good time here.”
As 22-year-old Heather Woodgates
sees them, the temptations of the good
life Australian-style have their dangers,
too.
“I think that because of this free-
and-easy life, Australians are not a deep-
thinking people,” she says. “There is
so much enjoyment here that people
don’t seem to look very deeply into
anything. There could be more concern
for Asia, for instance at least a
limited immigration policy. And so
little seems to be done for the Abo-
rigines."
Heather, who left England for the
same reasons as Brian a desire to
see something more of the world than
Britain and the parts of the Continent
she could take in on her annual holiday
worked in Bangkok for a year before
coming to Australia.
“1 wanted to see what it was like
here people in Bangkok told me
about Australia and about English
people they knew living in Sydney. So
I took a ship from Hong Kong via
Japan and met Australians on the
ship who impressed me with their hos-
pitality and friendliness.”
A secretary, she waited around for
some time to find the right job with
the right salary, and believes women
have a decidedly tougher time job-
hunting here than men do. “Australia
is very much a man’s country women
are definitely number two. In Brisbane,
I went to the races, and was appalled
to see that the men have a whole stand
to themselves from which women are
barred.”
Like so many people of her age,
Heather is fascinated by Asia, and for
her Australia’s limitations lie in its
similarities to England, rather than its
differences.
“Perhaps it’s partly the fact that we,
as Westerners, stand out so much as
being different in the Eastern countries.
And if this is so, I suppose we get
inflated ideas about ourselves. But if
we’re aw'are of this, I don’t think it can
be harmful. And it’s certainly more
stimulating. Here, with the same langu-
age, the same culture, you don’t feel
very far from England.”
So there it is, Australia is many
things to many people a halfway
house, a new chance, a comfortable life,
but not everybody’s vision of Utopia.
The secret seems to be in deciding
whether it can satisfy one’s particular
dream. Perhaps Australia House should
exchange its posters for a few more
questions and answers.


Meanwhile, back in Europe
By CLAIRE STERLING
IN A LITTLE more than a year the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation will
have lived out the 20 years of its
initial contract, and ir looks now as if
none of the 15 member States, not
even France, will withdraw when the
time is up. So NATO, supposed to
have been on its last legs long ago,
will doubtless be with us through the
19705.
A great deal of NATO’s underpin-
ning has crumbled during the past
12 months in particular. France’s
five divisions and air force have been
detached from its integrated military
command and NATO's own head-
quarters and installations removed
from French soil. Its southern flank,
once safe under the U.S. Sixth Fleet's
protection, has suddenly come within
close range of an imposing Soviet
fleet cruising permanently in Medi-
terranean waters. Soviet influence has
leaped upward on the Mediterranean's
eastern and southern shores.
At least 50,000 American, British.
French. and Belgian troops are
scheduled to leave West Germany this
year.
It was during these same 12 months
that NATO went through a lengthy
self-examination, known as the Kar-
in el Exercise, to brace itself for the
incoming decade. The Harmel Report,
approved at the December Council of
Ministers meeting, wasn’t altogether
the flop it was said to be. It committed
the alliance to active pursuit of detente
in Europe, a one-sided game so long
as the Russians aren't playing, but
popular among Western Europeans all
the same. It involved France in a long-
term political engagement to NATO
when all hope for that seemed lost. And
it introduced NATO’s first important
change in strategic thinking since 1956.
Yet the new strategy of flexible nuclear
response creates more problems than it
solves, and the most tormenting of
NATO’s other problems were fudged
in the report or left out.
Not a word was said, because no
agreement was possible, about the
growing inadequacy of NATO’s military
forces as a convincing deterrent a
situation worsened by the shift to a
strategy relying much more heavily on
conventional ground forces that NATO
doesn't have and couldn't conceivably
muster. Also, the French withdrawal has
cut the alliance territorially in two.
necessitating monthly petitions by the
allies for permission to fly over France.
Ground transit via France, say for Ital-
ian troops moving north and circum-
venting neutral Switzerland and Austria,
is flatly refused. Nothing was proposed
NATO headquarters in Brussels
to counter the accelerated encirclement,
of NATO’s territory, militarily and
politically, by growing Soviet power.
Nor was there a hint of the quarrels
dividing the European members, of
their deteriorating relations with the
Lnited States, or of their rising sus-
picions that America is gradually dis-
engaging from Europe.
There was a time when 704(1
tactical nuclear warheads in Western
Europe, backed by America's entire
thermonuclear arsenal, would have been
a formidable deterrent. But that was
before Russia acquired an equal ability
to devastate Europe and, for that
matter, America. Inasmuch as nobody
has really believed since then that Russia
and the United States would deliber-
ately destroy themselves by actually
using these weapons against each other,
NAT O s stockpile can only deter the
kind of war in Europe that noboch
believes is going to happen. There
remains the other kind of war, however,
which before \ ietnam nobody thought
could happen in the Atomic Age, either.
Under several imaginable if still distant
circumstances, the nuclear stalemate
would not necessarily prevent a eon-
ventional military incursion into some
part of Western Europe, and might even
invite one, because NATO so plainly
couldn't stop it. In short, the alliance is
likely to prove adequate only as long
as it is not put to the test.
It is not certain, for all the fright
talk in some circles, that Russian hordes
could overrun the Continent in a day.
They might need a week. This in no
way reflects on the valor or competence
of NATO's military command —it
can't make bricks without straw. The
force goals it has set as the minimum
needed for Western Europe’s defence
have never been met: troop levels are
at present about 25 percent below the
minimum, and dropping.
Some NATO officers have pointed
out to me, not without some embarrass-
ment, that the allies' combined armed
forces, including America’s at home and
in the Far East, outnumber the Warsaw
Pact's. But in terms of actual ability to
produce these troops, the comparison
in fact comes out like this: NATO’s
European Command has 24 divisions in
West Germany, 32 elsewhere in Europe,
and 30 more in reserve on the Conti-
nent. The Soviet Union, with a stand-
ing army of 140 divisions, has 20 in
East Germany alongside six of the
German Democratic Republic's, six
more in other Eastern European States,
and 44 others in a position to reach
the German front within a month, while
its partners in the Warsaw Pact have an
additional 63.
There are differences in combat-
readiness, size, and equipment: the Red
Army’s divisions are about a third
smaller than NATO’s, for instance, but
roughly equal in conventional firepower.
All in all, however, NATO would need
six more divisions in West Germany
for an adequate defence against limited
conventional attack, and 34 more in
the event of all-out invasion. Instead,
50,000 NATO troops are about to leave
West Germany. The strategy of massive
retaliation that the Council discarded
meant using the largest available
strategic nuclear weapons as soon as
possible. The strategy of flexible re-
sponse adopted by the Council means
using the smallest available tactical
nuclear weapons as late as possible. In
the first case, conventional ground forces
would simply have to hold the line
against an attack for a day or two, if
that, whereupon an atomic holocaust
would settle the matter one way or
another. In the second case, these forces
would have to hold for weeks or more,
while international statesmen pondered
the holocaust's pros and cons.
I he change, first proposed by Secre-


tary McNamara in 1962, is sensible in
several ways. In the early 19505, the
European allies’ worst fear was that
the United States might use its nuclear
weapons at the first sound of a shot.
In the late 19605, the fear is that the
United States might be all too visibly
unwilling to use them at all.
There may be an element of mac-
abre irony in the idea of drawing up
new ground rules so that war can be-
come a normal human occupation again.
But the Russians evidently take that
for granted already. According to
Britain’s respected Institute for Strategic
StudieSj the Soviet Army’s military
doctrines “still envisage a major offen-
sive role for it in future war and
accordingly emphasise training for
large-scale advance at high speed. In-
fantry formations contain covered
Armored Personnel Carriers, which
would enable them to advance across
radioactive terrain. But in the past
year or two, increasing emphasis has
been given to preparing the Soviet
theatre forces in both a conventional
and a nuclear environment.”
Yet there are obvious flaws in
man military commentator Adalbert
Weinstein has said. "The acceptance

NATO States will therefore be unable

NATO’s new strategy, the biggest being
that without a major build-up in con-
ventional forces it cannot work. Safe
in the knowledge that they would have
days or weeks to move with no atomic
risk and comparatively little opposition,
the Russians might logically be tempted
to try or, more characteristically,
get some tractable friends of theirs to
try a probe here or there, say in
troubled Greece, or remote Norway, or
isolated West Berlin, defended merely
by a handful of NATO brigades,
whereupon they could offer to negotiate.
It is most unlikely that the European
allies (or the United States) would
then prefer to dislodge them by em-
ploying even small “tac-nukes” to
use the going term here similar in
destructive power to the bombs dropped
on japan.
The West Germans, first' in line for
Occupation or devastation, are sending
out cries of anguish. “NATO . . .
after living in 3 sort of strategic twi-
light . . . can no longer be said to
have a strategy,” the distinguished Ger-
and even to 12 in the case of Belgium,
Norway, and Denmark. Several are
also cutting the size of their ground
forces, notably France and Belgium,
the latter by a third (though the
Belgians say this reduction will in-
crease their efficiency).
It is no wonder, then, that NATO
should be eager for a detente, especi-
ally in the form of balanced mutual
force reductions and partial disarma-
ment.. Such proposals are getting no-
where so far, partly because the Soviet
Union wouldn’t care , to be accused of
releasing U.S. forces and equipment
for Vietnam, and partly because NATO
is sure to make the reductions unilat-
erally, anyway. Should the Soviets
change their minds some day, however,
their side would be well ahead. No
Warsaw Pact country except Rumania
has reduced its minimum two-year per-
iod of compulsory military service or
the size of its forces, and a number
have raised their defence budgets sub-
stantially for 1968: the Soviet Union
with NATO’s; and that the Continent,
whose security is synonymous with
America’s, has been insulated against
war for two decades. In dozens of talks
with representatives of NATO countries
here, I found many despondent about
the future of this aging alliance, but
none, the French included, who would
like to ace tbe future without it.
While Americans have long resented
the failure of a now-prosperous Europe
to shoulder a larger part of the Atlantic
defence burden, U.S. policy hasn t
always advanced that cause. For years
America has been selling an annual
5 1 billion worth of armaments to
NATO’s European members, _ calculat-
inS on capturing a fifth of their market
to help “neutralise” the foreign-exchange
costs of her troops overseas Naturally,
the Europeans would much prefer to
make more of these things themselves
and America ought to be cheering them
on, since every advance in their industry
an d technology helps them hold their
end up in the alliance. But their efforts
have been perpetually frustrated, and

Whatever they say openly, most allied
leaders have from the start seen the
proposed non-proliferation treaty as a
device to protect the U.S. lead in
peacetime atomic-energy industries by
suffocating Western Europe’s thus,
in the Atomic Age, finally reducing
Europe to what Prime Minister Harold
Wilson has called industrial helotry.
They have not changed their minds
since, on their mutinous insistence, the
treaty’s inspection clauses were recently
revised. Italians in the know, for in-
stance, are convinced that even the new
draft would kill off their atomic-
powered shipbuilding project, Italy’s
one really promising undertaking in the
field. They are so sure of it that a
group of the country’s biggest indus-
trialists have made imperious represen-
tations to the Government demanding
rejection of the agreement.
To their way of thinking, the non-
Conference chamber at NATO headquarters
proliferation treaty is an unpleasant
foretaste of times to come, when the
United States and the Soviet Union
will have formed a partnership over
their heads. They may be looking
rather far ahead, since Russia is
plainly determined to improve its
position considerably before striking
the bargain. But where would Europe
be by then? If there is any truth in
Herman Kahn’s spectacular predictions
for the year 2000 (not to mention J.-J.
Servan-Schreiber’s “Le Defi Ameri-
cain”), Western Europe would be hope-
lessly behind the United States Indus-
tnally. Its military condition is weaken-
mg progressively and unavoidably. Both
considerations must affect it politically.
Not everybody on the western side of
the Continent is disposed to leave his
fate in American hands under these
circumstances until the day comes for
a new Yalta Agreement. Some may
choose to make their own agreement,
and sooner.
Speaking of this possibility before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee in
1966, Dean Acheson noted only the one
advanced in Paris, i.e., that “The Euro-
pean nuclear powers, that is, the old
Triple Entente Russia, France, and
Britain could reach an accommo-
dation leading toward a solution to the
problem of Central Europe and the
division of Germany (on the) inherent
assumption that Germany would accept
a neutralised status without foreign
troops or nuclear weapons on her ter-
ritory.” There is also the possibility of
the Germans making arrangement for
themselves, more remote in 1966 than
it appears today.
People who find this hard to believe
should talk with the Germans these days
not only in Bonn or NATO headquar-
ters but in Berlin. Those I saw there,
when I stopped by on my way to Brus-
sels, were mostly the university students
whose revolt against the generation in
power has been shaking the Germany
Adenauer built to its foundations. They
have none of their parents’ illusions
about the ability (or burning desire)
of the United States (or France, or the
rest of Western Europe) to reunite the
two Germanys. Neither can they see
much merit in a NATO shield con-
sisting of fewer and fewer troops armed
with U.S.-owned and controlled nuc-
iear weapons which, if used at all in
the strategy of flexible response would
probably make a mass cemetery of
Berlin and most of West Ger^
before its NATO allies decided which
way to jump. What’s more, they realise
that Walter Ulbricht’s Wall is working
in the sense that the Germans on the
opposite side, resigned to their fate at

Meanwhile, back in Europe
last, are applying their energies to live
more decently.
The determined assault of the stu-
dents may not change Bonn’s policies,
but it is adding greatly to Bonn’s
miseries. The gloom is thick in the
offices of Germany’s mission to NATO,
where representatives of the country
most in need of Western solidarity and
reassurance are too troubled to keep
a smiling diplomatic face. “We will,
of course, do our best to make a suc-
cess of NATO’s strategic planning, and
to assist the United States in its present
difficulties,” one of them told me. “We
must also take the United States
Government’s word that its commit-
ment to NATO and to us is as firm
as ever. But America’s financial worries
won't be over tomorrow and her re-
sponsibilities are global. We know how
probable it is that if American troops
don’t go now, they’ll go in a year or
two or three, naturally with a promise
to return in an emergency. By the
19705, we’ll no longer have flexible re-
sponse but the Big Lift. Let’s be frank:
we may all still be here then, in this
fine building with our superb new'
telecommunications system and our
splendid maps on the wall and our
scenarios for military exercises. But
there will be no NATO.”
Maybe there w ould be a Pax Atomica,
anyway, guaranteed simply by Russia’s
awareness of America’s huge stakes
in Europe and a common instinct for
survival. Meanwhile, however, America
would be leaving Europe to drift back
toward that prewar “diffusion of will
which must emerge from a congeries
of small to medium-size nations,’’ as
Dean Acheson also observed in 1966.
It would be nice to know which of
these nations might end up on whose
side of the Pax in that event, Ger-
many above all. Despite French claims
to Continental leadership, it is the
Germans, mightier by far in industrial
strength, who hold the key to the
Continent. While the Americans have
held the key to Germany since World
War 11, its rising generation may
change the lock.
As things stand, NATO hasn’t the
slightest prospect of building up con-
ventional forces. Relatively few' Western
Europeans think that the Soviet Union
still has sinister designs on them; if
there is a consensus among them about
anything, it is that the Pax Atomica has
long since effectively removed their
continent from the superpowers’ contest
for world supremacy. Some, perturbed
by the Soviet Union’s evident lack of
interest in a general European settle-
ment and its new truculent posture on
Europe’s southern flank, are beginning
to reconsider. But not a single allied
government today is in a political
position to spend an extra $2O or $3O
billion over the next five years for
beefed-up military forces of any sort.
They are in enough trouble already.

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
Some high-flying Japanese kites
IT IS GOING to be a long and
dreary battle of words, this business
about trading with Japan. The Japan-
ese keep going on about the trade
imbalance and Mr. McEwen keeps
going on about Japanese trading prac-
tices. The facts seem to be that both
sides have weaker cases than they care
to admit. The Japanese case on the
trade imbalance, put again with dimin-
ishing subtlety in the latest issue of the
Australia-Jap&n Trade Council’s
monthly journal, includes a clear threat
that unless Australia buys more from
Japan, there is a risk that Japan will
buy its iron ore and so on from else-
where.
There are two weaknesses in the
Japanese argument. The first weakness
is that Australia’s objection is not
against Japanese goods in general, but
against some consumer goods in par-
ticular; if the Japanese were really try-
ing they would be making much greater
Inroads into the capital equipment
field, our major import area.
The second weakness is that in
threatening to buy elsewhere unless we
Import more Japanese goods, the
Japanese are avoiding the simple propo-
sition that each dollar’s worth of manu-
factured goods they export to Aus-
tralia has about twice as much eco-
nomic significance in Japan as each
dollar’s worth of raw materials gouged
out of the Australian earth has in
Australia. The balance of payments
Impact of Australia’s two-to-one trade
advantage over Japan, with its conse-
quential flow-on through the economy
(after deducting the massive proportion
that is to flow out again in servicing
the foreign capital involved in develop-
ing the raw materials projects) is
nothing like the overall economic im-
pact on Japan of selling manufactured
goods to Australia that involve the use
of skills, semi-manufactured compo-
nents, and machinery, and that have
a far deeper flow-on effect.
But the Japanese are entitled to fly
their kites, just as Mr. McEwen is
entitled to try to jump on them. And
high-flying kites they are.
“What a tragedy it would be for
Australia, only now on the verge of
vast new mineral exploitations, if Japan
were to see fit to divert contracts to
suppliers less restrictive in their recipro-
cal purchasing policies . . . The falter-
ing Australian economy has been given
a new lease of life as a result of the
overall mineral explosion . . . This
temporary reprieve should be very
gratefully acknowledged by the Aus-
„ , ,
tralian Government . . Japan's seem-
ingly unquenchable thirst for most of
the minerals that can be dug from
Australian soil is rather ike finding an
oasis in the desert, for there is no real
prospect in the foreseeable future of a
major expansion of exports elsewhere,
says the Australia-Japan Trade Coun-
c^-
On the subject of the Department of
Trade’s assurances that Japan will buy
Australia’s minerals, come what may in
the way of worsened trade relations, the
Council becomes quite whimsical: Jap-
anese steel interests, for example, have
been concerned for some time “not to
place all their eggs in the one basket
. . . Japan already has too many eggs
in the Australian basket.” In 1966, it
is pointed out, Japanese eggs of iron
ore were distributed among a dozen or
so baskets, Chile, Malaysia, Goa, Peru,
India, and the U.S. taking the largest
share, with Australia in eighth position
holding 4.5 percent of the total. By
last year Australia had risen to third
position, supplying 14 percent of the
total imports of iron ore.
Trans-Pacific air routes
Supposing that the customers will come
IF EASTERN AIRLINES can clear
the hurdles of the U.S. Civil Aeron-
autics Board, the U.S. President, and
the inevitable demands for extra rights
in the U.S. from Qantas, it will be the
seventh competitor on the trans-Pacific
routes where, in those not-so-far-off
halcyon days, Qantas stood supreme.
With Eastern selling itself on the idea
of a need to link “the industrial heart-
land of America and the tremendous
growth potential of the Pacific and
Australia” and being also the biggest
airline on the eastern seaboard of the
U.S. it has won the preliminary round
before an examiner appointed by the
CAB. But there are no assurances that
other, more powerful and disappointed
airlines, “outraged” with the pre-
liminary recommendations, will not
protest to the CAB. United Airlines,
for one, has spent thousands of dollars
charting elaborate Pacific and Far
Eastern networks including vast sweeps
from Hawaii through New Zealand,
Sydney, Western Australia, Indonesia,
and Bangkok. And with a jet fleet of
404 compared with Eastern’s 210 it
will be in by far the strongest position
to make aircraft available when new
routes come into operation.
On this point, Eastern’s concern is
that United and the others should not
inundate the Board with endless de-
tailed argument for a reconsideration
of their application thereby holding up
the passing of the recommendation to
the White House until after President
Johnson has departed. Eastern is
counting on Johnson’s interest in the
Pacific being intense enough to pres-
surise the CAB into hurrying up its
work. And if this is completed by
the end of the year, the company will
aim to have its first loads of tourists
arriving in time to enjoy an Australian
Christmas, 1969.
That is if Qantas negotiations go
smoothly. On trans-Pacific routes the
number of available flights has been
increasing at a far greater rate than
the passenger traffic. Since 1962
Qantas has increased its flights on this
run from seven to nine, other airlines
have increased theirs from five to 15:
BOAC running three to London, Pan
American with a daily flight; ANZ with
three flights a week to Los Angeles;
UTA’s weekly flight to Paris; and
Canadian Pacific’s fortnightly flight to
Vancouver. Over the same period the
growth rate of passenger traffic has
been cut to about half of its 1965
increase of 22 percent.
Eastern will obviously be adding to
hot competition in an area believed
to be potentially rich in commercial
value. Qantas will require an equally
worthwhile reciprocal gesture. The
Australian Department of Civil Avia-
tion is expected to ask permission for
Qantas to fly through Los Angeles as
well as San Francisco as at present,


and rights to fly parallel with Eastern
on its proposed New York-Mexico
City-Sydney run —Qantas already flies
to London via Mexico City and has for
for a long time wanted to take in New
York. But whatever the compensation,
the competition on the U.S.-Australia
route will remain to be dealt with.
By the end of 1971 BOAC have
announced that they will be using the
supersonic Concorde on a round-the-
world trip taking in New York, Hono-
lulu, and Sydney and with the ability
to cut the interminable longueurs of
some of the Pacific hops by almost a
half (even though at a considerable
rise in price of the flight ticket) the
Concorde could prove an irresistible
attraction to the first-class, business-
account passengers. At about the same
time Qantas and Pan American will be
introducing their Boeing-747 jumbo
jets carrying up to 490 passengers at
a time and offering to the first-class
passengers the added interest and com-
forts of bars, staterooms, lounges, and
spiral staircases instead of the brevity
—though with the traditional and un-
comfortable confinements of the
Concorde. The choice between shorter
flying times or spacious comfort will
obviously play an important part in
the competitiveness of .the future.
Qantas has until the end of the
year to decide whether or not it will
introduce the Concorde as well as the
Boeing-747.
The decision must depend partly on
the likelihood of a price battle. Eastern
are already suggesting a cut of 25 per-
cent on fares between the U.S. and
Australia, presumably to reverse the
dwindling growth in traffic. The com-
pany expects to draw most of its traffic
from the Eastern States of the U.S. in
the form of tourists who, it is hoped,
will start flocking into the Pacific area
early in the 19705. To impress this
point on the examiner, Eastern and
other U.S. applicants for the Pacific
routes have been busily investing in
hotels and other property in the area.
Eastern says its plans include big hotels
in Sydney, Melbourne, and Auckland.
For some 12 months now talks have
been going on with Travelodge Aus-
tralia Ltd., Australia’s biggest motel
chain which is at present busily estab-
lishing chains of motels in New Zealand
and Fiji with Britain’s Trust House
group. But no official announcements
will be forthcoming until the CAB, the
rival airlines, the President, and Qantas
have all finished having their say, and
that could take some time yet.
MEN AND MATTERS
LAST WEEK’S moves on CRA’s
management chessboard highlight the
intriguing possibilities for the exploita-
tion of the rare earths at Mary Kath-
leen uranium coupled with, and more
importantly in the company’s view, the
new horizons coming rapidly into its
view in the Pilbara.
One of the moves involves the trans-
lation of Mr. Bob Cuthbert from top
executive of the General Mining Divi-
sion (which looks after minerals sands
among other things) to be number two
to Mr. R. T. Madigan, the managing-
director of Hamersley Holdings. Cuth-
bert, an Adelaide engineering graduate,
is one of the post-war-vintage South
Australians who crossed the border to
Broken Hill, and, very much a man
with his feet firmly on the ground, has
risen rapidly among the men who came
into CRA from Consolidated Zinc.
Both he and Madigan will continue to
reside in Melbourne while they pilot
Hamersley into its exciting future.
As if to emphasise the importance of
Hamersley in CRA’s scheme of things,
Mr. R. H. Harding, who as its invest-
ment manager has for some time been
a key figure in its overall financial
planning, has been moved over full-
time to Hamersley Holdings as treas-
urer, to concentrate on the broader
financial aspects of its development (as
distinct from day-to-day accounting).
Mr. Harding, whose face and career
will be familiar to Men and Matters
readers (8., Nov. 18, 1967) is another
Adelaide product, a bit older than the
40-year-old Cuthbert. He entered CRA
with Rio Tinto after serving for a time
as a cost accountant with Broken Hill
Associated Smelters.
One of the first jobs to face Mr. N. A.
Gilberthorpe, who replaces Cuthbert as
general manager of the General Mining
Division, will be to integrate the Blair
Athol coal and timber into CRA’s
activities (acceptances of the offer for
it are still coming in) and be father to
its beach sands operations, in which he
has recently been intimately connected
as manager of Titanium and Zirconium
Industries. Before linking with CRA he
was with Newmont Mining and Aber-
foyle Holdings. Earlier, he was under-
ground manager at Radium Hill.
Last, but not least, of the moves in-
volves Mr. H. F. Melouney, also a
uranium man with experience at Rum
Jungle when CRA was managing the
mining operation there. His function
will be to get Mary Kathleen on the
move again, though CRA seems a bit
reluctant to specify exactly at what
pace and in what precise directions.
Uranium or rare earths? Recently
Melouney has been manager of Hamers-
ley Iron’s metals division, and before
that CRA’s technical evaluation mana-
ger and works manager of Sulphide
Corporation. Although Melouney
appears to be one of the more earthy
H. F. Melouney
Bob Cuthbert
types in the CRA hierarchy, we are
advised not to be deceived by appear-
ances.
SLATER, Walker Securities’ top man
in Australia, Jonathon van der Borgh,
is fast getting a reputation as .the take-
over king as he neatly puts together
a large Australian operation for this
British - based industrial investment
group out of the bits and pieces of Aus-
tralian companies he has acquired in
the last couple of years. But putting
odd bits and pieces into a rational pat-
tern is nothing new to this 33-year-old
accountant and racing yachtsman
turned company seizer, he once
worked with a jigsaw puzzle com-
pany in London.
Then the young van der Borgh
turned into an old hand at mergers
and takeovers when he became a direc-
tor of a London merchant banker,
Robert Fraser and Partner, where he
worked for four and a half years.
His present boss, J. D. Slater, is keen
on Australia, which is the only country
outside the U.K. where the parent
company has any interests and it has
no plans for extending anywhere else.
But with five or six Australian
acquisitions, not necessarily public
companies, promised for this year, they
will be busy enough.
On top of its original acquisitions
here of the old Waned Holdings
(proprietors of the Wallerawang Col-
liery) and Thomas Brown Sons, the
Queensland draper, grocer, and dis-
tiller, it has been spending a couple
of million dollars on other takeovers.
These include the purchase of Plas-
talon Holdings, whose rainwear and
industrial plastics dovetail with Slater,
Walker’s subsidiary, Bramac’s rain-
wear and industrial rubber goods.
The money is also planned to be
spent on acquisition of the Lithgow
Valley Colliery, but so far this is still
a bit of a puzzle, as Slater, Walker’s
bid has had to be increased to beat a
bold move by two individual private
colliers who have mines on the southern
coalfields as well as the western field,
where export contracts and a doubling
of the Wallerawang power station
in five years will boost production.
Gold
Free price ploy
THE DOWNWARD DRIFT of gold
prices on the free market (now touch-
ing the $U.5.37 per ounce mark) can
hardly be expected to show a reversal
solely on account of the recent South
African ploy of temporarily suspending


the sale of bullion on both the free and
official markets, not in the immediate
future at any rate. For the truth of the
matter is that the strategy of the central
bank’s two-tier system is proving more
successful than many had hoped and
most expected, for the moment.
At the centre of the present situation
is the 2500 tons of gold snapped up
during the gold stampedes, which lasted
from last November through to March;
a large portion of this was not bought
by the traditional hoarders seeking
security and, possibly, eventual capital
gains but by speculators hell- bent on
a quick killing which failed to come off.
The speculators are now loading-off.
And the gold so making a reappearance
is proving sufficient to keep the market
going without the aid of an inflow from
the freshly mined- stuff, and is expected
to go on doing so for months and even
years to come.
The South African policy on gold
has for years been one of selling to any-
one entitled and willing to buy in
Johannesburg (though for reasons of a
fixed price and additional difficulties of
freight and insurance costs few did),
absorption into the country’s own re-
serves whenever it is running an ex-
ternal payments surplus, and the sale
of the remainder through the Bank of
England’s agency in London. This
remains the position, but a marketing
strategy aimed at maintaining relative
price stability though on a hoped-for
rising trend would appear to have been
introduced. The small margin that
might be obtained in the free market at
present has been sacrificed in withhold-
ing supplies altogether, but further
flooding has been avoided. If and when
free market demand again begins to
outstrip supply, South Africa could
then filter some newly mined gold into
it, but only in such limited amounts as
would help to create a steady rise in
the free market price.
If Zurich is to be believed (and in
the past few weeks it has eclipsed Lon-
don as the bullion centre, sources of
supply from South Africa and the
central bank’s pool having dried up),
South Africa could be in for a long
wait which it could ill afford no
foreseeable South African external pay-
ments surplus would be big enough to
absorb all that country’s newly mined
gold into the national reserves. In which
case, in due cdurse, there could be some
additions to the world’s monetary gold
stocks for the first time in over two
years.
Oil utilisation
Synthetic meat
IT COULD, but need not, add diffi-
culties to Australia’s expanding meat,
retracting dairy, and embryonic oil in-
dustries, but the extraordinary fact is
that a yeast-like micro-organism has
been developed which weight for weight
can produce protein (from oil) two
thousand times faster than a bullock
working on a good diet.
On the strength of this biological
breakthrough, after eight years of re-
search in France and Britain, BP has
now announced plans to build a $4.28
million plant “to produce protein con-
centrate from a gas-oil feedstock” at
the group’s Lavera refinery in France.
With an initial output of 16,000 tons a
year, the plant is expected to be in
operation by 1970, with the protein
being marketed as a component of
animal foodstuffs. More importantly,
however, research is under way to pro-
duce more sophisticated forms for
human consumption.
The protein may be viewed as a by-
product of petroleum refining. A gas-oil
cut taken direct from a refinery’s atmos-
pheric distillation column can be used
as a feedstock. The initial process is
one of continuous fermentation using
the yeast micro-organisms, mineral salts,
oxygen from the air, and nitrogen from
French chicks enjoying BP’s
new oil-derived. protein
ammonia. The yeast feeds on the wax
content of the gas oil, multiplying
rapidly to form a yeast cream which is
subsequently centrifuged from the gas
oil. BP states that 100 tons of feedstock
will produce 10 tons of protein con-
centrate and 90 tons of up-graded gas
oil. The oil is something of a long-
sought-after dream for oil refiners,
having been cleared of the yeast and
other micro-organisms which inhabit
mineral oils and block pipes, silt up
storage tanks, and damage jet engines
with the sludge they form. Their
removal from crude oil at an early
stage of refining is therefore very
desirable.
But, above all it is as a huge potential
for boosting the world’s food supplies
that the process is being most warmly
greeted. With present knowledge it is
estimated that 20 million tons of pro-
tein a year might be obtained from 40
to 50 million tons of paraffin-base
middle distillates of crude oil, almost
doubling the total world protein pro-
duction to 45 million tons, which is
more than the 42.5 million tons the
U.N. estimates the world will require
by 1980.
Neutral in taste and smell, the pro-
tein lends itself easily to culinary trans-
formation. It is also rich in the B vita-
mins, particularly the amino acid, lysine,
which makes meat such a desirable com-
ponent of a healthy diet. Synthetic beef
or mutton is quite foreseeable.
And yet, although this new process
has the advantage over sheep and cattle
of being independent of or season
or drought, the natural sources of food
are perennially replaceable. Oil is not.
And before we are squarely in the
atomic age it could well be that we
shall need every drop of the world’s oil
resources for more conventional uses.
Motor sales
Holden leads Ford'
THE STRUGGLE between the new
Holden and the Falcon is one of the
most fascinating features of the motor
trade. And who is winning? Well, it
rather depends on which newspaper
you read. The “Sydney Morning
Herald” reported last week that new
Holden registrations in February were
just ahead of Ford, having 26.9 percent
of the market to Ford’s 23.4 percent;
the “Financial Review” said that
Holden led by 26.3 percent to 20 per-
cent. The facts are that the new
Holden outsold the Falcon by 26.9
percent of total new registrations to 16
percent (or by two-thirds) and that
total Holden sales (including the
Torana) exceeded total Ford sales
(including the Cortina) by 30 to 20,
or by a half.
This is still a pretty good perfor-
mance by Ford, whose Falcon alone
sells as many as all the Japanese car
imports put together and whose small
car, the Cortina, heavily outsells the
Holden equivalent, the Torana. But
there seems every prospect that Holden
may well pull away again in a few
months’ time. Its current low level of
registrations (its total share of the
motor vehicle market has fallen from
36.2 percent in February last year to
30.1 percent this year) is due to the
company’s serious miscalculation of the
success of its “personalised motoring”
concept with its new HK range of
Holdens.
The concept was oversold; buyers
have opted for far more variations in
the basic car than the company could
cope with. Production lines have been
held up waiting specialised components
(like power windows or reclining
bucket seats), for which the demand has
just been too great to handle, and
so there have been delivery delays
lasting for weeks. As a result, in
February (its launching month) and


March the company has missed
out the usual stimulus to sales
brought by a new model. But this
.month the company appears at last
to be catching up and Holden, aided
by a backlog of demand, may tempor-
arily get back to old levels around
40 percent of the market when April’s
figures eventually come out.
But what share will it settle down
to? This is going to be the real test
of the new Holden, when all the curi-
osity value has worn off the car and
it has to stand up to the hard com-
petitive world on performance alone.
The company thinks it has a winner,
following the relatively unsuccessful
HD and HR. Time will tell.
Container shipping
Freight rates?
IT IS NOT disputed that container
shipping is more economic than the
conventional sort, nor perhaps that
both shippers and shipping companies
are going to share in the economies
when the OCL and ACT groups start
their services to the U.K. and the
Continent with nine container ships
next year. The crux of the matter
disturbing the Senate select committee
on the sybject is whether, when the
freight rates for the service are re-
vealed, they are going to show that
•overseas shipping companies have grab-
bed the lion’s share. If, in fact, the
new rates don’t show considerable
reductions on existing rates, a fair
deduction will be that Australian ship-
pers have once again been sold down
the river. What is more, it would be
a fair bet that before long the merry-
.go-round of freight increases would
start rolling again not that it has
ever quite stopped.
It may be a bit late in the day
and why on earth has it taken the
Senate committee nine months to get
nowhere on this vital aspect but
'Senator Cormack, the chairman, does
well to make a last stand. The com-
panies should be told to give him the
figures without delay and certainly
before the committee makes its report
to Parliament at the end of May. In
this, he should bear in mind that on
the admission of OCL representatives
out here, the bulk of the economies
from containerisation “does not come
from the cargo-handling costs but from
the ship time saved or, put another
way, from the additional cargo car-
ried per year by the container ship in
comparison with the conventional ship
. . . the main gain is a lower ton-mile
transport cost, particularly when
viewed on a free in-and-out basis.”
This being so, it would provide plenty
of camouflage for the shipping com-
panies and the sooner they are put to
the test of freight rates figures, the
better.
The Croesus Touch
AN URGE TO MERGE
AUSTRALIA'S
ECONOMIC FRAGMENTS
BY J. C. HORSFALL
TO FOLLOW Mr. McEwen in his
various economic excursions (he’s now in
Geneva on one for the sugar industry) on
behalf of primary and secondary indus-
tries alike, we’ll just have to become less
departmentalised in our approach to
economic analysis, pretending, like the
Federal Country Party and its leader,
that there’s no longer any conflict of
interests between these two old rivals
for protection. Anyway, however much
the two industrial sectors intertwine
these days, with farming now so capital
intensive and manufacturing vying for a
place in the export sun, the arrival of
mining as a respectable industry has un-
scrambled the primaries themselves.
Within the primary group, minerals
have blossomed out so beautifully into
a garden apart from rural industries
that it seems high time we got more in
the mood to look at all the various
industrial contributors to the economy
as merging into an integrated whole in
which tertiary and governmental
economic activities are more than hold-
ing their own. Also, to assist this
approach to the economy, it might
help a great deal if somehow or other
we could stop thinking so obstinantly
of the various States of Australia as
being little economies of their own
whose provincial interests have to be
plugged to the death. At present, even
if the complication of internecine indus-
trial relations is excluded (though it
can’t be) from the picture, what with
the manufacturers, the rural industries,
the social investment addicts, the
heavily internationalised minerals in-
dustry, the States and the Federal Gov-
ernment (particularly in its defence
role) all contriving to get the last word
in, the economic mix seems more of a
mess than a homogeneous whole. In
short, it seems time we stopped pulling
so hard in so many directions and got
a tauter national economic rope.
Of course you don’t necessarily have
to be an economic journalist to grasp
this truth (reading the daily papers is
enough for that), but as the flood of
literature pours in from day to day to
a journalist’s desk it comes through
strongly that economically we are a
divided nation. One would have
thought, for instance, that an organisa-
tion like the Institute of Public Affairs,
which purports to look at the economy
whole and in an objective and non-
sectional way, could have avoided in its
latest review holding up the rural indus-
tries as being a set-upon section of the
economy. The surprise in its article
“Rural Industries in Trouble” was its
highlighting of the fact that since 1950
there has been a drop from 21.7 to
4.5 percent in the contribution of farm
income to net National Product. Its
exact words were: “Notwithstanding a
great increase in farm output, there has
been a remarkable decline in the rela-
tive importance of rural production in
the domestic economy.” One may
suggest that this is a cockeyed way to
look at the significance of rural industry
in the national economy. The IPA
would have done better to have stuck to
its earlier statement lauding the con-
tribution of rural industries to exports —
“Even with serious losses of production
caused by the drought and low prices
for wool and sugar, rural exports are
still likely to constitute over 60 percent
of all exports this year.” It doesn’t
matter all that much these days with
such a variety of other income gener-
ators to hand what proportion of
National Product farm income is so long
as conditions are favorable to the
maximisation of export receipts from
rural (and all other export) industries.
Favorability in this context is a func-
tion of several things, including world
prices, quantities of exports, and profit-
ability of carrying on rural industries.
Following a line long popular in rural
areas (sic) the IPA puts up the wail of
the year for farmers. It says: “The
present position of agriculture in Aus-
tralia seems to be a typical state of
profitless prosperity where turnover
expands but not profit.” Things are
just so bad. “Farming is a way of life,”
however, and the Institute believes that
“many farmers are probably prepared to
remain on their properties on a cash
income not greatly above the basic
wage.” It brings in the economists of
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics
in support. Two of these, it says, have
calculated that the net income of 36 per-
cent of woolgrowers in the high-rainfall
areas and 19 percent of the wheat-sheep-
areas was less than $2OOO a year.
The statistics brought to bear in this
heart-rending account of the perilous:
position of our main export industry are
doubtless unimpeachable. Two things
need saying, however: despite the postu-
lation of disaster, rural industries have
been excelling themselves in the export
field in recent years and few farmers
seem to be leaving the land; the main
point to be drawn from the so-called
squeeze in profits is that there is prob-
ably more marginal activity in the rural
industries than in the rest of the
economy put together —but there is also
a lot of very profitable activity to make
up for it.
If we stop featherbedding the
marginal activity the sooner the
economy will be rid of it. In the mean-
time, it turns out that the IPA is more
concerned to hold the rural industries
up as a victim in its time-honored cam-
paign to stop rising costs in the economy
as a whole —as if they were not
inexorable. “The crux of the troubles
of the rural industries still resides,” it
concludes, “in the year by year infla-
tion of costs. If the rot is to be stopped
the pace of inflation will have to be
slowed.” Over to you Mr. McMahon,
and, ’er, the trade unions.

BRIEFLY
The economy: Australian earnings from major
mineral and metal exports rose 32 percent (mainly in
iron ore, coal and refined silver) to $406.6 million in
1967 . . . while proceeds of wool sales fell $4O
million in the nine months to March, 1968. The
cumulative average price for wool at 42.27 c a lb. was
13 percent below the figure for the same period last year.
Net holdings of gold and foreign exchange recovered
$14.9 million to $lll7 million in March.
The markets: It was a highly active week in London
with the “Financial Times” index rising to. new
peaks every day except Friday when the hike in
the U.S. rediscount rate was a restraining factor. Per-
sistent demand for industrials in the face of crisp short-
ages, encouraging company statements and a better
U.K. economic outlook helped the market.
A booming “peacenik” New York stockmarket was
knocked into its first major decline for three weeks
following Friday’s surprise’ increase in the official
discount rate to its highest level since 1929 in a bid to
restrain the economy.
London buyers returned to the Australian share market
in force for the first time since February. Mining
and oils turnovers in Sydney rose from a daily figure
around 600,000 the week before, to a daily average
of 1,300,000 last week. The Sydney share price index
broke through the 500 barrier for the first time, having
risen almost 60 percent (of which BHP alone provided
more than half) in the past two years.
BHP shares surmounted the $2O hurdle, with assistance
from London, and finished the week at $20.50, after
touching $20.90, so big shareholder Howard Smith
picked up 30c to $3.90.
Market value of the WMC organisation was pushed
up to $653 million, -equal to the level when the shares
were $5B earlier this year before the share split and
issue. The 10c shares ended the week $1.30 higher
at $8.90, with the rights’ last sale at $6.50 . . .
CRA picked up 50c on the week, with a final price
of $14.10. Hamersley added 70c to $10.90, although
they hit $11.20 during the week.
The companies: Following rumors, BHP and Inco
announced copper-nickel mineralisation find near
Widgiemooltha in W.A. . . . and Metals Exploration-
Freeport Sulphur has found further nickel lodes in its
No. 3 drill hole at Nepean, near Kalgoorlie. • The
intersection of 10 percent nickel over 20 inches the previous
week has now proved to cover a total of 3.5 feet,
assaying an average 5.69 percent . . . Natural gas
customer, Australian Gas Light Co., is to add another $1
million to its existing $500,000 investment in the
search for natural gas and oil by taking up two million
50-cent shares in Planet Oil NL . . . Western Nuclear Inc.
of U.S.A. failed to exercise its option to take up a half
interest in some of Queensland Mine’s uranium areas in
Queensland . . . The book value of Howard Smith’s
investment portfolio (notably in BHP shares) rose
by $l2 million to $3O million in the year to December
. . . ICIANZ’s $l2 million “family” debenture issue
at 7 percent and 6J percent opened and closed heavily
oversubscribed.
Third quarter earnings of Hamersley Iron eased to
$2.8 million, down $125,000 from December quarter,
as production was affected by planned shut-downs of
plant to commission additional crushing and screening
facilities . . . Lower average prices for lead and
zinc, but a higher silver price meant sales of North
Broken Hill fell again slightly from $13.5 to $13.3
million in the nine months to March 31 and mining
surplus dropped by $145,000 to $4.85 million, despite
an increase in ore treated from 357,869 tons to 376,754
tons , . . A 50 percent rise in ore throughput at
B. H. South’s Cobar mine in the nine months to March
30 brought a slight rise in copper output (up 448
tons to 5967 tons), doubled zinc production at 2706
tons and 986 tons of lead. At its Broken Hill mine, ore
treatment continued to fall but increased treatment of
residues lifted production .". . Mining deficit of
Kalgoorlie goldminer Lake View and Star fell sharply
in the nine months to March 5 from $91,666 to
$17,779 and subsidy fell slightly to $457,727 . . . The rich
Juno orebody allowed Peko-Wallsend’s Tennant Creek
mines to almost double production in the forty weeks
to April 9 . . . Invincible Colliery has returned to profits.
Slater, Walker Securities (Aust.) retaliated with a
revised offer worth $1.35 in cash and shares for the
Lithgow Valley Colliery when two large individual coal
proprietors made a first-come-first-served bid for
51 percent of Lithgow capital, topping Slater, Walker’s
individual bid . . . Leading engine component maker,
Repco, made a $3.3 million offer to acquire sheet
metal, enginering, and auto radiator group, W. C. Stevens,
at about $l.ll a share, which directors have accepted
. . . F. H. Stephens made its ninth takeover since
going public six years ago, acquiring Brisbane interstate
haulier Banavas Transport Pty.
Baking and flour group Allied Mills raised profits
17 percent in the February half-year and increased earning
rate on capital lifted in last year’s one-for-five issue
. . . Pioneer Sugar Mills reported its first profit rise
for four years with a 4.5 percent lift to $781,000
for 1967 . . . Mark Foy’s, Sydney retailer, which is the
subject of a bid from McDowells, converted last year’s
loss of $140,000 into a profit of $183,000 for the year
to January 31.

You must know
when as well as
what to buy
THREE YEARS AGO one of New
‘York’s more expensive boutiques
approached its stockbrokers with an
unusual request. They wanted them to
help prepare a script to fit in with the
showing of their “blue chip” summer
fashions. The idea was to tie in the line
of patter on the clothes with Stock
Exchange comments: “Now here we
have Margo featuring magnificently in
a very deep plunging neckline, which
isn’t unlike a market plunge fas-
cinating but dangerous” . . . The
whole thing was a roaring success. Not
only did the boutique have a highly
successful day but the brokers did, too.
They found that the after-parade cock-
tail party turned out to be an excellent
hunting ground for new account pros-
pects. Unfortunately for Australian
brokers, the rather strict rules on pro-
motion as laid down by the local
Exchanges prevent them from getting
up to the same thing.
But there are some interesting curves
that local brokers are allowed to get
pretty close to, and they are in the
chartists’ graphs of share prices. These
are in such vogue that some chartists
have formed themselves into a society
in order to swop the dreary fact-finding
'collecting prices for years back) that
goes into preparing these increasingly
popular guides to when to buy. Frankly,
I'd never act only on what a chart sug-
gested—they are more a guide to when
rather than what to buy. I like to make
up my mind about whether a stock is
interesting or not on the facts that I
can glean about it; the chartists don’t
care about that sort of thing they
only worry about what direction the
share price has been going in.
Anyway, most of the larger brokers
(and quite a few of the smaller ones)
have chartists providing them with
regular “technical” appraisals of a mar-
ket, and there is no doubt at all that
these are very useful. One chartist friend
has been at pains to point out to me
that I u'ould not have eight of the 24
stocks in my current portfolio still under
wßat I paid for them had I timed my
buying of them better. I still think they
w'ill do well, but the important question
is when.
A company that looks interesting at
the moment for more reasons than one
is Exoil. With interests in the oil and
mining market now looking as though
it might rekindle, this company is an
excellent “spec.” It has good prospects
in oil, gas, copper, coal, and tomorrow's
“boom” metal, uranium. It is undoubt-
edly, the latter which is currently caus-
ing all the current excitement and inter-
est in the stock. Over the last few weeks
the price of the stock has firmed quite
considerably, and technical indications
in the charts indicate that the trend will
continue. It is also worth noting that
this firming has been achieved on high
turnovers, which, in itself, is another
encouraging factor. The big question,
of course, is how good are the com-
pany’s uranium leases. These are located
at Mount Painter, which is about 350
miles due north of Adelaide. They cover
square miles. Assays to date from
five of the 12 holes which have been
drilled have been officially described
as “promising.” Although the project is
still in early stages, the word is that
Exoil and its other partners in the pro-
ject are happy with the way develop-
ments are going. On this basis, and on
the basis that the market looks ready to-
got excited again, I bought 3000.
Further bull points for Exoil are that
its interim report is due for release
sometime in May, and that it will soon
be spudding jn at Munyarai No. 1 Well
in South Australia. Both these events
could easily spark off oven more interest
in the stock and add to its price build-
up. The shares I bought in this case
were the 1968 options. I got therit at
17 cents.
This week I sold off Nylex and South-
ern Cross Properties. As a reader
pointed out the other day (and quite
rightly, too), I’ve been failing in my
duty lately by not putting in individual
profit and losses on the various stocks
traded. Seeing the error of my ways, I
now make a full confession. Nylex
earned me a net profit of $62, while
Southern Cross Properties earned me
the fantastic amount of $4. Actually,
I’ve probably sold this stock off prema-
turely, but its uneven price pattern
over recent weeks has made me a bit
nervous.

WILD CAT PAGES
Better things are to come
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
SHARE PRICES are going to rise
further; last week’s break through the
500 barrier on the Sydney share price
index is by no means the end of the
road. Now that the fears of March
are behind us and now that the British
are rushing to invest here, despite the
booming London market, things are
really on the up and up. And if the
outlook were to turn sour in London,
there is even the prospect that Aus-
tralian markets would become more
attractive to British investors. So it is
just as well the Americans are effec-
tively excluded by the interest equalisa-
tion tax, otherwise the local market
would have already got right out of
hand.
As it is, the prospect that the Ameri-
cans may eventually get their house in
sufficient order to allow foreign port-
folio investment to run free again in a
‘few' years can remain as a comfortable
insurance policy for those people w'ho
fear that what goes up must eve ntually
come down—unless there are enough
buyers.
But what are the British doing with
their money here? Until a week or so
ago, there had not been very much
evidence of heavy British investment
activity in the market for the past
couple of months; certainly the massive
capital inflow, was not reflected in buy-
ing orders for equities. And there is
no doubt that the cash has been coming
here. Some estimates put the amount
of private investment that has come
into Australia in the first three months
of 1968 at about $3BO million, or the
fantastic rate of almost $l3O million a
month, which even exceeds the unpre-
cedented rate of $lO6 a month set in
the four months before sterling devalua-
tion when U.K. funds were desperately
looking for a safe home.
In any event, it seems that only a
fairly modest proportion of the $BOO
million-odd in private capital that has
apparently flowed into Australia in the
past nine months has found its way into
the stockmarket; there appears to be a
swag of it lying around waiting for a
home. And on top of that there is no
immediate indication that the flow is to
drop off—and none whatsoever that any
of the money wants to go back home.
So the market is going to have a solid
underpinning of British buying for
some time, by the looks of things,
although there could be ups and downs
as Vietnam peace prospects vary. But
one thing is clear; only some parts of
the market are going to benefit. The
British are not at all interested in Aus-
tralian manufacturing industry, with
very few exceptions. They are looking
for natural-resources stocks above all,
but are also keen on some service indus-
tries where they feel growth will be at
a good enough rate to justify moving
out of the high London market.
LOCAL INVESTORS are also going
to be a factor in the healthy look share
prices should have for some time. Even
the recent gloomy sounds from the
Cowan Investment Survey (which has
been forecasting doom and dismay all
around unless the price of gold were
raised) have now been replaced by
encouragement of clients to spend.
So now that both overseas and local
investors are so keen about our pros-
pects, what are the fast-moving stocks
going to be? It is hard to look past
the big leaders— BHP, RTZ, WMC,
Ampol, Mt. Isa —-and the stocks like J.
Fielding and Washington Soul that have
big swags of their shares in investment
portfolios. Others, like the small oil
stocks where a few cents’ rise means big
proportionate gains (like Oil Search at
present, in which the British are very
interested indeed, or Alliance, in which
they will be interested later this year
when it begins to drill offshore in Bona-
parte Gulf), are also worth looking at.
But BHP is the king. We’ve been
plugging this stock continuously for
the past two years as it has risen from
around the $6 mark to last week’s his-
toric move above $2O. And it will go
higher.
Some technical observers of the
market have reservations about BHP
at present. But not all. Last week a
Melbourne broker urged his clients to
buy them both because of the absence
of downside risk and because they
should have a “substantial capital
appreciation” over the next five years.
A Sydney broker has forecast a price
of $4O by the end of next year (to grow
to $lOO within eight years, which
frankly seems a bit far-fetched) and
suggests a current price of $2B; the
The Chartist says:
WESTERN MINING CORPORATION LTD. could well warrant investors’ atten-
tion again with nickel still proving such a “magic” word in the stockmarket. It
was first reviewed in this column in November, 1966, when the price was $6.62
(approximately $l.lO after the adjustment for the recent issue and stock split).
It is an interesting long-term trend study and the overall picture could be assessed
in technical terms of “measured moves.” At times it has shown, very steep inter-
mediate rates of appreciation in the wave-like action of price movements. It recently
“tested” the 1967/8 200 percent uptrend line and has the potential of a further
upward move to approximately $ll.OO, where the situation would again call for
reassessment. Last sale price on 18/4/68—58.70.


Cowan service is telling long-term
investors of BHP to buy at prices over
$2O (although it is uncertain about
shorter-term movements) as it would
be “extremely surprised” if the stock
did not exceed $5O within a decade or
so. It expects BHP to move into the
mid-$2O range fairly smartly. And so
do we.
DOWN COMES the copper price; up
goes Mt. Isa Mines’ share price. And
very properly, too. For it looks as if
the ore problems the company has
had are about over and much earlier
than expected, for there had been fears
that the lower recoveries that have
dogged the mine since last year’s open-
ing of the major new K 57 shaft would
continue until the end of this year.
The past four weeks’ increase in ore
throughput (to the highest level for a
year) could suggest that, despite every-
thing, the company may even be able
to hold its profit for 1967-68 at close
to last year’s level instead of suffering
what had been regarded as an inev-
itable fall (prospects of which had been
holding the shares out of the booming
section of the mining market).
It seems inevitable now that 1968-
69’s earnings will be the first of the
new era of massive profits that should
follow the exploitation of the rich 1100
ore body. Some stockholders have
forecast Isa’s earnings next year as
likely to be more than four times last
year’s $l2 million, and possibly six
times as much. At least the dividend
is sure to rise again following last
year’s cut.
Add to this the company’s big stake
in lead and zinc at Mt. Isa itself, its
northern leases with their large silver-
lead potential, and, then, the company’s
holding of the world’s largest (but low-
grade) lead and zinc reserves at Mc-
Arthur River, which could turn into a
huge developmental project, and it is
remarkable that the mining boom has
so far all but passed Mt. Isa by
(although, of course, without it Isa’s
shares may well have fallen). This is
one stock that the British may “dis-
cover” this time around in the metals
boom.
THIS MONTH has been critical for
the Cliffs iron ore consortium in West-
ern Australia. In Japan on April 15,
the sinter tests were to have been com-
pleted, giving the Japanese steel mills
a picture of how the Robe River ore
performs; and in Washington the group
was to have put its case for leap-frog-
ging the voluntary restraints on dollar
outflow. Nobody except Cliffs has any-
thing to gain from talking favorably of
the project. The potential buyers have
been grim, because to be otherwise
would be strategically unwise; competi-
tors have been keen to point out prob-
lems, naturally hoping the project fails,
leaving more potential openings for
them in the market.
With the steel industry at the point
where opinion is divided on whether
pellets in which Cliffs specialise •
would be preferred to other blast furn-
ace feed, further gloom could be read
into claims that pellets were on the way
out. But this projection has a strong
counter-balance in a report by the
Battelle Memorial Institute to the
United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development and recorded in the
“Engineering and Mining Journal.” Far
from showing pellets about to face a
diminishing importance, Battelle fore-
cast an increase in pellet usage from
6.3 percent to 20 percent between 1964
and 1975. In real terms, this means a
lift from 35.7 million metric tons to
162 million metric tons.
Pellet usage is expected to more than
double between 1964 and 1970, when
14.7 percent of the total usage of
675 million tons would be in this form,
helping push up the average Fe content
to 53.5 percent (by 1975 this is ex-
pected to rise further to 62 percent).
Metallised pellets, the field Hamersley
Iron plans to explore, get a guernsey by
1975, when Battelle forecast 10 million
tons being used. Of the total pelletising
capacity in 1975 of 180 million tons,
the total pellet capability of developing
nations is expected to be 28 million
tons.
This is how the report projects world
iron ore production capacity, in millions
of metric tons:

WESTERN AUSTRALIA will not be
one-upped by Victoria, even on oil! Its
offshore oil potential is being assessed
with increasing favor. On top of a
recent visit to Wapet by Mr. Herman
Dykstra, authority on secondary recov-
ery methods which have given a new
dimension to what can be expected
from the Barrow Island oilfield
(primary recovery methods are ex-
pected to get out 114 million barrels;
by injecting water into the field, it
expects to get something like double
that), there are prospects of further
discoveries.
A most optimistic review of the
area’s potential was put out last week
by Perth broker Hartley Poynton and
Co., which says “the potential of the
zone between North-West Cape,
Montebello Island, and the mainland
to the east makes possible the existence
of an oilfield that could surpass in
size and scope the Bass Strait dis-
coveries.” Such optimism reflects most
directly, according to this review,
through Ampol Exploration Ltd., which
“is now, and will continue to be, the
leader in offshore development of
Western Australia” and carries a high
recommendation.
Pasco Island is a spot on the map
that should expect considerable notice,
according to the review, as a result of
oil and gas discoveries there in May
last year; “implications of this find
give further support to the group’s
anticipation of enormous oil reserves
off the Western Australian coast.”
Pasco is several miles south of Barrow
Island.
Abrolhos Oil NL, the Alliance
Group, Longreach Oil Ltd., and Mid-
Eastern Oil Ltd. are all expected to
benefit ultimately from the offshore
Western Australian exploration. West-
ralia Oil Ltd. is added to the list not
because of its oil interests, which are
not big, but because of the future
potential in the beneficiation of leuc-
oxene, and ilmenite, the beach sands.
The Melbourne market
Weels, Wehls,
and deals
THE MAIN FUN of the market fair
last week was more in the sideshows
than in the grand parade of minerals
and industrials stock, which give
them their due turned on their most
rousing performance for months to an-
other of those buying w’aves from Lon-
don which started before Easter and
was still going strong well after it.
The most intriguing of the side-
shows was a “gorgeous gussie” affair in
which, for once in a while, the Stock
Exchange Committee asserted its
prerogative to suspend the shares of a
company (Bendix), refusing to play ball
with it or, to put it more precisely, fail-
ing to adhere to section 5 (subsection
6) of the regulations of the AASA’s
official listing requirements. The import
of the subsection is that if in the
opinion of the Exchange a company
which is on its official list has merged,
amalgamated, or formed an association
with an unlisted company, person, or
group, and as a result any of these has
thereby acquired control of the listed
company, it shall, if so required by the
Committee, lodge with the Exchange all
information and documents which
would be required if seeking official
listing.
Well, a certain nominee company of
a Melbourne legal firm, one of whose
partners also being chairman of
Bendix had recently acquired a
controlling interest in Bendix, quite
rightly, the Stock Exchange asked the
Bendix board to identify the principals
of the nominee company. To cut a long
story short, the chairman of Bendix, Mr.
Joseph Guss, refused to tell them. That
was just before Easter and, even with
the holiday break to chew it over, Guss
continued to refuse,, albeit preferring
the information that Bendix would soon
become a subsidiary of Automotive and
General Industries of which, also, he

Is chairman. Just how, as he claimed,
masking all this background play, with
the nominee company keeping the con-
trolling shares warm for AGI, was in
the interests of minority shareholders
now denied a market for their shares
was hard to fathom. However, Mr. Guss
felt strongly enough about it to threaten
(if that is the word) to provide a
brokerage-free market for Bendix
shares. The rumpus was still continuing,
with neither side giving an inch.
Of .the numerous other attractions in
takeover tents, disguised and otherwise,
the most intriguing concerned Tas-
manian Board Mills, which recently re-
ceived a bi,d of 65 cents a share from
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills. All
last week a mystery man was buying
Tasman Board shares well above the bid
price and forcing them higher and
higher. The question puzzled both the
companies and they promptly issued dis-
claimers, though in Associated Pulp’s
case it disclosed that it had been offered
large parcels of Tasman Board shares
above the offer price and had, natur-
ally, rejected them. All this suggested
that a counter offer could well emerge,
but nobody had a clue from where.
Against this, Repco’s $3.4 million
share and cash offer for Sydney domi-
ciled W. C. Stephens, which follows
the former’s acquisition for $1.2 mil-
lion cash of the South Australian auto-
motive division of A. G. Healing last
year and its $4.2 million takeover of
Automotive Components four years ago,
looked to be a cut-and-dried affair
with the Stevens family, holders of 60
percent of the company, apparently
assenting in advance. As well as bring-
ing it into the radiator manufacturing
business, Repco’s industrial tie-ups will
be greatly strengthened from the
adhesion of Stevens’ other activities. It
leads the field in exhaust systems here
and it is also strong in tubular pro-
ducts, appliances components, and heat-
exchange equipment. Repco hasn’t
exactly been a darling of the market
this year, having come back to $1.79
from a peak of $2.38 as it echoed the
various disharmonious voices coming
from the motor industry. Even so, it is
more in the box seat than ever as a
local components manufacturer and all
in all the yield of 4.2 percent offering
on the shares at the moment looks
highly attractive, taking its considerable
export sales in for good measure.
Whether or not Dunlop ultimately
makes an offer for Olympic (a price
of $1.40 a share has been mentioned,
where there’s smoke fire usually fol-
lows, so the market in both counters haSi
been strong since before Easter, with
Dunlop coming up from a year’s low
of $1.78 to $2.24 and Olympic from
a lowly 78c to $l.lO. This takeover
show (if it is in fact that) is being
played out in the full open air with
neither company denying or admitting
anything except that they’ve one vital
thing in common, that is in the facing

of more intensive competitive heat from
the two American tyre makers and
marketers, Goodrich and Firestone.
How long the market will have to go on
watching without the companies declar-
ing their intentions is a moot point. In
the meantime, the share prices will pre-
sumably continue to grow. The Stock
Exchange committee should ask them
politely to declare their intentions with-
out delay. And then there is Cyclone,
for whom something is also blooming,
but not so obviously perhaps, the shares
now being at their peak of $1.37 for
the year, up 20c or so from their low.
The market got a late reminder from
A. V. Wehl in the last week of the
rights to the one-for-five par issue that
this company, of which ACI owns 28
percent, and which has only been listed
for the past four years is having its
best year yet. In the nine months to
March 31 its profit of $139,324 ex-
ceeded that of $130,000 for the latest
full year to June 30 last, which in turn
was its best effort in a continuous
series of steady results since the float.
True, it didn’t assist either the rights
or the old shares much but it may have
jolted a few holders of the latter into
posting their contributions to the issue.
Those who took up their rights did the
right thing, although it is small as
listed companies go and the market in
its shares seldom moves faster than
walking pace, A. V. Wehl has one of
the best records of small industrial com-
panies listed in recent years. What is
more it would seem to have a promis-
ing future. It is too late to buy the
rights now but the old shares around
$l.OB to yield 7 percent, with the earn-
ings cover for the 15 percent dividend
paid in each of the last three years now
rather better than last year’s 1.4 times,
should be well worth putting away.
It is rather misleading to regard A.
V.. Wehl as the Stock Exchange does
in its description of the company, as
first, maker of bathroom vanity units
(whatever they are) and then as sup-
plier of laminated plastics, flake boards,
and so forth to other manufacturers
and merchants. In fact, it has the big-
gest sales in Australia of the latter
products. Obviously it has been doing
very well from the buoyancy of hous-
ing this last year or so and apparently
it would have done much better if this
trade hadn’t (like most others) been
so slack in South Australia where
things are now looking up on the
economic front. Good health in this
side of its business looks assured on
the long term. But more important
than anything for its future would seem
to be the tie-up with ACI, whose new
developments in fibreglass usage are
bound to rub off on it in a big way. It
is so firmly in that line of country
already, and ACI, we know, is cur-
rently looking deeply into both the
fabricating and marketing aspects of
its new fibreglass development pro-
gram.


Security analysis
Ensign’s stake in dirty linen
LAUNDERING, dry-cleaning, textile
supply, marketing this is the terri-
tory of the industrial launderer and the
linen-supply people. In the U.S. indus-
trial laundering is a business with
annual sales of some $U.5.650 million,
and the related U.S. industry of linen
supply has annual sales of some
$U.5.734 million. Industrial laundering
involves the supply on a contract rental
basis of garments such as overalls, dust-
coats, wrap-overs, trousers, and shirts,
along with dust-control and entrance
mats, and wiper cloths replacing old rags
to wipe down machinery, equipment,
tools, work-benches; whilst linen supply
deals with washable service apparel,
table- and bed-linen, towels and towel-
ling which is rented to institutional,
business, industrial, and professional
users.
The emphasis in all this is on rental
rather than in merely laundering and
cleaning other people’s garments and
fabrics. In an environment where leasing
and hiring have reached massive pro-
portions, U.S. industry readily acknow-
ledges the advantages of hiring indus-
trial garments for their workers, and it
is the task of the industrial launderer
and the linen supplier to buy the gar-
ments, cloths, linen, and towels, to
store them, and to maintain them. This
is big business and involves an exten-
sive outlay in inventory. Take an
example of a worker who changes his
factory garments five times weekly
.this would involve an investment by
the industrial launderer in 11 garments.
North Americans are more hygiene-
conscious than the average Australian,
at least in their business habits. It is
good business to help keep workers in
a smart and orderly appearance. This
not only creates a greater impression of
efficiency and business drive, but soiled
and badly laundered, clothes are health
hazards inflating the cost of sick leave,
a major cost burden in industry. The
average factory worker in the U.S. now
tends to change his work-clothes two
or three times weekly, in comparison
with the Australian operative, who tends
to wear the same overalls throughout
the entire week, but the rental business
in Australia is fast catching on, and the
potential for expansion is very large.
The Ensign group of companies
operating in Melbourne, Sydney, and
Adelaide was the first enterprise in Aus-
tralia to specialise in an industrial-
garment service. It grew from a very
humble beginning, when in 1927 two
mechanics, Dick Geary and Jim Steven-
son, with cash resources of $BO, leased
400 square feet of space in a tin shed
in South Melbourne, installed a second-
hand household washing-machine, bor-
rowed an old car, and set out to make
more money by cleaning overalls rather
than dirtying • them. In 1938, Ensign
Dry Cleaners Ltd., now known as
Ensign Holdings Ltd., was floated with
an issued capital of $lOO,OOO. The
present managing director, A. J.
Chassell, now aged 58, has been with
the company for 20 years, and he has
under him a team of key executives
with an average age of about 42 years.
Senior staff regularly go overseas to
study production, planning, techniques,
facilities, services in linen supply and
in industrial laundering. In keeping
with its status as a supplier to industry,
the board of directors includes a retired
director of General Motors-Holden’s,
A. C. Wigan, who is the company
chairman, and also Sir Charles
McGrath, who is chairman of Repco.
GM-H has been a customer for over
35 years and Repco for over 30 years.
Although the company flirted for a time
(1948-1950) with domestic dry-cleaning,
Ensign has set its cap only at the
industrial and commercial market and
has been very successful.
On a composition of turnover, which
in 1967 reached $4.2 million, industrial
garment rental would represent 54
percent, rental of linens and towels to
hospitals, hotels, motels, and restaurants
14 percent, rental of dust-control sys-
tems, that is chemically treated cleaning
cloths, mops, entrance mats, and the
like 15 percent, and cleaning and repair
of customers’ own garments, materials,
gloves, and including the salvaging and
reconditioning of industrial protective
articles and gear (this is the “not-our
garments” or NOG side of the business)
17 percent. The overall annual rate of
growth is about 11 to 12 percent —it
has been running at 12J percent in
industrial-garment rental, at 15 percent
in dust-control systems, and at 30
percent in linen supply. NOG cleaning
is declining, as these customers are con-
verting to garment rental. Ensign was
the first company in Australia to com-
mence in 1946 a rental service in indus-
trial garments, and this activity
accelerated in importance in the mid-
-19505. The dust-control service was
commenced in 1959, linen supply in
1960, and a towel-dispensing cabinet
service followed in 1965. Rentals are
based on a minimum contract period
for 12 months, except in the case of
temporary rentals such as during the
Royal Agricultural Show and other
functions of a similar nature. Ensign
is by far the largest company in
industrial-garment rentals in Australia
and is fast overhauling the leader in
linen supply.
Operations are at present confined to
Victoria, South Australia, and New
South Wales, but the company plans
a more comprehensive national cover-
age. On a State basis, Victoria supplies
nearly 60 percent of group turnover,
South Australia 22 percent, and New
South Wales 18 percent. The company
operates a total of five plants two
at Northcote (Melbourne), at Good-'
wood Park and Mile End (Adelaide),
and at Punchbowl (Sydney). The total
enclosed factory area is about 150,000
square feet, and with about 11 acres of
land under its wing Ensign has plenty
of space for further expansion. Other
statistics show that the company has a
fleet of 136 vehicles, employs 645
people, and with about 12,500 cus-
tomers supplies garments and linen to
about 125,000 workers that is to
about three percent of the total Aus-
tralian workforce. The production rate
of garments and materials processed is
running at about 550,0001 b. weekly,
with the main Northcote plant oper-
ating on a two-shift basis. There is
among management an almost irresis-
tible urge to increase productivity, to
install better and more automatic equip-
ment, and to improve methods of
operations. In the factory sequence,
garments and other materials are first
classified, individually checked and
inspected, and the cycle of washing
and/or dry-cleaning and drying is on
an automatic bulk-handling system.
Manual labor takes over again for
finished-garment inspection, for repair,
pressing, folding, and packing. On a
factory inspection I was most impressed
with the operation of two Colmac
“pant-o-matic” machines, which are
capable of pressing up to 195 finished
pants per operator hour, compared to
the conventional laundry press of about
30 pants per operator hour.
The company statistics are:

The acceleration in earnings between
1966 and 1967 reflected a reorganisa-
tion of production methods at the major
Melbourne plant and the transfer of
operations from a phased-out small
plant at Edwardstown to a new 30,000-
square-feet plant at Mile End in Ade-
laide. The interim announcement in
February, 1968, indicated that sales
were up for the half year to December,
1967, by 11 percent over the cor-
responding period of 1966, and it was
then anticipated that net earnings for
the full year to June, 1968, would
exceed the 1967 record.
At $1.62, the shares command a
dividend yield of 3.9 percent and the
price earnings multiple is 11.2. I am
impressed with this company.

Security analysis
What’s going on in Millers?
THE TROUBLE WITH Millers is
not just that its figures have grown
steadily worse since the 1965 peak, but
that no one knows what is really going
on inside the company. Ever since
R. W. Miller (Holdings) Ltd. floated
its ships, mines, and hotels on a sea of
beer it has continued to behave largely
as if it were still a private family busi-
ness. That sort of thing does not worry
the market too much if the profits keep
going up, but the significant changes
that have taken place in Millers since
its 1962 flotation do not appear to have
been all for the best.
This uneasiness over Millers,
evidenced by a slump in its share price,
has been despite the rising investor
interest in coal companies because of
bigger export and domestic markets.
Ironically, it is largely because of
Millers enthusiastic fight to protect
what it feared were diminishing coal
markets a few years ago that much of
the present uncertainty about the com-
pany now exists.
Millers were faced with the prospect
of losing their sales of coal to gas pro-
ducers as natural gas came in, while
“dumped” prices for furnace oils were
knocking its coal sales in this area.
Millers campaign to fight the oil com-
panies over alleged dumping of residual
oils on the Australian market by forcing
them to carry oil round the coast in
the more costly Australian flag vessels,
as Millers coal had to be carried, was
a much publicised drama which left
Miller shareholders and the general
investing public wondering who won.
When Miller entered the coastal
tanker trade with his first ship in 1963,
buying M. T. McArthur and R. W.
Miller in 1964, the return on capital
was initially unsatisfactory. But results
in later years were described as lucra-
tive until the local refineries put their
own tankers on the coastal run and
made it difficult for the Miller fleet to
get cargoes. As Miller puts it, the
coastal tanker trade suffered an “unpre-
dictable change” necessitating the sale
of the smallest tanker, Miller’s Cano-
pus, in 1966. The over-tonnage on the
coast meant tanker results in 1966-67
were below expectations, but the com-
pany expects to gainfully employ the
remaining two vessels for some con-
siderable time.
Despite the higher costs of local ship-
ping after Miller entered the tanker
business, the price of fuel oil fell; and
1966 consumption rose 15.4 percent over
1965. Miller had to respond last year
with a drop in coal price to the home
markets on a short-term basis.
But Millers have a good chance of
holding the line against furnace oil. It
appears that development of Australian
oilfields, which produce lighter crude
(with fewer residual oil by-products)
than the Australian refineries are
geared for, may force the Australian
refineries to curtail their imports of
heavy crudes, reducing the supply of
residual fuel oils with which the coal
industry (and Miller in particular) is
trying to compete. The oil industry is
already opposing the suggestion that its
refineries should switch to lighter
crudes, and insists that for economic
reasons heavy crudes should continue
to be imported no matter how much
local oil is found. This seems unlikely;
local oil finds are in Miller’s best
interests.
The venture into oil tankers, which
has been partially reversed by the
sale of one of its three vessels, and
the sale last year of its brewery for
an undisclosed price (at request of
the buyer, competitor Tooheys Ltd.)
has altered the structure of this
strangely assorted business (basically
beer and coal) so that shareholders
outside the family circle are unable to
see where is the company’s greatest
capital investment. In 1.962 the major
proportion was in the brewery and
hotels, although they did not make
worthwhile contributions to overall
earnings. The best that can be ascer-
tained is that more than half the
capital investment is still in hotels,
although coal contributes more than
half the profit.
In N.S.W. the giant Tooths was not
anxious to pass on increased costs to
the public, so beer prices allowed little
margin for profit to the other brewers.
Millers named its own price (well
above book value) when approached
by Tooheys, for the brewery, and the
capital profit will appear in 1967-63
accounts, as the sale was effective from
July 1, 1967.
The agreement with Tooheys also
obliges Millers and Tooheys hotels to
carry both brands of beer for 25 years.
In the first three months thereafter, in-
creases in Millers hotel liquor sales
of 20 to 30 percent were registered,
and as the object of the arrangement
was to make greater use of the two
companies’ brewing resources and out-
lets for their products, to cope with the
growth in sales, the brewery sale seems
an unqualified success.
Miller’s hotel chain of more than 40
units (mostly in the Sydney metro-
politan area) had very successful re-
sults last year, and this year the hotels
will benefit from last October’s lc rise
in beer prices per bottle or can. A
new hotel opens in Narwee next
month. The company has been very
gratified with hotel results in the de-
veloping areas.
Minus the brewery and minus the
earnings from the tanker Miller’s
Canopus, which last year operated for
five months at spot cargo rates (higher
than contract rates), R. W. Miller
still managed in the December half of
the current year to hold sales and
revenue within 0.7 percent of the
corresponding period of 1966, and pro-
fits fell only 3.7 percent. The 10 per-
cent dividend is therefore not in
danger, particularly as the company
will be more flush for funds than
usual with the brewery proceeds.
Coal tonnage sold by the group was
a record for the half year, and ton-
nages and revenue from this source
will continue to increase. The com-
pany has five collieries operating in
the Newcastle-Maitland area of
N.S.W., and is thinking of opening
more collieries after test drilling.
Priority has been given to developing
coking coal seams, rather than steam-
ing coal, to cash in on export mar-
kets. Miller, according to the pros-
pectus, produced 1.5 million tons of
salable coal in 1962, which was then
about 8 percent of N.S.W. coal pro-
duction of 19,031,000. Miller’s pro-
duction has probably grown at least
in line with the State, a rise of 30-40
percent by 1967.
Miller acts as distributor for most
coal producers in northern N.S.W., both
within the State and interstate, using
its own trucks, rolling stock and colliers.
Coal exports from Newcastle are ex-
pected to rise 50 percent in the next five
years, a happy augury for Millers.
The emergence of Australia as the
major supplier of coking coal to Japan
(surpassing America, which in 1958
supplied 80 percent of Japan’s imports
as against Australia’s seven percent con-
tribution) means that in the past two
years overseas markets have taken more
N.S.W. black coal than either of the
two largest N.S.W. consumer groups, the
iron and steel industry and the power
stations. Export markets now account
for 30 percent of N.S.W. coal deliveries,
compared with only 17 percent in 1963-
64. But exporting is not the only growth
area for coal; although local black
coal consumption rose by only 15 per-
cent in the past eight years, it is ex-
pected to rise by double that rate in
the next eight. And this is despite the
switch away from coal as a feed-stock
for gas production which had been
expected to hit the Miller group in
particular.
Since April 1, 1966, Miller con-
tracted to transport coal for export from
the Electricity Commission of N.S.W.’s
Huntley colliery on the South Coast for
a period of five years. Miller does not
disclose the tonnage involved, but the
Huntley colliery made a substantial
contribution to exports through Port
Kembla in 1966-67, and is expected
this financial year to reach the annual
tonnage required by contract.
Results for the second half of the
current year should reflect the commis-
sioning of the industry’s new $l2
million coal loader in Newcastle, which
was officially opened at the end of
November, 1967 (one year behind

schedule), but not fully operational
until mid-January. Group results for
1966-67 were seriously affected by the
delay, for although performance of
Miller’s new Belmont and Wallsend col-
lieries was beyond expectations, output
was governed by the loading rate of
export coal at Newcastle.
Capital expenditure of the N.S.W.
coal industry in the past four years was
$75 million; of this $24 million was in
1965-66 and $2O million in 1966-67.
Miller’s capital expenditure on mining
plant and development of colliery
properties was $189,000 in 1964-65, and
$1,084,000 in 1965-66. Its handling of
this expenditure in the accounts seems
fairly arbitrary, so that the real trend
of group earnings is obscured. This
capital expenditure is fully deductible
for tax purposes, and the company may
choose to claim it in advance or when
actually spent. By appropriating $BO,OOO
in 1963 for the next year’s expenditure,
$130,000 in 1964, $520,000 in 1965,
$500,000 in 1966 and $400,000 in 1967,
and charging against profits any excess,
there has been a material reduction in
Income taxes payable, with consequen-
tial increase in cash available for plant
expansion. The excess expenditure in
1965 was $59,000, in 1966 $564,000,
but for 1967 the excess, while fairly
substantial, was not declared.
Very high depreciation provisions in
1965 and 1966 dampened earnings for
those two years, although they were well
ahead of earnings for 1963 and 1964.
The company was charging deprecia-
tion on its ships at the rate of 25 per-
cent per annum (writing them off
in four years) but the sale of Miller’s
Canopus in November, 1966, brought a
capital profit of $245,000, so the com-
pany decided to revert to the normal
five percent from the beginning of 1966-
67; hence the sharp drop in deprecia-
tion for the last full year.
Proceeds of the Miller’s Canopus sale
are not visible in 1967 accounts. The
$500,000 investment in Commonwealth
bonds appeared also in 1966 accounts,
and overdraft rose from $595,000 to
$1,446,000. Shareholders must be satis-
fied to leave deployment of the brewery
proceeds, received after 1967 balance
date, to directors for acceleration of the
growth of the organisation.
A loan of $1.2 million to the
Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club in
1966-67 (encouragement of clubs was a
feature of Miller’s beer trade) was
made shortly before the brewery sale
came up. There will certainly be no
future loans to clubs. As Miller itself
borrowed $2 million in debenture stock
in 1964, the loan, for a fairly short
fixed term, would not be a profitable
use of company funds, apart from tying
up of the club as a market for a
brewery that is no longer a subsidiary.
On current historically low prices,
the shares should prove good holding
for at least the medium term, if pur-
chasers do not mind buying in the dark.
Despite the veil of secrecy, prospects,
particularly on the coal side, seem
bright enough to make current market
price of around $1.21 (lower than the
original placement price of $1.25, al-
though capital has since been watered
by a one-for-five bonus in 1965) look
cheap.
The dividend yield of 8.3 percent,
and earnings yield of 15.4 percent, are
higher than obtainable from any other
collier, or successful hotel group. And
despite the fall in earning rate from
30.8 percent three years ago to 18.6
percent last year (and the further slight
fall since then), Miller is still earning
more than the 16.8 percent of its first
listed year, when share prices varied
between $2.30 and $1.77.

Mining
GMK’s developments come good
THE LATEST production report
from Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (Aus-
tralia) Limited is quite encouraging as
it appears to show the first benefits of
the development work the company
has been undertaking over the past
four years on its Mount Charlotte ore-
body. For the first time for many
months ore production showed a rise
(from 63,113 tons of ore lifted to
66,077 tons for the four weeks ended
March 5), while gold produced also
showed a 14 percent rise, from 10,799
ounces to 12,344 ounces during the
four weeks.
The rise in gold production was
more the result of higher grades than
the actual increase in ore treated. But
it is this latter item which will provide
the future improvement in profitability
which the company expects, as the
increase in ore production is now
■coming from the Mount Charlotte ore-
body where costs are only some 55 per-
cent of the costs involved in mining
the company’s older Fimiston deposit,
while the grade of the Mount Char-
lotte deposit is three-quarters of the
Fimiston ore.
Last year the company treated a
total of 863,898 tons, of which 461,637.
tons came from the Fimiston leases and
402,261 from the Mount Charlotte ore
body. These figures are the equivalent
of approximately 35,500 tons per four-
weekly period and 30,900 tons respec-
tively, and as from the beginning of
March the company increased the rate
of extraction of Mount Charlotte ore
to 40,000 tons per four-weekly period.
The fact that total ore production
did not rise by the full extent of the
lift in Mount Charlotte ore was due
to the fact that the company has been
anxious to reduce pressure on activities
at its older, higher-cost mine at
Fimiston, and no doubt production
from this mine will be further reduced
as Mount Charlotte mine ore produc-
tion rises. The sooner it can achieve
this the sooner the company will be
getting the benefit of the savings of
$3.51 per ton of ore mined and treated
from this mine as against the Fimiston
ore, and on a total of 520,000 tons
per year this saving becomes quite
attractive.
On last year’s grade of ore mined,
the loss in actual ounces of gold pro-
duced due to the lower grade of the
Mount Charlotte ore almost, but not
quite, offsets the cost savings involved,
and on a straight comparison of equal
tonnages from each deposit, the differ-
ences in grade and costs would give
the company only an extra $lOO,OOO
per year on a production of, say,
520,000 tons per year.
The factor which makes all the dif-
ference to the operation is that the
Mount Charlotte ore grade will improve
considerably as mining continues. Over-
all grade of reserves in this deposit
stand at five million tons, of ore con-
taining 3.6dwt. per ton against 2.6dwt.
per ton of ore treated last year, and
by the time that the company is min-
ing ore of the average reserve grade,
the cost savings will exceed by about a
million dollars the revenue lost due to
the grade of ore being lower than the
ore mined at Fimiston.
Not only will grade improve as
mining of the Mount Charlotte ore-
body goes deeper. The company can
expect some additional cost savings,
too. Mining at present involves the
extraction of ore from the number
five level upwards, and is by cut and
fill methods, that is, the ore is blasted
down from the roof and in order to
provide a working area for the diesel-

With new ‘SAXON’ by Stetson it’s the power to mark you as a man who
shuns conformity, thinks young whatever your years.
Most distinguishing among ‘SAXON’S’ many points of flattering dif-
ference is the impeccably stitched crown—'decidedly audacious but
still in perfect taste. At all leading men’s stores.
powered equipment, it is necessary for
the floor of the mining area to be con-
tinually added to.
From beneath the number five level
the method of mining will be rather
different in so far as the ore will not
be blasted down from the “roof” but
from the sides of the orebody, in large
vertical sections, and it will not be
necessary to continually raise the
working area. On completion of
mining of a block of ore the cavity
will then be filled. This method is
less costly as machinery (which could
be used for mining) is not being con-
tinually used to provide fill to raise
the working floor, and less work is
required for rock bolting and other
safety requirements. Overall the
deeper mining will use less machinery
and manpower for any given tonnage.
The value of the investment in the
Mount Charlotte development can
already be seen in the cost reductions
already achieved. In 1964 this mine
accounted for 20 percent of total ore
treated of 615,000 tons and the com-
pany’s average costs per ton amounted
to $7.97. The following year Mount
Charlotte ore provided 36 percent of
the mill feed and average costs per
ton fell to $6.72. Last year, when ore
from the Mount Charlotte orebody
made up 46 percent of mill feed, costs
per ton fell to $6.53, and when full
production is achieved and output
from the Fimiston lease cut back as
planned, the larger percentage of
Mount Charlotte ore will bring costs
back even further, to an average $5.90
per ton based on last year’s level of
costs from the two different mines. At
such a figure total costs would fall by
$680,000 while revenue would be virtu-
ally the same. -
As .the company is at present receiv-
ing the maximum subsidy of $8 per
ounce, the best part (75 percent in
fact) of any future cost savings will
go in reducing the amount of sub-
sidy received. Hence, on the figures
above, the company’s net gain for a
full year would be a mere $170,000.
In the current year profit is expected
to be lower than last year’s $457,000
due to lower-than-expected grades from
Mt. Charlotte. The dividend in
December was omitted in order to
supply funds for further development
of the Mt. Charlotte property but at
least the company has reached the
stage where (except for the year to
June, 1968) it can confidently expect
an improvement in profitability. At the
same time the demand for develop-
ment finance will be less and share-
holders can now look forward to a
resumption of dividends. Although
this may take another year or two,
the company should be able to afford
a dividend approaching cents per
share. At their current price of $1.50
the shares would then carry a tax-free
yield of five percent and become one
of the more preferred hedges against
an increase in the price of gold.

THE LAND
Efficiency without profit
AUSTRALIAN FARMERS have long
found it tricky to draw the line
between plight and prosperity. They’re
not such a miserable lot as they sound
when arguing a case for subsidy or
some other assistance to relieve their
economic plight; or if, when pros-
perous, they have to keep it as much
to themselves as they can lest fellow-
taxpayers hear about it. Admittedly,
the exercise hasn’t been all that diffi-
cult of late. Basic problems like incle-
ment weather, rising costs, indifferent
overseas prices for most of their
products, and the übiquitous marginal
producer continue to dog their footsteps
—not to Speak of sterling devaluation
and uncertainties shrouding traditional
markets like Britain, the search for pre-
placement markets, and so on. It is all
the more surprising then, especially in
the light of its current dairyfarmers'
reorganisation program (to cost an
initial $25 million and, when finally
completed, up to $BO million or more),
how very efficient Australia's is com-
pared with dairy industries in other
parts of the world.
One of the most pertinent of the
Australian Dairy Produce Board's
claims for the industry in this countrv
was that on a comparison of the time
taken to earn a pound of butter or
cheese, which is put at 16 minutes for
the Australian Dairy Industry, we beat
all West European countries hands
down. Apparently, the next most effi-
cient to us is Denmark, where it takes
21 minutes. France is the least efficient
—it takes 53 minutes there. However,
on other comparisons we don’t fare
quite as well.
For instance, in terms of the time
dairyfarmers take to earn a gallon of
milk. On the Board’s figures it takes
only 30 minutes to earn a gallon of milk
here. Only four West European coun-
tries can do it in less time—that is,
Sweden 24 minutes, Denmark 27,
Britain 28, and Luxemburg 29. This
puts us about on a par with the latter
three, and also with West Germany 32.
Then follow Norway 34, Switzerland
36, Holland 43, Finland 46, Belgium
49, and Austria 55 minutes. In the case
of France, who would not on this com-
parison be a strong competitor such as
Holland, Luxemburg, West Germanv,
and Belgium would be in the British
market if Britain joined the "Six,” it
takes more than twice as long - 65
minutes—to earn a gallon of milk as it
does here. All the figures in the com-
parison relate to 1965.
However, this relative "efficiency” 'in
earning a gallon of milk is a poor guide
to the retail price of milk. In the
various countries the Board has calcu-
lated the Australian currency equiva-
lents of the retail price of milk in
European countries. It comes up with
the intriguing result that only in four
of them: Switzerland, where it is 86
cents a gallon, Britain 74, and Sweden
and Finland both 72 cents, it is dearer
than our retail price of 70 cents a
gallon (1965 figure). In some of the
West European countries it was sub-
stantially lower —in West Germany,
Denmark, Austria, and Norway, w here it
was in the lower 50 cents range. Our
relative position is quite different in
the case of the price of butter, which
is taken as 50 cents for Australia in
1965. Only the British housewife got
the stuff cheaper than our local ones,
that is, at 48 cents a pound. In Switzer-
land the price was 109 cents, or more
than double the Australian one.
The Board offers no solace to British
housewives on what is going to happen
to their domestic butter price in the
event of Britain going into the Common
Market. "The net effect of the U.K.
changing to the EEC system," it states,
"would be that liquid milk as such
would be cheaper, but the prices for
dairy products would increase very con-
siderably. At present, dairy products are
imported into the U.K. relatively freely
without quota restrictions, except for
butter, and without high import duties.
As a result, prices for butter, cheese,
and other dairy products tend to be a
good deal lower than elsewhere, as they
are often determined by a world market
on which dumping and subsidisation
are prevalent."
The "intervention" price for butter
in the Common Market has already-
been fixed at roughly double that of
the U.K. domestic price, and, as the
Board says, there would be even bigger
increases in other dairy products for
U.K. consumers if Britain linked up
with the Six. It then goes on to express-
concern at the likely effect on butter
eonsumption in the U.K. and our sales
of dairy produce in what is, of course,
the Board's biggest market. (The Aus-
tralian Dairy Produce Board sold
76,700 tons of butter and 52,500 tons
of cheese, worth at first-hand prices
£5tg.24.5 million, in Britain last year,
or about seven times more than the
tonnage of these two products going
from here to Japan, our next biggest
market, in the same period.)
The Board at present thinks that
while it cannot be foreseen what the
exact effect on butter consumption
would be, especially if there were a
reasonable transition period, already
two conclusions are inescapable. Firstly,
there must be.a reduction in the size of
the butter market. Secondly, within the
smaller market, countries like Australia,
which would be outside an enlarged
EEC. would be unfavorably placed.
Imports would be subject to the levy
system, whereas there would be no
levies or duties on intra-EEC trade.

Some dilemmas of "lumpy wool"
A SPATE OF recent research studies
here and abroad has succeeded in clear-
ing away most of the mystery sur-
rounding outbreaks of mycotic derma-
titis in sheep. At long last the nature
of the causal organism is known, a cure
has been discovered, and husbandry
measures designed to limit the spread
of the disease have been proposed.
Nevertheless, despite the augmented
knowledge now available, the sheep-
farmer will still be left with some
dilemmas and awkward choices in
dealing with the disease. Trouble is
that dipping to control ticks and jet-
ting to control flies can promote the
spread of this dermatitis: and the cure
is too costly to apply except in certain
circu'mstances. Of some solace, however,
is the fact that although affected wool
looks horrible, buyers bid up for it.
They recognise that such wool is
usually completely restored in the
course of normal scouring.
Dr. D. Roberts and Mr. N. Graham,
CSIRO Division of Animal Health, are
at the fountainhead of the findings
in Australia. The disease has attracted
world-wide attention among scientists
in recent years because it presented
the'm with a challenge and a chance
to earn laurels. Besides, it affects all
herbivorous animals, and in parts of
Africa, for instance, causes greater
losses in cattle than in sheep.
Real progress' in understanding the
disease started with the discovery about
three years ago that the causal organ-

ism was a bacterium and not a fungus.
So the traditional name, mycotic der-
matitis, is wrong and misleading. Con-
sequently, attempts to cure or control
based on an anti-fungal approach were
unavailing. Roberts has suggested that
in future the condition be known simply
as dermatophis infection.
Mr. D. D. Le Riche, Nicholas Insti-
tute, Victoria, wants the disease to be-
come known as “dermatophilosis,”
claiming that this name is current in
New Zealand and the U.S. Scientists
argued for decades about names and for
centuries about definitions. Meanwhile,
farmers want to settle for the more
descriptive title “lumpy wool.” Dr.
Roberts will not object, except perhaps
to point out that this is only one mani-
festation of the disease, and a relatively
rare one at that. Mostly it appears as
small, apparently harmless scabs on the
haired skin of the ears and muzzles of
sheep and cattle. Indeed, these scabs are
so common as to exclude the possibility
of ever eradicating the disease from a
single farm, let alone a region.
Knowing what kind of a creature he
was dealing with, Dr. Roberts began
searching for a cure among the anti-
biotics. None proved very effective, but
then he found that if he injected sheep
with a cocktail consisting of equal parts
of streptomycin and penicillin whole
flocks of diseased animals could be com-
pletely cured. The only drawback is
cost roughly a dollar a sheep. Faced
with the probability of being unable to
cut a fleece from a scab-encrusted sheep,
this cure offers the farmer an economic
solution. But it would be quite uneco-
nomic to use on sheep with only patches
of lumpy wool or if the scabs were
beginning to lift and shearing time was
still two months away. The disease often
cures itself spontaneously, and; of
course, may recur the very next day
after treatment with antibiotics. Clearly,
a farmer will need all his powers of
judgment if he is to apply this cure.
Moisture is necessary for the derma-
titis to spread, and it can only establish
itself oo unprotected skin where the
coat of wool or the wax layer has been
removed. Prolonged wetting by rain
can open up the fleece and wash away
the wax. So can shearing, dipping, and
jetting. All authorities agree that dip-
ping is particularly dangerous. Mr. Le
Riche has shown that the disease is
highly contagious among wet sheep.
Contact for only 15 seconds between
clean and infected animals is enough
even when the infected sheep had been
wet for only 30 seconds. Obviously, the
draining yard must be regarded as a
menace. Mr. M. Pulsford, South Aus-
tralian Department of Agriculture, has
found that the longer the interval
between shearing and dipping the more
numerous are the cases of lumpy wool.
This is because long wool increases the
risk of scalding, which removes the wax
layer and sensitises the skin. So dipping,
which is requisite by law, is a potent
sonrce of outbreaks of the disease.
Roberts and Graham say that the addi-
tion of bactericides to the dip are of
no avail. Perhaps the time has come
when graziers should be allowed more
discretion about dipping. The question
at least warrants further research. More
should be learned about the conditions
that generate harmful populations of
the external parasites which regular
dipping suppresses so effectively. It
could be that they are being over-
controlled. On the other hand, the cattle
tick is the main agent for infecting
cattle in Africa.
Dr. Roberts is inclined to blame flies
and mosquitoes for the disease in this
country. He has noticed that most
lesions appear in late spring following
the appearance of swarms of these
insects. Lambs, with their short coats
and unformed wax layers, would be very
susceptible to infection by insect bites,
Consequently, he advises that lambing
should be scheduled for times of the
year when insects are sparse. So should
shearing. Shearing cuts often become a
focus for the disease and should be
sprayed immediately with a weak solu-
tion of zinc sulphate. Manifold are the
cares of the sheep husbandman. Better
to be the research scientists picking up
the pieces and then letting them fall
where they may.

Film festivals
A time for stamina
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
WINTER is Film Festival time—
though “festival” may seem a rather
too exuberant term for something that,
when you come right down to it,
merely consists of seeing 28 films in 13
days, provided you have the stamina.
During the two weekends of the Sydney
Festival, one a long weekend, there are
four screenings a day, and in past years
many subscribers have taken picnic food
to eat between movies. Indeed, for many
the al fresco meals in the University
Vladimir Valenta in “Closely Watched,
Trains,” a Czech entry in this year’s
Sydney Film Festival and winner of
this year’s Academy Award for the
Best Foreign Film
grounds (weather permitting) have been
the most festive part of the whole
thing. Finding a seat at any of the
University screenings involved one in a
difficult obstacle course through baskets
and haversacks.
But the University’s out this year; the
Sydney Festival (May 29-June 10) has
transferred itself to the Rose Bay
Wintergarden Theatre, which is larger
and has better projection facilities than
most of the University halls, incon-
venient of access as it is for quite a
large section of the population. And,
after all, you can probably have a picnic
at Rose Bay in just as much discomfort
as anywhere else.
Film festivals in Lurope and America
provide, at their best, a common ground
for moviemakers of many nations to
show their own work and see that of
others; the prizes awarded at the more
highly regarded festivals have a distinct
trading ' value, quite apart from the
honor and glory. No Australian festival
is recognised by the International
Federation of Film Producers' Associa-
tions as a prize-giver, since this requires
a jury of international experts, whose
fares and accommodation must be paid
by the host nation. Australian festivals,
flourishing as they are, don’t have that
sort of money.
Spectators at these festivals seem
considerably livelier than the local
article: audiences may boo and hiss an
unacceptable movie off the screen or
bouts of fisticuffs may break out
between dissenting members of the audi-
ence. In Sydney, at any rate, the most
overt protest made is for a few people
to sweep out of the theatre in a marked
manner.
Other European festivals, though
not conducted on such a high intellec-
tual level, seem to merit, the title 'more,
though the actual movies get rather
lost, with most of the visitors more in-
terested in the bikini-clad starlets, the
champagne parties, and the topless
dresses at the premieres than in the
quality of the films screened. These ob-
viously are aimed at promoting the
tourist trade rather than the art of the
cinema, so perhaps shouldn’t be taken
too seriously.
The Sydney and Melbourne Festivals,
running almost concurrently and with
much the same films, offer a mixed bag
ranging from the Czechoslovakian
"Closely Watched Trains,” winner of
this year’s Best Foreign Film Oscar, and
the much-praised “Elvira Madigan" of
Bo Widerberg to “No Stars In The
Jungle," a Peruvian-made straight ad-
venture story about a search for Inca
gold, and a Dutch oddity called
“Paranoia,” disapprovinglv summed
up by “Variety" as "an offbeater . . .
its outside chances appear limited, even
with a long nude sequence dragged in."
A late entry is Robert Bresson's
"Mouchette.” The Festival Committee
hoped that Satayajit Ray would intro-
duce his new mystery thriller, ‘‘The Zoo
Garden,’ but Ray isn’t keen —he doesn’t
much like the finished article himself
and doesn't think anyone outside India
would understand it anyway. Instead he
will probably bring an earlier work,
“Kanchenjunga.” "Young Torless” is
supposed to be coming from West
Ge rmany, but the committee isn’t bank-
ing on this. "We’ve been promised
things from West Germany before,”
says the disillusioned Mr. Stratton.
There will be films from Japan (Koba-
yashi’s "Rebellion”) and Russia (Yout-
ke\ itch's "Lenin In Poland”).
Brisbane, a fairly new entrant in the
Festival stakes, which packs 13 movies
into the long weekend, shares Vis-
conti's "The Stranger," based on
Camus’ novel, with Sydney and Mel-
bourne. Apart from this it has some
interesting offerings new to Australia
though not all recently made for
instance, the Hungarian ‘‘Cold Days,”
"The Connection,’’ a black comedy of
drug addiction, and Louis Malle’s early
"Lift To The Scaffold.’’
One serious lack in the Sydney Film
Festival is that it presents little in the
way of lectures or discussion groups,
which should surely be part of any
serious festival. (A rival festival at the
University of New South Wales a
couple of years ago promised such
things but didn't deliver.) Last year,
directors Josef von Sternberg and Join
Donner were official guests of the fes-
tival, but their public appearances and
Press and TV interviews revealed more
of their own personalities than their
opinions or influence on the art of the
cinema. This year Satayajit Ray is
billed as guest star—a promise that
veteran subscribers may take with a
grain of salt. Ray has been supposed to
appear on more than one past occasion.
Seminars and discussions have been
tentatively tried in the past, but, ac-
cording to Festival director David
Stratton, "proved unsuccessful for vari-
ous reasons,” the main one being that
very few people attended.
So Australian festivals don’t give
prizes or except in the case of a few-
local productions—show world premi-
eres. W hat they do offer is the chance
to see a great many movies in too short
a tilin'—a few good, several interesting,
and some right old bombs. That’s not
a bad proportion, really, and for the
best of their offerings (many of which,
like the controversial "Warrendale,”
might not otherwise be screened here),
for their year-round encouragement of
good movies, and their unremitting
struggle for sane censorship, one must
forgive the festivals for a lot of their
artier and more self-important aspects.

“WE’LL REHEARSE tonight after
the concert. I can’t come tomorrow; I
must plough the big paddock or my
animals will have nothing to eat.”
“Uncle Ernie” Llewellyn was talking to
his colleagues during the Eighth Mitta-
gong Easter Festival of Chamber Music.
Mr. Llewellyn, after his retirement from
leadership of the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, has not settled to a life of
quiet contemplation. He is a kind of
patron saint to all young players who
flock to Mittagong; he is a musician
and a gentleman, but hardly a
gentleman-farmer. He made time to
plough his paddock and to help a
heifer with the birth of her calf during
this Easter weekend—his rest from the
duties of Principal of the Canberra
School of Music. I wonder whether
people in other professions indulge in
as strenuous a rest.
The jobs to be done on the farm were
interrupted by some others: he led in
Mozart’s String Quintet K. 155, the
other players being Messrs. Hazelwood,
Pikler, Glickman, and Painter and in
the String Quartet K. 589, in which he.
was joined by Robert Pikler, Robert
Ingram, and Lois Simpson; needless to
say, both performances were joyfully
competent and chamber music at its
best. For variety, he also conducted the
Festival Orchestra in the Sinfonia Con-
certante (soloists Sybil Copeland and
John Glickman) and took a place
among the Conservatorium students
who performed the Divertimento K. 136.
Finally, after leading the Festival
Orchestra through a symphony and a
concerto, he gulped down a quick sup-
per and went off to conduct a midnight
workshop, putting a young group
through their paces in a Dvorak trio!
Mr. Llewellyn, being a “retired”
man, did not set the pace. There was
Robert Pikler, who had organised the
Festival's programs and artists, con-
stantly available for rehearsals and
advice; on the side, he played in two
string quartets, the clarinet trio, joined
in scratch orchestras, conducted a
major concert, and even played his
viola in a Dreyfus work at one day's
notice. It was Pikler who had conceived
the idea of a Festival almost wholly
devoted to Mozart and who had
assembled the necessary players. When,
on the final evening, Musica Viva’s
honorary membership was conferred on
him, the applause was almost as impres-
sive as was the size of the giant choco-
late Easter egg presented to him.
It was no great surprise to find 18
works, out of Mozart’s total of some
700, which warranted hearing—indeed,
three times as many would have pre-
sented no real problem. But, as Mozart
is one of the most widely heard of
composers, it was an achievement to
select works which might be wholly
unfamiliar to most listeners, music suffi-
ciently varied and entertaining, and
which, with a festival’s limited re-
sources, would give a rounded picture
of his creative genius.
Some of the works were certainly


Composer George Dreyfus, who presented a program of his own music at the
festival

Hall
rare and curious enough: a duo for
violin and viola; a sonata for bassoon
and cello; an aria for baritone and
orchestra with double bass obbligato;
the “Musical Joke”; the opera “Bastien
and Bastienne.”
The array of musicians was as
unusual as the repertoire. The great
majority of them were youthful
students and aspiring soloists; indeed,
the festival’s whole emphasis was on
youth. Our leading elder strong players,
whom I’ve already mentioned, provided
much guidance, but it was a great joy
to hear young players of talent and skill,
such as cellist Nathan Waks, flautist
Suzy Powell, violinist John Harding,
and clarinettist Pamela Johnson, launch-
ing out for themselves. The Glickmans
apart, nearly all the other performers
came from Sydney this time. Following
the 1967 experiment, a prizewinning
young ensemble from New Zealand was
invited to participate; this group, the
Grafton Trio, contributed two of
Mozarts piano tnos aud won many
friends. I heir pianist, Christine
Cuming, is a player of remarkable sen-
sitivity, ideally suited to Mozart’s music.
She was eclipsed only by Romola
Costantino, who gave a breathtaking
performance of the E-flat Concerto.
Rather unexpectedly, “Bastien and
Bastienne,” written when Mozart was
12 years old, proved a major hit. Pro-
duced by Terence Clarke, the opera
was brilliantly sung by Marilyn
Richardson, Stewart Ogilvie, and Barry
Strong, in delightful costumes, on a
bare stage. The producer supplied an
amusing commentary, interpreted by
the singers in mime, linking the sung

thorpe’s is distinguished by its strong
individuality.
By common consent Peter Scul-
thorpe’s dominant trait is charm; he
charms artists into playing his music,
discussing it, and liking it. Of greatest
interest was his “Tabuh-Tabuhan,”
recently premiered during the Adelaide
Festival. With three of its five move-
ments based on Indonesian gamelan
music, it proved to be of great
emotional impact; apparently uncompli-
cated, it includes material based on bird
calls and jungle noises and ranges from
the nightmarish to the magical. As one
of the composers “in residence,” Scul-
thorpe was allowed two days to produce
a new piece, to be performed by all
and sundry on the Festival’s final morn-
ing. The result, suitably titled “Fun
Music I,” included the wild braying of
a vintage-car klaxon and your reviewer's
version of a cuckoo.
It was proved, once again, that a
festival is people. Ernie Llewellyn
alternately ploughing and conducting,
Peter Sculthorpe composing, George
Dreyfus entertaining; others, on the
fringe of things, provided as much
variety. Derek Jolly, Adelaide’s exuber-
antly energetic wine-buff, spent hours
studying the architecture and acoustics
of Frensham’s fine Clubbe Hall in
furtherance of his own concert-hall
project. A Sydney artist crouched in
a remote gallery sketching performers;
the Musica Viva manager, in brief
respite from frantic organising, was
indulged with a specially written part
for hand-bell in Sculthorpe’s piece. The
young musicians practised in dozens of
corners simultaneously, then took time
off for flirtations while other took their
places in rehearsal rooms. It was not,
perhaps, quite as earnest and strait-
laced as festivals usually tend to be,
but I doubt that Mozart could have
objected to the devotion shown by the
happy crowd, shorts, minis, and bare
feet notwithstanding.

Rebels in the
schoolroom
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Little Malcolm And His Struggle
Against The Eunuchs. David Halli-
well. Emerald Hill, Melbourne.
The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie. Jay
Presson Allan. Russell Street, Mel-
bourne.
FOR ALL their differences Malcolm
Scrawdyke and Jean Brodie are as alike
as Tweedles Dum and Dee. Both their
stories begin in schools, with them at
war with conservative administrations.
Both characters are fervid dreamers
who infect those near them with loony
and ultimately fascist visions. Both
suffer the harshest of awakenings and
complete rejection by their acolytes.
Malcolm, an art student at a Hud-
dersfield institute, is expelled for
general insubordination and persuades
some fellow students to resign in sym-
pathy. Whipping them into a frenzy of
indignation, he forms the world’s newest
and smallest political force, the Party
of Dynamic Erection. With much chest
thumping, drumbeating, and brandish-
ing of a phallic banner, they set out
to destroy the debilitating forces of
middle-class eunuchism. However, our
Yorkshire Mussolini is, in fact, a ter-
rified and impotent child, and when
the moment comes to kidnap their
hated headmaster, Malcolm stands
trembling and broken on the stage and
his two-man army deserts him.
This extraordinary play, which is
allegedly autobiographical, is written in
the sort of psychedelic prose that John
Lennon favors for his lyrics. It is wild
in its inventiveness and exhaustingly
exuberant.
I haven’t enjoyed a play so much
in a long time, and have nothing but
praise for Terry Ward’s marathon per-
formance as Malcolm and John
Romeril’s portrait of a hotly pubescent
young novelist called Nipple. Stefan
Mager’s production, however, was far
too athletic and one grew very tired of
the physical overstatement he de-
manded from the cast.
Jean Brodie taught in a stuffy girls’
school in the Edinburgh of the ’thirties.
She was a superwoman of the Isodora
Duncan stamp who would select a few
girls from her class and fill them with
the romanticism of Bronte, Dante,
Verdi, and Lawrence. “I am in the
business of putting old heads on young
shoulders,” she’d say with her almost
deranged intensity. “And all my pupils
are the creme de la creme. Give me a
girl at an impressionable age and she
is mine for life.”
A child whose perception Brodie had
dangerously heightened saw her teacher
as ridiculous and betrayed her to a dour
headmistress who had waited for years
to trap the gaudy butterfly.
Like most plays drawn from novels,
this work suffers from compression.
Events occur too quickly, character
development is abrupt and often im-
plausible.
But Brodie, like Scrawdyke, could
not easily be contained in three acts.
Both plays might be less than art, but
they’re far more than mere entertain-
ment. And Monica Maughan’s Brodie
and Lyndell Rowe’s child student are
something to see.
Once again I’d quarrel with the pro-
ducer, and for exactly the same reason.
John Sumner’s direction of the adult
characters is often perceptive, but the
pupils are made to leap, bound, and
bounce in a grotesque parody of child-
hood. As a result, Brodie’s girls were
more St. Trinian’s than entranced.
Films
The unexpected
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
In Cold Blood. Director, Richard
Brooks.
A UNIVERSAL nightmare fear is that
of attack by something utterly unac-
countable, unpredictable a thunder-
bolt, a tidal wave, an earthquake
terrors which we can laugh off tem-
porarily in daylight. For the Clutters,
an almost aggressively nice, normal
Kansas family, the dream came ter-
ribly true when two psychopathic
strangers invaded their home in search
of a non-existent hoard of cash.
Richard Brooks has done a superb
job not only of directing but of adapt-
ing Truman Capote’s “non-fiction
novel” to the screen. He uses Capote’s
cinematic technique of quick cutting
from the Clutters to the killers to
the pursuing police. While he doesn’t
follow the written word slavishly, he
retains the horror and pity of the
original. This could well have been
merely a Gothic thriller; as it is, it’s
a moving and brilliant study of the
destructive force of violence not only
on its victims, but on its practitioners
and on the society which must then
destroy them.
Without crocodile tears, the direc-
tor shows the pressures and outside
forces that turned Perry and Dick
into killers. Apart, they were only use-
less, petty criminals, preying trivially
on a world they felt had wronged
them. Together they were as dangerous
a combination as fire and gunpowder;
the Clutters just chanced to be caught
in the inevitable explosion.
Brooks’ treatment of the actual
murders, which could have been a
gratuitous exercise in bloody sensa-
tionalism, is admirably restrained. At
the actual time of commission, they
are only implied, and are only shown
later in flashback to Perry’s confession,
in a glancing, elliptical style, as if the
reality were too much for even the
killer to face. The horror of the deed
has already been tersely summed up by
the tearing scream on the soundtrack
that heralds the off-screen discovery of
the corpses.
Brooks and his cameraman Conrad
Hall show a striking sense of place
in their images of the Clutter farm-
house such a safe house it looks!
and the blank, endless plains dotted
with thriving but curiously imperma-
nent-seeming towns. Indeed, the only
real criticism to be made of Brooks*
presentation of the story is his em-
ployment in the last sequence of a
pontifical mouthpiece in the form of
a magazine feature-writer, who spells
out the arguments about capital
punishment in an annoying and quite
unnecessary manner.
Brooks has found a remarkable pair
of unknowns to play the murderers,
with Scott Wilson as Dick, glib,
superficially charming, the planner;
and Robert Blake as the gentler, more
apparently ordinary Perry, who, when
it came to the point, did the killings.
Charles McGraw makes much of the
small role of Perry’s father. But the
acting is not the main point in this
almost documentary film; its impact
is in its clear, unsentimental look at
the dark places of the mind and heart
and its implied warning that the bars
that protect us from the wild beast
aren’t so strong after all.
Musicals
Simple joys
By JOHN CARGHER
Waltzes of Vienna (Johann Strauss, sen.
and jun.), Palais Theatre, Melbourne.
THE MILLIONS of Australians who
still sentimentalise over Gladys Mon-
crieff or Miliza Korjus should be
thoroughly delighted with this genuine
period production of “Waltzes of
Vienna.” Treating it as a period piece
is the only way to evaluate it. It is
not a Strauss operetta, but an attempt
to use the music of the Strausses,
father and son, to capitalise on the
successful musicals of the 19205. In
this it succeeds, and the huge cast is
probably as good as anything seen in
this line in Australia, though the
anachronism of three French principals
singing Austrian music in broken
English, and occasional French, to
Australian audiences is hard to digest.
But the simple joys of this kind of
entertainment are not compatible with
serious criticism, otherwise the picture
postcard sets and inane dialogue would
produce harsh condemnation. How-
ever, picture postcards have always


outsold serious art and there is no pre-
tence on anybody’s part that “Waltzes
of Vienna” is anything but picture
postcard entertainment. As such it
succeeds, and the many artists, if not
the advertised imported production,
are thoroughly professional in every
way.
Anne-Marie Sanial, Nicole Broissin,
and Andre Jobin are said to be stars
of the Paris Opera Comique. Their
standard is certainly good enough. All
three (including M. Jobin) are very
pretty, all have excellent voices, and
all act more than adequately, some-
thing which cannot be said about the
majority of artists imported for shows
of this type. The extensive ballets
arranged by Kathy Gorham and Rex
Reid are way above normal commer-
cial standards, and Frank Thring un-
doubtedly collects a large cheque each
week for speaking half a dozen lines
and allowing his name to dazzle pros-
pective ticket buyers. One hopes that
he will pass this money on to Mel-
bourne’s straight theatres by reducing
his fees there.
Complaining publicly about poor
public response is committing
theatrical suicide. Mr. James Laurie
chose this method when he found him-
self in financial difficulties during the
launching of “Waltzes of Vienna.”
That his own judgment was badly
amiss did not trouble him at all. Two
alternative versions of his play, one
on stage and one on film, have been
shown during the past twelve months;
bringing out unknown French artists
(however good) to sing Strauss in
English is ridiculous, and staging the
whole thing in an outer suburban
theatre is asking for trouble.
Television
Following the
Forsyte family
By DENIS O'BRIEN
THE ABC estimates its national weekly
audience for “The Forsyte Saga” at
between 450,000 and 500,000, which, no
doubt, will surprise devoted groups of
viewers who are convinced, from their
Monday morning analyses of Soames’
latest melancholy, that the entire Aus-
tralian population is watching this
superb and compulsive BBC-TV pro-
duction.
In Sydney, the series is rating a
respectable 14 or 15. This probably is
not as high as the early optimism of
ABC publicity imagined, but it must
be very useful to Bob Sanders’ pre-
ceding “People” program, which, this
season, is exhibiting a strangely testy
lack of confidence and an indifferent
cast of guests. Viewers hooked on “The
Forsyte Saga” are forced, by an ABC’s
cunning time scheduling of the pro-
gram, to stay with Channel 2 all of
Sunday evening or engage in that
irritating business of channel-switching
on the quarter hour. Those who don’t
switch virtually are forced to bed early;
after “Forsyte,” Channel 2 caters only
for those who want to satisfy their
Christian obligations through TV.
Perhaps it is wise not to attempt to
top “The Forsyte Saga” in the same
evening. By the time each episode has
glided out of view the addict usually is
lost in admiring contemplation and is
ready to prepare his conversational ver-
dict for the next day. “The Forsyte
Saga” is very much a middlebrow
“Coronation Street” and attracts the
same analytical consideration from its
followers.
It is interesting to hear evidence, for
instance, of the pro-Soames and anti-
Soames camps which- have developed.
Those who favor the man see him as
highly principled, misjudged for his
caution, and deserving of a wider family
sympathy; those who love to hate
Soames Forsyte regajd him as a blood-
less bastard, incapable of warmth, and
who deserves to have his damned
properties devalued. Eric Porter’s finely
maintained characterisation keeps a
stern neutrality toward such specula-
tion, but the BBC adaptation is prob-
ably a bit hard on John Galsworthy’s
original.
There are those viewers, too, who
think that Nyree Dawn Porter’s Irene
substitutes icy hauter for the well-bred
dignity of the original; others who are
infatuated with Miss Porter and who
find it difficult to believe that any such
Irene could remain in sexual isolation
for so long after walking out on
Soames.
My favorite character was Swithin
Forsyte (played with magnificent oafish-
ness and boorishness by George Wood-
bridge), who was felled in the wave of
deaths which recently swept the For-
sytes, without even appearing in the
particular episode. Kenneth More’s
Young Jolyon sometimes seems too
sanctified but helps greatly to anchor
the production to its gentle style. Mr.
More always has had difficulty playing
anything else but Kenneth More, no
matter what the cut of his roles; in this
he steps sufficiently outside himself to
add a laurel to his career.
Criticism of the ABC’s circulation
of a Forsyte family tree has been sig-
nificantly-' amusing. The critics have
accused the ABC of playing spoil-
sport by revealing, through the, docu-
ment, something of the progression of
the serial; this presumes a view of
the “Saga” as a piece of recent writing,
with a denouement still unpublished.
It is not the first time that television
has revealed the large gaps in our
reading and thereby revived an interest
in authors long deceased. The
Penguin people obviously are happy
to fill the gaps: they have published
new paperback editions of the nine
Galsworthy volumes from which the
BBC has made its adaptation, so there
is still time to cheat by reading
ahead. Last Sunday’s episode in Syd-
ney was the 11th; there are 15 more
to come.
However, I do not recommend the
practice of such one-upmanship among
your Monday morning post mortems.
There are some of us who still like
to read the Bible as condensed by
“Reader’s Digest.”
Lunchtime Theatre
Enlightened
By ROBERT WARD
“What Shall We Tell Caroline?” John
Mortimer. Theatre 62.
LUNCH-HOUR theatre in Adelaide
takes place in the new AMP Building’s
auditorium. As a theatre, it is about
the same size as Sydney’s Q Theatre,
but with a wider, deeper stage and
markedly more comfortable seating. The
Arts Council of South Australia has
taken out a continuing lease of the
theatre, and has offered it to a number
of companies on an enlightened sponsor-
ing basis in which the Council pays
straight fees to the producer, technical
staff, and cast, and then suffers the loss
or gathers the probably rare profits.
Unfortunately, so far they have not
been able to imitate the Q Theatre’s
sandwich-and-coffee lunch, as the
Adelaide AMP management apparently
finds this idea a little irregular.
The South Australia Theatre Com-
pany, The Players, and Theatre 62 were
among the organisations approached by
the Council, but only Theatre 62, with
a permanent establishment of six
players and director, has been able to
commit itself to monthly productions
on a professional basis. They com-
menced their participation in the ven-
ture with “What Shall We Tell Caro-
line?” and this is to be followed shortly
by two Australian plays.
“What Shall We Tell Caroline?” is a
slight play, concerned in the main with
role-playing on the part of an agitated
Public School headmaster, his romantic
wife, and a master and friend of the
family. The game is that the head-
master plays cuckold to his wife and
the master, and this has the object for
them of recapturing the gay time they
had as bright young things of the
’thirties. The game gives point to their
lives, and when it forces the daughter
of the house to leave, they simply return
to their game rather than face the fact
that the game is not worth playing.
As a first production in a new theatre
with a strict time limit, one can say
that John Edmund’s production was
adequate, and at times quite funny. But
the play was not well acted. Harry
Lawrence’s headmaster was really only
Harry Laurence writ large again, while
the rest of the cast made tentative
excursions into their characters


“Barman, I’ll have a
Campari with chunks
of ice and a big shush
o£ soda/*
“Sorry, Sir, there’s no
Campari left/*
“That’s too bad it’s
so gloriously pink and
cryptically bitter. All
right, I’ll try it with
vermouth and ice.”
“But I said there
wasn’t any Campari.”
“Oh I see. Did you
know it was made with
herbs from four con-
tinents macerated in
pure grape spirit in
oaken vats? 0.K., give
me Campari and gin
and don’t forget the
ice.”
“Listen. There-is-no-
Campari. It’s all gone!
No more. None left.
FINISHED! We have
everything else, but no
Campari.”
“Oh very well then,
I’ll have a Campari.”

Art
What's happening
in sculpture
By ELWYN LYNN
Rollin Schlicht. Central Street Gallery,
Sydney.
Lyndon Dadswell. Farmer’s Blaxland
Gallery, Sydney.
ROLLIN SCHLICHT, born 1937
and representative of those new abstrac-
tionists to make a massive debut at
Melbourne’s Art Centre in August, and
Lyndon Dadswell, born 1908 and pre-
senting his first one-man show after a
lifetime of inspiring teaching and
public commissions, are abstractionists
generations apart in attitudes. There’s
much more to it than that Schlicht
pursues naked forms and urgent, shallow
surfaces and that Dadswell has pushed
Antoine Persner’s sculpture into baroque
formulations.
Dadswell is after a constructivism of
the emotions, but Schlicht is ironically
detached in the manner of Watkins and
Lichtenstein; such painters, concerned as
they are with the accumulation and
impetus of simple, flat shapes, half-
parody the abstraction of the ’twenties
and ’thirties. Lichtenstein, in his Modern
Paintings, that by implication lampoon
Greenberg’s theory of the development
of modernist painting, uses the ab-
stracted decor of the ’thirties as a decoy;
he takes the debased and cliche-ridden
styles to create works where the nar-
row gap between debasement and real
art is crucial. Something similar occurs
in the overall pattern of Schlicht and
Watkins, who treat some of abstraction
as Pop artists treat commercial advertis-
ing. There is nothing derogatory in say-
ing that this trio is involved with the
energy, precision, and clarity of com-
mercial design. The emphasis on struc-
ture has been so übiquitous that the
participation of all kinds of artists in
the revolution in surface patterning and
manipulation has almost been over-
looked.
Some of Schlicht’s earlier works, like
the low-toned Siera, continue his
delicate relational balance, but Coney
and Merlin, the latter in the shape of a
T, are too impactive and push the
accumulation of familiar modern forms
to sheer congestion. Indian Red, how-
ever, is one of the triumphs of new
abstraction in Australia; it may have a
distant kinship with Delaunay in its
circular movement, but Delaunay was
abstracting a sensibility and Schlicht
presents the pure life of forms. Bands
of green, pink, red, white, and so on
encircle a shifting centre; the bands flow
easily or are fractured; the circle rotates
or is stopped by the steps that lead you
in on the bottom left or the optical
illusions that drive the eye into the
centre from the top right. It’s a telling
combination of fluid grace and impera-
tive impetus.
However successful his discontinuous
movements, the shaped canvas of
Bishop’s Whole Length, with a triangle
above a square, is too disjunctive, and
where he combines a repetition of
forms, like the swinging quadrants in
Jubilation which tend to force a near
vertical into a diagonal or in Happy
Days where he disrupts the equilibrium
of a blue triangle in ochre by having
its base split and wheel in on each of
the sides with swift finality, he is in
splendid control.
Dadswell’s 14 pieces of either free-
standing sculpture or deep bas-reliefs,
all convolutions of brown-paper strips
strung and twisted on wire to give
direction to the structure, have a dif-
ferent kind of finality. There is a deathly
hush.
Except for Number 6 they are little
concerned with silhouettes, but trace
the movements of the paper bands
about, in and out of holes, interstices
and rifts. One is not driven around the
free-standing pieces, for they are multi-
faceted bas-reliefs rather than sculpture-
in-the-round. They variously resemble
sandstone caves, congealed striations of
caramel lava, complex cocoons of
unknown insects, or the preserved
internal organs of prehistoric monsters.
There is nothing wrong with this pre-
vailing sense of preservation and em-
balment, but while Schlicht’s shapes are
liberated, Dadswell’s look confined, as
though there were metaphysical bodies
trying to escape the paper bandages:
what disconcerts is that these “bodies”
bear little relationship to the surface.
An artist like Christo can tie an object
in burlap and rope so that the outside
shape indicates an internal menacing
form. In the deep plaque, Number 8,
Dadswell does evoke the lurking
presence of concealed monsters, but
elsewhere surfaces are too congealed
to original encapsulated forces. In
Number 1 the surface is so tortured and
tortuous that the inner spirit must be
plainly exhausted.
The bas-reliefs are more viable and
fluent, however staccato some move-
ments may be; in Number 12 a separ-
ated curve embracing one side and
some undirected stripes like flotsam
assist the floating dynamism Dadswell
seeks. Maybe one has been seeing too
many bland and direct new abstractions
to appreciate fully Dadswell’s ingenious
reticulations, but they do resemble
frozen whirlpools and muscle-bound
action. Paradoxically his plaques are
best, because he leaves still holes
through, which one sees the uninvolved
wall, but otherwise one cannot see the
form for the convoluted virtuosity.
Whether one prefers their faint eeriness
or Schlicht’s relatively uncomplicated
optimism, the conjunction of the two
shows provides instruction in what’s
been happening to form and surface.

BOOKS
Trying to get rid of the novel
By FRANK ROBERTS
AN AMERICAN CRITIC suggests
that Gore Vidal’s “Myra Breckinridge”
should finish off the novel, but I doubt
it—even though Vidal is one of those
modern American novelists who predict
an imminent demise for the form and
do their best to bring it about. These
self-liquidators may interest some
literarily inclined psychiatrist around
the second millenium; say, an AD 2000
Karen Horney. But for the present I
think there are worthier “enemies of
promise” in the bunch reviewed here,
Priestley, Sillitoe, and Pincher, British
writers who are, and have been, killing
off the novel by smothering it with
cottonwool.
Mind you, they are men who deserved
their high places in public esteem. But
today they are men surprised by time,
writers for the passing three-dimen-
sional age and suddenly anachronistic
in these early years of exploration into
the fourth dimension, via the power
electronics gives us to compress time.
One electronic tool, television, has
enabled all who watch it to be explorers
in time compression, and I stress “early
years.” While the self-liquidating Ameri-
cans try to get rid of the novel, after
sensing its faults, by unloading carts of
over-organic manure on to it, some of
the British prefer to use chloroformed
cottonwool for the job.
So Priestley begins his 27th novel,
“It was the end of a wet Monday after-
noon in autumn. Professor Cosmo Sul-
tana and Dr. Owen Truby were sitting
in the Small Lounge of Robinson’s
Hotel, Bayswater, London W 2. Robin-
son’s is one of the city’s few remaining
good old-fashioned hotels, known to
several generations of visitors for its
quaint inconveniences and quiet dis-
comfort.”
And on and on he rambles, his charac-
ters all talking quaintly and at length,
while he dispenses loving-care descrip-
tions of people and places. Sillitoe does
it, too. He’s more to be blamed than
Priestley, seven novels against 27 more
so. Sillitoe is almost aggressively
modern British lower middle-class com-
ing up and exposing the sham, but
where Ted Willis and Pinter do it
quickly and as effectively, Sillitoe’s way
will take a slow reader up to 20 hours
and a fast reader ten.
Sillitoe’s book, by the way, is the
second in a trilogy; Priestley’s the first
of three. Pincher, fortunately, makes no
similar threats. One of Britain’s best
science journalists, he has used his vast
knowledge to synthesise, in a novel,
trends which he may think dangerous
in his society. I cannot see any other
reason for the effort, resulting in a
tiring contemporary science thriller
much less likely to have public impact
than an article or series of articles in
the “Daily Express” under Pincher’s
name.
It strikes me as most odd that
Pincher should be more clearly aware
than either Priestley or Sillitoe of the
directions in which some pressures are
heading (in his book, toward a conflict
between a giant trade union of tech-
nologist-innovators and, finally, the doc-
tors it wants to absorb) and yet choose
to cast his novel in the same old cotton-
woolly terms. Wood for the trees,
perhaps.
The paradox is that while leisure time
is expanding, the increasing availability
of things to fill it—including those
“non-books” which teach us how, as
well as television that at least makes
us interested in more things than it
shows fully—forces the trend toward
time compression.
For publishers, apparently, to incite
writers to turn out not only very long
novels but trilogies of them may appeal
to the trade as the best way to use then-
established novelists for mutual profit,
but seems to me deadly to the novel
in the end.
One counter-force is the new lot of
writers who take to prose-and-picture
zestfully and make it possible for
British television to turn out an increas-
ing number of marvels of time com-
pressed through a good understanding
of what people already know and do
not need described in detail. Because
such new, widely seen, and easily
grasped things exert an influence, many
novelists and aspirants are reacting in
their various ways; some toward self-
extermination, others following leaders
into fantasy and symbolism, into
psychology, into sociology (probably the
new mineral lode for the realists); and,
I hope, into new experiments in telling
the story in ways both clear and accept-
able to readers in an age when time
becomes the vital dimension.
None of this suggests the death of
the novel to me, although it could mean
a hiatus while some readjustment takes
place, among publishers as well as
writers. The novel’s break with its
traditions may be as distinct as that of
Sillitoe ... chloroformed cottonwool
the movies when sound came, or when
television using movie tricks to hurriedly
feed a rapacious appetite forced another
change in that industry.
Meanwhile, awaiting, we have to con-
sider what the publishers serve up, and
here are short reviews of three of their
current offering:
Out of Town: Volume I of The Image
Men. T. B. Priestley. Heinemann.
$4.75.
Two expatriate British dons return
home, find the market for their talents
depressed, meet a British-American
woman left with millions to set up a
British end to hubby’s Sociological
Foundation but without a professor to
do the spadework, and over dinner at
Robinson’s the Institute of Social
Imagistics is born.
They install it at a willing out-of-
town College of Advanced Technology,
and the amusement continues as they
discover the possibilities of their inven-
tion in contemporary, confused Britain.
It’s all rather dim, and certainly distant,
fun, and whether the fact that it’s due
to be continued in two more novels is
a matter for eager anticipation or other-
wise is an open question.
A Tree on Fire. Alan Sillitoe. Mac-
millan. $3.85.
The second part of a trilogy of which
“The Death of William Posters” was the
first, it is Sillitoe’s celebration of Albert
Handley, a modern English yeoman,
fecund as a buck rabbit, a primitive
painter who can toss off a bottle of
Yugoslav red and tell his breed “the
world hasn’t got to be only lived in, be-
cause even if you keep yourself at a dis-
tance it will corrupt and destroy you by
forcing you to keep your distance, but it
has to be continually attacked, raided,
sabotaged, surrounded, plundered, in-
sulted, and spat on . . . The village may
not be ours by day, but it will be by
night. We can’t at the moment melt in


among the people like fish in water, but
after a few years the situation may be
different” without slurring a syllable.
Alas, poor novel!
The Giantkiller. Chapman Pincher.
Weidenfeld and Nicholson. $3.15.
Jack (“The Giantkiller”) Tasker leads
Britain’s mammoth union of technolo-
gists and is well on the way to adding
his name to history’s other dictators.
He needs the medical profession in his
membership. While he’s suborning its
most influential members, Professor
Sommerfeld is experimenting with his
Deprivation Chamber, designed to
brainwash criminals into useful citizens.
Tortuously these two strands come
together. At the end of the novel some-
one says, “Sanity is a mask which each
of us presents to the world. Behind it,
we are all deluded in differing degrees,
for nobody can entirely resist the human
need to retreat from reality.” Let’s hope
Chapman Pincher, journalist, can make
his comeback.
Permitted to blow a raspberry
BY PHILLIP ADAMS
Crimes of Passion. Joe Orton. Methuen.
$1.15.
Nathan and Tabileth, and Oldenberg.
Barry Bermange. Methuen. $1.30.
I’VE READ a great amount of tedious
academic prose on the Theatre of the
Absurd, ranging from learned interpre-
tations of the writings of such establish-
ment figures as Becket and lonesco to
commentaries on the younger writers,
like Pinter, Simpson, and Orton, in
which the existence of a mass culture
is rarely acknowledged, let alone given
any credit as an influence.
The academic, in dealing with the
Theatre of the Absurd, will often in-
volve Kafka and German Express-
ionism. The less inhibited might even
venture to mention Lear or Lewis Car-
roll. But none concedes any link be-
tween the school’s dramatic devices and
attitudes and, for example, the Marx
Brothers and Goon Shows. Yet while
academics ignore popular culture,
writers thrive on it, and relationships
between the serious writer and the en-
tertainer clearly do occur as in the
case of Patrick White and Barry
Humphries.
Isn’t it possible that Becket’s tramps
are related to Chaplin’s tramps in the
same way as The Cheery Soul is to
Mrs. Everage? That Groucho and
Harpo Marx provide some of the
inspiration for .Vladimir and Estragon?
Certainly the Marx Brothers used
Godot-style verbal confusions and in-
versions of logic and for much the
same reason. For they devised a theatre
of absurdities in the gloom of the
’thirties, just as the complex inanities
of the Goons reflected the anxieties of
the cold war.
Milligan’s cadaverous old couple, Min
and Henry, were mumbling loonily to
each other long before similar char-
acters by Pinter were unveiled. The
Goons grew hair on the dome of St.
Paul’s and had a million British boots
explode ten years before Orton’s wild
fancies were produced. And the Goons’
exuberant ridicule of concepts of
Orton ... wild goonish fancies
royalty and empire in a declining
Britain were at least contemporary with
Osborne’s. The idea of a Becket-Marx
or perhaps lonesco-Thurber association
is of course surmise. But Pinter and
his generation of young English writers
matured in an environment where the
liberating lunacy of Milligan, Sellers,
and Secombe formed almost as power-
ful a sub-culture among the young as
the current psychedelic cult.
Consequently, Joe Orton, who died
last year at the age of 33, owes a clear
debt to Milligan in “Crimes of Pas-
sion,” particularly in the second of the
double-bill’s plays, “The Erpingham
Camp.” This short and extremely
funny play concerns a Butlin-style holi-
day camp whose inmates are. encour-
aged to participate in organised fun
and games. However, under the direc-
tion of a kinky redcoat, the inmates
destroy and persecute on a Marat-Sade
scale, and the camp becomes the scene
of bloody revolution. On the simplest
level, the work is exuberant and in-
ventive nonsense. On another it is a
perceptive study of the nature of mani-
pulation and mass hysteria. Finally, the
holiday camp is a microcosm of
modern Britain.
The other play, “The Ruffian on the
Stairs,” involves a ridiculous crime of
passion, as improbable as Alf Gar-
nett being provoked to murderous jeal-
ousy by his Silly Old Moo. Methuen
have had the last laugh in the book by
printing two pages of the Lord Cham-
berlain’s goonish cuts. These were in-
sisted upon before the play’s produc-
tion at the Royal Court Theatre. “Piss
off” and similar fragments of dialogue
were expunged and even some of the
stage directions forbidden. However,
the Lord Chamberlain is not merely
destructive, and provided a list of
alternatives. For example, while Eileen
wasn’t allowed to mimic “a farting
noise” she was permitted to “blow a
raspberry.”
Bermange’s “Nathan and Tabileth”
are a Min and Henry couple who inter-
sperse their dialogue with observations
on their own movements and motives
another Milligan device often used
in the Goons. (“I consider her question.
My silence speaks for itself,” says
Nathan, and so on.) The couple are
visited by Bernie, who says he’s their
grandson, and, while they seem uncer-
tain that this is true, they spend the
evening discussing relatives which may
or may not be theirs.
Such plays, in which an elderly
couple are confronted with a newcomer
who is either ingratiating, threatening,
or both, are very common in modern
theatre. Pinter has written quite a few,
and Orton’s “The Ruffian on the Stair“
is of the genre. Bermange’s first exer-
cise is not distinguished, with the work
making conventional observations about
our tenuous grasp on reality, our loneli-
ness, and our conformity.
However, in Oldenberg, the Min and
Henry format comes to life with a
bang. The couple have decided, after
agonising debate, to rent the room of
their long-dead son, and await the new
tenant’s arrival with excitement He
will be their new son. But doubts grow
and the couple become agitated. His
name, Oldenberg, isn’t English. Perhaps
he’s a German? Or, worse, Jew? Sud-
denly in their lower-middle-class
passivity there are flashes of bitterness
and prejudice which intensify until
the sweet old couple turn into crazed
anti-semites.
They wreck the room they’ve pre-
pared so tenderly, and daub it with
swastikas and slogans, screaming their
hatred at the hypothetical Jew who has
yet to arrive. Finally the bell rings and
they open the door still shaking with
hysterical anger. However, the tenant
is not a Jew. He is English, and all they
could wish in a tenant or a son. And
as he is also blind they lead him into
the terrible, mutilated room. A play to
chill the cockles of the heart.
This edition is one of a “playscript”
series, devoted to new works, an excel-
lent innovation of Methuen’s.

Different honesty
By ALEXANDER CRAIG
Selected Poems. Elizabeth Bishop.
Chatto and Windus. $3.30.
FOR AT LEAST a couple of decades
now Elizabeth Bishop has been one of
the most important poets in the United
States—a Pulitzer Prize winner in 1955,
a profound influence on such writers
as her more famous contemporary
Robert Lowell. She has been admired
by many more poets for her individual
way of seeing things and for the kinds
of things she sees, “picking up the
unnoticed,” as Lowell has put it. She
possesses a particular sense for the
spirit of a place; she can also show a
kind of compassionate wit and an un-
sentimental human sympathy. It turns
out that her best poems are mostly her
best known, the ones previously featured
in American anthologies and magazines:
however, her work hasn’t been avail-
able at all in this country, so it’s good
to have a selection (from England) at
long last. Like Lowell, she is, I think,
an uneven poet (and who isn’t, I sup-
pose?), but, perhaps, I should add that
the tense, confessional qualities of some
of Lowell’s best poems aren’t usually
found in her writing. In her less suc-
cessful creations, she tends to be coolly
commonplace, to write pieces which
read a little like exercises—to compose
quatrains, say, with their second and
fourth lines rhyming, which are also
uninteresting technically. Fortunately,
such poems don’t come often during this
selection.
Elizabeth Bishop isn’t at all like such
relatively newer poets as James Wright
and Robert Bly, for example, Ameri-
cans who try to escape from the irony
that has been so characteristic in poetry
since the 19205, into a complete, naked
honesty of imaginative utterance. Her
honesty is of a different kind. She
doesn’t eschew irony, though using it
so subtly or gently, sometimes, that it’s
not immediately noticeable. She’s actu-
ally slightly old-fashioned, what we
might call a “mainstream” poet, even
if she may strike Australian readers—
such is the extreme conservatism of
most of our own poetry —as, at times,
startlingly modern. Her finest poetry
certainly moves on two or more levels,
but nearly always on a main level that
we find no difficulty in following. That
odd and beautiful poem “The Monu-
ment” is an excellent example of this.
She can write especially well about
the sea and its coastal regions, a rugged
north-eastern shore in Maine or what
she calls the “endless, sagging coast-
line” of Florida; and those Australian
poets long-windedly and repetitively
romanticising from their eastern,
southern, or western seaboards could
learn much from her more effective,
economical, and apparently literal
approach. I say “apparently,” because
frequently she’ll begin a poem almost
in the style of the more factual type of
tourist brochure—except for an edge
of poetic intensity and a choice of par-
ticular details that no guide-book would
include:
The air smells so strong of codfish
it makes one’s nose and one’s eyes
water.
Those two lines are from her well-
known poem “At the Fishhouses”: in
this, the atmosphere realistically builds
up, being even able to include anec-
dotal bits about an old Maine fisherman
and a humorous “Baptist” seal, until
it rises to the high, dark poetry of the
close. The sea looks “icily free above
the stones,” and
If you should dip your hand in,
your wrist would ache immediately,
your bones would begin to ache and
your hand would burn
as if the water were a transmutation
of fire
that feeds on stones and burns with
a dark grey flame.
If you tasted it, it would first taste
bitter,
then briny, then surely burn your
tongue.
It is like what we imagine knowledge
to be .. .
Another poem, “Cape Breton,” at
first appears to be exact, detailed des-
cription, but daylight ghosts start to
cling to its sharp, clear images and to
hover in Cape Breton’s thin mist, as
it ascends over the littorals, creating an
uneasy, gripping undertone. “The Bight”
seems closer to pure, objective observa-
tion, but here the subtitle “On My
Birthday” helps another dimension, as
“All the untidy activity continues,/awful
but cheerful.”
None of Elizabeth Bishop’s rhymed
poems and neither of her two sestinas
are as good as those where she takes
off, as it were, from the traditional
metres. In her successful pieces, she
sometimes comes close to writing “a
sort of free verse homing to the iambic
pentameter” (to borrow the words of an
Australian poet in another connection),
sometimes expanding and contracting
slightly a three-stress line as in “The
Fish,” which demonstrates very well
the precision and force of Elizabeth
Bishop’s best imagery. “I caught a tre-
mendous fish,” the poem begins: the
poet proceeds to describe him. Looking
“into his eyes” which “shifted a little
. . . not to return my stare” but “like
the tipping/of an object toward the
light,” she says they
were far larger than mine
but shallower, and yellowed,
the irises backed and. packed
with tarnished tinfoil
seen though the lenses
of old scratched isinglass.
From his bottom lip, “grim, wet,
and weaponlike,” hang “five big hooks/
grown firmly in his mouth” and broken,
green and black lines:
Like medals with their ribbons
frayed and wavering,
a five-haired beard of wisdom
trailed from his aching jaw.
The fish has become anthropomorphic
if you like, but man’s image both
slightly distorted and in a sharper focus.
“Selected Poems” is divided into three
main sections, one and two being set
in America. The Brazilian poems of the
first half of the last section include
some good pieces the very human
“Manuelzinho,” the vividly descriptive
“Electrical Storm,” for example; but
the seven poems of the second half fall
well below the level of the previous
ones. However, “Visits to St. Eliza-
beths,” a poem on Ezra Pound, which
closes the book, offers almost surreal
variations on “The House that Jack
Built” and a bit of rhythmic interest.


Ever been caught
by a boom ?
m
There has never been a time in Australia’s history when people have
been as wine conscious as they are now.
But the great upsurge in interest, coupled with a dry year, have created
shortages of many of the best wines Australia produces.
One of the things about a boom, when the goods are in short supply,
is that standards can slip.
Orlando’s standards will not slip.
For years, in anticipation, we have been thinking ahead - planting new
areas and new varieties, developing and exploring new techniques and
equipment - and we will continue to do so.
But even so, current demand has outstripped us.
If you find difficulty on occasion in obtaining your chosen Orlando
table wines, we hope you will remember that while we would like to take
advantage of the boom, we are utterly convinced that it is more
important to preserve the quality that has achieved such high
recognition of our wines at home and abroad.

THE AUSTRALIAN DREAM
The doorbell buzzed. It was past three
o’clock.
The steeple-of-Saint-Andrew’s weather-
cock
Cried silently to darkness, and my head
Was bronze with claret as I rolled from
bed
To ricochet from furniture. Light! Light
Blinded the stairs, the hatstand sprang
upright,
I fumbled with the lock, and on the
porch
Stood the Royal Family with a wavering
torch.
“We hope,” the Queen said, “we do
not intrude.
The pubs were full, most of our subjects
rude.
We came before our time. It seems the
Queen’s
Command brings only, ‘Tell the dead
marines!’
We’ve come to you.” I must admit I’d
half
Expected just this visit. With a laugh
That put them at their ease, I bowed
my head.
“Your Majesty is most welcome here,”
I said.
“My home is yours. There is a little bed
Downstairs, a boiler-room, might suit
the Duke.”
He thanked me gravely for it and he
took
Himself off with a wave. “Then the
Queen Mother?
She’d best bed down with you. There is
no other
But my wide bed. I’ll curl up in a
chair.”
The Queen looked thoughtful. She
brushed out her hair
And folded up The Garter on a pouf.
“Distress was the first commoner, and
as proof
That queens bow to the times,” she said,
“we three
Shall share the double bed. Please
follow me.”
I waited for the ladies to undress —
A sense of fitness, even in distress,
Is always with me. They had tucked
away
Their state robes in the lowboy; gold
crowns lay
Upon the bedside tables; ropes of pearls
Lassoed the plastic lampshade; their
soft curls
Were spread out on the pillows and they
smiled.
“Hop in,” said the Queen Mother. In I
piled
Between them to lie like a stick of
wood.
I could not find a thing to say. My
blood
Beat, but like rollers at the ebb of tide.
“I hope your Majesties sleep well,” 1
lied.
A hand touched mine and the Queen
said, “I am
Most grateful to you, Jock. Please call
me Ma’am.”

CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER:
Vintage in Australia commences in the
north and finishes in the south, in a
similar pattern to that experienced in
Europe. Temperature and sunlight are
the main determining factors, affecting
the vine from bud-burst in spring to
picking.
The Hunter River Valley is generally
the first major area to commence vin-
tage and Coonavvarra the last, although
this is affected to some extent by the
types of wines being made.
Our 1968 Hunter River dry whites and
reds have already been tasted and
classified, and the top whites are being
prepared for bottling. Winemaker Carl
Stockhausen is justly proud of his
efforts, with many outstanding whites
and an extremely good and uniform
range of reds. These latter are medium
coloured wines, with a delicate "‘earthy”
flavour, and show every promise of
being really great w'ines.
At our Rouge. Homme Vineyards and
Cellars at Coonawarra, S.A., our wine-
maker and manager, Phillip Laffer, has
just commenced his vintage. The Shiraz
and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes are in
excellent condition, fully ripe and with
plenty of colour, and Phillip now' has
the great satisfaction of seeing both
quality and quantity from his efforts,
as due to improved vineyard procedures
our crop was only slightly affected by
the severe spring frosts and the summer
drought.
At Co rowa our winemaker and mana-
ger, Ron Prince, is just finishing an
extremely difficult vintage. 1967 proved
to be the driest year in more than 75
years for Corowa-Rutherglen, and little
could be done at our “Felton” and
“Southern Cross” Vineyards to offset
this lack of rain and the searing heat
experienced in January and February
this year. Nevertheless, many very good
wines have been made.
I his month w e list some superb wTies
from our Corowa Cellars and will later
discuss these in more detail.

A rationale
for a
private bin
AS LONG AGO as November, 1963, I
wrote of cellar foundations and later
expanded on the subject in my book
“Cellarmaster’s Guide to Australian
Wines.” I was quite pleased with the
information given until yesterday.
In the large and rambling cellar of a
serious wine-student friend, we had
spent most of the day tasting a range
of Spanish wines (one very good one, a
Vina Zaco 1960 from the Bilbainas
Bodegas, _a well-balanced dry red of
good fruit and oak flavor) and a num-
ber of 1964 Australian Cabernet Shiraz
blends to see how they were going. It
had been an interesting and instructive
day.
Then I spotted a few cases of a par-
ticular white in a corner and told my
friend that he was mad. How could he
possibly get through the wine, I asked,
it was already losing its appealing fresh-
ness and delicacy, and was becoming
flat and almost coarse. It was an expen-
sive wine, too.
• “You recommended it,” he exploded.
“You said you liked it, so I bought
twenty dozen.”
Ye gods, the responsibility.
“Why don’t you do something about
it,” he went on. “Why don’t you tell us
how much wine to buy, as well as what
to buy.”
And when to blow his nose and get a
haircut?
I’ve often seen these overseas lists of
the id,eal cellar, and I’ve wondered how
they can be made. Obviously, tastes
vary so much and circumstances differ.
But my once-friend insists, so I shall
have to add something to my once-
satisfactory cellaring lore.
There is a large range of Australian
wine. I intend to restrict myself to it.
Just as I have never seen our wines
quoted in the French lists, I do not
intend to enumerate theirs. You could
go on and on. Anyway, only the pro-
fessional or the absolutely dedicated
wine student will attempt to look at
something of everything. Over the years
I have attempted to stock my cellar
with a truly representative selection,
even if I didn’t particularly like certain
wines. Yet there are serious gaps.
Which, I suppose, correspond to the
serious gaps in my bank balance. \
Because, - quite obviously, money is
another factor. While we may pretend
that it’s all an excellent investment—
heavens, the value of my wine has risen
three times in the past two years if the
auctions are any guide—don’t let’s kid
ourselves. The appreciated value of the
wine will slip down our throats just the
same.
If we could buy wines fully matured,
as we could years ago, the cellar would
merely be a store. Since we can’t, we
have to work out how long we intend
to keep the wine, and how much of it
we will drink over a certain time.
We may discount the fortified wines
right away. It is simply not necessarv
to cellar any of these wines, with the
exception of vintage port, and the lover
of a good sherry, tawny, or muscat is
a lucky man indeed.
There are lots of outstanding young
white wines around, and since many of
them depend on freshness for their
appeal there is no need to keep them
a long time. But many of us enjoy
developed whites, especially those from
Great Western and the Hunter Valley.
Since we rarely see many from the
former area these days we must com-
pete for those from the latter.
There is very little Hunter white
wine being sold of pre-1967 vintage.
Yet many of the wines of this vintage
will improve into a typical full-bodied
style of white burgundy. Recently a
Lindeman’s 2760 of 1965 won an Open
Gold as a white burgundy and will still
improve. So if you like this style you
now have to cellar some each year for
consumption in three or four years'
time. How much?
Let us assume you drink two bottles
of white wine at home per week. Mam-
people will immediately scoff and say
this is too little, but I do suggest that
you think cpiite hard about it. And if
you do drink more, simply multiply.
Two bottles per week is 104 bottles per
year. Of this a third may be undis-
tinguished. Pleasant light young wine
picked up for thoughtless drinking,
which is often a very good way to
drink wine: too much dedication can
destroy pleasure.
Another third may be of better
quality—Trammers, Frontignacs, Rhine
rieslings, and other flowery wines of
note, and some of the excellent trade
bottlings of chablis, white burgundy,
riesling, and so on. Some of these wines
do respond to some bottle age, but
most of them are best when young.
The remaining third is devoted to
maturing white. That is about three
dozen consumed a year. Since we can
no longer buy old whites we have to
mature them ourselves. For three to
four years? Therefore we need to build
up to about nine to 12 dozen on hand
and thereafter a purchase of three
dozen per year.
Add the two or three dozen bits and
pieces for everyday consumption and
fresh drinking, and a figure of 15 dozen
may be reached. Which is a lot of white
wine for two bottles a week.
What about the reds? I would sug-
gest that we would like almost all of
our serious red drinking to be of mature

wine. If we get through three bottles a
week, which is 13 dozen or 26 gallons
per year, we need a fair stock.
There are a few ’64s around at the
moment, a lot of ’6ss, and even some
’66s. Most reasonable red wine benefits
from at least four years in the bottle,
so a mean home-cellar maturation time
could be about three years. Which
means a stock level of at least 40 dozen
red wine, the new wine being purchased
as the mature wine is consumed. And
this for only three bottles of red per
week.' Many of my friends claim to get
through—dinner parties, tastings, tele-
vision, and weekends included—at least
nine bottles of red per week. And a 120
dozen wine costs a lot of money.
Back to the 40 dozen. Where should
it come from? Five dozen from the
Hunter means you may only enjoy this
style of wine about once a month. Yet
if you allow more you miss out on so
many other areas.
You need at least five from Coona-
warra and another five from McLaren
Vale. More from the Barossa, and what
about Clare and N.E. Victoria? I would
hate to see any cellar without at least
a couple of dozen Tahbilk reds; then
there is Reynella and Langhorne Creek
and Western Australia and Great Wes-
tern and the River areas and all the
new plantings. And what about the
company blends? The Mildara wines
that no one should ever miss, the Pen-
folds estate and blended reds, the
Thomas Hardy multi-mixes, and the
Lindeman blends. Many of these are of
outstanding quality and are among the
top wines of Australia.
So my point is evident. I cannot tell
you how many you should have of each.
It is up to your own palate requirement.
Your three bottles of red a week means
a stock of 40 dozen in the cellar. Play
around with that stock how you will.
If your consumption is higher and
your tastes catholic, you will need more.
And you must be careful. A certain
wine fever can set in that leads to all
sorts of heavy buying without great
thought. (Witness my friend and his
coarsening white.) The wine is so good
you must have some. If you don’t it
will be all gone. But this is done with-
out thought as to how and when it will
be consumed.
Yet it is agreeable to taste all the
different styles and areas and varieties.
I am working on a master plan which
demands that my friends specialise. One
is developing his vintage port cellar
and looks to us to show him matured
reds. When we need a bottle or two of
vintage port, then a swop is made.
Another wealthy mate has a Bordeaux
collection, and I am ever free to offer
him a learned opinion at any time. I
am working on another who likes the
Mildara Cabernet Shiraz blends. I am
suggesting he buys up big every year
so that he always has more than he
needs. Victorian connections may join
the syndicate with their old stocks of
Tahbilk, Great Western, and N.E. Vic-
torian wines. It could go on.
In fact, there may come a day when
one may not need a cellar at all.

Making managers at Monash
In Brian Hoad’s “Making Managers’’
(8., April 6) it was stated that Monash
is “on the threshold” of doing some-
thing about courses in administration.
Your readers may be interested to know
that the threshold was crossed early this
year.
A Master of Administration program
was set up at Monash last year, and in
this, its first year of operation, 50
students have been admitted and
enrolled. There were some 110 appli-
cants. Considering the relative lack of
publicity surrounding the inauguration
of the program, the large and well-
qualified group of applicants augurs
well for the future.
It might also be of interest to
observe that the Master’s degree is
especially designed to cater for all types
of administrative needs, including busi-
ness and public administration, and, fur-
ther, that instead of setting up a separate
and small department to look after the
program the Faculty of Economics and
Politics as a whole stands behind it. In
this way we hope to obtain the maxi-
mum benefit from the specialised know-
ledge of the various professors and
supporting staff in the Faculty.

Wine-drinking solicitors

Indonesia-Australia joint
industry
Apropos “Shifting Stances" (8., April
13), there is urgent need for an up-to-
date reappreciation of the South-East
Asia scene and for a new and positive
move, made independently of others. It
becomes clear that a first and urgent
step is to initiate planning to build up
Indonesia's economy. What is to prevent
us, under adequate safeguards, from set-
ting up an Australian-Indonesian joint
industrial complex within Indonesia,
utilising Indonesia’s vast labor force


when sufficiently trained, and Aus-
tralian materials?
The intention would be, at the out-
set, to turn out light industrial products
and advance from that stage as oppor-
tunity presented, manufacturing primar-
ily for re-export to world markets. In
this way, dually purposeful, we could
overcome our domestic and now in-
superable cost barrier and give material
aid to Indonesia, at the same time
extracting the maximum economic
benefit from our own primaries rather
than permit them to be so exploited by
other overseas users, as now.
The first project that comes to mind
is to reprocess Mt. Isa’s refined copper;
aluminium goods follow, then perhaps
pig-iron, even steel, employing Aus-
tralian ores and coal if suitable fuel is
unavailable in Indonesia. A promising,
strategically favorable locale might be
Tjilatjap, on the south coast of Java.

Tariff rates
J. C. Horsfall (8., April 6) speaks
of “. . . imperial preferences, which,
over a large range of capital goods
at present, means that while Japan has
to jump a 45 to 50 percent tariff wall
British goods merely have to step over
one of percent at most .. .”
Would Mr. Horsfall kindly name a
few of the items in the “large range
of capital goods” where the British
preferential rate is not more than
1\ percent, while the ordinary rate is
45 to 50 percent? In fact, the 1\ percent
is a preferential margin given by Aus-
tralia in return for the privileged entry
of Australian goods into the British
market.

Australia and the bomb
I must question some of the views
expressed in “Australia and the bomb”
(8., March 30). First, it seems to me
unnecessarily alarmist to suggest, as
you do, that uranium is no longer
needed as a raw material for the
manufacture of nuclear bombs. There
is a possibility that hydrogen bombs
can be constructed without the usual
uranium or plutonium trigger once the
severe technical difficulties are over-
come. The U.S. Atomic Energy Com-
mission said last year that they were
working on the problem; neither they
nor their Russian counterparts have ever
claimed to have solved it. It seems
hardly likely that any other nuclear
power, let alone a non-nuclear power,
has come anywhere near solving it.
To say that there is no longer any
need for the testing of an atomic
bomb may be correct in the narrow
sense that the nuclear scientists of a
technologically advanced country will
certainly feel very confident about their
product. It is unlikely that the
country’s military will see matters in
the same light. They will exert very
strong pressure for the testing of an
instrument of war upon which the
country’s military posture is likely to
be based, being loath, understandably,
to tolerate the slightest uncertainty
that it may not, in the end, go off.

Backing away ...
An Englishman visiting Australia, I
found “Backing away from Britain”
(B., Eeb. 17), some of your recent com-
ments on Britain’s withdrawal east of
Suez, and the tone of Prime Minister
Gorton’s pleas that Australia is a small
nation and thus cannot have an inde-
pendent foreign policy interesting
evidence of the thoroughly surprising
lack of a sense of national independence
and self-respect in Australia.
For Australia’s psychiatric good she
should become a republic, by proclama-
tion, without any reference to Special
Acts of the Parliament of Westminster,
finally n-pealing the last vestige’ of
colonial status.

Whose gerrymander?
I would like to question the sin-
cerity of Premier Dunstan when he
calls for a voting system which allows
for one-vote-one-value. He is the
leader of a Party whose supreme State
body allows the unions to have 75
percent of the delegates to the State
ALP conference, and the branches 25
percent. Not satisfied with this im-
balance, a system of voting called the
card vote allows the 75 percent of the
delegates to exercise 93 percent of the
votes, and leaves the ALP branches
with seven percent. The card vote is
invariably used when candidates for
Parliament are selected, the State
executive is elected, and when the
delegates to the Federal ALP are
chosen. In fact, the delegates from
three of the largest trade unions can
outvote the delegates from the remain-
ing fiO-odd trade unions and all of the
ALP branches. This system of voting

also serves as a very effective waddy
to thwart any proposals for its aboli-
tion. A more effective gerrymander
than this defies imagination.

Sydney's Pylon Lookout
I refer to an article (8., April 13)
headed “Up on the Pylon things are
very run down” by one Daphne Guin-
ness. Inaccurate in substance, it is
couched in a facetious, vulgar journalese
(e.g., mebee, jools, nuffink, bleedin’) to
which only an inferior writer would
have recourse. The use of Christian
names of staff in this context is both
discourteous and reprehensible, signi-
fying a cockney approach to an Aus-
tralian subject totally unacceptable to
your readers.
The title of the article, “Up on the
Pylon things are very run down,” is
false, libellous, derogatory, and calcu-
lated to prejudice the operation of a
legitimate business. My staff and I
deeply resent the cynical and insidiously
destructive tone of the article and it
is incomprehensible that the pro-
Australian, allegedly intellectual Bulle-
tin should debase its standards to pub-
lish such rubbish.

Violence
Your article, “Violence In Australia’*
(8., April fi) gave a fairly accurate
picture of the state of things in this
country. Compared to many others, we
are lucky, especially as regards mob
violence. But I think it would be
irresponsible of us to be complacent
whilst we read the overseas headlines.
But your summary of violence in Aus-
tralia and a number of factors in its
increase might have dealt more fully
with the causes, e.g., irresponsible mass
media (especially news-reporting), the
psychological aspect, and the lack of
any worthwhile purpose' in life due, I
think, to uninspired education.
Perhaps we need a program to pre-
vent violence in future generations. I
think we have a chance in Australia
to develop a realistic, peaceful, and
purposeful society. I wonder if we will
succeed?

boards” fit over the original timber or
fibro need so little care. Aluminium
won’t absorb water. Won’t warp, chip, rot,
crack, or rust. Won’t do any of the things
that shorten the life of a paint job.
Aluminium siding comes in attractive
colours, all fade-free, tough, long-lasting.
The satiny sheen gives your property a

your investment.
Aluminium siding keeps the house cooler
