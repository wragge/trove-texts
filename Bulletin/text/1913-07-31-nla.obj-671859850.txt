CAUTION.—The large sale for “Eumentool

tions being manufactured under the name of
menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying, to be sure and get
HUDSON’S “Eumenthol Jujubes.” You may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told they
are “just as good” as Hudson’s “Eumenthol
Jujubes.” This proves that these imitations
and substitutes have no reputation of their
own, and can only be sold on the good repute
and high character of Hudson’s “Eumenthol
Jujubes.”

Poems by the Poet-Laureate
/ have loved flowers that fade,
Within whose magic tents
Rich hues have marriage made
With sweet unmemoried scents:
A honeymoon delight—
A joy of love at sight,
That ages in an hour:
My song he like a flower!
I have loved airs, that die
Before their charm is writ
Along a liquid sky
Trembling to welcome it.
Notes, that with pulse of fire
Proclaim the spirit's desire,
Then die, and are nowhere:
My song he like an air!
Die. song, die like a breath,
And wither as a bloom:
Fear not a flowery death,
Dread not an airy tomb!
Fly with delight, fly hence!
’Twas thine love's tender sense
To feast; now on thy bier
Beauty shall shed a tear.
O flesh and blood, comrade to tragic pain
And clownish merriment; whose sense could
wake
Sermons in stones, and count death but an
ache,
All things as vanity, yet nothing vain:
The world, set in thy heart, the passionate
strain
Reveal'd anew; but thou for man didst make
Nature twice natural, only to shake
Her kingdom with the creatures of thy brain.
Lo, Shakespeare, since thy time nature is
loth .
To yield to art her fair supremacy;
In conquering one thou hast so enriched both.
What shall I say? for God> —whose wise
decree
Confirmeth all He did by all He doth —
Doubled His whole creation making thee.
My delight and thy delight
Walking, like two angels white,
In the gardens of the night:
My desire and thy desire
Twining to a tongue of fire,
Leaping live, and laughing higher;
Through the everlasting strife
In the mystery of life.
Love, from whom the world begun,
Hath’the secret of the sun.
Love can tell, and love alone,
Whence the million stars were strewn,
Why each atom knows its own,
How, in spite of woe and death,
Gay is life, and sweet is breath:
This he taught us, this we knew,
Happy in his science true,
Hand in hand as we stood
'Neath the shadows of the wood.
Heart to heart as we lay
In the dawning of the day.
The fabled sea-snalce, old Leviathan,
Or else what grisly beast of scaly chine
That champ'd the oeean-wrack and swash'd
the brine,
Before the new and milder days of man,
Had never rib nor bray nor swingeing fan
Like his iron swimmer of the Clyde or Tyne,
Late-born of golden seed to breed a line
Of offspring swifter and more huge of plan.
Straight is her going, for upon the sun
When once she hath look'd, her path and
place are plain;
With tireless speed she smiteth one by one
The shuddering seas and foams along the
main;
And her eased breath, when her wild race is
run,
Roars through her nostrils like a hurricane.
So sweet love seemed that April morn,
When first we kissed beside the thorn,
So strangely sweet, it was not strange
We thought that love could never change.
But I can tell —let truth be told—
That love with change in growing old;
Though day by day is nought to see,
So delicate his motions be.
And in the endtwill come to pass
Quite to forget what once he was.
Nor even in fancy to recall
The pleasure that was all in all,
His little spring, that sweet we found,
So deep in summer floods is drowned,
I wonder, bathed in joy complete.
How love so young could be so sweet.
From “The Poetical Works of Robert
Bridges’’ (Oxford University Press, 25.).
A murder mystery, bushrangers, the gold-
fields of the ’s()’s, and a girl assist Don
Delaney to maintain the reader’s interest in
For Turon Gold, the latest N.S.W. shilling
publication. Don Delaney confesses to the
authorship of three other “Bookstall” books,
which, for those who like “Bookstall” books,
is sufficient recommendation.
The one-act plays selected as the best in
the recent competition on this page have
now been submitted to the Melb. Repertory
Theatre, the Adelaide Literary Theatre, and
the newly formed Repertory Theatre, Syd-
ney. The sole result is the production
by. the Melb. organisation of Dyson’s “The
Climax.” The Adelaide Literary "Theatre
did not care for any of the plays ; but it is
possible that one of the one-acters will be
produced by the Sydney Repertory Theatre.
Robert Bridger
[?] 1912
This dear old gentleman in the Bedfordian
hat is Robert Bridges, George’s new l’oet-
Laureate. Though but 69 years old, he has
practically retired from the poetry business.
Some nine years ago he took the conclusive
step of bundling together all the poems and
dramas and notes —Bridges is strong on
Notes —made during his long life, and dump-
ing them into what the Literary Year Book
curtly calls Coll. Poet. Works. The Uniform
Edition of Robert Bridges’ Poetical Works,
in six completed volumes and a seventh, in
preparation, can be acquired for 6s. a vol-
ume from Smith, Elder. And the Poetical
Works of Robert Bridges, excluding the
eight dramas, is now published by the Oxford
University Press for 2s. It certainly looked
as if the old gentleman had ordered his poeti-
cal coffin, and had settled down to prose. And
now the poor man will be liable to be rung
up on the ’phone at any hour of the night,
and ordered to prescribe an ode or an elegy
for his boss. The appointment suggests
that there ought to be a retiring age for
poets, and certainly for poet-laureates. In
the civil service this age is fixed at 65 years.
If that is the retiring age of poet-laureates
the old gentleman should be courteously re-
minded that he has been working four years’
overtime. If he refused to resign he might
be asked to produce as evidence for the
defence all the world-famous poems written
by poets over 60.
The selection of Bridges is at first sight
a surprise, and this Page herewith tenders
to “Bellerive” its sincerest condolences.
Kipling, Noyes, Trench, “Bellerive,” Stephen
Phillips, Watson, Masefield —men of these
qualities passed over for a Bridges! But
it is no business of ours, and, indeed, it is
but impertinence on our part to object to
another man choosing his own servants.
And a closer inspection of Bridges shows
that no apter choice of a poet-laureate for a
modern king could have been made —always
excepting “Bellerive.” Bridges has had his
eye on the jobt He has certificates of the
professional ode to show: —
REGINA CARA.
(Jubilee-song, for Music, 1897.)
Hark! The world is full of thy praise,
England’s Queen of many days;
Who, knowing how to rule the free,
Hast given a crown to monarchy.
Honor, Truth and growing Peace
Follow Britannia’s wide increase,
And Nature yield her strength unknown
To the wisdom born beneath thy throne!
In wisdom and love firm is thy fame:
Enemies bow to revere thy name:
The world shall never tire to tell
Praise of the Queen that reigned well.
O felix anima, Domina prceclara,
Amove sempre coronabere
Regina car a.
However, the Boer War showed that
Bridges could do even better than that: —
PEACE ODE.
(On conclusion of the Boer War, 1902.)
Now, joy in all hearts with happy auguries,
And praise on all lips: for sitnny June
cometh
Chasing the thick warcloud, that outspread
Sulfurous and sullen over England.
Full thirty moons since unwilling enmity,
Since daily suspense for hideous peril
Of brethren unrescued, beleaguer’d
Plague-stricken in cities unprovided,
Had quencht accustom’d gaiety, from the day
When first the Dutchman’s implacable folly,
The country of Shakespeare defying,
Thought with a curse to appal the
nation:
Whose threat to quell their kinsmen in
Africa
Anger’d awhile our easy democracy;
That, reckless and patient of insult,
Will not abide arrogant defiance:
They called to arms; and war began evilly.
From slily forestor’d, well-hidden armories,
And early advantage, the despot
Stood for a time prevalent against us:
Till from the coil of slow-gathering battle
He rancorous, with full moneybags hurried,
Peddling to European envy
His traffic of pennyworth slander ....
Came jrom tne swarming counties accoutr-
ing,
And misty highlands of Caledonia,
With Cambria's half-Celtic offspring,
And the ever-merry fighting Irish:
Came too the new world’s hardy Canadians,
And from remote Australia champions
Like huntsmen, and from those twin
islands
Lying off antipodal beyond her....
Wherefore to-day one gift above every gift
Lee us beseech that God will accord w her
L England]
Always a right judgment in all things;
Even to celestial excellencies;
And grant us in long peace to accumulate
Joy, and to stablish friendliness and com-
merce,
And barter in markets for unpriced
Beauty, the pearl of unending empire.
It may be mentioned in defence that the
Peace Ode was written in "quantitative”
verse ; it is one of his many experiments in
classical prosody ; for in questions of pros-
ody Bridges is much interested, and he
even formulated rules for the writing of
“stress” verse. But the point of view in
both poems proves that Bridges has the
qualities of grovel and jingoism necessary
for the post. He was wise in not adding
poetry to these qualities; for he knew that
nowadays the only poet who can do without
poetry is the poet-laureate. Yet in another
aspect Bridges is the most suitable choice:
there is in all his work no expression that
would bring the blush of shame to the cheek
of a platypus. There is no frankness, 'no
disconcerting passion, no rude virility.
Bridges can be read by any young person or
young princess. His works may lie unblush-
ingly in the drawing-room of the most wan-
ton of Wowsers. No poem of his would dis-
agree with the stomach of the frailest book-
worm. And, finally, he is 69. His boss
knows him; he knows that his employee
won’t do anything unexpected. When a
poet has been discreet for 69 yeafs, he is not
likely to start blaspheming at 70. Failing
“Bellerive,” Bridges is an admirable choice.
As to his verse, the “Masks in the Greek
Manner” and his experiments in classical
prosody need not be considered by the lover
of poetry. In his shorter poems
Again shall pleasure overflow
Thy cup with sweetness, thou shalt taste
Nothing but sweetness, and shalt grow
Half sad for sweetness run to waste.
But Robert Bridges is a prosodist rather
than a poet. In all his work there is a
meticulous care for sounds. A dissonance or
a false accentuation is rare. One feels that
he cares more for sounds than for sense,
more for what he makes the inward ear hear
than for what he makes the mind feel. His
range is strictly limited : he is quite decor-
ously and dully classical —a minor William
Watson. He possesses the special qualities
of dullness and frigidity for which his pre-
decessor, Alfred Austin, the Good, was
chosen ; but he differs from Austin in being,
in addition, a quite respectable poet. His
masterly technique is not infrequently
warmed by a gentlemanly inspiration. He
sometimes obtains a Wordsworthian sim-
plicity, without the Wordsworthian univer-
sality of anneal. In brief. Wordsworth in a
tea-cup. This is the sort of thing he does
quite well: —
The upper skies are palest blue
Mottled with pearl and fretted snow:
With tattered fleece of inky hue
Close overhead the storm-clouds go. __
Their shadows fly along the hill
And o'er the crest mount one by one:
The whitened planking of the mill
Is now in shade and now in sun.
As a poet-laureate he can scarcely be
called gay. He is dreadfully addicted to
Elegies. One feels that on public occasions
Briuges will entwine crepe with his crown of
laurel leaves, and that the only part of his
official duties that he will really enjoy will
be writing, in black kid gloves, elegies on
a dead royalty or a moribund empire. Some-
thing, for instance, like this “Elegy Among
the Tombs,” of which the first stanza crawls:
Sad, sombre place, beneath whose antique
yews
I come, unquiet sorrows to control;
Amid thy silent mossgrown graves to muse
M'ith my neglected solitary soul;
And to poetic sadness care confide,
Trusting sweet Melancholy for my guide.
The poet-laureateship has, with but few
exceptions, always been a joke. This time
it looks like being a mausoleum. The
modern qualifications for the job are: (1)
The publication of enough books of verse to
enable one to produce a collected edition;
(2) an Oxford degree; (3) the ability to
keep alive till over 60; (4) the capacity to
write pleasing and painless verse; (5) the
cleverness to avoid making enemies; (6)
loyalty; (7) a safe keeping within the limits
of the classical tradition in poetry, with as
many references to Greek Mythology as can
be crowded in ; and (8) the ability to describe
Maoriland as : Those twin islands, Lying off
antipodal beyond her," her being Australia.
Now you see why “Bellerive” came only
second.
“Gouger” denies that the bushman of to-
day is a literary degenerate. “For years I
have travelled all over outback N.S.W. Rnd
Queensland, and have never yet seen a Dead-
wood Dick in a bushman’s hut or camp, and
very few of Nat Gould’s. Of writers such as
Dyson, Lawson, Ambrose Pratt, Victor
Daley, Becke, Bedford, Ogilvie, I have hardly
come to an Outback camp yet without meet-
ing some of their books. And well-known
English writers, such as Conan Doyle and
H. G. Wells, such books as are frequently
criticised in the ‘Red Page’ itself, are very
numerous. As for the Arrow and the
Hawklet, their best circulation is in Syd-
ney and Broken Hill. ‘Hardgraft’ most
likely saw an emigrant purchasing one of
those publications a»t the railway station
en route to a five-bob-a-week job up country.
And when bushmen get a good book they
read it, or, rather, digest it. As to the bush-
man being a different personality to the
bushman of yore, that is on a par with cer-
tain people who swear The Buixetin is
not what it used to be.”
t • > -i- . . y
Anatole France's latest book. The Uods,
are Athirst (Lane), lacks' this author’s,
genial irony, the light touch of his humor, his
mocking philosophy of cynicism. The hor-
x-or of the French Revolution has over-
powered him; and this story is but a record
of the Terror. In Gamelin, an artist stu-
dent, France finds his hero. The pool*
painter becomes a juryman of the Revolu-
tionary Tribunal, his duty being to condemn
to the guillotine the enemies of the Republic.
Being a serious and moral and patriotic
young man —in brief, a Wowser —he con-;
scientiously condemns to death even his own
friends. Gamelin, however, has his human;
sentiments, and arrahges the guillotining of
an innocent young man. whom he thought
he had identified as the seducer of Gamelin’s
mistress. France paints with great skill the
psychology of this ordinary young mau, who
has for his dreadful duties the fervor of a
religious fanatic. The gods were athirst,
and Gamelin gave them enough blood to
drink. In the end his own turn came, and
Gamelin reflected that he died justly, since
he has been too sparing in the pouring out
of blood for the Republic. Robespierre him-
self, he thought, had been martyred because
of his mercifulness. And his mistress, after
his death, invited his successor to her room
in exactly the same words that she had used
to Gamelin. Thus Anatole France implies
that life goes on, and that The Terx-or and
the guillotine do not so much matter. It is
a pitiable story, filled with vignettes of
pathos and of a tear-dimmed gaiety; but
the impression it leaves is that of implac-
able fate, of the flowing on of events that
the human element was not able to control.
In the guise of fiction Anatole France has
written the psychology of the Revolution.
W. H. Koebel has produced books upon
most of the South American States —in fact,
he may be termed the white hope of that
triangular continent. Now in Modern Chile
(Bell, per W. Dymock) he tackles that long
strip on the Pacific Coast —our nearest
neighbor across the Pacific Pond —which
comes most closely to Euclid’s definition
of a line —length without breadth. This
book is merely a sojourner’s descriptive
impressions, and, as such, of small literary
value. Yet he conveys an attractive impres-
sion of the White Man of South America,
the Chilian. He is the least of the
lot. “The proportion of fair-eomplexioned
and blue-eyed men belonging to the middle
and upper classes is, I imagine, considerably
in excess of that which obtains in Spain.
The stature of the Chilian, moreover, corres-
ponds with that of the Northern European
rather than with that of the Latin nations
in that continent.” Climate and the boast
that the Chilian strain, in these classes, has
practically remained free from admixture
furnish adequate reasons. The general ap-
pearance of the majority of the better-class
Chilians resembles that of the English to a
quite unusual degree; and the Chilians
claim that they are the English of South
America. But their navy, and their naval
history, furnish, perhaps, a more valid title
to that claim. We learn that both the naval
and military forces are now efficient to a
remarkable degree. Then the Republic own*
its own railways, and, like Australia, ven-
tures into other “socialistic” enterprises.
But there are not mahy more than three
millions of Chilians. And to Chili has e-me,
as to Argentina, that utterly non-existent
bogey, the American beef-trust, “with a view
to staying for good.” And Koebel believes
that the result of the struggle between South
America and the beef-trust, which we have
been assured by the Liberal press does not
exist, will be “the entire control of the South
American beef market by the United States.”
It seems a rather strenuous bogey.
The Fifth Vol. of J. H. Maiden’s The
Forest Flora of Iy.S.W. is completed by the
issue of the 50th part. To the average reader
the most interesting feature of this part is
the fine series of photographic reproductions
of various specimens of our trees.

The Inky Way.
Young Dennis Connelly, a Melbourne boy who
studied painting, but inclined to black and white,
promises to make his mark in London as a carica-
turist with a style of his own. Many young black
and white artists fail to carry their touch of indi-
viduality into the front rank of craftsmen, but Con-
nelly has stuff in him, and may do big things anon.
* * * *
English journalists are contemplating dreadful
things, too. The Central (London) branch of the
National Union of Journalists has been discussing
a proposal to enter into a working agreement with
the typographical societies; and, though it was
decided, after a long debate, that the project was
premature at present, Manchester (the next largest
branch) has carried a resolution approving of it.
“Do we blame the skunk for its smell, or the
snake for its sting? God made everything for some
purpose, the newspaper man with the rest.” — H. H.
Bancroft, historian, of California, on the corrupt
press of the U.S.A.
* * * »
“Rob”: The new evening daily, which is to intro-
duce a little variety into the Inky W a y of Christ-
church (M.L.), will be published in December or
January next. It is to be called the Sun, and will,
it is understood, give general support to the Massey
Government. The editor will be “Teddy” Huie, an
able youngster who broke away from the Christchurch
Press (he edited the evening edition) principally
because he didn’t like the Tory journal’s dour Bible-
in-schools ideas. Huie battled with great deter-
mination to get together a company to finance the
new paper, and eventually won. J. H. Dolamore,
for whom the Gore Ensign earns good dollars, has
beeii appointed managing-director, and is putting in
some vigorous preparatory work;
Item from the Revelations of W. H. Donald, the
well-known Australian pressman, representing the
New York Herald in Pekin, in a recent letter to a
Sydney friend: “I see Dr. Morrison daily, and he
does not know whether to be tired of his job or not.
He has a hard time of it. Advice is easy to give;
the Chinaman listens to advice, but will do what
he thinks he wants to do. Morrison feels that, fre-
quently. During the Revolution, he asked me, in
Shanghai, why I did not enter the service of the
Government. They were then offering me £250 a
month. My reply was that, once a man entered the
paid service of a Chinese his influence was gone.
Morrison Scoffed —now he admits it ; Bitter proof.
As Times correspondent he had twice the prestige
and three times the influence.”
“Phosphene": In these diys Of identification pdr
medium Of finger prints, th(? old rough-and-ready
methods of spotting a “wanted” person by the color
of his socks, by the hysterical pronouncement of r
woman who picks him from six men lined up for her
inspection in the watchhouse, or by the scar on the
bridge of his nose, are falling into what O. Henry
used to call “innocuous desuetude.” Every news-
paper roundsman has seen some quaint attempts at
identification in his time, and has heard some rash
attempts by witnesses to fit the man to the event.
“I knoo ’im by 'is ’arty larf,” and “I spotted ’im by
his cross eyes, which ’q was wipin’ With a dprbn wot
me sister giVb 'itn for 'is mother Wen ’e was keepiri’
company with ’er,” are two that I remember hearing
in Melbourne City Court. This was in the old build-
ing formerly the Supreme Court, where Ned Kelly
was tried. That has been superseded by what the
papers call “a Gothic Pile,” and, presumably, the
architecture of the evidence has changed with its
habitat. About the best identifleatory effort to date,
however, was made by a witness in an English court,
quoted, by Professor Stout in his “Groundwork of
Psychology” (a Melbourne University text-book).
Stout instances a man who “recognised his assailant
by the illumination caused by the blow inflicted by
him upon the witness.” That witness had taken
Emerson’s advice, and had “hitched his waggon to a
star.”
* * * *
In W. J. Locke’s new novel, “Stella Maris,” the
unsophisticated girl who is passing her youth bound
to a couch by spinal complaint, asks her favorite
John Risca what exactly is his work. He replies:
“I teach the great and good men who are the King’s
Ministers of State how to govern the country. I
show philanthropists how to spend their money. I
read many books and tell people how beautiful and
wise the books are, so that people should read them
and become beautiful and wise, too. Sometimes I
preach to foreign sovereigns on the way in which
their countries should be ruled. I am what is called
a journalist, dear.”
“It must be the most wonderful work in the
world,” cries Stella, aglow with enthusiasm, “and
they must pay you lots and lots of money.”
“Lots and lots.”
“And how you must love it —the work, I mean ?”
“Every hour spent in the newspaper office is a
dream of delight,” says Risca.
Walter Herold, who happens to be present during
this conversation, remarks, with a shake of his head,
as soon as they have left the room: —
“God forgive you, John, for an amazing liar!”
“He will,” says Risca, “if He has a sense of
humor.”
The bitter cry of Mrs. Philistine:—
Oh, the futility of afternoon tea ! If you are a
woman and* are affluent enough to own a drawing-
room and an At Home day, you can’t go to see an
acquaintance without being assailed by the tea-tray.
You don’t want it. You don’t go visiting with a
begging bowl like a monk of the Yellow Robe. You
get three good square meals at home, and find your
liver and internal arrangements work better for a
rest. Maybe you even hate tea. But you dare not
openly profess to be a simple liver who doesn’t
want the cup that is supposed to cheer, or your
hostess would be aggrieved and think you suspected
her of poisoning you. And if you were hungry, what
good would a 2 x 1 transparent wafer and a gill of
lukewarm tea in a porcelain cup be to you? I
know these things must be—like skirts and hairpins
and corsets and the Legislative Council; but ’tis
a pity. A woman has no longer to live than a man,
yet, I suppose, in her life she spends about five years
more doing her hair, her corsets sap about 10 per
cent, of her vitality, skirts hamper her nether
activity another five per cent., and she spends about
five times more hours lapping tea she has no use
for than her husband spends in a bar. As the
French fight bloodless duels and cry “Honor is
satisfied,” so woman serves this imitation meal (or
harasses her maid into doing it), and thinks “Hos-
pitality is satisfied.” What a sham 1 What a
waste!
A PRESSMAN’S MOAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is reported that the vaccination with an abnor-
mally large number of Drivately- treated people did
not “take.”— Neus item.
I have no heart for work. My body aches;
My head is burning, and my brain is mud;
The friends I have are suffering from shakes,
Because of cowpox rampant in -their blood*
I sniff and sneeze; neuralgia stabs my jaw;
I doze at work —yet cannot sleep in bed.
I am the worst d —d wreck you ever saw
(Excuse me While I groan and hold my head).
I have a friend whose cheek still has a flush,
Whose step is springy, and whose eye’is bright.
He does not shrink aside from any crush;
Yet he complains he’s not been treated right!
He env.es me, the fool! With jealous eyes
He watches when with cruel chills I’m shaken.
“Oh, you’re all right!” the gloating ruffian cries.
“You lucky cowl Your vaccination’s ‘taken’l”

When Weaning Baby
The Beat Food to give is
The ‘Allenburys’ Milk Food No. 1.
On the addition of water as directed, it forms an accurately estimated
' humanised milk, and may be given alternately with the natural food
without fear of upsetting the child or causing digestive disturbance.
Weaning can therefore proceed gradually with comfort both to mother
and child. Farinaceous foods should not be given at this time.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Woman Made for Sin.
Sure my life is like the dead tree
With not a leaf at all,
And from month’s end to month’s end —-
It whitens to its fall.
For at night I do be dreaming
Of the strong man I would wed,
Of the pledge of love he gave me,
And the loving words he said.
When the neighbors come for gossip
It’s salt tears I would be at;
For it’s little them I welcome
With their talk of this and that.
But I wear the smile upon me
Though it’s hurt I am within,
And sour of heart with thinking
Of the woman made for sin.
Oh, she boasts a wealth of beauty,
And the voice of her is rich;
But a blight upon the wanton,
And God’s anger on the witch.
Sure she lured him with her white skin,
With her subtle ways and charms;
But I pray that God may wither
Her white throat and rounded arms.
When she offered love and kisses,
Gould a strong man say her nay?
But the poison of her red lips—
It will sting my heart alway.
Now. there’s magic in the hazel,
As myself has often seen;
It will seek the white, cold water
With a power of earth between.
Yes, and dreams are sent to warn us,
And tales and tales are told
Of the Folk (God bless the fairies!)
With their hidden pots of gold.
But it’s neither gold nor water
That I crave a charm to him —
’Tis the heart of him —the strong man —
From the woman made for sin.
And though hazel seek the water,
And though fairy-love be true—
I’m not thinking there’s a witch-gift
That can kindle love anew.

Love anti daughter.
Laughter in love is sweet
When the hours on dancing feet
Flit by unheeded ;
This much, in a golden way,
All hearts in a happy day
May learn —as we did.
When a face grows faintly red
At the things surmised and said,
At the challenge spoken;
When vows are as light as air,
Then love is awake, and there
No hearts are broken.
We have laughed, both you and I,
Where a laughing sea and sky
Our love surrounded ;
Yet a dearer love than this
Was born in the long, slow kiss
When no laugh sounded.
Sombre was Night, above
That stern and silent love
That drove us quaking
Heart unto heart to press,
Your eyes all dark distress,
Your pale mouth shaking.
Oh, cruel and strong indeed
Is the love that will not heed
The sound of laughter;
Yet never did laughter bring
The sweet -remembering
Such love gives after.
Sweet, every laughing day
Like air has blown away,
Nor care we whether
Or you or I forget
With one soft, sweet regret
Those days together.
But on one passionate night
Shall Memory brood, in spite
Of all beguiling,
When not in rosy youth,
But old, and as gaunt as truth,
Love woke unsmiling.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead o / officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

DACEYVILLE, KEMBLA AND OTHER
PLACES.
A highly interesting feature in the policy
of the N.S.W. State Government as an-
nounced by Premier Holman is the deter-
mination to build “more Daceyvilles”—at
Sydney, of course. The existing Daceyville,
it seems, is getting along pretty well. The
houses are let to certain lucky or favored
tenants for much less than Private Enter-
prise would charge, and much less than
people who are not lucky or favored have
to pay. The business, it is alleged, yields
enough to cover interest, maintenance and
sinking fund in these piping days of boom.
Whether allowance is made for the fact
that, as houses grow older, the maintenance
bill grows larger, and whether the sinking
fund is sufficient to replace the houses when
they wear out or become obsolete, and
whether the said fund is intact or has been
already borrowed for new works, and who
holds the fund, and who holds the man
who holds the fund, and whether there is
anything in the way of a reserve with a
view to the time of slump, when tenants will
lly galore and leave the rent unpaid, or will
howl at the Treasurer’s door for mercy and
special consideration —all these are matters
of some uncertainty. But it is plain that
the Government isn’t making out of its
venture any profit that can be used to dim-
inish the yawning void in the Treasury. Nor
is it attempting to make any such profit. In
building suburbs of small houses let at
14s. (id. or so per week it caters exclusively
for the class from which, as a matter of
necessity, it draws the bulk of its support.
It mollifies that class with specially low
lents. It can hardly venture to anger it
by taking the unearned increment, as a pri-
vate landlord would do. If it builds enough
Uaceyvilles, and the Daceyville vote be-
comes sufficiently strong, it may possibly, in
bad times, be driven to reduce even the verv
moderate rents now charged. In the great
slump day the private landlord’s prices will
Come down with a crash, and the State-
owned suburbs will be less attractive by
comparison. There will, apparently, be
more of these suburbs then, and there will
certainly be fewer tenants struggling to get
into them. The empty house will be S a
feature, and the non-financial occupier will
f e , a ea A ure f an d the bailiff becomes a
feature the Labor party will lose support,
lhe private landlord is making hay while
s , hl ?f, and should have some accu-
mulated fodder to help him out when it
rains, which places him on a different foot-
*n?irom h ls rival. Also he can put in the
bailiff without losing votes. When the wet
day arrives the State will want a very big
umbrella a gamp of heroic size— while Pri-
vate Enterprise may pull through with a
mere macintosh.

reason why even a Labor Government
shouldn t put the leases of business sites in
the main streets up to auction, and annex
all the unearned increment that was going.
Certainly it wouldn’t be driven to show
charitable consideration to big drapers and
banks and such-like for fear of losing their
enthusiastic support at the polls, for their
support is mostly lost in any case. Further
this Government, which professes to believe
in public ownership and public enterprise
Has a chance to secure cities almost for a
song instead of acquiring petty suburbs at
gre f t T> COSt c The land ar o ur| d Twofold Bay
nd ,v, P °K rt , Ste P hanf i: and the State’s share
j"v e , borders of Jervis Bay, for instance,
could be resumed at its present value, which
isn t much. Three very short lines of rail-
way, a few wharves suitable for ocean-going
vessels, and an honest attempt to push the
enterprise by giving the same kind of facili-
ties as are freely given to Sydney—
and cities would arise of themselves' just as
Sydney did. The only difference would be
that the State would be ground landlord
instead of the heirs of Daniel Cooper and
magnates of that sort. This would be a
lugger thing than pottering round with
Daceyvilles ; also it would be a much more
striking demonstration of tho Government’s
honesty and good faith. The Proposition
has been freouently put forward in The
Bulletin, and has been received with com-
nlete sdence. The Government can’t brush
the idea aside by saying that it doesn’t care
a straw for public ownership except whore
it will help to bring votes: that it reallv
loathes decentralisation ; and that it is the
good friend and humble servant of the rich
landlords of Sydney. For the sake of its
•lob and its political soul it could hardlv
make remarks of that sort, even if
were true. And as there are few other
feasible remarks to be made it assumes the
attitude of being deaf in that ear.
* * *
It is a strange Government so far as its
remarkable ear is concerned. It can talk
for hours about decentralisation and the
opening-up of N.S.W.’s neglected ports with-
out mentioning one of the three ports which
are fit for big ships and a direct oversea
trade—the three at which great State-owned
cities would arise if given anything like a
chance. The latest proposition is to make a
harbor at Port Kembla, a few miles south
of Sydney, in order to relieve the railway
congestion. Kembla isn’t a natural harbor
—only a dent in the coast. It is sheltered
by South America. There is a fair amount
of water, but nothing that is calculated to
stagger humanity. The depth isn’t worth
writing home to mother about. Probably
it would take half the N.S.W. public
debt to make the place as good as Jervis
Bay or I ort Stephens is by nature. Even
with great expense it will only be possible
to make it a side show for vessels which
will carry produce to good old Sydney for
transhipment. There is not much railway
congestion to relieve down that way, which
enhances the jest. The railway gets so little
work to do that it is run at a loss, and has
been run at a loss since it started.
It is one of the least congested railways
around Sydney.. The reason is that, for‘ a
greaL part of its length, it serves a mere
strip of country between the mountains and
the sea. If the Holman Government spends
a heap of millions on a harbor at Kembla
the money will almost certainly bring in no
return, and the railway loss will be in-
creased. No new. country will be opened
U P‘ Any little bit of unearned increment
that may arise will doubtless go to the pri-
vate landlord. for the scrap of land behind
Kembla, would be hardlv worth resuming as
a State speculation. When the coal mines
fail the whole business will, presumably, be
dead. The place may have points as a
harbor of refuge, but to make a harbor of
refuge almost at the edge of the Sydney
suburban area looks superfluous. As an
apostle of decentralisation and public owner-
ship the Holman Government is an appal-
ling joke or an appalling failure—anyhow
it is an appalling something or other.
MUDDLE AND ANARCHY IN THE
GAMBLING BUSINESS.
There are few countries which have the
gambling habit more fully developed than
Australia. The Commonwealth’s chief
primary industry is largely a gamble. The
man who takes to sheep-farming wagers his
fortune against a drought. If it rains with
any sort of regularity he becomes rfch
in a very few years, and thereafter is
enabled to spot his station with dams; dig
out every rabbit on the place; and surround
himself witu an entrenchment of wire-net-
ting which ensures him the possession of
glass when the land of his less affluent
neighbor—the man who staked his sheep, so
to speak, in the wrong year—resembles a
dusty board. The man who went into the
squatting business, in most parts of Aus-
tralia, say eight years ago, is safe from the
insolvency peril for life, provided he isn’t a
spendthrift or a congenital idiot. On the
other hand, a citizen of pastoral experience
and with the business brain of a Rocke-
feller might turn sheep-farmer to-morrow
and a couple of years later find himself the
possessor of a bankrupt estate that was
mainly a Golgotha of dead sheep’s bones. It
is all a matter of luck. About half our manu-
facturers built or extended their factories
1U years ago on the sporting chance that the
politician would provide their businesses
with effective Protection. Had the United
Mates or Germany been situated as Aus-
tralia was when Federation was inaugu-
rated the bets of this nationally invaluable
class would have been safe ones. As things
are, it has always been a 38 to one chance
against them,. or something similar. O. C.
Beale, the piano-maker, threatened in des-
peration last week to go out of the manu-
facturing game and become an importer once
more. He has been a plucky, warm-footed
gambler for years, but the spectacle of
heavily-protected and cheaply-built Japanese
, hurtling over Australia’s absurd
tariff obstruction, to the detriment of his
own goods, has got on his nerves. His sen-
timents are those, of the punter who con-
siders the proposition of chucking betting
after years of pinched prices and stiffened
favorites.. Robbed of the gambling element
Australia s national sport of racing would
tall as dead as Cheops. The local mining
industry is a stupendous gamble. Travel-
lers on Victorian railways gamble with their
lives, and passengers on the criminally
crowded ferry-boats which tear confusedly
about the face of Port Jackson do likewise.
And this is a mere trifle by comparison with
the fact that all Australia is incessantly
gambling with its national existence, and
has been so doing for years and years. The
Commonwealth is cheerfully wagering its
life as a free white man’s country on the
chance that no Asiatic Power will invade it
before its boy army grows up.
* * * *
One would expect, in all these circum-
stances, that the local native would execute
such of his gambling as admitted of regula-
tion in a more or less rational manner. For
the most part, however, he doesn’t. Aus-
tralia s gaming laws, like its company laws,
are different in all the States. The wild
howl of the bookmaker is to be heard here •
the discreet murmur of the tote official there’,
f okei-machines and two-up schools are
bounded upon with furious violence in one
centre, and treated like Starr-Bowkett socie-
ties in another. There is a variety
of social club in one State where a man may
lose £lOO, or for that matter £lOOO. at
cards, with absolute immunity from legal
trouble, in a single night; and another
variety of social club, in another State, where
the man who drops 3s. 6d. in connection
with “the broads” is liable to be grabbed by
a raiding policeman; dragged through the
streets to a lock-up ; and fined or imprisoned.
Some States disapprove of public lotteries ;
others condone or encourage them. The very
Commonwealth is doubtful, seemingly, as to
whether it approves of gambling or not.
Anyhow, while it leaps with the vigor of a
herd of devils on one of the means by which
a besotted populace delights to do in its
earnings, it does nothing of the sort as re-
gards many other public gambles, which are
equally fatal to the pockets of the electors.
Its attitude towards the Tattersat.l’s
sweep business is interesting—when taken
in conjunction with, say, its attitude to-
wards the bookmaking business—as an ex-
ample of the lengths of inconsistency to
which the anti-gamester is capable of going.
The Postal Department, with the idea, pre-
sumably, of discouraging Tattersall’s, and
so protecting the inhabitants of this con-
tinent from themselves, refuses to handle
any letters directed to the George Arams
Arm. The Department does this under the
Post and Telegraph Act of 1901, which says
(section 57) :
If the Postmaster-General has reasonably ground
to suppose any person to be engaged. . .. i# receiving
money.... for promoting. ... a lottery. .. .he may
direct that any postal article shall not be trans-
mitted to such person.
When section 57 was being passed in Com-
mittee. in the Senate, the Minister of the
day, Senator Drake, in answer to an in-
quiry, assured the House that it was in-
tended to use it for the suppression not only
of sweeps, but also of bookmakers, turf com-
mission agents, tipsters and similar unde-
sirables. The Act came into operation over
12 years ago, and for some obscure reason,
from that day to this, no single Postmaster-
General has attempted to exercise his powers
under it except in regard to foreign lotteries
and Tattersall’s sweep. The economic
folly of the Tattersall’s sweep business,
from the public point of view, is as plain
as the side of a gaol. A sweepstake of
100,000 tickets at ss. each (or, with ex-
ea?h) costs the Populace
±30,000. The deductions —which include the
Adams firm’s commission; the Tasmanian
Government’s tax on the prize money; stamp
duty ; agents’ charges, and postage—come to
£8625; or, in other figures, 28| per cent, of
the total amount subscribed. That leaves
£21,375 for the prize-winners. Assuming
that 50 of these consultations are held every
year—which is a moderate estimate —we find
that a fool public contributes £1,500.000
per annum, and sustains a dead loss, which
goes into the bank accounts of a number of
total strangers, of £431,250. for the privilege
of having a cut at the balance, bv way of
prize-money. That is bad. but, at the worst,
the cards are on the table, and the public
gets a fair deal so far as the rules of the
game admit of anything of the sort. There
is no welshing or "pulling” or bribery in
connection with the Tattersall’s consulta-
tions. Tasmania’s Public Betting and Gam-
ing Act requires the deposit on the part of
all lottery-promoters of a substantial sum
of money by way of security for the pro-
tection of investors. It also provides that
the lottery shall be drawn within certain
hours ; that the fact that the drawing is to
take place shall be made public; and that
responsible officials shall be in attendance
to supervise the ceremony and see that all
is fair and above-board. Not so with the
bookmaking business or swindle. It is safe
to say that for every five shillings that
goes through the hands of Tatxersall’s,
year by year, five sovereigns go through the
hands of the books. The Tattersall’s busi-
ness is, as above-mentioned, straight, more
or less. The bookmaking business is the
reverse. The odds that the deluded backer
is driven to accept, as an alternative horror
to not being permitted to risk his hard-earned
(or stolen or embezzled) cash at all, are
ludicrously short, nine times out of 10. And
when he does get the money on, the chances
are that the animal is not “jigging,” or is
“in the bag.” or is “out for exercise,” or is
in one of the other naanifold situations de-
signed to make the common or hedge punter
blaspheme. The bookmaking business is
discountenanced in certain States. That
means nothing in particular, however, since
by _ means of turf commission agents the
residents of a State where racecourse betting
might be made a penal offence could, with
perfect safety, get their money on in a State
where no such conditions exist. And the
blame for this certainly rests with the Aus-
tralian Parliament.
Under a more rational system of Govern-
ment the central authority would have the
same control over public gambling as it has
over public health. It would be empowered
to shut down absolutely on certain forms of
gaming, not in one centre alone, but all over
the Commonwealth; on the sound principle
that what is pernicious in Perth (W.A.) in
the betting line must be equally so in Bunda-
berg (Q.). Britain, Germany, France and
most other civilised countries have uniform
gaming laws, and the system has been
found to work well. But if every Australian
State is going to continue to have widely
different legislation in this respect, so that
gambling reformers in (sav) Victoria are
liable to be defeated by the opposite class
in N. S. Wales; if States which have de-
clared against the bookmaker are to find
their aims frustrated by commission agents
across their borders; and if the majority
which detests lotteries is driven to put up
with them because there happens to be a
minority which finds lotteries payable pro-
positions; then it is only equitable that all
these forms of gambling should be put, as
far as possible, on a level basis. The Com-
monwealth can begin the good work by
treating the correspondence of turf commis-
sion agents, bookmakers and tipsters in
the same way as it treats the correspondence
of the agents of Tattersall’s. It isn’t a
particularly drastic or impressive reform,
when the vast field that has to be covered
ultimately in this connection is surveyed.
But it will give a badlv-needed appearance
of consistency to the administration of the
Post and Telegraph Act. And. inasmuch as
it will put some sort of a check on the most
dangerous and disreputable form of gambling
that this highly speculative community in-
dulges in. a certain amount of good must
accrue. It goes without saying that genuine
gambling reform can only come with Unifi-
cation. or with such an amendment of the
Constitution as will practically amount to
Unification.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Central Railway.
The S. M. Herald, in its issue of July 21,
had an outbreak headed “The Central Rail-
way,” in which it cordially urged Australia
to be a breaker of faith, and to
burst up the agreement under which it
acquired the Northern Territory—the agree-
ment to build the straight line from south
to north. Some extracts follow:
It is not a pleasant prospect for a young country
to have to saddle itself with the cost of a branch
line that will scarcely be used —much less of an
unused transcontinental railway. .. .However, there
is another construction of that contract which would
permit the line to deviate 60 as to touch some of
the eastern railways Port Darwin has a future
as an important outlet and seaport—but an outlet
for what? For passengers from Adelaide? For
goods from Port Augusta? Or for traffic from the
populous eastern coast of Australia? etc., etc.
There is something really amazing about the
inability of a thoroughly parish-pump-
minded paper to understand that there will
ever be any population, or agriculture, or
manufactures or commerce in this con-
tinent except just outside its dingy old
office, and just alongside its ancient and
muddy old doorstep. Therefore any big rail-
way which doesn’t come round by its office
must be “unused.” What, exactly, does
the populous eastern coast of Australia”
want the Port Darwin railway for, and
what special use is Port Darwin to “the
populous eastern coast” as an outlet? These
parts have already Portland, Melbourne,
Western Port, Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay,
Sydney, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Bris-
bane, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Townsville,
Bowen a,nd other less-known places. Port
Darwin is too far awav for a long, crooked
railway from “the populous eastern coast”
to be of much value to that coast.
The line would have little hope and less
traffic, for no one would send goods from
Parramatta to. Darwin for export when Syd-
ney was at hand. But the short, straight
and comparativelv cheap line from south to
north might develop a population in the
centre of Australia, where there is a huge
table land, and an oasis, and a rainfall, and
some rivers. It might even create a
big inland city, in which there would be
another and a better S. M. Herald, with an
office that wasn’t so dingy, and a doorstep
that wasn’t so muddv. and a soul that had
a wider outlook. To build a straight,
short, cheap line across the middle of Aus-
tralia is to open up a country which has no
railway communication at present—a coun-
try of great possibilities, for which Darwin
at one end and Port Augusta and Adelaide
at the other are the natural outlets. To
drag it around the Eastern States at great


extra length and expense signifies taking it
through a region where there is little trade
to he done because that region is already
better served by the eastern ports. The only
theory on '.vhich the demand for the eastern
deviation can be explained is that the habit
of demanding anything and everything—even
if it be a dead crocodile, or a Federal capi-
tal or an epidemic, or a prayer-book, or a
se t’ of false teeth —has become chronic with
the Tory press. When the parish-pump pub-
lications of Sydney mark out the track of
their proposed eastern deviation of the trans-
continental railway, the line is shown as
entering N.S.W. on the north-west and join-
ing on to the existing State system at
Bourke. Bourke is a fading cattle town
located at the end of an unpayable
400-mile long railway from Sydney. If
Bourke, the perishing cattle town, can’t
make a success of things with a line 400
miles long, connecting it with the biggest
city and the best meat market in Australia,
what will it profit the place to connect it
by a line nearly 2000 miles long with a
town that is also in the cattle business? The
objects of the transcontinental line should
be’: (1) To open on new and promising
country, and (2) to connect with Port
Augusta and Darwin the regions that
Nature has attached to these ports. In
that fashion the business may be made to
pay. To drag the work round into country
that is naturally attached to the eastern
ports can only make it bankrupt.

Holman on His Defence.
The people of New South Wales may grow
tired, or exhausted, or at least a trifle fagged
one of these days over Premier Holman’s
defence of his party’s financial doings. Hol-
man is an eloquent man who talks with his
mouth and all his limbs, and when he gets
really going the air is full of hands and
paws and flying members. The sky is prac-
tically blotted out with the whirling ex-
tremities of Holman. And he says the
same thing—alwavs the same thing. tie
wants to know exactly which item of his
Government’s expenditure—the expenditure
which brought about the great deficit —the
public objects to. He inquires which parti-
cular pound or farthing has been misspent.
The public has a vague and general idea
that when a dissatisfied supporter or ex-
supporter was sent out of the way on a
very hazy mission to the United States, at
£4 a day plus his Parliamentary salary—
which salary, he, being absent, wasn’t earn-
ing in any reasonable sense of the term —
money was being misspent. And it has
heard uncontradicted rumors about some-
body else having been sent on a similar hazy
mission on a similar remuneration. But it
hasn’t the time or inclination to buy
1,000,000 copies of the public accounts, and
compare them, item by item, with 1.000,000
copies of the public accounts of three, or
seven or 10 years ago. If it insured its life
with the A.M.P. Society, and its bonus went
down to nothing for no visible reason, and
the fund on which it depended for payment
of the face value of its policy began to dis-
appear, and the manager haughtily
asked it which especial item of his
expenditure it objected to, and re-
fused to be regarded as other than
a first-rate manager unless the full details
were forthcoming, it would probably feel the
same way. It would say that it hadn’t time
to go through the vast mass of accounts,
and find out where the stamp leakage
occurred, or where the overcharge for office-
cleaning happened, or where 17 office boys
were employed where nine would be suffi-
cient. But it would also say that it paid
the manager to keep the finances square,
and to know how to keep them square, and
if he couldn’t do it the society was due to
find a new manager. Political finance is
just as important as insurance finance.
One of the most conspicuous duties of a
Government is to make the public income
balance the public expenditure. It is paid
to do that work. When it fails to accom-
plish the job it is paid for. and tries to
cover its discomfiture bv saying to the un-
paid public, “Show us where you would have
done better,” it is begging the question. In-
cidentally, it is making the country feel
tired. The assumption that over a million
and a half of people should break ir + o the
Treasurer’s office at dead of night, if they
can’t get at the detailed accounts otherwise,
and hold an exhaustive audit, and then ex-
plain to their hired financier how to do the
job he is hired for, and that, failing this
extraordinary proceeding, they should cheer-
fully remunerate Holman and co. for any
rotten old finance they care to supplv, is
sheer bluff. Onlv a person of notable effron-
tery would assume the attitude that Hol-
man takes up. What the community knows,
without spending too much time on details,
is that the present Government has enjoyed
a bigger revenue than any of its predeces-
sors; and that inside 2 \ years it has added
so enormously to the expenditure that it
has produced the record shortage of the
State’s history. Also, it knows that there
has been neither war. pestilence, famine or
other extraordinary happening to explain
the situation. Without quitting its job (and
thereby losing its salary! to personally over-
haul the public accounts —and Holman
would probablv shout for the police if it
made the attempt—it reckons these are suffi-
cient points to go on with. In short, its very
general opinion is that the Holman gang
is, so far as its finances go, the worst aggre-
gate incapable that ever sat in the high
Political places of the State, and that it is
a very lofty and self-sufficient ass to boot.
The Tote.
That imperishable old fraud, the Totalisator
Bill, is down for mention in the N. S. Wales
Assembly on the day that The Bulletin
Soes to press. If the time of the House is
worth ss. a minute, as some statistical
enthusiast calculated the other day, then
does Harry Levien, who is the sponsor of
this Bill, owe the suffering Ma State a pre-
posterously large sum of money._ The pro-
cedure in connection with it. is un-
varying to a boresome extent. It is brought
m with a sort of howl of triumph
either at the tail end of an ordinary session
or at the beginning of one of those extra-
ordinary sessions which have more work
mapped out for them bv the Government
than could be accomplished in five years
hard labor. Everyone tells everyone else
that the Tote is a splendid institution,
h igures are quoted to show that in various
European countries it relieves the citizen
harmfni aSt ai ?,° Ullt of taxation, diminishes
hosnitaL S ' u mbl - ng ’ and keeps all sorts of
Insolvent h n PIC f S mm (] refu ses out of the
insolvency Court. Then one of two things
makm S 'i - Elther the friends of the book-
makers join, as one man, with the “anti-
Cambiers, and the Tote Bill is flung out
ot the House with such violence that it
does not recover consciousness for days ; or
there being some faint doubt as to whether
i;ii • flung out ~ it is hung up
fiT m e followin g session. The only hope of
tne lote ever becoming more than'a subject
for insincere blither in N.S.W. lies in some
Administration or other making a
Government measure of it. But everv
Government fears the bookmaking or
sporting vote much, and the anti-gam-
bling or Wowser vote more. And both of
them are ranged against the Tote. The
persistence of the existing system—a system
under which millions of gamblers’
sovereigns are wasted yearly, while crimi-
nals and sharpers are manufactured by the
score—is one of the things that N.S.W. has
to thank Party Government for.
McLeod’s Joke.
“Frank Cboson,” from Melbourne: —
The present political situation in Victoria is as
humorous in many of its aspects as the serious, not
to say stodgy, character of its creators will permit.
The chief creator is McLeod, ex-town clerk and now
member for Daylesford, and an accidental member
of the late Bent's Ministry, who desires to
inform sub-Excellency Fuller that Messrs.
Watt, Weary, Peacock, Billson, Dry. Brown
and Co. no longer possess the confidence of
the House. This is quite likely, but neither does
McLeod. Behind that hopeless Tory are some 14 of
the worst reactionaries in an amazingly stodgy
House — Gray, Bowser, Nauman Bayles, Farrer
(a Bent discovery), Mackey, (another BENT-ite),
Langdon (a Bent reject), Robinson Snowball,
McKetchup (the Brahmapootra), and Malcolm
Kenneth McKenzie, of land-dealing notoriety,
among others. These few, much as they disapprove
of Watt for being too democratic, could have no
hope of displacing him but for the fact that, in a
House of 60 effective votes, there are 19 Laborites,
and their leader has announced that McLeod’s
action has their support; so there are 33 against
Watt and 27 for him. What the Labor Leagues
will have to say to this unholy coalition of Labor
with ultra-Toryism remains to be seen. In the
meantime, McLeod, knowing he has the numbers,
and knowing, also, that Watt knows it, is acting as
though he expects Watt to cl ; mb down, sack two
or three Ministers, and take in McLeod and a friend
or two—say, W. K. McKenzie, for choice. Unfor-
tunately for the success of this plot, Watt doesn’t
seem inclined to climb down.. Instead, he talks
fight knowing perfectly well that a dissolution must
arrive presently, if not sooner, and that that cir,
cumstance wili be disastrous not only to McLeod
and co., but to some Laborites also. How McLeod s
ioke will work out Heaven only knows. At present
the Tory press is enthusiastically urging Graham,
Billson and one or two other Ministers to obliterate
themselves, presumably to make room for McLeod
and McKetchup, or the embryonic Nauman Bayles,
Meanwhile, because of the ridiculous “party ’ system,
the political business of the State is at a standstill
while the momentous matter is deeded. After that,
the Address-in-Reply has to be further spoken to at
great length, or a new Address has to be Prepared
and more oceans of talk indulged in, and then an
entirely new set of measures has to be prepared.
and long before a quarter of them has been passed
an election will occur, and the whole process will
have to be begun all over afresh. With Elective
Ministers no item of all this folly need occur If
one Minister proved incapable or unsuitable, he could
be replaced without the rest of the States
or administrative business being stopped or ham-
nprpd in the least, lust as a defective tooth can be
without pulling the whole mouthful out or
the head off. But, apparently, the politicians and
a good many electors haven’t got as much sense as
an ordinary tooth-repairer.
Maoriland’s Labor Factions.
Early in March last The Bulletin ex-
pressed the opinion that Labor in Maoriland
was still floundering in the Wilderness of
Things Political, that it was split into fac-
tions, and that there seemed no hope of a
welding of forces under the leadership of a
Moses in whom the tribes could repose confi-
dence. At that time a preliminary confer-
ence, with the object of forming a unified
party, had been held between representatives
of the old Trades and Labor Council’s sec-
tion, and the newer Federation of Labor (the
“Red Federation”), that stove its reputation
m at Waihi. The former appointed as its
delegates “Professor” W. T. Mills, some-
time of Milwaukee (U.S.), and Edward
Tbegear, formerly secretary of M.L.’s State
Labor Department. Utterly mistaking the
spirit of those who had sent them to do the
bargaining, these two agreed to a draft
charter, which came before a more compre-
hensive conference for ratification about a
week ago. That draft charter preambled
thuswise: —
Between these two classes (employers and em-
ployed) a struggle must go on until the workers of
the world take possession of the earth and the
machinery of production, and abolish the wage sys-
tem. .. .It is the historic mission of the working
class to do away with capitalism.
Also, the good old general strike was given
a prominent position in the document, and
anti-defence was a “Hail Columbia” item.
At the time, The Bulletin made a few
homely remarks on the false position that
Tbegear and Mills had allowed themselves
to be dragged into, and to these remarks the
former delegate wrote in reply, not to The
Bulletin, but to Sydney Worker. In his
letter he said, in brief, that The Bulle-
tin was talking through its turban, and that
all was well with the prospects of the draft
agreement when it came before the General
Conference in July, for confirmation. In
fact, that the Unity scheme was a sure
starter and a certain winner. The general
conference having now completed its job, it
is clear that Brother Tregear was a trifle
premature, for not only did the conference
decline to accept the Unity scheme, but the
whole show sagged at the knees, and sud-
denly and irreparably split in half. The old
crowd, the so-called United Labor Party,
reckoned that the Red Federationists and
other extremists were too feverish to walk
hand in hand with, and withdrew from
further argument. In a subsequent U.L.P.
proclamation it was announced that the most
striking feature of the Unity Conference was
the marked absence of any true spirit of
unity. One clause of the proclamation puts
the position of the factions in the clearest
focus: —
We repudiate, as a party and as individuals, the
policy and methods of revolutionary action put for-
ward under the various names of Syndicalism, In-
dustrial Unionism and Direct Action, under which
the workers would be committed to planned indus-
trial strife, stimulated class warfare, and the use
of force instead of the process of law.
Now, an effort is to be made to string to-
gether all the stragglers with moderate
views, and push on with a policy evolu-
tionary and constructive in character, calcu-
lated to benefit not the sectional interests
of a class, but society in general. Meanwhile,
the Crowd in a Hurry will get along with the
most likely implement available.
Over the Odds.
There are some political assaults that are
fair things, however acid they may be.
There are others that only deserve to be
handled with the tongs. In the second class
is the yarn which the Melbourne Age
printed about W. M. Hughes last week,
and which was, of course, republished joy-
fully by the Tory press throughout Aus-
tralia. The disreputableness of the story
lies in the fact that, on the face of it, the
author must have known how much of it
was true and how much was the reverse.
The correct portion consists of the state-
ment that before the last Australian Par-
liament dissolved Ministers had decided
that the Inter-State Commission should be
composed of W. M. Hughes (Chairman),
John Quick and Senator Lynch. The
other portion ran as follows: —
Mr. Hughes is stated to have fully made up his
mind that the invitation was one which should be
accepted by him at once. But at a critical stage
in the discussions in Cabinet, Mr. J. C. Watson is
said to have intervened, and to have implored Mini-
sters not to make the appointment till after the
elections, as the withdrawal of Mr. Hughes from
the ranks in New South Wales would have a most
damaging effect on the prospects of the party in that
State. The matter is declared to have gone to a
vote, with this result: —
Ministers.
Against Mr. Hughes’ immediate appoint-
ment .. . • • • • • .. 6
In favor of Mr. Hughes’ immediate
appointment .. • • • • • • 4
Majority against .. • • 2
Mr. Hughes is said to have gracefully bowed to the
decision, being fully convinced that his party would
win the election, and that then a fresh opportunity
of rounding off his public career would be presented.
The facts in the above connection are well
known to Federal politicians on both sides
of the House. Hughes was offered the
Chairmanship of the Inter-State Commis-
sion —but at a time when the elections were
over three months distant. He was broken
down in health. He decided to accept.
Then came signs of a sort_ of Tory re-
naissance, more especially in the State
where Hughes’ word carried most weight.
Simultaneously the party realised that
Andrew Fisher, as an exponent of the
pro-Referenda side of their case, would be
no match for men of the calibre of Irvine
and Glynn. By the closing weeks of April
—at the end of which month Fisher’s
policy speech was due to be delivered —
Hughes’ health had improved out of sight.
Also, (1) the election prospects in N. S.
Wales, owing to the frantic conduct of the
McGowen State Ministry, were beginning
to look more and more gloomy for Labor;
(2) the importance of an affirmative Refer-
enda vote to the future prospects of the
party had become glaringly obvious; (3)
Hughes’ defection, at that juncture,
threatened (a) to do a lot of damage to
the cause in the Eastern States, (b) to
ruin any faint hope there might be of carry-
ing the Referenda. In the circumstances
Hughes decided off his own bat to take the
step which the Age represents him as hav-
ing been protestingly kicked by his fellow
Ministers into taking. J. C. Watson did
not “intervene” in the matter. He had no
sensational interviews with the Fisher
Ministry. There was no party vote on the
question, and that being so there was no
majority of six to four against Hughes
being suffered to grab the chairmanship.
The preposterousness of this allegation that
Hughes was rapped sharply over the
knuckles by his disgusted colleagues while
he was in the act of cravenly trying to get
in out of the wet, would be obvious even
if there weren’t good authority for denounc-
ing it as a malignant untruth. This paper
has no furious affection for Hughes. His
fiscal attitude, for example, appears to it
in the light of a national calamity. When
he ratted on the referendum principle as
applied to the Federal capital, apparently
for fear a referendum might shift the capital
away from his political back door, he was a
wretched Tory and a narrow-minded paro-
chial misery. Still, he did a fair amount of
service to the Australian defence movement.
And he did not have to be dragged by main
force off the chairmanship of the Inter-
State Commission, as alleged.
—
A Wonderful Programme.
It is not easy to decide whether Premier
Holman of N.S.W. is a jester of some
obscure variety or simply the most san-
guine man in the country. The State Legis-
lature has met for a short final session. The
finances are in such wild disorder that a
plain, hard-headed, hard-working financier
of the Geobge Turner variety would pro-
bably have announced that the job of put-
ting them straight would keep the
House busy most of its time. But the
Holman Ministry, with a very small
majority in one House and none in the
other proposes to: (1) pass a vaccination
law; (2) to do something about grain
elevators and other railway improvements;
(3) to consolidate the laws dealing with
State lands; to “devote further atten-
tion to land settlement”; (5) to authorise
the Savings Bank to make advances on
leaseholds; to further tax large
estates; (7) to pass measures dealing with
meat supply and monopolies; (8) to con-
sider proposals dealing with underground
railways for Sydney and vehicular ferry
services; (9) to erect model suburbs; (10)
to grant new powers to the Savings Bank
so that it may assist workmen to acquire
their own homes; (11) to pass a Fair Rents
Bill; (12) ditto a Public Service Super-
annuation Bill; (13) ditto a Police Appeal
Board Bill; (14) ditto a Railway Servants’
Appeal Board Bill; (15) ditto a Bill to
protect deserted wives and children; (16)
ditto a Bill to prevent a testator leaving
his family destitute; (17) ditto a Bill to
establish a Public Trustee; (18) ditto an
Bight Hours Bill (the “ditto” grows weari-
some and will now be dropped) ; (19) a
Coal Mines Regulation Bill; (20) an Indus-
trial Arbitration Amendment Bill; (21)
Mining Acts Amendment Bill; (22) Mini-
mum Wage Bill; (23) Greater Sydney
Bill; and (24) Workmen’s Compensation
Bill. Also there are some other new Bills,
and the finances are to be attended to, and
the Estimates passed, and the regular loans
floated, and a number of unspecified public
works are to have a look in, and a lot of
measures which were left unfinished at the
end of last session are to resume where
they left off. It is a tremendous catalogue,
and if Holman gets through a quarter of it
he will be a very busy and excited man.
Australia’s Minister for Hot Air.
The path of the allegedly Anti-Socialist
Prime Minister is about as steep and boul-
der-strewn a causeway as exists anywhere.
The tactical advantage of being a Labor
Prime Minister lies in the fact that every
one of his supporters expects him to do
something. He may do too little, but he
can hardly do to 6 much. Joseph Cook’s
position is impossibly awkward because a
large section of his support —and the sec-
tion, moreover, which has the money and
the influence behind it —consists of those
who expect him to remain harmlessly inert;
if indeed he doesn’t attempt the repeal of
the more advanced of his predecessors’ Acts.
This explains why Cook, when he made,
last Saturday, what the Sydney Tele-
graph’s Melbourne correspondent called “an
important statement regarding unemploy-
ment and contributory insurance,” spoke in
the abasingly apologetic terms that one
would expect of some miserable person who
had been driven to own up to a desire to rifle
a hen-roost or burgle a bank. As a matter of
fact, he refrained carefully from committing
himself definitely to anything one way or
the other. He blithered, with guarded
vagueness, over three-quarters of a column,
on the “serious problems of unemployment,
both skilled and unskilled”; on the “many
reasons” for the same; on the tendency of
the unemployed citizen to degenerate into
an unemployable; on “Society’s duty” in
the matter; and on the need of “facile
machinery.” But when he arrived at the
necessity of abandoning white-whiskered
platitude and stating something off his own
bat, the frankest and most courageous effort
he could make was this
The time has come, I think, to lay this burden
fairly upon the whole country in the shape of a con-
tributory insurance scheme. We are all in it, and we
cannot escape from it, and we are all more or less
responsible. One way in which we can meet it is
by what I call good government, a term that is
often sneered at. I mean by restoring confidence
between those who want the work and those who
have to set them to do the work, and in the encour-
agement of the united application of both capital
and labor to the productive forces of this young
country. This is one very important way in which
relief may eventually be promised. Still, the best
laid schemes of mice and men “gang aft agley,”
when you have the Senate dead against you, and
the House of Representatives equal. Well, what we
shall be able to do may possibly not be very much ;
however, it. will not stop our inquiries, which have
already begun.
We are trying to go ahead with this matter, and
if we fail we shall have failed trying to do a good
thing. But I do not think we need fail, and I do
not think we shall if we go about it in a manner
which is wise, and take profit from the experience
of other countries which have striven to do some-
thing in this matter.
How a contributory insurance schemn is to
be “met by good government” any* more
than a Dog Act scheme or any other class
of scheme, is not apparent. Further mys-
teries are (1) the names and addresses of
some of those who sneer at the term “good
government”; (2) the reasons, if any, why
Cook considers that his opponents in either
the Representatives or the Senate should
oppose unemployment insurance—this being
a long-established plank of the Labor plat-
form; and (3) the nature of the “inquiries”
that Cook has begun, on the familiar sub-
ject of insurance. Viewing Cook’s so-
called “important statement” by and large it
suggests so much verbosity and pomoous
truism expressly designed to signify nothing
in particular. An opinion which is
Homeless.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Houses are still scarce in Sydney. —Useless sort of
remark made by daily payer.
My landlord is a pleasant bloke;
He smiles whene’er we meet;
But him I’d dearly love to choke.
My hot, indignant feet
I scarce can keep off him, when he
Accepts the rent and smiles at me.
For two long years, my rent I’ve paid
With prompt and ruddy gold;
Ofttimes I’ve longed to plunge a blade
Into his waistcoat’s fold.
But I’ve restrained myself, because
His smile just like a comrade’s was.
And now he tells me I must go
Ere three short weeks have sped!
Must tear the home to bits and throw
The leavings in the shed!
Uproot my carpets—watch them furled
And trundle piecemeal through the world!
It is a raw and savage thing
To break a home, and see
A string of vans meandering
Into obscurity!
To see the shame of some old chair,
And table wave their legs in air.
As sudden crises show weak spots
In old and valued friends,
Likewise a flight of sideboards, pots,
Beds, chairs and carpets sends
A wave of horror down my spine.
(That wave and shock will soon be mine) !
My fond affections round this house
That I am renting twine.
Herein with tea I used carouse,
In lieu of beer and wine.
The thoughts that like tomatoes grow,
I must uproot them, row by row.
Last night, a homeless cur and thin
Yelped sadly at my gate.
To-day I put a house ad. in
And paid the usual rate.
I cannot help but think there is
Some likeness ’twixt my yelp and his.
I pay my rent —the dog pays none;
Yet I for shelter must
Go skirmishing through rain and sun!
With tongpe all over dust.
The homeless cur, puffed up with pride,
Trots panting ever by my side.
My landlord is a pleasant bloke;
But, as he smiles at me,
I’m wondering if I can choke
Him with impunity,
Or whether ’twould be best to shoot
And bury deep the friendly brute.

strengthened by the notorious fact that
under the Constitution, as it stands, no
scheme of contributory insurance can pos-
sibly be effectuated, even though both Houses
combine and pass the measure without a dis-
sentient vote. A Federal Insurance Act
must involve the interference by the Aus-
tralian Parliament in the internal trade
and commercial affairs of the States. But
ihe High Court has laid it down that any
such interference is invalid. And the
( ook party is committed to the view that a
Constitutional alteration designed to vali-
date Federal control of State businesses
amounts to l nificati'm, and is therefore
pernicious. In other words. Liberalism's
lalk about unemployment insurance is hot
air and bunkum of a palpable order. Mean-
while another test of the mettle of Cook’s
Anti-Socialism has stenped forward in the
shape of the Navigation Act, which is now
awaiting the Royal Assent. Is Cook going
to withdraw this Act, which was denounced
virulently as. the last word in revo-
lutionary Socialism, by Liberals last year?
The writer would like to have a wager or
two to the contrary. Amendments in the
Baby Bonus Act. in the direction of seeing
that women who never would have de-
manded the Federal fiver anyhow shall be
debarred from demanding it in future, are
about the furthest this crowd of “Liberal
’udividualists” is likely to go along the Anti-
Socialist route.

The Prescription and the Corpse.
“Carton” writes on the above subject:—
Reginald Clive Harris, aged 14 months, is dead ;
and he should still be alive. The Coroner said it
was “ace dental death.” The facts are that on July
17 the child’s mother obtained from the Newtown
dispensary a bottle of medicine for internal use —
and also an inhalant. The latter appears to have
been put into an ordinary medicine bottle. The
mother, by mistake, gave the child a dose from the
wrong bottle. When she found out she took the
youngster to the doctor who had written the pre-
scription. The medico got to work to . counteract
the effect of the inhalant —and was apparently suc-
cessful. He also wrote another prescr’ntion for a
simple emetic—ipecacuanha wine—and directed that
one teaspoonful should be given for a dose This
prescription was dispensed (or, rather, it wasn’t) at
a Newtown pharmacy. The chemist who received it
misread the drug prescribed (v i- z., Vin. Ipecac ) wine
of opium, or, as the doctors write it, “Vin. Ovii.”
A teaspoonful of Vin. Opii. was given to the child,
whereupon it presently yielded up the ghost
The subsequent inquest seems to have resolved itself
into a question as to whether the doctor did, or did
not, write the second prescription plainly or the
chemist did, or did not, exercise due care in reading
it. Most people are familiar with the manner in
which prescriptions are usually written—and this
writer can readily understand the difficulty in cer-
tain circumstances of distinguishing the Latin abbre-
viation of one drug from that of the other.
The chemist immediately detected the large dose
of what he took to be opium wine. According to his
story, he rang the medico up, read the prescription
as he interpreted it, and asked ; f it was correct? He
also said that someone purporting to be the doctor,
answered over the ’phone that it was right. He
thereupon dispensed it. The doctor said in his evi-
dence that the prescription wasn’t referred to him
at all Surely that was sufficient subject matter for
further inquiry?
. The dispenser from the Newtown dispensary said,
ln evidence, that the prescription was perfe fly plain
to him. It may have been—and yet not neces-
sarily so to the chemist who made it up, though the
latter may be an equally competent chemist. One
chemist may be familiar w : th the whirlv scrawl of
a doctor, where another, seeing his >mthooks and
'-angers for the first time, would be puzzled. Leaving
the doctor out of the question altogether, this writer
suggests that the ease points to the necessity of some
means whereby both the chemist and the niiblic mav
ne protected against mistakes arising through the
careless writing of prescriptions.
Take this as an authentic example of how hoDe-
lessly some doctors can write when they try. There
is a \ ic. sawbones with a large practice who writes
his prescript ous so carelessly that it is practically
impossible, without pract-'ce, to decipher them. He
is aiso a member of Parliament—or was, at the time
this incident happened. A patient got from him a
prescription, and at the same fine a permit to visit
Parliament House. During the day the chemist with
whom the presumption was left took it back to the
m° a C k» r i? nd f told blm , that he’d he hanged if he could
make it out. The doctor tried to read it, and for
some minutes was badly rattled himself. Then he
suddenly recognised H as the permit he had given

The authors of “A Butterfly on the
Wheel” set out of malice aforethought to be
pathetic, and they succeeded brilliantly. On
Saturday night last, at Sydney Royal, after
the “great” divorce scene two amphitheatre
flappers gave the Waller-Titheradge co. an
unsolicited testimonial of the highest possible
value by burying their heads in their arms
and weeping unrestrainedly into the stalls.
A hat, apparently, is the sort of success the
authors aimed at; and, to do them justice,
they earn every teardrop. Never was a
louder demand made for sympathy. The
divorce-court scene, which consists wholly
of the fluttering Butterfly’s cross-examina-
tion by a merciless barrister, does not ad-
vance the play an inch. The audience has
to at a nd listen, as patiently as possible,
while Lewis Waller, K.C., shouts and pounds
and finds out about half as much as the
onlooker already knows. There are tears
and hysterical outbursts by witness Madge,
and at least one of her nassionate speeches
about “Man-made laws” might very well
conclude with a shower of Suffragette litera-
ture from her ermine muff. It would be a
natural and welcome relief from the ten-
sion of the scene; but the authors have
steered clear of it. The play, or Society
melodrama, is a simple, dramatic proposi-
tion, without surprises. In Act 3, the But-
terfly (Mrs. Admaston) is discovered
fluttering prettily in a Paris hotel, where
she has been stranded through the scattering
of her mixed travelling party of four, of
which her serious political husband is not
a member. Apparently it is an accident.
Actually it is all part of a carefullv-laid
plan concocted by her too-fervent adinirer
(Roderick Collingwood), who has engaged a
whole suite in advance with the worst in-
tentions. He surprises her about midnight
while she is fooling about in a dressing-
gown, and makes a determined attack, but
honorably repulsed. Meanwhile, the
M.I. husband in London has been warned
by anonymous letter of the whole elaborate
On the Road."—The six hobies a Sydney
Tivoli.
seduction scheme, and tests its correctness
by having his wife watched, and ringing her
up while Collingwood is in the room. Col-
hngwood impulsively answers the ring, and
straightway has to start lying about a
mythical supper party. The scene ends,
after the withdrawal of Collingwood, with
the foolish young wife in the arms of her
motherly French maid, who has already in-
dicated the Butterfly’s enemy as Lady
A twill—a designing Society widow and
member of the travelling party, who has
never forgiyen the Butterfly for marrying
the man she had marked down for her own.
When the suspicious husband arrives, after
breakfast next morning, and disturbs the
reunited party at their work of rehearsing
a childishly transparent lie for his benefit,
the agony of the detected co-re. clearly
shows that he didn’t send the letter with
the idea of bringing down the wrathful
deluge and completing his neatly-planned
job. The play not being a built-to-puzzle
detective story, the onlooker decides it can’t
be the devoted maid, or the Butterfly herself,
or the humorously stupid Ellerdine johnny
(the fourth member of the assorted party).
The letter is plainly the work of the Atwill
woman, and the only points left to be
decided are: (1) How and by whom will she
be found out? (2) Will Adnjaston take his
discarded wife back? He has to wait until
the last act to see the virtuously repentant
Collingwood force a confession from the
Atwill cat by reminding her how, two years
before, after a hunting accident, she learnt
to write with her left hand, and sent him
a photograph signed with the baffling fist
that has been puzzling the Divorce Court,
h aced with the awful ordeal of admitting
her meanness in open court, “with all Lon-
don looking on,” she promises to confess to
Admaston, does and totters sobbing from
the room, about 150yds. behind the retreat-
ing co-re. Admaston, in the time-frayed
fashion, humbly begs Mrs. Butterfly’s par-
don, reaches for his hat, and is restrained
with the usual pair of white arms thrown
like a noose round his neck. A “happy”
curtain. But one imagines Mrs. Butterfly, as
she filled out and gained confidence, getting
back handsomely on her doubting Admaston
all the days of his life for the lively time
that expensive lawyer gave her. There is
room and to spare in the play for a master-
ful, sharp-tongued dowager who would
harass the whole foolish crowd, and stam-
pede them with unexpected and destructive
volleys of common sense. She could be Mrs.
Butterfly’s mother, and her presence in the
cast would help to distinguish the olav from
No Mother to Guide Her,” the equally
pathetic attraction at the Adelphi. If the
rather tiresome divorce-court scene were
transferred to the Adelphi. it would have to
Tui el }|i vene d by the cross-examination of
Ellerdine, the gentlemanly liar with the
hopeless memory.
* * * *
Madge Titheradge, as the pathetically
young and helpless I’eggy Admaston, makes
an irresistible appeal. Australia, the far
hind which loses its home-grown stars when
they are young, and sees foreign stars only
when are old, would philosophically
accept a plump and mature Butterfly, so
vr? g rn' , she bad reasonably high talent.
Miss litheradge, besides being an actress of
remarkable power, has all the charm of
youth and a winsome personality. One
can hardly imagine a better Peggy or a
truer performance than hers. Lewis Waller,
as Fyffe, K.C., has the unpopular job of
reducing Peggy by hard logic and angrv
shouts to tears, hysterics, and. finally, un-
consciousness. His life-like imitation of a
hired legal bully, with the hair of a more
useful animal on his head, should help to
discredit the Law wherever he appears.
Halhwell Hobbes is a restrained and care-
fully solemn Admaston ; and Chas. Quarter-
maine, as Roderick Collingwood, is most
likeable and convincing when serious
trouble has overtaken himself and his be-
loved, and the lovemaking is aU over. Fvelyn
Beer boh ill, as the Bllerdine lord, presents a
finished and delightful study of a well-
dressed. well-bred ass. Alma Vaughan, as
the designing Lady Atwill, hardlv conveys
the necessary impression of malignant
jealousy. Alec F. Thompson, who did so
notably well as Fluellen, in “Henrv V..”
plays a slight waiter’s part with all the
fjod. artist’s careful attention to detail; and
Marianne Caldwell, as Pauline, the devoted
maid, is as gentle a substitute-ma as an
apparently orphaned Butterfly could expect
to hire by the month.

The betting market has been unusually
active this week in consequence of an an-
nouncement that “Her Road to Ruin”—
booked tor Sydney Adelphi on Saturday
night—is “the strange story of a bishop, a
r!’I rat ?' a p< ? ol ' journalist and two girls.”
Jhe dispute is as to which of the first three
is responsible. The bishop is firm favorite
at 2 to 1 on ; even money can be had on the
curate, and the poor journalist is a rank
outsider at 10 to 1 against. Results next

But before her contract is up, the old man
is up too. sees her ou t, follows her

This week’s Sydney Tivoli programme is
as much unlike last week’s as it is possible
for two variety programmes to be. The new
turns include the “Golden Troupe” of Rus-
sian dancers, singers and instrumentalists;
Carl and Lilian Muller, who provide an ex-
citing 10 minutes’ juggling with hoops, etc.;
Laskey’s Six Hoboes, musical and non-
musical tramps, much the same as the trio
at “The Grafters” ; Flynn and McLoughlin,
labelled dancers, though their gyrations
might be anything; four “Primroses” (total
weight 10001 b.) ; more rag-timers; and
Bonnie Leonard, also a rag-timer. Billie
Reeves, the drunk (last nights). Lola Kras-
avina the operatic (and rag-time) singer,
and Sayles and Warton (also rag-time) are
still in evidence.
Oscar Asche has had a triumphant fare-
well evening at Adelaide Royal, in the brutal
but artistic and enthralling “Othello.” Pre-
viously, the strong, well-I.alanced co. had
frolicked through that anti-suffragette tract,
Shrew.” Three Shakspeares and
Kismet” have made up a strenuous educa-
tional, enjoyable season. Between times,
Mr. and Mrs. Asche fostered a Kismet hall
(roTo net to the Children’s Hospital), won
a coursing stake, and ran into the last six
in the local Waterloo Cup, the winner of
which they then purchased for use in Eng-
land. A brief vacancy at the Royal has
enabled the irrepressible Operatic Society to
come in again with its amateur “Dorothy.”
Ihe players are, naturally, more used to
their work than they were when they were
less accustomed to it, and give a very good
show, with the Hunting Chorus as the best
bit. Adelaide Tivoli continues to be crowded,
manager Marcus having recklessly added to
the already strong bill Tiebor’s balancing
seals and Torcat’s elderly, experienced, per-
forming fowls. At the King’s are the
Creightons, juggling delightfully, Armstrong
and Howarth in a “sketch,” and Ford and
alonty in another. Wondergraph, West’s,
Lmpire and the all-day Pav. (which has
had to be enlarged) all show pictures, gen-
eranv of a melodramatic turn, with (if pos-
sible). a “moral” lurking in the last foot
or two.

The last five nights of Genee at Her
Majesty's (Melb.) began on Saturday, with
the omission of the feeble operetta, the en-
tertainment being composed of dancing and
orchestra all the time. In “La Camargo”
the star was understood to be the favorite
pirouetter of Louis XV. The son of Marie
Eaton, who wore the gloomy trappings of
widowhood, had got into trouble for insult-
ing a beast of a Comte, and Genee’s job
was to get a free pardon for the young man
by dancing before the King and otherwise
talking him into compliance. La Camargo
is an elegantly appointed ballet, rather on
the quiet side, and decidedly mild in com-
parison with the hot and peppery “Arabian
Nights,” which preceded it. The season
closes to-night (Thursday), when “Cop-
pelia,” the two-act ballet that introduced
Genee to Melbourne, will be revived for her
final appearance. On Saturday a 10-nights’
run of “Bella Donna” will be started, and
after that comes the Quinlan Opera Co. with
a repertoire of two dozen operas.

“The Marriages of Mayfair” differs so
widely in form and sentiment from such
weird sexodramas as “The Bad Girl of the
Bedroom’’ or “Why Women Mash -Men that
its nights at Melb. Princess’s are not likely
to be fourscore. It deals with dooks, and
turns upon the question whether the late
Lord Somebody married his second wife be-
fore his first wife died of inclement weather
in Switzerland. Many of its lines are cast
in the courtyards of the Tower of London,
and its supers are mostly Beefeaters, or
pearl-creamed damsels posing as English
plough-boys. The demarcations of social
caste are brought into heated discussion by
the foolishness of Uncle Dolphus in marry-
ing “beneath him,” and what should be the
brightest comedy scene in the whole outfit
represents the servants of an ancestral hall
as giving a month’s notice to the missis on
account of her plebeian origin and general
inadaptability to the customs of a proud
aristocracy. The idea of anybody woiki g
for a living, except at the music-halls, is
never once suggested during the action ot
the play. In short, it is the antithesis of
marlow-drama presented at a house where
Marlow lately reigned supreme. Its spec-
tacular requirements are planned on a scale
too heroic for the Princess’s stage, also its
acting possibilities are beyond the grasp o
the present co. at the theatre afore .
Nevertheless it comes as a relief after tne
Minx Without a Character or Ihe lart
Who Fell into the Soup.”

Life nowadays is too short for one to
track a long cast of characters through end-
less avenues of scrubby advts., but the
tity of several performers in this spasmodic

“On Our Selection” goes on rejoicing at
Melbourne King’s, where Bert Bailey and
Co. will cease to be after August 14.
x\t Melbourne Royal this is the 11th week
of “Within the Law,” and the story of the
innocent shop-girl who enlisted in the
crooks’ brigade and married her old boss’s
son is showing faint signs of tiredness. An
announcement of last nights is nearly due.
Next Saturday’s happenings at the haunts
of those Melbournians who neyer darken the
doors of a theatre (not that anybody ever
does it, for if a theatre door was so small
that any one person could darken it the
situation would be awful in case of tire) are
Dorothea Spinney in a matinee recital of a
Greek play at the Masonic Hall, a Peter
Dawson concert at the Town Hall, and
another Opera Pop at the Auditorium, where
the weekly Pop is growing into a habit.
Melbourne Majestic is concluding its
career as a picture theatre, and is about to
become the home of “volatile vaudeville,”
provided by a band of entertainers who call
themselves “The Butterflies” a n d hail from
London or thereabouts. In this connection
“thereabouts” is probably one of Prahran’s
aliases. The Butterflies commence their
flutter next Saturday night, August 2. in a
programme containing potted plays, pickled
chestnuts, songs, monologues and other dis-
turbances.
The Mawson Antarctic pictures at West’s,
Melbourne, reveal a land where living seems
cheap but unreliable, and where the wind
rises in insurrection every day in the week.
The snapshots of a blizzard blizzing its
worst are very impressive. “The Web” is
the title of West’s princioal drama. It is
the story of a lady of occasional virtue, who
plays the rble of the spider once too often
and becomes a subject for a coroner's in-
quest in the end.

AT POVERTY POINT.
“Booshee”: I was in the same company as the late
Armes Beaumont, at the Opera House, Melbourne,
during one of the Simonsen seasons' there, and the
easy manner in which, despite his partial blindness,
poor “Ted” used to move about the stage during the
performances struck me as being wonderful. At re-
hearsal he shuffled around with considerable restraint,
but at night he could come across a stage bridge
or down a flight of steps as easily and as gracefully
as the best of us. During the interval between the
acts he make himself familiar w th all the
stage set..ngs, such as furniture, garden beds, rock-
pieces, etc., and having got them photographed in
his mind, he could use them or avoid them without
awkwardness or hesitation. “Ted’s” unfortunate
lack of sight made the study of new music some-
what d : ffieult, but he had a good ear and a better
memory. Dear old Mrs. Simonsen used to say that
she had only to play a piece of music to him half
a dozen times and lie would be perfect in it.
The lack of sensuous charm in Genre’s wonderful
dancing is well expressed in James Douglas’s appre-
ciation of her, written a few years ago: “Her
coquetry is roguishly pure and impishly chaste. She
is a virginal romp, with the bright energy of Diana.
... .There is a merry irony in her rapture and in
her despair, and she eludes the burden of pleasure
as featlv as the burden of pain.... Her skill is made
out of infinite self-denial. This miracle of laughing
jov is the product of bitter toil and iron renuncia-
tion. Behind her radiant ecstasy of light gestures
and postures is the stern hardship of an athlete and
the passionless devotion of a nun.” The Genfe tem-
perament is not essential to a genius for the art,
though an exceptional strength: of purpose is neces-
sary to develop the genius. But the greatest mis-
tresses of the art seem to have had mostly the same
temperament. It is a long time since Balzac wrote,
“As cold as a danseuse.”
Another Australian photo, rtlay was screened this
week in Sydnev. This Was “The Jackeroo
(at the Grand), written for the Fraser
Film Release and Photographic Co. by J. H.
Wainright, and produced by W. B ranklyn Bar-
rett, who not long ago strikingly cinematographed a
series of whaling episodes in Southern waters for the
co. In “The Jackeroo,” the story carries its mam
ballast along a well-grooved track, but makes occa-
sional excursions into new surroundings. One of
these leads to an attack on a squatters homestead
bv a party of tame Binghis, preluded by a corroboree
of sorts. ‘ The big thrill of the piece is a horseback
dash down a creek-bed by the heroine, where, in
mid career, she is thrown into the water. This
paper was told that the lady did it on purpose, and
as it is The Bulletin’s golden rule never to con-
tradict a lady, the tale must go at that.
Bernard Espinasse’s one-act drama, “In the Dark,’
will get its first performance at the Frances Ross
matinfe in Melbourne to-day (Thursday). Walter
Baker has had the manuscript for years, stowed away
in a box with a four-act play by the same Aus-
tralian author. Re this unacted play, The Master
of Ravenstrom,” Baker goes into ecstasies when
anybody gets him on the subject of neglected genius.
He has never been able to produce it himself in the
wav he thinks it ought to be brought to light He
once read it to Meynell, who thought, or professed
to think, there was a lot of money in it. Possibly
the Williamson firm will give “The Master of Raven-
strom” a show one of these days.
“Mary Widder”: Dropped in to hear the new
kinetophone at the Sydney Lyceum the other night.
So far as it has gone it is a success, and promises
still better. But nine out of 10 of our star pictures
‘are either Italian—“ Quo Vadis?” f’rinstance—or
French ; and the galleryite isn’t going to pay his
sprat to hear someone carrying-on in Dago and dis-
turbing the peace and interrupting the picture. Jior
will a translation always fit. Some French and
Dago words need twice as many English words to
express them, and the picture can’t wait while the
extra words are being crowded in So though we
can look forward to having the English and American
pictures on the kinetophone, it seems as though the
big Italian films will have to remain silent—or pass
out in favor of the Australian article. For wmch
reason I’m giving three cheers for the kinetophone.
“Harrison O.”: Apparently it is quite impossible
to induce a musical-comedy chorus to pretend even
to take an interest in the twaddle that is talked and
sung by the principals. “Ah, but Bobby is a dear,
gurgles the leading lady, when the time comes for
her to bring forward some sort of an excuse for a
dittv “Would you like me to tell you about
Bobbv?” The tone of utter boredom in which the
chorus replies: “Yes, please tell us,” would freeze
the blood of Bobbv’s warmest admirer, but the un-
happv principal has to pretend that she has received
an enthusiastic invitation to burst into song. O!
course, the chances are that the chorus ladies 'have
Bobbies of their own, and cannot be expected to
become wildly excited about somebody else’s Bobb>,
but in common politeness they should simulate more
interest in the gentleman than they do. Besides,
they are paid to take an interest in Bobby. \et if
the poor fellow was a split infinitive or a report on
the bulk handling of grain they could not be more
indifferent about him.
The fight between Bourchier and Hansen for pos-
session of the London Garrick recalls something even
more willing that happened in old Melbourne. It
was at the liaymarket, afterwards snobbishly re-
christened the Duke of Edinburgh, on the site of the
present Eastern Arcade in Bourke-street. In that
case one party entrenched itself up aloft in the
gallery, while the other fought from behind ramparts
on the stage, and from tnese two fortresses they
bombarded each other with decayed vegetables and
other savory missiles for the best part of a week.
Writer disremembers which side won; and it.doesn t
matter, anyhow.
“Harrison O.”: I beg to announce that I have
formed myself into a committee of one, with power
to add to my number, and myself in the chair, for
the purpose of starting a Society for Scoffing at
Maeterlinck. By writing plays that mean notning,
or thereabouts, the Belgian person has succeeded in
bluffing a number of people that he means a great
deal. His play, “The Interior,” which has just been
perpetrated by Melbourne Repertory Theatre, is the
limit in the way of nebulous stodge. A girl has
been drowned, and a couple of dreary ancients spend
an hour or so in discussing the best method of break-
ing the news to her family. Finally one of the old-
sters whispers the tidings, the family makes grimaces
intended to be suggestive of intense grief, and the
curtain goes down. There is no plot, no dramatic
interest, no characterisation, and no suggestive dia-
logue. Yet to out this mere incident on the stage
Maeterlinck has had to employ various clumsy stage
devices, including a cottage with a transparent wall
and a room in which the occupants warm their hands
at a fire which the audience is invited to believe is
burning furiously in the vice-regal pen, just below
the footlights. Gregan McMahon’s patrons were ob-
viously bored to extinction by the playlet, and not
being able to understand what it meant, tried hard
to convince themselves that it meant something they
couldn’t understand.
(Continued on page 30.)
“0.K.” writes from Melbourne concerning
the dashed old crisis:—
Under cover of Tory press railings at the Watt
Ministry the chairman of the Country Party in the
Vic. Assembly fired a no-confidence motion last week.
At time of writing, the Watt Government seems
likely to be outvoted' by a combination of Tories
representing rural constituencies and Laborites re-
presenting town workers, the immediate cause of the
attack being a proposal to increase the number of
town electorates. One section of the anti-Govern-
ment conspiracy desires the proposed Redistribution
of Seats Bill, whereas the other section is violently
opposed to it, but they fused their conflicting in-
terests in their attempt to “out” the Government.
McLeod, the mover of the motion, has no legislative
purpose in common with the Labor party, which
supports him in this endeavor. The Labor party
excuses its unholy alliance with the Tories on the
principle that any stick is good enough to beat the
Liberals with. What will happen if the Watt
Ministry be outed nobody can say, except that Parlia-
ment will become quite useless to the State for some
weeks. The party Government system is discredited
anew. If the Victorian electors were given a referen-
dum chance to change it for an Elective Ministry sys-
tem they would vote “Yes,” and bless the crisis that,
brought the change about. As things are, they can
only d —n the crisis

“Hermes”—his tale: —
It cost the Bulgarians months of fighting, thou-
sands of lives and a mint of treasure to take Adrian-
ople, and within six weeks it took them about five
minutes to lose it to a force of cavalry, above all
things. The downfall of Bulgaria) is astounding, and
it is one of those things that Australia should read,
mark, learn and inwardly assimilate in its stomach.
A small nation of about four and a half millions can
put only one first-class army into the field, and when
that army is buried, the nation is practically done.
And Bulgaria had been building up its fighting force
for about 20 years, training every man, without any
exception or exemption, to be a soldier. It was a
splendid force that took Kirk Kilisse and swept the
Turks like sheep from Lule Burgas to Tchorlu, and
chased them to the lines of Tehatald.ja ; but it was
an army that was dying all the way, and by the
time it reached the last stage the original outfit was
largely dead or in hospital. In every battle it was
the best and bravest who died, and the inferiors who
survived. By the time the Turk was smashed the
army was composed mostly of the inferiors. But the
inferiors had swelled head, and they cheerfully
attacked the Greeks and Serbs, who had not lost their
first and best armies. The result was disastrous. The
Bulgarian was a spent wave, and to-day his coun-
try is at the last gasp, so utterly done that a force
of cavalry retakes his greatest conquest after five
minutes fighting. Under the best circumstances, Aus-
tralia could not hope to put anything like as good
an army into the field as Bulgaria did. It would not
have had the training, nor would it have the backing
of the splendid artillery that Ferdinand had starved
his country to buy. So what sort of a plight would
we be in after about three battles? It is said there
are not enough anaesthetics in the continent to see
more than the wounded of one pitched battle through.
What military organisation we have is woefully be-
hind in the matter of caring for the wounded ; and
these things cannot be built up in a day. They should
be organised now, and be in a state of constant readi-
ness. Also, the Defence Act should be so amended
that every able-bodied man under 40 will have a
place in the ranks, and be compelled to undergo
training right now. The smash of Bulgaria shows
that it is necessary to have every man trained if a
nation of four and a half millions is going to show
a good face to the enemy, and at present Australia
has hardly a man trained ; neither has it arms for
them if they were trained, let alone a reserve of arms
to make good the loss in a battle. Even the Turk
had that. In the flight from Lule Burgas half the
troops abandoned their weapons, but at Tchorlu the
Unspeakable had another supply waiting, so that his
men at least could make some sort of a stand, though
half their bullets were made of wood. Could the
Australian War Department re-arm 30.000 men after
a mad retreat from, say, Gosford to Strathfield? No
hope! Cook claims to have evolved the present
Defence svstem, and the question is: What is he going
to do to make his alleged creation something like a
real fighting machine? At present, it is a toy and a
make-believe.
THE LAWYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Waller cross-examined in the recognised pro-
fessional manner ; his cynical grunt, his ill-concealed
sneers* his habit of gazing round the court after
receiving an answer which he considered favorable
to his case, and his relentlessness in pressing awk-
ward questions, were all entirely in character. —Prets
notice of “A Butterfly on the Wheel.”
A lawyer has horsehair on top of his head,
But the sense of the horse ain’t below it;
With daily refreshers he has to be fed
(If he isn’t, his hirer will know it).
He has all the grace of the pig and its tricks ;
To perform he is ready and willing;
He’ll quiver with rage for a mere ten-and-six
Or shed counterfeit tears for a shilling.
A friend in the box mattfers less than a fee
And no chivalrous qualms will restrain him ;
He will “trap” his witness with devilish glee
Till the onlooker wishes to brain him.
And if the poor witness’s well-refreshed shark
Should rise up in defence of his beauty,
The worrying monster proclaims with a bark
That he’s doing an unpleasant duty.
The Law is an ass that will carry no weight;
It’s a cow —but no use to a dairy,
A pig that will never appear on a plate,
And a snake of which all must be chary.
It brays and it bellows —it hisses and grunts ;
It will sting, it will stun, it will gnaw yer.
To sum up, and reviewing all his quaint stunts,
Quite the best work of God is a lawyer—
A deceased and short-circuited lawyer.

“Piston-rod”: The unique position that
marine engineers hold in the industrial world
was illustrated on board the Union S.S.
Co.’s big new liner, Niagara, on July 25.
The vessel was lying in Port Jackson, due to
sail within two days for Vancouver, B.C.
On the date mentioned an argument arose
as to whether the engine-room staff was
•entitled to Saturday afternoon off when in
port, or, failing that, overtime. The com-
pany refused the claim, whereupon the whole
Filin’ gave 24 hours’ notice of the termina-
tion of their engagements with the co. That
was on Friday, and the ship had to get
away on Monday. Saturday came, and the
•engines were deserted. Presumably, the
•co. had been under the delusion that the
•engineers would not take the final step,
•otherwise the trouble would never have got
so far. For the co. knew well enough that,
if the men’s places were filled for the voyage,
the probabilities were that the engines on
every ship in the fleet would suddenly cease
to whirl and revolute. Finding the face of
the inevitable at the window, the co. hur-
riedly went astern, the engineers logged a
victory, and the Niagara sailed to schedule.
A KINDLY HINT.
Our artist getting the tip from the gentle
editor not to bring up any more vaccination
Jokes.
Before sentencing a couple of Melbourne
girls to eight years’ gaol, for attempting to
murder a Mrs. King, Chief Justice Madden
went moralising, as usual. “But for Mrs.
King having noticed the discoloration of
her tea,” said his Honor, “the prisoners
would probably now be leaving the dock
for the gallows.” That was hardly logical.
If Mrs. King had not noticed the discolora-
tion, and had drank the poisoned tea, she
would probably have died in great haste.
Then her visitor might have departed un-
known and unsuspected, and the law would,
as likely as not, have convicted Mr. King
because he had a dead wife on the premises.
The points on which the conviction rested
were that Mrs. King didn’t drink the pois-
oned tea; that she consequently remained
alive to identify her visitor; and that the
visitor broke down and wrecked her case by
foolish admissions. John Madden may be a
good Judge, but if he were John Hop Mad-
den he might not be a first-class detective.
* * * *
A section of the medical profession came
out of the Melbourne small-pox scare with
small credit. When the rush for the lymph
first started one or two public vaccinators
boasted of having “put through” 660 and
700 subjects per day. As the State paid
them 2s. 6d. per inoculation, they were thus
earning from £BO to £9O daily. This struck
the Government as somewhat too hot, so the
figure, for adults, was brought from 2s. 6d.
to Is. per arm —or leg, as the case might be.
Then did the doctors arise with howls of pro-
test and of resignation. The Depart-
ment countered by establishing public vacci-
nation depots in the suburbs, at which the
State-employed surgeons were paid £3 3s. per
day—of four or five hours. Not exactly
lavish, but a fair enough thing, considering
the toil and skill involved. Some private
medicoes exploited the boom to still better
purpose, charging up to 10s. 6d. per inocu-
lation —£3 3s. for a family of six, say 15
minutes’ work.
The sport of kings and other dubiosities
must surely be at a low ebb in England, or
else it ran up against a Judge who didn’t
take the horse seriously. The charges
which Sievier of the Winning Post —one
time a bookmaker in Australia, and famous
by reason of having smitten a branch of
the British peerage in a bar on the ground,
or alleged ground, that the branch didn’t
meet his liabilities —brought against Rich-
ard Wootton, racehorse trainer, and also
one-time of Australia, represented about as
large a heap of corruption as could be put
in the space occupied by the state-
ments. The Court did a great think, and
found that Sievier had spoken falsely when
he accused Wootton of defiling the sport of
kings in the manner alleged. And it gave
Wootton one farthing—-one-fourtli of a
penny; one forty-eighth portion or section
or fraction or insect of a bob —as satisfac-
tion. Now, what is the value of the repu-
tation of the sport of kings on this farthing
basis? If one accused Caesar’s wife of
shoplifting or public intoxication, and the
charge being disproved Mrs. Caesar was
awarded as near as possible to nothing in
complete satisfaction, she would probably be
a more infuriated Latin matron than if she
had got nothing at all. A Court may decide
against a man’s character by mistake, and
then he can anpeal. But when a Court
decides cordially in his favor —-when it re-
vives that he has been wrongfully blighted,
and that jd. will pay the whole blight—
then he begins to wonder what the Court
meant. Did it think the adversary was
such a poor lot that the worst he could
say was only worth dd. ? Or did it think
all the character the plaintiff ever had could
be fully repaired for id.? Or did it think
the horse-race game was so low down that
no squabble concerning the wretched thing
could be worth more than id.?
“Chasuble”: The ecclesiastical bosses in
Melbourne now talk of removing St.
James’s Cathedral altogether. The old
brown stones, they say, should be carted
northward to some place where sacred prop-
puty is of far less value. Surely a crown-
ing piece of impudence! About 1840 the
Anglicans cadged and got for nothing a
whole block between Collins and Bourke
streets —all for the holy work ! St.
James’s was built, with its schools
on the Bourke-streefc end. Then
some financial genius achieved the
slicing-off of the Collins-street
frontage for warehouses. The
fruits were sweet; so the hus-
bandmen of the vineyard further
proceeded to slice off the William-
street frontages. Sweet fruits
again ! But, brethren, why stay
your hands? Millions in it! Slice
off the Bourke-street frontages!
And away they went. After that
more slicing, until only the church
was left, with a tiny bit of land.
Now, brethren, let us finish with
the whole swag. No church at all on the
consecrated ground! It can be far more
profitably employed. Whv keep a church
where land is worth £5OO a foot? God
and mammon bid for it. Knock it down to
mammon !

The cause:—
Within the last few days a number of the prettiest
and most charming lady members of the dramatic
and vaudeville companies travelling between Sydney
and Melbourne, have, in order to guard against the
risk of disfigurement, been vaccinated on the leg
instead of the arm. — Evening paper.
The effect: —
There has been a very marked improvement in the
manner in which the vaccination examiners carry out
their duties at Albury. The examination of pas-
sengers, particularly lady passengers, is now of a
very minute and lengthy character ; and the wonder-
fully willing and cheerful manner in which the
officials concerned perform their duties is worthy of
the warmest praise— Press report (later).

nate bay has been dredged so that the Cera-

knock its legs against the sea-bottom. But
this is, after all, a mere postponement of the
evil day. When the White Star Company
builds in quick succession the Chronic

the Hectic (23,000 tons), the Cryptic and
the Sheep-tick (25,000 tons), the Apoplectic
(26,500 tons), the Lunatic (28,000 tons),
and vessels of that sort, Melbourne "will be
finished as a first-rate port. And when the
Dyspeptic, of 30,000 tons, comes along, the
place will be a jest. Then William Watt’s
State will realise that the wretched Conges-
tion and One-Bloated-City policy has drop-
ped it in the mud. Melbourne can’t accom-
modate first-class modern vessels, yet it ob-
jects to Portland and Western Port being
put to any real use. So the Emetic (31,500
tons), and the Scorbutic and the Corybantic
(33,000 tons) will unload their Victorian
cargo at Hobart, and what was once Austra-
lia’s greatest city will be left bn a branch
line, so to speak.
Bertram Murray is a financial agent in
the fair city of Sydney, and to him there
came recently one Moeller, to sell an interest
he held in a Yankee estate. Upon inquiry it
was found that Moeller held the interest he
represented, and Murray, through his man-
ager, purchased it for £7B. The manager
also intimated that if Moeller could induce
any other members of the family to sell their
interests, a commission would be paid. Later
on Moeller brought along “my brother Bob,”
and Robert parted with his interest for £55,
of which he had collected £5O before Murray
discovered he was an object of suspicion.
Bertram Murray took such a violent dislike
to him that the alleged brothers appeared
before Judge Docker on a charge of con-
spiracy, to which Bob pleaded guilty, but of
which Moeller declared he was innocent.
Moeller’s story of how the base one imposed
upon him was pathetic. The alleged relative
had hailed him in a drinkery by his right
name and announced that he was “Bob.” As
Moeller had not seen Bob since he was a
boy of 12, Moeller had to take him on trust.
He believed the tale, and now he was pained
and shocked to discover that Robert’s name
was Noon, and not Moeller. Also, he was
horrified at the wicked trick played upon
himself and Murrav Noon swore this was
a fairy tale. He clamored that Moeller had
induced him to do what he had done, and
had collared half the booty. The jury be-
lieved Noon, and said “Guilty” ; whereupon,
the Judge tore off 18 months’ quod for
Moeller and nine months for Noon. There
should be material for a good drama in
Bob.

A railway in S. Aus. was opened in a
primitive and patriarchal way this month.
In the old days the inauguration of a new
line meant much champagne and other bev-
erages, which for the most part went down
the throats of politicians. In the latest
instance, however —the railway was a light
one, opening up new agricultural country—
the method adopted to mark the completion
of the work was to ask as many of the folk
residing near at hand as cared to do so to
take a free ride to the remote terminus in
the middle of nowhere. About 200
rustics trooped into the trucks in response.
Reaching their night’s destination they left
the train for the adjacent scrub, and, find-
ing a cosy place, proceeded to boil their
billies and get the supper, for the official
invitation did not run to victrnls. An im-
promptu concert followed, at which all and
singular lent a cheerful voice. After that
the company coiled itself up in its rug and
slept until it was time to board the train
again in the morning.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is glaringly unjust that men are permitted
to indulge unscathed in wickednesses that over-
whelm a woman with social damnation. We shall
never rest till we have brought about the abolition
of this unjust inequality. —The say-so of an in-
dignant newer woman in Melbourne.
Since woman cowered in the cave,
And for the wild pre-Adamites
Sewed ’possum skins their hides to save,
The sex has hungered for its rights.
It saw man roaring on a jag,
And suffering no consequence,
Beyond an early morning fag
And fretful Eve’s habitual nag.
Slowly the sex saw the immense
Injustice of its abstinence.
The man who burked a social code
Was not incontinently rubbed
From Mrs. Grundy’s list; no goad
Was used on him; he was not clubbed ;
Nay, people said he was “a sport”—
A troglodytish Nut he stood
In highest favor at the Court,
And fattened on all ill-report.
The sullen woman understood —
The bonds were hers; she must be good.
And in our time the creed survives—
The gay old dogs have social grace.
Apply such phrases to their wives,
And ruin stares them in the face....
But woman rises in her might
This inequality to ban—
She’ll fight all day, and talk all night
With deathless zeal to expedite
Her true but well disguis&d plan:
The right to be as bad as man!

“Y.ZEvictions are less frequent in
Sydney, • Melbourne and Adelaide than
before the advent of the baby bonus. I have
come across several cases of tenants, well
behind with the rent, being permitted to
linger on by reason of the financial aspect
of one of the ladies of the household. The
signs and symptoms of approaching mater-
nity have now a recognised commercial value.
In poorer suburbs a would-be tenant can se-
cure a change of residence without displaying
a certified rent-book, chronicling payments
to date, if the agent is satisfied, from the
general outlook, that £5 are in prospect.
Of course appearances are sometimes deceit-
ful, and agents are liable to be beguiled, but
on the whole the bonus is proving a boon to
landlords. It is now only necessary for
the lawyers to devise some means by which
the property-owner may get a first mortgage

“Hard-a-port”: N.S.W. Navigation De-
partment suddenly arose from its slumbers
last week and angrily pursued a citizen for
not lighting up his motor boat. About three
months ago this oil coracle or argosy, while
roosting at its moorings in Neutral Bay
(Port Jackson) was run down and sunk by
another benzine caique or sampan. The
colliding owner put the accident down to
the fact that the collidee had no anchor
light visible. The Navigation Department
hereabouts got up steam and towed the col-
lider to the Water Police Court, where a
stern magistrate (the bow one was having
a watch below) fined him ss. The joke of
this lies in the fact that the sunken launch
had brooded on the waters of Neutral Bay
for 1000 nights without a light, unheeded
by the look-out of the Department. Also
about 1000 other motor-boats, yachts,
catamarans, arles, bilanders, polaccas and
praams are moored in various parts of Svd-
ney Harbor, with narv an anchor light
amongst them. To be logical, the naviga-
tion authorities must take summonses out
against the entire fleet. Perhaps the fleet
will take a tip and show a glim in its fore-
rigging. This will save the said authorities
being logical. It is a difficult job to be
logical these days.

THE FINAL COMMENT.
SAN FRANCISCO, Saturday.—“There is no reason in the world why a person should ever die.” declared
Harry Gaze, the editor of LIFE CULTURE and author of “Bow to Live For Ever.” “At 100 years,” he
said yesterday, “a person should be better to look at and more fit to live than at 40. Death is merely
a habit.”
“That's a big funeral. Who's getting buried?"
“Oh, that's young Woggs—the famous author of ‘How to Live for 200 Years.’”

bourne courts, a prisoner who was giving
evidence in his own defence, chose to be
rather critical as regards kissing the Bible.
It was a dirty-looking book, and his method
of avoiding the cover with his lips was
severely criticised. Finally he pecked at it
again and was considered to be properly
fixed on his blessed “Bible oath.” Surely
the time has arrived for abolishing all formal
oath-taking in courts of law. Why are

them. The absurdity of oath-taking js
frankly admitted by judge and jury in
divorce cases, where a male co-respondent is
almost invariably regarded as a dawg if he
outrages the conventionalities of social life
by not committing perjury.
“McNorth,” from the Place of Reefs: —
When the Australian destroyers, Warrego, Parra-
matta and Yarra visited Torres Strait recently, the
admiration of old skippers was aroused by a fine exhi-
bition of seamanship. The manner in which the
speedy little streaks ducked and dodged in and out and
between the sandbanks, and slipped round nasty rocky
corners on one wheel, so to speak, impressed those
who knew the whereabouts of the submerged dangers.
The destroyers would rush at 20 knots through nar-
row passages, where tramps would fear to steam
dead slow, and when an ugly waiting reef appeared
suddenly right ahead and disaster seemed imminent,
they would scornfully side-step or back-pedal. It
was a cheerful and hopeful sight for us who live
on the doorstep nearest Asia. Bat the remark of a
bull-necked Jap diver damped us for the moment.
“Yes,” he said, “ver’ goo’, ver’ goo’ ship. But is
that all you got ?”
“Foe”: The sturdy Anti-Socialist who
lives on Sydney’s North Shore deserves all
he gets from his friend, the ferry monopoly.
On account of the reduced boat service, there
are now less trams, and every corner is
decorated with waiting, overcoated suburban-
ites, who keep themselves warm, not to say
overheated, with loud and furious argument.
The Anti-Socialist’s line or circle of reason-
ing seems to run this way:—
(1.) Er—well, yes! Perhaps the Private Enter-
prise boat service is unsatisfactory. (Grudging
admission made after much argument.)
(2.) But the dashed State railway service is also
unsatisfactory. (Exp.osive bellow tinged with pro-
fanity.)
(3.) If the d —d State ran the boats, they would
be a d —d sight worse than they are now. (Loud and
savagely triumphant howl.)
(4.) Therefore, the Private Enteiytrise boat service
isn’t really unsatisfactory at all. %
Of course, No. 4 is never really put into
plain language. It is just indicated by a
puffing out of the cheeks and a furling of the
umbrella; also, by a sidelong look of hatred
and distrust. So far as I can see, the Anti-
Socialist accepts the Ferries Co., with all
its shortcomings, because he thinks it is
better than Johnson would be if he got the
chance. Is there no escape from Johnson
and the Ferry Co., and can neither of them
be improved or abolished? Also, is it quite
impossible to get the Anti-Socialist out of his
habit of thinking in curves?
“Nemo” on an absurdity:—
Hungry people are usually discontented and not
inclined for graft. But jurymen are supposed to be
unlike other people, and to work better when starved.
Lately, Justice Hodges (Vic.) was trying, at Sale,
a laborer for an attempt to commit something or
other. In fact, he was accused of aggravated thing-
umbob. The jury was locked up considering its
verdict, at the usual luncheon hour; and at half-past
two, as it was getting very hungry, the foreman sent
a message to the Judge asking him to let the 12
hollow men and true have something to eat. Now
listen to the Law’s wisdom: “If they were trying a
man for his life, the sheriff could take them out to
an hotel and give them lunch ; but as the case before
them was not a capital one, he could not let that be
done; and he couldn’t give them anything in the
jury room, because no one but an officer of the
court could enter that room.” Nobody seemed to
think of asking the Judge that a couple of criers
should take some grub into the jury room. In the
days of the old Supreme Court, in Latrobe-street,
a man like old Judge Molesworth would have settled
the business in a quarter-hour. He would have sent
over a message to Councillor John Anderson, of the
Supreme Court Hotel, and Councillor John would
have sent to the court 12 lunches by one man, and
the criers would have carried the tucker into the
jury, and made 12 men happy, and there would
have been a verdict. But in this case the jury was
allowed to do a perish, and nobody need be surprised
that it wasn’t able to agree, wherefore the country
will be put to the heavy cost of another trial.
In Melbourne, last week, a despondent
saddler suicided in a way which should
presently lend a new interest to the lives of
local wayfarers. He hanged himself by his
neck till he was dead, not in a room
or an outhouse, as is the time-honored cus-
tom, but from a conspicuous tree m the back
garden, where his body could be seen by
passers-by. His inevitable imitators will
probably choose the front garden for hanging
themselves in, and a stroll along quiet
streets (the saddler hanged out in South
Yarra) will be full of startling possibilities.
If the suicide occurs during the night or
early morning, the shock of surprise at this
quaint spectacle will fall to the milkman or
paper-boy.
A religiously humorous feature of the
funeral of Emily Davison, the demented suf-
fragette who tried to stop the English Derby
race from proceeding, was a banner inscribed
“She hath done what she could.” Suffra-
gettes, like evangelists and all other cru-
saders, evidently attach solemn significance
to the use of the words “hath” and “saith,”
instead of “has” and “says.” A banner bear-
ing the vulgar device, “She did what she
could,” would have meant the same thing,
but there would have been no holiness about
it. The Bible way of indicating poor Miss
Davison’s exceeding foolishness might be con-
sistently rounded off with “Thus saith the
Lord!” whereas one can’t imagine the Lord
saying that Emily just did what she could.
There’s a lot of virtue in an “hath” where
a funeral is concerned and a prayer is in-
vited. Edmund Fisher must have been
vaguely conscious of the effect of Biblical
phraseology when he sang:—
Perchance my readers, vers’d
In rhymesters’ tricks, will tell Me why
A bard resorts to “thou” and “thy”
Whose soul is on the burst.
There were other impressive banners in the
suffragette procession, such as “Thoughts
have gone forth whose power can sleep no
more,” but none of them carried so much
parsonic weight as “She hath done what
she could.” The funniest incident of the
affair was provided by the police. Mrs.
Pankhurst, temporarily released from prison,,
that sjie might convalesce after her hunger-
strike, was about to enjoy a carriage drive
(or carriage walk) to the cemetery, as
mourner-in-chief, when the police remarked
that if she was well enough to attend a
funeral, she was well enough to return to
chokee. So the Pankhurst brougham, drawn
by a pair of fine, fat Pankhurst horses,
went empty to the funeral, preceded and fol-
lowed by bands of bemedalled hunger
strikers, whilst the High Priestess was be-'
ing quietly taken back to the place where
she refuseth to eat, neither ith her
forcibly injected.
QUITE A PLEASURE.
A number of policewomen were recently appointed in
Seattle, and now San Francisco is following suit.
"By jove, old chap , I wouldn't mind ban
pinched! Would you?"
An indigent Northcote (Vic.) woman
had a stroke of luck lately. She wanted
money worse than she had ever wanted it
in her life. So she decided to splash a
couple of half-sovereigns on two starters
in the recent Flemington “Nationals.” The
prads she picked were both rank outsiders,
and she gave the fl to a neighbor to invest
for her on the course. When she saw in
the papers that both her beasts had won she
had a fit, and nresently fled to that bourne
where the horses are understood to wear
wings and no dead ones are allowed to start.
That was where her luck came in, for her
envoy had been persuaded to let the out-
siders rip and put the money on two fav-
orites. So she died happily, and missed
the disappointment of her life.

HE was the last drunk, come to the
alcoholic end of all things.
The sun was setting in a brand}'
and port wine blaze of splendor, as the
drunk looked upon it with wistful eyes. For
he was lonely, this last drunk, and there
was not so much as one fly left to drink with,
even had he felt inclined for a Jimmy
W oodser.
The sun sank lower and lower, flushing
the absinthine opal of the sea to a deeper
chartreuse.
The drunk’s eyes grew more and more
wistful. ±le was steeped in a reverie, re-
calling the glad comradeship and merry
songs of earlier sprees. He could see
nothing for it, no future but an eternity of
“mornings after” without the compensation
of “evenings before.” The prospect made
him shudder.
But he was a valiant drunk. He deter-
mined to die, true till the last to the ethics
of the taproom. .. .riotous, unrepentant.
lie got up and shook himself, as it were,
to re-aerate the stale sodawater of his soul.
Next he shook hands with himself, a good
rollicking handgrip, and.... again he looked
towards the sunset.
What magic visions he now saw
materialised for him there! What a wealth
of beckoning fingers called to him from the
west! Lovely barmaidens summoned him
to the celestial bar —Connie, Moll, Alice,
Arethusa, Maud —-there were they all wait-
ing to welcome his coming !
Hastily he mixed himself a glass of gin
fizz, and after toasting it up toward these
Ohloes of the Sunset, drank it down to their
next merry meeting.
For he was a new drunk now. Here w r as
the thing before him to be done. Here was
a realm of Eternal Toot clamoring for his
soul. He sampled three gin fizzes in the
space of as many minutes. Then, his soul
large within him, he mounted an empty beer
casK and decided to act.
He acted. With a voice hoarse with
emotion, lie invoked the spirits of very long
dead drunks. He sounded a reveille that
echoed through interminable tavern courts.
And 10, the charm of his incantation
worked !
Standing there on the beer cask he saw
approaching him from all quarters the
Army of the Bars. They came in serried
battalions, marching riotously through
devious tavern ways, and ranged them-
selves around their acknowledged leader, the
Last and Only Drunk.
Great was the sound of revelry in their
coming. Champagne corks popped merrily.,
Thousands of dusty throats gurgled in-
cessant, Fried Fish shops joined in the;
jovial rout. From north, from south, from
east, from west came miles-long lines of
blushing lobsters, stale counter lunches, im-'
petuous prawns, dissolute Dead Marines —
such a crowd as was never before known.
Then the Drunk addressed them.
“Friends,” he said, “Ichabod, Ichabod, the
glory has departed. I am the last left on
the earth. I am the See-er-of-them-all-out.
But a new land awaits us there in the sun-
set —there in the great Saloon Bars of
Beyond we may win Fat Heads to all In-
finity. Follow, follow me !”
As he called out this last command he
leapt down from the beer cask, and with the
fervor of three thousand and three stars in
his eyes and three hundred thousand beer
leaves in his hair he tramped towards the
Sunset, spurred onward by a Great Ideal
and four gin fizzes.
After him followed the myrmidons of his
merry makings—the soldierly bearing of the
blushing lobsters, the perfect marching of
the Dead Marines in striking contrast to
the wobbly gait of the stale Counter
Lunches and the utterly dissolute prawns.
The Sunset was at hand.
The Last Drunk, now maddened with
anticipation, called loudly to the Chloes of
the Sunset to “Fill-’em-up-all-round,” and
at once there was a clinking of celestial
glasses and a wild flutter of supernal Dish
Cloths. The sound inspired him, the sight
m,ade music in his throat, and, with a cry
of dreadful triumph, first the Drunk and
then his followers leapt over the edge of the
world to their doom.
As they were hurtled down the abyss the
visions of the Sunset changed. A very tot-
tering old man, bent and rheumy-eyed,
waited their arrival. He wept while he
waited, maundering in his senility.
Then there came a flop—and the Last
Drunk and his pals were poured out upon the '
floor of the Sunset. The Old Man picked up
some pieces of ruined prawns. For a moment
a glad light flashed from his eyes as he sniffed
at the falling Dead Marines, but it was the
last expiring spark. Weeping more bitterly
than ever, he tottered up to the recumbent
Drunk and bade him rise.
With a blank look of terror on his face the
Last Drunk looked around the Sunset, dazily
wiping lobster shells from his eyes and hair.
He could not speak for a minute. .. .his
tongue clove to his mouth....his soul was
flatter than overnight beer.
The Old Man watched him moonily a
moment. Then slowly he drew a flask from
the dinner-waggon cupboard and sucked pen-
sively, sadly the liquor it contained, mutter-
ing between each palsied draught: “O miser-
able me! O poor old Bacchus that lam !’’
Suddenly, from amid the debris of old
associations, the Drunk leapt up, scattering
counter-lunch like hail around him. There
was a savage glitter in his eye. His hands
were trembling as, with one bound, he
clutched the flask from the drinking Bac-
chus. Eagerly he placed it to his lips, the
liquor was half-way down his arid throat.. .
and then he realised !
“What. ... What is this? Where are
the” But he never finished the sentence.
With a loud cry he hurled the flask at the
aged, doddering Bacchus, and gasping in
agony. “Lime juice and soda !” he fell back
dead. '
So ended the Last Drunk!

“T. 8.”: When “J.J.C.” (B. 5/6/T3)
wrote that barramundi were to be found in nearly
all the coastal rivers north of Capricorn, as far
round as Kimberley, he must have meant the gigan-
tic perch. I have caught this latter fish in most
rivers from the Fitzroy, at Rockhampton, to the
Albert, in the Gulf. There are mobs of them any-
where along the coast, especially in winter. I have
landed them at a weight of 481 b., but they grow
heavier than that; are of splendid flesh, and eatable
up to any size. Fresh or salt water suits them
equally well; they are free biters, and a small mullet
is about the best bait—but it must be kept moving.
The Dawson River barramundi, referred to by “Plat-
man,” is a different fish altogether. It has large
scales and pink spots, hard bone on the roof of the
mouth, and, although it will bite at anything (in-
cluding a piece of red rag), is very difficult to hook.
The beast has no dorsal fin, and, as far as my know-
ledge goes, has never been caught in salt water. In
the Dawson its weight limit is about 51b., but far-
ther north it goes much heavier.

“Ela” vindicates the Papuan’s courage:
“S.S.S.” (B. 8/5/’l3) had bad luck with ner
Papuan crew in that capsize she talks about. The
Papuan is rarely the idiot that “S.S.S.” paints him,
and he does not commonly treat the saving of a fel-
low human’s life as a piece of low comedy. During
several years of whaleboat journeyings along the
Papuan coast I have been in many a capsize, and
never once have I seen the native behave as did
“S.S.S.’s.’’ Colonel Murray, our Governor, owes his
invaluable life to the assistance he received from his
nigger police during a spill on the bar of the
Purari River; and numerous others can quote ex-
periences of a similar nature. Only last year an
accident occurred near Hula by which a white
trader lost his life, and through their efforts to save
him two natives lost their own lives —an unpleasant-
ness they could have avoided had they looked to
themselves instead of to their master. To give the
unclothed savage of these regions his due, he shows
as much nerve and resource in times of trial as
most persons. [As a matter of fact, “S.S.S.” has
never suggested anything less.—Ed. B.]
“Venturino”: The good old days are, sure
enough, far off and vague. Even Binghi moves
with modem invention and leaves Romance rotting
on the Forgotten Trails. Met one of him recently
at Warratta Vale, Eyre Peninsula (S.A.), who told
me he had learned of a big corroboree that was
going to happen at Port Augusta, and intended to
grace (or should it be grease?) it with his pre-
sence. He had collected his gin and other per-
sonal belongings, consisting of five dogs and a billy-
can, and was moving on. “How d 6 you know,” I
said to him, “that this corroboree is going to take
place?’* “Oh, news come roun’,” he answered.
My mind jumped to “talking sticks,” smoke signals
and so on (Port Augusta being 170 miles away).
“Yes, but how news comes round?” “Oh, from up
there.” “You bin makem smoke talk?” Our
guileless brother looked at me curiously with his
gravy eyes, and I felt he took me for an immi-
grant. “No dam’ fear,” he said. “News come
alonga wire. Bin gettem policeman Port Augusta
sendem telegram.”
“John Phoenix”: The tallest telegraph
pole in Australia stands at Tindall, Manning River
(N.S.W.). From its hoof, which is planted 10ft.
underground, to its bald head is 102 ft. of timber
in two sections, the lower being ironbark and the
upper of Oregon pine. Six stay wires have kept the
mast in a state of rectitude since it was raised, a
matter of 28 years ago.

“Silas Snell” : Those people of Hibernian
habits of mind who regard a landlord as the visible
embodiment of all the seven devils, are invited to
consider the sorrowful lot of John Wallow. He is
possessed of scattered suburban properties that bring
him in over £2OO a week. John, who had his be-
ginnings in a cowyard in the same suburb, was a
small, scrubby man who thought he was over-dressed
when compelled to wear a shirt—an industrious little
man who cut his own hair, and gashed his moustache
straight across with a hedge clipper, and
was in danger of having buns given to him by the
compassionate if he stood alone on a street corner
for a moment. Of late months the landlord’s agony
had developed in John Wallow to such an extent that
his friends and relations were always mani-
festing the liveliest concern. All landlords have one
particular sorrow: their rest is disturbed by the
horrid fear of tenants escaping by night. John
always had this uneasiness, but with the growth of
his possessions the terror grew until he could no
longer sleep o’ nights. Mr. Wallow would retire
to his couch, like any plain citizen, and turn on
his keel to sleep ; but presently came a cold, haunt-
ing fear that some tenant a month in arrears was
rushing his belongings into a van preparatory to
shooting the moon. John would try to fight down
his apprehension, but eventually it would become
too strong for him, and he would steal from his
bed, and sneak away in trousers and boots to satisfy
himself that his agonies of fear were unfounded.
At length the delusion became so powerful that he
would be in and out of his bed 10 times a night.
He turned up at all hours, prowling about his pro-
perties. He was caught in the dark, early hours
of morning, listening at the keyholes of reputable
citizens, or peering in at bedroom windows. Twice
he was locked up as a suspected person, but the
police got to know John’s eccentricity, and when
they found him sneaking about the peaceful home
of a sleeping ratepayer they gathered him in, and
returned him to his distressed relations, C.O.D.
John escaped the police for a time by getting on
roofs, and conducting his investigations down
chimneys, or by roosting in trees, patiently awaiting
the appearance of an incriminating van. Some-
times the terror took him by day, and he would
seat himself on the kerb before the front gate of
the suspect, and lurk for hours. When fear of two
derelictions possessed him at once he would put in
a day running from house to house, falling over
dogs and very small children in his haste. Finally
a belief that all his tenants were escaping simul-
taneously led to such a demonstration of flurry that
he was seized by common consent, and
officially repressed. His idea that one hundred ten-
ants who owe him 10 years’ rent are rushing their
house furniture into one hundred vans, with the
intention of levanting to parts unknown, makes his
case the most distressing one in the whole institution.
EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE.
MRS ALLOT : “ Well , I alius did say you never knoo how to treat a boss, Bill Allot.
Here y e've been drivin ' im ’arf the year in a hice cream cart , an’ the other ’arf with
a red ’ot saverloy injun up agin his
tail. Even a boss can t stand ex-
tremes op ’ot an’ cold like that."
“Eddyson”: Probably no married couple
disagreed with more marked enthusiasm and perti-
nacity than Barney Dunn and his wife Eliza. They
disagreed about everything, and when there was
nothing to disagree about, they disagreed about it.
Finally, when they had thrown everything movable,
and had called each other all conceivable things,
and there was nothing more to be said or done to
express their mutual detestation, Mrs. Dunn put
on her hat and shawl, and, standing on Barney’s
doormat, bade him adieu. “I’m goin’, yeh dog,”
said Mrs. Barney. “’Tis true I’ll not be long
livin’, but I’d spare meself th’ misery iv seein’ yer
face bechune me ’n’ the sun, I would. When I’m
gone, ye’ll know it. I’ll come to yeh then, ’n’ I’ll
never lave yeh. ’Twill matter nothin’ t’ me whin
I’m dead th’ ugliness of yeh, an’ th’ maneness of
yeh, so from me cor-r-pse I’ll come t’ yeh, an’
remimber, nothin’ ’ll ever dhrive me away—nothin’,
nothin’! The ghost will shtay by yeh, Barney
Dunn, t’ plague yeh, an’ tormint yeh wid sickness,
an’ sorrer, an’ th’ long, black strokes iv ill-luck.
So sit yeh down, Barney Dunn, an’ ate yer fingers
from yeh, bidin’ till me ghost comes!” For 11
months Barney heard nothing of his wife. Then
came news of her death in Melbourne. Next morn-
ing, Dunn, conversing with his neighbor Hogue over
a rail fence, told him casually: “Me wife come last
night, an’ put cold sorrer in me bed.” Later, he
explained a black eye to Ivers. “’Twas me wife’s
ghost clipped me be th’ face, as I rid home whin
the moon went black on me to-morrow’s a week.”
Barney told Quitter at the pub: “I’m takin’ no
joy in me home at all since when Eliza come back,
an’ set herself invisible be me hear-rth.” “Don’t
be a fool,” retorted Quitter. Barney replied with-
out passion: “’Tis no fool finds her sittin’ there
this night, Andrew Quitter. A fool has his eyes
only • I can feel her there wid the chill iv me skin.
I never speak to herself, an’ herself never speaks t
me but I put me hands to her, an’ she’s a cold
place in me home. God keep yeh from havm a
cold place in yer home thim dar-rk nights whin
th’ winds blows th’ complaints iv th’ trees round
the wor-rld.” Barney Dunn’s ease grew worse and
worse. He met his wife’s ghost at every turn. He
found her spectral finger in all his misfortunes. He
lost interest in his work. The grand passion for
accumulating money passed, and left him empty.
Bad luck was accepted as inevitable. And then
herself interfered with his food, imparting nauseous
flavors to it. He could not hide the spuds from
her • no matter what precautions he took she got at
the ’meat, “an’ give it th’ taste iv th’ grave.” Five
months of this reduced Barney to a pale, gaunt,
furtive wretch, with a terrible fever in his eyes.
Then Dunn and Ivers considered the situation serious
enough to call for official intervention. But Barney
saved the authorities trouble. “There’s but one
way t’ fight a ghost,” he told Quitter, an that s
with a ghost. ’Twill be a level fight bechune this
an’ th’ morrow’s morn.” That night Barney Dunn
drowned himself in the Big Hole along Black Fish
Creek. He died intestate. Within a week Eliza,
his lawful widow, was in possession of his land and
chattels. I gather that the report of her death was
a radical error. She is still alive and well. She
was her own ghost.
“C.P.”: Here’s a flash of genius for you.
In the snowy regions between Adaminaby and Itian-
dra, where it is often necessary for travellers to
seek refuge post haste from blizzards, a shelter
shed has been erected by a generous Government.
On it this notice is displayed:—
Persons wishing to use this shed are requested to
call at the Police Stations, Kiandra or Adaminaby,
for the Key.
The handiest police station is five miles away! I
am still living in hope (or otherwise) of seeing a
notice on some big passenger liner: “In case of the
wreck of this vessel, passengers are requested to
make application for a lifeboat to the Senior Mur-
rumbidgee Whaler, Booligal.’’

“Jobber”: Don’t for one moment doubt
that the Boer is an excellent horseman, but isn’t
“Mimosa” (B. 22/5/’l3) making it a bit hot when
he says the S’African, after riding his nag to a
sweat will lead it round until dry even if it takes
an hour? I lobbed home from a hop at 3.30 a.m.
one recent wet morning, per yarraman. Would
“Mimosa’s” Boer have walked round the paddock
till said yarraman was cool, calm and collected?
I don’t think. Anyhow, I didn’t. I gave her a
blithering good feed, and slung a dry bag across
her loins. Reckon she appreciated that more than
all the leading round any Boer might have given
her.

THE THINGS THAT HAUNT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gaunt and crippled, they come and go—
The gibbering shapes that haunt me so;
Old and withered, and grey and slow,
The gibbering shapes that come and go.
Dark and fo°-gv, they rise and sink.
Those muttering things that never think!
They rant, and rave, and spy, and slink—-
Those muttering things that rise and sink.
One is the ghost of Anti-Sosh.
’Tis groaning under a load of Bosh.
Its rolling orbs with tears a-wash —
’Tis the Groaning Ghost of Anti-Sosh.
Here is a baleful host, indeed,
All in a smother of petty greed—
They howl “State Rights”—their victims bleed —
A petty and baleful host, indeed!
There is a Spectre, tall and grim,
With red-tape sticking all over him:
A Gov’ment Shade, cobwebbed and dim—
Yes, that is the Spectre tall and grim.
Here is a Ghost in ghastly plight—
Its innards have dropped all out of sight!
’Tis called “Freetrade”—it shows no fight—-
One almost pities its ghastly plight!
Wan and wearied, they come and go—
The Countless Shades that haunt me so:
They cannot live —thank Goodness, no !
Those wearisome Things that come and go !

HACKING COUGH DRIVEN AWAY.
My daughters, Winnie and Irene, suffered from
colds and croup,” says Mr. Edward Kent, Dundas
(fas.), “and I had many a sleepless night, for they
used to wake up with a choking cough which would
last nearly all night. A friend recommended Cham-
berlain’s Cough Remedy. I tried it and it com-
pletely cured their colds and croup, and drove that
hacking cough away. Under no circumstances would
I be without it in the house now.”*
One of the greatest luxuries of life is a hot bath
supplemented with a couple of tablespoonfuls of
Scrubb s Cloudy Ammonia. It is an antidote recom-
mended to young and old alike, and which leaves one
with a feeling of exhilaration and refreshment, how-
ever tired or exhausted we may have been previously.
With hard water, too, which, used in its natural
state, spells ruination to the complexion, it is most
beneficial, as it promotes the healthy action of the
skin, as well as acting as a most efficacious softener
to the water; and a few drops added, for the purpose
of cleansing the hair, is another important way of
turning it to account. If it is, however, a necessity
as well as a luxury for toilet purposes, it is equally
to be recommended for household use.*

“Pick”: The wombat is the mining
engineer of the wilds, and I would be grateful if
some Abo-observer would discover what kind of
derrick he uses to hoist boulders out of his shaft.
While camped in the Tinderra Mountains (N.S.W.)
one night last summer, a round gibber weighing
about half a ton suddenly tore through the ferns
and plunged into the gully below. Its fresh-earth
appearance convinced me that the rock hadn’t rolled
from above of its own accord, and investigation,
aided by a quarter of a mile’s tracking, proved that
it had been shot out from the mouth of a wombat
burrow 6ft. deep. Certainly the smell of an old
buck wombat is strong enough to shift almost any-
thing, but I leave it to some other liar to say that
that’s how such pebbles are ejected.
“M. 8.8.” : Bryan, for years, had finished
shearing at Moorara, and after every cut-out found
his way to the Dewdrop Inn at Banghoodle on the
banks of the Billdoodle River, where his £4O was
worth about £lO to him and £3O to the devoted
publican. At last, he (Bryan, not the publican—
not on your life) decided to mend his ways ; so, one
day, instead of taking the river road, he fled from
temptation on a round-about track. When the rest
of the usuals arrived at The Dewdrop, the boss’s
anxious inquiries brought forth the news of Bryan’s
backsliding. If it had been left to the flabber-
gasted beer missionary the straying lamb would pro-
bably have got clear, but Mrs. Beer Missionary had
a head on her. In about two jiffs she had saddled
up and was galloping for the junction of the tracks.
Half an hour later, the cheery Ryan saw ahead of
him a saddle-horse grazing on the bank of the Bill-
doodle River, and the still, dust-covered body of a
woman lying ahead of him. With difficulty he re-
stored consciousness and learned how the brute and
fiend and dog of a horse had shied and thrown a de-
fenceless married female. Perhaps she could get
home by herself—she would try, but What could
a man of chivalry do? A week later the boss gave
him a bottle of whisky as a memento of the occasion.
Also, he gave him the ominous tip that there was
nothing more doing at The Dewdrop till next
season. After that, Bryan dropped to the situation
and reformed. Now, when he is going along with
his cheque, the banks of the Billdoodle River might
be lined with stunned females, and he wouldn’t
rescue one of them. He is saving up to buy a pub
of his own.
THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE.
There are many wails from Outback teachers who
are unable to find accommodation within reasonable
distance of the school, but the case of a teacher on
the Queensland border seems specially hard. There
is no habitable mansion on the New South Wales
side, and the nearest residence obtainable is five
miles over the border. There is a big swamp be-
tween, so a bicycle is out of the question. The
teacher cannot ride to school, on account of the tick
regulations. —Daily paper.

“Vicar Apostolique”: Ever notice how
life in the world’s empty spaces tends to kill sec-
tarianism? (I know there are exceptions, but I am
talking of the general rule.) Here in Port Moresby
(Papua) the' followers of the Scarlet Woman lately
held a bazaar for the purpose of raising coin to
build a church. The principal workers were nearly
all Presbyterians, Anglicans and Wesleyans, the
Papist toilers being actually in a minority so far as
the holy effort was concerned. Next year the Angli-
cans intend to build themselves a church. Already
help has been promised them by the same people
who helped with the Catholic edifice. Incidentally
the R.C.’s were the first to offer their assistance.
Is it not enough to make Dill and Brother Robin-
son and Rev. Yarrington (he of the opium find)

“De Yid”: I never understood much of
this new-woman craze for taking on hard work,
under the fancy name of “economic emancipation,’’
till the other day. I was talking then to a bride
of a year’s standing. She was a new arrival, com-
paratively speaking, and you could chip corners off
the Lancashire accent. “But surely with your hus-
band’s good wages out here,” I said, “there is no
need for you to go out to work?” She had just told
me she was “at the tailoring”—her man is a car-
penter. She smiled brightly at my remark. “Ay,”
she said, “that’s what my husband says himself.
But, well, I get good money. An’, though we’ve
never quarrelled yet, mind ye, if we do, it’s always
something to chuck up at him, isn’t it?” Now, is
that the secret of woman’s craze for independence
and emancipation and Heaven-knows-what—the
plain desire to have something to “chuck up” at
the dominant male when the breakage comes ?
“T.0.M.” : Bill was again up before the
local beaks, this time for that he, the said Bill, did
have in his possession or custody a device or instru-
ment known as a swivel gun, exceeding 81b. avoirdu-
pois in weight, contrary to the Act in that case
made and provided. As Bill was somewhat wily,
and had on previous occasions escaped conviction,
the inspector was taking no risks in the present
prosecution. Bill’s gun had been confiscated,
weighed on our grocer’s scales by the Law, and found
to be Bjlb. To put the matter beyond doubt, it was
despatched to the Head of the Department, and in due
course was returned with an impressive-looking certi-
ficate attached, to the effect that, upon being tested
by Standard Weights, the gun or fowling-piece was
found to weigh 81b. 2oz. 3 l-sdr. Armed with the
gun and the aforesaid certificate, the inspector con-
ducted the prosecution with great care, and Bill’s
chance looked blue. During the trial the gun was
examined by the Bench, who overhauled it, tried all
its bearings, and was satisfied that it was in thorough
working order. At the close of the evidence for the
prosecution, Bill was called upon to answer to the
charge. He was handed the gun, and asked if he
admitted ownership. “It’s my gun, all right,” said
Bill, flashing the weapon about and, pointing it at no
one in particular, “but I say she don’t weigh 81b. I
allers use 3oz. charges, and she’s fully loaded now.”
In the scramble for the door the chairman of the
Bench managed to shout out something over his
shoulder to Bill, but there was such a row on that you’d
have thought it was the gun that had been dis-
charged, instead of only Bill.
From C. H. Souter, who writes prescrip-
tions and verse:—
It is not often that I butt into the “Aboriginali-
ties, because I was born in a foreign country, viz.,
Aberdeen (N. 8.), and only came to Australia in 1879,
and thus cannot lay claim to aboriginal descent.
But I want to ask “Catamain” (B. 19/6/’l3) if he is
quite sure that tubercular disease can be conveyed
by means of butter. Milk may be boiled (it hardly
ever is by the average consumer). That will steril-
ise it, to be sure. But I have it on the authority of
T. Bacillus himself that he (T. 8.) is not capable of
leading a domestic existence in pure fat. Butter is
practically pure fat; and though it may go rancid
(in which case only Jackie Bhinghi Bhinghi will eat
it), it cannot ferment. T.B. informs me that he can-
not germinate, nor even subsist, in either pure sugar
or pure fat. Now, Mr. Gatamain?
IN LUCK'S WAY.
NEW PARSON : “ Would you please direct me

COCKATOO JIMMY : “ There’ll be no church to-

‘‘Cooladee” : I was running a survey line,
through thick mallee, up near the Victorian border
south of the Murray, when one of the party asked'
me to go and have a “screw at an anthill as big
as the Titanic,” or words to that effect. It turned
out to be a collection or conglomeration of mallee-
hen’s nests, in the shape of a mound about 10ft.
high from base to crown. We tried the chain
around it, but it was no go, wouldn’t meet by quite
30 links. So the mound must have been at least 40
links, or 28ft. through, and for a radius of about
50yds. the ground was absolutely bare. Every leaf
twig, bush, etc., had been snavelled by the birds.'
I set the festering mass on fire. The smoke from that
nest obliterated the vicinity, and it went on smoulder-
ing for a week.
“Gouger” : Met yet another of N.Q.’s old
hatters a few days ago. For two hours we had been
climbing up a steep ravine, towards the summit of
Mount Fraser, over great rocks, through clumps of
stinging tree and scrub, fallen logs and bad lan-
guage. The ravine ended suddenly in a huge mass
or rock, from beneath which came a stream of water
out of a narrow and forbidding-looking tunnel. We
listened. “Tap! tap! tap!” very faint and far
away. On all fours we entered the tunnel, leaving
the brightness of day for the blackness of everlasting
night. The light of frequent matches made things
not more cheerful, for it merely showed huge boulders,
piled in confusion, many of them hundreds of tons
in weight. In between were dark, open spaces, where
the hatter had been digging away the washdirt. At
length there was a glimmer far ahead, and we could
see a red-whiskered old king peering at us from the
end of a drive. We explained that we were prospect-
ing, and had come up to see how he was getting
along. First, he apologised for his trousers, or what
had long ago been leg casings; now the rags were
buttonless and legless, and there was nothing of them
behind. He was sitting on the shovel, and it must
have been icy cold. A humorous old monarch we
found him, with one eye and a long body. His con-
versation consisted mostly of swear words, and the
solitudes had let him think out some good ones.
In front of him there was a huge granite boulder,
from under which he had already scratched out the
washdirt. He explained that the tin went on behind
the rock, but he was afraid to chase it further, as
the rock looked none too safe. It looked simply mur-
derous. And the big chances are that one of these days
a great, black avalanche will fall, and the hatter
will die as lonely as he has lived, for there is not
another human soul for miles in those ranges. And
when a soul comes he will never think of digging
away a mountain on the off-chance of finding the body
of a perfect stranger named Smith.
on some disputed points of
Northern lerritory history:—
“ No . Im por ta” (B. 10/7/’l3) does not quote
authorities, so I am prepared to challenge his state-
ment that the garrison was removed from Fort Dun-
das (Melville Island) to Escape Cliffs. The settle-
ment at r ort Dundas was made in 1824 and re-
moved in 1828 to Raffles Bay, near Port Essington,
on the mainland. The unhealthiness of the site at
Kiifflcs Bay necessitated a further move in 1830 to
Port Essington. The settlement at Escape Cliffs was
n ?V. m i ade i the ’ 6o ’ s - It; was un der the command
of Colonel Finmss, and was the first attempt of the
bouth Australian Government to settle the Terri-
tory. The visitor to Fort Dundas, which is about
30 miles from the R.C. Mission at the south-east end
oi Apsley Strait, may walk in the trenches, which
are about 6ft. deep by 12ft. wide, and see the well
and the remains of the sentry house, and with the
aid of a little imagination may perhaps make out
a t rac k from the landing to the sentry-house.
there was a book published in London in 1846 or
1848 containing an account of a second attempt of
the British Government to get a move on at Port
Essington. It was written by one Earl, described
as Commissioner for Crown Lands at Port Essing-
ton. I know of two copies of the book in Dar-
win, but the white ants have eaten the vitals out of
one of them. The short title was, I think, “Tropi-
cal Australia.” According to Earl. H.M. ships
Alligator and Britomart, with the transport Orontes,
left Plymouth (Eng.) in February, 1838, and Syd-
ney on September 17, arriving at Port Essington late
m October—not too slow for those days. They sent
the schooner Essington to Kissa (Serwatti Islands),
and in return for goods which cost £3O in Sydney,
iaa v ® sse l returned with 19 buffaloes, 60 pigs, over
100 sheep, several tons of yams, some banana roots,
cocoanuts and seeds and a supply of poultry. Sir
Gordon Bremer, the commandant, returned to Syd-
ney in July, 1839, expecting to find orders awaiting
him to throw open Port Essington for settlement.
Ihe orders failing to arrive, he issued a proclama-
tion which may interest Joseph Cook and comfort
•Josiah Thomas. Earl quotes it as follows:
“Notice is hereby given that persons of respecta-
bility resorting to Port Essington for purposes of
trade, will be permitted to occupy, for a period not
exceeding seven years, town allotments each con-
taimng about half an acre of land, within one mile
of the pier at \ictoria, and suburban allotments of
five acres each within five miles of the same, on the
under-mentioned conditions. Parties desirous of
availing themselves of this permission are requested
to transmit written applications to that effect, ad-
dressed to me at the Harbor Master’s Office, in her
Majesty s dockyard, Sydney, specifying the allot-
ments they wish to obtain, and the time within which
they will be prepared bona fide to enter upon the
land if approved. The conditions are: (1) The
lease to continue for a period not exceeding seven
years, renewable or not at the discretion of the
Commandant or H.M. Government. (2) Payment
of an annual rental at the rate of ss. per £-acre, the
lease to be terminable at any time by the Com-
mandant with 12 months’ notice. (3) All improve-
ments to be effected at the risk and expense of the
lessee. (4) Lessee not to destroy or injure timber,
etc., without previous permission.—J. J Gordon
Bremer, Commandant of H.M. Settlement at Port
Essington. Sydney, Sept., 1839.”
In 1845, the garrison was relieved after seven
years _ service. Earl returned to England via Singa-
pore in 1845. In 1846 the settlement was tempor-
arily increased bv the crew of the Coringa Packet
and part of the Hyderabad’s crew, both vessels hav-
ing been wrecked in Torres Straits.
There is still living in the Territory a veteran
who was under Colonel Finniss at Escape Cliffs in
the ’6o’s. This is Mr. Jack Cleland. the hero of the
wreck of the Gothenburg, who still cheats the cli-
mate of the North by his outdoor life. A tale he
could unfold ! And does it, too, with a quiet drawl,
when the weed is fragrant and the pipe drawing
well.

with respect to the lymph produced from
the calves used by the officials at the

writes: —“Amongst those engaged in
the slaughtering trade there appears to
be a decided disinclination to submit

Harry Morton, N. S. Wales’ new Speaker,
the wit of the Assembly. Ills anecdotes —
grave, gay, religious and otherwise —are
in num ber, and he delivers them
with the art of an actor. He is probably the
only legislator in Australia who could get a
.mb at a first-class music hall as a conjurer.
He is better at this particular game than
many imported professionals; and his one-
man shows on behalf of charities, when he
was in the Berry district, were invariably
patronised to suffocation. Though he can’t
ride himself, he has the keenest eye for a
good horse, and he was the first to discover
the financial points of exploiting a string of
jumpers at the different ATI. and P. Shows.
Desmond, Dante and a dozen other cham-
pions were owned by him till age smote them
in the wind-galls and elsewhere and threat-
ened their usefulness. He is imperturbablv
good humored. One of the few things that
him really exasperated is to be called a
liberal. Past week, for example, the Svd-
nev Telegraph blandly renroached him for
his defection” from Mr. Wade. Consider-
ing that Wade fought him fiercely in his con-
stituency: and considering that Wade’s col-
league. Garland, went to the Hastings and
Maclea.v electorate especially to urge the
Liberals there to turn him down; and con-
sidering, finally, that the Wadeites have be»n
cursing him ever since, Morton regards the
suggestion that he is a sort of renegade
Wadeite as slightly uncalled for. He is a
fluent speaker, and the possessor of a taking
and incisive stvle as a newsnaper controver-
sialist—as C. G. Wade has discovered to his
discomfiture more than once, or even twice.
DREADFUL MISTAKE.

The late W. F. Schey, N.S.W. Director
of Labor, was a descendant of Admiral
Schey, who twice set sail with King Billy
of Orange from Holland in 1688. The first
time the armada of 50 men-o’-war got scat-
tered in mid-channel and had to return to
its base. The second time it got through all
rmht and William presently fought that
scrap on the banks of the Boyne, which was
the ancestor of many even more stupid
scraps. Schey, who had been a good speaker,
would have, drawn like a blister at Glorious
Twelfth shindies; but though his Protest-
antism was considered to be the sort that
would stand the acid, he would never join
in the procession of the Pup.

o,?e c Sie , vle r—a citizen with whom legal trouble, of
one soit and another, is absolutely endemic—went
bail for him on his first charge ; and in my day, in
London, he was the bosom friend of Horatio Bottom-
+f? r ’ T f er ?k Hoole * v man who presented
the golden Hooley communion outfit to St. Paul's - )
and others who have since brought up against the
rocks of adversity. But he did the biggest and most
profitable part of his business with wealthy people
in Society who had messed things up so utterly and
irretrievably as to be past the useful offices of the
famous Lewis firm—an organisation which will go
far to help an affluent client, but which iibs firmly
and painfully at any suggestion that it should com-
mit or condone a criminal act. Arthur Newton was
more of a latitudinarian. He had a perfect retinue
of trained a i&i-suppliers at his command. No
bungling incompetents these, but skilled performers
who were patiently and intelligently rehearsed for their
parts before going into court. As an example of their
usefulness, a cadet of a Continental reigning family
got into a particularly unpleasant variety of trouble
during the last Coronation ceremonies. The hush-
money that was demanded was so vast that he sought
Newton. The blackmailers (an ex-butler
and his wife, the proprietors of a suite of West End
rooms) were defied. They exposed their royal vic-
tim. He appeared in court as “Count X.,” or some
such veiling cognomen, and proved by means of a
cloud of reputable witnesses (reputable, that is to
say, in the sense of being unknown to the police)
that at the time of the alleged offences in London
he was on a houseboat near Marlow. The designing
couple got a term of penal servitude that aston-
ished them. And yet every word they had alleged
was true. A smart young woman grew tired of her
wealthy but dull and elderly husband. Simultane-
ously she became fond of someone else. Newton pro-
cured a temptress that would have given pause to
the militant respectability of Joseph of Canaan, and
sooled her on to the unhappv ancient I in circum-
stances calculated to defeat the intense religious
aspect of St. Anthony. He fell, and was seized en
flagrant delit by about half the staff of a reputable
London hotel. The establishment of the requisite
cruelty charges was a simple matter, and by the time
the next divorce court sittings ended there was one
churchwarden the less in Merrie England. A thou-
sand yarns such as the above have been current in
London for years. Most of them are given as
originating from Newton himself. And. indeed, it
is to be feared that he had not that still and warv
tongue whmh is such a valuable asset in his line of
business. Had he been less communicative, his pre-
sent trouble —a matter of defrauding a German of
several thousand pounds—should never have smitten
him.
A Hebrew, Lieut.-Colonel Monash, of
Melbourne, has just been appointed, with
the approval of Pearce and his successor
Millen, to the important command of the
new Thirteenth Brigade in the Australian
National Army, formed since July 1. It
embraces the 49th. 50th, 51st and 52nd
Regiments, drawn from Armadale, Toorak,
South Yarra, Prahran, St. Hilda, South
Melbourne and Port Melbourne. Monash
is president of the Victorian Institute of
Engineers, and a member of the University
Council; but henceforth soldierly duties will
absorb him, for he commands 130 officers
and 4000 men. It seems that he got right
into the General Staff’s eye lately with a
particularly able paper on the lessons of
Grant’s six days’ battle in the Wilderness as
applied to fighting in the Australian bush.
N.S.W. Speaker Morton puts up
a record or two for his State.
(1) He is the first Speaker who
has got into the chair during his
first term as a, member. (2) He
was nominated by the man who
nominated his two predecessors,
and that event never happened
before. (3) He is the third
Speaker who has held office during
the lifetime of one Parliament, and
that event also never happened
before. Certainly a great deal of
the remarkableness of Morton was
caused by Willis, whose resigna-
tion made room for him. Willis
was also a record in a way, for he
never happened before. That is
to say, he never occurred until he
transpired, but when he happened he was all
there, in a manner of speaking.
Young Horace Crotty, of Melbourne, be-
comes Vicar of St. Thomas’s, North Sydney,
and there is a hubbub over such a junior
getting the gilded billet. Graduating from
Melbourne University and Trinity College
in 1909, they made him headmaster of All
Saints’ School, St. Kilda, while still in his
teens, and soon he bounded to the Vicariate
of St. James’s, Ivanhoe. At once he estab-
lished himself as a remarkably fine preacher
—the best Anglican going in that line since
Nash, has become silent. Principal Leeper,
of Trinity College, claims this scalp, too. He
has turned out five Bishops (Green, of Bal-
larat; Armstrong, of Wangaratta ; Stretch,
of Newcastle; Long, of Bathurst; and Sad-
der, of Nelson, Maoriland). In addition,
there are to his credit Dean Stephen, of Mel-
bourne, and Canon Hughes, of St. Peter’s,
Melbourne ; and this youngster Crotty looks
as though, if he isn’t a meteor, he might be
the brightest star of the lot.
WHEN THE TIME IS OVER-RIPE.

Andrew Tennant, dead in Adelaide at 78,
was a good Scotch-Australian. He was
director of the Adelaide Steamship Co., a
prominent owner of racehorses and occasion-
ally took a turn in the State Parliament;
but squatting was his business and chief in-
terest. Over half a century ago he held
stations about Streaky Bay and other then-
unknown parts of S.A.’s west coast. In
later years he has owned thousands of square
miles of Australia, anywhere from Port
Augusta up to Alice Springs. Yardea, Wil-
lippa, and Moolooloo were some of his sta-
tions. Two sons carry on the big cattle-
raising business still, and his daughters
dutifully married into the Mortlock and
Hawker clans—all but one, who wedded
Anstruther Thomson, A.D.C. to Lord Kin-
tore long ago.
Two veteran South Sea traders, who lately
went to Europe to look for better health,
failed to find it. Paul Ivolbe died on July
I'J. and his wife, Emma E„ followed two
days inter. “Queen Emma” was a daughter
of J. M. Coe, first United States Consul in
Samoa, where she was born. After her first
marriage—to one Forsayth—she started in
trade among the surfy isles, and finally
brought up in New Britain long before any
settled Government arrived there. One of
her earliest adventures was the rescue of the
survivors of the unlucky Marquis du Rav
expedition at New Ireland. She took the
eastawa.ys to her home at Mioko, Duke of
York Group, and made them comfortable
until they.w;ere able to move on to Australia.
She was the founder of the firm of E. E.
I orsa.i th, of Ralum, New Britain, whose
business she sold a few years back to the
b orsayth Gesellsehaft, whereupon she retired
to Mosman (Sydney).
“Waikonini”: Just for
cheer, devilish cantankerous-
ness I challenge any human
being or politician to produce
a Speaker s aide-de-camp
with a longer record than
Leonard Stowe, of Maori
land. For 47 years he has
been clerk of the Legislative
Council, and for quarter of a
century clerk of Parliaments
And the only thing \
know against him is that the
other day he permitted that
little, four-year-old King
George, to daub C.M.G on
his record C.M.G. stands
fo r Chiefly Mediocrity’s
Gaud. Anyhow, that’s what
I ve always understood.
Fitzparrot, M.L.A., characteristically dis-
tinguished himself as soon as the N.S.W
Assembly opened. He planked down 24 ques-
tions on the business oaper, he droned for
fi hours in the no-confidence debate, and he
insulted ex-Speaker Willis. In fact, he gave
the House Fitz.
J. W. Turner, N.S.W.’s Superintendent of
Technical Education, who died last week at
Summer Hill, was born at Parramatta
(N.S.W.), in 1849, and was trained as a
Pupil teacher at St. Peter’s (C.E.) denom-
inational school, Cook’s River. After en-
countering the various slings, arrows, cake*
ale, etc., inseparable from his job, he settled
?2^rP T - ln S y dne y- That was in 1882. I n
1889 under-Secretary Edwin Johnson recom-
mended him as “Head” of Fort-street, and
“ere he struck trouble. The school was
officially a “primary” one. Turner went
out of bounds into the “secondary” business
and the High Schools objected. An inquiry
was called for by the Chief Inspector. The
Senior Inspector was against Turner; so
was a second city inspector. However, the
third inspector—a Glasgow Uni. graduate
came to the rescue and told how his own
chance of getting a University education was
due to the assistance he had got from just
such a school as Fort-street in his native
town. That decided it, and Fort-street con-
tinued on its “High” career. In 1902
Turner and G. H. Knibbs were sent as a
Royal Commission to Europe and America,
to see how the teaching business was done
there and they came home with their trunks
and their heads packed with useful points. In
1905 Turner was made Assistant-Under Sec-
retary, and in 1906 he was given a free hand
with the Technical branch. He had only
just begun a spell of 12 months’ leave, prior
to retiring, when Death put it to him that it
was a fair thing.

. The greatest tribute I can pay to High Commis-

pick. — Vic. Premier Watt, just back from London.
Supremely blessed our country is
With such a representative!
George tends to all Australia’s biz,
And nobly eats that we may live.
He s found his way to English hearts—
He ate his way there—and unnerved
He faces turkey, truffles, tarts,
And serves his land by being served.
He falters not, but scoffs the fare
From oysters unto nuts; and then
He wields his toothpick with an air.
Gargantua has come again!
The brave insignia that he wears
Was given by his king, they say,
I* or valor at the board. He bears
The eat and burden of the day.
So Yes-Gnaw represents all right
The wide, capacious, empty south!
He is the great Australian bite;
His policy’s “from hand to mouth” ;
And crowds are flocking to this strand,
Who realise with cunning wit
There’ll be no famine in the land
While George is safely out of it.

PETER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Queen Alexandra, a London cablegram states, has
received Lady Scott, widow of Capt. Robert Scott,
the Antarctic explorer, and her son, Peter.
The King’s mamma, with gracious thought
Called Widow Scott to meet her:
The lady came along, and brought
Her offspring, Master Peter.
Did Alexandra let her stand,
Or on a sofa seat her?
And did she pkt with royal hand
The honored head of Peter?
Oh, was she robed in royal state,
Or clothed in raiment neater
When she received the Captain’s mate,
And gently smiled on Peter?
How looked the Widow Scott, and how
Did Alexandra treat her?
And did she make a courtly bow
Ere introducing Peter ?
The story as it stands is sweet,
But oh! it would be sweeter,
If one could feelingly repeat
The Queen’s remarks to Peter.
She just “received” the Widow Scott,
No word could be discreeter.
For further facts than we have got
Apply to Master Peter.
He might a wondrous tale unfold,
Of how he dared to greet her ;
He’ll tell it, when he’s bald and old,
To many another Peter.
Most bliss is fleeting. As a boy
I found it even fleeter.
I never knew the lasting joy
That lately came to Peter.
When one has sought renown in vain,
One hates a record-beater.
If I were now a child again
I’d punch the nose of Peter.
VICTORIA.

This bank continues to make slow progress out of
the bog in which the boom landed it 20 years ago.
Or, rather, perhaps it isn’t so much that the pro-
gress is slow as that the bog is immense. To a great
extent it may be the bank’s own fault that it gets
ahead no faster. A bank’s chief asset is credit, and
it is hard for even the most thoroughly reformed
bank m the world to enjoy a full measure of that
asset so long as it flaunts the signs of its old trans-
gressions upon its forehead. There is really no need
for the brand plucked from the burning Drink to
thereafter for ever wear a necklace of empty bottles;
or, when Bill Sikes becomes a reformed character,
it seems bad business for William, when looking for
a job as night watchman, to carry his old jemmy in
his pocket, with the record of his convictions pinned
to the lapel of his coat.
When the bank burst with a loud perfume, an
Assets Trust was created to nurse and finally sell the
lame ducks of the flock; but inasmuch as the bank
guaranteed the due payment, not later than 1916,
of the deposit receipts which the Assets Co. issued
to represent the assets taken over, the two concerns,
it al {. lntents and purposes, are really one. Gradu-
a!.Jy the assets have been realised, and very little
of them remains; and the deficiency to be made
good by the bank, out of its capital or profits, is
now estimated at £834,184. In the table at the
top of these remarks the bank is treated as a
separate concern ; regarding the two as really one,
this is how matters stand:—

Thus in the past four years £224,666 of capital has
b f e 2 I J einstated out of . net Promts, and at that rate
of filling up the hole in the capital, there is enough
cavity still left to occupy the bank for 14 years or
thereabouts. Certainly the management may have
an internal reserve stowed away somewhere: this
seems all the more likely from the fact that the
old assets have, on realisation, been credited with
producing very little more than general-manager
Heron valued them at in 1901. Compare the profit
shown in the two tables, and it will be seen that
during the past four years the profit from the com-
bined business has been £522,746, while the bank’s
own nrofit has been £490,824. During the four
years, profit (of a sort) could come to the Asset*
Trust, in two ways—(l) from the buying up of
deposit receipts at a discount; (2) from the sale
of assets at prices in excess of Mr. Heron’s estimate.
And as that estimate was made in 1901, when pro-
perty values were low, and was, moreover, made by
a man who had nothing to gain and much to lose
by taking a too-sanguine view of things, it seems
highly probable that more than £31,922 has come
into the trust during the four years. If so, the
excess has, of course, been stowed away into some
contingency fund: and, if there is such a fund, it
may knock something off the 14 years which as
remarked above, it will take profits" to reinstate all
the capital, at the recent rate of going.
This paper continues to have doubts whether the
bank s best course is to attempt the complete re-
instatement and leave it at that. Even if share-
holders are continuously starved until 20s. in the
£ has been made good, upwards of 95 p c. of the
capital will still not be entitled to take more than
a 4 p.c. div. ; and a 4 p.c. div. will not in general
allow of the £lO shares being onoted at less than
£2 discount. It is not good for a bank’s credit
that its shares should be quoted at a discount; and
it is particualrly undesirable that 95 p.c. of its
shares should be so quoted. In fact, there is a
good deal to be said against having two classes of
shares in a bank at all. .If an arrangement cannot
be made to reduce the shares to the one denomina-
tion, then an effort should be made to work out some
scheme by which the prefs. should, at the sacrifice
of some capital, be entitled to a dividend that
would permit the shares to reach par; and the
sooner the necklace of emptv bottles, the reminder
of the old drunk, is discarded, the better.
Coming to the changes during the past year we
get these figures:—

The bank has drawn in its advances to the extent
of over half a million ; so that, though deposits, etc.,
have decreased, the holding of liquid assets is larger
than it was 12 months ago. The total debt to the
public is £6,770,313, and over 45 p.c. of it—a very
solid proportion—is held liauid. Compared with the
capital visibly intact, the liabilities are moderate—
iust about £5 for every £1 of the shareholders’
funds. Though several of the figures have shrunk
during the past year, generally speaking the Com-
mercial of Australia has been making very fair pro-
gress. Ten years ago its deposits of all kinds were
£3,417,798 and its advances £3,804,321. To-day
the deposits have reached £6,321,901, and, though
so far as Tjie Bulletin can judge, business has been
pushed very cautiously, advances (including £71,000
of old bank’s assets) amount to £5,260,481. From
every point of view, the Commercial seems, then, to
be a bank with a future as well as a past.

The table starts with the first of the modern 10 p.c.
divs.; previously 9 p.c. had been paid for some
t-me. Now the co. moves on to 13 p.c., and simul-
taneously announces a reduction in the price of gas
from 4s. 7d. to 4s. 4£d. per 1000 ft. The law allows
a 10 p.c. div. with a charge of 7s. per 1000, and
i p.c. more may be paid for every ljd. reduction
below that selling rate. So the co. could now pay
over 16 p.c., and still be within the law. In thus
getting in early with a provision fixing a standard,
the Melbourne co. was wiser than the N.S.W. cos.,
which had no standard until the other day, when a
much less liberal one was fixed—much less liberal,
that is, to the shareholders. Also, the Melbourne co.
was wiser in that it fixed by law the price at which
the whole concern might be taken over by the pub-
lic, and naturally fixed it at a price far higher than
Parliament would stand nowadays. Eighteen times
the average of the previous three years’ profit must
be paid before the co. can be pushed out. That
provision has had one curious effect. In N. S.
Wales and Queensland the usual thing is for the
gas co. to cut down its disclosed profit to the
smallest possible figure: the balance, if there is one,
it pours into new works without saying a word
about the operation. The idea, of course, has been
that the more modest its figure the less liable it is
to attract the Socialistic tiger. In Victoria, on the
other hand, this co., since it would have to be
bought out on the basis of its profits, if bought out
at all, doesn’t whittle away its profits, but sets out
freely the amount spent out of revenue on works.
Last half-year’s expenditure on “extensions and
improvements” was £25,228, which is very little
above the average of the past few terms. Practi-
cally every extension is paid for out of profits. As
at June, 1903, the total expenditure out of capital
\vas £2,155,738. It is now £2,301,217.
That is to say, all the outlay during the
past 10 years except £145,479 has come
out of profits; and what the extensions have amounted
to m 10 years can be judged by the fact that,
whereas m the first half of 1903 the gas sales
brought in £140,407, in the past half-year they
brought m £276,338, in spite of a few cuts in
price. These extensions paid for out of profits are
independent of renewals and replacements. Last
half-year, for instance, £53,111 spent on mainten-
ance and renewal of plant was charged up with
working exes. Approximately £390,000 of profit
has gone into works to earn more profit during the
past 10 years; and if this earns only 6 p.c. it
brings in £23,400 a year, about 3 p.c. p.a. on the
share capital—which means that if the works then in
existence earn to-day only as much as they earned
10 years ago, the new works paid for out of profits
make it as easy to pay a 13 p.c. div. to-day as it
was to pay 10 p.c. in 1903 Altogether the share-
holders should feel very comfortable.
The reserves mentioned in the table are made up
as follows:
Premium on shares .. ..£466 535
Formal reserve fund .. .. 79,575
Meter renewal reserve .. . . 20 515
Unappropriated profit .. .. 42^842
Total £609,468
But obviously, since profit (in addition to what is
required to pay for renewals and replacements) is
l nto works> the latter amount should also be
added to reserves. It is reserve just as much as a
formal reserve fund. Making all reasonable allow-
ances, the true net profit for the past year was
probably about £176,090, which was slightly better
than 20 p.c. on the capital. This looks a good deal
ike tricking the law. As mentioned above, under
the law the co. could now pay 16 p.c. ; to pay 20
?•«• * w S ul t have to bring the price down another
is. oa. bo iar as the public is concerned it is really
immaterial whether the co., having made the profit,
distributes it or not: the pretty obvious intention of
the law was to restrict the making of profit Made
wise by the Melbourne experience, the N.S.W.
Parliament iately in its Gas Act provided that profits
shall not be used except for (1) dividend as pre
scribed by the Act; (2) special purposes fund (total
may be not more than one-tenth of the capital, includ-
ing premiums, and-; The Bulletin doesn’t profess to
understand this —it may be used for replace-
ments but not renewals) ; (3) reserve fund (“applic-
au 6 v. to -u the , payraent of dividend in any year in
which the clear profits are insufficient to enable the
co. in such year to pay the authorised rate, and for
purpose ); and (4) divisible profits account
(profit and loss balance, which “shall not exceed
the amount required to pay one year’s dividend at
the standard rate”). The whole intention is to
fhTvl Pn r B ' stuffing away profits; and although
the Vic. Parliament may not venture to alter the
Melbourne standard or the basis of purchase it
would not be unreasonable to make the intention of
the law plain, and that intention surely was to pre-
vent the co. making a profit greater ' than 10 p c

Twelve months ago the share capital was £849,996 ;
now it is £1,530,000. The Gas Act C 1912) has
done it. It gave the co. six months in which to
capitalise reserves, and on cap.tal subscribed sub-
sequent to June 30 it limits the dividend to 7 p.c.,
while the price of gas remains at 3s. 6d. On capi-
tal subscribed prior to that date 10 p.c. may be
paid ; with this proviso—that if it is certified that
an arbitration award has raised the cost of produc-
tion, the extra cost may be added to the 3s. 6d.
and the standard rate of dividend may still be paid.
According to the co.’s reckoning, the award which
followed the recent strike has added £30,000 a
year to costs, wherefore “the directors intend to
apply to have the standard price increased, in
accordance with the provisions of the Act.” On last
half-year’s figures the co. certainly can t pay the 10
p.c. to which shareholders are entitled; but it has
to be remembered that last half-year was the co.’s
“off” term ; also, it was probably impossible to put
some of the new cap tal to the best use, and no
doubt there was a loss of revenue without a corres-
ponding reduction of exes, during the strike. The
half-year’s figures may, therefore, be ruled out as
exceptional. Unfortunately, while it was on the
job, the N.S.W. Parliament did not require the State’s
gas cos. to publish decently full accounts, such as
the Victorian cos. send out, so the position is still
in a cloud; and N.S.W. gas cos. have got so
thoroughly into the habit of smothering things that
they are not at all likely to give a fair history of
the period under review unless by statutory com-
pulsion.

As mentioned above, this co. paid £15,000 in shares
for the goodwill of the Aus. Metropolitan’s indus-
trial accident business; and what sort of a bargain
it was at that or any price the foregoing table
pretty well indicates. The present deficit consists
of that £15,000 represented, of course, only by
paper; £1597 formation exes, and cost of placing
shares; and P. and L. debit (less provision for un-
expired risks), £4llB. The actual loss for the past
year, exclusive of the amount spent on trying to get
in more capital, was £1742. Certainly the co. has
been increasing its turnover, and new business costs
money to get whether in life or any other insurance:

“The directors regret to have to report that the
balance-sheet shows a deficit on the year’s opera-
tions ; but had it not been for exceptional losses in
the Fire department in the last month of the year,
the result would have been very different.” Per-
haps ; but with an expense rate of 63.6 p.c. the
result couldn’t have been very brilliant if there had
been no losses worth mentioning. The weak feature
isn’t an exceptional loss rate: there are offices that
show worse. It is the exceptional expense rate that
is the trouble; 13s. in every £1 of net premiums
goes in commissions, salaries and exes., and there
is little hope till either this figure is hauled down,
or the business largely increased without a corres-
ponding increase in the cost. The capital is
£24,131. Assets apart from goodwill, stationery,
and a trifle of office furniture amount to £5764.
Liabilities, exclusive of the reserve for unexpired
risks, total £3089. This leaves a tangible surplus
of £2675 to represent £24,131 of capital. It is
not a satisfactory position. The co. should be a
success ; there was room for it. But it needs money ;
and what hope has it got of getting money when
£15.000, or more than three-fifths, of the present
capital was paid in shares to a parent co. for the
goodwill of the nucleus of a business which makes
losses every year? If the parent co. would write
that £15,000 down to as many shillings, the shares
might have some substantial value in the long run.
Unless something of that sort is done, the chances
of the shares ever being worth anything are not
rosy.

But the co. is much too modest to put it that way.
In a Uriah Heep spirit the directors say: “Net profits
for half-year (after providing for all costs and
charges), £10,835.” The Bulletin, however,
figures it like this: —
Added to Steamers’ Insurance Fund .. £2,199
Added to Public Risk Reserve .. 5,000
Added to Reserve Fund .. .. .. 3,371
Alleged net profit . . .. ‘ . . 10,835
Total (profit as per table) . . £21,405
Nevertheless, this paper doesn’t allege that all this
is true profit. An insurance fund, for instance, may
be an accumulation of premiums to cover an unex-
pired risk. It may even be an insufficient accumu-
lation. On the other hand, the steamers may be
fully insured outside, and the fund may be a con-
venient stocking to drop bloated profits into. Then
there is the Public Risk reserve, which has now
reached £15,000. A very wise provision this,
because some day something unpleasant may happen
which may cause claims for compensation to pour
in on the co. In the year of the Richmond smash
the Vic. Railways paid out £137.000 by way of
compensation, apart from the ordinary odds and
ends, and a Manly boat often carries more people
than a Melbourne suburban train Some of the
£21,405 of profit should, no doubt, therefore, be
earmarked for insurance premiums. Then there is
the matter of depreciation ; and what is written off
on that account nobody knows who doesn’t know a
lot more than the published accounts tell him. The
co. has now seven steamers and two cargo-carriers in
commission, and on an eighth passenger boat £15,961
had been paid on June 30. The comnleted vessels
stand in the books at £119,717. Throwing the
cargo carriers in, this averages £17,100 each, or an
average of about £7OOO less than cost—the latter
amount having been written off out of undisclosed
profits. But though £119,717 spent on completed
steamers remains charged to capital account, practi-
cally the whole lot has been paid for out of profits.
Seven years ago the capital was £25.000, and it is
now £158.409. No money has, however, been paid
in bv shareholders during that period, the extra
£133,409 having been made up as follows: Conver-
sion of debentures, £4335; bonuses paid out of
profits, £129,074. Also, no money having been
paid in by shareholders during the seven years, it
follows that, as the co. has no debts beyond £1724,
all the new steamers, property, etc., as well as up-
wards of £36,500 in cash, have been provided
out of profits in excess of dividends. The co. during
tins seven-year period has been engaged in an active
ship-building campaign; but it is judged that
enough boats have been provided to meet require-
ments for some years ahead. Presumably, the
shareholders will now, therefore, get the bulk of
the money which has hitherto been spent on the
fleet. That means increased dividends; and in order
that they may not appear too bloated, it is under-
stood that a further big bonus distribution of shares
has been resolved upon. The present authorised capi-
tal is 250,000 shares of £1 each ( £250,000), of
which 211,212 have been issued paid to 15s.
( £158,409). The scheme is to increase the autho-
rised capital to £500,000 in £1 shares, giving the
directors power to issue new shares at par or a
premium as they please and when they please; and
power is being taken to pay a bonus out of profits
whether such profits have been set aside as a reserve
fund or not. This business will come before the
shareholders on August 11.

S. Australia was founded by people who believed
that business and * philanthropy would mix and give
good dividends; and there has been more or
less of the old leaven working ever since. This
was one of the concerns in which it was tried.
The intention was splendid. The society was going
to buy land wholesale, sell it retail, and help
deserving people to build happy homes on the retail
blocks. The beautiful dream went to pieces when,
a few years later, the societv woke up to find that
it had done its buying at the top of the boom of
the ’Bo’s, and had a whole lot of its capital
locked up in fragments of this high-priced land,
which nobody wanted to buy at any figure. The
subsequent 20 years have been spent in sackcloth
and ashes. It seemed at one time as though the
wretched thing would never be wound up, and that
the sackcloth and ashes would have to become
chronic; but fortunately somebody re-discovered
that manure was good for wheat crops, and the
super-phosphate business was started, and the S.
Australian wheat harvests, which had been creeping
down to five bushels per acre, bucked up to 10
bushels, and have averaged nearly that —over 94
bushels —for 10 years past. So the State began to
feel very much better, and Adelaide presently started
to jump ahead again In 1907, this society reckoned
the assets on hand might be worth 17s. in the £
of the unreturned capital, and it offered shareholders
10s. cash to call the thing square. An unfortunate
few accented, and to-day they may be made miserable
by reading that already 15s. in the £ has been
paid back to shareholders, and that, on present
appearances, there will be at least 225. 6d. in all for
them. Of course they are getting no interest. The
expenses, for one thing, are too heavy. The entire
revenue last year was only £495 (apart, of course,
from proceeds of sales), and “current expenses’’ ab-
sorbed £4Bl, without counting in commissions on
sales. It's. a case in which some arrangement should
be made with a live office. The remnant is much too
small to maintain an organisation of its own. And if
there is no private office that will take the sediment
over, the Public Trustee’s office might well be author-
ised to do it.

The capital for the business is provided by share-
holders and depositors. The former may withdraw
their money even before the maturity of the shares,
on certain conditions ; and the latter are secured by
short-term debentures. Owing to the tightness of
money it became necessary last year to put up the
rate offered on these debentures from 34 p.c. to 44
P.c., and simultaneously the lending rate was advanced
to 6 p.c. As it does not appear that any of the cap-
ital is absolutely fixed in the business, a substantial
reserve fund is necessary. But, under the rules of the
society, profit may not be accumulated in excess of
1 p.c. of the aggregate amount lent on mortgage, the
idea being that, as the shares are of the termin-
ating variety, the society’s current profits should
be paid out or credited to shares as the concern goes
along. No doubt this is an attempt to do the strictly
fair thing by shareholders, but it is doubtful whether
it is doing the strictly fair thing by the societv. It
may sound well enough to say that shareholders
should have the profit made by the society during
the time it is using their money. But supposing the
society lends to-day and makes a bad bargain, and
the society pays out to a shareholder to-morrow, should
not the shareholder leave a bit behind him to cover
that loss—a loss which probably won’t manifest it-
self until next year? The nresent system is all
right, of course, so long as the society hasn’t any
depreciated securities thrown on its hands. When
that happens—and it is liable to happen to any con-
cern that hasn’t got Omniscience at the head of
things—there is bound to be trouble. So far, cer-
tainly, everything in the garden is lovely, and there
isn’t a single foreclosed property in possession. This
shows the position in that and some other respects:

The record is very creditable: it looks as though the
utmost care was exercised in making advances. But
that doesn’t alter the fact that the reserves ought
to be much larger in proportion to the money at
risk, and especially in view of the fact that the
capital is withdrawable.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would" be "pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

In all smithing work high-class iron can be more
salfelv manipulated at varying temperatures than
steel or ordinary iron. It is for this reason that
Best Yorkshire Farnley Iron is preferred by engi-
neers, where toughness, great strength and close

of the Farnley type does not vary, but is simply the
best that can be produced from what is really
wrought iron. “Farnley” Bars of all sections sup-

At the Wild Cherry, Ardlethan (N.S.W.),
very little high-class oie has been seen since the
dotation of the co., and the rock now being mined
from Hough’s once-rich lode looks little better than
that from Smith’s lode. For the purpose of reports
this material is classified under such headings as
“milling ore,” “good milling ore,” “low-grade ore”
and “high-grade ore.” In the absence of any men-
tion of barren rock, one is forced to accept most of
these terms as being polite descriptions of plain,
ordinary mullock. It might further be said that the
appearance of the stuff itself supports the idea. Fol-
lowing the general practice at Ardlethan, a policy
,t secrecy is adopted, and visitors are regarded with
suspicion. All this may be changed when mining
becomes of more importance than the market. At
present it isn't so.
White Crystal, Ardlethan, is merely sinking a
vertical shaft in country—now down 7 sft. After
providing the entrance with a gate, lock and key, the
tunnel through Crosby’s Hill is being given a spell.
Should shareholders be discovered for the Stackpool’s
“pup,” a search will no doubt be made for germs
of ore. It is now certain that Crosby’s Hill does
not contain the supposed large quantities of low-
grade stuff, and the Crystal resolves itself into a
proposition geologically similar to The Homeward
Bound. It contains a few small and little developed
shoots of high-grade ore.
Homeward Bound has now discarded all Ardlethan
options except over the two small blocks from which
the title is derived. A Huntingdon mill, of 25 tons’
capacity per day, and erected as a memorial to the
late N.S.W. Mines and Smelter Co., at Breadalbane,
is now in operation. This small mill is large enough
for half a dozen shows the size of the co.’s mine.
Although public crushings are being catered for, the
mill is not being unduly rushed by those yelling
for State batteries.
Southern Cross, having £4OOO in hand, and tiring
of the repeated discovery of lodes, is spending por-
tion on the purchase and erection of an ancient col-
lection of scrap. Even this may require some ore,
the source of which is yet a mystery.
Ardlethan Options, Ltd., is actively engaged trying to
get better terms. No doubt some will be turned down,
but the purchase of Coote’s Lone Hand will prob-
ably be completed at £7OOO. An extension of time
has been obtained over Dumbrell’s Bygoo, but funds
are not sufficient to purchase this, in addition to
Coote’s, if either is to have decent working capital;
and conditions for raising more capital are unfavor-
able.
Carpathia North is the title of the newest pro-
posed Ardlethan flotation. Capital is £31,250,
divided into 125,000 shares at ss. The public is
asked to put up £15,000 for 100,000 shares, with a
further liability of 2s. per share. Proceeds will be
divided as follows: £BOOO cash to White Crystal
Co.; £2OOO cash, with the rest of the shares
(25,000), to promoters and underwriters. Brokerage
and other expenses incurred in “working the oracle”
will come out of the balance of £ 5000 The lease
is known as Stackpool’s, forms portion of the White
Crystal area, and was prospected and found wanting
by this eo. before funds ran out. The co. now pro-
poses to avoid the poor-house by selTng this portion
of its property. The persistent W. J. Young, “Certified
Geologist,” testifies at length regarding the extreme
poverty of the ground, and bears witness that “nothing
of a very pronounced character has yet been found.”
He mentions also a 4ft. lode, but carefully avoids saying
that there is any tin in it. As a “position” block
next the Carpathia, the show warrants the expendi-
ture of a few pounds on prospecting, but offers no
excuse for being capitalised as a valuable mining
property.
At the bottom of the Carpathia main shaft the
ore body has taken a flatter western underlay. From
the back of the shaft to the face of the crosscut
measures approximately 35ft. The first 6ft. is mul-
lock; the next 22ft. lode material, apparently well
over the payable limit; the remaining 7ft. is low-
grade stuff. No official hint is given of average
values, the information being dished up in a form
long since abandoned on fields which carry on mining
as a business. As a titbit an abnormal assay is,
however, occasionally thrown into a report. Little
more gouging can be done from the open cut, the
bottom of which shows an increased proportion of
mullock. In the open-cut shaft good ore is being
mined, although the vein is dipping in an unexpected
manner. Development to date promises well; yet
only a small tonnage can be relied upon until further
crosscutting and driving has been carried out. A
month’s time will witness a weird attempt at solving
the metallurgical side of the business at Barmedman.
* * * *
Grafton Copper Mine (N.S.W.) is being
equipped with a rock-drilling outfit; but unless the
mine can be made to buck up, the hat will have to
be passed around to keep the plant running. In
spite of reported developments, both tonnage and
grade of ore have slumped badly. The most insig-
nificant patches of ore are being worked overtime,
which means that reserves have disappeared. Last
vear the monthly average was over 100 tons matte ;
last month only produced 60 tons. The decline ,- s
further aggravated bv the product now bringing onlv
£33 per ton, or £lO per ton less than last vear’s
price. And the lower grade ore is not reducing
smelting costs.
* * * *
Pulganbar quicksilver mines (N.S.W.).
having spent a pile of money, mostly on useless plant
construction, are now looking around for more. Not
showing up elsewhere, it is rumored the elus’ve
mercury has escaped up the flue. No real attempt
has been made to open out a body of ore, and there
is an active suspicion that little of value exists.
Many years ago a strong and knowing crowd, after
making a little of the metal, arrived at this con-
clusion and turned the shows firmly down. The
recent extravagance on the same properties is
strongly reminiscent of the Tolwong fiasco.^
Tin prospects in North Queensland are dis-
tinctly brighter than they were a while ago. film final
collapse of the old Stannarv Hills Co. and the deple-
tion of reserves in the Vulcan made things look
very sick for a time. Stannarv HTls, after the final
collapse, passed into the hands of John Darling, of
Adelaide; and. freed from the awful weight of debt
which the over-capitalised concern carried, the pro-
position now has a hope. In fact, there was enough
hope in it the other day to induce the owner to put
on another 15 or 20 men. Three of the mines—the
Central, the Extended and the Dead Fm-sh—are
being worked, and, with the help of tributors,
head of stamps are kept going. What Tlro /'t, is
is going back into the At present however,
it can’t be much, for 2 p.c. stuff would be about the
average broken, except by a few tributors.
t .„T. h a e ulcan > deepest lode-tin mine in Aus-
-1 paid , a dividend f or years, and had

a ? lg b ° dy ’ there is a goad lump of ground to take
, and Prospects are at least hopeful. Anyway,
there s life ahead for a few years, even if nobody can
t swear to dividends. Costs have always been
excessive at this mine, partly because, in spite of
i s big output, it never had a mill of its own, blit
crushed always at John Moffat’s Irvinebank battery,
isow an aerial tram is to go in to connect mine and
! ni ’ and costs of transport will come down from 2s.
to 6d. or 7d. per ton. The Governor Norman has
an aerial for the same purpose. Carting in that
case used to cost about ss. ; with a rope-way that
ran the co. into an outlay of £3500, the work is
now done for about Bd. The Vulcan’s aerial will
cost £l5OO, and will have a daily capacity of 120
tons.
Lass o’ Gowrie, which owns one of the very few
true fissure lodes in North Queensland, has cheerful
prospects in a tunnel driven to cut the shoot below
the old workings. From the shaft put down on that
shoot over £lOO,OOO worth of tin was taken out; but
when water got heavy, trouble was caused by the
crookedness of the shaft, which had followed the
shoot. The tunnel has not yet got under the old
workings, but another shoot has been found. For
the most part it consists of dense arsenical pyrites,
with as much as 18in of rich clean tin-stone in
places—so rich that 100 tons sent to the mill gave
50 tons of oxide. A winze has followed down this stone
for 35ft., and overhead 8 p.c. ore is being stoped.
Sooner or later, if the syndicate which owns this pro-
perty has any luck, it will go right through the hill,
and very possibly pick up other workable shoots on
the course of the lode. There certainly are other
shoots, but their value is, of course, uncertain.
How many dividend cheques has J. S.
Reid ever signed? He is the boss unlucky man of
the old Queen-street crowd. Chillagoe has bred
nothing but reconstructions and Emu Bay nothing
but disappointment. Now along comes the Ether-
idge Gold Mines, Ltd., for reconstruction within
about two years of its birth. This latest has been
a simply shocking fiasco. All the capital has gone,
and the co. is some thousands in debt, and all there
is to show is a little machinery, chiefly of doubtful
value, and experience which may, or may not, be
worth something. No development has been done,
says the new manager; yet nearly £13,000 has gone
that way, according to the balance-sheet. The new
manager says that just about everything has been
done wrong, and the directors let the old manager
take all the blame. The woman temoted me and I
did eat; the manager fed us and we swallowed. In such
a case the term “directors” is plainly a misnomer.
Why not “reflectors”?' Or perhaps “collectors”?
Anyway, the old co—-two-year-old co.—is to dis-
appear, and another of the same name is to be regis-
tered.

Mount Elliott (Q.) will shortly blow in
its copper furnace. This new campaign will be in-
teresting, for larger quantities of ore will be
received from Hampden Consols and the Selwyn. The
last named will supply some rich stuff per traction
engine. But if Elliott is to continue to smelt ore
equal to the 121,299 tons already treated, important
discoveries will have to be made in the parent mine
or in the Hampden Consols, which is the only other
sizeable property connected with the smelter by rail.
At the Mungana meeting chairman
Harvey Patterson had nothing cheerful to say. Total
reserves are reckoned at 102,965 tons, 48,000 of
which are locked up in the Lady Jane, from which
the men have been driven by a fire that has been
burning for four years. The ore in the Jane is
high-grade, but even if the fire is subdued it will
be costly to put the workings in order after the
present flooding. As to the Girofla, the 12,736 tons
raised in 12 months to March 31 averaged 7oz.
silver, 13,25 p.c. lead, 0.95 p.c. copper—poor stuff
to stand a working cost of 235. Bd. per ton. Mun-
gana is anxious to increase its tonnage, but little
can be done until the Lady Jane fire is out, and
then there will be a long delay while workings are
cleaned and repaired. It is a gloomy prospect.
Oaks Amalgamated (Q.) has come to
grief. The last call was poorly answered, and,
there being no prospect of meeting the next lot of
debenture interest, the directors decided to shut
down. Laby, the manager, throws the blame on the
ancient, rattletrap plant wh'ch, for the sake of
economy, the directors bought and re-erected. Give
him a Huntingdon mill, he says, and with that and
a few labor-saving accessories he can belt profit out
of the 7dwt. ore, of which he reckons he has two
years’ reserves. With the defective plant the mine
has been so near paying that it is hardly likely it
and the suction-gas plant and other good equipment
will be abandoned. Certainly out where it is the
plant would fetch practically nothing, if it were
broken up. The proposal that appeals to the direc-
tors is to form a new co. m 25.000 shares of £1
each giving the present debenture holders £2500

other two shifts. The reform, which was introduced
some years ago at Broken Hill, is one of the pro-
visions of the Mining Bill to be presently intro-
duced by Mines Minister Collier. It would have been
loudly condemned by some mine owners’ represen-
tatives, but now that Hamilton has of his free will
adopted it, the opposition will probably vanish.

Tindal’s, of Westralia, has been furnished
with a new prop in the person of an ancient warrior,
Andrew Stenhouse, an old Barrierite, who seems to
have as his guide, philosopher and friend, Arthur
Robinson, M.L.C. W. J. Faul, after “doing’’ Cobar,
lit out to the mine, and his report is comfortable
reading. He got lOdwt. samples in the No. 3 level
north, and fair prospects in other faces. So he
proposes that the old dawdle policy shall be aban-
doned, and calls made, to give the claim another
chance,. Tom Husband, secretary of the Briseis, is
to handle the finances, and W. Humphreys is to
work the mine, directed by the said Faul. This
means strict discipline and a close eye on the spend-
ing—qualities desirable with such a waster as
Tindal’s. Stenhouse, with his usual pluck, and in the
face of his overwhelming holding, leads the way in
plumping for 6d. calls.
Greenfinch (W.A.) has sunk on a new
vein which, at 55ft. on the underlay, averages about
loz. for a width of 15in. Sinking is being con-
tinued to water level, where driving will be started.
Small values permeate the rock on either side of the
vein, and the co. is hoping that further exploration
will show the ore to be payable over a greater width
than is now taken into account. From shaft-sinking
64 tons yielded 550 z. over the plates, with Bdwt. in
the residues. Another crushing is going through.
Last month the co. made a profit of £5OO from
all sources.

Edna May CW.A.) has had a clean-up—
the first —from its recently-erected mill, and may
now be said to be treading the slippery path of
regular production. Its first effort realised £2870
from 680 tons crushed. Some time ago the ore in
sight was estimated by the manager at 20,000 tons,
averaging 855., and by A. E. Morgans at 12,000
assaying 87s. 6d. The reef, according to Morgans,
averages 14ft., and at the 75ft. level it is reputed to
be 240 ft. long. There is no outcrop, and an over-
burden some feet in thickness renders an accurate
estimate of reserves difficult. So far as one can
judge at present, the ore channel lies between two
granite dykes, and is therefore in danger of being
cut off at any time.
The report of Associated (W.A.) for the
financial year ended March 31 has been issued in
London, along with the declaration of a shilling div.
About a couple of months ago the co. acquired an
interest in a Cobalt (Canadian) silver show, but it
is now rumored that it proposes to distribute the
bulk of its accumulated cash in the form of a b°mis-

recent demand for shares.

Bendigo is having a new experience in
that the Princess Dagmar, on the Pyke line, hits
it rich on a syncline. Nearly all the wealth of the
field has been drawn from the anticlines and the
spurry country adjoining the legs. Consequently the
real Bendigo man never butted on to synclinal en-
richments. This may account for the passing round
of the word quite early in the present Dagmar spurt
that “quick profits” spelled safe tactics. Golden
Age is on the same run of quartz, and Johnsons
Reef isn’t too proud to want to share in the good
things, so is crosscutting for the same formation.
The position of Golden Age, between the Dagmar
and Golden Pyke, makes it a pretty claim from a
mapping standpoint. So far, however the stone
operated on by it hasn’t approached the richness
of that broken by either of its neighbors Yet

came from this level, so that only a beggarly aver-

worth £4 per oz., but St. Arnaud gold realises 10s.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, July 28, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
Parliament in all its musty majesty was
opened by Governor Strickland in the early
part of last week. Mixed music and a sug-
gestion of ragtime assisted in the sunlit
street. Inside, as many swords, cocked
hats and big-wigs as the stuffy Legislative
Council chamber could squeeze together
(with the help of a prod or two from the
Usher of the Black Rod) assembled to
yawn over the official speech, which con-
tained about one mile of political embroi-
dery. Speaker Willis postponed his
public exit from the Chair till the Cocked
Hats had tumbled into their private band-
boxes, and the Lord High Whiskers in Wait-
ing had toddled home to afternoon tea. Then
he cast his job to the four winds that blow
n the halls of Heaven, and became once
more a private politician. And the first
time he realised the full measure of his
voluntary downfall was when an oft-ejected
and rather peevish member met him in a
corridor, and frankly spoke two columns of
small print at him.
The Admiralty lady sailed away in the
.Nestor with her two young daughters, after
a cyclone of farewells. Dr. Marian
Ihornett _ gave the semi-final event in her
flat. This was a small tea-party respect-
fully waited on by an automatic lift which
happened to be quite tame that afternoon.
80 no one present shot up prematurely to
Heaven. Lady King-Hall hurried on to
Cranbrook after this adieu, to leave her
farewell card on Lady Edeline. Venice,
where our ex-Admiralty dame passed some
years of her girlhood, is going to be re-
visited, probably when her eldest treasure
is settled at boarding-school in Brussels.
Ihe JNew Art will be rigorously cross-
examined in the City of the Gondola, by
our recently Departed, who is a keen critic
of brush work. So the “Study of an In-
fant that looks like a lobster in its death-
struggle, or the “Portrait of a Lady ” that
is mistaken for the sketch of a steeple
struck by lightning, may expect to be sev-
erely censured. His Epaulets lingers on in
this port till October, when he hands over
to Australia’s Admiral Patey.
Mrs. Mayoress Cocks farewelled the Ad-
miralty lady in the municipal bower. The
iarewelled was sheathed in rose and violet
and chaperoned by Flag-Lieutenant Seton
in all the pomp of male millinery of the
morning call persuasion. It was a small
party, and Lady King-Hall got round
amongst those present and shook them gently
by the thing you collect your salary with.
Ihis is a more merciful scheme than stand-
ing the star guest on a patch of carpet near
a draughty doorway, and daring her to move
till several hundred persons have bounced
past, violently wringing her fingers or any
other part of her person they can snatch at
in their flight. Mrs. Anderson Stuart, Miss
-ttose Scott, and Mrs. George Rich hurried
away early to see Baby Gordon’s christening
mug. Mrs. Mayoress Walker (North Syd-
ney) Mrs ex-Mayoress Waugh (Parra-
matta), and a few other mayoresses—past,
present, future, ex-, and to come, attended
in great majesty. The coat tails of that
hardy annual, W. G. Layton, whisked round
the Nicest and Nastiest persons present,
with strict attention to business. P.S Babv
Gordon, by the way, is the small bundle of
lace and muslin whose mamma used to be
Miss Gladys Bowker.
Mrs. Bernhard Wise has just returned to
tins town after a sojourn in the Thames-
side city, where the immortal Todgers used
to reside and where the free breakfast-table
is burying a large percentage of the juvenile
population.
Sydney’s Mrs. Mayoress Cocks has been
doing a stiff course of sentry-go in her offi-
cial lair at the Town Hall. On Friday
afternoon the Chosen People and the 11l-
Chosen People and the Badlv-Chosen
ieople and other people climbed up the
marble stairs to clasp her hand for the
second time in one week. Nordica, clothed
in cream and black tulle, was the Event
Ihe cream was of the subtle shade of an
oyster—the part that isn’t beard. It was
made of some fine, silky extravagance that
gathered itself together in drapery nearly
everywhere. Lucille (Paris), who designed
this garment, calls it “Merry Widow.”
partly, I suppose, because the small, black
hat exactly like a man’s bowler millinery
flings black tulle weepers over the dress.
It sounds dull, but it looked new and excit-
mg Nordica is a gracious, unspoilt woman,
with a temperament that must be made of
honey and bottled sunshine. In the day-
time she is a handsome and well-preserved
4 u summers - B ut the plat-
torm footlights flung spiteful shadows at
her first concert, and distorted her nice ap-
Her relative, Mrs. Baldwin (or
perhaps it’s “Wyn” for a dressy climax),
was also hatted out of the ordinary, in
headgear that looked like the Paris edition
ot a Quaker's best broad brim, with the
balcony of the hat furiously rolled up at
the sides. Manager Shipman and his aub-
urn-haired Intelligence Department hov-
ered round the outer orbit of their constel-
lation. The legal Heydons. who have a
quenchless thirst for music; Judge Back-
house, another tireless enthusiast; Mrs.
Miller Ward, sparkling with the joy
ot one U.S. singer when she rubs feathers
with another Starred and Striped voice of
great magnitude; and a large number of
exactly . the same people who attend the
same kind of functions every day in the
week—they were all there.
Staying here for a week or two, is Miss
Alice Currie, chiefly of Melbourne. Some
years ago her father, the late George Currie,
and a partner, owned Puckawidgee station,’
near Deniliquin (N.S.W.L The world went
very well then, as it did with the giants be-
fore the Flood, but the youthful Alice saw a
small ny in the mutton fat. When the fierce
heat of summer blazed on the homestead
shingle, the juvenile Curries were packed off
to the seaside. Otherwise they grew up
amongst women and children less lucky
than themselves,. who never saw the splash
of a long white ripple on creamy sands. The
world doesn’t go quite as well now with the
Currie family. But Alice the Enthusiast is
devoting most of her time and all her spare
cash to propel the notion, “Seaside Camps
for the Women and Children of the Bush,”
before the public eye. Mayor Cocks presides
at a public meeting in the Town Hall in
favor of this scheme, before this meets your
eye.
Miss. Joan Deck, who is going to marry
I lag-Lieutenant George Seton, is rather a
tail, attractive young witch with a slim
waist and a pair of eyes like grey velvet
pansies. Sailor George comes from chilly
Aberdeenshire, where the family roots wan-
der down under miles of grey granite.
t unreliable rumor says that the late
J. C. YVllliamson’s palatial motor-car (or
one of them) has been bought by Lawyer
Arthur Allen.
The naval Barlows steamed out of this
port in the vast Nestor. The good-bye
party was. limited to those who could wave
a clean bill of health at the foot of the
gangway. Three angry lumps on the left
arm were also taken as marks of good
faith.
Frederic Manning, who is writing queer,
clever stuff on the other side, is a son of
William Patrick Manning, of this clachan.
The younger Manning’s “Scenes and Por-
traits’ (published by John Murray in
1909) still holds its own amongst the
troubled literature that tries to sort out
religious beliefs, and prospects the vague
realm we call (or used to call) the Better
World. He says: “There are only two re-
ligions on this little planet the religion
of the humble folk whose life is a daily
communion with natural forces and a bend-
ing to them; and the religion of men like
Protagoras, Lucretius and Montaigne, a re-
ligion.of doubt, of tolerance, of agnbsticism.”
Manning admits the influence of contempo-
rary French thought, and quotes his in-
debtedness to l’Abbe Houtin and Arthur
Galton —the . latter “for his example and
conversation.” Out of the depths he plucks
a new portrait of Adam and Eve. There is
nothing in this chronicle to tell us how Eve
ran up the seams in her fig-leaf skirt or
whether Adam’s dairy herd introduced cow-
pox into Eden. Manning merely remarks,
“Then the woman filled a bowl with milk,
and a great bronze serpent came out from
the roots of the tree and drank the milk,”
etc. I suppose Mother Eve had to wipe
the bowl with her hair to take the nasty
taste out of it after this homage to the
Snake. Kitchen towels are a help, after
all.
A Sydney enthusiast now slithering over
the frosty pate of Kosciusko sends an in-
formative line. She says: “New champions
are taking chamois leaps to front places.
In carnival week Miss M. Eadie (Bendigo)
ski-ed across the Kerry course in record
time. Darling Downs (Q.) sent another
accomplished ski-runner in Miss Daisy
Clifton,, who got away with the open event
for ladies. G.-G. Denman is very fast on
his feet when he straps them into snow-
shoes. His Ex.’s people bustled off in the
morning with luncheon baskets. They spent
their days plunging through the snowy
landscape with only a Monaro man in the
offing to see that vice-royalty did not fall
into a bottomless pit in the scenery. Tour-
ist-officer Jack Cormack hovers round every
item. Mrs. Denison Miller, Miss Triggs
and her mamma (from the Yass sheep
folds), Miss Dorothy Carr, Mrs. F. E.
Bishop, and Miss Cowley are neck and neck
with the tall Barttelot lady, as the best-
dressed skiers on this wintry hillock. Mrs.
Ralston, a S’African visitor, has also
startled the natives with the elegance of her
putties.”
The Journalists’ Institute of N.S.W. at-
tends to the pate-de-foie-gras department of
the fourth estate. It feeds those who are not
hungry, and champagnes those who are not
thirsty,' and hands butter on a lordly dish to
those who are already buttered. Last week
it impounded Lewis Waller and Madge
Titheradge, and did them very well at a
lunch in an interior apartment of Farmer’s
cafe. The Lion roared as gently as a willy
wagtail. He returned thanks for these and
all these other oysters, etc., with the mild
manner of a young curate blushing over his
first christening. The youthful Lioness flung
a rollicking anecdote at the party, and
started joyously to her feet to say she had
‘‘another.” Her voice is, as I told you be-
fore, a delicious organ full of cream and
velvet edged with kitten’s fur. She was
gowned in a one-piece frock of navy blue,
with a small toque cap of the same species
squashed down on her head. The whole of
this gear was very carefully trimmed with
narrow strips of leooard’s skin —no wider
than the tail of the beast.
George Tith., with a dreamy smile,
wandered off to daffodils, and said he
hoped to some day gather together
any critics who had ever made rude
remarks about his acting. He would
then read aloud to them an article, very
learned and dull—he had once written on
horticulture, and the door would be locked
to prevent the critics escaping. Editor
Hmey (S. M. Herald) looked over the rim
of his glasses and assured the visitors they
were very welcome here. The benign pre-
sence of. J. C. Watson, who remains calm
though his staff has been vaccinated in the
third degree, was at the top star table.
Hugh Ward came late and missed his soup,
which was set amongst the more or less
heavenly bodies. So he drifted into mun-
dane latitudes below the extra special salt.
Journalist Horace Rogers, the most ex-
perienced law reporter on the city press,
sat amongst the mighty. He is a
son of the late actor, G. H. Rogers, a one-
time well-known mummer in George Cop-
pin’s team.
Journalist C. E. W. Bean, who is re-
sponsible for “On the Wool Track,” has
another Australian book now tearing
through the machine-room of a London
publishing house. It is called “Flagships
Three,” and is mainly written to prove that
there are about 1000 reasons why the Aus-
tralian should be a blue-water sailor and
marine kangaroo of the first magnitude.
Bean has just returned to his native
N.S.W. after nearly three years’ absence.
Part of his time was spent in press work
in the Fog, and some of it in wandering
round the skeletons of long dead foreign
ships. Near Christiana he stumbled on a
wonderful preservation rescued in the ’7o’s
bv an Antiquarian Society. These learned
persons put on their specs, scraped the
potter’s clay off the ribs of their find, and
dug out the body of a'n old Norse galley.
For centuries it had been tucked away be-
neath the sands near the farmhouses of
Gokstad. The legend that an early viking
had been buried under it proved true in so
far as the finding of a heap of bones (now
labelled “viking”) was unearthed, with the
remnant of such treasure as an early
Christian robber hadn’t thought worth re-
moving. The date when this preservation
was wallowing in the North Sea is stated
to be approximate to the time when Eng-
land’s Alfred was losing half his kingdom
to the Danes, and working up a brilliant
reputation in the pages of the Anglo-Saxon
account of his own greatness. Alfred
Chronicle by writing, or dictating, the
squared the only editor of his day, and
profited thereby.
Tenor Paul Dufault, who safely weath-
ered the stormy Cisneros concert season of
1912 with a thousand yards or so of eulogy
from the Australasian press, is mighty glad
to find himself again in this port. When
he hopped ashore in N’York on last Novem-
ber 1, engagements tumbled in for the whole
winter season. Dufault searched his inner
consciousness for a novelty to meet the de-
mand. So he engaged a soprano who sang
in tune, a fiddler and a pianist. At each
this quartet gave a first part of
16th, 17th or 18th century music. They dis-
guised themselves in the clothes of the period
in which they sang, fiddled or smote the
harpsichord. Until the performers de-
scended into the 20th century, the piano kept
out of draughts behind the stage (which was
fitted up as a salon) and wore its legs in red
flannel, the air being below zero, and the
instrument being rheumatic. Mixed cen-
turies are like mixed drinks, uncertain in
results. Dufault avoided seating himself on
a King Frederic William chair when
he was warbling a ditty in a Marie An-
toinette peruke and other French trappings
(Re Frederic William, who had a ferocious
habit of kicking or beating anything that
wasn’t very swift on its feet, from a lady
he might pass in the street to a stray par-
son on a parade ground. I imagine
the chairs of that period were studded with
nails, and not intended to be sat upon.)
The Dufault century entertainments have
been booked right up, for Chicago, Los
Angeles and New York in the coming U S
winter season.
Nordica’s first public appearance here
was unmercifully rained on. For the second
concert, Manager Freddie Shipman had a
dazzling streak of luck and a fine night.
Ihe great American soprano is more than
17, and the hungry little mouse of time
has nibbled away a mouthful or two of her
middle register. But her technique, her beau-
tiful upper notes, and her quite astonishing
lower ditto, the charm of her personality,
and the fire and passion of her imperishable’
art, place her amongst the Immortals in
song. She is one of those to whom even
death will not be fatal. “The Erl King,”
as sung by Nordica, is a complete education
in voice production and dramatic inspira-
tion. For her first warble Nordica was
draped in diamonds, relieved by white
satin. A few emeralds, the size of
small green plums, blazed in the diamond
mine on her head. Paul Dufault is in
rounder, fuller voice than he showed at the
end of the Cisneros season, when the
masterful Eleanora’s nerves were on edge.
Franklin Holding, a young New England
fiddler with a European training, is worth
travelling many weary miles in Mr. John-
son’s slowest trains to listen to. He drags
some wonderful ’cello notes out of his fiddle,
and dashes up and down, and in and out
such heavyweight matter as Wagner’s
“Albumblatt” like a few claps of thunder
followed by express lightning. Holding
made a mild sensation on his first appear-
ance with the Nordica co. and was recalled
three times. This gave the hypercritical
time to wonder why American trousers
hitch up in front and don’t fit anywhere.
(Abraham Lincoln’s pants were a tragedy,
though they were no worse than his coat,
and General Grant’s coat was the shape of a
stove.)
Pianist Simmons, who has accompanied
the Nordica voice for 15 years, is It.
He refuses to be applauded, and falls back-
wards into the floral decorations when the
lady tries to haul him forward. Town Clerk
Nesbitt inadvertently coughed in the middle
of a Nordica trill the other night. In an-
swer to infuriated glances from his neigh-
bors (as to whether he was going to do it
again), he hurriedly swallowed a box of
lozenges and choked behind a handkerchief.

as a Divine right. John Barr and C. A.
Jeffries have nailed together a strong and
stirring story of Australia the Unready—
like Ethelred of that ilk —in the hands of
Asiatic invaders. The burning of Sydney,
the chin-chucking of an Australian girl by
the unexpected visitors, and the pace at
which the up-country horse can gallop
across a film, also the astonishment of the
peaceful person who is shot at his own front
door, are included in the Call.
The staff (60 or thereabouts) of the
Imperial Roller Rink (Hyde Park) handed
manager J. C. Bendrodt an illuminated ad-
dress the other day. This token of esteem
for “Square Deal Jim” was intended to mark
his birthday, which he is too young to mind
being mentioned. The illuminations illus-
trate a few sports in which J. C. Bendrodt
got away with championships before he
sharpened his first razor. A Cinderella Fes-
tival on August 18 is going to be roofed
under a sky of pale blue calico, shot with
electric stars of the first magnitude.
Adrian Stephen’s little playlet,
“Anchored,” has just missed fire. By
chopping out a few yards of long, thin dia-
logue and creating a bigger climax —the
present climax is so small as to be hardly
visible to the naked eye—this sketch of col-
lege life might be transformed into a brisk
curtain-raiser. The Sydney Uni’ Dramatic
Society produced the effort in the Concordia
Hall the other night, as a prefix to “The
Lounger Generation.” The author as
Freddie, _ a good sort, put his feet up on
every stick of furniture on the stage with
enormous success. The mantelpiece was
too rocky to stand the burden and responsi-
bility, but this was a mere detail. The
girl in the case, as played by Ailsa Craig,
oufdit to have worn a chin-strap. She tossed
her head like an unbroken filly into the
middle of every other situation, and almost
obscured the plot. Leslie Casey, more pro-
fessional than the rest of the company, was
the strong meat of “Anchored.” “The
Younger Generation,” in three long acts,
was subdivided by two intervals that felt
like a week each. Sandy McLeod and Miss
Ashbury were the brightest sparks in this
mild suburban play. The veteran Chancellor
MacLaurin sat to the bitter end in the
front row. The MaoCallums, Schofields.
Consett Stephen _ and a few more of that
innumerable family, and a large attendance
of undergrads and ’Varsity girls filled the
hall. The orchestra was extra good. This
filled in the. gaps when the company, which
was in various stages of vaccination, pre-
sumably retired to have its arms and legs
tied up.
A small alert man with iron grey hair
and a pair of dark keen eyes rises to the
surface at _ some of the Waller oyster re-
unions. His name is William Devereux. He
came out with the matinee idol, and is
labelled dramatist.” When Mr. Devereux
isn t tossing off a little thing of his own, I
understand he peers into the reason of the
other fellow’s frequent failure and oc-
casional success.
Yours affectionatelv.

“FOR TURON GOLD,** a Tale of the ’Fifties.
By DON DELANEY (author of “Gentleman Jack,” “The Captain of the Gang,” etc.).
PRICE, 1/-; POST FREE, 1/1.
The gold fever in Australia has been responsible for much joy and more sorrow; much
comedy and more tragedy, and “For Turon Gold” tells the story of a gold rush and its results
in a manner that stamps the author as a writer of unusual ability.
What with the murder mystery that opens the story, the bushranging incidents that envelop
the hero by sheer force of circumstances, and the love strain that runs parallel to the main
plot, all combine to form one of the finest goldfield tales that have seen the light in Australia.
Old miners will rejoice in this story, young miners will contrast thos.e far-away times with the
present; and general readers will welcome the book for itself.
“ABORIGINALITIES” from “The Bulletin.”
Selected by Charles Bertie, Author of “Old Sydney,” etc.
With 39 Illustrations by Lionel Lindsay. PRICE, 1/-; POST FREE, 1/1.
Readers of The Bulletin, the fnost popular paper in Australia, will welcome this book with
enthusiasm, as it will enable them to enjoy afresh many a hearty joke that tickled them years ago.
Mr. Bertie has selected only the best, so that readers are saved the weeding-out process inevitable
in such a collection of contributions as appears in a weekly paper. The supreme advantage of
having an artist like Lindsay to illumine the text will be apparent the moment you open this book,
which should prove a mirth-producer second to none. To those who may not be Bulletin
readers we say, “Buy a copy of ‘Aboriginalities’ at once. You will laugh and grow fat.”

“DAN KELLY, OUTLAW” By Ambrose pratt, l/-; post free, 1/1

“THREE YEARS WITH THUNDERBOLT”
Edited by AMBROSE PRATT, 1/-; post free, 1/1
Bushranging stories, like far-off fields, are ever green, and when the bushranger has a noted
personality, and is not a mere robber, there is an added charm attached to the tale.
“THE OUTLAWS OF WEDDIN RANGE”
By AMBROSE PRATT, 1/-; post free, 1/1
The many stirring episodes in Ben Hall’s life are depicted with such skill that, while we are
reading actual history, the whole thing has an air of genuine romance.
“GENTLEMAN JACK” By DON DELANEY, 1/-; post free, l/l
Altogether a rattling story, apart from the fact that the doings of the notorious Ben Hall gang
are woven in with the main plot, and lend it a keen note of tragedy.
“THE DEVIL’S NIGHTCAP” By LANCELOT booth, l/-; post free, l/l
The story of the Ben Hall-Gardiner gang. Historically true in outline, full of strenuous incident
and dramatic tableaux.
“THE CONVICT PUGILIST” By GEO. COCKERILL, l/- ; post free, l/l
A tale of the early days when might was often right. Contains graphic descriptions of fights
that frequently meant life or death. Exciting, thrilling*, and entertaining.
“THE SPELL OF THE BUSH” By JOHN X. CAMERON, l/-; post free, l/l
To many “The Spell of the Bush” is a Jiving thing that haunts and charms simultaneously ; but,
when to that is added the fascinating touch of bushranging, you come under an influence that
compels you to read on and on to the end.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, July 28, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
G.-G. Denman hurried away last week to
Kosciusko, and State Governor Fuller
labored up the white sides of Buffalo. Ap-
parently, no local mountain can hold two
personages at once. The Barttelofc couple
accompanied the little G.-G., and Alys
Bridges accompanied them, thereby, of
course, being more or less adjacent to the
G-G. Alys is now regarded enviously by
the Society fnskers. She is the daughter
of the fine old Admiral who runs the moated
Prawalla Grange on strict quarter-deck lines
Denman sometimes drops in on a hunting
morning and borrows a horse from the
stables.
The ceremonious vaccination of the Fed-
eral Government House party was not so
much an example to the community at large
as a quiet preparation for the Kosciusko
visit. Germs are no respecters of cocked
hats, and any personage who brought home
a tew would imperil his popularity.
Society will pay 10s. per head to sit shoul-
der to shoulder with the G.-G., in the widow
Staughton s Toorak ballroom, on August
1. lhe receipts are to swell the fund
already raised to buy singer Elizabeth New-
bold some foreign study. A musical pro-
gramme, which will include beneficiare
luzzie in operatic sketches, will cheer up
the half-sovereign listeners.
Guy Madden, the well-nourished son of
"°un, ls , at last booke <3 for the altar. Charlie
McEvoys daughter Doris is the enchanting
fiancee. The Maddens and the McEvoys
have been flatting for some time past at
Cliveden Mansions.
Guy Madden, now that he is engaged to a
squatter s daughter, may get his heart’s de-
sire and “settle on the land.” Pa John did
his best to make a lawyer of Guy; but the
land has always attracted him. Even the
lovely kilt he wears as an oflicer of the
Scottish Regiment isn’t likely to anchor him
to the city.
Max Meldrum is to paint the Denman
AT )r fi' ,f° r the Commonwealth collection.
Meldrum s season at the Athenaeum Gallery
(the artists have to book their seasons far
ahead) began last week. The modern
craze for brilliant effects has not touched
him. There are four walls of misty greys
sombre browns and subdued tones, inter-
spersed here and there with family portraits
mostly baby. There is also a large can-
vas tuH of Meldrum family—papa, mamma,
all the children, and the family work basket,
including the homely bundle of tape. Alfred
Deakin, who has been out of the public eye
lately, glided round at the private view.
Louise Smith, whose millionaire husband
has become a recognised patron of art, im-
pressed all present with an amazing purple
frock and an outspread Elizabethan collar.
Ihe artist s wife paraded in greeny-yellow
trimmings and a purple hat. Mrs. Gavin
Duffy was in a black frock, and wore a row
of rubies clasped tightly round her very
plump _ throat. Several busy medicine men
burst in for a few minutes to examine the
pictures’ red rash and aggravate it with
their cheque books.
Marjorie Sproule is to marry Dr. Isaac
Jones, at Holy Trinity, Kew. on August 6.
Subsequently, the pair will depart for Eng-
*and - o he bride-elect is staying with Mrs.
Geotr. Syme, at Banool, until the great dav
arrives, when a small Syme child will second
her at a very quiet ceremony.
The members of the Royal Yacht Club
have sent out pasteboards as large as pillow-
shps, inviting a shipload of Societv to come
and dance in the same room as the G.-G., on
a dimly-remote evening—October 31. Pre-
sumably they just had to spread the glad
*-bat the potentate was engaged for
the far-off revel.
lhe South Yarra Skating Carnival raged
tor two nights last week. The rink was
turned into a street in Bagdad, with striped
awnings held up by polo guards and posts.
A quarter-mile chain of Chinese lanterns
marked the approach out-of-doors, while
within, all the illumination filtered through
big scarlet blooms. The suburban imagina-
il ? a S nd 1° be stri ctly limited when
mt ted v Wlth ? fanc y~dress outbreak; but a
large heap of expensive silver exposed in a
case urged the local youth to super-
suburban efforts. Eight young bloods (sub-
urban bloods of Toorak) appeared scantily
whTte cs a it Cmga a boyS ‘ They were mostly
£ e allco and brown stain. Skating ex-
Mrs Mpr’nhi . assis l ed Edwards and
Justice Si bl a W j th tbe Judging. Mrs.
enH f n dw l rds adorned the bench in furs
herself hat * , one girl muffled
frost and and crystal
rrost, and went as Winter— the white
Christmas-card variety of Winter Bhe
was politely summed up as being for-
eign to the South Yarra climate.
Miss Morris, a skating Maorilander. carried
off a prize as a cute little red devil. Gwennie
Watt wrapped herself in a 2000-vear-nld
shawl abstracted from mamma’s cedar ches’t
Sior led M ?, e ,f t™ “Eastern”
Griffiths, in a somewhat
similar costume, did without the veil, and,
when challenged, described herself as a
Turkish suffragette, or something of the
kind. Her clothes, were apricot and orange.
The hockey champion, Miss Clendinnen, slid
round as a demure blue-and-white Dutch
girl.
Mrs. Trenchard, a smart little Toorak
matron who owns a fine complexion and
coal-black hair, fell and broke her leg,
while practising at the Glaciarium, last
week. She was trying some new ice-cutting
figures when the accident happened.
Chinese Consul-General Hwang has been
given six months’ leave in which to recover
from the excitement of being used as a target
for the execrable revolver practice of Thomas
Jones Chia. The consular corps in Mel-
bourne banqueted Hwang at Menzies’, and
such an array of diplomatic personages had
not been seen since the last Lehar opera.
The Consul, is to spend his holiday in the
new republic, accompanied by his family.
During his absence the urbane and dapper
Willy Ah Ket will wear the gorgeous robes
of an official life whenever necessary.
Which reminds one of Uni Russell. She is
at present in the Fog, and in letters to Mel-
bourne friends writes brightly of visits to
theatres, concerts and so forth.
For their second masquerade, the Vic-
torian Artists avoided the crushing weight
of Society by making the show cheap, and
flying from the spacious Town Hall. On
Wednesday of last week they frivolled in
careless abandon at the Eastern Hill build-
ing Painted hessian tapestry, realistically
full of dust (raised by former dances), hung
anyhow round the two dancing rooms. The
revellers were mostly students, the artisti-
cally grown-up dignitaries having formed
themselves into another - and more serious
faction. The crowd looked rather tawdry,
having dressed itself anyhow in any old
furnishings that happened to be lying round.
Ihe second-best table cover, with all its
ink and beer stains, became the cloak or
bedgown of a knight. A crumpled kimono,
lashed to the plump figure of a girl with a
model s sash, gave a homely touch to the
function. A home-made Pierrette seemed
supremely happy in her bunchy clothes ; and
a dragon slayer, or dog collector, of the Mid-
dle Ages took great pride in his kerosene tin
armor. Beer was on tap in the underground
supper dungeons, and the most artistic
adaptations of Bunny Hug and Gaby Glide
raged cheerfully above. The wide, two-
branched staircase was thronged ’ with
dancers. whose costumes didn’t look so bad
when viewed charitably by the lurid glow
of a few red-shaded lights. As usual, the
gayest part of the show was the endless
and uproarious journey homeward in the cold
hours of the morning, when every glum and
guarded house front seems to typify helpless
respectability and invite derision.
The noise and uproar occasioned by three
Australian girls meeting at Colombo has
fc h w rC i fai ?s y here b y letter. Heiress
Mario Hall, with a new tussore outfit, is
staying with Mrs. Planter Richards, who
was Jessie Rowe before she was altared.
Ihe third cheerful wanderer is Mrs Jar-
rard, who is coming home from London via
Golombo. According to despatches, they are
all having a perfectly lovely time.” Their
letters, underscored and blotted with heavy
notes of exclamation, are being enviouslv
read by Australian she-friends. The wild-
est shrieks of all relate to a forthcoming
t lerrot and Pierrette carnival, at which
everybody who is anybody dresses in the
loose garb of frivolity. The men have
black suits and white pom-poms, and the
girls have white suits and any color pom-
pom they please. “Delicious, mv dear T ”
scribbles one spoilt girl. “My blue pom-
poms just match my eyes!”
Last week I informed you that prettv
Miss Bardie” Willis, of South Yarra, was
engaged to squatter Leslie Pearson, of
Mudgee, N S.W A letter just to hand in-
forms me that the lucky man is not squatter
Leslie, but Mr. L. T. Pearson, of the Com-
RUer Banking Co ” w ingham, Manning
The Norman Armytage lady, after duly
farewelling herself and daughter Edna, has
ventured to Sydney for a few weeks, ere
going on to Bananaland. Papa Norman
reclines at South Yarra a little longer be-
fore putting on his boots and following them
north.
The Shakspeare Society’s sixth meeting of
the present year of grace is to happen at
the Austral Salon to-morrow (Friday). The
first paper on the programme makes an
earnest, appeal to feminine feeling. It is to
deal with “the constancy of woman’s and
the fickleness of man s love.” Lower down
on the programme members are reminded
that the hon. treasurer and secretary are
open to receive overdue subscriptions. 'Even
culchaw is apt to forget Shakspeare when
the annual ten shillings comes due.
Dorothea Spinney, a lady who is pictured
wearing Grecian dress and the rapt expres-
sion of a she-Hamlet, is about to invade this
city with a number of Greek plays. Doro-
thea is said to express the Beautiful in
v ° ice > body and mind, and she works by
the light of two tall candles in front of a
blue curtain. Her business costume is an
embroidered Grecian gown and sandals.
Motor loads of Brains are expected at the
Masonic Hall when she starts her dimly pic-
turesque show.
Rieke Parker, the clever young Tasmanian
pianiste, scored a success with her Town
Hall concert last week. The balconies
were inhabited by the Best People, and even
the South Gallery was ennobled with bare
shoulders and powdered noses. Two lots
of Governor bought seats, but, being away
mountaineering at the time, their paid-for
emptiness amongst the Town Hall draughts
advertised their distinguished absence. Gaud
Mayor Hennessy, knowing the place well,
avoided the floor, and roosted comfortably in
the balcony. His Gaudess sat by his side
muffled to the eyes in chinchilla. Some old
carved coral showed in her hair. The Pin-
schofs were also seated aloft, and Sugden,
of Queen’s, flashed appreciation through
his glasses close by. A quite-new bride
sat in the very front row and showed off
a lovely blue velvet and ermine trousseau
cloak. Justice a Beckett braved the cold
with his dame, in order 1 6 witness the
triumph of their young protegee. Miss
Michaelis stayed behind the scenes to
hearten the performer, who looked a very
dainty little figure in soft blue crepe. She
recovered quickly from her first nervous-
ness, and rose splendidly to the occasion in
the. big Greig concerto, with Scharf thun-
dering on the second piano. One William
Webber was to have punched this instru-
ment ; but a vaccinated arm refused duty,
and the talented and experienced Scharf,
who has a heart of gold, came to the rescue.
Mrs. Jansen, Horace Stevens, Amadio and
Olga Woinarski provided good support.
Many legal lights gleamed in the audience.
Justice Cussen discharged the piano without
a stain on its character; Professor Harri-
son Moore folded his hands, pursed his
lips and gave judgment for the defendant,
with costs. Mrs. Judge Tute, from India,
who is backing up the little player, con-
curred in a dream of a black gown, and
underneath an osprey. Mrs. Albert Miller
turned her handsome grey head to gloat over
the house she had helped to assemble. Mrs.
Peterson and Drs. Meyer and Barrett lent
their ears willingly. Enid Derham and
Dora de Beere, who had secretaried the
show, drifted quietly in and sank thankfully
into their chairs.
Mrs. May Yale Gilfillan is inviting friends
to come along to her studio, at 483 Collins-
street, on Friday, August 1, and look at
her latest batch of work. May is a great
and wily toiler. She shuts her studio door
and evades the time-thieving gossiper for
weeks on end. Then the door is flung open
and a general invitation goes forth.
The two Canberra pictures (by Lister
Lister and Pen Boyd) are now suspended
in Queen’s Hall, Parliament House, and,
after looking at them, the beholder realises
m what a shadeless land the Federal rabbits
flick their tails. Pity it didn’t occur to
someone to make a show of the dozens of
competitive pictures, and allow the public to
get. different versions of the selected deso-
lation. Of the artists who pilgrimaged to
the place, Louis McCubbin was first, and he
managed to get a bed at a farmhouse. Most
of the others are believed to have resided in
rabbit burrows.
Melbourne has been taking its vaccination
scars quietly with music. Strenuous forms
of amusement have been avoided, and the
populace has shown a desire to crowd in
wherever it was possible to get a chair and
listen to sweet sounds. Edward Goll,
David Bispham (now hurrying back to New
York)i and Peter Dawson all benefited.
The Warrawee Club has been eating its
collective hat and speaking sharply to its
husband ever since a rival roost captured
Gen6e. When the Warrawee killed the
fatted muffin, arranged a musical pro-
gramme and put on its. company smile —well,
that day the distinguished guest sent word
that she was suffering from vaccination
ache and a muscle-bound calf, and simply
couldn’t attend. The disappointed ladies
thereupon tore the muffins to shreds, dashed
the crockery about and ran the programme
through like a gibberphone record at its
maddest.
GenSe learnt all her fairy steps from an
uncle—Aiexander Gen<§e, a fine old man
who is still teaching the young and agile
how to foot it in London. The star was
brought up by the uncle and aunt. Our
own Jennie Brenan had lessons from the
same master, and used to practise in the
same room with Gen6e.
Mrs. William Green, a worshipper of toe
dancing who has taught the art to at least
a counie of generations of Australian chil-
dren, has been sitting humbly at the gifted
feet of Genee. Lp to date, the devotee has
spent 12 nights in the same seat in a posi-
tive ecstasy of admiration.
. Dancing-mistress Jennie Brenan gave a
big party in honor of Gen4e last week The
whole downstairs portion of the Vienna
Pare was engaged for the hundreds of
guests, and everyday tea-takers were
directed upstairs to the supper rooms
where they sipped and flapped their ears
while the cicada-buzz of gossip ascended to
the roof. Theatrical rehearsals cannot be
hurried for anyone; so it came to pass that
hostess Jennie and guest Gen6e arrived late
at their own party. GenSe looked as dream-
fully dainty as her own Sylph Dance. She
arrived muffled in dark furs. When these
were slipped off, she was revealed, trium-
phantly fair, in a little French gown of
white embroidery moulded on to a clinging
white under-dress made of some soft, silkv-
woolly material. A hat that was not much
more than a wreath of wild flowers and a
great black osprey shooting straight up
finished the smartest picture you ever saw
at an afternoon tea stance. Genre’s own
hair is silver fair—the real ash-blonde. She
has to cover her pretty natural thatch with
a wig when dancing, otherwise it would
tumble about her face. Two Australian
women-writers—Marion Miller and Annie
Rentoul —had each prepared an ode to the
idol, and Muriel Starr, of the ’cello-toned
voice, read them aloud to great applause.
The numerous Brerian sisters —each in a
worshipful hat —helped to guide the guests
to their appointed seats, and waiters sport-
ing the Danish colors in their buttonholes
fed the company seven courses of afternoon
refreshment. Mrs. Tallis, radiant in a blue
hat like a crown, sat next to the guest of
honor. Tommy Cochrane, the socially in-
dispensable, showed the admiring company
his new whiskers, which are of the fashion-
able variety known as “sideboards.” They
give the countenance a look of manly sev-
erity, and were much used about 25 years
ago. If you want some for your husband
you can get the pattern out of any old
photograph album. The Forrest dame,
accompanied by a sky-blue niece, sat at a
table on the dais. Mrs. Gordon Lyon, just
returned from her honeymoon, wore an im-
pressively new pale grey tailor-made cos-
tume. Mrs. Loder accompanied her. ' Mrs.
Ledingham. back from Maoriland, was
another who took tea and what else was
going. Mrs. Fred Krerouse, who was dancer
Essie Perrin, came along in her prettiest
frock and rendered homage to the illustrious
one. . Mrs. Hennessy smiled in black and
white, and her Gaud Mayor called for her
in time to get a cup of tea. Mrs. Fred
Rowe wore a dark green suit and looked as
young as her own daughter. It was the
merriest party on record this season, and
the chatter was accompanied bv a fine feast
of music.
A Pierrot ball is the next frivol that St.
Kilda has in view at its local Town Hall.
Eric Maxon is the “arranger.” The charit-
able object-—all fancv-dress balls must have
earnest Christian intentions —is the Homoeo-
pathic Hospital, and the shivoo is fixed for
next Tuesday, the sth.
Next month (Providence and the Health
authorities permitting) Ivy Bickford, whose
Conservatorium-trained voice has been a
tuneful feature of shows given by the Royal
Comics, is to murmur “I will” to Mr. L.
Muston, of your city. The bridegroom-elect
was recently concerned in a determined but
unsuccessful conspiracy to lower the Sydney
to Melbourne motor record. The marriage
is to take place at St. Andrew’s, Clifton
Hill.
The bright little show of pictures at the
Guild Hall, for which Mrs. Phillips Fox is
responsible, did not close last Saturday, as
was originally intended. General Desire
pleaded for an extension of the season, and
Mrs. Fox. being an amiable little lady, who
wouldn’t dream of disappointing the General,
is keeping the exhibition open till the end of
this week.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Asches gave a dance on Monday. It began
at midnight, and lasted till sunrise. The Grand
Central Hotel, which was where the revel occurred,
fairly rang with laughter and merriment, and the
poetic sound of carefully clothed feet bounding
heavily upon carefully unclothed boards.
A good deal of joy and a tremendous amount of
exercise was also obtained from the benefit dance
on behalf of St. Peter’s Church, Glenelg. Mr. Stir-
ling and Mr. Packard organised it, and through its
agency extracted a heap of coin from the populace’s
coffers. Many of the women wore their “Kismet”
frocks. Great is the lure of the Turkish trouser.
Now that the garment has appeared at a Church ball,
what are the odds against its figuring presently at
an evening service within the sacred fane itself?
The Salmonds, of Maoriland, who once lived here,
are spending a day or so with Miss Murray at
Magill. Their hostess captured them aboard the Mon-
golia.
Miss Dorothy Herring, who has been staying with
her aunt, Mrs. Harold Fisher, has returned to Mel-
bourne.
Prince Alfred’s and St. Peter’s colleges conducted
their annual football struggle at the Adelaide Oval
on Saturday. The weather was depressing, and the
play likewise. Lady Bosanquet and a daughter per-
vaded the vice-regal box.
The small-pox is here—that is to say, some call it
small-pox, others nettle-rash. Meanwhile the suspect,
and all her friends and relatives to the nth remove,
have been deported to Torrens Island.
We may look for a boom in spring-poets. A
“Bundey Prize for English Verse” has been estab-
lished in connection with the University, and £lO
will be given each year for the best poem. The
committee or board or council, or whatever it is,
retains the right of making no award in any year
in which a £lO genius fails to step forward with
the goods. Miss Ellen Bundey has supplied the
necessary funds, and the prize is to be a memorial
to her. parents—the late Justice Bundey and his
wife.
Andrew Tennant, who died on Saturday, had been
sheep-breeding here since he was old enough to do
anything, and he grew rich at the game. He arrived,
cetat. three years, in ’3B, and made for the Far West
with cattle and sheep when he was 18. He was a
keen racing man, and was in Parliament for about 10
years. Mrs. R. M. Hawker is one of his daughters.
The other married an A.D.C. to Lord Kintore, Cap-
tain Anstruther Thomson, and lives in London.
Telegraphist Kearman, of Charlotte Waters, has
brought to Adelaide an aboriginal who apparently is
an artist in the making. He is known as Jim
Kite, and works with clay and vegetable dyes. His
designs and color effects are good, and he gets real
life and movement into his things.
. Government House was flung open on Thursday
night for a dance that was officially described as
“small.” A “small” dance is one of those enter-
tainments from which the 200 people who were
asked emerge cheerfully and tell the 2000 who
weren’t asked, but who thought they should have
been, how perfectly scrumptious the show was, and
how essential it is, these levelling times, that the
social line should be drawn somewhere, if only at
long intervals. _ This is really the best part of the
dance for the intensely haughty invitees.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
When Henry Willis dies, N.S.W., if it
does the fair thing, will give him a public
funeral, and write above his dust that he
was the best Speaker the State ever pos-
sessed. He made order out of chaos. He
made even Fitzpatrick condhct himself with
a semblance of peace. In his readiness for
every emergency lie resembled Speaker Bent,
of Victoria, but Bent was ignorant,
tempered and bankrupt in the letter “h,”
and had to invent his Parliamentary law as
he went along. He depended on his roar .to
make good all deficiencies. Willis’s Parlia-
mentary law could stand inspection, and .he
was never reduced to roaring, or gnashing
his teeth, or any other of Bent’s cheap de-
vices.
Another source of the roast bull of Old
England appears to be drying up. The
United States thinks of putting meat on the
free list, on the ground that there is prac-
tically no surplus for export now in Uncle
Sam’s country, and that it will soon have
to import. With one more supplier cut off,
and op.e more competitor clamoring for what
spare oow there is left in Australia. Maori-
land, Russia and Argentina, the British
ihop—Britain being especially dependent
in imports —is likely soon to cost 2s. per lb.
Whenever a country leaves off being an ex-
porter of food, and becomes an importer,
the change counts for two votes on a divi-
sion. And two votes count for a lot.
BIGGEST-GAME HUNTING.
A curious feature of the completed Senate
election returns from the Ma State is that
Macnuarie, Illawarra and Hunter all gave
the Liberal candidates a majority, although
each constituency returned a Laborite to the
House of Reps. “Mary” Gould had a
majority in 19 electorates out of 27 —-a pain-
ful circumstance which should give State
Premier Holman, who ran away from the
fight, food for reflection.
Like all political party programmes, the
one just issued by the Maoriland Labor
Unity committee is full of fine promises and
catchy phrases calculated to impress the
delegates at the forthcoming conference.
But in again emphasising the doctrine of
shirk—the six-hour day and a voluntary
defence force —it is plain that the com-
mittee is appealing to what has been the
curse of M.L. Labor. From the union sec-
retary, who will not budge from ordinary
office routine, to the member who dodges
the paying of his weekly sixpence, great are
the numbers under the baneful influence of
Shirk. It was the same old desire to follow
the apparently easy road and let someone
else toil, which led the M.L. Labor party
to join the Liberals in former days. It is
time now that Labor leaders inculcated that
Work, and more than six hours a day of it.
is what is needed to get the country and the
party out of the bog. A country that does
so little work in eight hours that it has to
borrow like mad from Bull in London to
keep things going, and which has practically
stolen Bull’s sinking fund to pay for some
more thorns to crackle under the pot, isn’t
in a position to cut down its toiling hours.
When Henry Willis xesigned from the
Speakership of the N. S. Wales Assembly
the other night the yelping pack behind
“Sporting Charlie” Wade flew at him with
all the thrippenny-bar abuse handy. No
bottles or rocks were thrown; the frog-
marching of some of the push from' the
chamber by the police on previous occasions
having taught its lesson; but such choice
phrases as “coward,” “traitor,” “scoundrel.”
“scallywag.” “recreant,” “wretched im-
becile,” “crpature.” etc., showed where
Micko and Billo lurked. Pa Perry hurled
this :
Here lies the bones of Speaker Willis,
With contempt he used to fill us ;
No chance has he to enter Heaven,
The gates are guarded by eleven.
No doubt he’s in a lower level.
Our sympathy is with the Devil;
For if his majesty rebel,
He’S sure to turn him out of Hell.
The political brilliancy of the party could
go no farther. \
UNSAITSTIED APTETITE.
I now voluntarily vacate the chair, and shall,
without delay, tender my resignation of the office
of Speaker of this House. — Mr. Willis, in the N.S.W.
Legislature.
THE CROCWADELLE: “Andto think that, despite
all, my efforts to upset him, he’s landed
safely.”
Richard Meagher, commenting (22/7/T3)
in N. S. Wales Assembly, on the occasion
when ex-Speaker Willis was elected to the
Chair of that august body : —-
The proceedings lasted nearly 19 hours, and all
the vile epithets which could be applied in the lowest
den, or in any part of Port Said, to any poor, unedu-
cated or demented individual, were poured upon the
head of the gentleman who occupied the chair.
And, as nobody on the Liberal side con-
tradicted Dr. Arthur when he interjected,
“They were justified,” presumably that’s the
kind of thing Fitzparrot, Wood, Wade and
Co. stand for.
Even in Labor-ruled
Ivalgoorlie and Boulder
(W.A.) some abnormally
silly things are done. The
I towns and district
we ruled by three local
governing bodies —t w o
Municipalities and a
Roads Board. The up-
keep of the three runs
into thousands a year, and
not one of them is af-
fluent ; yet any proposal
to cut down expenses by
getting the work done bet-
ter by one body is looked
upon as black treason).
The other day, when
there was talk of abol-
ishing the Roads Board,
more outcry and moan-
ing took place than if the bottom had fallen
out of the Golden Mile.
“H.H.”: In 1845 the minimum height of
the British Tommy Atkins was sft. 6in. In
1872 it was sft. sin. It got down to sft. 3in.
in 1883; sft. 2in. in 1897; and then it
dipped to sft. Yet in some districts of Eng-
land 60 per cent, of the recruits offering are
rejected. Even healthy five-footers are be-
coming scarce as J. Bull’s country becomes
more crowded and the roast beef of Old
England doesn’t increase to correspond.
THE REASON WHY.
It was remarkable that there was not one single
reference in the Speech to finance. — Mr. Wade, in
reply to the N.S.W. Governor’s speech at the open-
ing of Parliament.
LENDOOFSIRIN: “Vet, I don't suppose the
Government vanted to advertise me in the
matter. ”
There is a peaceful and untroubled sort
of man who sits and does little of import-
ance all day, amid expensive premises in
San Francisco, and is paid for it by the
N.S.W. taxpayer. When Nielsen, the re-
volted supporter of the McGowen Govern-
ment, was sent away out of the road, to
look hard at nothing, with £4 a day over
and above his Parliamentary salary to
stand between him and destitution, he took
the premises. Nielsen has given up his job
of looking hard at nothing, but the premises
are kept on. Perhaps if they had been aban-
doned as quite useless as soon as Nielsen
was done with, it would have made the
wonderful £4 “mission” look altogether too
bogus.
When the N.S.W. State Legislature
opened for conversation and expenditure,
Henry Willis cast the Speakership at the
heads of his old patrons, and retired into
the seclusion of private membership. He
was astute to the last. There wasn’t much
Speakership left. If he retained the frag-
ment it would damage his chance of re-
election as a Liberal. And, if he was re-
elected to the House despite this handicap,
there would be nothing much in the pros-
pect. Supposing the Liberals secure a
majority in the next Assembly, they. will
have no use for Speaker Willis. And if the
Laborites have such a big majority that
they can spare one of their own men, they
won’t give the dignity and emoluments to
an opponent —not even to Willis. So Henry
stepped lightly out at the correct moment,
and left the invidious remnant of the job to
Morton.
‘‘Henry Horsecollar”: Small-pox is less
deadly these days than it once was, even if
we are not vaccinated regularly, because
many of us have been treated in infancy, or
our parents have been treated before us.
The average anti- doesn’t know what the
horror was like before vaccination became
common, and what it may be like again.
In the Franco-German war the Germans
(who practised vaccination) lost 263 sol-
diers through small-pox. The French (who
didn’t practise vaccination so rigidly) lost
out of a much smaller army, 23,499. In the
war between Brazil and Paraguay, which
wasn’t a war of very big armies, the Brazil-
ians (who didn’t vaccinate in a compulsory
sense) lost 43,000 soldiers (35 per cent, of
their army) through one form of small-vox
alone. And there were other forms. Yet
the Brazilian army was well-fed, well-
clothed, well-paid, and well-cared for.
Until vaccination came into use it
wasn’t uncommon for European parents,
even of the better class, to surreptitiously
kill those of their children who had sur-
vived the disease, because it had made them
so painful to look upon that it was better
that they should be dead than alive. Now
that vaccination has made small-pox a fairly
mild complaint, a lot of dam-fools say that
it is such a mild complaint that vaccina-
tion is superfluous. But if the world leaves
off vaccination for a generation or two, and
gets the old calamity back again—the cal-
amity that made people blind and deaf and
imbecile, and ate away one-half of the face,
and made the other half a mass of revolting
scars —well, the world may feel a trifle
tired of itself. Inside 70 years, before vac-
cination started, small-pox killed a British
queen, a German emperor, a French king, a
Swedish queen, a Russian emperor, and
three successive heirs to the French throne.
It did itself proud in the small range of
five countries, so it isn’t merely a trouble
of the poor. About June, 1884, in the
north-east of London alone, unvaccinated
persons were dying of small-pox at the rate
of 36 per week. That wasn’t a bad record
for one suburb.
Prime Minister Cook, after droning to the
bucolics of Wedderburn (Vic.) about the
“political claptrap,” “rhodomontade,” and
“canting ranting propaganda” of Labor
members, informed his audience that his
Government stood for “stability, patriotism,
success and the general welfare,” and meant
“to build up the social and industrial life of
Australia.” No claptrap, rhodomontade and
rant in Joseph’s addresses to the people.
For incisive and convincing eloquence this
builder-up of social and industrial life wants
a lot of beating.
Ewing, the one-time Federal politician
who now pervades the Tasmanian Assembly,
has been lecturing on “The Political Out-
look.” Things are in a dreadful tangle in
the Speck’s politics, he admits, but there is
no hope from The Bulletin’s proposal to
straighten things out by adopting the elec-
tive-Ministry system :
Suppose we had elective Ministries, and he (Ewing)
were chosen Attorney-General and Mr. Dicker Mini-
ster for Works. If then the question of preference to
unionists as a Government policy came before the
Ministry, what a lovely row there would be!
And what an uninformed politician N. K.
Ewing must be to suppose that, under the
elective system, Ministers would decide
whether this or that should be “Government
policy” ! If Ewing is the best-qualified man
in the House to be Attorney-General and
Dicker is the man best qualified to be Min-
ister for Works, the elective system would
give the country the benefit of their services,
instead of squeezing one or the other out, as
the present absurd system does, because the
man who ought to be Attorney-General
doesn’t agree with the man who ought to be
Minister for Works on some question relat-
ing to a subject that isn’t in either the Law
or the Works Department.
It was a particularly heavy shock that
the Liberal Union in Adelaide got by the
death of Joseph Vardon, its president. There
are rumors that the Union has not been a
happy family, and Ilutley, its secretary, has
sent in his resignation. The local Herald
said he was asked to do so, after a stormy
meeting, and Vardon allowed himself to be
interviewed on the matter one Saturday
morning. “A pack of lies, from start to
finish,” he said cheerfully. Then he told
the pressmen to leave the matter alone, and.
he would give them a full, written statement):
next day (Sunday). But he died during tie-
Saturday night, from brain hemorrhage. As :
it happened, Vardon, never brilliant, bn* a
born fighter, and absolutely “straight,” had;
spoken his own best epitaph in that interview.
“Every public man will have enemies/’ he.
said, laughing at the idea of worrying, about
them. “Gracious me, you cannot please
everybody, and only an angel would' try 1 I
have gone ahead in my own way, feeling that
I was doing the right and straightforward
thing. A man would not be worth his salt
if he tried to adapt himself and his views
to every passing current. I have always
gone on this principle: find out what was
right, and stick to that. I’ve tried to do
that, anyhow.” And when he was dead allj
the political parties said “Amen.”
THE SMALL CRACKER .
Mr. Holman proposes to introduce a Bill in the
N.S.W. State Legislature to deal with monopolies
within the State.
THE MAN WHO BIFFED THE REFERENDUM:
"That’s right, sir, fire away. I’m a
great believer in States Rights .”
They break them in young at Ma’s lovely'
State Assembly. Thus, when the recently-
elefted member for Yass (Nielsen’s old 1
seat), J. J. McGirr, was moving the
Address-in-Reply, he referred to a request
made by W. H. Wood, for a chairman to'
preside over his (Wood’s) address to a body
of navvies at Yass during the by-election.
Said McGirr:—
They obligingly found a chairman in a local man
—that was the sanitary man —and they said that
he would be a most useful man to catch the effluvia
which generally flows from the hon. member for
Bega on those occasions.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The big winter meeting at Caulfield begins
on Saturday, when a flattering handicap will pro-
bably bring a fairly numerous field to the post for
the Zi miles Hurdle. Acceptances are not due be-
fore this paper goes to press, but at time of writing
it was generally understood that the mighty Obi
and the hot-headed Wimmera would be missing from
the fray. In which case Forest Prince and Uxdndge
(last year’s winner) will be favorites among the
heavyweights. As often as not the race has of late
years gone to something weighted at less than 10st.,
and quite-likely winners in Cannon Wheel and
Rogue’s March have been let in at 9st. 31b. and
9st. respectively. Sut this writer’s fancy is for
Ballista (9st. 71b.), although his latest running sug-
gests that he is not quite wound up. The sugges-
tions of latest running are, however, sometimes mis-
leading.
Meanwhile the Steeplechase, due on the following
Saturday, is more talked of than the Australian
Hurdle Race. Leah Kleshna is to be started for
the four miles’ journey on the understanding that,
if she wins, she' and her jockey (Morgan) will be
sent to England to try for the Liverpool Grand
National. All the same, 12st. lib. is a heavy
weight for Leah to carry, and the brilliant Bulla-
warra (12st. 111 b.) will, all going well, be better
worth backing. The Flemington course, with its
stiSer fences, proved too much for Bullawarra
three weeks ago; but since then he has put m some
good lumping work, and the Caulfield course will
come 'easier to him. United Kingdom, who would
have been the pick of all the entrants, is looking
not too good as the result of his fall in the Grand
National. *

The story of the development of the
pneumatic tyre for motor-cars and other power-driven
vehicles is a most fascinating one The man in the
street looks upon a tyre as a tube of robber. And
so it is, in a way. But it is rubber that has gone
through a wonderful series of processes to make it
capable of resisting strain and friction. The first
tvres, which were of practically pure rubber, un-
treated in any way, used to last only a few hundred
miles. Nowadavs a motorist feels that he has been
robbed if he doesn’t get thousands of miles off lvs
wheel covering. Years of time and a small ocean of
monev were spent in evolving the modern tjre, an l
foremost in the search for the perfect thing was the
great Continental Caoutchouc and Guttapercha Co ,
which kept a highly-trained chemical staff constantly
experimenting. It had its reward and to-dav the Arm
is among the largest of the world’s rubber manufac-
turing concerns. It is known to the ordinary
individual mostly as the manufacturers of the reli-
able hard-working Continental tvres, which most of
us use at least on our back wheels if we don t use
them on all four. They are found where the strain
is greatest. The way the company went ahead is
nhenomenal In 1871 it employed only 80 hands ; in
the number had swelled to 1000 ; and last year
it had soared up to over 10.000. An increase of
625 per cent, in 12 years! It is a fine expansion to
have about the house.
A motor-cycle weighing about lfcwt. and
developing about 3Uh.p. can hardly be regarded as
a power-driven “bike.” Many men have longed for
something lighter and handier on which they could
jog over the face of the earth at a quiet pace and
feel that thev were on the old familiar bike. All
sorts of attachments to turn the ordinary jigger into
a power machine have been devised; but none of
them have really caught on. The reason is simple
enough. The ordinary is too light to be driven
bv power, and the frame cannot stand the racket.
What is wanted is a lighter and lower-powered
motor-bike, and, according to latest advices, it has
arrived in the shape of the “Motor-Cyclette. This
is reallv a bike weighing about 801 b. or 901 b., instead
of the 251 b. of the ordinary roadster, and fitted with
a 1-i-h.p. engine, which is capable of driving the
machine up any hill within reason. It is an Eng-
lish development, 1 and is expected to travel at least
150 miles on a gallon of petrol, and to be retailed
to the public at something between £25 and £3O.
If they prove to be reliable, these machines should
sell like ripe cherries in summer time. *
R. Lewis, the South African cyclist who
made such a splash by winning the Olympic Road
Race at Stockholm, last year, has just won another
blue-ribbon road race, the “Round Dresden ; a little
sprint of 140} miles. He met the cream of the
men of the German Empire, and beat them all
in 7hr. 52min. 23see. The Germans took off their
hats and said “Hoch!” though somewhat sadly.
• * * *
The fact that the placed cars in the
French Grand Prix, at Amiens, recently, averaged 15
miles to a gallon of petrol means nothing to .the
ordinary motorist. Just consider the type of engines
they used. The bore and stroke of the winning four-
cvlinder Puegeot was 100 by 180 millimetres, which
at racing speed meant, roundly, 150 h.p. Of course,
the average car-owner gasps: “Where the Devil do
they get 72 miles an hour on such a low consump-
tion?” Where indeed? Listen, brother: These en-
gines are high-compressioned, specially tuned up, and
with carburetters so adjusted that the engines wi
not run at slow speeds. Also, brother, there was
practically no gear changing, for the empty cars
weighed onlv from 15cwt. to 21ewt., and, of course,
having ample power, simply flew up all the hills.
Likewise, son of my mother, the gear ratios were
very, very high, so that for every turn of the engine
crank-shaft those cars travelled considerably farther
than any of our ordinary geared chassis has a hope
to do. The question is, brother, do we want that
sort of engine? I trow not, brother; I trow not.
Not while there are policemen at occasional corners
—’twould cost altogether too much.

Australasian riders had no luck in the
English Tourist Trophy Race —as usual. Two years
ago Maorilander Woodman had a fearful smash while
taking part in it, and eventually lost a leg as the re-
sult of the accident. This year H. H. Ragless, of
Adelaide, competed, and although the Isle of Man is
a small place, he ran out of petrol at the farthest
possible spot from any depot, and had in consequence
to retire Maorilander Frobisher had intended to com-
pete, but had a bad smash while practising over the
course. However, he was full of sand, and had him-
self wheeled out of hospital in a bath chair to watch
the race.

The ancient type of horseshoe, invented
in the Year 1, and only slightly improved since, was
an excellent shoe for soft soil, and gave the noble
steed a good grip of his native land when the native
land was in its crude state. But it is no good on
smooth, hard surfaces, and smooth, hard surfaces are
now the order of the day in quite a heap of coun-
tries. The result is that horses have a bad time
when the weather makes for slippiness. The Road
Improvement Association of England has offered a
prize of £lOO for the design of a new type of shoe
which will give a horse a firm grip of the smooth,
hard road. It is to be hoped it comes along, for it
is very pitiful to see the struggles of animals on the
wood-blocked streets of Australian cities. It is up to
someone who has large interests in horseflesh to give
a similar prize for Australian inventors to compete
for.
“WHOA, BOY!”
The elusive English Stagg bounds clear of
Alt Morey's Westralian wallop at Sydney
Stadium.
“Adelaide”: Whatever may be the result
of the coming return match, in Melbourne, South
Aus. gave away the first of its football fixtures this
year simply by bad shooting for goal. At half-time,
Victoria had got six goals in nine shots; S.A. five
in 11: that is, six goals, three behmds to hve
goals, six behinds. Third quarter, Victoria did as
it liked, and the board showed 10 goals seven
behinds to five goals seven behinds. Last quarter,
S A. did as it liked —except in the one detail that
counts. Final scores, 10 goals nine behinds to
seven goals 15 behinds. The latter is a horrible
proportion for first-class players, and the beating
was thoroughly deserved —which does not make it
any the less surprising. The gate was about
a crowd that could easily be surpassed for a match
between two good clubs.

In the Sydney Rugby League’s competi-
tion, Eastern 'Suburbs, the premier .team, continues
to have the luck of the Devil. Stale and flat as the
beer of vester-mid-day, it was just its luck to be
thrown against the baby team, Annandale, while its
nearest competitor, Newtown, was being kicked to
pieces by South Sydney. The premier team beat its
adversary bv 19 points to eight. But the surprise of
the dav was the walloping of Glebe by Balmain.
Balmain is very like nitro-glycerine; one never knows
when it will go off. It blew up when it met South
Svdr.ev on Julv 19, and utterly wrecked that formid-
able combination. On Saturday, Glebe started splen-
didly, and was going great guns, when, suddenly,
without warning, another explos on took place, and
when the smoke cleared away, Glebe was shattered
bv 10 points to six. Balmain suddenly turned into
a' team of clawing tigers, and although Glebe stuck
to the tigers manfullv, it was winded and the tigers
were not. South Sydney overwhelmed Newtown by
14 to five, and but for luck and accident the margin
would have been much bigger. Newtown had for-
gotten the art of passing, especially when the South-
ern pack was raging at close quarters. South kept
on the ball all the time and Newtown, didn t; and
the end was horrible. The slaying and burial of Western
Suburbs by North Svdney was more of a joke than
anything else. The Western team never had a show.
North made a fancy football exhibition of it, and
went home with 20 points to six. It could have gone
home with 40 points had it felt that way. The
general result is to improve the position of East Syd-
nev bv one point in the competition. Last, week, it
was 18 to Newtown’s 16. This week it is 20 to
South Sydney’s 17, and Newtown stands still with
16 Glebe has 14 and North Sydney, Balmain, West-
ern Suburbs and Annandale have single figures only.
In Sydney’s Rugby Union Competition
Eastern Suburbs is still unbeaten, having won the
whole of the. 11 games it has played, with 190 points
to 83 Which is a great performance. The nearest
rivals are University and Newtown, with 13 each,
and Glebe and South Sydney with 12. As East Jias
won the premiership again little interest
attaches to the competition. Th ®, U " 10 " hv t °nfon’s
playing great football these days. The Rugby Union s
trouble is that so few epicures any longer like its
game, and probably one of the brightest matches
ever played, that between University and Easter
luburbs, at the Uni. Oval on Saturday, attracted
only a few hundreds of them. The play was beauti
fully free and clean-handed, and the tactics beady.
Fortune swayed this way and that, but at the finish
Eastern Suburbs happened to be leading bj 16 !?™" ',
to 14. It was all a matter of luck when the whistle
blew. Glebe and Newtown put up a scrambling
game. Both sides were weak owing to the best men
being in Brisbane. The figures were 14 points to
eight. Manlv and South Sydney put up a remark-
ably even game, and the Villagers won with 12
points to South Sydney’s 11. Balmain dealt more
severely with North Sydney, bashing it by 14 to
three;'but the shocking example of the day was the
ruin of St. George by Western Suburbs. Think of
it! 32 to nil; and at Union Rugby, too !
At Brisbane, in showery weather, the
N.S.W. Union Rugby XV played the return match
with Queensland, and met defeat by nine points to
six. N.S.W. started well, picking up the Queens-
land kick-off, centring and then marking right in
front of the Queensland goal. Result three points.
After a general mix-up, interspersed with some good
kicking, a Queenslander, with a short, dodgy run,
crossed and scored, but the kick failed, and the
score was three all. The Queensland forwards beat
the N.S.W. pack all the time, and were continually
camping on the line. Good kicking drove them back,
but they came again and again, and half-time found
Queensland leading by six to three. On the resump-
tion N.S.W. made a resolute endeavor, as Poe said
in “The Bells,” and for quite a time had Queensland
fighting for its life right on its line, till a long kick
drove the visitors to the half-way. Again the Queens-
land forwards broke through, and the result was
another three ponts. A second charge was only
baulked by N.SiW. promptly forcing. N.S.W. tried
a dribbling charge, and drove its furious chariot
from one end of the field to the other, and Queens-
land had to force. Short passing charges carried
N S.W. to the line again, but Queensland kicked
clear, followed up, counter-charged and was pulled
down only just in time. The N.S.W five-eighth,
Fusedale, scored a brilliant mark, and lifted the Ma
team’s score to six; and then both sides let them-
selves go and played like Beelzebub and Henry
Methuselah. Queensland got the best of , and
was threatening very hard when the whistle blew,
and Ma was walloped. # ,
N.S.W. Rugby League lately took up an
attitude likely to do it much credit. A couple of
disqualified Soccer players endeavored to surrepti-
tiouslv creep under the League wing, but the League
promptly clawed them out. The time is ripe for all
the brands of football raging in Sydney to recognise
each other’s disqualifications.
* * *
Saturday’s Melbourne boofball panned out
as expected, and left teams in much the
same position as before. League interest
centred on , the collision of ’Roy ar l < "
’Don. The latter, after making ’Wood shift itself
and beating South, had hopes of capsiz’ng the
Maroons. It put up a mighty scuffle, and led at
half-time, but faded away thereafter, and was ulti-
mately despised and rejected by 54 points to 36. A
mile away, at Richmond, the locals were similarly
trying to upend ’Wood, but they suffer from the same
affliction as ’Don. They mark and kick well, and
half a dozen of them pass to one another with beau-
tiful enthus'asm and precision—but they will rather
lose the ball than pass to certain others of the team.
In a word, they and ’Don are mere associations of
coteries, and they have no hope against an 18 that
plays as one. Richmond held ’Wood up to lemon
time, but after that the Magpies piled on five goals
eight behinds to Richmond’s three behinds—just by
way of “showing what they knew” —and won by
69 to 45. St. Kilda, which wdl be among “the
four” if it can beat Carlton this coming Saturday,
was up against Melbourne, and took no risks. Going
away at the start, it got further ahead as the game
progressed. Ultimately the Saints captured VI
points to Melbourne’s 35. Geelong, whose chance of
the premiership is as dead as last summer’s toadstool,
spread itself in an effort to smother South, just for
the fun of the thing, but retired worsted by 16
points—66 to South’s 82. Carlton had a practice
match, casually scoring 76 points while the Students’
tally was 26. ■ #
The scuffle for places in the Association
“four” continues. The topmost team, ’Scray, hav-
ing been beaten by ’Don, drops to third place, while
’Town, beaten by Brunswick, falls still further arear.
P’ran still grabs ’Wick’s tails, in a manner of speak-
ing, but doesn’t promise to hold on long. The ’Scray-
’Don skirmish was willing and exciting. A ding-
dong game had left ’Scray five points to the good
just as the timekeeper reached for the bell. At that
moment a ’Don man marked, and kicked clear
through the posts, and the “Dreadnoughts” won by a
lone, solitary, unfriended, Robinson Crusoe of a
point. Neither ’Wick nor ’Town can afford to throw
away a game at this stage, so both teams were “all
out” when the riot was over. ’Wick’s system pulled
tit through with 68 points to ’Town’s 39. North, with
an eye to the possibility of gaining the foremost
place' on averages, piled up points against ’Cote —
130 to 51 in all; P’ran, similarly minded, put toge-
ther 115 to Port’s 73 ; and Brighton and the Citi-
zens chased each other round negligently, the former
getting 89 points to the latter’s 55.
Recent sudden sentences of the two tribu-
nals have had a mild effect, the only delinquent last
week being a Southerner, who was retired for three
weeks for using the elbow. Nevertheless some of the
games still show unnecessary “willingness.”^
Sydney baseball soared out of the gutter
of mediocrity on Saturday, and at one bound became
a game full of danger for people with weak nerves
and vaccinat’on hearts to watch. Lane Cove, wear-
ing the whole garment of cocksureness and dressed
in a little brief swelled head, crossed the water and
attacked Waverley on its own bit of mud. Waverley
arose like a giant refreshed with wines, spirits and
mait liquors, and after a fearsome struggle went
under by only five to four. University produced a
profound sensation by slaying Petersham stone dead
on its own doorstep by seven to six. Burwood also
bit the dust to Paddington, by 12 to 11. The
slaughter of the day was the scrunching of Leich-
hardt by Mosman-North Svdney, the figures being 19
to four. The subieet is too painful for comment. So
Lane Cove and Mosman head the competition, with
Leichhardt close up and all the rest of the clubs an
awful way behind.
* * *
Eastern Suburbs’ smashing of Birchgrove
bv 16 goals to two on Saturday makes Sydney lacrosse
competition a sure thing for the former club unless
an earthquake takes place. University surprised
itself by defeating Manly by 14 to nil; as did Syd-
ney, by jumping on Petersham by 17 to eight. Mos-
man treated Burwood to a day of horror by 10 to
two. The competition is now a procession, with
Eastern Suburbs 23 points, Sydney 17, Petersham 15,
Mosman 12, and the rest invisible below the horizon.
N.S.W. Cricket Association Treasurer
A W. Green biffed the question of Sport versus
Defence with both feet last week in this fashion:
“Compulsory training is a national affair, and cricket
is only sport. So cricket will have to shape its
districts to suit the military districts.” It was a
wholesome, common-sense delivery that sounded
extra pleasant and sane after some of the recent
vaporings on the subject. #
Golf hardly knew how popular it was in
Adelaide till the Glenelg club got 86 entries for the
Hvland trophies. Scratch men —Hyland himself, W.
Gunson and A. A. Scarfe. Of those prominent in
other games, polo-expert Law Smith and ex-tennis
champion Baker had the meagre allowance of one
stroke; Clem Hill six. Roy Hill 15, and Taylor
(present tennis champion) 23. The winner was an
unconsidered person with a generous handicap.
Seen at his training quarters in the
luxurious Hotel Brighton, at Botany Bay (N.S.W.),
Matt Wells, the English-Hebrew or Anglo-
Jerusalem boxer who is to meet Mehegan, of Aus-
tralia, at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday (Aug. 9),
looks the ideal man of smite. With magnificent
shoulder development, tremendous depth of chest and
splendidly balanced body and legs, he looks a hazard-
ous proposition. He is as light on his feet as a
feather ; and as quick as it seems possible for a man
to be. His only drawback is an apparent shortness
of reach. His neck is very solid, and he has practi-
callv no chin to uppercut; what passes for such being
a mere bony fortification in the expanse of muscular
neck. Neither has he much top to his head to be
knocked about. Apparently his only vulnerable spot
is his conk. That certainly does invite punishment
by the perky way it sticks out from the centre of
his phvsiognomy. Judging by his sparring, Matthew
has devised a special guard for it and pays particular
attention to his defence, for in spite of most heroic
efforts, not one of his sparring partners managed to
land on it once. “Spagring” is a misnomer as re-
gards 'Wells’ methods. He doesn’t spar —he fights.
He is practising how to hit an opponent, and they
catch it. He doesn’t always put full steam behind
it, but what there is pushing the wallop is generally
more than enough to satisfy the partners. It is
obv-'ous that he has developed from a boxer into a
fighter, and not as most of our Australian fighters
have done. The curse of Australian pugdom is that
most of our men were fighters before they were
boxers, and started to learn boxing, and the finer
points of the game, and the scientific side of the
verb To Biff after they had commenced to earn cash
and glory in the square ring. Wells has evidently
been right through the school first, and learned the
game very thoroughly indeed. On paper, Mehegan
should not last five minutes with him, for, seen in
his gymnasium, Mehegan is very unattractive, and
shows' no knowledge of how to box. But he can
fight, and he seems to have evolved a system of
defence all his own that puzzles his opponents and
generally proves just as effective, ugly as it is, as
the most perfect scientific method. Another thing is
his terrific appetite for punishment. He thrives on
what would half-kill another fighter. The scrap on
Saturday week should be the most interesting fought
in the Stadium up to date, not excepting even the
Burns-Squires and the Burns-Johnson riots. Also, it
should leave a better taste in the mouth than either
of those historic combats. When Wells meets Owen
Moran, now on the water en route for Sydney, our
London visitor has to get down to 9st. 71b. at 2 p.m.
the afternoon of the upheaval.
* * * *
Another unpopular decision at the Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night brought down a storm
of disapprobation on the unfortunate head of referee
Scott. Englishman Stagg was scrapping with Wes-
tralian Morey. When at the end of the full term
Scott placed his hand on Morey and adjudged him
the victor there was a moment of breathless silence,
and then pandemonium broke loose. They didn’t hoot
—they howled. On Sunday and Monday mornings
Scott found the Fourth Estate was also against him.
Morey was much the stronger of the two, and also
the more aggressive; but Stagg was the better boxer
and too elus ve. Only once did the rushing Aus-
tralian manage to floor him. It looked as though
he would repeat the deed again and again, but Stagg
wasn’t there. He fought a running fight. He
was mostly in retreat, using his stern-chasers, so to
speak. And that fact was what Scott probably based
his decision on. This writer is under the impression
that nether of them deserved a verdict, and that
both should have been disqualified for palming and
hanging on. No doubt Scott could, if he were foolish
enough, give very good reasons for his decision; for
when a fight goes the full time and has to be decided
on points, the giving of points is l ; ke punctuation,
largely a matter of opinion and taste. The referee
takes the place of luck—the luck that gives one
man, often the inferior boxer, the victory by a
knock-out. How often have we seen a man bashed
and walloped for a dozen rounds come with a sudden
rush and win on a knock-out! It is manifestly unfair
on the part of Fortune—but it is the luck. In a
points-battle the referee is the luck. And he is,
therefore, entitled to do strange things.
* * * *
On Tuesday morning Referee Scott gave
his reasons for awarding Saturday night’s contest to
Morey. He considered the Westralian punched
harder and cleaner than Stagg. Morey wai*
the aggressor most of the time. Morey
blocked many of Stagg’s punches, which, from
a distance, would appear to land. Also, many of
Stagg’s punches, when they did land, were nothing
worse than mere taps. He had warned Stagg for
using the elbow and shoulder and other ancient
tricks, and as he did not disqualify him he counted
the objectionable practices against Stagg in the
final arrangement of points. In spite of the demon-
stration of the public and the opinion of the press
he would give the same decision again, the only one
his conscience would allow him to give.

ANOTHER INJUSTICE TO WOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Lady-Sport writes indignantly to the Melbourne
ARGUS as follows: — , „ . , . , ..
I, in company with a lady friend, visited the
V AT C meeting on Saturday, and, wishing to invest
a "few shillings of my own money, imagine my
chagrin when several members of the ring refused to
accept my bet. They said that it would mean the
cancellation of their license, and a prosecution to
follow, and that if I wanted a bet I would have to
ask some gentleman to take the wager for me. I his
meant that I would have to force an introduction
upon a strange man, a proceeding not very ladylike.
Oh, pity the sorrows of affluent Joan —
Give heed to her moan !
Who’s never permitted to punt “on her own,’’
Whose “oof’’ can't be “blown.”
Imagine her chagrin—the poor, ill-used pet
She’ll fume and she’ll fret.
She has money to burn and they won’t let her bet
Or get into debt!
Injustice! yea verily, though she has tin
The “books” only grin,
When she would invest it: a shame and a sin
She can’t “do it in.”
Degrading to have to ask men —strangers too—
“ Take this shilling, you
And back So-and-so with that leather-lunged Jew.
And bring back what’s due.”
All interest goes .when you can’t “spot” a “gee”
And back it S.P.
Deny Joan a “flutter” with her £.s.d. —
Why, V.A.T.C. ?
I shouldn’t at all be surprised soon to note
That ladies who dote
On a wager will cry: “Down with bookies! We vote
They give us the Tote!”

A skilful Boxer is a man to be envied and
admired.
He has himself under complete control. He
has been taught to be patient and tolerant.
He is not easily “put out,” and usually is
the last to seek a Quarrel.
When he is forced, however, to defend him-
self, he does it with a quiet calm that
breathes self-confidence in his every action.
He is not flurried in the least. He has a set
plan and adapts himself to circumstances. He
reserves his strength until the other fellow
is getting groggy. He is always doing the
right thing at the right time.

last week, aged 75 years, was almost a
Sydney native, having been brought here
by his parents in 1840, when but two years
oid. He was apprenticed to Thomas Clay-
ton, of Castlereagh-street, to learn “the arts
of wood engraving and letterpress printing,”
and at 20 years of age was in business for
himself. He founded and published many
magazines and newspapers, was a well-
known figure in all R.C. demonstrations, and
represented Mudgee in the Legislative As-
sembly of the ’7o’s. Some 20 years ago
he took the steady job of Chief Clerk
to the Hunter District Water Supply and
Sewerage Board, and clung to it until his
retirement about three years ago.
“Bobstay” : Imported Commander Brewis,
R.N., having declined the billet of Common-
wealth Lighthouse Director, the job goes to
one Ramsbotham, of Westralia, a less recent
importation. He has been in Australia three
years, having been originally captured
abroad to build a dock. By trade he is an
engineer. If Brewis, a naval deck officer,
was the right choice in the first place, it is
curious that a longshoreman should get
preference. The selection of Rams-
botham has grieved several Australian sailor
men, who looked on this luxurious billet as
a safe anchorage from the unstable
tracks where that old heathen, Davy Jones,
rageth at the morning star.

The Bishop of Bath and Wells writes: “The
value of Formamint as a preventive is
appreciated in this house.”
The Archdeacon of Bristol writes: “I habitually
carry Wulfing’s Formamint with me as a
preventive of Sore Throat.”
The Earl of Kilmorey writes : “lam glad to give
my testimony to the soothing and curauve
effects of your potent remedy— Formamint*
with which lam so familiar. As is my
constant practice, I keep one of your brown
bottles on my dressing table.”
How to Avoid Infectious Diseases.
Do you realise that most of the dangerous infectious
diseases, such as Diphtheria, Consumption, Influenza, Scarlet
Fever, Measles and the like, are caused by germs which gain
entrance to the body through the mouth and throat ?
The minute living organisms which produce such diseases
grow and develop like the seeds of plants, and the mouth and
throat form an ideal hot-house for cultivating them.
The scientist, of course, can grow them outside the body,
artificially. For example, a test-tube culture of the germs
which cause Consumption is depicted here ; and also a bottle
of Wulfing’s Formamint—the means which Science has found
to destroy such germs in the mouth and throat, and so protect
us against the diseases which they breed.

Formamint
THB CERM'KILLING THROAT TABLET
These harmless and palatable tablets contain the most
powerful destroyer of disease germs known to Science. They
dissolve in the saliva, and the disinfectant is thus carried to
every little crevice, chink, or cranny in the mouth, gums,
tonsils and throat. Thus all germ growths are sought out and
destroyed, their spread is checked, their power to do harm is
entirely broken.
As a preventive of infectious disease, Formamint Tablets
should be used daily by everyone, in health or sickness, and
they are particularly recommended for school children, who
are so exposed to infection, especially at this time of the year.
Beware, however, of harmful imitations ; there is only one
genuine Formamint, viz. and all Chemists sell it at
2s. 6d. per bottle. The manufacturers, A. Wulfing & Co.,
17, Bond Street, Sydney, N.S.W., will gladly send you a Free
Sample and an interesting Booklet, if you write to them,
mentioning this paper, and enclose two penny stamps toward*
postage.
A New York story re the first announcement of
“Milestones” in that city. The typical Boston girl,
bursting with culchaw, looked up at the electric sign
over the theatre and burbled aesthetically: “At last
a Greek play! Mi-les-to-nes !”
“Theodosia Chamboissier” is now painted on the
front of the Savoy Hotel, in Market-street, Sydney.
Thus does an old-time favorite, Miss Docy Stewart,
daughter of Mr. Richard Stewart and sister of Sweet
Nell” make her reappearance in public. Her hus-
band, the previous licensee of the place, died
recently.
From London: Ethel Irving is having no luck since
her return from Australia. The two plays on winch
she relied failed, and now the revival of her greatest
success, “Lady Frederick,” has fallen to pieces and
been takeii off abruptly at the Globe. “On the advice
of her doctor” the lady herself has left . r
Switzerland. She proposes to next try her luck m
an American piece, “Years of Discretion.”
“Umfaan”: Not lately mentioned, I think, that
11. P. Lyons, the recently-deceased doyen of the
“advance” profession, got his first rise by answering
Blondin’s advertisement in Australia for a man to
be carried on the rope-walker’s back. He applied
and was duly carried. Blondin liked his burden and
hadn’t gone far before he made a manager of him;
and from that on “H.P.” carried other men on his
back.
King George having commanded “London Assur-
ance” to be performed in the presence of himself
and the family, Dion Boucicault delved into his
father’s papers to discover the history of that first
of Daddy Dion’s numerous succcesses as a play-
wright ; and he fished up some good material. While
still a schoolboy of 12 in Dublin, Dion wrote a
play, “The Old Guard,” which was later on produced
at London Princess. At 16 he came to London to
work on a suburban railway. There and then he
wrote a one-act piece, and sent it to Charles
Mathews, at that time in the height of his fame as
a light comedian at Covent Garden. Mathews read
it, and saw opportunities for himself m a character
called Daggle. Sending for the author, his eyes
opened when a slim lad of 16 came in When he
had recovered from his amazement, Mathews asked
the marvellous boy to expand it into three or four
acts, and, in particular, to work up the character of
Daggle. Young Dion hammered at the lob, and in
30 days “London Assurance” was handed over to
Mathews complete, and promptly put into rehearsal.
Dion immediately wrote to his mother m Dublin to
tell her of his good fortune. Mathews had paid him
£3OO for it, and had entered into contracts th
him for three other dramas —making £ll5O in ail.
From London: As Edward Knoblanch is the author
of “Kismet” and the joint manufacturer of “Mile-
stones,” much interest centred in the production of
his new plav at the Prince of Wales’s. It is called
“The Faun,” and is derived from Pagan mythology
—a daring blend of the long ago with the present.
But it falls between the two stools, and is a dis-
appointment. The story begins with Lord Stonbury,
who owes £70,000. Being unable to pay, he is
about to blow his brains out. At that moment a
faun jumps out of the geraniums in his garden.
Between the two a bargain is struck. The faun
will enable Stony to recover his losses by giving him
racing tips, and Stony in turn will introduce the
animal into London Society as Prince Silvain. rarci-
cal complications ensue. Martin Harvey scored a
personal success as the faun, but the piece is too
heavily handicapped to be a stayer.
“Booshee”: Personally, I shall always like to re-
member Jimmy Williamson, the actor, rather than J.
C. Williamson, the manager. Since he first played John
■Stofel in “Struck Oil,” several of our best men have
tried the part; but, though they had Williamsons
performance to work upon, none of them ever got
within coo-ee of the original. His Rip Van Winkle
didn’t suffer by comparison with Joe Jefferson s, and
his Shaun o’ the Post was quite as good as Bouci-
cault’s, for what it lacked in drollery it made up in
power and pathos. And then his performance of
Sandy in “The Danites” —full of simple pathos and
rugged strength! His Kerry, too, was a splendid
old-man impersonation, though when Williamson
first played it he was quite young. He gave sterling
performances, also, in “The Old Curiosity Shop,
“Fritz,” “The Fairy Circle,” “Shadows of a Great
City,”’ and several other pieces produced at the Mel-
bourne and Sydney theatres. Altogether, when the
office” claimed him, the stage lost a very valuable
actor indeed in Williamson.
“Archie” : I knew the late Harry Lyons very well.
I first met him in 1889, when he was advance agent
for George Crichton Miln, the Shakspearian trage-
dian, who had all the characteristics of the “go o
his adopted Chicago, and none of the accent of that
delectable metropolis of potted calf. Miln left the
accent to his wife, Miss Louise Jordan, who had a
native twang of wonderful pneumatic pressure, and
who played Cleopatra to Miln’s Antony in the weird
English of Arizona Bill. Harry Lyons had a quaint
horror of all silvertail social functions, which he
called “blanky gilt-edged frills,” and could never
be induced to reeeive the gubernatorial party on
command nights. Miln, on such occasions, would
say to the present scribe: “Harry is looking for you.
He’s hiding in the front office. He’s quite ready and
willing to show his Nibs and party to the vice-regal
box; but he says that if there’s any blanky patter
to be done, Archie’s got to do it’ r a !V. Archie
invariably did. Harry was great on billing, and
could not conceive why Shakspearian drama shouldn t
be as flamboyantly pictured as his earliest love, the
circus, with all its gorgeous spangles and its seduc-
tive sawdust. During the Miln season he lived in
Princess-street, a short court, with half a dozen
highly-respectable houses in it, off Simpson s-road.
There, on Sunday night, he used to entertain right
royally. Besides Harry and Mrs. Lyons, and his
clever step-daughter Katey, there were wont to fore-
gather Mesmerist Kennedy and his wife. Miss
Maggie Stewart, and her sister Docy (Mrs. H Har-
wood), and the latter’s husband, Geo. C., and Mrs.
Miln, and a splendid big man who sang in the Yeo-
man of the Guard,” then running at the Melbourne
Princess’s Theatre. The last-mentioned was always
accompanied by his wife, a handsome brunette of
Minerva’s proportions and lofty stature. Hubby was
not a musician by training, and could not read music
from the score; but his wife taught him every part
for which he was fitted by his fine voice, by playing
his songs, etc., over with one hand. I have, un-
fortunately, forgotten his name. Lyons was a short,
roley-poley sort of man, with a moustache ageing to
grey, and an otherwise clean-shaven face. He was
immensely proud of Katey, his step-daughter, and
when 1 last met him, a few years ago, and he had
grown a Yankee goatee, he told me, broken-heart-
edly, of her death during a dramatic tour. He was
a wonderfully good-hearted, kindly-natured little
Hebrew showman, and belonged to the davs when
the world was wide, and men like the late G. B. W.
Lewis were the kings of the Australian circus-earth.
St. Peter and King George the Fifth—across the
centuries the twain meet in quite
fashion. At the cinematograph film of Q u °
in the last scene of the series, Peter and an attendant
are quitting Rome with a celerity matched m history
only by the evacuation of Moscow by the Russians
on the approach of Napoleon. The Saviour appears
in spectral guise, and asks “Whither goest thou?
and Peter turns back to Rome. Hidden voices then
chant “The Rock of Ages and other sacred strains.
Black out; and the orchestra strikes , ’
and the effigy of George V. concludes the Christian
tragedy. £
Genee, well-read in the history and literature of
her artistic craft, explains that Hie comparat vely
long skirt worn in “Les Sylphides, the latest ballet
at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), is a facsimile of the
Taadioni skirt. Taglioni was contemporary with
Chopin. The ballet is danced to a seiection of his
music, and his Spirit is supposed to set the sylphs m
motion. The short, starchy muslin environments that
bedecked Catherine Bartho of yore were in the
fashion that old playgoers associate nowadays with
the columbine of the obsolete panto harlequinade.
The 'abbreviated teetotum skirt has its charms for
legolators, but as a tone dressing, so to speak, it is
non-Chopinesque, anyhow.
The late Armes Beaumont made his first big effort
as an oratorio soloist at the Christmas Festival of
the Geelong (Vic.) Philharmonic Society in 1860,
when Geelong was a town of fargerreati ve import-
ance than nowadays. Amelia Bailey (who survive,
as Mrs R S. Smythe) was the peerless soprano of
the" period. John Cook, a lad in St. Peter s choir
took the music for contralto, and John Hmchcbff was
the basso. These four principals, together with
Bvron Moore, who conducted (the orchestra and
chorus were 250 strong),
20 years apiece. On the evidence of Byron Moore—-
who was lately questioned re Reaumont s firstj-ender-
ing of all the tenor solos in The Messiah it ap
nears that the trick of screwing his mouth edge
wavs was habitual with Australia’s King of Song,
even in his youth. It suited him to put his lips that
way, and he never troubled to conquer the mann
ism.
Hactors, proverbially the most modest and mag-
nanimous of creatures where their own and their
rivals’ merits are concerned, will be interested in the
following letters. The originals are in the possession
of Mr. Frank Fraser, who is just now visiting Aus-
tralia: -nig Hope, Friday Night.
Dear Ban, —I have just been playing with that in-
fernal ass and would-be-actor Macready. His con-
ceit and insolence is insuferable. I would like to
strip him of his plumes. I despise such popinjay
stuff from a fifth-rate player. Come over here and
see me to-morrow evening.
Thine always, Edmund Kean.
If Ban went over, as desired, he doubtless got full
details of Macready’s awful incompetency from the
other illustrious mummer. The next letter is from
a notoriously majestic lady to her even more majestic
brother: — _ , . ~ „
Bath, April 2.
Dear John, —I wish you could run down here for
a week. It would recruit your own health, and
perhaps cheer Mr. Siddons up a little. I think
and our medical adviser also thinks, or I am much
mistaken—that it is a case past hope. 0 John, fond
brother and sister as we have been, and are associ-
ated in manv a theatrical struggle, which (d.v.) has
culminated in a glorious professional triumph that
has made the Kemble Family illustrious , uear
John, whom I love as Volumnia loved her son, don t
forget or neglect me in this crisis. I have children,
but I should like to have you and your noble coun-
tenance sympathising with us in this misfortune.
Mr. Siddons has of late frequently asked after you,
and has sometimes, not like me, bitterly regretted
the fame you have so justly and so honorably
acquired, because it makes you, or compels you, to
absent yourself from those who love and esteem you.
Will you come, then ? Rest on your laurels. Take a
flower or so from the wreath and spend it with your
ever affectionate sister.
Sakah Siddons.
To Mr. John P. H. Kemble, Drury Lane Theatre.
(P.S. —Mr. Bowden will carry this to you.—S.S.)
“J.F.H.” (from London): There are now five
theatrical knights —six if we include Pinero, who
was acting before he became a dramatist. Bancroft
is the senior, and after him come Tree, Hare, Alex-
ander and Forbes-Robertson, the last of whom got
his brand at the beginning of June while in the last
week of his farewell season at Drury Lane. “Forby,”
as his brother pros, call him, has made a fortune
out of Jerome’s “Passing of the Third Floor Back,”
and so is in the happy position of being able to
retire into private life at the comparatively early
age of 60. Although he is finishing up with the
English stage, a long American tour will fill up the
greater part of next year, and after that “there is
just a possibility that I will cross the Pacific and
spend six months in Australia and Maoriland.”
“E.T.”: Talk of the Gilbert-Sullivan era reminds
me that Gilbert, of all people, is the author of a
children’s book —the “Pinafore Picture Book.” It
is the story of “H.M.S. Pinafore,” in polite language
suitable (more or less) for the young. The only
fault I find with the beautifully got-up volume is
that the writer is not also the illustrator. Pictures
from his pencil —a la his inimitable “Bab” draw-
ings—would have been just the thing. However,
it appeals as a most amusing experiment. Some of
the words of the songs have been slightly altered
for the occasion. For instance, the world-famed
“Big, Big D” of the original “book” would never
have done. So the captain sings:
Bad language or abuse
I never, never use
Whatever the emergency:
“How tiresome!” I may
Occasionally say,
But I never use a big, big B!
To which the delightful Gilbert appends a footnote:
“He meant ‘Bother’ I—a1 —a vulgar expression that only
the strongest provocation can excuse.”
“X.P.D.”: Every moving picture of an alleged
military nature I have ever seen (bar the scenes
from manoeuvres, etc.) has been utterly wrong in
details. The “star” of a show the wife took me to
a few days ago was supposed to be plotted on the
American Civil War. A little Australian cadet who
was with us remarked on the fact that alleged
troops, with the enemy almost on top of them,
stayed in front of their earthworks to fire. When
an officer came on anywhere all hands adjacent per-
formed the super’s version of a salute, instead of the
senior man only saluting. A despatch announcing
the General’s intentions was read aloud in presence
of privates, a prisoner from the opposition camp,
who still wore his sword, the prisoner’s best girl,
etc. Men blazed away at 20 yards’ range without
more than one in ten getting laid out. Cavalry
attacked entrenched infantry, who then scooted.
But this is not the only idiocy of these poor picture
showmen. I remember only one set of Australian
views in many years of picture-going. At Bunda-
berg, alongside sugar mills that put through thou-
sands of tons a week, I was regaled with pictures
of the sugar industry in some nigger place where
tired colored persons were shown putting up cane
in little bundles to hump to the mill. It was
roared at, of course, but it was only one of thou-
sands just as absurd.
At a sketch exhibition held by a body of artists
of the milder growth in one Australian metropolis
the worst picture of an uncommonly poor lot was a
travesty of a mauve cow ruminating in a blue atmo-
sphere and in the presence of a large lemon-yellow
moon. This picture had a neat little lavender tag
suspended under it, on which was written: Noc*
turne, £3.” Two envious artists of an opposing
organisation, seeing the picture., marvelled at the
unique incompetence of it. They decided that so
admirable an example of the worst possible was too
dirt cheap at the price, and one of them waggishly
faked the*tag, so that it read “Nocturne, £33. mak-
ing the contemplative cow the most expensive ani-
mal in the show. Then thev went about, advertis-
ing their naughtv joke, and there was much private
sniggering over the pretty conceit, until presently
the jesters discovered a red tag on the nocturn. A
plump brewer had written out his cheque at the table,
and secured the nocturn for £33. Nothmg would
do for him, but the best, he said. The sketch was
sold, but not so wofully sold as the jesters.
A MATTER OF NOMENCLATURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mrs. Lillian Nordica has arrived in Sydney.
—News item
To me a standing puzzle this is:
Are you Madame, or merely Missis?
Tell me, thou Songstress in a million,
Do you pronounce your first name Lillian?
Or may one side-step Censure’s ban
By rhyming it with Mary Ann ?
Can we, O most melodious shrieker,
Mention that we have heard Nordica?
And do they ignorance betray
That speak of you as Nordica?
What of your bond-slaves, near and far,
Who blither about Nordica ?
’Neath every concert-goer’s hat
Lurk carking doubts. Small wonder that
One hears alike in Hall and Hut:
“Give me a name like Clara Butt.”

Pedicus: Vigorous: but that ground
was ploughed and harrowed only a few months ago.
Wager: Latest tally of passengers who use Flin-
ders-street (Melb.) station was in November, 1911;
including Princes Bridge, practically part of the same
station, the figures then were 165,997. The numbers
have since increased, but no count has been made.
Latest reliable figures for Liverpool-streetf London iter-
minus of the Great Eastern railway refer to nothing
more modern than 1904, when the station was re-
ported to have a daily traffic of 176,750 passengers.
No trustworthy figures as to Cannon-street station
can be dug up from the literature available in the
various railway institutes. .. .Assisted Immigrant:

assumption that the tightening of the bank s grip on

Years ago a famous actor on
The route to his abode
Was waylaid in the gloomy darkness
And murdered on the road
Grim robbery was the motive
The body was found at morn
Gore smeared and mutilated
And his precious jewels were gone
Baffled were the Detectives
Of our Victorian clime
To unveil the ghastly incident
Of mystery and crime.
The collins st awful murder
Was another tragedy of renown
Done to death was a diamond merchant
In the art of melbourne town
His corpse was discovered at twilight
Outstretched on the office floor
A pile of jewels were missing
And place bedabbled with gore
Baffled were the officers of justice
Of our Victorian clime
To unveil the horrid incident
Of mystery and crime.

Mortise in One Stroke.
NO preliminary boring, no driving or cleaning out of
cores, no splinters on face of mortise, no jar to the
operator. There are no burst mortises, as no strain
is put on the timber. Stuff as thin as §in. can have a iin
mortise put in with safety. '
The SAGAR Chain and Hollow Chisel Mortiser is for
general mortising in hard or soft woods, and dees its work
at a SPEED, ACCURACY and FINISH quite beyond the
conception of those who are only familiar with the other
type of Mortising Machines.
THE CUTTING is done by means of a steel chain, each
link of which has a sharp tooth, so formed as to bring out
its own chippings.
For making mortises smaller than lRn. long, the chain-cutter is not
so convenient; a hollow chisel having a revolving bit inside is used.
This chisel cuts its own size rapidly, and discharges the core at the
same time. Any size or length of mortise can be cut, from Rn. square.

The Best Saddle in Australia
for the Stockman
The Famous NATURAL Aperient Water
-£6llOl-
We have been making Paddles for close on half a century—and
all we know about the game has gone into the making of this
famous Stock Saddle of ours. It is hand-made throughout—no
cheap and nasty machine work anywhere. It is built on the
staunchest tree of specially tempered steel, fitted with an
unbreakable gulletplate, to which are riveted (not screwed, mind
you) solid steel hind crupper plates. This makes the tree
absolutely unbreakable, yet gives just the elasticity and f'give”
needed. The seat is made of specially tanned bag leather, with
very long, thick harness leather flaps, that .do away with the
need of wearing leggings. There are leather points to the panel, that will
not wear out for the whole life of the saddle. The knee pads are 5J inches
high, and made of solid leather, double sewn inside so that they won’t sag
or give over. The thigh pads are made in the same way and li inches
high. We have the seats with as high a dish as 6 inches, but any lower
dish you want we can give you: The mountings are brass and nickel, and
the Dees are fastened so securely that no tug will strain them. The panel
is serge lined, and with extended facings so as not to fray or wear out by
the rubbing of the swag or tucker gear. The saddle is sold fitted with
fold or split leather girths, 4 bar irons, stirrup leathers, ring or ordinary
crupper and surcingle.
OUR GUARANTEE.—Any number of these saddles of ours sold ten years
ago are in use to-day and practically as good,as new. No stauncher saddle
could be made. The one you buy from us we will guarantee for two years.
If within that time the saddle proves faulty in material or workmanship, if
you return it to us, we will give you a new saddle in place of it free of
charge. If a saddle lasts two years it will last as long as it is cared for
—though of course no saddle will stand being rolled on or being bumped
against a tree.

Loans, and a Dago Example.
Deab Bulletin, —Holman, Watt, Denham
and Peake —in fact, all the reigning
tribe of Australian borrowers and would-be
borrowers —seem to think that their States
are the only lOU’s in Cohenville, but they
aren't. The other day Peake returned from
the Bondfields in London and said that his
“mission” had been a failure. (The mission
was orie calculated to hit Mr. Bull Cohen
under the fifth mortgage.) Next, the Ma
State Ministry (if Such a dreadful body can
be called a Ministry) wailed that all was
lost, as the banks l ad shut down on it, and
the railways and other perishable and often
most unproductive works would have to “go
slow” —-with an election in plain view, too !
Then, William Watt came back and hit
Fremantle with a despairing yell to the
effect that in London ( and Paris) there
were mighty few millions left on the Bond-
fields, and that Victoria could raise only
about two-thirds of what it wanted, and that
at a sinful rate. Certainly, from the per-
sistent and shameless way in which our
politicians “go on the market” nowadays,
one might well believe that their attitude
of being the only pawners in the shop was
correct, but one would be wrong. In the
London papers last May, amid a horde of
“small fry,” ranging from £500.000 wanted
for the Coppertart (Canada) Tin Mines to
£2.500,000 for a new railway in Ecuador,
there appeared a flotation of £11,000,000 for
the Republic of Brazil. The loan was
offered Bull-Cohen at 5 per cent; price £97 ;
long terms (some months) in which to “spar
up,” and a dividend of 2i per cent, next
October. Also, tagged on to the conditions,
appeared this (to an Australian politician)
hair-raising proviso:—“ The loan will be re-
deemed by an accumulative Sinking Fund of
1 per cent, per annum, to be applied half-
yearly by purchase of Bonds when the price
is under par, and when at or above par by
drawings." The sinking fund starts next
September, and in about 1/1 years the
£11,000,000 Loan will be wiped out auto-
matically, but, just to show its independence,
the Brazilian Government adds “the Govern-
ment reserves the right to redeem the whole
or any portion of the Loan at any time on
giving six months’ notice.” Brazil. I may
add, is no slouch of a country, anyhow. It
has an area of 3,290,564 square miles, and
what we should call its “great natural re-
sources” are of incredible vastness. It has
pretty .well every metal known to the banks
and the jewellers; also to the ironmongers.
It has coal, coffee, wheat and timber by the
million tons. It has the most amazing
water-system in creation, and the fertility
of its soil is equal to that of Canada at its
best, while the climate runs the entire ther-
mometrical gamut. Certainly, Brazil has a
foreign debt of about £96.000.000. but it has
also a population of about 24.000,000, and
a total trade (imports and exports) of more
than £75.000.000 (1932 figures), with un-
limited possibilities of extension. It has,
too. what decent Australians are praying
for nightly—a Sinking Fund Department, or
caixa da amortisacao —so that when its
Senor Olmanino or the Hon. Arturo
Griffitinas raises a few millions in Lon-
don, ■ that great paymaster, Time, comes
along and removes their bones and their
loans together. What: chance lias Ma. or
Victoria, or “South ’Orse” of getting J.-B.
Cohen by the ear with offers of 44 per cent,
loans at £9B. cash on the nail, and no sink-
ing fund: also with a staggering debt (with-
out sinking funds!, when countries like this
South American giant are in, or on, or round,
or adjacent to that quaint feature of the
Bondfields, the “market”? —Yours truly,
O. C. Carot.

Vaccinators or Bushwhackers?
The New South Wales Health Department
is a strange and illogical feature of Syd-
ney’s small-pox epidemic. It has been
stamnedins' the public to the vaccination
booths, while casually announcing to the
newspapers that it wasn’t sure whether
there would be any lymph until to-morrow,
or next week, or sometime. Mostly, it told
the harassed private practitioner, whose
house was besieged with regular customers,
that he might as well apply for a pint of
black opals as for a dozen tubes of anti-pox.
Early in the rush of branding the moh, it
became clear that something was radically
wrong with the system. Stories of violent
sufferings by patients began to circulate—
many of them exaggerated, but more than
enough of them true. Instead of taking
such steps as would reassure the disturbed
mind of tens of thousands of waverers, the
Department made a few good-natured
statements to the effect that: (1) nobody
was being hurt more than was usual when
a trifling scratch was made with a vacci-
nation needle; (2) anybody who felt
particularly aggrieved should rub the sore
place with tincture of iodine. Somewhere
about this time a local authority. D’’ H.
Tebbutt. Chief Resident Pathologist at the
Prince Alfred Hospital, arose and opined
that the public was being savaged by some
vaccinators; and, on the available evidence,
that was the truth of the matter. But the
Health Department made no satisfactory
reply. As a matter of fact, it had none to
make. It knew it was employing raw
medical recruits at some of the suburban
vaccination depots. It had so contemptuous
an opinion of some of the operators that it
offered to pay them a whole 30s. (£1 10s.)
for an afternoon’s work. If it wasn’t con-
tempt for the ability of these innior
medicoes fhat prompted that altitudinous
fee. then the" Department is a sweater from a
professional point of view, and a brother to
“The Song of the Shirt.” It can take its
choice. One day recently the number of
citizens who underwent public vaccination
dropped to 922 as compared with 2295 on
the previous day and 4898 on the day be-
fore that. The chief of the Health Depart-
ment ascribed this extraordinary break-away
to the wet weather. But if he knew how
many people were spreading the glad tidings
of internal agonies (and “agonies” is a
fair interpretation) and unduly swollen
arms, .suffered by themselves or relatives
and friends, he would hunt up some other
explanation. This protest, or plain curse,
it should be explained, is made by a strong
advocate for vaccination, but there are occa-
sions when vaccination is overdone. The
present occasion appears to be one of them.
When Premier Holman’s Compulsory Vac-
cination Bill comes down an opportunity
gapes for a Select Committee of Inquiry,
whereby some errors of the past few weeks
may be illuminated for future avoidance.

IN
BANANA LAND
The cheeky, destructive little house
sparrow has now found his way as far
north as Central Queensland. This year
hundreds of him are to be seen about Rock-
hampton, where they were never known
before. It has taken him 50 years to get
up that far, having been scared off hitherto
by wild reports regarding the destructiveness
of the climate. But now that the scientist
and the statist have had a chance to be
heard, he has taken courage and fluttered
north, and finds the pickings splendid.
Botanist Bailey is still going strong in
Bananaland with 80 summers behind him.
Eight years ago the relentless retrencher
of the day went to the old man and told
him that he would have to get out, and thus
assist in saving the country from bankruptcy
or something of that sort. Bailey threw
back his spectacles, lifted up the eyelid
which droops, and declined to get out.
“What do I care for salary !” he Said. “I
am the Botanist of Queensland, appointed
legally, and the Botanist of Queensland I
intend to remain, pay or no pay.” And re-
main he did. The present Government is
inviting the Government Printer to turn
out a tastefully-bound cony of the veteran’s
work on the flora of Queensland for the
nurpose of arousing the interest of George
Rex in the work of the venerable scientist.
Concerning Queensland’s new “white”
industry:—
Now that the final figures are made up, it is seen
that last season was one of the worst the State has
ever had in the sugar business—-just as this season
promises to be one of the best. Dry weather reduced
the crop in some districts to starvation; thus the
total cane crushed in the Mackay district was only
195,738 tons as against 376,975 tons in 1911, and
462,259 tons in 1910. Still, there is this advantage
about a sugar crop: the lighter it is, as a rule, the
better it goes for sugar, wherefore it took only
12.72 tons of cane to make a ton of crystals last
year, while it took no less than 19.45 tons in the
bumper year 1910. As an average, in a good year
Queensland can grow nearly 2 j tons of sugar to the
acre; in a bad year like 1912 a trifle under 14 tons.
Practically the industry is all “white” now: as to
only 54 tons in every 100 had the Chow or the
Kanaka any hand in the business. And there is
room for a heap of expansion yet. Australia can
suck up just on 44 million cwt. per annum —the
Australian man, woman and child averages an almost
exact cwt. a year—and last year the total home pro-
duction was only 2,605,200 cwt. The imports were
then larger, of course, than usual —Australia sup-
plied very little more than half its own require-
ments —but even in an average year there is a market
here for another 25 per cent, more than it at pre-
sent produces. The Commonwealth has been told
pretty often that it is very stupid to encourage the
white man to go into the business, because he can’t
possibly compete with the loafing nigger who per-
vades the sugar fields and mills in Java and else-
where ; but it isn’t yet a question of competing with
the loafing nigger in the open markets of the world
—-it’s a question simply of supplying the full require-
ments of a market which Australia controls abso-
lutely, and can open or shut just as it pleases.
Crawford’s motion in the Assembly in
favor of a 70 jer cent, rise in members’
salaries was defeated by the smallest
majority that can be a majority—the figure
that is length without breadth, and which
stands up like the thin edge of a shadow.
Thereupon the House looked as cheerful as
a bilious undertaker. There was plainly a
ma turity in favor of the rise; but several
members, when out vote-catching before the
last elections, had let their tongues run them
into a gratuitous promise to oppose the in-
famy. How were they to know that Craw-
ford was going to actually propose the extra
payment? His silence was most inconsid-
erate of the man.
With one exception, the Denham Minis-
ters are good attendants when the House is
in session. “Jimmy” Blair is the exception.
It would hardly be libellous to say that he
never attends. If a Ministerial absentee
tax were imposed, he would be liable for
about 80 per cent, of it. As a rule it is
only when he has a Bill in hand that he
condescends to sit in the Chamber, among
the crowd he opposed with such absurd fury
less than three years ago. The most con-
sistent Minister in attendance is Paget, of
the Railways. He rarely misses a sitting,
and, moreover, is there when the House
rises as well as when it opens with prayer,
whereas even when Blair does put in an
appearance, be mostly quits after a brief
survey of the premises.
BY PROXY.
MR. MEEKS : “Is that the dog that attacked my wife?"
OWNER: “I don’t believe she was touched."
MR. MEEKS: “Oh, yes. She was bitten badly."
O WNER: “I don’t admit anything. I won't pay a penny."
MR. MEEK S: “Ok, no—you don’t understand. I was wondering if you could Jet me
have a pup."
In Brisbane the other day a man who was
cleaning windows on the top-storey of an
outfitter’s saw the display of bank-clerks'
socks or something, and incontinently fell
through the skylight. He plunged through
half an inch of glass and a wire-netting
screen as if they were an Australian tariff,
and landed on one Murphy, who was on the
footpath. The window-cleaner’s injuries in-
cluded a contused head, concussion, a broken
knee and bruised arms. Murphy, the in-
voluntary recipient of 1501 b. of meteoric
flesh, merely had his hands cut and his walk
interrupted. One of the crying needs of
every civilised country is a law to make
people who fall on other people responsible
for the damage. Many years ago, in Paris,
a girl who had been disappointed in love
got to the top of what was then the city’s
tallest monument, and threw herself over
about 4 a.m. She suffered very little in-
jury, but the homeward-bound printer o.n
whom she fell was killed, the spot. His
luck was worse than Murphy’s.
“Itan” from the North :
The Butter Magnate and his Government lost con-
trol of the business of Bananaland Assembly the
other evening. The Railways Bill, a measure which
does little more than consolidate, was met by a
drastic amendment from the leader of the Opposi-
tion, who moved that all railway proposals in
future be sent along to a board of experts for in-
quiry. Digby D. at once moved the adjournment of
the debate, 'unluckily for the Government, the next
item was the Great Western Railways Bill, which
proposes to deviate the route of the transcontinental
line from that laid down by the Act passed two
rears ago. This vW.v measure showed how necessary
it is to create a responsible body to sift the pros
and cons of such proposals before they go to the
House. The fact is that the Government of the day,
headed by Kidston, was so determined to anticipate
the real transcontinental line between Oodnadatta
and Pine Creek that it dashed into this proposal
recklessly in the hope that it would stay Fishers
hand. It knew so little about the route that the
Government was empowered to place the line in
any part of a track 50 miles wide. Denham now
wanted power to place it in any part of a strip of
land 100 miles wide, with no evidence on hand bar
the report of the Railway Commissioner who was
supposed to have motored over part of this amazingly
broad road at some time or another. The House, on
both sides, showed teeth and nails, and the Govern-
ment readily consented to the deviation question
being sent on to a select committee with instructions
to find out a few' things about it —as to whos
stations and squattages it crossed and the towns it
touched and so on. It will probably be long de-
ferred in any case. Few people are now prepare’
to defend the cantankerous undertaking, which could
oacHv become Bananaland’s hungriest public work.
Recently the Government Entomologist,
intent on battling with the Northern grass-
hopper plague, imported from America a
certain parasite alleged to be deadly to all
the locust tribe. Said parasite was placed
in a suitable “culture,” allowed to increase
and multiply, and finally was sent up North
and tried on the grasshopper tribe. But the
pests in question received the parasite with
great joy, and immediately remained more
numerous than ever. Just as the cochineal
failed signally on the Queensland prickly-
pear, and no inoculation of virus could ever
damage the Queensland bunny, so the Yankee
bacteria collapsed when faced with the
saw-handled bounder that ravages Northern
vegetation. The explanation is obvious.
Such a vigor is attained by animal and vege-
table life under the benign climate of the
North that ordinary methods of extermina-
tion are futile. The tendency to become
octogenarian or centenarian is simply in-
eradicable.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 26, 1913.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
My suspicions of last week have been
unpleasantly realised. The small-pox uevh
is abroad, and the stampede for vaccination
(it was a very small stampede) was headed
by Governor Macgregor and the Missus,
with the vice-regal substitute, Arthur Mor-
gan, well in the running. One hostess, who
nail sent out invitations to a dance, found
tuat most of her expected guests were tem-
porarily crippled, so a pathetic notice in
one of the newspapers announced that, “in
consequence of me vaccination of many of
the guests,” tbe tiing was procrastinated into
me middle distance.
A titled lady with a colored secretary
(female) is in mis village, ami is one or the
chief items of me week’s tattle. Sue pos-
sesses some bulky jewels and a hubby who is
a maharajah, or maiiatma or something by
the old Bombay pagoda.
The large Butt lady and her husband
gave two more concerts this week, and each
time the audience demanded encores in a
greedy, not to say gluttonous, manner. As
me lady’s voice becomes richer and fuller,
mat of Kennerley’s becomes not so rich and
partly empty. This was especially notice-
able at the' last concert, when he essayed
three songs by Brahms. The result was no
good to -Brahms. Another concert, of Eng-
lish songs only, is to be given next week.
Several clever Australians have been con-
spicuous at the various theatres and halls
during the past few days. Among the Get-
Rich-Quick Wallingfords are Ronnie Byram
and Rosalie Smeaton, a Brisbane boy and
girl; and Miss Clarke, a daughter of Mar-
cus, llis Natural Life. Young Murdoch,
whose piano playing is a delight, and Carter,
of the weird front name and divine fiddle and
bow, are others. Robert Greig and his Bea-
trice Holloway should be counted in, too,
wherefore they are duly counted.
The Art Students gave a masked ball on
Tuesday night, and decorated the somewhat
dirty walls of the Centennial Hall with a
copy of the Bayeux tapestry (the same that
the’ Melbourne students used at their ball
last month). Gwen Stanley, as a valkyrie,
and Carseldine as Siegfried, wore costumes
cleverly made of paper, hessian, and a few
bits of leather. Dozens of harem liveries,
relics of the Asiatic ball of last year, ap-
peared again. It was a cheerful dance, but
Pierpont Morgan wouldn’t have rushed the
cash-box.
The inter-State croquet concluded with a
bridge and euchre jag last Thursday night.
On Friday afternoon, tea was boiled at
Ascot, after which Mrs. Tait, who is Grand
Mallet of the local club, distributed the
trophies. Mrs. Holdsworth and Mrs.
Kibblewhite, two of the visitors, have since
gone on a visit to the Barron Falls.
On Wednesday, little Gwen Sparkes was
married to Jack Barnes, who was born in
England, but has done his best to live it
down by building up a motor-car business m
Australia. The bride is very young, not yet
20, and the Anglican Cathedral, where the
tying and sighing were done, was full of
the younger set, in its best frock and bib.
North Queensland is the rendezvous of the
moon.
The Creche and Kindergarten and the
Prevention of Cruelty folk are getting busy
rolling up another ball for August. Last
year both these associations scooped up
good sugar in this way, and it takes a lot ot
sugar to sweeten their work.
The Commercial Travellers _ are soothing
their wives and their best girls, and the
other fellow’s best girl, with bursts of melodi
at their club to-night. The melody is not
of the club members’ own vintage, but that
of the Black and White Pierrots, with
Walter Thurlow in charge.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Under the new Railway Bill, Commis-
sioner Evans’s salary is to so up to £2SUU
a year—a rise of £5OO. It is almost
enough to make one think that Evans is an
imported man instead of a good local
product.
“Tim Fogarty” : The potato crop in many
districts in Queensland has been condemned
as having Irish blight. There has always
been a doubt whether the genuine Irisn
blight was in Australia at all. but there is
no doubt whatever that the great majority
of the condemned Queensland tubers are en-
tirely innocent. The crops are exceptionally
poor this year, and about 75 per cent, of the
tubers are affected by either wet rot or some
kindred disease. The great trouble is tna'
officers have been told to look for Irish
blight, and as they eat. drink and sleep with
blight in their minds they naturally see a
bogey at last in every bush. Meantime
Henry Tryon, the boss-man who < rea.il>
knows something about the disease, is holi-
daying in India, looking for a mate for tne
cochineal bug. which doesn’t kill the prickly-
pear.

A Strong, Rigid Fence
“Empire” Fence is not wire-netting, but a
strong, rigid fence, and far neater than com-
mon wire-fencing. The wires are held by a
perfect knot, which cannot slip. The meshes
are small at the bottom for sheep and lambs.
It has no sharp points, will not rust, and is
practically indestructible.
Is cheap to buy, easy to erect. Two men
can erect a mile per day.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mysterv or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. Thev
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain.
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt’,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion cf the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you h<}ve lost
the heari ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. , Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured and you can be cured, too. You mav wear

ECZEMA STARTED

And Running Sores, Spread All
Over Face, In Dreadful State,
Itching and Misery Terrible.
Used Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment, Skin Soft and Clear,
Leaghur, Via Boort, Vic. —“My eldest
boy had eczema when he was a month old.
It started with a rash on his cheek and run-
ning sores, then spread all over his face and
at the age of six months was in a dreadful
state. His head was all running sores and
also his back and the tops of his shoulders
and the itching and misery he suffered was
terrible.
“I had to put socks on his hands to pre-
vent him from tearing the sores and making
them bleed. I tried ointments of different
kinds, but without success When he was
about a year old we took him away for a
change and when we -were coming home a
gentleman in the train advised us to use
Cuticura Remedies, so we got a cake of Cuti-
cura Soap and a large tin of Cuticura Oint-
ment and when we had finished the Cuticura
Ointment together with the Cuticura Soap,
which I used according to the instructions
in the book, he was quite cured, and his skin
was as soft and clear as it could be. lam
thankful to say that the sores have never
come back again, and I hope that mothers
with suffering children will give the Cuticura
Remedies a trial. They give ease and with
it refreshing sleep when all else fails. My
boy is now seven years of age and strong and
well.” (Signed) Mrs. T. F. Slatter, Jan.
12, 1912.

“Carrying things
from where they
are plentiful to
where they are
wanted” . . . .
Is Elbert Hubbard’s definition of
Commerce.
Every Commercial undertaking has
to “carry things” from one place
to another;
The bigger the enterprise, the more
it has to carry—and the greater
the necessity for handling those
things in the most expeditious and
labor-saving manner.

“Lolorua”: The Australian ships Parramatta and
Yarra paid a visit to the Vailala River (Papua) re-
cently to inspect the Oil Field outlet to the sea.
They had an adventurous time. In the South-East
monsoon the bars of the rivers flowing into the Gulf
of Papua are almost impassable owing to the terri-
fic surf, and the Vailala is no exception to the rule.
When there is a stiff breeze it is, to use the words
of an old hand, “simply a mixture of earthquake
and deluge all in a tabloid.” It seems generally
decided that the only port worth considering for the
safe shipment of oil is Hall Sound, but much money
will be required for the construction of a pipe line
from the wells. Also, several large rivers will need
to be bridged. Hall Sound is big enough to hold a
couple of navies. All it needs to make it perfectly
secure are some lights and beacons.

“Briner’s” breathless summary: The Endeavour is
just back after six months trawling in the Great
Australian Bight. An area about 400 miles long by
100 miles wide was covered. Adelaide was the head-
quarters, with cruises into this belt, working gradu-
ally to eastward of Eucla. Fish was obtainable in
marketable quantities everywhere. The depth ranged
from 90 to 200 fathoms. Bottom very clear and
free from obstruction. The further south the ex-
plorers went the more the sea deepened. Few fish were
obtainable beyond the 100 miles limit. No trawling
was attempted beyond about 150 miles west of
Eucla, but it is believed the payable ground extends
right out to the west of the continent. The catches
consisted mostly of flathead and whiting. Also, a
very large red-headed schnapper was found. Flat-
heads were fine. Whiting not like the coasters, but
are a deep-sea variety, smaller. All schnapper red-
der than our familiar ones, and have larger heads
and smaller bodies.

All going well, an auctioneer’s jubilee will be
celebrated next year. J. C. Stanford, of Melbourne,
has been selling stock for Powers, Rutherford and
Co. for 49 years. Though in his 72nd year, he is
still going strong, and the other day disposed of
580 lots of sheep in five hours.

“Inchiquin”: The Vic. Royal Commission referred
to in “The Fool-Farmer and His Wheat” (B.
19/6/’l3), has been a long time discovering very
little. Here in South Aus. the f.a.q. standard is
fixed in the same manner, but it is hard to see
where the irtethod hurts the farmer. Wheat, what-
ever the f.a.q. standard may be, is bought at 601 b.
to the bushel. Of course, if a farmer brings in obvi-
ously poor wheat, it is tested; if under the f.a.q.
standard it is still bought at 601 b. to the bushel,
but the farmer is then, rightly enough, docked in
price. The f.a.q. standard of South Aus. for the last
20 years has averaged about 621 b., and any wheat under
621 b. would be practically useless for milling pur-
poses. As a farmer, I can’t see how a Government-
appointed body for fixing the f.a.q. standard is going
to do any good. They might put it at 571 b., but
the buyers would then simply lower the price accord-
ingly. The greatest help the State can give to the
farmer is to enable him to ship his wheat from the
nearest port, instead of obliging him to send it to
the capital. F’rinstance, wheat goes from Border-
town to Port Adelaide, 200 miles, at a freight of
about sd. per bushel, whereas there are ports within
100 miles that could easily be put in touch with
Bordertown. Also, owing to States Fright, wheat is
worth 2d. per bushel more at Servicetown than at
Bordertown, with only 15 miles between the two
places. The explanation is that S.A. wheat must on
no account go to Victoria, so an exorbitant freight
is charged from Bordertown to Servicetown. Also,
the same narrow-minded policy decrees that Vic-
torian machinery intended for Bordertown must
travel blithely through that town and on to Adelaide,
and then back again, doing nearly 400 miles of
unnecessary travelling, and paying many pounds of
unnecessary freight. The fool-farmer puts up with
this; and when Unification and Reconstruction are
mentioned —the things that would kill these stupid
anomalies deader than anything else, or than all
other things put together—he takes his cue from
the congested city party and regards the proposed
reform as some new and terrible breed of red rust
or tiger or take-all.
“X.P.D.”: Regarding the non-utilisation of some
hundreds of thousands of gallons of the molasses
that Queensland sugar-mills squeeze out, Young
Bros., of Fairymead, among the biggest sugar-pro-
ducers in the State, declined, for years, to assist in
bringing more fantods into the world by selling
their molasses to people who might make rum of it.
They, therefore, ran most of the stuff into the
Burnett River. You haven’t any idea what a reli-
gious lot they were who used to teach Tommy Tanna
hymns after that poor profit-maker’s long day was
over. The singing at Fairymead, by the way, was
something Very special.
THE DELUSIVE DUKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As a matter of fact, it is extremely difficult often
to distinguish between one of our old noblesse and
one of our grocers.—B. S/71’13
I took him for a grocer, I
Could not exactly tell you why.
We met—it hardly matters now
Where was the meeting, what, or how!
But “Everyone” was there I found —•
There were refreshments handed round.
He met me with a stare, I own,
Like lots of grocers I have known.
And when I glanced at him again,
The sanded-sugar look was plain.
Yet many grocers—so I swore —
Had better clothes than this one wore.
Lo! as I looked a smiling band
Of men came to him, hat in hand.
They bowed. They almost cringed. I’d ne’er
Seen grocers Cringed to anywhere.
Turning to someone at my side,
“What is that tradesman’s name?” I cried.
“He ain’t no tradesman—you’ve mistook,” .
My friend replied. “That bloke’s a Dook!”
“Good Lord!” I said, and then I fled,
With this thought running in my head.
If that’s the Aristocracy—
My best respects to groceree!
VICTORIA.
EARDLEY TURNER.
THE CARELESS TRADER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir, —A friend of mine asked me the other day
which church I attended. My answer was: “I
hardly know there are any churches in the district,
except when I hear the bells on Sunday morning as
I dig the garden.” For the past three years I
have been living in a sparsely-populated suburb, and
during that period have had only one minister call
at my house. We happened to be out; we have
never had another call. When one takes into con-
sideration the number of churches in a district, with
a minister or two to each, to say nothing of church
workers, I think there must be something wrong. I
am sure my case is not an isolated one. —Complaint
of a correspondent in Melb. Age.
I’m told there is a church near by
Where, for a humble tray,
Religion may be purchased, or
A man may buy forgiveness for
The sins of yesterday.
But, though that church for lucre pines,
It is not run on business lines.
When sev’ral weeks ago I made
My domicile out here,
Most promptly came the trading ilk
To sell me meat, and bread, and milk,
Pianos, fish and beer ;
The Church alone remiss has been—
Its traveller we have not yet seen!
VICTORIA.

The one-year-old twins of Mrs. M. A. Smith, Tennyson Street, Beckenham, Christchurch,
. N.Z., who were cured of Whooping Cough by Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
“My two children (twins one year old) were suffering severely from Whooping
Cough, Bronchitis, and severe colds on the chest and lungs, turning black in the
face with violent coughing fits, and almost choking with phlegm in the throat,”
writes Mrs. M. A. Smith, Gowan Lea, Tennyson Street, Beckenham, N.Z. “I was
nearly driven frantic with worry and anxiety. We had tried all the patent medicines
and home remedies we could think of. with no good result. My only neighbor
happened to have some of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, and brought it to us, saying
she was certain it would cure them, and I am pleased to say she was perfectly
correct. The first few doses immediately relieved the phlegm from the throat and
chest, and gave us time to send for more, which permanently cured them, and I can
conscientiously say that Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery was the means of them being
alive and healthy to-day, and I shall never feel contented if I have not a supply in
the home.”
WHAT DO YOU GIVE BABY
FOR HIS COLD?
Foolish mothers dose their babies with home-made concoctions, and perhaps upset
tte little stomach, and make the baby cross and uncomfortable by this mistaken
economy. Wise mothers do not experiment with untried nostrums, but depend on a
remedy which has been compiled from the scientific prescription of a famous physician,
and is designed to cure the cold without upsetting the digestive organs. Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery is this remedy, and mothers may give it to their babies, secure in the
knowledge that coughs and colds will not longer rack the little bodies. For Croup it
has the most wonderful results. Whooping Cough is cut short by the use of Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery. For all the family ills resulting from throat, chest or lung
complaints, the mother’s resource is Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is the quickest, safest, and best-known remedy for
Coughs, Colds, Pleurisy. Bronchitis, and all Throat and Chest Troubles. It is a remedy
that can always be relied upon. Obtainable everywhere at 1/6 and 3/-

Professor Smith.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HERE is the tale of Henry Smith,
Who taught that God was but a
myth—■
Of what befell the earth’s array
Upon the last great Judgment Dav.
In serried ranks before the Throne,
Where He in splendor sat alone,
The countless peoples were arrayed,
Some confident, some sore afraid.
“Stand out, O, Henry Smith, stand out!”
Thus did the usher angels shout.
•■Stand out, Professor Henry Smith,
And answer for your deeds forthwith,”
Lo. at the naming of this man
Through all the Jukt a shudder ran—•
The stringent Just who knew him well,
This scientist who laughed at Hell.
From out the ranks stepped Henry Smith,
The man who’d named his God a myth ;
With fearless tread he walked alone
Into the space before the Throne.
A holy bishop, standing near,
Spake softly in his neighbor’s ear :
“Oh, he will make a fitting brand !”
He whispered low behind his hand.
“On earth I knew his teaching well.
He scorned our creed ; he scoffed at Hell.
It is the famed Professor Smith
Who strove to prove our God a myth.
“And what men called his ‘theory,’
Conceived in wicked blasphemy,
Lik„ raging fire spread o’er the world,
And millions to perdition hurled.
“A scientist, so he was named.
He held that no man should be blamed
For sins he sinned of his own will. . . .
Now, mark the grinding of God’s mill !”
“Stand out, stand out, O, Henry Smith.
And answer for your deeds forthwith.”
And, fearless, as he lived and died,
“I answer,” Henry Smith replied.
With necks outstretched, with heads forth
thrust,
The stern, the unforgiving Just
Stood back, with Blame in ev’ry eye,
To watch the Wicked Man go by.
Across the space he walked alone,
And stood before the mighty Throne.
Then Henry Smith bowed low his head.
“In many things I erred,” he said.
With bated breath, with heads out thrust.
On tiptoe stood the list’ning Just.
No man among them held a doubt
Now God’s high wrath would thunder out.
But with a gaze that could but bless,
A gaze of wondrous tenderness.
God looked upon the bended head.
“You erred. Poor little man !” He said.
“You erred. And in this great array
Is there one mortal who can say
He has not erred in what he thought.
In what he guessed, or proved, or taught?
“Nay, men there were who held my name
A synonym for wrath and blame —
Who thought, their foolish souls to save,
God could condemn while men forgave.
“0, foolish mortals ! to conspire
To grasp my mighty plan entire —
To each believe lie held the key
To all the cosmic mystery.
“And now you know, O, Henry Smith,
That your Creator is no myth.
And all your keenly-reasoned scheme
Is shattered like a childish dream.
“You were a man of Sin, forsooth,
In that you strove to know the truth;
In that you used your puny might
To spurn the false, and seek the right.
"Be comforted, poor little man,
For in the Universal Plan
You did your task amid the rest.
And all Man’s work was for the best.
"Now, foolish children, all shall see,
At last, the ill-guessed mystery.”
And, leaning from his mighty chair.
God smiled, and Paradise was there.

The Case of Gertrude.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ nVT~O,” said Gertrude with unobtrusive
pathos. “It could never be.
1 Never!”
For me the world came to an end. I had
so confidently counted on another answer. I
looked down at Gertrude’s face. Her head
was still on my shoulder. In the agitation
of the moment she must have forgotten all
about it. I did not remind her.
But I saw no kindness in the brimming
eyes she turned to mine. In her face there
was a dainty sternness, a delicate determina-
tion that I knew sealed my fate. Her mouth
drooped with a hopeless sadness.
Suddenly a dim kindness softened her fea-
tures.
“1....c0u1d be a sister to you,” she ven-
tured hopefully. , <T
“Thanks,” I said, a little shortly. I
have several. Several too many, as a
matter of fact.”
Her eyes fell. „ , T ,
. Oh,” she said pathetically, and I
think it would comfort you a little.”
“We are a large family already.’
“I thought it might cheer you up, after
.vour dreadful disappointment. And, besides,
d was my own idea. It just flashed into my
mind at the moment.”
“I’ve so many sisters,” I sighed.
“Only three,” said Gertrude.
“Seven,” I retorted. T
Nonsense, Jack, darl —Jack, I mean; I
know them all. There’s only Ella and May
and Gwendoline.”
“And four more.” ,
‘But how is it that I’ve never heard of
the others?”
“You don’t know them.”
“But where are they?”
waved my disengaged hand vaguely. “In
the four quarters of the globe,” I sighed,
impossible!” said Gertrude,
y ell, ’ I said, “perhaps not; so far away
as that. But they’re scattered about; one
here, one there.”
“Married sisters, perhaps, that I’ve never
heard of?”
I admitted, with a sigh.
.1 wouldn't want to be one of your
married sisters, Jack.”
“No,” I agreed. "Please don’t be a
married sister.”
t me who they all are,” she persisted.
. It needless,” I said. “They belong
to the family, of course; but....the l fact is
....they came into the family.”
“Adopted?” Gertrude was astonished. I
was almost afraid that she would remember
where her head was.
’A\ ell, they adopted themselves, so to
speak.”
“All in a bunch?”
“No, at decent intervals.”
“Extraordinary!” said Gertrude. “But
why ?”
“They wanted to be my sisters.”
“But for ever why? You’re hardly the
sort of man that a girl would want for a
brother.”
I was annoyed. “Why not? Yom offered
to be a sister !”
“Oh!” said Gertrude, softly. A moment
later she remembered where her head was
and furtively removed it. She moved a
little way along the garden seat. I had often
wondered why they made garden seats so
long.
“So this wasn’t your first proposal?” said
Gertrude from the cold loneliness of the far
end of th& garden seat.
“Was I so awkward as that?”
“But four other girls !” she said as if to
herself.
“Four more sisters to me,” I said firmly.,
“Well, I decline to be lumped with four
other girls,” she said with a sudden deter-
mination in her voice.
“My own!” I exclaimed haopily.
She ' l ~dged.
“Nothing of the sort,” she said indignantly
when she had recovered breath. “I wouldn’t
have you now, after you had preferred four
objects to me. No, I wouldn’t have you now
—never, never, never !”
In order to emphasise her remarks she
moved a little nearer to me. Still, they make
garden seats absurdly long.
“But why won’t you?” I said cautiously.
“Because... .well, I suppose I must tell
you all, Jack.”
“No,” I cried in horror, “not all!”
“Well, no; not all,” she acquiesced. Then
in a new mood of caution she glanced fear-
fully over her shoulder into the rhododendron
thicket. “Can we be overheard?” she whis-
pered, and came closer still. (The futility
of the manufacturers of garden seats!)
“My dearest Gertrude,” I said, “I would
not be such a fool. Remember this is my
fifth.”
“I can never marry,” she said serenely,
putting her hand in mine.”
“Till when?”
“Never.”
“I could wait till then,” I suggested.
“It would be no use, darl”
“Convent?” I queried.
“Fat,” she replied.
I glanced cautiously at Gertrude. She
seemed sensible —at least as sensible as she
ever seemed. My mind ran back swiftly
among her relations. Had any of them ever
gone suddenly mad? I di~Jv remembered
an uncle who had retired from the Stock Ex-
change and gone into the Church. Perhaps
the taint was hereditary.
“Of course,” I said conciliatingly.
“Is it so noticeable as that?” she asked
in alarm. “I thought that nobody but
myself”
“Quite unnoticeable to me,” I assured her.
“But I carry the secret in my heart. It
is horrible,” she murmured.
“Be explicit, Gertrude. Even tell me all.”
Gertrude nestled closer, and we sat side
by side in the darkness, lost in the infinite
loneliness of that garden seat. And she told
me all.
"It was years and years ago—-oh, when I
was a. mere child, that I first found it out;
but, of course, I took no notice of it till
lately. I was alwavs a....we11; a plump
child. I remember. I rather looked down on
the skinny ones. Sometimes they called me
‘Fatty,’ and once nurse, in a moment of
irritation, said ‘Podge !’ ”
I looked at Gertrude. True, she was
plump—deliciously so; but Todge? Never.
I said something to this effect.
Gertrude smiled with a pathetic grateful-
ness. (<T
At last she nerved herself to go on. l
have been weighing myself regularly for the
last year,” she said in a proud, courageous
voice. “It has cost me all my chocolate
money in penny weighing machines, and so
many of them take your penny and don t
give you any weight at all.”
“The callous wretches!”
Gertrude smiled gratefully. „ And Ive
been steadily growing heavier.”
“Nonsense,” I said. “You re not heavy.
I’ve had heavier on my kn —I mean, Ive
seen heavier people.” „
“It was the only thing that comforted me,
she said simply. “I often wondered how
you could stand it so long without getting

said “Practice.” ,
She continued in an emotionless voice.
“I’ve read a lot about it, and I ve been try"
ing evervthing to reduce my weight. But
even if 1 starve. I only grow heavier. It
goes on, month after month, like a eurse,
relentlessly, remorselessly, imperturbably,
implacably. Nothing I can do will stoj. it.
Oh. .Tack, it is a terrible thing to feel stout-
ness hanging over yon, suspended by a hair,
waiting for vou round the corner of middle

matronlv!” She shuddered at the word.
A quotation leapt to my remembrance.
“Meals may come and meals may go, but it
ioel on forever!” No, that was not right.

noted again its deUcious nlumnness

Zam-Buk is the Mother's Friend *
ACCIDENTS will happen, even in the best-regulated
families. Healthy youngsters seem to be always
“in the wars”; housework abounds with mishaps
for busy wives and harassed mothers; and the bread-
winner often returns from work with a more
or less serious injury. Just what every home
needs is Zam-Buk. A pot and a bandage on
a handy shelf, where they are ready for
instant use, save untold pain, time and
money.
When the little one runs in from his
play with a wry face and smarting, dirt-filled
scrape on his knee, simply wash the part and
smear with Zam-Buk. When father cuts or
scrapes his hand, the handy pot of Zam-Buk
again meets the emergency, and the house-
wife or mother continually finds it a real
friend in need for the burns she receives
while cooking, the scalds of a washing day,
or the knocks and bruises of dusting.
Children like Zam-Buk because it is
cooling, soothing and pleasant. Their elders value it
still more highly because it is also antiseptic, prevent-
ing poisoning, festering, and because it is good for 1
the tenderest skin. Daily mishaps make Zam-lluk a
daily need, therefore “keep Zam-Buk handy” is the
sound home motto.
Every Home Needs Zam-BuK
BOY’S SCALD AND GIRL’S SORES HEALED.
Mrs. Marion Crimmings, Forsyth and Pensliurst
Streets, Willoughby, North Sydney, says:—“A tin of
boiling water burst and the scalding water poured out
all orer the face and shoulders of my little boy, Joe.
One side of his face swelled out into an enormous
blister, which broke and left the surface in a raw state.
We applied oil and the white of an egg. Later we
dressed the injury with Zam-Buk, which healed his face
in a week or two.
“My little girl, Kathleen, had an eruption of sores
break out on her head. Zam-Buk completely cured her.”

Colic, Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’3 Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

The quick relief afforded by Cham-
berlain’s Cough Remedy in cases of
whooping cough makes it a favorite
with mothers of small children. It
liquefies the tough mucus, makes it
easy to expectorate, keeps the cough
loose and counteracts any tendency
for it to result in pneumonia.
COUGH REMEDY.
“The trouble is that stoutness is heredi-
tary,” she murmured.
“Well,” I said, triumphantly, “that’s all
right. Your mother is” —-—
“Yes, my mother is quite thin; but look
at my father.”
“Merely a comfortable figure for a middle-
aged man.”
‘Wes, but if I take after him—and if I go
on at the rate I have kept up for the last
fortnight, I shall overtake him. What is
merely a comfortable figure for a man of
middle age is altogether too uncomfortable
for me.”
“Yes, but do you take after your father?”
“In some things.”
“In what?”
“I’ve got my father’s eyes, and his h£ir,
and his walk, and his temper.” She_ enumer-
ated the attributes with a suspicion of
pride.
“They won’t scale much,” I offered in
consolation.
“Then there’s Aunt Jane Anna. Her
stoutness is prodigious. No ; I don’t know
yet how I’m going to develop. Parts of me
take after father and other parts after
mother.”
“But none after Aunt Jane Anna?”
“No.” She assented reluctantly. “But,
by-and-bye they might develop. It’s the
uncertainty of the future that terrifies me.
Suppose I should develop into a”
“Podge,” I suggested.
Gertrude shuddered. “No; I can never
marry. I would never dare to allow an un-
suspecting man to become the husband of” —
“A possible Podge. Why* my dear Ger-
trude ; that’s what every man who proposes
does. Every spinster, to the discriminating
masculine eye, is a possible Podge. But we
all take the risk. It’s worth it. And, if you
consider, the only women who really succeed
in becoming Podges are widows. Which
shows that marriage is as good as anti-fat.
And, dearest, I do not ask you to be a
widow. Marriage means worry, and worry
means slimness.”
Gertrude’s face brightened. The tears
that had been gathering in her troubled eyes
did not fall. She replaced her head on my
shoulder.
“You open out a new avenue of hope to
me,” she said thankfully.
“Let us face the future together,” I said.
“Hand in hand we will confront its possi-
bilities. Hand in hand we shall combat its
impending stoutness.”
“I don’t think I shall be a sister to you,
darling,” she confided in a confidential
whisper.
* * * *
We are to be married next June, and so
far there is no shadow on our lives. The
demon of stoutness keeps out of sight. Ger-
trude is three pounds lighter, and though
that is only a slight margin, the vague
terror of the future is to some extent lifted.
The curse has been stayed. Whether it will
fall upon us with renewed vigor we cannot
foretell. We can only hope. But we feel
that we are making a strenuous fight against
the future’s possible fat.
So far, I have not observed any further
traits of her father in Gertrude. She cer-
tainly has not her father’s temper. It is not
even Aunt Jane Anna’s. It is entirely one
of her own; or if it belongs to the family, it
has all the modern improvements of quick
action and a vastly greater area of penetra-
tion. That is the most encouraging sign of
all. Statistics prove that temper does not
go with stoutness.
Of late, indeed, I am beginning to wonder
whether, after all, it wouldn’t be more
comfortable for us both in the future if Ger-
trude had a little less temper and a little
more plumpness.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The Grateful Murphy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A TALL, broad-shouldered figure, thin of
flank and square of jaw, unkempt,
unwashed and unshaven, was lean-
ing disconsolately against a lamp-post in
the early morning. It was Murphy, the Man
Handler. His eyes were bloodshot, his lips
cracked, and the stains of recent conflict
were spattered over the front of a collarless
shirt that had once been white. Murphy
had been on a tremendous drunk, and was
suffering a recovery. I did not know Murphy
then, but I knew the symptoms, and I was
sorrv for him. Moreover, although I did not
enjoy the luxury of personal acquaintance-
ship with him, I had heard something of his
history, which was picturesque and exhilar-
ating. He was the hero of a hundred rough-
and-tumble fights, the acknowledged Bruiser
of Brunswick, that bellicose brick-making
suburb of Melbourne.
But Murphy, leaning against a lamp-post
and gazing with bloodshot eyes upon a dry,
uncharitable world, looked anything but a
proud man that morning.
I sauntered slowly past him and turned
into the Brickmakers’ Arms. As I crossed
the threshold of the hotel I looked back and
saw his eyes fixed upon me with the wistful
gaze of a sick bulldog. His spirit was
broken for the time and the truculence had
died out of him.
* * * *
The sight was too much for me. I
beckoned him with finger crooked and up-
ward jerk of elbow. He understood imme-
diately, and came towards me, walking with
toes turned out at an angle of 45 degrees,
and shoulders gently oscillating. Then I
saw what a splendid specimen of a man he
was —six foot three in height if an inch,
and with a chest like a bastion. Looking at
him it was hot hard to believe the current
legend that upon one occasion it took five
policemen, fighting all the way, to convey
him to the local lockup.
“May I ask you to do me the favor of
joining me in a drink, Mr. Murphy?” I
observed.
“God reward ye,” he replied ; “a pint.”
It was worth the price of a gallon to
watch the pewter gently tilting upwards,
and to hear his deep-drawn “Ah!” as he set
it down upon the counter.
“How did it feel?” I inquired with a
smile. , , .
“I cud hear it splash.” he said : I was
that impty.”
But of course I knew well enough that a
pint was a mere sip of comfort to a tower
of a man like this, after a big debauch.
“Have another,” I said, “and let me recom-
mend you to try a little gin with it.”
He had another, and tried a little gin
with it.
The result was excellent. The corners
of his mouth, which had fallen into a mis-
anthropic droop, straightened themselves,
and began to take an upward curve.
Another pint, and Murphy w r as his own
man again.
“Sor,” he said, shaking me by the hand
with a hand as broad and hard as a shovel
blade, “ye’ve saved me loife, an’ Paddy
Murphy is not the man to forget his friends,
or,” he added grimly, “his inimies ayther.”
* * * *
The giant gazed at me with a look of
affectionate interest. Then he bent down —
I am a small man —and said in a hoarse
whisper, “Is there anybody ye wud loike
me to stoush? Say the wurrd, and pint out
the man, an’ its’ done.”
I thanked him for his offer, but said that
I was not aware that I had any enemy.
“Ivery man has inimies,”, said Murphy
sententiously.
By this time we were in the street and
strolling towards Royal Park.
“Why should every man have enemies?”
I remarked.
“Because it’s dhirty human nathur for
it to be so. If ye’re a good man in yer
own line of business, whatever it is, ivery
other man of the same thrade who is not
as good a man as ye are, hates ye for bein’
betther than himself, an’ wurrks in the dark
agin ye if he’s afeard to tackle ye in the
daylight.”
“You seem, Mr. Murphy”
“Paddy to ye, sor, if ye plaze,” he said
with fine politeness.
“Well, Paddy—you seem to speak from
experience. Has anybody worked against
you in the way you describe?”
“Throops of thim —the mane hounds,” he
replied bitterly.
“And what did you do about it?”
“Stoushed thim,” said the giant.
“But if that didn’t stop them what did
you do then?”
“I kept on stoushin’ thim —what else
could I do?”
“And what did they do?”
“Well,” he answered, with a quaint
twinkle in his eye, “sometimes they tuk me
to coort, and sometimes they left the dis-
tlirict. But mostly they left the disthrict.”
I handed Paddy my pouch and we sat
down on a bench in the park and smoked
in silence for a few minutes. Then I
thought it was my duty to speak to him
like a father. The great, good-natured, reck-
less creature interested me in a wonderful
way. I pointed out to him how much better
it would be for him to live in peace with
his neighbors, and drink in moderation, than
to be always fighting, and making a beer-
cask of his body.
He listened as patiently as if I were the
parish priest talking to him.
“It’s all thrue enough in a way,” he said,
when I had finished, “but I’m as paceful a
man as walks the ground, if they wud only
let me alone. But they won’t let me alone.
There’s some that hates me because I’m a
good wurrkman, an’ niver out of a job only
whin I’m dhrinkin’, and there’s others that
hates me because I’m a big man an’ a
sthrong man, an’ can belt h —l out of thim
whiniver they annoy me too much. So be-
tween thim it’s dam little pace I can get.
As for the dhrinkin’, I do that with me
frinds —bad luck to thim, I dunno which is
the worst, frinds or inimies.”
I had no more to say in the way of ser-
monising. Paddy was a much too clever
casuist for me to handle. Anyhow, I saw
that the small quantity of stimulant he had
taken was dying out of him, and that it was
time to, as the chemists say, exhibit a little
more, and then speed him on his way. So
we strolled back again to the hotel, and
repeated the dose. As I was taking leave of
him, he said earnestly, “Ye’ve acted like a
man by me to-day, sor, an’ I’m sorry that
there’s nothin’ I can do for ye to show that
I’m thankful. If ye kyant think of any
inimy ye may have, maybe ye know of some-
body who might turn out to be an inimy at
some time or other, or somebody that ye
wud like to make an inimy of. There’s
nothin’ like bein’ beforehand with these
dhirty scoundhrels.”
I told him that as soon as I could settle
upon somebody of the kind he described I
would let him know.
“An’ I’ll stoush him, without delay,” said
Paddy.
We shook hands and parted, the best
friends in the borough.
I watched him swaggering down the
street, his hat cocked on one side, and his
hands swinging—a tower of a man.
* * * *
Mr. Murphy was even better than his
word. He watched over my safety—when-
ever I went abroad of evenings, now and
then —with embarrassing solicitude. He
never thrust his company upon me. but—
especially on Saturday nights, when Sydney-
road was crowded, and all the local larrikins
were out —I could see him following me like
a large, grimy, guardian Angel. But I
took particular care to never give him an
excuse to assault and batter anybody on my
behalf. I had no idea then of the depth of
Murphy’s gratitude and good feeling. I got
some idea of it later, however, when I re-
ceived from him a shockingly ill-spelt note
asking me to go to the lockup and bail him
out. When I arrived there and —after some
trouble —got him out, I asked him why he
had been run in. He told me that he was
in an hotel the night before, and the man who
wrote for the local paper and some printers
and brickies were also there, and he
(Paddy) said that I (the present writer)
was the cleverest blanky man and the best
blanky poet in Australia. Then they said
that I was not, and, in fact, that I was
only a blanky outsider.
“And what did you do then, Paddy?” I
said, with some excusable eagerness.
“I belted h —l out of them, an’ cleared
the bar. Then I was arristed—whin the
wind was out o’ me.”
I took him into the nearest hotel, and
tdd him to call for anything he liked. He
took his usual pint. I paid his fine when
the case came on and left Brunswick two
days afterwards. Paddy was a grateful
creature and a true friend, hut his gratitude
would have ruined me if I had lived in his
neighborhood much longer.

Where is the Car to Equal
The METZ “22” at £185?
Where is the car at any price that can do nearly as well? Think of the
economy of it! Think of the saving in cost of running! Think of the
satisfaction of running a car that leaves your mind free to enjoy the Dleasure
without bothering about “mileage cost and upkeep.”
Its simplicity captivates everyone who knows anything about thoroughbred
motor-car construction. It certainly will appeal to you, from considerations
quite apart from the price. It is stylish, comfortable and durable—a car
that delivers the maximum of economy and efficiency.
Investigate. Get the facts, so that you may compare it with cars costing
even twice as much. Details on request, and trial trips to prove it. Price

If you buy your machinery on the sporting principle, you
can take chances. But few men do that. They much
prefer to buy on a certainty—machinery that they
definitely KNOW will pay a handsome return for the
outlay.
All the Goodall machinery is of the “certainty” type. By
actual figures we can show you just how it will profit you
and how the cost may be met by increased business. The
easy terms we arrange materially help those who do not
desire to pay cash. Let our expert hear from you
soon, and he will go fully into any machinery matter.
