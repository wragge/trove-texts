WHICH CAR
MAKES NEW
MEAN WHAT
IT MEANS?
The only new thing about some cars is
the name. Not this one. BMC Morris
1100 is all new—from bonnet to boot!
It’s the car you hoped would happen.
It breaks through with revolutionary
engineering. Take, for example, the
llydrolastic ::: suspension. It floats the
car cn fluid so it can’t bounce or roll
or pitch. And it never needs mainten-
ance. Take the special sealed cooling
system. Take the sound-dampening
rubber-mounted sub-frames. Take all
that stretch-out inside space. Why not
take the BMC Morris 1100? and
ride in the cushioned comfort of con-
toured seating. Listen to approving
comments from friends at the sweet,
low styling; from mechanics at the
front-wheel drive system that packs
engine, clutch and gearbox into one
amazing unit. The BMC Morris 1100
looks like the future and acts
like it. It’s the car that puts the
family first. Now’s the time to try the
Miraculous BMC Morris 1100 the
car you hoped would happen.

The Piper Twin Comache, operated by
“Union Air” for Union Oil Development
Corp. & Oil Drilling & Exploration,
covered 75,000 trouble-shooting miles
in its first 3 months of ownership!
. . . that’s pretty heavy airtime, but operating inland oil rigs calls for an
airplane that can cover long distances fast. The Piper Twin Comanche,
with its twin engine reliability and long life, thrives on this type of
schedule.
Based in Toowoomba, this plane has made trips as far afield as Central
Australia for Union Development Corporation. Without refuelling it
once covered 900 nautical miles carrying an 8001 b. load !
Mr. C. J. Richards, Chief Pilot of Union Air, said: —
“What attracted me to Piper was the amazingly low purchase price for a
twin-engined machine having all the traditional Piper engineering
skill and finish. In every aspect of economy and performance, the Twin
Comanche has-fulfilled all we hoped of her and then some!”
This high opinion is endorsed by senior executive of Union Development
Corporation who, like many Australian firms, choose Piper Twins
as outstanding value in luxury company transport.
Your Piper Dealer can show you why, and will do so gladly.
Why not ask him?

This is a miracle. Here is a
quart contained in a pint pot.
These photographs showthe
tiny heart of a mighty central
station refrigerated air con-
ditioning system together
with last year’s model.
It does the same job but it’s
smaller. And better. It is
easierto install and maintain,
it is half the weight and takes
up only one third of the
space. It is quieter, more
reliable, looks better and
behaves magnificently.
This sort of leadership in
design and performance is
the result of more than thirty
years experience in the air
conditioning industry. It
matches the tradition of an
organisation that builds fine
cars.

TOYOTA have built the Lite-Stout for those who want a
really tough, hard-working, truck-size ute that has sedan
car comfort for three passengers—truly rugged but refined.
Utilities made from passenger cars just can’t carry the
truck-type loads like the TOYOTA Lite-Stout—its big load
area carries more than a ton. TOYOTA’S tough 65 B.H.P.
engine is really reliable—with lots of torque low down to
pull the big loads easily.
Under normal working conditions, loaded to capacity,
Lite-Stout gives up to 28 miles per gallon—32 m.p.g. on
light loads. The big brakes with finned drums give more
braking and less fade under heavy loads than any truck
at any price.
Easy handling, panoramic curved windscreen and passen-
ger car ride bring an entirely new feel to truck driving.
At only £1,058, TOYOTA toughness in the chassis, solid
reliability in the motor, economy on the go, Lite-Stout
gives you more for your money than any utility on the road
today.
ITOVOTA
MOTOPj
See your TOYOTA dealer—he has what you want in trucks
.TOYOTA Lite-Stout is available with either steel tray
(List Price £955 plus tax), wooden tray (List Price £965
plus tax) or cab and chassis (List Price £BB5 plus tax).
Girder-type chassis makes Lite-Stout especially suitable
for mounting special bodies.

UtfiJuil
of a Nation
He is the man behind the scenes, the nation’s backroom boy . . .
the man on the land. He made it possible for his countrymen to
own cars, houses, refrigerators and the trappings of the day; he
forged and moulded the Australian way of life from the dry dust
of the inland.
It is in fact true that in this wide, brown continent, progress
doesn’t go to the dusty outback ... it starts there. For the
prosperity of our cities and of the men, women and children
who walk, work and play in them stems from a rich heritage
of wealth from the land.
Today, an all-time high has been reached in rural production
and the earnings it brings to the community at large. The annual
retail value of food production alone is about £l,lOO million,
amounting to 30% of total retail sales. Total rural export income
this year has broken all previous records and accounts for a
massive contribution of over £l,OOO million, or three quarters
of all exports from Australia.
But this is only part of the picture. Food production will loom
large in our future to satisfy our growing appetite and expanding
Asian markets. It is anticipated that our population will increase
by 2h million in the next ten years, and food consumption in
Australia will therefore increase by nearly 25%. Our present
exportable surplus of food is considered as sufficient to feed an
additional 3 million people, so that even in the short space of
10 years, Australia will be eating most of its food output, unless
greatly increased production is achieved.
Yet, new markets abroad are bright with promise . . . 3,000 tons
of sultanas and 2,500 tons of cheese to Japan, condensed milk
worth £925,000 to Burma, rice to Okinawa, a dawning big
potential for dairy foods in Asia.
And here a spectre hangs over an otherwise bright prospect.
Increasing demand for our products at home and abroad will
need the careful management of Australia’s one limited resource
. . . water. The burden of additional food production will rest
heavily on irrigated areas . . . water development will shape
the extent and pace of our progress.

National Notebook
The Horrors
Tn the light of the news that the Com-
monwealth Film Censorship Board
rejected 148 films in 1963-4, including
29 intended for TV, we made inquiries
into what TV censors really look for.
They watch, we learn, for these main
points: violence, sex or “difficult or con-
troversial” subjects (prostitution, crim-
inal abortion, drug addiction) and that
old bogey “horror”. Of these, says Act-
ing Chief Censor, Mr Pinfold, “violence
is definitely No. 1 on the black list.
I don’t think anyone wants violence,”
he says. “And in particular, in Australia,
there’s an aversion to the use of knives,
jagged bottles, violence of this kind.”
“All television stations have a respon-
sibility, irrespective of the censor, to-
wards their own programmes,” adds
Michael Callaghan, programme manager
of ATN. “We exercise an internal cen-
sorship, and where violence is concerned
we frequently make further cuts after
the programme has been passed by the
censor.”
“Some programmes from overseas fea-
ture violence for its own sake in a way
we don't approve of here,” says Mr Neil
Hutchison of the ABC. “But we have
no major inconvenience with the official
censors. Offhand I can’t think of any
specific case.” There’s a possibly apo-
cryphal story that the BBC serial ver-
sion of “Barnaby Rudge” was almost
rejected on the grounds that a tale of
the Gordon Riots might seem objection-
able in the light of contemporary moves
towards church unity.
“We've no real gripes about this sort
of censorship,” says R. Haynes. Assist-
ant Programme Director of TCN Chan-
nel 9. “We’ve had very few rejections
lately. Censorship is liberalised and
moving with the times. They understand
our problems and don't knock things
back without reason. Nowadays we get
things through without trouble that we
wouldn't have been game to submit five
or six years ago.”
The more outspoken programmes are
usually shown after 10 p.m., not because
the censors can enforce the late screen-
ing but because of a “gentleman’s agree-
ment'’ between the Broadcasting Control
Board and the television stations.
Fermenting the Pagans
“]\/|'y great-grandfather was a pagan
and worshipped Thunder; my
grandfather was born a pagan but died
with baptism; my parents are Catholics
and I was baptised as a two-davs-o!d
infant,” Alain Waeke Apau, a student
from the Catholic Seminary in Madang,
New Guinea, told us in Sydney last week.
Alain and three New Guinean stu-
dents from the Seminary (Michael Aike,
Alexius Holyweek and Peter Kurongku),
arrived in Australia three weeks ago with
Rector Father Patrick Murphy. “I
started school in my village at St Paul's,
Veifa’a, two years before the Second
World War. When the Japanese in-
vaded the Territory we forgot the nuns,”
said Alain. “Lizard hunting and bird
trapping were more interesting. 1 de-
cided to return to school when Austra-
lians and Americans passed through the
village and asked for interpreters. I
wanted to be an interpreter.”
Father Murphy told us: “These stu-
dents, all of whom have their Queens-
land senior certificate, speak English,
Latin, pidgin English, police motu and
their own village dialect, will be the
pioneers of a native secular clergy.” He
said the students had seen trains and
television for the first time on this trip.
When they graduate from the Madang
Seminary their job as priests, he said,
will be to ferment the pagan mass.
What Money Can Buy
nPHE other day we had an agreeable two
A hours or so on board the Swedish-
America line Kitngsholm in Sydney har-
bor. The Kungsholm is, like the Caronia,
a millionaire ship, and we were intrigued
to learn that a 90-day cruise of the Paci-
fic, which included such pleasures as a

visit to Auckland’s Ellerslie Racecourse
and the Sydney Town Hall, could cost a
couple as much as 9100 dollars plus
extras.
We scoured the plainly furnished pub-
lic rooms looking for some sign of what
all this money could buy in addition to
calls at such unfamiliar places as the
Marquesas and Bali. Before enjoying
luncheon in the saloon, we had a few
words with the ship’s social directress,
Mrs Dickason, who greeted us looking
slightly strained in sequined spectacles
after 18 hours of work and a midnight
to 4 a.m. stint on her personal correspon-
dence. On her way to dine with a Rocke-
feller, she ordered us a drink.
“I have a former Ambassador to Vene-
zuela and a former Ambassador to Uru-
guay aboard,” Mrs Dickason said in a
voice of understandable faintness. “Mrs
G. M. Slocum, publisher of the ‘Auto-
motive News’, a famous brain surgeon,

graphy . .
How did she keep the passengers
including 104 unaccompanied women
averaging 65—happy? “There is a bridge
instructor in charge of card games, and a
male dance team. We have dance classes
and exhibition dancing. And there's a
singer.” Modern or classical? “Semi. He's

Gone with Moby Dick
'T'he South Pacific’s first European in-
A dustry expired quietly at the end
of 1964. New Zealand's Tory Channel
whaling station in South Island, the last
of its kind in the country, closed down
and there is almost no prospect of it re-
opening. Depletion of humpback whale
stocks by illegal operators in the Antarc-
tic and the fall in price for sperm oil
means that whaling is no longer an
economic proposition in New Zealand
waters. Over the last year or so, only
Government assistance has kept it going.
The last North Island station—on
Great Barrier Island, in Auckland's
Hauraki Gulf went into voluntary
liquidation two years ago.
The industry began around 1792, just
twenty-three years after Cook's re-
discovery of New Zealand and forty-
eight years before the country was pro-
claimed a British colony. At its peak,
in the early part of the 19th century,
there were thirty to forty shore stations
in the North and South Islands; those
were the days when a notorious whale
named New Zealand Jack gave the
young Herman Melville an idea for a
novel that was eventually called “Moby
Dick’’. In fact, the story of whaling
and sealing in New Zealand is virtually
the story of European beginnings here,
and has special significance for the
Maori race —many of whom, today, can
claim descent from whalers who took
Maori wives. It was through the
whalers, rather than through the late-
coming Christian missionaries, that
Maoris learned the ways of European
civilisation. Some, not always willingly,
travelled the world in whaling ships;
and a few of these travellers, cast up in
Sydney, were befriended by the Rever-
end Samuel Marsden who soon deve-
loped an interest in the barbarous land
to the south-east.
It was the time when whalers and
their like were making a hell-hole of
the Bay of Islands, diminishing the
native community with drink and
disease. If ever there was a place to
save souls, Christian or heathen, it was
there—as Charles Darwin, a horrified
visitor, once testified. So there was a
peculiar historical aptness in the fact
that as the last whaling station in the
country closed up shop, Maori and
European were celebrating the 150th
anniversary of the arrival of Christianity
in New Zealand —still very much a
going concern —with the Rev R. E.
Marsden of Cornwall there to repeat the
Christmas sermon which his great-great-
grandfather Samuel delivered in the Bay
of Islands back in 1814. Simultaneously
a Maori clergyman was delivering the
same sermon in a distant Cornwall
parish. N
Even sister ships
npHERE were so many newcomers at
the Melbourne Motor Show. There
was the Austin Princess “R” with
the Rolls-Royce six-cylinder light alloy
engine. Speed, 113 m.p.h. Price, £3750.
It has the full treatment: Vanden Plas
body with the honor of having a tiny
chrome “R” on the boot. But one
couldn’t help but feel that Jaguar or
even Chrysler would have done better
with the styling. It looked rather like
a Humber in its Sunday best.
And even the little cars were picking
up in tone. A sister-ship to the Austin
Princess “R” was the Morris Princess
1100. This was the same shape as the
normal Morris 1100 but with the real
chocolate-box treatment and the same
engine as the 1100 MG. It had a Van-
den Plas body, walnut dashboard, sun
roof, drink trays, leather upholstery,
arm-rests, the lot, plus the same radiator
grille as the Austin Princess. Price,
£l7OO.
The Japanese staged a major assault
with six different manufacturers repre-
sented. The newest was the Isuzu
Bellet. It was worth going over there
just to take a pamphlet from the little
Japanese girl in national costume. The
Isuzu offered terrifying competition to
the other small cars at the show.
For only £950 they offered practically
sports car appearance, a top speed of
92, white-wall tyres and all sorts of
built-in non-extras. And as the Japanese
always like to do, they put on display
their amazing standard tool kit of 17
items, including even a tyre pressure
gauge.
The range of new cars we hadn’t
seen before was amazing, all sorts of
Lancias, Alfas, Ferraris, and a new six-
cylinder 130 m.p.h. Porsche worth
£4850. The new Rover 2000 was there
for £2275, very un-Roverish in appear-
ance, but yet the styling still doesn't
quite come off. Except inside. Here
there were bucket seats front and back in
black hide. Indeed in the smartest rac-
ing tradition there was no color any-

AUSTRALIA GOES TO WAR
ffitfeuCletin
80 Years Ago: February 21, 1885
Tt was in one of his inspired
moments that the NSW Premier,
Mr Dailey, made the famous offer of
troops for service in the Soudan.
El Mahdi and his fanatic followers
had captured Khartoum. From all
lands where the English tongue is
spoken offers of military assistance
reached London. New South Wales
was the first in the field. The colonial
enthusiasm evoked by the tender of
military assistance, and by its accep-
tance, is significant. It shows the
existence and vigor of a sentiment
which many doubt and some deny—
the sense of the essential unity of the
British Empire.
Nevertheless, we think the offer
was not sufficiently considered. To
begin with, a proposal was made to
land an infantry force of 500 men in
the Soudan in a few weeks. But we
have no such force to land—at least,
no disciplined one. England, France,
and Germany find that to make an
effective infantry soldier requires at
least two years’ constant training. In
a few weeks we can, and probably
will, land the promised force of
armed men at Suakim, but they will
not be soldiers. No general who had
highly-organised troops at his dis-
posal would risk a reverse by send-
ing Australians to the front. All
Australia would be mortified on
learning that their contingents were
guarding safe positions while their
British comrades were doing the real
fighting.
Why did England accept? It could
not be because she required help.
There is but one reasonable answer
and it lies on the surface. The Im-
perial Cabinet had it forced upon
them that Australians were sore over
the German Pacific annexations. A
chance of soothing the ruffled feel-
ings of the colonists was looked for.
Such a chance unexpectedly offered
itself when Mr Dailey sent his now
famous telegram. To reject might be
considered churlish, although accep-
tance brought no real strength. It
flattered antipodean amour propre,
and—Australia goes to war.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Mount Isa's Death Rattle
Watching Mt Isa’s death rattle last
” week it became clear that the
original grievances in the dispute had
long been forgotten in fact most
of them had been rectified and that
we were witnessing a lapse into mob
neurosis by a group of isolated, frus-
trated and manipulated mineworkers
whose actions now bore little relation
to their own needs.
The symptoms were real enough,
however bizarre. As The Bulletin
pointed out a fortnight ago, the
miners stood to gain almost nothing by
remaining on strike. Arbitration had
won them an increase o| £3 a week
as well as considerable improvements
in contract prices. It had also estab-
lished a simplified grievance procedure
which would speed up the handling
of future disputes. Yet despite these
gains the majority voted against a
return to work, in what was only one
in a series of self-destructive acts in
which the hot-gospeller of defiance,
Mr Pat Mackie, was the central figure.
It is no longer clear when Mackie
is exploiting the frustrations and ten-
sion of the miners, or when he
himself is being exploited by the Com-
munists. But since he is clearly only
a real power as long as the miners
are out of work, the question of his
reinstatement is partly bogus. He can
have no real interest in being re-
instated. But the issue is being used
just as the other “grievances” in the
dispute were used.
To begin with, there were some
justifiable grievances the anomalies
of the Queensland State Industrial
Conciliation and Arbitration Act of
1961. This showed the ineptness and
inexperience of the Queensland Gov-
ernment, more suited to dealing with a
rural economy than an industrial com-
plex of the Mt Isa type. It left the
miners feeling cheated of benefits at
a time when the price of base metals
was rising on the world market. Since
then the Queensland Government
seems to have learned little. Its lack
of understanding of what was happen-
ing in Mt Isa was shown in the way
it introduced the emergency decrees,
which, however desperate Mr Nick-
lin’s Government may have felt the
situation to be, made matters worse
in every way. It provided another ex-
cuse for emotion, in an already
emotionally charged atmosphere,
where leadership, not force, was
needed. It lost more standing when
its emergency regulations were com-
pletely ineffective and were abandon-
ed. They simply served to fortify the
stockade mentality eagerly cultivated
by the Mackie-Communist axis.
The Australian Workers’ Union has
also shown itself unable to handle
large-scale disputes in secondary in-
dustry. Mt Isa has shown the AWU
bureaucracy to be too centralised and
too cut-off from the centre of a dis-
pute like this one. Its differences with
the local Trades and Labor Council
cannot hide the fact that many of
their own members in Mt Isa felt that
the Brisbane-centred AWU had failed
to understand their problems.
HThe company itself, losing £1 million
a week and the fruits of years of
enterprise, remained the most “face-
less” of all the participants. Except
for advertisements in the newspapers,
Mount Isa Mines remained correctly
neutral when it could surely have
communicated some greater sense of
urgency about what the strike was
costing Queensland and Australia as
a whole. It could also have shown
a greater willingness to take or offer
initiatives, even unorthodox ones, to
settle the matter.
Nevertheless, although none of the
interested parties is free from some
blame, the fact remains that the Mt
Isa disaster would not have happened
at all if the Communists had not found
in Mackie a perfect tool to change a
dispute into an exercise in the mani-
pulation of hysteria. And hysteria is
the only word. When Mackie left Mt
Isa for Melbourne, for example, his
supporters who saw him off included
grown men who had bought baseball
caps and dyed them red, who wore
Mackie’s brand of jeans and the same
brown leather boots. To add to the un-
reality, in Melbourne, on the same day
that the Mount Isa men voted not to go
back to work, Mackie was actually ad-
dressing the congregation at St. Luke's
Church in Dr J. F. Cairns’ electorate
of Richmond, with Dr Cairns among
the worshippers. Back in Mt Isa any-
one who talked of returning to work,
in view of the miners’ successes, was
called a “scab” and the manager of the
local radio station was assaulted when
he planned to broadcast an appeal by
a Lutheran minister asking the men
to return to work.
The source of Mackie’s power
clearly rests on the breakdown of
normal society in Mt Isa, the increas-
ing sense of bitter isolation from the
rest of the country that the remaining
miners feel, and the atmosphere of
intimidation in which all important
decisions are taken.
Whether a secret ballot at this late
stage would lead to any different result
may be doubtful but it must be tried.
Whether calling in an industrial com-
missioner from another State who has
had experience of mining disputes and
would be able better to understand
the peculiar problems involved may
also be too late a move to change the
impasse but it, too, must be tried.
There is one major mistake which
must be avoided and that is the rein-
stating of Mackie (unless it be by the
normal processes of arbitration). To
reinstate him as the price for a solu-
tion became too high a price the
moment it became a threat to the ar-
bitration system, which it was always
intended to be.
The strike has already cost £3O
million and untold hardship. Yet that
would be nothing compared to the
cost of breaking up the arbitration
procedures and setting a precedent for
every future dispute, not just in
Queensland but throughout the
country.
This is a particular threat to any dev-
elopment programme for Australia’s
north where the same potentially
hysterical ingredients as exist in Mount
Isa difficult working conditions,
harsh climate, a mixture of nation-
alities with different histories of ex-
tremism, frustration and internal ven-
dettas, a huge investment of capital,
and a key national industry are
likely to be repeated with men like
Mackie recklessly sacrificing a whole
town’s livelihood for their own am-
bition. There can be no compromise
with Mackie.


THIS AUSTRALIA
The Church of England’s
Real Estate
“L. J. Hooker should make a takeover offer!”
SYDNEY — Property developers who
complained about the credit squeeze
may gain some consolation from the
Report, released last week, of the 14-
man Commission under the chairman-
ship of the Sydney accountant Mr F. E.
Trigg, appointed by the Anglican Arch-
bishop of Sydney to inquire into the
Sydney Diocese’s organisation, property
and finances: The Church’s Diocesan
organisations of Sydney (excluding
parishes) earned only 1.3 per cent last
financial year on 160 acres of property
whose improved capital value is £7.4
million.
Any property developer with 40
acres on the west side of Glebe Road
near Sydney University would normally
make a fortune . . . but not if those
properties had been on 99 years’ lease
at ground rents which today are ludi-
crous. Worse than that, the Anglican
Church failed to insist on the covenants
that the properties (most of them sub-
standard cottages) should be kept in
tenantable condition. The result has
been that the cottages, when reverting
to the Church, become a liability
because they must be repaired.
Again, the two acres of land adjoin-
ing Town Hall Station, the site of St
Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, is a
“choice” bit of land to stimulate the
gastric juices of a property developer,
but the Anglican Church hasn't done so
well with it. The western half at the
rear of the Cathedral, was resumed, and
£lOO,OOO compensation received. This
money was invested in Commonwealth
Bonds, which now stand at £88,480
and provide an annual interest return
of £4831.
There are, of course, rents of £2OOO
a year received from the City of Sydney
and county councils, but these rep-
resent a yield of only 1.03 per cent on
the improved capital value of £195,000
attributed to that part of the site
occupied by the councils.
It is no wonder that the Report of the
Commission urgently recommends vigor-
ous redevelopment of the Church's real
estate. One method suggested is to form
companies on the same basis as that
adopted by the successful Church Com-
missioners for England (which registered
the Church Estates Development and
Improvement Co. in 1956 and sub-
sequently formed a further 27 companies
to carry out development projects). If a
company is formed in Australia for this
purpose, it will not be a public company
Church of England property, at Glebe Pt. Road, Sydney
Dr H. GOUGH
and investors will not get a chance to
subscribe.
To rescue some of its uneconomic
property investments, the Diocese has
been buying back leases in the Glebe
area. This takes time and no spectacular
results are expected for a while.
The Commission’s report also stresses
the need to establish the Sydney
Diocesan Investment Trust to provide
the means for better investment. More,
it recommends that the Commissioners
of this investment trust must be skilled
and experienced in this specialised work
and must have complete freedom of
action. To cover this contingency, the
Commission recommends that laymen
should be used.
In following a reinvestment policy,
the Commission asserts that no longer
should the Diocese be content to invest
the bulk of its money in fixed interest
securities, which sometimes are referred
to as gilt-edged securities. It must em-
bark on a policy of investment in sound
equity shares listed on the stock ex-
change in expectation that capital may
grow, enhance in value, and produce an
increase in income.
Naturally, the Commission recognises
that the Church policy will not approve
the investment of funds in certain types
of companies (such as breweries, poker
machine manufacturers?) but it urges
that the Standing Committee should give
a clear direction on what type of invest-
ment must be excluded.
It also criticises the complicated
borrowing arrangements which permit
parishes and diocesan organisations to
make their own financial arrangements,
particularly the borrowing of money for
capital expenditure. Much of it is un-
economic and the Commission points
out that the proposed Investment Trust
could in time become the banker and
lender within the Diocese. This is not
unusual, because it is understood the


Catholic Church Trust Fund also lends
funds within its own group.
In fact, if balance sheets of the two
religious organisations could be com-
pared, it might be revealed that the
Catholic Church has its house very much
in financial order. Many of its property
arrangements also incite admiration, in-
cluding one story concerning ownership
of a property for a farthing a year, sub-
let on a 99-year lease.
Certainly the Catholic Church has
proved itself no mean competitor in pro-
perty development and its captive share-
holders present a remarkably successful
example to the Anglican Church if it is
seeking new investment techniques.
On the score of property ownership,
growth of Catholic property around
Sydney shows that the sites are judicious-
ly spread and will benefit, from any city
redevelopment plans. On the score of
re-sale value, certainly some of the
properties owned by the Church of Eng-
land in Sydney would fetch a tidy sum.
The property owned in the St Mark’s
area, Darling Point, has an ICV of
£573,700 but the net income return of
£4985 represents only 0.85 p.c. on the
improved capital value. The St James’
glebe in Edgecliff and Waverley presents
a similar sorry picture where a return
of only 0.41 p.c. (or £8860) is achieved
on property with an ICV of £2.1 mil-
lion.
The investment picture, although
slightly healthier, is not spectacular. A
summary of investments totalling £1.4
million held by the Church of England
Property Trust at December, 1961 (in-
cluding investments held on behalf of
parishes), showed an average earning rate
of 4.79 p.c. per annum. A total of
£48,828 was invested in ordinary shares
to yield 8.35 p.c. Later figures are un-
available but Mr F. E. Trigg, a Sydney
accountant who is a member of the
Commission, says there has been no im-
provement.
On 1961 assets of £lO.B million, in-
cluding £1.4 million of investments and
£B.3m. of real estate, the Diocese show-
ed investment income and bank interest
of only £95,734 yet paid out interest of
£60,857. Its rents, on all that real estate,
came to a mere £137,819. No wonder
the Commission cites the success story
of the Church Commissioners in Eng-
land after they took over in 1948.
On figures like these the L. J. Hooker
Investment Corporation undoubtedly
should consider a takeover offer!
CIVIL AVIATION
Dubbo the Guinea Pig
"W here the hell’s our airline?"
DUBBO The decision of the
Dubbo Chamber of Commerce last week
to take independent legal action on the
airlines dispute introduced a new and
unexpected note to this months-old con-
troversy. Dubbo has been without a
direct air service to Sydney since last
October. Dubbo, which formerly enjoyed
three direct services to and from Sydney
each day, now has only a once-daily in-
direct service via Canberra —a service
maintained by Airlines of NSW at a sub-
stantial loss.
The High Court decision on the dis-
pute, handed down earlier this month,
ruled that NSW intrastate air services
must have both State and Common-
wealth licences before they can operate.
The State Government will not issue
Airlines of NSW with a licence to oper-
ate the service, and the Commonwealth
Government refuses to grant East-West
Airlines a licence, thus creating an im-
passe which can only be resolved by
further litigation, or by political com-
monsense —notably lacking in the dis-
pute to date.
Tired of Dubbo being made the un-
willing guinea pig in this political tug-
of-war between Sydney and Canberra,
the Dubho Chamber of Commerce de-
cided that it was time to force a show-
down. At a meeting last week the
Chamber instructed its executive to seek
opinion of counsel as to whether it
could take legal action to have the
Dubbo service restored. Members of
the Chamber believe that it would be
possible to take out an injunction against
the State Government calling on it to
show cause why it should not re-issue
a provisional licence to Airlines of NSW
to operate the Dubbo service, pending
settlement of legal aspects of the dispute.
Many members of the Dubbo Cham-
ber are known to be in favor of the
State Government's rationalisation plan
and to be as anti-Ansett as any Labor
politician, but this is not the point at
issue in Dubbo any more. The way the
dispute is shaping it seems that this could
continue almost indefinitely—and this is
what has infuriated Dubbo, the almost
complete indifference of State and
Federal politicians.
Unlike newspapers in many country
towns. Dubbo's two papers, “The Daily
Liberal” and the “Dubbo Dispatch” have
never aligned themselves with any politi-
cal party, preserving strict neutrality on
major political issues. Neither paper
has championed the cause of Airlines
J. RENSHAW
of NSW in the air dispute, but both
have been strongly critical of the way
the State Government has handled the
whole issue. In a front-page editorial last
week, the “Dispatch” strongly endorsed
the action taken by ihe Chamber of Com-
merce and then .added: “Up until the
time of the High Court decision, no one
really blamed Mr Renshaw for the
strong attitude he adopted. No one, ex-
cept the interested parties and a few
others, cared whether Airlines of NSW
or East-West operated the route, so long
as we had an air service as good as it
had been in the past. But, with the
Court’s verdict given we were entitled
to expect immediate clarification of the
issue and resumption of the service by
one or another of the operators. But all
that is happening is that Mr Renshaw is
sitting back and gleefully announcing the
State has won. If that’s the case, Jack,
where the hell’s our airline?”
The political implications of the dis-
pute for the Labor Party are now becom-
ing very clear. The Dubbo State elec-
torate has always been regarded as a
“swing seat” having been held in turn
by Labor, Country Party and the
Liberals in the last 15 years. Only the
strong personal following of the late
Les Ford, Mayor of Dubbo up to the
time of his sudden death in December,
had made the seat safe for the Liberals.
Deprived of the large personal vote
which Les Ford could always expect to
command, the Liberals could easily lose
the seat and normally Labor would have
been given an excellent chance of "re-
gaining it. Political observers in Dubbo,
however, now give Labor little chance of
success in view of the strong local feel-
ings over the airline dispute, and they
say the battle for the seat will be
fought out between the Liberal and
Country Party candidates.

AWU
Rigged Ballot?
Fishing for votes
ADELAIDE Evidence of irregu-
larities in the recent AVVU poll in SA
has been given to the Commonwealth
Industrial Court in Adelaide in an
attempt to have the recent AWU poll
declared void. Mr A. K. Sangster, QC,
for the defeated State secretary, Mr
E. R. O'Connor, asked the Chief Judge
of the Industrial Court, Sir John
Spicer, to order a new court-controlled
ballot because of alleged irregularities.
Miss Roma Mitchell, QC, for the State
branch of the AWU, and Don Cameron,
admitted irregularities.
In the recent AWU ballot, the Left-
winger Don Cameron, brother of Clyde
Cameron, MHR, defeated O'Connor tor
secretaryship and Cameron's supporters
gained control of the Union. Six mem-
bers of the Gawler special railway gang
told the court that their AWU job repre-
sentative issued them with membership
tickets from which the voting coupons
were missing. The representative said he
had removed the coupons, attached them
to a number of ballot papers, and filled
them out in favor of Cameron and his
supporters. Seven members of the En-
counter Bay District Council gang gave
evidence that their AWU representative
filled out their ballot papers for them.
Miss Mitchell contended that if these
were the only irregularities she would
ask for the matter to be closed because
votes involved would not affect the out-
come of the ballot. Cameron defeated
O'Connor, secretary for the past 14 years,
by 720 votes and the closest election was
for AWU convention delegates wffiere
the lowest votes for an elected candi-
date was 363 more than the highest for
the defeated candidate.
A parcel of mutilated ballot papers,
allegedly fished from Port River and
mailed anonymously to the AWU office,
was used as evidence by Mr Sangster. The
papers, which were slashed in the corner
where voting coupons w'ere fixed, all
apparently recorded votes for O'Connor.

Victoria, NSW and South Australia
have new universities planned. Victoria
also intends to switch some of its senior
technical schools into degree-granting in-
stitutions. But the odds are still heavily
against the planners: they have inherited
a formidable legacy of myopic planning
and parsimony. The demand for tertiary
education has risen sharply in the last
few years and besides population in-
creases in younger age groups the im-
portant factor has been the rise in the
proportion of students continuing their
schooling. This is sorely afflicting the
secondary schools and is increasingly
affecting the universities. Not only are
employers expecting higher qualifications
but education is also becoming more and
more prized for its own sake.
Quotas may not drastically affect the
supply of highly trained people in most
professions. They do, however, seriously
affect the teaching profession which
needs large numbers of average gradu-
ates, and they reduce the chance of a
general tertiary education. Significantly,
exclusions are highest in Arts, Economics
and Commerce the “easier” subjects.
The statistics of exclusion are not a rer
liable indication of the demand for ter-
tiary education. They do not show how
many decided on other careers rather
than attempt the obstacles of university
selection.
IMMIGRATION
All-Black?
"No passports needed ”
SYDNEY - When is a New Zea-
lander a New Zealander? This question
of citizenship arose last week when Aus-
tralian immigration officials refused a 21-
year-old Cook Islander, Nooroa Tuaiti
(who is a British subject and a New
Zealand citizen), permission to land in
Sydney because he had no New Zealand
passport. Tuaiti, who arrived in the ship
Oriental Queen, and accompanied by two
Australians, Mr G. O'Bryan and Mr T.
Mullholland of NSW, was returned on
the same ship two days later.
However emphatic the Australian im-
migration officials were about the islander
requiring a passport, the New Zealand
Internal Affairs Department was equally
emphatic that Tuaiti was legally a New
Zealand citizen and did not require a
passport. In fact, the department will con-
duct an inquiry into the incident within
a few days. In Wellington last week, the
Minister for Internal Affairs, Mr Seath,
said no passports were needed by New
Zealanders travelling only to Australia.
Mr Seath was not aware of any change
of policy on the part of the Australian
Government. Messrs Mullholland and
O'Bryan said New Zealand immigration
officials told Tuaiti that no passport was
needed.
In Auckland, however, the Australian
Trade Commissioner, Mr J. A. Morey,
said residents of New Zealand island ter-
ritories were required to produce a pass-
port before they could be considered for
entry into Australia even though they
were New Zealanders according to New
Zealand law. “This man,” he said,
“should have taken his birth certificate to
the Internal Affairs Department, been
issued with a passport, and brought it
to me.” The application for an entry
permit would then have been considered.
This procedure did not apply to Maoris.
Asked why Tuaiti was permitted to
leave New Zealand without the necessary
documents, an Internal Affairs official
said no differentiation was made between
islanders and Maoris. “As far as we are
concerned they are New Zealanders,” he
said.

SUMMER SCHOOL
Journalists’ Bromides
Undermining ihe cliches
CANBERRA Launched in 1910,
the Australian Journalists’ Association
has largely concentrated on industrial
issues. So when David Robertson, of
the “Daily Telegraph”, secretary of the
AJA’s Canberra District (so poor that
it cannot afford office rent) pressed for
a summer school of Professional
Journalism, his colleagues were polite
but doubtful.
Yet, instead of the 50 or so locals
hoped for, 154 journalists from all over
Australia turned up and listened for two
days to six speakers. In groups they dis-
cussed issues pretty remote from the
standard bread-and-butter policies until
deep into the night. It may be that our
journalists have a strong masochistic
streak, for, with the exception of a
charming, lightweight survey of the his-
tory of journalism by Frank S. Greenop
of “The Reader’s Digest”, all the speak-
ers were pretty depressing.
W. J. Hudson, formerly of “The
Courier-Mail”, now a Ph.D. candidate
at the ANU, stressed the poor education,
middling pay, limited career opportuni-
ties and lack of independence of
journalists. W. R. Olsen, of “The Aus-
tralian” painted a grim picture of future
papers, produced in an automated
office, emerging from a TV set. Only the
large contingent of public relations
people sat securely; the others saw their
jobs crumbling away.
The Canberra correspondent of “The
Age”, R. J. Bennetts, the
first survey ever of the cadet (appren-
tice) system for young journalists, and
made it clear that it was in a mess. His
paper led to a lot of tough-sounding talk
about how the AJA should stand up
to the proprietors. But the men in the
game must have known that, on some
papers, there are every year 350-400
applicants for the 4-5 cadet jobs offering.
/I lan Reid, political commentator for
the “Daily Telegraph” and The
Bulletin and for whom frequent
scoops are as necessary as drugs to an
addict, seemed, with his nicotine-stained
fingers and slightly hoarse voice, to have
stepped straight from Front Page. (Even
his suit, immaculately hand-crafted, did
not fit properly.) But he aroused a good
deal of hostility. He was much too frank
for his audience in his able, if one-
sided defence of private enterprise in the
Press. The journalist's role, he said, was
to make the bricks, while others decided
the shape of the construction. Reid
was pretty brutal, and the audience, fed
for decades on endless comforting
though futile cliches about “ethics”,
“conscience”, and “responsibility”, did
not relish what it heard.
It is hard to know whether Reid or As-
sociate Professor Henry Mayer of Syd-
ney University evoked more hostility. It
may be that Mayer, less urbane, colder,
and more analytical than Reid, just man-
aged to annoy most listeners more inten-
sely. It was not so much his main theme —
that higher education was the only wea-

There were groans when the professor
argued that even if journalists were more
independent than they are now, papers
might get worse —for it may be that it
is not a case now of good men's potential
being kept back by the chains of the
boss, but rather of mediocre men being
kept up to the mark.
It was pretty clear that many journa-
lists are dissatisfied with their lot, but
don’t know what to do. Otherwise, why
the strong hostility to the PR people; the
pretence that they, with more leisure,
more money, and less irregular hours—
were just yearning to return to the “real”
world of daily deadlines?
The mere fact that journalists are will-
ing to talk in fairly abstract terms these
days is a big step forward. But their
thinking, conditioned by decades of plea-
sant bromides,, is still rather woolly.
Next time the AJA may get some over-
seas people and tough managers to join
in. Anything which helps to clear up
the illusions of the craft and undermine
the folklore with which it is shot through
would be a step forward.

Sickening Isa
The masterminds
BRISBANE —The headlines screamed:
“Isa To Become Ghost Town” . . . “Com-
plete Shutdown” . . . “Isa Doomed”. And
at Mt Isa, the centre of Queensland’s
richest industry, copper and lead, the
real exodus began. This was.the picture
last week of a great industrial stalemate.
The Queensland public no longer sides in
the 26-week-long dispute and is sickened
by the tremendous losses suffered by
Mount Isa Mines Limited and Queens-
land, and the huge changing hands of
shares in the company at slashed prices.
To this has been added announcements
by firms in Bowen and Maryborough and
other parts of the State, dependent on
Mount Isa, that they will have to put
men off.
When Mount Isa Mines Limited Gen-
eral Manager Mr J. W. Foots announced
last week that all operations on the mine
site except power, water and safety ser-
vices would close down, the Queensland
Cabinet made a surprising announcement
simply asking the company to be “on the
ready” to open the mine. However, late
last week, the State Industrial Commis-
sioner, H. J. Harvey, made a dramatic
move which could have great impact on
the dispute. On his own initiative, Com-
missioner Harvey issued an order re-
staining Mount Isa Mines Limited from
suspending any agreement under which
contractors employed labor on the mine.

This action was taken only three hours
before the 700 contract employees at Mt
Isa were to have finished work. The order
was to operate until Tuesday this week.
The fact that the company is losing
£1 million a week, and that hundreds are
out of work at Mount Isa, seemed to be
waved aside by the Treasurer, Mr Hurley
(deputising for the Premier, Mr Nicklin,
in hospital for a minor operation). He
proclaimed that the Government did not
regard disciplinary action as an answer
to the dispute, when other avenues were
open. Most of these seemed to have been
exhausted by last week. As the dispute
lengthens and widens something has
come sharply into focus—the State
Government’s naivete, when dealing with
involved industrial matters.
The Federal President of the AWU,
Mr Edgar Williams, last week made his
first real public comment on the long
dispute. He claimed that Pat Mackie,
the miners’ unofficial leader, had become
a martyr, and that he had martyred
everyone else along with himself. Mr
Williams, who twice was howled out of
Mt Isa by the miners, mentioned the
Communist influence in the dispute and
said that his Union was prepared to fight
Communism anywhere. He said that
AWU members in the sugar industry
would not be “suckered” by infiltrating
Communists, but that the Mt Isa miners
(all AWU members) had been “enticed”.
Mr Williams labelled the Northern Dis-
trict Organiser of the Amalgamated
Engineering Union, Mr Fred Thompson,
who is a Communist, as being the
“mastermind” in the Isa dispute. Then
Mr Williams seemed almost to wash his
hands clean of the dispute when he said
that “only time” would tell if the AWU
had “lost face” over Mt Isa.
A nother thing to emerge, clearly, from
dispute last week was that the
Queensland Trades and Labor Council
has only a slender grip on the Isa's
miners. The Council’s president, Mr J.
Egerton, sharply rebuked Mr J. Mc-
Mahon, head of the Mount Isa Trades
and Labor Council at a compulsory
unions - management conference last
week for saying that the miners would
not return to work until Mackie was re-
employed. Mr Egerton said that he
would not be a party to coercive tactics.
But the miners at their vote-taking meet-
ing backed Mr McMahon’s view.
Late last week Queensland and Com-
monwealth Security police were check-
ing evidence that the Communist Party,
over the last fortnight, had started an
all-out bid to take over control of the
Mt Isa dispute. The suggestion that the
Federal Government might intervene in
the dispute seems unlikely unless the
Queensland Government passed a spe-
cial emergency law. Meanwhile, the
dreadful dispute stumbles on.


The Freedom Riders
“I wish l was jet-black ”
By SAM LIPSKI
It used to be one of the rooms in
Wood Coffill’s funeral parlors at the
top of George Street, Sydney. Now,
still musty and cold on a midsummer
night, it echoed to the souped-up electric
guitars of an Aboriginal band practising
for the next dance at what is now the
headquarters of Sydney s Foundation for
Aboriginal Affairs. The sound wafted
through an open window upstairs, where
Mr Bill Ford, a lecturer in economics
at the University of New South Wales,
was preaching a religion new to Aus-
tralia.
“Don’t any of you go into this tour
with preconceived ideas about what
you're going to face. When the first
Freedom Riders came down from Cali-
forma to the Deep South there were
3000 police and troops ready to greet
them when the 13 of them got tiere.

Passive resistance works in some kinds
of situations, but it doesn't in others.
Obviously it wouldn't have done the
Jews very much good against the Nazis.
But it did work with Gandhi in India
and it is working with students and
Negroes in the Deep South.” He was
talking from personal experience having
been "an observer with the Freedom
Riders while an exchange student in
the United States.
At first the group he was addressing
was to be known as SNVCC pro-
nounced “Snick” and standing for
“Students’ Non-Violent Co-ordinating
Committee”. Then for a short time it
was FRO pronounced “fro"’ and stand-
ing for “Freedom Riders Organisation"
and now the audience of 35 students
from Sydney University were members
of SAFA, pronounced either Saffa or
Safer and standing tor Student Action
lor Aborigines . Clearly, from what Bill
Ford was telling them, moie than just
the name of this group, now touring
Aboriginal communities in the north
and north-east of New South Wales
and the south of Queensland conducting
surveys and staging demonstrations,
owed its inspiration to the American
racial experience. The new towns were
to be Bowraville, Wilcannia and Kemp-
S ey, but the tactics were Birmingham,
Jackson and Tuscaloosa.

gated bar and someone pushes someone
else aside and a brawl starts—weTT, you’ve
lost everything. You've got to have disci-

strating all over the place. Pick out one or
two key centres and make sure you've got
the camera on you. Remember, a pas-
sive demonstration is the most effective.
Any violence and you’ve defeated your
own purpose."
The links with the United States go
further. The very existence of SAFA
stems almost directly from the protests
by Sydney University students against
segregation in the Deep South in May,
1964. Those protests outside the Ameri-
can Consulate in Wvnyard Street ended
brawls with the police which made
headline news all over Australia and
which received wide publicity abroad.
But students found themselves damned

campaigning for civil rights to the

group’s membership and ideas changed
as the year progressed and by the end
of 1964 it was agreed that in addition
to demonstrations the group would
undertake a survey of Aboriginal con-
ditions in some twelve towns covering
housing, education, health, employment,
sochl welfare, and racial attitudes
among both Aborigines and whites.
Just how much weight should be given
to the survey as compared with the de-
monstration was the main source of
open dissent within SAFA. Members
based largely around the Student
Christian Movement tried to postpone
the idea of demonstrations altogether
for a year. When they were over-
whelmingly defeated on this they moved
to give the survey more emphasis. In
the end a compromise was reached by
which the “Freedom Ride” is now, in
theory at least, to give equal emphasis
to both the survey and the demonstra-
tions.
The other source of dissent was not
so obvious on the surface but at one
stage it could have wrecked the whole
idea. Supported from the beginning by
the whole range of political, religious,
and general societies, at Sydney Univer-
sity, SAFA found itself floundering for
enough students to come on the tour
in the last week. It looked for a few
days as if members of the Communist-
supported Eureka Youth League would
be able to have a totally disproportion-
ate number of students on the tour.
SAFA had never introduced any
screening methods—any student who
came along and paid his deposit had to
be accepted. But there had been a
tacit understanding among the organi-
sers of the tour that any takeover by
extremists whether of the larrikin or
political type would leave the group
wide open to being labelled.
Faced with the possibility of an EYL
influx, SAFA’s secretary, Mr Jim Spigel-
man, made it clear that he and Chairman
Charles Perkins would not stand for
any stacking of the tour and were able
to discourage most of the EYL members
from enrolling.
As the coach takes them on their 1390-
mile trip through NSW, the declared
aims of SAFA are to arouse public
attention to fundamental Aboriginal
problems in health, education and
housing; to break down socially dis-
criminatory barriers to the extent pos-
sible by student actions; and to stimu-
late the interest of Aborigines in
resisting discrimination. How likely
are the students to go anywhere near
achieving these aims and what signifi-
cance is there in SAFA? Perhaps the
best way of getting close to an answer
is to see SAFA in terms more of what
it will do for students than what it will
achieve immediately for Aborigines.
The idea of a “freedom ride” even
in its present form is unrelated to Aus-
tralian conditions but at least it is an
act of commitment by the students to
some tangible social ideal—the better-
ment of the Aborigines’ position. The
students plan to demonstrate in Bow-
raville, NSW, where they allege there
is discrimination in picture theatres,
cafes and other public facilities. They
will also demonstrate in other towns
where they believe discrimination exists,
such as at the swimming pool at Kemp-
sey, depending on what they find when
they get there.
But they are obviously on the tour
with a different expectation than Ameri-
can students. They are not going so
much to right a social injustice, the form
of which is clear and known, as to find
out what form the problem takes.
There are, however, some parallels with
the American experience. Bill Ford
claims that the civil rights movement in
the United States has given the youth of
America some sense of social involve-
ment, a cause, and a feeling that they
don’t have to be 35 before anything they-
do makes a difference to society.
Not all the student members of SAFA
agree that their tour is likely to make
Aborigines feel that change is possible.
They hope it will —but they point to the
fact that, with the exception of Charles
Perkins, the student harbingers of change
and hope are all white. In the United
States the dynamism for the freedom
riders was supplied largely by Negro
university students themselves. How deep
an impression will white university
students make in NSW country towns? So
much depends on their tact and ability to
win the confidence of Aborigines, many
of whom are tired of the Press photo-
graphers posing their half-naked swollen-
bellied children on garbage tins, ashamed
of the way their squalor is exploited for
publicity, and sensitive to their shabbi-
ness being exposed.
Yet, with all the difficulties the stu-
dents potentially do represent a force
for change. What kind of a force and
where it fits into the pattern of forces
changing the conditions of Australia’s
100.000 Aborigines has to be considered
against the background of developments
over the past 18 months the
legislative reforms, the gradual growth
of racial identity among the Aborigines
themselves, the emergence of Aboriginal
leadership in sensitive positions, the
activities of organisations concerned
with Aborigines, the upsurge in research
and academic concern with Aborigines
and the increasing international and
political interest in their problems. The
last 18 months have seen a series of
drastic legislative changes, which, with
some exceptions, now means that all
discriminatory laws have been removed.
Many of these legislative changes are
largely nullified in the Northern Terri-
tory and in parts of Queensland and
Western Australia where the fact that
most Aborigines do not receive the
wages of the white man makes many
of the changes seem hollow concessions
to inevitable progress.
The N. Aust. Worker’s Union is dedi-
cated to change this change, threatening
to bring the whole Territory out on strike
if the cattlemen and the Government do
not concede their claims by July 1. In
Western Australia, the legislative changes,
especially those allowing Aborigines to
drink, seem to have made life even more
nasty, brutish and short than it ever was.
Against the predictions of the hopeful
reformers the Aborigine continues to
prostitute his women and, as if to spite
the do-gooders, loses himself in dirt,
drink, and disease. If any State needed
an organisation like SAFA then clearly
it is Western Australia.
However enlightened the legislation in
any State its success will always depend
not on the statute makers but on the
clerks who hand out the social service
payments, the health inspectors who
visit Aboriginal homes, the hotel keep-
ers who serve colored drinkers. In large
measure the public servants, the hotel-
keepers, the store proprietors, the poten-
tial emloyers are carrying out the letter
of the law but the Aborigine is less con-
vinced that they are fulfilling its spirit.
Extremely sensitive to any imagined
slight the Aborigine is only slowly
making use of his new-found rights. To
a large extent this is also due to his
own ignorance of what they are and
how they operate. But whatever the
problems associated with implementing
the legislation, the removal of legal dis-
crimination is clearly a necessary first
step before there can be any other
change.
In Sydney and, to a lesser extent, in
Melbourne, there is a growing sense of
racial identification as Aborigines
from all over the State keep moving in
These are some of the questions
the “Freedom Riders” will ask
Whites.
The Aborigines are morally in-
ferior to most other people, do you
agree?
Aborigines do not know the value
of money do you agree?
Aborigines are just as loyal to
the country in which they live as
any other citizens- —do you agree?
The Aboriginal problem has been
much exaggerated. Do you agree
with this?
Would you welcome an Abo-
riginal neighbor in your street?
Do you think white people are
happier than Aborigines?


in increasing numbers, crowding into
the same suburbs, drinking in the same
hotels, meeting at the same clubs and
organisations. When the Kenyan
leader, Mr Tom Mboya, was in Australia
he said he was most struck by the almost
complete lack of “nationalism” among
the Aborigines. Certainly nationalism
in African terms is still remote and may
never come to the Aborigine. But Aborigi-
nal leaders like Charles Perkins are con-
vinced of a change. “Aborigines used
to be very quick to say to someone—-
‘You're a Barrowville boy, or you’re
from Queensland or you’re a Kempsey
boy’. If the kinship ties weren't there
. they wouldn't have much to do with
you. But now there’s a growing feeling
that we’re all part of one people.”
Aborigines who once tried to pass them-
selves off as Malaysians, or Chinese, or
Italians or Indians —anything as long as
not to be known as Aborigines—are now
extremely rare. There are even hints of
an incipient sense of “negritude” among
some mixed-blood Aborigines compar-
able to the new Negro spirit
throughout Africa. A veteran Aborigi-
nal leader like Mr Bert Groves, president
of the Aborigines’ Progressive Associa-
tion, says: “I'm chocolate-colored. I wish
I was jet-black.”
Except for the rare exception urban
Aborigines seem just as much caught
in the vicious circle of self-perpetuating
poverty, ignorance and disease as they
were ten years ago. And despite the
growing sense of belonging it is hard to
detect any feeling among the Aborigine
who is not active in organisations that
things are going to change in any way
at all let alone improve radically. One
social anthropologist trying to sum up
the attitude of mind among Aborigines
concluded that it was one of “acqui-
escence”. Charles Perkins puts it this
way: “My people are humble, you know,
and humility is not a virtue in the
twentieth century. What we need is
militant humility.” Meaningful change is
not likely to come to the Aborigine from
the outside alone, however well-inten-
tioned the majority environment. For it
to get anywhere from the inside it must
of course rely on leadership and this,
despite the difficulties, may be forth-
coming at last.
No Tom M boy as
have had leaders in the
past, they have had prominent
sportsmen and artists —but none seems
to have made any lasting impact on his
own people nor has any one of them
taken on a true-to-Jife quality in the non-
Aborigine community; no Mboya, no
Kenyatta, no Martin Luther King. Not
only does traditional Aboriginal custom
and group organisation make it hard for
leaders to emerge, their present system
of values works against it too. Accord-
ing to one social scientist the Aborigine
of 1965 is very reminiscent of the shear-
ers of the 1890 s keeping alive the
legendary Australian ideals of egalitari-
anism, and “knocking the tall poppy
down a peg or two”.
Charles Perkins at 29, two-thirds
through an Arts degree at Sydney Uni-
versity, and the most constructively
angry of the new kind of Aboriginal
leaders in Sydney, is wary of his own
image growing too fast for his own
and his own people’s good. “I'm not a
leader, I’m not a symbol—if the
Aborigines want me to be a leader then
that’s all right but don't force my image
down them. They’re funny this way.
Like I said, they're very humble people,
Aborigines, not like the Negroes who
were forced into humility by the white
man —they're naturally humble. I’d
like them to accept me but they don’t
go for leaders who force themselves.”
Perkins’ anger is directed to apathy
rather than discrimination. “The Aus-
tralians are sometimes criminally apa-
thetic. It’s criminal, it is. I think it
is, I definitely do. If there are Abori-
gines dying in the desert near Alice
Springs and the mortality rate goes up
a few miles just out of there . . . then
it’s criminal.” (Perkins comes originally
from Alice Springs and is specialising in
Anthropology and Sociology at the
University.) “Let's recognise the prob-
lem here. If we don't know our own
country we’re like a stranger in para-
dise—that’s what Australia is—paradise.
But we hear a lot about the White Aus-
tralia Policy and Wheat for India. Look,
I know all that’s important but there
are Aboriginal kids right here in Redfern
suffering from malnutrition and 10 per
cent of those we'll see on the freedom
ride are suffering from it too. At last
university students have woken up to
their own problems.”
He has done well at the University.
He reads voraciously about racial issues
- in Africa, in the United States and
anywhere else. He wants to go to Africa
which attracts him because of the leaders
it has produced, among whom Tom
Mboya impressed him greatly during his
visit. He also regards himself as a dis-
ciple of Martin Luther King. Perkins’
ideas have not crystallised fully and it
is confidence, determination, and tech-
nical understanding of the Aboriginal
problems which are his great assets for
leadership at present. But he has other
qualities which mark him out for the
future. He is a good public speaker, and
though ironically he could pass for a
white man, his acceptance among his
people, especially among young Abo-
rigines, is growing. Whatever he says
about his reluctance to accept leadership
he is, in fact, the up-and-coming leader.
Just what his role is in SAFA is
difficult to formalise. He is chairman of
the organisation and has been the focal
point for the group’s activities and plans.
Many of the students, in trying to ex-
plain why SAFA should have started in
1964, say that until a year earlier they
had had no direct contact with Abori-
gines on the campus. Perkins’ main im-
portance as an Aboriginal leader derives
even more from his work with the
recently established Foundation for
Aboriginal Affairs which he has been
running during his University vacation.
Packing them in
Foundation has made some sort
of breakthrough in the short time it
opened half-way through last December
following an appeal for funds which
raised £BO,OOO, less than the hoped-for
£150,000. In the eight weeks it has
been open Perkins has had nearly 1000
interviews with job-seekers, with evicted
families, abandoned children, people
seeking information about social ser-
vices, about education and many who
come because they have nothing else to
do. The weekly dance which started off
with a poor attendance now packs them
in with 250 each Friday night.
The Foundation gained almost imme-
diate acceptance among Aborigines and
Perkins believes this is because it is one
of the few organisations to co-operate
directly with Aborigines in asking them
what their needs are rather than dicta-
ting to them out of a do-good paternal-
ism or political Left-wing authoritarian-
ism. If it can survive its financial pro-
blems the Foundation may succeed
where many other organisations have
failed. There are signs also in the
Northern Territory that, following their
visits to Kenya, Philip Roberts and Davis
Daniels will together with recently ap-
pointed union secretary Sydney Cook be
Aboriginal voices demanding a hearing.
In the light of these developments it

developer and producer of Industrial Felts in Australia


is amazing that with the exception of
the Communist Party no other Austra-
lian political party takes the issue really
seriously. Two of the most articulate
spokesmen on Aboriginal affairs, the
Liberals’ W. C. Wentworth, MHR, and
Labor's Kim Beazley, MHR, have both
drawn attention in different ways to the
still widely ungrasped reality that, what-
ever we may think we are doing for the
Aborigines and however fast we may
think we are doing it, international agita-
tion for colored people everywhere is
going on at its own pace according to its
own time scale with its own slogans and
with its own view of the needs of indig-
enous peoples.
The Red and the Black
HEhe Communist Party's interest in Abo-
A rigines dates back to the Party’s in-
ception, and has changed as the inter-
national Communist line has changed.
But at no time in its history has CPA
interest in, and work amongst the
Aborigines been more active than it is
today. The current programme, still in
its draft form, has been under discussion
by Party members and some Aborigines
for about eighteen months and will pro-
bably soon emerge; to Aborigines it will
be the most attractive programme yet.
The most crucial issue on which the
Communists have brought pressure to
bear in the past and will continue to do
so in the future is whether to take the
problems of Aborigines to the United
Nations. There are indications that
some non-Communist members of the
key national organisation, the Federal
Council for Aboriginal Advancement,
want to take the matter to the UN only
as a last resort after every attempt at
finding a domestic solution (to the pro-
blems of land rights and compensation,
for instance) has been exhausted. But
they may not be able to resist the grow-
ing Communist and fellow traveller pres-
sure in that organisation for long.
The issue will come up again at Easter
when FCAA meets in Canberra. The
organisers plan to hold discussion on this
topic behind closed doors.
One Aborigine who will oppose taking
the matter to the United Nations is
Charles Perkins. He feels strongly that
Australians must make any decisions
themselves without outside interference.
It is in this context, then, that the Student
Action For Aborigines organisation
shows its potential strength—as a res-
ponsible force for political change. But
as the students continue their tour
through New South Wales there will be
others watching them beside the curious
Aboriginal families and the irritated
pub-keepers, to see if it really is a
“Freedom Ride”, or whether the Abori-
gines are just being taken for a ride . . .
soon to be forgotten again.
CANDY
“A genuinely and wholly evil book"
IVfANY books banned in Australia have sufficient literary
quality to justify their being freely available. There may f
however, be a good case in support of the Customs Department’s
recent prohibition of Terry Southern’s “Candy”.
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Baby Doll, Lolita, Candy . . . the
image of the blonde, dumb teen-
age girl, all dimples and sly
charm, lingers long in the American
literary consciousness. Terry Southern
and Mason Hoffenberg have created the
latest of these delectable nitwits in
“Candy”, provoker of a fountain of
praise abroad, banned in Australia last
year, and recently posted to our office
in the obligatory plain wrapping.
Mr Southern’s previous novels, “Flash
and Filigree” and “The Magic Christian”,
and to some extent his work on the film
“Dr Strangelove”, depended heavily on
that technique of lunatic exaggeration
which so many American critics mis-
take for wit. “Flash and Filigree”, set
partly in a Californian hospital, succeed-
ed in making painful fun out of sickness
and perversion. “The Magic Christian”
was more ambitious: Guy Grand, its
hero, was a sophomoric multi-million-
aire who took pleasure in scrawling
sky-designs in crude language to shock
the citizenry, entered a large feline in a
dog contest, and built a
bus-sized automobile to
startle the motor industry.
His cock - snooking at
society was endorsed b\
the author, who obviously
approved the idea of
spending an immense for-
tune in order to disrupt
the conventions.
Charmlessness was the
keynote of both books, to-
gether with an hysterical
desire to make the normal
as well as the diseased be-
have in a grotesquely dis-
torted fashion. “Candy",
published by the French
Olympia Press in 1958
over a pseudonym, de-
scribed by “Life” maga-
zine as a “comic classic”
and by “Newsweek” as “a Greek tragedy
written by Nathanael West and S. J.
Perelman”, became a succes de scandale
in the United States and—despite some
sharp notes of reproof from certain
quarters —swept the literary board. On
his way to Guy Grand-like riches, Mr
Southern can afford to scorn the un-
enlightened. He has, spectacularly, got
it made.
“Candy” the Voltairean parallel of
the title will not escape those whom Mr
Southern wishes to flatter begins, in
case anybody failed to notice, with a sly
epigraph by the author of “L’Homme
aux Quarante Ecus”. Professor Mephesto,
giving a course of Ethics in a small-
town college, is the first object of the
authors’ fun. He is given to remarks like
“I’ve strolled through the dew-sparkling
Gardens of Babylon in the dawn of a
summer morning and I’ve seen the birds
at eventide against the white glittering
marble of the Taj Mahal.” At ease with
this mockery of the learned, the authors’
public can settle back with relief: the
college setting gives the book a Mary
McCarthy-like respectability, while the
presence of an absurd academic will
leave no Philistine unhappy. Candy
Christian, one of the Professor’s pupils,
also has a respectable literary-cinematic
pedigree: by Williams out of Monroe,
while giving the male readers a sexual
jolt or two: a blonde, petulant beauty
created with that air of satirising the
sexpot of dime novel line-
age which can give any
book a patina of sociolo-
gical acuity. In no time at
all, Professor Mephesto is
disclosed as a bisexual of
vigorous habits: after giv-
ing Candy a pep-talk on
the human incapacity to
feel,, he slips his hand over
her breast; she makes a
getaway, only to return to
a more willing seduction
shortly after seeing her
would-be academic lover
engaging in a nude towel
fight with a male student.
From then on, the book
remains wound up to a
priapic fever-pitch. Candy
is nearly made by a Mexi-
can gardener, but her
father, who (it is later disclosed) has de-
signs on her, breaks in during their gam-
bollings; the gardener uses a trowel to
strike Mr Christian unconscious. Later, at
the Racine County Hospital, where Mr
Christian has been taken, the book’s
main action takes place. A foul-mouthed
aunt, given to a charming use of the
word “can”, and Christian’s twin, Jack,
who shares his brother's lecherous de-

signs on Candy, are introduced. And
the book’s male lead: a dark, good-look-
ing man whose deep brown eyes were
the “most sensitive and the most in-
telligent that Candy felt she had ever
seen”: Irving Krankeit, staff psychiatrist
at Racine County and author of “Mas-
turbation Now”, who believes that what
used to be called self-abuse will bring
about the end of war. When his col-
league, Dr Dunlap, attempts to seduce
Candy after a long period of continence,
Krankeit stops him; later Krankeit
screams a Cape Kennedy-like count-
down culminating in Dunlap mastur-
bating in an amphitheatre watched by
Krankeit’s janitress mother and the
astonished Candy Christian; a brain-
machine records Dunlap’s thoughts at
the moment.
After the prolonged nightmare of the
hospital scenes said to have been
mainly written by Mason Hoffenberg
because of the need to portray the
Jewish psychiatrist accurately the
tempo of the book increases as the set-
ting shifts to New York. There, a
hunchback takes Candy with his
hump, she meets a bizarre gynaecolo-
gist, is involved in a car crash in which
a homosexual bar, the San Remo, is dis-
rupted, and at the mining town of Mo-
hawk, Minnesota, becomes entangled
with a mystic. The final scene takes
place in Lhasa, where a holy man, at
the moment of possessing her, is dis-
closed as none other than her dear old
dad.
The book’s intent, as everyone now
knows, was to cross-fertilise the tech-
niques of “Candide” and “Miss Lonely-
hearts” into a highbrow spoof of porno-
graphic literature. Unfortunately, a sus-
picion remains that a work is being put
through the mails which in non-satirical
form would have had to be sold surrep-
titiously. While appearing to explode
literary myths of priapism, it in fact dis-
closes a gloating, heartless intelligence
enjoying what it pretends to deride. Like
the previous novels of Terry Southern
it makes fun of the weak, the crippled
and the mentally sick. It seems to me
not so much an expose of American
sickness as a symptom of it.
The worst feature of the book is its
literary style. A good deal of contem-
porary writing in the feverish desire
of publisher and author to cast off the
old-fashioned and the mannered has
become not merely colloquial, but illit-
erate. A book which parodies popular
novels as this one ostensibly does
has no business to be equally valueless
as prose. Style, skill, charm, \yit and
taste are all un. ormly lacking. A pro-
longed snigger at people who snigger,
“Candy” is one of the few books I have
read that I have thought genuinely and
wholly evil.

Mr Albert
and
Mr Collins
“They’re just waking up to it”
By HUGH CURNOW
Nothing could possibly have seem-
ed clearer. Mr Leo Albert, presi-
dent of Prentice Hall International,
was quite adamant about it: Yes, his
company was entirely American and,
yes, it was interested in selling its books
in Australia, but no, sir, no, Prentice
Hall was not in competition with other
publishers in Australia, whether they be
Australian or British. So there is
an American Book Week coming up
soon in Sydney goddammit, if anyone
thinks there’s some sort of scare
on in Australia about some sort
of American invasion of the publishing
market it just isn’t so! Maybe a
few books being sold by a few other
American publishers in Australia might
just possibly be in direct competition
with similar Australian-published books
but by far the greater bulk of Prentice
Hall publications in this country were
pricy, high-quality text books for
universities . . .
“If we didn't sell these books
in Australia no one else could supply
them for the tertiary education stu-
dents. We're not competing at all;
we’re just selling special lines that none
of the other publishers here can pro-
duce,” Mr Albert told, me firmly, and
added: “It is not, nor never has been, the
policy of my company to compete with
publishers already established in any
country we enter.” And then he shook
his head as if to signify that that sort of
thing just wasn't considered fairplay in
the publishing game.
What about children’s books? “Too
darn expensive to produce. We couldn't
hope to be able to sell them in Australia
at anything like a competitive price.”
And fiction and non-fiction? “Much the
same applies. We couldn’t begin to com-
pete seriously with the Australian and
British products’ prices.” How about
paperbacks then? “Now there, I under-
stand, is some room for competition but
at the moment our paperbacks are really
mainly technical and specialist-type
books, still in the text-book class.” No,
Mr Albert didn’t know just how success-
ful Pan’s inroads had been into Penguin’s
sales in this country but he did know
that Australia now bought more Prentice

Halt International publications than
Britain ... Yes, he would repeat that:
Australia buys more American books
than Britain. Not more books per capita
or anything like that but more books
per nation.
How come Britain with its popul-
ation and Australia with hers were
turnabout on the buying scale? Mr
Albert said that interested him, too. He
wished he knew the answer to that one.
Perhaps there was more choice for
Britain’s readers and they therefore
were choosing fewer American books.
Perhaps it was the natural Australian
leaning to the United States. But it cer-
tainly had nothing to do with any
American push into Australian book-
selling markets; in fact, no such push
exists.
What, then, about the future of
American publishing moves in this
country? Speaking hypothetically, only,
Mr Albert scratched his impressive head
of silver-grey hair and deliberated over
that one. Mr Albert wears a fine
American suit and comfortable Ameri-
can shoes and a large diamond ring on
one of the fingers he uses when shaking
hands, but thinking about the future he
looks just like anyone else searching for
an answer, really. “I suppose,” he began
slowly, “1 would expect an American
publishing firm like mine to print its
own books right here in Australia and
then sell them. Then the prices would
be competitive. But no, that probably
isn’t what would happen . . . No, I think
it’s more likely that the American, firm
would sell its rights to a book to an
Australian publisher and let him take
over the printing and selling of it. Mind
you,” he added swiftly, “that’s just my
guess.”
T)efore I left Mr Albert’s Sydney hotel
room to talk with the British pub-
lisher William Collins on the next floor
down, Mr Albert confirmed that Prentice
Hall International is now the largest sub-
sidiary company of the parent company,
Prentice Hall. “We're just beginning to
find out what sort of markets we can
obtain,” he said. Mr Collins took that
further. “The Americans are just waking
up to what is the meaning of exports,”
he asserted before talking about what
that meant to his firm in Australia.
“Actually,” he said, “the American
sales in Australia don’t worry us much
at all. Mr Albert is quite right if he
says their activities are limited to mainly
high-priced text books. They have that
corner of the market here. But as it is a
side of publishing that we British pub-
lishers don't touch it doesn’t bother us.
Of course,’’ he went on, “India and
the East is an entirely different story.
There the Americans infringe our pub-
lishing rights quite shamefully.” A look

of pain crossed his craggily handsome
face. “Really, the way they have gone
through the paperback market in the
East is quite incredible . . . But let’s talk
about something nearer to Australia, shall
we?”
Mr Collins had five Australian authors
and a spate of new children’s books by
Australians and he was proud of them
all. “Eleanor Dark is probably the best-
known Australian writer. Her ‘Timeless
Land’ is a sales sensation in America.
George Johnson’s ‘My Brother Jack’ is
getting a tremendous prestige boost with
a 12-instalments TV serialisation this
year. Jon Cleary is very well established
as an international novelist. Do you
know that his novels are immediately
translated into several languages? Paul
Brickhill is off to Kuwait to see if there's
a biography in the life of a former British
army officer there who sounds fascin-
ating. And Catherine Gaskin, whom
everybody thought was just a ‘oncer’, has
scored enormous success with both ‘Sara
Dane’ and now her first thriller, ‘File
On Devlin’.”
11/Teanwhile something old (Chester
Wilmot's “Struggle for Europe”)
and something new (a first novel by Mel-
bourne writer William Dick) were due
out before long. “Chester's book is still
regarded as the best single-volume work
on the war. They quote it in the House
of Commons as an authority, you know.
And some people don’t even know he
was an Australian! We and The Ob-
server’ set up a fund for his wife and
children after that terrible air-crash.
They are well taken care of, and I often
visit them. The new edition of ‘Struggle’
has an introduction by Professor Michael
Howard putting it into its honored
perspective as an authoritative work. The
Dick novel came to us with a note of
recommendation from Morris West, who
is a friend of mine Apparently lots of
Australian writers send their work to
him to read and criticise. Why he didn't
send this one to his own publisher, I
don’t know, but he is a friend of mine
and I expect he thought 1 might be the
man to handle it best for William Dick.”
Mr Collins {above), as affable as he is
capable, agreed that being a successful
publisher was probably the most reward-
ing job in the world. The übiquitous
interest he envinces in Australia and Aus-
tralians is partly matched by the number
of his firm's books that are sold in this
country. “Australian sales would probably
account for 15 per cent of our total
sales,” he confirmed. “Already we export
more than .40 per cent of our books.
The Americans are now beginning to rea-
lise some of the advantages of this.”

AROUND MELBOURNE
The Ultimate Status Symbol
Mercedes at one end, Rolls'at the other
11/fELBOURNE’s 31st Motor Show open-
ed last Thursday at the vast, dear
old Exhibition Buildings. The millionth
Holden was there beautifully arranged
in a nest of greenery, complete with
splashing fountain. The new 4.2 litre
150 m.p.h. E-type Jaguar hardtop was
raised on an altar for all to see. It
was FAB white with a black top and
sitting there on a large bed of fresh
hydrangeas it looked just like a lolly
waiting to be popped into one’s mouth.
But the star of the show needed no
extra trimmings apart from a few
homely potted palms “Der Grosser”
Mercedes 600. The advertisements put
it rather nicely: “A majestic saloon . . .
designed primarily for Royalty and
Heads-of-State, a limited number avail-
able for Australian car connoisseurs.”
The show already was chugging with
rumors that this Der Grosser had been
bought not by a Head of State but
an ice-cream manufacturer. Price before
extras: £11,425. I confirmed that the
car had been sold: “Naturally, sir, he
doesn’t want his name revealed. But the
car is very popular; we have virtually
sold four others.”
Der Grosser’s 48 cwt sat solidly and
squarely on the carpet. Its color was
deep burgundy and the instructions said
that it would seat six. This was being
modest; over 18ft long and 6ft 4in.
wide, undoubtedly they were thinking of
six large Managing Directors who could
be sped at 46 m.p.h. in first, 75 in
second, 118 in third and 127 in top.
The Mercedes gentleman kindly
explained the intimate details. There was
the hydraulic “Comfort System” which
clearly did every darned thing. The
hydraulics operated at a pressure of
2000 lbs to the square inch. They
operated the windows “slowly and ele-
gantly”, the seats up, down, recline and
back. The passengers in the rear could
move their seat forward and back at
a touch of a button. Der Grosser boot
also opened hydraulically at button-
touch and Der Grosser captain when he
locked the door could lock all doors,
petrol cap, and boot with one turn of
the key. The doors, too, were hydraulic
assisted. One just touches them and
they close with a sophisticated thud.
There was radio front and back and
a four-air-horn system, which as one
motoring writer put it here was a
horn that was capable of emitting a
bellow that could turn a pedestrian’s
hair white or even frighten a diesel
train. (
The car was actually fitted with air-
conditioning, but this was an extra £965.
The price may seem high but we were
told the equipment was astonishingly
efficient. You dial your own tempera-
ture and it comes almost immediately.
The scale goes down to 34 degrees, so
presumably at Flemington one could
leave the champagne bottles on the
front seat, engine on, duck off for the
first race, and upon returning every-
thing would be just right.
Der Grosser 1 had not one but four
cigar-lighters, radio controls in the front
and back and special controls for the
suspension. No doubt the owner of
such a car would have a little property
in the bush as a tax dodge, if he were
bouncing his Der Grosser over the home
paddock to see the sheep he could raise
his whole car by two inches, to give
an eight-inch clearance.
Obviously Mercedes have set out to
create a status symbol to out-status all
others, and already this has caused
embarrassment. Maybe it was just a
coincidence that Mercedes and Rolls-
Royce were at opposite poles of the
exhibition. Rolls was represented by a
lovely Silver Cloud 111 in pure white,
all 15 coats of it. However, the price was
only £9lOO, a few thousand below the
Mercedes. Even the air-conditioning was
cheaper. On the Rolls you get it for
only £530.
The Rolls-Royce man said: “We have
never claimed to make the most expen-'
sive car in the world, only the best.
But you should realise that you can
order a Bentley Continental for
£13,500, or the Rolls-Royce Phantom V
touring limousine, £15,750. The Queen
has one, of course. At 20ft it is rather
longer and larger than the 18ft Rolls
which we have here . . . our smallest.”
The information should be a help to
Rolls owners in Toorak, Vaucluse and
elsewhere.
For the man who wants everything,
there was the hand-made Ferrari
250LM, which was even more expensive
than the Grosser, at £11,500. However,
at the . price you get four axle ratios
and a spare set of wheels. The top
axle ratio gives you 85 in first, 115 in
second, 144 in th ird, 163 in fourth and
184 in fifth.
Maybe that was the interesting part
about this show. In a town which has no
decent, completed freeway, seat belts as
a non-extra were exceptional and there
were 44 cars on the floor capable of
100 m.p.h. or more. Heaven knows
where anybody would drive them. Prob-
ably precisely there.

India’s
Anti-Hindi
Riots
By SIBNARAYAN RAY
(Head of Department of Indian Studies,
University of Melbourne.)
On January 26 India celebrated the
fifteenth anniversary of the found-
ing of the Republic by formally
installing Hindi as the principal official
language of the Union. This immediately
provoked strong protest from non-Hindi-
speaking areas, especially Madras, where
two young members of the main op-
position party, Dravida Munnetra Kaz-
shagam (DMK), burnt themselves to
death, following the grim pattern set by
South Vietnam's Buddhist priests.
Several thousand college and university
students in that State organised violent
demonstrations, carrying black flags and
badges, stoning officials and public build-
ings, and setting fire to a number of
State transport buses The leadership was
provided largely by the DMK which
had already declared January 26 as a
“Day of Mourning”.
At time of writing there are news
reports of savage rioting and arson in
many parts of Madras, and this may
spread to neighboring Kerala. Already
two police officers have been burnt to
death by frenzied rioters, and scores of
people have died of police firing. More
than a hundred persons have been seri-
ously injured, and over a thousand arres-
ted or taken into preventive custody.
Although opposition to Hindi is most
articulate in Madras, it is certainly not
limited to that State alone. On January
17, at an anti-Hindi conference at Tiru-
chi, over 700 delegates from Madras,
Kerala, Mysore, and Maharashtra passed
resolutions condemning the proposed in-
stallation of Hindi as India’s main offi-
cial language and characterising this as
an “unwise, unjust and discriminatory
tyranny”. The same conference urged
suspension of Part XVII of the Indian
Constitution (which declares Hindi as the
official language of the Union, but pro-
vides that English will continue to be
used up to January, 1965, for all offi-
cial purposes for which it was being used
immediately before the commencement
of the Constitution in 1950), and de-
manded that English should continue
indefinitely as the main official language.
Besides these four States, Andhra
Pradesh, the only other State in South

Punjab, by Urdu-speaking Muslims, and
only less outspokenly by Orissa and
Assam. In 1956 the report of the Official
Language Commission (which was ap-
pointed by the President to recommend
measures for the progressive replacement
of English by Hindi as the official lan-
guage of the Union) contained two
minutes of dissent, both advocating reten-
tion of English, one submitted by the
Bengali member and the other by the
member from Madras. In short, oppo-
sition to Hindi is fairly widespread and
cuts across party loyalties. It was in re-
cognition of this that the late Pandit
Nehru persuaded the Parliament to pass
the Official Languages Act of 1963 which
extended indefinitely the bi-lingual prin-
ciple beyond 1965. The current instal-
lation of Hindi is, therefore, seen by
many as a violation of the pledge given
by Nehru on that occasion and of the
spirit of the Constitution. According to
reports, a judge of the Calcutta High
Court has already issued notice on the
Union Government to show cause
why it should not be restrained from
enforcing the change.
Three reasons for Hindi
Tn view of this hostility, why did the
Indian National leadership decide on
Hindi as the official language of the
Union? India has a total of 845 langu-
ages and dialects, among which 14 are
recognised in the Constitution as the
major languages of India. Under British
rule, English became the common lan-
guage of administration, higher educ-
ation, commerce and communication
among the different linguistic groups. As
long as Indian political movements were
limited to the urban intelligentsia, Eng-
lish was their unifying language. But
after the First World War, with Gandhi’s
emergence on the political scene, a re-
volution started in the nature and com-
position of Indian politics The common
people were now being increasingly
drawn into the national movement and
the search began for an Indian language
which would be understandable to the
majority of the Indian people. Since, of
all Indian languages, Hindi claimed the
largest number of speakers (currently
believed to be over 180 million people
out of about 450 million), it came to be
put forward as the best choice for a
common national language. There are
three main arguments in support of
Hindi’s claim: unlike English, it is an
Indian language; it is spoken and under-
stood by nearly half the country's popu-
lation; it is not an elite language, but
used by ordinary people, although given
proper support and encouragement it
may very well develop into a rich lan-
guage fully adequate to the requirements
of a modern nation.
However, outside the Hindi-speaking
areas there has always been opposition
to this claim and, as the recent agitation
indicates, it continues to be quite strong.
There are many reasons for this. The
most important is the widespread fear
among non-Hindi-speaking people that
this will place them at a great economic,
political and educational disadvantage
compared to those whose mother tongue
is Hindi. Retention of English will place
everyone at equal disadvantage and pre-
vent what the more extreme critics call
“imposition of Hindi imperialism”,
English is also supported on other
more practical grounds. It has already
been in use for quite a long time for
central administration and interstate
communication; besides, it is a highly
developed and internationally used langu-
age, and its replacement will retard
India’s growth as a modern nation. It is
needed for law, government and poli-
tics, commerce and foreign relations,

and especially for advanced studies in
the sciences and technology.
There are other reasons, possibly even
more deep-seated, though not stressed as
openly and frequently by the opponents
of Hindi. Virtually all major modern
Indian languages (except Tamil, which is
older) are over a thousand years old,
but some of them have developed
phenomenally in the last one hundred
years, due mainly to more intimate con-
tact with the West. These are primarily
the coastal languages Bengali, Telugu
(Andhra Pradesh), Tamil (Madras),
Malayalam (Kerala), Kannada (Mysore)
and Marathi (Maharashtra). Between
them they have over 180 million speak-
ers. Compared to them Hindi is a rela-
tively less developed language, and con-
sequently it is somewhat looked down
upon by the speakers of these other lan-
guages. Besides, prolonged and sustained
contact with the West has produced in
these non-Hindi-speaking coastal regions
a sizeable modern educated elite which
sees in Hindi a symbol of social and
cultural stagnation and backwardness.
Although extremely proud of their own
languages, they support English as the
official language of the Union not only
because it is already their second langu-
age but also because it is essential to
their continued leadership which they
believe to be threatened by the Hindi-
speaking North. Moreover, four of these
languages belong to the Dravidian langu-
age family which is basically different
from the Indo-Aryan family of which
Hindi is a member. The conflict be-
tween Indo-Aryan and Dravidian which
has characterised Indian history for over
3000 years is not a minor factor in the
South Indian opposition to Hindi.
The solution of India’s complex lingu-
istic problem would seem to lie in con-
tinuing and consolidating the policy that
has on the whole proved successful dur-
ing the first fifteen years of the Republic—
maintaining English as the de facto of-
ficial language of the Union, while dev-
eloping Hindi as the additional official
language; promoting the major regional
languages as State languages; and provid-
ing the first 15 years of the Republic—
linguistic minorities in all the States
and in the Union Territories. (sne hopes
that India's leaders who themselves
worked out this solution would have
the wisdom and courage to stick to it
despite all pressures.
Peking’s Paper
Dragon?
Not unconquerable , anyway
By EMERY BARCS
Ohould the war in South Vietnam
develop into a bigger conflict, the
armed forces of Peking—officially called
the People's Liberation Army of China
—are bound to play a vital part in it.
Western military experts seem to agree
that while PLAC could not rate- as a
first-class military machinery in an ultra-
modern mechanised war, it would be an
impressive force in an Asian conflagra-
tion. And it is nowhere else that Red
China may fight in the foreseeable future.
Although since 1949, when the Reds
finally conquered the whole of Mainland
China, PLAC has changed considerably,
it has retained some of the features ac-
quired during the partisan war. Relations
between officers and men are still closer
than they are in the other great armies
of the world (including the Soviet army).
Opinions about its morale, however,
vary considerably. In 1959 when Mar-
shal Peng Teh-huai, Minister of National
Defence and second in the military hier-
archy after veteran Marshal Chu Teh,
was dismissed and replaced by Marshal

Lin Piao, the low spirit and poor
Communist consciousness of the soldiers,
saiiors and airmen was given as the
main reason for the change. During
the past five and a half years Lin and
General Lo Jui-ching, the Beria of
China”, have made considerable efforts
to restore the revolutionary zeal of for-
mer days to the men and women serving
in PLAC. Nationalist Chinese intelligence
consistently reports latent dissatisfaction
with conditions in the three services. On
the other hand no serious weaknesses
were evident during the Red Chinese
frontier attacks against India,
The most recent estimates (November,
1964) put the total strength of Red
Chinese ground forces, the navy and the
a j r force at between 2,500,000 and
3,000,000 officers and men. Numerically
this would put Red China more or less
on equal footing with the armed forces
of the Soviet Union and of the US. But
comparisons of numbers alone would be
misleading. When one considers existing
equipment and the capacity of the three
countries, war industries, Communist
China comes out a very poor third in
the race.
The Red Chinese ground troops now
include between 150 and 160 divisions of
about 12,000 men each. Of these 135
are infantry, 10 are armored and three
are air force, ground force and anti-air
force divisions. The supply of small arms
seems to be adequate in qua'htity and of
reasonably good quality. But the armored
force is in bad shape. It was to be com-
pletely re-organised and re-equipped
with Soviet material but the programme
became bogged down.
The Chinese Communist navy has
about 1100 ships with a total tonnage of
200,000. Vessels for combat purposes
number 122, including four destroyers
and 32 submarines. The Chinese them-
selves have built some coastal defence
gunboats and they have assembled a few
submarines. But most of the ships are of
Japanese origin given as war compensa-
tion to the Russians in 1945 or ancient
vessels left by the Nationalists in 1949.
Red China’s air force has also been
greatly handicapped by the withdrawal of
Soviet aid. Most of the planes are vin-
tage MIG-16s (built in 1949) and MIG-
19s (1955) which the Chinese now build
themselves under licence obtained from
the Soviets before the great schism.
Many of the old aircraft had to be can-
nibalised to provide spares.
Pilot-training seems to be consider-
ably below Western and Soviet-bloc
standards. The average flying time per
pilot is 150 hours and the annual flying
hours for trained pilots have recently
been reduced from 60 to 20 for lack of
fuel. Solo flights are kept at a bare mini-
mum mainly for fear of defections while
soloing.
Probably as many as 10 million are
in the Communist militia which is a
hotch-potch organisation haphazardly
trained and sparsely equipped. Their
main task is to support the People’s
Liberation Army and the Public Security
Force in time of war and to provide
cadres for enforcing Government policy
in peace time. Soviet critics have des-
cribed the militia as a “heap of flesh”
with no useful role in a modern war.
Summing up, Red China’s armed
strength certainly exceeds anything any
Asian country (including India but ex-
cluding the Soviet Union) can put into
the field by its own efforts. But without
Soviet assistance the Chinese Communists
are at present not strong enough to wage
war successfully against a combination
of Asian countries supported by the Free
World.
It would be wrong to underestimate
Peking's military power, but it would be
also a grave mistake to pursue a policy
based on the assumption that the People’s
Republic of China is an unconquerable
dragon.

World’s most boring machine!
The “Mole” tunneling machine has set a world’s speed
record at Tasmania’s Great Lake Power Development,
Australia.
In 27 days of underground excavation, the Mole burrowed
2,519 feet. Previous 27 day record was 2,317 feet.
Each of the Mole’s 34 hard rock disc cutters is equipped
with two Timken tapered roller bearings. Two large 71i"
O.D. Timken bearings are used also to support the
rotating cutterhead assembly, 16 feet in diameter.
Mole’s builder, James S. Robbins and Associates, Inc.,
Seattle, Washington, used Timken bearings because of
their ability to take heavy combination loads and the
extreme shock loads from striking very hard rock.
You can’t afford downtime on machinery costing nearly
£220,000. Breakdown of the two large bearings support-
ing the cutterhead assembly would require major repairs
perhaps impossible in the confines of the tunnel.
Timken bearings are casehardened to give rugged, de-
pendable service. They’re tapered to take radial and thrust
loads, or any combination. They’re precision-made of
nickel-rich steel for uniformly high quality.
No doubt Timken bearings can help you get longer

Frozen Law
Harwich's High Court and the Airlines' Case
By G. SAWER
(Professor of Law, Australian National University.)
life of the law has not been
I logic, it has been experience,”
■*" said Justice Holmes of the US
Supreme Court. The recent decision of
the High Court of Australia in the NSW
Airlines Case suggests that under Chief
Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, as under his
predecessor Sir Owen Dixon, the Court
is going to be guided more by “logic”
than by “experience” in the sense meant
by Holmes. That is, it is going to in-
sist on the maintenance of established
categories of constitutional thought, it is
hot going to take the initiative in mould-
ing older conceptions to current condi-
tions, and it will change a particular rule
only if a very pressing case of social
necessity is made out.
The effect of the Airlines decision
was to require airline operators carrying
on a service wholly within a State to
obtain both State and Federal licences,
and so to continue the state of affairs in
which Dubbo was left without an air
service. Justice Kitto aptly put the
formalist, conservative view of judicial
function, with which Justice Holmes dis-
agreed, when he said of the outcome of
the Airlines Case: “A degree of public
inconvenience will exist. While this may
be regretted, it leads to no legal con-
clusion.”
Some misunderstanding has been caus-
ed by the fact that on one important
issue in Airlines whether the State
licence regulations were overridden by
the Commonwealth ones the Chief
Justice dissented from his colleagues.
He did so, however, because he applied
an even more doctrinaire notion of “in-
consistency” than that favored by the
rest of the Court. Because the safety
considerations with which the Common-
wealth was held entitled to deal were
also taken into account by the State
licensing authority, Sir Garfield consid-
ered that in this respect the regulations
covered the same field and the Common-
wealth regulations intended to cover it
exclusively. The majority took the more
commonsense view that although the
New South Wales Transport Commis-
sioner was authorised to consider safety
factors, he was mainly concerned to
carry out a politico-economic policy, dic-
tated by the State Government, which
favored East-West rather than the Ansett
subsidiary. Even if Sir Garfield’s view
on this has been accepted by the rest of
the Court, stalemate would still have
been the result; it would only have been
necessary for New South Wales to re-
vise its regulations so as to make eco-
nomic or commercial preference the sole
ground for grant of its licences.
The doctrinaire approach of the Court
was shown by its insistence that the
notion of “interstate” trade necessarily
implied a correlative notion of “intra-
state” trade and that these were funda-
mental legal concepts which must be
maintained if the heavens fall. Many
adverse comments were made about
the different approach adopted- by the
Supreme Court of the USA, with the
implication that what the Supreme Court
had done was really politics and involved
some sort of abandonment of “legal”
concepts. Actually, before 1900 there
was no Australian legal concept of inter-
state trade at all; it was a business and
commercial conception which the Found-
ers used when delimiting the relative
competence of the Commonwealth and
the States. It had been given a particu-
lar significance in the USA, but that in
turn depended on the business practice
and the economics of the country from
time to time. There is no logical reason
at all why the Court should treat the
notions of 1900 relevant to the trade
and commerce power as immutably
frozen into the Constitution. The Court
itself has departed from such frozen
jurisprudence when dealing with the
defence and the posts and telegraph
power.
In the USA. the Supreme Court would
have considered the following questions:
what proportion of the passengers and
cargo carried from Sydney to Dubbo and
vice-versa was destined for other States
or overseas? Was the equipment and
fuel used in the relevant services derived
mainly from overseas or interstate
sources? Were the airline operators con-
cerned closely linked with or part of
business organisations existing in two or
more States or with international affi-
liations? It is typical of the congealed
condition of Australian constitutional
thinking that the parties considered it

venience will

ted, it leads to

sion”
SIR GARFIELD BARWICK
useless to press evidence and arguments
along these lines.
This sort of reasoning involved all
the Justices in a self-contradiction. They
criticised New South Wales and the other
States which intervened in the argument
for relying on what they considered an
outmoded argument, rejected in 1920 in
the Engineers’ Case—the assumption that
in a Federal system like ours, the States,
although not given any specific powers
(as the Provinces were in Canada) but
only left the residue after what is given
to the Commonwealth, were not intend-
ed to be cut down below a certain size;
hence if a Federal power can be given
a wider or a narrower meaning, the nar-
rower is to be preferred so as to pre-
serve the assumed minimum of guaran-
teed State competence. However, the
insistence of the Justices, including the
Chief Justice, on maintaining a meaning-
ful category of “intrastate trade” is itself'
an example of the sort of reasoning
which they criticise. Justice Kitto gave
this particular game away when after
stating and criticising the American
Supreme Court doctrines about the scope
of interstate trade, he said that the
Americans had abandoned, whereas we
still retained, the doctrine of “dual Fed-
eralism”. This is the very doctrine
which the first High Court adopted and
applied, and which it was once thought
the Engineers’ Case had destroyed; the
notion that you dogmatically assume
certain matters to be “inherently State”
was a part of the doctrine, and it is this
doctrine which the High Court now
applies when it recoils with horror from
a suggestion that the integration of Aus-
tralian trade and commerce has reached
a point where the category of “intra-
state trade” should be treated as nearly
empty of substantive content.
However, adherence to doctrinaire
concepts in constitutional law has always
been characteristic of our High Court,
and this is one of the reasons why there
has always been a curious lack of con-
sonance between what the Court was
doing and what the nation was doing.
When between 1906 and 1910 Australia
was experiencing its first bout of nation-

building under Deakin, the High Court
was committed to State-right assumptions
which led to its invalidating the~T?bw
Protection scheme, and this incidentally
helped to wreck the alliance between the
Deakin Protectionists and the Labor
Party. New appointments to the High
Court caused a change in outlook, and
Sir Isaac Isaacs, in particular, succeeded
in injecting a nationalist, centralising
political assumption and flexible methods
of interpretation into many judgments
but meanwhile the country was reacting
from the Labor Party, and even from
the Hughes Nationalists, and returning
to State-rightism as a matter of political
preference. Hence in the early 1920 s
the High Court in effect invited the Com-
monwealth to take control of national
commerce, free even from the restric-
tions of the guarantee of interstate trade
in 5.92, at a time when Bruce-Page
Governments were most unanxious to do
any such thing. Expansive interpreta-
tions of Commonwealth power continued
to be dominant until World War 11.
The Dixon Court
T>ut a judicial reaction set in during the
war, and immediately after it the
High Court acquired a majority under
the leadership of Sir Owen Dixon which
to some extent overtly and even more
covertly reverted to narrower construc-
tions of Federal authority, with the addi-
tional factor of a construction of the
free-trade clause which rewrote it as a
sort of due process clause and barrier
against socialism—just when the Curtin
and Chifley Governments were trying
to promote collectivism on a national
scale. To some extent the individualist
and laissez-faire assumptions of the
Dixon Court anticipated, and then
accorded with, the mood of the country
after the accession of the Menzies-
Fadden Government in 1949. But the
Menzies regime was not overjoyed by
the invalidation of State transport con-
trol legislation, previously held valid in a
succession of High Court judgments
since 1932, which followed in 1954, even
though this was done with the active
assistance of that boot-strap British insti-
tution the Privy Council. The politicians
must often have thought that the direc-
tion of High Court interpretation was
fortuitous, and the decision in any parti-
cular case to be regarded as conforming
to the legal conception of an Act of
God.
To the Justices themselves, and to the
majority of learned counsel who under-
stand and approve their intellectual pro-
cesses, the decisional history is not in
the least fortuitous, but follows a logical
pattern which happens to be quite in-
dependent of the logic of politics. The
legal logic also includes some very open-
ended propositions, which it might be
thought could be accommodated, if not
to contemporary party politics, at least

Getting into a state
of boundless energy!
One State where industry should never go short of power and
fuel is Queensland. Its abundant and varied sources of energy
are soon to be further supplemented by such oil refinery
by-products as tail gas, fuel oil and liquid petroleum gas.
Queensland is conscious of the attraction plentiful and cheap
power has for industry.
The success of its policy of fostering development by providing
a reliable supply of electricity in adequate quantities and. at
reasonable prices throughout the State is evident.
The annual rate of growth of industrial sales by Regional
Electricity Boards over the last decade has averaged 17 per
cent per annum.
About £200,000,000 will be spent on electricity supply and
distribution in Queensland oyer the next decade. This will
include three new thermal power stations. At present nearly
86 per cent of Queensland’s electricity is produced from coal
and almost 13 per cent by hydroelectric stations.
A most important event has been the discovery of natural gas
and oil in Southern Queensland. Natural gas is today one of
the world’s most important industrial fuels.
New enterprises move into Queensland with the certainty of
reliable power supplies and a knowledge that tariff charges
compare very favourably with those in other States.
It is a pleasure for officers of the Department of Industrial
Development to advise on any matter of industrial significance
in Queensland. For information on the availability of electric
power, water and other services for any projected new enter-
prise you need only write to

to the longer-term and widely supported
national policies.
For example, in the Airlines Case,
several Justices said that it was for
Parliament, not the Court, to choose the
methods by which the objectives of safe
and efficient aviation services were to be
achieved. Might it not have been reason-
able for the Federal authorities to be
authorised by Parliament to avoid the
“inefficiency” (rather than mere incon-
venience) which the absence of a Sydney-
Dubbo service involved? The fact is
that most of the logic of constitutional
decision permits alternative conclusions
to most cases.
Breeze .tend irrespective
Tn spite of the prevalence of an arid con-
ceptualism in High Court constitu-
tional decisions since the Second World
War, the long-term trend of its decisions
has facilitated the growth of Common-
wealth authority to match the integra-
tion of the Australian society and eco-
nomy. This is partly because even the
most formalist judges sometimes make
use of the open-ended concepts of their
own system in a way conducive to
Commonwealth power. For example, a
majority of the Court in 1962 gave a
reasonably generous interpretation of the
Federal marriage and divorce power—
Sir Owen Dixon. CJ, dissenting. Partly
it is because the Court’s own concepts
include adherence to precedent; thus the
decisions of “expansionist” eras such as
that between 1920 and 1942 remain for
the most part in force. Such a decision
was that in the Goya Henry Case of
1936, asserting Federal power to pro-
vide for the carrying out of international
air conventions; this precedent was a
factor in the expansionist aspect of the
Airlines Case, the part of the decision
giving a wide scope to the Federal power
to regulate all aviation from the point of
view of air safety. In view of some
comments by Sir Garfield Barwick on
this power in the course of his Airlines
judgment, one wonders whether he would
have been prepared to adopt a broad
view of the external affairs power if it
had not been for the legacy of 1936.
Another important point is that in any
event the Constitution is only in part
what the High Court says it is. The
High Court only gets a chance to inter-
pret the Constitution if someone has an
interest in litigating a constitutional
question. Not every doubt finds a suit-
able plaintiff and defendant. Hence to
a considerable extent the politicians and
the civil servants interpret the Consti-
tution for themselves, or breeze ahead
irrespective of what the Constitution
says.
I am not suggesting that the prin-
ciples on which they act are necessarily
or always any better than those applied
by the High Court.


Letters to the Editor
The Film Industry
SIR.-—Mr Kingsford-Smith's proposals
for the Australian film industry quoted
by Charles Higham (8., February 13)
include promoting Australian films on
the American market, but appears to
offer no direct plan to develop the home
market. Surely the only way to attract
capital for film production is to establish
a home market in which Australian
films can compete with American and
other distributors’ promotions? This
would require large-scale promotion of
Australian actors and directors, but this
does not seem impossible when one
considers that an unknown American
actor can overnight emerge as a star as
a result of promotion for American
films released in Australia.
At this stage it would seem that only
a Government-backed project could ever
hope to achieve this.
Nicholas Bougrelas
Annunciate (NSW).
SIR. —I found Mr Charles Higham’s
article on the Australian film industry
completely unsatisfactory. He concludes
that there are possibilities for only two
kinds of films in the world today:
blockbusters (which he quite rightly
rejects as a possibility for this country)
and artistic films. Where, 1 believe, he
falls into error is when he puts the
responsibility and the initiative for pro-
duction of the latter type of films wholly
back on to the individual film maker; in
other words he suggests leaving every-
thing exactly as it is. He does not even
pose one question, which for me at
least would seem of primary import-
ance: leaving all financial considerations
aside is an Australian film industry
desirable from the country’s point of
view?
Many artistic efforts, such as music,
ballet, painting, etc., already receive
some type of assistance or subsidy.
Nobody asks in these cases whether such
support is wise from the financial view-
point. But what about the film industry,
the artistic expression of the 20th cen-
tury and which happens to be the most
expensive of all doesn’t it deserve
some kind of assistance? Is it not desir-
able from a purely nationalistic view-
point that films should be made here in
this country which can reflect our life,
our culture, our hopes and problems to
the whole world even if the taxpayers
have to pay part of the burden?
Throwing back everything on the
individual is irresponsible and hopeless.
True, there are some fanatics who put
up their life-savings, sweat and sacri-
fice to satisfy their egos. But do we have
to wait for them to arise? Do we not
owe it to ourselves to hasten this pro-
cess? A government is needed here with
vision and a generous wallet. Let me
bring up only one example. The postwar
Italian film New Wave which shook the
world with de Sica, Rossellini, Fellini,
Antonioni and many others can thank
its existence to Cine Citta and the Cen-
trale Cinematografica which were both
established by Mussolini in the ’thirties.
He did a lot of harm to his country, but
he also, unintentionally, laid the ground-
work for a world-wide renaissance of
the film art.

Trouble with the Customs
SIR.—In support of Mr John Power's
letter (8., January 30) I too have had
trouble with the Department of Customs.
We applied for duty-free entry for an
aircraft we were importing. In a sub-
sequent exchange of letters, a letter I
wrote on June 30, 1964, was not replied
to until September 23. Even then this
letter was extracted only by a reply-paid
wire asking for confirmation of receipt.
When our application was refused,
the Department gave the reason as being
“the policy of the Department”. No
amount of requesting will get any closer
to finding out any further reason or jus-
tification for this policy. I, too, object
to there being no further authority to
appeal to when you feel you have a
genuine injustice thrust upon you. In
our particular case some £7OO was in-
volved. Surely in this democratic com-
munity a more realistic reason can be
given than “it is the policy of this De-
partment”.

The “Catholic Worker"
Slß.—The article on the “Catholic
Worker” (8., February 6) contains errors
of fact which ought to be corrected not
only in the interest of truth and accur-
acy of record but also because the
facts when correctly stated help to re-
fute a criticism of the “Catholic
Worker” to which the article refers.
1. B. A. Santamaria's association with
the “Catholic Worker” ceased about
1937 (not 1946 as indicated by your
writer). The reasons for his departure
involved his becoming an employee of
the Church and also disagreement with
the “Catholic Worker” committee on
editorial matters.
2. The circular letter-- to the parish
priests of Melbourne Archdiocese which
virtually banned the sale of the “Catho-
lic Worker” at the churches was sent on
behalf of Dr Mannix on March 30, 1955
(not July, 1959, as stated by your writer).
The disapproval of Dr Mannix related to
an article in the “Catholic Worker” issue
of April, 1955, in which the Movement,
ALP troubles, and a radio talk by Mr
Denys Jackson were discussed. The
article in the “Catholic Worker” issue of
July, 1959, referred to by your writer
was not the subject of any circular by
Dr Mannix of the nature stated in your
article or so far as I know of any other
action by or on his behalf.
3. On reference to the files of the
“Catholic Worker”. From 1955 onwards
there will be found articles and corres-
pondence relating to Mr Santamaria
and his subversion of Catholic principles
concerning Church-State relations and
political affairs generally to suit the aims
and purposes of the Movement.
When the facts are correctly stated,
and taking into consideration that the
Movement was for an appreciable time
after 1955 still very much an under-
ground affair, the criticism of the “Catho-
lic Worker” set out in your article,
namely, “why since the ‘Catholic Worker’
knew so much about the allegedly ne-
farious activities of the ‘Movement’ it
had waited until 1959, four years after
the ALP Split, to publicise them?” seems
unjustified. The detailed analysis of the
Movement in the July, 1959, issue of the
“Catholic Worker” was in relation to
the sequence of events and the emer-
gence of the facts really quite timely.
T. M. Butler
East Kew (Vic.).
SIR. —I refer to your article “New
Catholic Split” in which your correspon-
dent refers to what he terms the decline
in the “Catholic Worker”. The article
is so hopelessly wrong that it would take
Volumes to correct the many inaccuracies
so I will confine my comment to one of
the points you made.
The decline in the “Catholic Worker”
began a long time before 1959. It began
in 1947 during the coal strike. We op-
posed the freezing of the funds of the
miners by Dr Evatt and lost approxi-
mately 4000 to 5000 copies as a result.
We approved the nationalization of
Banking in 1949 and lost between 5000-
6000 copies. You will appreciate that
both these matters caused considerable
heartburnings in the breasts of the
reactionaries and as a result our circula-
tion fell to 35,000 copies.
In 1954 after full deliberation by my
committee it was decided that we should
not publish our expose of the Move-
ment lest we give more scandal than al-
ready existed. Copies of our proposed
article (never published) were sent to all
members of the hierarchy of Australia.
After Dr Evatt’s dramatic statement and
because certain gentlemen were speaking
at Catholic Communion breakfasts and
the like and stating in most vehement
terms that Catholics who remained in
the ALP were traitors to their Church,
we said in our famous article of April,
1955, that Catholics who remained in the
ALP were not necessarily bad Catholics.
The late Dr Mannix then had cause to
inform his pastors that he was displeased.
Such was the late Archbishop’s prestige
that the word soon got round and the
circulation quickly slumped to 42-
thousand.
Far from declining since 1959 as your
writer suggests the circulation has been
painfully growing to approximately 5000
at the present day.

The Half-forgotten Meteor
" An American Connection is not one that ice would like ”
By ROBERT RHODES JAMES
On a, bleak and desolate January
morning at Blenheim Palace in
1958, while working through a tin
trunk containing Lord Randolph Chur-
chill’s most private papers, in a muni-
ment room scarcely warmer than the
freezing courtyard outside, I came upon
a small visiting-card. It bore the printed
legend:
Mrs Leonard Jerome
The Misses Jerome
and a brief message: “I shall be most
happy to see you at dinner this evening
truly yours C. H. Jerome.”
There was much of great interest in
that large trunk, crammed with unpub-
lished papers and unopened for more
than 50 years, but this was in some res-
pects the most moving discovery of all.
In the vast documentation of Sir Winston
Churchill's life, this small card marks
the very beginning. The beginning of a
great but ill-starred romance. The begin-
ning of a story which ended more than
91 years later.
Lord Randolph Henry Spencer Chur-
chill was only 24 when, at a ball on
board the cruiser Ariadne, lying in
Cowes Roads in August, 1873, he met
Miss Jenny Jerome. He was the younger
son of the seventh Duke of Marl-
borough. Of middle height, he was at
that time, in the words of a friend,
“spruce, polished, but full of fun”, with
eyes so large and protuberant that at
Eton he had been called “Gooseberry”
Churchill, and an already luxuriant
moustache which, as Lord Rosebery
has remarked, “had an emotion of its
own”.
Miss Jerome was the second of the
three beautiful daughters of a remarkable
American entrepreneur, Leonard Jerome.
She was extremely beautiful, with dark
hair and flashing, lustrous eyes. “She had
a forehead like a panther’s,” Margot
Asquith has written, “and great wild eyes
that looked through you.”
They were introduced by a mutual
friend and danced a formal quadrille.
Lord Randolph had the chronic Chur-
chill detestation for music and dancing
and spent the rest of the evening talking
to Miss Jerome. On the following morn-
ing she persuaded her mother, who had
rented a small house nearby, to invite
the young man to dinner. The evening
was a great success. After it. Miss Jerome
confided to her sister that she had a pre-
sentiment that she would marry Lord
Randolph; he, for his part, told a friend
that he admired the two sisters greatly,
and intended to make “the dark one” his
wife.
On the following morning they met
again “by accident” and went for a walk.
Miss Jerome eagerly pressed her mother
A T the heart of the Churchill
story stands the baffling figure
of his father, Lord Randolph. Al-
though they were never close to
each other in life, the influence of
“the dead, failed Lord Randolph”
on his son was profound. In this
revealing outline Robert Rhodes
Janies draws on hitherto un-
published letters.
to invite him again for dinner, but it
appears that Mrs Jerome who, not un-
reasonably, probably had higher ambi-
tions for her daughter than the younger
son of a duke was becoming uneasy.
This was the first small obstacle which
the couple had to surmount. The invita-
tion was duly sent on the visiting-card.
That evening, after dinner, Lord Ran-
dolph proposed to Miss Jerome and was
accepted.
A prolonged struggle then ensued to
gain parental approval for this whirlwind
romance. Mrs Jerome forbade the very
idea of an engagement. The Duke for-
bade the alliance; ‘‘under any circum-
stances an American Connection is not
one that we would like.” His hasty re-
searches into Mr Jerome’s circumstances
had produced unflattering reports. The
Duke had no doubt that “this Mr J.
seems to be a sporting, and I should
think vulgar, sort of man”, and that “it is
evident he is of the class of speculators;
he has been bankrupt once, and may be
so again.” In short, the whole proposal
was one “which no man in his senses
could think respectable.”
Meanwhile, the Jeromes had been in a
comparable emotional turmoil. Although
Mr Jerome had cabled his consent,
American pride and parental affection
were alike deeply offended by the Duke’s
veto. The mother and daughters re-
treated to Paris.
Neither of the lovers was prepared to
submit to the decision of their parents.
Gradually, by all the varied subterfuges,
arguments and even veiled threats of two

very determined young people, the
obstacles to their engagement were over-
come.
The marriage took place on April 15
at the British Embassy in Paris. All
in all, it had been an exhausting and
turbulent eight, months for everyone con-
cerned.
The Churchills installed themselves in
a small house in Curzon Street, and pro-
ceeded to enjoy the delights of the Sea-
son. The glittering world of Society
eagerly courted them. With their newly-
born son and a notable Trench cook they
moved into a more imposing house in
Charles Street in the following year, and
proceeded to live on a more lavish scale
than their relatively modest income war-
ranted. Both were generous and very
extravagant. Indeed, had it not been for
a fortunate speculation at the end of
Lord Randolph’s life, which yielded
some £70,000 at his death—which was
almost entirely exhausted in settling his
debts —his widow would have been left
in unfortunate straits.
Lord Randolph’s political career began
with what became known as the
Aylesford Scandal. Hurling himself im-
petuously into a complicated matrimonial
crisis on behalf of his elder brother,
Lord Randolph involved himself in a
very harsh personal dispute with the
Prince of Wales. The Prince—the leader
of Society—was enraged. When the dust
cleared, the young Churchills found
themselves almost entirely shunned and
isolated. The dispute rumbled on for
years. The full story has not, even yet,
been told.
With his wife and son Lord Randolph
went to Dublin to act as his father’s un-
paid private secretary; Disraeli, to get
Randolph decently ouf of London, had
offered the Duke the Irish Vice-royalty,
and the Duke had felt bound to accept.
It was as spectacular a start as one could
conceive. A lightning romance, MP be-
fore he was 25, and now banishment to
Ireland!
The episode, whatever its short-term
difficulties, had a profound effect on
Lord Randolph’s attitudes. A contempt
for Society entered the very fibre of his
being; he became a dedicated life-long
rebel against what we would now call the
Establishment. “Governments will go
wrong,” he once said, “Parliaments will
go wrong, classes will go wrong, London
Society and the Pall Mall clubs always
go wrong .” This theme recurred again
and again. He channelled his great, but
hitherto dissipated, energies into politics,
which until then had been an agreeable
pastime. He was angry, humiliated, em-
bittered.
The exalted and the vulgar
HThus began one of the most extra-
ordinary political careers of modern
times. In 1880 Lord Randolph was an
almost unknown backbencher; five years
later he was unquestionably second only
to Lord Salisbury in the Conservative
Party. In his heyday he was probably the
most eagerly sought-after speaker in the
country. Vast audiences clamored to
hear him.
His style was a unique blend of the
exalted and the vulgar. He spared no
man and no party. He was more often
than not out of step with his party. More
often than not he was proved right.
Many of his phrases—“an old man in a
hurry”; “Ulster will fight, Ulster will be
right”; “trust the people”; “the function
of an Opposition is to oppose”—have
survived the years. His speeches have a
surprising freshness even today.
Then in December, 1886, he fell
sheer. Chancellor of the Exchequer and
Leader of the House of Commons at the
age of 37, he was completely out-man-
oeuvred by the infinitely wiser and more
ruthless Salisbury. When his draft Bud-
get came under fire in the Cabinet he
threatened resignation. Salisbury, suspi-
cious—and perhaps jealous—of this feb-
rile, uncomfortable lieutenant, accepted
it. There was to be no return, only a
poignant, lengthy struggle against deni-
gration and disease. After 1890—and
probably earlier—he was a stricken man.
“Why recall those last days, except to
recall the pity of them?” Lord Rosebery
has written. “His devoted mother hoping
against hope for his future, his own
feverish energy, the brilliant light flutter-
ing out in the full glare of day. There
was no curtain, no retirement, he died
by inches in public.” He died at the age
of 45 on January 24, 1895—70 years to
the day before the death of his elder son.
While Lord Randolph’s star had
soared across the political sky, his elder
son was growing up. One of his aunts
wrote in the early 1880 s that “Winston
flitted in the background. Randolph is
not much interested in children.”

Nor, really, was Lady Randolph. “I
loved her dearly—but at a distance,” the
son has written. She was deliciously vain,
frivolous but never trivial; highly intelli-
gent, but wholly self-absorbed. It was
only after Lord Randolph’s death that
she and her son drew closer together.
Winston’s nurse, Mrs Everest, took his
mother’s place. “It was to her I poured
out my many troubles, both now and in
my schooldays.”
Winston’s revenge?
Oir Winston wrote in 1930 of his .
father: “Now that I have been reading
over all the letters which he wrote to me
• I feel th at I did not at the time
appreciate how much he thought and
cared for me.” It was a strange, sad, cor-
respondence. Lord Randolph’s letters to
his son were full of rebukes and stern
lectures. He was shocked by his Harrow
reports, of the wanton smashing of win-
dows, of taking a cherished watch to
pieces, and so on. But I suspect that
Lord Randolph was less troubled by this
u' St th 01 SChoolb , 0> ;. mi sdemeanors

Sir Winston’s unpublished letters to
his father, in marked contrast, were full
of charm and a deep yearning to please.
“Although,” he has written, “I had
talked to him so seldom and never for
a moment on equal terms, I conceived
-an intense admiration and affection for
him: and, after his death, for his mem-
ory.” The schoolboy letters are so frank,
lively and intelligent that it is difficult to
understand why his father did not dis-
cern their qualities. But every approach
was chillingly rebuffed. He was told not
to begin his letters “My Dear Papa” but
“Dear Father”— a small but sympto-
matic instruction. When he tentatively
suggested that he might help his father
with his work “he froze me into stone”.
Sir Winston has said that he could only
recall barely three or four conversations
of any length with his father. Towards
the end, matters began to improve, but
“just as friendly relations were ripening
into an Entente, and an alliance or at
least a military agreement seemed
to my mind not beyond the bounds of
reasonable endeavor, he vanished for-
ever.”
Lord Randolph once told a close
friend that he was determined that his
sons should not make the same mistakes
as he had. No doubt he was conscienti-
ously carrying out this duty in those
heavy, daunting, admonitory letters
which the son must have learned to
dread. But my impression of those that
I have seen is principally of their lack
of any discernible hint of affection, let
alone understanding. He hardly knew the
boy.
Lord Randolph's career fascinated the
son. After his father's death he studied
it deeply; he sought out his father's
closest friends to talk about him; when
he went into politics he wore the same
style of clothes—the spotted bow tie, the
stiff shirt, the wing collar and frock-coat
—affected the same mannerisms, and
even spoke in his father’s style. His
voice, even, was uncannily like Lord
Randolph's. He also took over his
father's politics ‘‘unquestioningly'’, as he
himself has said. Indeed, he seemed for
a time determined to continue a family
vendetta against “the old gang’’, “the
old men who croon over the fires at the
Carlton Club", and even the individuals
who had crushed his father.
But I believe that as he studied his
father's career more deeply a shrewder
judgment emerged. Lord Randolph had
to a great extent encompassed his own
downfall, and the son realised the funda-
mental impossibility in politics of fighting
everyone alone. He wrote in 1899 that
“far more important than the pleasing
baubles of honor is the substantial gift of
power”. He took care never to be with-
out a party, nor to indulge in futib
single-handed heroics.
But I also believe that he never lost
sight of the outstanding qualities of his
father—his absolute personal integrity
and his great courage. These were in
many ways his inspiration. Lord Ran-
dolph, that half-forgotten meteor, was
never forgotten in death by the son
whom he hardly knew in life. If the pic-
ture was colored too kindly, who can
cavil at that? The dead, failed Lord
Randolph showed the son the paths to
tread and those to avoid.


REVIEWS
THEATRE
The Passionate Rivals
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Entertaining Mr Sloane. Joe Orton. Old Tote
Theatre, Sydney.
“I never had no family of my own,” says
Mr Sloane, the young thug, to his pros-
pective landlady, the forty-one-year-old
“widow” Kath. “I was brought up in an
orphanage.”
Kath. You have the air of lost wealth.
Sloane. That's remarkable. My parents,
I believe, were extremely wealthy people.
This mixture of a very relaxed attitude
to grammar and a scholarly accuracy in
the reproduction of every possible kind of
cliche gives the dialogue of “Entertain-
ing Mr Sloane” its characteristic incon-
gruity. This is matched by the wild, at
times monstrous, discrepancy between
the stilted gentility of the values and
motives the characters attribute to them-
selves in their conversation and the pure,
unalloyed self-interest of their behavior.
However, this disparity between what
they say and what they do does not
cause any difficulty in communication.
On the contrary, each knows exactly what
the other means. It is just that this
double-think enables them to do whatever
they like while paying lip service to all
the conventions. The only conflicts that
arise are due to an inevitable clash of
interests.
Kath, who, in spite of what everyone
keeps saying, is not a nymphomaniac but
merely untroubled by any conventions or
inhibitions, very quickly comes to an
“arrangement” with Mr Sloane. However,
she has a rival in her homosexual brother.
After Mr Sloane has kicked their elderly
father to death, the brother and sister
finally reach an agreement to share the
young murderer.
The difficulty with black comedy and
the theatre of shock is that the comedy
must be able to contain the horror. The
audience must not feel that it is merely
gratuitous or sensational. The more real-
istic the play the more difficult it is to
manage this. “Entertaining Mr Sloane”
is an awkward mixture of realism and
farce. Because the kicking to death of
the old man is done on the stage and
so is inescapably realistic, one cannot
help asking awkward questions about
the events which lead up to it. The first
two acts build up rather laboriously to
the murder, but in the third act the
action becomes more absurd and much
funnier.
It is hard to judge the play because
of the uncertainties of John Clarke’s
production. It is one of those plays that
do not travel well. Joe Orton’s satire
,on English lower-middle class life
reminds me of Barry Humphries’ satiri-
cal sketches of Australian lower-middle
class life. In order to appreciate Mrs
Everage it is necessary to know the
originals on which she is based. In
“Entertaining Mr Sloane”, Kath, Sloane,
Eddie the brother, and Kemp the
father did not seem familiar. Not that
Gwen Plumb, John Ewart, Alexander
Hay and John Brunskill seemed mis-
cast. But they seemed to be floundering,
to be always slightly off-key. Yet it
was not the avant-garde aspect of the
play that defeated them, but their un-
familiarity with the life from which
these characters were taken. Both Gwen
Plumb and Alexander Hay gave promise
of what could have been very good per-
formances if they had been treading on
firm ground.
“Entertaining Mr Sloane” is one
example of a play for which we did
need to import an English company, or
lure back some Australians who are
familiar with English life at the moment:
in London Kath was played by Madge
Ryan.
LETTER FROM LONDON
British Painters
One occasionally hears it suggested
that the hitherto immense popularity of
Australian painting in London is on the
wane: sometimes the assertion is coupled
with a reference to the very definite
signs of re-emergence of a strong mod-
ern British school of painting. But the
situation is not quite so simple. It is
true that, for the last ten years or so, a
number of Australian painters have been
doing remarkably well in London. By
this I don’t mean only that they have
been financially successful, but that,
having elected to live in London (there
is a cluster of them in Highgate and
Hampstead), they have found themselves
able to work and develop here in an
atmosphere congenial to them. They
have formed fruitful relationships with
English painters.
It was, of course, Nolan who led the
way. Now Boyd, Perceval, Blackman,
Whiteley and several others of widely
varying talents are part of the local
scene. There are no real signs that these
Australians have outstayed their wel-
come: what has, in fact, happened is
that the best of them are finally being
recognised on their own merits as paint-
ers rather than as “Australian painters”.
In this way, they are being assimilated
into the British art world generally. If
British painting is pushing its way to the
fore, this is to some extent due to its
rich diversity, to the fact that its painters
come from India, from Canada, from
(in one instance) Berlin, as well as from
every part of the United Kingdom.
When, some years ago, abstract paint-
ing became fashionable on an interna-
tional scale, the continuing interest here

in Australian painters, most of whom
were not painting abstracts, was as much
an indication of resistance to fashion as
of particular interest in Australian art.
The action painters that followed—and
then, later, the pop artists—helped to
throw taste into a state of dissolution.
For a time it seemed as though the
banality of pop art would triumph. The
coy teases of Rauschenberg and Jasper
Johns, the joyous but essentially trivial
personality of David Hockney, the bleak
up-to-dateness of Peter Blake, all these
had their hour. Much of them remains,
but what survives has done so in a
climate where taste has begun to broaden
again. No longer does one type of art
predominate.
Within the last twelve months there has
been a great deal of talk about kinetic
art. (There have also been one or two,
but no more, quite amusing works of
kinetic art on view.) The arid discussion
ranges from Scriabin, Marinetti and the
Futurists, through such figures as Marcel
Duchamp and Calder to the “spatio-
dynamism” of Nicholas Schoffer. But
in other circles more serious matters
have been discussed. Michael Levey,
the art historian and critic, wrote that
“. . . the artist is allowing himself to be
pushed towards elimination by his dis-
dain of the power of art and his own
preference for playing with things like
objets trouves. That's a game we too
can play. Besides, haven't we had suffi-
cient demonstration that art is a game?
The obsession with optical tricks, for
example, was borrowed from photo-
graphy and could now conveniently be
given back again. We have also read a
lot about the marvellous use of mater-
ials made by this or that artist; some-
times one can hardly tell the artist from
the couturier. Round and round art
goes, decorating the surfaces, dancing
wittily on the edge, brilliantly impro-
vising on the brink of profundity into
which it is so careful never to fall.
The one British painter whose work
does show some degree of involvement
in the human condition is Francis Bacon.
Fortunately, a few younger painters of
intelligence and stature are beginning to
emerge. These post-Bacon painters
include a few already well-known names:
Philip Sutton's work has developed
enormously in the last year or two,
Frank Auerbach is on the verge of be-
coming a major painter, Jack Smith,
Bridget Riley and lan Stephenson are
others one could mention. Amongst the
younger painters, however, two in par-
ticular stand out: Howard Hodgkin and
Patrick Procktor.
Hodgkin, in his early thirties, has had
joint exhibitions with a ffop painter,
Allen Jones, but he belongs outside the
movement. Many of his paintings are of
people indulging in various kinds of
activity, or quite often just sitting. He
uses color in a most original yet very
direct and emotive manner. A healthy
seriousness towards the craft of his art,
and a constant preoccupation with form
pervade his work. He Js, unlike too
many of his contemporaries, not the
kind of painter to take the easy way
out.
Patrick Procktor, still in his twenties,
is more than simply representative of
his own very lively generation of English
artists. Already his best painting can be
seen to have a breadth and a daring
that are rarely found in so young a
painter. He was a Slade student, was
taught by Keith Vaughan, and had his
first London exhibition about eighteen
months ago. He is a Marxist (not, one
gathers, a Communist) and this appears,
in his case, to have given his work a
dignity and generous humanism far re-
moved from any narrowly political com-
mitment. His intelligence and energy,
the richness of his color, and the sheer
virtuosity of his handling of paint, all
combine to make him the most exhilar-
ating of the emergent young artists.

MUSIC
Exotic Birds
Third and Fourth “Prom” Concerts. Town
Hall, Sydney.
The most important works performed in
the first two “Prom” concerts were those
by Webern and Berg. In these concerts
these masters were virtually receiving
their “first time here” (disturbing in the
case of great music over fifty years old).
In the third programme, we advanced
to the highlight of the four concerts
Olivier Messiaen’s “Oiseaux Exotiques”,
for piano and small orchestra. The
prodigiously complex piano part was
played with great insight and virtuosity
by Richard Meale. This 1956 work of
Messiaen incorporates various bird-calls
of India, China and North and South
America. These were played principally
by the woodwind and brass, whilst the
percussion was occupied with Hindu and
Greek rhythms. The piano played other
bird-calls on yet a third level, utilising
fully the resources of the instrument.
This is the second time a Sydney aud-
ience has acclaimed an avant-garde work
recently, thereby completely invalidating
the ABC’s presupposition that Sydney
audiences would not respond to modern
works.
Saint-Saens’ “Carnival of the Animals”,
originally a salon piece for small en-
semble, was written in 1886, when
Wagnerianism was at its height. The
work is really a great artistic parody.
However, much of the satire was missing
in this performance; the musicians tend-
ed to take the work at face value. The
sprinkling of wrong notes from one of
the duo pianists did not add much either
way. The soloists were Lindley Evans
and Frank Hutchens. The Poulenc
“Concerto for Two Pianos and Orches-
tra” with the same performers was given
better treatment. However, with the ex-
ception of the middle movement, which
had a decidedly French charm, the work
did not impress me as Poulenc at his
best. The work lasted twenty minutes, but
seemed to contain enough musical mater-
ial for only half that time. Other works
in these two programmes were by Delius,
Britten and Sibelius.

and lapidary concision alone borders on
legerdemain and will leave connoisseurs
of the craft breathless with admiration.
An odd-man-out, Roberto Matta
Echaurren, universally recognised as one
of the major lacunae of our artistic
culture, is the least pretentious of the
technicians and the strongest artist on
view. He used the etcher’s burr as an
executive instrument for incisive probing
into the penumbral byways of the collec-
tive unconscious. He is the Jung Cin-
derella among many a crafty but other-
wise average prints charming.
The sculptures of Stuart Devlin, at the
Clune Gallery, are round in shape, point-
ed in detail, square in concept and
hollow in content. The principle they
illustrate is simple; radiating from a
point centrally located within a sphere
are rods indicating lines of force of
gravitational pull. The El Alamein foun-
tain at King’s Cross has the identical
operative principle. While the route is
admirably direct, Devlin burdens his
excursions to the core with excessive
baggage. On top of one of his spheres
he has dripped what seems like tons of
gleaming molten brass. It spills down
over the sides and piles up at the base
in such profusion that shining gold
stalactites and stalagmites are formed.
This avant-gaudy technique of splatter-
ing brass only speaks of the sculptor’s
hovering presence like the droppings of
birds and, like them, relates only ac-
cidentally to the sculpture itself.

FILMS
Sending up Westerns
Four For Texas. Director. Robert Aldrich.
Recently at the Regent Theatre, Sydney.
It's a long time since a director has
used a color camera with the intelligent
command of Robert Aldrich in “Four
For Texas”. The sets are brilliantly de-
signed and photographed, and the plot,
a send-up of the conventional Western,
doesn’t have the in-group atmosphere of
Sinatra’s other “rat-pack” films (“Ocean’s
Eleven”, “Sergeants Three"), which were
as dull and irritating as those parties you
sometimes get to by mistake, where every-
body but you knows everybody else and
keeps making oblique and mystifying re-
ferences to their own private jokes.
Possibly it was Aldrich's influence
that kept the Clan’s contribution within
bounds. He is a strong-wiiled director
who always imposes his own idiosyn-
cratic point of view on his films. Al-
drich’s attitude is always anti-heroic; he
is acutely aware of, and amused by, the
streaks of dishonesty and self-interest
which are to be found in everyone.
(Think of “Vera Cruz”, “The Big Knife”,
“Baby Jane” not a heroic character
in the lot!) So in “Four For Texas” the
apparent heroes, Frank Sinatra and Dean
Martin, though they constantly insist
that they are the “good guys”, spend
most of their time cheating the populace
and each other.
The supporting cast is remarkably
adept; I remember with particular
pleasure Charles Bronson's deadpan per-
formance as the dyed-in-the-wool bad
guy, and Victor Buono’s seedy, ingratiat-
ing elegance as a crooked banker.
Robert Aldrich has made his two
female stars a wonderfully absurd parody
of the accepted image of sexiness. Anita
Ekberg, with her pretty face and improb-
able body, wears a fainty amused look as
if she were aware of that; but Ursula
Andress, a large, solemn girl, seems to
take herself with deadly seriousness.
Though occupied in spoofing West-
erns, Robert Aldrich shows a real feeling
for the genre. The opening chase across
the desert leaves John Ford’s “Stage-
coach” sequence (the accepted standard)
asleep at the post.

Destructive Idealists
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Anarchists. James Joll. Eyre & Spottis-
woode. 58s.
Anarchism, as a Left-wing revolutionary
force, is as dead as the dodo. Its death-
rattle was heard in the streets of Barcel-
ona in 1937 when the Spanish Republi-
cans, in the midst of their own desperate
struggle against General Franco, crushed
an anarcho-syndicalist attempt to seize
the great Catalan city. Spain was the
last citadel of Anarchism and, after
World War I, it was the only European
country in which the anarchists had the
slightest chance of achieving their aims.
But, under the inexorable pressures of
the Civil War, the disciplined Marxists
gradually usurped the power of the other
radical parties in the Madrid government.
In the end it was a straight fight between
Communism and Fascism. Once again,
as in Russia in 1917, the Anarchists had
seen their illusions swept away by the
bloody realities of revolution.
However, if Anarchism as both a
revolutionary programme and a utopian
vision appears to be dead, its philosophy
left a permanent mark on the Left-wing
movements of Western Europe. The
Communist parties of France and Italy
owe a good deal of their individualism
and intransigence to lingering echoes
of Proudhon, Babeuf, Bakunin and,
more recently, of Georges Sorel. And,
before we hasten to bury Anarchism as
a bizarre relic of naive 19th-century
political thinking, we might take another
look at the contemporary scene. The old
dynamitards believed that only the com-
plete disruption of society by violence
could clear the ground for its rebuilding
on anarchist principles. Nuclear fission
may give them another chance. As James
Joll laconically remarks in “The Anar-
chists’ : "Perhaps after all the terrorists
were right, and only a bomb on a larger
scale than anything they ever envisaged
can prepare the way for the true social
revolution.”
Other modern sociologists have
claimed that, if we want to find the
latter-day descendants of Ravachol.
Malatesta, Emma Goldman et cie, we
should look for them not at political
meetings but in the haunts of the beat
generation. The beats too, it is suggested,
are in revolt against the materialist and
technological horrors of the age and
their view of society is also essentially
nihilistic. Their protest is not as violent,
no doubt, though moralists might care
to debate the point. Question: Compare
the relative disruptive effects of (a) one
ton of dynamite, and (b) Lenny Bruce.
It is hard now to imagine the out-
bursts of fear and fury that the anar-
chists evoked in the generation before
World War I, when bombs were explod-
ing almost weekly in one European capi-
tal or another. The anarchist was firmly
established in the public mind as a
bearded, cloaked figure nursing a smok-
ing bomb or reeking dagger. Calamities
such as train smashes, mine disasters,
typhoid epidemics and bank robberies
were attributed to anarchist plots. (The
Sacco-Vanzetti Case was a late mani-
festation in America.) However, beside
the sinister figure with the bomb was
another, less sensational, one—the figure
of a mild, bookish idealist, of a Prince
Peter Kropotkin taking tea in the draw-
ing-rooms of English liberals, or a Fran-
cisco Ferrer solemnly preaching the beau-
ties of atheism to his school-children.
“Man is by nature good; it is institu-
tions that corrupt him.” This is the basis
of all anarchist philosophy. If the mon-
strous State machine —with all its para-
phernalia of governments, courts of jus-
tice, police forces and organised religion
—were obliterated then men would in-
stinctively turn to live together in free,
harmonious co-operation. It would be a
frugal life, the anarchists admitted, be-
cause the capitalist system of industry
would naturally be broken down into
much smaller and simpler elements. But
it would be morally much healthier. Had
not Proudhon, whose “property is theft”
was one of the most celebrated anarchist
dogmas, declared that, under the existing
order, “the heart of the proletarian is
like that of the rich, a cesspool of bab-
bling sensuality, a home of filth 'and
hypocrisy”?
There is a kind of muddled, innocent
nobility about all this. How good it is to
be able to believe in original virtue, in-
stead of original sin! The marvel is that,
from the Anabaptists of 16th-century
Germany to the syndicalists of Republi-
can Spain, so many men really did be-
lieve it. The great division in the anar-
chist ranks came in the late 19th century
—the division between those who merely
preached the necessity for destroying the
existing framework of society and those
who, in the “propaganda by the deed”,
carried their principles to their fearfully
logical conclusion. The division between
Kropotkin and, for instance, the French
terrorist Emile Henry, who, when re-
proached for killing innocent people, re-
plied simply: “II n’y a pcis des innocents.”
James Joll has written an excellent
book. There have been numerous bio-
graphies of the more famous anarchists,
and their role in Left-wing politics in
general has been dealt with by G. D. H.
Cole and many others. It could not have
been easy to write a historical survey
of Anarchism; there are so many loose
ends and so many fringe figures. The
whole subject is as confused as anarchist
thought itself. Joll, however, has woven
all the tangled threads into a single
lucid and well-written volume. It is
absolutely necessary reading for anyone
interested in the development of the
revolutionary socialist movement.
Joll’s account of the great socialist
schism at the 1869 meeting of the First
International is particularly good. As he
points out, Anarchism has been a victim
of the “historians’ cult of success”. We
are inclined to forget that, when the fol-
lowers of Marx and Bakunin went their
separate, anathematising ways, it was by
no means clear whether the main revolu-
tionary movement would follow the
clearly roped-off path of Communism or
the more erratic trail of Anarchism. It
was not until after the Russian Revolu-
tion that Marxism really captured the
extreme Left, and the Spanish Civil War
finally dissipated syndicalist dreams in
Western Europe. Yet even now, in the
voices of Communist intellectuals in
France and Italy, there are occasional
notes that Bakunin would recognise as
derived from the purest founts of Anar-
chism.
It is probably true, as Joll says, that
“the strength of Anarchism has lain in
the characters of those who have prac-
tised it”. They are a strange, variegated

Rebel Governor
If Freedom Fail. John Vidler with Michael
Wolff. Macmillan. 325. 6d.
It is no less an achievement to have
helped repair broken lives than to have
commanded great armies, made fine
speeches or acquired large property. But
the world thinks it is lesser; and those
who devote themselves to the most in-
tractable problems that beset mankind
are rarely accorded much recognition.
John Vidler, whose autobiography this is,
served in a sphere which is notoriously
unrewarding. When he retired in 1956 he
had been an English prison governor for
a quarter of a century.
In that time he broke all the rules
governing the administration of prisons,
initiated a revolution in the English
prison system and helped countless men
who were regarded as irredeemable to
reshape their lives. The publishers say
that “today nearly half the governors in
English prisons have served under him at
some time’’. I did so myself.
Those who read this book hoping for
a, clear statement of the ideas which gov-
erned his practice will be disappointed.
Like Thomas Mott Osborne, the reform-
ing warden of Sing Sing, and Anton Mak-
arenko, the great Russian pioneer in the
treatment of delinquents, Vidler's ap-
proach was largely empirical and intui-
tive; and he frequently contradicted him-
self with blithe indifference. So, despite
Michael Wolff's assistance, there is no
careful enunciation of principles. Instead
we get an untidy, racy, entertaining nar-
rative interspersed with humorous and
sometimes moving anecdotes.
Perhaps the clue to Vidler's success can
be found in the all too brief first chapter
entitled “A Stormy Beginning", which
outlines his career prior to becoming a
prison governor. He continually rebelled
against authority: at his private school, at
Oxford, in the Army and as a tea planter
in Ceylon. So when the time came for
him to handle those who were rebellious
and intransigent he knew instinctively
what to do. To him all prisoners were in-
dividuals, never names and numbers on
an official list. And he exemplified the
truth of Pasternak's contention in “Doc-
tor Zhivago”: that in order to do good to
others one needs “an unprincipled heart
—the kind of heart that knows of no
general cases, but only of particular
ones”.

Up the Line to Death. Selected and ar-

30s. 6d.
“Two Brothers” is an impressive poem.
It follows on from “Pantaloon” which
was published three years ago but, as
Philip Toynbee remarks, “the progres-
sion of these poems is not an inclined
plane, as it is in most sequences of
books, but a discontinuous staircase.”
The narrator is a very old Anglo-
Norwegian, Dick Abberville, and he is
speaking in the year 1999 to a person
who is a very young Norwegian-Ameri-
can. The narrator, recalling his youth,
gives us a kaleidoscopic picture of “con-
tinental Europe in the frenzied years
between 1933 and 1936”: and yet the
central theme of the poem is the rela-
tionship between Dick Abberville and
his brother, Andrew, during those years.
Dick Abberville is haunted by the image
of Andrew and the events that lead up
to Andrew being killed. The young
brothers dominate the poem; and
Europe, politics and wars are the back-
ground music of their lives and personal
tragedy.
The devices used to present this poem
may seem involved and idiosyncratic,
and yet they succeed. Toynbee wants
to write about the times and events he
has experienced personally and yet he is
determined to avoid commonplace, re-
miniscential poetry. By placing the
narrator so far away in the future he
finds he can treat his own not-so-distant
past in the way he desires. He also
wants a large canvas, but he does not
want the expatiations that go with the
novel. As a consequence, he has
evolved a structure that enables him to
be as objective and as broad as possible:
the outcome is vivid and powerful.
The verse technique he uses gives him
both freedom and compactness; he em-
ploys an unusual three-lined stanza
which encourages sharp, clear poetry.
The first line is a long and flexible prose-
line that has no less than twenty-five
syllables and no more than thirty-five
syllables, and this is followed by two
lines of five-stressed syllables but, as
the author says, the “couplet seldom
consists of two precise iambic penta-
metres, but this is the metre towards
which it should be felt to tend”.
Though a few lines from such a long
poem cannot hope to show the qualities
of the whole, here is an example to
illustrate the stanza used:
“We were in Paris, you understand,
my brother and 1, in the sleepy
month when the horns and hooters
changed their tune:
The blare of the streets was dulled by
sleep and leaves,
And taxis idled; buses were lolling to
the suburbs.”
Though, in places, “Two Brothers”
shows slight influences of other poets, it
is basically a unique and individual
work.
The main aim of “Up the Line to
Death” has not been to anthologise the
best poems born out of the 1914-1918
war: Brian Gardner sees it as a tribute
to the soldiers who were in that con-
flict. So we find good poems rubbing
shoulders with bad poems like private
soldiers in a common army.
Poems have been arranged in sections,
and each section “tells a part of the
whole story”. The mood of “Happy
is England Now” (Rupert Brooke, John
Freeman), with its tipsy patriotism,
gradually changes to “O Jesus, Make it
Stop”—a section featuring Robert
Graves, Siegfried Sassoon, Isaac Rosen-
berg and Wilfred Owen.
Apart from the obvious poems of
quality, this volume offers pleasant sur-
prises, poems included because they
help the overall picture, but are not as
well known as “Strange Meeting” or
“Dead Man’s Dump”. John Peale
Bishop’s “In the Dordogne” is such a
poem, and so is Herbert Read’s “A
Short Poem for Armistice Day”.

To Catch a Heron
A heron, unlike other birds,
Cannot be caught with salt
Upon the tail, or lured
By false sophistication concerning
Herons. They are not as gauche
As they would seem.
To catch a heron you must learn
The art of stretching up,
To lurch forward
In clumsy match to his lurches.
You must be skilled to tuck
Your head beneath your shoulders
In perfect match to his,
And catch the sunlight
On your hair in equal
Angle to its gleam upon his feathers.
A heron raises inner eyebrows,
Has a secret smile
For moves made too late or soon.
Only when you have perfected
As unmusical a croak as his
Will a heron be moved to admiration
Or affected by soft words.
Never touch a heron too soon:
Those who do find themselves
Suddenly alone
In the sunlight,
Head hunched into shoulders
bent and croaking.

Screwballs

265. 6d.
The Keeper of the House. Shirley Ann
Grau. Longmans. 265. 6d.
In a crummy age the genuine humorist
is becoming a rarity. The funny man has
to look for his joke right outside the
contemporary muddle or, if he is a
satirist, inside it. In the first case little
he can still tell us is half as crazy as
the daily front-page, in the second he is
up against our weariness with an absurd
reality. Even Thurber was sometimes
caught in this fix. Books like Joseph
Heller’s “Catch 22” make us laugh on
the other side of our face.
Peter de Vries is almost in the Heller
class. He is just as clever and his story-
telling power is quite as great, but he
does not have to go to Heller’s extremes
to show how possible the impossible has
become. Deriving his comic gift from
Mark Twain and not from Dean Swift,
and his style from no one but himself,
he tears into his New England pudding
with melancholy fury to get at the
plastic raisins. Everything is ersatz,
except the fury and the wit: finally one
wonders from where these writers take
the courage to handle such discouraging
material.
This time the jest is at the expense
of the commuting class, and the way it
is obsessed with its own psychic struc-
ture, unable to live for eagerness to
know what it is living for. Topsy-turvy
self-analysis is the psychosomatic disease
of an aimless society. A mirror is held
up to it by one of the last men who
enjoys being an outsider, old Spoffard,
the chicken-breeder. This is a charac-
ter any humorist would be proud of.
An American Felix Krull, a half-taught
Montaigne of the suburbs, he insinuates
himself into the local upper-bracket in
the hope of one day writing a book
about it. So doing he nearly wrecks
his peace of mind, acquires some pity
for the sophisticated misfits whom he
studies, makes a mess of his public and
domestic relations and puts his beautiful
granddaughter squarely on the road to
losing her chastity.
Spoffard himself is a screwball, and
de Vries’ technique consists in letting
one madness reflect itself in another,
healthier, one. As, by slow degrees,
the hero turns into an insider, the brittle-
ness of mere cynicism is shown up. This
compels a change of view and of dic-
tion, so that there are big slabs of
straight narrative between sections of
magnificent verbal hilarity. The story

operates on three fronts: Spoffard and
his household (in opposition to the new
pace-setters of the town of Woodsmoke),
Spoffard and the commuting set (whose
men he despises but whose women make
his loins itch), and Spoffard and another
variety of out-grouper —two Britons
visiting the States.
One of these is McGland, a Scots
poet, and the other Mopworth, a literary
journalist from London who follows
McGland’s spoor. McGland and Mop-
worth each have a short novel to them-
selves, cunningly built into the general
scheme. McGland's is not funny at all:
he is a transistorised Dylan Thomas on
his last legs. Nearer the mark, he is
on his last tooth. This Mac is so hard
driven by his glands that no woman is
safe. A fashionable Woodsmoke den-
tist avenges his cuckoldom on the pathe-
tic beast by depriving him of his last
molar, a humiliation to which Mc-
Gland's answer is suicide. Even Spof-
fard's granddaughter cannot save him,
since innocence is now only an aphrodi-
siac.
But she almost saves Mopworth. His
trouble is that he is averagely keen on
girls, hence in the eyes of Woodsmoke a
repressed homosexual. Nothing he does
can prove his normalcy to people who
know that everything is the opposite of
what it seems. How the ill undo the
well is the grand theme, grandiosely
realised, of the last part. That a book,
whose characters literally talk each other
to death, should be as sparklingly enter-
taining as “Reuben. Reuben” is a mar-
vel. It's a work of considerable stat-
ure, perhaps a minor classic of its kind.
Shirley Ann Grau comes to grips with
the sickness of the South in yet another
clan saga. The blurb sums it up un-
usually well.
“Going back two generations of How-
lands— a middle-class family with a
blood-stained history as early settlers in
Gulf Coast territory—Miss Grau sows
the seed of her story when Will How-
land, a widower, meets a young Negro
who becomes his housekeeper and mis-
tress and bears him children. Years
later, Abigail, his only white grand-
daughter, who has grown up in this
mixed-blood family, marries a segrega-
tionist politician, and the Howland past
is exposed. The brutal response of the
white community and Abigail’s devasta-
ting reprisal provide a chilling climax to
this beautifully written novel.”
It all sounds much too traditional, but
the claims are, if anything, understated.
The writing is indeed beautiful and the
subject, tackled many times before,
asserts itself with distinction. The
characters twist and twitch, but not like
puppets, and the climax not only chills
the blood, it chills the soul.

International Intrigue
Funeral in Berlin. Len Deighton. Jonathan
Cape. 235.
Though cast in the lan Fleming mould,
Mr Deighton's new book has enough
vitality in its own right to make it more
than an imitation. Written with panache
and wit the novel especially triumphs in
its characterisation, with at least half-
a-dozen vivid characters: a Russian
colonel who loves to tell anti-Communist
jokes; a chief in the British Secret Service
with a passion for cultivating weeds; a
penny-pinching queer from Whitehall
who provides the book’s final surprise
and the weird climax at a Guy Fawkes
bonfire; and the wise-cracking, imper-
turbably resourceful hero and narrator.
Ostensibly, the book deals in the de-
fection of a Russian expert on enzymes
and the hero’s effort to organise his
transport to England with the assistance
of said Russian colonel, a double-agent
called Vulcan, and an underground
political society in Berlin. But the in-
tervention of a beautiful redhead and
an ex-SS man retired to Spain suggest
complications below the surface.
The book stands up to re-reading.
There is the joy of picking up all the
clues which unnoticed before,
and one is able to give more attention
to the byplay—for example, the hero
showing his boss, in the middle of a
serious conference, how to make a paper
ladder out of the “New York Herald
Tribune” (“By George, it's very long,
isn’t it?”).
At one point, the Russian colonel
compares the situation in Europe to a
game of chess and, taking up the idea,
the author heads nearly every chapter
with a quotation from some chess
manual. But this is not such a good
idea. Nor is the use of footnotes to
explain Secret Service jargon—these are
merely an irritating distraction. And
who would bother to read the appen-
dices? There is the same fascination for
the erudite that characterises Fleming’s
books—whether it be on the subject of
twelve-note music or the locomotive,
military history or hedgerow flowers;
and there are predictably voguish refer-
ences to Bartok, Czech animated films,
Darjeeling tea and William Morris.

Woman’s Misery
The Useless Sex. Oriana Fallaci. Michael
Joseph. 265. 6d.
Oriana Fallaci, an Italian journalist who
lives in Milan, was sent by her editor on
a trip around the world to report on the
life and lot of women in various coun-
tries. The result is a light-hearted record
of her travels with the theme as a pivot
rather than a systematic and exhaustive
investigation. From complete subser-
vience to men in Pakistan to the subjec-
tion of the male in New York, she finds
the lot of women “an abysmal, utterly
stupid unhappiness and, basically, agrees
with the Rajkumari in India, who says:
. . all the women in the world are the
same and want the same things: a family,
a home, money enough to manage on,
freedom.”
In India, China, Hawaii and Japan, she
found evidence of speedy emancipation
and Western “contamination” (from
bound feet to inflatable brassieres) but it
is the end product of emancipation in
New York which appears to disillusion
her most. She has nothing to say about
the women of her own country, which is
a pity.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Tariffs or Hypocrisy?
The firm stand of Australia’s repre-
sentative, Mr A. T. Carmody, at
the GATT meeting in Geneva last
week should not pass unnoticed. Too
often GATT members sign a document
and then seek loopholes to escape
their commitment wherever conve-
nient.
Mr Carmody, backed up by Mini-
ster for Trade and Industry, Mr J.
McEwen, refused to sign a GATT
amendment, already agreed to by 28
members. He took the stand that Aus-
tralia, at this stage of its development,
cannot afford to make across-the-board
tariff concessions to less developed
countries.
Under the proposed amendment,
which requires a two-thirds majority
from GATT’s 64 members, all mem-
bers other than the less developed
countries would be obligated to re-
frain from imposing any new tariffs
on products of present or future inter-
est to the less developed countries.
Also, they would be obliged to reduce,
and eventually eliminate, existing
tariffs on these goods.
This may be fine for the highly in-
dustrialised countries which need to
import agricultural products and raw
materials, and which already may be
selling a high volume of manufactured
goods to the less developed countries.
Obviously the undeveloped countries
cannot afford to go on buying manu-
factured goods unless they find addi-
tional markets for their primary pro-
ducts. At whose expense?
Such a situation presents real dif-
ficulties for countries like Australia,
which also rely on the export of pri-
mary products. They must compete
on world markets, both for basic mate-
rials and manufactured goods, yet
grant tariff concessions as well. The
theory of tariff concessions is fine, if
you can afford it and you don’t get
hurt. But the plain truth is that Aus-
tralia cannot afford such a sweeping
provision on tariffs.
In defence of Australia’s attitude,
Mr McEwen explained that the Aus-
tralian Government supports the gene-
ral objective of the new articles but it
cannot waive its right to give pro-
tection to Australian industry where
it is judged to be necessary.
Signatories to GATT have demon-
strated in the past that quota restric-
tions are quickly applied when local
producers squeal loud enough. Aus-
tralia has a better record than most
countries in its treatment of imports
from the under-developed countries, as
Mr McEwen was quick to point out.
So it is performance which really
counts.
Apart from the setback to primary
producers which blanket tariff conces-
J. McEWEN
sions would cause, Australia’s balance
of payments (on current account)
would look sick indeed if exports of
primary products took another knock.
At the other end of the pincers, im-
ports of manufactured goods are ris-
ing. In fact, the Japanese Ministry of
Trade has been constrained to ask
vehicle exporters to exercise voluntary
restraint since the flow of Japanese
vehicles to Australia jumped above
an annual rate of around 16,000 vehi-
cles.
An explanation advanced for the
sudden rush of Japanese vehicles in
recent months is that importers have
been stockpiling to beat a possible
rise in duty from 35 p.c. to 50 p.c.
Looking at another part of the tariff
picture, Japan is expected to request
a reduction in tariffs on machinery and
equipment to the British Preferential
rate of 11 p.c., so that Japan can sup-
ply Australia with the £125 million of
equipment likely to be used in the
mining and shipment of iron ore.
As Japan is the only iron ore custo-
mer, she feels she has a point.
It is not a happy time for the tariff
makers, with pressures coming from
all sides, especially when the Com-
monwealth Government has given
notice of further nibbles at the over-
seas reserves with its latest £156 mil-
lion defence purchases in America.
Sense without Hypocrisy
almost the precise time as Mr
McEwen put Australia’s position
on the new GATT amendment, the
AMP’s economist, Dr Harold Bell,
was using very similar words to the
International Chamber of Commerce
conference at New Delhi. Befitting the
meeting place, Dr Bell perhaps sound-
ed a little gentler than the Minister
for Trade.
He first welcomed the “broad ten-
tative agreement that the proposed
across-the-board reductions in indus-
trial tariffs would not be binding on
newly developing countries”. Then
immediately came a reasoned defence
of the Australian “intermediate” situ-
ation.
Australia is certainly not a mature
industrial nation, Dr Bell argued,
though it really cannot be ranked with
the “less developed” countries. With a
still large dependence on the export
of primary products, there also went
diverse and growing manufacturing
industries, and a high living standard.
“Whilst the Australian economy
may be able to make some additional
opportunities available for the limited
entry of products from the lesser deve-
loped nations, any adherence to an
across-the-board reduction in tariffs
could cripple its recently built and
recently expanded industry.” Thus Dr
Bell in Mr McEwen’s terms.
Most persuasively and sensibly Bell
added that any crippling of Australian
industrialisation would “lessen the
contribution it may be able to make
in various ways to help reduce the gap
in welfare between the developed and
the developing countries”. There is
certainly no doubt that definite con-

so, as a very rich and fortunate

Brake on Dollars
T atest moves by the US to curb the
outflow of dollars and reduce the
balance of payments deficit of three
billion dollars are more drastic than
some people expected. Although
warnings were issued that the Interest
Equalisation Tax on securities might
be extended for another two years to
December 1967, this caused a beat-the-
gun attitude from many businessmen,
who were pouring money directly or
indirectly into American commercial
projects in foreign countries.
Now, under the new legislation,
overseas bank loans of one year or
more to developed countries will bear
the tax and the US banking com-
munity has been asked bluntly to limit
its lending abroad.
Defence and foreign aid spending
abroad is to be cut, staffs reduced and
local purchases by US overseas organ-
isations to be switched as far as pos-
sible to US suppliers..
One of the pressures on the US dol-
lar has come from the very successful
empire - building of US commercial
interests in Europe and Japan which,
although earning profits and accumul-
ating assets, requires loans or direct
dollar investment. Now, with loans
taxed and pressure put on the banks,
the rate of overseas expansion should
slow.
Free-spending American tourists
also are expected to be slugged under
the proposed legislation to cut duty-
free exemptions on the items they
bring back from their travels.
The net effect should put a solid
brake on the overseas flow of dollars—
an influence that could have a marked
effect on the dollar earnings of most
countries.
Defence and Development
I>Y sounding a warning about the
strain of defence on resources the
Federal Treasurer Mr H. E. Holt,
gave just the right cocktail to the feast
of economic papers now down for the
main courses in Melbourne’s summer
school of banking and its symposium
on investment in Australia. Even by
the end of the week most participants
will be lucky to escape mental indi-
gestion, if no other.
A week or so earlier Mr Holt had
put the defence writing on the wall
by saying capital spending within Aus-
tralia would more than double next
year and we were to buy £156 million
more for defence equipment in the
United States during the next three
years, apart from what we had already
ordered for aircraft and ships. A
couple of days after he spoke to the
bankers in Melbourne the contract for
this extra supply was signed in Wash-
ington. With extended terms of pay-
ment the outlays involved will not put
an immediate strain on our overseas
reserves, but they will eventually take
their toll.
“it is worth observing,” the Treasu-
rer said, “that the diversion of re-
sources to military purposes can be
a drag on economic development and
it is not without significance that coun-
tries with high growth rates in the
post-war period have not had to spend
heavily on defence, while countries
that have carried a big defence burden
have not achieved the most impressive
rates of growth.”
Mount Isa Shadow
disastrous social, political and
economic effects of the Mount Isa
dispute are now more than a national
byword. Even the London “Times”
has remarked that the strike is not
just “a local labor dispute” and has
also drawn attention to its influence
on the sharp rise in world copper
prices, “which had been falling this
month”.
A measure of purely domestic dam-
age was provided last week by a pro-
minent manufacturing company, which
believes that about £1 million a week
is being added to Australia’s copper
fabricating costs.
Imports of copper have already run
up to nearly 34,000 tons, some of
which have been priced as high as
£640 a ton against a previous Aus-
tralian price of £340 a ton!

situation on page 68.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Riding the Imports Tiger
The choices if sterling devalues
XpEARS for the balance of payments ex-
A pressed last week by Mr A. R. John-
ston, general secretary of the United
Farmers and Woolgrowers’ Association of
NSW, on the strength of the record
£ 125.8 m. monthly imports bill in January
would seem premature.
In conjunction with a slight weakening
in exports to £110.4 million (£121.7m.
the previous January), the imports rise
has meant a widening of the adverse visi-
ble trade gap to £71.8 million for the first
seven months of 1964-65 (compared with
a surplus of £128.1 million for the same
period in the previous year). However,
thanks to a continuing high rate of capital
inflow, our international reserves have
only come down by about £5O million
since reaching £851.4m. last
June and in the latest week
showed an improvement of
£5.5 million to keep them
above £BOO million.
Only a supreme pessimist
could read into this the need
to re-impose import restric-
tions here and now. Mr
Johnston, mindful of the
fact that the 1960 credit
squeeze was born out of
fears of a threatened balance
of payments crisis, sees a
similar situation developing.
Admittedly with the daily rate of im-
ports up to £6.3 million (as against £5.6
million last October, the previous highest
month), the imports tiger is rampant. It
has to be remembered, though, that Janu-
ary took up the slack from a more holi-
day-prone December on the wharves. So
even if the trade gap about doubled to
£15.4 million compared with December,
it would still probably remain essentially
manageable for the rest of this financial
year and for capital inflow to provide
adequate comfort for our international
reserves.
True enough, demand for imports has
risen substantially in recent months, re-
flecting on the one hand more buoyant
retail spending (in the December quarter,
1964, retail sales excluding motor vehicles
were 6.5 p.c. higher than the same quarter
1963) and, on the other, record invest-
ment in fixed capital equipment and pro-
ducer goods (which make up about two-
thirds of imports). Apart from imports
of such goods only procurable from
overseas sources, local manufacturers of
producer goods are at full stretch. This
A. R. JOHNSON
has put more of a strain on imports than
would otherwise be the case.
The extent to which imports will rise
in the coming months as a result of these
internal pressures can only be guessed at
but, given another month or two at the
daily rate, a first step would
hardly lie in dampening down through
import restrictions but more in tighten-
ing credit. This seems likely to happen
in any case, because banks are in fact
approaching a tight credit season both for
seasonal reasons and also as a result of
Dr Coombs’ instructions to them last
October to reduce their rate of new
lending. Equally, if the decline in over-
seas reserves persists, this would exert an
additional moderating influence on credit.
To impose import restric-
tions at this stage would ex-
acerbate internal leavening
pressures in the economy.
We are in the happy posi-
tion of being able to let im-
ports run on strongly as a
buffer to inflationary ten-
dencies. While capital inflow
is strong and export income
stays reasonably high, it
would be economically un-
sound not to take advantage
of this situation. In other
circumstances restraints on
credit would have to be stronger to damp-
en demand here to stop economic activity
racing away. In this respect our situation
is the antithesis of that in the UK, which
has put on a measure of import restric-
tions through a 15 p.c. surcharge on im-
ports to reduce its huge trade gap.
Even so, if Mr Johnston seems to be a
little early on the scene in recommending
import restrictions here, what he has to
say certainly has relevance to our cur-
rency link with Britain and, in particular,
to what choice Australia should make in
the event of sterling being devalued. The
choices are whether the £A should go all
or part of the way down with sterling or
not at all (that is maintain its present
parities with non-sterling currencies).
For the moment sterling has weathered
the storm, so we are not immediately
faced with these choices. Recent UK
trade figures show an improvement and
sterling area reserves rose by £stg6 mil-
lion in January (albeit by some admitted
drawing on the $3OOO million central
banks’ credit, whose repayment deadline
was the end of May). Hot money has not,
from all accounts, begun to return to
London despite the continuance of a
7 p.c. bank rate, but apparently some
bears of sterling have been closing their
operations and, despite the Bank of Eng-
land refurbishing its supply of dollars,
sterling has improved.
For all that, the imbalance of the
British economy is uncorrected and the
consequent strains on its balance of pay-
ments continue. So, projecting the situa-
tion eight months ahead to September,
when payments for UK imports reach
their peak, it could well be that sterling
will again come under acute pressure and
devaluation might be forced on it. It is
also conceivable that, given the continu-
ance of an unfavorable trade balance, by
that time Australia’s reserves will be sub-
stantially reduced from their present high
levels and we could be looking for means
to avoid further attrition in them. In
those circumstances the case for follow-
ing, any devaluation of sterling at that
time would be stronger than it would be
at this juncture.
In short, we would then be looking
more closely than we need to at the mo-
ment at possible ways for reducing im-
ports and expanding exports, the twin
results generally to be expected from the
devaluation of a currency. Whether —and
this is a far more difficult exercise in fore-
casting—the economy would be in a less-
vulnerable position than it is now to
withstand the inflationary impact of de-
valuation is, of course, very questionable.
The answer to the latter would depend
largely on how successful the authorities
were in dampening down demand here in
the meantime. Given the current buoy-
ancy of investment and personal con-
sumption, coupled with the mounting
commitments for Government expendi-
ture, this would be an extremely difficult
operation.
Frankly there seems little likelihood of
the economy being more sober in Sep-
tember than it is now. On the other hand,
despite the weakness of some exports (Mr
Adermann told the Australian Agricultu-
ral Council last week exports of rural pro-
ducts would drop by £l2B million this
year, including falls of £62 million in
wool, £57 million in wheat and £2l
million in sugar), it is possible that the
likes of Mr Johnson are envisaging a
much more rapid run down in reserves
than will prove to be the case. In these
events the situation in eight months’ time
would be no more propitious for devalua-
tion of the £A than it looks to be now.

sumer prices’ rise in 1950, following the

1949 devaluation, is not one we want
repeated (admittedly the Korean com-
modity price boom and the final removal
of war - time restrictions by the new
Menzies Government joined with deva-
luation in helping to promote that).
Yet we would run similar dangers
should we devalue with the economy
going flat out, whether it is now or in
eight months’ time. Apart from avoiding
them, there are other good reasons
why we would stand to gain by main-
taining the-value of the £A should ster-
ling devalue.
For instance, in terms of Australian
currency we would have to pay less for
goods bought in Britain, still - a prolific
source of imports, particularly of pro-
ducer goods which comprise the bulk
of our import requirements. There
would be strong protests from Australian
manufacturers of equivalent goods about
this, but there would be overall benefits
to the economy. If we elected to de-
value with sterling we would have to
pay more in Australian currency terrns
for imports from non-sterling sources,
which have become increasingly impor-
tant in recent years.
Of course in not following a sterling
devaluation there would be adverse,
effects on the incomes of Australian ex-
porters. In particular, so far as we are
endeavoring to expand exports of
manufactured goods to sterling area
markets like South-East Asia, this would
be unfortunate. However, with more of
Australian exports now going to non-
sterling countries, the effects on export
incomes would not be nearly as serious
as, say. fifteen years ago. Australian
currency returns on the sale of wheat to
China, our biggest market, or wool to
Japan would not be affected. Those
from base metals, sugar, dairy produce
and fruit, which are sold mostly in Bri-
tain, would be.
Perhaps the opposition from exporters
to maintaining the value of the £A in
face of a devaluation of sterling would
be hardly as strong as, say, it would
have been had they been asked their
opinion when Mr Chifley slavishly fol-
lowed sterling down without warning in
1949. The overall effect on their in-
comes would not be as drastic as many
of them might suppose. Such cuts as
occurred would at least have some merit
in the general economic context as being
mildly deflationary, not that this is
likely to carry much weight with them
(the Bureau of Agricultural Economics
estimates that total farm income will be
down about £2O million this year from
last year's record of £724 million).
Aside from these local sectional issues,
unfortunately if sterling were devalued
we would not escape a loss of purchasing
power in the bulk of our overseas re-
serves. From that viewpoint it is im-
material whether we followed it down
or not. Any attempt to emulate France,
say. to minimise such a loss by switch-
ing some of our sterling reserves (pre-
sently estimated at roughly £6OO million
or about three-quarters of our total
overseas reserves) into non-sterling cur-
rencies before sterling was devalued
watrfd only hasten that event, which it
is in our best interest to avert as most
of our international transactions are
financed through sterling.

Three Cheers for Sydney
Lively tongues in finance circles
"EVen with tongue in cheek and distance
lending enchantment, a Sydney
scribe's “three cheers for Melbourne”
(“The Sydney Morning Herald”, Jan. 8)
is a generous gesture.
But Sydneyites should come south
more often for conversation pieces to
taste Melbourne's real inhibited essence,
as they will be doing in large numbers
this week for the Stock Exchange of
Melbourne's symposium on Investment in
Australia. They may possibly find “wag-
ging it” is rather foreign to Melbourne's
financial luminaries. As I re-discovered
last week: for lively tongues to tell of
what's ticking in finance circles give me
Sydney any day.
Not that at the Sydney Stock Exchange
last week I found Mr A. H. Urquhart,
the chairman, or Mr David Butcher, the
secretary, any more forthcoming on
either official or brokers’ views about the
proposed national stock exchange for
Canberra than their Melbourne counter-
parts. Certainly, they denied that the cur-
rent review of commissions by the Sydney
Exchange has anything to do with the
threat of lower scales .of commissions
being introduced by the proposed rival
exchange. Indeed, Mr Urquhart empha-
sised that the review had been initiated
long before the Canberra exchange pro-
posal had reached his committee’s ears.
Be that as it may, the review has been a
long time coming.
Efforts to improve the public image of
the Stock Exchange in Sydney are ap-
parently just as strong as in Melbourne,
which has had to turn its cheek to the
taunts of “Casino! - ’ before this. Sugges-
tions that trading for a two or three week
account on London lines be introduced
on Australian stock exchanges are not ac-
ceptable. Indeed, it was pointed out that

improvements in the transfer system
aimed, among other things, to eliminate
the runs afforded speculators by speeding
deliveries of scrip.
Equally, Sydney is as cold as Mel-
bourne on the idea of introducing trading
on margin, which par exemple is facility
to abet speculation but one which even
the Securities Exchange Commission in
A. H. URQUHART
the US does not grudge the stock ex-
changes there, and is seen by the authori-
ties as a flexible device for both stimula-
ting as well as retarding stock exchange
activity.
This conservative attitude towards
speculation would seem more appropriate
to Melbourne than to Sydney. When
option dealing started in Australia about
four years ago, it was Sydney’s stock
brokers who cocked a snook at Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange members and
came to the party without delay. Here
was an innovation which, it was thought,
all would welcome to introduce more
speculation into stock markets, much
needed here to thicken and even steady
markets which are still prone to get too
much one way. But Melbourne brokers
wouldn’t play with what they deemed a
speculative device. They are still only
lukewarm on option trading.
In a country where a new TAB office
springs up almost daily, it needs explain-
ing why the stock exchanges now seem
more determined than they have ever
been to deter the speculator. Perhaps this
is because, as Mr Urquhart explained,
after burning their fingers in the 1960
boom, the public's faith in ordinary
shares has taken a long time to be re-
established.
Also outside the stock exchange, finan-
ciers and businessmen in Sydney are
much more forthcoming than their fel-
lows in Melbourne, though whether what
they have to tell you is as important is
another matter. At any rate, occasionally
they let the cat out of the bag.
It seems only yesterday (it was actually
in November, 1960, just after the Trea-
surer had sprung his economic emergency
measures) that in the same week three
Sydney financiers, Messrs Ron Irish, John
Marks and Ray Purves, in three separate
conversations in Sydney told me they
were scandalised at the tax on interest
proposal. One of them even sent off a
telegram to the Government in protest.
Now one learns that a Sydney financier
has advised the Vernon Committee to
recommend a discriminatory tax-on-in-
terest be put on fixed interest borrowings
on the Australian capital market by over-
seas companies operating here. A nice
talking point for the galaxy of overseas
investors attending this week’s proceed-
ings at the Southern Cross! This is one
sleeping Treasury dog to let lie.
While this is one subject on which
silence by financiers and businessmen
should be golden, the more.we hear about
the operations and scope of the inter-
company market the better. More mys-
tery is wrapped around the latter in
Melbourne than practically any other
realm of finance. We know the banks are
sore about it and so are some finance
houses who have made initial introduc-
tions between inter-company lenders and
borrowers and got a first commission
whereafter they have been isolated from
any future lending done and also any
commission. In Sydney the veil over this
market is less opaque.
Sydney inter-company money market
(strictly unofficial!) operators are also
much more open about their attitude to
the Federal Treasurer’s proposals for in-
troducing a commercial bill market than
any of their fellows around Collins Street,
even when the latter come out of their
back rooms, which is seldom. The general
opinion seems to be that it will still be
business as usual for the inter-company
market, which is believed to have around
£2OO million of loose funds to play with.
(Most of the business is transacted in
Sydney, where there are about twenty
companies involved.) One opinion ex-
pressed was that a rival bill market
wouldn't make headway until a big deal
went sour in the inter-company market
and this is not thought likely to happen.
This spontaneous market is not looking
for acceptance houses to put their signa-
tures on any paper they may happen to
use for their transactions, nor for dis-
counting or re-discounting facilities such
as would be afforded by a full-flung bill
market with last resort facilities afforded
by Dr Coombs (the initial proposals don't
actually provide for these but they may
come eventually).
Against this there seems to have been
rather a rush in the last week or so,
especially by overseas merchant bankers,
to get in on the ground floor of the pro-
posed bill market. Such smoke may be-
token more fire than the inter-company
operators are envisaging. Now that the
Federal Treasurer has given the trading
banks their cue to play a predominant
role in the development of the market,
they have been strengthening their exper-
tise by enlisting more overseas expertise.
But to cut into the inter-company market
on any scale will require denying it the
present guarantees it enjoys from un-
used overdraft limits of inter-company
borrowers with the banks themselves.


Good Market for Rural Land
The hindrance of restricted title in NSW
T>oom sales of country land recently
■* u, have resulted in a scarcity of good
quality properties for sale around Aus-
tralia. During inflationary periods land,
especially agricultural land, is a readily
saleable commodity. It is probably the
only one which seems continuously to
appreciate in value.
NSW has been severely affected by
the buying spree. In Victoria, where land
is naturally scarce, the positon has be-
come even tighter. Good quality land in
Queensland is also in short supply. An
exodus of buyers from Eastern States
to the West is causing a similar shortage
of high quality acreage.
There has also been a migration of
men on the land from Victoria and
South Australia to NSW and Queens-
land, so property prices are reaching all-
time highs. This, say experts, is cyclical
and always happens when money is
readily available. Not all land purchases,
of course, are made to guard against
inflation. There has been a large capital
outflow from professional men in the
cities. This buying serves a dual pur-
pose it gives them a legitimate tax
deduction and adds an important invest-
ment to their portfolios. One country
property agent The Bulletin spoke to
said many professional men at present
preferred to put idle capital into land
rather than (as they traditionally do)
into the share market, which at the
moment is in a state of flux with local
and international troubles and uncertain-
ties hanging over it.
There is also a great deal of overseas
interest in Australian agricultural land.
It is coming mainly from the United
States, United Kingdom and New Zea-
land.
The greatest number of enquiries is
coming from US investors and farmers,
with a great deal of capital to put into
beef, cotton and mixed farming. New
Zealanders are looking for A 1 sheep
country to develop to their own stand-
ards, while UK enquiries cover- the
whole gamut of farming.
Intending purchasers from the US
often have little or .no idea of Australia’s
agricultural set-up and are seeking good
“ranching country” or asking questions
on farming conditions that would need
a whole volume to answer. Overseas in-
terest in Australian land, one agent said,
stems from the fact that we still have
vast, undeveloped tracts of land and
stable government to go with it.
“There’s still a lot of land in South
America and Africa, but the govern-
ments there are so changeable that the
landholder has no idea of what could
happen to his investment.”
Most of the agents The Bulletin
interviewed were reluctant to be quoted.
They are a tight-knit group, as indeed
they must be, for they are part of Aus-
tralia’s agricultural backbone.
An executive of one large pastoral
company said that the land market at
present was still quite good. “There has
been a large surge forward over the last
12 to 18 months, in land buying and
land exchange. There have been a num-
ber of contributing factors. Firstly there
have been generally high wool values,
although the 25 p.c. drop in values
during the current selling season will
probably result in a tapering off of
enquiries for a while. Secondly there
have been three good wheat seasons in
a row, with no blanks in NSW. Thirdly
there has been quite a bit of city-earned
capital looking for a permanent home
on a long-term capital gain basis. As
well as for long-term capital gain, city-
earned profits are being ploughed into
land where they can save the investor
a considerable amount of tax.
“Fourthly you have the strong over-
seas enquiries, usually for major
amounts of £lOO,OOO and up. This
comes about because overseas people
realise that Australia is growing and has
great potential in the agricultural field.
Some investments are being made by
people who remain overseas and appoint
a manager here, but most of the pur-
chases are made by people who settle
here.
“Lastly, but certainly not least, there
is a growing scarcity of reasonable
quality land in other States, particularly
in South Australia and Victoria. Interest
from these States in NSW land is causing
a scarcity here. With the money avail-
able at present there is quite a bit of
adjoining property being purchased.
Take, for instance, three adjoining
holdings, A, B, and C. A and C are buy-
ing out B to extend their holdings, per-
haps to pass on to their sons when they
get married. What happens to B? If
land is scarce in his State he must look
elsewhere. A and C at the moment can
afford to pay out large sums for im-
proved properties. B is equally happy,
because he’s been paid a good price
and can afford to buy another, perhaps
bigger property and develop it. B is
looking at the moment at Western Aus-
tralia, NSW and Queensland.
Another rural land agent said the
move interstate was a big factor in land
values in northern NSW. “They are
definitely cheaper than in the southern
half, so there has been a wave of inter-
state buying. The scarcity of land in
NSW has forced its values along. In the
New England area, for instance, values
have increased by up to 100 p.c. in the
short period of 18 months. It has great
potential and because of the high rain-
fall is excellent pastoral land.
“Now we are in the position of having
a scarcity of land and a large unsatis-
fied demand. With the lower wool prices
at present, I think we’ll see a levelling
off in the boom and values won’t go
further ahead for quite a while. The
move forward has expended itself.”
There will come a time when the
scarcity of land reaches a peak in NSW
and there will be a move into Queens-
land. The brigalow country is being
developed and there is a great deal of
interest being shown in land there. A lot

of people who can afford to get in on

A big problem with land in NSW is
the restricted title. NSW has just under
200 million acres, which includes about
97 million acres in the Eastern and Cen-
tral divisions and 78 million acres in
the Western division. In the Eastern and
Central divisions about 60 p.c. of the
land is unrestricted title, the balance
being subject to some form of restriction
and needing Ministerial consent to
transfer.
Freehold or leasehold unrestricted title
land can be transferred, split up or sold
without the Minister for Lands’ permis-
sion. However, restricted title land is a
horse of a different color. Before it can
be transferred the Minister for Lands’
consent must be given. He is able to re-
fuse consent without giving any reason.
He can also bar professional men and
women from holding restricted title land
unless they sell up their business and
the land becomes their sole source of
income.
Mr Harold Bridge, a property agent,
feels very strongly about what he calls
“the mistakes of restricted title.” He
says there is a political objection to the
“Pitt Street farmer” or “the commercial,
industrial, and professional man or
woman who wishes to invest surplus
funds or income in the improvement
and development of country lands.
“Admittedly this has taxation advan-
tages, allowed by the Commonwealth
Government, which realises that the
betterment of land is in the interests of
the nation and that increased production
of valuable exports follows. The State
as a whole owes a lot to the investment
of surplus money by commercial and
professional men. People like the Falk-
iners (who originally stemmed from
storekeeping in Ararat, Victoria), the
Pratten families (Malayan tin mines),
Martin Mcllrath (grocery), T. A. Field
and his brothers (butchers), and many
more have spent vast sums on general
improvement of their properties and
given much employment to country
workers of all kinds.”
Mr Bridge quoted cases of profession-
al men who were refused permission to
buy land because they intended to keep
their business as well as the land. “One
young man was advised to sell his dental
practice if he wanted consent. This also
occurred recently when a Sydney
businessman applied for a southern un-
improved property of 250 acres. He was
told that he had to ‘forsake his
business’ and live on it, which he
naturally refused to do, because he
could not improve it without the aid of
surplus profits from his business. It
looks like remaining unimproved for a
long time and a loss to the economy.”

Some Problems in Expansion
Australian Fertilizers taking the strain
The Bulletin’s prediction of low earn-
ings for Australian Fertilizers over
the next three years (August 29, 1964,
p. 66), to be caused mainly by the gener-
ous three-for-five issue made to finance
expansion which will not have any great
effect on profits for some time, may
come home with a thump in the current
year. The directors have reported that,
despite a substantial sales rise in the
December six months, profits did not
rise correspondingly. Whether this
means they fell, stayed steady or only
rose slightly is anybody's guess.
Apparently the main problem was a
three-week strike at the Port Kembla
works. Production schedules (already
unable to keep up with demand) were
disrupted and profits affected. In order
to keep faith with landowners, 70,000
tons of Victorian-manufactured ICIANZ
superphosphate was purchased for ship-
ment to areas north of Wagga. The
price was favorable, but freight and
handling charges set the company back
about £2 every ton.
Last year's consolidated earning rate
of 17.5 p.c. is going to take quite a
knock unless there is some improvement
in these final months. The issue in-
creased capital by 60 p.c., although it
will only rank for about seven months
of the year. Any drop will not go so
low as to threaten the 8 p.c. dividend,
yet the danger will be there in the fol-
lowing year, depending- to a large extent
on whether expansion has started to be
profitable and the cost of any further
money raised or borrowed —£3.2 million
is to be raised in all for expansion and
the issue accounted for only half of this.
Then there is the question of tax. Last
year's consolidated profit lift from
£258,000 to £353,000 was aided by in-
vestment allowances, which kept the tax
lift small, from £284,000 to £295,000,
despite the increase in company rates.
It is to be hoped that investment allow-
ances will be available in the same mag-
nitude this year or tax could take its
toll. No doubt general costs have risen
this year, too, seeing production facilities
are still under a considerable strain and
the wage bill has risen.
Some observers hold the opinion that
the interim report glossed over the pro-
fit problem. Assuming the return in the
December half of 196T64 was £176,000-
odd (half of the £353,000 total which,
because of seasonal factors, is not neces-
sarily very accurate), profits in the latest
half of the current year must have taken
quite a wallop. If £2 freight and hand-
ling was incurred on each of the 70,000

tons from ICIANZ, expenses would
have jumped by around £140,000. Of
course there are a thousand loopholes in
this approach, but it does provide evi-
dence for the argument that profits may
actually have dropped in the half-year.
This is a point which directors should
feel obliged to clear up. Obviously
they don't.
All in all, 1964-65 and 1965-66 could
prove to be very tricky years, especially
as far as share prices are concerned.
Fortunately, the long-run provides a
bright star for the company, once ex-
pansion is complete and profitable, and
capital can be handsomely serviced.
Textile Recovery?
"Following a strong profit recovery
last financial year, which enabled it
to cover its dividend for the first time
in three years, Bradford Cotton, leader
in the cotton textile field, has further
recuperated with a “very substantial’’ in-
crease in profit for the six months to
December 31.
With the profit increase comes the
re-establishment of the 5 p.c. interim
dividend. It was lowered last year to
4 p.c. to preserve the company’s liqui-
dity (a final 6 p.c. continued the suc-
cession of 10 p.c. total payouts), so the
return to the higher rate must be heart-
ening to those investors who have kept
faith with the textile industry through
its recent troubled times. The market
didn’t seem particularly overjoyed with
Bradford's interim report, marking the
ss. shares up only Id. to 7s. Bd. on the
news, but at least there is evidence that
textiles are once again coming into favor.
The six month profit (subject to audit)
was £379,000 after providing £250,000
foi tax. Last full year's profit rose
£143.844 to £542,623 after tax of
£300,476. This equalled 12.9 p.c. earn-
ing rate, still not very much above the
threatened 10 p.c. dividend rate. Latest
results indicate a 17.3 p.c. earning
rate if profits can be maintained for the
current six months.
A final satisfying note in the interim
was the directors’ statement that orders
on hand are substantial and that busi-
ness continues to be maintained at a
satisfactory tempo.

tition”, a feature which will no doubt
increase with new models. Investors
can have only as much faith in the deal-
ers as the dealers have in themselves.
A recent addition to the unhappy list
is Hunt Bros (Holdings) Ltd, a Ford
dealer. Its earnings crashed 52.3 p.c. in
the six months to December compared
with the previous corresponding period.
The fall followed a 4.6 p.c. drop in
motor vehicle sales. This gives further
weight to the theory that margins are
being slashed to maintain turnover (and
keep dealerships and distributorships?).
As a result of the profit drop interim
dividend has been reduced from 4 to 3
p.c. Directors say in the report they
hope the advent of new models (first to
be released is the Falcon range, due in
March-April) will strengthen the com-
pany’s competitive position and enable
profits to improve during the rest of the
current financial year.
The release of new models, now be-
coming an annual event with motor
vehicle manufacturers in Australia, is a
feature of the industry that not many
dealers and distributors have taken into
account. Until they become accustomed
to this high-pressure psychology, there is
no indication that there will be a radical
improvement in results.

moment for about 2s. lid.
Healthy Fledgling
Mewcomer to the Melbourne list, local

The ss. shares issued to the public a

possibly kick on after last week's intima-
tion that pre-tax profits rose by 13.4 p.c.
and sales by 11.8 p.c. in the half-year
to December last.
The prospectus of this 36-year-old
market fledgling from Springvale—with
established Matraville (NSW) connec-
tions —envisaged an 8 p.c. dividend rate
to be covered more than twice by earn-
ings. This could easily be achieved for
its first year’s round as a public com-
pany. Shareholders will not get an in-
terim dividend this year but the board
is to give consideration to their payment
in future years.

MOUNT ISA MINES LIMITED
Report to the Stockholders
In view of the most recent developments in the industrial
dispute which has closed down the mine, I feel it is essential
that you, as a shareholder, should be acquainted with all the
facts leading up to the situation as it stands at present.
As your Chairman, at the very outset I would like to convey the
Board’s appreciation of the warm-hearted and spontaneous support
of so many shareholders who have expressed their confidence in it
during this trying period.
It is a source of great personal regret that I am unable to report
a return to normal operations at Mount Isa, although no effort
has been spared by your Board to achieve this end.
I am sure you have followed the progress of the dispute through
the normal channels of Press, radio and television, and will have
read the Company's “Report to the People" and “Appeal to
Reason” published throughout Australia.
Although the various developments in the dispute are set out
in detail below, 1 feel it is necessary to comment on some pertinent
facts.
Conditions of employment at Mount Isa equal any in Australia.
Wages have been more than comparable with any other similar
industry in the Commonwealth and the amenities provided,-not
only for employees but for all townspeople, have made a major
contribution to the high standard of living enjoyed by residents.
The employees’ share in the Company’s prosperity is revealed
by the fact that during the past five years they have received
bonuses of £8 per week, totalling £416 per year each above
scheduled wage rates. With the decision of the Queensland
Industrial Commission on the 24th December, 1964 to add a
prosperity loading of £3 per week, the employees’ share was
increased to £ll per week, making a total of £572 per year over
and above normal wages.
Minimum male adult earnings at Mount Isa are now £29/14/4
per forty-hour week. The contract miners’ average earnings were
more than £5O per forty-hour week, while some earned over £6O
per week.
The Company’s total commitment for bonus and prosperity
loading of £2.3 million per year approximates the dividend paid
annually to stockholders over the past four years.
Despite high wages, participation in Company earnings, generous
superannuation and other benefits and provision of community
services and amenities,- we were presented with demands which
no responsible Board of Directors could accept.
Our refusal was used by a small but highly organised and
fanatical group to bring about a state of fear and chaos in
Mount Isa. Conference after conference, presided over by
Industrial Commissioner, Mr H. J. Harvey, was held. The
Commissioner's recommendation, subsequently repeated on a number
of occasions—and supported by the Queensland Branch Secretary
of the Australian Workers’ Union —that the men should return
to work was rejected.
Orders by the Queensland Industrial Commission restraining
the Union and miners from being a party to a ban on contract
work, and by the Government to accept contract work, were defied.
The real tragedy of the dispute is that the great majority
of our employees are decent, law-abiding and efficient workmen,
many with wives and young families, who have staked their
all in Mount Isa.
Equally tragic is the fact that many newcomers, who migrated
to Australia and who have made their homes in Mount Isa,
have been led to doubt the wisdom of having done so.
Earnings of the Company have been adversely affected by the
strike, but it is not yet possible to assess fully to what extent.
Your Company has always abided by and upheld the principle
of lawful arbitration and has always been prepared to discuss
matters of common interest with accredited Union representatives.
This it will continue to do. Your Directors have been and will
be unsparing in their efforts to achieve a return to normal
operations through this principle, on which not only the future
of our Company depends but which also vitally' affects the
stability of the Australian economy.
It is still our sincere hope that reason will prevail and an
early return to normal production will be brought about as soon
as possible. In the event of any further developments of a major
nature your Board will advise you.
Brisbane.
12th February, 1965.
G. R. FISHER,
Chairman.
HISTORY OF THE DISPUTE
On 24th August, 1964. members of the Australian Workers’ Union
employed at Mount Isa refused to work under the contract system
then in operation, as a protest against the Queensland Industrial
Commission's refusal to grant a wage increase of £4 per week.
On 7th September the Industrial Commission in Brisbane was ad-
vised of the dispute and a compulsory conference of the parties
requested.
On Bth September a compulsory conference was held before Mr.
Commissioner Bennett. On 10th September no settlement was reached
but it was agreed that the parties would confer on the facts in issue
sufficient to enable the Industrial Court to decide whether the action
of the men at Mount Isa in refusing contract work constituted a
strike. ‘
On 15th September the Branch Secretary of the A.W.U. failed to
obtain agreement from his members at Mount Isa on any facts to
be placed before the Industrial Court for determination.
The President of the Industrial Court in Chambers decided on
30th September that the action of the men at Mount Isa constituted
an unauthorised strike.
.On 4th October a mass meeting of A.W.U. members at Mount Isa
voted to continue the contract ban for a further week.
On 11th October a mass meeting of A.W.U. members at. Mount Isa
rejected a recommendation from their Executive that they revert to
contract work.
On 23rd October Mr. P. Mackie was dismissed by the Company for
unlawful absence from his work. On the books of the Company and
the A.W.U. Mr. Mackie was recorded as Eugene Markey.
On 25th October a mass meeting of A.W.U. members at Mount Isa
voted against a return to contract work, and passed a vote of no
confidence in their State Executive.
On 3rd December a complaint lodged by Mr. Mackie against the
Company for wrongful dismissal was dismissed by the local Industrial
Magistrate at Mount Isa.
On 3rd December the Commission issued Restraining Orders against
the A.W.U., its officials and members at Mount Isa from taking part
in an unauthorised strike.
On 6th December a mass meeting of A.W.U. members at Mount
Isa overruled local A.W.U. officials. Thereupon Mr. Mackie chaired
an unconstitutional meeting at which it was decided to ignore the
restraining order of the Industrial Commission and to continue the
contract ban.
On Bth December the A.W.U. announced that Mr. Mackie had been
expelled from the Union by its Northern District Committee.
On 9th December the Company announced the cessation of under-
ground copper mining as from midnight 11th December.
On 10th December by Order-in-Council the Government declared a
State of Emergency to exist under the Transport Acts—effective from
14th December—and ordered underground workers to accept contract
work.
On 13th December a mass meeting of A.W.U. members at Mount
Isa voted to defy the Government’s Declaration of Emergency.
On 14th December the Government issued a further Order-in-Council
permitting the Company to suspend or dismiss employees at Mount
Isa who refused to accept contract work.
On 15th December underground contract workers were dismissed
because of their refusal on night shift and day shift to accept con-
tract work. At 4 p.m. on that day, the Company ceased operations
but outside contract work continued.
Also on 15th December the Industrial Court upheld an appeal by
the A.W.U. against the Industrial Commission's reasons for refusing
the claim by the Union for a wage increase of £4 per week.
On 18th December Mr Commissioner Harvey, representatives of
the Company and of the A.W.U. conferred pursuant to the first
Order-in-Council.
On 19th December the same parties, plus representatives of other
unions with members at Mount Isa, conferred.
On 24th December the Commission announced that it had decided
to award a prosperity loading of £3 per week.
Mass meetings at Mount Isa refused to return to work until
other demands of the men were met—including the reinstatement
of Mr. Mackie, the recognition of the Mount Isa Trades and
Labour Council as the negotiating body, and amendments to the
contract system operating at Mount Isa.
From 6th January to 15th January, 1965, Mr. Commissioner
Harvey chaired a compulsory conference at which amendments
to the contract system operating at Mount Isa were agreed upon.
On 15th January the Company confirmed that it would not
reinstate Mr. Mackie and it would not recognise the Mount Isa
Trades and Labour Council as the future negotiating body for
employees at Mount Isa. It was also announced that Mr. Com-
missioner Harvey would address a mass meeting of employees at
Mount Isa and recommend a return to work. The Queensland Branch
Secretary of the A.W.U. expressed his support of this recommendation.
On 16th January A.W.U. officials were howled down at a mass
meeting of A.W.U. members at Mount Isa. Mr. Commissioner Harvey,
who had been invited to address the meeting, left the meeting
without speaking.
On 17th January a further meeting at Mount Isa, at which
members of the public were present, voted against any return to
work.
On 19th January the Premier of the State issued a final warning
and appealed for a return to work without any need for further-
drastic action by the Government.
There still being no return to work on 27th January, another
Order-in-Council under the Proclamation of Emergency was made
giving wide powers to police to prevent any intimidation, picketing
and subversion.
On 28th January the Company announced that the mine would
reopen on Ist February if sufficient employees reported for work. An
insufficient number of men presented themselves for work on Ist Feb-
ruary to permit a resumption of operations.
On Ist February the Government announced that it had decided to
suspend the operation of its most recent Order-in-Council and that
Mr. Commissioner Harvey would proceed to Mount Isa to reconvene
the compulsory conference.
The Company, at the request of the Government, deferred its plan
announced earlier to suspend all outside contract work at Mount Isa.
On 2nd February the A.W.U. Convention in Sydney announced that
Mr. Mackie’s appeal against his expulsion from the Union had been
rejected.
On 3rd February Mr. Commissioner Harvey resumed the compulsory
conference in Mount Isa. The conference continued on the 4th and
sth February. Agreement was reached in respect of the Company's
recognition of Union delegates.
On 7th February A.W.U. members and members of other unions
held separate meetings. The A.W.U. meeting voted against a return
to work, and their action was supported by other unions.
On Bth February Mr. Commissioner Harvey adjourned the compul-
sory conference sine die.
On 9th February the Company announced its decision to suspend
all outside contract work at Mount Isa from 11th February.
On 11th February the Industrial Commission issued on Order re-
straining the Company from suspending outside contracts for one
week.

and announces the conclusion ot a mil-
lion pound deal with such an eminent
giant as ICIANZ.
The 11 p.c. loan of £l.B million from
Commercial and General Acceptance
will be paid off by March 25, when it
will have been in force for exactly a
year. Factors is now virtually in the
clear as far as debts are concerned and
there is more than a good chance of a
return to dividends in 1965-66.
Of course the profit capacity of the
Holeproof NZ company will be cut back
considerably in the short run because of
the selling off of its subsidiaries. This
column has expressed before today the
danger involved in selling profit sources
while interest was still owing to CAGA
and the cash flow for meeting it and
the principal was constantly being re-
duced.
With one swipe and the sale of Colo-
nial Ammunition, the debt has been
eliminated now, however, and the danger
no longer exists. Holeproof is left with
only its clothing and textile subsidiaries.
Although the annual profit will be no-
thing like it once was, expansion plans
will help to boost it to some extent.
Perhaps Mr Korman could give share-
holders another pleasant shock by let-
ing them know what sort of profits the
company is earning. The figure cannot
even be guessed, as it is not known what
contribution the ex-subsidiaries were
making.
Dunlop’s Record
"TVESPiTE.a cut in the interim dividend
Dunlop shares rose 6d. to 425. on
the news that profit had increased 9 p.c.
in the December half year to a record
£1,380,879. Increase in earnings, how-
ever, did not keep pace with turnover
which rose 15 p.c.
Half yearly dividend was cut from
4} p.c. to 4 p.c., in line w'ith the direc-
tors’ forecast of 8 p.c. for 1964-65. The
lower dividend was foreshadowed when
a one-for-three issue (which raised capi-
tal nearly £5 million to £19.5 million)
was announced during the period.
Dunlop’s result, which is subject to
audit, remained after raising tax from
£919,677 to £1,068.780 and depreciation
from £676,870 to £781,420.

11/hile Rothmans moves in to the mer-
" chant banking field along with
giants like ACI and CRA, Philip Morris
continues to boast the roaring success of
its Philip Morris, Marlboro and Alpine
brands both at home and on the export
market. Adding to its spectacular run
of profit increases over recent years,
the company has reported a 32 p.c.
jump in earnings for the December
half-year from £262,000 to £343,000.
Earning rate on an annual basis rose
from 30.8 p.c. to 40.3 p.c. Last year’s
full profit w'as £529,000, w'hich equalled
31.1 p.c. on the paid capital. Back in
1960-61 the profit was a mere £184,000.
The interim dividend has been lifted
from 5 p.c. to 54 p.c., indicating an
annual rate of 11 p.c. This will be the
fourth dividend lift in succession. Last
year the payout was 10 p.c. and 9 p.c.
in the year before that.
An issue to shareholders cannot be
very far off if earnings come out at
around 40 p.c. for the full year and
dividends remain as low as they are in
relation to these earnings. Providing, of
course, that no inconsiderate gentleman
comes along to worry us with new evi-
dence on the link with lung cancer.

Conservative Building Contractor
Tn the narrow profits margin context of the construction indus-
tries, which has dampened enthusiasm for equities in it
over the last year, the performance of Melbourne-based John
Holland (Holdings) Ltd has been fairly good but certainly not
exciting.
This fifteen-year-old concern, listed in Melbourne in 1963
after a small placement, came up with a bare 7.4 p.c. (to
£117,404) rise in profits in the year to June 30 last. It has
now reported a further advance for the subsequent half,
coupled with the maintenance of its initial 10 p.c. annual
dividend rate and a full programme of work. (We were
recently impressed by an inspection of one of its local pro-
jects at Westernport, where it is making rapid progress with
the new jetty to serve BP’s new refinery going on stream
early next year.)
With its contracts on a far-flung basis, from New Guinea
to nearly all States, Holland is full of enterprise. But, as
the chairman, Mr C. V. Holland, told The Bulletin some
time ago, it is deliberately conservative in eschewing to put
the equity on the thin end of a wedge of prior charges and
aims at high liquidity and internal financing of its activities.
There’s little doubt that the build-up of its already con-
siderable contracting operations is restricted by this studied
conservatism. In Mr Holland’s words last week, the volume
of work available for tender is greater than for some time.
Holland’s recent pickings from this include the Port Moresby
hydro-electric and Collinsville power stations.
With Holland’s ss. shares standing at Bs. Bd. the market
presently rates them on the same yield basis of 5.8 p.c. as
McDonald Industries (in the same general field, but whose
specialisation is somewhat different), which had a whopping
loss last year. As Holland offers an earning yield of 10.3 p.c.
at the current price, there seems to be a case for adjustment
in the market’s estimate of the relative merits.
South Australian Debt Purchase
T eading hire purchase company, Commercial and General
Acceptance, has purchased Australian Equity Corpora-
tion's South Australian outstandings for £l.l million. Pay-
ment equals total debts outstanding less income to mature.
Australian Equity’s directors said the sale was made “for
the purposes of economy” and to further consolidate the
company's activities in the eastern States. This is the second
time AEC has sold part of its outstandings. In 1963 it sold
its Western Australian outstandings of about £i million to
Ready Credits.
AEC outstandings at last balance date amounted to £19.4
million compared with £19.2 million a year earlier. CAGA,
40 p.c. owned by the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney,
owns 48.2 p.c. of AEC’s shares. CAGA's ss. shares rose 6d.
to 10s. 6d. on announcement of the purchase, while AEC’s ss.
shares remained steady at.7s. 6d.
Fleecy-Lined Young
Perhaps it doesn't matter all that much which of Aus-
tralian United Corporation’s many companies, ranging
over money and investment markets, brings home the bacon,
or even which have to spit out their young. Equally, of course,
whether they do worse or better, the subsidiaries can be milked
for the benefit of the group's overall result when the occasion
demands.
The results now available from one of the subsidiaries,
Australian United Underwriting Pty Ltd, throw some light
on the group’s profit mechanics. It will be recalled that
UAC’s group profit dropped from £564,539 to £406,734 in
the year to last June. Now it transpires that, although Aus-
tralian United Underwriting's profit fell from £131,963 to
£115,558 in the same period, its dividend was increased from
£45,000 to £82,000. For those who like hefty earnings
percentages, this was 594 p.c. on the £15,250 unchanged
capital of this subsidiary.
As for spitting out one’s young, it will also be recalled that
Sir lan Potter told us last year that the group’s investment in
the ill-fated Australian Factors, for which it paid £324,000,
was ultimately written off at a cost of only £199,500 after
deduction of tax allowances. We now learn that Australian
United Underwriting had to lump £92,000 of this amount.
Lend Lease’s London Money
T end Lease Corporation Ltd is to finance the balance of
its Australia Square project with an £8 million debenture
issue in London. The money, at an interest rate of 7£ p.c.
and maturing in 2003, will be used to build the 43-storey
circular tower office building and provide facilities at the
project.
Holders of the debenture stock, which is to be issued at
par, will have the right to participate in one-third of the
equity of the project. The UK Government has consented
to the issue and arrangements are now subject to Australian
Foreign Exchange Control.
Chairman of Lend Lease. Mr G. J. Dusseldorp, announcing _
the debenture issue, said diversion of the Tank Stream and
sewers had been completed. Excavations of the site on which
the tower will stand are in progress. The entire project is
expected to be completed in 1968.

Overcoming the Frustration
Attractions of a good-calibre stock
'II/’hat a frustrating week it has been on
" the Exchange. A great many com-
panies have produced interim reports,
yet these have brought little response to
their share prices. In the sudden wild
plea for income we’ve seen such out-
standing stocks as James Hardie knocked
down 20s. It’s a feather in the cap for
some chartists, who have been predicting
the fall for a couple of weeks.
I’ll go along part but not all the way
in the case of Hardie. The fall has been
so steep that there must be a reaction
of some sort from 107 s. 6d. Going be-
yond this technical approach, it seems
incredible that a stock of this calibre is
relatively so low. Earnings per share
have been compounding at the rate of
20 p.c. per annum for several years now,
which proves beyond doubt that the
company can be classified as a growth
stock. A purchase of 50 shares was
made at 107 s. 6d.
One of the few shares that have held
firm over the last few days is Mount
Isa. From far and wide, apparently, has
come a mass of small buying orders.
Yet it is difficult to imagine a picture
more black.
Behind the Mount Isa tragedy stands
proud Mackie. Lately he has been do-
ing the rounds collecting money for the
miners. As he can rightly claim to be
the reason for the extreme turnover of
Mount Isa shares in the last few weeks
(over a million shares), he could well
start demanding that brokers share their
commission spoils with him.
In the States that fabulous land
where the stock market has risen 50 p.c.
in the last two years—some of the larger
investors work on the odd lot theory.
A parcel of shares on the New York
Exchange generally runs into several
hundred dollars, so the small investor is
really forced to deal in odd lots. Details
of these odd-lot transactions are pub-
lished regularly. My own chartist studies
these transactions. If he finds there has
been heavy buying, then he considers it a
good selling proposition. Heavy selling,
on the other hand, indicates that the
stock is good buying.
The type of buying in Mount Isa
closely approximates the American odd-
lot transactions. Irrespective of whether
the dispute is settled tomorrow or in
three months’ time, a short position
seems to be the right one. To prove
the point, I shorted another 100 shares.
The next transaction for the week in-
volved the textile company S.T.P. Hold-
ings Ltd. Textile shares generally have
been behaving very well in the market.
S.T.P. is no exception. The last few
years have seen a good recovery in
profits, with earning rate reaching a peak
of 26 p.c. in 1964. National production
statistics of rayon and other synthetic
fibres suggest, however, that the current
earning rate will be higher again. Since
1960, directors have concentrated on ex-
pansion by vertical integration, so that
the company now undertakes both the
production and merchandising of the
textiles. Adding a little more color to
the shares is the -42? p.c. share interest
held by James Nelson (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.,
a subsidiary of Courtaulds U.K. I picked
up 400 shares at Bs. 6d.
Selling this week was a case of be-
coming more liquid. The small profit
on the sale of 1000 Westralian just about
cancelled out the small loss on Conquip.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
100 Mount Isa, 34/6 £l7O
1000 Westralian Oil, 3/3 £154
500 Conquip, 9/6 £232
BOUGHT

SECURITY ANAIYSIS
Hard Look at Mount Isa
Do current prices give any advantage?
_ A security analyst, fortunately, does
not have to judge the merits of
each side’s case in the Mount Isa dis-
pute, but he does have to make
some decision on the likely effect that
such disputes will have on the investment
merits of Mount Isa Mines Ltd shares.
It seems fairly clear that this year’s
profit will be well down. It has been
suggested that the dividend rate of six-
pence per share may even be in danger.
Labor unrest is fairly common with
mining companies and this is not the
first occasion there has been a strike at
Mount Isa. We must assume, then,
that those who have purchased the com-
pany’s shares over the last six months
have known quite well that profits could
be affected by a strike at any time.
They rightly decided that short-term
problems should not cloud the issue.
Nevertheless, they must be a little dis-
concerted to find the share price down
to 345. or less and to notice that fair
quantities of put options are being writ-
ten, even at this depressed price, to sell
in six months’ time.
This seems to be the appropriate time
to have another look at the company
to see if advantage should be taken of
the current price, which is now more
than 25 p.c. lower than the 1964 peak.
On the question of the price, it is im-
portant to have comparable figures. A
five-year record of actual prices would
be as follows:
Calendar year 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Hiqh 87/6 75/ 76 6 38 '9 48/9
Low 54/6 56/6 53/- 34/- 35/-
The high 1964 price of 48s. 9d. looks
cheap in relation to past years. This is
clearly not the position if the prices are
adjusted for the bomis issues that have
been made during this period:
Calendar year 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
High 26/3 30/- 30'8 38/9 48 9
Low 21/10 22/8 23/3 34/- 35/-
It is very difficult to place a value on
a mine at the best of times but, in the
case of Mount Isa, it is also necessary
to place a value on a substantial indus-
trial undertaking. So far as ore reserves
are concerned, the value (at average
1963-64 prices) of the metal in the
ground would seem to represent about
£6 10s. per share. There are three
factors which need to be considered in
this context:
(i) The reserves increase year by year
and it seems certain that considerable
quantities of ore are still to be dis-
covered.
(ii) Ore in the ground has no value.
It has to be extracted and treated before
it takes on value, so the expenses in-
curred are important.
(iii) Prices for the product are gener-
ally fixed on a global basis. While pro-
ducers frequently make their own price,
it is subjected to supply and demand
pressures.
The actual increase in copper reserves
alone has been at the rate of 124 p.c.
per annum over the last six years. There
seems no doubt that the company will
be able to extract ore at the rate of
16,000 tons a day for many years before
the deposits are exhausted.
The company gives a most detailed
report. Its figures for sales and expenses
over the last five years have been:
Fiscal year 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Sales £ mill. A 22.9 24.5 19.3 25.9 29.3
Cost of sales B 12.5 12.4 11.3 13,7 16.2
B p.c. A 54.6 50.6 58.6 52.9 55.3
These figures are not very helpful in
recognising any trend. As it is clear that
the operation at Mount Isa is by far the
most important and as we have a little
more detail, the following table is pro-
duced showing the major expenses and
the profit as a percentage of metal sales
for the last four years:
Fiscal year 1961 1962 1963 1964
Sales 100 100 100 100
Wages 28 32 29 29
Other expenses 24 27 25 26
Depreciation 7 10 9 10
Tax provided 13 8 11 11
Net profit 26 27 23 20 '
The figures for 1962 must be re-
garded as. those of an abnormal year
because of the effect of the eight-week
strike that occurred in the first half of
that year. Unfortunately, it has rather
special significance at the present time.
It is apparent that all expenses are in-
creasing as a percentage of sales and, in
general terms, profit as a percentage
of sales is tending to decline.
The average prices that Mount Isa
has been obtaining for its metals have
tended to move in different directions.
However, copper is by far the most im-
portant and over the last four years
it has moved up continuously. The
movements are best seen with indices:
Fiscal year 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1954
Silver 96 99 100 104 127 140
Lead 107 109 100 92 84 113
Zinc 82 103 100 88 86 102
Copper 102 106 100 102 103 106
Sales value
of group 69 94 100 79 106 120
All prices are above their 1961 level.
Perhaps, with the exception of silver, the
increase has not been very great and it
can be seen that it was not these price
increases that have had the most signi-
ficant effect on sales and profits. The
factor has been increased capacity and
this can be seen by comparing sales and
org treated:
Fiscal year 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Sales 69 94 100 79 106 120
Ore treated 79 93 100 85 115 127
The correlation here is quite good (as
would be expected), but sales have not
been increasing at the same rate as ore

While the facts are only very rough
and while greater dissection of the
figures may be desirable, we are in a
position to make a guess at the profit in
the year when the expansion programme
is completed and ore treated in the year
has increased to 5,750,000 tons. We
must make the assumption that all the
metal produced from this ore can be
readily sold and we will assume that
prices will be at 1961 levels. This
would suggest that group sales would be
approaching the fifty million mark. If
the trend in profitability continues, the
net profit before depreciation and tax
may only reach £17.6 million as against
the latest figure of £12.1 million and
the 1961 figure of £11.4 million.
Having made predictions this far, it
is now necessary to guess what rates of
depreciation will be regarded as neces-
sary if the development is complete and
what rate of tax will apply. We will
assume that depreciation will not in-
crease above £3 million and that current
rates of tax will still apply. This would
make earnings about £8.4 million or
Is. 9d. per share.
If this figure is anywhere near the
correct figure for 1967-68, say, the earn-
ings yield would only be 4f p.c. from
the current price of 375. The earnings
yield from 1963-64 earnings is only 3i
p.c.!
The net asset backing per share is
10s. 9d. If we add on the profit con-
tent of the ore in the ground, about 265.,
the price would be 365. 9d. This ignores
the fact that, even if the workers go
back to work and production is raised
immediately to 16,000 tons a day, it will
take eleven years to extract it.
Probably the price was pushed to pre-
sent levels and above because some in-
vestors are expecting the dividend rate
to return to 25 p.c. (Is. 3d. per share)
when the present expansion programme
is completed. This would make the
dividend yield from the present price of
345. Bd. about 3.5 p.c., but it seems
that this event will now be delayed until
early 1967 at the earliest.
It seems to me that those who are not
emotional about their investments would
find it difficult to invest in Mount Isa
shares even at current prices.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
The Grip of Bureaucracy
“Vigilante” committees on the way?
YlThile there is supposed to be an un-
" easy truce on wool marketing dis-
cussion in existence (there isn't, of
course), something which may be termed
undercover espionage is going on in
Canberra. This is the compiling of a
report on the whole business by “senior
officials of the Departments of Trade,
Primary Industry, the Treasury and the
Prime Minister's Department”.
Other than that, there is little the
woolgrower or the general taxpayer can
expect to know about it. This is how
“rubber stamp” government works.
Probably there are less than a dozen
politicians who have kept up with the
wool marketing issue, which has dragged
on lor nearly a year now. The rest,
understandably, have listened to a lot
of talk and have tried to read up on it.
When it comes to making a decision
they aren’t sure. So they ask a com-
mittee of “experts” to decide for them.
It’s not a new story. For all this
writer knows the report may have been
completed and may be in the hands of
the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr
Adermann. It may have been circulated
to other members—certainly senior
ones.
Knowing how public servants can spin
a day’s work out, though, the chances
are the compiling is still going on. Just
for once it would be interesting to know
who these people are, what their quali-
fications are, and why they are supposed
to be judges of what is good for the
country.
A change in wool marketing will
affect all of us, but this particular issue
goes further than wool marketing. If
politicians cannot make up their own
minds, then they shouldn't be politicians.
Why are these Commonwealth Public
Services regarded as the final arbiters on
so many vital issues?
How long is it since any politician,
individually, or any government, collec-
tively, had the courage to question
the growth of Canberra bureaucracy?
The leaders of the present Government
said plenty about it back in 1949, but
that was just an election promise.
As Malcolm Muggeridge has so aptly
said: only madmen like Hitler do what
they promise. It is a pity, though, that
politicians do not try a little harder—
one of the reasons we have them is that
they are supposed to safeguard indivi-
dual liberties.
Generally speaking, however, their
behavior is what people deserve. As
long as everyone gets three square meals
a day, has a nice, comfortable job, and
can pay off a car and a TV set, what’s
it matter?
But there are some indications that a
change in attitudes may be on the way,
at least on the part of the farming
section. At least one farmer organisation
is talking quite seriously about setting
up “vigilante” committees to check on
the bureaucrats.
Farmers, in any district in Australia,
have to deal with a maze of government,
semi-government, and public depart-
ments. There are boards, under various
degrees of governmental (i.e., depart-
mental) control, for all kinds of things.
Wool, the. biggest primary industry of
all, is only partly involved at this stage.
Wheat, tobacco, meat, cotton, barley,
oats, milk, butter, cheese, onions, pota-
toes, and many other forms of produce,
are involved in various ways.
Wheat, for instance, is, strictly speak-
ing, under the control of the Wheat
Board, which is a grower institution run
by growers. Clearly the Commonwealth
Government, through the Departments
of Primary Industry and Trade, can
wield a powerful influence over the
Wheat Board.
What has caused growers to buck
hard in recent weeks is the suggestion,
apparently given a degree of depart-
mental blessing, that acreages be re-
stricted. Some of the alleged experts,
who apparently are given a good hearing
in departmental circles on this subject,
may have a pretty sketchy knowledge
of the wheat industry and its history.
That’s what growers are saying. They
may, or may not, be right. Yet they are
saying it.
Beyond these boards of various kinds
are many others, some under State juris-
diction, which carry out duties connected
with pastures, weeds, vermin, rabbits
and so on. Then there are the roads,
rivers and transport authorities which
tell the farmer what he can do and
when he can do it. Then there are all
the country municipalities and shires
which levy rates.
It adds up to as complex a maze of
bureaucracy as you could get—a verit-
able Parkinson’s delight. Some of these
authorities are highly efficient; some are
incredibly moribund.
The worst, used purely as an example,
is the Board of Lands and Works in
Victoria which, officially, is defunct.
Although it has not. been in existence for
years, there are still farmers who state
that this board owes them compensa-
tion for lands resumed thirty years ago.
Naturally they are having a difficult
time pressing their point because, offici-
ally, there’s no board to appeal to.
This particular issue is a good story in
its own right and is often referred to as
the “Widow Mudge Case”. Mrs Mudge,
the widow, sued and won but died be-
fore the payment was made. Her sup-
porters, who went along believing that
hers was a test case, are still waiting. A
disgraceful example of bureaucracy gone

mad and a blot on at least three Vic-
torian State Governments.
What hurts is that all these many and
varied authorities cost money to main-
tain. They grow and grow. They over-
lap and duplicate each other.
Even research, which to criticise is to
invite brickbats, is no exception. It
provides jobs for university graduates
and others, and therefore is supposed
to be above criticism, but it can be a
form of bureaucracy also. It cannot
pay for itself. Somewhere along the
line the taxpayer must dip into his
pocket.
The bureaucratic muddle goes far be-
yond farming. What is interesting is that
this latest move to form “vigilante com-
mittees” (or whatever name they are
finally given) comes from a particular
organisation which, in the past, has been
a strong advocate of Government con-
trols. It has even put more than one
man (quite famous, too) into Parlia-
ment.
Let no one imagine that this is some
kind of Goldwaterism raising its head
in The great majority of
farmers —despite pride in their ability to
stand on their own two legs—want the
degree of protection which all these
authorities are supposed to bestow. What
they also want to see is greater efficiency,
and less duplication and waste.
Let no one imagine either that their
intentions are altogether in the interests
of the public at large. Self-interest
enters into this.
Most of these authorities came into
existence from about 1910 on. There
are sthl niany farm leaders with memor-
i es of the early days. The directors,
chairmen and administrators who got the
jobs were men they could talk to. Often
they were farmers themselves, or men
close to farming, or fellows who had
had a shot at standing for parliament.
Now' the grey-flannel suit type is get-
f‘ n g the jobs, young men with either
university or business administration
background. The young men want to
things differently.
Their courses did not inform them of
some of the facts of life. For example:
you never build a road, or run water, or
bring in a levy, or make a resumption,
or anything else, where it will do the
most good. You do it where it will
do the most good for the boys. That’s
something you learn in the university of
life. While some of the old-time ad-
ministrators couldn’t spell too well, they
were brilliant graduates of that particular
university.
So those very rare Australians who
deplore all forms of bureaucracy should
not get their hopes up too much. As
for the earnest young men, this thought
occurs: If they are not mad now (like
Hitler) they may very well be driven that
way before they collect their superannu-
ation.
Wool Boards for S. America
Virtues of electoral college system
The news from the Intern ational Wool
Ac . • . . 0 .
Secretariat is that the South Ame-
. „
rlcan countnes ot Ch,le - Peru " Brazil,
Uruguay and Argentina are considering
setting up Wool Boards like those in
Australia, South Africa and New Zea-
land”. Generally speaking this is good
and the IWS was wise to send a delega-
tion to South America to explain the
benefits of South American participation
in the IWS.
But the South Americans, if they have
any brains at all, will set up Wool
Boards like those in South Africa and
New Zealand and not like the one in
Australia. What's the difference?
It is so basic, and so vitally import-
ant, that most people (including not a
few woolgrowers) choose to ignore the
difference altogether. Yet in this writer’s
view it is one of the prime reasons for
the divisions within the Australian in-
dustry, which may get worse, and not
better, if this basic shortcoming in the
Australian Wool Board is not rectified.
The shortcoming is that the Australian
Wool Board represents, at best, about
60 p.c. of Australian woolgrowers. The
Wool Board is appointed by the Austra-
lian Wool Industry Conference, which is
made up of 25 delegates from each of
the two major producer organisations—
the Australian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation (“the Federation”) and the
Woolgrowers’ and Graziers’ Council
(“the Graziers").
If this is democracy, it is the kind of
democracy which would find favor in
the eyes of Jorno Kenyatta and Dr
Nkrumah. On the other hand, the Wool
Boards of South Africa and New Zea-
land are based on the electoral college
system —the only democratic way.
On the “Federation” half of the
tralian Wool Industry Conference there
are a few voices which, over the years,
have urged that the present system be
dropp’ed and an electoral college system
introduced. These voices are now
silenced because of an agreement (un-
written) to “take it easy” until the mar-
keting and promotion issues are settled.
Outside the Australian Wool Industry
Conference there are really strong

Here is an exciting addition to the fine range of distinctive Orlando table wines.
It’s a light, refreshing Hock with an engaging piquancy, fruity bouquet and crisp,

It is vintaged from grapes of the Hunter River Riesling, Tokay and Rhine
Riesling varieties, grown at Orlando’s famous Miamba vineyard in South Aus-
tralia’s fertile Lyndoch Valley.
Miamba Hock is produced under the same controlled fermentation process that
it used to make Orlando’s outstanding Barossa Riesling.

groups in each State which are similarly
“taking it easy”, but which are poised,
the minute marketing is settled, to cam-
paign strongly for electoral college
voting.
This writer is beginning to feel that
a thing like this is so basic that perhaps
it should not be hidden away because of
expediency. There was a similar section
a few months ago which argued that the
Logan Downs challenge to the validity
of the promotion levy should be drop-
ped because it might damage the chances
of marketing changes. But the hearing
of the Logan Downs case (the tip is it
will be in March) may really be doing
the industry a great service.
These basic matters have to be settled
sooner or later. While they are hidden
away they can only sap industry strength.
If an electoral college system were
brought in, candidates for the Wool In-
dustry Conference would stand for elec-
tion in their own districts, either as in-
dependents or as Graziers’ Association
or United Farmers’ candidates or what
have you. As it stands now, a third,
and fairly big, organisation, namely the
Australian Primary Producers’ Union, is
denied membership of the Wool Indus-
try Conference despite repeated appeals
for admission.
Understandably these appeals have
been rejected because, if admitted, the
APPU would become a third force
capable of swinging the balance of
power.
It is estimated that at least 40 p.c. of
all growers belong to no organisation at
all. They are too busy growing wool, or
they cannot see eye to eye with any of
the organisations, yet in fairness they
deserve a right to have representation.
Being practical, there is no hope of
this business being settled before the big
marketing issue. It should have been
settled a long time ago. One day it will,
nothing is surer than that.
As for the South American venture
by the IWS, it may be a bit too early to
pass comment. Apparently the delega-
tion met with a good hearing. The
chances are brighter for South American
participation than at any time in the
past. South America, however, is a
strange place and political and economic
instability are not unknown there. Time
will tell.
Definitely these South American coun-
tries ought to be paying their share of
the world-wide promotion of wool, as-
suming that the promotion does have
some value. . It may be costing too
much, it may be difficult to comprehend
at times, but only a reactionary would
claim that there is no place at all for
wool promotion. As it stands now, the
South American countries, which pro-
duce some 20 p.c. of the world’s ex-
ported wools, are getting a free ride at
the expense of Australian, South African
and New Zealand growers.

“BOO”
Ever said “boo” to an irate goose? Someone at
Ballantine’s once did, and lost the argument. As a
result, the famous Dumbarton Distillery installed
a unique burglar alarm—7o white geese. All dedi-
cated to help protect Ballantine’s against intruders.
Disturb even one of them and a harsh cackling en-
sues, summoning the entire bodyguard. Their shrill
cacophony is guaranteed to stop any trespasser
in his tracks and quickly alert the authorities.
A clock-round watch by the Ballantine’s geese
ensures that the forty-two whiskies, mostly from
the Highlands, that lie in oak casks in the vast
warehouses, can mature in peace; can mellow in
the moist Scottish atmosphere undisturbed.
Expertly blended, these whiskies will one day
become Ballantine’s—the Superb Scotch.
Is it worth taking all this trouble to protect
Ballantine’s? Try it, see what you think!
