NEAR MONAGHAN TOWN IS FAMOUS ROSSMORE CASTLE
[ N the lovely demesne of Rossmore Park stands this locally well-
known castle of Rossmore, a point of interest for visitors to
the town of Monaghan, in Ireland. Known as Monaghan of the
Little Hills, this Irish county has an undulating countryside in
which everything is “in little.” With a total area of only five
hundred square miles, County Monaghan is watered by the Black-
watep, a famous trout stream, and the Finn River. The town of
Monaghan grew up round a monastery and has become noted as
an educational centre. Among the famous sons of Monaghan was
Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, a noted Irish nationalist. Born in
Monaghan during 1816, he became interested in politics and was
M.P. for New Ross from 1852 to 1855. He emigrated to Australia,
ilnd in 1856 became a member of the Victorian Assembly. He
was twice Minister of Land and Works, and in 1871 served as the
State’s Premier. Sir Charles was knighted in 1873. As well as
political writings, he published an anthology, “Ballad Poetry of
Ireland,” in 1845. Sir Charles Gavan Duffy died at Nice during
February, 1903-, and is remembered for his statesmanship and his
constant affection for his native town of Monaghan.

LIFE OF NELSON .
Really good biography is the rarest of
fruit. It is so much easier for the
facile writer to turn to fiction or to the
semi-fiction of the historical novel; or
even to indulge in the type of potboiling
which is involved in the production of
literary “portraits.”
The writing of sound biography can
be done only when the subject is suf-
ficiently distant to be seen in perspective.
Thus the writer usually has to project
himself or herself back into an un-
familiar world, full of snares and pitfalls.
Understanding of this remote period has
to be obtained by hard experience, which
can only be gained by long toil among
faded print and a tangle of yellow manu-
scripts, invariably hard to read and con-
taining but a few ounces of precious
metals to enormous tonnages of ore. The
processes of extraction are almost as
complicated as those for uranium 235,
and the yield is in inverse ratio to the
importance of the person who is to be
written about. It stands to reason that
the more important the person the more
voluminous are the documents and the
greater the condensation needed.
This is the one reason why notable
historical personages are usually poorly
served by biographers, why there are
no really first-class full-length “lives”
of such men as the two Pitts, and why
those of some other great men have
been sketchily discussed even though im-
mensely written about.
Nelson was one of these latter. There
have, of course, been biographies in ex-
istence, but they are the kind of bio-
graphies which are written within easy
range of a man’s death, while his doting
relatives still bask in the reflection of
his glory and his maiden aunts quail
from the thought that he might at some
time have deviated from the course of
life prescribed for warriors by the Elsie
Series. However, at last, when Nelson
is one of the most documented of all
British heroes and most permanently en-
shrined in the hearts and memories of
British peoples, the work has been done
with satisfying adequacy in Nelson, by
Carola Oman (Hodder and Stough-
ton), who has explored all the known
Nelson material and produced a tremen-
dous volume which will be the death of
that type of Australian critic who feels
that the only proper function of a critic
is to criticise adversely.
There is, indeed, very little to criticise
in this work of Miss Oman, who is Lady
Lenanton in private life, a neighbor of
Bernard Shaw and a daughter of the late
Sir Charles Oman, Chichele Professor of
Modern History at Oxford and best of
authorities on the Peninsular War. It is
exhaustive—6Bl foolscap octavo pages,
plus excellent reference notes, index and
splendid and properly collated illustra-
tions ; and yet it is readable to the
last line, and it would be a dull
dog with only thin blood in, his
veins' who could put it down except under
compulsion. It reflects the personality
of its subject and limns his surroundings
at every stage of his life with clarity.
The thread of the narrative is sustained
in a remarkable manner throughout the
whole length of the book. Yet it is
obvious that behind it is that immense
and industrious toil over detail which is
often a source of dullness. In Miss
Oman’s effort it merely adds richness
to the pattern of her story, which is told
without bias, so far as that is humanly
possible, and without attempts to lend
color to self-illuminating scenes by at-
tempts at fine writing.
It is, of course, a fact that Miss Oman
has had a subject among a thousand for
a perfect biography—one whose life ran
in a single groove, uncomplicated by
digressional activities, flowing in a steady
torrent of adventure from its beginning
to its all-too-sudden and tragical ending.
Of several biographies—or so-called
biographies—of Nelson in existence, the
earliest is that of the Reverend James
Clarke and John M’Arthur, purser of
the Victory, written in 1809 and neces-
sarily bowdlerised—a volume devoted
more to the admiral than to the man.
Then comes Southey’s Life, written in
1813, a tale, as Miss Oman says,
“to hold children from play and old men
from the chimney-corner.” Also on
record is the odious Harrison volume
written to promote the cause of Lady
Hamilton, and the Letters of Lord Nelson
and Lady Hamilton, stolen by the same
poisonous hireling from his unfortunate
patroness.
Lastly, there are the copious seven
volumes of Sir Harris Nicolas, collected
in Letters and Dispatches of Vice-Ad-
miral Lord Nelson and published in 1846,
and some minor essays. A tremendous
mine of original manuscript sources
still lay untapped until Miss Oman
sorted and regularised all that was im-
portant in them.
For a man who, during most of his
life, was sadly ailing and who for the
rest was crippled and racked with pain.
Nelson’s own contribution to his holo-
graphic remainders is remarkable, and the
survival of some of it, having regard to
its effect upon the lives and reputations
of others, has been little short of miracu-
lous.
There still reposes in the Nelson
Museum, Monmouth, the whole of his
correspondence with his wife, from his
letter of proposal to her to his last note
to her before the breach between them.
There are his letterbooks over the most
important years of his service, the logs of
many of h|s famous ships, hundreds of
letters from him and from those most
closely associated with him. There are
his hundreds of letters to Lady Hamilton
bought by Mr. Morrison at the Joseph
Myer sale in the early ’nineties, the
valuable Husband Collection at Harvard
(including the Victory’s log), and many
more which Miss Oman has dredged for
material. All in all, the various comple-
mentary collections provide the necessary
documentation of Nelson’s movements,
thoughts and actions from the moment
when, at 12 years old, he persuaded his
brother to importune his then famous
naval uncle, Captain Maurice Suckling,
to take him to sea until the tragic hour
when he was brought home in a cask of
fine brandy after his death at Trafalgar.
The curious features about his life are
the romantic inevitability ..which beset his
progress ; the sense of coincidence which
hangs over the periodicity of his develop-
ment, the Fate always at hand whenever
needed to spur his flagging spirit and de-
pleted body to the construction of some
new phase of an existence which seemed
to have been framed from the beginning
with a divine and patriotic p urpose.
Thus it comes about that his flair and
enthusiasm for the sea were fanned to
produce an overwhelming impulse to
serve by his family’s interest in the noted
victory by his uncle in the West Indies
on October 21, in the year of his birth,
a date which was presently to mark the
sad triumph of Trafalgar. Thus, too,
it was strange how the story of the
Victory ran with his; how she was
ordered in the year of his birth ; was lying
in the Medway near Raisonnable, his
first ship, when he went to jpin her, a
lonely little boy who wandered the streets
of Chatham in search of his absent uncle.
This sort of fitting-in of date and event
persisted until the tragic moment, the one
in his life with which British people are
most familiar, when he was struck down
upon Victory’s deck on October 21, 1805,
going to his painful death as the most
famous admiral of all time.
Nelson was rated on the books of the
Raisonnable, a French prize, as midship-
man on January 1, 1771. In the succeed-
ing 34 years he saw more of the wide
seas and fought intimately and in person
in more closed actions than probably
any man on record.
By the time he had been, three years
on deck the boy, who previously had
seen no more than three small Norfolk
towns and London from a stage-coach,
had been among the orchids and the
armadillos, the tobacco and the palms
of Florida and Yucatan and Venezuela.
He had known the Bahamas and the
Greater and Lesser Antilles. He had
been almost to the North Pole with Cap-
tain Phipps’s expedition in the Carcass,
and had come nigh to being eaten by
a polar bear which he —fourteen years
of age—had essayed to kill “that I might
take its skin home to my father.” He
had come home to go straight to the
Seahorse, one of the most competent
ships in the Royal Navy, and was off
in a trice to the East Indies to patrol
the coasts from Bengal to Basra, until
malignant malaria marked him for its
own and sent him, who had been ad-
judged by his ship’s master “a fine
physical specimen” forever growing
out of his clothes, home as an ague-
wracked skeleton, whose disease “nearly
baffled the power of medicine.” Gone,
when he sighted the shores of Britain,
was the glowing color of hair and cheek
which had placed him apart from
others.
From March to August, 1776, he had
been tossing in his cot in the little 20-gun
frigate, Dolphin, as she tacked her way
to England from the mouth of the
Ganges, to arrive in the normal state
of malarial convalescents, devoted to the
melancholy contemplation of “the diffi-
culties I have to surmount, the little
influence I possess.” Then it was that
there appeared, out of the very depths
of his feverish depression,- that “radiant
orb” with which his captains later
became familiar; that something which
he seemed to feel tangibly and which
beckoned him ever onwards to fulfil his
destiny and the purposes for which Fate
had designed him:
A sudden glow of patriotism was kindled
within me, and presented by King and
Country as my patron. My mind exulted in
the idea. “Well, then,” I exclaimed, “I
will be a hero and, confiding in Providence,
I will brave every danger.”
The Very day Dolphin was paid off a
gaunt young face under lacklustre hair,
followed by a gaunt figure, appeared
over the bulwarks of the Worcester, 64,
and what seemed to be a materialised
ghost presented letters from his uncle to
Captain Mark Robinson. In a few days
he was rolling down through Biscay,
passing Trafalgar on the way to Gibral-
tar at the end of the first week of the
New Year of 1777, an acting-lieutenant
at 18 years of age. When he came home
to sit in Xpril for his examination as
lieutenant and passed with flying colors
he had become the pale, sad, boyish
youth of the Rigaud portrait who looks
alike too small for his uniform, for his
cocked hat and particularly for his sword.
And thereafter it was the West Indies
with Locker in the Lowestofte, fit
master for such a pupil (“Always lay a
Frenchman close, and you will beat
him.”). They went out with a convoy
of eighteen sail of merchantmen and took
a prize which he boarded in black
weather. Before he was 20 he was
a post-captain. Before he was 30 he had
commanded a squadron, and a future
King of England had been best man at
his strange wedding to the widow of
Dr, Josiah Nisbet. Before he was 33
his name was a legend. After that,
despite a fateful period of history in
which he had spent five years “on the
beach,” each engagement added lustre
to his reputation and built a new legend,
emphasised by the fact that he was al-
ways the central figure of whatever he
undertook, and that no new glory Was
won without some new physical sacrifice
calling for pity as well as applause.
One feels the sense of the inevitability
of his sacrifices more strongly as the can-
vas widens and the fate of the pale little
captain is merged with the fate of nations.
The picture forms a natural whole,
each part related and of a pattern with
what went before and came after. One
could almost write a formula for it —the
crisis on which some major phase of the
Napoleonic drama depends, the tall ship
superbly handled with its affectionate and
almost worshipping crew of “old Croco-
diles” or old “Agamemnons,” the fight
fierce and sharp, the brilliant victory,
the emergence from it of a bloody,
reeling figure, ever more battered but ever
undaunted. The tale is milestoned by one
staring and useless eye after Calvi. An
arm hangs loose and is cut off when its
owner has scrambled out of the darkness
up the side after the unbelievably gallant
but hopeless adventure of Teneriffe. The
forehead is furrowed with an ugly wound
in Aboukir Bay. For ten years from
St. Vincent to Trafalgar there is no naval
victory in which that depleted form is
not the central figure and no naval failure
which does not lead to a general national
reflection that all would have been well
if Nelson had been there.
Woven through the legend is his love-
story, as much a national concern almost
as his victories, carried on with a boyish
and sometimes sordid artifice which
deceived nobody, and built round a plot
which not all the genius of a sentimental
age could have made as effective as
reality.
The whole story forms a drama in
which, nations play parts as well as human
characters. But it is dominated through-
out by the little one-armed sailor in
the shabby uniform with the embroidered
stars upon the breast, whom Hardy found
no longer beside him as they paced
together between the wheel and the
admiral’s cabin hatchladder in the midst
of Victory’s two-sided duel with Redou-
table and overshadowing Santissima
Trinidad at 1.35 p.m. on October 21,
1805.
Miss Oman has clothed this figure in
the substance of a really powerful nar-
rative which it would be difficult
to , better for lucidity, restraint and
dignity. It will be a long time before
her biography will be improved upon.
It can never be amplified save in minor
details and through an expansion of the
already excellent annotation.

Various Verse
Delight.
From a wreck of tree in the wash of night
Glory, glory, sings the bird;
Across ten thousand years of light
His creative voice is heard.
Wide on a tide of wind, are set
Warp and woof of silvered air;
But the song slips through the net
To where the myriad galaxies are.
And to the heartbeats of the light.
Now from the deepness of the glade
Well up the bubbles of delight:
Of such stuff the stars were made.

Of Bacchus, in the Marsh.
Gently time spins
And, humming, sings
Of the lost stories,
The mind-emptied things:
Bald Hill is mute on Coomaidai,
But the grey box dream of days
When the curlews drowned the frog bells
Along the waterways,
How Loirederk and Werribee
Had meetings on Main Street,
Before men crippled them with weirs
And locked their wandering feet.
Men overlanded from the south.
They overlanded from the east ;
Mountains no more were barriers,
But hills of home for man and beast.
And when Black Thursday broke in fire,
Darkened cloud-acres of the sky,
The road dust spelt the runic wrath
Of maddened horsemen flying by;
And racing them through Melton Plains
A wall of flame lit Beremboke;
Men fought it on the pasture flats
While Parwan farms went up in smoke.
From Buninyong, from Forest Creek,
The gilded diggers passed, and sang;
From Travellers’ Rest to Stamford Bridge
Their clinking quart-pots rang.
One crossed Deep Creek on a knife-blade plank
While the troopers lurked at the ford below,
When Moonlight robbed the Egerton Bank
Seventy years ago.
And lost is Finnan’s lucerne flat
Where the grave kestrels hover,
And faint the track round Stufhpey Hill
That wind and rain discover.
Like drums that beat for passing shades,
I hear bronzewings on Lairederk,
The dingoes bay round Rockbank stones,
And Peter Lalor speak in Bourke.
Here, where a soldier squatted,
In country grand and harsh.
They gave the place his happy name
Of Bacchus, in the Marsh.

The Big House.
The house is the same —and who are the new
people ?
Faces held, posed to dissemble; and the people
Who hide behind them, piqued, at a loss,
Because we know them immediately in the big
house.
Strange is the house to them; not strange to us.
Wc know it will turn the household fastidious
In their new habits, acquiring a certain grace;
Chessmen demeanors are leased with this sort
of place.
Walk in. They’ll waive the bans, greet us like
kings,
Mistaking our common blood ’mid the hubbub
of things:
Honk of a car on the drive, bells, clanking 0}
chains . ,
And a giant clock in the hall counting times
gains.
With luck is linked a fine lady. Yes, she is
here:
Quite young with pert tongue and, some say, a
liking for beer; \
Small talk, and a power that’s bred in her
animal jaws.
Not surprising, you think, if later she shows
us her claws.
Better were these for the pantry, not the great
hall; ..
Perhaps were its servants onoe. Indecent to can.
Remember , the place is big; but mere brick ana
plaster. ~
I ask you —house or host, which of these shou t
be our master?

Left Incline.
My little dog trots breezily.
Sedately, easily, «
On his own small affairs intent,
On his own serious business bent;
The line of his advance is straight
As a taut thread, yet in his gait
Is there not something comical and arresting-
The axis of his body is inclined
At a slight angle, don’t you find?
To that firm line of his advance,
And not by chance,
A little to the left, so that he seems,
You know,
To mean to go
Not quite the way he actually goes,
Not as his backbone leads you ' to suppose,
So, perhaps, we who seem
Leftwards ever to incline
Towards some sweet, imagined dream,
Along a planned and regulated line
Swiftly, by authority decreed,
Travel indeed,
In spite of all the ideologists may say,
Quite another way
At quite a different speed.

Method of cleaning an enclosed
brick fireplace stained and blackened
by smoke ?
When ordinary scrubbing with hot
water and soap fails to clean them
satisfactorily they should be scrubbed
down with an old brush dipped in a
diluted solution of spirits of salts or
hydrochloric acid. This usually proves
quite effective. Three parts of water
should be added to one of acid and
the solution applied carefully, so that
it does not come into contact with
the cement between the bricks, for
the acids act on cement and the joint-
ing would become loosened. After
treatment all traces of the chemicals
must be rinsed away.

(1) How to eradicate (1) Paddy’s
Lucerne and (2) Onion Weed?
(1) It is suggested that you spray
with sodium chlorate at the strength
of lib. to 1 gallon of water and apply
at the rate of 100 to 150 gallons of
spray mixture per acre. Care should
be exercised in the use of sodium
chlorate as it is highly inflammable.
(2) There is no weed-killer that is
sufficiently effective to use as a spray
for the purpose of destroying the
bulbs of this plant; some arsenical
weedicides will kill off the top-growth,
hut they do not affect the bulbs.
By digging up or forking out this
weed during the period June-
September, most of the old and young
bulbs can be lifted out of the ground
as they remain attached to the plant.
However, if this work is delayed until
after that period, all of the young
bulbs will break off I *when the plants
are moved and so remain in the
ground.

At what income is a single man
without dependants liable for income
and social services tax? What is
the position regarding income tax if
he is a primary producer?
For the year ended June 30, 1948,
he is not liable to income tax where
his taxable income does not exceed
£250, nor is he liable for social ser-
vices contribution if his income is
less than £lO4. If he is a primary
producer, liability to taxation depends
on his average income. In the case
of a primary producer whose taxable
income exceeds £250, but whose aver-

THE RALWAY GAME
BY
GLORIA
RAWLIN SON
ONCLE VINCENT’S chief charac-
teristic was wholeheartedness,
which served as a steed to carry
him across little paddocks of
popularity. In these paddocks, however,
he had suffered losses, always through
mistaking acquaintances for friends. As
a mysterious relation who sent postal-
notes on birthdays he had worn a halo,
but after a week’s visit this was rapidly
fading.
He stood on the verandah, a large
travelling-bag at his feet, watching the
children collect the odds and ends they
considered necessary when playing the
Railway Game. On the first day of his
visit they had played Crossing the Tas-
man—a screaming, boisterous romp that
had' little to do with aviation. Uncle
Vincent, who had twice crossed the Tas-
man, was about to correct some of their
many fallacies when the branch that had
long served as their plane broke under
the weight of a jumping pilot and four
lusty passengers.
This accident sent them back to an old
favorite, the Railway Game. He was eyen
more critical of the muddling way they
played what should have been a simple,
interesting and instructive diversion.
ROBERT was enginedriver with box
wagons hitched to his bicycle ; Tui
Rorke was guard, but he became porter
or stationmaster at a moment’s notice;
Jamesie Stewart, in charge of freight,
could be considered an authority on such
things as his father worked in the railway
freight-yards. Little Evelyn was ticket-
collector ; Margaret a signalman, holding
a wand of wild watsonia in one hand
and pumpkin-leaf in the other. She also
played many parts on many stations —a
schoolgirl, an old lady with parcels, a dis-
tracted woman who had lost her ticket.
But her star role was the Fainting Lady.
“Are you going to do the Fainting
Lady?” asked Robert impatiently. The
act held up the game because Margaret
had to mark with shells the spot where
the Mercury Bay weed grew thickest.
The real Fainting Lady had fallen grace-
fully backwards, and it took courage to
teeter about on your heels and then go
thud, like a board, into the grass. Then
she had to look over the fence, making
sure-that the Gundry children were not
about; a row of chicken-yellow heads
was liable to pop up at a critical moment
and she could never faint satisfactorily
with their suppressed giggles and snorts
of mirth in her ears.
There was the cracked jug of water
which Tui poured over her face to be in-
spected. His allowance was measured
with a teaspoon. Margaret had not for-
gotten the time when he filled the jug to
the brim. With dripping hair and wet
clothes the Fainting Lady had leapt to
her feet and punched him —to the
hysterical joy of the peeping Gundrys.
THE game began at the wash-house.
Here Robert gave orders to an
imaginary stoker and discussed the price
of coal with Evelyn, whose part in the
conversation was strictly limited. Tui
hitched up the boxes, inspected and
tapped wheels, and Jamesie took good
care of his precious freight.
“No, we don’t stop at Melbourne, not
this trip, we go straight through the tunnel
to the Woodly Bit,” Robert suddenly
shouted. “All aboard, get out of the
way, Evelyn. Hey, stand back there!
Yes, Miss, your seat is reserved, I think.”
Away went the express, bicycle-bell
ringing, boxes clattering, guard hooting
and children shouting.
At the Woodly Bit Robert temporarily
gave up his high position as enginedriver
to help a bad character named Robfy
aboard. Roofy was a broom with an old
hat tied to his bristles. He was strapped
into the end wagon after much argument
with Jamesie, who refused to accept him
as freight. Then Robert and Tui shook
hands.
“Good work, eh! Yes, sir, we caught
him that time. Tell the ticket-collector to
keep an eye on him. Aw, get out of the
way, Evelyn, he doesn’t need a ticket,
he’s arrested, we told you that before.”
A stop always meant a few minutes
acting for Margaret.
“Goodbye, my dear one!” she kissed
a pumpkin. “Home for Easter! Don’t
worry”-—this to a football —“everything
will be O.K. Although I don’t show it
I’m feeling this parting dreadfully,
Mabel.” Sobbing. “I’ll never get over
this blow, oh, yes, you will, time is a
great healer —get the jug, Tui, I’m doing
the Fainting Lady next.”
I T was at this stage that Uncle Vincent
A picked up his bag and called to the
children. They came reluctantly and
stood by the verandah looking up at him.
“Now, I’m going to give you each a
guess. What have lin this bag, Robert?”
Robert glanced at the bag, his eyes
deliberately veiled with dullness.
“I don’t know. Your clothes?”
‘Wrong! Very much wide of the
mark. Margaret?”
“Oh, my guess is a tent, or something.”
“Wrong again, What bad guessers you
are. Evelyn?”
Evelyn gave him a look of exaggerated
awe and bashfulness.
“Lemonade, because it’s so hot.”
“Oh, dear me, no!” Uncle Vincent
thought they were not very intelligent
children after all. Not smart . . . He
turned to Tui Rorke.
“Well, now, how about this boy? Can
you guess, laddie?”
“It wouldn’t be toheroas, would it?”
Tui ventured.
“There speaks the Maori! Of course
not. Where would I get toheroas from,
I’d like to know? I haven’t been to the
Ninety Mile Beach and back this morn-
ing. Well, how about the Scotsman, eh,
James?”
Jamesie was superlatively good. He
could see that this wretched Uncle Vin-
cent needed humoring.
“It might be eggs, but I don’t think
so. It’s not the dead cat that was out
on the road because the council cart
came and took it away. It was going
bad. I know!' It’s apples!”
With a desperately patient smile Uncle
Vincent opened the bag. Out of it he
drew signs and signals, peaked caps and
whistles.
“We are going to have a real railway
game,” he told the children, and mounted
Wholeheartedness. “Now you just watch
Uncle Vincent fix things up for you.
There’s a right way of playing a game
and a wrong one. You didn’t know that,
did you, Scotty, my wee laddie? Look
after the details and your plan will be
perfect, isn’t that so, Marguerita?”
| N a few minutes he had made a sur-
-1 prising mess in the yard. He altered
the names of their stations. “No, no!
You just can’t have a Melbourne station,
not in this country. And New York!
That has to go! Now, listen, this is
Auckland, see? And here is Frankton,
and the place you call the Woodly Bit
is Wellington. This is a better place for
a tunnel than crawling under that bush,
Robert always went round it, and that
was wrong. I have a bit of canvas to
cover it over.”
He moved their stations from the
watsonia and bamboo. He threw Roofy
out of the game altogether. He placed
some white boards for platforms and
gave Margaret a red flag and a green
one. He had a leather bag and tickets
for Evelyn, whistles and caps for Robert
and Tui.

Worsley Enchanted
( Concluded .)
8.
(He looks at a sick man.)
I knew a ship whose rigging was white with
rime
The sick man whispered in sleep below the
decking,
A bird' that flew in the silver and darkening
time
On a creeping sea where the tall waves stood
without breaking.
I do not know the name of the spider of cold
That searches the whole of the heavens for ship
and men
But the timbers cracked and the sea walked
into the hold
When the weaver of that white web had ceased
to spin.
If that is the sun let it not shine in here
The sick man said, tasting his mouth of salt;
Here’s where the sleeping-bag sheds its rotting
hair *
And the boulders lie like skulls in the icy vault.
When somebody burnt himself with the primus
stove
Three nights ago, you laughed, then laugh at
me,
For I am burnt in'side me, and cold when I
move,
Freezing cold and breathing the cold of the sea.
What light is it there on deck, what hour of the
day?
Said the man who sweated in the frozen
sleeping-bag,
What day in the week, what week in the month
you might say,
What year of our lives where wallowing the
minutes drag?
What place in the sea have we got to? Let
nobody answer.
Has the big wave gone? I do not want to
know.
Among the stones with my head lolling like a
dancer
Here is no place and no time and let it be so.
What is there here but my matted beard and
my hair
Like seaweed dank on a face worn white as a
skull ?
In the spit of the ocean I weep, for I have
coms far.
Come far, and would like to die; and am lying
so still
In the roll of the boat I am dead; and am
watching my hand
There on the stones like a crab, a hand that is
moving.
Is clawing my burning throat, is stretching for
land,
So close to us now through the sea though we
come to it raving.
9,
(They find and lose South Georgia.)
Land, land! Stony and monstrous but land!
Shackleton cries, watching the burst of the
breakers
On cliffs of granite and ice in the fog and the
wind.
And somewhere over the mountains in those
fierce acres
There are huts and men, and snug in a deep
green harbor,
Dead whales with enormous bellies, and
anchored ships
With blood on their decks, a shambles of ribs
and blubber.
Oh, scour the decks, good seamen, cast off the
ropes.
For I shall be sailing to rescue my twenty-two
men
And wash from my heart and my dream an icy
shambles
Of blood and defeat, like foam showing black
in the sun
In the scream at the glacier's end when the
iceberg tumbles.
Steady now if we do not want to lose her
At the journey’s end as the stormy dusk
converges.
For steep are the crags as they loom up closer
and closer,
High on the snowy cliffs is the snow of the
surges.
There on the ledge there is rock, there are
tussocks growing,
There are runnels of water flowing, it is land,
it is life,
It is victory white and tremendous; and a breath
is blowing
Of hurricane coming; and we cannot land in
that surf.
Turn her to sea, said Shackleton, staring in
horror,
Where is the land? There is only shadow and
spray
And the howl of the gale and the seething of
broken water —-
They could not do it, they could not take it
away.
10.
(He hears the sick man.)
Crazy with thirst and cast on that terrible ocean
Of midnight and nightmare, the sick man said,
I go down.
Shouting with mouthfuls of combers, gulping
the suction
Of depths below me, swirling in water alone;
Staring at walls of greyness, a glaze on the eye.
A cracking behind the eyeballs, a roar in the
brain,
The phantoms of horror and pain as I struggle
to die.
Wavering now, grown calm in the deeper green,
The sick man said, how quietly down I slip
Where the long weeds wave in the peace of the
deep-sea pool
And the fishes with goggling eyes swim near to
gape
And the crab may finger the tranquil body at
will.
Let the dead thing bloat and rot and dissolve
in the tide
For this is the ultimate blackness and I am no
more
Than seaweed uprooted and lost, I am part of
the mud,
Nothing in the midst of nothing on the ocean’s
floor.
Suppose q .man were nothing and knew he was
nothing,
And rose and fiery green in a cold aurora
The deep-sea fishes rove where the weeds are
waving
And time has stopped, so time goes on for
ever —
Who can I talk to drowned in that great gulf.
What can-I listen to, look at, be thinking about.
Alone for ever with the thing I have made
myself,
Alone for ever in the water that batters the
boat?
11.
(He sees the end of the boat journey.)
A rag of sail in a hurricane, Shackleton said,
And now I know why we looked like a fishing
smack
Rolling far out in the sea with a load of the
dead.
Where do the white gulls go when the night is
black ?
Drifting, drifting, drifting in endless disaster
And a leaking boat and tired men longing for
land
And nothing at all to be done but struggle with
the water
And wait for the dawn with the thought we are
near our end.
Call it the grace of the South or call it luck,
Shackleton said, it would have been wrong to
perish
And golden as life is the light on upland and
peak
And white as delight are the pennants the
breakers flourish.
Sixteen days out from Elephant Island —
Lord, here are haggard men with hollow eyes
Staring beyond the reef at the water inland
Where Haakon Bay lies blue between the snows.
Shackleton rubs his eyes with a frost-bitten
hand,
1 have beaten the wind, he says, and the sea
and the ice,
As five times tacking, inch by inch to the land
The James Caird comes where the sunlit
breakers race
And streamers of kelp show brown in the gap
of the reef.
Steady her in on the swell, she will do it now,
Shackleton said as the boat rode in and was
safe,
Shackleton said as he stood up straight in the
bow.
12.
(The landing.)
Gigantic the mountains rear
Where rocks and glaciers mingle
Bui we have done with fear
Who thought to have done with speech
And at long last we hear
The sound of a keel on shingle.
The wash of a boat on a beach.
13.
(Worsley, with Shackleton and Crean, the
sick men left in King Haakon Sound, climbs
the mountains of South Georgia to cross to the
whaling station at Stromness Bay.)
High peaks, impassable cliffs, steep slopes of
snow,
A landscape of black and white where in shadow
and gleam
And streams of icy silver, immeasurably slow.
The glaciers move in a time not human time
And far below us like a broad fallen tree
With branches and leaves of silver, its crown
in the sea,
King Haakon Bay lies lapped in the trance of
dream.
And again it seems, as the flame of the moon-
light throws
Among the ridges vast as a frozen gale
Our shadows in long black rivers across the
snows.
That we are but dwarfed reflections and our
shadows real.
Warring with shapes of mountains, watched
from afar.
As if, jewelled with light, the earth were a star
Where move those mysterious beings our skies
conceal.
14.
(They have the impression that a fourth man
is travelling with them.)
This man is nothing, invisible,
This man is ghostly, impossible,
Nobody following us, nobody
Keeping us silent company.
Casting no shadow he follows
Our long black following shadows.
“Some seaman’s ghost perhaps?
Some traveller from the crevasses?”
In the mountains there are no ships.
And this way no traveller passes.
He is not here but he watches us.
Checked on the edge of the precipice.
“Creatures of tempests and mists?”
God help them then if they go
Wandering these white wastes
While centuries sink in snow.
This is no country for man,
A land like the back of the moon.
"I cannot touch him nor see.
1 cannot speak to the air.”
Only we know we are three
And a fourth man is moving here:
On his own purposes bent.
Grave and indifferent.
All night and all day and all night
In the mountainous land without rest.
And the trudging of heavy feet,
The fingers of fog on the crest:
He gives no direction, no warning.
He is light in the sunlight burning.
All things flower out of nothing:
Here nothing itself is moving.
This man is nothing, intangible.
This man is with us, unchangeable,
Travelling the snowfields, somebody.
Keeping us silent company.
.15. ,
(Crean and Worsley fall into the sleep of
exhaustion.)
At the foot of the final spur we lay in the snow.
The light drift whitening our clothes. The last
I saw . ,
Was Shackleton, hunched and immense, me
moon on his brow
Lighting the eagle’s mouth and the bearded
face.
The glittering planet swung in the circle of space.
Shackleton woke us: ‘‘l was not alone while I
watched
But if I had fallen asleep he would not have
spoken ,
Nor laid on mortal flesh the touch of
immortal; „
Pity is in their minds, their actions pitiless.
These words were spoken at dawn at the end
of the world.
The bundles of death that had slept in the
snow uncurled.
A gap of color showed where the peaks were
broken,
And there, far down, with a grey and misty
glimmer
Lay Stromness Bay, and safety, and Husvik
Harbor.
16.
(Out of the waterfall at Stromness Bay.)
Commander Worsley fired with a purpose
Plunged in the stream like a stocky porpoise,
Down the fall in one wild charge
His blunt nose burst like the bow of a barge,
Rocks and branches battered and tore him.
Mosses and clay gave way before him.
Crean fell down and Shackleton after,
Three wild men in the blinding water,
Primus stove and ropes and axe
Flew through the air like startled ducks,
Worsley roared to the sky on top,
“Here’s a waterfall right side up / v
Commander Worsley squared his shoulders
Grinned at his boots like two black boulders,
“You rolled me down to the end of the earth,
You rolled me south and you’ll roll me north.
But bright’s the sunlight and bright s the stream
And a man can walk in the midst of a dream.
Where the leaves are green on the branches
Three wild men like water monsters;
Ragged and hairy and dripping wet.
Hungry and haunted and human yet.
Out of the water into the sun
Three wild men come one by one.

HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS.
No one could be better quali-
fied than the Kremlin crew
to write a book on How to Lose
Friends and Make Enemies. In
the mere year or two since the
war they have succeeded in
killing off, in Britain, America
and elsewhere, as vast a mass
of sentimental friendly regard,
bordering on mush, as has ever
Welled up for any foreign
country, not excepting “poor
little Belgium.”
The writings of his aides and
advisers now show that one of
the first to be disillusioned was
President Roosevelt. In his
lately-published memoirs war-
time U.S. Secretary of War
Henry L. Stimson states that
Roosevelt “had in his last weeks
wholly lost sympathy with the
Russians.” One of the things
POINTS OF CONFLICT. —New York “Times.”
(1) EUROPEAN UNION Western Powers uniting to halt expansion of U.S.S.R. (2) GERMANY-AUSTRIA —Control of this political-economic
key to Europe is at stake (3) TRIESTE—Inability to agree on a Governor prevents establishment of new State; the Western nations countering Soviet
obstruction tactics by offering Trieste back to Italy. (4) ITALY-Struggle for Italy intensifies with approach of decisive April 18 elections, (5)

that caused their former good
friend to change was “the failure
of the Russians to carry out the
Yalta provisions for a genuinely
reconstructed Polish Govern-
ment.” Another was the aggres-
sive attitude of the patently
Soviet-directed Yugoslavs to-
wards Trieste, which “struck Mr.
Roosevelt as wholly unjustified
and deeply disquieting.” What
would Roosevelt have thought of
what has happened since?.
Stimson, for his part, is typical
of the greater mass of one-time
Soviet adulators. He admits
that, like the President, he felt
that “consciously or uncon-
sciously” the Russians were
“irritating beyond the normal
degflee of permissible interna-
tional effrontery,” that “our
trustfulness and courtesy
seemed to inspire little, if any,
reciprocity.” But he himself, he
confesses, was all for the utmost
forebearance; he did not share
the “attitude of general im-
patience” that “came over the
Administration” regarding*
Russia in Roosevelt’s last weeks ;
and, in fact, it was not until last
year that Stimson was forced to
realise that he had been chasing
a mirage.
Another striking example is
David Lawrence, even more
forbearing in the hope that
Russia might be persuaded “to
join in making world peace.”
Lawrence, whose N. Y. “Sun”
column and authoritative publi-
cation “U.S. News-World Re-
port” have often been quoted
here, is one of the best-informed
and most solid of American
writers, and has been one of the
few impartial critics of the Tru-
man Doctrine. He has seen it
as threatening any hope there
might be of getting along with
Russia, a hope in which he per-
sisted right up to the Czecho-
slovakia grab.
Hence a subsequent signed
leading article by Lawrence in
“U.S. News-World Report” is as
significant as anything could be
on what the Kremlin crew
have managed to do to the great
mass of American regard. Re-
ferring to the Czechoslovakia,
grab—“ Soviet Russia stands con-
victed before the world of hav-
ing committed an act of aggres-
sion "against an independent
State” —Lawrence, shortly be-
fore Mr. Truman gave out his
direct warning, commented;
The whole world is sick and tired
of war, but it cannot at the same
time be indifferent to potential attack.
Aggression is a- process that first
attacks the small States, places the
people under a tyrannical yoke and
then presents the rest of the world
with a take-it-or-leave-it challenge.
In 1938, at Munich, the Western
democracies tried appeasement because
they were too weak in a military sense
to face a war. In 1948 the Western
democracies are strong enough to
take a firm stand against aggression
and strong enough also to make a
last attempt to settle the whole prob-
lem peacefully without seeming to be
craven.
Russia is in no position to carry on
effectively a world war. If the other
nations, however, permit her to grow
stronger and to occupy more and
more territory and to gather under
her wing more and more countries,
then it will be too late to fight a war
without making enormous sacrifices.
The time to prevent World War
111 is now. It must be done by a
demonstration of firmness —by a de-
mand that the air be cleared and that
Russian intentions be defined.
The world cannot afford to ignore
the possibility that war may be the
only way out. At the same time, it
cannot afford to ignore peaceful
methods, plus a manifestation of
readiness to fight.
What makes peaceful negotiation
embarrassing, perhaps, is the mistaken
inference that the nation seeking such
negotiation will make peace at any
price. We can overcome such in-
ferences.
There is a line beyond which
Russia must not go. That line should
be drawn now. If Russia goes be-
yond the line it means war. We
must resolutely face that issue. For
no more logical definition of defence
was ever given than that contained in
the message of the President of the
United States on May 16, 1940, when
he said: —
“An effective defence by its very
nature requires the equipment to
attack the aggressor on his route be-
fore he can establish strong bases
within the territory of American vital
interests.”
We must restrain Russian aggres-
sion now before it becomes an attack
on our own safety.
The line beyond which R&ssia must
not advance is not just geographical.
It is a line which defines interference
in the affairs of any sovereign State.
Russia must not deprive any
country of its independence and must
withdraw troops from any foreign
country where she is now using force
to impose political policy.
Russia also must give guarantees
that she will not invade the
sovereignty of any nation.
What occurred in Prague must be
publicised before the bar of world
opinion. The evidence is overwhelm-
ing. If Russia insists on blocking
such a trial by the use of her veto
power in the United Nations some
other form of international confer-
ence must be summoned to try the
case.
Once the infamy has been exposed
to view and the whole world sees the
issue, there will be no public hesita-
tion to apply military force, if neces-
sary, to halt any other aggression.
The technique used in Czechoslo-
vakia to overthrow Parliamentary
Government is the familiar pattern of
infiltration that Hitler used. Italy can
be the next victim, and then France.
If Italy falls our strategic bases in
North Africa become less effective.
If Greece and Turkey fall the way is
opened to Soviet control of the Medi-
terranean
We could fight our way back
into Europe by slow stages as we did
before. But why not face the issue
now and insist on a showdown?
Lawrence contends that “there
is no reason to engage in war
merely because the Russians
have extended their ‘sphere of
influence’ in the Balkans”:
The world has lived before under
“spheres of influence.” There is a
difference, however, between a “sphere
of influence” for national trade or
economic purposes and a brazen
attempt to obtain territory for mili-
tary attack on other States. A
“sphere of influence” must not mean
the loss of national freedom for a
country, nor can it mean the use of
neighboring territory as a base for
attack on peaceful countries beyond
the “sphere of influence.”
He concludes:
We should approach Russia with-
out bluster. We should require con-
formity to a code of international be-
havior. We should warn that aggres-
sion means war, and we should leave
no doubt that we shall regard such
aggression as an attack on the United
States.
It is painful to proclaim such a
course, but it is better to do so now
than to be compelled to fight a third
world war that could have been pre-
vented by a timely expression of
policy. "*
Thus, up to a point, Lawrence
speaks for those who, in spite of
aggressions as gross as aggres-
sions can be, have a shred of
hope still. But clearly it is now
only a shred. Accepting the
assumption that “a timely ex-
pression of policy” could be
effective, Mr. Truman gave* a
clear enough expression in his
special “preparedness” call to
Congress on March 17. But
there is also another assumption
yet to be proved—that the
holders of the Kremlin are not,
as Hitler was, mad.
“Feeler” From Joe
That Joe Stalin proposed a
meeting to talk things over with
Truman and that Truman turned
it down is maintained by “U.S.
News-World Report,” insisting
that its facts are right despite
“technical denials.”
Stalin, it states, made the offer
late in January: “The purpose,
apparently, was to try to find a
basis for armistice in the ‘cold
war’ between U.S. and Russia.”
The emissary from Stalin who
conveyed the proposal was told
that Mr. Truman had made it
clear he would not travel to
Russia. This was countered with
the suggestion that the meeting
should take place at Stockholm.
This alternative was put up to
Secretary of State Marshall, he
and the President deciding “to
rebuff the suggestion,”
The publication mentions
“technical denials” by the Secre-
tary of State and by the White
House through a press secretary,
but insists: “The fact is that the
proposal was brought to Wash-
ington and turned down.”
There was not, it states, full
agreement among those con-
cerned that it should have been
turned down, the decision resting
on an interpretation of the mean-
ing in the offer.. It was variously
interpreted: (1) as a show of
Russian weakness; * (2) as a
trick to scuttle the Marshall Plan
for aid to Europe; (3) as a desire
on the part of Russian leaders to
find a means of obtaining some
Marshall Plan dollars. The view
not agreed with was that the
Stalin offer was bona fide and
should be accepted.
One Potsdam being more than
enough for him, Mr. Truman has
several times stated that if there
was to be another meeting it
would be in the White House.
He is said to have reiterated that
attitude in connection with the
Stalin offer.
“U.S. News-World Report”
adds: “The rebuff to Mr.
Stalin’s advance is accepted
as a signal that the struggle be-
tween the United States and
Russia is to go on. The Truman
doctrine, which calls for use of
U.S. resources to contain Russia,
stands as basic U.S. policy.
Each side is committed to a
struggle, short of shooting, of
making gains at the expense of
the other side. No early attempt
is to be made to reach an under-
standing and compromise.”
Next-war Weapons.
Well-known t o Australia
through his war-time air com-
mand, U.S. General George C.
Kenney contends) in the Ameri-
can “Ordnance Magazine” that
last-war weapons are already out
of date. He looks into the prob-
lems posed by present terrific
air - speeds, instancing such
curious examples as this:
Simple riveting jobs won’t do in
the modern fighter or bomber whose
surfaces have to be as smooth as
glass. We can gain 15 miles an hour
on a jet fighter by a smooth paint
job over the normal polished alu-
minium surface. But when the con-
tinual flexing of the wings puts a few
cracks in the paint we lose 25 miles
an hour. So far we haven’t been able
to develop a paint that doesn’t crack.
As well as finding paint that
sticks, “we must start all over
again” in armaments. Also, last-
war bombs are obsolete for new
high-speed aircraft;
The present shapes are so poor that
no one knows where they would hit
if they were released at modern
speeds. They would simply tumble
all over the sky, shedding fins and
possibly detonating themselves in the
violence of their own gyrations if
dropped from a bomb-bay at a speed
of 600 miles an hour.
New bombs must have surfaces as
smooth as the aircraft which carries
them.
The fuses no longer will be simple
contact affairs. Inside the bomb cas-
ing, in addition to the explosive
charge, will be all kinds of electronic
devices to guide the bomb to its
target.
Present machine-guns, too,
are starting to get into the bow-
and-arrow class:
Today machine-gun bullets are fired
at intervals of one-twentieth of a
second apart, each bullet trailing the
other by 170 feet. But in one-
twentieth of a second a 600-mile-an-
hour fighter moves 44 feet. If we

want to be sure of hitting airplanes
in air combat we must get those bul-
lets closer. That means a higher rate
of fire and multiple-gun installations.
For higher rate of fire tougher metals
that can withstand terrific heats must
be developed.
Spain Has Hopes.
Whatever the reason, hardly
anything ever appears in cables
regarding the gradual return of
Spain to such place as it formerly
held in international affairs.
The omission is not from
want of reports in overseas,
especially American, papers on
which the cablers draw for their
news. Moreover, there is in
America increasing comment in
favor of the return, particularly
by those who contend that
Spain’s participation would be a
considerable benefit to the
Marshall Plan.
In N. Y. “Post” (anything but
an adulator of any brand of
Fascism) George Fielding Eliot
points out that “it is precisely
the Russians and their friends
who constantly insist on bring-
ing up the subject of ‘doing
something about Franco’ at
every session of the U.N.O.
General Assembly, and also in
the Security Council,” He gives
samples of the kind of comment
now increasingly heard:
So Franco is a dictator. Well,
what is Perdh, whose Government we
insisted on admitting to the U.N. in
the name of Latui-American solid-
arity? How about Western European
solidarity, then? So Franco was a
collaborator. Well, what is Field
Marshal Luang Pibul Songgram, who
has seized power in Siam and who
was die man who handed Siam over
to the Japanese and declared war on
the United States and Great Britain?
Has anybody suggested kicking Siam
out of the U.N. because Songgram
is now head man there? (As a matter
of fact, our good friends in the
Kremlin resumed diplomatic relations
with Siam five days after Songgram
took over.) So Franco keeps his
political opponents in jail. Well, for
crying out loud, what happens to the
political opponents of Stalin, or Tito,
or Trujillo, or Chiang Kai-Shek, or
a lot of other people whom we still
find ourselves able to work v/ith and
recognise?
That, Eliot reports, “is how
the argument is being put in
really responsible areas of dis-
cussion both in Washington and
in London. It is a good guess,”
he adds, “that we will hear
further and more concrete dis-
cussion of this problem as this
year of decision grows older.”
In Spain itself, the N. Y.
“Times’s” Madrid correspondent
reports, hope is now running
high. The hope took fresh in-
spiration from the opening of
the French-Spanish border, and
there are other grounds. One is
the Spanish argument that Spain
is the oldest and has been the
most relentless enemy of Com-
munism. Another is that Spain
is “a geographically vital factor
in any European military
strategy,” and yet another that
Spain could give material assist-
ance in European recovery.
A significant pointer to what
seems to be steadily developing
is that since last July Spain “has
signed commercial agreements
with five of the 16 Marshall
Plan signatory nations, has nor-
mal relations with a sixth, is
currently negotiating an agree-
ment with a seventh and is
carrying on considerable busi-
ness with an eighth.”
Lion and Cubs.
Always as friendly in its com-
ments on J. Bull and Co. as
honest fairness permits, N, Y.
“Times” recently paid a neat
tribute to what the British Em-
pire has developed into; very
different from the amusing
representation of the same in
the Chicago “Tribune” cartoon
reproduced on this page.
N. Y. “Times” looked at the
old firm as it can be viewed in
U.N.0., “one of the best mirrors
for seeing the British Common-
wealth of Nations as it stands
today, new in concept, indi-
vidual in national sovereignty,
united on the gravest world
political issues'.”
Touching on British Secretary
of State for Commonwealth Re-
lations Philip Noel - Baker’s
presence in U.N.O. “to deliver
the views of Great Britain on
the dispute between the Do-
minions of India and Pakistan
oyer the prized territory of
Kashmir,” it spoke of that new
Cabinet rank as “symbolising
the new concept of the Com-
monwealth, which is now offici-
ally defined by His Majesty’s
Government as' referring to all
Britannia, from the non-self-
governing territories, such as the
—Chicago "Tribune.”
THE ANGLER AND THE SCARECROW.
Gold Coast, to the fully
sovereign nations, such as
Canada.”
“The very fact,” it further
commented, “that such intra-
British disputes as that over
Kashmir and the South African-
Indian racial case are brought
before the United Nations, in-
stead of allowed to remain
solely within the diplomatic
purview of the British Com-
monwealth and the fact that the
United Kingdom continues to
restrict itself to such an objec-
tive role in the United Nations
on these issues emphasise the in-
tellectual independence, con-
tinually increasing, of each mem-
ber nation of the Common-
wealth. On the other hand, on
such fundamental issues as the
international control of atomic
energy and the terms of the
German and Japanese peace
treaties all the Dominions of the
Commonwealth are substantially
in full agreement. The develop-
ment of the old British Empire
into the new British Common-
wealth of Nations is a dynamic
political phenomenon that re-
affirms the historian’s faith in
the slow but just processes of
Anglo-Saxon democracy.”
Partition—or Oil.
The oil aspect of the Palestine
partition fiasco, referred to in a
Bulletin leader comment last
week, has been exposed by
“Christian Science Monitor”
Washington correspondent
Joseph C. Harsch, who gives an
interesting account of a curious
element in the policy-making.
Harsch reports that the U.S.
support of partition was “shaken
to the foundations by the unex-
pected failure of the Irak-British
Mutual Defence Treaty.” Till
then, Washington had been
“under the hopeful impression
that it could eat its Palestine
partition cake and at the same
time keep a reasonably well-
organised Arab world tied to
Britain by a network of defence
treaties”:
It was a delicate game, but it might
have worked. The British had held
back hard on the partition from the
beginning, and retained thereby
enough confidence among the Arab
countries to permit the assumption
that Britain might still be the power-
hub around which the Arab world
would revolve, and thus remain under
effective Western guidance while the
United States arranged for the par-
tition of Palestine.
The United States was to absorb
the resentment of the Arabs while
Britain acted for the West in holding
the Arabs in line.
But when the Iraki abandoned the
treaty with Britain it showed that the
Arabs had discovered the Achilles’
heel in American policy on Palestine.
The higher command of Arab strategy
against partition must have realised
that if it could break the British
system of alliances it would be strik-
ing indirectly but effectively against
the American policy.
For American military strategists
are of one mind on the vital import-
ance of Arabian oil. If Britain could
guarantee the continued flow of that
oil, then America could afford to in-
cur the resentment of the Arabs, But
if Britain could not guarantee the
flow of oil, then America could not,
in the opiniipn of the United States
military advisers, afford the luxury
of pushing partition through against
the bitter resentment of the Arabs.
That, Harsch declares, is why
Washington’s military advisers
were “lined up vigorously”
against the whole partition
policy. Their argument ran on
these lines: The effort to have
both partition and oil has failed.
Whatever the moral merits of
partition, and whatever the
practical political importance to
the Democratic party of the
Zionist vote, the flow of Arabian
oil is of the first importance to
the strategic security of the
United States.
The writer quotes the mili-
tary authorities as further argu-
ing that if the flow of oil was
blocked the cause of partition
was lost anyway, “since it
would be blocked by a ‘holy
war’ between Arabs and Jews
in the course of which the
Jewish stake in Palestine
would probably be wiped
out.” Further, if America were
to send armed forces into Pales-
tine to keep order, this would at
once involve the U.S, in war with
the Arab League, which would
also mean the end of the flow of
oil (in any case, they doubted if
American public opinion would
ever support such a use of
U.S. armed forces).
On all these grounds. Presi-
dent Truman’s military advisers
(who, as distinct from political
Washington, are said to have
been against partition all along)
strongly urged “an early and
complete reversal of the Ameri-
can position.” That that has
happened makes an ironical
comment on past American
policy (most unhelpful, and even
opposed, to Britain), and it is,
of course, a smashing blow to
the U.N.O. fa9ade.
In short, Palestine partition,
so far from being the “achieve-
ment” of Dr. Evatt’s eulogy,
has been U.N.O.’s worst blunder
to date.
Satellite Indigestion.
Happenings in Czechoslovakia,
particularly the suicide of
Masaryk, give point to conten-
tions that Soviet Russia will have
plenty of trouble trying to digest
the countries swallowed in its
imperialist expansion ; that there
must be strong oppositions in
all those countries, which will
increase their threat to the Soviet
control and would sharply make
their presence felt in the event
of war—in fact, that the Soviet
Communist apes in many coun-
tries are not the only fifth-
columns ready to spring up.
Many overseasi observers re-
garded the Czechoslovakia
moves as a sign of Soviet weak-
ness rather than strength ; aris-
ing from various fears, chief
among these the fear of Soviet
expansion aims being blocked
and the present expansion hold
loosened by the Marshall Plan
leading to recovery and revival
in Western Europe,
“In an economic war of ex-
haustion,” David Lawrence con-
tends in N. Y. “Sun,” “Russia
cannot succeed. The Western
democracies have more re-
sources and more ingenuity. The
risk rather is on the Russian
side, where the huge responsi-
bility and cost of subjugating
the Balkans and keeping her own
people obedient to the police
State is a venture of extraordi-
nary hazards”: —
Hitler was able to police Germany
because he dealt with a well-discip-
lined country, but nevertheless docu-
ments reveal that there were plots
going on all the time. It may be
assumed that the rulers of present-day
Russia wear their crowns somewhat
uneasily, too.
“The Russians,” Lawrence
holds, “have bitten off a big
chunk of trouble”;
Gradually, as liberties are taken
away, the undergrounds start organis-
ing. Troops will have to be used to
subdue the dynamic people of Czecho-
slovakia, who know how to fight for
their freedom. This means more ex-
pense for Russia and more difficulty
in keeping the people inside of Russia
from knowing the truth. If there’s
friction in a neighboring country,
sooner or later it gets across the
border.
A Washington correspondent
of N. Y. “Herald Tribune” ex-
presses the view, on much the
same grounds, that “the grind-
ing down of all Eastern Europe
into a mere disguised province
of the Soviet Union cannot en-
dure” :
One of its immediate effects will be
to drag the whole of Eastern Europe
down toward the Soviet level of life.
Another effect will be to place an im-
mensely greater strain on the Soviet
administrative machinery, and on the
Soviet secret police. If the United
States, therefore, perseveres in its
present policy, maintaining a steady,
calm but firm pressure on the Soviets
at all points, the Kremlin may be too
weak in the long run to maintain the
settlement they are now imposing.
“Then will be the time,” the
comment concludes, “to begin
negotiations for a real, not fake,
agreement between the Soviet
and the Western world.”
Dragnet Digest.
In a Presidential Year. —How
serious affairs had become when Mr.
Truman made his special address to
Congress on March 17 is made clear
enough by his own earlier statement
that “policies are hard to make in a
Presidential year.” What he had to
override was pointed out in advance
by David Lawrence’s comment in
N, Y. “Sun” that even if a genuine
crisis develops at this time “the Presi-
dent is likely to be accused of foment-
ing it for political purposes.” Agree-
ing that “certainly little can be done
in a Presidential year,” Lawrence then
expected that matters might “drift
along till after election, as happened
in 1916, and then a crisis develop im-
mediately after inauguration.” Hence
Mr. Truman’s speech gives particular
emphasis both to the seriousness of
the recent developments and to how
strong American feeling has been get-
ting.

Wanted, Zeal. —Dave Boone, quot-
ing in N. Y. “Sun” from a Congress

for its destruction.” And the British

Socialism v. Communism. —Acid
comment by William Henry Chamber-
lin in “Wall-street Journal” on the
much-boosted notion that Socialism is
a sound bulwark against Commun-
ism and not merely Communism-and-
water: “The experience of Czecho-
slovakia should deflate the reputations
of those reporters and political ob-
servers who brought back from quick
trips to Prague rosy tales of Czecho-
slovakia as a ‘bridge’ between West
and East, as a country that combined
Socialism and democracy. The in-
glorious role of some Czech Social
Democrats, such as Zdenek Fierlinger,
who were willing to serve as stooges
for the dominant Communists, should
inspire healthy scepticism about the
theory that Socialism offers the only

" Strike-bound Australia.’ 1 ’ How
open even the best of papers can be
to misinformation is indicated by a
N.Y. “Times” leader under that head-
ing. It commented: “The Queensland
Labor Government, backed by the
Federal authorities, proclaimed a state
of emergency, instructed police to
arrest all strike pickets, ordered
workers to return to duty on pain of
dismissal, and called up thousands of
other workers to take the place of the
strikers.” Well, hardly; particularly
the bit about the “Federal authori-
ties,” the wrongness of which gives
even stronger point to N. Y.
“Times’s” summing up: “One [of the
strike lessons] is that neither nationali-
sation nor the election of Labor Gov-
ernments is a guarantee against labor
troubles. Another is that any re-
sponsible Government, whether Labor
or not, is bound to put the interests
of the whole community above the
special interests of any part of it.
Perhaps the final lesson is that demo-
cratic processes can prevail only if all
those living in a democracy submit to
them.” And, it may be added, only
if “Federal authorities,” too, have
the courage to uphold them.

Sharing Marshall Dollars. —The
various countries’ requirements under
the Marshall Plan, as split up by
U.S. State Department: Great Britain
requires the lion’s share of the first-
aid appropriation. Its dollar needs
ending June 30 of next year total
$2,180,000,000. The dollar needs of
France and its dependencies for that
same period come next, $1,563,000,000.
Following Britain and France in order
of the magnitude of dollar aid needed
out of the first 15 months’ appro-
priation are: Western Germany,
$1,007,000,000; Italy, $977,000,000;
The Netherlands and dependencies,
$865,000,000; Belgium and Luxem-
burg, $519,000,000; Austria and
Greece, each $194,000,000; Denmark,
$192,000,000; Ireland, $151,000,000;
Norway, $90,000,000; Sweden,
$75,000,000; Portugal, $71,000,000;
Iceland, $12,000,000. During these
first 15 months Switzerland and Tur-
key are expected to put in, rather
than take out, of a European Re-
covery Programme kitty, $26,000,000
and $2,000,000 respectively.

MONEY. WORK AND PRICES.
“You shall not press down upon the
brow of labor this crown of thorns —
you shall not crucify mankind upon a
cross of gold!” So declaimed William
Jennings Bryan, Democrat candidate in
the 1896 United States Presidential elec-
tions. The Republic was still struggling
through the world-wide depression of the
’nineties, and, as is usual during depres-
sions, a section of the people insisted
that the basic trouble was an inadequate
supply of currency; with them the gold
standard was in disrepute, and the call,
led by Bryan, was for “free silver,” cir-
culating at a fixed price in relation to
gold. America was still at a stage where
it envied Britain’s industrial strength, and
many of its citizens distrusted the Bank
of England’s high regard for gold. A
flood of silver currency as legal tender,
it was believed, would give prices the
boost that the United States economy
then so obviously lacked. •_
“Tens of millions of people continued
to feel the pinch of hard times,” records
a historian of the period. “In American
cities many men still sought work in vain
and were dependent upon charity for the
wherewithal to sustain themselves and
their families. Western farmers and their
wives and children worked longer hours,
yet could not sell their wheat and corn,
their hogs and cattle, for enough to meet
expenses and pay the interest on the
mortgage.” The producer was faced with
stagnant markets and falling prices for
his output; but the silver oratory of
Bryan failed to win the Presidency for
the Democrats.
Recovery arrived without free silver;
then came the petroleum age. World War
I and the hectic prosperity (for the U.S.A.)
of the nineteen-twenties. Depression fol-
lowed on the heels of an inflationary
price boom, and Franklin Roosevelt, in
an attempt to restore prices, devalued the
dollar to the extent of taking 40 cents-
worth of gold out of it. He introduced
his New Deal, with its heavy Government
expenditure on re-employment and
“controls” which blunted the edge of free
enterprise. But nothing really restored
U.S. price-levels until World War II
broke upon the world, prompting enor-
mous Government expenditure and huge
demands upon manpower and materials.
You can no longer exchange a tqn-
dollar bill for gold coin in the United
States. Legal tender has become paper
money; and during the recent war the
creation of paper money and “book
credit” in America was on a vast scale.
Britain, Australia and most other coun-
tries had long preceded the United States
in conserving their gold stocks (such as
they were), and then the war stimulated
huge paper-money creation in British
countries as well.
There are many people in the world
today, mostly consumers, wondering when
prices—which to them are living costs —
are going to come down. There are
many more, including President Truman,
other statesmen and politicians, econo-
mists, businessmen and farmers, who are
wondering with varied emotions as to
when prices—into which wage-costs
enter in the case of manufactured
goods are really going to stop
going up. The problem of the house-
wife is file conundrum of statesmen, the
farmer and “big business,” though each
may view it from a different angle. A big
fall in wheat and wool prices with no
reduction in other costs would only in-
crease the complexities of the position.
It is 52 years since Bryan stood for the
U.S. Presidency. This year another
Democrat, President Truman, will stand
for re-election. But his call to the U.S.
people is strikingly different from that of
Bryan. He has asked for restraint by the
consuming public, for the restriction of
credit, for the allocation of scarce
materials to essential work, for the con-
trol of rising prices and for a curb on the
export of goods a scarcity of which on
the home market might cause further
price-inflation. Truman, in short, is
afraid that prices have been going too
high, costs may go higher, and is aware
that there are no reserves of unemployed
with which to increase production im-
mediately, “Western farmers” and their
families don’t have to “work long hours,”
and yet returns from “their wheat and
com, their hogs and their cattle,’ ’are
meeting all expenses, paying the mort-
gage interest comfortably, and leaving
enough over to add to the Republic’s
inflated spending-power. Impoverished
and disrupted Europe is clamoring for
U.S. goods, farm-products and otherwise.
The recent recession in wheat prices has
not noticeably affected other items.
“We are suffering the consequences
today of an excessively swollen money-
supply, which neither bankers individu-
ally nor Government authorities have ade-
quate means at present of controlling,”
said Marriner S. Eccles, chairman of the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board, in an
authoritative report. His suggested
remedy was, as a start, a reduction of
Federal Government expenditure, some-
thing which President Truman, as a poli-
tician, has been less inclined to advocate.
These are the days of paper-money
“prosperity” within the “economics of
scarcity.” After more than a half-
century’s political assault, often intem-
perate, against the gold standard, which
fixed the “price” of gold in paper money
and gave silver, as currency, only a
token value, the world generally has
arrived at a stage where gold’s influence
has been largely legislated out of action ;
credit and paper money are no longer of
necessity directly tied to a gold anchor
—nor to a silver one.
Today we have money that relies for
its value upon the national productivity.
This is what currency theorists have de-
manded for the past 25 years. But,
bluntly, world productivity, as represented
by millions of producers, is letting cur-
rency down. The let-down has happened
in France particularly, also in Britain and
the United States as well as in the Com-
monwealth ; but in no English-speaking
country has there been a greater failure
by trade-unionists to maintain their out-
put of goods and services and so up-
hold living standards than in Australia.
They are getting more paper money in
wages than they ever received before, but
they are producing less in return. Thus
prices and the cost of living are going up ;
the value —buying-power—of money is
still going down.
Australian wage-earners now have poli-
tical privileges they never enjoyed before,
and are entitled to a greater share of
the national production—whatever it
amounts to. Money and credit policy are
more a Government, and hence a
political, matter than they have ever been,
and the volume of money and credit is
equated with the need for keeping “em-
ployment” full in a way never previously
seen. There are jobs for all.
Instead of a, metallic governor of
credit volume we have this political one ;
the Canberra Government bases the
volume on the political necessity for keep-
ing payrolls full, on its socialistic aspira-
tions in the industrial and transport fields,
and on demand for public “works” (often
misjudged). Hence the vulnerability of
our economic stability to Communist
domination of key trade-unions, from
which “Labor” Caucus takes its orders.
Temporarily, anyway, most world Gov-
ernments have tried to dispose of the
“tyranny of the gold standard”; when
Lord Keynes was asking the British
people to accept the Bretton Woods plan
he had to assure them —possibly not in
complete sincerity—that it was not the
gold standard in a new disguise. But the
acceptance by people instead of a
“managed” currency must of necessity
place them in the hands of the managers ;
and in Australia at present that includes
the whole of the “Labor” movement, with
its Communist industrial saboteurs well
to the fore, and its sophistical “yoomani-
tarians” almost equally influential. The
politically-bedevilled Federal Treasury,
on the one hand, decides upon the size
of the Budget, the tax and loan policy,
the “full-employment” allocations, and
the credit volume generally; the trade-
union hierarchy sets out to implement its
own plans of higher wages, a shorter
working week and lower production per
man-hour.
Since 1939 the volume of paper-money
savings of Australians has expanded
by 150 p.c. In order to stabilise
prices it is necessary to bring pro-
duction up to the point where it will
be freely and profitably exchanged for
present wage-earnings and past savings
without subsidies, “controls” or subter-
fuge. Nothing like that production or
stability has been achieved. The
national call, then, is for greater produc-
tion—for a fair day’s work for fair pay.
Otherwise the disparity between money-
creation and commodity-production will
widen, with prices still being loaded in
order to balance the scales.
The evil in our monetary system today
is this inflationary weakness, which is
being extended persistently by Com-
munist treachery and by trade-union
foolocracy. People in Australia who
hope for cheaper houses, motor-cars,
furniture, food and clothing will wait in
vain unless trade-unionism turns away
from its treacherous advisers, rubs free
from parasitical barnacles and decides to
do itself and the nation a good turn by
really earning its pay in ample pro-
duction. We and many other coun-
tries have dragged our gold-standard
anchors for what has been held out to be
a more scientific and “human” economic
system. But the “system,” “scientific”
and all as it may be, is in for a horrible
collapse eventually unless political and
industrial integrity adequately replaces
the ancient —almost superstitious —metal-
lic anchor. Never has the principle of a
fair day’s work for fair pay had greater
democratic significance.
A Whale of a Jonah.
Easter came and went with the hearing
of the Bank Grab case unfinished after
33 days. Dr. Evatt himself spoke for 17
days, morning and afternoon, putting the
case for and answering the case against
the constitutionality of the Grab. In sub-
stance, he claimed validity as an exercise
of legislative power for the proposed im-
position on a people wholly unprepared
for it and at least 70 per cent, hostile.
Exclusive of citations, the Attorney-
General got half a million words off his
chest and finished as if the task had been
a pleasure. But then he and his crowd
are never happier than when dividing the
nation and waging forms of war on the
part that rejects its European socialism
and, with the Auditor-General’s annual
reports as documentary evidence, con-
siders them incapable of running a sand-
wich shop, let alone a continent-wide
banking system with overseas agencies.
Just as their Communist proteges are
never happier than when careering
through their industrial laws and foreign
policy and waging forms of war on the
whole people.
The doctor’s self-imposed assignment
in the High Court prevented his attend-
ing to his duties in the House. Though
the foreign situation was increasingly
bad —worse than during any previous
three weeks since the Japanese, following
the Germans, laid down their arms—and
though before the debates petered out the
Waterside Workers’ Federation, repudiat-
ing its engagements under his fancy
“streamlined” arbitration, had joined the
Seamen’s Union in the wicked blockade of
Queensland —one of the effects, of malig-
nant design, has been a vast holdup of
food for Britain, as well as a total stop-
page of trade and commerce with other
States —he didn’t appear at Canberra for
a single hour. He was “represented” only
on the last sitting-day and that by one
of those printed statements on interna-
tional affairs, generally tabled too late
for discussion, in which he treats Parlia-
ment and people with contempt. No
British Foreign Secretary, even in quiet
times, would dare to fob off the House of
Commons with a printed statement and
then refuse it the right of debate ; but
this has become Evatt practice, and the
practice is detestable.
In the latest of these communications-
per-compositor there was some sorry
stuff. One of several examples:
The prospect of the speedy passage
through Congress of the Marshall-Plan
legislation is not very hopeful.
Two days after newspaper publication
was given to this stuff the Senate
passed the legislation by 69 votes to 17,
and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
House has since unanimously recom-
mended it to that Chamber. So its
“speedy passage,” of which the “prospect”
or the doctor was “not very hopeful,” is
as certain as anything in human affairs
can be.
In another part of the “report to Par-
liament” the author gave the U.N.O.
Assembly credit for “effective decisions,”
mentioning in particular “the unanimous
resolution condemning warmongering,
the establishment of commissions for
Greece and Korea and the partition of
Palestine.” It goes without saying that
he had a hand in all three. But in view
of the Communist conquest of the Czechs
and Slovaks, the Communist effort, still in
bloody and destructive operation, to
conquer the Greeks, “the unanimous reso-
lution against warmongering” is not worth
a rush. And the commission “for Korea”
stands exposed as worse than a dud—the
Russians boycotted it and the Americans
protest bitterly that the Australian and
Canadian delegates have by their per-
formances made an always-difficult job
doubly difficult, especially Dr. Evatt’s
nominee:
These two delegates are doing all they
can to block debate and action on and
preparation of a people who have never
voted, the people of South Korea [Ameri-
can zone], for elections in May. From the
first the Australian delegate has excitedly
shouted that South Korea is “an American
police State,” though after three months
the commission cannot name one Korean
who has been imprisoned in the United
States zone.
Which recalls what Mr. Paul Hasluck
said, explaining his resignation as “Coun-
sellor Australian Mission at U.N.O.
Headquarters and Temporary Represen-
tative Security Council”;
Reluctantly I was forced to the opinion
that the present Minister wishes to make
the diplomatic staff and the staff of Ex-
ternal Affairs his own personal possession.
I do not wish to have any place in a
service of that kind, [a service with] a
passion for doing something on every
occasion without enough concern over what
is best and doing it at the right time;
with a tendency to thump tables, to in-
trude into other people’s affairs and to
ignore consideration of other people’s honor
or the tenderness of other people’s corns.
There has also been a sort of larrikin
strain in Australian foreign policy; a dis-
position to throw stones at the street lights
just because they are bright. It is not a
habit that helps the general illumination.
Mr. Hasluck handsomely allowed that
“Australian foreign policy” had a way of
“changing its plumage in mid-flight.”
As it did in Japan when Dr. Evatt went
there—to the confusion of Mr. Mac-
mahon Ball, who had joined the Soviet
representative in the pleasant pastime of
sniping at General MacArthur and who,
the “plumage” changed, threw up his job
and returned, like Mr. Hasluck. He
doesn’t seem to have ever got over the
shock.
As for the “effective” Palestine “de-
cision” it has been abandoned by the
country which would in the main have
had the policing of it, at least at the
beginning, though Australia, committed by
Dr. Evatt to the “effective decision” and
to the setting-up of “ah international
police force,” could not have refused its
share of the certain bloody sacrifice with-
out dishonor. This being a Presidential-
election year, with the Jewish vote power-
ful in the cities, especially New York, the
U.S. Government’s support for partition
is understandable, and so is its change
of front. After contemplating the
atrocities committed on both sides, and
by both against the British, it had to
make another choice, the choice dictated
by high policy and humanity alike, and
made it. To persevere with the “effective
decision” would have meant losing
Arabian oil when home supplies are
shrinking fast, taking a war with the Arab
race in a region where terrorism has be-
come as endemic as the diseases that
have plagued the land since time im-
memorial, and perhaps furnishing a fine
battlefield for the Russians.
But why should Australia have rushed
in where Britain, for reasons manifold,
some written in blood, refused to tread?
What Australian policy could be served,
what Australian interest promoted, by
siding with Jews, nearly all from Europe,
and two bands of which have erected the
murder of men of our race into a system?
What principle of international law could
warrant the violent expulsion from their
ancient land of people who have been
there since the dawn of history and were
there for many centuries when there was
not a Jew in the pl^ce?
No such principle exists, nor any other
principle on which partition can be
morally based. It is just another case of
Dr. Evatt’s dissociating this country from
British policy, as he does when the fit
seizes him.
The doctor has been at that nasty
game ever since he went to San Francisco
in 1945 and posed provocatively as a
champion of “the small nations” —hence,
among the nasty consequences, the recent
gasconading of Chile and Guatemala. He
played it when he alleged that Britain
had tried to elbow Australia out of the
Japanese-surrender ceremony, all the
arrangements for which were in General
MacArthur’s hands; when he gate-
crashed the Foreign Ministers’ conference
in London; when he tried to butt into
the Trieste business (“Evatt Has a Plan”);
when he ignominiously connived at the
Communists’ war of blockade on J. Bull’s
good friends (each with sacred
memories of Arnhem) the Dutch; when
he set up Ministers and consuls in coun-
tries with which Australia has no poli-
tical connections and does no trade; aml
when, with British resistance to Moscow
beginning, he said that Russian policy,
which reached its climax at Prague, was
dictated by self-preservation and “security
against future attack.” By sins of coni'
mission and omission he has done more
than any other map to give Moscow and
its agents the impression that the British
Commonwealth is a house divided and
Australia a prize for the taking.
Indeed the road this politician has
travelled since he became Attorney-
General and Minister of External Affairs
is strewn with the wrecks of his foreign
and domestic policies. Among the
wreckage are feathers from the “plumage”
so often “changed in mid-flight” and a
profusion of waste-paper; constitutional
convention programmes, referendum
pamphlets, “streamlined”-arbitration en-
actment —the fruits of which, rotten for
taxpayers and other enforced contri-
butors, are £l5OO-a-year life jobs for re-
tired or defeated “Labor” politicians and
other Trades Hall worthies, attendance-
money for slow-motipn wharflaborers
and fees for their Communist boss,
Healy, and the Communist boss of the
Seamen’s Union —and above all, the ex-
plicit pledge he gave when removing the
ban on the Communists, that he would rc-
impose it if they didn’t behave. In all
these matters, and others, no. good has
come of anything he has touched. He
has been successful only in pushing his
own barrow, and in the end he will fail
in that.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Runners All.
Not all the fast-time fellows took their
running-shoes to Stawell (Vic.) for the
Easter Gift.
Among the missing was one of the
Communist Healys, the wharflaborers’
Federal secretary and representative on
the Evatt-created Stevedoring Industry
Commission at so much a sitting. At a
Sydney meeting of the Commission
Healy boasted that “notwithstanding any
commission order or any law” his concern
“still intends to defy the Queensland
Government and see that no cargo is
moved in or out of Queensland.” The
ruffian was next seen in Brisbane, show-
ing himself in “the bloody struggle” which
lasted 45 seconds, and in which Paterson,
M.L.A., was bumped on the bean, prob-
ably by an overwrought “picket” or by
an infuriated opponent of intimidation by
“picketing,” and was alleged to have
suffered all the head wounds listed in
army medical journals till the “diagnosis”
could not be sustained.
With four other wharflaborers’ officials
and two members of the rank and file,
Healy was charged by the Brisbane police
with having taken part in an unauthorised
procession. Hearing of his case having
been adjourned, he bolted back to Syd-
ney. From that city he caused it to be
announced through the A.B.C. news
service (“Calwell’s Own”) that he wouldn’t
be present at the court proceedings, and
he wasn’t. In his absence he and the
other accused were fined £lO or a month.
Nothing about contempt of Court in his
case. The magistrate indulgently accepted
an “apology” on his behalf from the
Communist lawyer Julius, who has him-
self been throwing his weight about.
Another absentee from Court proceed-
ings was the A.E.U. Communist Rowe,
from Melbourne. He was charged with
contempt of the Industrial Court in hav-
ing interfered with a Court-authorised
strike ballot of his engineers. Having
ascertained that the engineers were vot-
ing 20 to 1 for a return to work, Rowe
ordered the destruction of as many un-
marked ballot-papers as he could get
hold of, referring to them in the jargon
of his gang as “papers for a ballot run
by a boss’s stooge,” Remarking on his
having made himself scarce, Crown
counsel said “This man is just staying
away and flouting the Court.” “Very
gross contempt!” observed Justice Mat-
thews. “Rowe stands committed to jail
till further notice. He is also fined £6O
with £3l 10s. costs, and will remain in
jail till these amounts are paid.”
But Rowe was already on the move
with the utmost speed. Three days after
he should have surrendered to justice.
Communists boasted in Sydney that they
knew where he was but the capitalist
police couldn’t catch him, nor would any
capitalist policeman do so “until the
‘strategy’ of the disputes committee in
Queensland is clarified and it is thought
Rowe’s presence would be an asset.”
“Strategy,” “sanctions,” “blockade” —all
military terms, and all, and more, used
by Communists in their war on the Aus-
tralian people and in their open contempt
for Australian la,ws and Courts. In no
circumstances can the fugitive be an
“asset.” He earned the contempt of a
multitude of dupes on his own side, as
well as that of all opponents of his gang
who respect courage, by running away.
Another Communist who bolted,
though not from the police, was Williams,
general president of the Miners’ Federa-
tion. Learning that the Queensland coal-
miners were sick of their part in a hopeless
strike, Williams went round among them
urging them to stand firm and bringing
the glad tidings that a general coal strike
was in the offing. At Booval this
Johnny-come-lately was “booed when he
rose to speak” and was heckled till he
sat down. Reduced to whining, he
whined “They tell us we are not pro-
ducing enough coal.” “And, by cripes,
they’re right!” a miner roared.
By a resounding majority the Queens-
land miners decided to go back to the
pits, and this they did. The crestfallen
Williams did not wait to preside over or
witness any of these ceremonies. He
sped back to Sydney, where even the
forcible-feeble “Rowley” James, M.H.R.,
had turned against him and his gang.
Straightway it was announced that there
would be no general strike nor even a
one-day stoppage.” The mood of the
N.S.W. miners had changed so much,
and so ominously for Williams and the
Communist conspiracy in general, that
their output for two days was their best
this year.
Absent from Stawell also were other
sprinters of note: Ben Chifley, Bert
Evatt, E. J. Holloway and Arthur Cal-
well. Their forte is, of course, running
away from their responsibilities as Minis-
ters of the Crown. In this branch of
footwork they are all champions, and
any relay-race put on for politicians pf
their kidney they would win by at least
a lap.
Goldberg and Friend.
Nothing more has been heard in this
office from the Sydney solicitors for
Joseph Goldberg, self-styled “very dear
friend” of Trade and Customs Minister
Keane, who died in the U.S.A. on April
27, 1946. As here related (B. 21 /1 / ’4B),
the legal firm had received “instructions
to require” that The Bulletin “publish
in suitable form a retraction of” alleged
“suggestions” as to “delay in the hearing
of the appeal” against Goldberg’s con-
viction (April 11, 1947) on a charge of
importing prohibited goods. Goldberg
had been brought to book by the Customs
in November, 1946.
According to the solicitors “our client
had nothing to do with the delay.” The
Bulletin quoted Minister Holloway:
“All the delay caused from April 11 to
October 14 was due to the wishes of Mr.
Goldberg’s counsel.” That was said on
November 6, 1947. During the short pre-
Easter session of the House, which
petered out strangely, Mr. Holloway re-
iterated that “hearing of the appeal lodged
by the representatives of Mr. Goldberg
has been held up largely because they
themselves were not ready to proceed.”
Meantime The Bulletin published no
“retraction,” nor did it receive a writ.
There follows a condensed account of
Melbourne “Herald’s” report of proceed-
ings in the N.S.W. Full Court. The
“Herald,” it should be said in common
justice, maintains the old reporting
" IF I KEEP ON PLAYING HIS TUNE HE MIGHTN'T BITE .”
standards, as do the London “Times”
and the Manchester “Guardian.” Not
being racing-mad, the “Herald” often
gives ampler reports of Sydney affairs
of interest to the whole Common-
wealth than any of the Sydney dailies.
So this is from the “Herald”:
Joseph Goldberg, of York-street, Syd-
ney, manufacturer, appealed in the State
Full Court against a conviction an.l a fine
of £250 for having imported prohibited
goods.
Mr. Ferguson, K.C. (for Goldberg), said
there was evidence that Goldberg had been
asked by the late Senator Keane to arrange
the purchase of articles for Mrs. Keane
while they were in America, but there was
no evidence that Goldberg imported the
goods.
Goldberg had travelled on the same ship
with Senator and Mrs. Keane in March,
1946, and had stayed at the same hotel in
Washington.
Senator Keane had given Goldberg 3000
dollars with which to buy goods, but the
amount was insufficient and Goldberg had
used some of his own money to complete
the purchases.
Another 1350 dollars, and “more,” it
was said at the Federal Court hearing,
and that without asking Mrs. Keane for
the difference. Evidence of this was all
“secondary,” as the lawyers say, for
neither Goldberg nor Mrs. Keane, nor yet
Miss Kelly, presently to be mentioned,
were called as witnesses.
The “Herald” report again:
In May, 1946, after Senator Keane’s death
in Washington, Goldberg had been handed
a letter by Senator Keane’s secretary, W. T.
Kirk, for delivery to R. F. Kerr, San Fran-
cisco representative of Australian War Sup-
plies Procurement. The letter had requested
Kerr to arrange for the shipment of pur-
chases for Mrs. Keane.
Mr. Ferguson said Kerr told Goldberg:
“That will be easy, because Miss Rosetta
Kelly will be leaving for Australia on the
Monterey.” Miss Kelly was secretary to the
Director-General of the Australian War
Supplies Procurement Branch in Washing-
ton.
Four trunks with labels bearing Senator
Keane’s name had accompanied Miss
Kelly’s luggage to Sydney and were de-
clared as belonging to Mrs. Keane. Gold-
berg, he added, had had nothing further to
do with the matter. Mr. J. W. Shand,
K.C. for the Crown, said there was ample
evidence to support the contention that
Goldberg had not obtained a licence for
the goods.
Chief Justice Jordan: I cannot see why
he should have bothered his head about
securing a licence for any goods but his
own.
Mr. Shand said it was claimed that the
goods, consisting mainly of artificial jewel-
lery, were for trade purposes, in which
Senator Keane and Goldberg were con-
cerned.
Justice Street said there was little doubt
the goods were brought into the country
for trade, but the question was who was
responsible.
Mr. Shand said Goldberg must have been
aware something was wrong because he
told a Customs inspector Miss Kelly was as
“innocent as a babe,” after he was in-
formed that, in the inspector’s opinion, she
had been used as a tool to smuggle goods
into Australia.
This report ends with the words “Judg-
ment was reserved.” These words inhibit
comment on the actual Court proceed-
ings, but they should not restrain Parlia-
ment from going into the question of
Keane’s part in the transaction. On the
face of it, when a dollar famine was
approaching, Keane, a union-secretary-
turned-politician, had dollars to burs.
When required by all decent Ministerial
traditions to devote himself scrupulously
to the duties of his office, he engaged in
a deal from which, abusing his privilege
as a Minister, he hoped to derive private
gain. “Goldberg said that, before the
Senator’s death they”—Goldberg and
Keane—“were going into business,” hav-
ing “obtained an agency in Australia to
sell jewellery.” That is from the “Truth”
report of a Customs man’s evidence, as
read to the Full Court.
It is nothing to the purpose that Keane
cannot now testify on his own behalf.
Dead or alive, a Minister of the Crown
must be above suspicion. Beyond all
question Keane’s administration, which
has been under a cloud for 18 months,
should be the subject of a Parliamentary
debate, followed by a select-committee
inquiry, with Goldberg, Mrs. Keane and
Miss Kelly among the witnesses, which
will end in his name being blighted or
cleared.
Appeal to History.
From The Bulletin of March 29, 1939 :
History is a great comfort in times like these.
In 1812 the Napoleonic empire included, be-
sides France, the Low Countries, Spain, Italy,
Switzerland (virtually) and Dalmatia, and all
Germany, Poland and Lithuania were under
Bonaparte’s thumb. Within two years his
empire had collapsed and he was a prisoner
in Elba.
In May, 1918, the armies of the Hohenzol-
lerns and the Hapsburgs were in Belgium,
northern France, northern Italy, Yugoslavia,
Rumania, Poland, the Ukraine, Finland and
the Baltic provinces, and Russia proper was
at their mercy. By the second week in Novem-
ber they were beaten fugitives.
Let the story of dictatorial conquests
be brought up to date:
At the end of 1942 Hitler’s legions and their
allies were in full control of France, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Czechoslo-
vakia, Italy, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, Yugo-
slavia, Greece, the Baltic provinces, the Ukraine
and White Russia. They were besieging Lenin-
grad, were within striking distance of Moscow
and had reached the Volga. In North Africa
they were thrusting towards the Suez Canal.
Within 30 months they had lost everything,
including their own empires, and Hitler and
Mussolini were dead.
In March, 1948, Stalin was predominant in
Finland, the Baltic States, Poland, Rumania,
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Albania, and
had hopes of overcoming France, Italy and
Greece. In Asia his forces were back in Port
Arthur and Dairen and were threatening the
complete conquest of Manchuria, Korea and
China, as well as menacing Persia and Turkey.
But his internal situation is so bad that he
has been reduced to revaluing the currency—in
effect, robbing peasants and workers of roubles
they had .banked and hoarded. And, at 69,
and no successor in sight, his bluff has been
called by the democratic nations which, without
America, worsted Napoleon and, with America,
encompassed the swift defeat of the Kaiser and
the Emperor Karl.
Yes, history is a great comfort these
times and at all times. Dictators may
prosper for a time, but their conquests,
however achieved, never last.
An Odd Strike.
A short time ago the nation was dis-
turbed to learn that its business was to be
held up because a Melbourne wharfie
couldn’t get a beer for lunch. There
have been other industrial upsets of
a similar nature. Beer appeared to occupy
a sacred place in public affairs —almost
as sacred as betting—a fact which more
than one sojourner from overseas has
commented upon with amazement. When
a brewery strike ip Sydney cut off the
flood of beer to about a third of Aus-
tralia’s population the daily papers were
perhaps justified in greeting it with bold
posters and black headlines. No super-
ficial observer could have been blamed
for expecting some sort of a revolution.
Nothing happened. There were no hur-
ried Cabinet-meetings, no demonstrations,
no riots, no marches on the breweries.
People discovered that they could really
get along without the stuff, had more
money to spare, got home earlier, had
more time for the garden. Wharflumpers
who struck about sugar-slings on the day
the brewery strike occurred went back
to work three days later, having nothing
else to do. Bosses all over the place dis-
covered absenteeism reduced, the police
announced in pleased astonishment that
crime had fallen off, accidents were fewer,
Sydney, crowded for the Easter festivi-
ties, became a quieter and more decorous
city, even allowing for spirit- and plonk-
drinkers. It is true that a poet or two
lamented (e.g., “T. the R.,” page 17); that
here and there a few fellows hung about
semi-deserted pubs with a lost and
puzzled expression, but presently they,
too, went home or to work or to some
secluded spot to weep for days that,
temporarily at any rate, were no more.
Meantime the strikers, obviously baffled
by this astonishing public reaction,
presently came to realise that, for the
most part, people were ge.tting used to
having no beer, and they savagely decided
to attack teetotallers and small-boys. The
breweries also make aerated waters* —
lemonade, ginger-ale, kola and so forth.
The disputes committee sternly ordered
that none of these things were to be car-
ried from the breweries. And the people,
invited to contemplate the dreadful spec-
tacle of a temperance advocate gasping
for a lemonade or a small-boy deter-
minedly pouring milk-shakes into himself
because kola was “black,” didn’t turn a
hair. Nor were they shaken when told
that the Federal and State Treasurers'
were to lose £1,000,000 and £20,000 in
excise and licence fees respectively. The
drought-stricken taxpayers plainly didn’t
care tuppence how much the Treasurers
lost, or even if the Treasurers lost them-
selves.
The brewery strikers have done a
serious thing. By cutting off the beer
flood they have forced large numbers of
people to take an interest in things out-
side the realm of malt and hops.
Pines and Postage-stamps.
From “Mutineer”: —
On Norfolk Island we number fewer than
900 people. We are an Australian external
territory, and our Minister is Mr. E. J. Ward.
We haven’t a vote, and we don’t pay income
tax. But we are controlled —of course —by an
Administrator. A Mr. Alex Wilson, he was
once Independent M.H.R. for Wimmera, but
lost his independence back in 1941 when, in
company with a Mr. Arthur Coles, he voted
the Fadden Government out and the Curtin
Government in. Both gentlemen subsequently
withdrew from politics, Mr. Coles to the Ration-
ing Commission and Mr. Wilson —political de-
feat facing him —to us. Mr. Wilson has been
our Administrator for 21 years; he has 4±
to run, having been appointed for seven years,
though previous incumbents had to be content
with five years. For our part, if the Wimmera
people want Mr. Wilson back, they’re welcome.
As Administrator, Mr. Wilson is supposed
to be guided by our elected Advisory Council,
which numbers eight. All islanders and all
elected by islanders, the Council can be assumed
to know what the people want. But the Council
is so tired of receiving the stock reply to its
recommendations —“This does not meet with
the approval of the Minister” —that it has
almost given up offering advice. We lost our
magistrate. The Council advised appointment
of a visiting S.M., but was ignored. Our
policeman has left us. We are dissatisfied with
the distribution of wire-netting and petrol and
kerosene supplies under the Administrator’s
arrangements. Under a new monopoly we now,
pay higher prices for petrol, kero, and diesel
oil, all essential, and half the time there is no
kero., though refrigerators, stoves and lighting-
plants depend upon it.
The big grouch is about finance. The Council
asked the Administrator three times for a
statement of accounts. He gave it, asking that
it be not made public. The Council refused
to keep it secret. It reveals high proposed
expenditure from precarious revenue: —
Salaries, 1946-47 (beginning with the Ad-
ministrator’s, £1150), £7915; estimate for
1947-48, £10,043. Estimated revenue, 1947-
48, £50,720 (last year £39,157); expen-
diture, £42,460; surplus, £8260. Chief
items of revenue: Commonwealth grant,
£4000; sale of liquor, £7500; Cus-
toms, £4000; special philatelic sales of
postage-stamps when N.I. was given its
own post-office, £27,500. Chief expenses:
Salaries, £10,043; repairs, maintenance and
upkeep of Government buildings, £2300;
stores and equipment, £5000; liquor, £5000;
roads, £4000; landing-places, £5700; other
public works, £500; Administration trans-
port, £400; new hospital (there isn’t one),
£3000; hospital subsidy, £1045. Total

estimated expenditure, £42,460, compares
with £26,624 in 1946-47.
Most of us are optimists, but we can’t believe
that the Island is to continue getting £27,500
a year from postage-stamps, since that comes
from philatelists for a special issue, and
ordinary postal revenue for 1947-48 is put
at £1750. But the future doesn’t seem to
bother Mr. Ward or Mr. Wilson, one from
the “lott’ry” and tin-hare “Labor” State of
N. S. Wales, and the other the political father
of the Commonwealth Bank’s rural mortgage
department.
POLITICAL POINTS
With Communist “leaders” on the run,
and some of them digging into union
bank balances for fines and costs, the
Queensland strike entered on its last
phase. The coalminers had gone back,
after exposing Williams, their president
from Wales, via Victoria, for the poor
creature he is. It needed only the flight
of the unspeakable Rowe, who came from
Melbourne, to convince even strikers that
the Commo cause was lost. Deserted, as
he was, by Chifley and McGirr, Hanlon
has had the satisfaction of demonstrat-
ing what he saw clearly from the begin-
ning that most Australian unionists re-
spect industrial law and will support any-
one willing to enforce it.
P. J. Clarey, M.L.C., ex-Minister and
president of the A.C.T.U., which con-
demned Hanlon’s anti-intimidation law,
flew to Brisbane with King, M.L.C.,
from Sydney, an A.C.T.U. vice-president,
and saw Hanlon, Sent away with a flea
in his ear, Clarey flew back to Melbourne
in time to tell the Victorian A.L.P.
Easter conference that Communists were
bad medicine and that he, as an A.L.P.
boss, had no use for them. “Too little,
too late.”
The exploded Shinwell, now Secretary
for War, holds that “Britain must never
cease to seek an understanding with
Russia.. . .If we could only realise the
horror of future war no measure would
be too strong to prevent it.” There’s
only one measure that will stop a fellow
who threatens to come after you with a
club. Let him see you’ve a bigger club.
“Down in the forest something stirred.”
From the C.P.’s Murrumbidgee and
Riverina electorate councils comes this
resolution for the annual conference in
Sydney this week:
That a Federal Convention be instituted
on an elected basis to completely review
the Federal Constitution in the light of 50
years’ experience, giving particular attention
to the question of new States and greater
local autonomy.
And from New England, apropos of the
Bank Grab;
That there be an amendment to the Con-
stitution to provide for a referendum on
any proposed law on receipt of a petition,
signed by five per cent, of the electors or
by the Parliaments of any three States.
These country chaps have too much time
to think.
An important aspect of Hanlon’s vic-
tory over the Communist wreckers in
Queensland is the impression it will make
on the British Government, concerned
as it is with food production, and the
British people interested in opencut coal-
mining and other plans for Queensland
development. The examples they are
setting are sure to be followed now that
the Premier has proved himself a solid
man. McGirr, who breaks into a cold
sweat every time he hears a Communist
roar, is addicted to bragging that his
State is attracting more British capital
than “all the rest put together.” Of this
there is no evidence, though there is any
amount of evidence that McGirrism is a
compound of skite and scare.
The St. Patrick’s Day Cup at Ballarat
was won by Uncle Jote. In the St.
Patrick’s Day Cup at Brisbane, foisted
on the programme by Communists, Uncle
Joe was a bad second in a field of two.
S. M. Keon, M.L.A. for Richmond,
to the Victorian A.L.P. conference:
It is regrettable, when, the nations
are on the point of being plunged into a
third World War, that a delegate should
state that people who oppose Communism
are suffering from a phobia. I should like
to have the views of Jan Masaryk and
others in Czechoslovakia on that Calwellian
doctrine.
For the “delegate” was Calwell, Calwell,
who posed as an anti-Communist before
he became a Minister —indeed he was
denounced as such by Thornton, of “I
hope the scabs of Downing-street will
be defeated” notoriety—and closed a
period of crawling by getting a passport
for Sharkey to visit reluctant India, where
Sharkey undertook that his crowd would
bring down the White Australia policy.
Keon, again;
If delegates do not make their attitude
clear we may as well not waste time and
money campaigning for the Chifley Gov-
ernment.
Calwell tried to bluster his way out of
the question —in vain.
It is too early to gay that Truman has
lost the Presidential election because his
Government has abandoned the partition
of Palestine. In America, as in Aus-
tralia, a great many Jews never liked the
Zionist business and feared that forcing
of partition would lead to a wholesale
slaughter of their race. What is against
Truman is that' he demanded the im-
mediate introduction of 100,000 European
Jews into Palestine when Bevin had high
hopes of bringing about an Arab-Jew
compromise. But the Republicans will
have to go easy in cultivating the Jewish
interest in New York lest they provoke
the Gentiles into polling an overpowering
anti-Jewish vote.
The latest about dollars is that they
are going out so fast that Australia may
have to get along with its dollar earn-
ings without dipping into the Empire
pool. What a consoling thought it is that
Ward, Calwell, Amour, Daly, the Gold-
bergs and the Parrys and the rest had
their dollar excursions before the
approaching famine dawned on Chifley!
An incident of the Easter racing was
the imposition of special charges on S.A.
racecourse bookmakers who bet on races
in other States. They were, of course,
“up in arms” —if bookmakers are ever up
in arms except to lift drinks. Betting on
races in other States is of doubtful
legality, in any event, and that every-
where. All States would be better with-
out it, since it serves only to fill the bags
of parasites with the offerings of mugs.
Premising that “Labor” would “face
the toughest battle in its history next
year,” Rosevear, the Speaker, who fre-
quently descends to the floor of the House
to have a crack at opponents, gave it
out that “the first shot in the battle” —
a term “Labor” reserves not for any
foreign foe, but for the part of the nation
that doesn’t accept its party’s Mad Con-
tinent socialism —“will come with the
prices referendum”:
Unless the people give the Government
[not Parliament] power to control prices
there will be rapid increases in the cost
of living and many evictions.
With “Labor” in full control of prices
and rents, there have been “rapid in-
creases” and “many evictions” already,
above all, in Rosevear’s State. And
Rosevear himself has been largely respon-
sible for “rapid increases” in the cost
of government, by which he himself has
benefited.
A.B.C. has lost £166,800 on its
“Weekly,” and £3400 on its “Talk.” And
this without reckoning the expenditure
on the incomeless “news service,” which
keeps obscure “Labor” members and
Communists like Healy, of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, before a public
which has done nothing to deserve the in-
fliction. True, A.B.C. is guiltless of
the “news service,” The excrescence was
imposed on the commission and its sub-
scribers by Calwell and by Amour, late
of San Francisco.
At the Victorian A.N.A. conference
there was little support for a motion
recommending the State Government to go
into the lottery business. An Ararat man,
voicing the opinion of “a large majority,”
said “it would be a slur on the A.N.A, to
promote the disease of gambling,” and
so it would be. The gambling disease
has got such a hold on people in this
country that bookmakers have become
privileged and press-bdomed characters,
and millions that should be going into sav-
ings banks and Government securities as
provision against bad times are being lost
in lotteries. Many Australians have be-
come as inveterate gamblers as colored
peoples to the north of them, who,
partly on that account, have culturally,
industrially and in matters of government
never amounted to a row of pins.
Communists get the use of Sydney’s
Town Hall whenever they want it, and
they are to have it again for a “rally”
or for the trumpeting or muttering of
sedition on April 6. Lud Mayor Bart-
ley, feebly echoing Chifley, pleads that
their “party” is “a legal organisation.”
and so can’t be refused hire of the hall,
which is all bunkum. It would be refused
fast enough if nudists wanted it for a
show, yet nudists have a police-recognised
“legal organisation.” And it can and
should be refused in every case where a
breach of the peace is possible, as
in this instance. Feeling against Com-
munists is running high everywhere, and
if a breach of the peace occurs because
and while they are doing their venomous
stuff in the biggest city’s chief meeting-
place, they will themselves have set evil
examples.
In the Guildford-Midland (W.A.) by-
election the Liberal, Grayden, was well
ahead of the “Labor” man, Brady, 2666
to 2582, after the fifth count. Then the
Communist votes came in—l3o2 of them,
many given to the Com. because he was
a doctor —and 937 went to Brady. And
that’s how the favorite got home-
favorite because the seat has been
“Labor” since 1906, except for a National
“Labor” period during the conscription
split.
Shrewdly thrusting at Dr. Evatt in the
Bank Grab case, I. A. Hannan, K.C.,
for S.A. and Westralia, said the Attorney-
General had not fairly addressed himself
to the arguments for the States. Instead
he had “erected straw men and knocked
them down.” A favorite device of the
doctor’s, and effective at times in political
matters, though never in referendum mat-
ters.
There is to be an Assembly by-election
for Coogee, Sydney, “Lou” Cunningham
having died suddenly at 58. “Lou”
(Lucien Lawrence) had a variegated
career; “Labor” member for Federal
Gwydir, 1919-25 and 1929-32, hon.
Minister for six months, 1931-32, and
opponent of Ward in East Sydney, Feb.,
1932 —“Lou” lost his deposit. Member
for Coogee since 1941, he became a
director of the Victoria Park Racing Club,
and as such had a hand in the sale of
the course to Lord Nuffield. Previously,
having to reckon with divided loyalties,
he voted for the extinction of proprietary
racing concerns and the setting-up, and
that during the Jap war, of the Sydney
Turf Club, on which McKell, now Gee-
Gee, had set his heart. Coogee used to
be a safe Liberal seat. With Cunningham,
a shrewd campaigner, gone it should be
regained.
Finnan, to Vincent (C.P.), who wanted
to know when farmers might be able to
get a bit of galvanised-iron:
The Commonwealth authorities who con-
trol galvanised-iron have reaffirmed their
previous decision not to allow the accumula-
tions of galvanised-iron at Newcastle to be
released for use in this State.
The stuff is stuck at Newcastle, together
with heaps of other essentials, because
of Communist strikes and go-slow. So
Haddock was wrong—it is the Communist
authorities who control galvanised-iron.
At Easter, as Brisbane “Courier-Mail”
worked it out, the Queensland strike had
held up shipments of Queensland pro-
duce worth £10,000,000— including food
for Britain valued at £6,525,000. But
since Chifley apparently never reads the
papers, nobody need expect him to be
disturbed about it.
Hanlon has introduced the bill author-
ising an agreement between his State and
the British Overseas Food Corporation;
the State to put in £500,000 of £2,000,000
involved in a plan to grow foodstuffs on
the blacksoil country around Emerald.
Sorghum and sunflowers will be cultivated
and 500,000 pigs a year reared on 250,000
acres. The scheme is under Government
control, and therein lies the danger. No-
where in Australian history has a Gov-
ernment made a go of farming, big or
small,
Sydney R.A.S. got the Gee-Gee to open
its Show. Never was a representative of
the King greeted so frigidly. But, then,
no previous representative was wished on
the King.
From a survey of the Chifley Govern-
ment’s defence plan it is obvious that
Australia is geared and ready for attack
—provided it comes from the natives of
Groote Eylandt.
Dickson, who succeeded Matthews as
Building Materials Minister in N.S.W.,
has announced that anyone can now do
£l5O-worth of painting without a permit.
Previously the limit was £75-worth,
members and friends of the new privi-
leged aristocracy excepted. But who
can buy £l5O-worth of paint and, having
bought it, can get painters to slap it on?
Reaffirming the British decision to quit
Palestine on May 15, Bevin took a swipe
at Our Foreign Policy:
The British Government will support any
agreement between Arabs and Jews, but will
not take part in forcing trusteeship or any-
thing else on them. That has been our
attitude at all times and I wish other people
had realised what enforcement meant when
they voted so easily at U.N.O. for partition.
Our Foreign Policy was one of them.
Up to Good Friday there had been five
(5) conferences of parties to the Sydney
beer strike, and all to no avail. The
city had then been without beer for nearly
a month. If maintenance of the beer
supplies depended on conferences the
T.T. people could go out of business.
Extract from the British Socialist Gov-
ernment’s White Paper on prices:
The Government now sees that its eco-
nomic controls are not proof against strong,
persistent inflationary pressure. Too much
faith is still reposed in price-control.
On the Chifley “Government” that light
has not yet fallen. Indeed, it is a guinea
to a gooseberry that when Ministers be-
gin campaigning for the prices referen-
dum they will claim as a specific for
economic disorders what their brother-
Socialists in Britain have found to be
mere quackery.
Fraser (“Labor,” Eden-Monaro) gave
Canberra a good laugh by coming
out in his “Observer” with a rhapsody on
Czechoslovakia when it had been trans-
formed by violence into a Communist
police State. It was the work of a lady
who found life in Prague “an exhilarating
experience” and went into raptures over
“the main fundamentals of Czech
policy”;
A maximum of political democracy
and personal freedom. The nationalisa-
tion of key industries, combined with over-
all economic planning and extension of
social services. A foreign policy based
firmly on alliance with the Soviet Union.
There is one thing which the people
will never forgive or forget, and that is
their betrayal at Munich. Even today they
recall how their beloved Benes was humili-
ated by Chamberlain and Daladier and that
the only country to offer assistance was
the Soviet Union. Whatever else happens
this is something they will never forget.
Priceless, considering that “the beloved
Benes” sold the pass to Stalin, and that
many of those who looked to him for
leadership had to bolt to save their necks.


THE NARK ON THE JOB.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Jasby”: I am aware that Burley
Griffin is usually credited with designing
the city of Canberra, but I can’t help
feeling that a certain psychologist called
Yerkes had something to do with the in-
spiration. Motorists visiting the Federal
Capital for the first time find the place
easy to get into, but darned hard to get
out of. It looks simple enough. You set
forth blithely, following the curves of the
well-paved thoroughfare which you feel
sure will lead you to the Sydney road.
It doesn’t. Instead you find yourself back
where you started, with Parliament House
leering at you in contempt. Deciding that
you must have missed the turn-off, you
try again, with the same result. By the
time you’ve failed four times the leer is
so pronounced that you throw in the
sponge and look for a pilot. Best pilots,
of course, are members’ cars, and the
best of the best the Ministerial limousines.
They’re experts at getting out of Can-
berra. Where does Yerkes come in?
Well, he was a bloke who conducted a
lot of experiments with worms, rats, apes
and so on. His best-known trick, dia-
grammed in the appropriate textbooks, is
entitled “An experiment to make a cray-
fish familiar With an exit from a box.”

“Sloop the Snoop”; Without going
into the details of the structure of
“modern” poetry, I would point out that
T. S. Eliot’s ritual drama “Murder in the
Cathedral” (B, 17/3/’4B) is not written
in blank verse. Eliot’s medium is free
verse.

“Caseye”: In a Red Page review of
the poetry of Noel Matthews (B.
24/3 /’4B) it is alleged that he “shows an
“And he's wondering why he's got indigestion !”
alert and original observation in the
art that becomes a symbol of the decay
of Corsica and the timeless life of the
earth”;
An ant on patient feet
Plods with a twig across the sleepy street.
Apart from the absurdity of an ant —
that industrious forager and builder —as
a symbol of decay, he is a poor observer
who sees the busy, tireless ant-feet as
“patient,” and the spectacle of an ant
“plodding” is simply too much. Some
of these reviewers take their poets far
too seriously.

“Plop”: The stars must have been in-
auspicious for me on the day I picked
to go to the Sydney Show. My troubles
began when the bottom fell out of my
sample-bag. forcing me to transplant the
condiment bottles into my pockets and to
make my way around emitting clinks.
Matrons viewed me sternly, and when I
smiled and ventured the occasional ex-
planation “Merely sauce” they’d agree
with me. I won’t dwell on the Hereford
bull who stamped on my foot, nor do I
complain about the man outside the
boxing tent who, when I tried to clear my
nose of some chaff, took it as a signal
that I wanted to fight the heavyweight,
and who, when I departed hurriedly, re-
marked ; “He might have done all right,
too —look at his footwork! ” Sufficient to
say that I was gloomy before I even
came to the Atomic Age Exhibition —
most who viewed it with me looked happy
enough until they had passed half-way
through, then they became more serious.
After the Atom Show’s final note —some
films of Hiroshima and Bikini —we em-
erged with worried dials and feeling a
little amazed that the Members’ Stand
was still with us. Only one of the whole
crowd was smiling. I struck him later
advertising toothpaste.

“Zake”: It is remarkable how often
Byrds and Pullitts crop up as exhibitors
in the poultry section at the Show —one
of the former clan is a prominent prize-
winner this year. Years of Show-doing
have left me with no surprise at seeing
Hoggs successful as raisers of class
baconers or backfatters, Barkers as
breeders of champion tykes, or a Bull
whose bovines sport a ribbon. A Rose,
a Budd or a Flowers is no uncommon
exhibitor at Shows. But perhaps the most
inappropriate I ever struck was a Mrs.
Leather. No, her entry wasn’t something
in the Handicrafts Exhibit—she cleaned
up first prize for sponge cakes.

“Bo”; I no longer doubt that the cos-
mopolitanisation of the U.S.A. is com-
plete. A current newsreel gives glimpses
of various American universities while an
unseen chorus sings the song specifically
associated with each Alma Mater. When
Notre Dame was reached the commen-
tator waxed enthusiastic. “This uni-
versity,” he declaimed, “is world-famous
for its football team —the ‘Fighting
Irish’!” (Five-second flash of a bunch
of well-padded huskies performing their
mysterious rites on the “grid.”) The com-
mentator went on, in serious tones:
“Among the immortals are names that
everyone knows: Gibb, Spinkonovitch,
Wezlavansky, Companiotti” Och, to
be in Oireland now that O’Miczolotsky’s
there!
* * * *
“Becks”: Waverley Council (Sydney)
has bought Bronte House, overlooking
Nelson’s Bay, Bronte, and intends to pre-
serve it as an example of early colonial
architecture. Built in 1836, it was occu-
pied for a few years by the Lewis family.
and in 1845 Robert Lowe took posses-
sion. Lowe was an English barrister
who came out to Australia for health
reasons and was appointed by Governor
Gipps to the Legislative Council. After
10 months he resigned through a dif-
ference of opinion with Gipps, but sub-
sequently returned to the Council as an
elected member for the counties of St.
Vincent and Auckland, and later for the
City of Sydney. Returning to England
in 1850, he wrote leaders for the “Times,”
entered the Commons as member for
Kidderminster, held minor office under
Aberdeen and Palmerston and became
Chancellor of the Exchequer in Glad-
stone’s first administration. On retiring
from the Commons he was created Vis-
count Sherbrooke. For the past 60 years
“Perm back and sides, please
the Ebsworth family has occupied Bronte
House and assured its preservation.
Waverley Council intends to fit out the
old place with furniture appropriate to
the period of its early years and to throw
it open to public inspection under the
guardianship of the Red Cross Society.
Gifts of furniture or articles of historic
interest are invited.
* * * *
“Muskeen”; Tell Rip Van “Clooter”
that during the war groups of mature men
(B. 17/3/’4B) were called “boys” scores of
times every day and no trouble accrued
to the callers. As a decorated veteran of
World War I, I was referred to and ad-
dressed collectively as a boy about half
a dozen times daily by officers who were
little more than boys themselves, and
didn’t feel any resentment. However,
after December, 1940, when I received
my commission in Palestine, I ceased to
be a boy, but the o.rs. in my unit were
“boys” until the end of the war.
“Hamer”: I’m not exactly a two-year-
old, but no resentment stirs in my bosom
when the barmaid asks the group I am
with “What are you boys going to have?”
My friend the Judge (retired), who looks
a model of grey dignity, seems to find
an extra zip in his drink from his inclu-
sion in the juvenile title. The cop who
tries to move-on a crowd gets no resent-
ment for his “Come on, boys ; a fair go
for the traffic.” At a veterans’ gathering
recently an entertainer got busy, tried to
get some choruses going. His “Now,
boys, your turn ; let it go! ” got a response
from baldheads and grey-thatches that
was probably heartier because of the
form of invitation. What’s wrong with
“boys,” anyway? The misapplication of
the word has become so familiar that
people cease to smile when Aunt Hilda
introduces a near-septuagenarian as “my
boy-friend.”
» ♦ ♦ *
“Youanmi”: If there’s a “pie-eater” in
the house will he please come forward
and explain? I recall from my youthful
reading that Hopalong Cassidy’s horse
was accused of “pie-eating” when smoog-
ing for favors, and more recently in the
army I heard the expression commonly
used as a term of derision. About 1 a.m.
the other morning, however, when
the police were combing the city after
a stabbing affair at King’s Cross, I over-
heard a vendor of “hot dogs” discussing
the business with a policeman. “Arr,” he
said, as he whacked the mustard on the
“dawg,” “these so-and-so pie-eaters’d
stick a knife into anyone. Y’ just can’t
trust ’em.” Is the expression some
Sydney-side jargon I’ve missed, or is it,
in a “hot-dog” merchant’s conception of
things, a fitting description of the last
word in human baseness?
* * * *
“Strop”: “Suvic” (B. 10/3/’4B) wants
to know what caused his shadow, with
technicolor effects, to appear on the
cloud-floor beneath him. He will listen
to none but an expert. Will Flammarion
suit him? That pioneer flyer was up in
a balloon on April 15, 1868, when he had
an experience similar to “Suvic’s” under
identical conditions. The thermometer
showed two degrees above zero and the
hygrometer marked 77 humidity. “It is
certain,” he wrote, “that the phenomenon
is due to the diffraction of light, simply
produced by the vesicles of the mist.”
The best-known exam ole of the soectral
image is the “Brocken Spectre,” but
identical phenomena have been reported
from mountainous districts all over the
world. With a little juggling of clothes-
props and the spray from a garden-hose,
when the atmospheric conditions are
favorable and the sun is low-angle, the
“rainbow and cross” can be reproduced
at will.
“Kurilla”: Can’t explain “Suvic’s” ex-
perience, but I once saw something
similar. It happened just after sundown ;
there was a haze of dust ahead and the
sky above was clear. In the dust-cloud
in front of us —we were flying low in an
old Buick and had just switched the lights
on —there suddenly appeared a replica of
the old bus approaching us head-on.
Before anyone had sufficiently recovered
to do anything we had driven straight
through it. Perhaps some Outbacker with
experience of mirages and of pubs a long
way apart could help.
* * * #
“Suvic”: Speed seems to be the prime
aim of modern aircraft-design, but it is
doubtful whether the faster planes have
the manoeuvrability of some of the early
war types. Witness the performance of
a JUBB in 1943. The pilot was hedge-
hopping the fences of Stalag IVB.
Skimming the football-field, he hit two
Canadians with his tailplane, killing one,
wounding the other. He then struck the
10ft, laced-wire fence, broke through and,
after a stagger, resumed his climb. As a
point of interest the pilot was brought
to the camp, visited the wounded man,
was shown the body of the dead one and
then demoted.
* * * *
“Torch”: I was after a live cray for
bait, and the new Australian in the fish-
shop produced one which looked dead to
me —and I told him so. He squeezed the
crustacean’s eye to show that it was alive,
but it made not a move. “Werl,” he
confessed sadly, “its a-dead all right.”
Then his face suddenly brightened and
he added earnestly: “But not-a verra
dead, mister!”
* * * ♦
“Curate’s Egg”; During his first night’s
duty at our suburban station the new
John Hop handed over to the sergeant a
struggling prisoner with the proud boast
that be had unmasked the Peeping Tom
who had been plaguing the district. His
superior was shocked to recognise the
newly-wedded Judkins, our suburban
model of propriety, whose protestations
of innocence were cut short by the
arrival of Mrs. J. in deshabille and semi-
hysterics. Judkins, in order to convince
his doubting spouse that her failure to
pull down a blind was providing good
entertainment for passers-by, had under-
taken to retail every feature of her re-
tiring arrangements as observed from a
vantage-point in the street. The untimely
arrive! of the copper at Judkins’s peak-
point in data-gathering had precipitated
the arrest.
* * * *
“Bybren”: I had never seen a shop-
lifter at work, so I was intrigued by the
actions of a young man in a department-
store recently. In the baby-goods sec-
tion he sidled up and down, peering as
furtively as any character from a novel
could in about six directions at once. A
shopwalker cruised into sight, and, with
a guilty start, the “peerer” made a pre-
tence of inspecting a stroller. When the
hawk-eyed one had passed on the young
chap resumed his peering. Satisfied at
last that he was not observed, he pulled
a carpenter’s rule from his pocket, made
three or four quick measurements of a
baby’s commode-chair, and was three de-
partments away before you could wink.
ANOTHER LEAGUE OF NOTIONS?
“U.N.0., which, Dr. Evatt tells us, is the only
power which can avert war, does a lot of talking
hut is incapable of action. It is just the League
of Nations under another name.” — W. M. Hughes.
The League of Nations! Woodrow Wilson’s pup
Which was to save the world from war’s
distraction.
How ignominiously it folded up
When need arose for action.
What floods of well-intentioned oratory
It loosed, with academic yap in oceans,
Till somebody suggested cynically
A better-fitting name for it would be
The League of Notions.
Where is it now? Stone-dead, you must admit,
Unmourned, a flop calamitous and utter,
With all the millions freely spent on it
Just chucked into the gutter.
And as a field for disputation hot,
A forum for deliberating motions
It can’t enforce, if Hughes has hit the spot,
It seems in U.N.O. once more we’ve got
A League of Notions.
Doc. Evatt definitely holds it can’t
Be beat for keeping peace ’twixt fractious
nations,
A view he’s gained as a participant
In its deliberations.
Hughes, older, wiser, enters a demur,
Stamps those who put their trust in it as
sillies,
Finds nothing in it but a register,
Of words. Which estimate do you prefer,
Evatt’s or Billy’s?

“Macnell”: Sailors will vie with land-
lubbers in inspecting Vanguard next year ;
her appointments (forrard, not aft) have
revolutionised home-comforts in the
R.N. Where formerly mess-decks and
compartments were a uniform, dirt-show-
ing white, they now glow with soft shades
of green, peach and cream. An A.B. in
the old 1945 days had to reach petty-
ofßcer’s rank before sitting on anything
softer than a scrubbed plank. Now
mess-stools are sponge-rubber, and in
recreation spaces (shades of Nelson!) are
fitted chrome chairs with maroon covers
and porthole-curtains to match. Scattered
throughout the vast ship—the largest of
them outside the ordinary seamen’s mess-
deck —are sparkling canteens, ice-cream
bars, soda-fountains. The ship prints her
own newspaper and brews her own beer.
The “wooden ships and iron men” era has
passed. Where a piece of steel used to
be considered sufficient windbreak, ex-
haustive wind-tunnel experiments went to
the design of Vanguard’s innumerable
bridges, spotting-tops and control-towers.
Not even a Biscay gale will disturb the
Royal headgear. Navy ships have merited
descriptive names —one was called
Bounty—but all sailors enviously agree
Vanguard’s is richly deserved. They call
her “glamor-ship.”
* * * *
“Grim”: The American idea of wear-
ing a name-tag at conventions and the
like wouldn’t suffice in our town. At a
party in connection with good works the
other day I was introduced to the mayor’s
wife. “And who are you?” she asked.
I repeated my name. “I heard your
name,” was the reply, “but who are
you?”
* * * *
“Irwa”; Cash-customers staggering out
of Perth’s most fashionable pub were
shocked to see a full set of dentures
dangling by a string from the lower
branches of a tree on St. George’s
Terrace. Mistakenly supposing this to
be one of those horrid hallucinations
which beset the hero of “Lost Week-end,”
they tried to ignore the faceless grin
suspended in mid-air before their bulg-
ing eyes. Then one brave soul stepped
up to the apparition and discovered a
note clenched between the synthetic
v'angs: “Anyone who wants these teeth
tan have them —I’ve had them.”
» * * »
“F.S.”: Picture-libraries are not alto-
gether a new idea in Australia. Some
artists started one years ago in Mel-
bourne. The project succumbed to the
ordinary human failing that book-
libraries suffer from. Too many
borrowers' forgot to return their pictures,
and paintings can’t be replaced as easily
as books. The real difficulty with these
ventures is that they make art too easy,
and things gained easily are seldom
valued. Good luck to the three ladies if
their scheme succeeds, but if it does I’ll
be as surprised as I will be if 100 of the
thousands who are pouring into the youth
concerts in Melbourne have any active
interest in music 10 years hence. The
only thing that will maintain an interest
in any art is the practice of that art, not
gawking at it.
« • * *
“Tackline S.”: “Bosun’s Mate” is a bit
to leeward. In British ships our own
officers are piped aboard only if they are
of flag-officer’s rank ot are captains of
seagoing ships. The King is piped aboard
both in his capacity as a flag-officer and
as a member of the Royal Family, all of
whom are so honored. A memory re-
vived: A lieutenant in command of an
Australian corvette one day boarded his
ship in company with his small son. The
shrill blast of the bosun’s call brought
all those above decks to attention. Heels
clicked as the gangway mob saluted;
seamen dropped their working-gear in
“POOR chap; hes dumb."
rPcnnnQP to the call • louneers cursed the
disturbance As the arrivals neared the
auartemaster A small son produced a
Ht his Hm and kept all
hand at P the “st 11” for an
hands at the still tor an amusing nan
minute.
“Muskeen”: I’m all for the old naval
custom of piping the side (B, 17/3/’4B),
but cannot agree with “Bosun’s Mate”
that this ceremony is the “Navy’s highest
honor” when it can be performed for a
Chilean snottie, while Tedder , and Mont-
gomery are barred.
° * * * *
“Quizzed-out”: It occurred during the
elimination round of the National Quiz,
so was not heard outside the studio,
though it deserved a bigger audience,
The question was “What is meant by the
Portland Race?” The contestant appa-
rently wasn’t too strong on his tidal cur-
rents but he made a valiant effort. “Oh,
yes ’ They’re the descendants of the Pil-
grim Fathers.”
*'* * *
“Caballer”: Salesmanship? In the
winter of 1917-18 the trust in human
nature of the civilians on the Somme had
been impaired to a certain extent by
the purchase of tins of “jam” that were
95 p.c. mud with a quarter-inch layer
of jam on top. It made them difficult,
We hadn’t the resources of modern
science, but we had a hard winter. A
rum-jar almost full of water could be
left out for the night. In the morning
the contents were solid ice and the
Frenchman buying on the blackmarket
would be waiting round the corner. Ten
seconds before the sale a spoonful or two
of the genuine S.R.D., fit to float a hand-
spike, would top-off the ice and the
Frenchman, demanding a sample, would
receive an issue that would make a cat
speak. I’ve often wondered if it would
be reasonable to assume that a French
farmer, sitting by his warm fireside think-
ing things over, would arrive at the cor-
rect answer to the problem of how a
jar of rum from which he had drank
overproof spirit should, after a few hours,
turn into water.
• * * *
“Lwellyn”: Lofty, a very full private
of the Ninth Division on leave in Alex-
andria in 1941, spent a pleasant day
fraternising with matelots on shore leave
from H.M.S. Warspite. At the end of
the day his haziness as to what branch
of the Service he belonged to was deep-
ened by the loss of his Digger hat, which
rendered him not very different sartori-
ally from the shorts-clad R.N. lads. This
resemblance enabled him to pass by
pinnace and rope-ladder on to the sacro-
sanct deck of Warspite, where he was
pulled up with a round turn by the
officer-of-the-watch. After a sobering
spell in irons he was brought before a
personage who, presumably considering
the offence too’heinous for the Navy to
ordered him to be marooned on the
beach at Alex, until rescued by the pro-
vosts. A fortunate relapse of sandfly-
fever delivered him from the Jacks’ cus-
tody into hospital. On discharge he be-
came lost in the maze of administrative
machinery until finally cast up with his
own unit, with an unfinalised charge of
lese majeste still overclouding his
Civvy-street existence,
* * * * _
“Mickerman”: Tram-ticket collecting
(B. 17/3/’4B) once had its devotees just
as enthusiastic as the most rabid philate-
list. The biggest exhibit in my collec-
tion was a six-inch London County
Council ticket which listed every stop
along the route. The conductor punched
a hole opposite the name of the board-
ing-point and another against the. stop
where the money ran out. Much more
artistic were the Dusseldorf tram-tickets',
the choicest items in any collection. These
were 2|in, by l|in., and were decorated
with a map of the city, with a diagram
of the tram-route overlaid. The method
of cancellation was to make a blue-pen-
cil mark against boarding and departure
points. In Mussolini’s time the Milan
tickets carried the Italian equivalent of
“please destroy on alighting.” This was
often obeyed by pushing a finger through
the portrait of the Duce with which the
ticket was dubiously decorated. If we
are to go in for artistically-designed tram-
tickets it would perhaps be as well if
we refrained from using our politicians
as decorations—or would it?
* * ♦ *
“Craiser”: All political parties base
their claims on the great generalisations
like right, justice, goodness and beauty,
and a striking illustration of this fact was
provided at a stormy election-meeting at
North Melbourne. A Labor supporter
demanded the right to read one of his
party’s pamphlets, and for the sake of
peace he was given a brief hearing. Pull-
ing a document out of his pocket, he read
it right through, but it happened to be a
Liberal pamphlet.
* * * *
“Uramao”: Among the inducements
to lure flappers into Maoriland offices
one Wellington (M.L.) firm goes better
than the usual morning- and afternoon-
tea, radio, perm., long holidays and high
wages. Its latest brainwave; “We re-
member your birthday—every girl’s birth-
day is remembered by the friendly
management and staff.” Dour Dunedin,
with its centennial celebrations, has been
accused by other cities of tempting their
flapper typists awa’ to the Scotch city
during the 1948 round of festivities. A
Dunedin firm recently advertised for
girls, quoting figures showing the number
who had married while working at the
firm.
» * ♦ *
“K.W.”: In Perth, which knows not
traffic-lights, point-duty policemen still
command the traffic, but on a hot
March day citizens were surprised to
note a total absence of pointsmen. This
was the day of the police picnic, and all
the cops had gone down to the sea at
Rockingham. The city went on about its
business as though nothing had happened.
There were no traffic jams, no accidents.
A bus-driver who had been driving around
Perth these many long years wrote to
the papers saying “Give them a picnic
every day. This is the best traffic set-up
we’ve ever had,”
* * * *
“Bungle”: One shrewd gent, in our
town hasn’t been troubled so far about
parking-space for his car. His office
fronts a taxi-parking space, and, as all
available room is occupied, he simply
drives in beside the standard, hops out
and shifts the sign to the back of his
car. When leaving he moves the ob-
struction back, and so reserves a place
for himself when he returns to the office.
* * * *
“Avro”; I endorse “John Dee’s” ob-
servation (B. 3/ 3 / ’4B) of the singularity
of the Australian’s thirst for cold beer.
Had the same experience myself in the
Old Country. Of course, during winter
refrigeration was superfluous, but often
when drinking with the locals at a village
inn during the sultry days of summer I
sighed for just one refreshing draught
“off the ice.” Ex-R.A.A.F.ers will re-
call the one and only “Cogers,” off Fleet-
street, where Eve dispensed good cheer
with iced Barclay’s draught ale. “The
Cogers” boasted another fitting rare in
English pubs —the footrail. I must com-
mend, however, the liberal drinking hours
over there which eliminate the short but
hectic “sessions” as we know them. The
English pub is a social centre where you
may intersperse your drinking with a
game of darts, skittles or dominoes and
grab a bite at the snack-bar,
* * * *
“Botfly”: Reached a camp on the north
coast of New Guinea where a w.o. with
native labor and hand tools was trying
to change mud into a road. Within a
few minutes we had heard about the wife
and kids ; we were picturing him back at
home, right on the tramline and only 30
yards from a pub when we went into his
sago-palm hut decorated with a profu-
sion of spears, grass-skirts, drums and
the like hanging even from the roof. All
we could say was! “What a collection!”
“I move about a lot,” he replied, “but I
always make myself at home.”
BEERLESS SYDNEY.
It comes, a trifle early,
The blessed Eastertide,
But Bungs may well look surly
Their staple goods denied.
Schooner and pint and tankard
On shelves and hooks are anchored,
With nothing of what’s hankered
After to put inside.
Hushed is the beer-pump’s swishing.
There’s not the slightest use,
It’s obvious, in wishing
For what it can’t produce,
When neither threat nor prayer
Would win for the essayer
The nut-brown thirst-allayer,
The “old familiar juice.”
It’s off, the foaming measure,
The satisfying pot
Employed to gladden leisure
And sweeten toil a lot,
The immemorial quencher
Of parch, and none will venture
The taverners to censure
For what they haven’t got.
Barmaids may well be wending
Their ways a trifle wan
With day from day portending
Another dies non;
And many a sturdy fellow
Who served the mild or mellow
Is finding, like Othello,
His occupation gone.
No more from brewery portals
Go forth the loaded drays;
And though ascetic mortals
And never-touch-it jays
May face the famine fearless,
I find it bleak and cheerless.
O bitter days and beerless,
O bitter-beerless days!

When Sister Sue found her tube of Napro Hair
Vitalizer squeezed dry, she just took one look at brother
Bob’s lustrous, healthy hair and picked the culprit.
For Bob, like many other men, had found that Napro
Hair Vitalizer gave him a healthy scalp, removed
dandruff and made his hair elastic and vigorous. But
he’s got no excuse for "borrowing” it again, because
now there is a special Napro Hair Vitalizer for men
that has all the qualities of the original product and,
at the same time, keeps the hair perfectly groomed
without "plastering.” So just slip into any good chemist
or store and buy a tube to-day—it will improve your
hair from the very first application.

THE SERVICE MAN
War Chances in Europe
[ “Ek Dum”: The military
situation of the world at
present is not very heartening
from the point of view of the
Western camp. British defence
is at a low ebb, if not so in-
effective as at the beginning of
the last war. Sea transport, the
heart of all military operation in
modern times, is comparatively
far more limited than it was
| when war broke out in 1939.
Aircraft have developed in
speed, gun - power, striking
power, but air forces have not.
Air transport is relatively
limited. Yet in the kind of war
which might have to be fought
it would be more important pos-
sibly than bombers.
The average man —and Mr.
Chifley is no more than average:
he never had experience of any
weapon save a railway-engine in
combat envisages hostilities
which might come as a sudden
onslaught in which a powerful,
highly modern Soviet-bloc air
force or rocket service would
seed the territory of the Allies
with atom-bombs and V-rockets
and hope to walk in afterwards
to collect the spoils.
What would be much more
likely .would be a sudden burst-
ing out of millions of men, not
very well armed, not very well
provisioned, rolling along over
the bodies of countless com-
rades, come bomb or bullet.
Russian Advantages
Russia has' a vast advantage in
a central position, widely-distri-
buted population, long border-
lines and internal secrecy. The
Kremlin can concentrate, with-
out the outer world knowing it,
at a dozen points of vantage. Its
armies, once moving, have no
qualms about civil populations
as civilised armies have. Rus-
sian soldiery live off the country-
side which they invade in a way
which eighteenth-century Con-
tinental soldiery would have
thought barbarous. They have
no worries about sea transport
because Russia is a central
Power. They do not have to
face the criticism of newspapers
that wish to run the war for
their commanders. Nobody in
Moscow is likely to ask why
Bolotnikoff is not sacked or
issue advice to Generalissimo
Stalin to send for Eisen-
hower and Montgomery to
teach contemptible Russian
generals how to fight. Any
editor who tried it would find
himself giving advice, very
shortly, through several feet of
frozen earth. Even if he were
allowed to do what New York
and Sydney editors did in World
War 11, there would be no
public opinion to react.
The problems which arise in
logistics are horrible to con-
template. A few miles’ drive on
a dark night would take a
Russian army into Sweden,
Italy, Greece, Turkey, Persia,
western Germany, Afghanistan
or southern Korea. A glimpse at
a map is enough to show the
problem of getting at a Russian
invasion in any of those areas
quickly without an immense
build-up of Western air trans-
port and rail rolling-stock, which
is non-existent for practical war
purposes in some of the coun-
tries mentioned, or of road and
air travel, depending on abund-
ance of vehicles, air or other-
wise, and a huge organisation
for tankage and storage of fuel.
No such organisation is
needed with the Russian bloc
army. It is ready now and on a
war footing, much of it lined
along foreign borders.
No mobilisation orders need
to be given and no formality
observed in obtaining labor or
transport. Notice is serVed at
rifle-point with a bayonet. The
heaviest logistic task is the
moving of tanks and artillery.
and this is accomplished under
conditions which would kill
Western soldiery, accustomed to
being well fed from a commis-
sariat, protected from the air
while moving, their hard labor
limited to actual fighting.
Even in oil, when it is needed,
the Russian has an immense
advantage. He has Baku and
the Rumanian and other Euro-
pean fields. He has the food of
eastern Germany. And he has
been very careful to hold on in-
tact to those industrial areas
which might be useful in war
with the West.
The Czech-Polish coal-indus-
trial area, for instance, very
little damaged in World War 11
for the simple reason that
the Russians objected to its
being wrecked, is a tremendous
asset, placed as it is fairly well
behind the western borders of
Russian-controlled territory. It
would take major operations ex-
tending over some time to put it
out of operation.
In a war against Western
Europe the Russians would
also have at least one great
arsenal close to the front-line.
Skoda has always been a Rus-

sian obsession. In 1938 Mos-
cow was shrieking that the Nazis
were blood-drunk ruffians who
ought to be exterminated, and
the shriek became louder when
Czechoslovakia was threatened.
When it became certain that the
German seizure of Czech terri-
tory had become a fait accompli
the Soviet shriek of rage changed
to a mendicant snuffle.
As proved by the German
Foreign Office documents seized
by the Americans, we find the
Russian Ambassador (Mereka-
lov) early in 1939 calling on the
State Secretary to the German
Foreign Office and “dwelling at
length on a subject which he
said was of particular interest to
him: namely, the fulfilment of
certain contracts for war
materiel by the Skoda works.
At a later stage, when Rus-
sians could no longer call on
their friends at Berlin, the Allies
desired to bomb Skoda, a very
valuable German asset, out of
existence. Moscow made ex-
press, urgent requests that Skoda
should be left alone. Left alone
if was, along with other Czech
armament centres and aircraft
plants, all of which have now
fallen into the hands of the Rus-
sian bloc, along with the per-
sonnel, much of it of a high
technical and inventive standard,

Infiltrated Armies
The U.S.S.R. has the addi-
tional advantage of having its
vanguards already in the coun-
tries which it is likely to invade,
As with the Australian Com-
munist party, so with the Ger-
mans, the Italians, the French,
the Dutch, Norwegians and Bel-
gians. In each country there is
an advance-guard of Commun-
ism claiming the privileges of
local nationality, much of it
secretly on the Russian side. It
can be used for sabotage, spy-
ing and propaganda in the in-
nermost recesses of Govern-
ments, the press, public and
scientific institutions, and, above
all, the trade-unions.
This enables the U.S.S.R. very
often to cloak what are primarily
Russian actions with the sem-
blance of local initiative.
At present Tito’s forces and
those of Albania are massed be-
hind the Adriatic seaboard. They
cannot be for defence against
the United States and British
forces in Trieste—there are
only small forces of Allied police
troops there, reinforced recently
with a U.S. cruiser and a couple
of British destroyers. They are
connected with the same plans
which call for a Russian zone in
Tripolitania in Africa and a
taking-over of Italy by the
Communists, headed by the
Comintern executive member,
Togliatti, and embodying a very
large section of former Fascist
officials.
The eagerness for Italy is in-
creased by the fact that Italian
shipyards in 1937 —at a time
when Italy was being publicly
lambasted by Moscow through-
out the world as a nation of
“Fascist beasts” —built the pro-
totypes of the new cruiser and
destroyer navy of the U.S.S.R.
and provided the plans for the
rest of the Russian naval pro-
gramme.
Control of Italy and the
Italian colonies is a vital issue
with the U.S.S.R. because it
would give a base for control of
the Mediterranean naval power
and put a block in all the
British-American lifelines of sea
and air communication with Asia
and the Pacific.
If the Communists succeed at
the Italian elections the chances
of war will be very much in-
creased. And let there be no
mistake about the Soviet bloc
being ready. The U.S.S.R. has
never gone off a war basis.
Yugoslavia and other satellites
have actually been strengthening
themselves militarily since 1945.
Distressful China.

that China, under Chiang Kai-

Senator Vandeuberg touched the
heart of the subject when he said
that the Nanking Nationalist
Government “represents our
common contest against Com-
munist aggression and deserves
our firm support.” He might
have added that the leaders of
Nationalist China depend for
their continued leadership on
outside support, and that if they
have not got it the Government
will break up and the Com-
munist conquest of China will
be completed. Indeed, in the
position of relations between the
three Chinese parties—Kuo Min-
tang, Young China and Social
Democrats —it will be touch and
go whether the Government is
saved in its present form in any
case.
Communist organs are full of
their victories. The Chinese
Communists —in other words
the mercenary armies of the
U.S.S.R.—claim to hold the
whole of Manchuria save Muk-
den (on which it was reported a
few days ago in London that the
“pressure had been eased”),
Changchun and Kirin, three be-
sieged cities.
It is claimed that east of the
borders of the provinces of Sui-
yuan and Kansu all the Chinese
Government holds in North
China are narrow strips suffici-
ent to keep open the Taku-
Peking-Kalgan-Pootow railway
and the railway which runs up
the Yellow Sea coast from Taku
through Shanhaikwan to Ying-
chow. Nanking is pictured as
being in the jaws of two wide
areas of Communist conquest,
one of which envelops the whole
of Shantung and Kiangsu pro-
vinces down to the Yang-tsz
mouth, while the other embraces
the Tapieh Mountains, breaks
southward across the Yang-tsz,
cutting off traffic from the sea
to Hankow and reaching down
for Changsha. A third invasion
further west still is claimed to
have mopped up a large area of
Hupeh. The coastal Communist
area, it is declared, reaches to
within a few miles of Shanghai.
Further, south are supposed to
be numerous guerrilla areas con-
trolled by Communists, the
largest of them embracing the
centre of Hainan Island and the
whole of the Luichow Peninsula,
plus a large inland area reach-
ing inward into Kwang-si from
Deep Bay south of the Pearl
River.
These movements have a very
real interest for Australia. China
is the base from which Russia
could control the mid-Pacific
trade-routes. Its submarines
(which appear to be cruising as
far afield as the U.S. coast)
could reach all our north-going
routes from South China.
Hainan is within easy bombing
distance of the Philippines and
reasonable long-distance bomb-
ing distance of Malaya. In any
case, the Communists are not
going to stop in China proper.
Indo-China and Malaya are
urgent goals with them and so
are Burma and India.
For the present, it needs to be
remembered that Chinese waters
along coasts held or threatened
by the Communists are under
patrol by Australian naval units,
and that the only cohesive mili-
tary force which this country
possesses which could be re-
motely considered as capable of
taking on a brigade of trained
troops at a moment’s notice is
the 8.0.A.C., which is far to
the north-east of supposed Com-
munist mainland infiltrations.
What happens in China vitally
concerns this country.
Citizen Air Forces.
“Ek Dum”: Mr. Drakeford,
the Eagle of Maribyrnong, has
announced that the following
Citizen Air Force Squadrons will
be formed for the defence of
Australia;
No. 21, City of Melbourne,
Laverton.
No. 22, City of Sydney,
Bankstown.
No. 23, City of Brisbane,
Archerfield.
No. 25, City of Perth, Pearce,
(W.A.).
These are to be manned with
40 p.c. permanent R.A.A.F. and
60 p.c. citizen forces. They are
to begin with Mustang aircraft
and later will be equipped with
Australian-made Vampire jet
craft.
“This,” says Mr, Drakeford,
“is an important step in the re-
establishment of the nation’s
peace-time Air Force, for every
Australian will remember the
tremendous value of the Citizen
Air Force squadrons to the
R.A.A.F. immediately follow-
ing the outbreak of hostilities in
1939. The Citizen Air Force
will again be the means of pro-
viding Australia with a team of
fully-trained pilots capable of
taking part in immediate opera-
tions should occasion arise.
“Citizen Air Force personnel
will be selected with a view to
providing the R.A.A.F. with an
invaluable nucleus of officers
and airmen whose high standard
of skill, knowledge and training
will enable them to fill key
operational or training posts at
short notice and to provide im-
mediate home defence.”
If Mr. Drakeford could only
soar like his imagination he
would be defence enough for
this country and the R.A.A.F.
could be liquidated.
At the outbreak of the last
war there was not a locally-
trained airman in the forces,
citizen or otherwise, who had
flown a modern aircraft, and
three years after the outbreak
we had Wirraways at Rabaul
and the best locally-trained men
we could send to Singapore were
mostly too raw in training even
for Buffaloes. Some had never
seen a slot or retractable land- 1
ing gear on a war crate, much"
less a Spitfire or a Hurricane.
Exactly how efficient Vampire
pilots are to be produced, with
speeds stepped up to supersonic
fringes and climb-rates and alti-
tudes rising to unheard-of levels
is beyond the imagination of
competent pilots. The best that
can be done is to provide an
elementary training for citizen
aircrews without determining
fully their ability to cope with
the new hazards, speeds and
physical demands of flying in the
500-600 m.p.h. region.
New Atomic Sources.
“Ek Dum”: A development
which has had little attention,
but which may have a great
effect on the atomic-bomb-sup-
ply position, is the creation by
U.S. scientists apparently
headed by Professor G. T. Sea-
borg, a co-creator of plutonium
—of a completely new group of
14 radioactive isotopes, which
was announced early in the
month. One at least will be a
more plentiful source of bomb-
and atomic-power in general.
This is uranium 233, which
will be added to U 235 and pluto-
nium a transmutation of
U 238 —the only two substances
previously known which could
free nuclear energy by a self-
sustaining chain reaction.
The new fission material is
produced by heavy neutron
bombardment of thorium, itself
a non-fissionable element, close
atomically to uranium. Its
atomic weight is 232.2.
It is found in various silicates
and frequently with oxide of
uranium. Its main commer-
cial source is monazite sand,
which exists in workable
quantity in Travancore (India) —
which has some of the best and
biggest deposits—Brazil, the
southern and mid-west States
of the U.S., the Malay Penin-
sula and Australia. Travancore
at present produces more than
two-thirds of the world’s supply,
which has hitherto been used
mainly for making incandescent
gas mantles. It is a grey metal
not unlike platinum and it melts
at 1845 degrees centigrade. Its
radio-active qualities are well
known, and thorium salts of
organic acids have been em-
ployed medicinally for the treat-
ment of cholera and dysentery
and some respiratory diseases.
The world production before
World War II was about 3000
tons of monazite sand containing
two to ten per cent, of thoria.
Thorium is about three times
as plentiful as uranium. And
its inclusion in the practical
atomic range promises further
extensions of fissionable material.
The Headquarters, Eastern
Command, following the salu-
tary practice of Aldershot, has
decided this year to hold an
Army Tattoo at the Royal Show-
ground, Sydney, on the evenings
of April 23-24. The events will
include an artillery display,
P.T., display by the N. S. Wales
Highland Society, a mock air-
raid and a mock battle and
retreat ceremony.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Sydney is to be the home of Sir James
Bisset, ex-Commodore of the Cunard
Line and war-time skipper of Queen
Mary and Queen Elizabeth. Bisset served
his time in windjammers and joined the
Cunard Line as a junior officer in 1907.
It would be hard to find a greater con-
trast than his commands in the two Ger-
man wars. In the first he put in three
years in command of a small destroyer;
in the second, in the two Queens, he was
responsible for the safe carriage of enough
British, American and Australian troops
to constitute a big army by any standards.
He was knighted in 1945, and Cambridge
University gave him an honor unusual
for a seadog—an honorary LL.D. Apart
from war-time experiences his most vivid
memory is of a day in April, 1912, when
the Carpathia, in which he was serving,
picked up in mid-Atlantic 703 survivors
of the Titanic. In Sydney he is taking
on an executive job with Australian
Motorists’ Petrol Co.
Three Australians come in for Royal
Geographical Society awards this year.
Frank Debenham, Professor of Geo-
graphy at Cambridge, gets the Victoria
Medal for contributions to Polar explora-
tion ; A. J. Marshall the Back grant for
his work as leader of the Oxford Uni-
versity exploration club’s expedition to
Jan Mayen Island, and Dr. Donald
Thomson, 0.8. E., of Eltham, Vic., the
Cuthbert Peek grant for anthropological
studies in Arnhem Land.
Elevated last week to the N.S.W.
Supreme Court Bench, Francis Aloysius
Dwyer was called to the Bar 21 years
ago and took silk in 1941. A graduate
of Sydney Uni. in Arts and Law, with
first-class honors, he has built up a con-
siderable practice in common law and
equity cases. In 1944 he appeared for
William Dobell when the award of the
Archibald Prize to that artist was un-
successfully challenged. Justice Bonney
has been granted six months’ leave of
absence through ill-health, and during that
period DVvyer will act as Judge in
Divorce. Borp at Goulburn, his Judge’s
wig comes to him at 45.
Four generations of John Egans have
lived in the house at Eganstown (Vic.)
built in 1862 by the first John Egan, of
bricks made on the spot. Egan came to
Australia from Borrisoleigh, County Tip-
perary, in 1841. His first holding later
became Sol Green’s famous stud farm
on the Werribee. He built the first home-
stead in the Daylesford district in 1848,
and was the first to find gold in those
parts. On Easter Saturday a picnic sports-
meeting organised to commemorate the
centenary of Eganstown brought back a
breath of life to the town which, now
reduced to a store and a post-office, once
boasted 20 hotels and 14 shanties strung
out along the four-mile road to Dayles-
ford.
Arthur William Upfield, Victoria’s
nearest approach to Edgar Wallace, con-
tinues to pour out books wkh intriguing
titles which continue to catch the fancy
of the American public. Following
Death of a Swagman , which was pub-
lished simultaneously in New York, Lon-
don and Prague, and reappeared in an
omnibus and the Penguin series. Double-
day’s have signed a contract for his latest,
The Mountains Have a Secret. An
Author Bites the Dust, already intro-
duced to the American public, will shortly
appear in an Australian edition, and The
Devil’s Steps has run into several print-
ings. His earlier works appeared as
serials in the Melbourne “Herald,” and
he has contributed many, first-rate yarns
to The Bulletin. Upfield was born in
Gosport, England, and came to Australia
in 1911 to practise as an estate agent.
His 2'o-odd novels have all been written
since 1927. He created his aboriginal
detective Napoleon Buonaparte at his
mountain home at Kalorama.
Alan Bernard Challice, who goes to
America to study Uncle Sam’s Red Cross
social services, has been thoroughly
looked over for the job—the Australian
Red Cross selected him ; the Geneva body
approved of him; and the American
organisation accepted him. Sydney-born,
Challice had become a chartered account-
ant by the time war started; he joined
the R.A.A.F. and was one of 40 trainees
selected for transfer to the R.A.F. and
training in Southern Rhodesia. Eng-
land, an O.T.U. and posting to 22 Squad-
ron R.A.F. followed, and he saw the war
out as a pilot in Beaufort torpedo-
bombers in the Middle East and India.
Afterwards he joined the Red Cross and
in a couple of years has become Assist-
ant-superintendent of the N. S. Wales
division of the society. He has used a
powerful frame in rowing for Newing-
ton College, playing football, and as boat
captain of the Palm Beach Surf Club.
A. C. Gifford, who has passed on in
Wellington (MX.) at 86, was the son of
Rev, Algernon Gifford, the predecessor
of “Grenfell of Labrador” and later first
Anglican parson at Oamaru. The later
Gifford was born at sea, and became one
of the best-known astronomers in MX.
He was associated with Professor Bicker-
ton, of Christchurch, in fostering the
theory of partial impact for the creation
of new stars. Educated at Oamaru and
Cambridge, where he graduated M.A.
and won the Herschel prize for
astronomy, he taught at Waitaki B.H.
School and Christ’s College, Christchurch,
before going to Victoria College, Wel-
lington, as lecturer in mathematics. He
did much exploratory work in the
southern lakes district.
Australian ballet has become an article
of export. The audience at the Granada
Theatre, Clapham, London, signified high
approval of “Sea Legend,” whose choreo-
grapher was Melbourne’s Dorothy
Stevenson. Critics accorded favorable
adjectives to the decor representing huge
seas breaking; it was by the Australian
painter John Bainbridge. There is no-
thing specifically Australian about the
ballet, which had its premiere at the
Princess Theatre, Melbourne, last year,
John Johnston Whyte, Chief of Adel-
aide’s “noble Fire Brigade,” would find it
hard to deny that he likes fire-fighting;
he tried other forms of excitement, but
came back to the helmet and hose. Born
in Scotland 61 years ago, Jock joined the
Black Watch at 17, served three years with
them, then came to Australia and tried his
hand at prospecting in Victoria, New
South Wales and Westralia. In 1912 he
joined the Melbourne Fire Brigade, but
left it to rejoin his old regiment when the
Kaiser’s War broke out. After a couple
of years in France he was transferred to
the Hampshires with a commission, but
when the Armistice came it found him
in the R.A.F. After demobbing he went

Dr. Robert Stevenson Aitken, Regius
Professor of Medicine at Aberdeen Uni-
versity, one of few MX. Rhodes Scholars
to return to their native land, has been
appointed Vice-Chancellor of the Uni-
versity of Otago. He left for England
in 1924 and became the Owen Williams
Research Scholar and Physician at Lon-
don Hospital, The Aberdeen job came
in 1939. Recently he was appointed to
the Regional Hospital Board for north-
east Scotland.

MEDICAL PARATROOPER.
Rugby “blue” of that city’s university, left
Australia on the outbreak of war to join
the R.A.M.C. After 18 months with the
infantry he transferred to the Paratroop
Force on its inauguration. In 1943 he
was back here selecting men for Aus-
tralian paratroops and organising the
medical services of that force. Con-
sidered a suitable dummy, he carried out
numerous test drops to check new Aus-
tralian equipment, all of which, fortu-
nately, he found to be airworthy. He
returned to England in time to drop into
Arnhem with the 133rd Parachute Field
Ambulance. Taken prisoner at Arnhem
he endured 11 p.-0.-w. camps, including
Oflag 79, He didn’t waste time after his
release. He went to Edinburgh, and is
now a Fellow of the Royal College of
Surgeons. His only action against the
Japs was fought in Tokyo in 1934 when,
as a member of the Australian Univer-
sities football team, he gave the Japs a
foretaste of their future defeats on New
Guinea battlefields. The team brought
back a bronze plaque, made in Japan and
still competed for in inter-Varsity games.
“L.H.P.”: A Courtneidge once more
on a Sydney theatre programme recalls
the visit here of Cicely’s father, Robert
Courtneidge, who first appeared in Sydney
on September 10, 1892, as Valentine in
“Faust Up to Date” with the London
Society’s Burlesque Company. Other prin-
cipals were Ted Lonnen, Marion Hood,
Addie Conyers and Alice Leamar. They
toured Australia and New Zealand, and
at Christmas-time went in for pantomime.
Robert appeared both in Sydney and Mel-
bourne as a capital dame in “Red Riding
Hood,” the opening bill at Sydney’s new
Lyceum in 1892. At the same theatre
in 1894 he played a Scotch valet in his
dramatised version of Verne’s Round
the World in Eighty Days, a show
notable for introducing an elephant from
the Moore Park Zoo in the Indian scenes.
He starred for a time in “On ’Change,”
and played with Nellie Stewart in comic
opera and then went home to become
a manager. He was out again in
1903 to produce three Shakspearean
comedies for Musgrove, and in 1920 he
did similar duty for Hugh D. Mclntosh’s
comedy company at the Tivoli. His book,
I Was An Actor Once, pays tribute to
Australian audiences.
A small-ship man, Commander J.
Plunkett-Cole, R.A.N., has assumed com-
mand of frigate Culgoa as senior officer
First Frigate Flotilla. In the last scrap
he commanded four destroyers. Vendetta,
Napier, Norman and Nepal. A nippy
lightweight in his youth, Plunkett-Cole
handles his ship with that casual effi-
ciency and aplomb peculiar to destroyer
captains. On one occasion he swung his
craft in under a fleet-carrier’s stern so
close that his ship’s company could hear
the roar of her fans and the carrier’s
quarter-deck copped the wash from his
screws. He had two big ships during
the war, cruisers Sussex and Canberra,
and was in the latter when the Japs
caught her off Savo Island, August, 1942.
His most important shore job was Com-
mander of the R.A.N. College at Flinders,
where he saw the last snotties of the 13-
year-old scheme accepted—future cadets
will be 17-year-old direct entries. At
time of writing he is headed for New
Guinea to show the flag in Culgoa.
Retiring after 21 years as General
Secretary of the N.S.'W. Country party.
Colonel E. J. Munro, D. 5.0., V.D., has
gone places and seen things during his
career. In the Militia Forces from 1899
and commissioned in 1903, he sailed with
the A.I.F. in 1914 and served on Galli-
poli, in Egypt, the Senussi campaign and
in France and Belgium. By 1918, a
major with a D.S.O. to his credit, he
commanded the A.A.S.C. Training Depot
in Britain, and after the Armistice he was
appointed to Monash’s staff as rail-
transport officer. Back in Australia he
commanded Second Div. A.A.S.C. for
several years, and in 1925 was given leave
of absence to go to New Guinea in
charge of the Ormildah Oil Co.’s expedi-
tion. He went 400 miles up the Sepik
River and did exploration work in parts
not previously visited by white men. In
the second war he was called back from
the reserve list to take charge of First
Div. A.A.S.C., retiring in August, 1941,
with the rank of colonel. In between
times he squeezed in service as com-
missioner of the Boy Scouts, City of
Sydney District, president for nine years
of Manly R.S.L., was a director of the
War Veterans’ Home and a president of
Legacy,
The cry “Hands off the parks” is a live
subject in Adelaide at any time, and no
one rallies more quickly at the call than
Lavington Bonython. “At the present
rate of encroachment the parklands will
disappear entirely unless we are vigilant”
is his contention. Forty years ago he
formed the Parklands Preservation
League, and he has recently revived it.
Forty-seven years in Adelaide’s city
council, he has an impressive municipal
record. At one time he was the “baby”
of the council; now the “father.” At 25
he was a councillor, an alderman at 30
and mayor of Adelaide at 37. As Lord
Mayor in the depression years 1927-30,
he and his lady took an active part in
relief work. Unlike his father, Langdon
Bonython, who represented Barker in the
first Federal Parliament, Lavington never
sought political honors, despite frequent
invitations. For many years he was
associated with his father on the
“Advertiser,” and is now vice-chairman of
the company. He’s 72.
Into the Silence:
In Sydney, at 57, John Livingstone Roberts,
former president of Lane Cove Soldiers’ Club.
In the First World War he won a D.C.M. at
Hargicourt and the M.M. at Villers-Bretonneux.
In Sydney, Alexander James Soutar, of the
Union Steam Ship Company. He joined the
company in 1896 and managed branches at
Devonport (Tas.), Fiji, Newcastle, Melbourne
and Sydney. He retired at the end of 1944,
but was a local director of the company and
of Australian National Airways until a few
months ago.
In Melbourne, at 93, George Lorimer, former
locomotive-running superintendent of the Vic-
torian Railways. He supervised the installation
and trials of the Westinghouse brake.
In Adelaide, at 66, Sidney James Pullman,
former secretary of Port Adelaide and Onka-
paringa Racing Clubs. He was the metro-
politan racing clubs’ representative on the
Betting Control Board, served the P.A.R.C. for
34 years, and Onkaparinga from 1924.
In Adelaide, at 59, Rev. Peter Patrick Mac-
Laren, Chaplain of St. Peter’s College. An
old Saint’s boy, he was appointed master there
when he was 22, took orders in Melbourne
and became Head of Berwick Grammar, then
of All Souls’ Grammar, St. Kilda. He returned
to Saint’s as chaplain in 1924.
In London, at 72, Commander Frederick
Sudell, who skippered P. and O. liners Mon-
golia, Narkunda and Strathmore before the
war. He had many friends in this country.
In Melbourne, at 79, Frank Manzie, head
mechanic for J. C. Williamson at the Princess
Theatre and later with Meynell and Gunn at
the Theatre Royal. He played a big part
in the staging of some of the most lavish shows
Melbourne has seen.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
A vast audience surged into the Town
Hail on Good Friday night to hear Bach’s
wondrous and exalted “Passion of St.
Matthew.” Under the baton of Prof.
Bernard Heinze, the A.B.C. Symphony
Orchestra and the Philharmonic Choir
were at their best. Soprano was Thea
Phillips, whose black velvet gown glit-
tered with a rhinestone neckline. Joan
Jones, the contralto, wore a simple white
crepe gown, which had a draped hipline.
Sydney’s Godfrey Stirling was excellent
as the Evangelist; Robert Payne and
David Allen, the remaining soloists, were
in good voice. The unaccompanied
chorales “O Blessed Jesus,” “ ’Tis I Whose
Sin” and “O Sacred Head” were sung
with fine feeling for reverence. In the
audience were the Lady Mayoress, Mrs.
Bernard Heinze, Dr. Hansen and his
wife, Mrs. Hansen-Dyer, Mrs. Hensman,
of Sydney, Margaret Benson, Mavis
Hotmer and Lieut. Fred McGrath,
R.A.N.V.R.
Lord and Lady Mountevans arrived on
Good Friday morning in the Norwegian
ship Torrens, on which they will live
while in Melbourne. Admiral Lord
Mountevans commanded the Australian
squadron from 1929-31 —he is, of course,
the famous “Evans of the Broke.” Dur-
ing their stay in Australia they hope to
renew the many friendships they made
when they were here before. Although
Lady Mountevans has spent the greater
part of her life in England, she still re-
tains the accent of her birthplace, Oslo.
Twice a year Lady Mountevans goes
home for the ski-ing and a visit to her
family. The Mountevanses have two sons,
Broke, who is in England, and Richard,
who lives in Gothenburg, Sweden —his
five-year-old son is named Broke. Lady
Mountevans is much-travelled —she has
visted China, Japan, South Africa,
Canada and the Argentine. Once she
was shipwrecked off the Irish coast. Her
home is in Cadogan-square, Chelsea.
From Melbourne, Lord and Lady Mount-
evans will go to N.S.W. —they will be
guests of Sir Frederick and Lady Mc-
Master, of Dalkeith.
Work for the Centenary Appeal of the
Royal Melbourne Hospital still goes on
apace. Alice Spowers is busy organising
a children’s party which will be held at
the Toorak home of Mrs. Victor Hurley,
on April 3. The Eric Quirks will con-
duct the Aunt Sally with the help of
nephew Lieut. Bill Spowers; Mrs. lan
Wood is convenor of the cake-stall; the
needlework department will be organised
by Mrs. George Paxton and the Misses
Bullivant and Spowers. A piper and
Scottish dancers, slides t and swings and
an entertainer will make the afternoon a
memorable one for the kiddies. Mrs.
Rupert Fanning will take bookings:
Tel. 8J1555.
Last week had its full issue of excite-
ment for Patricia Tallis. On Thursday
she announced her engagement to George
Kirk at a family dinner-party, and on
Friday she celebrated her twenty-first
birthday. Patricia is the only daughter
of Mr. and Mrs, George C. Tallis, of
Key West, Mornington. George is the
elder son of Mr. and Mrs. George Kirk,
of Armadale.
Cheerfully informal was the party
given by the directors of Collins Pro-
ductions in the Marina Room of the
Australia to celebrate completion of their
first film feature, “Strong Is the Seed,”
and in honor of the stars of the film,
Maree Marsden and Guy Doleman.
Directors Arthur Collins, A. Wainwright
and H. E. Sizer, with their wives, re-
ceived the guests. Mrs. H. E, Sizer wore
a smart beech-brown frock with a beige
crepe drapery outlining the bodice and
skirt; her small brown hat was trimmed
with brown coq feathers. Mrs. Arthur
Collins and Mrs. A. Scrivener wore
smart black outfits. Blonde Maree Mars-
den, who first came into the limelight
with her work at the Little Theatre, was
in white chiffon printed with pastel-pink
flowers; her green-straw halo hat was
embellished with pastel-pink roses. Mrs.
Victor Cornaga and her daughter
Margot wore attractive black frocks, the
former’s enhanced with a bustle. Lorna
Lamb’s green crepe frock was patterned
in cyclamen tulips, her small straw hat
repeating the tulip motif. “Strong I&i the
Seed,” a romantic drama, is based on
the life of William Farrer, especially con-
cerning his development of rustproof
wheat. In private life Maree is Mrs.
Peter Whitehead. Her husband, an
Englishman, is doing a course at the
Dookie Agricultural College.
Coral Browne, who has carved out quite
a niche for herself in England’s theatrical
world, is due in Melbourne tomorrow on
a flying visit to her parents, the L. C.
Brownes, of Kew. Unfortunately
theatre-lovers will have no opportunity
of seeing the actress on stage —it is purely
a holiday jaunt. Norman Hartnell, dress-
maker to Queen Elizabeth, considers
Coral the best-dressed woman on the
London stage, so her friends are anxiously
waiting to see her clothes. For the past
four years Coral has been co-starring in
Firth Shepherd productions with Jack
Buchanan. Her stay in Australia is
limited to a month —after that, back to
England to begin rehearsals for a new
show.
June Wright’s first book, Murder in
the Telephone Exchange, published by
Hutchinson’s, has won selection in the
detective-story section of the United
Nations £lO,OOO literary contest. Four
years of the war period were spent
by June working in Central Ex-
change ; 28 years old, she is the
mother of four children and man-
ages to look after them and run her home
and write thrillers in her spare time.
Hutchinson’s have accepted June’s second
book. Who Would Murder a Baby?

The Food for Britain Appeal and St.
Catherine’s School will share the proceeds
of a dance to be held under the auspices
of St. Catherine’s Old Girls’ Association
at St. Kilda Town Hall on Wednesday,
May 5. Mesdames Gordon Darling and
John Masters with Marigold Myer and
Pat Alexander are ticket secretaries, and
Pat Andrew is once again in charge of
publicity. Jacqueline and Nollie Embling
are organising the group of energetic
workers who will prepare the school crest
of golden and yellow blooms which, with
autumn foliage, will form the decoration
motif. Balloons in the school colors will
add to the festive air/ The committee
have been given many gifts, and these will
be raffled on the night of the dance.
Major and Mrs. Robert Lindsay gave
a dinner-party at their home in Franks-
ton before going on to the Harold
Wrights’ dance at Pine Hill, Frankston.
Mrs. Lindsay’s parents, Sir Robert and
Lady Knox, were there. Guests included
Major and Mrs. George Maxwell and
the David Knoxes. Proceeds were to
aid Food for Britain, and will help
women members of the Frankston Liberal
party maintain the supply of parcels which
are sent regularly to England and Scot-
land. Mrs. E. Hope Pearse is convenor
of the group, which comprises Mesdames
W. Cain, A. Black, Gerard Noall, Ronald
Watt, W. Carr, Geoff Harvey, G. V.
Hirst and H. Matheson. These women
meet every fortnight to pack and dis-
patch parcels, almost 400 of which have
been sent away during the past year.
Every parcel has skeins of wool included
as packing.
Mrs. R. G. Casey, who returned from
England this week, inspired a group of
past students of artist George Bell to
hold a tribute exhibition of paintings in
George’s Gallery recently. Mrs. Casey
was impressed with an exhibition of this
kind while she was visiting Paris, and, as
■a former student of Bell’s, thought it
would be a good idea to hold a similar
showing. Mrs. Casey wrote to a number
of former students and asked them to
submit their work —she also was a con-
tributor to the exhibition. Mrs. H. V.
Evatt, another former George Bell student,
was present at the opening, which was
performed by Daryl Lindsay. After-
wards a cocktail-party in the Gowrie
Room at Menzies was hostessed
by Mrs. Daryl Lindsay, in a black-
wool waist-length jacket, black pleated-
satin skirt and corn-toned off-the-
face hat trimmed with straw bows. Mrs.
George Bell covered her grey-printed
frock with a black-tailored coat. Also
present were Jane Casey, Lieut. Bill
Spowers, Grenadier Guards, who was
A.D.C. to Mr. Casey when he was Gov-
ernor of Bengal, Mrs. and Mrs. Peter
Purves Smith, Mr. and Mrs. Eric Thake,
Mrs. Denistoun Wood and Frances Burke.
From Sydney
Last Saturday more than 91,000
optimists went to the Easter meeting at
Randwick. If the wave of coldness that
engulfed Sydney on Sunday morning had
arrived a day earlier there’d have been
such a “new look” over the place that
old habitues would have passed it by.
But all the fifty-guinea-and-over top-
coats, the furs from Tibet, Siberia or
from back of the Dandenongs, the tailored
suits from Britain remained at home in
their camphorwood boxes, for the sun
winked his bright eye, and threw his
burning and impish glance on the ladies.
Silk frocks, linen suits, wide hats and
glare-glasses were the general wear.
But, of course, everything goes at Rand-
wick. There were clothes with the
French, and voices with the Australian,
accent. There were quills that stabbed
the stratosphere, and soft plumes that
curved down the side of close-fitting hats
almost to the shoulder. There was the
full “new look” skirt that is reminiscent
of the Puritan lass ; there was the even
“newer” one —length without breadth
slightly slit at the hem. Of draped
frocks none was more striking than that
of Mrs. Lionel McFadyen. It combined
grey and deep brown. Its pleated, almost
ankle-length skirt was draped with the
brown. Joan Allen’s blonde good looks
had for foil a trig suit of black woollen,
peplum jaunty, and a black skull hat
burgeoning with coq feathers at the right.
She was with her mother, who wore navy-
and-white silks and a dark-blue hat.
Mrs. John Northcott, wife of the State’s
Governor, had one of the largest lunch-
parties. With daughter Elizabeth she
entertained many Melbourne and Sydney
friends. Among guests from over the
border was Mrs, Chester Manifold, whose
husband is a V.R.C. important. The wife
of Chief Justice Frederick Jordan, in cool
printed silks, was in the group; so were
Mrs. Stephen Roberts and Mrs. John
Power, of Queensland. The wife of
Lieut.-General Berryman wore with her
sleekly-tailored cinnamon-brown suit a
small brown hat at the right of which
snuggled a jade-green wing. Mrs. J. H.
Russell, too, was a guest. With her
white-patterned coral silks she wore a
cool white hat. Mrs. Reg Moses, Mrs.
David Roper and Mrs. Sam Hordern
were others in the party. Mrs. North-
cott’s hat and frock were in tones of hya-
cinth pink. Elizabeth Northcott wore a
flower-trimmed hat with her printed-silk
suit, and Sheila Collett’s suit was of
horizon blue.
Pretty Mrs. John Bovill was there.
Mrs. Bill Adams and Mrs. Marcel Deky-
vere were amongst the smart, the first
in grey, the latter in black. Mrs.
Noel Vincent’s small ,black velvet hat,
worn well to the side, pointed heaven-
wards with a spire-like quill. Margaret
Salenger’s hat of orchid straw was shady
above silks in which mauves and blues
cunningly mingled. Mrs. Joe Coen and
Mrs. Carey wore grey with distinction.
Marie Coen’s frock was black, her hat
large and of natural-colored straw. Add-
ing their brightness to the day were Mrs.
George Christmas, Mrs. Frank Rogers,
Anne Crowley and Elaine Howes.
Among admired suits was that of natural
linen worn by Mrs. Maxwell Allen. Mrs.
C. Ballange renewed acquaintance with
Randwick. The Luxton lady and Mrs.
Harry Taylor were others noted amid the
thousands.
After Randwick, most of Sydney tore
here and there imbibing cocktails or
sherry or fruit drinks. Parties were too
numerous even to be listed. Later
everybody bolted out again—to the
Ballet, to Cicely Courtneidge at the
Royal, or to the danpe. The Tivoli, of
course, was packed for the Ballet, which
opened the programme with everybody’s
sweetheart, “Swan Lake.” Dressing was
very suave and glittersome, and no frock
was more elegant than that of the slim
Chinese lady glimpsed on her way to the
circle. Other well-knowns were the Chic
Bouvets, Mrs. Farley, whose ostriches
grow their feathers royal-blue, judging
by her waist-length cape, Mrs. Florence
Taylor, Annis Parsons, the knight Ben
Fuller couple, and the Girl in the Flat
Opposite, who disliked Death and the
Maiden, shuddering at the vampire twirls
of the cloaks of Death and his grim Min-
isters, and the ghoulish human Black
Maria they formed to carry away the
dead girl.
The well-liked Minister for Norway,
Lars J. Hvinden Jorstad, and his wife
welcomed the new Consul for Norway
and Madame H. J. Hofgaard to Sydney
last week. The welcome took the form
of a cocktail-party in the Australia ball-
room. The guests were very consular,
with a sprinkling of hand-picked locals
from the vicinity of Darling Point and
Bellevue Hill. The hostess, fair and good-
looking Madame Jorstad, wore an ankle-
length black crepe skirt topped by a long
hydrangea-blue blouse swathed at the
hips, its finale a large bustle bow.
Madame Hofgaard’s beige-pink* suit had
a pleated skirt. Her small white felt hat
was upswept from the face.
Dr. Grant Lindeman was there with
his bright-faced wife. Her frock of
black crepe had shilling-size gold but-
tons fastening it from neck to waist. Her
small black hat was feather-swathed. The
Harry Moxham lady brought the very
new look in her black frock and smart
quill-stabbed black hat. Mrs. Bertie
Kelly’s dinner-frock sparkled with opal-
escent sequins. Her new (all the hats at
this party were new) hat had a slightly
mitre architecture softened with ostrich-
fronds, France’s and China’s Consuls and
their wives were present. Canada’s Trade
Commissioner and his wife, the Jimmy
McGregors, Justice Roper and Mrs.
Roper, the Banker McKerihans, the Niels
Storakers, the Chancellor of Sydney Uni-
versity, Stephen Roberts, and Mrs.
Roberts were among those who drank
“skaal” to the Hofgaards. They, inci-
dentally, seem to be under a lucky star.
Mrs. Jorstad had managed to get a house
on Bellevue Hill for them before they
arrived.
This is Betty Spicer, whose soprano
voice is as sparkling as her own bright
self. Betty, who is a pupil of Roland
Foster, has made two journeys to Mel-
bourne since the National Opera Com-
pany commenced its season in the Prin-
cess Theatre there. Betty made quite a
hit some weeks ago with her singing and
acting in the name part of Aida, And last
week she returned for another three-night
season. Melbourne critics and audiences
were full of praise for her work. To sing
the part of Amonasro, Aida’s father,
James * Wilson, another of Roland’s
pupils, went south, also for the second
time. Photograph of Betty is from E. B.
Studios.
After a night with the Aberdeen Angus
Society you begin to feel you know all
about the breed ; the steers, the heifers,
the bulls. For that’s how the chat goes.
Brethren of the society meeting for the
first time murmur cordially: “I feel we
know each other already. Our first bull
came from your herd.” At first the mere
city-dweller may feel ashamed of not
keeping even one A.A. on the front lawn,
but then you console yourself with the
thought that at any rate you appreciate
the steaks.
And were these served de luxe at the
society’s dinner last week! They were
not only vegetable-trimmed, but they
trailed clouds of glory of pipe music. To
the skirl and honey-sweet drone of High-
land music they were handed around. It
was the third occasion of the night that
the pipers in the panoply of plaidie,
and kilt and sporran and all, had been
busy. First they piped in the society’s
popular president and fine host, Gordon
Munro, then the knowledgeable Sir
Joshua Ross Taylor and Walter Bigger
and other very important A.A. chieftains.
This year gay satins and crepes and
the flash of jewels (not synthetic) broke
up the rigid lines of men’s tailorings.
The ladies have established themselves
in the guest-list. Mrs. Clifford Minter’s
jade-green crepes got into the champion
class. Mrs. Lyn Sanderson, whose hus-
band is one of the society’s importants,
wore a good profile and silks with an
opalescent gleam. Tasmania’s vice-presi-
dent Tulloch-Scott entertained a party.
There were Websters from Queensland,
Don Taylors from S. Aus., Williamses and
Tumut Grahams, Rosses of Glen Innes
and the Touts of Young, Newmans of
Anthony’s Lagoon, pretty Helen Row-
lands. Mrs. Graves, of Victoria, smiled
above black-and-white frocking. Nor
can the R.A.S.’s amiable Mr. Sarma
and the Rupert Wilsons, of Oberon,
be overlooked. Rupert and Mrs.
Wilson (who looked very smart
in a dining-out creation that mingled a
floral satin blouse and a long black crepe
skirt), with the help of Morna Condell,
of Orange, composed the very topical
ode that preceded the menu.

This co. is a grower and miller in the
Bundaberg district. The erratic behavior
of profits over the last seven years is due
to seasonal conditions, aggravated by
rising costs and shortages of manpower
and essential materials. Collapse of the
figures in 1942 and 1943 followed flood
damage to crops; then, just as the co.
was getting into its stride again, drought
—one of the most severe experienced in
the Queensland sugar-belt—and damag-
ing winter frosts played havoc with earn-
ings.
Nature was kind last term, when both
cane-crushings and mill output of raws
substantially increased. So, of course, did
earnings, which were also helped by a
rise in the pool price for raws from
£2l 16s. lid. to over £24 a ton. After
allowing an extra £7289 for depreciation
(£15,577) and something for taxation, the
profit was £54,705 (up £52,513), best since
1927. It was 11.1 p.c. on capital as against
0.4, 8.8, 7.1, 0.5, 1.8, 6.9 and 10 p.c. back
to 1940. The div. was lifted from 5 p.c.
to 8 p.c., making the average over the last
seven years a shade more than 5 p.c,,
compared with an average of 9.5 p.c. for
the seven years before that.
Exactly what lies ahead of the industry
is difficult to say at the moment; much
will depend upon costs, still on the up-
grade, and upon the level of the export
price for surplus raws. Thanks largely
to pre-war improvements in cultivation
and milling practices, which increased the
tonnage of cane and yield of sugar per
acre, and to the steady advance in the
export price of raws, the industry has
been able to keep its head above the
rising tide of costs since 1933, when the
retail selling price of fines was reduced
from 4£d. to 4d. a pound.
Now, to relieve the pressure of costs,
made more threatening by introduction
of the 40-hour Week from the beginning
of 1948, |d. a pound has been added to
the retail price of fines, making it 4fd.
again from Dec. 3 last —it is the first rise
in the Australian price of fines since
1920, It means an increase of £4 13s, 4d.
(to £42) a ton, of which 10s. Bd. goes to
the grocer. Is. Bd. to the wholesaler, and
the other £4 Is. to millers and growers ;
but a Government freight subsidy of 10s.
a ton has been withdrawn, leaving
£3 11s, net, which is equal to £3 7s. per
ton of raw sugar.
The net export price of raws (after pay-
ing freight and other charges) rose from
around £A7 a ton pre-war to £A 19-odd
for the 1946 season, and advanced to
over £A2S last year. The figure is ex-
pected to exceed £A29 a ton for 1948.
Owing to reduction in the volume of
exports, these higher prices haven’t meant
all they might to the industry. Britain
has agreed to take Australia’s surplus ex-
portable sugar until end 1949. What will
happen to the export price after that re-
mains to be seen —the Philippines and
Java should begin to make their weight
felt by that time. Imperial preferences
on sugar have not been altered by the
Geneva-Havana negotiations.
During and since the war the industry
has also suffered from shortages of man-
power, fertiliser, tractors and other neces-
sities of production, thus preventing capi-
tal equipment being employed to capa-
city. At the moment, some 2800 more
canecutters alone are needed, and
migrants are being sought for the pur-
pose.
Rehabilitation of the copra plantations
of the subsidiary Malayta Co. in the
Solomon Islands is proceeding “very
slowly,” owing to the shipping, native
labor and materials position. At end
1947, £41,196 had been spent on island
rehabilitation. The position in respect of
claims for war damage has not yet been
cleared up. No hint is given as to when
the marketing of copra is likely to begin.
The 8.5.1. administration is now taking
all copra offering at £35 a ton, less 15
p.c, tax.

porating those of the Malayta Co.;

The year’s growth in liabilities (up
£136,647) and book debts (up £152,063)
are inter-related, being connected mainly
with sugar sales. When the books closed
liabilities (including provision for taxa-
tion) exceeded more or less liquids by
£35,613, an improvement of £32,713 over
the twelvemonth.
At 365. 9d. (335. 6d. a year ago), the
f.-p. pound shares, covered by 325. lOd.
in net tangibles, return 4,3 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div. basis. Existing conditions—a
good season is in prospect—do not suggest
that a drop in the div. is likely.

Few have done as well for their share-
holders as this furnishing, furnishing-
drapery, chinaware and cash-order busi-
ness—it pioneered the cash-order form
of consumer-credit in Sydney. From the
beginning (in 1903) to end 1930 £222,400
of bonus scrip was handed out, and divs.
averaged 18.75 p.c. for the last 18 years
of the period. Then slump reduced capi-
tal requirements, and £174,833 —more
than was originally put up in cash—of
the £329,667 of capital was returned to
shareholders. Another gift issue, one-for-
four, was made in 1935, and divs. aver-
aged 12.6 p.c. for the decade to end 1940.
For the half-dozen war years to end 1945
the average distribution was 13.5 p.c.,
and, again finding itself with more money
than could be conveniently employed
in the business, one-third (£48,500) of
the capital was returned early in 1943,
reducing the figure to £145,500 in f.-p.
15s. shares.
War out of the way, a hungry market
which had been starved of furniture.
furnishings, etc., sent turnover up with
a rush ; and the cash-order section shared
in the expansion, too, despite restrictions
on canvassing and the amount (£10) that
can be issued to any single customer at
one time. The net result was a leap of
£11,779 in the 1946 profit figure, lifting
it to £33,114, and the div, was raised
from 15 p.c. to 18.3 p.c.
Last term there was “considerable im-
provement in furniture sales and general
turnover.” But rising costs, accelerated
by introduction of the 40-hour week in
July last, together with shortage of skilled
labor and materials and further price
regulations restricting the margin of gross
profit, made off with all but a trifle of the
gain. After allowing for depreciation,
taxation and other contingencies, the net
result (£33,430) was only £316 better.
Still, it was 23 p.c, on capital compared
with 22.8, 14.6, 12.4 and 11 p.c. for the
four preceding years. The div. remained
at 18.3 p.c., £lOOO was sent to the staff
fund, and the remainder lifted reserves
to £209,503, or £64,003 in excess of paid
capital. Of the reserves 42.2 p.c. were
used in the business as against 23.9 p.c.
at the previous balance.
As for the outlook, the big home and
other construction programme, slowly
getting under way, and deferred replace-
ment requirements augur well for de-
mand, provided 'rising costs don’t price
goods out of the market. What will
happen when sales begin to recede from
peak levels is largely in the hands of the
price-fixing authority. Owing to the
rigidity of costs, any substantial drop in
sales will be reflected in a more than pro-
portionate decline in net earnings, unless
the Prices Commissioner reverses the
present policy of progressively paring
gross margins—a form of profit-control.
There is nothing to worry about in
the financial set-up:

The year’s addition of £17,393 to fixed
assets was mainly on account of recon-
struction of Gordon House, the co.’s
headquarters in George-street, Sydney.
To meet the outlay, add £12,062 to stocks
and £31,162 to hire agreements, the board
drew upon cash and Government securi-
ties for £40,109 and leant upon sundry
creditors, etc., for a further £10,691.
There was a drop of £11,637 in the more
or less liquid surplus (£254, owing
to expenditure on fixed assets.
The market prices the scrip at 575., at
which figure the return is 4.8 p.c. on an
18.3 p.c. div. basis, or approx. 4 p.c.
should the distribution drop to 15 p.c.
Net tangible cover is visibly 365. 7d. per

Activities of this big 85-year-old London-
controlled pastoral, pastoral-finance and
woolbroking business are confined mainly
to the three Eastern States in Australia,
where the co. is a big run owned on its
own account; it also has some interests
in the Argentine. Well advised and
strongly-ribbed financially, the co. was
a remarkably good dividend-payer until
slump in the early 1930’s knocked the
bottom out of both interest rates and
prices and sent the Australian pound to
a discount in London.
Since then exchange, low Interest rates,
rising costs and taxation—the two last-
mentioned fanned by war and other in-
flationary influences—have stood in the
way of any fatness in earnings. For 23
years to end 1939 divs. averaged 12.6
p.c.; for the seven years to end 1936
the average was 2.2 p.c,, and for the 11
years to the close of last accounts a
wink under 6 p.c. Any alteration of the
Australian-sterling exchange rate which
brought the two currencies more into
line with one another would greatly en-
hance dividend prospects.
Drought in the outback of N. S. Wales
and Queensland shrivelled net earnings
in 1945 ; recovery in the following year’s
figures was largely the result of adjust-
ments connected with taxation. The next
table, showing sheep populations in N.
S, Wales and Queensland, helps to ex-
plain what happened:
March, March, March, March,
1943. 1945. 1946. 1947.

Queensland .. 25,650 21,292 18,944 16,084
Still, the co. handled an extra 7156 bales
of wool last season (203,973 bales in
all), and growers generally received
record cheques. Average price per pound
(greasy and scoured combined) for the
Commonwealth was 25.15 d., or 56.3 p.c
more than for the previous year, and
sheep and cattle prices shot up, too.
After paying debenture interest
(£66,446), and allowing for taxation
(£50,000) and other contingencies, net
earnings benefited by £31,447, reaching
£93,463, equal to 6.6 p.c. on capital as
against 4.4, 0.9, and 4 p.c. for the three
preceding years. The div. was kept at a
nominal 8 p.c., which English income-
tax of 9s. in the £ reduces to 4.4 p.c.
(sterling) in the hands of shareholders —
the register is kept in London.
Favorable seasonal conditions and a
further rise in the price of wool and live-
stock favor a still better showing at next
balance. For eight months to end Feb.
wool averaged 38.62 d. a pound, an in-
crease of 53.6 p.c. over the 1946-47 figure.
Wool prices, however, now appear to
have gone over the top of the hill, tem-
porarily, at any rate. There was an all-
round recession in bids at Perth last week,
the drop being as much as 20 p.c. for
some classes.
During the year assets were revalued,
other inner reserves disclosed, and, in
conformity with the new English Com-
panies Act, assets and liabilities (hitherto
shown at par) have been converted into
sterling at current rates of exchange.
Briefly, results were that reserves were
drawn upon for £368,136 to cover ex-
change on net assets, and £316,567 of
inner reserves were shaken out. These
are book-entries that do not affect earn-
ing capacity one way or the other, but
give shareholders a clearer picture of the
net position. The £40,637 written off to
cover transfer of funds to London during
the year is a tangible reduction.
Too much notice therefore need not
be taken of movements in balance-sheet
figures:

Outstanding feature of the table is the
comfortable state of finances —the co.
is well equipped to further assist clients
when the need arises, as the large hold-
ing of Government securities, cash, etc.,
shows. Some of the co.’s properties in
N. S. Wales and Queensland are due for
resumption for closer settlement, and the

The British Labour Minister, in intro-
ducing the “1946 Assurance Companies
Act,” stated that “The 1946 Act”: —
“Acknowledges the inherently in-
ternational and comprehensive char-
acter of insurance.”
The Labour President of the Board of
Trade in the House of Commons also
stated that it would be proper to inform
the House of the attitude of the Labour
Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, he
stated, had no intention of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business
by private enterprise. It is, he stated,
the desire of the Government that Insur-
ance should be, in the future, as in the
past, dealt with on an international basis
and as business of an international
character.

The Tides
of Business
WITH our harbours full of ships
waiting to be loaded, we see
afresh how greatly dependent we
are on world trade and how
much we suffer when the
vehicles of it go awry.
Ships are the links between
Australia and her customers.
They go "round the world and
back again” so that the tides of
business may flow smoothly.
Banking is like Shipping in that
it, too, helps to keep the tides of
business flowing smoothly.
A Bank, like a ship, prospers
only when it gives good service
to those who use it.

King Island Scheelite
King Island Scheelite (1947),
Ltd., has bought the undertaking
of King Island Scheelite, N.L.,
as from end November, 1947,
for £439,741, payable cash
£252,241 and the balance
(£187,500) in 750,000 f.-p. ss.
shares. The new co. kicks off
with a paid capital of £500,000
in 2,000,000 ss. shares, of which
1,250,000 (underwritten at 2£d.
each) were issued for cash
(£312,500), leaving it with
£60,259 to cover brokerage
(£12,117), preliminary exes., ad-
ditions to plant, etc.
The old co.’s balance-sheet
at end October, 1947, shows
that the new co. will take over
the following assets and liabili-
ties :
Fixed assets—
Mine .. ..£136,218
Plant .. .. 458,406
Housing ~ .. 50,145
£644,769

Less current liabilities —
Overdraft .. .. £47,459
Creditors .. .. • 9,726
57,485
Net assets .. ..£700,575
A debt of £492,567 to the
Commonwealth Government has
been met by a cash payment
of £252,241 in full settlement
under agreement. Chief earning
assets are, of course, mine and
mill. The mine is an opencut
proposition on King Island, Bass
Strait, with 3,091,028 tons ore
proved above sea-level at end
Oct. Average grade of mill feed
to date is 0.65 p.c. WO3. A new
flotation unit was added to the
existing gravity mill in August
last. This is expected to lift re-
coveries from around 50 p.c. to
about 85 p.c. On the basis of a
75 p.c, recovery and a throughput
of 120,000 tons average-grade
ore, a net profit of £llO,OOO (22
p.c. on capital) is expected with
wolfram at £A6 a unit. Recent
quotes for wolfram in London
and New York were £S6 13s. 2d.
and $3O a unit —the dollar figure
is subject to import duty. As a
strategic mineral 20 p.c. of the
profit from scheelite mining is
exempt from Australian income
tax.
Last year the old co, handled
113,441 tons of barren over-
burden and treated 128,628 tons
ore for 612.98 tons of 64.7 p.c.
concentrates. The new flotation
machine dealt with slime mate-
rials for only the last quarter of
the term. A total of 680 tons
average-grade concentrates was
sold at an average price of
£5 Bs. Id. per unit for a net
profit of £56,626, which was
used in the business. The year’s
outlay on new plant and build-
ing was £101,232, of which
£76,522 was met out of profits
and bank overdraft and the bal-
ance from a refund by the Gov-
ernment against loan account.
From June, 1938, when it be-
gan, to February, 1944, the old
co. made profits aggregating
£146,788, and paid divs. totalling
£46,875 (3s. 9d. a share), the
balance went into plant, etc.
Then war made scheelite a
a strategic mineral, and, to en-
large and hasten production, the
Federal Government made sub-
stantial advances to the co. The
money was spent on plant, etc.,
under war-time conditions, and
to which a good deal of deteri-
oration and adjustment was
necessary before satisfactory
performance was obtained. The
financial load proved too heavy a
burden to profitably carry under
post-war conditions, and the
board successfully negotiated
liquidation of the Government
debt on the favorable terms
already mentioned.
The old co.’s remaining asset
is now 750,000 f.-p. shares in
the new co., which are to be dis-
tributed among those on the old
register, three-for-one. The old
shares are on offer at 17s. in
the market.
Barring unforeseen difficulties,
New Guinea Goldfields, Ltd,,
expects operations to reach a
profit-earning scale before the
end of this year. For the 12
months to end Sept, last a loss
of £3045 was recorded, reducing
p. and 1. credit to £219,009. Re-
habilitation work has been de-
layed by irregular and inade-
quate shipping, shortage of
native labor and of essential
materials and supplies, and bad
state of roads and bridges all
the way from Lae to Wau (New
Guinea), where the co.’s hold-
ings are. A full-scale attack on
the producing faces at Koranga
joint workings—Koranga Gold
Sluicing is the other partner —
awaits completion of the race
from Big Wau to Little Wau
creeks. Interruption of road
transport held up resumption of
sluicing at Edie Creek, and driv-
ing of the new adit at Golden
Ridges has been postponed until
road repairs are complete and
enough native labor is available.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Whistling for a
Whistler.
The only interesting thing
about Whistler’s “Nocturne in
Silver and Grey,” bought in
London at £6OO for the N. S.
Wales National Gallery and
"now on view, is) that it does not
exist. Consisting of a large area
of dark and muddy paint, dotted
by three or four pinpoints of
color, it strikingly resembles the
celebrated portrait of a black cat
in a coal-cellar at midnight.
With a certain amount of
benevolence one may reconstruct
a particularly greasy streak as
the river Thames, dark shapes
are more recognisable as build-
ings, and the dots of color are
indubitably street-lamps. If it
once had qualities of luminosity
and mystery, these have faded ;
but it appears to have been
painted on a thoroughly unpaint-
able evening in a fit of the
blackest gloom. Walter
Greaves’s “Grey Day, Batter-
sea,” though under Whistler in-
fluence and almost equally
dingy, is a far better painting ;
being, at least, visible.
With Sickert’s almost-invisible
“Self Portrait” alongside, the
pictures, which cost in the
aggregate round about £l5OO,
look distressingly like a dealer’s
job-lot: the sort of things that
are bought by collectors anxious
to have any scrap of canvas,
however' worthless, by an ac-
credited “name.” As works of
art to delight the public and in-
form the student the Whistler
and the Sickert, at any rate, are
useless. Until it can afford to
compete with American million-
aires, the Gallery might as well
whistle for a good Whistler. Its
money would be far better spent
in acquiring Australia’s best.
Investigations, incidentally, are
still going on into the authen-
ticity of the Gallery’s alleged
Gauguin. It appears to have
been signed, with initials only,
over the varnish: an unusual
proceeding. _
Melbourne National Gallery
revived its pre-war custom of
supplying music with its pictures
last week when the Melbourne
Sinfonietta, under Verdon Wil-
liams’s baton, presented their
well-matched tones in front of
the well-matched tones of the
Titian and the Tintoretto in an
excellent rendering of the Fuga
Ricercare from Bach’s Musical
Offering and Mozart’s Serenata
Notturna. Violinist Willem
Noske followed with a thought-
ful interpretation of Haydn’s C
major violin concerto. Inci-
dentally, just as a pianist or a
violinist is the executant of the
work of a composer, so light is
the executant of the work of a
painter, and it could be noticed
that the gallery’s acoustics were
superior to its illumination.
Ballet Rambert.
“Swan Lake” (Act 2), re-
peated in the current Ballet
Rambert programme at Sydney
Tiv., is a much better perform-
ance than the one with which
the company opened its season.
Belinda Wright adds warmth
and emotion to her beautiful
bird-like speed and precision,
and Miro Zloch, although not
as satisfying as was Walter Gore
in the earlier performance, turns
in his best dancing of the sea-
son. John Gilpin makes a spec-
tacular repetition of his brilliant
dancing in the pas de trois.
Gilpin and Miss Wright have
much in common —both are
young, both are extra-
ordinary dancers and both have
a certain dramatic immaturity.
They were seen at their
best in the glittering “Bluebird”
AT THE BALLET.
Paula Hinton, Sally Gilmour, Walter Gore, Sara Luzita, John Gilpin and Harry Cardwell
in sundry goings-on at Sydney Tiv.
pas de deux from “Aurora’s
Wedding,” where dancing and
nothing else was demanded of
them. Brief as the item was, the
company has not presented any
other display of dancing to sur-
pass it. Miss Wright’s) dancing
as the Sugar-plum Fairy in
“Casse Noisette” was the best
thing in that gaudy confection,
and she, with the possible ex-
ception of Sara Luzita, was the
only one in “Les Sylphides”
who really caught the haunting
loveliness of that piece. Her
immaturity is noticeable in “The
Swan Lake,” where, although
she dances with technical excel-
lence and feeling, she falls a little
short in the displays of im-
periousness required of the
Swan Princess. At times she
attains, either by accident or in-
tent, a certain elf-like quaint-
ness, an air she will have to
shake off or control if she is to
develop any considerable dra-
matic strength.
Gilpin appears to have no bad
dancing or acting habits —simply
a lack of dramatic development,
which is not surprising at 18.
In “The Bluebird,” as Mercury
in “The Planets,” in “The Swan
Lake” and other ballets his
agility, lightness and elevation
have been almost startling;
when and if he acquires dra-
matic expression he should out-
strip anyone in the present com-
pany and, possibly, elsewhere.
The perfect ballet-dancer —one
with the right build, the right
musical and artistic sense and
with sufficient dancing and his-
trionic ability to range from
comedy to tragedy—is scarcer
than quintuplets, and practically
every company has to rely on
a team giving it sufficient com-
posite ability to run the gamut
of ballet. Madame Rambert
manages very well. She has
Sally Gilmour and Walter Gore,
who make a creditable approach
to the ideal, Belinda Wright and
John Gilpin coming up behind
them, and several others, includ-
ing Sara Luzita, Brenda Ham-
lyn and Joyce Graeme, handling
their particular specialities very
well.
The company excels in the
lightly humorous ballets
“Facade,” “Soiree Musicale,”
“Czernyana,” “Gala Perform-
ance,” “Bar aux Folies
Bergere” and Walter Gore’s
“Simple Symphony” and
“Mr. Punch.” (It is interesting
to note that the Borovanskys,
mainly through the efforts of
Martin Rubinstein and Boro,
himself, danced an even better
“Facade” than the Ramberts,
for whom the ballet was writ-
ten.) In romantic classics such
as “Giselle,” “Swan Lake” and
“Sylphides” the company seems
to have a too workman-
like approach, although, in
view of the vast improvement in
their second performance of
“Swan Lake,” it would be in-
teresting to see them repeat the
other two. Their only essay into
exotic spectacle has been “Casse
Noisette,” a diverting confection
of dances in a gaudy rather than
brilliant setting.
Comparatively modern ballets
have been performed with mixed
success. “Czernyana,” on
the present programme, seems
closely related to “Facade,”
although it is more an impres-
sion of ballet than a burlesque
of it. Some of it runs close to
“modernism,” but it has the sav-
ing graces of humor and beauty.
“The Planets,” particularly in
the first scene, suffers to some
extent from a fault common to
a good deal of contemporary
ballet; it has too much pose and
gesture and insufficient dancing.
The second scene (Mars) was re-
deemed by the spectacle and the
dancing of Walter Gore; the
third (Mercury) by Gilpin’s
dancing ; while the fourth, and
best, is completely satisfying
and was danced near enough to
perfection by Joyce Graeme,
with Harry Cordwell, Barbara
Grimes and Pamela Vincent as
Neptune and its satellites.
The Ramberts missed the ro-
mantic mood of “Jardin aux
Lilas” and had little to aim at
with Andree Howard’s “The
Fugitive”—what a contrast to
the same choreographer’s “Lady
Into Fox,” Miss Howard’s
“Death and the Maiden” on the
current programme is better,
but, although Brenda Hamlyn
dances it effectively enough, it is
impossible not to feel that Miss
Howard wrote the piece with
herself in mind and that only
she could give it full expression.
The Ramberts are presenting
two more programmes in Sydney
—“The Sailor’s Return” and
“Casse Noisette” on April 10
and “Plaisance,” “Lady Into
Fox,” “Spectre de la Rose” and
“Bar aux Folies Bergere” on
April 24. “Lady Into Fox,” of
course, is the most interesting
and successful item on the reper-
toire the company has shown to
Sydney, and also gives Sally Gil-
mour every opportunity to show
what a superb little dancer and
actress she is. The “Folies
Bergere” piece is also worth a
couple of visits, and it will be
interesting to see how the com-
pany manages “Spectre de la
Rose,” one of the simplest and
yet most difficult of all ballets.
At the Films.
Charles Boyer, less suave and
acting better than usual, intro-
duces three loves in almost as
many minutes in “A Woman’s
Vengeance,” an adaptation of
Aldous Huxley’s short - story
“The Gioconda Smile,” at Syd-
ney Lyceum, Though Ann
Blyth’s feeling for a man as old
as her father is as improbable as
Jessica Tandy’s love for thunder-
storms, the picture is restrained
drama of excellent standard.
Doctor Cedric Hardwicke and
Jessica Tandy, as the woman
scorned, together act a scene that
reaches an arresting climax
when the poisoner mixes the doc-
tor’s drink. The screen version
does Huxley’s story full justice,
particularly when Boyer fare-
wells his wife in the condemned
cell.
* * * *
Containing much rigor mortis,
a motive wrapped in bundles of
50 and an assortment of hip-
pocket heavy artillery, “Saigon,
at Sydney Prince Edward, deals
with “The Paris of the Orient,”
a town which, according to
travel-folders, has Eastern mys-
ticism on the face of every coco-
nut. But Hollywood makes the
place a dull one. Teak-like to
the end, Alan Ladd even
handled the final barrage with
detached boredom, netting pro-
found “Ho-hums” from the few
diehards still awake.
* * * *
Largest grins observed lately
were seen emerging from
“It Had To Be You” at Sydney
State. Ginger Rogers turns in
a nice performance as a young
heiress addicted to leaving enr
at the altar, and Ron Randell,
the fourth thus dumped, de-
serves a better fate. The s ory
presents a character hterallv
stepping out of someone s im-
agination. Cornel Wilde is the
figment and acts like one.

The Hon, Robert Boyle was the man who formulated
the theory on which all chemical reasoning is based—namely,
that an element is the simplest form of matter, and cannot be
resolved into other substances. He first stated his theory in
a treatise entitled “The Sceptical Chymist.” published in 1661.
Before that time, scientists had clung to' Aristotle’s hypothesis,
dating back to the fourth century 8.C., that the four
“elements" were fire, water, earth and air, and that all matter
consisted of these in different proportions. Boyle’s apprecia-
tion of the true nature of an element changed the whole trend
of scientific thought.
Son of the Earl of Cork, he was born at Lismore Castle, in
Ireland, in 1627. At the age of eight, he was sent to school
at Eton. Thence he proceeded to Oxford, and spent much of
the rest of his life at the university carrying out scientific work
which covered a vast field. Amongst his achievements were
the invention of the first efficient air pump, the preparation of
methyl alcohol from wood, and the propounding of Boyle's
Law, which is still used to describe how the volume of a
gas varies with pressure. Before Boyle’s time, chemistry
was the happy hunting ground of the quack physician and
alchemist. His work at Oxford raised it to
the status of a dignified branch of natural
science. It is not without good reason, there-
fore, that Robert Boyle is regarded through-
out the world as “the father of chemistry.”

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
According to official figures there
were 91,500 people present at Rand-
wick on Saturday. This scribe is
prepared to swear that there were
91,501, and that he took a horrible
hiding.
A fine course for the usual run
of meetings, Randwick is totally in-
adequate for that sort of a crowd.
Bottlenecks of crushed humanity form
all over the shop, the betting-rings
become a too-frequently fair-dinkum
battlefield, and the circular tote build-
ing in the paddock, with its emanating
queues, gives a fair imitation of an
octopus strangling all movement in
the area.
War-time crowds included, it was
the biggest attendance Randwick has
had since a few hundred more
squeezed in to witness a Eurythmic-
Beauford duel at the same meeting
26 years ago. Tote turnover was an
outright record of £232,427.
A curiosity of the particularly open
Doncaster field was the absence of
the usual quota of recognised front-
mnners; the job of pacemaker was
taken on by the rank outsider Royal
Raider. He held the lead till they’d
turned for home, then dropped back
rapidly, interfering with several run-
ners as the bunched field swooped
down to a thrilling finish. Coming on
the outside, The Diver (G. Moore)
won narrowly from Fine Fettle and
Murray Stream with Jean Buzzard
fourth. Favorite Money Moon found
the weight too great; Beau Robert,
finishing sixth, did the best of the
several well-fancied three-year-olds;
Titanic ran an unaccountably shock-
ing race.
The Diver is a five-year-old bay
gelding by The Buzzard from Land
and Sea and is trained by T. J. Bros-
nan. Starting at 9 to 1, about sixth
in the betting order, he was moder-
ately well backed but certainly didn’t
justify the priceless guff headlined in
a Sunday paper “Books Wept As
Diver Did It.” The Diver is owned
by paddock bookie A. Wolfensberger.
The field for the A.J.C. St. Leger,
in order of favoritism, was Fresh
Boy, Lungi, Conductor, Sovereign and
Cronides. Lungi’s stablemate Cronides,
starting at 25 to 1, made an exhibition
of them —or, possibly closer to the
truth, H. Badger made an exhibition
of other riders. Early in the long
trip, Badger set out for a big lead;
of the other riders, only G. Moore
on Sovereign seemed to sense danger
and hustled his mount along in pur-
suit, but Sovereign couldn’t stick the
pace. Round the back of the course
they were spread out over nearly a
furlong with Sovereign a dozen
lengths behind the bolter and nearly
as far in front of the others. Cronides
led‘into the straight by ten lengths;
game little Fresh Boy tried to fridge
the gap, but it, and the weight, was
too much. Three lengths was as
close as Fresh Boy could get, Con-
ductor being third five lengths further
back.
F. P. Cruttenden and E. A. Under-
wood, who jointly own Cronides, had
the rare experience this year of land-
ing the double of V.R.C. and A.J.C.
St. Legers with different horses, Lungi
taking the southern classic. A great
advertisement for E. A. Underwood’s
Warlaby Stud, where stand Dhoti,
sire of Lungi, and Helios, sire of
Cronides.
Cronides is an interesting classic
winner in that his cosmopolitan
pedigree combines blood from Eng-
land, France, America and Australia.
His dam, Heroic Line, was Australian-
bred. His sire, Helios, is by the lead-
ing English sire Hyperion. Foxy Gal,
the dam of Helios, was bred in the
U.S.A., and both her parents were
importations from France.
Proving once again that Breeders’
Plate form is very good form to fol-
low, this year’s Plate winner, Rip-
tide, had an effortless runaway win
in the Sires’ Produce Stakes. In front
all the way, he was five lengths clear,
and being hard held, at the finish
to beat Dynamite and the Dhoti colt
Bengal.
Riptide is a brown colt by Mid-
stream from the Pentheus mare
Kamilaroy. He has proved a good
buy at the 2600 guineas he cost as
a yearling, three wins from four starts
having already yielded over £5OOO in
prize-money. Racing has, in a short
space, been very kind to A. T. Mc-
Lauchlan, who owns Riptide; only
a couple of years back he swept the
two-year-old classics and both Derbys
with Magnificent. His trainer, A. S.
Croall, thinks Riptide a much better
horse than was Magnificent.
As surely as Breeders’ Plate form
is good form, current Sydney wi.a.
form is hopeless form to try to
follow. The 12-furlongs Autumn
Stakes was a dull affair with
Columnist (H. Badger) beating Silent
and Paktong. The previous week
Columnist ran stone last in a 10-
furlongs w.f.a. event and the week
prior to that he won over nine fur-
longs.
In other events at Randwick, the
Genetout filly Respond accounted for
a bunch of three-year-old filjies over
seven furlongs, Tilston (A. Breasley),
at 25 to 1, took the Vaucluse Handi-
cap of the same distance and the
three-year-old colt Stamen (N. Sell-
wood) won the 10-furlongs Tocal
Handicap.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
The small punter (who lasts the
longest), content with a modest profit,
could have put in a pleasant after-
noon despite the showery weather at
Mentone on Saturday, by backing
favorites on the place tote. For
straight-out punters, and particularly
the big ones, the day was sheer mur-
der. From eight events one favorite
(at odds-on) was successful; the other
seven filled minor places.
The Ascot Thousand over six fur-
longs was in the nature of a gift for
Chanak (W. Williamson). Starting
at a shade of odds-on, he lumped 9.7
to down Broadcast and Carnage.
Essentially a sprinter, Chanak is, as
such, one of the very best three-
year-olds racing. The win was his
fifteenth and brought his stake earn-
ings to well over £12,000.
After a bit of a break in his run
of two-year-old successes trainer F. W.
Hoysted is evidently back on the
beam. He notched up his 14th juve-
nile success of the season when the
Helios colt Garugal (iV. Williamson)
tossed favorite Derrymore and St.
Syce in the second Canterbury Handi-
cap of six furlongs. Earlier the first
division was won by Mountfield (E.
Johnston) —a particularly good effort
since the Solar Bear colt was left
badly at the start, but picked up, to
defeat Raysun by a couple of lengths.
Considering the tiring 13-furlongs
trip left behind him, Lord Cavil (L.
Francis) found a remarkable burst
of speed at the finish of the Bristol
Handicap; he downed Steadmond by
half a dozen lengths with Pride of
Devon third. Shorter by three fur-
longs the Winchester Handicap saw
Nagation (J. Gilmore) lucky to
squeeze through an extremely small
gap on the rails and beat Clatterbag
and Robert Bruce.
The handicapper did an excellent
job in sizing up the field of three-
year-olds contesting the mile Exeter
Handicap. Seven of the dozen run-
ners hit the finish in a close-packed
bunch; the camera gave it to Varia-
tion (G. Bougoure) with Saxonian and
Portolitha in the places. It is sur-
prising that the authorities should
have accepted such similar names as
Saxony and Saxonian for two horses
of the same age; both ran in the
Exeter. Completing the Mentone pro-
gramme, De Vinci (R. Watts) won
the Glenelg Hurdle and Sir Archibald
(W. Richards) the mile Scarborough
Handicap.
* * * *
Run over the Randwick two-miles
course on Mjnday, the Sydney Cup
was won by the Queenslander Dark
Marne, from topweight Columnist and
the Victorian three-year-old Lungi.
Melbourne Cup-winner Hiraji broke
down. The seven-furlongs Wentworth
Handicap for colts and geldings went
to Roman Step, defeating Gallipoli
and Partando in a close finish, and
the corresponding Easter Handicap
for fillies was won nicely by Sheba,
downing Whistling Wind and the
consistent minor-placegetter Matinee.
Heroic Sovereign just got there from
Deep Sea and Brazier in the C. W.
Cropper Handicap, cutting out the
six furlongs in 1.11.
* * * *
At Flemington on Monday Promise
You landed the 13-furlongs Easter
Cup, with Manakau and Deen Devon
in the places. Flemish surprised by
leading all the way to defeat St. Fairy
and Chanak in the mile J. J, Liston
Stakes.

Still swinging his axe with the best
in the land at Sydney Show, Leo
Appo, surely one of the most re-
markable performers in any sport
anywhere. Present Bulletin writer
admits to 52 summers, and he was
younger than Leo by a bit at school
and going after bees’-nests together
on Sundays. Leo these days has a
stretch of bananas a mile or so out-
side Coffs Harbor, on the North
Coast; a place he earned for himself
with the axe in show-ring chopping
and cleared for himself with the axe,
too —not that axe; he wouldn’t take
fifty quid for that one.

Blessed with a bit better weather
this time than they struck last year,
the Oxford-Cambridge Jboat-race saw
spots knocked off the record for the
famous paddle, Cambridge winning by
five lengths in 17m. 50sec. Cam-
bridge, which has now won 50 of the
94 races rowed, set the previous
record of 18min. 3sec. in 1934. There
were Australians in both crews this
time; Geelong College had an old
boy in each.

“Long-leg”: In three trips to Eng-
land with Australian Xls Charlie
Turner took 314 wickets, av. 11.12
(1888), 215, av. 12.67 (1890) and 160,
av. 13.76 (1893), and in each topped
the averages. It has not been equalled
by any other Australian. Spofforth
took more wickets —357 in 1878,
391 in 1880 and 188 in 1882, but he
didn’t head the averages.

Over 40 years ago John Wren sent
Bill Squires to California to fight for
the heavyweight championship.
Memories of the great Australian pugs
of the ’nineties were still vivid in
America, and Bill got a match for
the title, with the French-Canadian
known as “Tommy Burns,” without
having to show his mettle in the ring.
But he was muscle-bound and slow
and was a dud at in-fighting, nor
would he consent to learn anything
about it. As he advanced ponder-
ously on “Burns” that worthy gave
him a quizzical look, grinned at his
seconds, and knocked Bill kicking
with a couple of punches. Now
another “Tommy Burns,” from the
Wren stable, has had visions of
fighting in America for the welter-
weight championship, the holder of
which is a negro, Ray Robinson, a
killer, “Burns” has been boomed,
not only as a great fighter, but as
a glamor boy and a movie star,
though in a photograph taken, in-
cautiously on his part, with a couple
of beach girls, who towered over him,
he hardly looked a Great Lover, As a
dress-rehearsal for his bout with
Robinson, he took on in Sydney an
American, Benny Evans, 10 years
older and described by a Yank in-
terested in the Robinson match as
“a 14th-rate bum who earned his
living boxing in dime joints.” “Bum”
or not, Evans got all over “Burns,”
who as an in-fighter proved to be
another Squires, and so the Robinson
affair is “off.” Could “Griffo,”
George Dawson or even Jim Barrow
revisit the glimpses of Sydney boxing
halls he would whip any three light-
weights or welters in the same ring.
Boxing in these parts is one of the
forgotten arts.
« ♦ ♦ ♦
Defeat of Burns By a pug of
Evans’s standing in the States was
one pretty deadly comment on the
present standard of boxing in Aus-
tralia. There was another from
America, where Dawson, far too good
for Patrick or anyone else in sight
round these parts, was beaten by one
Johnny Williams, virtually an un-
known.

Having his first fight for many
months at Leichhardt, Ted Sprouster
scaled 9.2 against Ray Coleman’s
8.12. Apart from the advantage in
tonnage, Sprouster carried far too
many guns, most of ’em on the port
side, though it was a starboard right
upper that nearly settled Coleman in
the seventh. By the 10th Coleman
had had enough for the evenmg;
Sprouster on a t.k.o.

Jack Dempsey has pointed out
which most overlook in
reference to the next Louis-Walcott
encounter that if Louis is no
chicken, neither is Walcott; in fact,
Walcott is older than Louis. In
Dempsey’s view what went against
Louis in the last scrap was the same
thing that counted here against Vic
Patrick too long between fights.
Walcott had kept in form by real
fights; Louis hadn’t. Dempsey’s
summing up on Walcott: “No great
heavyweight, but a pretty fair fighter.”

sources at the present time. The
cost of war itself, in materials,
money and manpower, was
heavy, and industrial discipline
and morale were to an extent
inevitable casualties; but Com-
munism has been the chief fac-
tor in the perpetuation of war’s
various wounds, though, of
course, when one talks of Com-
munism it is hard to separate it
from Chifleyism, even if the
association rises as much from
omissions as from commission.
Chifleyism leaves us with un-
hindered Communist industrial
and financial sabotage. More
directly, it has imposed upon us
heavy and restrictive taxation
and an overgrown army of un-
productive civil servants, with its
inflated departments and
“boards”; all of this stands in
the way of a full and efficient
effort by private industry, the
greatest productive force in the
land, which is -often deliberately
interfered with by Government
competition that aims at an
eventual monopoly. The Gov-
ernment airlines and the pro-
posed nationalisation of banking
are illustrative of this side of
the picture.
The Canberra wastage of
money and manpower will have
to be dealt with as a political
issue, and a very serious one.
The State interference with
transport through various taxes
and restrictions should also be
removed, transport being almost
as important as production it-
self, and the bolstering-up of in-
efficient railway systems by
hindering road and aerial trans-
port being bound to slow down
the whole industrial tempo of
the country.
Freed and organised for the
effort, Australian industry has a
great job immediately ahead of
it. At many times in the past
public men and the press have
felt impelled to speak of the op-
portunity for developing this
country’s resources; but there
has never been an opportunity
as promising as that which exists
before us now, provided we are
politically and industrially
rational enough to rise to the
occasion. The Empire may soon
benefit, on the dollar side, from
the operation of the Marshall
Plan, which will at least help to
relieve the strain on Britain.
But political and industrial prob-
lems in Australia we shall have
to settle ourselves. And that calls
for the settling of Canberra
“Labor’s” hash with the greatest
expedition possible.
Freighters, Ltd.
Freighters, Ltd., of Mel-
bourne, was negotiating last
October to buy 10 acres of land
at Bankstown (near Sydney) to
erect a branch factory. Now it
announces that a ready-made
factory has been secured at
Turella by buying up all the
shares in British Electric Pro-
ducts Pty. The latter company,
registered in 1938 to make elec-
trical appliances, had £9737 of
paid capital last June, but the
cost to Freighters hasn’t been
disclosed.
It is barely two years since
Freighters was formed to acquire
and expand the McGrath Trailer
business, for which it paid
£75,125. Believing that Aus-
tralian conditions offer special
for the commercial use
of trailers, the board has set
up a subsidiary to handle the
production of refrigerated and
air-conditioned types designed
not only for passengers, but to
carry foodstuffs, livestock and
mobile medical units. Under
post-war conditions demand has
outpaced the co.’s productive
capacity, and the establishment
of a Sydney factory has been
regarded as essential. For this'
purpose, and to expand the
Moorabbin (Vic.) headquarters,
the original paid capital of
£lOO,OOO was increased last
September by an issue of 80,000
£1 shares at 6s. premium. One
of the board’s long-range pro-
jects is to manufacture omnibus
bodies when materials become
available.
For the first full trading year
to June 30 last a profit of
£19,931 was declared after tax
“Just in time, pal; it Was geitin' a bit stuffy."
provision of £13,621 and depreci-
ation £6070. It represented 19.9
p.c. on capital and compared
favorably with earnings of the
old McGrath business. Last
term stocks fell by 40 p.c., to
£50,925, because of the strong
demand and Victoria’s industrial
hold-up early in 1947.
Nominal reserves at £12,893
are more than offset by the
£44,230 of intangible assets —
the £1 shares have net tangible
backing of 19s. 3d. each. The
chairman has rightly emphasised
the need for strengthening
finances from future earnings.
After being quoted around 395.
for almost 12 months, the scrip
eased to 355. 6d. each fol-
lowing the general recession in
February. At that price the yield
is 5.7 p.c. on the basis of last
year’s 10 p.c. dividend.
The Threat to Wool
Douglas Boyd, chairman of
the Australian Wool Board, has
uttered a warning on the falling
production of fine wool, thus
crystallising the thoughts of
pretty well everybody interested
in wool and its leading place in
the national economy. Our
wool income will remain high
only so long as we grow the
types of wool which are ex-
clusively ours and are wanted
by the rest of the world. Ws
have no monopoly in coarse
wools.
In common with South Africa
and U.S.A., we’ve lost too many
sheep in recent years, drought
and a big world increase in
mutton-eating being mainly re-
sponsible, though in Australia
there are other factors —like
penal taxation, lack of labor and
material, shortage of veterinary
medicines, etc. But South
Africa is keeping up fine-wool
production:
Percentage of Merino wool in the
South African clip was 87.9 in 1941,
74.3 in 1946. But whereas the per-
centage of 64’s/70’s in S’African
Merino wool is 95.2, the percentage
in Australian Merino is only about
43.
Boyd is rightly apprehensive of
the effect of closer-settlement
on fine-wool production. While
it certainly lowers it in good-
rainfall areas like Western Vic-
toria and Eastern Riverina, there
is some compensation in the
fact that settlement in such areas
means a bigger volume and
variety of land products and
gives more people a chance to
prosper on the land. But the
cutting-up of sheep-runs in the
drier country usually means a
loss for no return. The sub-
divided areas are too small for
economic working, nobody can
produce fine wool on them, and
the debt-burden of the settlers
soon becomes a national head-
ache. That has already hap-
pened in enough areas to con-
vince anybody.
A country dependent mainly
on wool for its national income
cannot afford to suffer, as Aus-
tralia has suffered in the last
seven or eight years, a loss of
up to 25 p.c. of its sheep pro-
duction. At present the loss is
not being made good. In this
lush season millions of acres
of grass are going to waste for
the want of sheep. In former
times the end of a drought cycle
saw graziers restocking as fast
as they could. They are not
doing it now.
Taxation amounting to confis-
cation is one reason, inability
to get sorely-needed materials
and labor is another, rising costs
make a third, and uncertainty as
to the future is a fourth. Inci-
dentally, the shearing position is
becoming desperate. There are
few learners in the game, and
fewer still are the opportunities
for learning. It doesn’t need the
qualities of a prophet to see
where the cumulative effect of
all this is leading.
Pyrox, Ltd.
Converted from a proprietary
in June, 1947, Pyrox, Ltd.,
issued £105,000 of new capital
last month. Of that amount
£75,000 was in 5 p.c. £1 prefs.
and £30,000 in £1 ords., both
issued at par and taken firm
by lan Potter and Co., of Mel-
bourne. Paid capital is thus be-
ing raised to £230,952, all in
ords. except for the 75,000 pref.
issue. Application will be made
“as soon as practicable” to have
the co.’s shares listed on the
Melbourne Stock Exchange.
The new funds will provide
working capital for an expand-
ing programme in the manu-
facture and distribution of pre-
cision-engineering products. War
hastened the transformation of
this 26-year-old business from
importing agent to manufacturer.
Besides sparking-plugs, Pyrox
pioneered in the local produc-
tion of Diesel fuel-injectors and
magnetic-wire recorders. Sound-
film projectors, gars water-heaters
and pressure-cookers are also
in its repertoire, whilst a dis-
tributing franchise is held for
household appliances made by
E.M.A.I.L.
A net loss of
£lBB3, incurred over
the terms ending
June 30, 1945 and
1946, is attributed
by the board to
peace-time reconver-
sion difficulties. In
the case of Diesel
equipment especially,
“all consideration of
economic manufac-
ture had to be
subordinated [during
the war] to the one
aim of producing
equipment of the re-
quired quality in the
required time,” but
valuable experience
and staff - training
were gained.
For the year ended
June 30, 1947, a net
profit of £19,319
was revealed, sufficient to pay
the new pref. div. and 9.7 p.c.
on the increased ordinary capi-
tal. Net tangible cover for the
prefs., on figures submitted by
the investigating accountants, is
545. 4d, each, and for the ords.
16s. 6d.
Managing-director A. Hoette,
the founder of Pyrox, is joined
on the board by knight Thomas
Nettlefold, C. H. Perkins and
H. V. Pennington.
Myer Emporium’s interim re-
port for the six months ended
January 31 is almost identical in
wording with the corresponding
statement last year. In each
case it has been possible to re-
port maintained profits because
rising expenses were countered
by “marked increases in turn-
over.” Sales in the current six
months are said to be continu-
ing the upward trend, and Myer’s
experience should be a fair
pointer to Melbourne retailing
conditions. The Sydney Retail
Traders’ Association likewise
reported more active selling in
most lines last year than was the
case in 1946, but the rate of im-
provement was itself falling con-
siderably. Warnings issued by
the boards of several retail cos.
late in 1947 concerning their
future earning capacity have not
yet been vitiated. In the
current six months Myers and
others will have to meet the
full impact of the 40-hour week.
Myer’s interim div. is unchanged
at 3 p.c. The ords. firmed
slightly on ’Change following
the report, and at 475. 6d. yield
3.8 p.c. on the basis of last
year’s total div. of 9 p.c., which
included a 3 p.c. bonus.

Company Prospects
Scarcity of available goods
and services' continues to create
a sellers’ market in Australia,
and there are export opportuni-
ties for manufacturers in the
case of worsteds, woollens, cot-
ton-goods, steel, chemicals and
many other products. But neither
the domestic nor the export mar-
ket can be satisfied; in the case
of worsteds an attempt is' being
made to split production into
two lots, one portion being
reserved for export to the
United States in order to earn
dollars and the remainder
allotted to the undersupplied
Australian market. The Aus-
tralian market alone could take
all our worsted output, but dol-
lars are needed, and the clothing
position here, deficient as it may
be, is better than in Britain even
after allowing for our exports.
The steel industry is working
a long way behind demand-
coal is a bugbear—and so are
the engineering, building, trans-
port and construction trades.
Stoves and baths appear to be
scarcer even than new houses.
All in all, the prospect of
several years of high activity
still lies ahead of Australian in-
dustry, especially the steel, con-
struction and building trades.
This is so regardless of what
may be happening to prices for
our exports. And though these
in some instances look as though
they might weaken —wheat is a
case in point —there is a pretty
wide margin of safety in pre-
sent quotations for wool, metals
and dairy produce. The most
important thing that concerns us
is the question of whether we
can keep our export income up to
a level high enough to meet pro-
duction costs at home and pay
for the imported raw materials,
machinery, etc., needed for us
to proceed with the industrial
development of the country. So
long as plans for internal de-
velopment are not hamstrung by
lack of the wherewithal to pay
for essential imports this country
has a big enough accumulated
demand to keep the major part
of industry fully occupied for a
long period.
Ordinary shares in Australian
industries, generally speaking,
are still attractive investments.
Companies listed on the Stock
Exchanges so far have not par-
ticipated in the so-called increase
in the post-war national income
to anything like the same extent
as wage-earners, politicians,
etc. Profits are restricted re-
gardless of the reduced purchas-
ing-power of money. Companies
are still subject to exces-
sive controls and heavy double
taxation. And they have
been subject to trade-union in-
timidation on a scale unknown
before the war. A political
showdown is developing that
covers all these questions, and
eventually we should emerge
into a workable economy freed
from the obstructions now so
desperately delaying the indus-
trial recovery of the country.
A rather long view of the
position, this, perhaps ; but in
these days it is' foolish to take a
short view of economic affairs.
High taxation makes share-
market trading for quick profits
hardly worth while, and in any
case there is always the ques-
tion, once one investment has
been disposed of, as to what can
be done with the cash in hand.
The importance of industrial
private enterprise is' so great
that, in days to come, it will
carry a much higher political
priority than it does at present
under the Chifleys and the Mc-
Girrs, preoccupied as they are
with socialism and other politi-
cal rackets and paper-money
prosperity. Perhaps the extreme
laissez-faire of other days will
never fully return to the Aus-
tralian economy; but there will
have to be a vast change from
the present clumsily socialistic
state of affairs, with its excess
of “legal” controls and its Gov-
ernment over - taxing, over -
borrowing and over-spending.
And this country is one in which
much pioneering and develop-
ment to be done still beckon
enterprise and individuality-
something which is being dis-
cerned from as far off these days
as Britain and the United States.
Gold and Currencies
Even the cutting of the franc
almost in two in the official ex-
changes has not brought it to
its open-market value with the
dollar. In 1947 the par rate was
119 francs to the dollar. On
January 26 it was altered to
214. But when the free
market was opened within
France over 300 francs were
offered for the dollar. It
by no means follows that the
pound sterling was therefore
worth 1250 francs, against the
official rate of 864; although the
London-U.S.A. official rate is $4
to the £, in the free markets of
the world the £ is bought for
considerably less. If a fair price
for the pound sterling is three
dollars, then the open-market
price for sterling in France
would be about 940 francs to
the £.
Sterling has yet to face it
severest test. The French open
market is not yet in full swing
but the last of the U.S. loan tc
Britain has been exhausted anc
the Marshall Plan is still in
abeyance, though events in
Europe are hastening its pro-
gress through Washington
Britain is struggling to subsist
on her dwindling dollar re-
sources until such time as her
exports build up to a point
where she becomes self-sufficient
in foreign exchange. Coal out-
put is picking up, and prospects
don’t look quite so black as th'ey
did; but the possibility of
sterling being bought in the
French open market at a cut
price may cause U.S. importers
to get their sterling there instead
of from British official sources,
and Britain may find she is be-
ing paid for exports to America
in repatriated sterling instead of
in U.S. dollars.
The United States still buys
gold at $35 an ounce fine, but
gold dollars don’t circulate in
the U.S.A., and $35 may be
accepted only with some quali-
fications as gold parity, even
though a great deal of gold is
still flowing to America for dis-
posal at that figure. One of the
qualifications is this: Most of the
gold is produced in the British
Dominion of South Africa, and
the Empire’s lack of foreign ex-
change is mostly in the form of
dollars. Thus it is natural that
gsld is readily shipped to the
United States in order to con-
vert it into dollars at whatever
price is offered in order to pay
for the goods so urgently needed
by Britain and the rest of the
Empire. But if production
of all goods at a higher
level were general through-
out the world, it is pos-
sible that increased wages,
prices and costs would force a
higher price for gold even upon
the United States, as happened
in 1934, during the period of
Roosevelt’s New Deal. If gold
is selling for £3O an ounce, as
reported, in Singapore, then
the Australian pound is not
worth much more than a dollar
—at the official exchange rate.
And that does seem fantastic.
There is evidence, indeed, that
the paper dollar sells for only
a third of its gold value in the
open market —where there is
one. Truly, the third year of
peace still leaves the world’s
true gold and currency position
concealed behind a dark official
mask.
Drug cos. in Maoriland are
coining money these days as
“social-security” free medicine
lifts medicine-drinking nearly to
the level of a national pastime
and leaves no bad debts. The
medicine-spree for Maorilanders
began back in 1940, with a mere
£20,000 of tax funds spent the
first year. In seven years the
total has ballooned to seven
figures and has lost its identity
in £6i millions of medical bene-
fits today, with the total still
mounting at the rate of hundreds
of thousands annually. Some
going for a population not much
bigger than Sydney’s! What this
means for drug concerns is seen
in profits of Kempthorne, Prosser
and Co.’s N.Z. Drug Co.,
which have jumped more
than 50 p.c. in the past
two years, despite heavy
taxes and price-control. Latest
result, £82,847 (year ended
Jan, 31), is only £4270 below the
record of £87,117 notched a year
ago, and leaves a fat margin
over 8 p.c. div. needs of £57,476.
Another hefty addition, this time
£20,000, to reserve’s, makes funds
laid away more than £203,000,
doubled in the past seven years,
and there’s still a carry-forward
of £47,094. Stocks have soared
spectacularly to £1,127,978,
nore than double last year’s
swollen total. The 69-year-old
co. is experiencing prosperity
never dreamed of in earlier
years. Capital has expanded
£40,000 to £759,238, but this
won’t be enough to take care of
demands from chemists and the
fertiliser trade that strain re-
sources to the limit.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Lub”: “I had crook eyes an’ was
wearin’ glasses f’r about five years,” re-
lated Harry. “The new bloke on the
farm was interested. ‘Y’ wear gumboots
at the cowyard flight an’ mornin’, I
s’pose,’ he said. I told him I did. ‘Well,
gimme a look at y’r gummies an’ glasses,”
he said. With that he pitched both pairs
into the deep hole in the river.
‘That’ll fix y’r eyes,’ he said. ‘lt’s them
rubber-boots that cause ’em t’ git weak,
because y’ never make contack with the
ground—yer insulated.’ An’, by cripes, I
haven’t worn gumboots since.” “But
you’re still wearing glasses,” I remarked.
“You can’t say leaving off gumboots
cured your eyes,” “Aw, it must’ve done
’em a lot o’ good,” Harry said. “This
pair o’ glasses was a guinea cheaper than
the ones I had t’ have before.”
* * * *
“Old-timer”: Big Bill Rubey and Little
Bill Tomlins went to Sydney for the
Easter Show, put up at the Arcadia and
began a round of those simple pleasures
which appeal to the hearts of men long
immured in the back country. Having
business taking them different directions
“The elopement’s off! You told me you had a pedal-car.”
one morning, they agreed to meet on the
corner of King- and George-streets—not
thinking to specify which comer. In mid-
afternoon Big Bill stood on one comer
and blissfully sought Little Bill, while
Little Bill stood tip-toe on a second
corner seeking Big B. Big B. sighted
L.B. and started off at right-angles to
join him; L.B. saw him half-way across
and went to intercept him, But they
missed each other somehow and presently
they stood on opposite comers, slightly
bemused and each alone. Nobody seems
quite sure what happened then ; but the
nearest the traffic-cop could get to it was
this; “I saw a long cove make a dart
against the traffic and just miss a tram.
Then a little cove ducks round the tram
and rushes to the opposite comer. The
long cove sights him and goes after him,
but the little cove ducks back. Me,
thinking it’s a robbery or something, I
stick all the traffic up, but the blasted
pedestrians gathered in a mob, thinking
it’s an accident I suppose, and in about
a minute we got the biggest jam in
history. Time I get it sorted out the
blokes I’m watchin’ have cleared out.
Wouldn’t it?” But they hadn’t. They
were in the second tram that got through
the jam, both wondering loudly what had
caused the crush.

“Akrabo”: Can any of the Council
explain why certain springs have water
in them only at night? First I saw was
in a coastal range of N.Q shown me by
a prospector to substantiate his belief
that fresh water was tidal. The spring
ran a stream of water in a small gully
for about 150 feet at night, but during
the day there came never a drop of mois-
ture. Ran across the same thing in the
Diehardy Ranges, 100 miles north of
Bullfinch, W.A., where they are known
locally as midnight-springs.

“Bon-yi”: Why go to New Guinea
for “wood light as balsa” (B. 17/3/’4B)
when there are several kinds of trees in
Queensland with timber ranging from
151 b, to 251 b. per cubic foot, air-dried
weight? The corkwood, or white bass-
wood (Duboisia myoporoides), has firm
creamy wood only 231 b. a cub. ft. An-
other, but a tree of different family, is
the batswing grey-corkwood (Erythrina
vespertilio), familiar nearly all over
Queensland’s east coast areas, Jt has
plenty of spines on its trunk and
branches, with a stringy-fibred wood easy
to carve or saw into any shape for
models. Its wood is only 201 b. a cub. ft.
Northerners know the candlenut, with
perhaps the whitest wood known in Aus-
tralia. Weighing only 23-25 pounds a
cub. ft. and a fast grower, its nuts are
said to be worthwhile for their oil content
—especially as a substitute for linseed.
The tree is a close relative of the Chinese
tung oil, both being of the Aleurites
family. Last, but with lasting memories
if you’ve had the pleasure of falling foul
of its leaves, is the wood of the giant
stinging-tree, known as fibrewood. It
is hardly a wood —more of a loosely-knit
cellular structure, though the tree grows
to enormous size. Two kinds, the
“gympie” and the shiny-leaved, grow to
any size; the far northern one is only a
large shrub, though its sting puts the
other two to shame. This “wood” is
only 151 b. a cub, foot.

“Esk D.”: The gully has an air of peace
and quiet. The whip-bird, calling from
the depths of wattle and fern, gives his
abandoned best to the longdrawn
“phweee” and caps it neatly with the
imitation crack of a stockwhip. Hop-
scrub Henry is returning down the same
gully from a six-weeks’ trek into the
ranges in search of gold. He has dis-
covered nearly as much as half an ounce
of the stuff and it is carefully tucked
in his waistcoat-pocket. The rest of his
belongings are hung on the dejected pack-
horse plodding behind him. Suddenly,
without warning, a rifle-shot shatters the
peacefulness and Henry’s hat flies off.
He picks it up and fearfully inspects the
holes in it. “The murderin’ blankard’s
due south,” he mutters; then tickles the
nag’s belly with a well-placed hobnail
boot and they head on northwards at a
jogtrot. There is commotion in the town-
ship when Henry, after absorbing beer
steadily for an hour, reports the matter,
"Worm We Waiting for? I’ve Wound anchor up!”
The trooper glances curiously at the cady,
strolls over to the packhorse and back
and his eyes narrow to slits, a sure sign
that he is about to make an early arrest.
“Anything you say will be used as evi-
dence against you, Henry,” he warns.
“I’m charging y’ with being an accessory
before and after the fact, contempt of
Court an’ wasting my time. Look at
them powder-stains, showing the rifle was
fired only three feet or so away. You
ought to be old enough by now to know
not to carry a loaded rifle on your pack-
horse.”

“Alpine Willie”: A fishing-party on
the upper reaches of a Victorian mountain
river swears by the yarn. Inspecting a
small tributary, they saw a trout of pass-
able size glide under the bank. Their
guide offered to gather it in; working
his tickling process with an arm sub-
merged to the shoulder, he probed the
recesses under the bank. Pretty soon he
was dragging out his prize, nearly sft.
of it —a black snake! He had gripped
it closely behind the head, a safe hold,
but was clear of it by yards the instant
he learned his error.

“C.E.”: So long as the district can
remember old Mick has worn the same
hat. The band has long disappeared,
the dejected brim is tethered on one side
with a tie-wire, while the top of the
crown, torn three-parts of the way round,
opens and shuts with every passing breeze.
Mick is so used to its performance that,
even when in his bunk, his mitt strays
up unconsciously to close down his lid.
The rains came, and Mick, riding across
the swollen river to rescue Grandad
Sawyers, got into strife on the return trip.
Luckily he didn’t miss his headgear till
he’d hit the bank. Then the fuss started.
The rescued one gratefully came to light
with a brand-new headpiece, and with a
snort of derision Mick stuck it on and
wore it for several hours before pitching
it disgustedly into a comer and starting
riverward. All day he was gone; then
the dusk showed a familiar and triumph-
ant figure returning. There’s a big side-
rip added to the old felt now, and its
lid hangs by a whisker. But there was
no rancour in old Mick’s voice, as,
happily laying out the wreck by the fire,
he remarked that “the swim hadn’t done
his blasted hat much good.”

“Eastern”: Bushfires are our greatest
contributors to bad future fires, I de-
cided, having taken in recently the result
of the ’39 conflagration on the ranges
south of Mt. Hotham (Vic.). As far as
the eye can reach in every direction, mile
after mile of dead snowgum forest
stretches away to the horizon. The affect
is startling. The fire that killed the timber
took leaves and twigs, but nowhere now
is there sign of blackened remains. The
stark white limbs and trunks point eerily
in a still, dead world till one searches
the sky uneasily for an assurance that
the sun is shining. Everywhere is an
illusion of moonlight and unreality. A
closer inspection of the gullies shows a
crop of neW undergrowth that is almost
impenetrable, while the short-lasting gums
are already dropping dead branches into
the tangle. A good spring growth on
the slopes, followed by a dry autumn and
a carelessly-dropped -spark, will bring
heat so intense none could possibly enter
the area to rescue the hundreds of high-
class Herefords that would certainly
perish,
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: We’d knocked our
cheques down and, as usual, found our-
selves in a city with about two bob be-
tween us and getting ready for the bush
again when Mat said; “Hey, wouldn’t it
be a change t’ knock up some cash down
here an’ then have a holiday in the
bush?” It seemed silly, but we gave it a
go, and six months later hit
Bingiwandi with about £2O apiece, settled
in at its one pub and became objects of
interest to the 200-odd citizens and the
35 or so odd dogs hanging around. ’Twas
summer, and all around us hummed the
headers in the wheat, what time dis-
tressed agriculturists periodically dropped
into town and tried to seduce us from
our slothful existence. Since promises
of money, home-like care and entertain-
ment failed to move us, the Law was called
upon, and it came into the bar one after-
noon and talked vaguely about having
to “vag.” us if we didn’t do something.
Mat called for a pot of beer, planked it
down in front of the Law and said
“Look. You ever bin in the city?” The
Law admitted it. “You ever see how them
city blokes crowd round blokes diggin’
holes in the road or puttin’ up a buildin’
or anythin’?” Admitted. “Well, me an’
me mate’s bin toilin’ in the city an’ we
got dead sick o’ crowds watchin’ us, so
we come up here with a few quid t’
watch other blokes work. You know, me
an’ me mate here, we get up on the pub
roof every now an’ then an’ look way
out an’ see them headers go an’ blokes
cartin’ wheat an’ everybody toilin’; then
we laugh an’ come down an’ have
another couple before we go back again.
You goin’ t’ have another?” “I am,”
said the Law, “and then I’ll go over aii’
get me field-glasses an’ lend ’em t’ y’;
y’ll be able t’ see a lot better.”

“Kelms”: I’ve heard of foreigners
who, like “Searjay’s” Balts (B. 3/ 3 / ’4B)
“put the local workers to shame,” but
I’ve yet to meet the imported article who
could outwork the Australian-bom bush-
man, Once took on a clearing contract
near where some Italians were chopping-
down. The ring of their axes before
dawn and well into dusk earned them a
reputation for extreme hardiness and in-
dustry, but I, who toiled from early
morning until late afternoon, knew of the
four-hour break they enjoyed in the
middle of the day. In the same time I
cleared a greater area than any member
of their gang. They admired and envied
my ability to keep going through the
heat, but the locals, guided solely by
appearances, voted them tops. The Aus-
tralian bush practice of refusing to lay-
off during midday has been criticised,
but it has bred: a tough race who seem
unharmed by it. Foreigners bring more
enthusiasm than commonsense to the
prosecution of tasks that are essentially
indigenous—a characteristic largely re-
sponsible for the production of a big
body of “Americans” who were too old
at 40.

“Jemac”: Laying of “Bosun’s Mate’s
cables (B. 24/3/’4B) resulted in the col-
lection of valuable data on ocean floors.
Due to the necessity, when laying, of
avoiding plateaux and pinnacles from
which the cable would hang in heavy,
swaying bights, cable companies mapped
their routes with the thoroughness or a
land survey. It was found that the
Atlantic bed, which carries more cables
than any other, is almost uniformly
covered with a widespread deposit or
fine creamy or greyish mud called ‘ ooze.
The Pacific bed consists of immense
plateaux and intervening basins of enor-
mous depth. The Tuscarora Deep, a
great fissure in the ocean floor off Japan,
was for many years regarded as the spot
on the earth’s surface nearest its centre.
But off Guam fairly recently a cable
company’s echo-sounding “ping searched
down through the black depths, touched
bottom, and returned to record a depth
of 5.04 miles. To ensure even laying
over these irregularities a special device
is fitted on the ship for controlling the
speed at which the cable runs.
MURRUMBIDGEE HAVEN.
Calm days of tranquil leisure
With solitude complete
Green bush in endless measure
The river at our feet ;
Cool shades where gum-trees tower
Far-reaching to the sky,
The rapid’s song of power
A soothing lullaby.
The hush itself is sleeping
With Heaven wondrous near,
The lazy waters creeping
Sun-flecked and crystal-clear.
An islet in mid-river
Flood height and evergreen
Tall rushes sway and quiver
Like shadows on a screen.
Deep tracks are interwoven
Where fallen branches spread,
Made by small hooves and cloven,
As thirsty sheep have sped.
The axe has left its traces
And sprawling giants lie
With gaunt stumps in their places
AU weather-worn and dry.
A summer shower is falling.
The earth smells sweet and damp,
Old memories recalling
Of tilted cart and camp.
Small clouds with silver lining
Are drifting overhead
And where the sun is shining
A rainbow’s glow is shed.
Dull red the sun is sinking
With golden spears flung high;
Bush bird and beast are drinking,
A cool wind rustles by.
Wild possums venture slyly
When night enwraps the land
And eye dry breadcrusts shyly
Then take them from the hand.
We’ve sighed with little reason
For people on the land
But as we spend a season
On this enchanted strand
We feel a meed of pity
(Old follies crashing down)
For dwellers of the city
And toilers of the town.

“Bo”: The Tanker and Battling Ben
had tossed their cut-out cheques across
the bar to Callaghan with instructions
that he let them know when the total
was exhausted; then they proceeded
to their peculiar form of recreation.
Three days later Ben, unaware that
his shearing-mate, becoming a bit
obstreperous, had been locked in a
shed till a slight return to sobriety had
left him less pugnacious, started to look
for him, himself only half-out of the
horrors. His long search ended among
a pile of empty beer-kegs in the back-
yard of the pub. Half an hour later he
weaved his way back from an excursion
up the township dragging a two-yard
string of sausages. Coming down the
yard a bit later Callaghan saw Ben on
his knees beside a keg laboriously feed-
ing the queue of snags through the bung-
hole. He looked up as Callaghan’s
shadow fell on him. “I foun’ me
cobber at lasht,” Ben volunteered. “He’sh
in thish keg. Ain’t thirshty—can’t be —
but poor blankardsh ain’t ’ad anything
to eat for daysh!” “But he won’t eat
sausages raw like that, will he?” asked
Callaghan, humoring his customer. “Don’
be shtupid!” protested Ben solemnly,
“Don’ have to, He’sh got fryin’-pan in
there. But can y’ len’sh candle. Ish
dark in there an’ poor cow wansh light
sho he can shee when they’re cooked/’

“Wippegong”: Stopped for a spell where
the creek bank dropped straight to the
water, and after a minute’s stillness a tiny
brown shape slipped from the big silver-
wattle above, fell to within a yard of my
boot, seemed to float in front of the
bank for a second or two, then, with a
whispered plaint, flew to a gum on the
farther bank. I rolled over, felt the dry
clay just below the drooping grass and
found what I expected—the entrance to
the nesting-tunnel of a spotted pardalote.
He was back a moment later, but not
until after a dozen hesitant approaches
did he re-enter the nest; and it was dur-
ing these fluttering pauses at a range of
less than a yard that the jewelled beauty
of this little sprite could be appreciated.
There are few bonnier birds in the bush,
but because he’s a quiet feeder, and then
feeds mostly on the outer leaves of fairly
tall trees, he passes unnoticed by many;
and, not being interested in fruit, he
escapes the publicity accorded to pests.
Around nesting-time he and his less-
gaudy cousins find voices that are in-
credibly strong for the size of the birds,
and folk unfamiliar with diamond dykes
may be seen searching for larger fowl
when the racket emanates from a diminu-
tive chook somewhat smaller than the
leaves he’s ridding of insects. They all
nest in the dark; if they don’t tunnel
they use an old spout, and fortunately
they can use holes so small that the evic-
tion tactics of the starling mean nothing
to them. Their flight is delicacy itself;
there is something elfin about it, no whir-
ring, no fluttering, just a mothlike motion
and as silent as the owl. Widespread
even if not so widely known, they go
about their useful business and leave
others to mind theirs; and that is suffi-
cient to brand them as very worthy
citizens.
“Play around with your MODELS!”
“R.P.”: Determined that the new
upper set which had set him back £l5
or so would last him a long time. Blue
habitually carried it in his top pocket,
reserving them for special occasions in
at the homestead. He and Long Billy,
bringing a mob of ewes in from the back
hut for shearing, camped the sheep and
settled down to boil the quart-pot. Billy
had finished the contents of his saddle-
bag, rolled himself a smoke and stretched
out for a rest while his mate still wrestled
with a junk of tough mutton. After a
further attempt at mastication Blue, with
a belligerent glint in his eye, regarded the
slab of meat in his hand, and, in the tone
usually used for recalcitrant dogs, roared:
“Strike me! Do I have to get me teeth
out to you?”
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: On the second night of
this year, during a really terrific storm,
three saturated men knocked on the door
of a guesthouse near Seven Mile Beach,
South Coast (N.S.W.), and explained to
the proprietress that they had luckily
escaped drowning when their yacht was
dashed into the rocky coast half a
mile away. Next morning campers and
residents travelled miles to see the end
of the craft. Stranded on a ledge, the
30ft. yacht leaned over on her side with
a rising tide swirling under her keel —
awaiting the time when it would be high
enough to pound the stricken craft to
pieces. Time after time it seemed that
the vessel must slip back into the vicious
sea that smashed against the jagged
rocks, but to the amazement (and disap-
pointment of some) of the spectators she
remained in her precarious position. Five
times enormous waves picked the vessel
up and swept it along or around as
though it weighed no more than an
empty bottle. Still the yacht remained
intact, although the bumps as she was
dumped back on the rock splintered her
spar with the vibration. Finally, as
though in chagrin at such resistance, the
ocean came up in a roaring gale. It was
too late; waves 10 feet high were im-
potent —the tide had fallen. Next day
the salvage people arrived with their gear.
The yacht was mounted on a trailer and,
with the assistance of a farmer’s ex-
Bren-carrier and two trucks, borne away
over paddocks that almost qualified as
mounts. Next day she was launched
again on the Parramatta River. Her
damages: a splintered rudder, twisted
propeller and broken spar. Truly a fine
recommendation for Australian work-
manship and timber. Yet there are still
some people who think that Aussie
spotted gum is good for little except
fencing or floor-joists.

“PJ.H.”: Who said Murray cod are
“normally only found in the Murray and
its tributaries” (B. 10/3/’48)? As a kid
in Gympie (Q.) I saw a 90-pounder, hung
in the fish-shop, being raffled. That bell-
mouther came out of the Mary River.
We used to call them Mary River cod
up there, but there was no doubt the
spots, color and shape were the same as
those caught in the Murray. Flood-time
brought the big fellows out of their
skulking-places in deep holes. It was only
in flood that any sort of a river ran.
Cod were caught usually on the ebb.
Odd 20-pounders were smelt-out by
fossickers between floods and a fair num-
ber of three- to five-pounders hooked.
The reason the big cod were able to
hide effectively at low-water was because
of smelter flushings from the mines dye-
ing the river a deep grey. There was
said to be cyanide in that stuff, but it
didn’t seem to affect the fish. Apparently
overlanding prospectors brought the fry
from the Darling with an eye to future
tucker variety.
* * * *
“Billy T.”: That little Italian who fell
for feeding Mat and his mate on the
Pakenham-Kooweerup road (B. 17/3/’4B)
was probably one of the many who in-
vaded that district in the ’twenties—
they had just recently been “our gallant
allies” then. They hunted in packs for a
start; about a dozen would rent a house
—much as they do now —but they’d go
out harvesting and spud-digging, drain-
ing and hoeing, then after a while one
of the number would be set up on a block
and the community of his countrymen
would see that his first crop, at least,
went in, and out, on time. During those
years you’d see them on bikes streaming
to and from work on any of the roads
east of “Koowee,” and we used to make
a practice of saying “Good-day” to each
one as he spun past, just to hear the in-
finite variety of “Good-days” that came
back. Rather a shame that, for once
clear of the interruption they’d resume
the part-singing which was a feature of
their travel —the bikes might be strung
out over a hundred yards, but the melody
that came from the dusty procession often
brought locals to a standstill until the
echoes of “Rigoletto” or “Faust” faded
in the dusk. The local chalkie was
approached and undertook to straighten
out their troubles with English. One
night he was on common tools: spade-
digs, saw-cuts, axe-chops and makes-chips.
“Ha!” little Tony leapt to life. “I knowa
da chip all right!” Explanation requested,
“Ess! I goa one shopkeeper for hat, he
say twenty bob. I goa one more shop-
keeper, he say ten bob. Datta one chip!”

“Zake”: One thing common to
typhoons (B. 24/3/’4B) and the land-
borne willy-willy is that in the southern
hemisphere they revolve always in the
one direction —clockwise, just as they do
anti-clockwise in the northern half of the
world —the same principle of course,
applying to your bathwater as it gurgles
down the hole. The invariability of the
one-way traffic has often been questioned
by observers of objects whirling the
wrong way in the centre of the funnel.
This phenomenon occasionally occurs
through a separate disturbance in the
centre, and is especially noticeable after
the whirling mass of air has hit a flat
object, like a wall,
• * * •
“Derwent”: A couple of swallows
who’d built a cosy-looking home on to
the wall of the front verandah had evi-
dently suffered from the same shortage
of materials as plagues the rest of us —
at any rate the nest suddenly collapsed to
the floor, leaving an agitated, fluttering
pair of householders discussing the catas-
trophe in bird language. After a while
the two got to work again, using new
plans. When the job was finished we
noticed they’d run a projecting zigzag
bracket-like arrangement from the wall
to help to support the new-model build-
ing.

“Blime”: George got agistment for a
bunch of his cattle down-country. He
had just made the long trip back home
when the phone rang: an urgent
message informing George that the Here-
ford bull had jumped the fence of his
new quarters and defied recapture. After
several others had failed Andy tried to
get him, and though he had escaped un-
hurt his nag was so badly gored it had
to be shot. Andy claimed £2O as the
horse’s value. Jumping into the utility,
George raced back to the scene. He
shot the bull, then turned thoughtfully
to Andy. “ ’Course you shouldn’t ’ve
tried t’ go near a bull on a young nag,”
he pointed out. “Young? Gripes, he
was a real old stager,” Andy protested.
“We’ve had him ten years an’ more.”
“Yair? Well, y’ must ’a’ bin crowdin’
the bull pretty close t’ get caught like
that.” “I wasn’t crowdin’ him,” Andy
defended indignantly. “I tell y’, I was
a good fifteen yards away when he swung
round an’ charged.” George shook his
head slowly, “Fifteen yards, eh? Well,
son,” he summed up, “in that case, that
horse o’ yours weren’t worth twenty quid.
Here’s a tenner, an’ we’ll call it square,”
FLEMINGTON.
Bleating of sheep in the cobbled yard,
Lowing of cattle in lane and pen,
And memory flits with gates unbarred
Back to the old stock-routes again.
Where have they come from —reds and roans,
Herefords, Devons and black-polled steer,
Along the routes where the bleaching bones
Tell of the droughts of yesteryear?
prom the Blue Lagoon where the eagles drink,
And wild winds harry the Bogong’s crown
Till the melting snow on the river’s brink
Sends the Snowy roaring down.
Is it far Wave Hill, or Victoria Downs?
Great rangy bullocks and wild-eyed cows,
From the Iron Knob or the Granite Crowns
Or where wild bulls lurk in the brigalows.
Bleating of sheep from far and near,
Lowing of cattle in lane and pen,
And the sonorous voice of the auctioneer
Taking the bids of the cattlemen.
The sun goes down and the sales are done
And silence reigns in pen and lane,
And following the wake of the setting sun
The drovers seek the trails again.
Bleating of sheep on the stock reserves,
Sighmg of cattle lying down,
And campfires glare where the river curves
Full many a mile from Sydney town.
By hill and valley and lake and stream,
Through mud and dust the drovers plod
Until they hear the hiss of steam
And the plunging thrust of the piston-rod.
Then it’s “Hey!” when the trucks are filled
again
And pin-chains rattle on staples strong,
The big wheels grind, and the couplings strain,
And the engine sings his homing song.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Sydney Cattle Show.
“C. Punch”: The judges were
still at it when this page went
to the printer, but enough had
been seen to say that in view of
what breeders have had to con-
tend with the beef on display
was a credit to them. Herefords,
as usual, were in force—one of
the biggest white-faced parades
in Sydney R.A.S. history—and
there was a good showing of
other prominent breeds.
The McCaughey Coonong
stud repeated last year’s' Short-
horn championship with last
year’s champion, Coonong
0.8. E., which has filled out into
a handsome red bull. He beat
the imported Tarvas Mandarin.
L. M. Dugdale, a Victorian
breeder, collected the junior
championship with a son of
Coonong lan called Banool
Grand.
Top Hereford honors went to
Bexley, whose champion, B.
Demonstrator, had improved
sufficiently from his last year’s
reserve ribbon to beat the Golf
Hill youngster, Dispenser, which
was junior and reserve cham-
pion and will be heard of again.
Aberdeen-Angus put on a
good show, and this time the
N.S.W. Department of Agricul-
ture justified its importation of
Erison Harviestoun when the
bull beat the Munro champion,
Booroomooka Ossian, for the
championship, Ossian going to
the reserve.
Devons fell away a little, the
Ban Ban stud going to the top
with Searchlight, a grand ani-
mal, the well-known Havilahs
having to be content with re-
serve. Red Polls, which deserve
a better following if only for
their dual - purpose qualities
alone, were limited to the rival
breeders. Perry Bros, and T. L
and J. J. L. Fleming. The Flem-
ings had the champion, Bundure
Dissenter, and the Perrys the
junior and reserve.
Polled beeves and dairy breeds
were making a good showing,
and of the general cattle display
more will be said.
Fine-wool Decline,
“R.N.”: Causes of the de-
cline of 64’s type during the last
six years' and the increased pro-
duction of 50’s/58’s, as shown
in the analysis of the Australian
clip, 1940-41 to 1946-47, were
outlined by Douglas T. Boyd,
chairman of the Australian
Wool Board.
There was the fact that
drought affected the Merino
areas more than the wetter cross-
bred country, so it is safe to
assume that a drought period
which caused the sheep popula-
tion to drop from 125 million to
95 million was probably the
main cause of the great decline
in 64’s type. It could also be
assumed that ensuing good sea-
sons and light stocking had
caused the clip to coarsen.
It was evident that top-
dressing and pasture-improve-
ment in higher rainfall areas had
caused growers to turn from
fine wools to crossbreds of SB’s
and lower. Merinos do not
accommodate themselves to
small areas of rich grass, so the
grower usually turned to fat-
lamb production.
The fine wool decline, said
Boyd, would continue as closer
settlement gathered momentum.
It is a very real problem, be-
cause Australia has ho monopoly
of wool in the 50’s/58’s field;
whereas our best Merino and
fine comebacks are superlative,
such is not the case in the
stronger crossbreds of ordinary
type. The position calls for
some practical thinking, not only
by wool men, but by the Gov-
ernment. Good wool is still the
main source of national wealth,
and it will remain so only while
we continue to produce it. A
drop to coarser qualities is a
serious threat to our economy.
Farm Water.
“Oiler”: Many farmhouses
haven’t water laid on and it is
hard to see why not. If bores,
springs or watercourses can’t be
tapped, then a reserve should be
created artificially, for which
underground concrete tanks are
suitable and permanent. With
strainers and filters to clear the
ingoing water, which will most
likely be off the roofs, it should
stay clear and the tanks require
cleaning-out only at long inter-
vals. An inch of rain on a
square chain of flat surface
yields 2260 gallons.
For stock dams or tanks the
layout and maintenance should
provide for the maximum of
storage with muddiness reduced
to the minimum. To get some
idea of water requirements a
general measure may be given ;
about 10 gallons a day for each
member of the household,
horses eight, cattle nine, milkers
20, pigs two and sheep one gal-
lon would be near the mark.
These figures are useful when
considering the size of storage
or a pumping plant.
Windmills have more than
proved their worth, and for
underground tanks one of the
several types of low-down pump
is generally used. The overhead
tank should be high enough to
create a reasonable pressure in
the pipes. The piping system for
laying-on water to the kitchen,
laundry and bathroom doesn’t
call for elaborate measures, and
there is only a small initial cost
in installing a hot-water system,
From the heat generated by a
wood-stove going most of the
“ Cripes, mate , that one'll take a bit of strikin' !”
day it’s a simple matter to -work
a small hot-water system that
calls for no extra wood-burning
or attention,
Oats for Poultry.
“Mr.”: They’re a better
poultry feed than is generally
realised and can supplement a
wheat shortage. As far back as
1921, in the first feeding trial at
Werribee State Farm (Vic.), hens
on oats as the only grain laid
19 eggs per bird more than hens
on wheat. Hens on oats laid
170 eggs per bird; hens on
wheat, oats and barley, 157
eggs ; hens on wheat only, 151.
Oats are not as rich as wheat,
though bulkier. A. C. T. Hewitt,
Vic. stock-feed expert, recom-
mends feeding almost double
measure of oats to supply the
same nutrients. At their pre-
sent retail price, 4s, 6d. a bushel
ex store Melbourne, oats are as
cheap as bagged wheat at 7s.
9d. In the grain ration Hewitt
advises one-third oats, and in
the mash ground oats up to 40
per cent,
Dogs and Drovers.
“Dusty Mile”: The dingo
menace in western Queensland
has put many holdings out of
sheep and into cattle. With all
the efforts being made tq beat
them, it is remarkable that more
attention hasn’t been paid to
drovers’ dogs. Much has been
made of the Alsatian danger, but
most of it won’t bear examina-
tion. I don’t imply that an
Alsatian never has mated with
a dingo, although in a long ex-
perience I have never known it
to happen. In the outback the
gentle, domesticated Alsatian
would be as hard-pressed as any
other household pet to survive.
The drover’s dog is different.
Rugged, savage and semi-wild,
inured to hard living, he can go
wild with the greatest of ease.
The drover, to whom a good
dog is indispensable, often ac-
quires packs far beyond his re-
quirements. If he “drops” a dog
on the road it doesn’t matter. At
his permanent camp in some
western township he has dozens
more, chained up or ranging the
town common, blooding them-
selves on the local goats. The
mark of the drover’s dog is
stamped heavily and obviously
on Warrigal. The solution? A
£lO per annum licence fee on all
dogs used by drovers. This
would make them careful of the
dogs they kept.
Shrewd Farming.
“Agricola”: It happened in
Tasmania, First of all he ob-
tained a farm which had been
at one time a first-class holding,
but in later years allowed to
slip so far as cultivation went,
and soon after taking possession
he bought up all the tuberous
artichokes he could get in the
district and, after roughly scari-
fying two paddocks, he
ploughed-in artichoke sets and
waited results'.
When the crop was nearing
maturity, but before the leaves
and ’ stalks had decayed, he
turned in his milch cows. They
gave better returns than when
on Algerian green oats. After
the leaves had been stripped by
the milking herd he turned in
the dry cows to finish off the
stalks.
Then, having bought as many
good store pigs as he could
muster, he next turned them into
one of the paddocks and said it
was a sight to see the way those
porkers rooted up the tubers,
and at the same time thoroughly
pulverised the soil and eradi-
cated the weeds. In ope season
he bought and fattened (with-
out any other foodstuffs) over
400 baconers which topped the
market for quality, and the
neighboring farmers, who had
cautioned him against planting
such “pests” on his farm, were
soon buying-up artichoke tubers
to follow his example. Now the
result of his experiment is seen
as one of the cleanest and most
fertile farms in the district.
Bradfieldf Water Scheme.
“Outback”: The special com-
mittee appointed by the Com-
monwealth Weather Bureau to
investigate it reported that while
rainfall studies had shown that
there would be plenty of water
available, an essential pre-
liminary would be investigation
by soil and engineering experts.
The late Dr. Bradfield, contrary
to popular belief, merely put
forward a suggestion, not a defi-
nite plan, regarding this scheme.
Scientists familiar with the tex-
ture of the soil in central wes-
tern Queensland are very
dubious regarding its ability to
hold the water it would be called
upon to carry were the scheme
ever implemented. The Weather
Bureau investigators said that
“the plan for sending water into
the dried-out central rivers and
lakes might be practicable.”
A member of the committee
was E. T. Quayle, former senior
Commonwealth meteorologist,

field based his idea of changing
tfie climate by a huge water-
storage. Quayle dissented from
the finding of the committee
“that the Central Australian
climate and rainfall could not
be improved by the Bradfield
sebeme,” but the other members
stated that in the decade fol-
lowing Quayle’s investigations
the areas on which he had based
his figures actually suffered in
comparison with near-by areas
which could not be affected by
water-storages. The committee
endorsed overseas findings that
man could not control climate
and that aerial moisture which
produced rain came from sea-
evaporation. H, N. Warren,
weather - bureau director, sum-
marising the report, said that
whether or not water could be
carried in a continuous, regu-
lated flow to Lakes Eyre and
Frame was a matter for hydro-
logical engineers; the evidence
regarding the Finke River
scheme—that the waters from
the Thompson River would
eventually dam the floodwaters
of the Finke River and sub-
sidiaries and lead them into
Lakes Eyre and Frome—offered
considerable doubt. Thus with
still another report the layman
is no nearer any idea of whether
or not the scheme is sound,.
■
Not for Fowls.
“Dayl”; Friends, having a
bumper crop of cattle-pump-
kins, the huge soft type, filled
their barns, then piled a mighty
heap in a paddock corner and
used them for stock-feed, keep-
ing stock back with a temporary
fence. At feed-times pumpkins
were carted to the horseyard
and burst by throwing them
forcefully to the grass. The
horses cleared them up with
relish and learned to smash un-
broken ones with their hooves,
Broken pumpkins were fed to
the pigs with a ration of sepa-
rated milk, and a few house
cows ate chopped pumpkins and
all grew sleek and fat—all ex-
cept the chopks.
They gobbled up the seed from
the horse-yard and from the
rotted pumpkins in the heap,
After a while they layed shell-
less eggs, got rickets and eventu-
ally died. Like drunks, they
always went back for more,
passing up their com ration for
the seed. The chooks on that
farm are segregated now.
Hints for the Farm,
“Plane Creek”: If you must
burn-off, see that the plough fol-
iows the burn at once, otherwise
the light residual ash will be
largely blown away and a large
quantity of potash lost. Fur-
thermore, delay in ploughing
after a burn results in the
ground, which was temporarily
softened, becoming rock-hard
again.
“Bill C”: Glass stoppers are
best for sealing jars containing
corrosive chemicals, but, failing
them, ordinary corks can be
rendered very resistant to fumes
by steeping them for a few
hours in liquid vaseline. Metal
stoppers are rapidly corroded
through by chemical fumes and
then the chemicals themselves
deteriorate,
“Bai”: A ton or more of dolo-
mite to the acre increases the
weight of cauliflowers, and can
be used in conjunction with ex-
perimental dressings of sodium
molybdenate, s'ay 31b, to the
acre, to prevent disease. Sulphur
should be used sparingly—not
more than lib. to the acre—and
then only in conjunction with
sod. molyb. on plots affected
by spreading heads, etc.
“8.A.”: Posts of Murray-pine
might last 50 years or five. The
secret of getting lasting timber
is to cut it from trees that are
dark-brown in the heart. If it
is pale or yellow, the timber is
of little value in the ground,
and if there is any sign of pithy
rot, not only the portion of the
tree with the rot, but the whole
log is useless. The practice of
avoiding certain classes of
ground when cutting posts runs
parallel to what I have said, as
where one tree is found to be
useless a large proportion might
be the same.
“Radian”: To grind-in leak-
ing plug-cocks and tank-taps,
smear the plug with either tur-
pentine or liquid metal polish,
press it firmly back into the tap
and rotate with a to-and-fro
motion. Lift the plug each time
you change direction to prevent
seizing or scoring of the sur-
faces, and keep it central in the
body of the valve as you grind.
“Billjim”: Don’t enter the
apiary clad in milk or paint-
stained clothes ; both will arouse
the hostility of bees. Don’t
wear black and dark-blue cloth-
ing or a woollen pullover in
which the bees may become en-
tangled. For the same reason,
woollen socks should be
Bees have been known to attack
a wearer of brown socks, pos-
sibly because of their color and
the animal fat in the wool.
“O’Yen”: Waite Research In-
stitute (S.A.) has developed a
new wheat, Glenwari, which is
resistant to flag-smut, leaf- and
stem-rust; it’s a cross between
Nabawa, Riverina and Hope
varieties.
“B. Acre”: Before soldering
a copper tap-float that has been
used in bore water clean away
mineral deposits with repeated
applications of spirits of salts,
rinsing occasionally in water.
When the spirits no longer cause
frothing, soldering can be done,
using broken spirits as a flux.
Taps that have become jammed
with mineral can be cleaned in
the same way. An alternative
method is careful burning.
“Myrf”: Young trees need
root-room, water and protec-
tion from animals to give them
a reasonable start. Select a well-
drained site or make it so, and
dig the hole too large rather
than too small. Use only
healthy plants with a good root-
system and put them into a
moist soil, preferably on a dull,
windless day. Stake firmly,
protecting the young trees with
a wire-netting guard, and cover
at night against frost if tender..
“Sarina”: Roup in poultry is
caused by parasites invading the
windpipe. Fumes of carbolic
acid will kill the worms and end
the disease much more rapidly
than powders given through the
mouth. Simply let a fewi drops
of carbolic acid fall on a heated
stone or brick and force the bird
to inhale the vapor. Take care
to avoid suffocating the bird.
Burn all worms that may be
coughed up during treatment.
“Sundowner”: U.S. scientists
are tackling the problem of
securing a tougher eggshell by
selective breeding, and have al-
ready doubled the resistance to
breaking of an ordinary hen’s-
egg.
“Mark”: A hollowed-out
corn-cob is useful for teaching
p OC jdy to drink from a
bucket, xhe cob is dipped in
one end given to the poddy
to suck and then gra dually
,• t , the bucket until

Then he came up against
Jamesie, who brought Whole-
heartedness to a sudden stop.
“Nobody puts luggage in my
van without paying for it. You
have to get the coprosma leaves,
they make good money. Six
for every parcel and ten for
checked ones.”
“Now, come, come, James,
this is a real railway game. You
see, we must do things in the
proper way. These stones are
just to weigh the boxes down.”
“No, they are freight. They
have always been freight, and
they have to be paid for. The
railways won’t pay unless there’s
freight, and lots of it.”
“But don’t you see, don’t you
understand, this is a real rail-
way game?”
“Well, then, it’s real freight,”
persisted Jamesie, “and it has
to be paid for.”
Uncle Vincent was consider-
ing giving him sixpence to recon-
cile him, when he caught sight
of Evelyn throwing stones over
the fence.
“It’s the Gundrys!” she
screamed. “They are laughing
at us.”
Uncle Vincent told her that a
ticket-collector’s job was to
watch her passengers.
“But there aren’t any pas-
sengers now. You threw them
out. Roofy and the stuffed
penguin. Mrs. Pumpkin and
Mr. Football always sat to-
gether.”
“Yes, I know. But I am trying
to show you children how a
railway game should be played.”
He . turned to continue his
argument with Jamesie, but the
freightman had disappeared. He
was at the back door where Mrs,
Meade was scraping a plate into
the dust-bin*
“I can smell apples, Mrs.
Meade, can’t you?”
‘‘Yes, Jamesie, it’s these
parings. I am making a pie,”
“No.” Jamesie shook his head,
“I can smell whole apples.”
Jamesie got his apple. He
went and sat on the verandah
step. The railway game was
still being organised.
“Come along, there! Come
along, James'!” called Uncle
Vincent.
“I’m not playing,” Jamesie
told him.
Tui, clasping the cracked jug,
sat down beside him.
“I’m not, either. It’s too hot.”
He was wistfully polite to Uncle
Vincent.
“But, bless my soul, boys, this
is your game, you invented it,
didn’t you? You like playing
your railway game, don’t you?
I stood watching you yesterday
for half an hour. Now come
along.”
“I don’t feel like playing now,
thank you,” and Tui accepted
a very small piece of apple from
Jamesie. He gazed thoughtfully
at the four Gundrys whose little
row of faces grinned with frank
callousness over the fence.
“Well, come on! Come on,
off we go!” Uncle Vincent
gave a shrill falsetto laugh which
Minnie, the eldest Gundry, imi-
tated with deplorable accuracy.
“Toot! Toot!”
Evelyn dropped her tickets.
Robert blew halfheartedly on
his whistle and pedalled off,
wagons clattering. He was fol-
lowed by Uncle Vincent, red in
the face, his arms spread out
and his old-fashioned watch-
chain jingling.
| T was very hot. Margaret felt
1 her lips cracking. There was
a twitch in her hand that held
the red flag, as if she held a tiny
captive bird—and she had a
queer stuffed feeling in her chest.
Through half-closed eyes she
could see the red peeling roof
of the wash-house, white walls,
her mother’s blue housecoat air-
ing on the line, tufts of sunburnt
grass, great clumps of marigolds
—broken lights of different in-
tensity and color, like bits of
glass in her kaleidoscope which
7 by reflection and multiplication
formed a distinct pattern.
Uncle Vincent had reached
the tunnel and was calling to her,
but, deep in her Valley of
Humiliation, Margaret did not
hear him. She wondered why
she had such exasperating rela-
tions. Oh, that dreadful, dread-
ful day of the Sunday school
picnic, when Grandfather had
pranced about singing “See me
dance the polka! Watch my
coat - tails fly!” Even the
Gundrys were reputed to be
descended from a man who once
owned a merry-go-round, and
to prove it there was half a
wooden horse, with an iron bar
in its middle, on their back
verandah. Jamesie’s mother had
a queer way of speaking, and
sometimes made a fool of
Jamesie, but she was otherwise
perfectly normal. Tui’s Maori
uncle was a rational being who
had, once taken them for a ride
in his car that had no windows
and doors fastened with bits of
string, wire and bent hairpins.
He had made them not exactly
sick but delightfully queasy on
ice-cream, fish and chips, choco-
late and lemonade. “Oh, please,
Uncle Vincent, please!” she
whispered to herself as a Gundry
fell backwards off the fence,
helpless with laughter.
With unquenchable energy
Uncle Vincent had restarted the
railway game.
“Come along, what are you
dreaming about, Margaretta,
lass? Come along, Robert, you’ll
soon get into the way of playing
it properly,”
“It was better when we had
Roofy,” said Evelyn in a
quarrelsome voice, and Gingy,
the brightest-haired of the
Gundry brood, gave a thin,
scornful laugh.
“We look just like a circus,
thought Margaret, and the
moment was blank and heavy.
Evelyn, who had been stand-
ing on one of the box-wagons,
suddenly toppled over, hitting
her head a whack against the dis-
carded Roofy. There was a
short silence while she fetched
her breath for a scream, and
when it came it brought her
mother running into the yard.
Evelyn turned to the fence,
but the Gundrys had vanished.
“Nigglewits!” she shouted, an
insulting word she had learned
from Chick Gundry. “Niggle-
wits!”
She was carried, sobbing
loudly, inside.
Uncle Vincent looked at his
depleted staff. Tui and James,
bored but determined, continued
their sit-down strike. Evelyn
had met with an honorable acci-
dent. Now Margaret approached
him. “I’m sorry. Uncle Vin-
cent, I’ll have to go now. It’s
my turn to get the milk.”
HE nodded grimly. “Well,
Robert, it looks as if you
and I will have to stick together
like true railwaymen. We’ll take
the express round just once more
for practifce, eh?”
“I “can’t,” said Robert. “I’ve
got an awful sore toe. There
was a thorn in it yesterday. I
can’t pedal any more.”
Here was a hurdle Whole-
heartedness could not take.

thought Uncle Vincent. I for-
got to get a toothbrush. By

ing, bilious headache, the result

Jamesie ventured a remark.
“He was drunk, wasn’t he?”
“I don’t think so.”
“Yes he was, Robert, Only
a drunk man would throw
freight into a wagon without
paying for it. His face was red
like a drunk’s, too.”
“You know,” said Tui,
“yesterday Bluey Gundry and I
went over the scoria to the clay-
bank and I stuck in two straws
and got two penny doctors out
right away.”
Robert leapt to his feet. “That
was a mad game, anyway. What
are we waiting here for? Last

the wreck in the yard. “Why
did you say it was your turn
to go for the milk when you
knew perfectly well that if is
Robert’s? Just look at the way
you have left all those nice pre-
sents from Uncle Vincent lying
about the yard! I’m sure the
Gundrys don’t give their mother
half the trouble you children
give me. Now, when you come
back you can set to and clean
up the yard. And don’t forget
poor Uncle Vincent’s aspirin.”

The Italian Minister for Cul-
ture threw up his hands in
despair.
“But-a how,” he demanded
vehemently, “can we increase

ence she can’t get enough of da

tell-a me, now? Da Italiano he
can produce not enough of

let alone use-a heem for to

The Premier, however, looked
cheerful. “I have-a da good
news, Signor Bullo!” he ex-
claimed. “Da door in da Iron

signment come to our country

fingers and opened them in a
gesture of rapture —“they will
make da opera-lovers up in da

da neck, good-a da grip, exact-a

“But there is more-a to come,

“More scrap-iron from Moscow,

cause dey like-a us, and as da

But the tidings had wrought
strangely on Signor Bullo, for
here he uttered a deep groan.
“Da Americano,” went on
Signor de Gasperi, “say it is-a

At this intimation the Minis-

a handful of his oiled moustache
out. “Not-a that. Gas,” he said
brokenly. “Da juke-box much-a
bad enough, but not-a Shosta-
kovitch ! ”
A week or so later the Premier
called his Cabinet together again
and announced that, spurred by
the falling stocks of the
Communist party and a fear that
he mightn’t be sending sufficient
“tourists” over the neighboring
borders to cast a multiplicity of
votes. Uncle Joe had, as a fra-
ternal gesture from one New
Democracy to another, con-
signed to the Italian Govern-
ment a shipload of knouts, balls-
and-chains, thumbscrews and
lead-filled hoses. This consti-
tuted a great sacrifice, as there
was in the U.S.S.R. itself a
huge demand for them which
industry, even on top priority,
couldn’t meet.
A few days later a further
meeting of Cabinet was in-
formed by Signor de Gasperi
that America would dispatch, to
arrive in Italy by a pure coinci-
dence the day before the elec-
tions, half a million mandolins
and 17,000,000 miles of maca-
roni. The offer was also made
of 47 Liberty ships, copyright
of the plot of the 34 films in
which appeared Frankenstein

loan of Henry Wallace, Harry
Bridges, Ben Hecht and the
Andrews Sisters, a half-interest
in Frankie Sinatra and 750,000
cubic feet of bubble-gum. Also
a half of Siberia when it shortly
ceased to be part of the Soviet.
“Dis is-a da grand news! ” ex-
ulted Singor Bullo. “We can

claimed. “What with-a da

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

In the Vineyards
I’ve just finished two weeks’ seasonal
work picking grapes at one of the
biggest vineyards in Australia.
Conditions, I suppose, were not really
bad. We worked in red clay to our ankles
for the first few days, in a series of
summer storms; then the sun came out
at 100 degrees and we worked in hot
mud and were sunburned. In a couple
of days a crust had formed on the earth
and we had to wear shoes. We stumbled
down the rows ruining our shoes in the
choppy earth and being blistered in the
sun. We welcomed the frequent rain be-
cause it was cool. The morning hours
were from 7.30 to 12 o’clock, when we
crawled in to eat our home-made lunches
leaning against walls or sitting about the
yard. At 12.45 p.m. the factory whistle
blew us back to work until 4.15 p.m.
The owners, of course, were not to blame
for the weather. But they were to blame
for making us walk to work. No lorry
met the people who came by train, to save
them the two-mile cross-country hike to
the vineyard. And we walked back at the
end of the day. The vineyard covers 400
acres, with grapes scattered all over it.
So we did route-marches through the mud
from field to field. We couldn’t have
walked less than 15 miles a day when
the running up and down rows was in-
cluded.
We were issued with numbered
kerosene-tins. Carriers took the full ones
to the dray and tossed back the empties.
Sometimes we had to carry buckets,
almost full, from one field to another.
We couldn’t blame the owners for con-
stant breakdowns in the factory which
held up the drays and in turn held us up.
We would stand on a distant hillside with
our two buckets full watching a dray
crawl towards us, half an hour away.
The rain spoilt the grapes this year—
many were shrivelled-up and tiny ; others
were too well developed—but they all had
to be picked. The grass was so high in
places it was 2ft. over the vines, and you
disappeared into a jungle inhabited by
frogs, snakes, hares, spiders and occasion-
ally sad and sour grapes.
Tally-clerk, overseer, the bucket-
carriers and the field workers were all in
sympathy with the pickers in this worst
season anyone remembers, but what
could they do? We agreed to work for
4d. a bucket, and, if we left, plenty of
others would take our places. The
manager couldn’t suddenly raise our
price.
But the owners could have. Granted
they have vineyards all over Australia,
but this one is right in their own back-
yard, half an hour from Sydney. They
should at least have come out once to see
the crop. I think anyone would have
altered the conditions had they seen them.
The girls often fainted in the Heat, and
we were often so tired we’d fall over in
the mud. Many of the men gave the
show away early in the piece and left us
to it. — Bucket 32 (N.S.W.).
Wine or Dried Fruit
The S.A. Dried Fruits District Associa-
tion is bemoaning the fact that, although
the sultana crop is in good condition
for drying, many blockers are sending
their fruit fresh to the distilleries for wine.
It is a pity, too, because the last couple
of years have been record ones for wine
production, while dried fruit has been
scarce.;
But the blocker can’t be blamed. Last
year dried sultanas brought £5O a ton;
this year the price will probably be £4B.
Distilleries are paying £l2 a ton for fresh
fruit. When the blocker sells his fruit
to the distillery he loads it on to a truck
and can then forget it. For drying
it he must cart it to the drying green,
dip it, spread it f *on the racks, shake it
on to hessian, and load it into sweats
for the packing sheds.. And, above all,
he has to take a chance on the weather!
It usually takes four tons of fresh sul-
tanas to make one ton of dried, so if the
prices for fresh and dried fruit are £l*2
and £4B per ton respectively, it doesn’t
take an Einstein to see that wages for the
extra labor for drying, plus the cost of
the hessian and dip materials, will be
that much loss. It’s a wonder any
fruit is being dried at all.—Taswegian
(S.A.). __
Food Parcels
Some months ago I sent a food parcel
to Scotland to my cpusin. Although
packed with usual care, a 30oz. tin of
pineapple burst and ran all through the
other food.
My cousin made a parcel of the faulty
tin and my wrapping and readdressed it
to the Queensland firm concerned, with
an accompanying letter of explanation.
Later a parcel of food from the firm
arrived and a letter from the manage-
ment expressing regret at the incident and
hoping the parcel would make up for
loss and disappointment. It was later
followed by another large parcel of the
firm’s products.
A nice gesture in this world of rackets
and blackmarkets. —C. M. (N.S.W.).
Nice Work
Taxpayers would probably groan a
little louder if they could see how their
money is dissipated in some Government
offices. The old days of heads down and
no talking at the approach of the boss,
with a little surreptitious tea-making,
have given way to wanderings from room
to room in search of social amenities, in-
cluding cups of tea, to relieve the tedium
of working hours. Long-winded sport-
ing arguments and trips to nearby coffee
shops are common.
Discipline has disappeared almost com-
pletely since the advent of girls in large
numbers. The days of the disciplinarian
are over and no man worth his salt does
or says anything that “puts him wrong
with the girls.” Even the terms “Mr.”
and “Miss” have fallen into disuse.
“Marys,” “Joans,” “Bills” and “Jacks,”
plus assorted nicknames, rule from the
near-top to the bottom of the office
social scale.
Still, the social activities of a group
with whom I shared a room for some
time—during which very little work was
done, or, apparently, expected—resulted
in two engagements, so taxpayers of a
romantic turn of mind might think it
worth the money.— Clio (Q ).
Used-car Deals
The new blanket-charge of £1 for all
car accessories will not stop the type of
racketeer I encountered recently. Three
of us were empowered, within limited
means, to buy a panel-van for use as a
district ambulance. We saw a potential
seller, who showed us his garden and
talked of everything but the van. Finally
I brought up the matter by offering him
the pegged price of £3OO. He made no
direct answer—just wasn’t keen to sell.
By degrees I raised to £650, and only
then did he suggest there was something
which would interest me inside the house.
He politely excluded the others from
following, and once inside (with his son
as witness) led me to a room with the
usual pictures on the wall.
“Like that landscape?” he asked.
“Quite nice,” I replied politely. “Perhaps
you’d care to buy it. The price is £350.”
By buying the “work of art”, we could
have got the van at its pegged price.
The Prices Commissioner shows an un-
real approach to the problem with his
new regulation. What is needed is a
reasonable increase in the pegged price
of the vehicle itself, with due allowance
for inflated values and the price of new
cars.— Carlyle (Vic.).
R.A.A.F. Squadrons
I don’t dispute “Waddlin’ Willie’s”
claims for Number Eight and Thirteen
Squadrons’ rights to be included in the
Permanent Air Force. Eight I know from
first-hand experience, being with them at
Tadji (N.G.), but I’d like to point out
that the only squadron which had real
tradition behind it was 100 Squadron.
In 1917 Lord Trenchard formed the
Independent Ain Force, and in it was
No. 100 Squadron, R.F.C, At the end
of the war Trenchard wrote of 100:
“This was one of the really great squad-
rons of the war.” On his recommenda-
tion it was incorporated into the peace-
time R.A.F. From 1917 until 1938 it
served without interruption and was in
Malaya when war broke out—flying
Vildebeestes.
“Q” Flight came to Australia to take
delivery of the first Australian-built
Beauforts; the rest of the squadron in
Malaya was annihilated. The Australian
flight, consisting of English officers and
Australian ground crew, became 100
Squadron, R.A.A.F., to commemorate
the old 100 Squadron. It served with
distinction throughout the New Guinea
campaign and was the first of the Beau-
forts in action in New Guinea.
Mr. Drakeford had the opportunity to
capitalise on the tradition handed down
first by the R.F.C. and later the R.A.F.
to 100 Squadron, R.A.A.F. Trenchard’s
judgment aftpr World War I can still be
repeated: “This was one of the really
great squadrons of the war.” — Repat-
riate (Q.).
Service Pensions
The long-awaited decision on the ser-
vices pension scheme has had a mixed
reception in the Navy. At a time when
the senior service is scratching for new
“Just break out the best Way you can , fellers;
there aren’t any doors!"
entries, signing them on for as little as
five years, the 20-year catch in the present
scheme will act more as a deterrent than
an inducement.
Under the deferred-pay system a man
sarving 12 years and deciding to try a
new sphere had £5OO in cash behind him.
Now, it appears, he must serve the full
20 years from the age of 20 or leave
the service with nothing.
A more sensible distribution—and one
likely to appeal to potential recruits—
would be to pay a man his deferred pay
if, at the end of 12 years, he wished to
leave, but offer the proposed pension
as an inducement to serve 20 years.
The new scheme is counted on to en-
liven recruiting. With good shore jobs
plentiful, an offer to a prospective able
seaman of a pension of less than £2 per
week after 20 years at sea is not very
attractive, — Conda (N.S.W.).
Land Sales
Another unsatisfactory feature of Land
Sales Control (B. 25/2/’4B) is the time
that elapses before vendors and buyers
find that they have made no progress
with their negotiations. It is still com-
mon for months to pass before any sort
of decision is received from the depart-
ment. The accepted method of over-
coming the difficulty is to treat at the
Valuer-General’s valuation (in N.S.W.)
as far as the contract is concerned, or
at the price indicated by the Treasury
as being acceptable to it. Any differ-
ence is adjusted privately over a pot or
so, and, since buyers are generally advised
by a valuer and treat on a basis con-
sistent with today’s demand for property,
they are generally buying at a fair market
value, even if the Treasury won’t admit it.
Only when the Treasurer abolishes the
regulations will the undercover business
disappear and prices revert to a con-
sistent level. Plenty of property is avail-
able and would be thrown into the market
if controls were lifted. Such a release
would ensure that the demand was
supplied and would prevent any infla-
tion in prices.
Taxpayers are paying out just on
£91,000 this year to control property
prices, which is another argument for the
abolition of the business. — Jindivick
(N.S.W.).
Airport Charges
A.N.A. has announced that it is think-
ing about establishing its own airports
and navigation aids to avoid paying the
new airport charges levied by Civil Avia-
tion Department. That airport charges are
not necessary to make an airport a paying
concern has been very clearly demon-
strated at the Teterbqro privately-owned
terminal 16 miles from the heart of New
York.
Established during the 1914-18 war, it
was known as the Ankle-deep airport
because of its mud. Bought by Fred
Wehran in 1941, its development as a
private commercial airport was only pos-
sible in 1945, but the strides it has made
since then show what is possible, under
energetic private enterprise, without the
imposition of any airport landing-charges.
For the airport—3so acres of swamp-
land which had been drained but only
equipped with grass runways—Wehran
paid a deposit of 10,000 dollars as an
option, and then by scraping up every
dollar and raising a personal loan he
mustered the necessary 75,000 dollars
deposit to buy the property. The vendor
took a mortgage for the balance of
450,000 dollars. Now, after much borrow-
ing and improvements, there is an asset
conservatively valued at 1,500,000 dollars,
plus a stack of buildings erected by
tenants for which Wehran collects
ground-rents.
Having got his toehold, the new owner
approached the Standard Oil Company
with a “million-dollar programme” in
exchange for the exclusive sale rights, on
the airport, of their pro-
ducts. The company
agreed to advance
1,100,000 dollars to pay
off the existing mortgage,
erect hangars, put down
3000 ft. of paved runways
and buy an adjoining area
of 200 acres. It took a
10-year first mortgage for
the advance over the whole
of the assets, and the in-
terest has since been met
with promptness on due
dates.
Even Wehran did not
visualise the rapid growth
into a’ top-ranking com-
mercial airport. He had
intended to cater only for
light training-aircraft and
those privately-owned, but
the absence of landing
charges encouraged freight
companies to make
Teterboro their head-
quarters. In Jantiary,
1946, petrol sales were only 5427 gallons
a month, but 12 months later they had
risen to 170,000 and, by the end of 1947,
to 300,000. On the normal Australian
basis of reseller’s commission the revenue
would be £3750 per month.
Outside petrol and oil sales, revenue
comes from ground-rents (12,000 dollars),
aircraft parking areas (1000 dollars), fleet
of limousines on a percentage basis
(600 dollars), all on monthly basis, and
rental of a dining-room and car-service-
station. Flying instruction at one dollar
per flying-hour brought 36,000 dollars in
1946 ; in 1947 a cut to half a dollar an
hour caused a phenomenal jump in flying
time.
A.N.A. appears to have something in
the idea of building its own airports. If
successful they would probably attract
all private airlines and leave Civil Avia-
tion airports to the Government. —H.
Bowden Fletcher (N.S.W.).
No War?
If Mr. Chifley does not expect war for
at least 10 to 15 years, in what category
does he place recent events in Europe
and the industrial disturbances in this
country? Because past wars have been
won with anything from bows and
arrows to atom bombs, it does not fol-
low that they will always be fought that
way. An insidious economic and
sociological attack can be just as devas-
tating—Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Czecho-
slovakia have already fallen to such
attacks; Finland, Italy and Greece are
“under fire,” and Turkey is afraid of simi-
lar onslaught.
In Australia Communists, shrewd and
ruthless, are developing the same offen-
sive, They have gained control of key
unions, disrupted our economic life and
are flat out to foment civil disturbances.
Masaryk and the patriots of the Bal-
kans died on a battlefield as real as those
of Tobruk, Timor and Tara we. The
weapons used against them were different
in nature but not in effect. Once con-
quered, their countries were swept as clear
of effective opposition as was Hiroshima
when the atom bomb struck it.
Mr. Chifley cannot see war within the
next 10 years because he cannot foresee
an immediate repetition of 1939-45 opera-
tions. He should look deeply at the
pattern taking shape in every country in
the world where Communism is making
itself felt. He should look extra long at
Australia, giving special attention to Bris-
bane, and then decide if war —a struggle
to death between freedom and slavery—
is not now in full force. More able men
than Mr. Chifley—and men no less repre-
sentative of the masses of workers in
their respective countries —have already
decided and are making most effective
counter-attacks against the Red menace.

Perhaps our wheat authorities have
never seen a real mouse-plague in the
country. When the feed’s good, mice
breed unbelievably fast. This season the
rain beat down crops, which, though
saved by modern machinery, have shed
thousands of bushels of grain. That was
the free feed which field-mice wanted.
And things look good enough for them
to continue —and maybe repeat their 1918
visitation.
In that year they swarmed across the
land, eating and destroying seed-wheat,
sown-wheat, saddles, fowl-feed, fat, cart-
ridge-cases and even human hair (of
heavy sleepers). We poisoned, trapped
and shot them. Cats sickened of them;
dogs ignored them. They got into seed-
wheat on trestles over tin turnovers.
With a corrugated-iron yard laid side-on
and running to a narrow corner they were
hustled into a big washing-tub of cold
water. A fair estimate was 2000 mice
in each tubful and we buried five tubfuls
in one night. Yet it seemed to have no
effect on the hordes milling around in
the moonlight.
That was out near Jemalong, between
Forbes and Condobolin (N.S.W.), on the
Lachlan. The pests invaded our beds in
hundreds if a sheet fell .loose; they
scurried up our legs at dinner-time and
if you walked outside at night the ground
seemed to be moving.
After burrowing down the furrows in
a sown wheat paddock and getting every
grain from 10 acres, the whole plague
moved on in one night.
Where did they go? Maybe the Pied
Piper enticed them up Narromine way.
But if all that wheat had been lying about
as it is today, no mice with any sense
would leave it until they’d finished the
lot. — Pat Ater (N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
In almost every city, suburb or country
town there is that odd piece of land,
half-grown with grass and with a couple
of stunted trees and three or four seats.
It is called a “park,” but it generally is
unfrequented, a, monument of ennui in
the daytime and a dark, windy, desolate
place at 1 night. Yet people clamor for
more parks and more breathing-space
for young folk, and so forth. Every park
should be illuminated and every square
yard of the land could be laid out in
tennis-courts, croquet-lawns and basket-
ball areas. It would be one of the best
possible ways of keeping the youngsters
off the streets. — Forward (N.S.W.).
A university professor deploring the
poor spoken and written expression of
many otherwise brilliant students failed
to suggest the obvious cause and cure.
Most students find time to read maga-
zines and novels. If they read them
audibly they would acquire a fair voca-
bulary and cease to be afraid of their
own voice. If they sacrificed an hour of
desultory reading every week to writ-
ing an essay on any subject they would
be amazed at the self-expression gained
after a few months.—No Charge (S.A.).
Australian trade-unions would be held
in far wider regard if they were not
affiliated with the Labor party. Trade-
unionism was strong in Australia before
the Labor party came into existence, and
it is a pity that the unions ever allowed
themselves to be tied to it. By refusing
connection with any political organisa-
tion they would have been courted by
all and would have been in a position
to do more for their members than has
been accomplished. Many would join
them who now stand aloof, or are even
actively critical. — Castlereagh (N.S.W.).
The main roads of N. S. Wales may
be f.a.q., but most of the “arterial
“What's his trouble , doctor?"
“You, I'd say!"
roads” are in a shocking condition.
There seems to be something lacking in
the whole setup of maintenance. Shire
repair-gangs fill in potholes and gutters
and the graders clear off corrugations,
but the first sharp rain‘scours out the
gutters and potholes again, and corru-
gations are just as bad, or worse, within
a few weeks. Then the whole process
is repeated. This kind of work seems to
be a waste of the ratepayers’ money.
Enlarging shires and councils might cut
overhead costs and raise efficiency. —

I can have my choice of many types
of bath-heaters and showers, and an
almost unlimited selection of bath-mats.
bath-curtains, towel-rails, soap- and
sponge-holders and taps and hotwater
services. Yet I’m told that it will be at
least 18 months before I can buy a bath.
Surely the manpower and materials used
in making unessential articles could be
diverted to more necessary things.

HARRY’S PINCH
By BRIAN JAMES
(( I ’M going back to Harry’s Pinch —
I tonight.” The tones were shrill,
I angry and postalgic. Neighbors
listened with interest and specula-
tion; and said, “There’s that poor Mrs.
Madden again! ” or “There she is again—
and a pity she doesn’t. But no such
luck!” The difference in comment was
due to sympathy or otherwise.
About once a month Mrs. Madden
made the public pronouncement of her
intention to return to Harry’s Pinch —
tonight. Sometimes it was more often
than that, but seldom less. And it would
seem to be a sort of climax, an ultimate
peak of exasperation and discontent with
things as they were, for mostly there was
the prefatory explanation, “I’m fed up
with everything ; for good and all.”
The Maddens had by far the best house
in the street, a big, cool bungalow, and
much more ground than anyone else. It
stood on the highest part, and the street
sloped gently away on each side. From
the wide front verandah one looked over
miles and miles of Sydney’s outer suburbs,
houses and trees, red roofs and grey:
green foliage, mixed and blended ; and
so on right down to the blur of nearer
suburbs and city proper; and beyond
these, on clear days, to the yellow sand-
hills and the narrow gleam of Botany
Bay; and even beyond again to the dark
lines of hills and the Sanatorium at!
Waterfall.
“What a lovely view you have!” said
anyone who beheld it from that front
verandah, and Mrs. Madden, her mouth
like a thin, hard pencil-line, would gaze
at it grimly, and say, “Um!” which
seemed to mean “You can’t live on a
view.” And then, after an awful pause,
she would say, “7 used to think so —
once.”
BETWEEN house and street was a
stretch of lawn, smooth-shaven green
buffalo, with two thriving deodars, one
on each side of the red-gravelled walk ;
on one side of the house was a similar
gravelled car-drive, lined with golden
firs and standard roses ; and on the other
side of’the house was more lawn studded
with diamond-shaped flower-beds. At the
back were orchard trees and some tall
bluegums. So, in itself, its setting and its
view, the Madden home was lovely.
The Maddens were not happy. At least,
though, they had a beautiful place to be
unhappy in. That should have been some
compensation.
Mrs. Madden was constructed on long,
thin lines. She was forty, perhaps, but
might well have been fifty—or more.
Her face was as sharp and hard as her
voice, her black hair had an uncom-
promising quality to it, somehow, and
her dark eyes had the trick of transferring
everything to distance —no matter how
close things were, they were viewed from
a long way off. Perhaps it was the far-
away and long-ago Harry’s Pinch that
did this for her.
Mr. Madden was much of a contrast,
and quite circular in plan: his ruddy
face was round, his body had circumfer-
ence, he had a fat round neck, his
generous behind ran to an almost perfect
circle, and his legs, when he sat down,
were a series of oval shapes. While Mrs.
Madden’s voice was a flight of arrows,
Mr. Madden’s was the rising of bubbles
to the surface of a still pool. ,
“He’s such a nice fellow, he really is,
was the general summing-up of Mr.
Madden. This estimate was also an un-
spoken condemnation of Mrs. Madden,
and sometimes it went beyond that to
“Whatever did he see in her ?” That was
a mystery, and likely as not Mr. Madden
himself pondered over it, too. For here
was all too obvious incompatibility in
temperament as well as incongruity in
shape. 4
There were two little Madden girls who
were principally skinny legs and long
plaits ; and there were two Madden boys
who looked as if they had been fed on
dumplings all their lives. . The children
ranged themselves into opposing camps
when Harry’s Pinch was on the air.
The girls were determined to accom-
pany their mother to that distant place,
and the boys declared they would stay
with father." There was much pleasur-
able anticipation about this, a prospect
of change and adventure. The little girls
freely discussed the matter with the few
children they were allowed to know . . .
“Mother is going back to Harry’s Pinch,
you know, and we are going with her.
Sid and Henry are staying with Father.”
There y/as nicety and precision in the
arrangement, and something eminently
fair in the division.
The boys, though attracted to the
journey and the very sound of the name
Harry’s Pinch, considered they would,
on the whole, have a better time with
Father. But they didn’t quarrel with
the girls about it, nor did they view the
separation as anything but perfectly
natural and inevitable.
ALL that belonged to the earlier stages
of Mrs. Madden’s announcements.
As Mrs. Madden didn’t go back to
Harry’s Pinch for all her saying so, the
children at last ceased to plan, relegating
the great event to that impossible future
when you got married, or had grand-
children, or died. Just something that
would happen —“Some day, I suppose.”
And yet Harry’s Pinch was all past life.
No one who listened to Mrs. Madden’s
shrill longing to go there had any clear
notion as to where the place might be.
Bethlehem or Babylon or Eldorado were
as close and as real. But there was some
fascinating quality about the name-
something poetic and romantically
pioneering. There was even the fantastic
suggestion of some long-ago lover who
was playfully inclined. Mrs. Madden,
however, never explained where Harry s
Pinch was, or how you got there —it was
vaguely over the hills far away.
But there was peace there, and a- pick-
ing-up again of the threads of time, and
the recapture of youth that had vanished
here for all the fine view there might be.
And .an escape from Mr. Madden ...
There were at Harry’s Pinch green
fields and bright woodlands, and good
people, happy, kindly, and never growing
old. It was a place where time stood
still, and there was no change. For
change always means going ffom worse
to worse . . . There would be mother
and father, not a whit altered, to welcome
the wanderer ; and the great world could
roll on as it would —at Harry’s Pinch all
things would always be the same.
MR. MADDEN was- a produce-
merchant, in quite a big way, too.
“That’s how he got to know her in the
first place, you know. They grow a lot
of oats at Harry’s Pinch.”
This was slim conjecture, but there may
have been something in it, too. If any-
thing, it added a definite detail to the
vague picture of Harry’s Pinch.
Mr. Madden played bowls on Satur-
days, and several times during the week.
Big produce-merchants can find time to
do that, and, anyway, Mr. Madden had
been specially designed by nature for the
playing of bowls.
“Bowls again!” Mrs. Madden would
say. “I’m sure I’ve done everything
possible.” That was condemnation of
the game that took Mr. Madden away
from home so much. And she would
watch him rolling down the gravel path,
not unlike a bowl himself.
“Another meeting! Oh, the lodge this
time, is it?” Mrs. Madden didn’t believe
in lodge meetings, or business meetings,
or “seeing someone about something,” or
the hundred-and-one things that took
Mr. Madden out.
“Well, Ella, let us take a run out some-
where in the car,” Mr. Madden would
say sometimes.
“Likely,” Mrs.'Madden would reply,
“There are plenty of others who would
sooner go than I would. Likely! 7
would rather not go,”
“Well, Ella/’ at another time, “let us
go to a theatre.”
“Likely! I don’t want to go to a
theatre. Some people might like to go to
theatres. I don’t.”
It hadn’t been so bad in the days when
Mr. Madden would quarrel with her.
There was some relief in quarrelling. It
was a lot worse now that he wouldn’t
quarrel any more. He didn’t even shrug
his fat shoulders any more. There was
none of the doubtful pleasure of hurting
him any more. He didn’t tell her any
more that she was jealous. Neighbors
said Mrs. Madden was very jealous; and
they held that a woman who was so thin
and ugly and possessed of such a rasping
voice had every good reason to be
jealous.
Consequently, it was no little joy to
the neighbors to behold the name of the
home on an expensive plate on the front
gate, “Bon Accord.” That was the sort
of ironic joke that life played on other
people. And it was said, over and over,
“It’s terrible the way they live”; and
“It’s not fair to the children.” There was
a deal of satisfaction in all that, for it
implied a comparison with the affairs of
those who spoke so, which, all things
fairly considered, were not nearly so bad.
But “apart from that,” it had to be
conceded that Mrs. Madden was a good
neighbor. “Standoffish” a bit, if you like,
and not allowing the children to “mix”
much ; but she didn’t interfere, and she
didn’t “talk” about others. It was strange,
perhaps, that she should get credit for
the matter of not talking, especially in a
world so given to the luxury. And it was
granted, too, that she was “kind enough
in her own way,” >|hich was somehow
different from other people’s way. You
could always rely on her to give to col-
lections, and when Mrs. Roger’s little girl
scalded herself Mrs, Madden helped as
much as anyone ; and when the little girl
died Mrs. Madden, it was said, helped
with the expense, for the Rogers were
very poor,
THEN Mrs. Madden got very sick her-
self. Perhaps it was coming on a
long time, but it seemed sudden. The
doctors said she would have to go under
an operation. They said it wasn’t
necessarily serious, but it had to be
immediate.
The operation was successful, too, but
what are generally called “complications”
set in. These are always the fault of the
patient in some way or other, and en-
tirely absolve the surgeon. As soon as
you hear that complications have set in
you know the matter is hopeless. It was
so in'Mrs. Madden’s case.
She came back from hospital with her
complications and a nurse. But in spite
of the skill of the doctors and the. nurse
she persisted in dying. It was said that
there was a complete reconciliation with
Mr. Madden before the end. Just what
good that did for all the years that had
gone was hard to say. But it was nice to
think it just the same. Anyway, Mr.
Madden took it very hard, which was a
credit to him, and he got a lot of extra
sympathy on that account.
And it might have been in accordance
with a dying wish —at least it was hoped
so —that Mr. Madden took her back to
Harry’s Pinch (wherever that was) for
burial. It was decent of him to do that,
for it didn’t really matter to her now.
Still, she was getting back to Harry’s
Pinch and would be staying there. And
it must have been a frightful expense,
too, for “They charge you what they like
when they have you like that.”
When Mr. Madden came back from
Harry’s Pinch he married the nurse, and
thereby lost nearly all the credit he had
been storing up. .“It just goes to show,
though,” said the neighbors. In which
there was much wisdom. The nurse got
no credit at all, and the less so, if possible,
that she was young and plump and
pretty. “So there!” summed her up
fairly accurately.
The nurse came from the suburb of
Burwood originally, and there might have
been some obscure advantage in that, it
being so muth handier than Harry’s
Pinch —wherever that might be.

'Caterpillar” D 7 Diesel Tractor topping a stockpile.
Another “Caterpillar” Diesel Tractor unit with cable

“Caterpillar” units will handle 750.000 cubic yards to
fill in this area.
ill WENTY-FOUR "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors are speeding the construction
of the £5,000,000 Kingsford Smith Airport at Mascot, • New South Wales,
shifting 9,000,000 yards of material at the rate of 25,000 to 30,000 tons per week.
Kingsford Smith Airport will be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, covering
an area of approximately 2,000 acres, with runways up to 10,000 feet long and 300
feet wide to accommodate the world’s largest air liners.
The diversion of the Cook’s River into Botany Bay, one mile south of its present
outlet, by cutting a channel 600 feet wide by 24 feet deep and H miles long,
calls for the moving of 2,500,000 yards of earth. The balance of the 9,000,000
yards of material to be moved will be made up in raising the ’drome level by 9 feet
and filling in the existing river. No less than 6,000,000 yards will come from
the dredging of Botany Bay and 500,000 yards from the nearby sand dunes. The
bulk of this work will be done by "Caterpillar” Diesel D 6, D 7, and D 8 Track-
Type Tractors with cable-controlled Dozers, and No. 12 Diesel Motor Graders.
Operating in loose sand and on swampy ground under the most gruelling
conditions, the "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors, with their rugged construction,
tremendous power and easy mobility, give the maximum of sustained traction
power, with the minimum of fuel consumption that makes "Caterpillar” a byword
for economy. Fitted with all-weather seals and filters that shut out the abrasive sand
and protect vital parts, replacements arc reduced to the barest minimum.
To maintain the rate of excavation and increase output as the urgency of the job
demands, "Caterpillar” Diesel Traction and Earth-Moving Equipment help speed
still one more national project to a successful conclusion, economically and on time!
