THE BULLETIN” BOOK EXCHANGE.
On receipt at The Bulletin Office, Sydney, of Postal Order, Postal Notes, or Stamps equal to the price stated (which is
published price with postage added), books in the subjoined list will be forwarded to any Australasian address.
SOME RECENT BOOKS.
By Reef and Palm, Louis Becke’s fine set
of South Sea tales, is to hand in fresh
quantity (paper, Is 9d ; cloth, 2s 4d), and
orders addressed to The Bulletin office
will be promptly filled. All admirers of
Becke’s talent will be glad to hear that
his book continues to sell brilliantly, and
is so far the success of Unwin’s “ Autonym
Library.”
The Play Actress, by S. R. Crockett (paper,
Is 9d), is the fourth volume in that series,
and is pretty thin and weary. Crockett is
neither a Barrie nor a Stevenson, and since
“ The Raiders ” he has written nothing in
any waf r memorable.
The New Party, by various authors (sloth,
2s lOd), is a cheaper reprint of the big
book in which the Isocrats, or equal-rulers,
some time ago announced their advent.
So far, the New Party seems to have fallen
rather flat ; and the book in which they
bring the socialistic creed up to date con-
tains rather too much emotional rhetoric,
and waves too many fine ideas too wildly,
to be of much intellectual profit.
Harry Custance’s Riding Recollections (cloth,
3s) is also a reprint of a bigger book ; and
sporting men will find the reminiscences
of the well-known jockey very readable
indeed.
The Parasite, by Conan Doyle (paper, Is 3d),
is a short, readable, ephemeral tale, with
a moral pointed against wicked hypnotists
and indiscreet hypnotees.

THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER"
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It vvill not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
■ complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
i perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
w'ith the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim for this,
■ or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
I properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER”
iLIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
• work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRV
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
. only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER" PILL is registered as our
i trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
i thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors.

Itching* Skin Humors
Torturing, Disfigitring Eczemas
And every species of itching, burning, bleeding; scaly, crusted, pimply,
and blotchy skin and scalp diseases are relieved in the majority
of cases by a single application, and speedily, permanently and
economically cured by the Cuticura
Remedies when the best physicians,
hospitals, and all other remedies fail.
No language can exaggerate the suf-
fering of those afflicted with these dis-
eases, especially of little babies, whosQ
tender skins are literally on fire.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and agreeable to the most sensi-
tive, and may be used on the youngest
infant and most delicate invalid with
gratifying and unfailing success.
Cuticura, the great skin cure, instantly allays
the most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, heals raw and irri-
tated surfaces, cleanses the scalp of crusts and scales, and restores the hair. Cuticura
Soap, the only medicated toilet soap, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces.
Cuticura Resolvent, the new blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor reme-
dies, cleanses the blood of all impurities, and thus removes the cause. Hence, the
Cuticura Remedies cure every humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss of hair.

Life's Paradoxes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Strange ! The man who works the hardest never
makes a pile of pelf.
And the flirt who flirts most madly sometimes
falls in love herself ;
Strange 1 The bogus banks have buildings in the
very finest style,
And the simpler the Celestial looks the deeper is
his guile;
And the wight who wades in wickedness feels not
the direst woes,
And the man who drinks the deepest doesn’t have
the reddest nose.
Strange! that when the man who owes us leaves,
we’re all with anguish torn,
Bub when the man who pays departs there’s not a
soul to mourn ;
Strange ! The rooster on the steeple, though he’s
only made of tin,
Is more famous than the live one with his merry
morning din ;
And the fool who boasts a title (like the steeple-
cock on high)
Is looked up to and respected when a sage is hustled
by.
Strange 1 The man who stoops the lowest nearly
always rises high,
And the parson says we only live to learn the way
to die;
Strange 1 We hail the badge of slav’ry as the
banner of the free,
And we nail the thieves and prophets side by side
upon the tree ;
Strange ! The heathen throng the thickest where
the clergy tithe the sod,
And thousand temples rise to Man for one that’s
built to God.

Dear Bulletin, —Is the kangaroo a hideous
animal? Mrs. Henry Wood (a bad novelist, but
the best-read of the day) writes thus in “Lord
Oakburn’s Daughters," p. 355 : “If she were as
hideous as a kangaroo.” I always considered the
kangaroo and horse the most graceful animals I
have seen, especially the red kangaroo. They are
certainly a long way before either the aborigine or
Chinaman, both in point of good looks and clean-
liness. And have you ever seen the kangaroo pro-
perly drawn ? In nearly every advt. his tail is
wrong, be., doubled round towards the point. Now,
a kangaroo always wears his tail straight out
behind. The socub-wallaby, however, gets his
between his legs when camped. I claim that
kangaroos are bipeds.same as Mrs. Henry Wood
herself, and, like her, make soup out of their tales.—

“Outis,” of Sydney Telegraph, lately
complained, with the voice of one personally in-
jured, that Premier Rosebery is going the way of
all upstarts. When he was a small politician,
just visible on the horizon, he was profoundly
deferential to the press—he was deucedly civil to
it, by the way, when in Sydney, and used to stay
up talking to scribes till four in the morning—but
since his elevation to the premiership he has as-
sumed a lofty attitude and looks on the Archi-
medean lever as so much offal. “ It>is human
nature, no doubt, that beggars thus straddled on
swift horses should ride rapidly devilwards.”
Now Rosebery, as it happens, isn’t known to have
shown any special signs of inflation, and even if
he had, there is no visible reason for the D. TVs
agonised wail on the subject. In reality it is
N.S.W. Premier Reid and not Rosebery that the
Telegraph is wailing about. Reid was a tame
politician in days gone by, and used to feed out of
the hand, and Telegraph reporters used to bail
him up in the street and demand information,
which was always given cheerfully. But now
Reid, who used to rush round to several newspaper
offices and write leading articles, doesn’t feed
out of the hand any longer, and he tells the reporter,
per medium of his office flunkey, to call next cen-
tury, and the Telegraph curses Rosebery instead
of him, because it doesn’t want to show that it is
hurt and yet it must curse somebody. In which
respect it is very like the cross individual who
comes home and kicks the dog because it would
damage his Christian character if he kicked his
wife.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1895.
Practical Federation.
The appointment of Mr. Eddy to be Chief
Commissioner of New South Wales rail-
roads for another seven years is one of the
most fortunate things which has happened
to that province since Parkes’ retirement
from politics. The Sew South Wales rail-
ways represent £36,000,000 of borrowed
money, and the management or mismanage-
ment of this stupendous asset is therefore a
matter of the first importance. It is pos-
sible, as experience has shown, to so elabo-
rately misconduct the lines as to make them
combine bad accommodation, heavy charges,
and a very serious annual loss which has to
be made good out of the public revenue. It
is also possible to so conduct them that the
charges may be reduced, the accommodation
immensely improved, and the lines made
nearly, if not quite, self-supporting. Until
the advent of Commissioner Eddy there had
never been, either in New South Wales,
Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, or Maori-
land, a railway - manager who adapted
himself thoroughly to the conditions of
the country. Some, like Speight, being
themselves of English origin, insisted
on constructing the whole railway system
on the English pattern, regardless of
the fact that a country where the average
population equals five persons to four square
miles cannot run its lines on the same prin-
ciples as one that supports 200 or 300 times
as many people on a similar area. Others
had been brought up among local conditions,
but lacked technical training ; and between
the two classes the history of Australian
railroad control was mostly a story of
muddle, drift and hapless experiment. Until
the advent of Eddy, the State railways of
Australia were, in some respects, almost as
ghastly a financial failure as the private rail-
ways of the United States and many other
countries, and the community owes him a
debt of gratitude for proving that State con-
trol can be more efficient, more honest and
more profitable than is private enterprise,
and that, too, under immeasurably worse
conditions.
« « •
How much worse these conditions are is a
matter which is seldom taken into account.
In the first place, Australia has a larger
extent of railway in proportion to population
than any other land in the world. The only
countries which anything like approach it in
this respect are Canada and the United
States, and even they are some distance
behind. Moreover, many of the lines in
the United States and almost all of those
in Canada were assisted by large Govern-
ment subsidies in money or land, or both ;
and the private companies which own them
have only to earn interest on their own
capital and debentures, which often repre-
sent little or no more than half the actual
cost of construction. In Australia, on the
other hand, the railways are expected to
earn interest on their entire cost, which
places them at a serious disadvantage when
comparisons are instituted between them
and the American “ roads.” Moreover, the
Australian lines are laid out, to a great
extent, by political amateurs, and laid out
badly as a consequence ; they were built
with about the most expensive labor on earth;
the materials employed were imported at
great cost from the furthest end of the globe,
most of them at a time when freights were
very much higher than they are at present;
and the capital required was borrowed at
prices ranging from four to eight per cent.
All these charges incidental on construction
in a new country were debited to the rail-
ways, which started work handicapped with
a heavy load of indebtedness and many other
disadvantages.
• # #
Then, for many years, the system of man-
agement was even a shade worse than that
of construction. To put it at its worst, it is
only needful to say that it was almost as bad
as that which prevails on most of the United
States railroads—a condemnation which is
sufficiently sweeping for all purposes. Under
thoroughly efficient control, it is quite possi-
ble to bring things to such a point of perfec-
tion that a respectable mediocre person may
'thereafter keep them in excellent working
order merely by maintaining the policy
which he inherited from his predecessor; but
until the advent of Commissioner Eddy none
of the Australian railway systems even had a
chance to attain such a condition. Their
management was equal to the average, but
the conditions of the country made it
essential that it should be much better than
the average if satisfactory results were to be
attained.
• • •
Meanwhile, the fact that New South Wales
has secured for a lengthened term the
services of the only thoroughly successful
expert in Australasia suggests an opportunity
of taking the first practical step towards
that much-talked-of Federation which, so
far, has consistently refused to come any
nearer. The Victorian railways are just
now in a worse condition than for many
years past. Less than a decade ago they
were about the most prosperous and re-
putedly the best-managed in these provinces.
The unspeakable Gillies-Deakin Coalition,
however, started them on a short road to
ruin by a frantic policy of extension which
consisted in building useless scrag-ends of
line in all directions, according to no possible
system, and apparently for no purpose save
to secure political support. The wild ex-
travagances of the magnificent Speight— in
his own way almost as lavish as Gillies—
completed the wreck. Since Speight’s
fall a succession of mediocrities have pot-
tered with the State’s principal asset, and
have economised in a helpless, shiftless
fashion by postponing repairs and reducing
the smaller class of salaries, and by doing
various other things in an ineffectual sort of
way which utterly fails to meet the emer-
gency. Victoria is urgently in want just
now of a railway expert who is many degrees
above the average—just such a one as New
South Wales possesses. Both provinces, too,
profess to want Federation, and only recently
Premiers Dibbs and Patterson seriously
considered a scheme of commencing the
unification of Australia by a combination of
the two States which they represented,
leaving the others to enter the league at
their leisure. This proposal for making a
small beginning in the great work of unifica-
tion presently dropped out of sight, as all
similar proposals have done. It might,
therefore, be worth while to consider the
advisability of making a still smaller begin-
ning by combining the two railway systems
underonemanagement, and offering Mr. Eddy
the position of commissioner to two provinces
at a salary of, say, £6OOO a year, or whatever
other sum may be considered adequate for
the office.
• •
The difficulties in the way of such a
proceeding are doubtless great, but they are
by no means insuperable. The arrangement
would resemble in some measure the familiar
“ pool ” of the American railroad companies,
only its object would be increased efficiency
and economy, not the fleecing of the public
by enhanced charges. The two provinces, so
far as their assets are concerned, would
enter into a tolerably equal partnership.
Victoria owned, at the close of 1893, about
2950 miles of railway, much of it profitless,
and New South Wales only 2400 ; but the
Victorian lines were built for an average cos
of £2OOO per mile less than those of her
neighbor, so that the capital on which in-
terest has to be paid is almost identical.
Owing to easier gradients the working ex-
penses for each mile run are much less in
Victoria than in New South Wales; the
passenger traffic is also very much larger,
while the goods traffic is practically the
same. Under these conditions the Victorian
system, with equally good management,
would almost certainly be at least as profit-
able as that of New South Wales—in fact,
until the disastrous Gillies-Speight com-
bi nation came upon the country the southern
province showed the better average of the
two, and its present abject condition merely
goes to prove how the finest State property
in Australasia has been wrecked by Duncan,
the boomer, and his associates.
* * m
The best combination which could be de-
vised would be effected by consolidating the
railway debts of the two provinces and
making both equally liable for principal and
interest, and by combining the two systems
with one management, one working staff,
one tariff, one uniform gauge, and one Par-
liamentary head. But this would involve
absolute Federation, and that is a result
which is still apparently very far off, and
which seems to get no nearer as the years go
by. All that can be done in the present is
to effect a species of partnership which may
serve a good purpose until something better
can be arrived at. The rival systems could
be placed under one set of Commissioners,
thus saving a considerable outlay in salaries.
They could be managed, so far as the superior
officials are concerned, by a joint staff,
which affords room for very extensive econo-
mies in the engineering, stores, and other
departments. Now that the boom in railway
construction is over, and the lines are being
extended by a very gradual process, in many
of the railway offices one set of experts could
easily do the work of two, and a large reduc-
tion in the annual salary-list would thus be
effected. The war of rates on the border
could be wholly abandoned, a uniform tariff
being substituted for the two erratic ones
now in force, and by this means much need-
less accountancy could be saved. Also, there
is no reason, save interprovincial jealousies,
why the work of future construction should
not be placed under the control of a joint
parliamentary committee, consisting of an
equal number of representatives from each
province ; and the free pass of every M.L.A.
might be made good over the railways from
the Queensland border to the debateable
land which divides Victoria from South
Australia. This is probably all that could be
done in the meantime ; for while the present
discrepancy exists between the net profits,
and until the Victorian system gets out of
the slough of bankruptcy to which it was
reduced under the Gillies regime, no actual
fusion is possible. But if, as may reason-
ably be expected, the two systems should
become in a few years about equally pros-
perous, there is no reason why they should
not be consolidated, with one staff and one
system of book-keeping, and the proceeds
be equally divided between the two
Treasuries.
* # *
The saving to be effected by such a policy
must, under economical management, be
necessarily large, though no exact estimate
of the amount can be arrived at. The
control of 5000 miles of iron road is doubt-
less a large order, but it is by no means
beyond the powers of one man of command-
ing ability—there are at least two railway
systems of twice these dimensions in exist-
ence under a single control. The success of
the experiment would depend wholly on one
efficient head, and an ample supply of
capable subordinates ; the former is already
available, and the latter can always be found
when the right man looks for them.
Moreover, though the proposed arrange-
ment may be a small matter in the
ultimate unification of Australia, it would
be, at all events, the first practical
step towards an effective union, and the
first step, no matter how trifling it may be,
counts for something. At least 90 per cent.
—probably 99 per cent. —of Australians have
as yet no sentimental affection whatever for a
United Australia ; with them Federation is
a matter of interest and nothing else. If it
can be demonstrated that there is some-
thing substantial to be gained in the
immediate present the almost - forgotten
movement will start afresh, otherwise it will
continue dead until further notice. In the
present case, there is a chance of proving
that something is to be gained, and that
is the most powerful argument which can
be advanced for the cause of Australian
Nationalism.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Gag in Prisons.
That bloodless attorney, N.S.W. Minister for
Justice Gould, is being egged on by his subor-
dinates to allow them to thrust a humane gag
into the mouths of gaol prisoners, and the
S.M. Herald publishes a warm eulogy of gag-
ging on general principles in order to remove
any possible hesitation in the matter. The
new gag, it is explained, is not at all a brutal
contrivance. On the contrary, prisoners rather
like it in their mouths than otherwise ; and the
only tiling to be feared is that they will deliber-
ately make themselves objectionable in order to
be gagged. The Herald, however, rather
inconsistently persists in regarding even
bhe improved variety of gag as a punish-
ment ; and propounds the theory that
“ criminals are put in gaol to be punished, and
if they will not conform to the rules made
for their restraint they must be punished again
till they submit.” No penologist, no man
of science, no thinking individual, will nowa-
days assent to this barbarous dogma. Criminal!
are not put in gaol to be punished. They ara
put in gaol partly to prevent them from com-
mitting further crimes, and partly to deter
others from committing crimes. A criminal is
invariably the product of his environment: the
possible saint, born amid vicious surroundings,
almost inevitably becomes vicious : and criminal
responsibility is merely a social fiction. A man
commits crime, or refrains from committing
crime, simply because, being what he is, sub-
ject to all the influences—hereditary, educa-
tional, social—which have played upon him
before and since birth, he cannot possibly do
otherwise. Considering the individual exclu-
sively in relation to himself, and not in his
relation to society, there is no merit in virtue,
no demerit in vice. None but a free agent can
be a responsible agent; and there is no such
thing as a free agent. Breed children in the
gutter, and they will be tainted with the
gutter ; breed children in an atmosphere
morally and physically healthy, and the chances
are that they will also be healthy. Bub the
taint is not to be ascribed to the individual
as guilt, nor its absence as innocence. So far
as the individual is concerned, guilt and
innocence are only the effects of causes
which are completely out of his control.
Society simply praises or condemns, from its
own standpoint, the conduct which profits
or injures it, with a view to the future,
improvement of social conditions. As regards
past social conditions, which have resulted in
past crime, society, not the individual, must
take the responsibility. It has no warrant
whatever to punish the crime which itself
has created only to prevent the crime
which it may create. And, whether the
right to punish be conceded or no, the
use of the gag as a punishment is brutal and
infamous. It is useless to talk of an emascu-
lated gag, which the victims put on with plea-
sure and take off with regret. A gag, to be
effective, must be brutal. And brutality begets
brutality. The lash and the gag are direct
causes of the garrotter, the ravisher and the
murderer. Society reaps as it sows. Treat
your criminals in gaol as wild beasts, and when
you free them they will turn and rend you.
Treat them as men, and you give them the
best possible reason to become men. In argu-
ing for the gag, the Herald is the mouthpiece
of cruel, callous officialdom, careless of the
results of its actions, eager only to quiet its
victims with the least possible pains. Time
and again, even in post-convict days, has New
South Wales heard of the horrid cruelties in-
flicted by the gag in the hands of warders more
criminal than the prisoners whom they tortured
—with the difference that their crimes were
sanctioned by the law, excused by “ respec-
table ” people, and justified by the Herald
in leading articles. But nothing can
justify the gag. If it is used upon an in-
sane criminal, he should be in the hospital or
the asylum; if upon a sane one, the fault
lies with the prison authorities, not with the
prisoner. The cases in which men—not driven
to rebellion by barbarous regulations, or bar-
barous gaolers—conduct themselves so as, in
the estimation of those gaolers, to need the gag,
are few indeed. For those few—causelessly,
obstinately outrageous —the remedy is an hour
or two’s solitary reflection in a padded room.
But the ghastly face, the gaping jaws, the
bleeding mouth, the choking, swollen throat—
this is a spectacle which N.S. Wales, once
having escaped from, should never see again.
If the Minister for Justice listens to the repre-
sentations of his subordinates and permits it,
if the Cabinet as a body supports the Minister
for Justice, The Bulletin hopes that every
honest man in the province will mark the deed
with a black cross against the day of political
reckoning.

The Electors of the Vic. Legislative
Council.
Mr. J. B. Patterson, professed to discover
something “ most significant” in the utter coi -
demnation of the land-tax principle by his
friends in the Victorian Legislative Council.
When he considered that the Assembly repie-
sented 239,000 electors, and the Council repre-
sented 170,000, the difference being only 69,000,
Patterson had no further doubt that the
present time is “ inopportune ” for such a tax.
The Council’s conduct in dancing with both
feet on Turner’s Bill was, in Patterson’s idea,
complete evidence of the aforesaid “ inoppor-
tuneness,” inasmuch as more than two-thirds of
the voting power which elected the big land-tax
majority in the Assembly also elected the still
bigger anti-land-tax majority in the Council.
The situation is peculiar. On the surface of
things, it would seem that out of 239,000 adult
male voters in Victoria, a very large majority—
probably about 180,000—want a land-tax,
as evidenced by their votes at last Assembly
election. At the same time, it would
seem that the 170,000 out of these 239,000,
who have also a vote for the election of the
ancient stalactites of the Council, are almost to
a man against the land-tax, judging by the
fact that all their representatives in the Upper
House, save one, were against that measure, and
even that one was none too friendly. And in this
incredible piece of arithmetic Patterson sees
something “very significant.” Yet the ex-
planation is easy enough. Any male elector
may be sent by the people to represent them in
the Assembly; there is no property qualifica-
tion for members, and as they are paid a salary
anybody, rich or poor, is equally eligible.
Consequently, when the people wanted to send
a big majority of land-taxers into the Lower
House they could do it, and they promptly did
it. On the other hand, no man can be a mem-
ber of the Council unless he owns property of
an annual value of ,£IOO, which is equal to a
capital value of at least .£2ooo—therefore
only landholders are eligible. There is
no payment, therefore only rich land-
holders, w’ho don’t need to work for
their living, are eligible. The constituencies
are very large and election expenses are very


heavy—therefore, only very rich landlords can
qualify for a seat in the House of Fossildom.
And no rich landlord wants a land-tax, because
it is a special tax on himself, therefore the
170,000 electors are only authorised to send
anti-land-taxers to the Council—there is no
one else whom they can send. But the fact
that they are not in accord with their Fat Men
misrepresentatives is sufficiently evidenced by
the tact that the same electors sent a very
different crowd to the Assembly, where they
had a free hand. Under these circumstances,
the “significance” which Patterson discovered
is pure bosh. If the qualification for an M.L.C.
was that he must be a Freetrader instead of an
ami-land - taxer, and Victoria consequently
elected a purely Freetrade Council and a
strongly Protectionist Assembly, the fact would
be just as “significant.” Patterson’s assump-
tion that Victoria filled the Council with anti-
laud-tax property-holders because it wanted to
do so, and that its desire to do so is “ signifi-
cant,” is mere gall and misrepresentation. All
the significance there is about the Council
couldn’t be discovered with a kinetoscope.
“A Free Port.”
£. £. Smith and the Argus urge that Victoria
should follow Denmark in the alleged novel
enactment to establish a free port at the metro-
polis while maintaining the protective policy
elsewhere. As Hamburg and Bremen are part
of the German Empire, but remain outside the
Zollverein, it is strange that such ancient
examples of the “free port” should have
escaped high authorities like £. £. Smith and
the Argus. It is, however, significant of
Hamburg’s case that its jurisdiction was re-
stricted in ’B2 to the city and port—to the
exclusion of the Lower Elbe— i.e, the State of
Hamburg. From The Bulletin’s point of
view the proposal for a free port in Hobson’s
Bay is simply an immoral extension of that
most immoral of all the Argus unprinciples,
enunciated at the last election :
The lowest tariff that will bring in tbe highest revenue
The imposition of a tariff for revenue purposes
is the worst of all the bad legislation foisted on
Australia. For the No-tariff parly there is
some show of reason; but for the Revenue-tariff
party, the mule of parties, the barren com-
promise between incompatibles, there is no
argument except brute noise. The revenue-
tariff is a Tory dodge to protect land and
income from just taxation. The Vic. tax of 3d.
per lb. on tea, for instance, taxes practically
every meal of the mass of the community—
while the rich minority, if anything, escapes
more lightly. The only result of this source of
revenue, and others equally unjust, is to post-
pone the day of the land-tax. Duties that are
not protective should be abolished at once, no
hindrance whatever being offered to the goods
we want. The imports we don’t want should
be discouraged. As far as protected industries
are concerned, a free port within a few miles
w’ould become a den of thieves, ready, by any
trick or artifice, to rob the local manufacturer
of his position and prosperity.
Prohibition on the Clutha.
A Maoriland newspaper-man, who was sent
to inspect the prohibition district of Clutha
(M.L.), and report on the working of the great
Cold Tea movement, has published the results
of his investigation. He devoted a number of
days to the search, and visited every township
and hamlet in the prohibited district, and
found drink everywhere. Almost all the old
pubs, sell it; the only change is that instead
of being sold openly as before it is now handed
out secretly in response to winks and secret
signs of intelligence. In addition to the hotels,
a new class of low-grade shanties has sprung
up, the like of which never existed before. As
much liquor goes into the prohibited region as
went there in the post-prohibition period ; this
fact was ascertained from brewers and whole-
sale merchants in Dunedin, who supply the
district, and who are prepared to demon-
strate by their books that their business is as
robust as ever. The police have apparently
given up any serious effort to cope with
the difficulty. It is too vast and too
widespread, and the secret grog-shops rise
up many times faster than they can be sup-
pressed. The drink is already rather worse
than it used to be ; it is sold, as already men-
tioned, in low, shady dens which, in better
days, had no existence ; the licensing revenue—
a very large item—has been lost; and a new
branch of lying has arisen, for when a sus-
picious stranger comes along and asks for drink
every grog-dealer peijures his immoral soul in
a great swear that he knows of no alcohol any-
where in the whole Clutha electorate. Beyond
this, however, nothing has been effected. It is
the old story. Prohibition is about the meanest
and most drunken thing going. A State Drink
Monopoly would do more for the cause of tem-
perance in one year than all the Prohibition on
earth would accomplish in a century.
Tbe “See-Saw Morning Herald.”
The evolution of the S.M. Herald is a painful
but interesting spectacle. Claiming to be the
leading N.S.W. daily newspaper, it is really a
very unwilling follower of the army of Aus-
tralian journalism. Democracy has to drag it
along as a mother drags her reluctant urchin to
the tub. It kicks and squeals, tugging back-
ward with all its might, and doing its best to
show how it resents purification. Away back
in the century, the Herald started business
with a very fine assortment of Fat principles
and platitudes.. It has been gradually shed-
ding them as the years rolled on—just as the
physically fat man sheds his tissue in the
Turkish bath ; but it still retains enough to be
foolish and unpleasant with. And the Herald
is invariably foolish and unpleasant just after
it has been sensible and pleasant. Its Fatness
appears in repentant spasms when it has con-
ceded more than usual to its Democratic
environment, and allowed itself to be dragge 1
forward a whole step —in the same way
as a gouty person gets his twinges after an
unusually good dinner. Within the last day
or two, for example, the Herald has printed
articles pointing out that ascetic religion is bad
morality, and that a comparison of attendance
at Sydney churches and places of amusement
shows that the latter are far more numerously
patronised ; also, a scandalous paragraph im-
plying that angels elope and have twins. It is
very sorry for all these tilings—particularly for
the scandalous paragraph ; and it endeavours to
make up by printing a venomously Fat article
defending the employment of colored labor on
mailboats to which the white taxpayers of Aus-
tralia give hundreds of thousands of pounds in
subsidy. Now, in its thinner moments, the
Herald knows very well that this defence is in-
defensible. It is a standing disgrace to the pro-
vinces of Australia that a great steamship com-
pany should be paid by the white population of
Australia to employ cheap colored labor at an
enormous profit rather than better-paid white
labor at a moderate profit. The P. and O. Co.
will always find patrons among the shoddy
aristocracy to whom black faces convey a
pleasant suggestion of slavery ; but it is in-
tolerable that white Australia should be taxed
to support aliens who cannot mix with us upon
an equal plane of civilisation, while her own
race goes workless and starving. The Herald
suggests that the P. and O. company might
discontinue its service if compelled to discharge
the cheap and reliable Lascar. Australia’s
troubles ! We have always the Orient Com-
pany (which employs white labor exclusively,
and deserves the patronage of every consistent
Democrat) to take up the running. But there
is not the slightest risk that the P. and O. Co.
will do anything so foolish. If Postmaster-
General Cook and his confreres say decisively
that no subsidy will be given to a coloured-
labor steamer, the company will simply, what-
ever its bluff, discharge its Lascars and replace
them with white men. So the sooner they say,
the better. In the meantime, the Herald will
kindly continue to see saw.
Melbourne and Federation.
The Federation meeting in Melbourne Town
Hall, on 23rd Jan., decided for itself these
three fundamentals for Federation :
Protection against the world.
Interprovincial Freetrade.
One-man-one-vote.
The Tory element present held its peace while
these three principles were declared time and
again with riotous cheers. The reception given
to the Premiers of the neighbor-provinces was
most cordial, but it was overshadowed when
Premier George Turner appeared. This was
the first indication of the Democratic tendency
of the meeting. Pressure of business in Par-
liament presently necessitated Turner’s recall
to the lead of the House—but an interjeccor
affected to believe it was fear of the Trades
Hall! Patterson, in his motion of thanks,
referred to Turner’s position, and in reply to a
derisive laugh, said : “ Make no mistake, Mr.
Turner’s heart is in the work.” Such a declara-
tion from the leader of the Opposition anent the
Premier could net be gainsaid, and was en-
dorsed by cheers, but a dramatic illustration of
the pressure of Vie. Parliamentary business
was given by the appearance of a messenger in
the uniform of Parliament, who hurried on to
the platform at the instant, and stopped Pat-
terson himself, giving him a verbal message of
recall. Patterson went on the instant. It
was then observed that Isaacs and Zox,
M.L.A.’s, had also disappeared from the plat-
form. It was a great moment when Chairman
Madden introduced the N.S.W. Premier. Pre-
mier Reid, thanks to Hop, was familiar in face
and figure to 99 per cent, of his audience. But
the voice was a surprise. The childish treble
came almost as an anti-climax to the great
reception given its owner when he came for-
ward. But the surprise was only momentary,
and speaker and audience came to the best
terms with one another. The result was an
actual oration of the old school, peroration and
all complete—
Let us then unite, as I believe vve will, to secure as a
glorious heritage for our children, these grand destinies,
fortified bv a perpetual league and covenant of Australian
patriotism.
The enthusiasm raised by Premier Reid’s
really fine effort prepared the way for an
ovation for Premier Kingston (S.A.). Three
cheers were given for South Australia, and then,
perhaps, it dawned on people how very big
and ungainly C. C. Kingston really was. The
strident voice and jerky utterance struck the
ear as unsympathetically as did the above-
mentioned childish treble. The intensely small
Tory minority felt smaller still when Premier
Kingston announced his resolve to have one-
man-one-vote in the Federal constitution, and
the cry was taken up from every part of the
hall with the unmistakable emphasis of
repeated cheers. Mayor Tucker, of Adelaide,
had been eulogised by his Premier, but proved
the failure of the evening. Stage-fright had
him for its own, and pathetic platitudes were
produced at weary length. In a lucid interval,
however, he declared for internal Freetrade
and Protection against the world, and then the
Town Hall was filled for a minute with cheers.
Trade-Commissioner Larke, from Canada,
proved to be an agreeable and good-humored
old gentleman, and took some delight in the
statement (with Uncle Sam accent) that, while
he could say proudly that he was a Canadian—
not one of his audience could say: “I am an
Australian.” But it was left to Deakin to de-
liver the absolute oration of the evening. His
text was that greater power and greater issues
never lay in the hands of man than were en-
trusted now to two men— Reid and Kingston.
His limpid, hypnotic eloquence lashed the
crowd into enthusiasm. /
Prison Discipline.
For some years past a printing-plant has been
maintained in the gaol at Dunedin (M.L.), and
the better-conducted prisoners have been taught
the trade of type-setting. The experiment was
a very small one, and it was of such short dura-
tion that it produced no definite results. It
was finally discontinued a few weeks ago,
partly because of the remonstrances of the pro-
fessional type-setters, who complained of the
injury done to their trade through the competi-
tion of released felons, and partly owing to
other causes ; and the prisoners will presum-
ably go back to their profitless occupation of
napping stones as heretofore. The attempts
made in other gaols to teach shoe-making, mat-
making, book-binding, and other trades have
mostly fallen through in similar fashion. The
arguments against the system are that it gives
the felon an undue advantage over the honest
man, who was never afforded an opportunity of
learning a trade in his early years ; and that
prison-labor being subsidised out of the public
revenue, and not burdened by any charge
for wages, its products can be sold at a low
rate, whereby the wages of workmen outside
the gaols are seriously diminished. The argu-
ments in favor of it are that it helps to make
the prisons self-supporting, and that in the case
of the first offender who possessed no honest
means of livelihood previous to his conviction,,
the acquisition of a trade renders him, in some
small degree at least, less likely to become a
confirmed criminal and a permanent burden on
the community. The case is one which admits
of no logical compromise. Either the gaols
should be a vast series of workshops, and every
effort should be made to render them not only
self-supporting but a source of absolute profit
to the State—or else the confinees should be
kept absolutely unemployed so far as any useful
or productive labor is concerned. And if the
average prisoner is taught no trade and em-
ployed at no useful occupation, the chances are
so much in favour of him becoming a reliable
and old-established offender that he might
as well be hanged at once. At all events, there
is something wildly irrelevant about existing
Australian gaol management, which produces
nothing but criminals and goes on no defi-
nite policy whatever. There are only two logical
prison systems at present in force, so far as The
Bulletin is aware, and the Australian system
halts feebly about half-way between them. One
of these is represented by a famous reformatory
in the State of New York, where every prisoner
is educated, taught a trade, and turned out, as
far as possible, a civilised being. The other is
seen at its best in certain Belgian prisons,
where every offender is kept in perpetual soli-
tary confinement. The almost invariable result
is hopeless idiocy, which incapacitates the
prisoners from further active law-breaking, and
causes a great diminution in the criminal
statistics. Both systems are remarkably suc-
cessful in their different ways ; they aim at
something definite, and get there to a consider-
able extent. The Australian prison-systems, on
the other hand, aim at nothing definite, and
don’t get there.
♦
The Vic. Assembly has decided to cut down
the salary of future Agents-General from £2150
to £ISOO. This is a good idea on the surface,
but when viewed more carefully it isn’t so
good as it appears, by a long way. Presumably
the province wants an Agent-General—there
isn’t very much for him to do when such an in-
curably lazy man as Gillies can fill the billet,
but still there is a little, and that little wants
to be done well. If the country proposes to
pay according to the value of the ordinary
routine work, £SOO a year would be quite
enough ; if it proposes to get a man with
brains enough to meet the emergency which
crops up once in a few years or so, he probably
couldn’t be got under £2OOO. The most pro-
mising way is to keep up the Agent-General’s
salary and find more work for that gilded
minion to do so that he may earn his oats.
Just now Victoria pays an English bank
£12,500 a year for the toilsome job of doing
certain clerical work in connection with the
public debt. If an Agent-General at £2OOO a
year were to hire £SOO worth of extra clerical
assistance, and also make the clerical assistance
he has work a little harder, he could probably
get through this work very comfortably, and
thus save £12,000 per annum to his bleeding
country. The crude process of retrenchment
by cutting down salaries isn’t always so good
as it looks. If there is anything to be done,
it is often much cheaper to hire a brainy man
at a good salary and make good use of his
brains, than to have two cheap men falling
over each other to no purpose. For that matter
one clever man at, say, £2500 a year could be
Agent-General for all Australia and Tasmania,
and manage the debts of all six provinces as
well. The Agent-General’s department is one
where Federation might commence with much
advantage and with comparatively little diffi-
culty.
English papers that howl for the enforcement
of holiness in State schools are liberally para-
graphing a Mr. Henry White, author of
“ Tales of Crime and Criminals in Australia,”
who “has spent thirty years in the penal
department of Victoria.” Speaking of that
province, Mr. White says :
“ Education lias abolished the bushranger [lt hasn’t
- it is chiefly the railway and the telegraph that have
abolished him.—Ed. B.l —“but for one bushranger or
horse stealer, we have twenty offenders convicted of
forgery and embezzlement; for one veteran convict im-
ported from other lands we have fifty native larrikins.
Crimes of violence to women and children, mostly com-
mitted by young men, are terribly on the increase, and,
in addition, we have a whole army of strolling pilferers,
prostitutes, and drunkards.
As a cure for all this, Mr. White, who is pro-
bably getting old and dodderingly pious, sug-
gests practical Bible-teaching at the State
schools every day in the week. The author of
“ Tales of Crime in Australia ” is distinctly off
in several important particulars. The native
“ larrikin ” is not necessarily a criminal any
more than is the playful young English earl;
crimes of violence against women and children
are not increasing proportionately with the
increase of population ; and this class of crime
is usually perpetrated by elderly men. Crime
is proportionately much the smallest amongst
the native-born population, and in any case the
crime-record in Victoria compares more than
favorably with that of any country where the
Gospel is force-pumped into the children by the
State. In fact, local professional pietists can-
not disguise their mortification because young
Victorians are not conspicuously vicious—they
would be so valuable as a shocking example.
Melbourne Age believes in the land and in-
come-tax, but it believes in it with considerable
difficulty. The following is an example of its
feelings on the subject:
Very much of what Mr. Wynne said in the way of argu-
ment against a tax on land may be at once admitted. . .
For example, no one can deny that the tax which falls on
landowners and mortgagees is a tax on thrift. . . All
accumulated property is the result of thrift somewhere,
and all taxation, of whatsoever shape, must fall, in tha
last resource, on property.
In a certain far-off sense this is correct. For
instance, when a bank-director grants himself a
big overdraft and never repays it, that acquisi-
tion is the result of thrift on the part of the
ruined depositors. And when—as happened in
a good many instances—some old-time digger
bought a cheap allotment in ancient Melbourne,
and then was surprised years afterwards to find
that the forgotten property had made him rich,
that was also an evidence of thrift—on the part
of the people who built a big city during tha
land-holder’s absence. Most accumulations
are an evidence of thrift, either on the part of
the men who have them or on the part of the
men from whom the present owners stole them.
Other accumulations show that the owner
thriftlessly gambled in a sweep and won the
big prize, or that he was a bookmaker, or struck
a rich reef, or something. Si ill, in the main,
the Age is right, so far as it goes. A big for-
tune is, in most cases, an evidence that the
money was dishonestly acquired in the first
place, and then the owner’s thrift—or that of
his father, or his uncle, or somebody else-
enabled him to keep it when it was acquired.
And the want of a big fortune generally shows
that the man who doesn’t own it lacked either
the thrift, or the dishonesty, or both. There-
fore, a tax on big capitalists may be fairly set
down as a tax on thrift, good luck, brains, dis-
honesty, meanness, and various other qualities.
The Age, however, which is democratic with
difficulty, mentions the thrift only, and entirely
omits the other aspects of the case. No one
ever made a big fortune by thrift alone.

There was neither sitting nor standing-
room, nor any other form of space whatever, when
the Brough-Bouoicault Co. made its re-appearanoe
at Sydney Lyceum. The regular Hebraic Satur-
day-night audience was there in full force and in
the height of fashion ; there were at least two
acres of undressed back and shoulders in the d.c.,
and the male part of the crowd represented all the
pawnable assets of Sydney. When the curtain
went up, and Brough and Titheradge appeared as
two feeble old persons tottering down a flight of
steps, the applause lasted three consecutive
minutes, and Mrs. Brough got an equally enthu-
siastieweception. The new production, “Sowing
the Wind,” is a drama of that bygone era when
men wore sea-green pants that were braced up at
one end and strapped down at the other till they
threatened to fly asunder at the knees. It is ba?ed
chiefly on the foolishness of Brough, as a sour,
black-coated, black-hatted person who muddles
his friend’s business with the best possible
intentions and the worst possible results. Years
before the story opened, when Titheradge was
young and foolish, he formed “ a relationship ”
with a financially undesirable young person, but
his sour friend made inquiries of a certain wicked
lord who assured him that the young person was a
wholly worthless character. Brough accepted the
wicked lord’s statements without question, and
Titheradge accepted Brough’s assurances right
off, and the lady was abandoned, and went to the
bad with the wicked lord, and then died and was
forgotten. Some 25 years afterwards Titheradge’s
adopted son falls in love with her (and Tither-
adge’s) daughter, and the same sour friend goes
out to make inquiries of the same wicked lord,
and the wicked lord, who wants the daughter to
go to the bad with him as her mother did years
before, cheerfully assures Brough that she is also
a thoroughly worthless character. Then the old
man, who has gained no wisdom in the past
quarter-century, goes away contentedly on two
spidery legs and makes a whole lot of unforeseen
complications.
• • •
The drama moves a little slowly now and
then, but the magnificent scene in act 111., where
Mrs. Brough casts off her unrecognised father and
his fellow-dodderer, and declares war against the
whole world of snuffle and unoharitableness, more
than compensates. Her acting in this scene is a
whirlwind of sustained passion, and the two
venerable pedants go down like straw before it,
until one of them has to carry the other off in a
state of insensibility. Titheradge’s lost daughter
is an exceedingly fine piece of work all
through, and well worthy of the actress’s
high reputation. Cecil Ward fills his char-
acter as the adopted son respectably. Mr.
Carey makes an excellent figure as the wicked lord
—an old, hairless miscreant of the deepest dye, and
the other characters are satisfactory, especially a
certain cackling maiden, in which part the clever
Miss Grace Noble strikes out an entirely new
line. One of the firm’s recent importations, Mr.
Dorrington, makes his first appearance as a rat-
hunting baronet, and promises well, if his blank-
ness of countenance is high art and not nature.
“Sowing the Wind” is a good play allround,
with several strong morals in it, the most con-
spicuous of which is that a moral old ass is the
worst kind of ass going. Everybody feels this,
and when the wicked lord rises up, in Act IY.,
and addresses Brough on the subject in a few
well-ohosen remarks, the audience expresses its
cordial approval.

George Rignold’s pantomime, at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney), has been revised and altered
and re-decorated, and the new edition is going
strong on the home stretch and still full of running.
Almost everything is new except the fire-ballet,
which is still the prettiest effect of the show.

The alleged Comedy Co., which burst last
week at the School of Arts, hasn’t been heard
from since, and the Criterion remains shut. The
habit of being shut is growing upon this theatre,
and considering that it is one of the prettiest
houses in Sydney its ill-luck is unaccountable.

The last nights of Bland Holt’s “ Span of
Life” are announced, but its successor is not yet
definitely elected. The “ Span ” has done the
best and longest run achieved by any melodrama
in Sydney for years past, and business even now
is almost, if not quite, as good as it was the first
week.

“ Charley’s Aunt” is still doing the Sydney
suburbs, with great success. It has lately been
heard of in the wilds of Burwood and Granville.
To-night (Thursday) it appears at Liverpool,
where the population consists mostly of super-
annuated citizens in the various asylums. It
Joes Campbelltown on Friday, Camden on Satnr-
iay, and North Shore (Sydney) on Monday.

Woodloch’s circus will be further adorned
lext Monday with a water pantomime, 50,000
fallens of refreshing deluge being poured into th e
ring for the purpose. This will bo good enough if
the weather has quite cleared up by that time; if it
hasn’t Woodloch had better postpone the new
effect. Sydney has had enough unavoidable water
pantomime of late.

Frank M‘Kiernan, known to very many
Melbourne people as the cheerful purser of the
excursion steamer Ozone, is compelled by the
affliction of failing eyesight to quit his breezy
billet. The management has arranged to give a
farewell benefit to this respected servant of the
pleasure-seeking public. It will take the form of
a moonlight trip per Ozone on Feb. 14, when
anyone desirous of doing Mao a good turn may
purchase tickets for his little nocturnal outing
instead of sending him a valentine. For all par-
ticulars apply to the advt.

One hot night last week a well-mixed and
particularly well-managed show was given at
Melb. Opera House, by way of a send-off for Mrs.
Edouin Bryer, who sails for London in the Oro-
tava. It was a benefit; a good old-fashioned
ben.—not a “grand testimonial,” and a comfort-
able cheque came out of it.
* « •
Mrs. Edouin Bryer, whose portrait is
given elsewhere—she was not professionally known
as Bryer during her husband’s lifetime—is asso-
ciated with the early history of the Melbourne
stage. As Miss Lizzie Naylor, a blushing damsel
of 16, she got her first whiff of the Yarra some 39
years ago, when she came from England under
consignment to her aunt, Mrs. Avins. Mrs.
Avins enjoyed the distinction of being the first
lady to appear at the first theatre or hall erected
in Melbourne (a.d. 1840), upon the site of the Bull
and Mouth Hotel, Bourke-street. Miss Naylor’s
relative introduced her to manager Coppin, at the
Theatre Royal, and there the new arrival made her
debut in a burlesque, “Once Upon a Time There
Lived Two Kings,” young Henry Harwood being a
nimble item of the production. In ’63, fair Lizzie
married one of the Edouin (Bryer) brothers, whose
sister meanwhile had become Mrs. G. B. W.
Lewis, and with the Lewis company she did a
long tour through the East. Back again in Mel-
bourne, she resumed work at the Royal, and,
later, joined Lyster’s musical company at the Opera
House. Those were working times in the purfesh,
when an actress would appear as Hamlet’s mother
(one of Mrs. B.’s best characters) at 7 o’clock, and
pop up in extravaganza three hours later. In
the original never-to-be-forgotten production of
“ Struck Oil,” the part of Mrs. Stofel fell to Mrs.
Bryer, and she filled it in all the Williamsoman
revivals of that lucrative entertainment. When the
firm took over the Royal, in ’BO or thereabouts, Mrs.
Bryer retained the position of “ first old woman,”
which she had made her own before she ceased to
be quite young off the stage. In the useful
capacity of a plump matron, sporting always a
cap and apron, Mrs. Bryer figured in most of the
successful dramas of the Firm’s halcyon period.
Also, she has impersonated skittish old women, at
times, in comic opera, and her final appearance
was to be made, on Tuesday of this week, in “ The
Judge,” a farcical comedy. Time is dealing
kindly with this respected player of many parts,
and when she comes back from foggy Britain, as
she doubtless will, there should be plenty more
professional engagements for “Ma” Bryer to
undertake.

At the Princess’s there was a good demand
for the last nights of “Beauty and the Beast,”
despite a high temperature and a profound odour
of paint in the vicinity. The entrances to the
auditorium were hung with flags of all nations,
and disguised in what the daily newspapers call a
“ gala dress,” but the painter and decorator could
be smelt from behind the bunting, and a dread of
colic pervaded the air. This week the work of
making Australia’s most beautiful theatre more
beautiful than ever will be carried on with closed
doors. On Saturday (2nd Feb.) the panto, from
Sydney Lyceum is to appear at the Princess’s in a
somewhat altered form. Shapely Marie Luella
joins the new company, and the show promises to
intoxicate the senses and “ excite the risibilities of
the audience.”

“Aladdin” romps along at the Royal.
Last nights have commenced, but the actual date

“The Foundling,” after a severe tussle
with the weather, began to flourish at Melbourne
Bijou. It has to withdraw, in favor of a noble
earl, on Wednesday night, however, and will pro-
bably be superseded by “ A Mint of Money,” on
Saturday. The last-named farce, which is new to
Australia, and includes a bevy of 12 female char-
acters, will run for two weeks. By that time the
Dacres will be ready to open their campaign.
* * * *
Yarmouth Revels, in aid of distressed
actors and the Children’s Hospital, are to take
place at the Bijou to-night (Thursday) and to-
morrow. The demand for seats at advanced prices
is a complete vindication of manager’s Stuart’s
conduct in this matter, and nothing that the Earl
of Yarmouth may perpetrate can alter the fact
that charity is covering a tony advertisement for
the theatre. Meanwhile, Melbourne’s amaze-
ment at what his lordship has volunteered to do is
almost as great as the general desire to see him do
it. Reason totters under the contemplation of
Yarmouth’s programme. He will inaugurate the
proceedings by appearing in “ Our Bitterest Foe,”
and then pass on rapidly to one of the name-
parts in “ A Pair of Lunatics.” His appetite
for acting being whetted, Lord Yarmouth wjlj
next undertake a funny character, including
extras, in W. S. Gilbert’s “ Creatures of Im-
pulse.’’ The extras, or interpolations, are as
follows : —Song, “Tommy Atkins,” by His Lord-
ship; duet, “Doddle Doddle,” by Lord Yar-
mouth and Miss Hardy ; special Yarmouth dance,
His Own invention, and entitled “ The Moth and
the Candle,” by the Noble Earl and Miss Florrie
Green ; also a whistling solo by the Youthful
Peer, accompanied by the orchestra. Upon the
completion of the aforesaid arduous tasks, the
Hereditary Legislator will entwine himself with
48 yards of silk, specially imported from Paris,
and perform a serpentine dance. This item is
reserved for a grand climax, because it is
very exhausting, and Lord Yarmouth usually
faints freely between the encores. But
should his strength permit, the high-spirited
nobleman—for, hang it 1 doncherknow, The
Bulletin must give him credit for pluck—
may be induced to throw in a neat little speech.
Lord Yarmouth is an intelligent, active person-
age behind the scenes, where he desires to be
known as “Peter,” and for the sake of his Gracious
Queen, not to mention the existing Constitution,
The Bulletin hopes for the best.

The Victoria Hall duly opened in opposi-
tion to the Oxford last Saturday. Also, Harry
Rickards has leased the Opera House, and will
put a strong variety-show in possession on Feb-
ruary 9th.
** * *
One of the most promising of young Aus-
tralian actors is Harry Roberts, whose portrait
appears in this issue of The Bulletin. He has
the faculty of versatility fully developed—an
essential element on the Australian stage, and in
proof thereof he has already run the whole gamut
of characters, from Shakespeare to pantomime.
Although worse in some than in others he has
never yet been credited with a thoroughly bad
performance. Mr. Roberts, who has lived 27
years, inherits the stage instinct his father,
R. R. Roberts, haying made a speciality of
Jefferson’s parts, whilst his mother, Miss Polly
Leake, is remembered by old playgoers as a highly
capable actress. Young Roberts made his first
bow at the green age of four, when he appeared at
Calcutta in company with General Tom Thumb.
His next appearance was at the age of 18, when
he played Horatio to G. R. Ireland’s Hamlet,
on a tour through Tasmania. Proceeding steadily
in the profession, Roberts was first hailed
as a capable player when he represented Beli-
sarius in Plain Bill Holloway’s production of
“ Cymbeline,” at Melb. Princess’. He was for
two or three years a useful member of Bland
Holt’s company, and has also assisted in many of
George Rignold’s productions. His opportunity
came when Maggie Moore was in search of a
leading man, capable of taking a hand in melo-
drama, burlesque, comedy, opera, pantomime, and
tragedy, as occasion required. Roberts confidently
undertook this varied order, and for two years has
fulfilled it to Miss Moore’s abundant satisfaction.
In addition, he has more than once efficiently
stage-managed Maggie’s productions, and Lizzie
Stofel is not likely to leave him behind when she
finally quits Australia for Yankeeland—if such a
disaster ever happens. Roberts’ Widow Twankey,
in Melb. Theatre Royal pantomime this year, is as
good a conception of this rusty character as many
that have come from the other side of the water,
but it is a pity to see so intelligent an actor spend-
ing his intellectual substance in such riotous
absurdity.
At Poverty Point .
At “ Bill’’ Hind’s funeral there attended as one of the
mourners “ Old Joe ” Rayner, of the Rayner’s Minstrels
of the fifties and subsequently leading man in support of
Marie Prdvost, who toured Australia in the sixties.
Marie Luella, the beautiful Beast in Melb. Princess’s
panto., despite her Franco-Italian stage-name, is Irish
from the top of her wig to the painted heel of her satin
slippers. Her accent gives her away; “Oi love huurr’’
is pure Dublin. Marie adopts May YohC’s trick of turning
up the end of one leg of her striped pants over the knee
when she sings her “Plantation Song.” It is a simple
dodge, but the variation of length of limb revealed is
peculiarly and insinuatingly “ fetching."
The Roselle-Dacre company will be rich in nice girls,
seemingly. The Daores bring two with them, and both
Harrie Ireland and Katherine Hardy are to join the com-
pany, it is said.
Jhe Dacres’ repertoire includes one or two light pieces,
in which Elton will predominate. In some of the serious
productions the little comedian’s name will be of more
real importance than the character he fills. Elton, as a
legitimate character actor, instead of a privileged joker,
should prove a refreshing novelty, nevertheless.
George Rignold recognised the Chinese New Year by
hanging on his outward walls a pink placard wishing the
Sydney Chows “all the compliments,” etc., in the quaint
ideograms of Mongolia. The end justified the means, as
many Chinamen patronised “Jor Gee’s” pantomime.
It was Amy Roselle (Mrs. Arthur Dacre) who created
the part of the prim and proper Mrs. Cortelyon in “ The
Second Mrs. Tanqueray ” at London St. James’.
Wilfred Shine, who joins the Dacres in their Melb.
season, will be no stranger to them. In August, ’9l,
when playing Shaun-lhe-Post in “ Arrah-na-Pogue ” at
London Princess’, Arthur Dacre was the romantic
Beamish M'Coul, and Amy Roselle his mistrustful sweet-
heart, Fanny Power.
Mrs. Edouin Bryer relates that once when she acted
Ophelia at Bendigo the supply of ladies was short to help
carry on the dummy of Ophelia in the last act, and so
Mrs. Bryer had to officiate as one herself.
Mrs. Onehunga Yates’ promised lecturing tour seems to
hang fire, though an English paper says that Smythe in
person has arranged to exhibit the lady.
Undoubtedly the way to make a pantomime profitable
is that adopted by George Rignold at Sydney Majesty’s,
where a stiff sum was put into brilliant mechanical effects
and striking scenery, while salaries are kept as moderate
as possible. The first cost of scenery and mechanism is
the whole coat, and when that is repaid their share of the
takings is clear profit; but big-salaried “stars” eat up
the popular shillings almost as fast as they attract them
—and faster when the audience begins to tire. No panto,
can have a long run with heavy initial outlay and heavy
current expenses; and discreet managers choose rather
to cut current expenses.
The tuneful and shapely Mrs. Vanderveer Green has
been appearing at the St. James’s Hall concerts (London)
with Miss Ella Russell, Mr. Sims Reetes, Mr. Ben Davies,
Signor Foli, MM. Woolf and Slivinski, and the Meister
Glee Singers. Mrs. Green .sang “The Worker” and a
“Spanish Bolero,” and won a double recall on each occa-
sion.
The “ Continentals ” held on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings, on Adelaide Jubilee Exhibition grounds, have
grown very popular. There is no restraint on the patrons,
who can drink, smoke, promenade, chat, or flirt as they
like.
London Daily Telegraph's Paris correspondent writes,
on 20th Sept.: Madame (Frances) Saville has made her
diShut, at the Op6ra Comique, under the most favorable
circumstances, in a work which had already pleased a
Parisian public, but which was new to a large proportion
of those present. It is 18 years since “ Paul et Virginie ”
performed the miracle of saving from disaster one of the
numerous ThCAtre Lyrique enterprises, but it has never
since been revived. The libretto was cleverly adapted
from Bernardin de Saint Pierre’s novel by MM. Barbier
and Carr 6, and the music was written by M. Victor Masss,
who is best known in England by hi* one-act trifle, “Les
Noaes de Jeannette ” and his “ Reine Topaze." He was
an accomplished musician, and personally he was much
esteemed; but, though his melodies are elegant and his
concerted pieces well-written, he never rises to a very
high level. Evan the success of “ Paul et Virginie ” was
iu great measure to be attributed to the excellence
of the original interpretation, and if this prove to be suffi-
cient it is safe to pregnosticate an equal success for the
present revival. In, the first place, Madame Saville looks
the part to perfection, and this is no small recoinmei da-
tion, but this is not ail. Fortunately, h;r voice is as
fresh and pure as her appearance. She prepo-sessed her
hearers in her favour by her share in the love duet sumr
by Virginia and Paul when they run on the stage, shel-
tered from the rays of the tropical sun by the huge
banana-leaf which they use as a parasol ; and in her
plaintive rendering of the air “ Pardonnez Lui,” warbled
by her as she intercedes for the slave M6ala, Madame
Saville showed how artistically she can sing a sustained
melody. In the more brilliant portions of the r6le,
notably in the aria supposed to be sung by
Virginie in Paris and heard by Paul in the lie Bour-
bon, the lady was equally successful. The idea of this
duet, hy the way, sung by two people in different parts of
the world, is probably the boldest that ever entered a
librettist’s brain. However, it is quite effective, and
here, as in all the rest of his role, M. Clement is as ideal a
Paul in appearance as Madame Saville is a Virginie worthy
to be his partner. In spite of the extreme length of the
performance, the audience was enthusiastic through' ut.
It ought to be added that Madame Saville’s diction is as
good as her singing, and those who did not know her his-
tory were surprised to learn that she was not French-
Seeing how hypercritical our friends here are, this is no
Blight compliment.
Little Ethel, the clever infant trapezist of Woodloch’s
Circus, while doing a trapeze act at Sydney on Salur-
day afternoon last, wound her silk sash so lightly
round the bar that she was left hanging head-down and
almost suffocated. It was some moments before her pre-
dicament was noticed, and she was getting black in the
face when her father shinned up the hoisting rope, and
after desperately tearing at the sash for several minutes,
while he hung by his legs on the trapeze and worked
head-down, he had to get a ktdfe sent up, and with
great difficulty managed to cut the tough silk away in
bits. It was quite ten minutes before the child was
released from her trying fix, and her father cut his hand
badly in the process. Then the plucky youngster went on
with her performance amid great applause.
Jack Cameron, late managing-partner of Abell and
Klaer’s circus, Paddy Montgomery, formeily of that
defunct aggregation, and Frank Clark, of variety fame,
are running a neat little circus in Tasmania. They did
well at Hobart, and were, at latest, showing in Launces-
ton to good biz. Clark is financing the show' while
Cameron is ahead. Old man Abell and the Hindoo-rider,
Lahl Sing, are among the combination.
A. L. Cunard has opened Melb. Victoria Hall with a

Rev. H. R. Haweis, author, musical critic, very broad
churchman, and delegate to the Parliament of Religions
at Chicago, who is at present conducting some popular

tralia. If he comes his advertisements will be signed
“ R. S. Sraythe.”
The story told in a recent Bulletin of the chloroformed
goat in “Pygmalion ” which insisted on recovering at the
wrong moment, suggests another episode in connection
with the same comedy. Many years ago, in Maoriland,
Charles Burford was Pygmalion, and Clara Stephenson,
wdth a bad cold, played Galatea. All went well until
Cynisca drew back the curtains and bade the scn’ptor
gaze upon his famous statue, when that masterpiece was
found sneezing furiously in its recess. There was a
horrible pause. The audience laughed frantically. The
statue doubled itself up in an agony of “ A-chew," and
straightened itself again, and then sneezed convulsively
some more, and felt for its handkerchief, and then the
curtain came down suddenly, and Burford was heard
remonstrating with the masterpiece, and the masterpiece
was heard saying “ A-chew ” till further notice.
Rickards has leased Melb. Opera House for twelve
months, with the option of five years’ renewal. The
Sakers will be the bright particular stars. They do say
that J.C.W. is smiling on the enterprise.
Alice Saker has the rare misfortune of looking better
off the stage than on.
At-St. Patrick’s Cathedral Bazaar (Melb.) the rights of

action of this sort is enough for any church.

The new Sydney Trades Hall, at the
corner of Dixon and Goulburn streets, was
formally opened by Minister for Labor Garrard
on Jan. 26. The foundation-stone was laid by
Gov. Carington in Jan,, ’BB, but various difficul-
ties have delayed the werk. The Govt, gave
.£6OOO to secure a site, and the building has cost
about =29000 additional. The large hall seats,2ooo
people, and there are many additional lodge-
rooms. The trades societies are to be congratu-
lated on the possession of such a handsome and
commodious edifice.
Sydney papers of Jan. 29 print a short
wired account of the capture by the police of an
alleged offender named Rhody Sheedey, which
has a thrill of derring-do about it. Sheedey was
in the yard of an hotel at Forbes, a far-back
N.S.W. township, when two troopers rode up.
One dismounted, and came at Sheedey pistol in
hand ; the other stayed at the gate, which was
closed, and held his mate’s horse across it. The
trooper walked confidently up, thinking Sheedey
an easy prey, as the yard was surrounded by a
high fence, and the sft. spiked gate was the
lowest part of it. As soon as Sheedey saw the
constable, he jumped on his horse, drove the
spurs in, and flew gate and horse like a bird.
The constables rode after him, and, after a four-
miles’ race, one of them got within 40 yards of
Sheedey and called on him to stop. Sheedey
laughed and kept on ; and the trooper, fearing he
would jump another high fence close by, an<j get
clear, fired his revolver and wounded Sheedey,
whom he afterwards caught and arrested. This
is the police yarn, adding that the constable
“aimed at Sheedey’s shoulder,” which is pretty
tall—after a four miles’ race, with the mark 40
yards away. Anyhow, Rhody Sheedey’s pluck
deserves to have been shown in a better cause.
His luck seems to have been bad ever since he
could toddle. At school (where, by the way, he
sat on the same form as a noted N.S.W. literary
horseman) he was the typical bad boy, always
getting into trouble for squashing the master’s
nose with a tomato, or something of the sort. The
public, however, will flatly refuse to believe that
so game and clever a horseman hasn’t a lot of good
points concealed about him.

There is nothing very remarkable about the
balance-sheet of the Assets Realization Go. (Sydney), save
the strange anomaly, of a co. existing for the express pur-
pose of buying up other people’s assets, and being
unable to realise its own. The phenomenal amount of
£43,301 has been considered a necessary allowance for bad
debts and depreciation. The unpaid calls are also
seriously large, forming, as they do, nearly an
eighth of the co.’s actual capital. Total receipts from
realisation of assets, £24,000; from calls, £l7,soo—thus
liabilities have been reduced by £34,154. The year’s new
business has yielded a profit of £1325 95., whilst expenses
of management are set down at £1365 9s. 10d., so that the
00. has been almost self-sustaining. The history of the
concern, however, will be some melancholy satisfaction to
those people who have lost money in financial institu-
tions, etc., as nearly all its shareholders are sharp men of
banking and building society experience, who, when they
formed the co., thought they had a particularly good
thing in being practically the only snappers-up of assets
on anything like a big scale.

Amidst liquidations, bankruptcies and other
barrenness, the Australian Gaslight Co., Sydney, flourishes.
Net profits for past half-year (including last year’s
balance), £57,572, of which £51,134 goes to pay a 9s. per
share div.—equal to 15 per cent, per annum on the shares
paid to £6. Small wonder the co. is anxious to secure the
monopoly of the lighting of Sydney by electricity, when
gas, which is dearer to manufacture, can be made to show
such returns. If Sydney Council had control of the gas-
supply, it is safe to assume the price to consumers would
be reduced by fully a fifth. The ratepayers would thus
be the beneficiaries instead of, as at present, M.L.O. Fat-
inen and absentee English investors.

The Queensland National Bank shows no speci-
ally interesting symptoms. It earned £11,374 in profits
for the half-year, against £9797 for the half-year before,
and £18,333 for the one preceding. Compared with a
year ago, therefore, the profits have decreased by £2OOO
while the capital has increased by £llO,OOO, so the change
is not distinctly an improvement. The total deposits
have also decreased considerably, and as the Government
account is getting steadily larger, the falling-off is evi-
dently in private business. The cash reserve has in-
creased by £200,000, which is the only definite sign of
renewed strength noticeable anywhere. The auditors’
certificate is drawn up in the usual beautifully-guarded
fashion, and states that “in our opinion ” the
balance-sheet truly exhibits “ the affairs of the
bank as shown by the books." Which certificate com-
mits the auditors to nothing, and explains nothing,
and especially avoids explaining the one thing which the
public most want to know. Everybody is fully aware that
the balance-sheet agrees w'ith the books ; what people are
mostly afraid of in banking matters nowadays is that the
hooks don’t by any means agree with the present value of
the securities. Meanwhile, public opinion of the Q.N.B.
is expressed by the usual quotation for its shares (£4 ss.
paid up): “Buyers, Is.” Considering that the dividend
of 3 per cent, per annum amounts to over 2s. 6d. per
share, this figure shows a painful lack of public confidence
~or something
« « « •
The City Bank of Sydney remains in just
about the sime situation it has occupied for a year
or so past. Such small changes as there are in its figures
are, on the whole, not much for the better. During the
last year £41,000 more capital has been ealled up, but the
half-year’s profits (£10,004) are £1464 less than those of
last half, and £730 less than those of the one before. The
div. has gone down from six per cent, to five. The City
follows its usual policy in paying away all its profits in
divs. For the half-year ending Dec., ’93, it saved £317
with which to “ strengthen its position." Next half-year
it paid away £145 more than it earned. This time, after
paying its reduced dividend, it has a joyous £4 9*. 2d.
left to carry to profit and loss. Comparing its figures now
with those of a year ago, the reserve has decreased by
£119,000; the deposits have decreased by £35,000; the
note circulation has decreased by £90,000 (this is mainly
owing, however, to the expiration of the Bank Issue Act);
the item, “Bills discounted and other debts due to the
bank,” has diminished by £221,000 ; the profits and the
div. have both decreased, as already mentioned; and
though £41,000 of new capital has been called up, the
cash on hand has only increased by £12,000.
These are the principal depressing features
about the City Bank of Sydney. As a contra, the cash on
hand is over 25 per cent, of the total liabilities to the
public, whereas a year ago it was only 21J per cent. In
other respects there is a solemn fading away, but in this
one direction the institution is distinctly stronger than it
was at the beginning of ’94.
• • v «
Another downward-looking document is the
balance-sheet of the A.J.S. Bank. The half-year’s profits
at Dec. ’93, were £51,000 ; for half-year ending June, ’94,
they were £32,000 ; for last half-year they were under
£22,000. The 5 per cent. div. has dropped to 4 per cent.,
and even that leaves only £4OO to be carried forward. In
the first 18 months of the new bank’s existence it accumu-
lated a reserve of £45,000, and on the present occasion it
adds £1590 to it as a matter of form, said amount being
mostly taken from profit and loss. Considering that the
paid-up capital has increased from £700,000 to £1,100,000,
this steady falling-away in the earnings is remarkable,
and if it is continued at the same rate, by the time the
A.J.S. has a capital of £1,500,000 it will earn nothing at
all. The bank has £230,000 more cash on hand than it
had six months ago. It has reduced its reconstructed
deposits by £260,000 and thus makes a considerable
saving in interest; its new fixed deposits have diminished
—another saving in interest; its current accounts, which
don’t bear interest, have largely increased ; so has its
note circulation, and—as already mentioned—its capital.
All tliese favorable circumstances, along with a reduced
rate of expenditure, should have produced bigger profits,
yet the profits get smaller, and nothing in the sheet
throws any light on this unaccountable circum-
stance. If the new A.J.S. Bank, at the time of its pros-
perity, a year ago, had been exercising its un-
doubted right te buy up its own depreciated
■deposit-receipts at market-value that would, doubt-
less, account for everything; £lOO,OOO worth of old
inabilities, bought up and extinguished at, say, 16s. in the
£, would yield a net profit of £20,000, which would swell
the figures considerably. And if the A.J.S. had since
abandoned this practice the falling-off would be intel-
ligible. Otherwise it is wholly unintelligible.
The A.J.S. balance-sheet is the clearest, fullest,
and most definite document of its kind issued in Aus-
traliaf-* But even the most definite kind of balance-sheet
doesn’t throw much light on the problem now under
discussion.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
The resolve of the A.J.S. Bank directors to ask
for more time in which to pay off the first instalment of
the reconstructed deposits, or some other cause not very
well defined, was followed by the worst drop which the
bank has experienced for a long while. At time of writ-
ing, the £7 shares were being put into the market at
15s'.—a fall of 16s. from the quotation of a month ago, and
255. from that of last July.

The Widows’ Fund is the first of the big Austra-
lian life offices to issue its balance-sheet for the year. It
is on the whole a satisfactory document. The renewal
premiums (£145,000) and the new premiums (£10,000) are
both a little smaller than they were last year, and only
£84,000 has been added ‘ to the total funds against
£lOO,OOO in '93, hut these things are only what might be
reasonably expected in a time of profound and solemn
depression. The rate of interest has also declined some-
what—another circumstance which might be expected.
On the other hand, the funds now amount to the hand-
some figure of £1,190,548; the interest received from
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
neat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
ithe removal of this imperfection; and now, after
'long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.
investments more than covers all death claims ; and the
arrears of interest are set down at the very small sum of
£lBOO, which speaks well for the security of the invest-
ments. The Widows' Fund is the first office to show
separately the interest in arrear and the interest accrued
but not yet due, and it is to he hoped that this system,
which affords a valuable criterion of the safety of the in-
vestments, will be generally followed.
Another highly commendable circumstance is
that the properties acquired by foreclosure are distin-
guished from those purchased in the ordinary course of
business for use as offices. Properties obtained by fore-
closure of mortgages generally mean bad or dubious in-
vestments, and where the entire freehold estate of the
society is lumped together policy-holders are wholly
ignorant as to how much of their money has “ gone
wrong,” or, rather, is in danger of going wrong to a
greater or less extent. The total foreclosures of the
Widows’ Fund only amount to a little over £20,000 in all
—an exceedingly small amount compared to the total of
the investments. Here, also, Tub Bulletin hopes that
other societies will follow suit. The only bad feature in
the sheet is the expense account, per cent, of the
total premiums going in charges. Last year the society
spent barely 22 per cent., under this heading, and the
difference is serious. The board ought to go away to a
cool spot on a lonesome mountain side and think very
hard over this item. There is nothing else in the report
to which any objection can be taken, but this one entry
wants to be thought over until further notice.

The City Mutual Fire Insurance Co. pays a 10
per cent. div. and a handsome bonus to police-holders,
and ends the year with £320 to the good. This co. has
been 17 years in existence. In the first five years it
earned nothing in particular save a loss of £3700. During
the remaining 12 years it straightened up sufficiently to
wipe off the loss, accumulate a reserve of £lO,OOO, and
pay £15,000 in divs. In all that period it has only dis-
puted one claim, which is a record for liberality and
fair-dealing. The point which the directors ought
to think over now is that if they paid a smaller div. the
reserve-fund, which is a most important feature, would
get along a deal faster, and the City Mutual would
become a stronger concern than it now is.

The Bank of North Queensland reports having
made a net profit of £1674 ss. Bd. for the half-year. As
this amount would only pay a div. at the rate of 325. per
cent, per annum, the board wisely drops the painful sub-
ject and carries the amount forward as usual. The
B.N.Q. has still the same old reserve fund of £3OOO which
it had three years ago, but otherwise there is nothing
specially interesting to be said about it.

The Perpetual Trustee Co. of Sydney, an insti-
tution which was founded in order that the old house-
father might die happy with a consciousness that his
estate would be honestly administered, and that the
wicked s ilicitor wouldn’t get away with all his worldly
goods and leave his family penniless, is making good pro-
gress with its mission. Business is steadily increasing—
so much so that the co. is able to spend £l5OO in paying a
6 per cent, div., to add £lOOO to the reserve, and have
£594-still on hand. The pity of it is that business doesn’t
improve even faster than it is doing. The pathetic dying
father has to choose between (1) leaving his property
under his wife’s management, in which case her
second husband generally gets away with it; (2) leaving it
in trust with some personal friend, who generally spends
it ; (3) leaving it in trust with a solicitor, who devours it
and becomes a 11 Gent One,” and is struck off the rolls;
or (4) appointing a trustee co. his executor. And the
latter device, in the absence of a Public Trust Office, is so
much safer than any other that the man who leaves his
widow to the tender mercies of a lawyer or an bid friend
deserves to have no rest in Ids grave, and to be an
unquiet ghost on the solicitor’s doorstep until the end of
time.

The North Coast S.N. Co. (Sydney) has declared
a 6 per cent, div., which is one better than last year ; but
this is at least partly due to a 10 per cent, reduction on

The div. absorbs £3652, and the small balance of £B9 is to
be carried forward. The co.’s steamers, which are valued
at something like £70,000, could do with a little writing
down. However, having in view l the partial working of
the North Coast railway, and the low freights offering,
the co. has done better than might have been expected,

profits were £343,217, of which £288,000 was paid in divi-
dends and the h,dance carried to profit and loss, now in
credit £600,435. Cost of production has been reduced to
£2 3s. 7d. per ton. Estimated that about 1,000,060 tons
of payable oxidised ores, suitable for direct treatment,
yet remain to the mine ; and with the concentrating ore
and sulphides the manager sees two years' full work
ahead, and there is always the chance of new discoveries.

otherwise in a splendid condition. Over £160,000 in calls

Interesting calculation by commercial-editor
Thody, of the Argus, re the fall in prices. The ’94 exports
of Vic. are shown at ’9l prices:—
To show the laxness with which the Victorian
Income-tax Bill is compiled, it is quite possible for any
man with (say) £lOOO a year, “derived from personal
exertion,” to appoint, his wife his secretary at £2OO a
year, and his children (say 3) at £2OO a year each as his
a genii, and thus mop up all his income bar £2OO, which is
exempt. The revenue in such a case would not benefit a
copper.

The Royal Bank of Queensland produces
another balance-sheet which is calculated to make some
of its fellow “ reconstructs” green with envy. The lead-
ing feature about the Royal is the steadiness with which
it grinds out the same amount of profit (about
£6500), and pays the same 2J per cent, div., and
carries the same amount to reserve at the end
of each “ half.” In the present instance £3750
goes in divs., £2OOO to reserve, making it £27,000, and
£3OOO to contingency fund, to provide in advance for any
possible depreciation of securities. The Royal i» one of
the very few banks which make it a rule to pay awav only
about half the profits, however small they may be, in
divs., and the pity is that this system is not more gener-
ally followed. Also, its reserve is invested in Govt, securi-
ties, so that there is a fair chance of finding it when wanted.
The business keeps up remarkably well, and there are no
leisures in the report which suggest weakness. Every-
thing shows that the Royal could have ridden out the
storm of ’93 with perfect ease, and that its suspension
was merely the result of groundless panic at a time when
panic was in the air and everybody lost his head.

Estate-agent Ham called the attention of the
Vic. Legislative Council to the “injustice” of income-
taxing money which goes to pay interest on a mortgage
upon the victim’s dwelling-house. “ The mortgagee also
paying on the interest received, the property would be
taxed twice,” said the sapient Ham, and never a Coun-
cillor arose to tell him he was talking gammon. A man
who buys his own house and mortgages it is merely pay-
ing rent to the mortgagee out of his income, just as an
ordinary tenant pays rent to his landlord. Seeing that
the ordinary income-taxable person is taxed on his rent,
which has no more claim to exemption than his wine-bijl,
furniture outlay, grocery account, or any other item in
his expenditure, the Ham only knows where the mort-
gaged shareholder’s grievance comes in. An income
remains the same old income whether you possess mort-
gaged house property or no property at all, the drivel of
a legislative land-agent notwithstanding.

At a conference of stock inspectors, recently
held in Queensland, it was stated that Australian pastora-
Hats lose £300,030 a year through the careless branding
of hides alone. The brand, as a rule, is put on the most
valuable part of the hide, thus rendering it absolutely
useless for many purposes. There is no reason for this
except the pastoralist’s foolishness, unthrift and general
incapacity. Considering how this class ascribes all its
woes to the of Labor, it is interesting to know
that one of its biggest losses arises through its own in-
ability to put a hot iron on the cheapest end of a bullock.

Editor Bulletin, —Re your par. of Deo. 22.
The only crushing of Ivanhoe stone was 80 tons, which
was crushed at the Otis mill here, during a period of eight
weeks ending July 28, and costing over £7 a ton for
crushing only. The yield was 3400 z. Since then no
crushing has been made, for the simple reason that there is
nothing to crush with, as the Otis mill is unavailable, and
the only battery nearer than Bayley’s, the Lake View, was
not started till last Oct. and can only crush its own stone.
—Yours, Brian Hookbr, A.R.S.M., Manager.

The legal manager of the New Victoria G.M.
Co., Coolgardie, tells us that the co. did not, as stated,
crush five tons for 18oz. 7dwt. per ton by battery, and
260 z. per ton by chlorination. The 'eault in question was
from two parcels of 2J tons each, or an average of 8ioz.
per ton. The five tons was roughly picked so thatthe
heavy cost of carriage to Victoria should not result in a
loss. It is considered that the hulk of the stone will go
3nz. per ton ; 20 tons, taken from all parts of the mine,
just treated at the Bendigo Coolgardi- Co.’s battery,
returned 57oz. retorted gold, which, when the newness of
the plates is considered, would fully equal 3oz. per
ton. The amount of water available for treating the 20
tons was very limited, and had to be used over and over
again.
Cabled that one Gorrie, speaking at a London
meeting of Londonderry shareholders, stated they
“ would be unable to exhaust their mine for a genera-
tion.” Seeing that the mine is not proved below two or
three score feet, Mr. Gorrie knows nothing about it. Tub
Bulletin knows nothing more ; but it has pleasure in call-
ing him an Ananias on general gold-mining principles.
“ It is only the pick that can see into the face.” Earl
Fingall, not to be beaten, asserted that the reef as being
worked would go 6000oz. to the ton, and 20ft. further
down 600oz. Very likely; and how many tons? The
secretary said over 480,000 shares had been applied for.
If the applications are bona-fide, and the shares are to be
paid to £1, this puts the syndicate’s profit beyond doubt.
Time now' to set to work and do something for the share-
holders. The golden hole, it is announced, is not to be
worked “ until the battery has been erected.” Consider-
ing that specimen stuff is never put through the battery,
and that hundreds in interest are being lost by allowing
the OOOOoz. stuff to be in the ground, it would appear that
the promoters are already openly treating their min# as a
market-concern.

True the reef in Menzies’ “ cut out Into

The Empress of India and Scandinavian claims,
seven miles from Coolgardie, are said to have been pur-
chased by the Eldorado G.M. and P. syndicate, of Sydney,
and the purchase-money is said to lie the largest yet
paid by N.S.W. for any W.A. mine—which is an indefinite
sort of recommendation, for the amount is unstated.
This appears to be the first time these claims and the pur-
chasing syndicate were publicly heard of on this side.
It is news, too, to learn that “bulk samples, taken from
various parts of the mine, have given a result of 113oz.
gold per ton, while it is estimated that the whole faces
will yield, at least, 8 to lOoz. by ordinary battery
returns.”

The break of the cable last week was given as
the cause of a fall of 2s. in Bayley’s shares. If the mine
were in England this would be a reasonable explanation ;
as it is, it would appear to demonstrate the want of con-
fidence in the mine throughout Australia. The Londoners
are going to carry Bajdey’s baby.
Warden Finnerty is still away from Coolgardie,
and ’tis rumored that he is going to stay away. By the
way, his report on the L mdonderry appearing in the
prospectus is in the highest key. He declares that if the
golden surface hole maintains its present richness another
20 feet it will turn out gold to the value of £300,000.

Johnson’s gold-mines (Bendigo) have just been

Parke and Lacey, of Sydney, are turning out a
neat little battery of three 2501b. heads capable of crush-
ing 20 tons a week, running 120 with a six-inch drop.
Some miners who have one near Barraba, N.S.W., speak
of it as a marvel of cheapness and efficienc}', and with it
legitimate miners are freed from their miserable depend-
ence upon company-promoters and capitalists. These are
great recommendations.

A Bulletin correspondent has had
an opportunity of seeing a proof of the
reply to the Westminster Gazette articles
on “the Mahatma roar,” which Mrs,
Besant wrote upon her arrival in India. In
it she frankly says, “On the letters I was
duped,” and adds, “I willingly take any
bl une for my gullibility that may be cast on
me, for I wish only that the facts may be
known.” She sums up by saying : “With
regard to the future, I had hoped that Mr.
Judge would have resigned the vice-presi-
dency on the issue of the enquiry. As he
has not done so, I think he should be officially
requested to resign by the sections. But
if he refuses, and if he cannot be deprived,
lam not going to resign from the Theo-
sophical Society because one cannot remove
an official, elected before these objections
to him arose. Were he now elected pre-
sident, I should resign, because that would
imply approval by the society of his course
of action.”

Octogenarian White (father of R. H. D.
White, M.L.C. of N.S. Wales), drowned in the
Wairarapa, was universally known in pastoral
circles as a crack station-manager, especially on
the Darling, up to 30 years ago. At Bathurst, he
was once disgusted with an honorary magistrate,
who appeared on the bench with a black eye to
deal with the drunks. Remarks by White led to
a hostile me ting, with pistols. The amateur
beak, in a very shickery condition, fired first.
White then refused to fire, saying, “ Man, you’re
too drunk !”
Dear Bulletin, —You ask “ Is Anthony
Hope related to Gov. Hopetoun ?” Very likely.
His “Half a Hero” is an Australian story in
which much of the action passes in what may be
taken for Melb. Government House—though the
plot would better fit Maoriland. The leading char-
acter—Medland—is thus suggestively described by
a reviewer:—
He is a middle-aged man and an Australian Labor-
leader who has had a history, for a lady with whom he
lived for many years was not his wife, hut somebody
else’s. He has a daughter who is pretty, etc.
Now, mark that “etc ” ! —P.M.
The three Premiers of N.S. Wales, S.A.,
and Westralia were, as distinguished visitors,
given seats on the floor of Vic. Assembly. The
view of these three skulls and that of Premier
Turner, from the Press gallery, revealed a sur-
prising cranial similarity. The four Premiers
have heads of about the same size and shape—
Reid’s being, if anything, slightly fatter than the
others’—and they are all bald to about the same
extent. Reid’s “Giotto’s O” face is in strange
contrast to that of his brother, Hugh R. Reid,
chairman of Melb. Chamber of Commerce, who is
a little, sharp-featured, vermilion-skinned, scarlet-
bearded geranium.
Now that Lord is married some of
our San Francisco belles may breathe easier and
thank Heaven that there is no possibility of
becoming a peeress this year. His lordship made
a poor start on his honeymoon. It is not good
form, unless in English society (that is, the
society which receives the Earl), to get boiling
drunk at your wedding breakfast. Even Ward
M’Allister, who assigns to the obedient New
Yorker his place in society, can hardly condone
this. That his lordship is a mighty poor hand
at sobering up is evinced by the fact that this
morning drunk assumed the proportions of what
is known in Americanese as a “holdover,” and
held over so long that the fair bride had to woo
her lonely pillow, while the noble groom was put
to bed. Those little eccentricities should not,
however, at all interfere with the desire of our
girls to elevate themselves in society and get
properly wedged on to some sort of nobility.
If I were a young woman I’d rather marry an
English bank-clerk, who banged his hair, than

One Australian Governor who has the
best and most expensive set of false teeth in the
country, whenever his heart warms to a new
acquaintance, takes them out of his mouth and

Judge Boucaut, of Adelaide, whose wife
was recently left =£50,000, is constantly haunted
by the dread of poverty. If he only had 3000
shillings a year, instead of over that number
of pounds, he could not live more frugally.
The death of Lady Hanson, in
Adelaide, during January, recalled a society
episode long forgotten. Her husband, who
died in March, ’76, was Chief Justice of
S.A., but the upper ten turned their backs
on him because he married his housekeeper.
Henry Lucy, in S.M. Herald, gives
credit to Cecil Rhodes for taking care of
dead Lobengula’s three sons. The incident
is not exceptional. Greek brigands regard
it as a sacred duty to provide for the
orphans of people who have been murdered
in the way of business.
Taverner, Yic. Minister of Agricul-
ture, tells this yarn. Some enthusiastic
students of the art of perfume-making at
Dunolly Govt. Scent .Farm sent the Minister
a sample bottle for trial. Taverner care-
fully stowed it away in his trunk at the
hotel, but the cork being loose the scent
escaped. When the waiter was ordered by
the Minister to pack his trunk the odour
was very prevalent. On meeting Taverner
he said, apologetically: “Sorry, sir, you
left your trunk open last night, for the cat
must have got into it.”
No man could be as great a statesman
as J. B. Patterson looks. Since he has
been a knight he has more and more culti-
vated the magnificent air, and always speaks
with one leg slightly bent and thrust for-
ward, one hand on the hip, one finger wag-
gling, and one cuff arranged over the hand
—just as British statesmen pose in the
illustrated papers. The contrast with Premier
Turner is most marked. The latter is
shabby in dress, wears a common bowler
hat, rides on a threepenny tram, and hasn’t
as much “side ” as a flounder.
Mr. Justice Dodds (Tas.) had a painful
experience lately. Whilst walking down a quiet
Hobart street swinging his cane he was so unfor-
tunate as to strike a small but vigorous dog, who
retaliated by hopelessly rending the trousers of
Justice.
The story goes that a certain Australian
Governor, while “out on his own” one evening,
was introduced to the smartest of Sydney barmaids
as “Doctor Something.” “ Glad to meet you,
Doctor,” chirruped Hebe; “ you look awfully like
old Gov. , only, of course, much younger and
handsomer. Seltzer or soda, Doctor?”
Geo. Gordon M‘Crae’s novel, “The Man
in the Iron Mask,” will shortly be issued. Two
or three publishers have been confessedly timid
about its “improbabilities;” for, although the
scene is laid in the time of Queen Anne, the
plot begins and ends in Australia. The author
managed to get hold of some old records of the
time of Defoe, which gave him a good start for a
thrilling tale.
Randolph Churchill’s meteoric career
dazzled chiefly because meteors are miracles in
the Conservative sky. In any other quarter of
the heavens he would never have risen so high to
fall so far. At least half his celebrity comes from
the environriient in which he found himself when
he to make it. Yet Randolph Churchill
was no brilliant shallowpate. He said true things
as well as smart things; and his campaigns against
the ponderous dullness of Tory philistines were
ably planned as well as cleverly conducted.
When, after five years’ guerrilla warfare, he
became Secretary for India, and a year later rose
to be Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of
the House of Commons, he displayed a reserve of
strength for which few had given him credit. Bub
Randolph Churchill could not “stay,” and when
he left office after a few months’ trial his political
career was definitely closed. Since then he has
been travelling in search of the health ruined
in the stress of political combat, and his
re-appearance two years ago in tiie Parlia-
mentary arena was utterly devoid of interest.
Now he is dead at 46 ; having (so it is said)
fallen a victim to the morphia habit, which he
contracted when in anxious search of a cure for
his overstrained nerves. His short, eager, intense
life is a monument of fin-de siecle conditions, with
universal neurosis paving the way for the Ragnarcik
of civilisition.
The late Joseph Clarke, herewith repre-
sented as he was ere the flowing bowl filled him
jut and Mrs. Clara Parker took his hair off, leaves
(jo enemies to enlarge upon his little failings. Of
“Joe” Clarke, as of his brother William, Bart.,
it must be said that the vast fortune left him by a
penurious father enriched a very accessible sort of
charity. Generosity comes easy to rich men only
when they are that way disposed. Joseph Clarke
was so free with his inherited coin as to justify a
belief that he had a bit of gold in his heart to
begin with. What he gave in public was a small
matter compared with the amount of his private
benefactions, wise and otherwise. He was always a
friend to the widowand thefatherless, and if hemade
a large distinction in favor of saucy little widows
who required setting up in the hotel line —well,
there’s nothing in the New Testament against that.
He became, under pressure from bad advisers, a
most unholy show in the Clara Parker scandal,
but behind the evidence of folly for which he paid
so dearly, in more than a financial sense, lay the
fact that Joe Clarke’s pocket suffered a tremen-
dous amount of punishment before he could be
induced to kick. From a high political and social
point of view this man was unadmirable. His
existence, as a large landholder and self-indulging
idler, was a regrettable circumstance. But his
death is sincerely regretted by many people who,
having served Joe Clarke, or been served by him,
wish that all capitalists were as courteous and
openhanded as our bacchanalian brother gone
before.

Besides this, almost every steamer has had depu-
tations to the captain about the food. Returning
stone-broke fossickers aren’t over-particular, but
the steerage-fare on most of these boats is simply
disgraceful. On board the steamer the writer
went over in, meals for 300 were cooked in a little
caboose hardly big enough to hold the cook ; so
that the mullock-heap of meat-scraps intended’for
stew had to be left outside—to leeward of all the
tobacco-spitters and a reeking stench coming from
the defective sanitary arrangements. And over
this a monkey capered. There was this stew
three times a day. Once a chicken-bone, picked
clean of all meat, was found in it—proof that
the saloon plates were scraped into the steer-
age stew-pot. This bone was hung up in the cabin
as a warning. “Duff, ho ! ’’—then plates were
scraped of grease and meat into the middle of the
table to clean them for the “ duff.” But the worst
was the bread. It was stacked in an open locker,
flush with the deck, in a cabin where 25 men were
more or less sea-sick. The very stowaways work-
ing their passages were given joints with the crew,
while passengers, who had paid, were treated like
hogs. The writer had one decent meal—when he
and two others made a raid on the saloon galley at
midnight and stole two sheeps’-heads.

factory, with a keen foresight set to work to
supply his old Australian friends with a really

is the cheapest to work, and in reality the most
suitable for any cigar. It was the original old
shape of the early cigar-rnaking period. Fros-

wonderfully cheap smoke ; packets of eight are

The articles most imitated are
CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS.
WHY?
BECAUSE they have the best reputation and
are most in demand by the public, consequently,
every dishonest trader tries to trade on their fame
and renown.
It is really wonderful that the Australian people
are so slow to see the truth as regards the un-
scrupulous quacks and charlatans who prey on the
credulity of the Australian public. Scarcely a
week passes but what the press exposes the bare-
faced and shameless practices of some of these
harpies, yet, in face of all, they seem to thrive, and
the paper which hounds them down most thrives
fattest on their advertisements and cracks cham-
pagne over each balance-sheet. Clements Tonic
and Fletcher’s Pills have never yet stooped to
deception and misrepresentation. They are scien-
tific therapeutical agents, and evidence as to their
value can bo found in every district, and such
being the case it is unnecessary to further extol
their virtues.

Woolloornooloo, for nearly a century,
The Adelaide Tories are trying to push
forward Symon, Q. 0., as their leader, and to boom
him against Kingston, Q.O. He objects, how-
ever, to follow Kingston’s lead by sacrificing his
profession for politics.
The relative importance of things in Vic-
toria : —White Knight M’Gibbon, chairman of
Melb. Board of (Sewerage) Works, salary .£2OOO
a year ; Geo. Turner, Premier, Treasurer and
Minister of Defence, salary <£l4oo.
The same old disease. The Reid Govern-
ment proposes to build a court-house at Warded,
a village with a population of 426 persons, who
have hitherto been successfully fined 2s. 6d. at the
expensive Government premises at Ballina, only
10 miles distant. As another item of retrench-
ment, it is related that when Garrard was
made Minister of Ignorance in the Reid
Cabinet, he promptly had the telephone laid on
to his house at Balmain, a number of posts
being erected and a long line of wire stretched for
the purpose. A week or two later Jacob removed
to a more aristocratic suburb, and a good many
pounds’ worth of telephone is now attached to an
empty house.
In Victoria, the qualification
of the common juror is being a
ratepayer assessed at not less than
£2O per annum. Now, as the
working man’s rent has fallen to
not more than 7s. per week, no
laborer will be on a jury; it will
consist of salesmen, clerks, shop-
keepers, and small property-
owners—classes peculiarly liable
to accept as sheer gospel the sum-
ming-up of a judge, and also gifted
with an exaggerated respect for
Law’n’order.
J. C. Neild has been ap-
pointed to a seat on N.S.W. Civil
Service Commission. There is
only one conceivable excuse for
the appointment—that Neild, by
his defeat at last N.S.W. general
election, was deprived of his poli-
tical income. The fact that he is
only known to the public as em-
phatically a professional party
politician ought to have operated
as a bar to his appointment to a
position for which partisanstiip of
any kind is, or should be, an abso-
lute disqualification. Another
and still more serious bar would
be Neild’s long and close connec-
tion with the politico-sectarian
Orange institution. No matter
how high a man’s reputation for
personal integrity may be, par-
tisanship must warp his judgment;
and surely it is not claimed by his
patrons, the Reid Govt., that he
possesses the com manding intellect
which alone might be thought to
compensate for want of fairness.
Ifc is to be hoped that advantage will not
be taken of N.S.W. Minister Carruthers’zeai for
Labor settlements to saddle the country with a
heavy bill for land-resumption. Surely there is
enough public territory available for the purpose.
Minister Young, of N.S.W., complains
that rumors have been circulated to the effect that
the ,£216,000 extra which the Reid Govt, pro-
poses to spend on roads (and to charge to its
predecessors) isn’t “really available.” The money,
Mr. Young points out, was voted in ’93, and
therefore there can’t be the slightest doubt as to
its availability. Which is remarkable logic, to
say the least. Everybody knows the money was
voted, but as there is no such sum on hand the
ayailableness isn’t apparent. Treas. Reid should
sit down in a cool spot and ask himself how
money that doesn’t exist can be made available
by a Parliamentary vote or by any other means.

Oracularly remarks Sydney E. News :
We have heard men undergoing peculiar experiences
through a mother-in-law, but never before heard that
having a father-in-law was a qualification for a seat in the
Legislature.
Nonsense ! Had Honniker Heaton never had a
father-in-law, he would not now be representing
the Evening News in the British House of
Commons.
A weak old person named Melville rose in
Vic. Legislative Council to point out that the
Income-tax would “crush all thrift.” Just now a
man naturally wants an income and does his best,
by thrift or otherwise, to get one; but when the
Government takes 6d. in the <£ of his annual
revenue and only leaves him a miserable 19s. 6d.
to himself, he will be so much broken up that he
will try to avoid the ruinous impost by not having
any income at all. Notwithstanding which, Mel-
ville, M.L.C., will still have all the income he can
get and wish that he had a lot more, and every-
body else will do the same. Thrift is a tough
virtue.
Duncan Gillies, who was smuggled into

Dunoan will not oblige his bleeding country by
being too much offended to stay on at >£lsoo a

the gentleman’s puffy conceit. There was no
real question of a breach of faith with Gillies in
this salary matter, for the appointment was made
by Patterson, behind Victoria’s back, and the
country subsequently washed its hands of Patter-
son and all his works. But the breach of faith in
Gillies is undeniable, therefore the retrenched
Agent-General feels at the present moment very
like a tin god who has been badly dented by the
heel of an ignorant democracy.

A recent World unearths an odd thing

Villa Manoini, Como. However, she was so full
of nous that he could only get a rapid glimpse as
she skipped into a carriage. Gladstone gave this
evidence in the divorce suit before the Peers.

A lately-returned Church
dignitary, in the course of a
pastoral visitation, once spent
a night at an up-oountry
station. One of his fellow-
guests was notoriously fond of
whisky, while the other habi-
tually limited himself i<> a
nightly glass, but that evening,
to the surprise and alarm of
their entertainer, not only the
bishop, but the whole party
passed the bottle in gloomy
silence, declining even to
moisten their lips, Cater on,
the host sat racking his brains
in solitude as to the cause of
this phenomenon, until realis-
ing the awful sufferings of his
thirstier friend, he took the
bottle and glass and stole on
tip-toe to hjs bedside. He was
warmly welcomed and given
to understand that his visitor's
abstinence had been inspired
by a fear oif going too far
before his lordship. Passing
on to the next room, the
squatter was again received
with acclamation, and the
confession that crony No. 2
had denied himself his drink,
so as not to start off the
weaker brother. Emboldened
by Jthese experiences the host
now ventured to tap gently at
his reverence's door, armed
with another “ nightcap.” In
this case, he found the stum-
bling-block had been a matter
of principle. In fact, it would
not have been seemly for an
ecclesiastic to indulge in the
presence ,of a totally-abstain-
ing laity. After this, the good
Samaritan banished all fears
that his house-party might be
translated, before mornings
into a fiery ohariot, and hav-
ing clinked glasses with the
bishop he went to bed with a
light heart.

The painful anxiety of Sydney Trades Hall
people to secure Gov. Duff for their opening ban-
quet, and the open disgust with which his excuse
for non-attendance was received, show how much
snobbery still lies embedded in trades-union
officials. The snub was richly deserved, and The
Bulletin hopes it will be repeated every time the
unions invite it. What have Australian workers
to do with an imported figurehead, and why should
alleged democrats yearn for the presence of
royalty’s representative at a typical workers’
function ? There is nothing in common between
Democracy and Guvmentouse, and, if Democracy
doesn’t know it, all the better that Guvmentouse
does.

The “victim” in the Sydney military
seduction case says (as per the newspaper-reports)
that, while engaged to marry a Civil Service clerk,
she succumbed six hours after first meeting the
go'd-laced hero ! The magnetism of Mars is pro-
verbial ; but, in the case of a Venus of 2G springs
this Barkis-like “ willin’’’-ness leaves little room
for the conventional suggestions of trustful inno-
cence and base betrayal. A fortress which has
been accumulating defences for 26 years does not
surrender in six hours without a suspicion of
treason on the part of the garrison. And there
was, it seems, no promise of marriage—the sur-
render was unconditional. Even excitable Major-
General Hutton, who, in his eagerness to make
Bayards sans reproche of the members of his tin-
pot army, is said, before the enquiry, to have sug-
gested to Gov. Duff the cashiering of the guilty
officer, now commences to see his error. “ The
woman that deliberates is lost,” wrote Addison.
And also the woman that doesn't, apparently. In
truth Addison knew more about wine than woman,
or he would never have uttered the showy half-truth.
Pope’s sweeping generalisation shows aCuter
vision : “ Every woman is at heart a rake.’’

At Gov. Kintore’s farewell procession from
Adelaide railway-station, a stout and protuberant
dowager, wife of a wealthy local merchant, made
frantic efforts to shake hands with the departing
lord. His Ex. knew nothing of her struggles,
however —mainly through the heroic defence of a
foot policeman who highly amused the crowd by
his resistance of the lady’s blandishments. It was
this lady, by the way, who was the central figure
in an amusing yarn which Lady Kintore has
doubtless long ago retailed to her English friends.

Neither Major Sebright nor Capt. Milner,
who were on Lord Kintore’s staff, would remain
to ease Mr. Way’s term of office as S. A. Lieut. -
Governor, and he has to fall back on Dr. Penne-
father, a lecturer at Adelaide University, who
was once private secretary to Gen. Jervois. It is
not likely that Mr. Way’s reign will extend
much beyond the end of next April. Already the
aggregate length of his service as Acting Governor
exceeds two years and three months.
The late Vic. Post-
office detective, Lomax,
(a real good fellow, by
he way), once accidentally
imperilled the fortunes
of a somewhat promin-
ent Southern squatting
family. After “ nailing”
a dishonest letter-carrier
in a certain town, Lomax,
in searching the culprit’s
lodgings for pilfered pro-
perty, came across a miss-
ing wi 1 which gave to a
woman of the town
£2), 000 worth of pro-
perty that had then been
occupied by testator’s
relatives (in virtue of a
prior will) for seven or
eight years. Although a
law-suit was threatened,
the matter was settled by
the “ family ” allowing
the “ unfortunate ” £4OO
a year for life out of the
estate. She drank herself
to death within a year of
the arrangement being
made, and that family,
who now have all, are
the only teetotallers in
Victoria who don’t rave
about the “ curse of
drink.” Apropos unfair
wills. Many years ago a
then handsome young
Queensland lady was left
& widow, without child-
ren, and with £2OOO a
year conditionally on her
not re-marrying. The in-
come was derived entirely
from bank-shares. The
widow assuaged her grief
fur the next 16 years by
taking trips to America
= On tile bank «e W
trips ceased, and she went insolvent to avoid
calls, but her position in society was retained
until last spring, when two young fellows, 12 and
14 respectively, called on her at afternoon tea, ex-
plaining their presence by saying that they had
to partly work their way out to see Ma, as the
people they were staying with in Pans wouldn t
keep them any longer gratis.
The seven Rational Dress women, who went
to Fernshaw (Vio.) for their Xmas holiday in
knickerbockers, wore skirts in the train. They
shunted just before reaching Healesville, where

astonishment of the railway men and Healesville

A Londoner married a Melb. girl at ’Ome

mitted by his wife to run down to Frankston for a
day’s sea-fishing. Hubby, as a matter of fact,
spent his day somewhere in Lonsdale-street, and,
on his return, presented his astonished Australian
wife (as the result of his day’s sea-fishing) with
three Murray-cod weighing about 7lb. apiece!!

Editor Bulletin, —Let me tell you of the
Gentleman of the Gaol Van. _ Circular Quay,
Sydney, 4.50 p.m. Nemesis, in the shape of
“ Black Maria,” awaiting her load. The water-
police range themselves to form a passage. No
word is spoken. The doors of the van are thrown
open. Men and women file out of their respective
compartments. A young man, with an old felt
hat pulled down over his face, evidently not
relishing the gaze of the curious. An “ old
geyser of a woman ” with wrinkled and bruised
face, dirty, repulsive, and feeble—so feeble that it
is with much difficulty she attempts to negotiate
the three steps to the ground. As she hangs
on tremulously to the hand-rail the officers
tender no assistance, but stand and silently gaze.
The young man, noticing the old woman in her
difficulty, turns toward her. His left_ hand
involuntarily raises his old hat as with his right he
hands down the battered wreck with the ease and
grace of a courtier. Just the act of a few
seconds, and then with bowed head he fol-
lows onboard the steamer. The whisk of a driver s
whip, the turn of a steamer’s screw, and the great
world moves on as before; but the Recording
Angel has put another dot opposite the word
“Gentleman’’—the Gentleman of the Gaol Van.

Berrima (N.S.W.) District Leader, Dec.

Mrs. T. Reidy’s small goods’ shop, in Bong Bong-street,
Bowral, supplies a long-felt want, a statement which is to
some extent proved by the fact that the sale of pigs Diet
has increased, since she opened, from one dozen to five
dozen a week.

obviously but a thinly-disguised version of Bong-

One Brodzky prints in his (Melb.) paper :
Mr. Alf. Greaoy, who has been appointed an officer on
H M V.S. Nelson, from the Tin-tack Office, where he ful-
filled clerical duties for two or three years, promises to be
one of the “ pets of high society.” Mr. Greacy is good-
looking, and at a recent “at home, ' given at the Naval
Depot in Williamstown, he created a most favorable
impression among the ladies. Since then he has been
JiHed on all sides, and his quiet, genial manner, together
•with a rather attractive appearance, has made him most
popular in society circles.
As the lines are not marked “advt.,” it is safe to
assume that the pretty Mr. Greacy did not pay
for their insertion, and that Brodzky aforesaid is
wholly responsible for the loathsome remarks. Is
it in accordance with the laws of compensation
that when the new woman takes to knickers the
bewchus sassiety youth should have his features
slobbered over in print ? The very next thing, no
doubt, will be : “Mr. Alf. Greacy, looking sweetly
pretty in a lovely confection of lavender pants
with a corsage of grey doth, was the cynosure of
all eyes.” Ain’t it sickenin’ ?

Dear Bulletin,— Many of our residents
have “ gone home ” (from Hannan’s) of late, and
there is now a boom in coffin making, grave-
digging and other things incidental to the plant-
ing” of the late-lamented. Owing to the scarcity
of alluvial gold, the gaunt and dusty dryblower
does not always know where to get his daily tinned
dog, so gravedigging is locally looked upon as a
light and pleasant means of earning an honest
shilling. So much so that two parties run a hot
and furious opposition, and are wont each to keep
at least three ready-dug graves in stock. And as
there is no properly - defined burying-place at
Hannan’s, party feeling runs high whenever
either of the rivals is favored with the care
of the deceased. Last week a poor fellow shot
himself. Both sets of gravediggers turned up to
secure the remains, each chanting the praises of
its own particular location. One firm quoted
£3 as the price of a grave; the other offered to do
it in style for £2 10s. This last was almost
accepted, when a brawny German forced his way
in and offered to do all such job lots at .£1 each.
His offer was closed with on the spot; but when
the Progress Committee inspected his site, it was
found that the wily Teuton had pegged out a
50ft. claim right on some played-out workings.
He had improved the shining hour by levelling
down the old tailings-heaps, leaving the diggers’
shafts open, and was therefore in a position to
undercut his rivals. To the credit of the com-
mittee, they decided not to encourage foreign
labor.—J.P. Hannan’s, 13/1/95.

Dear Bulletin, —An experience of cheap
undertakers. A poor woman, whose husband had
died, called upon an undertaker who advertised
funerals at .£5. On asking what the <£s included
she was told “ a hearse, coach, coffin, clergyman,
and everything.” After being shown a photo, of
what a grand funeral it would bo with an extra
coach, she arranged to have the extra coach for
•£6 10s. in all. On the day fixed for the burial
the undertaker arrived an hour late with a ram-
shackle hearse and two dilapidated coaches, all
drawn by bay horses. After handing round 12
cards for the occupants of the two coaches, which
combined were only fit to properly accom-
modate eight persons, a start was made for
the cemetery. Arrived at the grave, there was
no clergyman, but the resourceful undertaker
borrowed one from an adjoining funeral, “giving
him the office” to cut things short. When the
burial was over, it was found that the hearse and
one of the mourning-coaches had set out to funeral
another corpse. This left the mourners nothing
to do but endeavour to crowd into the remaining
coach. On arrival at the first tram-line on the
road home the driver drew up and dealt out tram-
tickets to those inside, remarking that he had
driven them to the cemetery, but was damned if
he would drive them home; and as the tram was
about 50 times as comfortable as the coach, no-
thing much was said. Next morning brought the
widow a bill for .=£9 10s., the extra <£3 being for
cemetery expenses and damages to the coach, the
side of which came out through overcrowding.
Inquiries prove the undertaker’s whole stock-in-
trade to consist of what he had out that day.—
Paul Blunt.

Afc the recent test-match in Adelaide, just
when there was a lull, two tame dudes, dressed
up to date, were seated in a dog-cart behind a
smart-looking coachman. “Can’t you move on,
coachman? ” said the proprietor dude. “ I can’t,
sir—this doctor’s trap is in the way.” “ Well,
my deah man, you weally must—ah—ask him to
back out a little.” The doctor’s trap backed out,
the dudes’ coachman flicked his horse, the horse
jumped, and one dude flew out on to a fruit-stall
and tried to hatch some peaches, wl ilst the other,
a stout and healthy 14-stoner, just missed an
afternoon tea-party by six inches. Didn’t the
crowd roar!
The law is a conundrum. A Redfern
(Sydney) defendant, charged with having com-

ground that the municipal by-law only compelled
him to keep his premises from causing a nuisance ;
while the prosecution admitted that the nuisance
was caused, not by the premises, but by the
sheepskins on the premises ! Daniel might come
to judgment for a million years without getting
level with Sydney stipendiaries.

The swagman will get acclimatised in Aus-
tralia by-and-bye. A while ago a North Queens-
land digger got married to a girl of 22 or
thereabouts, and the very day of their marriage
news came of a promising rush in the Batavia
River district, so the pair started out manfully for
their honeymoon to walk the 250 miles that lay
between them and the scene of action. The
present writer hasn’t heard of them since, but
trusts the bride arrived there safely, and that they
met with luck. More recently a N.S.W. man
with a wife, two small children, an infant, and a
heavy swag, marched from Albury to Corowa
(N.S.W.), and thence to Broadford (Vic.) in’
search of work. Part of the road lay
over swamps where he had to carry the
family, one at a time, through long stretches of
water two feet deep. His progress was regulated
by the walking abilities of the wife and the two
children, his average rate being five miles a day.
There was no work to be found at the end of the
long journey, so the family walked on again and
disappeared over the horizon, the man carrying
the swag, the wife burdened with the infant, and
the two small children trotting alongside. Pro-
bably the whole family is still walking. Almost
the only regular work to be obtained in Australia
now consists of walking.

846 Macquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
January 29, 1895.
My Dear Moorabinda—
“Sowing the Wind,” at Sydney Lyceum, is
what people call a “ costume play.” The dressing
in the new comedy, which had the honor of re-
introducing the unspeakably-popular B and B.
co. to Sydney amid howls of welcome, belongs to
the days when George the Fourth was king, or
thereabouts. I cannot say that the bird’s-eye ap-
pearance of the ladies in the play fills me with a
wil-d longing to throw back on the sartorial trail.
The good old days were evidently very bad old
days for women who weren’t pooket-Venuses, so
to speak.
Mrs. Brough was the only stage-lady who
looked anything but a sketch in the up-and-down
clothing of the period. On her first appearance—
when the applause was almost too enthusiastic for
her self-possession, I thought (there is a point
when prolonged applause becomes painful, though
first-night audiences never seem to feel it)—Mrs.
Brough wore a mouse-colored travelling-dress,
concealed by a brown velvet cloak, and topped off
by a brown velvet hat, presenting a most artistic
whole, very different (intentionally so, I have no
doubt) from Miss Romer’s appearance in sandals, a
shawl, and a coal-scuttle bonnet, or from pretty
Grace Noble’s, who had curls and a pancake hat,
and a square dress with little bows up the front,
which a jin-de-sibcle doll would jibe at. I thought
Miss Noble’s giddy giggle threw quite a new light
on our great-grand mothers, by the way. If the
majority of the back-number of our she-ancastors
were as unpromisingly flighty in manner as Miss
Fretwell, I don’t see how anybody can feel alto-
gether confident on the subject of the family-tree.
I didn’t approve of Cecil Ward making his first
appearance as the confiding hero in a grasshopper-
green suit. .Rosamond was as good as gold, of
course ; but still, green is a fatal color for a youth
to wear, whose sweetheart likes to talk about her
past in a haggard tone of voice—even if it turns
out to have been her mother’s past, after all. The
men, by the way, have the best of the dressing in
“ Sowing the Wind.” Titheradge, who looks like
the village priest in the last act, is a tone-poem in
snuff-color, to begin with ; and Mr. Dorrington,
as Sir Richard Cursitor, wears a pretty-colored
topcoat, that is both chronologically correct and
strictly up-to-date, as the long-skirted coat with a
high waist is one of the latest horsey-fashions from
’Ome.
But I must confess I cannot quite see why the
dramatist made an old-time setting for “Sowing
the Wind.” Up-to-date tin-de-siecle problems
sound incongruous in the mouth of a woman who
curtsies with profound and graceful humility to
all the men and tabby women in the play. Every
artistic curve of Mrs. Brough’s backbone ex-
presses the woman who venerates men as monarchs
of all they survey—but once she assumes a per-
pendicular attitude her sentiments brace up too
apparently, and no Green Carnation of them all
could hope to improve upon the succinct roll-call of
naked and embarrassing truisms which Rosamond
lets fly at the bald-head of the good old gentleman
whom she “ made a leg ” to with so much sweet-
ness and deference in Act I. The graceful
curtsey, by the way, is one of the pleasantest
things in this interesting play. Women should
revive the curtsey, for it suits ’em. There is
something in it so suggestive of a oat coiling for a
spring.
Things must be coming to a most uncharitable
pass in Sydney when husbands are forced to
advertise in the daily papers that their honor is
intact —as one of our wealthiesfmen saw fit to do,
the other day. That healthy, philosophical gag,
“ They say—what say they ?—let’em say,” must
be falling into desuetude when such a public
notice-extraordinary as that gets into one’s morn-
ing paper. But it only shows what tattlesome
ones there are and what a long way ahead (or
behind) of the mote and beam business we’ve got.
I believe Sydney has rather a strong reputation
for piping-hot on dits. I vividly recollect an
Englishwoman asking me once, in a scared voice,
if all the ladies in Sydney were *** ? She put it in
asterisks, and so must I, and really she may have
meant s raphim, for all I actually know. She had
undergone a course of afternoon-teas, though,
where the women had been engaged in capping
stories about their friends, so I didn’t suppose she
questioned me as to whether local belledom wore
wings under its gigot sleeves or not.
But—sharp though the slander may be—it is far
from worldly-wise, in my opinion, to make a
“public notice ” matter of it, whatever form the
gossip may happen to take. Stories are always
more satisfactorily lived down than hounded
down, unless you can catch the original mischief-
maker and pin her up to discourage the others.
But complete innocence has been its own champion
from time immemorial, and if the Paulina Piys say,
for instance, that Darby has gone off with Flossie
Footlights, or that Joan has fled with Don Juan,
what completer defence could you have than the
appearance of Darby and Joan aforesaid eheek-
by-jowl in some public place ? Nobody is obliged
to believe all that he or she hears, but seeing’s
quite a different matter.
There is one thing that Australians can lay
claim to —and that is being the best-washed people
on the surface of this grubby earth. In France,
very broadly speaking, they only wash about once
a month—being mostly direct descendants (in the
matter of ablutions) from that King Louis whose
morning rinse was a drop of spirits of wine in
either palm; and in some other European coun-
tries about once a year, if the weather’s propitious;
while the Englishman who hurls his “tub” at
you in fiction, by all independent accounts knows
less about it in absolute fact than you’d imagine.
In most British places of entertainment for man
and beast they charge you 2s. for a hot bath, and
Is. for a cold one. In hundreds of “hotels” and
more or less fashionable lodging-houses it is still
the custom to use the antique “ tub,” and up to
very recently a bath-room was the exception
rather than the rule in the British household.
Somebody in Sydney was taxing a Johnny-come-
lately with the absence of baths on his native
mud-bank the other day. “Oh, but you know,”
be protested, “ nearly all the modern houses have
bathrooms.” “ Ah—that must be since the Aus-
tralians began going ’Ome,” said a still small
voice.
In Australia the- great majority is clean. Be-
side the domiciliary bathroom, the place is a net-
work of swimming-baths—Coilingwood (Vic.)
being the latest in the field with public baths to
cost .£l3OO, mostly raised by the Australian
Natives’ Association. Though I don’t think all
baths quite fill the cleansing bill—mind you.
There is one Victorian place of ablution where
the first bath is sixpence, but you pay much less
for the privilege of disporting in the second bath,
which consists of the more or less greasy water
left by the sixpenny aristocrats who have gone
before ! But still, a bath is a bath, whether you
are last in or not, and the well-crusted Tory jibe
about “the great unwashed” has little or no
significance in Australia.
I was at Newcastle (N.S.W.) the other day—the
coaly seaport where the degage unattire of the
populace on the ocean beach provoked ex-Attorney-
General Heydon’s famous edict re bathing-gowns
from “ neck to knee’’—and saw at a glance that
there was too much bathing among the women and
children. Shoals of anaemic bony infants swarm
on the sands and soak in the water with blue lips
and lifeless complexions—little, skinny, yellow
creatures, not one of whom realises one’s ideal
child with a round face delicately tinted (you
don’t look for apple-cheeks in these latitudes).
And not only little children, but growing girls are
perilously allowed to spend whole afternoons in
wet, flattering bathing garments, puddling about
on the sand, and soddening in the sea, in a way to
make Dr. Anna Potts turn in her grave (if she
has one). I never saw one sprightly, pink-skinned
woman, girl, or baby during the whole of my
stay in Newcastle. The surf has washed the
“ tuck ” out of them, and I thiuk it is quite time
somebody let them know it.
Mrs. Lees, Sydney’s scarcely-unpacked brand-
new Mayoress, holds her first civic reception at
Sydney Town Hall next Thursday, 7th Feb., at 3
p.m., and I only hope that, with a new mayoral
regime, a new style of civic welcome will obtain.
I mean, it is quite time the official hand-shake —
flabby, nerveless, meaningless, recalling the tail of
a dead schnapper or a cold shoulder of mutton —
was cut off in its old age, and something else sub-
stituted—any tiling, for a change, short of rubbing
noses, to which the teetotal party might strongly
object, in defence of their principles.
A smile and a bow is really the correct way to
receive a mob of strange people, whom you don’t
know from Adam and Eve, and who don’t know
you either, and would do away with the spectacle
of the hostess holding out a soiled and uninviting
glove for “ middling ” late-oomera to shake, if they
feel like it.
This system of indiscriminate paw-snatching
always seems to me to be a most remarkable phase
of “society.” In one’s plain dealings with one[s
fellow-man and woman even an introduction is
received with a mere inclination of the head —but
let the public loose on the premises and lo ! each
comer must be pinched by the hand as if to deter-
mine whether he or she is real or not! At the
same time, though, there are some people who
actually enjoy pawing the multitude. Only the
other day I saw a city councillor walking his
horse over a street-crossing (to set a good example,
I suppose) and when ho caught the admiring eye
of a traffic-director in the road, he leant out of
his trap and shook the poor man’s unwilling hand
as if it had been a doormat! But I thought it a
distinct waste of patronage, under the circum-
stances. It’s only when you’re breaking a bye-
law that this sort of cheap familiarity comes in.
In seeking out a culchawed sort of wind-mill to
tilt ac, a Melbourne “society” paper complains bit-
terly in the elegant language of the parlor-boarder
against “the custom of entirely disregarding in-
vitations or replying to them out of season—a cus-
tom that is eating away at the small heart of cul-
ture Australia possessess.” Of course that applies
to Melbourne, but I suppose maimers are the
same in Sydney, are they not ? If they are there’s
balm in Gilead and milk in the cocoa-nut. What
I mean is that “our” vice-royalties are past-
masters at the same game, and I am always most
willing and eager to believe that even the bad
manners which emanate from Govmentouso are
strictly Prince of Walesy.
Only the other day the secretary of a fashion-
able club sent an urgent note to the vice-regal
p.c., and, although it was an invitation for his Ex.
to go and gambol somewhere or other with the
club, no answer turned up. Too late for apologies,
the club secretary met the vice-regal pen-man and
taxed him with his neglect. “ Beg pardon, ’m
sure,” he responded, without turning a hair, “ but
Ai really forgot it, dontcherknow.” Melbourne
people who do likewise can at least point a con-
fident forefinger at Sydney Govmdntouse in ex-
tenuation of their social faults.
You’d imagine that, of all on earth, it
would be necessary for the ballet-dancer to keep
strictly sober while at work. But I was told the
other day of a not undistinguished example of the
strict contrary. She was the possessor of an
ineffably dainty figure, and always kept exquisite
time, never blundering a step, but she was usually
drunk as Chloe from her first entrance. A pecu-
liarity of hers (in Australia, at least) was that no
matter how “ elevated ” she might be before going
on, directly she got her music-cue and whirled on
to the stage she was instantly as sober as an owl.
The excitement took the place of an electric
shower-bath, I suppose. But, once in her dressing-
room, her potations got the upper hand again—
which explains quite a lot of amusing stories.
Two promising new musical compositions, issued
by W. H. Paling and Co., are the “Irene”
gavotte, dedicated to her Excellency of Banana-
land, and composed by W. A. Caflisch ; and
“Jack’s Toast,” a song by F. Burry. The
“ Irene ” gavotte is one of those dainty pizzicato
bits which remind the appreciative uncultured of
a cat crossing a wet pateh, and the gifted com-
poser has thoughtfully added fingering so a% to
prevent enthusiasts who don’t know from trying
to play it with their clenched fists, I presume.
“Jack’s Toast ” is a baritone sea-song, naturally
introducing the ladies, who are Jack’s toast, in
point of fact. After a careful hearing of the
chanty, one must come to the regrettable conclu-
sion that “Jack’s Toast and Water.” would have
made a more suitable title.
Talking of music, that clever and indefatigable
Australian composer, Maude Fitz-Stubbs, whose
“Heather” and “Orlando” waltzes have been
bought by a big London music-publisher, and
played by Dan Godfrey’s band, is leaving Sydney
for London, per Rome, next March. Miss Fitz-
Stubbs takes a number of new and clever compo-
sitions with her, wherewith to set Father Thames
on fire.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Sydney Telegraph begins to make" rude
remarks about the feeble and wobblesome Premier
Reid, and to speak kindly at times of its old
enemy, -Dibbs. In a recent par. it points
out that President Diaz is one of the greatest of
living statesmen, and then calls him the Dibbs of
Mexico, by way of emphasis. Something has
gone wrong with the works.
Ed. Bulletin, —Premier Turner’s biz.
could not be affected by the “landed gentry.”
The police-court branch under Sam. Lyons could
not be impaired, nor could the other, as the clients
are drawn from tradesmen, publicans and shop-
keepers. The firm is that of a middle-class plod-
ding attorney, worked up well by the Vic. Premier,
who uses the local friendly societies for all they
are worth as advts.—G.
The Sydney schooner Elsa, trading to the
South Seas, recently found at Vani Kori, the
scene of the wreck of the vessel which bore_ the
lost French explorer, La Perouse, some silver
coins, dated 1785, and a squarely-cut stone, which
looked like a tombstone, and bore an indistinct
inscription. These relics would be very precious
in France, where the mysterious fate of the dis-
tinguished navigator has taken strong hold of the
popular imagination.
Sydney Daily Telegraph last Tuesday
had a whoop about the N.S.W. sugar industry
If it were not for the present duty of £5 per ton sugar
oould be imported and sold at, say, £l2 per ton, instead
of £2l as at present. It is estimated that the Austra-
lasian production during the coming season will exceed
the consumption of 160,000 tons by fully 10,060 tons. The
importations from Mauritius reach 14,600 tons, and from
Java 40,000 tons per annum ; so that the prospect of a
glut of sugar and a large unexpertable surplus seems in-
evitable, which, coupled with the fact that the world’s mar-
kets are all in a similar condition, and are prepared to
supply us at half-price, leaves but one reasonable conclusion
as to thefate of our own insignificant industry. The amount
of duty paid last year for imported sugar was £544,233.
The total value of all the sugar yown in the.colony during
the same period is roughly put fit about £300,000, which
makes it appear as if the public were subscribing annually
about one-third of a million of money for the privilege of
owning a few acres of sugarcane, and a quarter of a mil-
lion for providing dividends for one monopolistic refining
company. With a free port for sugar at the present
moment, the finest sugar could be procured at about one-
half of what is now paid by retailers. In the English
counties the artisan can purchase his pound of sugar at
one penny. We, at the source of production, are asked
an advance of 150 per cent.
Now, in tiie first place, N.S. Wales last year paid*
not .£544,000 in duty on imported sugar, but only
.£144,000, so that there is here a wild discrepancy
of just <£400,000 which helps materially to make
up a case where none exists. Secondly, sugar was
quoted in Saturday’s Telegraph as low as .£l9
per ton, so that £2l i's the maximum price.
Third y, £5 duty, added to .£l2, makes £l7
not .£2l —in any case. Fourthly, if N.S.
Wales, as the Telegraph asserts, will this
season supply itself and have “ a glut and a large
unexportable surplus,” then it won’t pay any duty,
so that the wail about the alleged £544,000 paid
under the tariff is hopeless bosh, for the “colony ”
will straightway cease to pay anything. Also, the
glut will inevitably reduce prices, so that the wail
about the over-taxed consumer is also bosh.
Fifthly, the sugar that the English artisan gets
for Id. per lb. and that which costs 2£d. per lb.
in N.S. Wales are altogether different brands.
Sixthly, the last available Daily Chronicle
quotes sugar in London at .£l3 ss. to .£l6 per ton,
and as the freight and incidental charges, as
shown by the Telegraph, are over .£5 per ton, it
would appear that the finest protected Queensland
sugar, at .£2l, is cheaper than the finest imported
article would be even without any duty. A few
other discrepancies are held over until the next
time the D.T. makes a fool of itself on this topic.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
In England, M‘Laren being an amateur is
“Mister." With the Sydney orbwd he ia “ Archie.” In
one of-the matches on the Sydney ground, MSLaren was
fielding near the fence, and a Sky hit came towards him.
“ Alias it, Archie,” yelled one'of the crowd, “Mias it,
Archie, and vou cun kiss my sister.”
•‘* * *
Moses’ name being Jewish, many of the crowd
think the man is, too. Thus in Melbourne, when Moses
was going to make,a catch in the a Melbourne
barracker shouted, “Oh, Lord, it’s all up with Melbourne
—the ball’s going into the blooming synagogue 1”
* • * *
Crowds are partisans. When in Melbourne the
Vies, are in and a Sydney bowler is bowling on the off-
tiieory, the crowd, fearful that their batsmen will lash
out and get caught, keep up a fusillade from the fence.
“Bowl straight!” “Can’t you see the wicket?”
“ You’re a cock-eyed howler.” “Can’t hit a house if
you’re inside it,” &e., &o. But when the Sydney men are
in and the Vies, are playing “ off ” and failing to tempt
the wary batsmen, then comes a change of fire from the
ground crowd. “ Hit the ball !’’ “ Lay on.the wood like
Bruce does ! ” “ Why the devil don’t you try to score? ”
“ Isn’t it big enough? Would you like a pumpkin to hit
at?” &c., &c.

Adelaide experts consider Iredale the next Aus-
tralian - batsman to George Giffen. They lake his con-
fidence, ease, and elegance.
« * « •
Albert Trott will be 22 on Feb. 6.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
Giffen thinks that Lyons’ recent failures have
been chiefly caused by his attempts to play cautiously.
“ His game is to hit,” George says. Nothing w-ould please
S.A. better than to see Giant Jack put up a century
against the Englishmen.
, » » «
“Joe” Darling scored a duck-egg in a club
contest on Adelaide Oval on the Saturday after the last
test-match. A. E. Trott, too, playing against the Melb.
Club, failed to get a wicket, though more than 60 runs
were scored off him.
» * * ♦
Over £5OO Ims been collected for Geo. Giffen in
Adelaide.
* * * *
,A. E. Trott says the Englishmen lost the third
test-match chiefly through over-carefulness.
* * * *
The ( barracking Worrall received from the
Sydney crowdiwas not half as severe as that w-hich Lyons
had in Melbourne. Lyons let Iredale do a lot of his
fielding for him, and the many runs which resulled from
Lyons’ defectiveness may alone exclude him from the next
two test-matches.
* * * *
No selection committee oould allege against
Bathurst M'Kibbin what was pleaded against Iredale—
that he was physically unfit for the hurly-burly of an
English tour. M'Kibben rode 40 miles on Thursday,
travelled all night in the train, and paralysed the Vic-
torians on Friday.
« • ♦ *
Cricket cannot require the “staying power”
essential in other mamly games, else Garrett and Black-
ball), members of the first Australian Eleven which visited
England 17years ago, and who played for their respective
provinces on Saturday last, would long ago have been laid
on the shelf.
* * * *
In the N.S.W. —Yic. interprovincial match the
Vic. eleven reached only 181 in their fisrt innings, the
small score being greatly due to M’Kibhen, w ho took five
of their wickets for 36 runs. Several of the Victorians say
that M'Kibben’s fast ball is a decided throw.
Some 7000 people, on Anniversary Day, went to
Sydney Cricket Ground, and spent most of their time in
objurgating the drizzling rain and bitter wind. Not until
3 o’clock did play begin, and it closed before 5. Iredale
batted with splendid vigor, sending Ids score of 28 up to
86, and wdien his cuts and drives sped over the surface of
the field, and cut a thin, green track through the rain-
beaded grass, the crowd grew warm with enthusiasm.
But the ball, however, spent about half its time in the
sawdust, and while A. E. Trott or C. M'Leod would be
giving it a dry coat the crowd unmercifully barracked
Worrall. Worrall is reputed to have derided N.S.W.
players by stating that the Australian Eleven could be
formed without them. The Sydney crowd resented
this by deciding Worrall. Thus, wdien the firso hall bowled
was driven by Iredale »o the fence, fifty voices shouted :
“ How do you like t-hat, Worrall ?” “ Put Worrall on ! He
can play 1” “ Let Worrall bowl!” and so on during the
bare two hours of play. Moses was bow led for 1 by a
straight ball, wfilch deceived hinfin lire flight.
• • * •
Critics say that one or two of Iredale’s graceful
forward strokes would betray him most sadly on English
wickets. But they also say that the crack would soon
drop down to the peculiarities of the English grounds.
* * * ♦
Graham is studying dentistry, and spent con-
siderable money in securing a professional library when
last in England.
•*• , »
At one time it was thought that Gregory would
not have the heart for great things. But the fact is the
little man is all heart. Who can forget the day, in
England, when he scored 50 against Richardson, in an
All-England match, and got so badly knocked about the
legs by the fast bowler that he could not field afterwards ?
• * ♦ ♦
Donnan’s first innings of 40 in the match against
Victoria was made by sound, clean cricket. Mentioning
Dontian recalls the'insigniticant difference which occurred
in Melbourne, when this season's first match against Vic-
toria was played there. One day, at the close of play, as
umpires and players came in together, Donnon said to
Flynn, the Vic. umpire : “ You gave two decisions against
us.” And Flynn retorted : “ Yon ought to he umpire,
Donnan." Thus the quarrel began and ended. This is
what one Melb. paper raised’so frantic a hullabaloo about,
and what a Sydney daily went into hysterics over.
• * * *
Iredale has never bought a bat; all his bats have
come to him by presentation. Most of the time on Satur-
day he used a bat which was brought to him from Eng-
land by Alec. Bannerman. That savant selecti dit in the
shop of its maker, Wisden. With this bat, Iredale com-
menced this season’s play in the Sydney match against
the Englishmen on Nov. 23. He scored, in his first (linings
it, 133, and up to date has made off it a total of 613.
Last Saturday the w r et and heavy ball started the pegs
that had been driven into its face lo bind it, and
Iredale, anxious to preserve his trusty weapon for the
next test-match, came to the members’ pavilion and
changed it for another by the same maker. He made 13
runs with this new bat, which was presented to him by an
admirer, and was bought from the firm of Jaa. Martin and
Co., of Clarence-street, Sydney. Graham, when in Eng-
land, made 1242 runs with a Wisden bat, and Wisden
offered him the pick of his establishment. Graham
accepted the offer and chose what he considered the best
two or three.
• * * •
At one stage of the game, last Saturday, the
N.S.W. scoring-board read 2 for 102 ; Iredale, not out, 81;
later on it read 3 for 151; Iredale, out, 86. Iredale went
in first and made the pace.
* » * *
Perhaps the player who wears the heaviest pads
is Turner. On Anniversary Day Donnan put these pads
on by mistake, and, after running in them for a little
while, came back to the members’ pavilion and changed
them for a lighter pair. Iredale and Gregory prefer
skeleton pads.

J. E. MOORE, Acting Manager-
It is probable that Richarffson, on his native
heath, will be found as dangerous to the next Australian
Eleven as he was to the last one that went “home,” in
which case the difficulty of providing against the differ-
ence between English and Australian cricket conditions
will he generally understood. A supply of fast Australian
bowlers will not meet it, unless they can have slow
wickets to work upon— i.e., it would not much benefit
Australian batsmen to become accustomed to play howl-
ing similar to Richardson’s under circumstances which
make it much easier than in England. His very moderate
success here offers little or no encouragement to culti-
vate fast bowders, anyway. They don’t pay, for local
purposes. If we did cultivate them, and sent two of the
best specimens to England with a future team, they would
be less troublesome to the other side on average dull
wickets than the Britisher’s “ lightning deliveries” would
be to the Australians. Put the case this way. Sfoddart’s
team make only about 30 per cent, more runs, on an
average, against our men on hard Australian ground, than
they could score off the same bowling on a typical English
wicket, where Qiffen’s team woußl stand an excellent
chance of getting out for a 50 per cent, smaller total than
they are good for in their own country. If the two sides
are evenly matched here, the change to English con-
ditions, with Richaidson as an important item in the
calculation, must; in the present waiter’s ©pinion, dis-
count the Australians’ chance. Catapult bowling, with a
little bit of brains in it, will always stick up the Austra-
lians on the particular class of wicket—sound and true,
but slow—which they so seldom get in Australia.

Gov. Duff’s son may nob have the seat of a
Hales or a Kelso when finishing, but he gets there all the
same. On Saturday, he fairly out-generalled the amateurs
when he won on Towri. His three wins, on Towri and
Bodkin, are the more meritorious from the fact that some
of the best of local jockeys have been unable to win
when entrusted with mounts on the pair of speedy,
but uncertain brutes.

Carbine’s case recalls the wail that went up
when Barnum deprived England of the elephayit Jumbo.
The parallel may hold good to the last. Jumbo, as if he
wanted to cling to the soil from which the D.T. corres-
pondents cried he should not move, was only got on board
with difficulty. Now, judging by his antics before his
great races, there would be trouble in getting Master Jack
to step on to a ship.

Ganmain, engaged in the Newmarket at Bst., is
whispered about as a real “ cert.” He is a stable-com-
panion to Roseleaf, who won the Tooronga Handicap, at
Caulfield, by five lengths, carrying Bst. 71bs. in Imin.
15jsee. Roseleaf has ost. 61bs. in the Newmarket, and, as
Ganmain is said to be her equal at level weights, the
Newmarket is all over it rumor has much truth in it.

How is it that jumping horses last so much
longer than flat racers, and that in defiance of the terrible
knocking-about their legs receive, their heavy and

over longer distances than* their brothers of the “ legiti-
mate game " have to undertake?

The Derby winner, Harvester, is generally con-
sidered-the best-treated horse in the Australian Cup. As,
however, he did not run in Melb. Cup, no proper com-
parison of liis chance with older horses can be made. It
must'be remembered that Malachite, the Derby runner-
up, finished third-last in Melb. Cup with the feather of
6st. 121bs. up. On the whole, it is probable that the
three-year-olds this season are nothing out of the common.
Punters must not forget’that Carbine, as a three-year-old,
could not win the Australian Cup, in which he carried
exactly the same weight as Harvester has this year.

The real owner of a disappointing horse, who

Lillie Bridge (Sydney) proprietors might well
give trotting just one more chance. They have shown
conclusively that they will not stand any nonsense from
the trotting-horss people ; and the writer has it on good
authority that a trot for a fak stake would be rushed by
the owners, who are tired of inaction, and not likely to
resort to their old tricks—for a time at least.

Adelaide bookmakers naw act as tote commis-
sion agents, depositing the money received in the machine
and paying out the divs. received less Hperoent.com.
Israel Moses, however, retains all over 10 to 1; if
the machine pays £2O for every 10s. the bookie osly pays
out 10 to 1, thus clearing £l5 on the transaction. This is
a form of robbery made possible by the stupidity of the
authorities who refuse to run a ss. totaiisator, and conse-
quently the public on the flat, who bet in half-crowns and
five “ bobs.” are forced to wager through the “ commis-
sion agent” and submit to a double commission, in all 11A
per cent. Some bookmakers, under this new system, are
making more money ihan they did in the old days, and
take no risk whatever.

f From Pearson's Weekly (London), Deo. 1
Bicycle riders in Southland, Australia, are reciuired to
dismount iwenty-two yards from an approaching horse,
and draw their machine past.” Our contemporary is
slightly incorrect. The now historical case against the
champion bicyclist, Henry Parkes, at Christchurch (Q.),
where Sir George Qiflen, the presiding judge, inflicted a
hue of £5O for dismounting at a distance of 21 yards,
caused such an uproar that the obnoxious law was re-
pealed in the S.A. Legislature, mainly through the efforts
of Premier The Right Hon. Lord A. E. Trott, P.O.

Jhe fleet of Brisbane racing-boats that came to

The so-called ■“ umpire’s boat” at the Sydney
sailing-race on Saturday week was a snare and a delusion.
Hundreds paid extra fare, on the assumption that the
umpire was on board, and that, therefore, a good view of

crowded packet pu,t off, it was discovered that the umpire
was comfortably housed on a small launch.

The 22-feet boats interprovinoial championship
at Sydney Anniversary Regatta produced a great contest
between the Queenslander, Bulletin, and the Sydneyite,
Irex. There was a spanking southerly, and Irex led Bui-
lerin round Manly buoy by 12secs., hut once on a wind the
Bananalander showed her superiority, and at the Flag-
ship had limn. 31sees. to the good. Running to Fort
Denison Irex picked up lost ground, but it was the Bulle-

her chief rival.

superstitiously-inclined thought the latter’s time had
come on Saturday, but they won for the fourth time in

N.S. W. Minister for Works Young is

place at the top of the tree. 'Hitherto Harley
(engineer for harbors and rivers), Hickson (en-
gineer for roads and bridges), and Vernon (Govt,

poses to retire Vernon and Hickson from the
Board, make Harley chairman, and let Hickson
be engineer for harbors and rivers as well as for
his present department. Naturally the pluralists
don t like it j but they have wisely decided to grin

Railway Commissioner Eddy, writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent, has to
some extent been made a oatspaw of by a
band of people who are dissatisfied with the
management of the South - Eastern railway,
especially with regard to the war which has for so
long been waged with its rival, the London,
Chatham and Hover, and which arose prin-
cipally from the competition for the conti-
nental traMjp. Mr. Eddy seems to have allowed
himself to be the nominee of this clique. Sir
Edward Watkin having retired, everything points
to a better understanding between the two
companies. Undoubtedly Mr. Eddy’s manage-
ment of the N.S. Wales railways has enor-
mously enhanced his reputation as a railway man
with the English public, and he would have a
strong following if it came to a vote. But
railway shareholders are a conservative lot,
and are always disposed to support directors, who
are generally so heavily armed with proxies that
they can carry whatever they make a vital ques-
tion. Besides, radical changes are not approved
of in railway management, and, therefore, if Mr.
Eddy chose to submit himself to the ordeal of the
ballot, he would find a very solid vote against him.
His election, should he happen to be successful,
would undoubtedly lead to the resignation of Sir
Myles Fenton, who has long been the manager of
the co., and who, failing any swell shareholder as
a candidate, would naturally look to the chair-
manship as his legitimate promotion.

A Melbourne suburban tobacconist has for
weeks past been doing a roaring business in imported
cigars, which he advertised as “Smuggled Cavitas at six
a shilling.” Although the goods had paid duty in the
ordinary way, the whole lot was seized by the Customs,
confiscated, and the tobacconist fined treble their value
under the Act which (perhaps very properly) treats a
vendor, who falsely' represents his wares as smuggled,
precisely the same as if the goods had actually cheated
the revenue.
Which reminds the writer that about six months
ago he bought a small keg of “ real, genuine Jamaica
from a mysterious stranger who had, so he said, got it
off his vessel in the Bay. The sample which the smuggler
then and there drew from the keg was undoubtedly At
stuff, and the five-gallon keg was bought for 16s. 6d. A
further thimbleful of rum and 4J gallons of water were all
that keg subsequently panned out, _ A tiny tube of rum
was tacked over the hole from which the ‘ smuggler
drew the rum, and the remaining vacuum was filled witn
water. The riling thing is that the “smuggler knows
that the unfortunate writer can’t squeal, as he had fully
intended to “do” the revenue. The “rum merchant
is now, no doubt, successfully playing the plugged-Dutch-
cheese racket at remunerative rates-viz., 3s. od. for flu.
of artistically-painted cement representing a round cheese
and a 40z.-phig of delicious cheese inserted in the hole
from whicli the buyer gets a tasting sample.

When London becomes a desert and a waste
place, and a region where the pelican builds his nest, the
city region will make a reasonably good goldfield, and
claims pegged in Lombard-street and Leadenhall-street
will yield decent returns. It has been proved by careful
prospecting that the city mud has become auriferous
through long centuries of wear and tear of the coinage in
money-changing, and gold and silver are both present in
appreciable quantities. They can also be found in the
West End, but in the poorer regions of the East End the
most careful prospecting yielded not even a color. A
sovereign never remains there long enough to get worn
The Austin Gold-mines, Ltd., have purchased
the Evening Star claim adjoining their property on the
Island, Lake Austin, W.A. The amalgamation of these
claims, with a solitary autocrat at the head of affairs,
should turn out well for all concerned, as some of the
richest ore shoots found on the Island have been in the
Evening Star claim. In addition to the battery a 2000-ton
cyanide plant is to be erected to treat the tailings—as
well as to sift a large concrete formation going over half
an ounce per ton —after dry crushing in an Otis mill.*
The Golden Bar Gold-mining Company, Cool-
gardie, are making quite a departure from ordinary
mining practice by the method, recently adopted, of
treating their ores. They are now erecting a dry crush-
ing-plant (Bald mill)from which the ore will be treated in
Allan's amalgamating pans, and will thence pass into the
cyanide vats. The results will he looked for with con-
siderable interest. The plant is being erected by the Otis
Engineering Company, of M' Ibourne, the inventors of
the system.*

and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alfaline
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alfaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative
'>f the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose
testimony carries special weight, writes thus :
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, I think it my duty to inform you
that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills
acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all lieen cured by
their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness
and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform
you that a course of your Alfaline Pills com-
pletely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you
are deserving of success, which I do most
heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,
A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having
been a sufferer from General Debility of the
Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the
leading doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne,
I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses
of the Alfaline Remedies I am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I
was. Thanking you for your courtesy and
the uniform patience with which you have
treated me, allow me to say that you can
make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours, CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great l eneflt my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger s Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her tothe
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended 1 Benger's
Food.' From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength."
"If every mother knew of
its value no other would be
used."
IMPRISONED ON A SHIP.
The steamship Normannia, from Hamburg,
arrived in the port of New York on Saturday,
Sept. 3rd, 1892, with cases of cholera on board.
Many of the ship’s company had died on the pas-
sage. At Hamburg and elsewhere in Europe the
disease was raging. The authorities in America
were alarmed lest the scourge should be introduced
into that country. Hence they quarantined the
Normannia, with every soul of her passengers and
crew. The writer was a passenger. It was an
awful time. Death was among us and on all
sides of us. Nobody knew who next would fall.
We were imprisoned. Liberty never seemed so
fair, nor so far. We could neither fight nor fly.
There we were—hundreds of us— perfectly well,
and yet bound together as with chains, that the
health officer of the port might see whether the
plague would not yet break out in our midst.
When at last —after weeks of this —we were set on
shore, men lifted their hats and reverently said,
“ Thank God I ”
This was being shut up under conditions to
make it horrible and fearful. Yet, any form of
incarceration is bad enough. Here is a woman,
for example, who says, “ I never moved a yard
from my own doorstep for twenty weeks t ” Her own
house was a prison to her. Who had sentenced
her? A judge? No; a power greater and more
pitiless than any judge.
Her tale runs thus : In April, 1882, whilst living
at Lasher’s Farm, Old Sampford, Essex, a fire
broke out, and the family were burned out of
house and home. We have no call to remark on
such a calamity. The very thought of it is fit to
make one shiver with dread. For most of us it is
like the world coming to an end to experience such
a disaster.
Well, what happened after that the lady shall
tell in her own fashion—the best of all fashions,
because it is plain and straight to the point. She
says: “ Owing to our bedding being damp from
exposure, I took a bad cold, which brought on
rheumatic fever. For fourteen days I was con-
fined to my bed, and for twenty weeks I never
moved a yard from my own doorstep. After a
time the fever abated, leaving me weak, languid
and low. At first I had a sickening taste in the
mouth, and a poor appetite. No matter how
simple and light the food was, I was afraid to eat,
for it was sure to give me pain at the chest and
sides ; so I often had to loosen my corset and un-
dress myself during the day. I could not bear the
weight of my clothing.
“I was constantly spitting_up a sour, frothy
fluid, and had a gnawing pain at the pit of the
stomach —like hunger, and yet different. _ It was
with difficulty I voided the kidney secretion, and
my bowels, ankles and legs began to swell. I got
worse ; I was in agony night and day, and could
not put my foot on the ground. Soon afterwards,
a husky cough took me, and my throat filled with
a thick phlegm. I could not sleep, and was never
easy. Later on, I had often to sit up in bed, for I
felt as if I should choke.
“ Year after year I continued to suffer in this
way, growing worse and worse, until I despaired
• f ever being well again. But who can tell when
t .miil£ will come, or when relief? A wonderful
Providence is over all.
“One day in June, a book came by post de-
scribing Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup and what
it had done for many poor sufferers. I got a
bottle from Mr. Suckling, medicine dealer, and
after taking it for a short time all pain left me,
and I gradually gained strength. By taking an
occasional dose I have since kept in good health,
and can eat and digest any kind of food. (Signed)
Mrs. Lydia Green, Moor End, Great Sampford,
via Braintree, Essex, Aug. 24th, 1892.”
Now, in order that Mrs. Green’s clear and
truthful statement may be of use to others (as
she desires it to be), we must add a word or two.
The bad cold she caught at the fire no doubt
“brought on” the rheumatic fever (as she
relates), but there was something back of the
cold, for a cold never causes rheumatism. The
rheumatic seeds, or poison, must already lie in
the blood ; and that poison is always created by
pre-existing indigestion and dyspepsia, whether
the sufferer knows it or not. This is proved by
the fact that Mrs. Green’s chief ailment for ten
years after the fire was not rheumatism, but
indigestion and dyspepsia and dropsy, which is
one of its results and symptoms. When the
digestion was finally righted by the remedy she
alludes to, all her apparent maladies ceased
together. Why ? Because she had but one, as we
have said.
Ah, yes, Disease is a stern gaoler. And how
sweet (and cheap) is liberty, obtained by Mother
Seigel’s help.
A Maryboro’ (Q.) medico :—“ Cancer is
extremely common among cattle in this district.
Cancer is also more prevalent in this district
among human beings than in any other part of
Queensland.”
Messrs. Frost and Shipham,' of George-
streeb, Sydney, have acquired the Australian
rights of a new invention called the “ hygienic
ear-pad for the telephone.” Telephones are used
by all sorts of persons, many of them unhealthy.
Each person who uses the instrument presses the
pad to his ear, and leaves upon it the signs of his
presence in the shape of perspiration and microbes.
When a telephone-receiver has been in use for
some time analysis of the accumulated deposit
furnishes an interesting essay on disease and the
methods by which it is communicated. The
hygienic ear-pad, which fits on to the receiver, is
specially designed to meet this unwholesome diffi-
culty. It is composed of many layers pf white
material, so that whenever the topmost layer
shows signs of depreciation it can be torn off and
a clean surface obtained ; and it is prepared with
an antiseptic compound which prevents infection.
The pad also improves the efficiency of the instru-
ment by excluding outward noises, and thus
makes the telephone considerably more service-
able.
Hazell’s Annual for ’95 makes the tenth
issue of that popular work, and is a great im-
provement on its predecessors. It contains in a
condensed form the doings of the world for the
past year; biographies of men who have recently
come to the front by their own exertions, or been
shoved to the front by circumstances ; an account
of the year’s discoveries in all branches of know-
ledge ; and a general report of things that have
happened, and of things that should have hap-
pened, but didn’t. The new articles in the present
edition deal with anarchism, Arctic exploration,
astronomy, new baronets, knights, peers, C.M.G.’s,
and the like; new books, theology, Corea, the
China-Jap. war, divorce, geology, canals, bullet-
proof cuirasses, law, cholera, hypnotism, explora-
tion and several dozen other subjects. Also, it
serves the purpose of a small, condensed, bub
exceedingly complete, cyclopaedia of all modern
things, persons and circumstances, and_ all the
recent history of the world is to be found in its 716
pages. For its size, Hazkll’s Annual contains
more varied and up-to-date knowledge than any
other work The Bulletin knows of.
Looking over the list of winners on the
racecourses, on the cricket-field, and at all the
sports during the holidays, one is astonished to
find that all the successful men are smokers.
Still, you hear it said that smoking is injurious
and weakens the nerves; and those who think so
are quite correct to a certain extent. No doubt
heavy smoking of tobacco containing deleterious
compounds would weaken the nerves of a giant,
but consult a few of the gentlemen mentioned
above, and you will find that almost without
exception they are lovers of the one cigar of the
age, viz., Frossard’s Cavour cigars, which, being
mild and fragrant, are a treat to smoke. They
have all the pleasant flavor of the 'excellent leaf
from which they are prepared, without the un-
pleasant taste of the nicotine, which, having been
extracted in vacuo, leaves the smoker the essential
aromatic flavor of the tobacco. If you do nob
already smoke, then clo not hesitate, but try them
once, and you will smoke them always. Fros-
sard’s Cavour cigars are sold everywhere in
packets of eight for Is.

“We live in an age when only unneces-
sary things are absolutely necessary to us.”—
Oscar Wilde.
Some Melb. Hansard men talk of illus-
trating their copy by Kodak. In this way they
think it would be easier to set forth the meanings
of ex-Premier Patterson, who finishes about a
third of his sentences with wild gesticulation.
“ The expenditure on the funeral of Alexander 111. is
said to have reached the sum of a million sterling.”
“ Jump in,” said Charon to the Czar.
“ Across the Styx—my price is nix—
With other folk I’ll ferry you.
Methinka you dunno where you arc —
But drop your airs, here no one cares
How much it cost to bury you.”
Dear Bulletin, —A tight-place. Away
back in ’69, Bob Williamson, carrier, and his
boy were riding from Gilberton to Townsville.
At the Broken River they camped for the night,
making their fire at the foot of a big gum-tree
which was partly hollow. Before midnight the
tree burnt through, falling on both, killing the
black boy, and pinning Williamson by the legs,
one of which was broken above the ankle. There
the carrier lay with the tree slowly burning
towards him until 11 a.m. next day, when some
teamsters came along and released him. By then,
the fire had come close enough to singe his
trousers and blister his legs and arms. William-
son'now lives at Windsor, Vic. —B. the 8., Nor-
man ton, Dec. 26, ’94.
Sydney Domain, Sunday. Young Snuffle-
buster loq.: “ Look at me, a brand plucked from
Sitan’s clutches—(a trifle is asked to assist the
good work)—Were, hi hask, was hi to be found a
year ago on the Board’s ’oly Day ? Wy, in the
fiush, a headin’ of ’em, a playin’ two-hup. A
throwin’ hup of my crowns, and a watchin’ ’em
cornin’ down. A tossin’ an’ a pitchin’ along o’
my wicked terbacker-chewin’ companyuns—
(Throw it in, friends ; its all in the Ma-aster’s
service. Glory-be-to God ! Another shillin’ !
Thank-YOU-sir.)—But were ham hi to be found
now of a Sunday ? Wy, a praisin’ the Board,
along with my dear young friends ’ere ” —(looking
round with an evil and unctuous grin at the ring
of fresh, young, hymn-book-holding maidens) —
“not in the bush, playin’ two hup, but ’ere, doin’
the Ma-aster’s work. Still •” “ Heading
them,” quickly interjected a vigorous-looking
hearer, pointing to the red banner, dotted with
silver coin, over which the orator kept a watchful
eye. Here, the evangelist seeming a little flabber-
gasted, the band struck up “ Waiting for the
Master,” and the obvious moral was lost amid the
braying of trumpets and the banging of drums.

Said the little red-bearded man with the
bandy legs : “Now, that’s a horse as you oidy get
the chance of buying, at a bargain, once in a life-
time.” The new-ohum looked at him doubtfully ;
he knew he was a new-chum, but didn’t want
other people to know it, so a bright idea came into
his head, and he did what somebody once told
him was the right thing to do when purchasing a
horse : he ran his hand down the tendons of the
steed’s fore-leg, and—whistled softly. The little
man went jumping-mad immediately. “Here’s
the finest (fashionable oath) horse in the (fashion-
able) universe, and a (fashionable) new chum
wants to make out he’s screwed.” The new-chum
was staggered at the outburst; still, he felt
he must carry his instructions through to
the end, so he said, “111 give you pounds
for him,” naming half the sum asked. “You’ll
give me blank pounds for him, will you ? Ft r a
horse like that ! Well, dammee if I don’t take it,
just to show you what a fashionable fool you are.
When you’ve had him four-and-twenty hours
you’ll come after me begging me to take the
balance; and I won’t take it; there now.”
They went into the bar, and the little red-bearded
man wrote out a receipt. The new-ohum still
followed out his instructions by asking him to
have a drink, to which the little horse-dealer
assented. “Now,” he said, as he prepared to
start, “ You’re no fashionable new-chum ; you’ve
got that horse at his true value, what did you put
on side for?” “My dear sir,” returned the other,
“I bought him because he had such a nice tail.”
“ Sold again,” said the little man.


A BIG BIZ!
Our Trade is Big! Our Store is Big I
Our Ideas are Big!
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger tlian on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow ?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us! All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s.real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being ganged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our
Catalogue and Patterns of anything you require ;
if in town, call every day.

PUMPS * Pumping Machinery.
EDSON’S
Diaphragm Free Pump,
With Side or Bottom Inlet.
This Pump is designed for use in
Ships, Sewers, Cesspools, Pumping
from Water-holes on Stations, Irri-
gating, and all places where a good,
low-priced, large, easy-working and
durable pump is required. It is com-
pact, strong, simple and effective. It
has simple valves, without the usual
working box in a cylinder. There is
but little wear, tear or friction. It is
double-acting in its delivery, giving a
steady stream. In short, it is the
cheapest and best free pump ever con-
ceived for the service designed. For
verification we refer to any or all the
parties having them in use.
A Boy can pump 3000 gallons per hour
with one of these Pumps.
These pumps are operated usually
by hand with a long iron handle,
which is supplied, but they can be
operated by steam or wind-power very
nicely in pairs, and for Irrigation,
where no forcing is necessary, no
better arrangement of pumping could
be made.

Ed. Bulletin, —Re tight places. In the
summer of ’BB I was with old Lippy Cue and his
blackboy, travelling vyth a mob of cattle from
Bulloomeyabber, on the Bandicoot, to Borandoran
on the Jogalight. Lying under a tree one very
hot day I fell asleep, with my arms spread out; I
awoke with a feeling of suffocation, and to my
horror found that a huge carpet-snake had swal-
lowed me feet-foreraost right up to the armpits,
and, being unable to get me any further down his
throat, the brute was making off with me as fast
as he could. I roared like a bull, which brought
old Lippy to my assistance. With an axe he
managed to cut off about 16ft. of the reptile ; then
with his sheath-knife he liberated me from my
prison. The snake measured 34ft. 10|in. —W.

A beautiful mixture of religion and biz. is
a pamphlet just to hand, issued by a firm of
optical-instrument makers, and entitled “ The
Gospel Lantern Mission, the greatest soul-winning
work of the age.” “No power was ever so great ”
(as our lantern) “to draw people to Christ. We
have had no quarrels in our church since we bought
our lantern.” “ The street singing at your lantern
service has won me to Christ.” “ Our minister is
sharp—he saw the advantages of lantern work.
We took .£7O in one evening. It is a great help
in the good work.” Alas, the day is coming when
church walls will advertise variety shows ; when
the text will read “Clothe the Naked —with our
50s. suits when the preacher will denounce (and
advertise) M'Glue whisky: “ Beware of M‘Glue,
my friends, it is tempting; but it is a fiery demon.
It is far cheaper than other brands, and, there-
fore, the more are ye likely to be led astray.
Oh, beware of M‘Glue, beloved brethren.” Then
the Bibles and hymn-books will be interleaved in
re the New Liver Pill, and “ Give us this day our
daily bread,” will be used to glorify Jones’ butter
from the Gong Gong Creamery.

In a Barber’s Chair .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The curses of the barber’s life, sir,” said the
operator, as he held me fast by the nose, “are
lads, chestnuts, and parsons. Every man has a
lad and every man saves it to show it off upon
las barber. One customer won’t have our brushes
used upon las hair—fancies they are used anyhow,
like a shoeblack s. Another customer, who dyes
las hair, won’t use our dye—he says he makes his
own, at a cost of sixpence a gallon. That man
came in one morning with the skin off one side of
his face, where the home-made dye had run down.
About one out of a dozen customers growing grey
get hair-dye from us. It’s not all mere vanity, for
a man often loses his billet if he gets grey now-a-
days.
About 19 out of 20 fight against baldness, by
buying hair washes, and so on, from us. flair-
washes ! No good at all, sir—might as well try to
make mulga-bushes grow on their heads. Then
we have one gentleman who won’t look in the
glass he s the only man like that I ever came
across in 20 years’ experience. Most of our
customers enjoy looking in the glass-nearly all
of em keep their chins so low down, on purpose to
see themselves, that we find it very hard to shave
them. But this gentleman, sir, who hates the
glass, has his chair reversed, so that he shall face
the wall. He s a bit mad. A doctor who comes
here regularly tells us he’s only eccentric; but
he’ll go there all right in time.
“No two men have their hair cut alike, sir.
One wants it long over his ears, and another has
it shaved there ; another has it shaved at the back,
and keeps a long top-knot in front to brush up
like a rooster’s ; another has it clipped to the skull
on top, but wants plenty of nap on the back so as
to keep his bump of amativeness warm. Perhaps
one out of four men sits down and lets the barber
cut his hair without comment or interference.
But then, sir, even, he’ll have his fad in shaving
or beard-trimming, and we do 12 shaves for one
hair cut.
“Three men out of ten won’t be shaved against
the grain. One customer always brings his own
towel, and fixes it himself about his neck. Strange
to say, he doesn’t keep a shaving-pot and brush
here; but then only one regular customer out of
10 does. Another regular won’t have water used
upon his face after shaving ; he just wipes the
soap off with a dry towel, pours some oil on his
hair, brushes it himself, pays, and goes. Oil, sir 1
we don’t use much in good shops—a four-ounce
bottle lasts me a fortnight; in a cheap shop you’d
use forty ounces in the time.
“We always wash the shaving-pot and brush
for each new customer, but one customer’s fad is
not to let us do that. While I am brushing the
last customer s coat, he slips into the chair and
lathers himself with the brush, soap, and water
that have just been used on the last man. It’s not
that he’s in a hurry, sir, like most of our cus-
tomers, who are business men ; on the contrary,
he’ll stop an hour but what he’ll have every sprig
cleaned off. It’s his fad, sir ! just his fad. About
one-third of our customers sit down in the chair
with an air of ‘ I’m in for a comfortable loaf.’
“Most men prefer bay-rum to powder after
shaving, but more men than not will have powder
used as well as bay-rum. And, with regard to
fads, I can say that no man knows what a fad is
until he’s gone in for beard-trimming. We give
our customers a hand-glass to go into details with,
while Hie big mirror in front shows them the whole
picture. It s ‘ Here ! here ! here ! There ! there !
there ! Oh ! oh ! steady ! oh ! Don’t ! Damn
it!’ It’s a trying job, sir, when a cronk-faced
man with a cronk beard swears at you because
you can t make him full-faced and handsome.
“Chestnuts! We hear every new story 100
sir, and not one man in 100 can tell it.
And gossip, sir ! If you knew the gossip the
barber hears it would raise your hair. I know
your profession, sir, your favorite restaurant and
favorite dish. See the gentleman behind, sir? A
dozen of my customers have told me about him.
I know how many sisters he has, and brothers;
what disease his father died of ; and what woman
he’s sweet on. The barber’s shop is the school for
scandal, and by degrees we get a true or false
account of every one of our customers from one
another. It’s this way, sir. I’ll be shaving a
gentleman and he’ll say to me, ‘ See the johnny in
the third chair from here?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ I’ll say.
‘ He gets -£l5O a year and does the grand at races,
theatres, billiards, &c. ; d dif 1 know how he
does it; I get twice as much as he does, but I
can’t go his pace.’ Then we are given the
spicy bits of evidence that the court hears with
closed doors ; we can only rely on getting that in
this shop, sir. We hear what barrister or solicitor
is mashed on an actress or music-hall beauty. Our
customers, too, know all about sport, horse-racing,
cricket, football, and the rest; they lay down the
law, and foretell sure winners with great
authority. We get tips from customers for every
sporting event. Oh, yes, we had enough of the
first test-match; even the few priests who
patronise us talked about that.
“Priests behave very differently from parsons
in the barber’s chair. Priests never mention
religious matters at all; they converse freely
enough about such ordinary topics as a priest can
speak on with propriety talk cricket, for
instance. But parsons, sir ! we have a prize one
coming here. He comes here to get his hair cut
and his beard trimmed, because his wife has a
baby and can’t do it now. Nobody can cut hair
but his missus. ‘ Ah,’ he says, ‘ you can’t do it as
nicely as my wife.’ And all' the time I’m clipping
at him, sir, it’s God ! God ! God ! and God is
a name which, when canted about in that
style, the world has grown tired of. You
mustn’t notice my religious opinions, sir, for I
haven’t any ; my religion is that when God made
the world the Devil laughed.”
That’s it 1 -; verbatim, as far as I can remember ;
and all for sixpence, with a shave thrown in !

There are many exciting episodes in the
life of a Queensland pressman. One of the literary
brotherhood who earned his humble crust in a
coast-town lately made his usual evening call at
the police-station to inquire for news. He was an
amateur wrestler, and so was the officer on duty,
so, after having a drink and swapping lies, they
started a friendly rough-and-tumble. Just when
they were both rolling on the floor, the inspector
stalked in. “ Who’s this ?” he demanded sourly.
“A ferocious and devastating dhrunk, sorr,” said
the startled policeman : “ I’m just securing him,
sorr.” The inspector promptly got on top of the
pressman, and between them he was “secured”
and thrown into a cell. By-and-bye, when the
coast was clear, the policeman went to the cell
and found his friend purple with indignation and
trying to kick the door down. “ I’m sorry to
have had to arrest yez,” he said apologetically,
“ but now that yer in and I’m on juty ye’ve got to
stop that noise.” Then there was a sudden assault,
and the row brought the inspector on the scene a
second time. “ What’s this row ?” he demanded
tersely. “ It’s the same prisoner, sorr,” said
the officer, “securing” his captive a second
time, “he’s gone ravin’ mad.” Then there was
peace for a few minutes more till the coast was
clear, when the officer turned up stealthily with a
bottle of beer and suggestions for a treaty. “If
ye’ll keep quiet,” he said, solemnly, “I’ll put
down yer name as Smith, an’ I’ll get ye bailed
out, an’ I’ll get someone to answer yer name in the
mornin’ and I’ll pay the fine.” Then they drank
thebeer together, and next morning a shock-headed
person of no account answered to the name of
Smith by previous arrangement, and was fined the
usual 10s.
Editor Bulletin. Some day, one of
the finest steamboat accidents on record will
take place on the N.Q. coast. North Queens-
land is the place where everything that is
condemned and accursed goes, where the
glaring sun looks down on poverty and ill-luck
and disaster, on worked-out goldfields, Chinamen,
niggers, flies, misery, dead-and-gone boom towns,
silted-up harbors, snakes, cockroaches, curses,
decaying populations, premature old age, blight,
hopeless mortgages, and all ma.mer of evil things.
All the old steamers which have been forgotten
on southern shores go up there and plod deso-
lately about its forlorn coast. All the old captains
who have fallen into disrepute drift up there also.
Half the time the old steamer is mostly manned
by a depressed variety of beach-comber escaping
from the dismal hell of North Queensland. These
individuals, as a rule, never appear on the ship’s
articles, and when one of them some day or other
steers a big boat to utter wreck, the insurance co.
will decline to pay up for the smash wrought by
the destructive amateur. Discipline on board a
cargo-boat prowling around the remoter parts
of the N.Q. coast is a remarkable affair. Gener-
ally the lights are hung out at night, but some-
times they aren’t. Very often, on a dark night,
there is no one in sight on deck save the man at the
wheel; the officer in charge, the watch, and the
look-out are all asleep and invisible. Sometimes
the steersman also takes short naps, hanging over
the wheel, and then till he wakes the vessel
thunders along and takes care of itself. They
don’t mind these little things much in the Far
North —in fact, they don’t mind anything very much
up there. Nobody is more than half alive in tropical
Queensland. Nobody expects anything very
definitely, except to make “tucker” and boots.
Nobody hopes for anything except to get away,
and up beyond Cooktown it is an understood
thing now that it takes eight years to accumulate
the passage-money to Sydney. When once a man
gets into the Gulf country, unless he is content
to hang his only pair of boots over his
shoulders, and march straight southward along
the sand-track, and never stop till he gets to
Sydney, he can count on spending the best years
of his life there, saving up the money to get away
with. Half the prospectors who invade the Far
North never get away at all; the fatalism of the
accursed land gets hold of them, and they either
flicker away the rest of their lives in pottering
around after elusive gold, or else go and live with
the blacks. The eternal rains and shadows of the
scrub country bleach them a sickly white, like
Gehazi the leper, and they run wild like the local
cassowary; and the old men who have, outlined
their other delusions mostly have a vague idea
that some day they will get away to their heaven,
which is Cooktown, and that someone there will
trust them with a week’s board and lodging, and
that they will get drunk. But very few of them
do. And a country where a man’s highest ambi-
tion is to get to Cooktown is a pitiful place,
anyhow.—T.S.
Dear Bulletin, —Do newspapers take
civil servants’ screed because it is cheap ? I
doubt it. “ Spagnoletti ”is not consistent. He
argues on the cheap theory, and at the same time
quotes a subdised pressman’s earnings at <£3 a
week. No civil servants' stuff is cheap at that
price. Many State employes contribute articles
of special character, and are paid specially high
rates. They, being specialists, really compete
with no one. Finally, I know two instances in
which civil servants ceased contributing as soon
as their bills were cut down below current rates. —

COOL—FOR BOURKE.
“ The weather was what is called cool for Bourke."-
Sydney D.T. travelling reporter.
What? The weather? Well, the weather,
If you take it altogether,
Was a thing a salamander wouldn’t shirk,
There are hotter times in Sheol
For a white man or a Creole ;
It was what you might call middling cool—for
Bourke !
P’r’aps you know the sort the plight is
When you’re stewing-up pyrites
With the choking fumes of sulphur all at work ;
Well, the weather was like that is,
Mixing dust where melting fat is.
So you know that it was middling cool —for
Bourke!
The thermometers recorded
That the cool the shade afforded
Was a trifle o’er a hundred and a jerk ;
Which was icily amazing
With one-fifty “in the blazing”—
On the whole, you see, ’twas middling cool—for
Bourke!
We could grill our chops by sunlight
(That is, those who like ’em done light),
But the dust it made a curtain, like, of murk;
And we had to, willy nilly,
Use a lens to “ boil the billy,”
So you’ll see that it was really cool—for Bourke!

The Monkey or the Man ?
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He was the outcome of generations of
crime; a degrader of women, a thief, liar, and
betrayer of “ pals a thing to which nothing was
sacred and the meaning of “friend” unknown.
Eor one of many murders he was condemned and
hung.
In his interview with the Devil, he preserved a
jaunty and defiant air, as though to say : “Now
you’ve got me—well ?”
The Devil smiled —his own peculiar twister.
“ Send you to hell ?” he said. “ Yes, I’m going
to, but not my hell —it’s not hot enough. Man
you shall be again—yet not man. Wfeu —ugh !”
And the whiff of fiery breath forced the man
upwards to earth, into the wilds of a forest in
Borneo.
* * *
The maternal orang-outang had reared
many young ones, but her seventh surpassed them
all in cunning and devilry. He speedily became
the terror of the ape-world, but to its joy he was
early captured and sold to the manager of a great
circus.
This man could make nothing of his purchase ;
for months the creature sulked and starved, until,
repenting of his bargain, the manager contem-
plated selling it again.
Then came the new lady rider, really pretty
under her paint, vivacious, young and charming.
“ Poor creature, ” she said in genuine pity, “it
looks so miserable and cold. See, it shivers !”
“Pure cussedness,” laughed the gentleman
rider, who stood beside her ; “ trust a monkey to
trick you if he can. ”
“ It’s not only the monkeys can do that, she
retorted. The man drew back with an angry
flush ; the ape grinned. .
“It’s positively laughing,” she cried. ‘I like
it, I do indeed. I’ll adopt and train it,’’unfasten-
ing the cage as she spoke.
“ You’re mad !” shouted the man, striving to
close the door. In the scuffle the ape escaped.
Instead of using his freedom the brute clutched
Miss Madeline’s dress, and cowered beside her,
his little, deep-set eyes twinkling up at hers,
violet and soft with pity.
The man strode towards them; the ape showed
his fangs in silent menace.
“Don’t touch him,” she ordered, dropping her
soft fingers upon the bristly head. “Kindness is
the only cure for him.”
After that the orang-outang went by the name
of “ Miss Madeline’s Man,” and the rider who
coveted that title ground his teeth in futile ex-
pression of the jealous hatred he bore the dumb
brute.
The fame of the girls power over the ape
4 vmght crowds to the show nightly, and marvel-
lous feats were performed by the two.
Even the riding with the man was a small affair
in comparison ; and it was noticeable that during
this the ape tugged' at his chain in frantic
endeavour to be free, and watched her every move-
ment with all but human interest.
Then, in turn, the man would stand with folded
arms and lowering brow while the girl and the ape
iterformed ; at each touch of the hairy hands upon
her person loathing and resentment showed in
every line of his face.
The man was a clever rider, accustomed to leap
from the ground to the bare back of a galloping
horse and maintain his balance without using his
On one occasion the ape squatted on his haunches
beside the ringj unchained, in readiness for his own
performance with Miss Madeline.
As the man made his rush to mount the gallop-
ing horse, the ape screamed shrilly, arresting his
attention and baulking the leap. The crowd jeered,
Again the man attempted the feat, landing suc-
cessfully upon the bare rump, but slipping back
immediately. The delighted spectators hooted
and yelled,
The ape joined his derisive cries to theirs, and
the infuriated man, bailing up the blameless
horse, cut it smartly over the face with his riding-
whip. Then the frightened beast fairly flew round
the ring, and, with the increased speed, the man
found less difficulty in remaining upright and
triumphant upon its back after his next leap,
The crowd cheered now, but the ape, grim and
silent, crouched against the flapping calico, and,
as the horse came past him, sprang upon its
haunches and seized the man by the ankles,
dragging him with terrible force to the ground,
where he lay stunned and unconscious,
The knockabouts rushed upon the ape with
picks and mauls, but before they could harm him
Miss Madeline, in tights and spangles, had thrown
herself between her pet and his danger. With an
arm around his thick neck she led him away. Ihe
crowd cheered anew—their sympathy was with
the monkey, not the man.
After that the rider, loving the girl desperately,
kept his distance from the ape, watching his
opportunity for vengeance. She, knowing this,
kept the brute beside her always, as much to
tantalise the man as to protect the ape.
Meantime the show travelled far.
r U P° n one still moonlight night, after the per-
formance, when the heat had driven everyone out
of doors rather than into stuffy bedrooms, Miss
Madeline and the rider strolled to the outskirts of
the village in which the tents were pitched,
Though she would not marry him, she liked to
draw him on, to incite him to fresh pleading, to
hold him still her own. .
They had forgotten the ape, which had sneaked
out behind them and noiselessly followed within
hearing, creeping in the shadows out of sight,
Presently they leaned upon a fence-rail and
looked out over the moonlit country. She turned
her head at the touch of his hand upon hers,
“I* do that again I shall go back she
said. As I have often told you, you may look,
but you mustn’t touch.” _
He was in no mood for jests.
“Yet you let that brown devil paw you,” ho
retorted rudely.
‘ It would be well if you were to take a lesson
in manners from that brown gentleman, she
mocked.
The ape came closer, his gimlet eyes dancing as
though he understood her words.
“ I believe you love the brute he said bitterly.
“ Oh, no, I love the monkey, I have no feeling
for the brute ! ” she sneered, with pointed
reference.
An evil look rose in his eyes,
The ape, watching him, pressed close against her
dress on the opposite side ; accustomed to his pre-
sence, she barely noticed his hand clasp hers,
The rider spoke again m low-toned menace,
“ Some day you will taunt me beyond endurance
I s a V m j^ r even . . , ~
Jealous ! > Of a monkey ! And you call your-
self a man ?
“ Yes ! but, by God, you shall never tell it,” he
cried, hoarsely, and, seizing her throat with the
fearful strength of fury, he forced her backwards
against the rail.
The sudden twist dislocated her neck; her
expiation was swift and merciful.
As her limp body slid to the earth, the ape
peered closely into her face, his yellow eyes intense
with fear, while he uttered inarticulate sounds
which ill expressed his anguish. Then he lifted
her lifeless hand, which, for the first time, did not
respond to his touch.
He understood!
The man, looking down upon his work, groaned
in the agony of returning v reason. The ape rose
upon his hind-legs and faced him.
The man recoiled from the human pain and
hatred burning in the eyes which held his own,
and lost his chance. In a second the ape’s hands
closed round his throat.
With all his might the man sent his fist bang
into the ape’s wind. The creature gasped and
choked, loosening its grasp a little so that the man
drew breath, but it still hung on.
The man drew and opened his pocket-knife, and
jammed it deep into the hairy breast. The beast
bared its fangs and grunted as a gush of blood fol-
lowed the stab, but the muscular fingers tightened
on the man’s throat until his protruding eyes,
suffused with blood, saw but the indistinct outline
of the ape, which swayed before him.
A moment more, and they fell together across
the huddled form of the woman they had both
loved.

“ Old and weary are my Furies,” murmured Pluto,
lord of hell;
“Old and useless are they, Hermes ; had I new
ones it were well.
Seek, thou messenger of Hades, Upper Earth, and
bring me three
Of her daughters, stern, unbending, and from
doting weakness free.”
Spake in Heaven to Iris Juno: “Iris, seek the
Lower Earth ;
Go and hither bring me maidens, cold and chaste,
of mortal birth;
Bring them hither, gentle Iris, for I fain would
laugh to scorn
Venus boasting hers the Empire over ev’ry woman
born ! ”
Wafted down by gentle zephyrs on her many-
colored wing.
Iris floated, and her coming brought along
delicious spring ;
And she sought and sought the maidens, and she
sought and sought again
Till with saddened heart she turned her —for her
seeking was in vain.
And when Juno saw her fav’rite thus returning
all alone,
Loud her queenly voice she lifted, “ Hath the
Earth so worthless grown ?
Is the virtue all departed from the lands beneatli
the sun
That, of maidens cold and spotless, thou canst
bring me never one I"
“ Goddess,” answered Iris gently, “ true it is that
Maidens Three
On the Lower Earth existed, from the bonds of
Venus free ;
Maidens in whose breasts unmaidenly there burned
no tender flame,
Maidens who had never smiled on man—alas ! too
late I came !”
“Late?” cried Juno, all astounded. “Ay! for
Hermes came before,
And to Pluto’s gates infernal straight the icy trio
bore.”
“ What doth Pluto with the maidens ?” Answered
Iris, “Goddess, know
He hath taken them for Furies to his gloomy realms
below.”

Apex Watch is of nickel,
beautifully engine- turned, with

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become allnost literally a house-
hold word; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in an acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee, of a perfect cure of every, ease he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.

ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy,feelmg, and

single life; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in peeking relief. Before ft is

who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many d( you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, Wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men,'his success has been almost invariable.
