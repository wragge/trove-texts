The Universal Bolsh
I No two accounts of the Bolshevik policy
agree. It is not necessary to assume that
any writers have been either hoodwinked
or deliberately unfair: it is more likely that
the policy itself as well as the programme
has changed again and again. At the outset
the leaders were internationalists—in theory
at any rate. Then they found the Russian
home-problems so enormous and pressing
that they turned their attention wholly or
almost wholly to domestic affairs; and no
doubt they were all the more ready to do it
because the better they became known the
less support they found they could depend
upon from even the advanced socialist leaders
of other countries. But whether they show
their hands -or not, Paul Miliukov, LL.D.
who was Foreign Minister in the Russian
Government that followed the Revolution
is satisfied that world-wide Bolshevism is
their aim; and his,evidence is presented in
Bolshevism: an International Danger (George
Allen and Unwin).
Lenin's talk lias throughout been of “the
woila Revolution.*’ “Bolshevism has be-
come, he said lately, “the universal theory
and practice of the world’s proletariat.’’
But he has been talking for the most- part to

I Lofting very sensibly protests
(Red Page 22/7/’2O) against Sir Harrv
Johnstons absurd,trick of handicapping him-
se!t by writing sequels to the work of other
ineu—Dickens or Shaw—instead of “father-
ing his own children only.” Men write he
say|, for fame, money, or the “impulse of
expression.” The best example of the last,
absolutely divorced from the other two, I
encountered on a visit to Hobart years ago,
when the Sherlock Holmes stories were
having their original boom. Jfour of that
city s cleverest men had formed two pairs of
competitive story-writers, the idea being to
find whether that kind of yarn was not
really rather easy to turn out. I read the
lesult, really good stories that any magazine
could accept for publication. But they were
all told, deliberately, in terms of Sher-
lock Holmes and l>r. Watson. “Why on
earth do you use those names?’’ I protested.
*?u can never get them published like that.’’
\\ ho wants to get them published?” was
the sole and final answer. That astonishing
quarter had spent several weeks in doing the
work just as well as they possibly could, for
the mere pleasure of doing it, and without
any wish to see the^result in print.
I here is a certain fascination in playing
with other, people’s puppets. Andrew Lang
astonishingly good at the game. In
Did Friends he brought together a lot of
characters from novels who, by similarity of
place and period, should naturally have met.
Thackeray s Becky Sharp, for instance, drops
in -as an older woman, of course—to one of
Trollones cathedral-closes; and men from
Stevenson foregather or fight with others
riom Scott. An American humorist has had
the nerve to introduce Hamlet and Ophelia
to Borneo and Juliet-—and make them change
partners. 4 *

But the misguided sequelist is usually the

When Moiseiwitsch Plays
WHEN Moiseiwitsch plays to his crowded audiences, they wish his wonderful
music might never cease. At the end of the recital they leave the
concert-hall with a sigh of reluctance, tingling with exquisite memories
of his art.
Why not have him to play for you always?
“His Master's Voice
records for you all the gems of his extensive repertoire.
The entrancing numbers listed enable you to hear Moiseiwitsch at his best when-
ever you please.
These records faithfully reproduce all the brilliant fluency of his playing; not a
shade of meaning, not the subtlest variation on the master-theme is lost.
To hear Moiseiwitsch Records as they should
be heard, play them with an “His Master’s
Voice’’ Needle on an “His Master’s Voice”
Instrument.

Singing Sands.
’Way out west of everywhere,
Westward to the sea.
Smiles a faery Singing Sands,
Wide and fresh and tree.
And tortoiseshell and jade and pearls,
Skies bright with starry dew;
And sandalwood and gems and gold,
And deep seas burning blue.
Wooden idols, leering, stare
And fold their fatted hands,
While dusk-eyed women laugh and dance
In island sarabands.
Silver luggers all asway
Make their magic miles
Through the Strait of Singing Sands
To the Outer Isles.
Drowsing red gods smile their most
And beckon with their hands.
Smile their lure for you, for me
West-ho for Singing Sands.

To Me Came One.
I looked far to the west
To where, his waves heaved high,
The sea swept to caress
The saffron sky.
When down the yellow road
That led from ship to sun
Immaculately fair
To me came one.
In raiment shimmering
Of purest moonbeam white;
Whose feet upon the sea
Fell e’en as light.
As little wind-blown leaves
Fall on a sleeping stream
So soft they scarce disturb
Her quiet dream.
“And who are you,” I asked,
“Who come so fair to me
A princess wrought of dreams?
“Kind Death!” said she.
“Not Death,” I laughing said ;
“ ’Tis thus the sages say:
Death is a thing of bones,
Unfleshed and grey!”
“The wise men oft mistake
The tinsel for the star,
The phantoms they create
For things that are.
“ ’Tis 1 am Death,” she said,
“When men have fingered long
The sweet sad lyre of life
And sung their song,
“Upon their brows I press
One tender kiss and deep,
Till in my arms they lie
In dreamless sleep.
“Until they hear God call
In waking whispers low,
When winging through the stars
Their glad souls go.”
“Oh, kiss me, Death,” I cried,
And hold me to your breast.”
“Sing first your song,” she said.
And then seek rest.”

Under tall cliffs pondering
Much on old Mortality,
While the swift gulls, slanting, wing
Now to shore, and now to sea,
And the soul within me hears
Songs of ancient, other days,
I bethink me of dead years
Vanished down Time’s dusty ways.
Hither come brown fishermen.
Hither long ago I came,
When I, too, was young, and when
Lithe of limb, with hope aflame,
Keen of eye, I watched the waves
Rolling, rumbling to the shore,
While in drenched and dripping caves
Sighed the seawind evermore.
Still the white gulls scream, and still
Glides the sea-mist, salt as brine;
But the joy, the glow, the thrill
Felt of old, no more are mine;
Call of wind and breaker’s call,
Nights that flamed and noons that flowered,
Freedom, fetterless of all—
These things have the years devoured.
Grey the sandstone cliffs, and grey
That which once was gold, in truth —
Fancy flashing down the way ,
Paved for her of old by youth.
Then the sea was young and fresh,
Young and fresh it still remains—
Can it be that only flesh,
Flesh that warms to beauty, wanes?
Mute the cliffs above, and mute
Tongues that thrilled the golden past;
Silence, stern and absolute,
In its chasms holds them fast.
Song of joy and shout of mirth
Find in time their destined lot—
Nowhere treasured by the earth,
By the sea remembered not.
Seaward sail the fishing skiffs,
Shoreward rolls the restless main ;
Scarred and fretted are the cliffs,
Furrowed deep by wind and rain;
Changing as Time turns his glsss.
Weathering as the moments fly;
Fated, too, they too shall pass:
Both are spindrift, cliff and I.

HYSTERICS IN QUEENSLAND.
Trembling with noble indignation, and
striking the attitude of Maud Ethel Muriel
Courtenay Cavendish, the sixpenny
heroine, when she. scorns the miscreant’s
gold, Lieutenant-Governor and ex-Minister
Lennon read a Speech announcing that the
Queensland Assembly is to be dissolved before
its time, and that great issues are at stake.
The election is to be an appeal to the people
to preserve their self-governing rights, to
protest against those who refused the
£9,000.000 loan, and to prevent the State
sinking to the level of a Crown Colony. If
a blind frenzy can be worked up on these
points and worked up in haste, it is just
possible that the Theodore Ministry may
get another lease of power. There are
chances in its favor that are not to be
despised. When the present party got into
power 59,221 new electors were put on the
roil, though the franchise wasn’t widened.
In other words 11 electors were changed
into 14. Though the State qualification
shuts out persons whom the Federal one
admits, yet under the new regime the State
discovered 40,120 more qualified citizens
than the Commonwealth could find. And
apparently very many of them weren’t flesh-
•l mi-blood’ citizens whose votes are unreli-
•;bb\ but ghosts who can be counted on. At
any rate, the party on top won a rousing
victory at the polls in 1918, and even
improved its position, while at the ensuing
Federal elections, with the same people vot-
ing but nob the ghosts, it could only capture
three seats in the out of
ten. and now holds only two out of ten.
Still, despite all advantages, it is best to
hold the election in haste. The Theodore
Government has failed to get its £9,000,000
loan in London, and, having no capacity or
mental resources apart from loan-spending,
a great gloom and failure and popular dis-
illusionment lie ahead. It is impossible to
run a public-works policy out of taxes, as
Victoria can do, for the Ministry is such a
ravenous spendthrift that it is already tax-
ing the people nearly five times as heavily
(exacting, that is to say, nearly five times
as much per head per annum) as the
southern Government does, and it wants still
more money for ordinary spendings. It isn’t
a case of striking while tlie iron is hot, but
of striking before the iron is quite frozen.
As already mentioned, the Queensland
people are to be appealed to in their State
capacity, ghosts and all, to defend their right
of self-government against traitors at home
and unbelieving financiers abroad. As the
Lieutenant-Governor read in a voice that
was shaken like a reed in the wind:—
A coterie of well-to-do Queenslanders have con-
trived to so misrepresent Queensland’s real position
abroad as to result in the Government being unable
to obtain from London necessary loan money for
normal development purposes, only on terms sub-
versive of the State’s political independence.
It is patent to all that for many years past there
have been among us ultra-rich exploiters who, with
a view to ridding themselves of free institutions
which exist here for the protection of the people,
would gladly see Queensland reduced to the status
of a Crown colony.
Rendered desperate by the loss of office by their
gradual loss of control of powers and machinery of
Government. .. . !
My advisers have declined this infamous proposal
They scorn the bribe....!!!
And much more to the same effect —that
the Theodore Ministry (which used to be
the Ryan Ministry until the astute Ryan
left it) reviled the tyrant and 'threw back
the challenge of the oppressor in his false
teeth. It also set forth in a general way
that the shining lance of justice, couched
in the cause of liberty, would pierce the
stomach of the hydra-headed monster .of
oppression so that its gore would spout up
to the blue arch of Heaven.
* * * *
Let us get to the simple facts. The
Queensland loan that failed in London, and
the failure of which is apparently Theo-
dore’s Sedan or Actium or Bosworth, had
many things against it. Some of them were
as follows: —
(1) In proportion to the population and resources
of the asker, it was the very biggest peace loan ever
asked for in one lump by anybody in London. In
fact, it was the biggest peace loan ever asked for
in one lump by any Australasian State, even the
most populous.
(2) It was demanded by a State which has already
the biggest debt per head bar one, and that one
(Westralia) has a statutory sinking fund, which
Queensland hasn’t.
(3) Queensland has since 1916 increased its debt
per head faster than any other State, and more than
twice as fast as the average.
(4) A far larger proportion of the Queensland
debt is held in England and a far smaller proportion
in Australia than that of any other State. The people’s
apparent lack of faith in their own securities
amounts to a disease and a phenomenon. Or else
their poverty does.
(5) Queensland, when it applied, had the very
poorest security to offer in the way of revenue from
public works—that is, from railways, which form
the vast bulk of the “reproductive” loan works. This
was the Australian record, comparing the last year
of the Denham Ministry in Queensland with the last
year of Theodore for which figures are available: —

To change the best-paying system of public works
into the worst, not through sudden calamity but by
persistent mismanagement, didn’t inspire much con-
fidence when J. Bull was asked for the biggest hunk
of money on record for new works.
(6) Queensland had the very poorest security to
offer in the way. of tax revenue.. Being already taxed
more highly than any of its neighbors, and four or
five times as highly as some of them, the prospect
of raising new taxes to pay very high interest on
an additional £9,000,000 looked doubtful.
(7) In any case the times are bad. John Bull
was so hard pressed that he cold-shouldered Victoria,
which wanted £6,000,000, not £9,000,000 (about
£4 per head instead of between £l2 and £l3) ;
and wanted it for a renewal, not for a new razzle;
and offered to pay part of the old loan out of
revenue if Bull would renew the rest. Yet Victoria
has the best financial reputation in the Common-
wealth.
(8) And, on top of all, the Queensland Govern-
ment had just altered, by Act of Parliament, two
agreements, one with the pastoral lessees, in which
a certain amount of Bull’s money is concerned, and
one with the Brisbane Tramway Co., which is wholly
Bull. In each case the other party lost by the deal,
and Bull began to think that a Government which
was so casual at altering contracts might alter the
one about payment of interest and principal on
loans also. And, in the matter of Bull's Brisbane
trams, a Minister’s clumsy open scoff at the idea of
being bound by a bargain 30 years old didn’t im-
prove things. Some of the loan contracts are more
than 30 years old.
* ■» *
In tbe midst o£ the confusion there went
to England a quiet little deputation of tax-
payers who asked that the vacant State-
Governorship should be filled, that being,
until the law is altered, a purely British
affair. The deputation didn’t care for the
rule of a Lieutenant-Governor, promoted
direct from the ranks of Government poli-
ticians, whose first important act was to
appoint sufficient Upper House nominees to
pass the rather dubious legislation mentioned
above. (It was the same man whose voice
broke from emotion while reading to Par-
liament the speech of denunciation men-
tioned above.) The principal deputationist
was an ex-Premier of greal age and small
stature, and not reputed to be of overwhelm-
ing wealth. He quitted Ministerial office in
February, 1908. The plea of the Theodore
Government is that this grey, retired, • rather
mouse-like /gentleman and his two less im-
portant colleagues wickedly leaned against
the pyramid or Eiffel Tower of their finance,
and it was so rotten that it fell. The appeal
to the people of Queensland to stand by the
Theodore Government to the last ditch as
the embodiment of their self-governing rights
is based on the proposition that the
£9,000,000 loan was offered provided the
State would repeal its legislation re the
pastoral leases and the Brisbane trams, and
that the base and degrading bargain was
rejected as if it was a serpent. It isn’t likely
that any human being with a shred of intel-
ligence will believe the tale. If the legisla-
tion in question was repealed, there could
be no guarantee that it would stay repealed
after the loan was secured. And in these
times one Bull doesn’t lend £9,000,000 on
the poorest public security in Australia to
buy some petty concession like that for some
other Bull whom he probably never saw
and couldn’t distinguish from a crow.
Queensland would almost certainly have
“got the bump” in London even if there had
been no deputation, and if it hadn’t done
tricks with any contracts, and if it had asked
for £4,000,000 instead of the Ministry riding
for a fall with its demand for £9,000,000.
It would have got it because of the lament-
able depreciation of the security. But for
the fact that no old loan has fallen due in
London or elsewhere since the present
Queensland crowd took office, and that the
Commonwealth has financed the new loans
and thus put the security of the other States
behind them, the bump would have come
much sooner. Theodore’s Ministry was
simply refused at the first time of asking,
because there is no earlier time than the
first time.
THE USELESS FRIENDS OF ERIN.
As many people’s ideas tend to be fuzzy
through lack of the habit of consecutive
thought, it may be well to attempt to define
the relative responsibilities and capabilities
of Australia and the United States as re-
gards troubled Ireland. A recent combust-
ible prelate, who was at least a warming
influence in the winter, talked very much as
if they were equal, which they certainly are
not. Here are some of the differences: —
The United States is the real home of the Irish
nation. In 1900 it contained nearly 2,000,000 per-
sons born in Ireland, but counting the locally-born
children and grandchildren of Irish settlers now
deceased the element that is Irish by descent and
sympathy probably numbers over 20,000,000. The
reason why Ireland holds 4,000,000 less people than
in 1841 is that, about 75 years ago, the nation
commenced to shift bodily to the U.S. —the only
empty foreign place within reach. Australia was
hopelessly remote, and Canada was British and
objectionable.
Australia isn’t the home of the Irish nation. The
people in the Commonwealth born in England, Scot-
land, Ireland and Wales (all lumped together in
the statistics) number only about half a million.
The U.S. as an independent nation can recognise
the Irish republic as Britain once threatened to
recognise the Confederate States, and it would be
merely an unfriendly act not necessarily leading to
war. If Australia did the same thing it would be
flat rebellion which might, even at the best, involve
separation, and leave. this country to face single-
handed all manner of chances in the Pacific for
which it is quite unprepared. In other words, success
would mean the finish of White Australia.
If the recognition did lead to war, the U.S. has
20 times as many soldiers to fight with as Aus-
tralia has, and it would have probably a hundred
times as many willing soldiers. Also, it could make
Britain fight on land, which is Britain’s weaker side,
and fight a long distance from home. Otherwise the
Empire would lose Canada. Australia isn’t placed
that way.
The U.S. has the second-best fleet jn the world
to fight with, and it could dreadfully embarrass its
enemy by its command of the Panama Canal. Aus-
tralia has no fleet worth mentioning, and hasn’t a
canal to its name except the one that cuts off a
bend in the Yarra.
The U.S. couldn’t be seriously damaged by a
blockade, because it can produce everything that is
absolutely necessary. Incidentally, it has two' land
frontiers which are proof against blockade. Inci-
dentally again, a blockade would hurt Britain more
than the States, for Britain would cut off the great
bulk of its cotton supply, and thereby cut its own
throat and likewise saw off the branch it was
sitting on. Australia, on the other hand, could be
wholly blockaded. It depends on imports for almost
everything, and is thus the most helpless leviathan
in the world. Even in wool and meat it hasn’t the
pull the U.S. has in cotton. That country controls
half the world’s cotton output. Argentina alone con-
tains as many sheep as Australia, and they produce
wool of a kind and mountains of meat.
The U.S. could embarrass an enemy in the money
markets of the world and cut off loan supplies. Aus-
tralia could only cut off its own loan supplies.
The U.S. could make its own munitions for 100
years of war; Australia for about 100 hours.
* * * *
The moral of it all is that Australia can do
nothing for Ireland except perhaps commit
a messy and useless suicide amid the ribald
laughter of the globe. It can’t even send
money to Dublin with any certainty except
by Britain’s permission, for that country
owns the mail steamers, or most of them.
Australia is imposing on the map, but as an
aggressive proposition and measured in man
power it is rather below Belgium, Holland,
Bulgaria or Serbia. It may be better for
defence on account of its size, but it can’t help
Ireland by retreating to an entrenched camp
in the Blue Mountains. In an outside mat-
ter of this sort it wouldn’t amount to even
one-tenth as much as Serbia did in the late
war. Serbia was fiercely unanimous. If it
came to a matter of helping Ireland with
anything more than conversation, one Aus-
tralian in 10 might be unanimous, and even
he wouldn’t be very unanimous. The United
States, in short, can almost certainly free
Ireland if it likes, while Australia, in that
connection, counts for about as much as Fiji
or Tonga.
No one knows the position better than the
politicians hereabouts who live and advertise
themselves on the Irish cause, and get into
Parliament on the strength of this huge
irrelevance, and make big salaries out of it.
and acquire through it the control of State
finances with which they play jinks that
tend to make angels weep. As there is
nothing to be done, it is the safest job going
to be an official patriot of this sort. They
are a pathetically incapable and rather un-
scrupulous lot, these men who bleed theoreti-
cally for Erin in Australia’s high places
without doing Erin a shadow of good. If
they were otherwise they wouldn’t be re-
duced to falling back on the Erin ticket.
They are humorless, too, else they would
die of laughter at each other. There are
State and municipal Governments in Austra-
lia which got enough votes here and there
through their useless sympathy with St.
PATRH* to give them a majority. Very few
of these men ever took or intend taking the
trouble to visit the island of their remunera-
tive . adoration; indeed, there have been
stories of some who got as far as London
and wallowed in the fleshpots of the Sasse-
nach and went no further. Just as with the
Huguenots of the 16th century, openly
divided into “the Religious,” who fought for
the faith, and “the Political,” who didn’t care
a straw for the faith but found it useful, so
the Irish adherents are divided, and in re-
mote Australia, where there is no fighting to
be done, “the' Political” naturally form the
bulk. But these people are expensive. They
may get into office by their views on Ireland,
but they must do something while in office if
only to. fill in time, and the spending of
money is within the orbit of the humblest
intelligence. Probably the Irish cause is now
costing N. S. Wales alone a few extra hun-
dred thousands a month without the said
cause getting a penny of it or N. S. Wales
being any the better for it. Many of the
followers are like the leaders, and are so
largely because of the leaders. That is to
say, they will strike and reduce their wives
and children to misery at the instigation of
their pro-Ireland leaders; they will go-slow;
they would riot mildly if a Tom Walsh
showed the way; they will agitate, procesh,
wave flags, plunge into sectarian rows and do
other things that reduce production, and so
raise prices and strengthen the importing pro-
fiteer, who is often a Sassenach of the deep-
est dye. But if it was suggested that they
should devote the four hours which it is pro-
posed to cut off the working week to toiling
and earning money for Ireland, and inciden-
tally do a little good to their own class here
by reducing the house and other famines, the
response would be bleak. It is Ireland’s mis-
fortune that so many people live on Ireland’s
misfortunes and a new Ireland without mis-
fortunes would deprive them of their jobs.
OLD FURNITURE AND NEW IDEAS.
With the sure logical sense which character-
ises, the French the custodians of Versailles
have made no attempt to preserve the set-
ting of the Peace Conference. There would
have been good money in it for the guides.
Thousands of tourists would have been glad
to pay for the privilege of seeing the pen
with which the Treaty was signed, the table
round which the Big Four sat, the square,
brocaded chair which supported the weary
bulk of Clemenceau, even the grey suede
gloves and the large boots fastened with
buckles which he wore. Tips would have
been forthcoming for a sight of Wilson’s
distinguished neck muscles preserved in
spirits or a lock of hair from Lloyd
George’s silvery mane. With an indifferent
shrug, if you ask them, the guides will indi-
cate the fireplace at which the statesmen of
the Peace Conference warmed their cold
old hearts; but it is with a gesture of real
delight that they throw open the golden
doors admitting to the miles of apartments
stuffed with Louis Quinze and Louis Seize
chairs and tables, where queens were brought
to bed and kings ceremoniously shuffled oft'
this mortal coil. For all this furniture
which is not furniture at all but only
decoration, all this luxury which had got
out of touch with life, is at any rate a price-
less key to history. Its unreality mirrors the
unreality of the society which created it.
Its shapes are as phantasmal as the court-
iers and kings who used it. Nobody would
dare to scatter books and beer-stains over
these gorgeous inlaid tables. The weariest
sightseer could not be tempted to rest upon
these stiff-backed, gilded chairs or creep under
the jewel-encrusted coverlets of the beds.
This furniture had forgotten to be comfort-
able because the'Court had forgotten to be
useful, and both had to be swept away in the
fierce reality of the Revolution. But the
Peace Conference has no such permanent
value, except as a monument to the inepti-
tude of party politics which already have
monuments enough to fill a Pantheon; and
the Treaty is so transient a phenomenon
that it has already lost all relation to the
real needs of the situation it was created to
deal with.
In the vast gardens of Versailles there
were charmed seclusions into which no echo
of the world of men ever penetrated. Forests
were planted to separate the palaces of
mistresses, and great canals dug to render
access to them elegant and easy. The famous
little chalets in the woods still look at their
reflections in the artificial lakes. Marble
fauns covered with green mould leer at you
through the leaves. Here queens played at
being milkmaids while France raged and
starved. Here courtiers ground diamonds
into dust to dry the ink of love-letters. The
economic theories of that age have a reminis-
cent tang. Marie Antoinette asking why
the people who clamored for bread did not
eat cake was curiously like the statesmen
who believed Germany could be industrially
crushed and at the same time be made to
provide more wealth than it had ever pro-
duced before. Necker, who was made Min-
ister of Finance because he gave a specially
brilliant banquet to the smart world of
Paris, was the prototype of the post-war
politician who got the suffrages of the
people on the strength of a promise that
Germany would be made to pay the whole
cost of the war.
Versailles is a monstrous solitude which
the imagination finds it hard to populate.
Our carriage wheels crashed over the cobbles
of the vast empty squares, sending a desolat-
ing clamor up to Heaven. The terraces jutted
•into space like the last plain that ends the
world. The fountains were disconsolately
dumb, and the empty avenues stretching into
the distance looked as if only a race of
giants could ever have adequately filled
them. But this gigantic stage, which might
have overawed an archangel, had no terrors
for the gay souls who actually inhabited it.
The Queen presents the Dauphin with a
carriage covered with rubies and sapphires;
one courtier pulls down a castle and re-
builds it to provide a royal fete ; another, .so
that he can conduct his amours in secret,
buys up and empties an entire street leading
to his residence. A ridiculous and inter-
minable etiquette absorbs the interest of this
gilded mob. Scarcely a whisper of the mind
and purpose of the age breaks the magic
trance. While the encyclopaedists are pre-


paring the wav for a world-shaking rev olu-
tion. the Court revolves gaily on its axis.
La Pompadour plunging Europe into war
to avenge a trifling snub, and four elderly
statesmen sitting amidst the wreck ot
Europe striking a bargain which will save
their political reputations, have very much
in common. ~ .
Against the solid front of that great block
of buildings the torrent of ideas broke in
vain. A little of the spray sometimes dashed
the smooth surfaces of the artificial lakes
and ponds. Courtiers used the burning words
of Diderot to embroider verses or to point
an epigram. Victories in the field were
valued if their names provided rhymes, and
great disasters were welcomed if they, could
be punned. Turgot, the greatest Finance
Minister of his time, hounded out of office
because he told the Court to cease its sepa-
rate and unreal existence and shoulder the
common economic burden, may be compared
with the politicians elected in civilisation s
crisis on a pledge to hang the Kaiser.
A little of the wind of the world’s thought
disturbs the unctuous placidity of the Peace
Treaty. Lip-service is given to the new’
ideals. Colonies are mandated instead of
being seized. Countries occupied by force
of arms are converted into protectorates and
constitutions forced upon them. The prin-
ciple of self-determination is applied to
people who do not want it and denied to
those who do. To reward the new little
nations which do not understand the neces-
sity of co-operation, the economic resources
of Europe are divided up like plunder
among pirates. Under the plea of nation-
ality Poland is encouraged to set up a gim-
crack empire made up of hostile elements.
A sham League of Nations, destitute of
power, is created to satisfy the craving of
the world to be relieved from the menace of
war. But the Nemesis of unreality dogs
the Treaty. It wanders over Europe from
one watering-place to another, like a dyspep-
tic millionaire in search of temporary palli-
atives for a deep-seated disorder. It is like
a creed which everybody recites and nobody
believes in. The Governments, while pre-
tending to apply it. only seek methods of
evading it. It is at home in the tepid atmo-
sphere of Spa and San Remo, where
expropriated Russian landowners and cosmo-
politan financiers create for themselves an
illusion of security amidst the deepening
chaos of Europe. It shuns so strenuous an
air as London, where men have begun to
work again indifferent to its promises and
prohibitions.
When Europe declared for life and oppor-
tunity in 1019 the Peace Conferences
dressed up as saviours and played at map-
making. When 18th-century France declared
for reality the Versailles Court dressed up
as milkmaids and called their game the
Return to Nature. The Revolution swept
away their milkpails. But w’hile revolution
may provide redress for political injustice, as
a means of economic restoration it is useless.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Repatriation on Provincial Lines.
Amidst the thrilling distractions provided
by sport and the movies, Hughes and Man-
nix, Sister Ligouri and the I.W.W. pri-
soners, Australia is apt to lose sight of plain,
drab items like the following : —7
To settle 8000 soldiers on the land has cost
£12,000,000. To put 16,000 on the land will cost
£21,000,000. — Premier Storey, of N. S. Wales.
I should like to sound a note of warning regarding
the high prices ruling for landed property. The
large purchases made by the Repatriation Depart-
ment, coupled with high prices for the products of
the soil, have tended to force up land values to an
artificial extent.—J. L. Webb, chairman of direc-
tors of the Commercial Bank of Australia.
The white population of the Northern Territory
(area 523,670 sq. miles) was computed at 3443 on
June 30, 1919. Since that date 400 or 500 persons
have left owing to the closing down of Vestev’s meat
works. — Senator Russell.
The fertility of the Kimberley district (Northern
Westralia) is undeniable, and it has great mineral
wealth. But the total white population in this
immense province of 144,000 sq. miles is 1540.—•
Western Mail.
Each of these extracts is pregnant with sig-
nificance, blit taken together they suggest a
tragedy in the making—a tragedy of wasted
opportunities. Repatriation is essentially a
national question, just as the war was. But
because the States control the land, the
developmental side of repatriation was aban-
doned by the National Government and made
a provincial matter. And because the pro-
vincial administrations are provincial-
minded, their efforts have been concentrated
on settling ex-soldiers in the South, where
the people (and the votes) are, the voteless
North being neglected, as usual. And, having
no suitable Crown land available, four of
the States (and even Westralia and Queens-
land to some extent) have been obliged to
buy out existing settlers at fancy prices, a
policy which as a rule involves replacing an
experienced man with an inexperienced one,
and loading the latter with an over-capital-
ised proposition from the start. The settling
of 16,000 soldiers at a cost of £24,000,000
on dear land in N. S. Wales won’t increase
the security of Australia, endangered by the
possession of an empty and fertile North, one
iota. Further, the fruits of the enormously
expensive project will be nothing wonderful
even if the whole 16,000 succeed; and the
history of agriculture in all parts of Aus-
tralia suggests, unfortunately, that many of
the soldier-settlers, being novices at the
game and heavily mortgaged, will fail. But
what couldn’t be done with £24,000,000.
wisely expended, in Northern Australia!
What a different aspect repatriation would
wear if the Australian Government, casting
provincialism aside,, had invited Monash
and his Diggers to complete their work by
developing (and that means defending) the
North on scientific A.I.F. lines! The thing
was practicable a year ago, and its states-
manlike boldness and breadth of view, to-
gether with the promise of adventure it con-
tained, would have captured the imagination
of every ambitious young Digger—the men
of Palestine and Syria above all. But the
necessary statesman was lacking, and
developmental repatriation, which might
have done such great things for the nation,
was allowed to drift into the hands of poli-
ticians of stunted vision, persons with land
to sell, and hawk-like individuals who wanted
their cut out of it; and it is still in their
hands. The war made Australia a nation,
but the politicians are doing their utmost to
provincialise it again.
Bluffing the People.
Organised labor in Britain threatens to
stop work if war is declared pn Russia;
and the easy, conventional thing is to scream
"Bolsheviks!” at the men who propose this
drastic proceeding. The S. M. Herald, >
for instance, after damning the Labor
demonstrations as “Soviet rule,” goes on:
•We are to believe that not the Parliamentarians
themselves, but the Labor oligarchs, are capable of
interpreting the will of Parliament. The British
franchise is practically universal, and yet at the
general election less than two years ago the trades
unions, which now claim to comprise the people,
were able to elect only 63 direct representatives
in a House of 707 members.
Really, no better weapon than this could
be put into the hands of the “Bolsheviks’ ;
for all they have to prove is that the British
franchise is not “practically universal,” and
the Herald’s whole argument against the
British Labor action topples over. And they
can easily prove that the franchise is no-
thing like “practically 'universal.” Under
the Representation of the People Act (,1918)-
the franchise is enjoyed by only those males
who possess a residence or business pre-
mises qualification ; while a woman cannot
vote till she has reached the age of 30, and
not then unless she has a residence qualifica-
tion or is married to someone who has.
Under anything resembling a universal fran-
chise, British Labor representation in the
Commons would be many times greater than
it is, and nobody knows that better than
the British workers themselves. During
the war —which they helped so enormously
to win—they were told thousands of times
that they had the inestimable privilege of
forming part of a great democracy. The
war won, they look for that democracy,
and they cannot discover it; they want to
express their opinion upon a matter of
tremendous importance to themselves —of
vastly more importance to them than any
other class —and they find they cannot do it
through Parliament. They were told, in
the days when their services were nation-
ally indispensable, that they enjoyed the
privilege of living under a system where
that right was theirs; yet, as the Herald
tells them, they have only 63 members in a
House of 707 members, while hundreds of
thousands of them, being without the fran-
chise, have no representation at all. Direct
action is ruinous action; it is unspeakably
cruel action. But for its consequences
those people are responsible who deprive
these men of Parliamentary action. Happily
it can be much more truthfully said of Aus-
tralia that its franchise is practically uni-
versal. Yet even here the system has defects ;
and while those defects last they furnish, if
not a reason, at any rate an excuse for direct
action. We have various utterly non-repre-
sentative Upper Houses; we have a Senate
in which at least a great minority is prac-
tically voiceless; and, on top of it all, there
is a constant struggle on the part of men
in office to keep the people’s will from being
effective. For about ten years now the
country has been calling for an adequate
tariff: and for about ten months 90 per cent,
of the electors have been in favor of a repeal
of the War Precautions Act. The tariff is
still undetermined and the Prime Minister
still holds and exercises powers which he
acquired on the understanding that they
would only be used in war-time. Again,
the more taxation the Federal and State
Governments impose the more anxious those
who have to find the money become for
administrative economy. And particularly
in high places, since it is the top that sets
the pace for officialdom in such matters. Yet
W. A. Watt is returning shortly from a
futile trip to London, where he went to do
work for which another official is well paid.
Further, W. M. Hughes is off to Europe
again, and before going he proposes to visit
Rabaul with other Ministerialists, the party
travelling on three men-o’-war. Another big
job is also tq be made for someone in Wash-
ington. And so on. These and other flout-
ings of popular sentiment must either be
left alone, or, pending the adoption of the
recall, be attacked by demonstrations of the
sort that the Herald miscalls “Soviet rule.’
As a matter of fact, every action of the sort
is the negation of Bolshevism inasmuch as
it is directed at the very type of vainglori-
ous idiocy which produces Bolshevism. Once
devise a scheme under which those most
concerned in any impending big step can
talk straight to the administration on the
subject, and the last remains of the case
for upheaval against tyranny and misgov-
ernment must fall to the ground;
♦
Dragging the Judges into Politics.
When it is a fine day the Australian
Government goes out and issues a Royal
Commission. There are so many hanging
around Sydney and so many persons dodging
them that the congested traffic problem is
taking on a new complexity. In a country
with seven executives, fourteen Houses ot
Parliament, 700 legislators, an Interstate
Commission and a Premiers’ Conference that
has got into the habit of meeting every three
or four months, the need for Royal Commis-
sions is not apparent, especially as every one
of the seven Governments is more or less
hard up. However, a Commission is a handy
device for saving the face of a Government
that wants to remain on its rail, or to stave
off importunate adherents, or to give a color
of impartiality to a predetermined line of
policy that might involve the loss of votes.
And it is not necessary that the Commissioner
should be an expert on the subject of his
commission ; indeed, the less he knows about
it the better. The appointment of Justice
Edmunds “to inquire into the administra-
tion of the Railway and Tramway Depart-
ment” is in accordance with this principle.
Justice Edmunds is as eminent an authority on
railway administration as he is on the moun-
tains of the moon. He is about as well
versed in tramway management as he is in the
history of the Peruvians before Pizarro’s
time. But his charming ignorance of railway
and tramway matters was evidently regarded
as a high qualification. Along with the fact
that he is an Arbitration Court Judge, with
a tradition of impartiality and a reputation
for intellectual indolence, and that his was
the award that ended the last coal strike
(although W. M. Hughes had arranged the
business beforehand), it got him the job. A
railway and tramway expert, or even a busi-
ness expert, was the last person the Govern-
ment was looking for when it determined
upon this particular Royal Commission. Had
such an individual offered his services he
would have found the Premier’s office
colder than the South Pole. It is rough
on the heads_of the Railway and_ Tramway
Department that their professional and
administrative reputations should be placed
at the mercy of a tyro in a horsehair wig.
It is also rough on the N. S. Wales public
that Justice Edmunds should be taken, for
an indefinite period, from a familiar and
necessary billet and thrust into one that is
neither familiar nor necessary. But the
growing habit of dragging the judiciary into
bitter political, or quasi-political, contro-
versies like those which have raged round
the I.W.W. prisoners and the 1917 railway
strikers, is a rougher thing than either. It
is becoming the fashion for rampantly parti-
san Governments to announce that they stand
pledged to release (or reinstate) llogg and
Blogg. by way of prelude to the nomination
of a Roval Commission to “inquire into” the
case of Blogg and Hogg. A suspicion arises
that the Commission would not have issued
but for doubts entertained by the Govern-
ment touching the votes associated with
Hoggs and Blogg. No Judge can afford to
have it said, even falsely, that he has become
a political scavenger for a Government.
Hence the public—at least that section of it
whose good opinion is worth-while —would be
relieved to hear that their Honors. had
refused this invidious Royal Commission
work and gone back to their proper func-
tions and non-political atmosphere. It is a
duty they owe, not only to the people, but
to the high traditions of their order.

Defence.
For the past 12 months there has been an
uneasy hush on the Defence question. Labor
was understood to be anti-militarist; and
a horrible fate was predicted for any Minis-
try which imposed compulsory training upon
men of voting age. But in the last year
stupendous things have happened. The Bol-
shevik armies, instead of crumpling up before
famine and the Western Powers, have gained
startling successes. Their propaganda is
doing deadly work in India and the “Middle
East.” At the same time the Japanese tone
towards the U.S.A. grows steadily more in-
sistent, not to say truculent. The world
has become -more sophisticated about the
reactions of a great war; and most Austra-
lians have a pretty clear idea of what the
position of the Commonwealth would be in
the event of trouble arising between the two
Pacific Powers while Britain was heavily
engaged elsewhere. For some little time W.
M. Hughes has been palpably groping for a
policy. At Bendigo the other night he indi-
cated that the quest had ended: —
They would have to consider Australia’s defence
policy before very long. They would have to submit
it to Parliament, and in Parliament there were some
who were controlled, to a large extent, by forces
which were seeking to overthrow the Empire, and
they would, under one pretext or another, seek to
reduce the defences of Australia to a point where they
would be useless for the purpose for which they
were intended.
That is much better than nonsense about
the Menace of Rome. It means that the
Hughes Government, which, on many
grounds, deserves to be dead, has a very fair
expectation of life in front of it. The issue
lies in the hands of the Labor Party. It
its leaders adopt the course taken by T. J.
Ryan at the last general election in the matter
of the constitutional referendum questions
and jettison Labor’s traditional policy be-
cause the other side happens to be advocat-
ing it, then Hughes is safe. But if the
party takes the stand that it has always
battled for adequate Australian defence and
will always do so, and that the need for it
was never greater than now, it will re-
establish itself, even though a few I.W.W.
fanatics drop off. It would be a tragedy
for Australian Labor if a desire on the part
of the Opposition to oppose at any price
gave Hughes the chance to put the pacifist
brand on the democratic section. In the
present temper of the public mind it might
mean years of administration on Tory and
Freetrade lines.
An Australian Excellency at Washington.
Canada is bounded by the United States
along its whole southern border, its whole
northern land border and more than
half its western border. In fact, it
is almost surrounded by the circular
Uncle Sam. and for thousands of miles
along a largely artificial boundary-line
a man can stand with his toes in the
Republic and his heels in the Dominion. As
it is impossible to appeal to London (and it
makes London very tired to be appealed to)
every time a brick is thrown across this line,
Canada now maintains a sort of ambassador
of its own at Washington. That place is but
a day’s run from its own capital at Ottawa,
so the business doesn’t cost much. In fact,
the only reason why it has an ambassador
instead of letting a Minister run across when
required is that his Excellency represents the
valuable, time-saving, money-saving right
of direct negotiation. Apart from border
rows, there is the little matter that the U.S.
buys from Canada on an average -£100,000,000
worth of goods per year and sends it
about 100,000 emigrants in a year, and
much of Canada’s high, low and medium
finance is done in New York. So there are
vast interests to look after. Bu.t Australia
is 6000 miles by the ordinary route from
the U.S. mainland, and a long distance from
the nearest U.S. possession of any sort. It
doesn’t touch Uncle Sam’s border anywhere.
It doesn’t finance in New York, but in Lon-
don. In normal times before the war (aver-
age for 1909-13) it sold the U.S. only a
shade over £2,000,000 worth of goods per
annum, and that country ranked a poor
seventh among our foreign customers, or a
poor eighth if the British Isles are called
foreign. This export trade was a dying one,
being much less than that of 1891, or 1901,
and it isn’t likely to grow much for various
reasons. One is that the parts of the U.S.
most accessible to us are the least popu-
lous and are raw-material places like our
own. Another is that the U.S. most em-
phatically discourages imports of all sorts
except specie, and doesn’t mean to be a
buyer, though it is a whale for selling—in
return for specie. It has always sold much
to us and bought little from us, and that
kind of trade doesn’t suit Australia. What the
Commonwealth buys abroad it wants to get
from good, generous customers like France
and Belgium, and, above all, from the Old
Man in London, who badly requires some
prosperity, else he won’t be able to renew
our loan when it falls due. In all the cir-
cumstances the proposal to find a rich job
for some tired or discredited politician by
making him Australian ambassador at
Washington (U.S.A.) is probably the most
glaringly impudent scheme of loot and cor-
ruption among the long series of jobs which
have marked Australia’s political decadence.
This country can’t afford another Australia
House, that monstrous jest in London. Yet
the House had at least the excuse to begin
with that it was planted on the premises of
our biggest customer —the one that is worth
all the rest put together; our only financial
backer; and the one with whom, being our
suzerain, we have to be in daily communi-
cation. Still, the result has been so pitiable
that unless a great reform is possible the
place should be sold and the ambassador
accommodated at Mrs. Todgers’s hash-house.
The billet of High Commissioner has come
to be recognised as the last lap for some
elderly politician who is still dangerous and
a nuisance, or pathetic and in need of help
—the last lap on the way to oblivion. He
isn’t really wanted to be efficient and brilliant
and celebrated, for then there might be a
demand that he should have a second term,
and another elderly buck is always waiting for
his place. He doesn’t care about it himself, for
he knows he is only serving his notice to
quit politics, and a notice to quit doesn’t
induce enthusiasm in any man. As he is
meant to be discredited and fyave no second
term, everything of importance is done with-
out him by Ministers who go to Europe at
vast expense for the purpose, or by financial
persons on the spot who know the money
market. So Australia House is untidy, neg-
lected. supercilious, filled with officials who
don’t know Australia and don't care to know
it, and is about the last place in London,
barring the South Kensington Museum or
the office of the Coal Smoke Abatement
Society, to apply to for up-to-date informa-
tion about this country. The institution is
so tired that it has presented no .report of
itself to Parliament for some years, but it
is alleged that it has bought a sports-ground
five miles from London for the use of its
mostly English employees. Doings of the
Australia House sort give this country a
bogus reputation for wealth which causes pick-
pockets and confidence men to swarm around
the traveller from these parts, but they are
of no practical value. Until something is
done to save Australia House from its posi-
tion as one of the mirthful episodes of the
age, there should be no further experiments
of the sort. The idea of a similar white
mammoth at Washington, to be followed by
mammoths at Brussels, Paris, Colombo,
Delhi (or Calcutta) and Berlin —all greater
centres of business so far as we are con-
cerned than Washington—is too terrible.
Paws, Brethren, Paws.
Wonderful how much money there is in
“trade” —fthe unproductive pawing of things
and passing them from hand to hand, or
simply making out invoices for them without
the trouble of pawing! A case mentioned
before the Fair Profits Commission in Mel-
bourne concerned lamps. The importing co.
(an American affair, by the way, so its
profits go abroad) was supposed to get them
at 525. 6d. per dozen. It sold within a few
hours to Blank at 58s. 6d., and the same
day he sold to Blanky and Co. at 775. 6d.
They sold to Blast and Co. at 108 s. These
were all wholesale people and importers. Next
the goods at long last reached the retail firm
of Cuss and Co. at 1505., and it sold at 180 s.
to a consumer —probably named Blither —
who actually wanted lamps. All these pro-
ceedings seem to have taken about four days.
None of the profits were very outrageous,
though those of Blanky and Blast wouldn’t
be called moderate, but they were numerous,
and when there are so many useless and
utterly superfluous lions along the path, and
each takes even one bite out of the passing
sheep, there is little mutton left at the finish.
In countries where the manufacturer is
supreme he often .gets into the habit of sell-
ing direct to the retailer, or even to the
consumer. In fact, though he isn’t supreme
in Maoriland, some of the woollen companies
there ran their own shops and measured cus-
tomers with their own hands as far back as
40 years ago. But in Australia the position
is so much reversed that the importer, a
giant excrescence almost unknown in some
lands, can often make the local manufacturer
sell through him under pain of boycott. One
of the numerous Commissions got quite wild
the other day because a Vic. woollen co., en-
joying a spell of luck after a long period of
ill-fortune, made 20 per cent, profit in ■ a year.
The profits which the mere traders stuck on
the above-mentioned lamps in quick succes-
sion were 11 per cent., 32§ per cent., 39 per
cent., and again 39 per cent. Pawing is a
great game. Bring up your son to be use-
less and paw!

The Disease that Nobody Gets Excited
About.
Dear Bulletin, —It warmed the cockles of
my heart to read the dehortation of “Mac-
quarie Street” (B. 29/7/’2O) against get-
ting hysterical about V.D. The V.D.
Jeremiahs weaken a good case by over-
stating it. They rely less upon evidence than
the assertions of fanatics, and the medical
fanatic is the greatest scaremonger in the
world. The facts are sufficiently bad with-
out the artful aid*of exaggeration, but when
it is periodically alleged, on the authority of
Dr. Scarem, that 10 per cent, of the Aus-
tralian people have—or have had —syphilis
and 50 per cent, gonorrhoea, my blood refuses
to boil. On the contrary, I turn to the
phlegmatic and trustworthy and
learn that syphilis kills an average of 164
Australians per annum, and gonorrhoea an
average of four, whence I infer that Dr.
Scarem has been talking through his tile.
Dr. Longbow’s assurance that “60 per cent,
of the offspring of syphilitics die before or
shortly after birth” leaves me equally cold.
Again I have recourse to Knibbs, who in-

It is an instructive comparison, and sug-
gests that the enthusiasm of some reformers
has been misplaced. The Y.D. mortality
was less last year than it was in 1910, but
cancer takes a more terrible toll every year.
V.D. is a malady that yields readily to treat-
ment, but if the doctors can cure cancer
they are too modest to admit it. Yet for
one article about cancer that finds its way
into the secular press, ten are published
about Y.D. For eveby Australian pound
expended in cancer research 20 are ungrudg-
ingly provided for the campaign against con-
sumption, although cancer passed tuber-
culosis in the grim deatlwace six years ago,
and notwithstanding that thousands of Aus-
tralian soldiers acquired consumption in
France and Flanders., it has retained its lead.
It is the deadliest of the ills to which the
adult Australian is heir. The Common-
wealth’s death-rate from tuberculosis is one
of the lowest in the world, but its cancer
death-rate is one of the highest. And the
disease finds most of its victims among per-
sons in the prime of life, and no class is
more pitilessly attacked than that which
labors with its brain. Within two years,
for instance, cancer has struck down three
ex-Premiers of Westralia — John Forrest,
Frank Wilson and Henry Daglisii —two
of them comparatively young men; the third
old in years but mentally unimpaired. It
is an arresting fact, and deserves to be
recorded, even at the expense of the strange
convention which forbids a newsnaper to
mention, in the case of a deceased person,
that cancer was the cause of death. It is
sometimes necessary, in the public interest,
to break the rule.—Yours, etc., D. E.
We Are All In Convents.
The cry of a secular monk: —
The people who work themselves into a frenzy over
Escaped Nuns are up against a stronger force than
they apparently suspect. Stone walls do not a
prison make these days in respect of anyone but
proved criminals or lunatics. But convention does.
Under the law of the land ex-Sister Lioouri could at
any time have walked out of the Wagga Convent.
What frightened her when she had done so? What
is it that evidently still frightens her? The opinion
of those with whom she has been brought up! The
same gyves are on all of us, and rare indeed is it to
find one with the nerve to take them off.
Consider my case—that of a “chorus gentleman.”
I drifted into the calamitous profession through hav-
ing a Suspicion of a baritone voice and a bent
towards amateur theatricals in early youth. My
real gift was for carpentering. However, my people
were of the clerkly class, and so it was unthinkable
that I should be a carpenter. I spent a good deal
of money at a theatrical school, where I learned to
produce my voice (such as it was) wrongly ; to per-
form certain capers known as stage dancing; and to
recite. Then I got the job which I now hold and
loathe more than the most worldly-minded nun can
detest the most Spartan convent. I began with 30s.
a week, and at present am earning £4 12s. 6d., no
salary while travelling and nothing while sick. I
still live with my parents when not touring—.marriage
and a home of my own being out of the question—
and in my spare time I do the only thing at which
I shall ever be any use. I have built a cottage on
the half-acre block which my father owns, and am
now making the furniture for it. But, though the
place will be sold or let, you must understand that
I am doing all this as a hobby. That absolves me
from the stigma of being a tradesman. As a car-
penter I could make £SOO a year from the jump.
Nor would my career stop there. And I would revel in
the work —the open air, the sense of independence and
the joy of creation. I would be a real artist instead
of the absurdity I am.
I go on making an ass of myself for a starvation
wage because it is genteel to be an actor; because
my parents and friends would be scandalised if I took
to manual labor for money. The theatrical manage-
ments know: there is a never-failing supply of people
like myself—male and female—who are clamoring to
be sweated; We are all in gaol, locked away behind
the iron bars of an idea.
Slanderers of Ma,
’lt was recently suggested that the Federal
capita] question should be re-opened when
the popularly-elected Convention meets for
the repair of the Constitution, and the pro-
posal is eminently reasonable, for the last
popularly-elected Convention had no say in
the matter. The clause dealing with the
capital was smuggled into the Constitution
by self-appointed and unauthorised persons
after the people’s delegates had finished their
work. On this matter the Sydney Tele-
graph said recently (17/8/’2O) : —■
Mr. Jackson, M.H.R., one of the Tasmanian mem-
bers, who has banded himself with others to a course
of action the practical effect of which will be to
retain the Federal Parliament in Melbourne indefi-
nitely, suggests a referendum to give the people of
Australia an opportunity of saying whether any further
moneys shall be expended at Canberra. Strange as
it may seem to Mr. Jackson, the only State in which
a referendum on the subject could be undertaken with
any show of decency is N. S. Wales, to ascertain
whether the people of this State are willing to waive
the conditions on which they entered the Federa-
tion.... What could the rest of Australia, excepting
Queensland, do on a referendum but maintain the
attitude they held when the bargain was struck?
That attitude was just what they had to surrender in
order to obtain the adhesion of N. S. Wales to the
Federation... .There, is one thing sacred. That is
the solemn condition without which the Common-
wealth would not have been created.
Now the N. S. Wales, community was not, at
the time the Constitution was framed, the
filthy and sordid bargainer, the revoltingly-
selfish grabber, that the Sydney Telegraph
and similar papers paint it. Nor was it
the pawnshop-minded creature, half-sweater
and half-Shylock, that it is depicted by the
Canberra group of politicians who plaster it
with mud for their own base ends. It accepted
the original Constitution as drafted by the
people’s elected representatives by a suffi-
cient majority, and by 21,595 more affirma-
tive votes than were required under the
bargain which N. S. Wales made, at its own
HOUSEMAID'S KNEE.
One result of the visit of a young Prince.
instance, with the other States. The majo-
rity which voted “Yes” was willing to leave
the capital an open question. Nor did the
minority which voted “No” say that it was
actuated by the want of an assurance that
the capital would be in N. S. Wales. Never-
theless, a crowd of conscienceless politicians
in Sydney contrived to get into the Consti-
tution these unauthorised additions and trim-
mings :—•
That no State should be divided, however essential
subdivision might be in the interests of Australia,
except by the consent of its own Legislature domi-
nated by Big City influences.
That the seat of Government should be temporarily
but indefinitely in Melbourne.
That some day there should be a permanent capital
in N. S. Wales.
The new .Constitution, like the old one, was
accepted in N. S. Wales because the people
really wanted Federation. But though this
time there was a bigger poll and a bigger
majority, there were 16,513 more votes
against the politicians’ faked Constitution
which fixed the Federal capital in N. S.
Wales than there had been against the
people’s real Constitution that left its location
an open question (82,741 noes at the second
poll against 66,228 at the first). Whether
the larger poll at the second vote was be-
cause of the proviso against subdivision, or
because of gladness at the idea of an immediate
temporary capital at Melbourne, or by rea-
son of joy at the prospect of a remote perma-
nent capTtgl in N. S. Wales, there was no-
thing to show. But these three provisos, not
being the work of the people’s appointed
delegates, are the only ones which are not
sacred. N. S. Wales doesn’t deserve that it
should be held up to obloquy as the
one member of the partnership which had to
be bribed and bought—the only one which
was a cloth for dirty hands and a mat for
disreputable feet. Hardly anything too bad
can be said about the handful of politicians
who schemed and twisted to secure certain
advantages; but they had absolutely no
authority from the people, who had accepted
the Constitution as it .stood ; and the people
disowned them at the very first opportunity.

While the Drys and the Wets have been
shrieking their half-truths and whole lies,
the practical work of liquor reform has been
going steadily on in Victoria —and will con-
tinue to go on if the fanatics don’t interrupt
it. Since the Vic. Licenses Reduction Board
had its first sitting, 13 years ago, 1358 pubs
have been shut up, and 68 licenses have
lapsed. Including 26 roadside licenses, granted
for the convenience of travellers in newly
opened country, only 39 new pubs have been
allowed. The net reduction has therefore been
1387. There remain 2133 houses and these
will be gradually diminished: and the fact
that only the most deserving will remain
will mean a struggle to keep up the standard
all the time. An average of £530 each was
paid as compensation in respect, of 1288 of
the dis-barred places and the other 70 are
about to be dealt with. None of this money
has come out of the public Treasury. The
Trade (including the landlords) has had
to supply the lot, the survivors, in effect,
raying for the reduced competition. There
is no more commonsense system in the whole
wide world, and the practical reformer
should defend it vigorously.

“Exul” : “Macquarie Street” (B. 12/8/’2O)
has had a professional experience very
different from my own
and that of my intimates
if he has found a close
connection between
alcohol and V.D. I am
convinced that the former
has very little to do with
the acquisition of
syphilis, and —as bearing
upon the same matter —
that for every person who
gets the disease from a
professional at least three
acquire it from amateurs.
That opinion is not the
result only of war experi-
ence. A few years ago
the senior honorary phy-
sician for treatment of
syphilis at R.P.A. Hospi-
ta 1, Sydney—probably
the biggest V.D. clinic in
Australia —asked some
hundreds of male syphili-
tics as they came up-for
treatment the question,
“Did you pay for it or
get it for love?” The
answer in over 75 per
cent, of cases was that
they got it for love. Of
course this leaves out of
account the huge mass of
innocently infected wives
and children, into whose
plight the question of
alcohol cannot possibly enter.
♦
The house-gamble is quite an institution
now in N. S. Wales, though so far it is run
on a small scale, as the new shacks which
the' Government supplies in a year could
just about meet a week’s demand. Partially-
homeless citizens assemble once in a long
time at the office of the Housing Board in
Sydney and play a two-up or lottery game
with the State for a few cottages at the
suburb of Bareville. They pay £5 for every
£lOO and owe the other £95 at low interest
spread over 30 years. If by any chance a
sufficient quantity of houses dropped
from Heaven the £BOO place at Bare-
ville (£4O paid and £760 owing) would pro-
bably fall to £5OO and be dear at that, and
then the State might be £260 out. House
prices are high owing to scarcity of brick-
layers, brickmakers, carpenters, timber,
cement, etc.; also to no Saturday work, lack
of miscellaneous materials, much paper
money and sundries. So the State pays high
for run-’em-up premises to alleviate the
famine, and if it does alleviate the famine
the value of its property will come down
with a crash and the roof will fall on its
own head, as the busted land boom fell on
Samson. The acceptance of £5 per £lOO
deposit instead of the £25 which is usually
regarded as the very least that can be called
a safe thing either means that this loan-
boom country is mighty poor despite all the
roar about development and resources, or
else that the Ministry is taking an absurdly
big and needless risk to advertise itself
as a jolly good fellow. As it is all loan
money the position is, as usual, that. Pos-
terity is advancing on mortgage by compul-
sion, and without its knowledge or consent,
up to 95 per cent, of the boom value of the
shacks at Bareville. It seems safe to
say that not one member of the Ministry
would advance up to even 75 per cent, of
his own money on the same security.
“Ex-Missionary” writes: —
Just for the sake of peace and to make one less
bone of contention for yellow and green debaters to
argue over, it might be as well if “enclosed orders”
became disclosed orders, and all religious houses
were officially and periodically and rigidly inspected,
the inspectors being agnostics for preference. There
are too many closed things in this world, including
caucuses and Labor Conferences, and they are liable
to become ill-ventilated and stuffy. Italy and
Portugal suppressed religious houses utterly on the
ground that they took too many able-bodied people
away from productive work, while France and Spain
put them under official inspection and restrictions.
Before the law of 1901 was passed there were
129,492 nuns in France, which the practical rulers
declared to be a great waste of motherhood—the
possible mothers of at least six army corps, or the
possible progenitors of the possible population of a
city the size of Bordeaux. So nearly half the insti-
tutions were disqualified out of hand. Contrariwise,
Australia, the land of half-measures and makeshifts,
gives sidelong endowments of an unknown amount
to “religion,” and to “homes” and the like belong-
ing to religious bodies, ranging from Rome to Salva-
tion Booth. It does this by exemptions from sundry
rates and taxes, supply of free water and relief from
the industrial laws re wages and hours. Occasion-
ally it actually supplies cheap labor through the
habit magistrates have of giving an unfortunate the
choice between the unpaid and uninspected wash-tub
in an “institution” and gaol. There is little or
no restriction that I can discover on the amount of
property that a pious corporation can hold, and it
seems to be free from income-tax. Also it does
the State out of a heap of probate duty by the
simple process of not dying, a thing that no mere
layman would be ingenious enough to think of.
Logically, in a country with no official religion, all
pious foundations should pay full rates, land-tax,
income-tax and other sundries; should pay their
workers, whether they teach or wash or keep house,
at union rates; should observe union hours; should
be inspected for sanitary and other reasons just as
a factory or an adopted State infant or a State
lunatic or a conditional purchase is inspected, and
should pay probate and succession duties say every
50 years, that being an excessively liberal guess at
the time when a lay property falls due for another
tax through the decease of the owner. (Probably
the lay property pays once every 30 or 35 years.)
Then the institutions could be endowed openly and
above board, out of the public revenue, and they
would be just where they are now, only without
the murky and furtive concealment.
“Wealsman” : A recent “Plain English” on
the position of State Excellencies referred to
the Tasmanian constitutional case, which
finally settled all doubts as to a Governor’s
political futility. Though the point does not
affect the issue decided there appears to be
some doubt as to what was done. These
are the facts. Governor Macartney sought
to impose certain conditions upon Opposition-
leader Earle before commissioning him to
form a Labor Ministry, and one of those
conditions was that an election should be
held almost immediately. But the election
was not held. Earle accepted the Governor’s
conditions, or led his Ex. to believe so, but
there must have been a mental reservation
somewhere in the acceptance, for, directly
the new Ministers met Parliament, a motion
disagreeing with the Governor and question-
ing his right to impose such conditions was
moved by N. K. Ewing (now Judge) and
was carried on the voices almost without
debate. This meant that Parliament accepted
full responsibility for Earle’s action in tak-
ing office, and amounted practically to Par-
liamentary endorsement of the means em-
ployed by Earle to obtain the commission
from the Governor. Anyway, none of the
conditions imposed by Ellison Macartney,
and allegedly accepted by Earle, were ever
carried out. Instead, the new Ministry carried
on pending a reply from Britain in regard
to the constitutional point raised by
Ewing’s motion, and when that reply
showed that Governor Macartney had ex-
ceeded his duty in seeking to impose con-
ditions on a Minister-elect Earle’s Minis-
try naturally carried on, holding office for
two years. As to the gist of the Sec. of
State’s ruling—that a Governor must in all
cases act on the advice of his Ministers or
find others—there is' no possibility of con-
fusion. But whether did or did not
“deceive the Governor” on purpose, and how
far he was justified in so doing, is likely to
provide matter for discussion in future, and
there will be much “scholarly ploughing of
the sands.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Anglican Conference has been in ses-
sion at Lambeth Palace, London, and among
other things it “recorded a protest against
the color prejudice.” Australia for one must
recognise the justice of the accusation, and
as soon as pure-black bishops and archbis-
hops become common in England it must re-
consider its position. Britain has under its
direct rule some 300,000,000 colored people;
and the continued absence of black bishops
and archbishops in England, despite two
centuries or so spent in owning and
Christianising niggers, seems to suggest a
color prejudice inside the church to which
the prejudice outside the church is a mere
circumstance.
In Republican France they have a short
way with Jergers. Two prominent British
Socialists —the Right Ilonl W. Adamson,
member of Parliament and leader of the
Labor party in the Commons, and Gosling,
president of a big union—dropped in on our
gallant ally’s country to collogue with per-
sons viewed as revolutionary and undesir-
ables. They didn’t get a trial or a hearing
or even a written notice to quit, but were
told by word of mouth that a train was
leaving the same evening, and they were
leaving also. The right to expel aliens with-
out explanation is so fully recognised, except
in Australia, where the foreigner is allowed
to think he runs the show, that nobody turned
a hair.
Attorney-General McTiernan is a very
young man, but already he has found out
a way of snatching defeat out of the jaws
of victory. If he had sternly prosecuted his
eminent Labor friend the Lord Mayor of
Sydney on the charge of profiteering instead
of declaring that it was a first offence and
didn’t matter in the Lord Mayor’s case, it
would have been a grand advertisement for
the Bill and for the stern
morality of the Government. And it might
have been a lot better for the Lord Mayor,
who would then have had the chance to
offer a feasible explanation in court. Old
Brutus, who executed his son, made a use-
ful reputation that lasted for his lifetime
and endured for centuries after he was done
with it; and quite possibly the young man
was too expensive to keep, in any case. A
capacity for not seizing the skirts of happy
chance but being trodden on by the lady as
she goes by is a politician’s worst asset.
The Sydney Billions Club lately suggested
a public debate on immigration with the
Labor Council —a form of amusement which
is about as cheering as a club-swinging com-
petition. The scheme naturally fell through
because the parties couldn’t agree on the
aspects of the question to be discussed, the
number of rounds, the weights and colors of
the riders, and whether either party could
haul off his dog by the tail if the other
one bit during a clinch. The Billions Club
had suggested that 75 per cent, of the immi-
grants should come from Great Britain. The
Council’s programme included the usual
denunciation of capitalists; but the thing
that really mattered was this:
That place of birth or nationality shall not in any
way act as a restriction to admission to Australia.
There has been a suspicion that “advanced”
Laborites have long been weakening on the
White Australia policy, and would sooner
have a black man who subscribed to their
Leninite programme, even if he didn’t under-
stand it, than a white one with ideas of his
own. Now, so far as that particular council
is concerned, White Australia goes over-
board with a splash. So the Billions Club
has one good deed to its credit: it cleared
this obscure matter up and let the Austra-
lian worker know exactly where his “coun-
cils” are steering him.
Sydney City Council seens to have poor
luck with its financial matters. There was
the proposal to. pay £75,000 for a practically
undeveloped and officially condemned coal
lease. Then came the proposal to employ
an outside firm of architects without com-
petition to supervise a gigantic loan work
at a commission which might run to £60,000,
though the Council has salaried officers of
its own to do such things. And on August
20 the Sydney press buzzed about a muni-
cipal proposal to buy for £5OOO a scrap of
land 22ft. 4in. by 10ft., situated at squalid
Ultimo. That was £5OO ner foot if mea-

sured one way, or nearly £224 per foot if
measured the other way, or £22 per square
foot, and the city assessor said it was just
ten times too much. People are beginning to
talk of the gay times of 1853 when, after Dan
Egan had finished being Mayor, the helter-
skelter Corporation was suspended in an odor
of insolvency, dishonesty and rum and onions,
and Sydney put under Commissioners. Per-
haps the useful Judge Ewing may be given
yet another job.
It may be true, as Prime Minister Hughes
said, that “some damn fool” was responsible
for compelling the English journalists with
the Prince’s party to pay Federal income-tax
on their six or seven weeks’ earnings in Aus-
tralia ; but at any rale the “damn, fool” did
no more than carry out the policy of the
office; and the policy has presumably been
laid down or approved by the Treasurer.
The narrowest and most literal interpreta-
tion of the law is always insisted upon, the
defence being that, with so many cases to
deal with, no discretion whatever is possible.
For instanc-e, if a man carries on two busi-
nesses the losses on one may be set off
against the profits on the other; in other
words, he is assessed, and pays. tax on his
net income, as he should. But if he carries
on one business and manages another for,
say, a private company in w T hieh he is largely
interested, then he doesn’t carry on two busi-
nesses ; and if he makes a loss on the busi-
ness it pannot be deducted from either his
salary or his profits received by way
of dividends from the other business.
Which, of course, means that he is
assessed and is compelled to pay tax on an
entirely fictitious income. Where, by a
literal interpretation of the law, the Depart-
ment can make a claim, it makes that claim.
That is the policy from first to last; and
despite the talk about “some damn
fool,” the English journalists have not suf-
fered a bit more than thousands of good Aus-
tralian citizens.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Frank Brennan has received much credit for smart
tilings he says; but he can make silly bloomers,
too. The other afternoon he wanted to know whether a
German could acquire land in Australia. Groom, for
the Attorney-General, answered that no German could
acquire freehold or a lease for more than five years.
Whereupon Brennan, assuming his most brilliantly
sarcastic manner, asked, “In view of this, will the
Minister suggest how such men may exist?” That
sort of bluff might get a cheer from the lion, mem-
ber’s North Melbourne constituents; from Groom it
merely brought the cruel reply: “In the same way as
millions of other people who do not own landed
property.” To get this obvious knock-out Brennan
had done more than ask a ridiculous question. He
had again put himself forward as a champion of anti-
British alienism.
\
If McPherson, the Victorian Treasurer,
sometimes has his doubts about representa-
tive government, it can’t be wondered at.
Like George Turner in the post-boom days
he has set himself to straighten out the
finances, and at almost every turn he finds
the eyes of Parliament fixed on the next
elections. Twice within the last week or
two he has been set upon almost furiously
—once for refusing to pay certain gratuities
and allowances which have been the custom
for over 30 years, though there is not a scrap
of Parliamentary authority for it; the other
time for trying to limit the period of cer-
tain civil-service “rises,” his idea being to
compel Parliament to increase the income-
tax or do something else to provide for the
rises before they are made permanent. The
Government couldn’t even command a
majority to support this perfectly reasonable
proposal. In short, Parliament's attitude
was: Give them their rise, and let the
finances take care of themselves. If there
is a deficit isn’t there also a posterity?
The V.R.C. has removed Federal politicians
from the list of official deadheads, presumably
on the plea that their increased screw now
enables them to pay for their little flutter.
This will be a blow to certain Labor mem-
bers who are assiduous followers of. form,
and are often mistaken for capitalists
because of the size of their operations. The
V.R.C. ukase takes effect at once, which
means that the unhappy punters will have
to start paying for admission in the most
interesting and crowded period of the racing
year.
There was a time when E. H. Macartney,
M.L.A. for Toowoug (Q.), shaped like a
pi’ospective Premier, but he has decided that
politics is not the game it is cracked up to
be. He has notified the National political
organisations that he won’t be a candidate
at the general election, but the organisations
are going to have a heart-to-heart talk with
him in the hope that he will think better
of it.
Fingleton being absent and Burke recalci-
trant —he twice fell foul of the Chair- the
Storey Government was for a while in
jeopardy during the no-confidence debate in
the N. S. Wales Assembly. But Labor mem-
bers breathed fiercely in Burke’s ear, and
he lapsed into silence and the situation was
saved. It recalled the time when Holman
was carrying on with his majority of one.
Early one morning, when a jaded but snarl-
ing House was still attending to business, a
pressman met two Labor members and took
them for a drink, which became several. At
the severalth they met another Labor mem-
ber, who had had a good day at the ponies
and insisted on buying champagne. The
Government heard about the celebrationis
first, and when Wade got the momentous
news he found that old J. B. Mercer had
the floor and was doggedly repeating himself
to fill in time whilst motor-cars scoured Syd-
ney in search of the revellers. Mercer held
the fort until the roystering truants arrived,
but it was a narrow shave. •
The discussion on Hughes’s Butter Bill
in the Reps, caused a unanimous desire to
boost the “primary producer.” Men as far
removed politically as Atkinson and Ryan
were for once united in the opinion that the
sacred backbone was also the liver, lights
and lungs of our economic system. Atkin-
son almost drivelled in his desire to lift
Cocky to the heroic plane, and Ryan was no
less insistent on Hayseed’s virtues. The
feature of the Labor members’ outburst,'how-
ever, was their noble solicitude for the dairy-
farmer’s profit. Parker Moloney viewed
with horror the idea that the world’s parity
in butter might rise above the 2405. per cwt.
which Cocky is to receive under the bill, and
that the poor fellow might be robbed of the
increase. The fact that a rise in the parity
would cause a sinking feeling in the con-
sumer’s pocket escaped Parker’s noticebut,
then, he wasn’t thinking of the poor con-
sumer that day. Nor were his brethren
from similar electorates.
Reflections of a N.S.W. Labor democrat:
The jury was not the fountain of justice, neither
were the Judges. The Crown [otherwise he, the
speaker, the youthful Attorney-General McTiernan]
was the fountain of justice, charged with the prero-
gative of mercy. If the Crown [that is to say,
McTiernan] had gooJ reason to believe an injus-
tice had been it was open to the Crown
[or McTiernan] to appoint a commission to investi-
gate. The Crown [yes, McTiernan] could release
men without the commission. But the Government
was careful in this matter, and appointed a com-
mission.
No wonder a King’s Counsel immediately
arose on the other side of the House and
congratulated McTiernan.
The N.S.W. Labor Exchange presented
the usual melancholy report for July. Despite
the fact that the Government “blewed”
£1,500,000 of loan money in the month
(£18,000,000 a year), mostly to employ un-
skilled labor, there were on an average four
uneducated men applying for every unedu-
cated job. And on the other hand., though
the Commonwealth has only 15,421 ‘factories
and workshops on its record, while little
Denmark (a reputedly agricultural country,
not nearly so large as Tasmania, and with-
about 3,000,000 people) had 82.442 in 1914,
the demand for educated men “far exceeded
the supply,” so it was difficult to keep the
handful of industries going. Borrowing Aus-
tralia threatens to become a notoriously
ignorant white man’s country-—ignorant
even of how to build a house for itself, a
job which the fowl is capable of doing with
its feet.
Tlie Federal Income Tax Department, in
coming dow T n upon only\he journalists aboard
the Renown, was a snob. The Prince is tech-
nically taxable in Australia —even the King
pays income-tax on the Privy Purse in Eng-
land —and the young man’s gross revenues
from the Duchy of Cornwall alone average
£lBO,OOO a year.. There were at least two
other rich men in his party, and the only
poor ones were the journalists. If the whole
lot had been taxed, as is done in the case
of touring theatrical companies, there would
at the worst have been a big lump in cash
to get against the visitors’ exasperation. By
tearing the miserable aggregate of £25 from
the only real workers in the crowd, the
Department gave its countenance to what in
these days is the most dangerous of all prac-
tices —the exploitation of the poor, while the
rich escape.
THE BOSSED LEADER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Only one person can influence me, and that is
my wife. She bosses me!” —Premier Storey in
N. S. Wales Assembly.
Just for a moment we trusted in Store}’,
Deemed him the bird he pretended to be,
Envied his vain and ephemeral glory,
Thought him inflexible, fearless and free.
Now, it appears from his graceless confession,
He, like his brothers, is under the ban,
Cravenly yields to domestic oppression,
Shares in the shame and enslavement of Man!
Bold in debate, in his office officious,
King of the hustings, as strident as Hughes,
lie, when a petticoat rustles and swishes,
Meekly surrenders, his heart in his shoes.
Strip from his buzzum the badge of the freemen !
Wanly the flag of his servitude waves.
He, too, is thrall to the whims of the “weemen,”
He, too, John Storey, is one of the slaves.
We shall march leaderless, lacking his presence,
Knowing the missus he’ll never defy;
Deeds will be done, with his meek acquiescence—
P’r’aps she’ll decide that the State shall go dry.
What though his vocables, blatant and raucous,
Agitate Parliament —blot out his name!
Mrs. S. bosses the boss of the caucus —
Pat he admits it, exults in his shame.
Let him go on—he has handed the sack to us,
Turned us down Openly, given us pain;
Even if, penitent, he should come back to us,
Clearly we never could trust him again.
Still let us combat the tyranny sinister
Laid on our sex since the dawning of life,
Maybe we yet shall a Cabing; Minister
Welcome, who isn’t afraid of his wife.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The complicated and wasteful note-issue
position grows rather worse instead of better.
If the Federal Treasurer was the best finan-
cier in the country, selected solely for liis
job, something might be done,, but the kind
of man who is selected out of 38 breezy per-
sons who talked themselves into the House
isn’t always equal to big matters. Accord-
ing to the returns in. Knibbs’s latest work
(March 30, 1920) these are the elements of
the situation :—•
(1) The notes issued amount to £57,003,872,
and against them is held a gold reserve of
£23,089,888, or £4l 11s. 2d. per cent. If the
issue was a legitimate one, consisting of notes run-
ning from 10s. to £lOO and supplying the legitimate
needs of the public, a 25 per cent, reserve would
be more than ample, and £10,000,000 that is now
earning nothing could be released to earn 61 p.c.
( £050,000 a year).
(2) But no less than £23,606,000 of the issue is
in £lOOO notes, of no use to anybody for business
purposes. They are held by the banks, and are
an excrescence, a bogus item, a sort of disease and
a chronic misrepresentation of the case, and should
be withdrawn as soon as possible. They are sup-
posed to be' an item of war finance, yet in the first
quarter of 1920 they were actually increased. The
holders would gladly present them to be cashed to-
morrow, if it is too late this afternoon, and as they
would mop up practically all the cash reserve, leav-
ing only £83,888 of gold to Secure £33,397,872
of paper, the reserve is ridiculously small.
(3) But the £23,606,000 of £lOOO notes can't
be presented for payment, being a forced loan with-
out interest and without any definite security,
though the Government hates to mention this bald
fact. As they require no more cash reserve against
them than the proceeds of a blackmailing episode
or a burglary do, the gold fund again looks ridicu-
lously large and wasteful.
(4) A possible method of getting some of the
dead, money into use might be to divide the note-
business openly into two sections like this:
(a) Ordinary or legitimate issue of £33,400,000
covered by a gold reserve of 40 per cent.
( £13,360,000).
(b) Extraordinary and (for the time being) irre-
deemable issue of £23,600,000 against which no
reserve is required.
(5) Then there would be £10,000,000 available
to reduce the issue of £lOOO notes, and in some form
or other that amount would begin earning interest.
At present the absurd position is that
£10,000,000 of notes which could be redeemed
are lying idle and earning no interest, while
ten million sovereigns which might redeem
them are also lying idle and earning no in-
terest. They are two dumb creatures looking
at each other across a gulf of usefulness
and doing nothing. If the banks could be
induced to accept £10,000,001) worth ot
interest-bearing securities in place of the
same amount in non-interest-bearing notes,
and a similar sum in gold was applied in
reduction of the Federal debt to the British
Government, the banks would get an income,
the Government would save an outlay,
£10,000,000 of foreign debt would be turned
into local debt, ami a beginning would be
made at the extinction of an item which
looks too like Bolshevik finance to be plea-
sant. # #

This is a much-changed concern since the
1919 accounts were presented. The big and
affluent Lloyd’s Bank (London) was taken
in as a partner during the past 12 months,
the 50,000 shares which it subscribed giving
it an eighth interest. Lloyd’s had been so
well satisfied with its investigation that for
each £7 10s. share paid to £2 10s. which it
bought it gave a premium of *£2 lUs. Ihe
National’s shareholders put up a similar
amodnt of new capital at the same premium.
The £20,000 increase of net profits shown by
the table looks poor considering this half-
million or so of additional funds, the boom
Maoriland has been experiencing, and the
fruit the “working alliance” with Lloyd s
might have been expected to bear. But the
latest entry in the table needs elaboration to
show results satisfactorily. The net profits
are given less £65,000 set aside m a resei ve
for depreciation of investments and £oU,UUU
struck off the book value of premises to-
gether over four times the average amount
annually written off lately. Before making
these cuts profits for 1919 were £166,;
for the past year, £251,299. This gives a
better view of how things have gone: —

Gross profits may have been even greater,
for they are shown “after making provision
for bad and doubtful debts,” an elastic stock-
ing into which a bank management often
stuffs something away for a rainy day. In
view of the price Lloyd’s paid for its interest,
evidently the National’s hosiery is in healthy
condition.
A few weeks ago this page showed what
a time Maoriland has been having with its pro-
ducts and how the figures of the B.N.Z. had
benefited. The National of Maoriland figures
have expanded in a similar extraordinary
manner. During the five years to March .‘5l
last aggregate M.L. deposits increased from
£30,085,954 to £59,408,136. The National s
share has meantime frown from £4,740,39 <
to £8,856,133. Five years ago it held 15*
p.c. of total Dominion deposits; the present
holding is slightly under 15 p.c. So this
bank lias not had more than its share of the
abundance, of money flowing in the Dominion.
Notwithstanding that, there has been this
wonderful growth during the past nve years
compared with the previous five: —

111 1915 £903,491 of the liquid assets was
invested in public securities or was lying
at short call. At the latest balance 4* mil-
lions were represented in this way. With
over 3i millions more liquid assets earning
good rates of interest and almost three mil-
lions more advances on the books, and with
higher prices helping exchange earnings, the
£236,435 increase oj gross profits over the
period is easily explained.
With the new funds got in the National
is now in a good position to expand still
further. Total liabilities at the balance
were £11,403,871, but that included reserves
for depreciation of investments and for con-
tingencies, and, as explained above, at least
£65,000 was dropped into that bundle during
the past year. After payment of the latest
div. the National of M.L. had funds totalling
£2,089,573; so it held under £5 9s. of the
public’s money for each £of it own. It was
in a strong position, too, from another point
of view : 56.7 p.c. of all liabilities was held
liquid. Shareholders are now receiving 14
p.c. p.a. on their paid capital, but, since
reserves exceed capital, the return is equiva-
lent to only 7 p.c. on their money in the
business. Still, divs. are free of taxation,
so shareholders’ bite is sweeter than it looks.

The N.Z. Insurance Co.’s accounts have
hitherto been made up annually to Nov. 30,
but since the business has grown to large
dimensions the management has not found
the close of the calendar year the best suited
for weighing up the business in hand for
balance-sheet purposes. A few mouths ago
shareholders agreed to the closing of the
books in May each year, and the manage-
ment now effects the change-over by present-
ing accounts covering operations for the past
six months. The profits disclosed for the
half-year are almost a record; only in 1917,
when a lot of high-premium marine business
worked out well, were operations more pro-
fitable. Premium income has been rolling
in at a great pace, no doubt partly as a
result of Maoriland’s great trade activity,
but mostly because of the higher value of
all incurables. Here is the underwriting
record over many years: —

“General. tSan Francisco disaster. 16 months.
The loss experience for the past six months
was practically the same as for the yeai
prior to the war. Notwithstanding increased
staff costs and heavier taxation and so on
—during the past six months this co. was
called upon for £37,673 for taxes, lire bri-
gade and underwriting association contribu-
tions, compared with only £22,018 during
the 12 months to November, 1914—-business
is now being written at a lower cost than in
pre-war days. The larger average amount
of insurance involved in each policy has pro-
bably been the principal factor, though, no
doubt, this big office is attracting much
new business at small cost. The savin,, of
2 d c. compared with a few years ago is a
big item : on the basis of latest net premiums
it represents about 3i p.c. p.a. on paid
capital. , .
Income from investments continues to
expand: all except £B3OO of the latest
£50.000 dividend was provided by mteiesf
and rents. That means that 88 p.c. ot the
underwriting profit is left in the business
as a further protection for policy-holders.
The N.Z. Insurance Co.’s figures .have not
altered to any extent since the last accounts
were published six months ago, and as they
were then reviewed at length on this page
(B 19/2/’2O) further dissection is post-
poned until the next annual balance.^

After a good run early in its career/ war
troubles interfered with this co. so muc
that an average profit of under o, P-C. P-a-
on paid capital was the best it could show
for the five vears to 1919. During the past
12 months, however, various water schemes
have been revived; the Specks Hydrp-
Electric Department has obliged with a
£39 000 contract; the Kandos Cement Co.
wants £12,000 worth of pipes, and several
Water Boards have placed orders. lhe
high price and scarcity of metal pipes are
helping the co., so business has been brisker
than at anv time since the war. During
the dull period the directors tapped reserves
to maintain 6 p.c. divs., but prior to the
handing out of the final 10 p.c. for the past
year (the interim div. was at the rate ot
8 p.c.) the balance-sheet position had been
improved in this way :

The liquid surplus at .June 30 last was
£36,526, oompared with £34,645 12 months
before. The work on hand should ensure
a prosperous run during the current year.
But it would not be safe to reckon on a con-
tinuance of big. payable contracts. The
difficulties experienced by State Govern-
ments in the loan markets recently and the
stiff rates of interest demanded preclude for
a time any new-works boom such as was
experienced during the eo.’s early years. On
the other hand, during the period of economy
that will be forced upon us, there may be a
stronger disposition to turn to the cheap
wood-pipe for such works as are carried out.
So, if the sky is not bright, there is at least
a silver lining to the clouds.

The latest Australian banking amalgama-
tion proposed is between the mostly English-
owned E. S. and A. and the London of Aus-
tralia. The fusion, the London Bank
directors say,
offers advantages which they have for some time felt
would attend an amalgamation of interests with
another hank carrying on business similar to our
own. The expansion of business and rise in prices

Commonwealth General Assurance
Corporation, Ltd.—Four politicians (kmghW
Albert Gould and Geo, Fuller, ex-KS.\\.
Education Minister James and Tims. Henley)
and the Electric Light and Power bupply
Corp.’s general-manager (J. E- Donohue)
comprise 8 the C.G.A.’s first Board. But
business-getting depends on the salesman and
what he has to offer, and. there is already
such an army of policy-hawkers on the roads
and so many brands for sale that a new eo.
requires a resourceful and energetic manage-
ment to snatch much business from the big,
affluent offices. The promoter and prospec-
tive managing-director of the C.G.A. i,s llios.
Foster, a London-trained life man, until re-
cently agency-supervisor with the A.f.a.
His co. is to have a nominal capital ol a
quarter of a million in 10s. shares; the pub-
lic is being invited to subscribe 200,000 to be
paid to 4s. for a start, the promoter takes
10 000 paids for “services rendered and to be
rendered,” and 290,000 shares are to be in
reserve. The co. intends to handle all classes
of life assurance, giving particular attention
to personal accident and all-sickness busi-
ness, and also hopes to tackle house-purchase
insurance.
The prospectus is straightforward and
makes no. extravagant claims. It points out
that, since the gilt-spurred roosters from
Amurka withdrew, the number of life offices
operating in the Commonwealth is much the
same as it was 25 years ago, and that natura
expansion is offering opportunities tor a
progressive youngster. The Bulletin sees
no reason why a new life office, guarantee-
ing to conduct its business on sound lines,
should not be welcomed. The trouble, how-
ever, is that there is no law controlling the
business: anybody can put out his shingle
and commence juggling with the people s sav-
ings. Until such time as the Commonwealth
Parliament regulates assurance every untried
office begins life heavily handicapped, because
since it is under no obligation to behave
itself the public has no assurance that if will.
The C.G.A. float starts off with T. W. Brem-
ner as consulting-actuary and Dr. Lec-ii
Purser as chief m. 0., and the prospectus
declares that all premiums will be based
on sound actuarial lines.” So long as it
lives up to that promise and does not go in
pursuit of big figures at ruinous cost no
objection can be taken to its presence.
From the point of view r of shareholder s,
however, the enterprise is a long shot. They
are backing one man (who receives 10,OUU
gift shares) to make a success of the con-
cern. Establishment expenses are un-
avoidably heavy, and years must elapse before
distributable profits show up. A unique
feature of the C.G.A. float is that the first
issue of contrib. shares is to carry a < p.c.
cum. pref., div. until the concern is in a
position to pay that rate of div. all round.
It is questionable whether this, concession
to the early-birds will not result in a tangle,
for the directors have the right to close the
issue when onlv 30.000 shares have been
subscribed, which, fully paid, would provide
a totally inadequate £15,000 of capital. The
directors’ chances of being able to coax in
new capital immediately on top of that
closure would seem very poor. And if the
7 p.c. cum. pref. accumulates on a larger
issue, it will almost certainly prejudice the
getting in of fresh capital in the future.

The Malayan Tin Corporation, which has
hitherto# had its home in Sydney, has now
decided that it is “to the best interests of
shareholders” to remove headquarters to
Malaya. At the same time a shuffle is to be
effected Ly which the present co., with 8400
shares of £5, all subscribed and fully-paid,
will emerge as one with a nominal capital
of £150,000 in £1 shares. The new co. will
issue S4/>OO fully-paids in exchange for the
present scrip, giving shareholders a £2 hold-
ing for every £1 at present. This distribu-
tion is made possible by the Takuapa Valley
float, from which Malayan Tin is to get
£20,000 cash and 70,000 fully-paid £1 shares.

The “Wild Cat” last week included a
letter from “a man in the linseed-oil trade”
with respect to the Australasian Oil and Cake
Mills float. Storey and Fotheringham, the
proprietors of the seven-months-old business
which it is proposed the co. should take over,
showed that during four months’ operations
they had spent £2151 on seed, and the man
in the trade, assuming that about £4O per
ton had been paid for it, calculated profit on «
the basis of 530 tons crushed. Obviously
those figures showed only 53 tons handled.
Storey and Fotheringham, it seems, paid over
£5O for the seed, and on that basis claim to
have made a profit exceeding £lB per ton ;
which is evidently what leads them, in their
prospectus, to look for a £2O-per-ton profit.

All doubts as to what was behind Badak
director Scai’borough’s bombshell cables con-
cerning that alleged fabulously-rich tin pro-
perty were cleared up by a letter received
from him this week. The mystic cable which
first jolted the market, it now appears, was
intended to convey the knock-out information
that expert-borer Isaac Boadle had put down
25 bores for, at best, only half an ounce of
tin in ground where Orton and Wilson had
claimed to have bagged 141 b. to 171 b. samples.
Boadle, he adds, got on to decomposed granite,
and just in case it might have been a false
bottom he went deeper, but could not find
enough tin to provide even an assay. As for
his own part in the Orton-Wilson operations,
Scarborough merely remarks that he is
“knocked silly” and “too staggered to think
much about anything just now.” He offers
up the pious hope that “everybody will keep
cool and try to solve this awful position.”
Meantime discoverer Orton, who was to ac-
company general-manager Raleigh to the pro-
perty, has been politely informed by the
Commonwealth Government that the privi-
leges attaching to the passport which was
issued to him a few weeks ago have been
withdrawn.
A practitioner explains “miner’s eye” :
A Bulletin writer reports that “miner’s eye” is
causing a lot of trouble in N. S. Wales coal-mines,
especially on the South Coast, and he says that
people are at a loss to explain the increase in the
trouble. In this disease—nystagmus—there is an
intolerance of light, poor vision (it sometimes sinks
to one-quarter of normal), dancing of objects looked
at and other impediments. We were formerly taught
that it was caused by the position assumed by miners
(such as lying on the back while using the pick, the
eyes being directed forwards and inwards) ; but this
theory has served its turn, and has had to give way
to the idea that the complaint is induced by bad
illumination aided and abetted by the breathing of
impure air and the inhaling of noxious gases. It
is found to be rare in naked-light pits, and common
in safety-lamp pits. This may be partly explained
by the fact that the old farthing dip—the tallow-
candle—remains the best illuminant in common use
at the coal face, giving 1 candle-power, and if the
wick be spread out, even 2 c.p. The safety oil-
lamp, at best, gives but i c.p.; but there is an
electric-lamp (the C.E.A.G.) which gives 0.99 c.p.,
and the new Oldham (also electric) a trifle more
(1.12 c.p.). As, however, the disease is to be found in
pits that use the electric-lamp, it is necessary to go
deeper than poor illumination to reach the cause.
One difficulty that besets explorers in this field
is the fact that coal absorbs anything up to 90 p.c.
of all incident light, and if the mineral were not
crystalline, this 10 p.c. would dwindle down to 2 or
3 p.c. On the other hand, chalk reflects about 90 p.c.
of incident light, which fact has led one investigator
to suggest that the pit bottom and part of the road
should be whitewashed, which proceeding, he claims,
would be equal to doubling the candle-power of the
illuminant.
The only question of importance with regard to
electric-lamps is as to their safety in dangerous
mines. Prom experiments the new Oldham lamp
has been found to be as safe as the ordinary oil-
lamp, and in the matter of convenience it is miles
ahead of that ancient contraption, since it can be
worn as a headlight, and by means of an adjusting
apparatus its position can be altered so that it can
be used to explore cracks or fissures in the roof. It
gives, at the coal-face, an area of light 15ft. by 10ft.,
and weighs, with the battery, 2jib. It is a cap
lamp, and both the cap and battery are locked, so
that it is practically foolproof, and would not cause
an explosion if it were to fall or receive other rough
usage.
All this, of course, does not affect the nature of
the disease. As mentioned just now, we have to go
deeper than the illumination of the working place
to find the cause of the trouble. Presumably the
illumination of workings is not worse now than it
was before the war; yet alike in Britain, Belgium
and Australia the exceptional prevalence of the
trouble is noted. This is not, certainly, proof that
the disease is an affection of the nerves, but it con-
firms those who have long been of that opinion.
“G. Arden Hill” on mine-ventilation: —
Giving evidence at Wollongong (N.S.W.), re the
alleged danger arising from the use of electric-
cutters at Mt. Ivembla and the presence of gas and
dust in that mine, William Humble, ex-chief-
inspector of N. S. Wales collieries, said that, after
the Mt. Kembla ex'plosion IS years ago, he discovered
10,060 ft. of gas in an enclosed heading in the col-
liery, due to ventilation being destroyed. “If
the ventilation at Kembla was deranged at the
present time,” he added, “some of the places would
become full of coal-gas. The same ventilation fur-
nace is now used as at the time of the explosion.”
He admitted that he knew that Hindmarsh (district
Government inspector) was referring to Kembla in
his 1918 report when he stated that two South Coast
mines needed ventilating shafts. “Doubtless, had I
the power,” said Mr. Humble, “I would have ordered
the construction of a ventilation shaft: it is because
of the limitation of the Act that I did not do so.”
Well, the sooner this limitation is ended the better.
1 It is a rotten state of affairs when the Government
can merely recommend and not insist upon things
deemed necessary to prevent another holocaust.

Hampton Gold Mining Areas, Ltd., formed
at the height of the recent boom to acquire
the interests of the disabled Hampton Uru-
guay Co., has issued a brief statement of its
expenditure to about the middle of June. In
part payment for the freehold of Block 4S
and other areas, £48,100 was paid, while
preliminary expenses took £2494. Out of
the balance of capital (£91,621), £lO,OOO had
been spent on prospecting and £2350 on
buildings, road-making, etc. Forty-one
leases were reserved by this co., but although
several looked like becoming valuable mines
a few months ago none shows much promise
now. The shares have been practically* un-
saleable in London for some time past.
Several attempts made to get rid of them in
Australia when they had fallen from a little
under 60s. to 38s. 9d.—they are now
nominally about 12s. 6d.—failed to locate
buyers. However, thousands were unloaded
by London while the rush was on, some
Perth, Kalgoorlie and Adelaide people getting
in at top prices. Apart from mining-lease
rents the co.’s principal source of revenue at
present is by way of royalty from fire-
wood cos., but if everything else fails it
may make a crust as a pastoral and grazing
concern.
*** , »
“O.B.”: One of the features of the recent
boom at Hampton Plains, Mt. Monger and
elsewhere was the display of ignorance (or
was it mostly dishonesty ?) in connection with
the publication of assay values. Repeatedly
managers announced good assays, but re-
frained from reporting, for public consump-
tion, that at the same time poor assays were
also got. In numerous instances not a word
was said as to the width of the bodies from
which the samples were obtained, yet often
they came from ore only a few inches across.
An assay is only of value in determining the
worth of any portion of a mine when the
width of the reef or lode, or, in the case of
drives, etc., the footage, is also given. If
such particulars do not accompany the pub-
lished assays, the public can take it for
granted that the people in control have some-
thing to. hide, or they don’t appreciate their
obligations to those who are financing opera-
tions.

It will not be surprising if veteran G. P.
Doolette, now in his 85th year, survives the
big mine over which he has presided for many
years. Gt. Boulder has a few years’ mill-feed
m sight, but its prospects of providing much
more are slight. Speaking at the annual
meeting m London, Doolette said that during
the past 12 months the co. had had a very
rough passage in respect of b'oth labor and
supplies ; yet, though the mine was shut down
for months, it was able to show a profit of
£135.434. Owing to labor scarcity the co. has
not been able of late to do much exploration.
* * * »
One of the Adelaide cos. which bought a
delusion at Hampton Plains recently acquired
an option on the Crown and Anchor, near
Widgiemooltha (W.A.). Now comes the news
that the show “looks like a mine.” So did
a lot of others in the same district 20 years
ago; but while gold in varying quantities
was obtained in shallow ground, all failed
at depth.
* * * *
“O.B.”: Unfortunately “some of the
croakers” referred to by “R. 8.” (B.
5/8/’2O) didn’t croak early enoueh about the
Lass o’ Gowrie, Mt. Monger (W.A.). If
they had, an impudent flotation might have
been prevented. The “rich shoot” on which
the co. was floated is a gold-splashed chloride
schist body with a total length, judging from
what the writer could see in the prospectors’
blowhole, of under a dozen feet. If it was
otherwise, why was no attempt made to
follow the shoot when it passed out of the
shaft? State-expert Blatchford, who in-
spected the Mt. Monger field on behalf of the
Government, had a good deal to say about
the non-permanent character of its ore de-
posits ; but not all the hard things he wrote
in his report found their way into print.
As for the “new development'’ mentioned
by “R. 8.,” the market is showing no interest
whatever in the values published.

Melbourne apparently regards New Guinea
Copper as a mining cert, for the 20s. shares
have gone to a premium of 12s. 6d. The New
Guinea is really a re-incarnation of Great
Fitzroy. The Laloki (Papua) fell into the
lap of that co. when its Mt. Chalmers mine
would not yield up tractable ore, but
English interests became so 'wearied of the
whole thing that they put George Klug’s
hopeful report into the waste-paper basket.
Mt. Morgan picked it out, but the war scared
Niall and Casey. Fitzroy debenture-holders
then put their salvation in the hands of
David Lumsden, and he passed the whole
bag of tricks into the ever-willing arms of
J. L. Wharton. So emerged the Laloki
syndicate of 100,000 shares on which about
10s. per share has been paid to cover the
cost of Erie Huntley’s inspection and do
some development. The third stage is the
New Guinea Copper Mines, with £250,000 of
nominal capital in £1 shares. This float pro-
vides the Laloki people with 100,000 paids
and the right to take up and pay 7s. per
share on 75,000 contribs., leaving 75,000
shares in reserve. The Laloki formation is
pyritic: 41 p.e. iron, 42 p.c. sulphur, 5 p.c.
silica, with metal contents of 4.8 p.c. copper,
5 p.c. zinc and |oz. silver per ton. King
and Huntley avow that blister can be turned
out at £45 per ton, which, as labor and sup-
plies go to-day, is a pretty low estimate, un-
less the fuzzy-headed Papuan is to be enlisted
as a worker. Laloki and its offshoot,
Dubuna, are given 350.000 tons of ore of the
grade stated, so there is fair backing for the
furnaces.

Red, White and Blue (Bendigo)', having
got into the region of a big slide in its
southern workings at 1000 and 1700 feet, is
breaking better stone. A 2oz. crushing from
the rise at 470 ft. furnished Bendigo with a
mild thrill, but the run of highly mineralised
quartz is narrow. To help reserves the
spurry formation at 1600 ft. also carries a
shade more gold, so bigger yields may be pos-
sible, but the mine has disappointed so long
that the average Bendigo punter won’t take
much risk ahead of the pick. What the
development has done has been to give Walter
Eskdale a chance to float off a block of the
southern ground on old-fashioned Bendigo
lines: a small capital and the prospect of a
good many calls. New Red, White and
Blue was able to keep pretty well off the call
list last half-year, because it got £2700 of
gold premium. So long as money comes in
from that source there is always a chance of
the loyalists on the Red, White and Blue line
reporting an occasional dividend.

Instead of sluicing about 450,000 c. yd. in
six months as in normal times, Cock’s Pioneer
(Vic.) last half-year, through want of water,
handled only 254,000 yds. So the gold yield
dropped from 40220 z. to 22560 z. and the tin
output from 49 to 29 tons, thereby cutting
profits down to £2753. With the nozzles
now running a full head Hugh Falconer thinks
he can wash out returns equal to the best
average yet obtained at the mine. This will
be a pleasant variant from working stuff
one-third poorer than the usual grade, as he
has had to do when dealing with dirt in the
far end of the paddock. The real reason he
got into a tangle was that he was unable
through want of water to float his plant into
a new site, so from March on till the drought
broke he merely had to mark time to keep
his staff together. Still, Cock’s Pioneer isn’t
in want. It has liquid assets amounting to
£31,063 against debts of £13,995.

“Baree”: The Commonwealth Government
last year spent £5OOO on prospecting in the
Territory. It sent up a batch of Diggers
and carefully marked out the routes they were
to take. The programme included putting in
the wet season at the Daly River, where
mines have been worked for the last 40 years,
and they were set to find new claims on other
ground prospected by whites and Chinese for
nearly half a century. They were sup-
posed to test claims below the water-level,
but were not equipped with the necessary
appliances. They were not allowed to devi-
ate one inch from the prescribed routine.
Naturally, they have found no new claims;
they have done no useful work; and the
£5OOO is an absolute loss to the Common-
wealth. But the mining fields of the N.T.
will be condemned on the reports submitted
by these men, who were so tied by red-
tape that they could do absolutely nothing,
though all were willing to prospect on un-
worked fields.
* * ' # »
The Royal George (Tas.), operating a
large dyke-like formation which averages
about $ p.c. tin, was worked at a loss during
the year ended April, and four sixpenny calls
were necessary. Owing to excessive \yorking
costs little actual production was done dur-
ing the period. Underground operations on
No. 2 level were somewhat handicapped by
irregularity and faulting of the ore deposit,
but arrangements are in hand for extending
the main shaft to open up another level,
which should secure ample tonnage for some
time to come. The mill was in operation
only three months, crushing 5322 tons for
oO tons oxide. The co. has installed a suction-
gas power-plant in place of its old costly
steam outfit.

Yet another crowd, the Waihi River Gold
Extraction Co., is to have a go at the accu-
Tvr r \ tailings in the Ohinemuri River
(ALL.). They seem payable on assay, but
so tar have not given a profit when handled.
1-he main trouble is the oncoming low-grade
cyanided slimes and tails from the big Waihi
mill, which mix with the older and richer
strata of tailings under any system of
removal so far suggested. The Waihi Co.,
though in the past liberating high-grade tail-
ings into this river, now boasts of a gold
extraction of about 9(1 p.c.

“Dolphin”: Several people are nibbling at
the idea of the distillation of Victorian
brown coal. As the result of facts and
figures put up by an English expert named
Creagh, who had experience of German
brown-coal works before the war, a Sydney
syndicate has sent a man abroad with a ton
or two of the Vic. goods in his excess bag-
gag'e. If it delivers the goods he will bring
a distillation plant as soon as he can
get it together. The syndicate is alleged to
an(^s on anything up to
±51)0,000. Creagh reckons that oil, wax,
pitch and other by-products worth up to ±2
a ton can be got out of the coal, and that
the residue should be worth 11s. a ton as
fuel which would be better than selling raw
coal delivered in Melbourne at 13s. a ton.

Joseph Botterill, dead at Mount Gambier
(S.A.) after an

tion, had sat in the
Leg. Council for

trict since John

He had moved the
adoption of th e
address-imreply in
the Council only a
few days before.
A quiet citizen with
wide experience of

States, he had
been in S.A. only
since the beginning
of the century, and

Dour, determined and versatile, Henry
Daglish has just faded out in W.A. Despair-
ing of his prospects in the Vic. Civil Service,
he threw up his fifth-class clerical job in the
office of the Chief of Police 24 years ago,
when he was .36, and had a try for the Leg.
Assembly in South Melbourne. He lost
his deposit, but as Tommy Bent, who was
also a candidate, met the same fate, he was
not downcast. Kicking the dust of Vic.
off his boots he betook himself to Groperland
in 1897. Four years later he induced Subiaco
to return him as a Laborite, won the leader-
ship, and in 1904 formed Westralia’s first
Labor Ministry. Of course he didn’t con-
tinue a Laborite; he could not be effectively
“eontrolled’f any more than Scaddan could
be later on. As nothing better was going he
was Chairman of Committees in the House
for three years, and then took a portfolio
in a so-called Liberal Administration. Nine
years ago he failed to secure re-election to
the House, and the ex-Laborite settled down
as employers’ representative in the State
Arbitration Court. Both State Houses paid
him the tribute of adjourning.
Gone down the river for good at 84, Cap-
tain Stewart Patrick, of Melbourne. He
spent 80 years on the bridges of Huddart
Parker excursion steamers, and had been so
long in shallow Port Phillip that he had
almost forgotten the lift and heave of blue
water. But he was quite familiar with the
lift and heave of the seasick excursionist.
“0.K.”: The woefully stodgy condition of
English art in the middle of last century
was expressed by the paintings of James
Clarke Waite, who died in Sydney the other
week. Waite, as a young man, won medals
at the Royal Academy Art. School, London,
and used to get his pictures hung annually
at the Royal Academy exhibition. When in
1886 he came to Melbourne to settle as a
man of 54, he brought a number of those
pictures with him, and even then it didn’t
take Melbourne long to realise that
the painter ha d
learned his busi-
ness in the Dark
Ages. II i s tech-
nique was what is
known as “sound”
and hi s imagina-
tion nil; there was
nothing of the
poet abo u t him.
nor any grace of
style, nor talent for
composition. Good
old Waite mostly
produced dra b-

that “tell a story,”
and a rather appal-
ling specimen of
the stodginess
hangs in bar-
room at Young

A Federal Gallery snapshot:—
Tudor’s new understudy, Matthew Charlton, a tall,
dour-looking personage with straight, rather satur-
nine brows, is one of the extreme moderates of the
party. In attention to his job he is as assiduous as
Tudor; and nobody could be more assiduous than
that. He will sit hour after hour with legs crossed
and arms folded, soaking in even his comrades’
dreary futilities, with a face that rarely knows the
relaxation of a smile. He is something of an enigma.
The passion that sometimes creeps into the top C
of his high-pitched discourse shatters your illusion
of his intense quiet, and you wonder if, after all,
he belongs to the boiling-iceberg class. In many
respects he is like Deputy-Governor Irvine: in fact,
they are almost twins in temperament. The remote-
ness that is Irvine’s is also Charlton’s, and there is
about both a Calvinistic severity which puts the
smoke-room raconteur outside the pale of their
acquaintance. Neither has often been guilty of a
joke: the sense of humor seems to have shrivelled
up in these dry, austere natures.
Walter Watt, who died last week at the
little old house in Double Bay where he
had spent most of his life, was like a benign
Dickens character come to life. No one
ever heard him utter a harsh word. No
one asked him for money, with the shadow
of a legitimate excuse for doing so, and
failed to get it. Many struggling people got
it in fifties and hundreds without asking.
That was apart altogether from his gifts
to public charities. Small, delicate-featured
and pale-faced, he looked too frail for strenu-
ous effort, yet he was the backbone of Gil-
christ, Watt and Sanderson, and he took an
active part in the affairs of a dozen other
big companies and in the management and
finances of the Union Club. He started in
business at 17. and for the following half-
century did an average of eight hours a day
on’ six days a week, lie leaves two nephews
in the firm (Ernest Watt and Oswald, the
flying-man), and a wife whom he married
late in life.
Pneumonia had the final say in the rest-
less career of G. E. Wheatley, of Perth.
For 20 years the Methodist Church had no
more successful parson on its S. Aus. and
Westralian circuits. And then, in middle
life, lie decided that he had mistaken his
vocationresigned from the ministry and
tried land-speculation; had a shot at politics
(unsuccessfully), and became partner in a
pub. That venture failing, he turned poli-
tical secretary and then press-agent, and
tiring of mundane things he went back to
the pulpit as a Congregational minister. But
in course of time he wearied of that, too,
and after a brief and fruitless attempt to
make money with a patent medicine of his
own invention, he entered the moving-pic-
ture business. It was the last phase. Talent
Wheatley had, but no stability, and that was
the tragedy of his life.
The Prince was gallant to the last. In
his final gallop on Randwick racecourse
Misses Bell and Allen and Edward, Mount-
batten and Ken Austin saddled up, and they
finished in that order. For these-exercises
Edward rolled up his sleeves and looked far
happier than when he was smothered in his
circus clothes.
“Jimmy” Campbell, K.C., whose find-
ings on the Coal Commission were presented
to the N. S. Wales Parliament last week,
has the biggest and most ornate vocabulary
at the Ma State Bar. He is the Samuel
Johnson of the profession. His average sen-
tence is about 150 words long, and he never
uses one syllable where three or four will
do nearly as well. Another remarkable
feature is his appearance of youth, lie has
looked somewhere between 45 and 50 for
the past quarter of a century.
JDaglish was Premier of Westralia for a
year and 15 days. The only .memorable
thing he did, apart from holding office, was
to gaol a journalist—Jack Drayton, then
editor of Ivalgoorlie Sun and still on deck
in Sydney—for contempt of Parliament.
Drayton had refused to answer a Select
Committee’s questions touching some now-
forgotten mining controversy, and, at the
Premier’s instance, Parliament decided that
this was an offence only to be expiated by
imprisonment. It was suggested that House
of Commons usages should be followed and
that the culprit should, be confined in the
clock-tower, but somebody pointed out that
the Westralian Parliament had no clock-
tower, and the proposal was dropped. Then
Daglish discovered that there was a suitable
spare room in the Comptroller’s quarters at
Fremantle prison, and this was hurriedly
cleaned out, furnished as a bed-sitting room
and stocked with cigars, whisky and bottled
beer for the guest and his visitors, and with
writing material to enable the victim
of oppression to hit back at a tyrannical
Government. It was a good jest while it
lasted, and it lasted a month.
W. J. Bickford, Adelaide’s patriarchal vet.,
has not long survived his return to his old
English home in Devon. After nearly half
a century of animal doctoring in S. Au.s. he
retired last year. Now news comes of his
death at 75.
After 49 years’ service as a schoolmaster
Thomas Stafford, of Clovelly (N.S.W.),
thinks he has had enough. He directed the
early steps of Tom Mutch, now Minister of
Education,' who went to .the school to say
“Thank you” before the veteran put away
his chalk and duster for good.
Concerning a fiery soul that has flickered
out.: —■
The vital spark of “Bullant” Mclntyre, of Southern
Cross (W.A.), has quit its mortal frame. For 20
years “Bullant” sprayed his enemies with vitriol
through the columns of his paper, the Southern
Cross Times. He was a chemist by profession, a
gold-seeker by inclination, and a journalist by in-
stinct. When his big heart let him he made money
as an apothecary, but it all went in backing pros-
pectors and in financing an unpayable newspaper—•
unpayable because at one time and another Mac
had lampooned three-fourths of the advertisers at
the Cross. Ills talent for general invective was
unexcelled in the West. He could carve up an
opponent with scientific precision, and if the victim
wanted fight he was always accommodated, for
although a mere featherweight and short-sighted at
that, “Bullant” feared nothing on two legs. Only
once did the baited quarry have the laugh on his
tormentor, and that was when Mac stood for the
mayoralty of Southern Cross (in Westralia the
mayoralty is an elective office), and the returning-'
officer was the local undertaker, one Snook. For
years Mclntyre had discharged his choicest shafts of
satire at the undertaker, whom he called “Snivel-
ling” Snook. Snook was no match for Mac at
repartee, and didn't attempt it, but he grimly awaited
an opportunity to get Jhis own back, and it came
at the mayoral election. For it so chanced that
“Bullant” tied with his opponent, and “Sniveller”
had to give a casting vote! On another occasion,
when the claims of mining and pharmaceutical
chemistry left him insufficient time for journalism,
Mac brought a pressman up from Berth and in-
stalled him in the editorial chair. But the experi-
ment didn’t last long, for the interesting pair quar-
relled, and, although their offices were separated
only by the width of a street, carried on all their
communications by post- Tiring of these formal
proceedings, the editor announced in the Times that
if persons having business with the paper didn’t
come to the proper office “instead of hanging round
the pill-shop over the way” he would name them.
He also complained that goats (Southern Cross is
famous for its goats) had a malignant habit of
devouring the “copy” of his leading article; but
when he went on to make playful remarks about the
coquetry of the Southern Cross ladies (he asserted
that the local leaders of fashion did their hair up
with bits of string) “Bullant” decided that it was
time to return to the Archimedean lever and dash
off a few more columns about “Snivelling” Snook.
In his last years Mac, disputing the accuracy of
his water-rate, invited the Department to send along
a collector to fight him for it. But nobody called.
The Cross will be a dead place without him.
The King Edward statue, which Adelaide
has at last got in position, was the idea of
Lewis Cohen, Mayor of the city in 1911.
who cancelled vari-
ous functions on the

tal. cost £6OOO. . The
figure proves to be
lost in clothes. From
a little distance it

a knobby top to the

The family of General John Gellibrand,
t'he new Commissioner of Police in Victoria,
had a very early connection with that State.
In 1827 J. T. Gellibrand and John Batman
applied to Governor Darling for permission
to settle at Westernport, and were refused.
Later Mr. Gellibrand was one of the Associa-
tion which sent Batman to Port Phillip to
make his treaty with the blacks; and when
.Batman had become settled, and members of
the association crossed the strait to inspect,
J. T. Gellibrand was one of the number.
George Long, one of Sydney’s oldest and
most useful trade-union officers, died a few
days ago, aged 75. He was a fellow-appren-
tice of J. P. Franki (managing director of
Mort’s Dock), the late T. Irons (manager
of the Clyde works) and Hector Kidd
(engineer of the C.S.R.). all of whom served
their time with the P. N. Russell firm; and
as representathm of his union on the Iron
Trades Council his old friendship with these
and other men had a good deal to do with
the smooth working of the industry. Long
was one of the leaders of the agitation to
have locos, built in Australia, and was
largely instrumental in having the first job
of the sort offered to the Clyde Engineering
Co.
It looks as if there will at last again be
a medical man in the Victorian Parliament.
J. R. Harris, physician and vigneron, has
a mortgage on the Uppah House seat held
by the late A. O. Sachse. He sides with
Hayseed.
A versatile young man is Thos. Lawton,
Queensland Rhodes Scholar for 1921. He
was with the 12th Field Artillery in France,
acquired his “blues” for football, cricket,
swimming and athletics, played with the
N. S. Wales Rugby Unionists against the All
Blacks, and is off now to M.L. with the Syd-
ney TJni. team. In his spare time he is a
second-year med. at Sydney Uni., and like
most Rhodes Scholars from Queensland
passed through Brisbane Grammar.
Matt Baird, Vic. Chief Sec., is going to
have a stiff fight at Ballarat West in a few
weeks. Brind, who was head of the local
Red Cross during the war. and is a distiller
at Warrenheip. has decided to nominate.
Lawson has been up to the ex-Golden City
to barrack for "his colleague—and feeling
probably that it would have been better for
him if he hadn’t been a colleague. Baird
served in the S. African and European wars,
and gained his majority; and the inclination
to do something extra for the Diggers led to
his appointment to a Ministerial job which
has too obviously been beyond him.
The name of Henry Bull comes down off
a Sydney signboard after well over half a
century. Its owner first appeared as a
retail draper on Brickfield Hill in 1868. In
the next decade he sold to Riley Brothers,
and started as a softgoods warehouseman in
Pitt-street, in one of two fine buildings
alongside the then new home of the City
Bank. Then came the big fire of 1890.
which swallowed up Bull and many others.
Bull moved into York-street, and afterwards
bought a corner of Market-street and York-
street and built up-to-date premises there.
Meanwhile he had acquired other properties,
including Ocean House, which has just been
passed in at £70,000, and Bull’s Chambers,
passed in at £52,250. No, it didn’t need a
war to put money in rags.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of all the types that walk the Block
The flapper has the pride of place.
She sports no sixty-guinea frock;
The furs her supple form that grace
Have cost much less than six weeks’ pay
For father; but in pride supreme,
With confidence no gibe can stay,
She passes with the social cream,
To bring to Grandma Grundy’s mind
The years of youth left far behind.
She has two boys to guard her well.
Her face is dimpled. Like a gale
Her laugh breaks out. Implacable
She sets her youth beside the pale
And slightly renovated charms
Of eager, elder-sister Kate;
A brace of bangles on her arms;
Her bustered hair is prim and straight.
For her*are frappes and the spices
That go with wondrous drinks and ices.
Her voice is loudest in the talk,
Her eyes like jewels blink and smile.
The proud, big lads that by her walk
Have no conception of her guile.
These came to life but yesterday,
And have no talent to deceive ;
She with them makes the simplest play
For she was in the world with Eve,
And Forty she will not allow
To shake the firmness of her brow.
She takes her tea with Tom or Bill.
The best is good enough for her.
Ice-cream with nougat; p’raps she will
Peach Melba or meringue prefer.
Then, touched with powder, sprayed with scent,
She puffs a tiny cigarette.
Oh, self-assured, contained, content,
You fill sage hearts with sore regret!
The paste-miss whom you So despise
Turns on you aching, hungry eyes.
Just yesterday you were a kid
Be-ribboned and absurdly curled,
Beholding man ’neath drooping lid ;
You’re now a woman of the world.
And scented roues drifting- near,
Appraising you with eyes profane,
Are broken by your tiny sneer,
And wilt before your pert disdain.
What slow man learns from Time’s hard page
Is your unstudied heritage!

The StvdeUker “Big Six"
—is the master car
A
CAR may be noted for its power. It may be celebrated for
the striking beauty of its lines and design, generally, and
the comfort and smartness of its appointments. It may be
attractive because it is an economical car keeping down running
cost and upkeep expenses.
Any one of these inducements is usually found sufficient by the
intending car-buyer to influence his purchase. What, then, shall be
said of the Studebaker “Big Six,” which represents not only a com-
bination of all of these important features, but actually emphasises
each and every one of them?
The “Bix Six” has been justly called “The Master Car.” That is a
fair claim. A master key will do what many other keys of different
pattern will do. A master car must do what many cars of different
make will do. The “Bix Six,” by the combined efficiency of its
many features, fulfils such an obligation.
That is how it earned the title of “The Master Car.”
"Big' Six” Special Features
126-inch wheelbase, with 36-horsepower Studebaker-designed
and Stude’baker-built demountable-head motor with two-range
carburetter, shock absorbers, artistic straight side slanting wind-
shield with ventilator base and integral corner lights, jewelled eight-
day clock, tonneau light with extension cord, Gypsy top with
rectangular plate-glass window in rear, 33 x 4£ inch Goodyear
Cord Tyres throughout, including spare.

B is at present occupying and which he
wanted to himself buy was bought over his
head by G. C has been living in a house of
his own; but, in expectation of getting
prompt possession of B’s house, he rashly
sold his residence to D, and D is one of
the sort who wants possession on the due
date, otherwise he will cry the deal off. So
C has been calling on me (A) to know if I
will be good enough to hurry out of my (A)
residence and hand it over to B—who isn’t
in any particular hurry—so that he (C)
can let the inflexible D in. And that’s as
far as I care to trace the collision. Behind
D, I presume, a maddened queue extends
right round Australia —perhaps right round
the globe. I have the uncomfortable feeling
that by lingering where I am I may be keep-
ing some shivering Greenlander out of the
ice-hut he has had his frozen-fish eye on
through three long Polar winters. At inter-
vals I go out and get drunk and try to
forget it and the Sydney bricklayers who

“Dido”: Conan Doyle is bringing a sort
of vegetable theory of ghosts to Australia.
His idea of .the ordinary spook is that it is
what he calls a “thought form” shed by some
individual in a moment of intense emotion,
and remaining visible on the spot identified
with the deep feeling. We have, it seems,
form within form, as an onion has layers.
We shed a skin with each thought form,
“and our track through life is marked in
its more emotional crises by a long trail of
such forms.” Which implies that one man
may leave behind him a whole regiment of
spooks visible to the mediumistic eye. Doyle
may yet make a spiritualist of “Sherlock
Holmes and start him tracking the criminal
human onion from layer to layer, much as
he might track a snake by its cast-off skins.
“T. 0.1.”: The Oxford Hotel is threatened
with loss of its ticket by the Licenses Reduc-
tion Board. The building Has been a land-
mark of Sydney since the earliest days of the
diggings, but has not always been given up
to the Curse. When Sydney was in the hands
of Commissioners, after the incompetent first
Council had been wiped out, a part of the
building was used as the Town Ilall; indeed,
it was still used as such when a Council was
re-established in !Sp7 with George Thorn-
ton as Mayor. At another time it was the
headquarters of the education system of the
State. In 1868, John Hampton, who had
been a balloonist in England, obtained a
license for the premises and named them The
Oxford. After him came William Gannon,
well known on the turf, w r ho later had
Petty’s; and after him again Tom Curran,
who subsequently went to England and
became an Irish Home Rule M.P.
“O.Iv.”: The death was mentioned last
week, in Melbourne, of Mrs. Slack, “widow
of a noted Victorian bookmaker of 50 years
ago.” This must, > I think, have been the
Slack whose death provided a tragic story.
Slack, a South Melbourne identity, died a
violent death, and nobody was charged with
it. Now, it happened that presently a noted
housebreaker was sentenced to a long term,
and his mind more or less giving away he
got into the habit of maundering. Sitting in
his cell one day he soliloquised so audibly
that a warder listened, and brought a mate
to listen with him. The demoralised bur-
glar was saying to himself, “Yes, I killed
old Slack.” And he went a little into details.
The matter was re-investigated and the idea
that Slack had been murdered by this man
proved correct. And, if I remember rightly,
the housebreaker who had mused over his
capital offence was duly hanged for it.

“Sixenate”: A revised version of “The
Taming of the Screwed” has been staged in
a Sydney suburb. The morning
after the night before Blank awoke
to find himself well and unfaithfully
sewn up in his blankets, so that he
was unable to move. The wife af-
rived in answer to his infuriated
calls, but there was a grim look in
her eyes and she fondled a copper-
stick. “You hit me last night,” the
lady said, “and now I’m going to
hit you.” And she belted away at
her lord and master till his angry
oaths changed to entreaties, and,
bruised and sore, he promised never
to lift his hand to her again. Then
his wife collected her small family
and went home to mother for a fort-
night, leaving him to work his way
out of the blankets as best he could.
Blank still gets drunk, but he does
it furtively and unhappily, like a
man who anticipates the horrors.
“Community singing” is an American idea
which Adelaide is the first city in Australia
to introduce. The experiment is to be started
immediately, with half-hour lunch-time ses-
sions in the Town Hall; everybody invited,
and everybody who cares may take part. A
song-book compiled by Walford Davies, an
English professor and brother of the head
of Adelaide Uni. Conservatorium, is to be
used. At the first sitting this week John
Dempster is to conduct, with Daltry at the
piano and. T. H. Jones at the organ. Many
other musical men are helping the movement,
which has behind it the W.E.A., the
Y.M.C.A., and other bodies. Mrs. Kate
Helen Weston, the novelist, is hon. sec.
“Callan Park” confesses to a murder:—
Some weeks ago my wife’s year-old and intolerable
Maltese poodle, Digger, gave at the hind legs and
went off his food. I hoped it was tick-poisoning.
Then something happened to his small, truculent
eyes. They practically closed up. Could it be
distemper? The thing seemed too good to be true.
Judge of my despair when he turned the corner and
threatened to become his old, selfish, intrusive and
gluttonous self again.
An idea struck me. The Prince had proclaimed
himself an animal-lover: my wife is a passionate
loyalist. I explained that the cause of Empire called
for the sacrifice of Digger. Weeping she acquiesced,
and proceeded to pack his luggage. I have often
wondered since what they thought of his kit aboard
the Renown. Some items were a pillow, a jar of
eye-ointment, cotton-wool for swabbing his eyes
with warm milk, a large bottle of tonic to be
administered thrice daily, a small bottle of castor-
oil, scissors for clipping his ankles, a comb and
hair-brush, a padded cane chair for use during
the day, and an eiderdown quilt on which he was
to sleep at the foot of the Prince’s bed at night, a
list of his favorite dishes and the correct method of
preparing them, two cakes of anti-vermin soap—-
A FELINE PRIVILEGE.
THE ASKED: “I teas invited to all the functions to see the Prince.”
THE UNASKED: “ Naturally. They remembered who may look at a king.”
these and many other articles went on board the
warship with him. None of them came back. The
inference drawn by our friends is that they were
thrown into the harbor.
The Prince happened to be up-country when our
gift arrived. The newspapers had hardly made
known his return before a letter arrived from Lieut.-
Colonel Grigg. “His Royal Highness,” the -Colonel
wrote, “is charmed with the beautiful dog which
you have been good enough to send him. He has
longed to possess one of this breed for years. He
feels, however, tl\at it would be unfair to remove the
dog, obviously a pedigree animal, from his bewitch-
ing native land, and unkind' to deprive you of his
company.” An A. 8., who had been valeting Digger,
would, we were informed, return him to us “with
all possible despatch.” An hour or so later an
irritable scream at the front gate denoted the
wanderer’s return. He was dancing round a
sheepish-looking seaman, who was having difficulties
with the latch. I observed, to my horror, that he
was the picture of noisy and vigorous health. The
hard life of the fo’c’s’le had built him up where
medicines and loving care had availed only to make
him wobbly and bloated.
Slowly, regretfully, for mine is a humane disposi-
tion, I walked to the chemist’s for a shilling's-worth
of dog-poison.
AFRAID TO CHANCE IT.
“I’m -surprised at you lathing ivith that
Hamilton girl; she’s a regular bad egg.”
“I know, dear; that’s why I’m frightened
to drop her.”
“Dido’’: A tragedy in flat life was enacted
in the big red establishment up the street
one night recently. Mrs. Flatting’s sus-
picions had been aroused by the frequent
furtive visits of a slim young man with
butter-colored hair to the flat across the
corridor when Mrs. Other’s husband, who is
a country traveller for a city drygoods firm,
was absent. One night at about a quarter
to nine Mrs. Flatting, drawn that way by
a gentle knock, saw the slim lad with the
cream-cheese hair slyly admitted to No. 9.
Then followed a silence lasting perhaps
three-quarters of an hour, broken eventually
by a bounding step on the stairs, the bump
of a loaded gripsack, a peremptory knock
and a joyous but ungrammatical voice say-
ing “It’s me, Alice!” Mrs. Flatting saw
Mr. Other, unexpectedly returned from
the wilds, standing on the mat at No. 9
awaiting admission. Alice was slow to
respond, and when she opened the door Mrs.
Flatting noted the pallor of her cheek. Once
more'the door at No. 9 was closed, and again
silence; but this time for not more than
10 minutes, and then a scuffle of feet on
the stairs, the dumping of a body and a
knocking on the door of No. 9. Mrs.
Flatting saw Mrs. Other open her door,
paler-faced than ever, and look down with
blank consternation at the young man with
butter-colored hair, lying unconscious at her
feet, while the tram-conductor —one of five
who had carried him upstairs—said: “Your
’usband, mum. We saw him fall from the
winder-sill.”
From the mess-room of one of them: —
Those responsible for the development of Australia’s
nationally-owned steamship line are making a good
effort to train for it officers of Australian birth.
The youngsters start as apprentices, and after a
four-year course will take their examinations and
go for their tickets. The course consists of two
years on the training windjammer Shandon, where
the apprentices are taught the rudiments of sea-
manship. That course completed, they are trans-
ferred to one of the steamships for two years more,
to study all the things necessary to equip one for
the mastery of a boat. The pay of the apprentice
is low ; nevertheless he seems to relish the situation,
as it is the forerunner of a “career.” At present
the sailing-ship Shandon has 12 apprentices on her
articles. The rest are on the s.s. Carina. The
latter don’t have much time to waste, for they have
to get theoretical instruction as well as perform
usual seaman’s duty. From 2 to 3 p.m. signal in-
struction is given by the second officer. From 4to
5 p.m. they receive instruction from the captain in
navigation. Every Friday from 6 to 8 p.m. the
captain demonstrates the development of ship-
building and the theoretical basis of construction.
There is this significant item in their programme:
“Saturday, 1 to 3 p.m., wash clothes.” But,
though the training is thus thorough, the appren-
tices are housed in sffaeious quarters on the boat-deck
amidships. On Sunday they have their dinner in
the saloon; their other meals are taken in a mess-
room attached to their quarters. Their morals are
not neglected, and under no circumstances are they
allowed to sleep away from the ship, except at their
home port.
The Hughes “justice, not mercy,” story
has become a hardy annual. It is again
blossoming in Melbourne. The latest is that
it happened when Hughes was last time in
London. As a matter of fact the incident
occurred when Hughes was Minister for
External Affairs in the first Watson Govern-
ment. Following the custom of new Min-
isters, he had his photograph taken. “What
do you think of it?” he asked of Atlee Hunt,
the Secretary to the Department. “Keally,”
said the official with his best polish and
urbanity, “I do not think it does you jus-
tice, sir.” “It’s not justice I want,” said
Hughes; “it’s mercy.” That was 16 years
ago; and certainly conditions have not
altered since.

THE FICKLE FRIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Arm in arm with my friend Youth
I go laughing through life’s fair;
•What is false and what is truth
We don’t know, nor greatly care.
Touch the dross and it is gold;
Sing, and all the stars dance mad ;
Though the mournful, grey-lipped old
Vow life is sad.
We don’t find it so—we dance
To the breeze’s magic time;
As we smile the babe Romance
Answers us in silver rhyme;
For us are the moonlit skies,
And the sun’s red torch we claim;
For us God made great blue eyes
And lips of flame.
We two work with mighty will,
Finding payment in our mirth;
We two scale the highest hill
That e’er soared to leave the earth;
Naught care we for what he thinks,
Laugh we at the words they say—
Subtle as the smiling Sphinx
We go on our way.
But when in the dreadful dark,
Youth lies sleeping, dark forms come,
With cold eyes and jawbones stark,
Speaking though their tongues are dumb ;
These then ask me where my strength,
What will for my loss atone,
When Youth wearies and at length
Leaves me —alone !

S.S. : Two men, once well known in
Australian theatrical management, had taken
a co. to Maoriland. At one three-night pitch
in the North Island, they went to
OBrownn’s hotel—they had to. O’Brownn
was painfully particular, and insisted on
segregation of the sexes. “I dunno whether
y re married or whether y’re not married ”
said O’Brownn, “and till me mind’s settled

able neighborhood, and I’m a rispictable

O Brownn had to be obeyed. On the second
day the manager heard something on the
strict Q.T., and went straight to O’Brownn.

War-correspondent Harry Gullett is one of
the observers who have no faith in the ideal-

across the hungry country whereon the
dreamers of dreams want the future Rachels

“Chesapeake” puts his money on Israel: —
There seems to be a general impression that the
Jews will not go back to Palestine. Even the Jews
m fun define a Zionist as “one who wants his
fellow-Jews to go to Palestine.” But it would be a
mistake to think they are anything but in earnest,
and they’ve got the brains and the men and won’t
have any difficulty in raising the cash.
Dr. Weizmann, the leader, is like a prophet of
old, and attracts to himself the best type of young
Jew. If he decides, as is quite likely, to make his
home in Palestine, he will take with him many who
will be missed not only from Whitechapel, but from
Mayfair, too. He is in private life a brilliant

research chemist who is said to have handed over to
the British Government a valuable discovery of his
which had an important bearing on munitions. When
asked to name his reward, the story runs, he said,
“My country for my people,” and he got it. He
has also his fair share of the racial characteristic
of dealing with men according to their ways.
When he met at breakfast for the first time Balfour
and Lloyd George, he talked metaphysics to the
former and Welsh Sunday-schools to the latter.
Whether Weizmann goes or not he and his assist-
ants are doing more hard-thinking and making more
elaborate plans and arrangements for settling Pales-
tine than ever before went to the founding of a
new State. For instance, they have decided
that Palestine must be soundly based on agri-
culture. This decided, they have searched history
and consulted experts in theory and in practice.
They have found plenty of Jewish agricultural
laborers in Russia who are not only able to work
land but are anxious to do it in Palestine. But the
Zionists don’t forget that the land problem in
Palestine is largely one of irrigation, and that
these men will have to re-learn their jobs. So they
have again taken expert advice, and one scheme—
that of a practical engineer who had worked in
the East is to settle Palestine and pay a profit
of 15 per cent!

“Percy P.” : Speaking of flat life, the most
damaging evidence produced in a recent
divorce case was supplied by the owner of
a flat adjoining that in which the respondent
entertained the co-re. It appeared that she
heard their shameless voices quite plainly,
and saw various things quite plainly. There
aie flats like that in Sydney. A friend of
mine who rented one tells me that the scan-
dal which penetrated the walls on either
side made him feel that he was being made
a potential witness in divorce proceedings.
And it occurred to him that the people on
the far side might hear the voices too, and
mistakenly associate him with the revels. He

from foreign parts. The head tax for going
into the U.S.A. was then 16s. Bd. -To-day
it is eight dahlars, or £2 2s. at present ex-

being on the other side of the continent, one
won t notice the sarcasm on landing in
4 risco. Why shouldn’t Australia charge
i lohibition orators and other interfering
parrots a fiver for coming to this land, which
is good, but neither free nor very brave?
“Fag”: My friend the baker had just:
buried his second, and was lapping up his
mutton-broth in a gloomy fashion. With
the idea of proffering consolation I observed
that she was a fine woman. “Yairs,” he
admitted, with the air of one who was
manfully bearing up against a crushing load
of sorrow, “but she’s gorn an’ left the
pianner to a niece of ’ers in Victoria. An’ I
gave ’er three quid a week for the ’ouse-
keepin’ .reggalar, and she often gotter cup-
pier quid extra w’en
she wanted i t.”
Whereat h e ordered
tripe and onions and
hid his grief-stricken
features in a mug of
te a. “Yer kn o w,”
proceeded the
widower, toying with
the stewed tripe, “she
must ha’ been a bit
older than she told me
she was. Found a
bottle of ’air-dye w’en
I was goin’ through
’er things. An’ she
willed the chest o’
drors in the spare
room to ’er sister-in-
law at Broken Hill.”
Here his speech was
stifled by sorrow—or
it may have been an
extra large allotment
of tripe. “Wimmen
are fair break-ups,”
continued the bereaved
one, meditatively.
“The longer yer live
with ’em the less y’
understand ’em. I’ve
’ad two, an’ they
both ’ad the loan
o’ me leg. Never
again, cobber! I’ve
done with the lot of
’em.” But when he
had finished his tripe
he remarked that the
waitress was a likely-
lookin’ sort o’ tart, and before he had com-
pleted a converging movement on the apple-
pie that sprightly young person had pro-
mised (1) to push his face in, (2) to tell
her boy all about it, and (3) to accompany
him to the' pitchers. Man, like woman, is
an uncertain animal.

“Whitehall” : Writers in Australian papers
are suggesting that bitter sectarianism isn’t
anything to be ashamed of because England
has it. One the other day wrote that this
hatred of R.C.’s in the Cold Land “did more
than* anything else to make impossible a
rational and honorable settlement of the Irish
Question,’Vahd he went on to tell about the
dreadful time R.C. boys have in English
public schools. The “argument” is as hol-
low as the groan of a sectarian spook ought
to be. For nearly a century R.C.’s have
had their own public schools in England—
Beaumont, Stonyhurst, Downside, The
Oratory (Newman’s foundation), and a
score of smaller places. Hence R.C.’s are as
rare at Harrow or Winchester as they are at
Newington or Wesley College. The English
Catholic of the public-sehoolgoing class
first begins to work side by side with Pro-
testants when he goes to the University.
There is so little hostility to any religion at
Oxford or Cambridge that it is possible to
spend years at either without knowings what
faith one’s nearest neighbor professes. Such
feeling as there is—and it is purely social—
takes the form of a mild distaste for Non-
conformists. It has to be remembered that
in England—as distinguished from Ireland-
many of the great R.C. families (the Tal-
bots, Howards, Butes, Stourtons, Frasers of
Lovat, and so on) are anti- Home Rulers. The
late Duke of Norfolk (premier Duke of
England and head of the R.C.’s of Britain)
was one of its bitterest opponents; and
Lord Edmund Talbot, M.P., uncle and
guardian of the present Duke, has been a
Unionist all his life. Far from Home Rule
having been hindered on religious grounds
m England it was always the Radical Non-
conformists there who supported it. Eng-
land has its faults, but it is a good many
years since religious bigotry was one of
them; and if we want an excuse for our
own we shall have to look somewhere else.

especially for women audiences. The Antis go about
their campaign in another way. First they approach
the newspapers and ask if they may have support
in their “fight for right.” Told the columns are
free to them as to the others for “news,” but that
propaganda matter is strictly biz, they try to wriggle
in the latter in the form of letters to the editor, or
reprints of what somebody or other said against

“Yes, me golden wedding, you might say, y’r

“Dolphin”: The remarks of “Karee” (B.
29/7/’2O) about the Egyptian affinities traceable in
the ancient civilisation of Central America support
my theory (or, rather, Professor Elliot Smith’s)
about the spread of the “heliolithic” culture round
the world some time b.c. But the Professor reckons
that it spread from Egypt to America rather than
from America to Egypt, as “Karee” thinks; and if
it came to Egypt “over the western waters,” that
knocks out the idea that it travelled through Torres
Straits or “via India per the Nagas.” Admittedly
there is evidence of pre-Columbian movements
across the Atlantic, apart from the Norse visits to
America. Columbus and his companions remarked
on the resemblance of the inhabitants of the islands
which they first visited in the West Indies to the
Guanches of the Canaries, who were also given to
mummification and other Egyptian practices. And
skulls from caves in the Bahamas are almost identical,
in point or measurement, anyhow, with Guanche
skulls. But in view of all we know about the
active navigation of the Indian Ocean in very early
days, by Phoenicians and others, it seems more likely
that the current set from west to east rather than
that navigators worked westward across the Pacific
from Central America. The very distribution of
land and sea favors the former supposition. Off the
Western Coast of the Americas, North and South, is
a broad belt of almost empty ocean. For 2000 miles
or so there are only a few stray groups of islands,
such as the Galapagos and Juan Fernandez, and these
show no evidence of having ever been inhabited in
pre-historie times. But from South-eastern Asia
(which can be reached by a coasting voyage from
the lied Sea) the voyager is led on from island to
island and from group to group till he is far out
m the Pacific. And beyond that any vessel driven
fiJr enough to the eastward would have to strike
the coast of America somewhere between Behring’s
Straits and Cape Horn unless it were driven south-
ward below the Horn. A vessel driven off the West
Coast of America would have a much poorer chance
of making a landfall-
Mulga”: After many experiments, made

sheep-runs, where the jetting process has been tried
instead of crutching. It is a long way more
economical than crutching, too.

‘AYart”: “J.G.” (B. S/7/’2O) states that
pise houses will not last in Australia.. Rot! Fer-
dinand Riva, a Launceston watchmaker, built a vise
house m Lyttelton-street 60 years ago. The clever
people gave the “mud house” six months —until
the first heavy rain came. But the walls are as
solid and dry to-day as when they were put up
Archdeacon Hales owned and lived in the house
tor many years. And if pise will last in the Speck
it. wGU last m any mart of Australia.

“\\ erri-mee” : "Moonyah ’ (B. 15/ </’2O)
says that a greatly-annoyed black snake in a hole
bit himself and was soon dead. I have often seen
a black snake (it was always a black) bite himself
when injured and tormented into a frenzy, but none
ever died in my presence unless I helped with a
stick. Snake experts, who have experimented for
yeais and in all seasons with our most deadly rep-
tiles, say that snake venom is not fatal to snakes—
or to lizards, either.
* *
“W. Blister”: I support “Tix” (B.
l/7/’2O) in his contention that Tom Jones was one
of the best horsemen that ever put foot in a stirrup.
1 at Cobham Lake Hotel when the cattle-dog in-
cident occurred. One of Jones’s pupils was George
Wickie (half-caste), for some years the best all-
round horseman in the Riverina district. At Wagga
~ lckie put up a performance never approached in
hat locality. To rescue two imprisoned horses, he
entered a burning stable, through an opening about
. t- by 3ft., and about 3ft. from the ground. ’Mount-
ing one of the animals, without saddle or bridle, lie
forced it out through the opening. He then attempted
o return to the rescue of the remaining horse, but
was prevented from doing so by the onlookers. It
was more than superb courage: considering the size
and position of the opening, it was super-superb
hoisemanship.
* * * *
‘‘A J .S.” : Here is a variation of tint
method given by “Cape Pork” (B. S/7/’2O of cal-
culating the superficial feet in a log. Square the
girth and multiply the result by the length
of the log. Deduct one-quarter for waste, and
there you are. For example, a 16ft. log,
girth sft., contains 400 ft. gross measurement,
300 ft. net. And, by the way, if any house-
holder, finding it necessary to calculate the
capacity of his tanks, wishes to stall off an
attack of brain fever, he may apply the same
rule slightly modified. Square the girth,
multiply by the depth, and divide the result
by two. This will give the capacity in
gallons. P.S. —But don’t try it on a square
tank.
“Yacko”: We tried a new way of killing
a pig. After shooting and sticking him we laid
him on a gridiron made of harrows raised on kero-
sene-cases, and set fire to the dry straw, twigs and
reeds placed beneath. After a good burning the
skm was very black and peeled easily. We turned
him and repeated the process. When scraped, brushed
down with a hard broom and wiped with a damp
cloth, he was as well done he would have been
by the orthodox method of scalding, and in half
the time.

Cr. Casey : The oldest sheep I’ve met was
one I shore at Tinenburra (Q.) — a black wether
aged 16 years. The old fellow didn’t, however,
live to be parted from another winter overcoat.
■'/' * * * *
Te YY hare”: A shark (blue pointer, I
think) lately captured off a N. S. Wales South
Coast wharf had a sucking-fish attached to its belly.
The sucking disc is situated on the top of the
creature’s head, and with this organ the parasite
holds on like a squid does to the calf of one’s
} tS co l or is dark brown > and the length about
. bin. The parasite does not, apparently, prev
oil its host, but merely uses the latter as a loco
motive. The sucking-fishes are quite able to exist
alone, and themselves prey on smaller fry.
“Cudgewa”: If “Kenrie” (B. 29/7/’2O)
hasn’t stifled the discussion on post-planting records,
may I butt in? I have a two-acre allotment of
soft volcanic soil, fenced with eight wires. Lately
the four corner-posts wanted renewing, I put on
the local champion (said to be a cousin of Alf
Parsons), and he slipped through the job in 12 days!
THE HORSE THAT DID Al KNOW WHEN TO STOP.
Hee, hee, lice! You blerry fool — I'm off long ago!”
“J.H.Pv”: Rca white women overlanding
from Queensland to Northern Territory (B. 15/7/’2O).
Correspondents have so far not mentioned Mrs.
Favenc, who travelled with her husband and party
from Queensland via the head of the Macarthur
Kiver to the O.T. line. This was about 1882. The
ladies mentioned by previous correspondents all had
the benefit of a well-defined track. The route
taken by Mrs. Favenc and party was trackless, and
mostly unknown. The husband was afterwards a
well-known Bulletin, writer and author of “The
Last of Six.”
“Jimsey”: “FY7” (B. 5/8/’2O) displays
a woeful lack of knowledge of the subject in hand
and of dogs in general. That a dingo borrows a
half-grown pup from a lady friend to act as guardian
of her own pups while she is away foraging is well
known, and is a fact accepted by every bushman.
Has “FY7” ever seen a dingo? Doesn't he know
that the dingo hunts in a pack, and that except at
meal-times very little “scrapping”' goes on? “FY7”
also says that the pups would make for cover if
taken out of their log. Quite right—they would,
if taken out . But as, after all, the dingo pup is
only a pup, he loves a frolic in the sun, and as he is,
when young, a friendly little cuss, he would quickly
get into danger if not looked after; The statement
that a litter of assorted shapes and sizes would 'show
cross-breeding, harking back to half a dozen different
types of ancestors, is simply ridiculous. The dingo
will not inter-breed with any other animal, not
even with the domesticated hound.
“Yanko Bill”: When cleaning a 61b. Mur-
ray cod to-night I was astonished to find, coiled
comfy within his mussel-box, a brown snake measur-
ing Ift. 7in. I showed it to my daughter cetat 23.
She yawned and said, “Good gracious! Reminds one
of the chap in the Bible who swallowed a whale or
something.” Shock the second for poor dad.
“Pick” : “Zanthus,” arguing (B. 29/7/’2O)
that attempts to breed black sheep have always
proved failures, arrives somewhat late to dispute
Jacob’s achievements at Padan-Aram. But there
are more modern instances. At Tumut (N.S.W.)
some years ago thousands of black sheep were bred
by an owner with that hobby; and the same is
being done at Bunberiy (same State) at present.
There’s nothing impossible or unnatural about it.
It is simply a matter of breeding one particular
class or color long enough to wear out the throw-
back. A friend of mine on the N.S.W. south coast
had a valuable Gordon setter slut which on one
occasion became accidentally mated with a cattle
dog. In subsequent seasons, by careful housing, the
lady . was compelled to mother only legitimate setters ;
but it took many years to quite eliminate the taint
of the collie breed.
* * * *
‘Hemp”: The man who has brains enough
to invent a simple, reliable, non-leg-breaking rabbit-
trap will be a public benefactor. Incidentally, he
will make a fortune. The chiei weapons used
against bunny at present are poison and spring traps.
Catching him with the latter may be effective;
it is certainly not humane. Bunny treads on a
steel plate. The jaws snap up and catch him by
a Fg, perhaps two legs. Occasionally he sticks his
nose down and is caught by that. He gets a devil
of a fright, and makes a mad rush to get away.
The peg holds the trap, and the trap holds brer
rabbit. The chances are the jolt has broken his
leg, and there he stays until somebody calls for him,
unless he pulls his leg off and leaves it in the trap,
or until he dies—and the latter is a slow process.
Sometimes he doesn’t get caught at all; his place
may be taken by a bird, cat, dog or other creature
whose luck is out at the time. The average cocky
has no reason to love the rabbit; but let some
shrewd-head come forward with a trap that will
do the work in a more civilised manner, and he
will find farmers and others waiting to welcome it.
* * * *
“De La Poer”: A few weeks ago, while
fishing, I caught a turtle on a line, and promptly
killed him by completely severing his head from his
body. Two hours later, when I returned to have a
look at my lines, Tommy Turtle’s heart was still
beating. Anybody know how much longer it would
continue in business ?
“Leo Lear”: “Monyah” asserts (B.
8/7/’2O) that native bears as pets spread diseases,
notably diphtheria and consumption. I don’t know
anything about that, but I do know that it is almost
impossible to keep Norman Lindsay’s friend as a
pet. They will live for a few months in captivity—
and most affectionate and lovable animals they are—
but then pine away and die. I gave up trying, as
the experiment always ended fatally, even when the
subject was fed with natural food. Has any Abo.
kept a koala for more than six months in captivity?
Bears in the forests of S.-W. Vic. are almost
extinct. Bush fires are their greatest enemies, as
the smoke and furnace-heated air soon topple Billy
Bluegum off his perch in the leaves.
A CONNOISSEUR.
TRAVELLER: " Can you direct me to your best
hotel?"
OLDEST-RESIDENT : “Well, mister, I’ve been
drinking at them all for 50 years, and
I ain’t made up my mind yet — they’re
all good.”
“Forester”: Up at Winnaleah (Tas.) the
blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon) has developed a new
habit. Where land has been cleared and the tree-
ferns left standing, the blackwood seeds germinate
on the trunks of the ferns and the young trees
grow there, sending roots down to the ground. Some
of them have roots three or four inches in diameter
running down the outside of a tree-fern trunk. I
have never noticed them doing this anywhere else.

Objects for which the Company is being formed.
The Company is to be registered under “The Companies Act 1892 ” for the purpose (inter alia)
of purchasing and acquiring the business, plant and machinery of every description goodwill, office
furniture, fittings and effects, business secrets, formulas and the like at present owned and used m the
manufacture of Linseed Oil, both raw and boiled, Linseed Ileal and Concentrated Cattle Food by
Herbert John Storey and Sydney Frederick Fotheringham ( The Vendors ) trading as Storey and
Fotheringham,” at Pinda Street, Kilkenny, in the State of South Australia, also the benefit of aU
pending agreements, leases and contracts held by the Vendors at the date of the Company entering into
a Contract for the sale and purchase with the Vendors. .
The Company to secure premises of its own on suitable sites m Victoria and South Australia,
close to the seaboard and railway, to facilitate and reduce the cost of transport to and from the Mills
To manufacture Linseed Oil, Linseed Cake and Meal, Concentrated Cattle Food, Cocoanut Oil, and
to further extend the operations of the Company as the Directors may from time to time determine.
To establish Flax Mills and encourage m every way the growing of Flax in Victoria and South
Australia. (Commonwealth Government sold 14 tons Hax Fibre in open market for £320. See
“Garden and Field,” June 1920). . ... .
To insta] up-to-date Machinery and Plant at the earliest possible moment.
With present Machinery, Manager estimates cost of treating one ton of Seed at £2, but with
mod Ther“ aC a h re e no in Australia 'except in New South Wales, and the profitable-
ness gauged from a perusal of the Balance Sheet of Meggitts Ltd., for 1919
A Balance Sheet of the business of Messrs. Storey & Fotheringham for the first four months of
their operations can be seen at the Office of the Secretary (pro tem.) or at the Office of the Com-
pany’s Solicitor. This shows that notwithstanding the difficulties inherent in establishing a new
industry that a handsome profit has been made. , , ,
Western Australia imported in one year 89,766 gallons of Linseed Oil from Eastern States and
oversea, and the difference in freight as between Sydney and Fremantle and Adelaide and Fremantle is
4d ‘ One of U the most valuable advantages to be secured by the Company is the service of Mr. HJ.
Storey Mr Storey has a thorough knowledge of the industry, and is the owner and originator of a
special trade process for maturing oil which is not known or used in any other factory. Under this
process oil can be sold, within three days instead of at the very legist thiee months, and is exceptionally
pure and of high grade. „ ' , ~ ,
A conservative estimate of the »net profit of treating one ton of »qed is £2O. . _
An option has been secured by the Vendors over sufficient seed to last over a period of five .months,
and this will be made over to the Company. . . , , , , ,
So confident are the Vendors of the success of the Company that they have agreed to take most of
their consideration in Shares. The Vendors are to receive 24,000 fully paid up Shares and only £3OOO
cash for their business, as more particularly described on Prospectus.
Messrs. W. S. Lang & Company, Adelaide and Sydney, have an agreement with Messrs. Storey and
Fotheringham to purchase their whole output of meal and cake up to the requirements of the Common*
wealth, and this will be continued, with the new Company. , f T
Application Forms for Shares can be obtained at the Office of the Secretary (pro tem.), James

“Barney’ : A Digger on our homing
trooper took with him a pet pigeon. After we had
been on board a few days the bird was given its
liberty and became an interested spectator at the
two-up school and similar services on board. When
we were off Aden it flew away and had an hour’s
tour, returning safely. We drew into' Colombo for
two days; when we left the pigeon was among- the
missing, but it caught up when we were about
eight miles out. How the deuce did it recognise
our trooper among all the other steamers about ?
* * *
Allambee”: My slut has a litter of seven,
so I tried “Riom’s” experiment for finding the
best pup (B. 22/7/’2O). In four rounds one pup
gained a first and a second* but was out of a place
the other times. Didn’t try any more, as the
mother was getting annoyed. Now, I want more
information. Does the chosen pup in this case win?
If not, has the business to be carried out by
preferential voting or an exhaustive ballot? Also,
what is the best way to keep the mother in a good
humor ?
iarrum” : Talking about durable timbers,
where does woollybutt come in ? Between Nepean
Towers—the late Dr. Jenkins’s residence—and the
Pheasant’s Nest, stand four posts of the old house
in which the late Jimmy Tyson’s mother lived for
years. The bottoms of the posts show little sign
of rot, and look good for another century. A
Tyson beneficiary with me at the inspection remarked:
“If you told people these posts were still- here and
sound they’d most likely say you were a liar.” I’m
chancing it.
THE THIRSTIEST CUSTOMER HE
HAD EVER SEEN.
“Cripes, he might ha’ waited till it landed,
mightn't he?"
“Euro”: The Bulletin has chronicled
many ghastly bush deaths ; but they’ve none equalled
this for shuddering hideousness. It was on a
small mining field in the Territory during the fourth
year of the \yar. An Englishman was at work far
down the creek. The nearest camp was occu-
pied by two Italians. The Englishman, who was
reserved to taciturnity, worked a tribute on an
unfrequented part of the hillside. He was an
invalid, his trouble chronic dysentery. The claim-
owner noted his absence from work one day, and
walked across to the two Italians to ask about him.
“Oh, he’s not left his camp the last two days. He’s
been groaning all the time, as though he’s ill.”
“And didn’t you go over to see him?” “No”
said the Dago ghoul. “You ,” / etc.,
etc., roared the owner. I met him striding down
the creek, and as I walked with him he told me all
he knew. We entered in at the open door of the
hut, and there we came upon the Englishman. He
lay on his back on the floor, with ey'es closed and
a half-opened mouth, through which a swollen, black-
ened tongue protruded, and from which came low
moans. A portion of his clothing was saturated with
blood, and the lower portion of his bodv was black
with great meat-ants. We carried him to the central
camp, and cut the clothes from his body The
stark horror of it—great lumps of him had been
eaten by the ants! An hour later he died, and we
dug his grave among the spinifex.
MOTHER AGAIN.
FRIEND (to seemingly seasick traveller): “What’s wrong , old boy—mal-de-mer!”
NEWLYEWD: “No, mal-de-mere-in-law.”
“Phil Random”: “Bright’s” reference to
the rapid growth of gumsuckers (B. 15/7/’2O) seems
a bit far fetched. He says some of the saplings
that started after the 1916 flood have reached a
height of 20ft. and developed a girth of about 18in.
I’m game to bet him a pig to a gumleaf-fed sheep
that there never was a red-gum sapling that reached
an 18-inch girth in four years on Deepwater or
any other ’bidgee station. However, I feel half-
inclined to give him in his gumleaf-fed mutton
yain, though the only animal I’ve ever struck that
thrives on gumleaf diet is the ’possum, the flesh
of which, I’ve heard, is savory, provided the meat
has been buried three days before cooking.
“Chihuahua”: “Zanthus” (B. 29/7/’2O)
is perhaps correct in saying that “character
and color in both plants and animals are
tricky things,” but if he’s not wrong in his
statement of Robert Clarke’s method of breed-
ing white cattle, I’ll burn every book on
mutation I own. An Austrian monk named
Mendel, the discoverer of Mendel’s Law,
established certain facts in 1866. He crossed
dwarf and tall peas, and the hybrids result-
ing were all tall; he next bred the tall off-
spring with each other, and the result was
in the proportion of three tails to one
dwarf. Then came the remarkable fact. Of
the third generation, the dwarfs, bred with
one another, always breed dw ; arf; when the
three tall peas are bred together, one-third of
them produce nothing but tall peas, while
the other two-thirds follow the example of
their immediate parents and breed on the
3-1 formula of tall and dwarf. There is no
half-tall, half-dwarf. This law has been
found to apply to the offspring of beardless
and bearded wheat, prickly and smooth-
skinned fruit, purple and red-flowered sweet-
peas, horned and hornless cattle, and to color
in animals, e.g., black and white cattle.
This law' has been repeatedly test'ed by
scientists, among them De Vries and Bate-
son, and also by the New York Botanical
Gardens, and I hate to think they’re all
liars. Robert Clarke may frequentlv have
bred a white calf from two black cattle, and
that’s what “Zanthus” probably has at the
back of his block.
“Jim Carew”: If you are about twice as
fast as greased lightning “Bright’s” method of get-
ting a dog out of a rabbit-trap (B. 5/8/’2O) is all
right. If you are not that quick try some other
way. I had a sheep-dog that managed to get his'
front foot caught, and I tried to release him in the
manner “Bright” suggests. Although we had been
mates since he was a pup, I still carry the marks of'
his teeth on my wrist. The easiest method is to
get a waddy, give the dog a good crack behind the
ear with it, and then drag him out before he is
able to think about what hit him.

“Carty Mac”: Angler folk, if you want bet-
ter worms, grow them ! First dig up a suitable plot of
ground and introduce a few good specimens. Cover
with wet bags, and occasionally sprinkle a little
milk on the under surface. You can get even
better results by mixing a little bran with the mould.
“Te W.”: The question has been often
raised whether birds of the same brood pair and
breed. I’ve watched wagtails (black fantail) drive
their young away from the nesting-quarter; and
that perhaps was done to prevent close inter-breeding.
But it is not so with all birds. Finches, for
instance, sometimes rear families while in captivity,
and the members subsequently couple and inter-
breed. Still, there are few birds that will do this in
confinement. I don’t think wild duck or black
swans will do so. Some instinct seems to teach
them that close inter-breeding will (or may) result
in deterioration of the species.
“Moa”: While camped on the Howard
goldfields (M.L.) I noticed that a party of diggers
when going to town were always well starched and
ironed up. I’d made a date, so asked for the loan
of their flat-iron. They produced a square gin-
bottle, with instructions to fill it with boiling water
and cork it up, whereon it would be capable of iron-
ing the Cook Strait smooth. The bottle had been
prepared for its job by successive baths in water
of increasing temperatures until the boiling-point
was reached; and it did its work first rate.

“T.H.M.”: King Island, the specklet 50
miles by 20, halfway between Tassy and Vic., has
a climate particularly suited to the English pheasant,
borne 12 years ago Dr. Cunningham, an ardent bird-
over, resident of the island for many years, imported
four birds from England, and now they are plenti-
ful everywhere. This result was so speedily attained
through the doctor enlisting the sympathy of all
the surrounding farmers’ wives, who placed their
bioody hens over pheasant eggs, and the resultant
broods were turned adrift. A couple of years ago
he protection of the birds was secured, but they
show no diminishing, despite that extensive shooting
of them has already taken place.

“Scottie Thrake”: Perhaps the smallest
bee in the world is the ground-bee of the Far North.
(I don’t know his Latin name, but the abo. is
quagga—that’s as near as I can get it.) Generally
his nest is in some cavity in a tree-root that has
been burned or rotted out. The cells containing the
loney are few in number, about the size and shape
of a small pea, and are hung from the roof on
threads of wax. There are other cells, filled with
a thick, yellow fluid, and stuck on the walls on
pieces of prepared surface. This stuff has a slightly
bitter taste. Don’t know what it is for The little
honey-sacks are so delicate that the slightest touch
bleaks them. The honey is thick and rich to the
taste, and from a large hive I have got nearly a
teaspoonful. J

of cotton about 2ft. long and thread it through a
we ding ring. Gather the two ends together in the
hand and hold the ring steady over the centre of the
tree about three or four inches above it. If the tree
is a female the ring will sway backwards and for-
waids, if male, it will remain stationary. I have
tried this on hundreds of trees and have never known
it to be wrong.

pieces which I had left on the dressing-table and

a sixpence in broad daylight. Last Saturday I
placed a coin on the kitchen table, where the cat
an hour later it had disappeared,
alking out in the back yard I noticed puss busy
among my seedlings. She had scraped a small
mound of earth together. I took the garden fork and
commenced to level it and discovered a sixpence!
Further investigation brought to light four other six-
penny pieces and five threepenny pieces. I had run
the robber to earth. But Heaven knows what was at
the back of her noddle.

Lazy Lover”: After considering a custom
of the wasp, I can understand why there are so
/nany unhappy marriages. The insect seizes a grub
or beetle, and having given it a hypodermic injec-
tion, lays it away in a state of coma. When it
comes to it is providing tucker for the wasp nursery.
Doreen, on a higher plane, puts her intended victim
into a similar stupor, and lays him away to be
married. A year or so after marriage lie makes the
same discovery—he’s providing tucker for the nur-
sery. The difference between man and wasp is that
the former wakes up. That’s why we have Divorce
Courts.

“Jim Carew”: The native birds are easily
our most reliable weather forecasters. If the mopoke
holds an exceptionally late concert, look for rain;
if ■ the magpie is heard warbling at night, it’s
going to be fine weather. If black cockatoos are
restless and fly about screaming more horribly than
usual, prepare for storms. If the Blue Mountain
jays and parrots are flying away from the south
in flocks, a cold snap is coming in those parts.
When the robin is the only bird heard and he
only faintly, there’s thundery weather about. If
the fantail (“cranky fan”) performs his tumbling
in silence it means rain; but if he invites all
and sundry to come and watch it will be .fine.
Perhaps the best guide of all is the honeysucker,
who, if the weather is going to continue fine,
ushers in the dawn with a grand burst of song.
If he is silent it is better to make a move for
high ground.
A DISGRACE TO HIS CLASS.
OWNER OF ROLLS ROYCE (who has knocked

THE OTHER OWNER: “ Don’t come apologis-
ing to me. I’m disgusted. You haven’t
even damaged my clothing.”
“Mulga” : A friend of mine who indulges
in poultry-raising, has an Indian game hen whose
eggs on two occasions contained three yolks and
have never less than two. Another hen, on eight
consecutive days, laid two eggs a day. The bird
was confined alone in a pen, and there seems i- be
no possibility of an intruder. Whaffor?
HIS HOPELESS LUCK.

“I’ve only got to place a bet
On Nimble Foot, and he will fall
And break his neck, or straightway get
A fit of strangles, that is all.
There is no need a horse to drug—
I back him and his grave is dug.

So many, that for me to bet

For which ten years 1 ought to get.
My horse will stop himself if he
Is forced to run into a tree.”
Block grinned, and said: “In that case, mate,
You ought to bet at Flemington,
For round the flat and up the straight
Of trees there’s not a single one.”
The small man growled: “Enough from you!
My horse would wait until one grew!”

Never in the history of Australia has a man s personality so gripped and
charmed the Nation. All sections—all creeds—in city and country paid
homage to the Prince- and were proud and pleased to do it. nis progress
was a triumph—and in no small measure its success was dependent on the
automobile, for the car by its use, saved time and enabled many centres o
be visited that would otherwise have had to be “ blue pencilled owing to
lack of time. For the purpose three Crossley cars were shipped from Eng an
for the use of the Prince and his staff, but Australia supplied the tyres that
enabled the Prince's itinerary to be speedily and pleasantly carried through.
They were Dunlop “Railroads” —tyres famed for their staunchness an
dependability, and they lived .up to their reputation. They were NOT
specials—just the same as supplied to all motorists, for money cannot make
a better cover than our standard “Railroad The Princes visi
was a triumph, and Australians—young and old—will long be pleased to
remember it. DUNLOP RUBBER. CO.

sometimes in art it is necessary to be
false to be true.” It must be grand to
know just exactly libw much of the false
is needed to get the truth ; but it is terribly
depressing to realise that you have not been
endowed with the ability to know. Again,
of the same artist: “lie makes too much
of a ‘job’ of his picture. He paints right to
me bitter end.. There is no suggestion.”
Does that mean that a completed picture is
bad ? That one should knock off when one
is about three-parts through? And of Tin-
dall: “His landscapes are a trifle hard and
lack feeling.” What does “feeling” mean?
My absolute lack of grasp of that term has
moi|e than, once made me think that my only
equipment as an artist is a desire to paint.
And all. the critics’ oft-mentioned “refine-
ment”—is it something one can buy to mix
with the paints? Or to rub on to the canvas
before the paint is applied?
Art seems to be a thing of hidden mysteries.
I believe that to be an artist one needs two
lives the first to discover the meaning of all
art-terms; the second to do the work if
you can remember all you learned in the
first. It all looks too big. The thought of
the immensity of the subject is too depress-
ing. I will never try to paint again.
LEASON.
The Shorter Story
The _ shortness of the Australian short-
story is not in any way characteristic of
the genius of the Australian writer. It is
not the outcome of natural conditions, but
is an arbitrary form forced upon the helpless
scribe by a set of men who are not story-
writers and whose object is purely merce-
nary. It is a consequence of the determina-
tion of editors of weekly papers to wedge
what stories they have to sell into a pre-
scribed space, usually as definite and as
limited as the place for a single brick in a
wall.
To justify this course of action these ex-
cellent gentlemen have set up an ideal of
brevity which they persistently advertise
as a synonym of perfection with an audacity
they would not dare to assume in the matter
of dinner, for instance. Yet skimpiness and
lack of sauces and seasoning are no more
commendable in a piece of literature than
in what should be a square meal. Brevity
is not in itself a literary virtue. It is only
to be desired when it adequately expresses
the full idea. This may s<*und trite, but it
is a fact easily forgotten. If all an artist
in letters wishes to convey requires ten
thousand words restriction to the employ-
ment of five thousand is a process of emas-
culation, and there must follow a consequent
failure of conception.
A man who would not dream of asking a
painter of acknowledged ability to eliminate
light and shade and sacrifice values in his
picture assumes the most cheerful insouci-
ance in demanding of a reputable short-story
writer that he mercilessly sacrifice cumula-
tive work, all necessary to the effect he aims
at. As the Australian short-story writer,
unlike short-story writers in older communi-
ties, is entirely at the mercy of the ! gentle-
man who relegates the stories in his paper
to a niche, he must subscribe to the false
economy which has made brevity essential
to literary salvation in these parts.
Here there are no big monthly magazines
catering for short-story readers and allow-
ing the writer comfortable space to turn in;
no great story-weeklies such as they have
in numbers in the United States; no quar-
terlies that afford the builder of shorter fic-
tion ground-space and room for his super-
structure. We have only a limited number
of weeklies, with each of which the brevity
that may rob a story of its clothing of flesh,
and impart a cadaverous aspect to what
might otherwise have been a living thing, is
rigidly insisted upon.
The Australian gospel of brevity is based
on false standards and is propounded by
editors to serve their own purpose. It will
accept O. Henry’s “Gift of the Magi” as
an ideal story while utterly banning Edgar
Toe's “The Gold Bug” and Wells’s “The
Country of the Blind.” In fact, apart from
O. Henry perhaps, there is not a short-story
writer of eminence of the last 50 years
for whom Australia, the land of waste
spaces, could find room. Wells would be
almost crowded out; so would Leonard Mer-
rick, and Kipling, and Quiller Couch and
Stevenson. Frank Stockton would get a
look in for his “Lady or the Tiger.” but
Arnold Bennett, Joseph Conrad, Stephen
Crane, Conan --Doyle, John Galsworthy,
Maxim Gorky, Thos. Hardy. Bret Harte, W.
W. Jacobs, Henry James and Anthony Hope
would be excluded. De Maupassant, judici-
ously expurgated, might get a column and a
half for his smallest things; his larger can-
vases wouldn’t have a hope. To say that
the effect of this deliberate compression from
outside, this application of the mechanical
woolpress to local fiction, is good for Aus-
tralian letters is to say that Australian
literature, unlike the literature of other
communities with larger experience, must not
be left to its own devices. In point of fact,
the repression must necessarily have an evil
effect upon our work. Taking Henry Law-
son as a conspicuous example, it has made of
him a writer of sketches which merely serve
to make manifest the fact that his whole
genius seeks expansion. Henry Lawson has
written enough to give him a place as the
foremost Australian democrat, but he rarely
writes a story, for the reason that he can-
not anywhere find room for a story of the
kind his quality craves. He gives us bits
of Australian life,- wonderfully viyid, but
each leaving the impression that it is only
a feature of the artist’s vision. I blame
excessive compression, too, for the most con-
spicuous of Lawson’s faults, the obvious
exploitation of sympathy. Lawson is too
sympathetic because he is so manifestly so
in his limited area. His tendency is to kill
his characters with kindness. For this he
has been sedulously praised by his critics
ever since he wrote “His Father’s Mate.”
Sympathy is only essential in the artist in
enabling him to see through the skins of his
people; for the rest the man or woman
should be an object of sympathetic interest
by virtue of his or her special qualities.
Lawson trying to be too good a fellow in
a small space stresses sympathy, with the
result that the bush-bred Australian is seen
always with a certain falsity of vision
through Henry’s spectacles, even his least
pleasing characteristics (indeed these more
than any others) receiving a chastening and
benevolent glow from Henry’s rose-colored
lens.
Space rates, so prevalent in Australian
journalism as to be almost universal, are
another influential factor in reducing the
Australian short-story to extremes. I have
had an editor of a big rich weekly attached
to a daily ask me to cut fully 40 per cent,
out of a story that had pleased him, and
recognising the folly of kicking against the
pricks I have done it, with the result that
the printed story that had been accepted as
a well-dressed, full-bodied entity was pre-
sented to ’ the reader as a mere framework,
hard and angular, progressing spasmodi-
cally, the characters in action having the
jerky movements of iron automatons. But
that editor had got for two pounds thirteen
what he would otherwise have had to pay
something over four pounds for, and no
doubt he fondly imagined his subscribers
would be impressed with the yarn just as
he had been.
The tendency is towards further com-
pression, and presently it will be essential to
literal accuracy to speak, not of the Aus-
tralian -story, but of the Australian anec-
dote. Salvation is not in sight. We need
cit least four substantial magazines featuring
stories, true short stories, with plot and
characterisation, color and atmosphere, not
mere sketches or anecdotes, and it seems
that the present generation of Australian
story-writers might as reasonably crave the
moon. Meanwhile our writer will continue
writing only those stories he can fit into the
niches, and his larger ideas will remain so
much literary lumber, stuff for which it is
rashly assumed Australian readers have no
use, even while such matter from outside is
selling in huge quantities on every bookstall
and in all our shops. Only our Australian
editors repudiate the motto u Ars longa, vita
orevis.”
EDWARD DYSON.
The Fair Thing in Literature
In the days of Hengist Swinburne would
have appeared perfectly insane; yet Henry
Newbolt, allowing for differences of dialect,
would have made a very good poet laureate
for Penda of Mercia. Swinburne wrote in
an atmosphere half Greek, half romantic, far
removed from the commonplace; Newbolt,
with wonderful rhythms and a lot of g'enuine
magic, contrives to keep his thought just
one step in front of the man in the suburban
street. There is a fine art in thus keeping
close to the crowd and yet leading it; and it
is just possible that many writers, with per-
fectly honest intent, have got so far in front
of the human procession that they are never
likely to be caught up at all. Their thought
is real enough and they have an assured
place; but the direction of the path is not
always clear, and a little divergence from it
at one point may lead to a writer’s being
side-tracked in point of reputation through
all the years. Shakspeare never got out
of thinking distance of the Elizabethans who
thronged the Globe theatre; and such diffi-
culties as we may have in reading him are
generally to be solved by looking back, not
by going forward.
To go back to pick up the features of
Shakspeare’s landscape is a fair thing; but
it can hardly be claimed that it is a f-air
thing to deliberately linger a century or
two in the rear of your hearers and then
torment them with words which your great-
great-great-grandfathers failed to pass on to
you except in obscure books. The two chief
literary curses of the day—leaving out the
over-popular novel which is in no strict sense
literary-—are the attempts to write in the
past and in the future. The wild, mean-
ingless things which appear from time to
time as “futurist” are evidently written on
the assumption that, ail readers 50 wears
from now' must be incoherently insane: but
they are hardly worse than the attempts to
reproduce ancient language and thought in
a modern atmosphere. Some Australians sin
badly in this way. To mix up “thee” and
“thou ’ wfith “you” in one piece of verse
is to produce a maddeningly illiterate effect;
yet it has been done over and over again, in
volumes printed large and fair, without a
word of protest from critics.
Similarly, the employment of the archaic
word wffiich is not in general use nor gener-
ally understood can only be explained in
two ways. It is either an attempt to mys-
tify the reader and so win the admiration of
the “strange, mysterious dulness” Byron
talks about, or an attempt to display a
scholarly superiority; but in any case it is
in the nature of a fraud. It has been recently
pointed out that Rupert Brooke never uses
a word that would be unthinkable in an
ordinary intellectual conversation. The
same may be said of nearly all the best
writers, always making allowance for the
age in which they wrote. At any rate it is
a fair thing in either prose or verse to trv to
make yourself understood ; not to do that is
to suggest that you can’t have much to
say that is worth understanding.

The Tragedy of Ireland
Maire Maeka.v’s sick-boy theory of Synge
(Red Page 29/7/’2O) will not even bear the
scrutiny of her own quotations from Yeats.
The “sick fancies” of “The Playboy” eman-
ate from one whom Yeats describes as “scru-
pulously accurate in all liis statements!”
The great fact of his existence was the
healthiness of a mind that, like Flecker's,
saw past all the misery of a frail body. In
a normal reaction against the soul-sickness
so common in so physically sound a people
as the Irish, he endeavored, with his sane
satire, his abounding humor, to expound his
brief for life. To deny greatness to “The
Playboy,” while granting it to “Riders to
the Sea,” is but to take sides in the old
quarrel of comedy against tragedy.
To one like Synge, whose sole interest was
life the Celtic spirit, as understood
by “D.M.W.” and Maire Mackay, was more
or less anathema. He saw in it, as in every
other sort of mysticism, a flinching, even a
flying retreat, from life. And what better
example of this rettreat than William Sharpe,
whose cowardice took the form of almost
sheer physical fear of allowing the world
to know him as "Fiona Macleod,” he being
content to be known in liis lifetime as a
second-rate critic?
No one more than Yeats recognised the
paramount necessity of Synge in the Irish
literary birth—it, can hardly be called a
renaissance, for the pre-Yeats literature of
Ireland is, after all, indifferent stuff. Recog-
nising his own artistic sphere to be the world
ot dreams, he nevertheless saw, or by some
normal reaction comparable to that govern-
ing Synge felt, that a generous leaven of
Synge s outlook was necessary to preserve
the sanity of Irish art. It is a tribute to
§ rea tness that Yeats never wavered.
I hat Synge died before he could produce
another ‘ Playboy” was a tragedy the com-
plement of which would have been the early
death of eats. After hips the missionary
spirit took charge in a worse form than
ever. One result has been the sheer waste
of such men as Pearse, McDonagh and Plun-
kett three pure souls—and (by a subtle
stroke of irony) of one to whom the Celtic
spirit meant nothing—Connolly, the first
genuine Irish Red. When will these Irish-
men learn to live for Ireland?
The. present-day reaction against all this
aeiy faeriness. is James Joyce. What has
the C eltic spirit to say to him in the lime-
light of sundry happenings of to-day in Ire-
land !
O’H AONIAN.
A Book of Ham
The Histbry of South Africa from 1873 to
188/\ is not calculated to add much to the
reputation as a stylist (and he really had a
reputation) of the author, Geo. McCall
Theal, “formerly Keeper of the Archives
of the Cape Colony, etc., etc.” Perhaps he
dried up among the archives, which are
dusty and formal things. The book is a mine
of information, but the graces of diction are
not in it. Reading it one is impressed with
tlie amazing double luck of Australia in
having no frontier except the sea and no
great native .population. In this story of
a handful of years are included at least a
dozen wars, the ninth Kaffir war being among
the early ones; and few, if any, of them are
at all creditable to the British side of the
argument, before or after the guns spoke.
Theal’s books on South Africa are, in fact,
a long record of “slimness” and trickery and
ill-faith. A typical instance is the seizure
of the Diamond Fields on behalf of a more
or less imaginary Kaffir with the comedy
name or alleged name of Waterboer, for
whom the British heart bled because base
Dutchmen had done him out of his land.
The Kaffir never got the rich Diamond
Fields, of course. Indeed his very existence
is uncertain. But Britain kept them as
trustee, blandly acknowledging that it had
done wrong—in fact, its own law-courts gave
judgment against it—and offering £90,000 as
compensation. One other painful feature of
South African history is the names. Be-
tween 1873 and 1884 the British authorities
held converse (mostly unpleasant) with
Boshof, Ketslnvayo. Mankoroane. Dabula-
manzi. Gangelizwe, Langalibalele (he was a
Hlubi), Sekukuni. Methlokazulu Umqikela
and Umhlangaso. Australia has indeed much
to be thankful for. (Geo. Allen and Unwin,
London.)

“Bardoc” : He was clad in new slops and
an aroma of brandy, and he stormed into
our office like an Avenging Angel. “Where’s
the reporter who reported my case?” he
barked. “What case?” asked the editor
wearily. “My case! Jones's case!” “What’s
the matter with it, anyhow?” “He’s
blackened my character,” howled the infuri-
ated visitor. “It’s all wrong, I tell you.” The
court-reporter poked an injured expression
into the room. “That’s not him,” breathed
the man with the spiritual accents. “It
must be,” said the editor more wearily than
ever “He’s been doing our police-court
work all the week, anyhow. When was
cfse heard?” “Three years ago,”
What! Where have you been since?” “In
f, " —.gaol!” Then we threw him into
the traffic.
“Hamer”: The Australian freelance finds
the ways of Fleet-street a trifle perplexing.
When I was there a man got 11 guineas
from an illustrated daily for a photo of a
Persian and his small son walking the Lon-
don streets in their native clothes. But all
that I received for a news item set over two
columns was 2s. 9d., and another par.
fetched Is. lid. It was explained to me that
general news was syndicated, and that the
freelance was expected to recompense him-
self by selling his item to as many papers
as would take it; which was interesting
but not consolatory. However, I found that
comment in the paragraph form was com-
paratively well paid. Small pars, brought
from ss. to 155., and even three-liners, though
hard to get in, fetched 2s. 6d. The Daily
Mail gives up to four guineas for short
specials: I got that for one article which
ran to 260 words. One paper which asked
me to write up a function from an Austra-
lian soldier’s standpoint sent a car to take
me to it —and at that time the use of pri-
cate cars was prohibited—and paid out two
guineas for a quarter-column. From my
experience the man who knows the ropes
can make a good living in London; but Ate
ropes take a lot of knowing.

“Broke”: My friend Lotide was at one
time boots at a leading Launceston hotel.
A few years later he found himself
stranded and stony in the old town.
He did some hard thinking, and about 11.30
p.m. carried out his plan. He went back to
his former job—not to collect the boots, but
the boodle in them. As it was a Show night
he made a good haul —30s. And a new pair
of boots in exchange for his ventilators.
The Australian record price is claimed
for a bullock auctioned at Orange (N.S.W.)
for £Bl. It was estimated at 17001 b. dead
weight—-just under a shilling a pound. But
at Addington (M.L.) recently £204 was
exchanged for a bullock of 30561 b. live
weight—about Is. 4d. per lb. Either price
suggests that breakfast steak is likely to be
for a while nearly as expensive as night-
ingales’ tongues.

There was another case of suicide this
month when Bonnie Charlie —a 20-months’
ram reared at Bundemar, Trangie (N.S.W.)
■ —was sold to S’Africa for 3600 guineas.
Incidentally, this is the highest price ever paid
for an Australian sheep; but if Australia
offered five times as much for S’Africa’s nest
young cock ostrich, the slim Boer owner
would laugh at the proposition.

“A.M.1.E.E.”: “Gadgett” (B. 5/8/’2O)
complains that Australian-made axe-handles
are not as good as American. I don’t know
much about axe-handles, but I can speak of
hammer-handles. If any Bulletin carpen-
ter or engineer requires a new handle, let
him insist on having one of Australian blue-
gum. He will find the grip better, the wood
will stand more straining or jarring than
any handle made of American timber, and
the price is about half that of the imported.
No doubt he will have the same difficulty
as I had—persuading the Australian sales-
man to sell the Australian article when an
imported one is handy. But with a little
firmness the salesman will give in.

“Forester”: The commonest wattle in
many parts of the Speck is the white or sil-
ver. I have seen hundreds of acres of it cut
down and burned off as a nuisance. But
with the rise in the price of bark it has
become a moneymaker. And now Dalrymple
Hay, the N.S.W. forestry expert, has come
along and says that Australia is looking for
timber suitable for bentwood furniture, and
that he has never seen anything to approach
the silver wattle for the purpose. In the
scrubs in the south-east of the Speck you
find some hefty specimens of this herb, run-
ning up pretty well to 100 ft. in extreme
cases. It was sometimes turned into eask-
staves in the old days, but that is about
the only use that has been made of it so
far. It is tough and supple, as well as
fairly light. Occasionally it forms a forest
by itself. A big patch on the side of Mt.
Reuben, near Marion Bay, shows up yellow
at a distance of five miles when it is in
flower.
TWO SINGERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The summer morn was bright and fair,
And bees were humming everywhere;
A frowning poet nursed his jaw
And listened to a squealing saw.
“Whoo-whee! Wow-zee! Whizz-kling!” The teeth
Sang to the red wood underneath ;
The logs were loaded on the wain
And then the song began again.
The poet bit his pen and tried
The saw-mill’s screech to set aside;
He could not think of anything
For that “Whoo-whee! Wow-zee! Whizz-kling!”
Before the screaming of the disc
His tame-lamb thoughts refused to frisk;
They trembled back to cells remote,
While the saw cut the forest’s throat.
A bloke whose nerves were never raw
Shoved timber at the whirling saw,
And did not guess his honest toil
Was making someone’s brain-pan boil.
“Whoo-whee!" The red-gum’s dying wail
Rose like the spirit of a gale.
The poet snatched his hat and ran
To interview the working man.
Into the sawmill yard he dashed
And sought the thing that sang and flashed.
“Stop that damned saw!’’ Someone cried: “Billl
Stop that there saw! ” Soon all was still.
“What’s up ?” they asked, and gathered round
In all the yard there was no sound.
“I cannot work,” the poet said,
“With that thing ringing in my head!”
“I have Important Work to do,
And a Great Soul appeals to you
To stop the saw —or stop its row.”
A sad voice said, “Gorblimey— how?"
“I do not know!” the poet cried.
The foreman called plain Bill aside:
“Hey ! ask him what he does. Poor cow!
He don’t look right to me, somehow.”
Said Bill, “What is this job you’re at?”
The poet beamed beneath his hat:
“I’m writing verse.” “Oh, that’s your lurk!
Gorstrooth! I thought you told us ‘work’!”
■ He nodded, and the waiting saw
Began again. Into its maw
He thrust a log. “Whoo-whee!’’ it cried.
The cursing poet stepped aside.
“Isn’t that fine?” the sawyer sang,
As the bright shield revolved and rang.
“There’s music—and just smell the wood!
I tell you, Digger, work is good!
“With that saw singing all the day
A bloke’s ashamed to take his pay.
What? Don’t yer like it? Well, that’s queer;
For music you can’t have much ear.”
The stricken poet rushed away
And did no further “work” that day;
The bard whose nerves were never raw
Exulted in his singing saw.

Moreover you need not wait months for delivery, we can
deliver from stock. Think what that means! You can carry
on work in 12 different places with “Champion” Road Rollers
whilst a Steam Roller is atttending to one. Also the upkeep
of a “Champion” Roller is far below that of the Steam Roller.
The diameter of a Steam Roller is too small for the weight,
causing the roller to push the material instead of compacting
it as is intended. The No. 1 model of the “Champion” Twin-
cylinder Road Roller has two drums of cast iron, each 5 ft. in
diameter by 2 ft. 6in., making a total rolling width of 5 ft.
Each drum is free to revolve on a strong steel axle, and is
arranged to carry water or sand ballast for increasing the
weight. Altogether the “Champion” Road Roller
Does the WorK Better
Than a Steam Roller
at a much- less cost of operation.
SOME INTERESTING FEATURES OF
THE “CHAMPION” TWIN-CYLINDER
ROAD ROLLERS.
To reverse the direction of roller it is only necessary to release the
clip, and the horses and front carriage are taken to the other end of
roller, without the driver dismounting, where the front carriage
automatically couples up. The axle is fitted with Stauffer lubri-
cators, and is so arranged that the four drum bearings are continu-
ally lubricated.
Two powerful screw brakes are provided, one at each end, under
driver’s control.
The front carriage is so arranged that no strain or wear comes on
the horses’ necks.
It will pay you well to get full information concerning these rollers.

Old journalist “Dagonet” Sims has issued
a plea for using the movies in England for
propaganda in aid of civilisation. Lloyd
George has appealed to the churches to
“rescue the world from anarchy.” The only
people to argue with, Sims points out, are
those who are not anarchists but might be;
and they mostly don’t go.to church. “The
pictures are far more likely to carry propa-
ganda to a successful issue .than the parsons.
Whether we like it or whether we don’t the
picture-show has become the Poor Man’s
Church.”
Aleck McCallum, sec. of the Westralian
A.L.P., recently astonished his fellow citi-
zens by stating (1) that there was no unem-
ployment in the West, (2) that there was
a shortage of labor in skilled trades, and
(3) that the success of the local repatriation
effort had been remarkable. These admissions
are the more striking in that Alexander has
been hitherto regarded as the stormy petrel
of Labor politics in his State. Incidentally,
many discharged Tommies are beginning to
find their way to the West, and Premier
Mitchell is asking for more.
“D.”: One of the Renown pressmen had
just seen a platypus. “Fur and a bill.” he
mused —“it reminds me of your N. S. Wales
politicians.” I inquired what he meant.
“Well,” he explained, “they’re all upside-
down. The ones with the biggest fortunes
are the worst-behaved. Look at this Mac-
urthur Onslow —a wealthy landlord and a
colonel, I’m told. In the House of Com-
mons, where there is a certain standard of
manners for those with ‘a stake in the
country,’ he’d be unthinkable. Such a type
might hate the Opposition as much, but he
would express his sentiments differently—
or, as the phrase goes, ‘like a gentleman.’
Onslow, with his queer provincial accent,
his inability to keep his temper, and his
habit of screaming abusive epithets, is our
idea of ‘an outsider.’ Many of your work-
ing men, on the other hand —John Storey,
for example—possess dignity, good humor
and restraint. They have the manners of
our Conservatives —Tom Mann hides, so to
speak, and Arthur Balfour bills.”
“Silas Snell”: An Australian actor, now
assuming rank as a veteran, tells of his first
histrionic efforts as a supe with George Rig-
nold at Melbourne Royal. He had been dead-
broke a week, and took office as one
of the mob to save his life. While
he was officiating as a dead man on
the field of battle one night, Henry V.,
declaiming in his vicinity, side-stepped on
to his nose, the regal heel doing so much mis-
chief that the damaged organ of the dead
Frenchman spouted blood. The limelight
was. full on deceased, or as much of it as the
Royal George could spare, and the phenome-
non was visible to the whole audience. Henry
himself discovered it, and he laid for that
particular casualty when the curtain fell,
and roared round him. “What the devil
do you mean by it?” demanded the actor-
manager. “But you stepped on my nose,
sir.” “Stepped on your nose be d —d. sir!
That is not the point. The point is that a
corpse does not bleed at the nose. Whoever
heard of a corpse bleeding at the nose? And
you were so ostentatious about it, man—so
infernally demonstrative. By gad, sir, I’ll
have no bleeding corpses in my theatre.”
“And George promoted me on the spot,” ex-
plains the pro. “From that moment I became
a live man.”
“D.E.” finds a long-lost relative: —
Prof. Macmillan Brown, of M.L., the greatest
living authority on Pacific ethnography, has
definitely abandoned the notion that the Poly-
nesians originated in the Malay Archipelago. In
a Uni. lecture at Dunedin on July 16 he advanced
the theory that they were Aryans from Central
Asia, or thereabouts, with Melanesian elements, the
latter being the result of raids on, and the abduc-
tion of women from, islands in the Melanesian
group. He referred to “a persistent and most
definite Maori tradition” that the original inhabi-
tants of M.L. were giant blonds, fair-haired and
blue-eyed, and cited other examples of Polynesian
folk-lore harking back to a country where the
trees had leaves only half the year and the people
“walked on the water.” But, traditions apart, the
Professor is satisfied from the appearance of the
Polynesians that they derive from the Aryan branch
of the human family, for he has found a distinct
element of blondism throughout the Polynesian
group. He has noted Polynesian faces that were
pure Grecian types; and he points out that a
large proportion of the children have bronzy hair.
Moreover, the custom of liming the hair, which
waves like the European’s and is totally unlike the
Malay’s, is, in his judgment, another indication
that the race has a blond ancestry behind it. In
fine, the Professor believes that the Maoris,
Hawaiians, Samoans, etc., “are almost pure
Caucasians; they clearly belong to the same great
division of the human race as ourselves.” He men-
tioned incidentally that the remains of docks for
keeled boats and huge stockades, evidently for the
protection of a foreign invader, had been found
on the coast of South America. A Maori mere
had also been picked up there, and there were
other indications that Polynesian adventurers had
reached the other side of the Pacific. “But I feel
sure,” the Professor added, “that if they did land
there they never came off again.” Possibly they
rounded the Horn and tried to get back by way
of Africa and Australia. The late William Pater-
son, manager of the W. A. Agricultural Bank, told
the writer that he had once found the battered
remnants of a Maori boat below Roekingham, cn
the Westralian coast. But Groperland wasn’t on
the scientific map in those days, and Paterson was
never sufficiently interested in the subject of his
discovery to make a song about it. t
STERILISED KISSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Among new inventions is a kissing screen, a
small contrivance which every sanitary lover is
expected to carry in his pocket.”
There is great danger in the kisp;
There has been and will ever be.
The game with any pretty miss
That has no danger’s not for me.
From kisses I have caught with ease
A dozen kinds of heart disease.
The kiss that has been sterilised
Is rumless punch, a sexless dance,
A saltless egg, a game devised
With room for neither skill nor chance.
What’s caught from kissing, bachelor,
Is something to thank Heaven for.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Old George Hirst has settled down as
cricket coach at Eton, and dropped out of the
game. He leaves a wonderful record. For 17
years without a break (1896 to 1913) he never
failed to make 1000 runs and take 100 wickets in
the season. In each year from 1904 to 1906 he
added to his 100 wickets 2000 runs; in 1906 he
had the seemingly impossible record of 200 and
2000.

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos the athletic sons of
“Rolf Boldrewood.” When Rolf was P.M. at Dubbo
he could use his fists, too. A burly bushman in
beer was resenting the efforts of his wife to get him
home. The bushman threatened to use his hands,
whereupon Rolf turned up his sleeves and, stepping
in between the pair, quietly said, “I’ll give you
some fight if you want it.” It was not wanted.

“Ex-Dig.”: The 13-year-old (B. 29/7/’2O)
who stowed away on a transport and fought in
France as an “unofficial soldier” is doing some
more fighting in Sydney. He is in a novice boxing
tournament in the “paperweight division,” and
knocked his first opponent out in two rounds. Wallace
Pugh is his name; he fights at 7st. 71b.; is 4ft.
llin. high, and, his war record notwithstanding, is
still only 18.
E. F. Waddy„the old N. S. Wales cricketer,
is now a master at Rugby (Eng.), and naturally
has a place in the Warwickshire team, which has
lost F. R. Foster, and is now mostly young players,
with old stonewaller Quaife and wicket-keeper Smith
to stiffen them. Howell, who is coming to Aus-
tralia, has made a meteoric rise; at the end of
May he was dismissed in one line in a county sum-
mary as “a pretty good fast bowler who can keep
up his pace for a long time.”
* * * „*
Owners in S. Aus. feel that they have not
enough scope. All betting except by totalisator is
unlawful, and the days for using the machine are
strictly limited by the Act that introduced it.
Hence a petition, which is being widely signed,
begging for more liberality. It sets out some curi-
ous figures. The racing fixtures for Adelaide —-tak-
ing in a 30-mile radius —are only 37 (with no
ponies or trotting), as against about 225 in Sydney
or Melbourne, and almost continuous fixtures in
Perth or Brisbane. The most significant fact is
that, when the Federal Government started to “con-
trol” racing during the war, it found nothing in
Adelaide requiring pruning, and left the existing
fixtures just as they were and are.
* * * *
At the S.A. Jockey Club annual meeting
T. F. Kiley was allowed to bring up the motion
which the A.R.C. has been legally advised was not
allowable on such an occasion, and the majority
voted it “desirable that legislation be enacted to
provide for the licensing of bookmakers in South
Aus.” But when Kiley went on to suggest that
the S.A.J.C. Committee Should call the other clubs
Together to discuss ways and means, Sam Jacobs,
occupying the chair in the absence of John Barker,
didn’t “t’hink it was intended that the meeting
should dictate any form of action to the Club
on the subject.” The Club is probably a fool not
to leave well enough alone. In these wowserish
times, it is risky to throw such privileges as it
has into the melting-pot of Parliament.

.Mick Rasheed, a Soustralian pastoralist
and racing enthusiast, intends invading Westralia
on a large scale during the goldfields round of race-
meetings in the spring, and is chartering a special
train by way of transport. The string that will go
over includes Laroon, King’s Physician, Black Earl,
Corner Black, Persian Belle, San George, Pistolusion,
Aneplin, Jarwan, The Toff, Prince Varco, Princess
Traquair, Topay, Lord Nangar, Remi, Min Bess,
Queenbrook and a couple of Castaway colts. A.
Cherry and J. Bax will be in charge of them, and
the jockeys G. Bax, A. H. Franc#, W. Huppatz, C.
Boom, J. Sing, B. Lawrence, Barclay and J. Hop-
wood will also make the trip. Rasheed intends
going to Perth for the Cup meeting at Christmas,
and thence to Java. It is about the biggest one-
man venture in the history of the Australian turf.
“Fax”: “Plum” Warner, .being asked for
a judgment on the newly-selected English eleven,
said it was “the best they could get.” But one
must remember that Warner is a man of 50 who
until recently had hopes of captaining this show. He
was the old man making as little as possible of the
disabilities of age. To my way of thinking the
eleven that Spooner will lead will be at the mercy
of the weather. Given cool days and wickets in
favor of the bowlers they may have an even-
money chance in the tests, but if the matches are
to be mainly tests of endurance the Englishmen
will be hopelessly beaten. The Australian sun will
be much too hot for their years, and the playing
grounds much too fast for their activities. They
would have been reckoned a preposterously old lot
to bring to Australia five and thirty years ago, when
Johnny Briggs’s only rival in the field was Syd
Gregory, and Attewell was a slim young bowler, and
Lohmann was just coming along. Why, Stoddart
was fully 10 years younger than Spooner now is
when he captained the team that won three out
of five tests through the untiring efforts of Tom
Richardson and Peel and the batting (in the last
match) of young Brown. In estimating the chance
of a visiting cricket team a lot of allowance must
be made, of course, for its wise moderation (or
otherwise) in the matter of beer. My experience
teaches me that beer and whisky are the most per-
sistent foes of good cricket. But here, again, the
age of the coming crowd puts it at a disadvantage.
It probably can’t carry beer as it did, whereas
time has developed its tendency to lean on beer for
support. However, here’s luck to it! It will want
the luck. If the professional players are to receive
only £2 a week for expenses they will not find
£4OO too large a lump sum for the tour.

“A .'Wf 1 .” : The crawl stroke as now used
is the Solomon Islanders’ stroke perfected. Alec
Wickham told me that his brother, who had been
sent to Newington College, swam the stroke in Bal-
main years before he (Alec) did. This brother had
not the hallmark of a champion, and was unknown
to the public; and not making a startling success
of the business little notice was taken of his stroke.
In the Solomons it is called the Tuppa-tup-pala,
and very few of the natives know any other way to
swim. Writer saw Alec in his first race at the
Bronte baths 23 years ago. Alec was about 12
years of age at the time, and he startled all present
by swimming 66 yards in 44 seconds. George
Farmer was present, and when he saw Wick.’s dusky
body gliding ahead through the water he exclaimed:
“Look at the chap crawling!” That was the first
time I had heard the term used, a id I think it was
George who named the stroke. In those days Alec’s
movements were very crude, but the foundation for
the present crawl stroke was there. His great trouble
at first was to steer straight. The day after Alec’s
brother Ted arrived from the Solomons he was taken
to the Rose Bay haths for a swim, and he swam
the crawl stroke. After Alec Wickham came “Turns”
Cavill; b/it, strange to say, the name of “Turns”
has rarely been mentioned in connection with the
“invention” of the stroke. Turns saw that the
crawl was the coming method of propulsion, and
he tutored Dick, who at that time was a youngster,
the last of the famous family. Dick perfected the
stroke and astonished the world with his perform-
ances. Yet the crawl stroke of to-day is very
different from that of the Cavills in the early days.
Cecil Healy was taught the stroke by George Farmer
about the time Dick Cavill was being coached by
Turns. Wickham remembers that the Cavills in-
vited him to use their baths (free of charge), and
that when he availed himself of the invitation ’ Dick
and Turns watched him carefully from the side. He
also tells how the same procedure was followed in
the adjacent Farmer’s Baths by Cecil Healy. Still
Alec was never jealous of his stroke, and would
willingly display it to anyone wishing to learn.

GAN YOU BEAT THIS
ITHACA GUN RECORD?
The recent Australian Pigeon Champion-
ship held in Melbourne drew a record
entry.
Included in the starters were only two
Ithaca gun users. Yet these secured
* Ist PRIZE*
and
2nd PRIZE
which certainly proves that the Ithaca
guns played a big part in helping their
owners to secure the coveted prizes.
Ithaca guns have for the last seven, years
won most of the big “shoots” held in
America.
These facts should convince you that
Ithaca guns have no superiors.

preservative, for it forms a thin protecting film,
which preserves the finish unusually well.
Use Johnson’s Prepared Wax to polish all your

The performance of “The Yeomen of the
Guard” at Melbourne Majesty’s on Saturday
was weakened by the work of the leading
ladies. Elsie, for instance, was rather sadly
handled by Strella Wilson, who has a large
robust soprano that rejoices in high, windy
passages, but sings piano with reluctance.
Thelma Carter's voice-production shone in
her opening ditty at the spinning wheel, but
the over-emphasis of her acting and her
irritating habit of talking to her audience
were the obvious artifices of the amatem-.
Ethel Morrison, as Dame Carruthers, was
physically well-appointed and reposeful, but
often her contralto was flat enough to play
jilliards on. Evidently dowagering in comedy
and drama hgs relieved this lady’s voice of
some of its previous tone and proportion.
James Hay, as Colonel Fairfax, was a start-
ling improvement on his Nanki Poo in f'The
Mikado.” His light, graceful tenor behaved
with positive distinction and his acting was
surer and more copvincing. Charles Walenn’s
elderly impishness, which is never absent
from his G. and S. conceptions, was the main
characteristic in the rise and fall of Jack
Point. Albert Kavanagh’s Shadbolt was
rather mournful. Frederick Hobbs made a
stocky and stodgy Sergeant Meryll; and Ral-
ston, as Lieutenant of the Tower, is men-
tioned for a pair of legs that Julius Tre-
mendous would have loved to own. Some
of the legs of the Beefeaters’ chorus, by the
way, showed how beauty can be slain by a
property calf: one man’s muscle slipped its
moorings and lodged firmly on the shin. Next
Saturday “lolanthe” is promised.
** * *
When “Maytime” first tried to bloom in
Sydney, a gauze influenza-mask was clapped
on Sydney’s nose and the theatre doors were
slammed after a few performances had been
given. So the sweetly serious play of senti-
ment set to music has the interest of a new
production, and Her Majesty’s should he kept
busy for a couple of weeks The plot is built
on the “Milestones” plan, and Time is dragged
along by the forelock at 40 miles per hour.
While the curtain is down the Man with the.
Scythe breaks flour-bags over the heads of
the principals or hurries them to the grave
—from which, however, they are liable to
be resurrected as their own grandchildren,
so that the eternal love-story may be car-
ried on. It is interesting but a trifle depress-
ing, and some good incidental songandance
doesn’t shift all the gloom.

sings well and
sustains the tragic
note cleverly until
she reaches the
songless haven of
old age. Leslie
Holland begins as
a prancing young
buck in 1840 and
progresses steadily
towards amorous
senility in 1917.
Leg Loberts lives
twice as an ardent
young lover and
looks overfed both
times. Pre 11 y
little Nell Payne
has a pathetic
spinster’s job that
. fits her gentle
manner. Florence
Young is' at her
best as a dignified
old lady visiting
scenes of other
people’s youth dur-
ing an auction and
being bored and
bothered by the
vulgar young wife
(No. 3) of the
play’s pursuer of
dame s—n o w a
shaky old gentle-
man. Jennie Opie,
in a grotesque
puffed dress and feathered hat, chatters inter-
minably as an amusing vulgarian. Roy
Redgrave lends dramatic interest to the plot
as the scowling, fashionable bully who spoils
the budding 1840 love-story, and so post-
pones the romance to the grandchildren’s
time. Theodore Leonard makes a brief
third-act appearance as a Cockney auc-
tioneer : Arthur Stigant presents showman
P. T. Barnum as an unctuous advertiser;
and Louise Larsson is admirable in the last
act as the noisy American musical-comedy
starette who captures the doddering old
ladies’ man on the brink of the grave and
uses him for advertising purposes.
It is not likely that the present revival pf
“The Girl in the Taxi,” at Melbourne Royal
will cause any public excitement. For one
thing, the piece is cast anyhow. Harry
Wooton tries to conceal his youth behind the
grey hair of Professor Charcot, but the poor
deception only widens the gulf between the
actor and the character. Likewise Madge
Elliott can’t be conceived as Jacqueline, who
becomes one of the ambitious young nurse-
lings in her dad’s Abode of Joy. Madge is a nice
dancer, but to expect her to depict a liking
for night life with all the glad-eye business

that the passion involves is asking too much
of her. Cyril Ritchard, as Rene, her part-
ner, has the greatest work to look worthy of
the stunted growth on his upper lip. Wil-
liam Greene (Hubert) is a more convincing
dabbler in naughtiness, but a lot of his acting
is done with his teeth. Cecil Bradley settles
down commodiously in the part of Suzanne,
whose wonderful husband gets finely sozzled
and loses all claims to respectability under
the influence of Alfred Frith. George Wil-
loughby, as Baron Dauvray, wears the side-
boards of a long-dead epoch, but his comed.V
belongs to an earlier period. Floie Allan
is the tit-bit of Willoughby’s tete-a-tete, but
isn’t an overflow of midnight frivolity. Jack
Hooker has some crude scarecrow moments as
waiter Emile, and Field Fisher revives in
Alexis the old ruminating Solon, of Sin and
Folly. As usual, the ladies of the chorus
are efficient to the last button. Some of
the nymphs have faces that deserve a second
reading, and two or three have outgrown
their clothes.
Violinist Jenny Cullen and pianist
Laurence Godfrey Smith proved in Sydney
last week that it is possible to make a frankly
classical sonata evening both interesting and
enjoyable. The simplicity of the Bach
Sonata No. 3 led to the more elaborate
cheerfulness of the Mozart No. 7; thence
they moved on to the colorful No. 2 Sonata of
Brahms, thus working through the three acts
to “a good curtain.” Jenny Cullen brings
no adventitious aids to her work; she puts
her trust in a fine tone, great technique and
a true sincerity to reach her- audience, and
she does reach it on the too rare occasions
she is heard in solo work. She doesn’t
believe, either, in the rapturous gathering of
floral trophies over the footlights; the offer-
ings cast their scent only in the green room.

“The Boss Cockie” attains wealth and an

along in a satisfactory stream to see what
progress the Australian drama makes.

The week’s picture-show in Sydney:—
The etchings of Sydney Ure Smith now at Gayfield
Shaw’s rooms represent one of this artist’s many
activities during the last five or six years. In that
time he has acquired a distinct style in the treat-
ment of landscape and architecture—a style more
reserved and graceful than that of any of his con-
temporaries in the same field. He knows his limita-
tions and leaves the figure alone. His choice of com-
positions is nearly always excellent. Old-fashioned
doorways and dilapidated houses of the Macquarie
period appeal to him; by-lanes of Sydney and por-
tions of the harbor-front; bits of old Windsor and the
battered mill at Mt. Gilead. The most beautiful of
the smaller plates is “The Church on the Hill.”
where a decorative tree in the foreground enhances
the beauty of the distance. In a similar fashion he
has achieved a fine contrast between the ship and
barge in the foreground of “Gore Bay” with the city
beyond. Of the larger plates, “The Mill, Mt. Gilead,”
is the most satisfactory. “The Cooperage” is a good
example of what can be done with a subject not at
first sight attractive to the average eye. So with
many other of these etchings, Ure Smith has revealed
beauty in places and buildings about Sydney which
mostly pass unnoticed.
Huckleberry Finn is at Sydney Hay-
market and Globe, and his experiences in
company with Tom Sawyer and the rest
are as popular as ever. Ethel Clayton
breaks and patches up „ the 13th Command-
ment at the same houses, and points a moral
for all loan-floating Australian Premiers:
“Spend not more than you earn.” In by-
gone days the battered pug usually bought
a racehorse or a pub; nowadays he becomes
a film-actor. Carpentier and James Corbett
are doing it; now Bombardier Wells is at
the Strand in the “Silver Lining.” The
sheet at Sydney Lyceum features Violet
Hopson in “The Women Wins” and May
Allison in “The Cheater.” “In Old Ken-
tucky” at Crystal Palace sounds like a Sab-
bath morning, whereas Anita Stewart en-
gages herself in all the hairbreadth escapes
and thrilling stunts that any film actress
can. _ The Universal-Jewel production at
Hoyt’s shows Priscilla Dean as Sari, the
thrilling “Virgin of Stamboul.”
The “Three Wise Fools” grow no wiser
as the nights gather over them at Melbourne
King’s. It is hard to believe they ever could
have been wise from a “smart” ’Murkan
point of view. Somehow the artlessness
which is supposed to carry them to three
exalted positions as banker, medical scientist
and Justice of the Federal Court strikes
one as an extravagant compliment to ’Mur-
kan national character, calculated to make
’Murkan private character feel seraphically
good after business hours.

on Saturday. A crammed house heard a
beautifully arranged programme*, including
some more of his favorite Handel and Rach-
maninoff: and a couple of gentle strangers from
his collection of Irish songs. Brahms also
had a short innings in “In Summer Fields,”
and the noble voice surged in the strange
Dago strains of the Third Act finale of
Leoncavallo’s “Boheme.” It was a great
evening, for which the audience was not truly
grateful without a generous supply of encores.
** * *
Evidently “Bran Pie,” now of Melbourne
Tivoli, has attractions for the multitude,
apart from the musical item of Bailey and
Cowan, a recent addition to the pie. The
labors of the two instrumentalists, plus the
intermittent lady with an unbroken smile,
are more strenuous than startling, and energy
rather than art is the password of the turn.
Otherwise there is more art than energy ic
this show.

largest canvas, priced
at 210 guineas, is an
ambitious effort to
present a frost effect
without any of the
romantic falsities of
color popular among
the potboiler class.
The result is coldly
beautiful, and the
average picture-lover
will not derive any
aesthetic emotion from
it. The same uncom-
promising reality is
shown in some studies
of sunl i g h t—like
“Afternoon Sunlight”
and “The Last Rays”
—where even in the
brightest patches there
is no glow to compen-
sate for the formal
surroundings. ,All the
same, Hampel is a
close and earnest
observer o f Nattire.
H i s “Moonset a t
Nightfall,” \v it h a
crescent moon shining
bleakly over a fading
sunset, is one of the
first authentic reports
of a scene that has
been travestied freely
on suburban fire-
screens. The artist
is not so, tak-
ing in “New Hay-
stacks and Heat” or
in “Clouds Over Mountains,” which is distinguished
by a sort of affected dreariness, hut his “Gum-
trees” (No. 15) is welcome, and “The Pale Purple
Even” is also good. And the most likeable of all
is “The Pine Plains Lake,” which has the elusive
enchantment of a Corot day.
Allan Wilkie closes down “The Rotters”
at Melbourne Princess’s to-morrow. On
Saturday he offers meatier fare in a revival
of Stanley Houghton’s “Hindle Wakes.”
Film students at Melbourne Majestic are
enjoying the eye-play of Sessue Ilayakawa
as a lone fisherman who impersonates a
haughty nobleman and brings peace and
happiness to Nippon. A curious case of
trench friendship survives bitter social
clashes in “The Other Half,” and Florence
Vidor gets the glad hand as leading woman.
At the Melba Elaine Hammerstein is lurk-
ing in “The Shadow of Rosalie Byrnes,” and
Hoyt’s have leased William Farnum for a
run in ‘The Adventurer,” which is mostly
“Maritana” without the music. Monroe
Salisbury-has a better job in “The Sundown
Trail.”

Phil Smith, working hard all through the
constant changes of “The Passing Show of
1020” at Adelaide Royal, is remarkable
chiefly for making his seasick passenger funny
without being vulgar. Jennie Hartley has
quickly become a public favorite, and so has
Peggy Sabine, of the drawing-room manners;
but Rita Reuss sings notably less well this
week than last. The frocking is gorgeous.
Melodrama is now imminent at the Royal,
and Australian-made comedy at the Tivoli.
At the Exhibition, “Prof.” Leon has had
another hypnotic evening—with a “honey-
moon” scene, from which sundry patrons
fled. In pictures Dorothy Dalton is at
Wondergraph. and Charles Ray holds up the
other half of the show; at West’s,- Constance
Talmadge and the newer arrival, Violet
Hopson. Musical events are still numerous.
Brewster-Jones took his orchestra through a
delightful Town Hall evening. In “Fin-
landia” Sibelius indicates the waste spaces
of the frozen North, and, in a quite new
“Africa,” by Saint-Saens, the hearer tries to
imagine the noises of tflie jungle. Liza Leh-
mann supplied the more definitely melodious
element. Another night Muriel Day sang
and William Silver played. On the frivolous
side is the Palais de Danse, where Eslick pro-
poses to excel his own records in an Arabian
Night.
Mrs. Cecil Hordern is now working up
a carnival to raise the Avind for the North
Sydney Memorial to Soldiers. Royal Syd-
ney Yacht Club is the place, and September
18 the date. Mrs. Littlejohn and Mrs.
Buckle are fellow-workers.
On September 22, there being no Royal
visitors in the offing, Mrs. Maclurcan is lend-
ing the Wentworth Cafe to the committee
of the Sydney Women’s College Extension
Fund, which is issuing tickets for a supper-
dance at £1 Is. per head. The fund is very lan-
guid, and the £5OOO objective seems as far
away as the horizon to an anxious commit-
tee that has not yet quite £3OOO in the hat.

Use Cocoanut Oil
For Washing; Hair.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most
soaps andi ready-mixed shampoos contain
excessive quantities of alkali. This dries
the scalp, makes the hair brittle and is very
injurious. Just ordinary colinated cocoanut
oil (a pure, saponified but quite greaseless
liquid) is far better than the most costly
soap you could possibly use for a shampoo,
for this cannot possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet your hair with water and rub it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful makes a perfect
flood of Inch, thick, creamy lather, and
cleanses both hair and scalp thoroughly. The
lather rinses out easily, and takes with it
every trace of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive
oiliness. The hair dries quickly and evenlv,
and comes out fine and silky, bright, glossy
and fluffy, appearing to be heavier than it is.
And, best of all, this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. You can
get colinated cocoanut oil at most any chemist,
but be sure it’s “colinated,” which is not
expensive—a few ounces lasting a long, long
time.
IMPORTANT: Do not confuse colinated cocoanut
oil with cheaper sticky, emulsified cocoanut oils
or other substitutes. There is only one genuine
colinated oil, as recommended above.

Why Physicians
Advise Magnesia
For Acid Indigestion.
Thousands of people whose stomachs
troubled them after eating have found that bv
taking a teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia
in a half-glass of hot water after meals they
can do away with pepsin pills and other
digestive aids, and can still be able to eat
heartily of whatever foods thev please and
have no stomach trouble afterwards. Physi-
cians say that hot water forces a much
needed blood supply to the stomach, while
Salix Magnfesia is undoubtedly the best safest
and most powerful neutraliser of stomach
acids that can be found. A single teaspoonful
will sweeten the food contents of a sour, acid,
burning stomach in five minutes bv the watch
and natural digestion will follow without pain
or uncomfortable feeling of any kind. Con-
tinued use of Salix Magnesia does not
weaken natural digestion, and it Is perfectly
safe to use at any time. It can be had at
almost any chemist’s (in powder or com-
pressed tablets form), but be sure it is Salix
Magnesia you are getting. Do not use other
forms of magnesia for this nuroma.

From Lowell Thomas, in Cairo:—
“Henry Clay” (B. 22/4/’2O) makes four charges
against me: (1) that I am a Yank and talk through
my nose; (2) that the pictures which I use are
official photographs to which I have no right; (3)
that I only mention the part played by Australian
troops twice during my two-hour talk; and (4)
that I have been making a fortune out of my travel-
talk known as “With Allenby in Palestine and
Lawrence in Arabia.”
In my introduction to “With Allenby in Pales-
tine I have always made the following confession
to my audience's: “When first I was invited to come
over from America and tell my all-too-incomplete
story of your great British crusade in Palestine, I
at first hesitated, because, although I believed the
story should- be told throughout the whole world, I
was not quite sure whether you people would want
to hear it through the nose of a Yankee. But I
have come because you people of the British Empire
are so modest that you will not tell of your own
achievements, which makes it necessary for some-
one else to do it for you ; and also because I wanted
to prove to you that we Americans can, occasion-
ally, at least, talk about somebody else besides our-
selves.” You see, I have always admitted my guilt
to his first charge, so “Henry Clay” is hardly
entitled to credit for the discovery that I talk
through my nose. As to the rest. In the first
place this travelogue of mine is not meant to be a
history of the Palestine campaign. It is merely
intended as an American tribute to British valor —
and when I say “British” I intend that all who
hear me should understand that I include the Aus-
tralian Light Horse as well as all of the other
representatives of the 17 nationalities who fought
with the Anzacs in Palestine. But on looking over
my notes I find that instead of only referring to *the
Australians twice, as charged by “Henry Clay,” I
refer to them over 20 times, and in a dozen other
places I refer to the “Anzacs.” Lieut.-General Chet-
wode, who was Allenby’s second in command, said
that the only criticism he had to make was that I
gave nearly all the credit to the Anzacs and not
nearly enough to the Yeomanry.
Accompanied by an American colonel and a staff
of photographers, I happened to be authorised by
the U.S. Government to prepare a series of travel-
ogues on all the Allied campaigns. We journeyed
some 60,000 miles, and spent two years with your
forces in Europe and Asia. After returning to
America I delivered my story of the Palestine
campaign to about half a million of my own people,
who seemed to be more enthusiastic about what you
British did in the Holy Land than what we our-
selves did in France. I was then urged to go to
London under the auspices of the British branch
of the English-speaking Union, of which Mr. Balfour
is the head. I went expecting to remain two or
three weeks. But that period was extended to a
year because of requests from the heads of your
Imperial Government. Now the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment has honored me with an invitation to visit
Australia.
As to the pictures, they were taken by IX dif-
ferent men. Although over half of them were made
by my chief assistant (Mr. H. A. Chase) and myself,
at least an eighth of the material was made by
that wizard Australian artist, Captain Frank Hurley,
whose name I hope to make a household word
before the end of my visit. I realise that I do
not give any of these 11 brilliant photographers a
fraction of the credit which belongs to them. The
reason why I make no reference to them nor to
myself is simply because we were non-combatants,
and it I did I would have to omit some part of
the far more important story of the brilliant deeds
of your men who fought. I know that Frank Hurley
would be the first to condemn me if I did other-
wise. If I were telling the story of a hunting
expedition through Africa in which the photographers
did the most of the work, it would be a different
matter.
I am indebted to “Henry Clay” for giving me this
opportunity of explaining another matter to which
I have never referred before, simply because I did
not suppose that it would be of any public interest.
He asserts that I have been making a fortune out
of “With Allenby in Palestine.” He says this, I
presume, because he knew some hundreds of thou-
sands of people heard me in London. His conclu-
sion, although quite the natural one to come to,
is wrong. Although I have devoted my entire time
for two years to this story of your campaign, I
have not received as much as a shilling for myself.
The only compensation I have received in return
for relating this tale of British —-very largely Anzac —
achievement has been the privilege of telling one
of the greatest epic stories of all human history—
the story of the campaign in which “Henry Clay,”
no doubt, played a very prominent part. That
privilege is enough reward for any man.
“Fax”: Many musical comedies have
seemed to prosper far beyond their deserts,
but as an unanticipated financial success
“Yes, Uncle,” can be awarded the biscuit, I
think. I never saw, among pieces that earned
good money, a weaker show than “Yes,
Uncle.” The situations are old and silly, the
dialogue is poor, the performance colorless.
I think I remember a time when such a
show, terminating in an inane walk-round of
the co. banging saucepan lids or similar
musical instruments, would have been re-
sented as a reflection on public intelligence;
yet it now runs for many weeks. To say
that some of the revues have been inferior
to “Yes, Uncle,” in entertaining properties
is only to confirm one in the belief that the
average mental quality of theatre audiences
must have deteriorated within the past few
years. Anyhow, audiences contain a much
larger proportion of happy inexperience than
they did. Any old joke gets louder roars of
laughter, nor is anything too forced and
humorless to please the majority. On the
other hand, there were enough people in
Melbourne to keep a light farcical comedy,
“The Man from Toronto,” booming for a
couple of months on the strength of its witty
dialogue and polished performance. So there
seems to be a discriminating crowd as well
as a mob that eats whatever is put before it.
“Silas”: The theatres have now begun to
charge for their programmes. You pay
threepence to know who’s who in the play.
Although it has been the custom in the Eng-
lish theatre to exact a thrum for the bill, the
charge is not justifiably. The programme is
one-tenth / information concerning the per-
formance, and nine-tenths matter expounding
the virtues of the Pliable Corset and the
advantages of going to So-and-So’s empor-
ium for lingerie. As an advt. medium it paid
its way, and turned in a profit. Further-
more, even the theatrical matter is mere
advt., and the theatrical manager is no more
justified in charging for it than the grocer
would be for asking threepence apiece for the
bills glorifying the soap he has just sold you
and giving instructions for its use. I hope
the public will administer one in the neck
to the gifted management by ceasing to
worry about the identity of the people who
impersonate the good, bad and indifferent
characters on the boards. After all, what
does it matter if you don’t know whether
the earl is being played by Bill Smith or
Horatio Smug?
‘‘Bill O’B.” : The mango trick having had
a fair run, here’s another that demands ex-
planation. The trickster was an Egyptian
takir I found in the Nile Valley when the
Senussi were out for trouble early in 1916.
His house was a shapeless tumble of palm
branches, something like a large-sized bandi-
coot’s nest. Hav-
in g coughed and
sneezed to attract
attention, I sat on
the sand, lighted a

rition soon hunched

kers, bony limbs,

standing on the tip of the tail, which was
lost in the smoke just above the fire. I
hadn’t had a drink for a week, was wide
awake, and the afternoon was bright and
clear, with the sun glinting on the black and
gold scales of the horror. After some seconds
the picture faded, leaving only the curling
wisp of smoke.
“Beer H.”: It was understood that Wil-
fred Lucas and his American assistants were
going to do big things in the Australian
moving-picture industry within the next 12
months. Yet after about seven weeks of it
they all sailed for home, by the Sonoma, on
August 18. Whatever the trouble is, JLucas
and his wife don’t owe Australia anything,
as they have helped to place the industry on
a decent footing—thanks in part to the
equipment they brought. One result of
their unexpectedly quick departure is that
“Snowy” Baker is also going to try his luck
abroad.
Adelaide Tivoli is going to be wildly
original and change its name to Prince of
Wales. The old title was introduced by
Rickards when he took over what had
formerly been Hudson’s Bijou, where the
Majestic now stands; and Mclntosh carried
the name to Grote-street when the new house
was built. The Prince will open at the end
of August with an Australian musical
comedy, by De Garis, of the Murray; music
by Reg Stoneham. Greig will “produce” the
piece, which is at present advertised
mysteriously as “F.F.F.”—with prizes for
solution of the mystery. If it’s the ordinary
musical-comedy it could be “Fee-Ti-Fum”
as well as anything.
“Hamfat”: The auctioneer’s hell rang
down the curtain on many old plays when
the Theatre Royal stage costumes were sold
off. This Sydney wardrobe-room had the
most comprehensive collection of costumes
in Australia, and as long as they remained
there was always a chance of spasmodic
revivals of dramas that used to delight dad
and grandad. But the mummers of those
departed days are gone, and their finery has
followed them. It fetched some amazingly
good prices, all the same.
Striking testimony to Oscar Asche’s wealth
is the advt. of Elis Majesty’s, London, which
is a mighty big home for audiences:—

“B.” : The Age says of Jimmy Hay, who
plays Nanki-Poo in the Melbourne revival of
"The Mikado,” that he is ‘‘quite one of the
most successful of the J. C. Williamson
firm’s recent importations,” and ‘‘is a decided
acquisition to the musical stage of this coun-
try.” He may be an acquisition, but he
isn’t an importation. Jimmy is a Westralian,
and was a noted concert-singer in Perth for
years before he swam into the Age critic’s
ken.
"Irymple”; That yarn of “Pugg Nashus”
(B. 12/8/’2O) about the doubles in “East
Lynne” at White Feather (W.A.) reminds
me. Victor Prince's co. played a bellow
season at Mildura (Vic.) in ’O9, doing “East
Lynne” for a hospital benefit on the last
night. Owing to untoward circumstances
half the mummers struck at the last minute,
but the curtain went up just the same, and
“East Lynne” was played with only two
male performers. Victor Prince was Archi-
bald Carlyle, and P. C. Bullock, and Norman
Campbell was Mr. Dill, Richard Hare, Lord
Mount Severn and Sir Francis Levison.
What else he did in his spare time I don’t
know. A local kiddie was Little Willie, and
Nella Campbell was Lady Isabel. And I’ve
seen much worse “East Lynnes” in much
bigger towns.
“Norbell”: “Pugg Nashus” challenges
Poverty Pointers to outpoint the “East
Lynne” double at Kanowna (W.A.), where
policeman Bullock, who was also Levison,
arrested himself (B. 12/S/’2O). In the case
cited the arresting constable stood on stage,
and ordered the invisible villain to hold out
his hands, whereupon two paws were thrust
from the prompt entrance, and duly hand-
cuffed. I take up the challenge, and pre-
sent Edgar (“Ted”) Melville. At Footscray
(Vic.), Melville, who was doing Levison,
leaned against the prompt proscenium wing,
which was, as usual, much torn and battered,
and while he sneered at Corney Carlyle,
someone “off” slipped a'policeman’s brassard
on his left coat-sleeve. The incorrigible
Teddy then shoved his left arm, thus
decorated, through a hole in the wing, tapped
himself on the left shoulder, and so literally,
actually and dinlapnly arrested himself!
“Harnfat”: Julius Grant had a way of
endorsing cards for free seats “2 0.1 v.” Once
he left Barney Allen in charge of the front
of the house, and one of his casual snow-
flakes was the first thing presented at the
doors. “Vot ith dithV” asked Allen. “I
Joan’ know vot it ith. Vot ith it?’’ The
young person who owned the card explained
that Grant had given it as a pass. “Oh,
yeth!» Oh yetli!” said Allen. “But you
Joan’ go in the dreth-circle with that—
-2 O.lv. —thath two orchethtral thtallth!”
“Stargazer”: Alf Dampier was playing
Hamlet. The lady doing Ophelia was not
one of the numerous family, strange to say.
She was a fiery lady from Oskosli, or there-
about. Stage arrangements did not permit
of the grave for the ill-fated heroine having
a back way out,
and deceased had
to remain below
until after the sad
ceremony, which
fact led to an un-
fortunate contre-
temps, as the old-
fashioned reporter
would put it. The
churlish priest in
the course of his
fooling round
made a mis-step,
and slithered into
the grave. There
was an immediate
outcry from the
body. Nobody
knew where the
divine landed, but
Ophelia’s obj e c-
tions were such as
no lady-like corpse
would give expres-
si o n to. The
priest added to the
clamor a few

oaths, then came
scrambling up from
the grave, and

THE INTOLERABLE GOODNESS OF THE GOOD
OLD MEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The play of late days wearies me—
I sit and suffer when
Compelled for boresome hours to see
The smirking, nice old men.
The hero of past melodram
Was awful in his time;
The wicked wretch who used to damn
The heroine (a gentle lamb)
Was something of a crime.
But worse, far worse, than these to bear
Is that benignant fool
Who with bent back and thick grey hair
Pervades the Yankee school.
About the pretty heroine
His maudlin tears he drops
(He loved her ma in ’Sixty-nine).
Oh, would some thoughtful friend of mine
Put arsenic in his sops!
The Yanks are not content with one—
They often use a bunch.
The audience would think it fun
To choke the lot at lunch.
Their accent is a sickly feat
Of mawky sentiment,
Their smile is sticky, cloying, sweet,
A thing of' treacle, honey neat,
And thick, cold burgoo blent.*
The kindness of prim maiden aunts,
The love of grandmamma,
Their sleek and gracious manner haunts;
And then the unction—psha !
I think of curates slick with grace,
With soft, fat palm that coats
And dabbles all creation’s face.
How mad must be the Yankee race
That thus on dotage dotes!

The Prince will hunt Kinlark as well as
try to win one of the big soldiering chases (pre-
ferably the Grand Military) with him. As a matter
of fact, the horse is better suited for the big fences
and sweeping country of the shires than he is for
cramped little courses such as Sandown (a mile or
so outside London), and Hawthorn Hill (near Ascot),
where the soldier-horsemen disport themselves. A
fast, bold jumper like Kinlark, with a feather-
weight thruster of H.R.H.’s type on his back, ought
to be capable of cutting down any hunting field in
the world. But in the military events he will have
to meet thoroughbreds who, brushing through the
already low fences to the extent of a foot or more,
negotiate their 34 miles at something- very near
the pace at which the Derby is run.
The cabled suggestion that Kinlark may be un-
loosed for the Liverpool Grand National may be
taken with a good deal of salt. The best English
and Irish form over the big fences is inevitably miles
ahead of ours. Anyone who wants to figure out
Kinlark’s hopes against the wonderful lot of leapers
they have in the United Kingdom just now might
recall what happened to that real champion Moifaa
in his first race at Aintree.
The August meeting of the V.R.C. is the
wind-up of the jumping season in Melbourne, and
nags of National class are already beginning to go
out of business for the present. Saturday found
Will Comfort out of luck in his first jump, or out
of health, for the dashing performer of a week
previously was all behind in the early stages of
the August Hurdle, and quite unequal to a final
effort in the last furlong. Norman Godby’s stable
had another throw-in with Shadow Dancer, whilst
old Pistolier gathered the £BO second money. In
the Steeple veteran Doiraii added to his place win-
nings in the two big events by running home lengths
ahead of his field, but the books offered no induce-
ment for anyone to win a fortune over the good
thing. Doiran went out at 6 to 4. Then the cur-
tain fell on winter racing over the sticks. k
Of four winners on the flat the one that most
impressed the Flemington crowd was Strathredole
in the Tliree-year-old Handicap. He and Crimson,
the two topweights in a field of 10, came right
away from the others. Strathredole’s run, starting
when he was a long way back, eventually put him
well ahead of Crimson, so his weights for the two
Cups—7st. 51b. and 7st. 31b. —look not a pound
too much. All the same, there remains the fact that
Tressadv’s stock has hitherto been greater in pro-
mise than performance.
The slip between the cup and the lip hap-
pened to backers of Silver Heart, who had been
sent to Adelaide to win the A.R.C. Grand National
Hurdle. Stagefright made most of the running,
but at the last hurdle Silver Heart came at him
fast and threatened to outpace him in the run
home. Lo! the Australian Hurdle-winner bungled
the high-pressure jump, and Stagefright, with
Boyd up, was out of danger.

Last week John Wren’s horse, The Rover,
was backed for Caulfield Cup. By Sea Prince out
of Reminder, he is attractively bred, and the fact
that he was gelded early on" account of his Sea
Prince disposition is nothing against The Rover. It
was with a light-weighted fivie-year-old gelding
(Murmur) that Wren won the Caulfield Cup 16 years
ago. But Murmur was then an old Tasmanian
stager on the turf, whereas The Rover never raced
as a two- or three-year-old. Prudent punters think
a long while before backing anything that didn’t
run before it was a four-year-old, and then did
nothing to earn more than 7st. 51b. for next season’s
Cups. If this be a rod in pickle, it is well pickled.
The record of the animal rather suggests trouble in
training him.
Vincent Zed, the wealthy Adelaidean who
bought all contractor Timms’s big string of race-
horses as an experiment, is satisfied with it, and
proposes to start a local stud on the same generous
scale. He has sold his Lilydale (Vic.) stud farm, and
bought 150 acres at Enfield, just outside Adelaide.
Aides and Two will at present be the mainstay of
the establishment.
There was a remarkable run-off in a race
at Kadina (S.A.). Kercave and Royal Care dead-
heated, and a division was declined. When they went
to the post again Royal Care stayed there, and the
other covered the course alone. Of course the jockey
said he thought it was a false start; but he was sus-
pended for a month, all the same.
There were small fields at the Bananaland
Turf Club’s August Meeting, except in the Trial
and Welter. The most noticeable happenings were
another mishap to the unlucky Syce family, when
Syce Lad fractured a pastern, and the easy win of
the three-year-old Muquet (imp. Lilyveil—Silver
Song), who put the mile behind in lmin. 41£see.
* * * *
The Adelaide Grand National Hurdle gave
Boyd, who rode the winner, another boost. Stage-
fright’s victory was never in doubt after Silver
Heart fell. Lewis went over from Melbourne to ride
Gloaming’s sister Refraction in the Guineas, but the
diminutive Hesso made one act of the race and
Lewis’s mount only beat Earl Simon' a head. In
the two-year-old race—the Fulham Park Plate
(4fur.) —Lord Setay’s half-sister Lady Nallon (Eye-
glass—Lady Dudley) romped home in 50sec.
Last year the Tartan gelding Booster,
handicapped at Bst., was a strong order for the
Metrop.—until a week or two before the race. Hav-
ing run with conspicuous mulishness in a couple
of preliminaries, he was pulled out of the big
event and spelled. At the beginning of the winter
he came back to Mayo and Randwick, and, ridden
by an apprentice in the August Handicap (11 fur-
longs) at Rosehill on Saturday, did the best gallop
lately shown in public by any of this year’s Metrop.
bunch. He beat a fair lot very easily, carried 81b.
over his Metrop. weight, and did the trip in “22,”
which, on the Rosehill course, represents smart tra-
velling. Still, as a performer over a distance
against first-class horses, his record isn’t blinding.
Every time he started before this season at a mile
or seven furlongs he was a winner or second. But
out of six starts beyond a mile he was unplaced
five times. This season he has reversed things by
running unplaced at Randwick over a mile and
in the following week winning at a mile and three
furlongs. Provided he doesn’t go sour, he looks
wonderfully well handicapped at 7st. 91b. for the
longer journey and richer stake.

Early backers of Roi Ilerode’s son Chryso-
laus for the Epsom were thinking hard on Saturday
when they saw him cut it in the six-furlong Dundas
Handicap at Rosehill. There were 16 runners, and
of these about six were really in a hurry. Chry-
solaus only lost about a length at the tape this
time, and he was in the first flight at the end of a
furlong. He hit the straight just behind Remmon,
Portrait and Warspite, and, quickly chopping down
the last two, was with Remmon at the Leger. He
had obviously had enough at the distance, and though
he came again when Pike, who rode him verv
patiently, dr gw the flail in the last 20 yards, his
tail swished angrily in protest. Remmon beat him
a As an Epsom trial it was very moderate.
Melbourne bookmakers who bet straight-
out are protesting against the extra advt. permitted
to their brethren who practise “place” and conces-
sion” betting. These latter appealers to the artless
are allowed to display their odds on boards, whereas
the other fellows have thus far been forbidden to use
boards. The real interests of the public, perhaps;
would have been best served by prohibiting any
departure from the old system of bawling the odds
“straight-out.” Under the concession system,
w h i c h shortens odds
whilst undertaking to
return their money to
backers of the second
horse, no punter
knows exactly how
bad a deal he may be
making as compared
with an investment at
longer odds with no
saving clause in the
contract. And the
place-bettors tend to
increase the average
losses of the public.
For if the least illibe-
ral of the odds on offer
are accepted as market
prices, they never lay
a fair thing, even as
bortkmaking goes. How
much longer must Mel-
bourne wait for the
tote to put these men
out of business?
SAM ALLEN, who

A couple of years ago Y.R.C. chairman
Mackinnon gave 1100 guineas for Finmark’s yearling
brother and called him Fingon. In four tries
he was unnoticed. On Saturday at Roseliill, how-
ever, he was backed like a certainty for the Gran-
ville Stakes, an event for apprentice riders, in
which, incidentally, he carried the most accomplished
horseman of the learner-class at present riding on
Sydney courses. And the good thing duly came off.
Fingon has grown into a much finer-looking colt
than Finmark was at the same age when he arrived
from Maoiiland on the crest of a mammoth boom
and was beaten with great regularity. There was
nothing in Fingon’s win on Saturday to make a
noise over, but it was meritorious enough to sug-
gest that he may be a stayer in the making.
Glebe at full strength defeated an Eastern
Suburbs XIII last Saturday by 29 points (7 tries,
4 goals) to 21 points (3 tries, 6 goals)). The
surfers were without “Carb” Messenger, Cubitt,
Ray Norman and Watkins, so three second-graders,
L. Arthur, T. Burn and S. King, got a show. Burge
piled, up 15 of Glebe’s 29 points. Benson at serum-
half was very nippy and slung the leather about like
a tradesman; Bert Gray was in every scoring move-
ment, and Knight, the “Dirty Red” rake, frequently
beat Sandy Pearce for the ball. Easts, defending the
Paddington goal, had the advantage of a slight wind
in the first half, and Glebe could only register 18 to
their 11: it was in the second spasm that the ulti-
mate winners started to go great guns. The surfers’
best was one of the new-comers, S. King, a lad who
tackles like a Trojan, has plenty of toe and uses his
head. His try in the second half was a beauty.
Lees made the opening" near Easts’ 25, transferred
to King, who ran well and sent it to Cameron, who
handed it back, whereupon the colt put his boot to
it, and, after a 50yds. race, scored. Another good
performance was that of A. Thomson, a forward who
played as scrum-half. Solomon Kaufman being placed
as central three-quarter. Rex Norman lobbed six
goals out of seven attempts from half-way inwards
and at all angles. Glebe deserved to win, and the
scores are a true reflex of the merits of the teams on
the day. Their success prolongs the competition at
least another week. Next Saturday Balmain (23
points) will meet Glebe (20 points). In the other
matches Newtown downed Souths by 18 to 12 ;
Norths upended Wests by 25 to 14, and Uni. got
their usual weekly hiding, this time from Balmain,
and by 49 to 2. Annandale had the bye and went to
Goulburn, where they walloped a rustic XIII by
16 to 10 —their first win this season.
With ’Roy and Richmond level for first
place in the Vic. League struggle it was a matter,
on Saturday, of both sides piling up points against
their feeble adversaries, with an eye to a decision
that way. Richmond took on Melbourne and put
up a solid tally—l 34 to
Melbourne’s 60. ’Roy en-
gaged Essendon, and the
fast and light “Same Old”
simply made hacks. of the
maroons up, to three-
quarter time, when they
boasted 67 points to ’Roy’s
29. It looked a blue duck,
and the barrackers were
.dour and silent, save for
a few with sufficient spirit
to push road-metal at the
umpire. The position
called for something extra,
and ’Roy produced the
goods, gathering no less
than 54 points in that
last quarter while Essen-
don stood still—67 points
at the close to ’Roy’s 83.
Carlton covered Geelong
with mud and contumely
—lO4 points to 41 —and
South spiflicated St. Kilda,
83 points to 32. Saints
hadn’t Buckley’s chance
from the start, but that
didn’t prevent some of
their barrackers from
arguing the point with
South, several willing goes
among the admiring crowd
enlivening the tedium of
the game.
MORI ARTY (South
Adelaide), one of the
lest centre half-backs.
North Adelaide (S.A.) met N.S.W. under
Australian rules at Erskineville (Sydney) on Satur-
day. The visitors were taller, heavier and faster
than the Blues, and they excelled in high-marking
and kicking. The Walers were superior in ground-
work. Norths led in the first quarter by 34-19 ;at
half-time N.S.W. was ahead, 48-47. At the third
stage, Norths were again on top with 68-63 ; at the
“final bell,” the board showed: North Adelaide, 13
goals 15 behinds (93) ; N.S.W., 9 goals 11 behinds
(65).
Saturday’s Sydney Union football served
up one surprise—Glebe-Balmain’s defeat of Manly.
The Village, before an appreciative home audience,
led in the first half 10-6, with Mingay and James
well in the limelight. In .the second half, when it
was apparent that the visitors were out to win, stousli
became the order of the day. It was of little avail,
however. Watson, Bond and co. drew ahead: Manly
only drew blood. Final scores: 14-10. Mainly
owing to Newtown’s bulldog methods they were able,
in a heavy-scoring game against Mosman, to stave off
the Zoologists and retire three points to the good.
Surprising disregard for the rules was shown by
both sides. Trousdale, Oatley and Garnsey worked
hard to keep their fellow-boarders together, and Garn-
sey's kicking was the only gleam in a crude game.
Hicks, Scott and the hard-working McKay deserve
the credit for Newtown’s win. With all their star
players gone, a roving ’Varsity team went down by
14 points before Wests. Wests have developed a
pretty fair back division, and it was this department’s
efforts that counted. Champion played a slashing
game for the winners, and with Wogan, Shute and
Davis had the ball in hand pretty well all the
time. Williams and Hatherall were the pfek of the
Uni. crowd, whose enthusiasm fizzled out towards
the end. Norths (who beat Easts in the first
round) put up their best game to date on Saturday,
when they lost to the same crowd by six points.
Easts led by one point at half-time, and the players
were “all in.” During the second instalment the
Eastern forwards took the upper hand and kept the
Northern backs on the defensive. Walker, Dawson
and Marrot were the Eastern stars, while all
Norths shone, Fox and Humphries’ experienced play
being most noticeable.

Q. Soccerites were defeated for the fourth
time by N. S. Wales on Saturday. Scores 2 goals to
nil. The first half was scoreless. In the second F.
Hancock and J. Masters found thfe net for N. S.
Wales. The defensive work of goalkeepers F. Cox
(Q.) and R. Austen (N.S.W.) were the features of
the match.
* * * *
Billy Ripley, of Hexham, is the new
N. S. Wales sculling champion. It was a dreary
procession. Few tipped him to down McDevitt on
form; but he has had the advice of Ernest Barry
during the past two weeks, and there were quarters
in which he was supported heavily. As a match it
was a wash-out. After half-a-dozen strokes Ripley
went to the front, and when the gun boomed at
Searle’s monument the verdict was “by three lengths
in 21min. 36Jsec.” McDevitt scaled 12st. against
Ripley’s list. 21b. The new holder is an excellent
waterman, with a fine sweeping action; and his
form on Saturday was the best shown by him since
he landed the Parramatta Hundred in 1911. McDevitt
was using a new boat owing to a smash-up to his
racing outrigger during the previous week. He
should do better later on.
Felton and Barry put up the final deposits
for the world’s sculling championship last week, and
the full stake of £lOOO now awaits the winner of
next Saturday’s tussle. Both men have eased up in
their training. Felton is said to have done a great
trial over the full course recently. Old Bill Beach
is to be umpire and N. J. McDonald judge.
Dick Arnst has banged down £lOO for a match
with the winner. Arnst’s form is excellent, and he
has lost much of the splash which used to disfigure
his style.
* * * *
The defection first of Barnes and now of
Spooner leaves the coming English XI somewhat
drab. Barnes, on his day, is one of the most
interesting bowlers in the world. Spooner is easily
the prettiest bat. If F. E. Woolley cracks up—
and a cable last week mentioned that he had been
ordered rest by his doctor—the team will be little
more than second-class. Its greatest all-round attrac-
tion is likely to be the amateur Fender. Like Aus-
tralia’s new draw, Gregory, he is a giant, a tre-
mendous and persistent smiter, a bowler and a great
slip.
* * * *
Jack Green didn’t find Eddie Coulon diffi-
cult at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. The
Australian champion was in better nick, nearly
31b. heavier (the American bantam weighed out
at Bst. 7Jib.), and about twice as clever. Coulon
ran into the local youth’s forceful left monotonously,
and though he was a trier all the time he rarely
managed to land a hit on Green. Yet it was
Green who perpetrated such fouling as there was
during the struggle; the Yank was scrupulously
fair throughout. Coulon ought to be a lot faster
when he gets acclimatised. It was hard luck to be
stacked up against one so accomplished as Green
for his first display at the headquarters of the game.
One of the preliminaries was between Mick Horne
(12st. 81b.) and Reg Power (13st. lib.) just to
indicate to Stadium patrons that the race of heavy-
weights is not utterly dead in Australia.
* * * *
11. V. Thomas, Australia’s only tennis rep.
at the Olympic games, was beaten last week by the
Belgian champion Wesclie in three straight sets.
Thomas had to play on gravel, and this probably
accounted for his easy defeat. On grass the Adelaid-
ean is among Australia’s first flight. With O’Hara
Wood he won the World’s Doubles at Wimbledon
last year and has pushed both Wood and Patterson
to a five-set game. Patterson, by the way. didn’t
visit Antwerp, though he was expected to go and
capture one championship for this country.
* * * #
O’Neil 'put up a good performance when
the Vic. five-miles cross-country championship was
run at Geelong. He could not leave his job in time
to catch the train from Melbourne, something went
wrong with a motor-car which was to pick him up,
and it was after 2 o’clock, with the race to start
at half-past 3, when he hopped on the back
of a motor-cycle for the run. They got over the
40-odd miles to the course in a little over an hour,
and he stripped, led most of the way, and was only
beaten by five yards by Tom Vines in the good time
of 28min. lsec.

Of 26 entrants for the N. S. Wales ladies’
golf championship at Rose Bay (Sydney) last week
only eight were Misses, and in the end Mistress Bar-
ton won. The stroke play was good in the prelim-
inary rounds; but it was even better in the semi-
finals, when Miss Boys brilliantly defeated Miss
Wray (7 up and 6) in the brightest golf of the
meeting; and after a ding-dong battle, Mrs. Barton
was too good for Mrs. Thornthwaite by one stroke.
The final was a test of temperament and methods.
In the early stages Miss Boys looked like having a
runaway win, and at the turn (nine holes) led
by five strokes, with 41 (bogey 40) against 46. But
Mrs. Barton plugged along, and the plugging dis-
turbed Miss Boys. By fine golf Mrs. Barton got
nearer, and Miss Boys made mistakes and more
mistakes. At the 17th hole, when the game was
still in her hands, she failed in an easy putt; and
at the 18th Mrs. Barton again won. At the “extra”
Mrs. Barton proved superior, and the sensational
game was over. The winner, who plays with Leura,
has a fine, free swing, and off the tees hits with
great power; but except in the closing stages her
“approach” was bad. Her driving was the longest
seen on the links in this class of event. Early
in the week she outplayed the opposition for the
Country Championship, and won that, too, with 177
against Miss Doak’s 206.

Bob Barbour, Queensland Rhodes scholar
for 1920, has a varied sporting appetite, although
he favors cricket and tennis. A couple of weeks
ago he helped Queensland v. N.S.W. at tennis; and
last year he was in the rep. cricket XI. He inherits
the complaint from his father, George P. Barbour,
now headmaster of Toowoomba Grammar, formerly
of Sydney Grammar, who a quarter-century ago and
later did big things in Sydney cricket. Eric Bar-
bour, one of N.S.W.’s finest colts before the Hun
smashed up cricket, is another of the family.

“15-30”: Norman Brookes has been ap-
pointed selector of the Australian Davis Cup team
to meet the Americans —probably Johnston and Tilden
—at Auckland in December. Unless a new genius
is discovered in the summer championships, his
job will be confined to picking a squad from O’Hara
Wood, Patterson, Rod Heath, Thomas and himself.
Patterson and Wood are certainties, unless Rod
Heath does well enough to earn a place. Heath,
however, is now something of a veteran, and that is
a handicap. Thomas may get a chance as a reserve;
but Brookes is likely to rely on Patterson, O’Hara
Wood and himself. Anderson, of the Ma State, will
have to reach a higher standard to get a chance
against the Americans. In the Davis Cup last year
he certainly won once at the expense of Lowe, but
the latter is a by-no-means formidable base-line
player, and wasn’t considered good enough to appear
for Britain against the U.S. recently.
THE NECK-TO-KNEE EXCESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The fashionable Spring gown weighs about soz.
Despite everything, the tendency for women is to-
wards less and less in the way of wearing material.”
The dress of woman slowly fades
From mortal view. They say
A tliree-ounce frock, with trifling aids,
Will on a summer day
Be all the cover any dame
Of fashion here will care to claim.
Meanwhile a bareness wide and chill
Creeps down the lady’s back.
A scrap of lace, a bit of frill
For holding up the slack,
And no more bodice will you find
If viewing madam from behind.
Spring skirts will shorter be, we’re told,
And made of lighter stuff,
Although in days of winter cold
They have been short enough ;
And smarter girls may, if they care,
Display the shin-bone wholly bare.
Right here arises great concern—
Will Coogee fare as well
When summer suns with ardor burn?
Will Manly lose its spell
When any girl who surfing goes
Must put on extra lots of clo’es?

, r . T ! ie P O PUHir idea is wrong that Prime
Minister Hughes advised Lloyd George to
interfere with the movements of Archbishop
Mannix on the other side of the world. At
any rate, our Billy has told political friends
that he thinks sowebody made a great mis-
take. in putting a martyr’s crown on his
political foe. His own idea is that so much
had been talked of the Archbishop’s influ-
ence and mischievousness by the Argus and
other papers that the British Government
had formed an exaggerated idea of his fire-
brand possibilities.
Wellington, the discreet “Better not” of
various Government Houses in Australia,
has earned one of those odd distinctions in
which England seems to see nothing funny.
He has. been private secretary to Queen
Mary; now he rises to the giddy altitude of
King s groom-in-waiting.”
J. M. Niall made a tremendous gift to
the Prince—passed over to him Kinlark,
winner of the last Australian Steeplechase,
ihe Goldsbrough-Mort magnate is very
ambitious on behalf of his favorite daughter
Maggie, who married Captain Burnham, an
A.D.C. of the Denman period. The tall
polo-player and cricketing enthusiast is still
in the Army—he went to the Cavalry Depot
at Canterbury after he came back from the
war.
Word comes from overseas that a charm-
ing young matron who lately legally freed
herself from a distinguished soldier-husband
has now. started on a second matrimonial
career with a good-looking Englishman.
Dr. Barry Thompson, of Collins-street,
has taken himself hnd his handsome wife to
Brisbane for the Medical Conference. Direc-
tor-of-Quarantine Cumpston has gone the
same way, and several others whose brass-
plates denote something special have also
hurried north.
"Tryphena” Lady Doughty mourns the
loss of a devoted little niece, who tripped so
gaily through her few brief years burdened
with no more serious a name than Cherry
btone. Her father, Tom Stone, was “Try-
phena’s” only brother. He was in business
here until "Tryphena’s” old knight gave him
a job in Canada. Later on be trekked to
England and became a county councillor.
The charming little Cherry was the only
child, and was the adored of her brilliant
aunt. 1 ,
George Godfrey, doyen of Victorian
solicitors, or very near it, is dead at 80. A
son of Cockaigne, he practised in Melbourne
for 55 years, and was an M.L.C. for nine.
For 20 years he was treasurer of Melbourne
Hospital, and contrived to be a company
director when he found the time.
Godfrey’s Parliamentary service was ren-
dered in the ’nineties, when it was fashion-
able to have an average of two or three
of the Chosen People in each Chamber.
Joseph Sternberg, “Father” of the Legisla-
tive Council, whom Bendigo first elected in
’9l, is now, apparently, .the only one in
either House of the State Parliament.
• After being caught in a whirl of farewell
frivols, Madge and ,Nora Currie are off to
England via America. They go under the
wing of their widowed aunt, Mrs. Cox.
Aunt had re-visited her native Melbourne
to see her father, Robert Murray Smith,
now nearing the nineties, who still shelters
in his old Toorak home.
The sun shone on Wattle 'Day in Mel-
bourne, and the tendency to be as bright as
the button that comes with the Spring was
quite general. But even under a scowling
sky the average citizen is a fairly easy mark
on Wattle Day, for the cause of the sick
children is appealing and money-boxers are
out for business rather than frivolity. The
silk stocking in the three-guinea-shoe was
hardly noticeable on the warpath last Fri-
day. Nurses, not Circes, battled for the
more stubbornly-defended shillings, and a
sense of duty, not beauty, was what they
finally sufl'endered to. As for the sprinkling
of stalls in the streets, they looked hardly
worth while.
The “farm” on which Colonel Dave
Fulton, of Adelaide, is going to settle in
Palestine is Bar Salem. In pre-war days it
was a German estate, and during the
Palestine campaign—in which Colonel Dave
did yery fine work—it was Allenby’s head-
quarters. The property includes nearly 800
acres of orange-trees in full bearing and
about 2000 acres of agricultural land. It is
Stitt' lll Part: occupied by British Divisional
D-D. Mrs. Fulton and a small daughter
have returned to Egypt after spending a few
months in Adelaide.
Blessing her fine family, whose solicitude
had made the sunset of her life happy, Mrs
Mary Brennan has passed out at Parkville.
b>he was the mother of seven sons and three
daughters, most of "whom have done some-
thing to keep the world moving. Tom. after-
making his mark in journalism, put on wig
and gown, and mopped up most of the
practice Maxwell used to have on the crimi-
nal side; Willie (leader writer) and Harry
(senior reporter) help to bring out the
Akgus ; Frank, when not making things un-
pleasant for Hughes in the House of Reps.,
runs a big legal business in Collins-street,’
with the aid of a partner and learned sister
Anna; Dick, like his late dad, is the Fitz-
gibbon of Strathfieldsaye Shire. Settling at
Bendigo in the roaring ’fifties as a bride in
her teens, Mrs. Brennan was one of the best
°|*, Pioneers. Her wish to be buried in her
old district was gratified.
Representatives of the Army Nurses’ Coun-
cil had a friendly pow-wow with those of the
Returned Soldiers’ Ass. one day last week
concerning club premises for themselves at
Alizac House. And why not'r President
Martin said that the only thing he could see
against it was that, according to the R.S.A.
constitution, no one could be admitted there
unless lie had been on active service. Former
Matron-in-Chief Richardson and Matron
Dwyer, ol Bendigo, both Royal Red Crossers,
had their little say, and hoped the Diggers

Lately the Parliament, of the little island
down south threatened to discuss manners
1 ranli Rond, who occupies far more than the
average seating accommodation in the Upper
House, and usually snores peacefully, asked
whether it was the intention of the Attor-
ney-Leneral to prohibit the landing in Tas-
mania of undesirable persons such as Judge
Ewing, who had just let a batch of I.W.W
prisoners loose in Sydney. The question
was no sooner out than it fell dead—frozen
o.j the polite stare which the decorous Pre-
sident Lant always keeps ready. Next day
t r e xJ oll V wmg a PPeared on the notice paper
of the Assembly :
. .wt Lyons to ask the Honorable the Premier
whether he will bring in an amendment of “The
Constmition Act to provide tiiat good • manners
fnr tiin t • ? e 5? qualification for a candidate
nf I s r Council, in view of the ignorant
ML mf red i x? ne , of Australia’s finest Judges
by the Honorable Frank Bond?
Though the Speaker eventually excused Pre-
mter Lee from any obligation to answer the
question (as it reflected upon a member of
‘ another place”). the fact that it had been
printed in all the newspapers and had ap-
peared on the Assembly notice paper for
more than a fortnight, left none of the poli-
ticians in the case room to complain of lack
of advertisement.
A gentle damosel brought to this country
by her father to play her first theatrical en-
gagement may almost be called an Australian
actress, especially if she has an Australian-
born sister. Rosalind Courtneidge had made
two or three fugitive
appearances on the
English stage, under
father’s management,
just to get her foot
in, but the trip to
Australia with the
‘.‘Man from Toronto”
co. was her start in
life as a professional
actress. How far the
fair novice is likely
to go in her profes-
sion may be judged
from her impersona-
tion of the athletic
Canadian girl in the
comedy. The charac-
ter (presented in the
photo) is quite
foreign to her real
young self. She is naturally a studious
Rosalind, indifferent to all the sports she
talks about in the play. Yet she is hardly
out of the tomboy age. Seventeen years
ago, when her Australian sister Cicely re-
turned to this country with her parehts and
made her first venture on the stage (as
a juvenile fairy in “Midsummer Night’s
Dream”), Rosalind Courtneidge was not
born. She is positively so young that she
would like to be older, or thinks she would,
and has lately put her hair up with a view
to looking so.
Adelaide passes the time o’ day:—
The very practical wife of his Ex. has lately
formed a Sunshine Guild. It consists of about 30
girls of the younger set, and is recruited chiefly
from the cheery crowd that comes to her small but
frequent dances. The members have pledged them-
selves to try to bring a little brightness into the
lives of the sick and suffering. There is no patron
and patroness, but the scheme is well organised and
should do a lot of good. The miserable Isolation
Hospital, where Adelaide incarcerates her dying
consumptive and cancer patients in the sadddst and
gloomiest of surroundings, is their first mark, and
the making of 80 gaily-flowered cretonne bedspreads
and table-covers is already arranged for.
Small Priscilla Weigall has a scheme of her own.
She has appealed in a childish letter for clothes,
toys, books and biscuits for the children of strug-
gling settlers on the Murray settlements. His Ex.
and Priscilla are shortly going up the river, and the
comforts are to be distributed from their boat.
One of the best-liked members of the younger set,
Eda Seeck, was married to Bob Barr Smith on
Wednesday. The fair-haired little bride is an Aus-
tralian-bred daughter of 'Russian parents, and the
bridegroom the promising hope of Tom, head of
the wealthy Barr-Smith clan.
That fascinating young person, Helen Dempster,
only daughter of the late G. W. Dempster, who was
for many years a Port Adelaide banker, has con-
sented to make Ferdie Elkan happy.
It is rumored that the Weigall pair have examined
the vice-regal summer residence at Marble Hill, shud-'
dered and gone house-hunting at the seaside. Glen-
elg has a number of roomy mansions aching to be
bought, thus relieving the owners of white elephants
they cannot staff.
That fine surgeon, Dr. Cudmore, fought a despe-
rate round this week with pneumonia. The hand-
some white-haired medico married a Cavanagh-
Maimvaring, who is at present visiting England.
Kathleen Pomeroy, A.R.R.C., well-known to Dig-
gers who recovered at No. 3 General Hospital at
Wandsworth (Eng.), is visiting relations in Adelaide.
She was born in this city, but left with her parents
for London many years ago.
C. T. Hassie, secretary of the S.A. branch of the
0.8. U., had a rough time at Glossop last week. The
settlers are mainly returned soldiers who have felt
sore for some time at their treatment by labor organ-
isations. When the 0.8. U. ambassador started to
address them from his box they cooled him off in
an irrigation channel.
A number of our Very Best matrons and maids
organised a The Dansant for Thursday last in aid
of the Lady Victoria Buxton Girls’ Club. All our
Naicest People turned up ;>t the Osborne Hall, and
the show proved a huge success financially and other-
wise. The male attendance was limited'but decora-
tive.
The late Mrs. Barr Smith, of Torrens Park, Mit-
cham, left property valued at .£312,874, mostly in
S. Aus. A set of diamond earrings went to Lady
Tennyson, and £3OOO to the Hon. Victor Hood.
Matron Rose Sherrin, of Torres Strait
Hospital, daughter of Mrs. Sherrin, of Nor-
rnanton (N.Q ) has engaged herself to Wil-
fred G. 11. Hodges (Radio Service), only
son of Mrs- Summons, of Malvern, and of
the late Chas. F. Hodges.
Three broken engagements! The respec-
ts®. sons of a doctor and a naval officer are
ruefully wondering what to do with the
expensive half-hoops handed back to them.
J he third recipient will probably take a more
philosophic view, seeing that this is the
second time he has lost the lady. Yet the
j oung man is a smart, -attractive bachelor
with a nice, fat banking account. Girls talk of
sacrificing one’s liberty” these times. One
modern miss declares that her ambition is
to live the unfettered life of a Society
spin.,” with a husband in the offing to save
her from being posted as , an old maid.
August 18 was a red-letter day in the life
ut that popular squatter-sport, Jack Feehan.
Lbs horse Strangeways romped in winner of
the Hunt Club Cup a few hours before his
seasoned bachelor-owner got married to Dolly
Nugent, of Shepparton. The bridegroom’s
astounded men-pals are only just coming out
of the chloroform.
Joyce Nankivell, after venturing a few
patriotic poetical outbursts in the Herald,
has skipped off to sharpen her pen in Blighty.
She sprang a mine in the family circle last
week with a bulky epistle signed “Joyce
Loch in which she explained that she and
Sydney Loch, of “The Straits Impregnable,”
had agreed to collaborate for life.
Marion Jones, the petite Bendigo artist
who lately fled to Europe on a National Gal-
lery scholarship, has settled down in Lon-
don, where she is going to start painting as
soon as she can capture a suitable studio.
Through the help of Lady Munro Ferguson
s “ e aas Sot into exclusive circles that in-
clude quite a number of picture-buyers.
Presently she will have a little private show
that will present some of her best work in
oils and further exhibit her dash in pastels.
Natalie Dawson should benefit greatly
by the concert arranged for her by Mrs. May
Quinnell and others. There were many per-
formers, and in their brotherly and sisterly
love _ and bounty they went close to ex-
terminating the audience with encores. Wal-
ter Kirby left this sordid earth for a few
minutes on wings of song, and Alberto Zel-
man fiddled soothingly. Mayoress Stein heard
the first half of the programme in a purple
velvet cloak. The beneficiare herself sat
close by in brown velvet, laden with floral
offerings, but with a pale face that told its
tale of hospitals and sick-beds.
John McCormack spent his Sunday out at
Abbotsford with the Sisters of the Good
Shepherd, singing to them and their large
flock. He has exchanged the quiet of Clive-
den for the delights of the Oriental.
Diana Wilson’s admirers are disappointed
at finding her off the boards and doing the
Block in severe clothes of almost masculine
cut. A walking-stick is part of the outfit.
It she wants to carry something, whv not
Diana s bow and arrow?
“Jedbury Junior,” which the Scotch Col-
lege rama tic Society has been running at
the Playhouse for several nights, is likelv
to bring in £2OO net to the College War
Memorial Fund. F. E. Lear, late of Wil-
liamson’s, was its producer, and James
Jamieson, one of the “Scotch” masters, was
responsible for the excellent amateur orches-
tra. All the characters, male and female,
were taken by collegians.
Conrad Sayce has completed three big
tales two are to be published by Con-
st. a Me s, of London; the other, christened
“Golden Buckles,” is being pushed through
the press by the
energetic Alex.
McCubbin, of Mel-
bourne, and will
shortly hit the book-
buyer in the eye
with an attractive
cover-design. Sayce,
who has written
much on Central
Australia, is one of
those men who must
push out. An in-
quisitive mind and
hunger for adven-
ture took him to {he
middle of the con-
tinent, and he ha*
circulated in those
regions. for several
years, playing the
parts of undertaker and parson, doctor and
camel-puncher, opal-gouger and book-keeper,
station manager and protector of aborigines,
just as circumstances demanded. It’s a
great life for a free spirit, and the thrall
of it shines in the stories. Sayce is so
struck with the color and interest of Central
Australia that he is returning to it in
November. The young writer, who is here
caught by Muntz, of Malvern, was educated
for the Church.
The appearance of Marie Tempest and
Graliame Browne in a box at the opening of
“The Yeomen of the Guard” on Saturday
brought idle hands into play, and the couple
doubled over like debutantes to the wild
applause. Marie had gone to emerald-green
as a suitable support for her Titian locks,
which, by the way, retired later under a hat
that looked like the skeleton of a pagoda.
Most of the Best Dressers were at the Royal,
but there was something to admire in the
twentieth-century tango effects of Elsie’s
and Phoebe’s slim ankles in the show. Pro-
bably Phoebe’s scarlet stockings, with the
tango straps twining upwards from the
smart high-heeled shoes, laid out another
solemn tradition. All the same, they held
the eye when the rest of the lady wasn’t
proving a serious counter-attraction. «
One of these days, perhaps, somebody will
suggest an alteration in the title of our
Germanised music-schools. Conservatorium
is the Hun equivalent for conservatory in,
English, conservatoire French, or 'con-
servatorio in Italian. The “ium” should go.
And there is no special reason why the rest
should stay. It is long-winded and clumsy.
There isn’t any reason why the conservatory
shouldn’t be called what it is, a school. It
is no more entitled to wear frills than the
university institution which trains surgeons
and physicians; and that delights to be
called the Medical School. The other seem-
ingly shied off the plain, honest name because
matters of art are, to so many of its pro-
fessors, matters of humbug.
The art boom in Melbourne is notable for
the commissions charged by the plausible
gentlemen who are running some of the
shows. Most of the artists are at the mercy
of these people, whose justification for cut-
ting a thick slice off the proceeds is that
they can reach a large and exclusive clien-
This may be all right from the man-
ager’s point of view, but his commission
compels the poor artist to increase his prices
if he wants to cover his other expenses and
get something reasonable for himself. Inevit-
ably his chances of sales are diminished
thereby, and all the soft words of interested
spruikers who hover round the picture-
buyers at these exhibitions will not sell a
canvas that is disrated by its price. The
obvious remedy for the artists is to save
the agent’s commission and give their own
displays under the care of one of their
number. This is done in the Meldruin exhi-
bitions, with the result that the artists are
able to offer a good article at a modest
price, which will cover all the expenses for
framing, advertising and hall-hire and still
leave them with a profit that can be noticed.
The cocktail habit grows. The front line
of social defence does not favor it; but in
Suburbia the bottle frequently replaces the
teapot. At a recent smart luncheon-party
some of the women could hardly manage
their knives and forks. It was not the
quantity but the quality that beat them. The
mixture was one of the double-barrelled
varieties usually brewed for hardened male
palates.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
David
Jones
Catalogue
On Thursday in the noonday sunshine the
I rmceling sailed away, leaving six more
match-boxes and cigarette-cases to mark his
trail. Of the six special couriers who
ploughed through wind and cloud to hand
him the letters from the Home Circle, the
two, Captain Jones and Sergeant Chester,
who were in at the kill were commanded to
the Presence on the Renown, and gravely
handed the Royal Gifts. Maybe the match-
boxes and the cigarette-cases hold each a
jewel such as a Rajah might have given in
Reward for such signal service. Of
course the lasses the Prince played-about
with are disconsolate, but so certain are they
of the entree into the very core of Bucking-
ham and Windsor that they are all looking
up P. and O. bookings; and Arthur Allen
thinks of buying up Mayfair as a flat spec.,
so that the girls and the Walker twins and
Arthur himself and Ken Austen may be with-
in 000-ee any time Edward yearns for a yarn
with some fair-dinkum Aussies.
j Ut ‘k a pity the Wentworth management
had not been given earlier notice of the
Prince’s visit! When he arrived with his
Court, the cafe was almost empty of mere
Aussies, and those present were dining at
the usual charges. The Royal party had the
time of its life, though Margaret Allen must
have felt a qualm or two about the gorgeous
ball dad was staging that same night at
Merioola, with H.R.H. cast for lead. The
Princeling, who in his gaiety started the
Brisbane game of tie-snatching, refused to
leave the white-and-gilt room till the hard
hearted City regulations caused the Went-
worth lights to be doused. The Royal party
arrived at Merioola at midnight.
It was midnight again before Edward
came on” to the Matrons’ Ball in the
Paddington Town Hall, and then he brought
ms own party who had dined and danced with
him at the Wentworth. This time, although
the tariff had jumped, the caf6 was packed
out with those who still, flower-like, turned
to their sun, although their hopes of intimate
comradeship had at last wilted. Rosamund
Lumsdaine, Nell Joske, Barbara Bowker and
Phyllis Macarthur were among those who
basked at tables set apart from the
charmed one. The full white light of
Royal favor fell on Mollie Little as
it had done the night before, and she
bore up very well under it in a new
frock mainly of cream lace and gold tissue.
Aileen Bell and Ursula Catterall were the
female supports in white and blue drapings
respectively. The Weigalls and Halsey played
propriety, and Mountbatten was cast as
second-best partner. The opportunity being
too good to miss, a flashlight of the (almost)
Viennese scene was taken, and the Prince
attached his “Edward P.” to a copy, and also
to the two menus that are now locked up
with Mrs. Maclurcan’s diamonds. When the
party left the Wentworth it went off to cheer
up the matrons who had pooled their £4O
a-piece to entertain H.R.H., and as he left
again about 2 a.m. each dame, roughly speak-
ing, paid at the rate of £2O the hour for
Edward’s presence. In addition, Mrs. Ernest
Watt lost a coat valued at 100 guineas
which she had left on a chair between two
and three o’clock. The ball was very ex-
clusive.
“Hare and Hounds” is one of the games
they played aboard the Renown, and at the
farewell party given by the Princeling
Edward P. was the hare, and a jolly time
the younger set had.
The Manly V.A.D.’s gave a dance last
week to which they invited the officers of the
Renown; and they kept their programmes
open for the arrival of the expected gold
braid. And then, about 8.15, instead of the
officers coming themselves, Jack Tars arrived
smoking cigarettes which they put behind
their ears when taking up a partner. Poor
V.A.’s, and lots of ’em with new frocking
for the quarter-deck, too!
Mollie Little pow has a silver cigarette
case with “To Mollie from Edward P.”
written across it. Mollie scored more heavily
than anyone else, evidently, as she now has
a photograph and a fag-holder to remind her
of the “boy-and-girl” friendship. Auto-
graphed programmes are all that most of our
Best have in a material way to remind them
of H.R.H. There is talk of Sheila Lough-
borough coming to her people next year; and
Mollie may return to the City of High
Prices with her—though not as Mollie Little.
Addison, of Hobart, who collected
an 1.5.0, in the honor-list last week, is more
or less related to N. S. Wales. He married
the other day the handsome widow of ex-
benator John Downer, of S. Aus. Before
,her first marriage she was Una Russell, of
bydney, and had a reputation as a painter
in water-colors.
Brigadier-General Bertie Lloyd, who got
a C. Vattended to the general itinerary
froin the time H.R.11. arrived in Melbourne
to the date of his final appearance at the
bydney railway station. Nominally, the
General got his decoration for that; but
lie is said to have earned it by his stories
alone. In addition to being a front-rank
amateur actor. General Lloyd knows every
anecdote that has ever been retailed and a
tew over.
Official photographer Brookes, whose
camera made the records of the Royal tour,
took a picture of the Moiseiwitsch family—
Daisy and Benno and little Tanya, with Roy
Agnew and Mrs. de Beaupuis. The photo-
graph is to go to the Tatler, and kindly
Moiseiwitsch insisted on Roy being promi-
nent in jthe picture, for he regards the young
Australian as a heaven-born composer, and
on Thursday evening plays his “Dance of
the Wild Men” and “Deirdre’s Lament.”
■through the Moiseiwitsch recognition a Mel-
bourne publishing house is buying the Aus-
tralian rights of some of Agnew’s composi-
tions.
Another photograph to appear soon in the
Jatler is one of Mrs. Henry Hill Osborne.
Brookes describes her as the most beautiful
subject his camera-eyes saw in Australia.
the Bjelke-Petersens, at whose physical-
culture school the Prince played squash
rackets and had other exercises, received
gifts at a farewell visit. The lieut.-colonel’s
trophy is a Prince of Wales feather tie-pin
set in diamonds; Harold’s a set of sleeve-
Jinks with the Prince’s crest and feathers.
And there are autographed photos of Edward
taken with the brethren.
Tall, graceful Eily Malyon came to Aus-
tralia nine years ago with Ethel Irving to
play m “Lady Frederick.” About this time
she became Mrs. Plumpton Wilson, Plump-
ton also being with the Ethel Irving co. Be-
fore she left London she was one of the Lon-
don, I .? t M e Society’s player’s, and acted
in Hedda Gabler,” “Maternity,” and all
the other wonder-
ful and extremely
gloomy plays that
seemed synonymous
with Repertory work
about 10 yeai's ago.
Here she has
appeared under both
the J. C. Williamson
and the Tait man-
agement (being one
of the caste of “Old
Lady 31”), and was
also associated with
Gregan McMahon in
his Repertory ven-
tures in Melbourne.
Now she has set up
as a teacher of stage
craft, and hopes to
help the intellectual
play on its way in Sydney, Her immediate
ambition is to present Calderon’s “The
Fountain.” London? Perhaps again some
day, but the incurable seasickness which
has marooned her so long and “so happily,”
she says, in Australia is likely to anchor her.
Elizabeth Nash-Boothby, of Melbourne, took
the picture.
The old Anzac Buffet has been taken pos-
session of by Young Australia, who sleeps
and romps happily enough there through the
long day while mother is out working. The
committee of the Sydney Day Nursery is
very jubilant over the re-opening of the
Woolloomooloo branch of its undertaking,
and was at home last week to the Nursery’s
friends. Minister McGirr, who knows more
about motherhood than any other father in
Australia, was unfortunately kept away
from the opening, but Solicitor-Gen. Sproule
and Mr. Innes-Noad filled the breach, taking
care to emphasise the fact that the Buffet
was only being used till the Nursery in
Burton-street is ready. One side of the
pavilion is filled with white cots brightened
with little quilts bearing the Red Cross.
In these, through all the party talk and
laughter, the babies drowsed, here and there
setting up an impatient wail as slumber
was disturbed. One small dark-haired beauty
slept with two fingers thrust between red
lips, the other hand flung palm upwards
upon the pillow. On the other side of the
pavilion the big ones of two or maybe four
have a playroom to romp in, boys and girls
covered up in gay Turkey-red pinafores,
alike to the very last stitch. After the final
speech, the little red coats gathered about
the piano, and piped the King to good for-
tune in a real Australian “God Save!” Sec-
retaries Ethel Ranken, wearing a rose pink
velour hat, and Mrs. G. Roystone Davey, in
navy tailorings, did the honors at a party
which included Mrs. Ellison Rich, Miss
Roseby, Mrs. MacCallum, Dr. Mary Booth
and Dr. Jamieson’s wife, who wore nigger-
brown tailorings and the smartest headgear
present.
The Presbyterian College Old Girls had
their hop last week in the Paddington Town
Hall and helped to warm the floor for
H.R.H.’s pumps the following evening. This
dance is famous for having six chaperons
(all in black), as well as the Superintendent
of the Croydon Presbyterian College, Miss
Tait, she with variations of heliotrope, to
play Propriety. Elsie Clayton, President
of the ex-Students’ Union, wore ivory net
and satin, and Secretary Doris Erly and
Treasurer Doris Northcote chose the same
coloring in georgette and satin.
Tim Patients’ Recreation Association of
the Waterfall Sanatorium says “Thank you”
to those few who sent on games and packs
of cards in answer to its appeal, and reminds
those who so far have not responded that the
sanatorium is at the same address, and that
the need is great.
The prettiest and most interesting figure
at the -dreeskin-Costelloe concerts is Mrs.
Elias Breeskin. Tall and slim, she wears
her hair in the brushed-back marcel-wave
style that is impossible to one who has not
a well-shaped nose. One of her wraps is
a golden affair of brocade, with a deep collar
of brown velvet. She sits very still while
Elias makes his fiddle sing as sweetly and
passionately as an unsophisticated bachelor
nightingale on his first night-out.
Mrs. Simpson, wife of a former Judge in
Divorce, returns to Sydney about November.
She went to London to see her soldier-grand-
son Julian, who came back from the wars
with a chest full of medals. She is tired of
paying £9 a week for a room at a family
hotel where the guests have to supply their
own sugar and biscuits and coffee and most
of their own butter. Her sight, her friends
in Australia will be glad to hear, is quite
restored.
Artist Florence Rodway acquired a
wedding-ring last week. Ex-soldier Walter
Moore handed it over at St. Philip’s, Church
in. the presence of Canon Bellingham.
Walter is a civil engineer.
Round Brisbane’s tea-tables:—
The workers of the South Brisbane Red Cross
Society had a shivoo the other night, and pressed on
Mrs. John Allan, their hon. sec., a silver cake-
basket and an address. A special vote of thanks
was the reward of the hon. treas., Mrs. Maurice
Baldwin.
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Leitch (she was Betty Cock-
burn) are off to America shortly.
Mrs. R. H. Moss will spread the farewell scone
next Saturday in honor of Mrs. Champlin, the
capable principal of the Kindergarten College, who is
leaving Bananaland.
J. E. Foley has been created Chevalier of the
Legion of Honor for his work on the Chinese
Eastern Railway. The new Chevalier was once on
the Bananaland railways, and his brother is in the
Chief Auditor’s office here.
Flying-men Parer and Mclntosh, whose trip to
Australia is one long story of rotten luck and splen-
did courage, were given fine receptions in every
Bananaland town they visited. At Longreach a
purse of £4O was passed over, and the Mayor of
Rockhampton has opened a fund for them. Both
men looked very tired. Their voices grow almost
womanly tender when they speak of the little
Siddeley-Puma engine which brought them so far.
Mrs. Parer was at Longreach to meet her son. There
isn’t a prouder woman in Australia to-day.
Betty, the Tom Woolnoughs’ youngest daughter,
has accepted the usual diamond from Robert Bar-
bour, son of the Toowoomba Grammar School Bar-
bours, and Rhodes Scholar for 1920.
A packed house watched Lieut.-Governor Lennon
open his first Parliament. Mrs. Lennon wore nigger-
brown charmeuse, furs and a small nigger-brown hat.
Daughter Eva was in navy blue. Mrs. Jack Fihelly
wore sage green, relieved with black satin and a big
picture-hat: Mrs, Bill Gillies, oyster-grey silk and
a black hat; Mrs. J. Huxham, a tailored serge cos-
tume ; and Mrs. Whittingham mastic with brown
furs and a brown hat covered with poppies. None of
the Supreme Court Judges put in an appearance,
and the red frocks and poodle-dog wigs were sadly
missed. Various other dignitaries also stayed away.
Sydney art-lovers are dropping in at the
rooms of Gayfield Shaw, at Penzance
Chambers, to see Sydney Ure Smith etchings.
The show is to last a fortnight. Incidentally,
a complete catalogue of Smithsonian etchings
will be on view. Printed by Percy Green, it
is a fine, example of the art of book-making,
contains 12 reproductions on art paper and
one original etching, and the whole edition of
50 copies vanished like the morning dew
at three guineas.
~ filler, the new skipper of
the Melbourne, reached Sydney last week.
He s an affable soul who wears his gold braid
as though it didn’t hurt him. Mrs. Miller
is on her way from the Cold Country.
At a meeting of University women last
week, Dr. Marjory Little, lecturer and
demonstrator in pathology, related that when
after two. years of war the British Govern-
ment decided to use the services of women
doctors which in the beginning it had
rejected, they were ordered to proceed to
the Near East” by a certain ship. Nothing
was told them about uniform, but when they
arrived on board, just as the vessel was
leaving, the captain positively refused to
take them in civilian dress. All thev could
do was to borrow some military from
t ce Di. Little was one of the British Foot!

Flow fai is Russia and its red-flaggers
from a small boy boating on the Avon?
Alibi ey \\ illiams, of Christchurch, whose
likeness Judith Fletcher reproduces for you
is a Maorilander who lived through the
Revolution in Petrograd and was still there
when the Bolshevik terror was unleashed.
He had been for
some years in Russia,
where also was his
brother Harold, the
St. Petersburg cor-
respondent of the
London Times.
Afterwards. Aubrey
was one of the
Anglo-Russian Com-
mission that inquired
into Bolshevism, and
found that under
Soviet rule the quick
laughter that had’
been so much a fea-
ture of the Russian
had vanished from
th e half - starved
cities.
In Russia before the war, if you had no
political wrongs to right, you got on very
well, unless you.lost count and invited nine
people instead of eight to a party of which
y°u had not notified the*police. University
students, hot-headed and quicfc-tongued, like
students all the world over, got regularly
into and sometimes out of political scrapes
Anarchist meetings and bomb-making were
not the favorite pastimes in the family circle
in the long evenings; music and dancinz
were more attractive to the bulk of the
liberals, who included most of the progres-
sive aristos. and the cultured upper-middle
classes. The homes are built with folding
doors, so that a whole floor of a house might
be turned into a ballroom, where exuberant
couples could tear up and down in the wildest
ot mazurkas—which, by the way, the
Ukraines aver were stolen from them.
But it was not from the Liberals, whose
women were the sparkling creatures, though
generally sallow as to complexion, that the
most prominent woman figure of the last few
years has sprung—Red Yakovlva. She was
a woman of medium height, with a quiet,
unemotional face —she might have been a
country school-mistress in her navy costume
and cotton gloves. Between spells of
writing out death-orders (mostly with-
out reason), she addressed the Working
Women s Congress and told the mem-
bers to lead the good Socialist life and
stiengthen- their husbands in the Bolshevist
cause. There were, later, rumors that she
had Teen shot for “irregularities” in her
murders and for wanton destruction of life.
Now, in a room set apart for them in the
Russian Lmbassy in London, exiles and re-
fugees earn a scanty livelihood working on
Russian embroideries, for which luckily there
is a market in Paris fashion houses.
Back in Sydney for a time, Haigh Jack'
son, whose fine baritone voice used to be a
feature of the Williamson opera cos. Haigh
has travelled far since those days. For five
years he studied and sang in Germany. Dur-
ing an engagement at Covent Garden Melba
heard him and advised him to study with
Jean de Reszke. He hastened to do this,
and paid £4 per half-hour for his lesson;
after every lesson his card, which looked
like an old 14-rides-a-shilling tram ticket,
was snicked by Jean’s private secretary, and
every snick meant another £4 gone, Piaigh’s
last engagement before coming to Sydney
was with the Carl Rosa Co.
The elderly Countess of Harrowby, who
godmothered so many young officers of the
A.I.F. on London leave, is continuing the
good work and giving a glad hand to
Aussie students going to Blighty. •
Mrs. F. M. Sykes, of the laughing eyes,
has come to Australia on a visit to relations.
Mrs. Sykes was one of the popular workers
at the British Army and Navy league Clnb
in Paris from 1917 to 1919, and there she
made a host of Aussie soldier-friends whom
she wants to meet again. Letters to the
Wentworth or care of Tho.s. Cook and Son
will find her.

—
USIC—of all the arts —is the
most personal. Where the other
arts make their appeal to the
mass, music is individual, carrying a
different message to every heart.
Because of this personal aspect is born
the desire to sing or play. Many and
many are the times when to listen to
the finest artist fails to satisfy. The
longing for individual expression is so
great that it dooms many to the dis-
appointment of mediocre performance.
The Beale Player-piano can satisfy your longing for
a physical means of expressing your musical
emotions. It possesses much—much more than
mere mechanical dexterity. It has a control that
enables you to paint every shade of expression you
desire, in a manner instinctive and satisfying. By
its means you can tread the pleasantest gardens of
musical thought unhampered by the fetters of in-
different technique.

F.H.R.: Got any idea of the timber
required to keep a fair-sized mill going? Or the
cost of the mill ? The most hopeful results so
far are from grass and straw Cept: It doesn’t
say anything. .. .Tim: Heads like a bad attack of
indigestion. . ..W.J.L.: “Tiding Over” doesn’t make
a yarn.... J.C.G.: Too hard to keep awake over
them. . .Riverina: You should be able to sell “Sandy
and Mary” somewhere else A.L.M.: A crown of
sonnets can t be much good unless the individual
sonnets are strong enough to stand alone Pad-
dock: Shockingly bad Don Three: “Ships” just
misses.. .A.C.T.: “Springtime” is thin; “Contrasts”
too long for US....C.M.: “Summertime” hasn’t the
magic. .. .O.M.: “Beach Comber” not well enough done.
. ...A.J.S.: Not enough at present in the cat yarn.
B.M. (Oamaru) : No use J.D. (late Katoom-
ba) : There is promise in the verse. Go on Clara
C.: “The Crook” is full of unnecessary woi'ds....
Dub. lOU’s: Poor... .Will C.: “Shantybang” won't
quite do....Cecily U.: It is good of its sort; but
don’t attempt blank verse until you’ve mastered
some other forms... .W.J.L.: Not enough vigor in
the yarn A.G.: Haven’t a place that “Desert
Diary” would fit into... .I.R.M.: “Delusion” won’t
do. That’s a bad rhyme—“mud” and “toad”....
G.L.T.: “Revolution” not for us K.B. (Brisbane):
The lizard horror doesn’t strike us D.L.T.: No use.
... .John L. : Bad... . L.O.S.: Poor verse that says
nothing...The Wowser: “Black Legs” all very lame.
N.O.T.: No good Don Three: “Wet Night”
doesn’t send a thrill through a single whisker
L.K.G.: Not badly done. Will get a second inspec-
tion presently H.W.S.: “Strike” yarn a bit too
mechanical D.A.L.K.: Doesn’t go.... Edmund T.:
Not up to the mark Learner: Neither, thank you.
Stripper: “Macpherson” misses.. .Mummer: The
grammar is as had as the verse M.A.M.: No good.
Cynthia R.: Verse strung on so thin an idea
could only be carried through by music and charm
• —things “I would not change” hasn’t much of
C.L.C.: Not enough there.. .E.M.H. : Prose and verse
both fail. ... H.M.G.: “Little Girl’s Song” doesn’t
get near Sodium Chloride: Clever enough, but
not for publication Flossie F.: You don’t quite
get out the humor of it Peter the Pieman: Rather
heavy fooling W.J.C.: “Lais” and “Going West”
fail in interest... .E.W. (Adelaide): Not enough in
the yarn. .. .Euro: Thanks, but it works old ground.
Mommera: —eight, nine, Out!! Change: It
ought to be possible to guess at the meaning of a
poem in two tries. Afraid it couldn’t be done with
any certainty in your case in less than 20 Glug:
Good; held for Christmas Tambo: Quite so; there’s
so much delay in connection with AVar Service Homes
administration that in scores of cases, taking into
account the rent they’ve had to pay, it would
have been as cheap in the long run for the returned
Diggers to have gone to a reputable building society.
Perhaps cheaper... .A.M.L.: AVell, if it matters, Har-
riet McGregor Leslie was the second and not the
eldest daughter of the old commander of the Harriet
McGregor ; and “Jacky” Evans’s father was never in
command, though Jacky himself was once her second
officer. .. .E.N.T.: There’s something you know better
than anybody else. That’s what we want you to tell
us about. . . .Poss: Imposs W.J.D.: The work in
“Primrose” is quite good. Wish it had been put
into something worth while.... “S.W.P.” : “Profit”
very close up. It is a bit stiff in the joints
Jenks: You’ve chosen the most crowded stall in the
market... .Flicker: Pity they weren’t all like these
two verses:—•
But I will have none of this heavenly dope,
To come back again to this earth is my hope,
To mix up once more in this giddy old whirl
As a pair of silk stockings on some pretty girl.
It’s been always my dream to have fastened on me
The eyes of the nation, and plainly I see
That the glance of each mortal, some • brazen,
some shy,
Turns towards stockings of silk, as their wearer
goes by.
....Cootha: Give us the marrow. The daily papers
apparently want the bones... .S.C.: No; it was the
Maorilander who led the way in bucket-dredging for
gold... .Dutty: Don’t aim at obscurity. It is usu-
ally a sign of swelled head —the writer flatters
himself that the public will be interested enough to
dig out the meaning, whereas 99 times out of a
hundred it simply passes on, bored, to the next
item....The Lamb: Yes; but all you say doesn’t
qualify him for the job he’s accepted from the
Government Ab Intra: Too serious a matter to
deal with on an uncorroborated statement.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
P.E.P.: Don’t care for those swollen heads. Father
is falling like an undermined factory chimney....
A.C.: The road to Hell is paved with faint pencil
sketches. .. .G.C.W.: Petrified figures.... L.P.: The
reclining female form should not look like a jointed
puppet cast on the ground by an angry ventriloquist.
A.S.H.: Very muddy W.J.C.: What a pity
the well-dressed lady can’t manage her feet! Her
husband is almost crippled with artist’s lumbago, too,
poor devil!... .E.H.B.: The boss’s stomach is a mis-
fit.... D.O.N.: No interest in the wooden parson or
the lunatic laborer. . . . J.H.M.: No, you are
not “sending a drawing to be put in The
Bulletin.” Pierrot’s fat legs are unfit for
publication... .A.J.McR.: Two gloomy golfers....
J.A.: Have you opened a factory for that sort
of art ?... .E.P.A.: Looks like something worked
in wool during a gas-strike T.C.: Is the fond
mother bathing a baboon or a baby ?... .F.W.G.: No
gaiety in any of them.
"IJ.l'. ’: The ship that carried Caesar and
his fortunes had a parallel in old Zshachner’s
horse. Zschachner (pronounced mostly
Zakner) lived on Bruny Island (Tas.) and
finally attained the height of his ambition,
being elected a municipal councillor. As he
rode home after they brought the good news
from Bruny he kept a tight rein on his old
grey horse and remarked: “You must not
stumble now, Dapple. You vos carry a coun-
cillor now.”
Onlooker”: I was having a shave and a
conversation in a San Francisco saloon. The
barber was curious about my Digger bad°-e
and I explained. With a ring of pride he
told me that he, too, had been in the army—
“right from the start to the finish, sir—22
months’ service.” At last I had met a fight-
ing Yank. “And how long were you in
France. ; Oh, I didn’t get to France. I
was running the barber shop at the Naval
draining Station.”

for August.
An opportunity is presented to Phonograph Owners this
month of selecting an exceptionally tine range of delight-
ful records—beautiful vocal airs, charming instrumental
selections and entertaining humor.
Special attention is directed to the three Royal Purple
Records. What finer singers could be presented tnan
Anna Case, Mario Laurenti, and Thomas Chalmers?
And their singing! It could not be better. The Records
must be heard to be appreciated.
The Blue Amberols include two charming duet songs from
“The Royal Vagabond,” a musical comedy that met with
great success when staged. It is a long while since a
Bells solo has been presented. “Southern Melodies”
will, therefore, be welcomed. “I’m Forever Blowing
Bubbles” is made available as a Waltz selection. The
Tuxedo Dance Orchestra in playing it have introduced
“Till We Meet Again.” It thus makes the Record
doubly attractive.

It was recommended to me by a
friend some time ago, and I first
used it for my little daughter
Ethel. She was always hurting
herself in some way, and I did not
believe there was anything which
would heal so quickly and keep
the skin in such perfect condition
as would Rexona. Since then we
have used it, both my daughter
and myself, innumerable times,
and I think it is the greatest healer
I have ever come across. 1 can
recommend it as a healer for sores,
and any kind of skin abrasions. It
is also most excellent to put on the
skin after surfing for sunburn. I
have also found it very good for a
rash of any kind.
I also use your Rexona Soap; it
is a delightful soap both for
the toilet and hair. Nothing vye
have ever tried has kept our skin
in such good condition and our
hair as perfect as Rexona Soap. I
am sending you a photograph of
my little daughter Ethel. She is
just five years old, and says she
is a real Rexona girl.
Yours truly.

ARTURY BAYLDON.
The Taking of Sing-song Heeley.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PETER LAGGARD set foot ashore at
Sandridge in the year 1852. He had
boarded the old Mirzapore at Liver-
pool, one hundred and fourteen days since,
full of the wild talk of gold that lay in lumps
in the gutters at Ballarat, gold any man
might have for the gathering. He was an
inconspicuous “peasouper”; no half-yard of
revolver was thrust in his belt in mute de-
fiance of the elements of lawlessness, fears
of which made every newchum chary of
leaving his ship alone. He did not seek to
overawe the powers of disorder with a highly-
polished belltopper of black beaver, and he
carried no amorphous bundle, the unmistak-
able badge of the Englishman in the eyes
of old-established Australians of three
months’ standing, whose masterly swags
proudly advertised their claims to respectful
consideration as old hands.
The month was October, the morning
lovely; spring had decked the way. Petei
Laggard found the country very much to his
taste. The sober green of the grass chimed
sweetly with the deep tones of the river-
side gums. Tucked in an elbow of a little
creek, a small grove of wattle in full bloom
flamed out, tropical sunshine incarnate in
flower. Its scent refreshed his spirit like
wine. Peter took deep breaths, expanding
his lungs. He spread and lifted his arms
in token of acceptance. Australia would do
for him.
Peter was 26 years of age, oft. Din. in
height, slimly and neatly built, but lithe
and confident as became a finished pupil of
Gentleman Jackson. He had started for
Australia alone, and had made no particular
friends by the way, a testimony to the reti-
cence of his character. It was a time when
“shipmate” in Australia designated a close
relationship.
Swanston-street was already named, and
was now a well-defined thoroughfare; but
traffic recognised no municipal regulations.
Horsemen galloped with a superb disregard
for their own necks and a regal indifference
for the security, of casual pedestrians; a long
string of bullocks double-yoked to a dray
sprawled in the deep dust, chewing the cud,
while their driver, astride a leader, exuber-
antly drunk, bellowed a popular song of the
day, with garrulous repetition.
There were men everywhere, and only
men, it would appear. All were full-
bearded and affluent of hair; consequently
Peter’s shaven cheeks and chin, his neat
sideboards and smart stock, excited remark,
and the remark was always amiably deri-
sive. „ ...
That night Peter saw Melbourne shining
murkily in the glare and smoke of exposed
lights, like a glowworm in the mist, noisy,
drunken, combative, merry, brutally new,
shamelessly primitive. With his nose clogged
and his throat choked with its dust, he made
his way back to his ship, having picked up
all the information he could in the drinlang-
bars and dance-halls. Next morning he
started, still a lone hand, in tow of a
party with a dray, making through Black
Forest, heading for Forest Creek.
Laggard was a good deal of an Australian
before that toilsome journey was ended. It
familiarised him with the climate, brought
him into close touch with the men and the
manners, and gave him to see that all men
who had been to the diggings were not re-
turning burdened with gold. This upset
one of the most popular delusions cherished
aboard the Mirzapore. Within three months,
cluttered with experiences of Forest Creek
and half a dozen adjacent rushes, Peter
awoke to a realisation of the fact that,
however munificent Fortune might be to
others, she had no intention of being a gen-
erous mistress to Peter Laggard. He had
worked hard with three different mates, two
of them scoundrels, the other a fool, and had
had a hard and instructive time. Only
once had a bit of gold fallen into his dish,
and then it was just enough to encourage
him to give his luck a further chance. He
played it up at Allan’s store at Forking
Flat. „ ,
The game at Allan s store was a simple
gamble, a primitive spinning-jinny in which
each investor played his own number against
the crowd, the proprietary reserving a num-
ber for the house. Anybody won but Peter,
and Peter, amazed at the continued success
of the house-number and the way the men s
<>old flowed into the heavy black-leather bag
held between the knees of Sam Irons, ex-
prize-fighter. present lag, guardian of the
machine and keeper of the Deace for Allan,
made close investigation, and discovered Sam
in the act of working a little hidden spung
under the edge of the table, which might, or
might not, account for the amazing luck oi
the promoters. „
“Here, stop this game a minute, com-
manded Peter. “It’s an infernal piece ot
thievery!” a
There was an immediate uproar. &am
Irons did not move from his position, but
sat there, the fat bag in his loving embrace
while an unsuspected myrmidon in the crowd
topped Peter off with a bottle. ■
When Laggard awoke he was on the bunk
in his own tent, his head caked to his pil-
low, his brain jumping like a cat in a sack.
Sick and disillusioned he turned his back
on the diggings next day. and faced the m-
solvent’s track. Perhaps Melbourne had some
use for what talents he possessed ; the fields
threatened him with starvation, and he was
disgusted with the noise add squalor ,of the
life the absence of decent companionship
in the welter, the dearth of creature com-
forts and the continuous vicissitudes bear-
able, possibly enjoyable, to fortunate devils
panning off an ounce to the dish, but abomin-
able to a man down on his uppers and faced
with the alternative of taking on a menial
job, begging his next meal, or postponing
dinner indefinitely. „ , ..
Peter carried a swag, correctly rolled it
meagre, and he went into the Black Forest
again as lonely a figure as had issued from
it, but without the stimulation of hope, lie
had come within seven miles of Flemington,
through trial and hunger, and his bed for to-
night was a hollow log lined with dry grass,
one end stopped with brush and bracken.
Not so bad a bedplace, more commodious
than most logs, well scooped out and admir-
ably placed. lie deemed himself fortunate
in 'finding it, and had cut short his dav s
journey to avail himself of its cover, for
black clouds were rolling across the evening-
sky and fitful winds fore-running the storm
tossed the top boughs in expostulation. _
He had withdrawn to his bush dormitory
and lain there quite an hour, thinking miser-
ably enough of his ill-luck, and the storm
had not yet broken. Presently he was made
aware of the tread of a man. He heard the
snapping of twigs, the movement of the
undergrowth, and then distinctly the hum-
ming of “The Jolly Beggars” :
A fig for those by law protected;
Liberty’s a glorious feast.
Courts for cowards were erected,
Churches built to please the priest.
Off in the night a horse whinnied, and
“Silence, you swine!” murmured the voice.
“Would you ruin a man?” Then the same
voice humming:
With the ready trick and fable,
Round we wander all the day,
And at night in barn or stable
Hug our doxies on the hay.
Laggard crept softly to the front door
of his apartment and cautiously peeped
out. Within 10 seconds he retired again
into his shell, precipitately, like a snail that
has touched trouble. What he saw was a
man, a short man stiffly built, sitting on a
'stump screened from the track by a sapling,
the top half of his face hidden behind a
mask, and lying across his knee and in the
bend of his left arm a double-barrelled shot-
gun. All these details were visible to Peter
because that other man had chosen this
moment to scratch a match on the butt of
his gun and light his pipe.
A name flashed into Laggards mind.
Sing-song Heeley! He had' heard it a hun-
dred times since going to Forest Creek.
Sing-song Heeley, the nonchalant bandit
who chanted scraps of ballads while reliev-
ing his victims of their gold and nego-
tiaole possessions. Peter had no difficulty
in foreseeing the next tableau. The coach
from Jackson’s Creek would be through in
half an hour or so. Mr. Heeley meditated
an attack, and one or more of the passen-
gers would fare badly as a result. Heeley
had apparently infallible sources of infor-
mation, and never attacked when it was not
very well worth while. Peter was still
meditating in this vein, when the resonant
crack of a whip came through the forest.
Silence for two minutes, and the crack was
repeated. Then came the pad of horse-hoofs
on the soft soil, and the voice of a man
encouraging his team. After that, sharply
and clearly on the night air:
“Bail up ! Bail up ! Drop the reins! Sit
on your hands, mate, and if you stir off
them I’ll put a bullet through you.”
A bright fire of dry gum-boughs had
sprung up suddenly, illuminating the scene.
“Come down.” ordered Sing-song, “every
man jack of you. and don’t forget what Sam
Heeley does to the fool who thinks he can
shoot.
Wretched is the infant’s lot,
Born within the straw-roofed cot.
Be he generous, wise or brave,
He must only be a slave.
Come, come, damn it all, you know what
I want. Out with it, and look slippy. I
can’t stay here all night dancing attendance
on a pack of gawping idiots.
What is title, what is treasure,
What is reputation’s care?
If we lead a life of pleasure
’Tis no matter how or where.
Hi, you with the hang-dog face, fish that
leather bag out of the hay. Damn it, do
you want a bullet in your gut?”
The desired black-leather bag was pro-
duced with marked alacrity, its owner
agreeing with the popular belief that the
Devil worked in with Sing-song Heeley, for
he had deemed the existence of the bag in
the hay known only to himself. A few
more sharp orders from Heeley, a few
chanted lines, and then:
“All aboard! Lay your whip-lash about
those horses, driver, and don’t look back in
five mile§, or God help you!”
The coach lumbered off. Sing-song s fire
of dry leaves died down, and the gold-
stealer set about collecting his booty. But
almost instantly there came a sharp excla-
mation: “Where in h—1?” And again, as
he went scurrying among the bracken,
“Well, I’m d—d!”
The black leather bag was missing! And
Heeley would not have gone a yard out of
his way to stick up the Jackson’s Creek

Tells a Story”
Those agonising twinges across the small of the back,
that dull, throbbing ache, may be your warning of
serious kidney weakness—serious if neglected, for it
might easily lead to gravel, stone, bladder inflammation,
dropsy, or fatal kidney disease. So if you are suffering
with a bad back, look for other proof of kidney trouble,
and if there are dizzy spells, headaches, nervous despon-
dent attacks; a dull, tired condition and disordered
kidney action, get after the cause. Take things easier for
a while and use DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS,
the remedy that has been tested for you by thousands.
What satisfied users say is the best proof of Doan’s
reliability.
STRAIGHTFORWARD STATEMENTS BY SYDNEY PEOPLE.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Geo. A. Skinner, 37 Goodhope Street, Paddington, says:—“As the result
of a bad cold which settled on my kidneys I suffered agony from backache, and was
often so bad that I had to lie up, not being ablb to move without enduring torture.
The kidney secretions were very much disordered, being thick and cloudy, and I
could not even turn in bed without a stab-like pain striking me across the loins. I
took all kinds of kidney medicines, but nothing gave me any permanent relief, and
I was at a loss to know what to do for a cure. A friend, hearing how I was
suffering, suggested I should try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I bought some
at once, and after taking them for a few days, I was delighted to find they were
doing me good. In a week or so I felt ever so much better, and by the time I had
used five or six bottles I was completely cured. That was two years ago, and I
am still well, but I always keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in the house and
take them now and again, as a tonic for the kidneys.”
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. A. Weir, 168 Botany Road. Alexandria, Sydney, says:—“ln common
with many others, I can give Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills a first-class recom-
mendation as a cure for backache and kidney disorder, these pills having cured me
of a bad attack some few months ago. Before I took these pills I suffered terribly
with my back, it being so stiff and painful that I could hardly get about; in fact,
I have been so bad that I have had to lie up, being almost crippled with the pain!
My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and were sore to the touch, and I was
also subject to dizzy attacks. I could not get proper rest at night, and in conse-
quence always felt dull and tired, and had no energy. However, a course of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills soon put an end to my health troubles, and I have been
grand ever since.”
Six years later Mrs. Weir confirms the above: —“l am still well, and have
had no return of my old complaint since Doan’s Pills cured me over six years ago.”

cc> a ch if it had hot been for that particular
black-leather bag. He stood for a moment
iu. the direction the coach had taken.
i one * ie sa id. “Done like a dinner, by
the holy hook! But how?” How had the
owner succeeded in laying hands on his
treasure ? Heeley was scratching his head
over the problem, when he felt a sharp tug
at his right foot. He turned to investigate,
and felt a second wrench, so violent this
time that it tossed him off his feet, and he
was dragged along the ground by the mys-
terious force. His rough journey ended in
the space of two yards, and he was writh-
ing helpless, one leg drawn with great force
into a hollow log, his body and one out-
thrown leg held hard up against the end of
The troopers! He was trapped! But his
hands were free. He tore a revolver from
his breast and waited. Meanwhile Peter
Baggard, inside the log, was hanging like
grim death to the rope that had bound his
swag and with which he had noosed Heeley.
Peter was slowly working his way out of
the other end of the log. Thank the Lord,
the rope was long enough for his purpose!
Wriggling into the open, he selected a stout
stick, placed it across the opening of the
log, and with two turns and a knot secured
his prisoner.
There was still some little light from the
smouldering fire upon Heeley! Laggard
took up another stick, and held it to his
shoulder, pointing at the highwayman.
“Bail up!” he said. “I’ve got the drop on
you, Heeley. Throw down that revolver,
or I’ll break your arm with a bullet. Down
with it!”
Imagining resistance to be useless, Sing-
song threw aside his Colt’s, and Peter
hastened to secure it. Then, with his waist-
belt, he tied Heeley’s elbows behind him
and bound his captive’s legs.
“Now, Mr. Heeley,” said he, “where is
your horse?”
Heeley nodded in the direction from which
the whinny had come, and Peter sprang
away in quest of the animal. He was back
within a minute, and found Heeley strug-
gling vainly to free himself.
The storm caught Peter when well on his
way to the Bridge Inn at Flemington. Pro-
gress was necessarily slow, as Heeley, his
hands braced behind him, and tethered by
the neck to the saddle, must walk or floun-
der every foot of the way. They arrived
shortly after daylight, and found the coach
m the yard. The driver had hung up at
the hotel for the night, having sent a couple
of men ahead on two of the horses to in-
form the Melbourne police of the sticking-
up.
Peter’s arrival with his prisoner created
a sensation.
“What of the stuff?” demanded the coach-
man.
‘I don’t know anything about that,”
Pe ; ter replied. “I had my hands full with
this gentleman.”
“There’s five hundred on liis head,” said
the driver.
Peter nodded. “Yes,” said he, “and I need
it.”
The driver and another, who returned at
once to the scene of the robbery, recovered
all the stolen property but the black-leather
bag, which, it was alleged, contained TOOoz.
of gold dust.
( Peter Laggard was paid £5OO in good
Government gold for encompassing the cap-
ture of Samuel Heeley, alias Sing song, and
bringing the ruffian to trial. He returned
to Forest Creek, still a lone hand, and one
night, from well up in the hollow of a tree
near where Sing-song Heeley’s horse had
been tethered, he collected a black-leather
bag which contained TOOoz. of fine gold.
Peter had long since recognised it as the bag
Sam Irons had nursed so tenderly at the
spinning-jinny in Allan’s store on Forking
Flat.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Some day he no come up ” —Colombo diver-
boys’ maxim.
r¥l HE diving was good that day. As a
special concession the boys had been
allowed up on deck, where they
perched in quaint attitudes along the
rail like so many black pixies on a
fence. With their scarlet loin-cloths and
flashing teeth and eyes that sparkled
like the eyes of so many mischiev-
ous baby-monkeys, they made a vivid splash
of life against the white deck-houses of the
ship, and their barb feet raced noiselessly
over the cocoanut-matting that covered the
spotless planking of the deck as they skipped
and glided noiselessly in and out amongst
the passengers on their way back from the
water to the rail. Out from the cool shade
of the deck-awning a coin would flash bright
and silvery into the sunlight on its journey
to the blue water below, and out and down
and after it would flash half a dozen bronze
and ebony sea-urchins, flaunting their scar-
let loin-cloths as they split the \yater a frac-
tion of a second behind the coveted silver.
The harbor reeked with sharks. For the
fish-sharks they had no fear. But the com-
ing of a killer sent them scurrying like
tadpoles for the gangway.
Not a boy of them was more than 15, and
the competition was keen. Of them all two
•stood out from the rest as the swiftest and
surest divers, so much so that the coin-
catching soon resolved itself into a combat
between the pair. Friends were these, in-
separable as brothers. Friends who, when
the fun was over, went arm-in-arm down the
street, dividing their coins, skipping and gam-
bolling like gamins. But gradually to-day,
’midst the feverish competition and bursts
of applause, feeling changed from friendship
to enmity, and finally turned to ungovern-
able hatred on the part of the one as the
other beat him every time, by a fraction of
a second.
Probably nothing would have happened
but for the bantering of one of the passen-
gers. “Ah, you Sabino, you too slow like
porpoise. Archie the quick boy.”
The lau|gh that followed was to Sabino,
standing awkwardly on one foot, as the
taunting cackle of devils, and the merry
smile on Archie’s face looking back over his
shoulder as he shot out over the rail in
pursuit of a fresh coin was an added insult,
rubbing salt into the wound.
Directly at Sabino’s back where he stood
on the deck the window of the steward’s
pantry was thrown open. On a ledge just
inside the opening there rested a knife, a
sheath-knife, short and strong and pointed.
One quick glance at the passengers crowded
against the rail watching Archie curving
into the water told Sabino he was for the
moment unnoticed. The next instant his
hand had shot in and out of the window, and
the cold steel of the knife rested against
his skin beneath the lava-lava.
Jostling Archie so as to give the next
coin a longer start, which meant a deeper
dive, they went over the rail together, and
together they struck, the water and disap-
peared. From, and because of, their height
above, the watchers on deck saw them go
down and down, following the shining coin
like hounds on the scent, until they
disappeared from view. Ninety seconds
later the head of Sabino broke water, peer-
ing about in well-simulated surprise for his
comrade. But Archie did not rise. A
vicious under and upward thrust of Sabino’s
knife had taken his gay young life far down
below the surface of the waters where only
the fishes could see, and Sabino knew that
henceforth he alone would lead the gang in
the rush over the side into the water.
In the free, blue waters of the harbor
Sabino was a god ; a sea-god. In the vile
atmosphere of his home, a germ-ridden hovel
in one of the festering byways of the Colombo
water-front, he was a fear-haunted urchin,
creeping into bed at night after handing
over the coins he had gathered at the diving
to a quinine-eating, phantom-haunted sot of
a man whom he regarded as his father. It
was to save his skin Sabino handed over
the coins ; not from love of the man. The
only love Sabino had ever known was the
love of Archie —Archie who was his friend ;
Archie who was his counsellor; Archie who
was a big slice of his life; Archie whom he
had slain.
As he tossed sleeple&sly on the dirty bags
thrown down in a corner of the room that
night, he could see again the look of terri-
fied surprise on Archie’s face as the vicious
knife bit deep into his vitals down there near
the floor of the sea. When the understand-
ing forced itself into his numbing brain that
it was not an accident, and that Sabino
meant it, Archie had smiled tne old playtime
smile as he dropped suddenly like a released
stone down to the bottom of the sea. That
smile had followed Sabino through the rip-
pling corrugations of the water all the way
up to the surface. It was the reproach and
forgiveness of that smile that had sent him
out of the water and away while yet the
coin-catching was good, and it was that same
smile that now drew him from his bed and
sent him sneaking out of the crazy house and
down the dark streets and alleyways to the
sleeping liner, where a sailor of the watch
found him an hour later crouching in the
•scuppers under the rail where he and Archie
had gone over, whimpering and whining like
a deserted puppy. Lacking the heart to
drive him away, the sailor threw him a
deck-rug and let him be.
The diving the following day was exciting.
With the boat due to sail that night there
were coins a-plenty, and the boys swarmed
about the ship’s rail, chattering and laugh-
ing and squabbling like chipmunks over a
patch of ground-nuts. The diving so-called
was not diving really. With the flip of the
coin, out from the rail the boys would jump,
feet first, the problem being to take the
water in that position. Jumping from a
height it is difficult to keep the top-heavy
human body erect; it wants to heel over and
land head down, or chest down. But the
boys had mastered it. Turning their toes
downward like a pirouetting ballet-dancer,
they would split the water like an arrow hard
on the heels of the coveted coin, following in
its phosphorescent wake until their hands
closed upon it, or the pressure on the lungs
told them to relinquish the chase and get
back into the air.
Sabino did not dive. Seated on the rail,
with an arm twined round a stanchion, he
.sat apart from the other boys, staring down
with eyes that saw nothing at the spot where
he and Archie had entered the watdr for the
last time the previous afternoon. Once one
of the boys, in a spirit of mischief, crept up
behind and pushed him off the rail.
Straightening up in time to take the water
right, he swam to the gangway and climbed
back to his seat on the rail, paying no heed
to the twittings of his fellows. Even the
bantering of the passenger whose sarcasms
of the previous day had set the imps of
deviltry a-work in his brain failed to move
him to-day.
Without any warning, the boys in the
water suddenly commenced a mighty splash-
ing as they scrambled and fought with one
another in a mad rush for the gangway.
With the trained eyes of the watermen, they
had detected the presence of killer sharks
before the whites, with the advantage of
height above the water in their favor, were
cognisant of anything unusual. In another
30 seconds the sea-carrion, half a dozen big,
murderous-looking brutes, were splitting the
water at the feet of the gangway, fighting
over something one o/f them carried, in its
jaws. “My God, it’s that boy that was lost
yesterday!” said the man whose words had
driven Sabino to his murderous deed. “Pic-
ture yourself falling in amongst ’em !” said
another, repressing an involuntary shudder.
Barely had his tongue given life to the words
when something black and scarlet shot out
from the ship’s side, dropping squarely on
top of the writhing monsters below.
It was all over quicker than the eye could
convey the horror it saw to the brain. A
bull rush and a swirl and flirt of tails, and
half a dozen ugly grey man-killers were again
swimming leisurely about the ship’s gang-
way, a dark stain on the surface of the
water the only sign of Sabino’s passing.
“He no come up again.” The boy voiced
the general verdict as the bronze-hued chip-
munks, sobered for once, trailed off the liner
on to the wharf.
