Dr. M. PERRY,

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Eiabetes, Tumors, &c.
JUgistered by the Medical Bo tv lof N.S. W. Lite House Sur-
geon t > the Great Northern Hospital. L'mfa %
I am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself a-; a
Specialist for the t’ eatnvnt of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph, Nov.
6th 7th and 6th. 1800) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified Men entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from* disease 5, who are scattered over nil parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity .
V.y Qualiflcations I invite the fullest investigation into. For some cor.siderabl# time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of ot.serving the many phases of the Nervous and
texua' System, and to be ome acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he is informed at the
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
if I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

SATURDAY, JUNE 6, 1891.
The Increase of Population.
It is an accepted axiom of modern philosophy
that the world is, rapidly filling up, and by-
and-bye it will grow to be too full. Pro-
found, hard-thinking, fieshless men of know-
ledge are even beginning to calculate the
exact year, or the exact decade, when the
human race will commence to be hungry
because the earth will no longer grow enough
provender to feed its inhabitants, and at the
present rate of increase it is calculated, with
tolerable confidence, that less than two
centuries will find man in an exceedingly
tight place. In almost every country where
census returns are available the population
is rapidly increasing, and as the increase of
food is limited, while that of humanity seems
to be practically limitable only by the earth’s
capacity for sustaining life, it would appear
as if something of a disastrous character
must ensue sooner or later. The problem
is an altogether new one—so far as history
can show—even upon this old, old, un-
speakably ancient earth, for hitherto the
increase of the human race seems to
have been kept down by local famines, or
plague, or want of sanitation, or by the use
of judicious violence. Now and then, in
ancient times, a c'vilised race, such as that
of Egypt, has commenced to multiply in
some corner of the earth in a way that
threatened to tax the resources of the soil,
but somewhere, out of space and geo-
graphical darkness, there always issued
a bloodthirsty rival nation, which settled the
problem by wholesale massacre, just when
it threatened to become interesting. The
world never had a chance to decide what
course it would adopt when it became too
much crowded to feed its inhabitants, for
some obtrusive Hun or Scythian inevitably
interfered ; or else some new distemper, for
which science could find no remedy, post-
poned the question for another ten centuries;
or, failing that, the nations rose and banged
each other about for thirty years on some
obscure point of doctrine. But sooner or
later the problem must come up for settle-
ment. The Huns and Scythians float loans
in Europe now, and desolate the country
with debentures instead of with fire and
sword. The plague and the Black Death
seem to be approaching extinction as sanitary
science advances ; and very few nations care
enough for their creeds and gospels to con-
duct religious wars with anything like their
old vigour. And, in any case, war is not
what it used to be, for the mediaeval
European who clubbed and speared his
enemy at close quarters produced far better
returns in the way of corpses than his
descendant with the breechloader and the
torpedo, and even the dynamite gun doesn’t
thin out the inhabitants half so effectually as
a good many older weapons seem to have
done. Moreover, war has grown so expen-
sive that each corpse often costs as much as
£lOO, whereas in the old days of cheap homi-
cide the clothes of the deceased more than
paid for killing him. Amid all these novel
conditions, therefore, it is reasonable to
suppose that population is increasing faster
than it ever did before, and the fact that the
world has never yet been over-populated is
no proof that it will not be over-populated
in the early future.
* # «
It is an ominous foreshadowing of this
future trouble that most of the great nations
of the world are already beginning to find a
difficulty in disposing of their “ surplus
population.” In other words, the old, time-
honoured expedient of emigration is begin-
ning to be played out. It was a beautiful
and simple device while it lasted, and it has
done good service for several centuries.
Many a great national disaster has been
averted in times gone past by the handy
expedient of finding a new country, and
extirpating the inhabitants, and then using
the empty land as a receptacle for the over-
flow of Europe or Asia, but unluckily the
supply of new countries is limited, and only a
certain class of inhabitants are suited for
extirpation. It has been estimated that as
many as sixty million human beings Avere
wiped out by various devices in America to
make more elbow-room for the European,
and but for that holocaust both America and
Europe might by this time have been in dire
straits through the superabundance of their
population. Such an experiment, hoAvever,
cannot Avell be repeated, and nearly all the
nations which Avere weak and humble enough
to allow themselves to be exterminated in
order to make room for the armed Christian
have already been demolished, so that this
resource is practically at an end. Those
races Avhich still possess a considerable
expanse of empty territory are iioav begin-
ning to understand that its very emptiness is
a thing to be prized, and instead of welcom-
ing the cast-off population of every country
on earth they are anxious to preserve their
superfluous land to accommodate their own
natural increase. Failing this, they may
groAv a nation and have no place to put
it, for it is becoming more and more
evident that land is scarce and the
human race is exceedingly plentiful. The
Avorld is as large as it ever Avas, yet it is
difficult to find standing-room for the half-
million IlebreAvs avlio are now making their
exit from Russia, and though it is an acknow-
ledged fact that a Hebrew must stand some-
where, yet it is more than doubtful if a
civilised country can afford to take in
500,000 emigrants in the present state of
society. In fact, leaving out those regions
Avhich are—from various causes—uninhabit-
able, there is very little available soil remain-
ing upon this globe, and Avhat remains is
being occupied with portentous rapidity.
The Australian nation is absolutely the last
great nation which can be constructed any-
where, for the Australian people hold almost
the last patch of virgin land on earth, and
Avhen this continent is filled there Avill be
little left.
# # #
And the census which has just been taken
shows that Australia is filling at least as
rapidly as could be expected, yet strangely
enough the nation seems to be pleased that
the catastrophe is coming steadily nearer.
The Old World is already suffering untold
miseries through the abundance of popula-
tion, Avith its concomitants of misery, squalor
and hunger ; and the inhabitants of this
country, with an unspeakable fatuousness,
are glad that these same evidences of civilisa-
tion are rapidly approaching in their own
land. The rival provinces of Victoria and
New South Wales have been running a race
for many years past to secure the first place
on the census-lists, and there is a unanimous
av hoop of rejoicing because New South Wales
is about 12,000 inhabitants ahead—in other
Avords, because it is 12,000 stages the nearer
to Gehenna. There is no reason ascribed for
this outburst of popular exultation ; it is
merely a matter of universal habit. The
people of England rejoice in like manner over
the increase in theircensusreturns, though the
great question of the day in England is how
or where to shunt some three million super-
fluous paupers ; the paupers remain un-
shunted because there is no place to
put them, and the country rejoices be-
cause it is growing more paupers, though
OAvning no spot to dump them down on.
The inhabitants c3f the United States are
mortified beyond measure because they only
number sixty-two millions, instead of sixty-
five as anticipated ; they have counted
niggers, Indians, and imported Sicilian mur-
derers, and regret that, even with all these
undesirable elements, the total is no larger.
Nobody imagines even for a moment that
the increase of numbers brings Avith it an in-
crease of material comfort, or that ten
million men are necessarily happier or more
intelligent or more civilised than tAvo million.
Almost everybody recognises that the over-
crowding of humanity contributes nothing
but disease, pauperism, low wages, misery,
and national degeneracy—that it tends in-
cessantly to the division of mankind into
capitalists and slaves—and that the constant
demand of all men is for some new and com-
paratively empty land where escape
from the evils which accompany their own
ceaseless multiplication. And yet the people
who own such a land rejoice because the last
chance or hope which the earth will ever see
is slipping out of their hands ; and the
people who are already oppressed by the
Aveight of numbers in older countries rejoice
because their oppression is still increasing ;
and they are both glad, because they suffer
from a vague idea that there is some un-
specified blessing in mere multitude, though
what that blessing may be no philosophy will
ever determine.
<5 # *
The only individual who profits by the in-
crease of population is the capitalist; to the
wage-earner that increase, under present
conditions, is an unmitigated curse. As the
census-returns expand rents go up, because
though land is a fixed quality humanity is
practically illimitable ; and wages go down
with the increasing intensity of competition.
The national wealth, it is true, is greater in
thickly-peopled countries than in lands where
inhabitants are scarce, and with the multipli-
cation of mankind this wealth will keep on
multiplying, but the great mass of the
nations are only so much the poorer for this
affluence. The aggregate wealth of England
is some ten thousand millions, but the bulk
of this is mademp of the alleged value of the
English soil, and the soil has an artificial
value because the Englishman must stand
somewhere, and to do that he must pay the
land-monopolist whatever price he demands
for the use of a patch of his own country. If
it were possible to monopolise the whole
water-supply of the country in the same way,
water might suddenly rise to such a market-
value that England would be ■worth twenty-
thousand millions instead of ten, but the
nation would be no richer for this
sudden accession of wealth. The one
possible excuse for the strange hunger after
population with which the civilised world is
afflicted is that increase of population means
a rapid increase of national wealth, but this
sort of wealth is poverty—not affluence.
Scarcity of land is not riches any more than
is scarcity of food. The fact that a foot of
land in Melbourne may be worth £3OO
through the steady growth of population is
of no more benefit to the nation at large
than if a loaf of bread were worth the same
amount. The country is proud of such an
evidence of prosperity, but a rat or an old,
tough hen has often fetched more per foot
frontage in the markets of a beleaguered city
than w r as ever realised for the best land in
Melbourne or Sydney, and in each case the
cause was the same—famine. In the latter
days of the famous siege of Leyden, one
dead horse would have commanded such a
price that it alone would have made a
reasonable measure of national wealth. The
increase of population certainly means
prosperity—the sort of prosperity which is
synonymous with hunger ; but apart from
this it has no special value whatever.
* * #
Yet the howl for population is loud and
vociferous throughout all this crowded
world. Such a paragraph as the following—
from the South Australian papers—is a fair
sample of how far this mania can be carried :
General Downes was interviewed to-day respecting the
work of the Military Defence Commission. He said Port
Darwin was a big place to fortify ; it had very great
possibilities, but must have Asiatic labour to make it
what it ought to be. It seemed manifest to him that
little could he done with this very fine country without
Asiatic labour. European labour was decreasing, and
most of the business was done by Chinese.
There is a fine vein of humorous idiocy about
that paragraph. It is frankly assumed that
the first essential in every country is that
population should be increasing, and as—in
tins instance—it is falling off, it is proposed
that the country should be filled up, as a last
resource, with niggers and Chinamen. A
hundred or two hundred years hence an
empty province such as the Northern Terri-
tory may be a greater blessing to the Aus-
tralian people than the sight of a new
Paradise. By that time, if the present rate
of increase is maintained, Europe, America
and Asia may all be crowded to the last
extremity, and Australia may be the only
land remaining in all this earth where there
is breathing-room left for a new nation.
The fact that the Territory is empty is no
present injury to the unborn Australian who
doesn’t inhabit it; and if it were filled up
with Asiatics the grievance would not be
abated in any way, for the Australian who
isn’t there now would still be absent. And
even if the Territory should remain neglected
for 20,000 years, there is still no reason Avhy
it should not be reserved for the Australian
nation which may overflow into it at the
end of that period. The craving to get rid
of the last available patch of vacant soil
is as hopelessly insane as the craving
to throw overboard the last remaining scraps
of food from a raft in mid-ocean ; and the
desire to increase the population of the earth
under all circumstances is more mad than
the desire to increase the population of a
blockaded city. Yet the desire for more and
still more inhabitants is so deep-rooted that
no one appears to notice the amazing dis-
crepancy. There is no more reason or
advantage in crowding up the earth than in
crowding up Gehenna, but somehow, from
sheer force of habit, it is held to be a matter
for public congratulation that the earth is
getting to be crowded.
# # *
The world cannot by any process at present
available, avert the increase of population,
but none the less its tendency to whoop and
let off rockets because of the spread of that
incurable complaint called Man is a sight to
make angels weep. ‘ As the w r aste places fill
up, the picturesque forests are cut down to
make room for gasometers and bone-boiling
establishments and civilisation ; and the
hills are blasted away to provide building
materials ; and the rivers are pumped dry to
supply irrigation works ; and by and bye
this globe promises to be one great, wide,
sad monotony of men and cities and cows,
with very little else. All this is done
that the world may grow two human beings
where only one grew before, and yet, in most
cases, it would have been better for that
other human being had he never been born
at all. Life, as a rule, has not much to offer
him. Sometimes he is a pauper, hanging
out in a city slum. Sometimes he is an
“ unemployedoccasionally he is hanged;
almost always he toils his whole life through
for a wretched pittance, amid an arid waste
of bricks and mortar and poverty and all
manner of wretchedness. And with every
million that is added to the census returns
the pittance grows more precarious, and the
waste of bricks and mortar more arid, and
the prospect of being hanged more promising,
Whether he goes to Gehenna or not at the
close of his career is a question which no
system of theology seems able to settle, so it
may be included in the reckoning or left
out, according to fancy. But even without
it, the increase of population seems a very
inferior subject for any nation to rejoice
about,
PLAIN ENGLISH.
If the Thing's had been that Weren’t.
One of the gaudy dodges for which the Austra-
lian Tory is celebrated is just now being put
into practice in South Australia. A few weeks
ago two new members were elected for the
Upper House in that province, and to the un-
speakable horror of the fossilised Chamber the
successful candidates were both returned in the
Labour interest. This was without exception
the roughest thing that had ever happened since
the Upper House first started. The spectacle
of two pronounced democrats in that stronghold
of old, coarse, Tory bigotry was worse than
that of two large hogs in a synagogue, or two
hangmen at a Primrose League banquet; and
even two dead Chinamen in Government House
would have been a good deal less objectionable.
The thing was done, however, and unless some
brilliant piece of hard swindling can be devised
it is irreparable, but all the combined Toryism
of South Australia took a great oath that such
a thing would never, never, never, by any
chance or possibility, happen again. And if
hard, unscrupulous faking of the electoral rolls
will serve the purpose it never will happen.
The Upper House at Adelaide is an elective
body, and everybody who pays £25 a year in
rent is entitled to a vote. But many thousand
electors pay rent at the rate of 10s. a week or
£26 a year, and these are being struck off the
rolls en viasse on the ground that, in most cases,
the landlord pays taxes, and if, instead, the
tenant paid the taxes and deducted them
from the rent, he would then, most
probably, pay less than £25. This unclean
fraud was got up by the Government, which
has issued printed directions to the returning-
officers on the subject. As it happens, the
Act gives no special directions on the subject,
which makes this great political swindle all the
more glaring. It is merely stipulated that the
voter must pay £25 a year dear, but there is
absolutely no connection between rent and
taxes that any sane mind can discover. Of course
no one can deny that if a tenant paid his land-
lord’s rates, and deducted them from his
present rent of £26 a year, he might then pay
less than £25, but the brief and comprehensive
answer of the Labour party is that he does
nothing of the kiijd, and what he might do if he
did something else has no bearing on the case.
He might'pay his landlord’s meat-bill, for that
matter, and deduct it from the rent, and then,
if the landlord were a heavy feeder, he might
not have a qualification, even though his rent
were really £5O per annum. He might pay for
his landlord’s funeral, too, or he might have
three legs and a head made out of lard, or he
might never have been born at all, in which
case he wouldn’t have had a vote under any
circumstances. When a Government goes in
for knocking its opponents off the roll because
they would have been disqualified if something
had occurred that didn’t take place, it opens
up a very large question, for the things that
haven’t happened are almost as numerous as
the people who weren’t born. There is a deep
and boundless ingenuity about a system of this
kind, but it only applies to one of the two great
parties that make up the State. Who is there,
for instance, who could paint the frozen glare
that would shine in the eye of Property if any
working-man applied to have a dozen big syndi-
cates struck off the roll on the ground that,
under certain possible circumstances which
might have happened but didn’t, they also
might not have had a qualification, but might
have been in gaol for vagrancy instead ?

Trades Hall and Government House.
A eew weeks ago, when certain of the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall people questioned — not on
social, but financial grounds, alas ! —the ad-
visability of spending the thick end of £IOU on
champagne and grovel for Lord Hopetoun, a
very superficial democrat objected that nobody
from the Hall received invitations to Govern-
ment Bouse. It was an ignominious complaint
to make, because- the omission to bestow
“cards” upon labour representatives might
well have been accepted as a compliment to
their democracy—a dumb confession that there
is no place in a vice-regal function for any man
whose business it is to consolidate the forces
which sassiety— viz. the worshippers of caste —
would fain scatter. Few, probably, among the
bitterest opponents of the Trades Hall imagined
that its leaders coveted the entree to Govern-
ment House, or indulged in day-dreams of rub-
bing shoulders with such as hold aides-de-camp
sacred. The notion was too absurd. Every-
body is supposed to know by this time that his
Excellency is not so much an institution foi'
rewarding personal merit with a hand-shake;
as merely the “ Home ’’-appointed head of a
local snobocracy. To treat as a privilege that
which a fourth-rate globe-trotter regards as a
right is to display a singular ignorance of hoW
the world wags, an ignorance unpardonable to
the controlleis of a powerful organisation.
Tie Trades Hall should engage a needy
“Johnnie” in the capacity of social adviseb


and get him to report upon Government House,
and the qualifications for admission to its outer
circle. An older and “ wider ” gentleman than
Hobetoun would perhaps have paid no heed
to the growl of the toiler who wanted to see,
at least, one of his chiefs figuring in the list of
guests at a vice-regal shivoo. He might not
have cared to risk a refusal of his cheap invita-
tion under galling conditions. Hobetoun, how-
ever, jumped to the conclusion that Labour was
smarting under a sense of neglect, and itching
to send a delegate in dress-clothes to stand
around in the marble halls dedicated to the
Queen’s representative. So Secretary Wal-
lington was told to try the effect of a ticket
upon Mr. J. T. Sitch, President of the Trades
Hall Council, and that guileless magnate was
‘ ‘ nobbled ” as easily as the first favourite in a
selling-race. In fact, Hobetoun may be said
to have nobbled the whole Council. At their
next meeting Sitch arose, with emotion in his
aspect, and informed his colleagues that he had
been invited to a party at Government House,
which he would make a point of attending.
Whereat all present expressed their satisfaction
by cheers. They positively gloated over the
thought that one out of some eight hundred
invitations had been sent to a working-man.
It would be vastly interesting to The Bulletin
to learn whether the Trades-Unionists, as a
body, feel complimented .by Lord Hobetoun’s
patronage on this occasion. It is not necessary
to maintain that an invitation to plain Sitch,
as a private person, wouldn’t mean much, be-
cause hundreds of sitch (overlook it) invitations
are slung off at a time, and a “Government
House young man,” who has neither brains,
“position,” nor even cash, but merely a Scotch
letter of introduction to recommend him, may
be found in any genteel boarding-house. The
question of how much value may be attached to
a ticket for Sitch, the President, is worth con-
sidering. In the first place, it only came as an
answer to the protest of a misguided individual
who didn’t know what he was talking about.
In the next place, if it were intended as a recog-
nition of the dignity of manual labour, it evi-
dently estimates that dignity at J per cent,
as against 99J per cent, of dignity represented
by the uppah, or non-labouring, class. Mr.
Sitch could do no good to his cause by playing
the part of a needle in a bundle of hay. A
Governor is an apology for Victoria Regina,
and his house is an apology for her Court. The
atmosphere of the one place may be less ener-
vating and demoralising than that of the other,
but it smells considerably of Court, neverthe-
less. And should Sitch go there often he will
become tainted with the prevailing odour, and
his Trades Hall constituents will find that the
only way of fitting a square peg to a round hole
is by trimming the peg.
•
“ Truckling - to Labour.”
The British press has solemnly resolved at last
that the failure of the recent Victorian and
South Australian loans arises from one well-
defined cause—the “Truckling to Labour ” by
the various Australian Governments, which has
awakened alarm as to the safety of Property,
and that dull, apopletic, fat-headed class which
is known as “all right-thinking persons,” has
consequently held aloof. Also, the thick, bald,
stertorous-breathing individual, commonly de-
scribed as a “man with a well-balanced mind,”
has recognised the danger of the situation, and
the parochial being, who is defined as ‘‘ an in-
telligent and respected citizen,” has done the
same thing. It was a London Tory newspaper
which first noticed this alarming tendency to
“ truckle to Labour,” but since it made the dis-
covery all the Tory press of Great Britain has
awakened to a knowledge of the approaching peril,
and they have unanimously agreed that the Aus-
tralian Governments are truckling to Labour in
a most alarming manner. Also they recommend
the statesmen of Australia to abandon this
nefarious practice at once. Curiously enough
every one of these Tory snufiiers seems to take
it for granted that Labour and the Government
are two entirely distinct affairs, and not one of
them seems to realise that as the labouring-
classes form the majority of the nation, and the
nation is supposed to be governed by the
majority, therefore the Labour party, according
to the British constitution, ought to be the
Government. Even in England, if the working
classes were united, they could swamp the
House of Lords, the Established Church, the
Tory party, and the famous British Crown in
one act, but, strangely enough, the modern Tory
has never found out this fact. And when he
has failed to see the change that is going on
right under his own port-wine-flushed nose, it
is not surprising that he can’t understand how
things are situated in Australia. When the
Queensland strike broke out it was evidently
expected that the hereditary Australian nobility
would have called out its men-at-arms and
retainers, and fortified the old feudal castles
and loaded up the culverin, or the demi-
john, or something of that sort, and cast
the strikers into the lowest dungeon beneath
the castle-moat. It was anticipated, probably,
that the Trades Hall Council would have been
sent in chains to Thursday Island, and the
Finance Committee tracked by bloodhounds,
and that the sporting community would have
gone out shooting miscellaneous democrats, and
bagged a good many disaffected citizens of all
sorts and descriptions. The Tory has never
yet quite realised that this sort of government
is out of date even in England. He loves to
cavort round in some semblance of the old
feudal style, and to go forth—in his mind’s
eye—and gallop over the “ lower orders and
his famous organ, the Saturday Review,
suggested recently that perhaps, after all, per-
sonal slavery was a necessary condition of
civilisation ; and little more than 30 years ago—
at Die close of the Mutiny—an eminent Tory
official in India suggested that the system of
judicial torture should be revived in order to
extract “ confessions ” from the Sepoy
prisoners, and the suggestion was formally
considered, and only rejected “as a matter of
policy.” A party of this sort naturally feels
hurt when it sees any Government truckling to
Labour. The Government, it is true, granted
not one solitary concession to Labour, but it
manifested an ill-advised hesitation, whereas it
ought to have had the standing army tearing
through the streets, and banging the brains out
of everybody who was found out of doors. And
when it failed to do this, all right-thinking-
persons objected to lend any more money, for
there is a fixed impression in the British intelli-
gence that a Government which isn’t covered
with blood, and which doesn’t look like a
butcher dancing in a slaughter-house, can’t be
trusted with cash any longer. If Australia
wants to borrow money it must stop ‘ ‘ truckling
to Labour ” for the future, and keep right on
truckling to Property instead, that being
the only thing any respectable State ever
truckles to.
«.
A “Freetrade Tariff.”
When the Parkes Government put up Mr.
M‘Millan, a few days ago, to maunder about
the coming Australian Federation and various
other matters, it revealed a vast expanse of hog-
like ignorance with which it had not generally
been credited. Most of the public utterances
of the Parkes Government have been somewhat
obscure of late, owing to bricks and dead
animals, but still it always managed to say
enough to make a fool of itself in a large and
liberal sense. The Parkes crowd, as The
Bulletin foretold weeks ago, are running on
the combined issues of Foreign-trade and Federa-
tion, but they are doing it even more clumsily
than was expected. The single obvious fact
about Federation is that it must bring all-round
Protection in its train, for when one alleged
Freetrade province federates with five Protec-
tionist provinces, the result is as much a fore-
gone conclusion as the fate of one dog that is
stepped on by five elephants. Moreover, when
one-half the dog is in favour of the stepping-on
process the last possibility of doubt is removed,
and the Foreign-trade creed is gone beyond all
recovery. So far, Parkes has judiciously
dodged all reference to this dilemma, but
M‘Millan, who rushes in where angels and
other animals would gladly avoid going, pro-
fesses to take an entirely different view of the
situation. He claims, in the first place, that
the other provinces will quite probably abandon
their Protectionist policy and accept Freetrade
—that the party which is fast going to inevit-
able smash in New South Wales will run the
entire show—and, in fact, that half a province
is a majority, and five provinces and a-half are
a minority. A man who can believe a thing
like that can believe anything, and in that
great day when the hog takes unto itself
wings he will assuredly have his reward.
And, in addition to this, he asserts that ‘‘ a
Freetrade tariff” is the one bestsuited for United
Australia, from which it is evident that the
small, unconsidered M‘Millan is a hundred
and twenty times more foolish than anybody
ever supposed. For the very essence of Free-
trade is that trade shall be free and that there
shall be no tariff at all, and a Freetrade tariff is
as hopelessly anomalous as a white nigger, or a
live corpse that stands up horizontally on its
back and speaks in a speechless utterance with
its feet. Consequently, if there is Freetrade, the
Federal Government will have nothing to live
upon, for it is already agreed that the Federal
administration is to be kept up out of the
Customs, revenue, and on a Freetrade basis
there won’t be any Customs. In the face of
such statements as these it is not surprising
that the members of the Parkes Government
have been greeted of late by their constituents
with flour-bags and so on; and as for the
assertion made by one Foreign-trade paper
that the missiles were heaved by Protectionists,
and by another that they were shied by
Socialists, one of these declarations must be
hard lying, and probably both were equally
mendacious. In its present state of disorgani-
sation, in fact, it would hardly be surprising if
the Parkes Cabinet was out throwing road-
metal at itself, and committing assault and
battery on itself in public places. A Freetrade
aggregation which is helping to organise a 'Pro-
tectionist League with a view to abolishing
Customs duties is so badly mixed that it is
capable of any enormity under the sun, and
when it deliberately holds up its awful mess to
view on the end of a pitchfork and invites the
public to look on it with admiration, the worst
results may be expected. Any ordinary sample
of mud would get up and throw itself under
such conditions. No wonder Parkes asks
people to look only at Federation, and not at
the consequences of Federation. '
An Expression of Democracy.
As Sir George Grey observed, no more solemn
and wonderful sight ever met the eye of man
than that of the vast assemblage drawn together
in the immense Sydney Centennial Hall on May
26 to hear his lecture on “ The Vitals of Demo-
cracy.” It was no ordinary crowd that
assembled, but a seething ocean of humanity
which surged up against the bulwarks of the
platform, foamed up into the galleries, and un-
availingly dashed itself against the choked
entrances. Everywhere billows of human
beings, crowned with a white surf of faces, ever
turned towards the platform—billows whose
regularity of line was broken by the hun-
dreds who filled the aisles and stood
against the walls. In the central aisle
there were probably a thousand afoot, so
densely packed as to be deprived of proper
foothold, swaying all the while from side to
side, like corn that is stirred by light airs.
Outside in the corridors over a thousand men
struggled vainly for ingress, and the rush of
their hurried feet, their hoarse clamour sounded
within like the dashing of waves into an ocean
cave. To no man who ever set foot in Austra-
lasia, to few men throughout the world, has
such an obviously genuine ovation been accorded
as that which fell to the lot of Sir George
Grey, the other evening. When he entered
the hall the cheers were deafening, but when he
stood up to speak the people seemed transported
with enthusiasm : the rumbling of all the
artillery of heaven, the hoarse roar of
an angry sea on a rockbound coast,
the sound of a hundred organs with all the
stops out, would not have the volume and
resonance of that mighty outburst that went
up from at least six thousand throats. As a
lecture—the reference is not to its matter —The
Bulletin does not scruple to say that the
affair was a failure, for the veteran’s feeble
pipe vainly struggled to fill the vast building,
But there were no interruptions, and although
one-third of the audience could not hear the
address, few left their places during the two
hours occupied in its delivery. The people of
Sydney had assembled not so much to hear a
speech as to pay tribute to an illustrious leader
of the commons, and the result was one of the
most magnificent expressions of belief in demo-
cratic institutions that the world has ever
witnessed within walls. Were Grey— the
people’s tribune—thirty years younger, there
is no radical reform that he could not success-
fully captain. He would lead the people of
Australasia to better things, as Moses did the
Israelites through the desert to the Promised
Land. But his rate of progression would be
swifter than that of the Hebrew law-giver.
Another Clean Bowl-out.
Dear Bulletin, —Recently a trumped-up sensa-
tion about a unionist shearer poisoning a soldier
at Barcaldine, Q., fizzled ingloriously out;
although, by the way, the newspapers which
displayed the alleged poisoning in large head-
ings forgot to mention the Queensland Govern-
ment chemist’s disproving analysis of the
“ poisoned ” man’s vomit. That horror having
bubble-bursted, another has been manufactured
—I use the word advisedly—still more sensa-
tional. I quote the following telegram from
the Sydney Daily Telegraph :
POISONING STATION WATER-TANKS.
Brisbane, Thursday.— A number of unionists have
lately been seen on the Mitchell Downs country, and as
certain actions of theirs in connection with one of the
tanks from which the supply of drinking water was drawn
by the boundary riders excited suspicion it was decided
to submit a sample of the water to an analytic examina-
tion. Sergeant Bcrke filled a bottle from the tank and
immediately sealed it. This was forwarded to the Colonial
Secretary’s office and submitted for analysis to Mr. Mar,
Government analyst. His report, which has been for-
warded to the Colonial Secretary, states that he found
the water to contain a solution of as much strychnine as
the water was capable of dissolving, or more than one
grain per pint. He further reports that undissolved
strychnine was found as sediment in the bottle which
contained the water.
The Sydney Morning Herald also published a
similar statement, without deliberately connect-
ing unionists with the poisoning. The ‘ ‘ in-
ventor,” whoever he may be, of this strychnine
scare has overdone his part. He evidently
didn’t know the characteristics of strychnine in
relation to its solubility. Now, strychnine is
soluble in distilled water only 1 in 5760, or 1§
grains per imperial pint; in this tank, we are
told, the water was ‘ ‘ capable of dissolving more
than one grain per pint”—which shows that
the water was fairly pure. But Government
Analyst Mar “further reports that undissolved
strychnine was found as sediment in the bottle
which contained the water." This gives the
whole thing away. Who imposed upon the
police-sergeant by putting that “ undissolved
strychnine ” into the bottle I If the tank-water
had dissolved all the strychnine which it could
take up, the alkaloid in solution would not be
precipitated as sediment —and pure strychnine
at that! —by mere transfer to a bottle. Any
chemist will tell you that. It is clear that
strychnine was conveyed into the sealed bottle,
forwarded by the police-sergeant. Who so
conveyed it ? Deduction : —Either the tank-
water was uupoisoued and only the test-bottle-
ful was poisoned; or else the tank-water was
poisoned and the test-bottleful over-poisoned.
It is lucky the practical joker didn’t know
enough chemistry to enable him to make strych-
nine form soluble salts. If the dimensions of
the tank were known, it would be interesting
to work out the problem as to how much
strychnine would have to be thrown into the
water to enable that fluid to take up all the
strychnine it is capable of dissolving.—Yours,
&c., Chemist.

Quotations from S.M. Herald’s reports of tw°
Federation speeches made in New South Wale 8
Legislative Assembly within a week of each
other by Premier Parkes :
Parkes, 21st May, 1891.
The Convention very pro-
perly had provided that
when three States were pre-
pared to accept the Consti-
tution they might apply to
the Imperial Parliament for
a measure to invite them,
and three States would accept
this Constitution. If a.
Federation were formed of
three or four States and
N.S.W. should be out he
would tell them the conse-
quences. . . It could not
be the seat of Federal Go-
vernment. That once gone,
even if they had to go on
their bended knees for per-
mission afterwards, the seat
would be gone for ever. . .
S.A., Queensland and Tas
mania were as free as
N.S.W. was, and they could
. . form a Federation. . .
It would be a most disas-
trous thing for N.S.W.
Parkes, 28th May, 1891.
He (Dibbs) told the House
that, if the Government de-
layed submitting the resolu-
tion on the Draft Bill of the
Convention, some threecolo-
nies would come together
and form a Federation fx-om
which this colony would be
excluded. Now, that seemed
to him to be akin to the low
motives of neax-Jy the whole
of the persons who were op-
posing Federation. Was
there any man in the House,
or any man of intelligence
out of it, who believed fora
moment that any of the
colonies were ready to rush
and take some mean advan-
tage of New South Wales
on that question of Federa-
tion ? The thing did not
hold water for a moment.
Sir Henry Parkes’ present definition of the
status of the Convention’s Constitution Bill is
that no Australian Parliament can “ touch a
letter or comma ” of it; but that each Parlia-
ment can suggest amendments, excisions, and
recastings, and that these must be submitted
to “a Convention of the same character, and
same power, and, in like manner, representing
all the colonies, as the Convention which
framed” the present Bill. Copeland had no
hesitation in describing Parkes’ manoeuvring
as a “trap” and a “ trick,” and argued that if
a second Conference “refused to agree with”
the suggested amendments of the various Parlia-
ments, “ the Bill as now constituted would
have to be submitted to the country, and must
become the Constitution of the Federal States.”
There are chinks in Copeland’s logic, since
“the country” might reject the twice-offered
Bill, or again refer it with suggestions of
amendment; all the same, he is not far out
when he describes the Premier’s finessing as a
‘ 1 trap. ” It is an artful trap ; more especially
is this seen when the coercive nature of the
clause enabling three provinces to federate in
advance of the rest is considered.
W hen Colonel De Wolski, the energetic and
vigorous Imperial officer just now in the N.S.
Wales Service (and who is hugely disgusted
at the incapacity and ignorance of his depart-
mental chiefs), found out that the Bare Island
forts were formed on rubbish instead of upon
the concrete which had been paid for with tax-
payers’ money, one of the persons bowled out
became very nasty and threatening, whereupon
the Colonel promised to throw him into the sea.
It is quite a pity that Colonel Dk Wolski has
not legal power to throw, into the sea all con-
cerned in one of the most disgraceful and
treasonable jobs ever literally unearthed. It
would appear that the contractors, M‘Leod and
Co., “tipped in” loads of “rubble-stone,
pipeclay, and dirt,” without a trace of cement,
as a substitute for concrete, and as a conscien-
tious reward for their “extra” services they
charged the Government £33,857 4s. 10d.,
instead of the original amount of their tender,
£25,020 15s. 4d. The then Colonial Archi-
tect, Mr. Barnet, accepted their tender for
the erection of adjoining barracks, and did not
report to the Minister for Works for eight
months the fact of acceptance. Clerks of Works
Colley and Purkis departmentally supervised
the works, after the manner of their kind—•
Colley visiting Bare Island quite three times a
year, and Purkis, the permanent supervisor,
two or three times a week, while both Colley
and Purkis had “every confidence in” the
contractors. Similarly, M‘Leod left everything
to his manager and sometime partner, Noble.
Then Purkis was good enough to borrow £750
from M ‘Leod. The careless Barnet —for nobody
thinks lie was more than careless having
retired on a full pension, is to be let severely
alone. Colley and one M ‘Shane are to be
pensioned off. Purkis is to show cause why he
should not be dismissed. M‘Leod is to be
asked to refund £6343 3s. 5d., and more when
other calculations are finished, and, if neces-
sary, sued for the amounts ; and both he and
Noble are to be debarred from tendering
again for Government works. The stiff-necked,
inartistic, and unpoetical De W olski is to be
accorded a vote of thanks for spoiling every-
body else’s little horn spoon,

Compare the New South Wales election fore-
casts of a few prominent politicians; multiply
them by the number of candidates; divide by
the number of seats; apply the “rule of three ”
to the number of issues, the number of parties,
and the number of electorates ; shake the result
in your hat, and discern the solution . Dikes
declares that the elections will give him “a
large majority ; ” Barton says they will evolve
an anti-Federation party, and yet show that ‘ ‘ a
large majority of the people ” are favour-
able to Federation in the abstract, though
opposed to the Convention’s Bill ; Reid
thinks they will be “eminently beneficial to
the Freetrade party ” ; Garvan, that they will
“ bring back a decided preponderance of mem-
bers antagonistic to Freetrade,” and a much
larger number of labour representatives, but
that there will not be “ any large party formed
distinctly on the lines of its opposition to
Federation ” ; and Want holds that a strong
anti-federation party will certainly be formed,
and that a “ much stronger Freetrade party will
be returned.” What is the value of any one or
all of these forecasts ? Alsolutely nil.

Mr. Supreme Court Judge Chubb (N.Q.), in
Regina v. Yosper, for “sedition”:—
There is no moral harm in advocating a Republic, pro-
vided peaceful means are recommended. I believe, and 1
think in common with most intelligent men, that the
conversion of the Australian colonies into a Republic
is inevitable, and I am of opinion that the person who
does not, in some measure, agree with that idea is one
who is incapable of comprehending the destiny of his
country. . . Success alone justifies rebellion ;ifit is
successful, then, whether the effects are good or ill, no one
can judge of them, and none can punish the principals;
if, however, it is not successful, society avenges itself on
the rebels, even though it may subsequently admit that
they were right. ... If the Crown placed the same
construction upon Chief Justice Lilley’s words that they
had upon those of the defendant, and the jury endorsed
that construction, then the Chief Justice could be
punished as could be any other individual.
Now, then, Premier Griffith. Are you
going to have Mr. Justice Chubb arraigned
before both Houses of Parliament? And do
you expect to secure an absolute majority of
both Chambers to deprive him of his seat on
the Supreme Court Bench ? Hey !

Ex-Speaker Groom, of Queensland, advocates
a tax on wool. He draws attention to this
point;—
Look at the country through which the railway runs
out to the West. Nothing but sheep on it. You may
look in vain for homesteads after leaving Cowrie Junc-
tion. The railways run through magnificent country, but
it contains no human beings.
True, every word of it. Yet, these landholders
are the pirates who have stolen the land from
the people, and the canoodlers who legislated to
secure to their own class a 21 years’ lease of all
the other available Queensland country, who
are now breathing mock moral sentiments about
“law and order,” and have persuaded the
Government, also of their own kidney, to back
them up in the wholesale importation of black-
legs by means of gatling-guns and soldiers at an
expenditure of £BOOO a week. Small wonder
that unionist shearers, feeling the gall of the
yoke, sometimes curse, and even yell out
“Whoa’’and “Boo,” upon finding the whole
unbearable weight of class government pressing-
on their burdened backs.
The suppression of Postmaster-General O’Con-
nor is fast becoming a crying necessity in New
South Wales. Foreign visitors suffer from an
impression that Daniel O’Connor is New
South Wales, and that all New South Wales is
Daniel O’Connor, and this idea brings the pro-
vince into contempt. It is unnecessary to men-
tion that Daniel delivered an address to Sara
Bernhardt when that eminent Frenchwoman
arrived last week ; he would have done that if
he had been dead, and he reads an address -to
everybody. He delivers speeches of welcome
to footballers, dukes, scullers, prominent
aboriginals, Home Rulers, poets, literary men,
troops, consuls, revivalists, and new Governors
—in fact, nobody of any note ever arrives in
Sydney without the Postmaster-General seizing
that person and bending him violently forward
over his stomach in an affectionate embrace.
He goes out and wobbles violently on the
heaving deep when anybody is expected off the
port, and greets him in the name of the nation.
When anybody is buried he discharges an un-
grammatical oration over the grave, and in-
cidentally conveys an impression that he and


the deceased were boys together, quite regard
less of the fact that the deceased may be 30
years younger or 40 years older than himself.
He proposes everybody’s health, and is
the last man to weep over everybody
when that individual quits the country
amid the regrets of the entire populace.
When anybody does anything he is on hand to
embrace him, and hint that he knew all along
that he was going to do it; and when anybody
fails to do anything, he is the first man to clear
out of his company with a reproachful look in
his eye, which says plainly that he knew he
wasn’t going to do it. He is present at every
banquet, where he looks as if he knew more
than the Encyclopedia Bextannica, and when
anybody of importance happens to die, Daniel
O’Connor is at the door inquiring about him in
his last moments. If an emperor be blown up,
the Postmaster-General looks as if he used to
sleep in the same bed with that emperor ; and
when any new place is discovered for the first
time, he wears the expression of a man who has
been there frequently. But some day or other,
in his anxiety to embrace a celebrated visitor
before anybody else gets hold of him, he will
go and embrace a smallpox patient by mistake,
and come to grief in consequence. But he is
very slow to do this, and, meanwhile, he makes
the country feel tired.
In a recent big Parliamentary division a
member returned in the labour-interest was led in
drunk to vote for his party.
S.M. Herald congratulates the latest
Judge-Knight as “ Sir William Windeyer ” ;
Sydney D.T. as “Sir Charles Windeyer.” The
Bulletin condoles with W. C. Windeyer.
It looks as if the Single-tax crowd were
going to split the N.S.W. Fre'etrade vote. The
old Freetrade party—that is to say, the old Calico
Jimmy crowd—hate the Single-taxers like poison.
From all we hear, it is just about time that
one or two prominent Single-tax candidates for
N.S.W. Parliament attended to their urgent
private affairs and left the public business of the
province severely alone.
Parkes at Cooma :
\\ hen he first held office in N.S. Wales it was behind
V ictoria in population by a quarter of a million, and it
was more through his efforts than those of any other man
that to-day N.S. Wales took the lead of the Australian
group. (Cheers.)
Well, every man has his failings, but why “ blow ”
about them ?
The sisters of a man—a lunatic—recently
executed in Australia, have been compelled to
leave the town in which they lived owing to
“public feeling;” while a brother, who contri-
buted to their support, has been requested to re-
sign his position in the same city, on account of
pressure put by customers upon his employers.
When a man is judicially butchered, all his people
are socially butchered with him.
S, M. Herald is supporting Parkes, and
has obligingly supplied him with a cry wherein to
appeal to the country. The Herald says :
“The great dominant question to be decided will be—
Is this colony for Australian unity and intercolonial
freedom of trade, or against it?
The Bulletin says that the great dominant
question is—ls N.S.W. for Australian unity and
Protection against the world ? The case thus
stated may not suit the Herald and Parkes, but
that is the exact case notwithstanding.
The Labour Party appears to be practically
unorganised in the one-horse Conservative island
of Tasmania, whose chief periodical thrill, pre-
vious to its late silver boom, used to be a spasm of
yearning to be annexed to Victoria, a consumma-
tion that the last-named province did not hanker
after. As Victoria is, however, practically run-
ning the silver boom, Tasmanian “annexationists”
ought to be satisfied. The Labour candidates
were nnmistakeably downed at the recent general
flections in the Island—the miners’ candidate,
Haslett, being badly defeated for Cumberland,
which includes the Zeehan silver-field ; and Mac-
donald and Dugan, laboui’-eandidates, being
sinkers in South Launceston, Dugan losing his
£25 deposit. Nevertheless, things are brightening
and the day will come.
“Old” Kearney (A. J, K.), a veteran
Australian newspaper-man, passed in his last
screed one day last week. In the olden days of
Melbourne journalism, Kearney was one of the
smartest all-round men then going. Melbourne,
Hobart, Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane’
Sydney, and doubtless, many Australian bush
towns, have suffered newspaper-education at his
haUds, his lines gradually but surely falling in
more and more uncongenial places. Poor
Kearney ! Old age found him with one solitary
but precious tooth in his gums, turning out
white-haired screed for Sydney Evening News
—the self same Kearney who, we remember,
wrote a capital article for the very first number of
The Bulletin. There is a good Hobart story
about Kearney. He was in that city of melan-
choly stagnation stone-broke, with an uncertain
screed-pittance coming in, and unable to raise the
money to take him out of Tasmania. One night
in a nectar-shop, a press comrade waggishly sug-
gested that Kearney might raise the wind by
giving a lecture, saying that he would get the
necessary tickets printed, “If you do,” added
Boniface, entering into the joke, “I’ll hire the
Town Hall for you.” “Gimme a subject,” said
Kearney. “Oh, on ‘Everything in general and
nothing in particular.’” “I’ll doit,” gurgled Kear-
ney, “but I’ve not got a dress-suit.” “Ican lend
you a swallow-tail coat,” said his friend. “I’ll
lend you a waistcoat,” cried another. “And I’ll
lend you black trousers,” added the landlord. The
joke became an earnest enterprise. The lecture
came off. The Town Hall was filled, and Kearney
appeared on the stage also “very full,” and
dressed in trousers that only reached half-way
down his ankles, and betrayed the fact that he
wore no socks, a baggy vest that could have easily
concealed a bolster, and a crinkled-up coat
about four sizes too small. Also Boniface’s
gold watch and chain and pendants. This
gorgeous scarecrow, speaking without notes,
commenced inflicting the most hideous babble
cm the audience. One disgusted citizen got
up in about 10 minutes and started for the door.
“ Stop, my friend,” said Kearney, The citizen
turned round. “You’re not going out?” “I
am, I’ve had enough of this rot.” “Are you
sure you’re going ?” “Yes, confound you !” and
the citizen made another break for the door.
“You’re quite sure you’re going ?” “Yes, I tell
you.” “ Then, ‘moind the shtep as yez go’”
-a theatrical gag then current, which fairly
brought down the house and broke up the lecture.
As Kearney retired ho was closely pursued by
Boniface, and the owners of the “dress ’’garments,
who feared misadventures. But he raised his
passage-money all right.

The Sara Bernhardt enterprise started
at Melbourne Princess’ with a play already un-
favourably known to 80 per cent., perhaps, of the
great audience assembled. To suppose that many
of them came to enjoy “ Camille ” —the wire-
drawn love-story of a sentimental young sensualist
and a consumptive courtesan —would be absurd.
They came charged with the expectation of seeing
5.8., and ready either to be disillusioned by the
bearer of a big name, or to feel convinced that
French plays, at advanced rates, must inevitably
prove “no go” in Australia. Sara Bernhardt
upset this conviction by a performance which
soared high above the hopes of all, save the few
who had seen her in other parts and places.
People who, not being French, were content to
rely upon their English recollections of the dif-
ferent characters in the play and the unfolding of
its plot, instead of attempting to follow the dia-
logue in a book, were fascinated by Bernhardt’s
charm of face and gesture, moved by her nervous
force, and always persuaded by her sweet natural-
ness. As a Frenchwoman, she talks with a rapidity
that bewilders the bookworms entirely, but as an
actress she speaks with voice, eyes, arms, or
feet, if necessary, the eternal cosmopolitan
language of the soul. (N.B. —This is intended
for a burst of enthusiasm.) The dullest pluto-
crat in the “ circle ” must have understood
Marguerite Gautier when, after hearing Armand’s
vigils under her window, she strikes the keynote
of the trouble in one soft, lingering sentence—
“ e’est tres gentil, cela.” The book translates this
into “ very nice ! ” but it means a whole volume
of poetry. To- particularise all the points at which
Sara asserted her divinity in its [gentler phases
would take too long. Besides, a special war cor-
respondent could convey no adequate idea of the
awful battle of her emotions, and the heartrending
moans of her wounded feelings in the scene which
is ended by Armand flinging her down and throw-
ing bits of paper at her. As for the death, there
isn’t a corpse can touch it. Bernhardt is for all
stage purposes a lovely young creature, certainly
more delightful to the naked eye than she was 11
years ago. Time has reverently filled up the
former hollows in her cheeks and rounded her
arms to the sculptor’s ideal. After it is all over
one recalls to mind the fact that she wore ravish-
ing costumes, but not while she is on the stage
does Worth (of Paris) get his due. Things (a
suitable word !) were quite otherwise in the case
of Sara’s angular ghost, Mrs. Brown-Potter.
The company form a fairly bright tail to the comet
and are evidently higher-class performers than the
luckless crowd imported here some three years
ago. If Armand and De tlrville lack style,
according to English notions, they are at least
decent actors. A quite distingue-looking little
party appeared in a minor character ; the old
Duval shaped as a heavy father should, and a
rollicking low comedian has the best artificial
bald-head ever seen in this country. It is suf-
ficiently natural to set a ballet-girl dreaming of
bouquets and diamonds—especially diamonds. The
minor ladies seem middling, and that the show
was suitably staged goes without saying. It may
be reckless to prophesy success for a season of
foreign performances at foreign prices. But we
here hazard a belief that Sara Bernhardt will fill
the Princess’ every night for the next four weeks,
Day of Rest excepted, and twice on Saturdays.
The reception given her on her first appearance,
and Sara’s reception of the reception, were things
to be remembered. Few imagined that Austra-
lians were capable of such genuine admiration for
any lady in p, long dress. Unfortunately, they
spoilt the effect of an attempt to sing the “ Mar-
seillaise ” (without the -words) by roaring “Rule
Britannia ” directly afterwards.

Williamson and Garner wanted no speech
from the rostrum before the seats for the Bern-
hardt premiere were auctioned, but the presiding
Baillieu was not to be denied. The aristocracy of
Melbourne were before him, and he eloquently
explained that their duty to society and the
drama required them to state, in plain figures,
whether the stars of Europe were to shoot across
to this hemisphere, or hover always round the
haunts of an older civilisation. That fetched
them to the tune of 255. average for circle, and
17s. fid. for reserved stall seats. “ Cleopatra ”
will probably be brought under the hammer in
the same way.
* ** *
“LaTosca” on Monday strengthened the
first night opinion that Bernhardt has come here
to conquer. In Sardou’s play no trace of the
artist’s former ideality was perceivable, and she
was somewhat more buxom-looking in her Italian
dress of the period. Sara started off as a joyous,
wheedling young thing, whose jealousy finds vent
in feminine tantrums. It is the jealousy of a
warm-blooded girl, not of a Family Herald
heroine. After her lover had fallen into Scarpia’s
clutches, Tosca remained petulant until she be-
came aware that the assistant tormentor was
giving her poor boy fits in the adjoining room,
whereupon her aspect changed as suddenly as her
nature and she gave a representation of despair
that was utterly appalling. This, end of the
third act, moved the house even more than
Tosca’s sticking and laying out of the wicked
baron—perhaps because the public blood was
by that time frozen. The brief, final scene froze
it harder still. At her most tragic moments
Bernhardt does nothing that seems traditional or
studied. In her dealings with the corpse she
strikes no attitude which betrays her consciousness
of the folks in front. French enthusiasts who
say Sara’s histrionic genius has come from the
clouds will not be contradicted in Melbourne.
The Armand of Saturday made an acceptable
lover _ again on this occasion. The hungry
socialist who dies in a well was unpicturesquely
played by a stoutish party, but the actor who
made a first appearance as Scarpia was a decided
success on lines quite different to Bellew’s.
Several minor characters were also played most
conscientiously, and if the mounting fall's short of
the Potter production in point of splendour, it is
sometimes more suitable. The season threatens,
however, to be haunted by a seedy carpet which
went right through “ Camille,” and still had pos-
session of the floor on Monday. This acre of
faded Axminster would look fresher for a sound
thumping in the back-yard. They play “La
Tosca ” on Friday and Saturday nights, and
“Cleopatra” will probably fall a victim to the
asp on Monday,

When the large floral devices and high-
toned emblems were being shovelled up from the
orchestra, after the first act of “La Dame aux
Camelias,” a small wreath —the kind of thing that
a child hangs on a tombstone—was thrown to
Bernhardt from the amphitheatre. She picked up
that tribute, leaving the expensive vegetables to be
looked after by the funny man. It was quite a
touching incident, and let us hope that it hadn’t
been readied up beforehand.
** * *
“ The Idler” drew large houses during his
first week at Melbourne Bijou, and seems likely
to suit the spirit of this Bernhardtian era. Cart-
wright’s uncanny conception of the mother-fond
bairn is not generally admired, but the other two
gentlemen from Golden Valley decidedly changed
for the better after the first night. Titheradge put
a coat of chalk over his ruddy glow and no longer
gives one the impression of a baronet who makes
hay whilst the sun shines, but looks like the rising
parliamentarian, pallied o’er by the recollection of
having been a wild dawg, an undisciplined dingo,
in days gone by. Also Boucicault lost no time
in discarding his lounging-jacket for a frock-coat
of formal cut, which is more suggestive of Wall-
street and the almighty dollar. Still, it is
hard to see how he can float Yankee com-
panies successfully unless he buys a huge
moustache. There is something very young and
amateurish about this Simeon Strong. The
derision with which he receives Titheradge’s
explanation of the shooting incident is worthy of
a schoolboy. “You didn’t chuck a humming-top
at my little brother ! Ho, no-o ! Of course not.
You meant to hit the pear-tree, you did'—didn’t
he, Mark ?” Miss Nethersole’s appeal to Simeon
is another instance of short-weight in the author’s
text, and even that charming young manneriste
(new word), with all her intensity, is unable to
make more of it. However, “ The Idler ” has a
real strong backbone of human interest, besides
being naughty in the main idea and nice in several
small particulars.

“Bridget O’Brien ” continues to enjoy a
high Hibernian time of it at the Royal, and it is
evident that Sheridan’s patent for an exception-
able female impersonation will hold good through
a series of comedies. By and bye the Widdy can
marry one of her pursuers and bring down the
final curtain to a roar of sympathy by throwing
her baffled spouse but of window, or something. For
it seems that the fair proprietress of Alphonso-
Napoleon is a demon when roused, like the
British lion. In point of fact, Sheridan has been
having a Little Peach duet with somebody
belonging to an opposition show and it
is averred, whether truly or not this de-
ponent cannot say, that he assaulted the
other person with a thick stick. Which
reminds us that the little man has talked of blood-
shed on previous occasions. American artists—
clever or otherwise—are very apt to hanker after
gore, and some of them are herewith enjoined to
keep their hands in their pockets and their tongues
between their teeth. Peace on earth is better than
arnica on your bruises, and one man is as good as
another when they both mean business, appar-
ently.

At the Alexandra they are doing solid
business with “ The Scout.” Lily Dampier now
shoots the neck off a, bottle with as much calm
precision as distinguishes the descent of Carver’s
horse into the tank, whilst the Injuns are becom-
ing patterns for the old style of pale-face super,
who can’t be made to look furious anyway.

To-night* (Thursday) they start “Poor

At Melbourne Town Hall (where Ernest
Hutcheson satisfied his friends on Saturday), the
Hallbs were to re-appear on Tuesday night. Ten
thousand voices are to chortle the new Australian
Anthem at the Exhibition next Saturday, the
halls are offering their good old “ host of attrac-
tions,” and other shows thrive according to
custom. If custom isn’t plentiful, they don’t
thrive much.

Janet Achurch was determined that if
Sydney people could not have Bernhardt they
should nevertheless have “ Camille,” and so that
unhealthy plant oped its sickly blooms at Sydney
Garrick contemporaneously with its Bernhardtian
blossoming forth at Melbourne Princess’. The
fair Janet is usually heavily handicapped by the
bad judgment displayed in casting her plays and
a lack of attention to detail, due no doubt to inept
stage-management. These weaknesses were, how-
ever, never more conspicuously in evidence than on
the first night of “ Camille,” when the fatuity of
the individual who cast Harry Power as the
Count de Varville—with a low comedy swagger
would have wrecked the play had not
the gallery been in very good humour. On
Monday night better counsel prevailed, and
Charles Charrington successfully doubled de
Varville and Duval pere, the latter being excel-
lently handled, though “made-up” all snowy
white bar the eyebrows, which were of raven black-
ness, an incongruity whose reasonableness is not
apparent. Probably, Janet Achurch’s Camille is
her best performance of the present season, and
worthy of a place alongside her Nora, Gilberte
and Fedora. It is free from the repellant throat-
gargling gurgles of her “Forget-rne-Not,” and is
only marred by occasional extravagances of
gesture, and some purposeless rushings up and
down stage, meant, possibly, to simulate terror,
but more suggestive of burlesque. Herbert
Flemming’s Armand is a carefully-studied,
highly dramatic and emotional character that
errs chiefly because stagey and over-demonstrative.
Armand, as we read him, was a dainty, highly-
strung man whose anger and jealousy couldn’t
have found vent in bluster and foot-stamping, who
would have stilletoed instead of bludgeoning the
objects of his wrath. But the tendency of the
whole performance is towards a boisterousness
and extravagance, which fatally blemish the
Prudence of Meta Pelham, otherwise happily
conceived. In certain lines Emma Bronton is a
capable actress, but though she looks nice enough
to eat, it is a physical impossibility for her to look
Nfimne, while her development makes her a bad foil
for Camille. Alice May makes a bright and chirpy
Nichette ; the Olympe of Miss Fortescue is credit-
able ; Charles Westrnacott’s Gustave is, perhaps,
too quiet only by contrast with the prevailing
noisiness; as Gaston, Harry Leston is all right in
an old part, nevertheless not quite in his vein. A
matinee benefit in aid of the Women’s College
Fund will take place on Saturday, when the
greater part of the stalls will be reserved and
Doll’s House ” will be played. “Asin a Look-
ing-Glass ” (the French version played by Bern-
hardt is named “Lena”), by F. C. Phillips, will
be played for the first time in Sydney on Saturday
evening. “ Devil Caresfoot,” Haddon Chambers’
earliest work, and “A Doll’s House,” thecourteous
Cunard informs us, are both underlined for pro-
duction, if necessary,
* -* * *
So far our prognostication of success for
“Jane” have been fully realised, for S.R.O. has
been hung out nightly and, unless “The Gon-
doliers ” knocks it endways, the season promises
to be the largest in the annals of Sydney
Criterion. It is very delicately handled at times.
Some of the broad lines are simply skated over so
swiftly that statements scarcely provoke a laugh
while, if emphasised, they might cause a cyclone
of cacchination, Brough, as “ the splendid liar ”
who proves his master, out of his mouth, to be
“ a bit of a liar ” himself, has embellished his
William considerably since opening-night, and
Arthur Lawrence’s Kershaw beams more and
more like a beatified Pickwick. The full signi-
ficance of Jane’s command to William —responsive
to the philanthropist’s remark that he in-
tends to enjoy himself in London—“ Hand
Mr. Kershaw a tart,” has so far been
lost to the simple-minded and unsuspicious
Sydney public ; but the veiled point penetrates
their perceptions, when Cecil Ward says, in
defence of his supposititious wife’s alleged desire
to keep secret the existence of her mythical off-
spring, “ Some women are like that, you know.”
They do know. Ward’s desire to borrow some
other man’s wife for 24 hours is also recognised as
a brilliant suggestion, and Pattie Browne makes a
hit when, in response to Kershaw’s question as to
her maternity, she invites him to inspect her
marriage-certificate of the same day’s date. Sug-
gestiveness, however, goes just a shade too far
when, in response to William’s suggestion that
they’ve forgotten the baby, he is requested by his
wife and her master to leave the room. The posi-
tion, however, is greedily swallowed by the very
people who strained at the gnat of Ibsenism.
Miss Romer, as the amorous and mortified
spi nster, is great in a thankless part, and Mrs. Bryer
as the mother who “ has forgotten the Foster”
though she apparently remembered the Guinness
scores heavily. “Jane ” should fill the bill until
the MacMahonian production of “ Evangeline,”
now running in Sandhurst and Ballarat, on
June 27.

Bland Holt, after three months’ big busi-
ness at Sydney Royal, has vamoosed to Adelaide
where he will continue his career of crime, carnage
and bloodshed. On Tuesday night the Opera
company opened in “ The Gondoliers,” the last
joint creation of Sullivan and Gilbert, with a cast
similar to that of its latest Melbourne perform-
ances, and differing only from the earlier ones in
that Elsie Cameron plays the Duchess of Plaza-
Toro —the part originally handled by Maggie
Moore; Henry Braoy, Marco, originally played
by Leumane while Violet Varley has succeeded Ida
Osborne as Tessa. The season promises to be one
of the biggest ever known at the Royal. Our
notice is unavoidably held over till next week.

The Jerseys and aides dropped into Syd-
ney Her Majesty’s on Monday night, in that
quiet, previously-unannounced manner which de-
prives the management of that opportunity for
the bold advertisement of gubernatorial patronage
that usually swells the treasury by the sparse
five-bobs of toadyism. After a period of great
anxiety, equine matters are now working smoothly,
and the smiles of James and Joseph MacMahon,
in conjunction with that of Frank J. Currier,
their stage-director, whose name hitherto we
have spelt as it is pronounced, fill the vestibule
with a radiance far surpassing that of incan-
descent lamps, shine they ever so brightly.
The brothers have in reserve a play named
“ The Still Alarm,” by Joseph Arthur,
which deals with conflagrations. One scene re-
presents the interior of a fire-brigade station as
the alarm rings, whereupon the horses run out of
their stalls to be harnessed by electricity, the fire-
men slide down the central pole and tumble into
their boots on the waggon, and the engine dashes
off O.P. inside eight seconds, the normal American
time in crack brigades. “Siberia” is doing very
good business, but “ The County Fair ” jumps the
claim on Saturday night, dead sure.

The event at Coogee Aquarium is said to
be the performance of a self-taught blue groper
who comes to the surface of a fish-tank and enter-
tains the audience with a dissertation on the
South American difficulty intoned in Barcelonian-
Belfast.

Last Thursday night the übiquitous
Wyburd gave one of his enjoyable smoke concerts
at Bondi Aquarium when about 150 members
rolled up to bo entertained by the tootling of the
Hungarian Cornet Quartette, Messrs. Fowler,
Tilley, M‘Mahon and von der Mehden and the
business of the clever Faust family. Another
“smoker ” takes place on Thursday week.

At Brisbane Opera House, Dan Barry has
been doing a big business with “After Dark.”
He, O’Neill and the sprightly Adelaide Cushman (!)
get heaps of marmalade from the local press. At
the Gaiety, St. John has put up Halliday’s old-
time burlesque, “Kenilworth.” W. H. Manning
has arrived to arrange for the production of “ Dr.
Bill,” by Myra Kemble and company, at the
Royal.
At Poverty Point.
Patti and Bernhardt have not loved money for its own
sake-it is only their artistic ambition to be paid higher
than anyone else, as a mark of pre-eminence ; wherefore,
when Patti and Nilsson were in the same company, Patti
was content to get guineas as against Nilsson’s pounds.
Other people have spent all the money of your Bernhardts
and Pattis.
Williamson and G. worked up the Bernhardt boom
without any placards—to the great disgust of the bill-
stickers.
How does Bernhardt stand amid the actresses of all
time ? Sara blends such opposites as Rachel and Mdlle.
Mars. She cuts up into Modjeska, Ellen Terry, and
half-a-dozen others. The Helen Faucit type is lofty, but
namby-pamby, for it seems that greatness must be in
wickedness, grand passion. All Sara’s great pieces wind
up with a death-scene, varied in Camille, Tosca,
Fedora, Ruy Bias, Theodora, Cleopatra, Frou Frou, Lena
(As in a Looking Glass), Adrienne Lecouvreur, and an
the rest, with a subtle art that never palls.
It would be possible for Bernhardt to give her pei-
formances in French, with an English-speaking company,
and perhaps some people would like it better, for the in-
congruity is by no means so great as may be imagined.
Rossi and Salvini, the Italian tragedians, went all o.ei

English, acting in Berlin, as Hamlet, with the German
company, and it came out beautifully.
Mdme. Bernhardt does not use ttie French “ Sara,” but
spells her first name with an H, “Sarah,” in her auto-
graph, which is bold and large.
A Sydney Daily Teleoraph man has discovered that
Sara Bernhardt doesn’t Wear corsets.
An advantage of Bernhardt’s is in having so many
original parts: Fedora, Theodora, Tosca, Lena, Cleo-
patra, and no one else dares to play them in the first
circles of Francs.
Sara Bernhardt’s alternative, at 15, was “The Convent
or the Stage,” so she says. Turning up George Sands’
plays, one finds an am ising one, “Mirelle,” where the
Sara Bernhardt went to a nunnery, but, at 46 years old,
came in contact with the players, and is introduced
behind the scenes, with odd contrasts.
On Bernhardt’s first night in Melbourne there was £Bl5
in the theatre as compared with the Gaiety Co.’s £530, the
next highest on record.
Sara Bernhardt’s Sydney Town Hall reception should
have been delayed, in the interests of Abbey and W. and
G., until just prior to her Sydney opening. It was a
funereal affair, somewhat relieved by the organ playing of
Mr. Sykes, the talented Huddersfieldian who, thanks to
the resignation of the touring Burdekin, was permitted to
give a taste of his quality'. By the way, why did the
S.M. Herald, a paper that went out of its way to eulogise
a late use of Sydney’s organ, as a mere instrument of
accompaniment, omit all mention of Mr. Sykes’ organ-
recital at Sydney University ?
there are rumours in London of a coolness between the
divine Ellen Terry and the ricketty Henry. A rival
Richard is in the field, ’tis said, hence the tears. Ellen,
whom age cannot wither nor custom stale, was never
noted for constancy', as parish registers and the archives
of the law-courts can testify. The name of the gent has
not transpired—or is it gents?
Sylvia Grey is on her way with the Gaiety crowd ; but
nothing would induce Letty Lind to undergo another
course of—-well, it would be cruel to give names.
The following, from a London correspondent by last
mail, will now have to be read in connection with the
attack made since the mail left by Phil Robinson (editor
of Augustus Harris’ paper London Sunday Times, without
the knowledge or consent of his employer) upon Tummy:
“ Augustus Harris is likely to achieve the summit of his
ambition, for it is arranged that the Emperor of Germany
will pay a visit to the City when he comes over to Eng-
land in July. This will mean, of course, according to
custom, a baronetcy for the Lord Mayor, and knighthood
for the Sheriffs. Gus, is big enough as it is. but Drury
Lane won’t be able to hold him as ‘Sir Gus., Bart.’ He
generally drives to the theatre in his official Coach, with
gold-laced flunkeys in attendance. This is considered
bad form by City magnates, but what cares he ? It is a
good ad., and that is all he thinks of.” How furious Harris
must be over the Phil Robinson affair !
Theatrical managers are notoriously disloyal personages
in private* as regards mere political loyally, but nobody
has to put on the kootoo so much, for business reasons,
Obvious. Look now at Gusty Harris, owner of Madame
Midas’ well-corned Phil. Robinsonian paper, Sunday
Times, In which to ’Arris’s Jenkinsonian ’error, Phil., put a
reference to the notorious Sandringham mortgage. Im-
perial Wales summons Harris, crawling on his stomach, to
the Mawlburrow, and poor graceless Phil’s sacked. Fred.
Lyster ruined himself in Australia by incautious American
talk, in a Ballarat bar, about Clontarf.
Young Masherton, on the stage, complained that Props
didn’t give him real chicken, for a stage-supper. “ All
right,” says Props, “ you’re poisoned in the last act, and
shall have the real thing.”
While Irving was acting Hamlet, the Chinese Am-
bassador, and staff, in full regalia, visited behind the
scenes. They missed their way, and the whole procession
was only just stopped from marching on to the stage, in
the plaj'-scene, an effect which might even have been
instructive to Shakespeare.
London critics, who are all dramatists, find Bulwer’s
“Money,” as revived at the Vaudeville, very poor stuff
nowadays, but one would like to see the Jones, Pinero,
Grundy, or Chambers, who can ’ turn out another
“ Money.”
What’s in a name? Forrester, an esteemed London
detor, was warned Frost, but a manager made him
bhange it.
Barnum’s will covers 100 pages Of legal foolscap. He
left £1,000,000, of which his wife receives £22,000 ab-
solutely and £B,OOO a year. The rest goes in bequests to
various institutions.
In Barnum’s troubled days, when he proposed to buy
the American museum, a friend who was aware of the
State of his finances said, “You buy the American
iiduseuiii! With what?” “ Brass,” replied Barnum, “for
gold and silver have I none.”
It is amusing to notice how many professional singer®
now advertise themselves in the German papers as “from
Australia.”
When General Tom Thumb was arranging to marry
Lavinia Warren, the dwarf, in face of the ferocious
jealousy of Commodore Nutt, who once knocked the
General down, some mischievous young ladies concealed
themselves and overheard the General’s proposal. He
began in a very business-like manner by producing an
enormous policy of insurance upon his property and
ended by puling his arm round her waist and kissing
her.
Irving intends to produce “Henry Vlll.”—that is to
oay, it certain rumours current about himself and Ellen
Terry are not true.
Two adventurous ladies have ventured on the experi-
ment of producing Ibsen’s “ Hedda Gabler”at London
Vaudeville, and have made a decided score, says a cor-
respondent. No play of Ibsen’s has been so well acted in
London. Miss Robins, as Hedda, is a big success, and
Miss Marion Lea, as Mrs. Elvsted, quite carries the audi-
ence away. A few more such performances and there
would be hope for Ibsen on the English stage.
It is said that Mrs. Langtry is many thousands of
pounds poorer by her venture in management. It was
announced just before the mail left that she had accepted
an engagement with Gus. Harris for Drury Lane at a
salary of £l5O per week. People may believe as much as
they like about the muchness of the salary.
Wilson Barrett, says our London correspondent, has
put up at the New Olympic a version of the time-honoured
“Belphegor,” which he calls “ The Acrobat.” It is beau-
tifully mounted and dressed. Wilson is also going to
inflict upon a suffering British public a series of matinees
of “ Hamlet.”
A different bill for each of the three first Sara Bernhardt
bights meant three successive columns of notice in each
of the morning papers.
W. and G. were quite sentimental in their advt. of
Ryley’s benefit at Melbourne Princess's. “ Within a few
months his talents as an artist, and his amiable and gentle-
manly qualities as a man, have won for him a foremost
position in the esteem of the press, the public, and of his
coadjutors in the theatre,” ran the managerial note.
Wherefore the firm “tendered Mr. Ryley a complimentary
benefit as a testimonial of our appreciation.” They
couldn’t have expressed themselves more heartily if the
baritone had been an old and valued head of a counting-
house, but Ryley deserves well of the perfesh, inasmuch
as he has proved that good-fellowship is not an un-
known quantity in the market-value of a good actor.
Everybody seems to like Ryley, who carries a card of in-
troduction in his face, which is happy and wholesome
rather than theatrically handsome. According to rumour,
too, there are several husbands and fathers deeply in-
debted to the young man for his stern refusal to take up
the part of Don Giovanni when it was pressed upon him.
Good old Ryley!
A Melbourne publication was under obligations to a
manager, who came round complaining that he didn’t get
warm eulogium. Publisher: “I’ve spoken to our critic,
who tells me he tries to give fair notices.” Manager :
“Oh, fair notices be —— ! You must say my show is
the best on earth.” We’ve all met him.
Spagnoletti: Met Malld in Melbourne, on his arrival last
year, in a serviceable ulster and wideawake, sucking a
nicely-coloured meerschaum. Met him t’other day in a
landau, behind a spanking pair of high-steppers, and he
smoked a cigar— I know not of what etheriality, perhaps
18d., the kind that Dan says “they smokes in Hivven.”
Moral: Good biz. Theatrical gamut; Landau, brougham,
barouche, britzka, tilbury, Cobb's coach, pav6.
The pet seal at Melbourne Aquarium died last week,
and has gone where the alligator went.
Charles Warner has been playing his old part in “ It’s
Never Too Late to Mend,” at Drury Lane.
Flora Graupner has a little way of pretending to burst
out laughing at the whispered jests, or interpolated en-
dearments of her stage-lovers. It looks wondrous fresh
and natural until you have become used to it.
Johnny Toole to Paris correspondent of the London
D.T., on the subject of his travels, is very instructive
reading. Such trivial matters as bad business, or luke-
warm notices, were graciously overlooked in the J.L.T.
narrative, though he came out strong on the public recep-
tions, hospitality, floral tributes and vice-regal compli-
ments. “But to return to the Governors,” said the little
man, after making some presumably “ funny ” comments
on the fact that his name was printed in bigger type than
those of “the chief members of my loyal company who
shared these triumphs with me.” To return to the
Governors ! It recalls to mind the old yarn told of
Ducrot, who hadn’t patience to listen to the dialogue of
his hippodromioal dramas, but would say at rehearsal—
“ Let’s get to the ’osses.”
Melba sings at a State concert in London, June 24.
Says Ellen Terry of Mrs. Kean’s Hermione ;—“ Although
Hermione is a Greek, and classic ladies were not supposed
to wear a superfluity of raiment, Mrs. Kean used to be
always bunched out by layer upon layer of petticoats.”
The antithesis of Mrs. Potter.
According to a celebrated actor, a man may smile and
smile and be a Willard. “Indeed,” says the original
Cyrus Blenkarn, “ an habitual villain on the stage is, as
far as my experience goes, exactly the opposite off the
stage. Take, for example, Mr. 0. Smith, of the Adelphi
Theatre in London, a celebrated villain of the beetle-
browed and russet-booted and belted and buckled type.
Why, off the stage that man kept white mice and canary
birds, and was never known to say a harsh word to any-
body.” But then The Bulletin remembers that Peace, the
burglar, kept canaries—and what price Count Tosco, the
dainty bird-fancier of “The Woman in White,” as an
oleaginous and smooth-spoken villain?
The plush curtain of the London Lyceum was presented
to Irving by Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and cost 1000
guineas.
As Jennie Lee walked along George-street, Sydney, on®
day, a wretched hoodlum standing on the Post Office step B
howled out to her, “’Ere, missus, give us half’’—alluding
to a bag of grapes Jennie was just then carrying. To the
amazement of this miserable kid she turned towards him,
borrowed her companion’s penknife, severed half the
bunch and presented it to the youth, who did his best at
an apology for his rudeness.
Toole’s best Australasian wheeze was made on his reopen-
ing night in London. “Tell me, Maori, how to woo
thee 7”
Jubilee Juggins Benzon, who ran through £250,000 in
two years, and never wore a suit of clothes or a shirt
twice, now proposes to go on the stage. He should have
a good wardrobe.
Fred. Leslie’s mother, widow of a non.-com. named
Hobson, kept a store at Woolwich, and Fred, made his
debut at the local Soldiers’ Theatre, originally a church.
Sims Reeves’ father was a sergeant in the artillery band,
and also a Woolwicher.
Elsie Stanley Hall, the young Australian pianiste, gets
favourable notices from the London press. The little
daughter of Dr M‘Carthy, of Sydney, will, it is predicted
by English critics, be a marvellously clever violiniste.
Someone writes to a N.Z. weekly to say, apropos to a
local amateur Macbeth, who wore tweed trousers, that—
“ The Scandinavians assuredly wore trousers. In one of
the Sagas a man is mentioned as cutting a hole in the seat
of his trousers, putting his head through the opening,
and so wearing them as a cloak to protect him from the
cold.”
While the Dobson-Kennedy Company were playing
“ The Shaughraun ” at Foxton, in N.Z., a drunken man
took possession of the stage. Everyone seemed paralysed
till Kennedy, playing Conn., arose from his death-bed
and, discarding his Winding-sheet, threw the beery man
but with a loud splash into the mud slough locally desig-
nated a street. He then lapsed calmly into his death-
trance, and the wake went on.
Someone writes to S.M. Herald complaining that the
Australian gallery is noisier than that of Europe. Per-
haps ; but for noise, Catcalling, interjection, and idiotic
yelling it is an Eden compared to the gallery of London,
Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool, Dublin,
Edinburgh, or Glasgow. Ask any travelled pro.
The Dampier-Carver “Scout” is not an original idea.
At Manchester New Queen’s Theatre, a play called “On
the Frontier ” was lately running, in which all the prairie
business, down to the Custer massacre, was exemplified.
Granville introduced Regnier to Gladstone. The states-
man at once asked the actor whether he did not miss in
England “the impressive gesticulation which comes so
naturally to your countrymen ?” Regnier replied that on
the contrary he had been struck with the excessive
gesticulation of English actors. One of the first things
taught in the French Conservatoire is to be sparing of
all movements of the head and hands; indeed, learners
often had their hands tied to their sides.
Recent events remind us of an old scandal. An entre-
preneur stole away the heart of an actress from its tem-
Eorary holder, a composing conductor, who, in revenge,
olted with the manager’s prima donna. Then a certain
bashful, blushing journalist appeared on the scene, and
took the actress on tour on strength of the managerial
diamonds and furniture. All the dramatis personce are
now in Australia, bar the conductor and singer, but the
latter has hankerings after a professional visit.
Hearing of the N.S. Wales Dog Act, Sara only brought
two little poodles with her. Her big dog she left behind

Julia Marlowe, who may come to Australia, is highly
praised by Boston (U.S.) papers who describe her as the
legitimate successor of Adelaide Neilson. She was trained
by Prank Currier’s wife, now in Sydney. Stinson is

Someone recognising, like The Bulletin, the business
value of Barnum’s cadaver, has attempted to resurrect

Fred Norton is arranging dates for Miss Dargon’s
recitals at Newcastle, Bathurst, and Orange, thence to

The theatrical critics’ habit of bunching together on
first nights has been adversely commented on as a means
of destroying independent judgment, but what of the
critic who leaves his seat on premieres to go “behind”
and interview the manager and principal performers ?
Barry Sullivan died of kidney-disease and lingered for

London Hawk It is lucky for us that such men a®
Johnnie Toole occasionally visit our colonies. Were i®
not so our colonies would have a poor idea indeed 0*
Englishmen of ‘ education ’ in general and actors in par-

modern court fool, is particularly fine. Is it ironical ?
One of the Bernhardt Sydney reception committee said

“ Joe ” St. Clair takes Horace Chester, the monologuist,

Potter and Bellew are now playing in China, thence
they go to Japan, then return to Colombo en route for
England. Twinning, however, returns to Australia

Tragedian O’Connor thus recounts a recent experience
on tour in Pennsylvania The first night, sir, I was

a net.”

We don’t think Thb Bulletin par. which stated that
Chambers’ play had “ passed into the hands of B. and B.

on it.
Lord Clanoarty is dead, and Belle Bilton, the variety-
singer, wife of Dunlo, becomes Lady Glancarty. How the
Dowager-Duchess must hate that oat, the new Duchess !
It is cabled that Nellie Stewart refuses to play in “The
Nautch Girl ” at London Savoy, because the alteration of
title to “ The Rajah of Chutney Pore ” places the name-
part in the hands of Mrs. Rutland Barrington. Anything
harder to please than a musician it is impossible to
imagine.
It is said that George Lee has succeeded in placing
Charles Bradley’s “Gold Escort,” a play dealing with
goldfield life, an attack on an escort, the sticking-up of a
station, and introducing several murders, and a blacks’
corroboree, with a British manager.
Madame Bernhardt’s scenery is paper, done in Italy*
like Ristori’s scenery. Reminiscents are mistaken in say-
ing that Sara’s popularity dated from her death-scene as
Bertha de Savigny, in Octave Feuillet’s “Sphinx.”
Mdlle. Oroizette had the death-scene, as Blanche de
Chelles, a poisoning effect, where her face turned green.
She left the stage, through Bernhardt’s pre-eminence.
Musgrove has been negotiating with the Carl Rosa
Opera Co., of which the principals are Marie Roze and

Lord Dufferin is a great-grandson of Sheridan —not the
Widow O’Brien, but the “School for Scandal” gentleman.
One of the cable gentlemen saw fit to let us know that
the Mikado of Japan “deeply deplores ” the attack which
somebody (of doubtful identity) made upon the Czare-
witch. The real Mikado seems a weak, drivelling indi-
vidual in comparison with W. S. .Gilbert’s potentate.
He wouldn’t have deplored an attack upon anybody but
himself.
Charlie Arnold writes from England to say that the
“ missus ” presented him with a daughter on April 5.
It is said that Halle may remain in Australia to conduct
the Victorian Orchestra for one year. Folks say that
Australia does not appreciate good music, but lots of
good performers meet with scant patronage in Britain
nowadays.
In London Hawk, ’Gus Moore, while making some
awkward ante-matrimonial statements, proceeds to
attack Charles Charrington for having dared, at Bris-
bane, to “go in front of the curtain ” and read aloud
Acting-Governor Sir Arthur Palmer’s “ private letter ” of
refusal to visit “Camille” in company “with ladies.”
We should like to inform Mister Moore (whose objec-
tions to actors are the result of spleen arising from un-
successful theatrical management) that Palmer was
invited in his official capacity and refused in his official
capacity, and that his epistle was little more exempt
from disclosure and criticism than any of Moore’s spiteful
paragraphs. Moore ought to know Palmer. Kindred
souls !
A shilling edition is out of the Bancrofts’ Memoir, by
far the most inviting of all recent theatrical books, though
there are good ones by Jefferson, Coleman, &c.
The screen-scene, “School for Scandal,” has been
fruitful in incidents. When the Earl of Derby courted
Miss Farren, and she acted Lady Teazle, he used to go
round from the dress-circle, and talk with her behind the
screen, so that many a time a mischievous upset was
planned. Another lady, acting Lady Teazle, slipped from
behind the screen to the green-room, and was not on the
spot when Chas. Surface turned the screen over. Once,
when Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis played Lady Teazle, she was
found in a faint when the screen came down.
The women of a very smart London set have lately
taken to amateur stage-dancing. “At the recent Guards’
burlesque most of the dances were encored, and deservedly
so. When we state that the dancers were undeniably
lovely women, that their dresses were marvels of taste and
ingenuity, and all appeared to have acquired the profes-
sional rhomboidal pirouette with the leg in the air ”
“ Mort. Franklyn ”is given in N. Y. Clipper as manage r

Paul Bedford was at the post mortem on Edmund Kean,
and writes pathetically in his memoirs: “When I heard
the anatomical saw applied to the skull of the departed, I
listened, but looked not.”
Sims and Pettitt, Buchanan, and other dramatists have
been enlightening readers as to where they begin. All
fudge. They begin with the exclamation: “Ha! You

In re actors having only one character, a correspon-
dent writes to remark that although G. V. Brooke was
great in “Othello,” he could have travelled all his life on
Felix O’Callaghan, in “ His Last Legs.”
On Shakespeare’s birthday anniversary night he was

Williamson and Garner have “ La Oigale ” ready to put
on. This opera may delight Sydney and Melbourne more
than anything heard for a long time.
In Pinero’s new “ Lady Bountiful” there is a remark-
ably clever suggestion of a scene not displayed. It is the
ante-chamber of a fashionable ladies’ riding-school, from
whence you hear the thud of the ’orses’ ’oofs on the tan,
the tinkle of stirrups, and clank of bits, in the most
natural way, but the best suggestion ever staged was the
roar of the advancing mob, in Ristori’s “Marie Antoinette.”
When young Dumas handed the MSS. of “ Camille ” to
his father, the old man was so delighted that he wept.
Camille (Marguerite Gauthier) was a real person, and
herein is the subtle power of the drama—in one way
perhaps more fresh and vivid on the stage than any
other 40 years old.
Mrs. Langtry, in her latest character, wears a string of
black pearls round her lovely white throat. Wouldn’t
this go down in Australia: “The necklace worn by the
celebrated Society beauty in the third act, is composed of
black pearls, warranted gennine. Seats may be booked a
month in advance.”

The first lady graduate (8.A., aged 26) of a
certain Australian University, will, we are told,
on 29th inst. be married at St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
Melbourne, by special license, to ari eighty-year-
old masher of Sydney. He writes verses and she
writes verses —and there you are! It is under-
stood that the bride-expectant will get a substan-
tial settlement.
In the welcome extended to Lady Jersey
by the headmaster and scholars of St. Ignatius’

At the inauguration of the Quarter Sessions
Court, at Newcastle, N.S.W., Judge Backhouse

this a prognostic of the further “ emancipation of

Valentine Baker.
James Swan, M.L.C., of Queensland, died
the other day on board the steamer Jelunga, in
the Mediterranean Sea, while en voyage to Eng-
land. He was 80 years old. He came out to
Sydney, in 1837, as a printer, at the instance of
Dr. Lang. In ’46 he joined Brisbane Courier,
which he presently purchased, remaining its sole
proprietor till ’59, and fervently following Dr.
Lang’s patriotic lead in the anti-transportation
movement, besides championing the cause of
Moreton Bay separation and the autonomous
government of Queensland. He was three times
Mayor of Brisbane and had been a nominee legis-
lator for thirteen years.
The leaders of the various Australian
Governments have decided to discard the title
“Premier” and adopt the more Parkesianly
grandiloquent term “Prime Minister.” Asa
matter of strict Parliamentary nomenclature,
there is no such term as “Premier” known to
English State papers, as Sir Samuel Griffith once
laboriously pointed out to the Queensland Parlia-
ment, and many would not be surprised to learn
that the change is due largely to Sam’s finical
fastidiousness. By common usage, the word
“Premier” has acquired an Australian signifi-
cance not easy to rub out; so “ Premier ”it will,
The Bulletin predicts, always be. Short and
un-pompous.
The prospectus of the Sydney Deposit
Bank, whose director is Mr. T. S. Richardson, lies
before us. This institution has introduced a
novelty for public use in the shape of deposit-
notes, which can be purchased by anyone without
giving name or address, while translerrable with-
out endorsement, therefore can be paid away dr
given as security, while bearing interest at a high
rate during the time of currency. These notes are
issued from £lO upwards for any term at the fol-
lowing rates : 12 months, 7 per cent. ; 6 months, 6

That Queen Victoria should desire to con-
fer with Sir George Grey, and that Zealandia*s
G.O.M. should resolve to visit England at her
call, does not surprise those who are aware of the
confidential and almost affectionate relations that
have long existed between the Conservative
Sovereign and the Democratic statesman. For
over a score of years the Queen has treated Grey
as if he was a Privy Councillor, sending him holo-
graph letters and telegrams, asking his advice on
affairs of State, and confiding to him her private
opinions regarding many important matters.
These documents are in the hands of a third
person, but will not, of course, be published
until the Queen and the present generation of
politicians shall have passed away, when they will
no doubt form interesting reading. The Auckland
Observer (edited, by the way, by the poet Kelly,
who, in addition to writing a panegyric on Grey,
took the palm for a poem on the Queen’s Jubilee,
opines that the Queen’s object in calling the Great
Pro-Consul to London is to elevate him to the
Peerage. That may be so. The offer of a seat in
the House of Lords will be a severe trial of Grey’s
Democratic principles. But perhaps Victoria
only wants to ask him if he will be the first
Governor-General of Federated Australia. What
a lark that would be!
The facts in the sensational nullity-of 7
marriage case, Tyson v. Tyson (or Logan), just
heard in Sydney before Judge Windeyer : James
Tyson the younger (a nephew of Millionaire
Jimmy) was married at St. Stephen’s (C. of E,),
Richmond River, in ’Bl, to Harriet Logan, whom
he believed to be a widow ; subsequently he dis-
covered that Logan, the husband, did not die till
’B5, so that his marriage was invalid. Thus far,
the allegations were not disputed on either side,
In November, ’B6, the pair attended the R.C.
church at Hay, N.S.W., and underwent some
ceremony celebrated by the Rev. Father Kiley.
Tyson declared that this ceremony was a harmless
bit of mummery (in Latin) performed to please
Harriet, who feared she was near death, and
wanted to get “the blessing of the Church”
on their former Protestant marriage. Harriet
and Father Kiley, on the other hand, swore
positively that “ the regular marriage ceremony ”
(in English) of the R.C. Church was celebrated
on that occasion, and with Tyson’s full knowledge
and consent, after he had voluntarily consented to
and had been administered “conditional baptism
and conditional absolution.” Father Kiley further
asserted that nuns were present in an adjacent
oratory behind a lattice, and Harriet said she
heard the nuns joining in the marriage-service
responses. Father Kiley, however, made the
strange and startling admission that he got no
declaration in writing from Tyson, and that,
during his 17 years of priesthood, he had taken
declarations from all other parties he had married.
A spice of piquancy was added to the case by
accusations made by Harriet against James of his
intimacy with a governess, but these allegations
were emphatically denied both by James and the
governess. At the time of writing, judgment is
reserved.

A ROUNDABOUT REVIEW.
How vain a creature is Man, even under
the most favourable conditions for being humble !
I low much vainer when he is a Poet —a Maker !
. . . On the day that Henry Kendall was
buried at Waverley by the sea a certain disciple
of his, to whom the deceased singer was popularly
supposed to have left his mantle, met a minor
bard, and, grasping him earnestly by the hand,
said, in elegiac tones, “Alas! poor Kendall is
gone ! There’s only you and me left now !” Left
10 write poetry, he meant. No greater mistake
was ever made by any waker of the living lyre.
Poets are as plentiful as rabbits in Australia at the
present date of writing. That eminent political
chiffonier, Douglas Brooke Wheelton Sladen, says
in the preface to his last volume of collections,
that he is personally acquainted with the works
of over two hundred (200) Australian poets ! The
idea is almost too gigantic to be grasped by the
ordinary mind, but Mr. Sladen makes light of it.
“ Only two-hundred poets in all Australia !” he
seems to say, “too bad!” And he calls for
more !
# # *
Of course there are more than two hun-
dred. At the right season of the year you will
find—figuratively speaking—a poet under every
wattle tree weeping, because somebody (it
doesn’t matter who so Aug as he is dead) beneath
its golden bloom is calmly sleeping. Most poets,
indeed, take a gloomy view of life, which is
perhaps natural under the circumstances. Besides,
it is easier to write lugubriously then to write
tightly. Almost anybody can bo maudlin. And
then the rhymes come so readily and are so sug-
gestive—weep, sleep, grave so deep, worms that
creep, and so forth. The dismal little poems in
y. Inch these bards do most delight generally appear
in the quiet corners of country newspapers (re-
minding one of the dank little graves, overgrown
with sodden flowers, one sometimes sees in the
corners of old cemeteries) when the patent-medi-
cine advertisement, which has not brought in any
money for years, is too large or too small to fill the
space left open by a temporary stagnation in
police-court business. They harm nobody, and,
once published, are never afterwards heard of, until
some defiler of graves, like the aforesaid Sladen,
with unhallowed shovel digs them up and inde-
cently exposes them to the world.
=5- : # s*.
Yet, if by these means the world is made
to realise that there is such a thing as an Austra-
lian literature in process of growth, and to become
enthusiastic over the discovery, who will blame
Mr. Sladen and his kind for their conduct ? No
member of the Australian Natives’ Association, at
any rate, we should hope. For it is a fact that
there is a demand for Australian literature in
London just now, and the present writer is
acquainted with two or three ambitious young
men who are working night and day with a" view
t 3 supptying that demand as soon as they can
make arrangements to travel as ocean-steamer
stewards’ assistants and interview the heads of
the great publishing firms as man to man. But,
then, young men are all writers of stories—mere
Australian Eudyard Kiplings. Since Mr. Francis
Adams went to London no poet from Australia
has arrived there in bodily substance, as far as we
know—unless he travelled incognito, which is an
unnatural supposition. This is a pity, because the
others, the story-writers, being to a man sordid
grubbers for coin—a reproach which, for obvious
reasons, can never be made against the poets —are
no great credit to Australia, however successful
they may turn out to be. They have their reward.
They grow rich and “rest on their oars at San
Eemo,”as Grant Allen said (in the AEGUS)Fergus
Hume —the author of that jerry-built narrative
of the MurderAVill-Out Series, “The Mystery of
a Hansom Cab ” —was doing when the last mail
left Europe. But the poets have their reward,
too. It is in the consciousness that they have, of
their,own free will, chosen the nobler part. What
is Coin compared with Immortality? Nothing—
to a poet. They also have their peculiar pleasures.
How delightful, for instance, it must be to a
Bard, when a friend or two are'- spending the
evening with him and the talk turns, as it always
does on such occasions, to high, intellectual
themes to be able to say—rising and placing his
finger on a thin, chastely-bound book standing
between Shakespeare and Tennyson in his book-
case —“I think the idea you refer to is rather
delicately expressed in a short poem I dashed off
when I was sick that time ; It is here in my last
volume. I will send it to you !” But how much
more delightful, when the Bard is young, and
before his hair has begun to fall out, to be able to
pour his honeyed rhymes into the delicately-
freckled ears of the Beloved while she urgeth him
t > continue even as did the maiden in Gifted
Hopkins’ poem—
“ 0 poet, read !—read all thy wondrous scroll!
Vea, read the verse that maketh glad to hear !”
Then I began and read two sweet, brief hours,
And she forgot all love save only mine !
* * ‘ #
Two volumes of verse are now lying on the
table in front of us—one in dead-blue binding with
the title in gilt-lettering ; the other in lavender-
grey with gilt title; both published in London.
Let ns begin with the dead-bine book. The
author, Mr. George Essex Evans, calls it “The
Eepentanoe of Magdalene Despar and other
I’oems.” We have conscientiously read it through
from end to end, under the impression that such
an elegant casket must surely contain some jewels
cf value. We found some, but they were gems,
for the most part, that had been taken out of their
original settings and remounted in an inferior
stylo of art. As thus :
Ah ! I doubt not that hereafter we shall pass from change
to change,
All the spirit growing finer, all the thought with wider
range.
T 1 iis is how the idea appears in “Locksley
Hall”:-
And, I doubt not, through the ages an increasing purpose
runs,
And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of
the suns.
Curious similarity in the metre, too. But to do
Mr. Evans justice, he expands and spiritualises
the idea he borrows from Tennyson. Again
And what is life, and what is man,
Without that freshness of the heart
Which once was ours, but never can
Return when youth and faith depart ?
Times give us much, but who will say—
Js much as all it takes away.
—Evans.
There’s not a joy the Earth can give like that it takes
away
When the glow of early youth is lost in feeling’s dull
decay.
Byron.
Evans fills more space, but we think it
will be admitted that Byron puts the thought
more pointedly. Probably he spoke from large
knowledge of the subject. Besides, he spoke first.
Another instance. Mr. Evans, in a short poem
entitled “Sailing,” says :
When you raised your voice to sing
In a key so strong and true,
E’en the sea-birds on the wing
Seemed to pause and list to you.
This is a charming fancy. Longfellow set it some-
what differently. After telling how the noble
Count Arnaldos saw a fair and stately galley sail-
ing inward to the land, the elder poet said :
And he heard the ancient helmsman
Sing a song so wild and clear
That the sailing sea-bird slowly
Paused upon the mast to hear.
There are many more curious coincidences of this
kind scattered through the volume, but these will
suffice to show that Mr. Evans has been a diligent
student of the poetry of the present century at
any rate. His book is indeed, to a large extent,
a book of echoes.
APPLYING THE ADJECTIVE.
S.M.: “What is your occupation ? ”
TOUGH ’UN ; “I’m a labourer, yer washup.”
S.M.: “I see; one of the hard labourers, I presume? One month without the option.”
We resolved to see if we couldn’t find
some striking and original idea by closing the
volume suddenly and opening it at random. This
is what we found in a poem entitled “The Shep-
herd’s Last Sleep ” :
In the lonely bush in a far-off land,
Where the wattles bloom and the brigalows wave ;
Laid to his rest by a stranger’s hand,
The exile sleeps in his nameless grave.
Ah, yes, the deceased shepherd ! We know him
well: he is the King Charles’ head of Australian
poets. Their muse may be grave or gay, lively or
severe, but she never fails to bring her little post-
mortem tribute to the tomb of the departed herder
of sheep. At times the ludicrous fancy seizes us
that they are all weeping over the same
grave, and are all shareholders in the moulder-
ing remains below. But this is impossible.
The shepherd never lived ; he is only a property-
shepherd. Those poetic immortelles you arc
hanging on the wattle that droops over his alleged
burial-mound are simply elegiac exercises. The
shepherd whose pretended loss they mourn is as
unlike the shepherd of real life—who smokes,
chews, swears frightfully and has a fit of delirium
tremens every time he visits the township with a
cheque—as the latter is unlike a shepherd in
Dresden China.
* * *
Let us turn to the poem which gives a title
to the volume—“ Magdalene Despar.” The story
told in this is tragic, but somewhat silly. Mag-
dalene marries an old man, and, after due con-
sideration, deceives him (as is generally the case
under such circumstances). He discovers this
(which is not invariably the case) and, crazy with
grief, enlists in the Soudan Contingent- as well
as we can make out—and is, very properly, killed
off early in the campaign. His friends, however,
are comforted by learning that
His shroud was the flag ho defended
His bier was a mound of the slain !
A sentiment of the shambles ! We can imagine
the afflicted hero of a poem getting some conso-
lation out of cutting his own throat, but for the
life of us we can’t understand what solace he can
find in cutting the throats of black strangers.
And, anyhow, if facts count for anything, the
contingent confined itself exclusively to cutting
the throats of goats and the leading-strings of
However, Magdalene, as soon as she hears that
her husband is dead, walks, if you please—very
deliberately into the sea till she gets out of her
depth and is drowned in due course. This is sup-
posed to be her repentance. The poem winds up
with the following lines :
Hut the night-breeze, blowing shoreward, bore a sound
o’er vale and hollow
“ Magdaleni ! Magdalen 6 !” ever calling from the sea,
And the trembling echo answered, “Onward! Onward;
I will follow
Wheresoe’er thy voice shall lead me till it lead at last to
Thee.”
The voice is the voice of her dead child, and it
leads her to suicide ! The moral is bad enough—
though we don’t mind that so much —but the art
is shocking. There is a suggestion of Brunton
Stephens’ “Convict Once” in “Magdalene
Despar,” which is unfortunate for the latter. The
contrast is as fatal to it as that with a strong
colour always is to a weak one.

Mr., Evans, as becomes his Welsh name,
is a warlike bard. His Muse is no serene and
graceful Greek maiden, but a wild-horse Val-
kyrie—a Chooser of the Slain. Gentler minstrels
may sing softly sweet in Lydian measures, but
for him there is no music to compare with the
clatter of half-a ton of old iron as it comes crash-
ing to the ground with a wicked knight inside it,
cloven to the chin by the battle-axe of the good
knight as he rides amok through the melee cracking
skulls like eggs, and making a bloody omelette of
his foes. Very fine, no doubt —these old, mediaeval
heavyweights were good men in their day and
way, but what the devil brings them into this
gallery ? It is with the flashing cheque-book a”" 1
not the flashing sword that the spurs of knight-
hood are Avon in these times. This by the way,
however. It was quite natural that a bard
breathing such a spirit of slaughter should have
written an ode on the departure of the Soudan
Contingent, and not surprising that the ode
should have been stuffed with fustian like the
following :
When furious and fast the battel runs,
Australia’s eyes will watch her soldier sons ;
When through the haze
Of battle-clouds the dusky hordes appear
Australia’s sons will hold her honour dear.
Should glory’s rays
Shine where the southern banners proudly wave,
Then not in vain her chivalry she gave !
Reads like grim irony now, doesn’t it? “Love’s
Conquest ” is a long allegorical poem, also full of
fighting, in which one of the champions comes
forward and says
My name is Love, they call me the Sublime.
The first idea that struck us on reading this line
was that the champion had made a mistake in
giving his name and should have said:—
My name is Burke, they call me the Sublime.
But this is not sober criticism. The last poem in
the volume is called “ The Sorrel Mare,” and is a
sorry imitation of Gordon’s “ Britomarte.” Here
are a few specimens the italics are ours :
But leading his comrades by half a field
Steadily onwards the gray horse stealed.
Like clockwork she galloped, like lightning flew.
Like clockwork! Poor! Why not “like one
o’clock ?”
But straight ahead looms a bullfinch fence,
Black and gaunt with a stiff oak rail;
He steadies the mare ; she knows his sense—
Why, this is the most spavined stuff we have read
for years. Mr. Evans’ Pegasus suffers too much
from string-halt and staggers to be taken out for a
ride after Adam Lindsey Gordon. If there were
a Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Poetic
Animals, he (Mr, Evans) would probably be
prosecuted for having made the attempt.
Mr. Evans is happier in dealing witli
purely Australian themes. Here is a very good
picture in verse :
The purple hills rise far behind,
Before me spreads the plain,
The tall grass shakes beneath the wind
Like surges on the main.
Thin mists have girt each low hill’s crest,
The hot sun swims in cloudless blue,
A mirage gathers in the West
And trembles into view ;
It gathers in the swimming haze,
A silver lake of dazzling sheen,
Its waves are bright with dancing light,
And tender tints of blue and green.
If there were more of this sort of work in the hun-
dred and fifty pages which make up Mr. Evans’
volume, it might be considered a welcome addition
to Australian poetry. But his style is as knobbly
and uneven as a sack of coals. The lines “to the
Author of ‘ Morna Lee ’ ” (whoever he or she may
be) might, with reservations, have been written of
his own verse :
a mystic song
Far-echoing thro’ the Halls of Thought
With weird vibrations that belong
To the Unsought.
And uncalled-for, we might add.
* * *
Now for the volume in lavender-grey. We
have here to deal with a lady. Mrs. James
Glenny Wilson, otherwise known in literature as
“Austral,” is the authoress of these “Themes
and Variations.” If she had called them “Dis-
tillations from well-known Poets ” the title would
have been more accurately descriptive of the con-
tents, which consist of verses that might have
been written by almost any person with poetic
feeling (a quality by no means uncommon) a good
knowledge of English poetry, and current thought,
a delicate ear, and an eye for the picturesque.
There are pretty gifts and accomplishments, but
it takes more than those to constitute the poet —
nascitur non 'fit. But Mrs. Wilson makes amends
for the want of candour in her title by the follow-
ing graceful and witty lines in her preface :
To you, chief poets of the elder times,
We have much to forgive ! For still, I fear
You have cribbed all the fairest of our rhymes
Ere yet we waked to see the sunrise clear.
The concluding lines are worthy of Hood in his
serious moments :
And yet it may be that we sometimes glean
In other’s fields, although unconsciously ;
We are sleep-walkers and our feet have been
We know not when, beneath our mother sky,
Light moves his step, who walks the waving rye !
The moon is large—the rustling harvest gleams,
Soft music stirs—wake not the fool of dreams !
Vet even this apology for unconscious plagiarism is
in itself a plagiarism which, if intentional, is a
rare piece of art. The idea appears in the second
introductory sonnet to Kendall’s “Leaves from
Australian Forests,” wherein the poet says
I would not do the lordly masters wrong, •
By filching fair words from the shining throng,
Whose music haunts me as the wind a tree"!
Lo ! when a stranger, in soft Syrian glooms
Shot through with sunset, treads the cedar delh
And hears the breezy ring of elfin bells
Far down by where the white-haired cataract booms,
He, faint with sweetness caught from forest spells,
Bears thence, unwitting, plunder of perfumes.
Mrs. Wilson has a delicate sympathy with
Nature in her calmer moods. These poems are
all of the Gentle Life. She has considered the
trees and the flowers how they grow, and is,
indeed, at her best when she is making little
water-colour sketches, in verse, of what the artists
call “good bits ”of scenery. As for example
A little house, o’erhung with flowers,
Where first the creamy primrose breaks,
Where roses tell the summer hours
With bursting buds and falling flakes.
A little garden, blossom-starred,
With jewelled fruit and honeyed bell,
With holly for its prickly guard,
And bee for humming sentinel.
A little stream that sings and frets,
And hurries onward to the main,
Who drinks of it, though worlds divide,
Will surely come and drink again.
This is dainty work, and seems to proceed n-
naturally from the pen of a lady as point-lace
from her needle. Here is something in a deeper
key :
The day was passing in a stillness deep,
When not the lightest air would lift its wing,
And Winter seemed to turn, in his white, dream-haunted
sleep,
Half-awakened by the coming steps of Spring.
A pallid sky, unwarmed by sunset’s glow,
Fold after fold of rippling cloud outspread,
And sent from the reddening west the lazy cry of the
crow
Seemed sinking into the stillness overhead.
And an inarticulate whisper far away
Rolled from the woods, and met the whispering main *
So strange it seems to me to live to-day,
1 cannot think it strange to live again.
We have all had this feeling at some time or other,
and an eerie unearthly feeling it is, too. Mrs,
Wilson heads the stanzas quoted “ A Hope.” A
faint hope, indeed, yet better than none at all.
Here are some fine lines on “ Miracles ” :
Half of our nature lies beneath the deep ;
And sometimes, as we measure out the fields,
There comes a murmur from the rooted hills.
A tremor shakes our island to its heart,
And strikes us dumb ; and all the flowery land
Looks strange ; and pale the autumnal-golden sun.
We know well the music of this metre, with its
falling cadences, and it has always seemed to us
that, as in the case of the Byronic stanza, it com-
pelled the writer who used it to follow in the foot-
steps, and think over again the thoughts of its
first great master, who has himself said in regard
to imitation that “ all can grow the flower
when all have got the seed. ” He might with more
accuracy have written “ all must grow the flower
when all have got the seed.” It is a very dangerous
thing to meddle with metres over which the
Masters of Song hold mortgages. Simple quatrains
or couplets are always safe because they are as old
as rhyme itself, and therefore the peculiar pro-
perty of no poet, however great. Talking of
imitations, what is to be thought of the following:

# # *
Mrs. Wilson is, to say truth, a delightful
imitator, whether unconsciously or otherwise.
What, for instance, could be more charming than
the following “Imitation of a Swedish Song ” :
When Winter drives her flood abroad
And fleeces all the vale,
We bar the door, it is so chill—
So chill in Aladale.
When Spring sails in her merchantmen,
Full-loaded to the rail
With flower and leaf, it is so green—
So green in Aladale.
When Summer builds a cloudy tower,
And corn is golden-pale,
We bind the harvest-sheaves with joy—
With joy in Aladale !
When Autumn rains our apples down
And sings a wild sea-tale,
Thou with the swallows must depart—
Far, far from Aladale !
This has all the qualities of a song, which
should be limpid as a running brook and, like a
b o ik, carry along its own time. We must draw
H a close quickly. Mrs. Wilson’s poems are
graceful, thoughtful, tender, but they produce in
us that most painful of mental sensations —the
try'ng to remember where one has seen something
similar before. One is not so affected by Mr.
Evans’ poems ; One remembers at once without
trying. Both writers have sampled largely the
wine of recent song ; but while Mrs. Wilson pre-
se-ves only the bouquet of the various brands,
Mr. Evans' keeps only flip lees. There is, how-
ever, with all his crudeness, smie hope of the
latter writing something worthy of being remem-
bered. lie must, however, first learn not to look
upon poetry as a business. Let him, when he
has a good idea, put it into rhyme, if he must,
but all ideas are not to be used in this way, though
no less a poet than Words worth has set the perni-
cious example of looking upon every incident of
life, however trivial, as poetry in the raw. _ We
can fancy a poet of this kind cross-examining
himself at night in something like the following
style—“ Have any subjects for poems been
suggested by the events of the day? Yes —The
Cutting off of the Gas : Mem.—Hymn : “ The
Light of Heaven is Free.” The Dead Cat in the
Right-of-way: Mem.—Elegy : “In Striped and
Spotted Beauty Dead.” And so on. We have
done now.

ment to the widow of John Sutherland, M.P.,
twenty-four hours before her death.
Colston, the Narbethong (Vic.) murderer,,
has been given a further chance to develop brain-
softening before his trial comes off. The doctors
say it is necessary to await symptoms.
Mr. Reginald Pell, the sporting Broken
Hill (N.S.W.) coroner, admits that the offices of
coroner and prize-fight referee won’t run in double
harness, and means to act accordingly.
Governors Loftus and Carington were
created Privy Councillors on accepting office in
N.S. Wales. Her Gracious appears somehow or
other to have overlooked Lord Jersey in this,
regard.
The Commercial Travellers’ Association
congratulated Parkes on his birthday. The bond
of union .between Parkes and the drummers
probably lies in their mutual fondness for virtuous
little stories.
“Pendragon” told “Augur,” of the Aus-
tralasian, that the London Rkeeree yielded
him (Sampson) nearly £lO,OOO a year. Success in
London is more easy than iu Australia —and look
at its rewards!
Frank Stockton was invited to dine by an
artful lady who had the ices served in the form of
a tiger and a lady. “Now, which?” she coolly
said. “ Both, if you please,” was the reply, and
the problem is still unsolved.
Sir Provo Wallis, Admiral, has just emu-
lated Montefiore and Chevreul, by turning his
101st year. He was a lieutenant on the Shannon
when she beat the Chesapeake, and took command
on Captain Broke’s disablement.
Politician Perkins, the Queensland Jonah,
has been visiting Charters Towers. How he got
there no one seems to know. He could not have
gone by ship, because there have been no recent
wrecks between Brisbane and Townsville.
Lady Hopetoun’s cousin, Lord Rossmore,
who has come out to have a look at the kawlinies
before he gets married, and all that sort of thing,
youknow, is presumably the son of a Rossmore
recently killed by a spill in the hunting-field.
When Dibbs was orating at Wagga during
last N.S.W. general election he was so accurately
nest-egged that he required a change of linen, but
could not find a shirt in town to fit him, except
from the back of the portly Dr. Morgan O’Connor.
Mr. George Cheeke, nephew of and former
Associate to his uncle. Judge Cheeke, has returned
to Sydney. Mr. Cheeke married one of the three
daughters of the late Mr. Win. Long. Sir James
Martin and W. B, Dailey respectively married the
other two.
Nicholas Heeney, who was murdered,
apparently with a tomahawk, the other day, on
Soldier’s Hill, Ballarat, Vic., by some unknown
assassin, was educated for the Church, but aban-
doned a religious vocation when the Australian
goldfields broke out. He had one fixed idea—viz.,
that his death would be by murder.
When Count de Morny died, his beautiful
Russian widow cut off her magnificent golden
tresses close to lier liGcid, cind put them in the
coffin, but they had grown a little when, three
years after, she married again, the Due de Sisos—
not scissors.
Bishop Gibney, head of the R.C. Church
in West Australia, who recently visited the local
gold-fields—and actually refused to take up a
collection I—is identical with the plucky priest who
attempted to rescue the Kellys from the burning
hut at Glenrowan years ago.
An autograph letter of Thackeray’s, re-
cently sold, reveals the queer fact that he once
dreamed of getting a billet as Assistant-Secretary
in the London G.P.O. Certainly, W. M. T.s
humble disciple, Anthony Trollope, was a G.P.O.
clerk, and picked up his best characters in the
office.
Sir Robert Fowler, on two occasions
London’s Lord Mayor, is dead. He is the man
with whom Judge Windeyer went to dine on two
evenings during the Mount Rennie trial. Syines
notes that it was Fowler who yelled out while
Bradlaugh was struggling with half-a-score of
policemen in the House of Commons ; “ Kick him
out!”
Terribly cruel were the circumstances
under which the Rev. S. Knight (Melb.) heard the
news of the death of his accomplished daughter,
Dr. Adela Knight, M.D., in Vienna, Just as he
was going to church, to preach, on Sunday even-
ing, came a telegram about her burial, without a
word of her death :—“ Shall I arrange grave-
stone ?”
The Duchess of Fife’s baby is to be
christened not Mary Ann Fife, or anything of
that sort, but Alexandra, after the Princess of
Wales. This is an interesting fact to cable oyer,
because we’ve been wondering for some time
whether baby would be named after its grand-
mother, or one of its aunts, or whether V.R. and I.
would order it to be simply numbered in the
Royal Family stud-book.
POLITICAL POINTS
To Freetraders in N.S.W. Federation
means Disintegration.
Munro, the Premier, brags of having voted
25 times at one Parliamentary election.
Premier Macdonald, of Canada, is like
his special political cause—dying or dead.
A strong attack will shortly be made in
the N.S.W. Parliament upon The Naval Tribute
Act.
John Burns : “ The day of strikes is oven
reform must be obtained by the seizure of Parha
mentary power.”
The S.A. Labour-party reckon on securing
an absolute majority in the local Legislature in the
very near future.
As far back as 1871, Jacob Bright’s motion
for female suffrage was only negatived by 220 to
157 in the House of Commons.
Premier Munro, of Victoria, owns a large
woollen-factory at Geelong, and wants Federation
with interc lonial freetrade very badly.
Crick, M.P. ; “I thought you never read
my remarks?” Old Man Parkes : “Sometimes
the police call my attention to remarks.”
Gl. H. Reid : “I cannot conceive of any
circumstances in which I could ever again be
found in the ranks of Parkes’ supporters.
A SIGN OF THE TIMES.
(Midnight.)
CONSTABLE: “What d’ye doin’ here?”
UNEMPLOYED : “Lookin’ for a job.”
CONSTABLE : “What, at this time of night?”
UNEMPLOYED: “Yes. I found out at the noosepaper printin’ rooms they wants a man
here, and if I ain’t here as soon as the door opens I lose my chance.”
CONSTABLE: “And what’s them other fellers doin here !
UNEMPLOYED: “I suppose they’re all on the same lay.”
At the “sedition” trial of “bread or

The fans et orujo of the N.S.W. political
crisis is, that Parkes has in his present Cabinet
one or two strong men whom he cannot bounce.
The population of South Australia i s
reckoned at 313,000 by the Census Department-
This means a falling off of 7000 since the census

Sir John Downer, so rumour says, is to be
the new S.A. Opposition leader. Kingston how-
ever, will probably succeed Playford- as leader of
a coalition.
The Belfast Tories have passed a vote of
confidence in their absent member—De Cobain,
The inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah never
fell so low as that.
It b anticipated that by July there wHI
not be a red cent of loan-money in the N.S.W.
Treasury. Hus, of course, will mean the stoppage
of all public works. _
Liebknecht, leaderof the German socialists,
alluding to the pacific demonstrations of May Ist,
says, “ no more barricades : we shall not play the
game of the bourgeoisie.”
M’Elhone has ahnexed Champion’s phrase
and altered the brands : “ The unionists form an
army of lions led by scoundrels, influenced by
pecuniary motives alone.”
The Colonial Secretary of West Australia
is the agent of an Insurance Co. His brother-in-
law is Director of Public Works — which include
buildings, bridges, jetties, &c.
Let us be thankful to a wrathful “Loyalist,”
was “ like a funeral march ”-so he writes to the
leading journal
The Playford Government threatens a
Bill for next session to shorten the term of mem-
bership of S. A. Legislative Council from nine to
six years. The property qualification will pro-
bably be abolished.
The People, a Perth (W. A.) paper, flies
as its own signal for Australia the historical
motto of Chief-Justice Lilley, of Queensland,
‘ Independence—peacefully achieved if it may be
—but Independence.”
N.S.W. Government “fears” that it will
be impossible to have the new electoral rolls ready
for the general election, and that the old rolls will
have to be resorted to —“ in which case a number
of persons will be disfranchised.”
Parkes says: — “Forget everything but
Federation.” The Bulletin says : horget
nothing, but specially remember that Federation
means eternal partnership. Before we sign let
ns all read and consider the deed.
Premier Munro’s pronouncement that
female suffrage might reasonably be commenced
by the enfranchisement of propertied women, is
the greatest proof that the working classes have
nothing to expect from the “ Liberals.'
A compact and determined squad of some
24 Assembly members intend, it is said, to stone-
wall the Commonwealth Bill in the approaching
session of Queensland Parliament. A dissolution
and general election are therefore early certainties,
Parkes is now anxious to give votes to
miners without fixed residences. Copeland, M.P.,
points out that when he (0.) in 1880 moved to enact
that very thing, Parkes objected, saying that
people who moved about were not entitled to
votes.
Dilke’s action in moving the resolution at
the meeting which publicly welcomed Secretary
Wilson, of the British Seamen’s Union, “ on his
release from an unjust imprisonment” is one of
the most significant political events of the last few
years.
The Wagga Pastoralists’ Union implores
the farmers to band together to resist the Shearers’
Union. Secretary Head, of the A.S.U., replies-
“Who was it that christened the farmers ‘cockies’
and classed the selector with rabbits and other
vermin ? ”
The Chinese must go—but not to come
back soon with their wives, as is proposed in the
“hard cases” recently brought before the Vic-
torian Minister of Customs. The vicious-bachelor
disease is less dangerous than the virtuous-mar-
riage cure.
The Toowoomba, Darling Downs, and
Ipswich “ bunches ” in the Queensland Parliament
seem determined to make an effort to oust the
coalition Griffith-MTlwraith Ministry during
next session. Some interesting splits will probably
occur in political parties.
Thus the Christchurch (H.Z.) Times :
The police, fortunately, are more level-headed than
.Incite Harding, who, if words mean anything, criticised
i hem severely for not massacreing men for “ hoohooing.’'
Strike or no strike, that Judge ought to be struck off the
Bench by unanimous vote of both Houses of the Legisla-
ture.
Victorian Ladies' Suffrage League snaps at
Munro’s offer to enfranchise propertied women
“as a stairt.” We cannot reiterate too damnably
in opposing this. To effectuate this scheme would
be to hand to Toorak and St. Kilda the control of
the ballot-box. And goodbye to the Education
Act!
Sir Henry Parkes ; “ The hon. gentleman
cannot learn how to behave himself, even though
he. receives £lOOO a year from the country.” The
O’Sullivan; “ I earn my wages; I’m not a 7G-year-
iniquity.” The Speaker corrects both delinquents
and the O’Sullivan explains that he only gets £7OO
a year.
Can it be true that the N.S.W. Govern-
ment has agreed to spend £3150 at least, in a book
now being got up for the greater honour and glory
of the members of the Federal Convention—that
is to say, for the greater honour and glory of
Parkes, whose portrait will, of course, have first
place ?
"Old Tecumseh.”
“He was in nothing an imitator.” So writes
President Harrison of one of the greatest and one
of the most picturesque of the great characters
developed by the civil war. The peculiar feature
of General Sherman’s character was his piquant
originality. He was a thorough master of the
developed science of warfare, but he built the
solid structure of his enduring fame as a great
soldier upon a basis of entire originality. He did
his own thinking, and so completely at times was
he at variance with those about him that he was
thought to have an unbalanced mind. “ The man
is absolutely crazy,” proclaimed Murat Halsted,
in the early days of the war when Sherman was
manoeuvring in Kentucky ; but shortly after he
was put in command of a division, as General
Grant, whose almost unerring judgment of men
was marvellous, quickly recognised his great
abilities. From thence on he was Grant’s most
trusted and most valued lieutenant. “Sherman
saved Shiloh,” Grant said after the battle, and
then the people began to believe him a great
leader. It was some time before Grant could be
brought into line on Sherman’s projected move-
ment through the enemy’s lines. But at last he
came to agree with the brilliant strategist, and
from that moment never doubted the success of
the march, “ from Atlanta to the sea that
brightest star in Sherman’s crown of fame. The
men who strike out in new paths are not always
cranks—they are the world’s leaders and bene-
factors. People still say kidney disease is not
curable, because that is the old theory. But
there are thousands of men in this and other lands
who write as does Henry M’Namara, of Darling
Harbor, Sydney, N.S.W. “For five years I
was a great sufferer from disease of the kidneys,
•combined with intense pains and a constant heat
across the back and loins. I was under the care
of three doctors, who afforded •me little if any
relief, so that my health gradually declined, and
with an entire' aversion to physical exercise
became a complete invalid. My attention was
drawn to the efficacy of Warner’s safe cure.
With the use of nine bottles my painful symptoms
were entirely removed. Prior to taking it I was
for nearly six months confined to my bed. I have
since taken more of the medicine, and can certify
that it has restored me to health.”

When Bishop Barry was in Sydney he put
his name down for £5O on the contribution-list for
the N.S.W. Women’s College. In response to a
recent application for a cheque, however, he ex-
plained that his promise was only intended to be
conditional on his remaining in Australia, and
that there were so many calls, &0., &o. —in short,
his reverence not only wouldn’t pay, but managed
to make it appear a matter of high moral duty
that he shouldn’t pay. The dear departed Bishop,
on the strength of his promise, got a cheap £5O
worth of kudos, as his openhandedness was widely
advertised.
# * *
Judge Windeyer, of N.S.W. Supreme
Court, has been knighted, and so has his dear
friend, Julian Salomons, Q.C. Judge Windeyer
is admittedly a man of brains and is reckoned,
even by his enemies, the ablest Judge all round
on the N.S.W. bench; but—unless “British
justice ”be dyad —the Mount Rennie trial, if its
facts are officially known in England, should have
blotted out all chance of the head of the State
going out of her way to give to Mr. Windeyer any
special mark of favour. No Judge who had thus
conducted a trial could be knighted in a conn try
blessed by a democratic and independent press. It
is shrewdly suspected that Carington arranged the
knighthood, as also perhaps that of Mr. Salomons,
to whom he was more than effusively civil during
the perky Q.C.’s late visit to England. Anyhow,
Judge Windeyer’s knighthood will eminently suit
the Daringtonian book, as prima-facie it will be a
sort of mild vindication of the grossest act ever
done by any Governor reigning in the name of any
civilised Sovereign claiming to give equal justice
to all men, powerful and obscure alike.

Sara Bernhardt did delight the crowd of
2000 who welcomed her at Spencer-street. How
young, how girlish in her glee ! She sticks to
that little black cr£pe hat, with the yellow and
blue flowers, with a blue travelling-cloak. The
job carriages were astonishingly good—quite
Hopetouny.
# # #
Sara’s handicap is a colossal one—-playing
in French and charging in English.
« * ‘ #
Immediately after the Jaynil Dan O’Con-
nor’s Hibernian-French speech at the Bernhardt’s
first Sydney reception, the eminent actress with
most of her company took a hasty trip to Glades-
ville Lunatic Asylum. Comment would be cruel.
* # *
Grieving over Christie Murray’s clean-
shaven exit, a Melbourne weekly says; “The
descent of the author of ‘ A Model Father ’ and
‘Joseph’s Coat’ from a walk of literature in
which he excelled to simple and unadulterated
barn-storming is one of the most melancholy
spectacles furnished lately.” To affirm that
Murray excelled as a novelist is little less foolish
than to describe him as a barn-stormer on the
boards. It is equally certain that he possesses no
literary genius, and does display a good deal of
histrionic talent. As an actor he may yet become
more generally admired than his books have been.
Moreover, a man must live. Now The Bulletin
hears that Christie Murray’s literary income had
greatly fallen off for some time before he came out
here on his lecturing expedition. Which accounts
for him returning home in a new capacity, with
the hope of being able to utilise his dead self as a
stepping-stone to higher things, financially
speaking.
* * *
The vacant Melbourne Town-clerkship
brings out a shoal of candidates. Byron Moore
could get it, but has rather grown out of that sort
of thing, although he was terribly hit in the land
boom—they say he met a facer of £30,000.
City Treasurer Thompson ought to have a good
show, and a strong candidate is Miles, South Mel-
bourne’s Town Clerk.
* * #
Col. Tom Price, whose team of Mounted
Rifles appear to have been distinguishing them-
selves at the British military tournaments, has
done a little good in) his generation, by making
the Khakee uniform universal in the Victorian
Militia. The burlesque of the British lobster,
boiled, has gone, also the busby, with its shaving-
brush and bit of red flannel.

An American actress, arriving in Sydney
lately, drove up to a leading hotel and enquired
for apartments. “We don’t take in single women
here,” was the landlord’s answer. “We can’t all
be married,” returned the bright, little woman as
she turned to go. The landlord, who does not
admit unmarried women presumably because of
their supposed predilection to immorality, should
have more tact than to disclose his reason, more
and kindliness than to insult a woman
‘simply because she had no male protector.
* # #
The Tyson, junr. v. Tyson nullity of
marriage case will probably tend to further
emphasise the well-known views of Tyson, senior,
concerning the foolishness of matrimony and the
dangerousness of the fair sex.
Lady Parkes held a semi-regal “recep-
tion ” at Cooma, which was attended by “a large
number of ladies.” Cooma is obviously far ahead
of Sydney in social democracy.

“ The Queen has decided that the infant
daughter of the Duke of Fife shall take the rank

THE EMBEZZLEMENT BOOM.
DEPOSITOR: “Is the Teller in?”
MANAGER: “ No, he has gone away.”
DEPOSITOR: “Ah! gone for a rest, I presume?”
MANAGER (sadly): “N-o; I fancy it’s to avoid arrest! ”
Sister Gertrude, of Molokai fame, has
been married to her Doctor Lutz. Thus ends the
much and gushingly-advertised leper-romance.
The average woman who takes to nursing for
“pure philanthropy” has half-an-eye on the
sick and an eye and a-half on the young doctors.
The fact is that hospital nursing is in itself
hideously-disgusting work —its only really alluring
feature is the way in which it increases a woman’s
matrimonial chances. There now !

Modern Mr. Jackson, at a party : “ Now,
my dear, I want to go home.” Modern Mrs.
Jackson : “ Which home—mine or yours ?”

The Australian Women’s Christian Tem-
perance Convention has afforded some funny
developments. Lovely woman has very little
humour, and women who are intensely pious have
no humour at all, as piety, for the most part, con-
sists in inability to see a joke. It was resolved
“that the members of the convention write
Christian letters to barmaids,” and the president
of the Tasmanian Association, in writing “to
excuse her absence to-day,” stated that “she
could not come, as the Lord had just blessed her
with a pair of beautiful twins ” [i.c., four infants?).
Just imagine one of the possibilities of woman-
franchise and the near political future. The Pre-
mier (say old Parkes, or the virtuous bachelor
Gillies) rises in his place in Parliament : “I am
sorry to have to say that the Financial Statement,
which was to have been delivered to-night by my
(female) colleague, the honourable the Treasurer,
will have to be postponed for a couple of months,
as the Lord has just blessed her with a pair of
beautiful twins.” We can hear Parkes saying it,
in his pipey treble.
* # *
Judge Hodges fired off an effective petard
last week over what he called the twopenny-half-
penny Masonic case, in Melbourne, filling the
court time six days, merely because there_ was
money in it, to make barristers wag their jaws.
The Judge declared that no tribunal should over-
ride those of the nation—this apropos to a state-
ment that a Masonic Court had already dealt with
the case.
* * *
The race of Victorian Supreme Court
Judges and barristers-at-law appears to be de-
generating. Who ever dreamt of seeing Barry or
Stawell or old Moley weeping over a wrangle with
counsel? Or who would ever think of seeing old
Dick Ireland, Dawson, Aspinall, or Fellowes
crying in court? In the days gone by, when these
able counsel were before the Judges, they were
able to awe the Court. We remember once Judge
Barry mildly hinting to Ireland, Q.C., that he
“had a certain power,” when the Q.C. suddenly
thrust his “specs.” on to his forehead, and ex-
claimed : “ You have, have you ? Well, the sooner
you are deprived of that power the better.” And
in that case the Sheriff was not sent for, and
Barry did not “weep,” and Ireland did not “cry.”
# # #
Mrs. Jackson, of English abduction-noto-
riety, has been interviewed. There were a lot of
causes for her refusal to live with her husband.
He had a bad temper, and (for instance) asked her
when sitting down to dinner immediately after
their marriage, “Where are your aitches?”
Secondly, she married him thinking him indepen-
dent, vhereas he had no money and was so hard-
up that he actually asked her to pay his passage
back from New Zealand. ' Thirdly, she had a
sister and friends and he had a sister and friends.
If they had been friendless orphans they might
have got along very nicely together, as a woman
will forgive anything so long as she has not
another woman beside her to artfully work up her
wrath, which (to generalise boldly once more) is
woman’s pet occupation.

“ Please, ’M, I’ve come to give warning.”
“ What for, Sarah ?” “Please, ’M, I’m going to
be ina-a-ried. You remember giving me leave two
months ago to go to a funeral ? Well, I’m going
to ma-a-ry the corpse’s ’usband.”

MacPhillibeg came out to Now Zealand,
from the Hielands, as henchman to Sandy Snell,
an old hunks who for years prior to the acquire-
ment of a legacy, his marriage, and its rehabili-
tating influences, had herded with the Maoris
and worn only a gunny-bag as vesture, except on
feast-days, when he donned a potato-sack for
“ best.” Mac. was a second Donald Dinnie
(Donald in his prime was a pairfeck Haircules),
and his prowess as a wrestler and jumper and
weight-thrower fairly staggered the Maoris, no
mean authorities in athletics. They finally came
to the conclusion that he was a magician, and a
chief who had been forcibly induced to take a
back-seat in the arena since Mac.’s advent, at
length offered him two horses for the kilt in which,
he was convinced, lay the secret of Mac.’s invinci-
bility. Mac. quickly took advantage of the offer,
and the Maori as quickly discovered that the sped!
only acted while Mac. was inside the kilt. Mac.
is now one of the richest station-holders in Maori-
land, and the foundations of his fortune were laid
by the horses for which ho swapped away his
national garb.
* * *
British army exams, are to be lowered
to the level of aristocratic intelligence, and
candidates will henceforth require nothing more
than “ a thoroughly well-grounded liberal educa-
tion as English gentlemen ” to pull them
through. This elastic clause is susceptible to any
amount of stretching. Even Lord Hopetoun, who
failed to cram himself to the necessary
pitch of efficiency, might easily have passed for a
soldier on the “gentleman’s education” ticket,
which abolishes the necessity for a lot of absurd
study, and throws Her Majesty’s Army quite open
to the uppah classes again. Everybody knows how
a “swell” like the Duke of Portland is educated,
for instance. Didn’t his Grace observe, in a letter
to the Earl of Durham, that some noble sportsmen
were “ worser ” than the jockeys ? And didn’t the
Prince of Wales write to Lady Mordamjt when
she had the measles : “ You had better lay up for
a few days.”

London Savage Club did not come to grief
as our correspondent feared. The members rallied
round like men, and the club is now in a better
position than ever. Sir Somers Vine is now the

derful change in the place.

A man was picked up at Bondi (Sydney)
on Queen’s Birthday with a scalp wound, and was
taken to Prince Alfred Hospital, where he was
identified by a woman as her husband. Shortly
afterwards the authorities were informed that she
had made a mistake, and had found her rightful
partner, who had also fallen out of a tramcar.
How many women, we wonder, would be ready to
identify their husbands by the fact of their having
fallen out of trains on— hie ! —Queensh Birthday’;

Mrs. Grundy, in Melbourne, is screaming
for the instant execution of a certain woman,
without reflecting that it is a woman purely of
her own creation. This woman has a prodigious
advertisement of two convictions, and her business
is to render unobtrusive those healthy young
citizens who do not approach this world according
to the laws of Grundy.

Someone writes to say that one of the lady-
teachers in a big Sydney public-school allows her
best-behaved pupils, as a reward for good conduct,
to polish the said teacher’s boots. Another

mitting the “best girl in the class” to rub her
corns !

The fussy parsons have a new grievance in
Melbourne —those poor newsboys and newsgirls !
Now, let the most experienced police-reporter
run the drag-net over his memory, and see if he is
able to fish up anything like a list of newsboys or
newsgirls coming to crime—and then ask the re-
porter of nine days’experience if the clergyman’s
son has been up yet ? Ye fools and blind !

Reseigh Martin writes in a Sydney Sunday
paper that a beautiful superstition of his child-
hood —that no Jew ever went to gaol—has been
dissipated by his residence in Darlinghurst prison.
In January last, he states, the Rabbi had a
congregation of 28 within the walls. He says
that no offender is ever without the pale of the
active sympathies of the Synagogue, which is
mightier than all the churches put together ; that
the immured Hebrews enjoy two Sundays in every
week and a number of holy days ; that, whilst
R.C. and particular Anglican prisoners are com-
pelled to eat flesh food all the year round, the
J ews indulge in potted fi sh, &c., on every one of their
numerous festivals ; that they are allowed private
interviews with their woraenkind ; and are per-
mitted, on the Asiatic religious plea, to retain
their beards provided the same are intact at the
time of admisssion ; that their distinct preference
is towards bigamy and valueless cheques ; and
that they are generally to be found at work in the
gaol tailors’ shop.

A London paper says that at a recent party
at Mrs. Campbell-Praed’s “an Australian was
present who has a thousand pounds a day to
spend.” Yes, perhaps he has for a few days or
weeks at a stretch, but there is no Australian
living who has a thousand pounds a day to spend,
though we ourselves have occasionally lived (for a
few seconds) at the rate of £lOOO a day. And if
there does happen to be extant so wealthy an Aus-
tralian he may be depended upon to “ fist ” it very
carefully instead of throwing it about. The one
great lesson which every wealthy Australian learns
in England is that it is “good form” to be
mean. Lo:>k at that story about the mutton-
millionaire and the Marchioness of Salisbury.

Rev. Mark Guy Fflarse is, or was to un-
cork the XXX of Goshen to a half-crown
audience at Melbourne Town Hall, it being repre-
sented that the Evangelical upper crust has been
unable to hear him, because they cannot endure
being elbowed by the vulgar Evangelical crowd. For,
mind you, the Billocrats never mix with the Tillo-
crats, and in every chapel the strata of caste is
defined with Hindoo precision.
Ballarat Courier Clark gave such of the
children who sang at the Victorian Industrial
Exhibition a brand-new threepenny-piece. In
return they gave him “ three ringing cheers,” At

ADDRESS TO THE DUCHESS.
Interesting kid,
With your little face
Usually h d
In a cloud of lace ;
Ere your mottled hand
Feeding-bottle clutches,
Ere you understand
You’ve a future grand,
Site who rules the land
Dubbetli you a duchess.
Such is life,
Duchess Fife !
Babes of women born
Ashes are and dust.
Lesson laugh’d to scorn
By the uppah crust ;
Nature finished you
With artistic touches,
And your blood is blue.
O’er your cradle new
Cry a noble crew—
“ Here we have a duchess.”
ffufli is life,
Duchess Fife !
Many thousand brats
Pine away and die,
As on filthy mats
They are left to lie;
Mother on the booze,
Father still on crutches,
Ne’er a hope to lose
Have those infants, whose
Feet would fit the shoes
Of Her Grace the Duchess.
Such is life.
Duchess Fife!

Consumption v. “ Microbe
Killer.”
Radam’s Microbe Killer Co. Gentlemen,—l
wish to add my testimonial to the many others as
I have been suffering for the last twelve months
with lung disease. Have tried all medicines for
the lungs, but all failed to do me good, and I have
been with doctors for a long time; but I got
weaker every day, and my doctor told me my left
lung was no good to me, and that I should never
get any better. I got that weak I believed I could
not live long in such a state, but was recommended
to try your Microbe Killer, and ever since I have
been improving; in fact t the change is wonderful.
I have taken one jar and part of another, and I
begin to feel quite strong again. I believe a few
more jars will make a certain cure of me. 1
recommend it everywhere I go, as I know the
value of its use, and will be glad to give anyone
information who likes to see me, as I believe it
will cure all diseases ; not only that of the lungs,
but all if taken in time. I am yours truly,
Thomas Beeston, Frazer-street, Marnckville.

“The evil that men do lives after them.”
The late brewer Montgomerie, of Melbourne,
a year or two ago smuggled a diamond neck-
lace over the border from Sydney, was detected,
and had to pay a thumping cheque in duty to tne
Victorian Government. The facts were widely
advertised in the papers at the time, and now two
masked burglars turn up at 3 a.m. at Mrs. Mont-
gomerie’s residence with: “We want your diamond
necklace.” “Itis at the bank,” says the widow.
And so it was.* Thus she luckily got rid of them
for a paltry £5.
Two Forbes (N.S.W.) constables, who had
a “ clue” to some cheques stolen with the Trundal
mail-bags, were busy raking the bottom of a
lagoon when, sure enough, they fished out two
cheques. Surprise 1 One cheque was for £lOO in
favour of the senior constable, and the other tor
£5O in favour of the ordinary peeler, and to each
“ for his energy in raking out the lagoon. 1p9 1d ,:
The cheques were made payable at the (mytnica )
“ City Bank, Carcoar.” The energetic officers say
they want another “ clue ” badly.

Side-lights on Melbourne’s unemployed :
320 men, all young and stalwart and hard-up,
answered an advertisement the other day tor a
barman’s vacancy ; 23 applicants for a coachman a
billet presented themselves to an advertiser living
at Brighton, 15 miles from Melbourne before 7
o’clock in the morning on which the aclvt.
appeared in a Melbourne paper ; a boarding-house
keeper who advertised for an errand-boy received
a dozen applications from broken-down gentle-
men offering to do i 4 anything about the house for
board and lodging and whatever you choose to
give besides.”

This is how the medical board polished off
the case of the recently-hanged Johnston, of
Ballarat :
We, the medical practitioners appointed by the Chief
Secretary to inquire into the insanity of James Johnston, a
prisoner under sentence of death in the Ballarat gaoh do
hereby certify that we have inquired into such insanity,
and find that the said James Johnston is not insane.'
There may be a lot of Latin and Greek roots in
“DON’T KNOW TILL IT’S CHRISTENED.”
PARSON: “Well, May, is that the new baby?”
JUVENILE NURSE: “Yes, sir.”
PARSON: “Is it a boy or a girl?”
JUVENILE NURSE: “ Please, sir, we don’t know till it’s christened.”
that board, but its grammar isn t up to much, and
it is rather rough to hang anybody on the
responsibility of a board that can’t write plain,
common-sense in its own language. Apparent y
not one out of the whole gang observed that they
couldn’t “incmire into the insanity ” of a man who
had no insanity to be inquired into, any more than
they could inquire into the presence of a man who
was absent.

Lord Kintore thus profoundly expresses
his conclusions at the result of his expensive
Transcontinental trip : “No doubt much of the
land is good and much is bad.” The S.A. Go-
vernment will assuredly rise up and thank Kintore
(140 times for this remarkable and well-considered
opinion.

Kintore jumped at the chance to advertise
himself in connection with his “exploring trip.
He appeared at Adelaide railway-station in a

had travelled hundreds of miles by rad, where a
shave and clean clothes could have been obtanuK
a dozen times over. At the Birthday meeting a
few of the “ upper ” crowd in the grandstand
raised a feeble cheer, but the thousands on the

silence. # # *

Mr. Solomon Blay, aged 80, the old-
established family hangman of Hobart (Tas.), is
reported to have resigned “owing to old age ana
the general decline of his mental faculties. W e
used to imagine that a hangman could get along
without faculties, but possibly we were wrong—at
all events Mr. Blay is suffering from a species of
decadence in his think-tank, and is giving up
business in consequence. As a result of this un-
foreseen circumstance tenders will presently be
called for the purchase of an old and prosperous
hanging connection, doing a steady business and
capable of indefinite extension, together with
plant, fixtures, goodwill, and asphyxiating imple-
merits. The retiring proprietor will give every
assistance and encouragement to the new-comer,
and he pledges himself not to hang or otherwise
interfere with the business anywhere within the
province. It may be mentioned that during Mr.
Blay’s tenure of the business upwards of 200 cus-
tomers, have called upon him,, and they have all
been sent away—through a hole in the flooring
perfectly satisfied. The plant includes a com-
modious rope with a spacious air-hole at the end, a
large vacancy in the air to hold clients, a valuable
jerk which prevents the client g< ing away before
the transaction is completed, and a dull, sicken-
ing thud which has been favourably commented
on by the press on many occasions.

N.S.W. public-school English, Teacher
asks pupils to construct sentences showing use of
word “ mortal.” Sample of result ; “My mother
was mortal wild with me this morning !”
Recent years have developed such wonder-
ful discoveries in the fields of science, art, and
manufactures, that it seems almost strange that
nature is not completely superseded and every-
thing performed artificially. Where our fore-
fathers used the flint and steel we employ the
wax match, and instead of the old fashioned
lamps and candles we have gas and electric
lights. We have also replaced the old rumbling
stage coach with our railways and electric
trams. Generally speaking, so much progress
has not been made in the field of medicine,
very few really important discoveries (with one
notable exception) having been made ; disease
still treads its insidious course among the in-
habitants of this fair land. What is it, and
how does it get into the body ? Disease makes
its attack so gently and develops itself so
gradually, that many people never suspect its
deadly presence until a dangerous stage is
reached. They neglect the first signs, as a feel-
ing of weakness, dull eyes, fickle appetite,
pains in the sides, dark or muddy urine, con-
tinual tired feeling and restless and wakeful
nights, these symptoms only too plainly tell
the approach of some physical affliction ; bitterly
do people thus attacked rue their carelessness
and thoughtlessness in disregarding the early
and curable stages. A timely use of Clements
Tonic would have restored the health and vigour,
insured rest and rebuilt the physical and
nervous constitutions, and reinvigorated the
whole physical structure ; its price is so low
that a long course of it can be taken for less
money than one visit to a doctor will cost and
vou have a medicine which has proved its
virtues in hundreds of cases, whereas the
doctor's prescription is hap-hazard and experi-
mental. A gentleman who objects to have his
name published, writes; “ Castlereagh-street,
Sydney,—Dear Sir, —For some time past I have
been in the hands of the doctors, and can truth-
fully assert that 1 obtained not the slightest
benefit. I heard of Clements I’onic, and have
taken three bottles with such marked good
results as to cause me to write and congratulate
you on the very excellent virtues of your
remedy. It has completely cured me of all my
disorders, and I feel myself an entirely different
man. A friend of mine to whom I gave a
bottle, half of which he has taken, says he feels
wonderfully better in his general health, and,
with myself, begs to cordially thank you for
giving the public the benefit of your skill in
manufacturing such a splendid tonic. Ido not
wish my name used in print, but hope you are
very prosperous in the sale of your medicine, as
you justly deserve.” We must, however, give
one word of warning. Some unscrupulous
traders are only too anxious to force some vile
imitation of Clements Tonic upon an unsuspect-
ing purchaser. We consider the man who
practices such deceit and will trifle with the
sufferings of unfortunate men and women, to be
destitute of all honor and honesty, or as
Shakespeare puts it —
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
Incapable of pity, void and empty,
From every drachm of mercy.
Reader, take this lesson to heart, and read
those words to the swindler who tries to impose
upon you with a substitute, which he knows is
worthless, ask for and insist on Clements Tonic.

THE CHINESE QUESTION.
Ah Sin was held by people vers d
In all his Chinkee ways accurs’d
To be a thing polluted ;
And such as of his habits knew
Asreed in thinking he vyas to
This sunny land unsuited.
For, like the British lords and earls,
He set a snare for little girls
(With lollypops he baited);
And maidens, having tried a smoke,
Were apt to wish, when they awoke,
They’d never been created.
And when The Bulletin began
To drop upon the Chinaman,
So “patient” and so “civil,”
The dailies said he had to go
(As all who read the papers know),
Ah Sin was such a devil.
They scorned the very thought indeed
Of letting here the lepers breed
As thick as coals in coal-sacks ;
The Governments could not allow
Invasions by the cunning Chow,
On whom they put a poll-tax.
Ah Sin lay quiet for awhile;
We overlooked the heathen vile,
Who still among us tarried,
Until he called, the other day,
Upon a Government to say
He wanted to get married.
“ Him live a welly ploper life,_
Him go and fetch a ploper wile
And daughters—most pertikler ;
No Double when he come again ?”
(For morals, as was very p’ain,
This stranger was a stickler.)
The Law it scratched its addled head,
The “ Act ” was taken out and road -
’Twas nice for Sin to marry ;
But O, alas ! this was the thing—
No vessel had a right to bring
More Chows than it should carry !
'Twas hard he could not take the trip.
And then return, on any ship,
Aglow with wedded blisses- —
Accompanied by daughters nine,
As well as that old gal divine
Alleged to be his “ missis.”
The Law it shook its skinny hand
And begged of Sin to understand
With grief ’twould like to bellow ;
Then mentioned, in an undertone,
“Just let the ladies come alone,
Or, say in pairs, old fellow.”
Ah Sin he wears a smiling face.
He’ll soon have kindred at his place,
And annual babies chubby ;
And as his daughters (Jubilate !)
Shall each be big enough to mate,
Why each will get a hubby.
Right soon the Chows will swarm around,
On every street they will abound
As thick as coals in coal-sacks ;
’Twas bad enough to keep Ah Sin,
But when we let his women in
What use will be the Poll Tax?

Report of MR. H. TRENEAR (late Assayer
and Smelter at the Mount Morgan Company’s
Works), on the “ Rise and Shine ” Mine, Tooloom,
and immediately adjoining leases
Brisbane, February 17, 1891.
Having made a careful examination of the mine
called “J. Payne’s Gold Mine” (known as the
“Rise and Shine,” and owned by Payne and
Sons), I have much pleasure in handing you the
following notes on what I saw there, for your
consideration.
The Property is situated at Tooloom, Parish of
Clarence, County of Buller, N.S.W., one of the
earliest and richest Alluvial Border Fields ; 30
miles from Kiilarney Railway Station (Q.), about
30 miles from Fairfield, and consists of Gold
Leases No. 25, 44 and 45, area 1G acres.
The Lode runs about 10° S. of W. and N. of E.,
and underlays North 40° from the perpendicular.
In width it varies from two feet to a few inches,
but it will, I consider, average about a foot of
stone consisting of quartz, clay, felspar, red oxide
of iron, and decomposed rock associated with a
little arsenical iron pyrites and black clay-slate in
bands.
The gold occurs chiefly, as coarse flakey gold, in
nodules of quartz, iron oxide, : nd pink coloured
felspar on the hanging wall, some of this stone,
when broken, actually hanging together with the
precious metal.
I think I may safely say that payable gold js
found throughout the reef, but in places it is
abundant and at first sight would seem to indicate
a patchy character, but from what I saw I con-
sider that all the lode will have to bo treated.
The footwall is porphyry, hard and smooth and
regular ; the hanging-wall is serpentine, easy for
boring, and yet sufficiently compact to stand
without timber. About two-thirds of a green-
hide bag—weighing probably 70lbs. —of stone
broken from east end of bottom of shaft, lode one
foot thick, and dealt with in my presence, gave
loz. lOdwts. 22grs. of clean bright gold, and
another bag broken from the western end (also in
my presence, and two days later after a shot or
two had been fired) where the reef was from four
to six inches thick, a dish of which gave such a
quantity of beautiful coarse gold that we did not
consider it necessary to pan the lot.
Wo entered the mine by a vertical shaft 45ft.
deep. This shaft cuts the lode which has been
sunk on the underlay for a distance of about 140 ft.,
where the samples spoken of above .were broken.
From the bottota of the shaft (45ft.) to the south
(up-hill) the underlay shaft continues through to
grass, a distance of some 100 ft. ; but this part of
the workings is in bad condition, and it was
hardly safe to attempt to examine them. No
stoping except within a few feet of the surface
has been done, so that almost the whole of the
reef is available for breaking down at once, or so
fast as the present system of working will permit.
I may here mention that there is no battery or
machine on the field, and that the gold is ob-
tained by Payne and his sons washing the stone
and picking and dollying the specimens; by this
means they have Mint Account Sales for over
£l5OO for gold sold.
I estimate there are from 60 to 70 tons of stone
in the paddock, which, the owners say, will go
from soz. to Goz. per ton—some of it I could see
is very good, but probably 2oz. to the ton would
be a fair value.
Both of these, so essential to cheap and success-
ful mining are abundant, and close at hand. The
Tooloom River, with a never-failing supply, is
within 400 or 500 yards of the mine, and the ridges
are covered with the finest timber.
A dray-road from Kiilarney to the township
and neighbourhood runs within half a mile or so
of the property, and a small outlay would make a
wheel-track right into the mine.
The lode is not large but it is rich enough, at
the deepest point touched, to satisfy the most
exacting, neither could I notice any indication in
the strata or general surroundings that would lead
one to look for a speedy change, or anything that
would unfavourably affect the continuity or pro-
ductiveness of the lode. It (the lode) is rapidly
getting into deep ground, and the present bottom
of the underlay shaft must have a cover of 130 to
150 ft., perpendicular.
The surface of the country is broken and moun-
tainous-characteristic of England district—
but it is admirably suited for mining by tunnels,
and, in the event of anything being done at the
“ Rise and Shine,” a tunnel is the first considera-
tion for speedy and economical development.
After spending three days at the Mine, and
carefully examining the lode and its contents, I
have come to the conclusion that the property is a
valuable one and well worth the attention of
mining-men. It is not a big reef, but it is rich in
Prospectus.
gold, and when the present primitive, laborious,
and costly mode of working gives place to a better
gvstem of mining, and care and skill are exercised
in the reduction of the quartz, the Mine ought to
w l,andSOm ‘ 1) '- H. THEN E AR.
Addendum to my Report on the “ Rise and Shine
Mine, Tooloom, N.S. IV., dated hth February,
mi.
Holding as I do a very good opinion of the pro -
perty, and considering in the event of your buying
Payne’s mine—that a six-acre lease hardly afforded
scope for carrying on operations on a scale war-
ranted by the prospects of the reef, I measured
and pegged out on your behalf, two ten-acre
leases, one on each end of and adjoining Payne s
ground, thus securing a length of over 30 chains
on the line of reef with a width on the North
underlay, sufficient to protect the lode to a

MOST EXTRAORDINARY STATE-
. MENT.
A MODERN MIRACLE.
To the Editor of the Wellington (Salop)
Journal.
Dear Sir, —In your paper of October 20 I saw
the account of what 1 considered a most extra-
ordinary statement, wherein “ Mrs. Mary Ann
Foster, of 48, Greenfield-terrace, Gateshead, had
been cured of rheumatism in the limbs in 15
minutes by using St. Jacobs oil. - ’ Now, this
statement of itself seems incredible, but when the
article stated, further, that “for a long time her
legs had been so stiff that she could not sit up in
bed/’that “the ligamen's of her joints seem to
have grown together,” and that “ her case was
considered hopeless ” it seemed a miracle which 1
determined to investigate. I accordingly called
on Mrs. Foster for the purpose of learning the
truth. Judge of my surprise when that lady told
mo that every word was true. She said for
months previous to using the oil she had been
confined to her bed suffering the most excruciating
agony night and day, but that in 15 minutes after
the application she experienced relief from pain,
and in less thnn ci week she was up zincl about the
house —a well woman. Mrs. Foster says this n as
more than 12 months ago and she has not had
any return of the .disease. She is as well and
sti’ong as she ever was in her life, and (naturally)
recommends St. Jacobs oil to everybody—in fact,
is a living advertisement for St. Jacobs oil. 1
hand you these facts solely for the benefit of the
public, believing that a remedial agent possessing
such wonderful power to conquer pain and relieve
suffering should be made known everywhere. 1
am glad to see that your journal, as well as the
press generally, is taking up the matter, winch is
quite right.
I remain, yours respectfully,
THOMAS HUTCHKISS.

THE WATERBURY WATCHES have
derived their reputation of being
RELIABLE TIMEKEEPERS
from the myriads of grateful purchasers who have
satisfied themselves that they are fully up to the
standard of excellence claimed by the makers.
They are STRONG,
HANDSOME,
SERVICEABLE,
WELL-FINISHED WATCHES,
and far more reliable than half of the jewellcd-all
ovenpatent-half-cock-go-as-you-please-back-action
chronographs of the day. Genuine testimonials
as to their worth can be produced by the thou-
sand. , „ ...
Messrs. Thompson Bros,, storekeepers, Cordil-
lera,'N.S.W., write “ It gives us great pleasure
in stating that out of 100 watches sold by us, only
one has ever been returned, and this one was
afterwards proved to have had unusually rough
treatment. We can strongly recommend the
Waterbury as a cheap and honest watch.”
JohnC. Trelawnky, Esq., Maidenhead Station,
Tenter field, writes “ Having had a practical
acquaintance with your watches for nearly five
years, I beg to testify to their invariable accuracy
in recording time. The paucity of the English
language fails to furnish me with terms adequate
to express my high approval of them.”
Lieut. Wm. Waddilove, R.N.R., Commander
of the R.M.S. Iberia, says ; “ I beg to state that I
have carried with me for the past two years one
of your short-winding Waterbury Watches.' It
has proved a most reliable timekeeper, and I find
it most useful at sea, as moving its hands does not
seem to affect its accuracy”
A better proof of the known excellence of the
Waterbury Watches could not be wished for than
the fact that many unprincipled dealers attempt
to palm off on the unwary inferior imitations as
“as good as, or better than, the Waterbury. ’
Purchasers should note that no watch sold as a
Waterbury is genuine without it has the word
Waterbury printed in fine type upon its dial
face, and also the interlaced letters W.W. Co.
The genuine articles may be obtained from any
leading respectable dealer or storekeeper through-
out tlie colony. Prices : Series E, the old long-

“ A.A.K.”: Soil are a bad judge of a good
picture “11. E. Stephen”:- Yes, Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. .. “ Richard Wallace ” (fjroydon): Yes—address
Pit I-street, Sydney ; but the firm has lately been re-coi ’
rtiti te 1, and jjo longer, we believe, includes Mr. Gibbs.
“ Esorin ” ; You must never speak of any lady to her
face as a “ woman.” You must only ;ay woman in the
third person. In the second person it must always be
••lady”—“this lady.” That is the difference....‘-Jas.
WV’: See a qualified Melbourne doctor “ W. 0.0.” :As
there is no “ Garter ”, vacant, how can Sir George Grey
possibly “go home to be invested with it ?” “ W.S.” :
Under the circumstances, no importance can be attached
to the result of the Wellington election. The real contest
is ahead... “E.W.” (Melb); All the better if they are
here-on Friday—Monday at latest “ W.S.”: Yes, lie
was a good Chairman of Committees—one of the very
best men that ever filled the chair—when he didn’t over-
fill himself and fall out of the chair “ A.H.C.” (Eng.):
Thanks for letter and good advice. We observe that
whenever a man finds himself in England he commences
to write long letters to ids innocent and unoffending
Australian friends. We used to do it ourselves,
blit there is something in the Sydney atmosphere
which sits down heavily on protracted yarns.....
“ E. M. T.” : The periodical which slanders the Shearers
Union officials has a very limited circulation and to draw
attention to its lies would only advertise it. It is only
necessary to state the truth to Australians who have eyes
and ears: “The election of officers to vacancies in the
A.S.U. is conducted on a principle superior to that of
Parliamentary elections, and as near as possible to an
absolute plebiscite of members of the different branches.’
.... “Eight-Hours ” : If no member objects, another mem.
ber may move a motion that stands in the name of an
absent member ; though only one member objects, the
motion must be moved by the member who gave notice of it
“A. R.”(Townsville): You fo get that Brown’s small
majority of 151 over Ogden was largely due to plural-
voting. Where would Brown have been had the election
been on one-man-one-vote ?....“E. E.”: A man born in
Australia of a Chinese father is still a Chinaman within
the meaning of the restricting Act, and if he visits China
and wants to return to Australia, he must take passage
according to the regulations as to tonnage like a new-
comer “Walter Goodwin”: If you have (as you say
you have) given the P.M. (and sent Minister of Justice Gould
a copy of) that letter in which you say you “might just as
well go to Hell to look for ice as come to this Court for jus-
tice,” you have probably putyourfeetinitmoredeeplythan
ever. Either you are an intensely disagreeable individual,
or there is a widespread local conspiracy against you
Purves has been in Parliament, Hodges never
was “Wat. Tell”: Have written.. A.W.”: Accord-
ing to the law of England up to date, a wife may leave her
husband but he is bound to support her “Advanced
Democrat ” : Thanks ; we have a little constitution of our
own on hand “ Jas. M'Cormick”: The St. Lawrence
has its source in Lake Superior... “H.L.”: Don’t see
anything to gush about in the letter....-“ Wild Dog”:
Very pathetic little story, in its present form too rambling
for publication “ Robt. C., junr.” : Your verse sounds
like faint echoes of stronger strains. Here and there it is
very unrhymthie, and the meaningless repetition of
“ mystic ”is annoying. Never use words simply because
they look well “ Kikler” ; Received and returned.
Thanks “ Sylvander” : Old-fashioned sentiments lack-
ing old-time flavouring...“WalterF.M.”(N.Z.): Thanks...
“ S.P.” ; Your verse won’t scan, and is also illogical. What
do you mean by “ the glow of the shadowy blue-gum
trees?” or “cantering stride?” or “smoulderingclay?”
.... “ France ” : Not bad verse, but without new thought
and hysterical. “Blood-stained hands,” for instance, is
bosh.'. ..“Ruben Wild”: You are hypercritical, Ruben.
You can’t expect a story to have the arithmetical accuracy
of a statist’s report. Besides, anything may happen when
all hands are drunk “Strayaway”: Fair, but over-
gloomy yarn. “ Open letter ” well-written, but lacking in
purpose... “ Jas. Osborne ”; Scarcely suitable—“ The
L.8.W.”; Your verse, if re-written, might do, and it
needs curtailment. [Many replies held over.]

AYER’S PILES are unsurpassed as a
remedy for constipation, biliousness, sick-head-
ache, dyspepsia, jaundice, and the common
derangements of stomach, liver, and bowels.
They break up colds, mitigate fevers, relievo
gout, rheumatism, and neuralgia, cleanse the
system of malarial poison, and assist in the
formation of pure, rich blood. These well-
known pills are compounded of the essential
virtues of the best vegetable cathartics, and
contain neither calomel nor any other deleteri-
ous drug. They may, therefore, be adminis-
tered in all cases where a purgative is needed,
without fear of ill effects. Being sugar-coated,
they are pleasant to take, and their medicinal
strength is preserved for an indefinite period
and in any climate. They should be in every
domestic medicine chest and traveller’s satchel.

BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE,
IVIEDLOW (Blue Mountains).
This charming Estate has its Railway Platform almost
adjoining, and its level land proves it to be eminently
adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large—from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MEDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-
pnetor,

“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured

Bow’s Bteane’s wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take _
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take

Industrial Queensland.
Mb. R. E. Jaeman, whose portrait we give with
this issue, is undoubtedly the premier manufac-
turing saddler of Queensland. He not only
manufactures for the trade, but has extensive
re ail establishments in Brisbane, Townsville, and
Beaudesert (Q.). His factory is situated in Ade-
laide-street, Brisbane, almost at the rear of
his retail store in Queen-stieet. In the
manufacturing-room some novel labour-saving
machinery is in use, noticeably the sewing-
machine for binding together traces and other
heavy pieces of leather. All the motive power in
use is worked by electricity, which is found by
Mr. Jarman the most suitable for his purposes.
A glance over the workshop showed a multitude
of men and boys employed at various tasks. When
but 18 years of age (and still in his apprentice-
ship) Mr. Jarman was selected to manage a busi-
ness in Oooma, there his career as a successful
saddler may be said to have commenced. He
exhibited saddlery in Sydney in 1875, beating all
competitors. Since that time he has made Exhi-
bition goods a special feature of his trade, and can
now show 15 medals, a silver cup, and a large
number of diplomse, amounting in all to over 100
prizes. He exhibited with great success in Sydney
in 1879, Brisbane 1878, and also at Bombala,
Mackay, Maryborough, Townsville, Roma, Mel-
bourne, and at • the London, Indian, and
Colonial Exhibition. The saddle exhibited
MR. R. E. JARMAN.
in the atter instance (made by Mr. Jarman
personally) was presented to, and accepted
by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. This saddle is
spoken of as a remarkable piece of workmanship,
and it stamped the maker as a master of his art.
It may be mentioned that Mr. Jarman was for
some time in business in Wagga, Narandera and
Hay in conjunction with Mr. Robert Cassin, of
Wagga, but was, in his own words, “driven out
of the Murrutnbidgee country by the great
drought of 1878. ” He then settled in Queensland,
and notwithstanding his great perseverance and
energy, has suffered considerably from the wave
of commercial depression which lias swept over
Queensland for some time back. Nevertheless, he
has a great notion of Queensland as the premier
colony of Australia, and fully intends to proceed
with many improvements in connection with his
business. Mr. Jarman is a man of great industrial
resource, the very man for a young colony. In
addition to high-class goods for private use Mr.
Jarman caters largely for country and station use,
and his goods are admitted, for style and durability,
to be unequalled not only in Australia but through-
out the world.
Round the Shops and Shows.*
It is quite wonderful how a woman’s body
can seemingly be elongated or shortened according
to the fashion of the day. This feat is accom-
plished by altering the make of the corsets. For
instance, now that long bodies are in vogue, the
corset is made some inches longer than those of
last year; in fact, they are made to reach over the
hips. Messrs. Cecil Hordern and Co., of 486, 488,
and 490 George-street, have a splendid variety of
corsets in all the best makes, Thompson’s “ True-
fit ” being perhaps the most suitable for the pre-
sent fashion. The “Pearl ” ranks next in merit,
but as Messrs. Hordern and Co. have such a
splendid stock on hand, ladies cannot do better
than go and see for themselves.

Lord Byron never liked to see a woman
eat, but, then, Byron was altogether too affectedly
sensitive. At all events ladies of the present day
should be thankful that all men are not so
squeamish, otherwise Mr. Tollemache would have
opened the handsome ladies room at the City
Buffet in vain. Certainly it is crowded every day
with ladies and their cavaliers who have not been
slow in finding out where they can get the best
dinner in town from one shilling upward.

The Old Refrain.—A Song.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He stands upon the crowded deck,
She weeps upon the quay,
The good ship slowly swings her bows
Towards the darkening sea.
And as the cheers arise from those
Who ne'er may meet again,
Above them all, he seems to hear
Her sing the old refrain—
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Though the parting gives us pain,
Time shall prove our love the stronger
When we meet again.
She kneels before the altar-rails
A proud and happy bride ;
He lies beneath the Southern Gross,
Her letter by his side.
The noisy creek that ripples past
The home he toiled to gain,
No more will mingle with the voice
That sang the glad refrain
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Though the parting gives us pain,
Time shall prove our love the stronger
When me meet again.

Be careful, girl, I see the evil glitter
Gleam from his sensuous eye when you are here,
And oftentimes the wanton words and bitter
Drop from his lips when you are passing near ;
His voice and smile to thee are very pleasures,
Untutored in the world as thou hast been ;
What are to thee thy best and dearest treasures
Are counted by him nothing, girl, I ween.
I do not know thee, but thy face is kindly—
Like someone whom I knew in days “lang syne,"
And for her sake I would not let thee blindly
Be thus deceived, without a word of mine.
You know me not, 1 am to thee a stranger,
But stranger, still I am to thee a friend ;
I see where thou cannot thy very danger,
X see, what thou will not, what is the end.
I speak the word for her of whom I’ve spoken,
And tor thy sake to whom I speak to now,
That nought can mend the bruised reed and broken,
Nor life reclaim the dry and withered bough ;
Then, girl, retain the lustre of thy jewel,
And spurn his burning glances as thou ought;
Remember that his wanton face and cruel
Are worthy not one moment of thy thought.
Good-bye ; and ere good bye, am I forgiven
For having seen with plainer eyes than thine ?
’Twas for thy welfare, girl, that I have striven,
And for “ her sake” I knew in days “lang syne,”
We met but once, our meeting and our parting,
I saw one other tho’ when thou wert nigh,
And hard it was to quell the tears from starting,
And sadder memories smother. Girl! Good-bye.
Dubbo.

BIG Maequarie-street North, Sydney, June 3, 1891.
Mv Dear Moorabinda,—
The second phase of La Bernhardt beside the beautiful
harbour commenced with a reception dejeuner at her
hotel, followed by the mayoral reception in the Town
hall, when, “owing to a bungle in the issuing of the
invitation-cards ” (any occult reader can hear me winking
violently just here) one handful turned up when two
handfuls were expected. “La Marseillaise,” played by-
Mr. Sykes on the organ, and comprehensive food
arranged on tables prettily decked out with pink and
white camellias, were the trimmings of the reception,
which commenced at the wide-awake hour of 2.30 p.m.
to give Sara B. a chance to catch the Southern train.
The reception was just the same as any other crush of
like description. The enthusiasm of the French welcome,
however, was missing from the civic ceremonies, where
most of the women only glared hauntingly at the pifecede
resistance, and one cadaverous young lady of forty or so
sniffed scornfully to her companion, “ I don’t call her
beautiful; why, I could look as nice if I was painted an
inch deep all over like that.”
Then Sara B.’s wild and frantic attire made some of the
fretwork-frocked local divinities exchange “did you ever”
glances. She wore a gown of ivory silk, covered with
splashes of ink-blue, and otherwise glorified with dainty
lace; a Manola cloak in dark-blue, with high collar, and
a wide hat of gilt filagree and black gauze, trimmed with
black ostrich feathers ; over all, a long veil—almost to her
knees -of black spotted tulle. Beside this butterfly
fanciful figure, you may guess the mousey-coloured tweeds
and limp fawn hair of local loveliness looked more hope-
less than ever—nevertheless, some women managed to
stand out. The Mayoress wore her first-reception toilet
of lavender-grey, bordered in cream and flesh-pink flowers.
The festivities were over by half-past four o’clock.
Apropos— (everything is apropos of the Bernhardt just
now) a certain section of S} r dney alleged crime de la
crime— the very top skimming of the social dish, are
going to be extremely exclusive over the great tra-
gedienne, who, it seems, “ is not proper for US to know.’’
Several of them were invited to meet her on a recent
occasion, but the cards were snappishly declined, and some
person on asking a daughter of these socialqaokers if her
parent intended attending, was met by the ’orty rejoinder
“Do you think my mother would, go .to meet HER?”
puling the stress on exactly 7 as above. And this is very
interesting coming as it does from a set of women most
of whom have a manacled skeleton behind the arras—the
“handled” mother of the lady quoted having descended
directly from a beetle-browed gentleman--not a harmless
rabbit-poacher by any means—who left his country for
ills country's good.
It is indeed odd that any “society ” person should hide
her countenance from the first actress of the day after
such lavish recent patronage cf a fourth-rate article who
wasn’t even conspicuously exemplary, or pock-marked, or
suffering from any other physical disability that goes to
make a woman’s woman.
I was one of the few who rushed to the barriers, at
Redfern, to see the last, in a temporary sense, of Madame
Bernhardt, who, with one or two members of her com-
pany, left by “special” shortly after the express—the
rest of the troupe going by the earlier train. For the
journey “she” wore a blue, long cloak edged with blue
chenille over a warm gown of, tartan velvet,’ and was glee-
ful in her idiomatic praises of the arrangements the
station-master at Redfern had made for her Comfort ; but
the rest of the company looked dreadfully unhappy. By
the way, the men of the B. troupe are' mostly blase
middle-aged heroes over whom the throbbing hearts of
Toorak and Potts Point will not absolutely break—not in
the daylight, anyhow. Some of them are short and
hoarse and puffy, filling out their garments as a German-
sausage fills its bladder; the leading man-the Soarpia,
Armand, &c., of the party-is certainly rather an
advance on the rest, but even he wore shepherds’-plaid
trousers and looked homesick. The lady coadjutors are
more possible, and I don’t think their excessive lack of
English will interfere with their success amongst the
Australian gilded youth—one tall and radiant nymph with
henna-dyed hair and a big emerald ring upon her finger
being sure to do “Gaiety” business among the hupper
suckles.
The Jersey lev6e, on 26th ult., went off as usual, and if
one judges pedestrianism as a sign of hollow pockets, it
must be a sad truth that the possession of dress-clothes
doesn’t necessarily imply that they hold a cab-fare. To
see bevies of men perambulating up Bridge-street in
full war-paint at 2.30 p.m. is a very odd spectacle, and on
;he occasion of the last levCe I never before saw so many
“ gentlemen attending ” doing it on their own soles. Of
course there is no disgrace if a man walks from here to
Tophet if he likes, but when he is in a blazing shirt-front-
and assumes quite an Imperial air—then it is certainly
time for him to call a hansom. Some of them didn’t
seem to mind a bit, though, and after “ it” was all over I
met one well-known ex-legal magnate proudly doing
the block with his top-coat wide open over his laundried
buzzum.
The first trial of Band Wednesday in Sydney Botanic
Gardens was made on 27th ult., when the attendance was
microscopic and surprised-looking, and the devotees who
rioted on little camp-stools at threepence a time seemed
harassed by the fact that the grass wasn’t quite dr} 7
enough to be hygienic. Lady J. (with two of the little
Jerseys in tow) was present on the lawn awhile, but even
her magic presence couldn’t redeem the situation, which
fell hopelessly flat—the Bernhardt reception absorbing
most of the people who would have been there otherwise.
By the way, if Band Wednesdays are going to be
"fashionable,” thb band ought to see that its repertoire is
“ sich,” The music on the first occasion was simply tem-
per-trying.
Twenty-three Sydney bachelors paid off their scores (in
an anticipatory way, considering that the season is only
just shooting), by inviting a crowd of Sydney hostesses
and their daughters to a ball at “ Nithsdaje ” on 26th ult.
The rooms were gay with draperies of strawberry and
buttercup-coloured art muslin, palms, evergreens, etc.,
and the programmes were white and gold—the supper-
table groaned, and the novel “ oyster-room ” was simply
rushed. Vice-regality was there, attended by every
member of the “sweet,” Lad3' Jersey wearing geranium-
red duchesse, contrasted with white and gold embroidery,
diamond ornaments, and the rest of the dressing was
smart. White led, with pink and “yaller” as second
favourites, and it was remarked that never had local
belledom looked so charming as it did on this occasion,
under the subdued light of the yellow lamp-shades. But
what was the tun of looking lovely when you were in a
hopeless majority ? There were eighty-eight ladies and
only fifty-five dress-suits—“one woman and three-fifths
of one to every man,” as one of the many wall-flowers
mathematically put it. Consequently, nobody had the
chance to dance the soles off her satin slippers.
Referring to balls, it is said that the reason Lady J.
didn’t actively patronise a recent big hop was that she
understood that Lady X. had been sent a card and in-
tended attending, and some people are again saying that
Lady J. is too hostile altogether. But is she ? It is very
christianUke to say that Lady J. ought to be on calmer
terms with our ex-impropriety, but yet one cannot see
where she is to get her precedent from. Lady J. is the
chosen representative of a straight-laced old lady who
won’t allow a woman to enter her presence with whom
the breath of scandal has had anything to do, so it is hardly
likely that Lady Jersey is going to encourage people of
the X. brand to run tame about Government House ! More
especially as the fickle populace might an}' day relegate
her and her champion into the very utmost social
regions.
On 23th ult. Lady Jersey’s second daughter, Mary, was
fortunate enough to have a birthday, to signalise which a
children’s dance was held at Government House. Like
all children’s affairs it passed off most successfully, the
little hostess in cream surah and the small guests in their
gay-coloured party frocks enjoying every minute as only
children can. The cotillon, in which each child received
a gift, was a great success. Misses Innes, Lamb, and
Salomons were the “grown-ups” invited to amuse the
smaller guests.
At a time when you are desperately weary of the one
eternal argument always advanced in favour of Woman’s
Suffrage - that Parliament would be the synonym of
political purity under the immaculate influence of the
female vote-it is cynically interesting to read of the
“ unseemly conduct ” of a couple of women nominated as
probable members of the Women’s College Council
(elected on 30th ult.) who “ so far forgot their dignity and
that of the position they are seeking to attain as to con-
duct‘a personal canvass, and to secure from well-meaning
but foolish persons their proxies, then using them to
plump for themselves.”
Cowen’s “Rose Maiden” cantata, performed at the
Parramatta Town Hall, by the members of St. John’s
choir, assisted by Mrs. Massey, Miss -Sheridan Reed, Frank
Brewer (suffering from relaxed throat), Herr Pechotsch,
&c., was more an ornamental than a musical success—the
floral decorations by the choir-girls being really the most
artistic aspect of the show. The soprano (Mrs. Massey)
was in excellent voice, hut the orchestration was too
heavy for the soloists, and the general effect was like the
cry of a cricket in a quartz-crushing machine. Neverthe-
less the audience (a crowd) meted out indiscriminate and
rapturous applause.
1 have received from Madame Kellermann a copy of her
latest composition, a “ Tarantelle” in P. minor,dedicated
to Mrs. Sydney Burdekin. Nobody but a proficient
should attempt the “Tarantelle,” which has several diffi-
cult passages and must he pla} - ed at top speed with only
one diminuendo to get your instrumental breath on ; but
for those who can “clown on the ivories” it is a vivacious
airy composition sure to meet with a hearty reception
everywhere.
One of the most successful private single-handed affairs
(most of the hops now are on the trades-union plan) held
in Sydney this season was the “ Karooia” dance the other
Friday evening, when Mrs. Alfred Cape entertained her
friends in a most enjoyable manner. The hoste'ss wore a
Parisian-looking gown of electric-grey brocade contrasted
with pink and satin, and her troupe of guests aired then-
purple and fine linen. A special interest was lent the
rooms 1)\- the presence of one debutante —Miss Darley.
It may interest Wesleyans to know—in connection with
the recent camp-meetings on Sydney harbour, whereat
black male and female missionaries danced the voluptuous
dances of their nation and.wreathed their oily locks with
gum-leaves—that the said copper-coloured brudders and
sistahs are forbidden to indulge in high-kicking exercises
in their own islands under the careful eye of their par-
ticular Day. and Martin potentate who gives his cogent
(and unprintable) reasons in full on the sheet of bark that
constitutes the local statutes. But, of.course, the single-
minded Chadbands of civilisation can see no harm in it.
By the way, these happy natives were invited to tea by a
suburban millionaire Methodist, who gathered a swarm of
parsons and parsons’ wives to help their coloured bretheren
to enjoy themselves. .But one cleric’s good lady left the
festivities abruptl} - in a huff because one of those diead-
ful black women actually pulled up her stocking right in
front of Brother Blank.”
A Sydney suburban.medico tells a yarn (cn parenthese,
I rather distrust the genuineness of doctors’ original stories
—don’t you? - I think they lay them in with the red-lamp
and the lancet, and the rest of the.stock-in-tradelabout
his wife who was dangerously ill, and even “ given up.”
One evening her husband was smoothing.her pillow fat-
her when she suddenly opened her eyes and said faintly ;
“I don’t think I shall he much longer with you, George,
and I’ve been thinking that when I am gone you couldn’t
do better than marry Mrs. Dodson!” Quite a touching
instance of wifely self-sacrifice, Wasn’t It? Its usual
■effect is to make hubby perjure himself by vowing
never to let another woman usurp her place. But I
know one lady who fixed her glazy eye on- her lord and
master, and said in deep, sepulchral tones: “William,
you must never marry again. If you do, I’ll haunt you.”
Some of the stuffs they are • wearing now have
large lozenge-shaped dots all over them, and con-
sidering that—in heraldry—a lozenge means a very con-
siderable bar-sinster, it looks rather blushable to see the
society girl perambulating in a garment covered with
lozenges from collar to flounce. More so, since we are
told that it is the caper to wear one’s coat-of-arms broidered
■on one’s outer garments. Can there be a deep, dark,
family reason for this society outbreak of lozenge-spots ?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
On 29th ult. Mrs. Bland Holt gave a ladies’ luncheon
tparty at her hotel to a number of her friends. The table
■decorations—of violets, mignonette and maiden hair—
were very pretty. On 2nd inst. Mr. and Mrs. Bland Holt
left per express for Melbourne enroute for Adelaide.
On 11th inst. a ball in aid of the Nurses’ Home in con-
nection with Prilloe Alfred Hospital, of which Lady Car-
ington laid the foundation-stone, will be held in the
'Centennial Hall. As the local Sisters Dora have hardly
room to turn round in as things now are, it is hoped the
■attendance on the 18th will be gigantic.
Lady Jersey lias issued cards for the forthcoming June
evening “at homes ’ at Government House. ..Monday, Bth
inst., Tuesday, 16th inst, and Thursday, 18th inst, are the
magic fixtures.
On dit that the governess to the House of Jersey is
engaged to be married to a well-known Melbourne pro-
fessor. Mutual attraction set in aboard the P. and O.
boat on the voyage out.
Other interesting engagements are announced. Miss
“ Bee” Tully, granddaughter of Major Darvall, of Ryde,
Parramatta River, is the pledged bride of Mr. Frank
Goertz, of the Commercial Bank, Brisbane ; Miss Katie
Walsh, sister of Mrs. Dr. Huxtable, of Sydney (a daughter
of the late Flon. W. H. Walsh), is engaged to Mr. Riley,
of Brisbane ; and in Hobart Mr. C. Oldineadow, sou of Dr.
Dldmeadow, of Davey-street, is engaged to Miss Fanny
Bailey.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
On looking over the history of the past SO
Melbourne Cups we find that over 1000 horses have
sported silk for that great event. The V.11.C. has given
away in Cup-money alone £65,000. Out of 30 winners
three have been aged ; five, 6yrs. ; nine, syrs. ; six, 4yvs. ;•
seven, Syrs. In colour they have been—l 7 boy, 9
brown, 2 black, 1 grey and 1 chestnut. Four were geldings,
presumably ending their days as cab-horses. A marc, and
only one, ever got her nose in front at the post, and she
was a clinker. Victoria lays claim to 15 Cups ; N.5.W.,-
13; S. A., 1; Tasmania, 1. As yet none of the N.Z.
gentlemen have had the good luck to annex a
Cup, but it will happen some day. The yellovv-
and-black and all-black have each scored four in honour of
N.S.W, The largest field to face the flag was in Sheet
Anchor's year—3s against 7in Banker’s. Carbine left his
field behind him with a crusher of lOst. 51b. ; Banker did
the same with the feather sst. 91b. Tire double winner,
Archer, look 3min. 52sec. to get home ; last year’s great-
gun travelled the distance in Bmin. 28jsecs., hut in Archer’s
day the turf was not velvet as it is now. The lamb has
backed the favourite six times and got home ; 24 times ho
has lost his wool. Cults, Pigott, and O’Brien have had
the good fortune to steer the winner twice each. The
lowest amount run for was in 1863, when the race was
worth a little over £5OO ; the highest, £lo,ooo—for last
year's spin. The best horse to pass the post, without
doubt, was Carbine ; the worst, that miserable three-
legged brute, Zulu —and yet he was a near relation of the
once mighty Barb.

The greatest white elephant ever presented to
man or boy is the massive gold whip so kindly and regu-
larly given year after year by hotel-keeper Reynolds to
the winning mount of the Melbourne Cup. As a flagella-
tor it is useless, and no one expects the travelling jock, to
carry a safe about with him to carry the-toy in. Cannot
some kind friend knock it into Mr. R.’s head that a stop-
watch is the jockeys best friend ?

An ill-informed twaddler for Melbourne Herald
predicts that the Epsom Derby will “yield the palm to
one of the great handicaps, such as the City and
Suburban.” Rubbish ! The City and Sub. has been
declining a good deal faster than the Derby for some
years past. The Derby will always be a popular three-
year-old race, because it happens at the right time, when
all the racing “ swells” are in town and the form of the
horses has not been fairly exposed. For both reasons
it will always take precedence of the Leger.
# # *
Racing is likely to go ahead in South Australia
where the poor hacker gets a little encouragement to per-
severe. One winner, Syntax, at the A.R.C. meeting,
returned a totalisator div. of £72 per sovereign. There
were thirteen runners, and the “books” with their im-
pudent bawl of “H’any price outsiders!” wouldn’t lay
more than 10 to 1 Syntax. The machine will gradually
teach the Australians what an “outsider” means, a point
on which they and their Hebrew despoilers are quite
pathetically ignorant. In 1872 four horses started for the
Goodwood Cup —Favonius, Mortefner, Shannon and
another. The heavy wagering was all between the two
first-named horses, a shade of odds being laid on one
and a slightly lesser shade of odds against the other.
Against Shannon some of the ringmen offered 66 to 1 or
100 to 1, until they had booked a bet or two at the longer
price, and that real good mare won in a canter to the joy
of the layers. If Carbine, Marvel, Highborn, and The
Admiral were to engage in a two-mile race in England
at weight-for-age, the big ringmen would lay (if there were
anything of a market) at leastso-to 1 against either of the
two “ outsiders.” At Randwick or Fleming ton you might
get 7to 1 Highborn and 10 to 1 The Admiral. If yon ex-
postulated with the Children of Israel t hey would shriek
—“ Didnlt Highborn win the Sydney Cup, didn’t we see
The Admiral win the Derby—what'are yer givin’ us?”
Which wouldn’t be all bluff, either. The Jew bookmaker
is not necessarily a genius, and, so long as the public
remain hopeless idiots on the sub j yet of racing odds, he
needn’t cultivate the art of betting “ close to figures.”

The Referee last to hand, April 20, contains
the following, by “ Pen dragon,” to which a mournful in-

writer has since died “ Otherwise—and I will say it, in

The “Queen’s Birthday” meeting at Fleming-
ton was enlivened by a comedy in the paddock during
luncheon interval. The performers were the acting-
manager and trainer of a candidate for one of the forth-
coming events, and from as much as could bo heard of
the dialogue it appeared that they were “ all broke,” and
that if one didn’t let the other “ have a hundred of it”
the other would rush off and do something alarming. A
good deal of gory matter was introduced into the conver-
sation, and finally one of them made a hysterical exit
with his colleague in pursuit. As the horse didn’t win, it
may be charitably supposed that they became more
broke than ever.

Zalinski, a favourite “ tip ” with sporting

better one hereafter.

It was the condition of Pingara and Sir Wilfrid
which brought off the Millers’ “double” over the Flem-

with the last ounce taken out of her; and Sir Wilfrid,

“moral ” from Ballarat, after it had seemed to be winning
n a canter.

Charles Bannerman, the cricketer, was before
the Court in Sydney on a charge of not hat ing paid
money for the support of his wife. He looked in most
miserable health, pleaded that he had been laid up for
two months and had had bad fortune, and in answer to
a question said that he lived by cricketing. Now, lian-
nerman has faults-and so have we all. Tins Bulletin
hopes that N.S.W. cricketers will now only retnembir
that in bygone days he 'brilliantly upheld their cause on
many a,tied. It would be a graceful thing if the foot
bailers came to ids rescue with a benefit and gave him
another start.

The reversals of form at the Sydney Saturday
afternoon proprietary meetings are remarkable. The fol-
lowing to wit. At Warwick Farm recently Mcrriwa
started in the Selling Pace, and was backed down tn
2 to 1, but only managed to run second to Forrester, who
won in a canter. On the following Saturday, at Hosehill,
Forrester ran unplaced in the Selling Pace and IMenivva,
who started in the principal handicap unbacked by the
public, was only beaten by a head, running the mile and
three furlongs in 2min. 24sec.

Money seems to be more plentiful than ever with
the English “ ring.” The winner of a Two-year-old Plate
at Sundown Park the other week was backed to win
£20,000 without diminishing the odds on offer. The
commissioner started by accepting a bet of 1000 to 120,
and, after making a round of tire hooks, was able to come
back to the first layer and get a little bit more on at ih -
old price. Out here the rule is to reduce the odds by one-
half after a small commission has been worked, and then,
if the public follow suit to any extent, the scared
Hebrews become ‘•full” and refuse to lay any pi ice at
all. There is some reason for this, however. The fact
of one horse being genuinely backed is strong presump-
tive evidence that 75 per cent, of the field is as stiff as a
duchess at a mixed gathering.

There’s a yarn going round on the subject of a
recent Jockey Club enquiry into the condition of the
British Turf. A fashionable light-weight, calkd upon to
explain why he had £30,000 at the bank, told the “most
exclusive club in Christendom ”to go to blazes. He
didn’t care a dash whether he went on riding or not, and
would be’appy to lend a thousand or two to any noble
lord who ’appened to be wuss broke than usual.

The Age cableman sends word that Tom Taylor
has made a break of 1407 in a spot-stroke-ftimed game.
If that’s true, then the pockets were bigger than the
regulation size. If everything was fair and straight, and
the points were actually made, still we may expect to
see Roberts (who doesn’t run up such breaks) give Tom
Taylor half the game and a licking. It was a queer item
of news to cable, anyway.

Sam Davis, now owner of the Palace Hotel,
Newmarket, Vic., was, in the old days, one of Australia’s
crack light-weights, and while wasting to ride John
Cleeland’s Barwon, sent his friend Sharpe to the chemist’s
for three-penn’orth (one ounce) of Epsom Salts. Sharpe,
knowing no better, went to the local Cheap Jack’s store,
got six ounces for the 3d, and mixed the lot, and the small
gentleman with the very large feet remarked as he
smacked his lips after the dose, “ that they were d—d
strong.” How S. 1). fell off (after winning) from weakness
is a matter of racing history.

up, 35,000 being paid up to 95., and 7500 shares
being reserved for future sale. A report on the
mine has been made by Mr. H. Tre near (late
assayer and smelter at the Mount Morgan works).
He speaks very favourably of the venture, which
up to recently has been worked by Messrs., Payne
and Sons, the owners. He says that payable gold
is found throughout the reef, and that the general
character of the metal is coarse and flakey. In
closing his report he states: “After spending
three days at the mine and carefully
examining the lode and its contents I
have come to the conclusion that the pro-
perty is a valuable one and well worth the
attention of mining men. It is not a big reef,
but it is rich in gold, and when the present primi-
tive, laborious, and costly mode of working gives
place to a better system of mining, it ought to pay
handsomely.” Mr. Trenear further states that
the gold occurs chiefly in nodules of quartz, iron
oxide, and pink-coloured felspar on the hanging
wall, some of the stone, when broken, actually
hanging together with the precious metal. He
likewise mentions that there is no battery or
machine! on the field, and that the gold is obtained
by Messrs. Payne and Sons washing the stone
and “dollying” the specimens. By this means
they have mint account sales for over £l5OO for
gold sold. The present Company has been formed
in Brisbane, and the bulk of the proprietary shares
are held by residents in that city. An influential
directorate of well-known and wealthy colonists
is associated with the Company. At a meeting
of the directors held on the day of registration
the services of a competent and practical mining
manager was'engaged. It is the intention of the
proprietary to immediately arrange for a tunnel
to be driven into the hill to catch the reef, as sug-
gested by Mr. Trenear, and also to select a
machine-site on the river. The Rise and Shine
G.M. Co. is said to be one of the few good things
in recent mining developments. The prospectus

(SPECIAL “BULLETIN” TRANSLATION.)
The death of M. Mathias, when it became
known in the little town of Lyre-sur-Ys, caused
a general shock of surprise. A man of barely 45,
robust, straight as an I, and who—there was the
pity of it—had only three years before married a
girl of 20, a charming little woman whom he loved
to distraction.
Naturally, M. Mathias, being dead, obtained a
rapid reputation for a lifetime adorned with all
the virtues. It would be a pretty thing to throw
up against him now, that he had been a usurer
and a skinflint ! Who would think of reviving
the rumour about his marriage, which was
not altogether to his credit, and which,
indeed, would have recalled the vague terror
inspired by the portly citizen, with his underhand
ways, wealthy and avaricious, spending his
leisure, they said, in compounding poisonous
drugs and experimenting with them on captured
dogs ? That was all a thing of the past. He was
dead—peace to his soul!
Besides, when they came to think over it, was
this death, after all, so unlooked-for? Evidently
M. Mathias had had presentiments. Had he not
quite lately rebuilt, with workmen brought all
the way from Paris, the family-vault that awaited
i i mortal remains ? Moreover, he had been in a
very restless mood for some time past. He had
prowled about his own house as if in search of
some mysteiious robber. He kept his wife in
seclusion, and shut himself up for weeks in that
laboratory whose chimney flamed all through the
night. “ Cerebral shock,” said Dr. Labarre, with
a wise air. “ Serous apoplexy.”
They gave M. Mathias a splendid funeral. A
third of the population accompanied him to his
last home, and several eyes grew moist as the
crypt in the funeral chapel received the great oak
coffin—a regular monument, in which two men of
his size might have slept at their ease.
On the way home everyone asked what would
become of the widow ?
# * *
Now, the truth is that M. Mathias was
not dead.
Two hours after the ceremony this is what
might have been observed, had there been any
observers there:
After a sharp sound, like the click of a lock, the
coffin opened like a wardrobe, M. Mathias drew
himself up into a sitting position, and stretched
like a man just awake. Through a grated opening
in the upper wall, a glimmer of light found its
way, M. Mathias rose tj his feet, and gently
rubbed his knees, which were a little stiff.
Altogether, he felt very well, very comfortable.
The narcotic he had taken, after measuring it
with scrupulous care, had produced precisely the
required effect. They had believed him dead;
he had been buried ; everything was perfect.
Long before, M. Mathias had taken all his
precautions. The bottom of his vault had been
very skilfully arranged. It contained a change of
clothes, a store of eatables, and a few bottles of
good w’ne, which, as you can imagine, were just
at the proper temperature. Nothing makes the
stomach feel more empty than a funeral, even
your own, so M. Mathias, seated comfortably on
Ids coffin, broke into a game pic and then drank
to the future.
It is time to tell why M. Mathias was there,
six feet under ground, by his own will.
Of course there was a woman at the bottom of
it. After forty years of bachelorhood, M.
Mathias, a chemist who had made a fortune out
of an anti-spasmodic pill, fell in love with charm-
ing Anne I’iedefer, niece of the receiver of taxes
at Lyre-sur-Ys. He promptly proposed to the
girl, who no less promptly refused, thereby heat-
ing his ardour to the infatuation of an imbecile —
that is to say, of a man of forty who lets himself
fall in love. Being by nature dishonest, he
managed to entangle the old receiver so cunningly
that at the end of a year the unfortunate man,
knowing that there was a shortage in the Govern-
ment cash, thought seriously of suicide. Then M.
Mathias appeared as a saviour, and made his
little conditions. The niece sacrificed herself for
the uncle, who had been a father to her, and that
notwithstanding the very tender relations that
bound her to a notary’s clerk in thenext village. An
unhappy viefim, Anne became Madame Mathias.
She had resigned herself to her fate, and
accepted all the consequences of the catastrophe,
but M. Mathias, doing himself justice, was con-
vinced that she detested him. From that to the
belief that she was deceiving him, as he deserved,
was only a step. The suspicion ripened into a
monomania. His wife never went out ; no one
visited her. What of that? M. Mathias accused
his own dullness. If he had failed to find proof
of his wife's infidelity it must be because ho was
not sharp enough.
Then this brilliant idea came into his head —to
take a sham journey—not to Versailles or Havre,
like the husbands of the comedies, but a much
longer journey, and one from which the return
would seem much more difficult.
And he would come back, very much alive, one
of these nights and surprise his unfaithful spouse.
He had allowed himself three days, and he
thought over it all with great satisfaction as lie
stretched himself again comfortably in his coffin.
# * *
The third day was just over. M. Mathias
was trembling with impatience. He waited till
the cemetery clock struck eleven. The moment
had come !
His plans had been carefully laid. The wall of
the cemetery bounded his property. He had a
complete suit of black, so that he might dress in the
character of a spectral chemist. His shroud he
would only wear in the cemetery, for the sake of
local colour. Once he had scaled the wall he
would go straight to his wife’s room. And
then— !
M. Mathias dressed himself, and when every-
thing was ready lie swung open the tombstone,
climbed into the chapel above, opened the door,
and stepped out, his shroud under his arm.
Under the trees, he unfolded the great white
sheet and tried to throw it round his shoulders.
But the folds were heavy. He had to try again.
“ Hold hard !” said a voice behind him. “I’ll
give you a hand.”
# • #
If you have ever been in a cemetery at
midnight, trying to fix your shroud, you will see
at once how disagreeable this interruption must
have been.
The speaker was the caretaker of the place-
old Grimbot, an odd character, very well-known
in the neighbouring taverns. He came up to M.
Mathias, peered into his face, and exclaimed :
“ What! you, Monsieur Mathias! Already!”
M. Mathias, not a little embarrassed, distorted
his face, with the idea that a sinister appearance
would soon free him from his unwelcome com-
panion. But not at all. Grimbot good-naturedly
took the shroud and arranged it in the most
becoming fashion.
“I have left my tomb—” commenced M.
Mathias, in a sepulchral voice.
“So I see,” interrupted Grimbot. “You arc
in more of a hurry than the rest of them.”
M. Mathias did not wait to listen. He was
moving off now with great strides, on the tips of
his toes, phantom-fashion,
Grimbot walked alongside, and continued :
“Yes, the others don’t as a rule begin all at
once. It generally takes a month or two.”
M. Mathias wheeled round suddenly, waving
his arms:
“ Away, sacrilegious wretch ! Away !”
“Come, come,” said Grimbot, in a paternal
tone. “ I won’t annoy you. You want to take a
stroll, like your friends below, but ”
M. Mathias, growing savage, went straight
ahead, and disdained any reply. He saw through
the gloom the gate of the cemetery. Like a wise
man, he had several louis in his pocket.
“ No more talk,” he said, sharply, holding out
a couple of gold coins. “ The key.”
Grimbot started back :
“ The key ! You want to go out! There's an
idea ! No, no ; you can’t ”
“Four louis,”groaned M. Mathias.
“Come, now,” rejoined Grimbot severely,
“none of that, you know. You may leave your
chapel, you may stretch your legs, and I have
nothing to say. The others leave their ”
‘‘ The others ! What others ?”
Grimbot gave a comprehensive wave of the
hand ;
“ Why, the dead.”
“ The dead ! Who is speaking of the dead? I
am alive!”
“ Oh, yes you will have your joke. But come
along ; I’m a decent fellow ; we’ll have a drink.”
His hand gripped like a vyce the wrist of M.
Mathias, whom he led forcibly to the little build-
ing where he lived, and thrust into a room on the
ground floor.
M. Mathias was literally stunned.
Grimbot shut the door, took a bottle from the
dresser, and, filling two glasses, lifted one to his
lips with ;
“Your health, Monsieur Mathias 1”
* * *
“Listen, my good fellow,” said M.
Mathias. “You want your joke. Very well.
But there is a time for everything. You know
quite well that I am alive. For private reasons,
X let myself be buried. But now I must get out,
on very serious business. I will pay you well,
trust me. ”
As he spoke, Grimbot had quietly moved round
tire table, and now he stood with his back against
t!ie door.
“ A pretty story,” he said, sarcastically. “ Ah,
so you arc alive ! You are not the first that has
told me that. I hear some very queer things.
You see, I am very fond of my guests. Every
night one or two of them come to take a friendly
glass. Last night, it was the notary —you remem-
ber Kadel, your neighbour—the one that has the
broken column. The night before, it was Madame
Claudin— a fine woman that! I’m a decent chap,
I let them take the night air, we have a little chat
—but lee them out!—that would be a nice
thing!”
M. Mathias grew haggard. Grimbot was
speaking with perfect sang /void like a
responsible functionary.
He was of middle height, thick-set, with the
hands of a gorilla. His eyes were black, glitter-
ing. M. Mathias shuddered. The man was
mad !
Yes, that was it. He had visions. And —
sign of hopeless insanity !—he heard the voices of
the dead. He peopled the cemetery with ghosts.
He lived in a fantastic world, the creature of
his drunken imagination.
M. Mathias began coaxing, pleading* promising,
beseeching. “What! the good, the intelligent
Grimbot could really take him for a dead man !
It was too amusing. Ha ! ha !”
“That will do,” broke in Grimbot, gruffly.
“ You won't be sensible. Time to go back.”
“Back? Where?”
“ To your own place—corner of the third row.”
“To the vault? Never !”
“You won’t! Once ! twice !—”
M. Mathias saw the enormous hands tremble,
lie grew sick, ho looked round for a way of
escape. There was only one—the door, and but-
tressed against it Grimbot. So much the worse.
He must get past at any cost. With a shout he
rushed forward.
Grimbot calmly put out his open hand and his
aggressor’s throat fitted into it. M. Mathias
gasped and tried to struggle. The claw tightened.
M. Mathias hung suspended at the end of an
arm. He kicked convulsively once or twice, then
a shudder, and he was still.
Grimbot, who had seen many such before, threw
him over his shoulder and carried him off with the
slow, dignified step of a trusty keeper to the
chapel, tossed him into the vault, swung the stone
into place with a kick, shut the grating, and
resumed his walk amongst the tombs, grumbling
to himself—
“ A pretty cheek ! Go out! And my billet!”—
* * •
That was how the widow of M. Mathias
was able to marry the man she had always loved.

MERELY THE TRUTH.
They have merit.
The fact is indisputable.
The proof lies in the free samples.
It is not enough to say they sometimes fail.
They are of human produce, and therefore fallible.
The real facts are—
Do they cure diseases of the blood and skin in the majority of in-
stances ? Undoubtedly they do.
Do they undo the effect of a chill or congestion, by bringing about
normal conditions of health ? Yes, they loosen and disperse the congestion.
Do they permeate the blood aseptically, so that bacilli and gcsuns
cannot multiply and the growth of disease is checked ? Yes, they do.
Do they confer relief, assuage pain, and benefit the general health,
even when they do not cure ? Invariably, yes.
Do they act as a natural healthy laxative, rendering them especially
valuable to women and children, and to men of sedentary habits of life or
business ? Yes, by tonic action only.
Do they free the inner skin pores and intricacies from taint, clearing
off Eruptions and improving the complexion ? They do.
Does their palatable taste and safety render them pre-eminently a
family medicine ? Yes, for neither the mind nor stomach rebels against
them, and children like them.
Are they the best of all blood purifiers and the most valuable of all
spring cleansing medicines ? Yes, they are.

A Big Business
Built Up
On Free Samples
The sales of Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets

merits, taken in conjunction with the methods
by which the sale has been built up.
For nearly two years past every person
who has written or applied for free samples of
Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets has been supplied
gratis and post free. Many tens of thousands
of persons have so applied, in accordance with
our invitation.
Practically every one of our advertisements
has contained an offer to supply free samples.
To the samples, therefore, as a test of
merit, must be attributed the success or failure
of the sales.
Have the sales grown?
Let the facts speak for themselves —
The sale for the year ending January 9,
1890, was 81,760 packets, proved by the pur-
chase of that number of Revenue Stamps,
The sale for the year ending January 9,
1891, was 412,000 packets, proved also by the
purchase of that number of Revenue Stamps.

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Yote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics,
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more 1
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is foundi
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic'
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
?r.u has become a vast property, because it pos.
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists'
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductons claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has.
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerfull
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-,
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and!
weekly press prior to and immediately after the'
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural 1
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some’’
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings;
with the latest appliances for high-class printing:
and the production of illustrations, and they have'
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned withi
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, thi'oughout its career, has;
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among:
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afllicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges, A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed bo broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact —
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently ren ailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quote d in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies. '
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest ami most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

To 11. F. KUGEUiANK, Esq.
Dear Sir,- This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains iu my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was cxpectoratingcverv day, 1 became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill 1 consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. Front that time I commenced to~ improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
