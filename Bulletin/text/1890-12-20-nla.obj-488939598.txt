You Only. O! Books, are Liberal and
Independent.
THE above saying was written by Richard
De Bury over six hundred years ago; and
in the 19th century, among the millions of books
published and various opinions expressed, how
true we feel it is. Solomon has also placed it on
record that in his day to the making of books
there was no end ; but what would the wisest of
all men say were he living now and could visit
DYMOCK'S BOOK ARCADE,
428 George Street, Next Royal Hotel,
where half-a-million of books occupying 20 miles
of shelving, are always on view, FREE for the
inspection of all ?
Truly it is a great, a noble sight to see this great
home of literature; books collected from all parts
of the world on every known subject. There you
are welcome to wander through the spacious aisles,
and gather knowledge at every step
Free of Charge.
No officious Librarians to interrupt you.
This alone should be a great attraction for
teachers and others wishing to select books for

SUBJECT o” IMPORTANCE
-■ .1 -
Respecting the virtues of the Dandelion
Root in cases of Diver Complaint , and
the many diseases following in its train, we read
in that standard work of Bentley’s (“ Medicinal
Plants”) that Dandelion “ is regarded as slightly
Tonic, Aperient and Diuretic. It appears to
have an almost specific action on the Liver, by
modifying and increasing its secretion. Hence
it is extensively employed in Chronic Diseases
of the Digestive Organs, or Enlargement of
the Liver, Dropsies from Hepatic Obstruction,
and Dyspepsia, attended with deficient Biliary
Secretion.”
By the foregoing, it is evident that in the Dandelion
Root we find the best remedy known to the Medical World
for all forms of
Liver Complaint,
Kidney Disease,
IMPOVERISHMENT of ™ BLOOD,
AND THE MANY OTHER ILLS ARISING THEREFROM.
-^DUMSTONE’S^-
Compound Essence of Dandelion,
Is the best preparation of the Boot to be obtained.
IT IS NO SHAM NOSTRUM, BUT A HEALING MEDICINE.

The Verdict of Circum-
stances:
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have forgotten the grocer’s name, but he
lived somewhere in William-street, Woolloomoo-
loo. I went to obtain the loan of the Sydney
Morning Herald. That journal in those days was
fourpenoe a copy, and poor people like my father
could not afford to purchase it. We used to trade
with the grocer, and sometimes during the week
and always on Saturdays I was sent to get th e
paper. It often happened, as on the night I speak
of, that the Herald had been lent to other people,
and that, they having had an extended loan
of the paper, I called at their house for it. I
fancy it was somewhere in Yurong-street that
the borrowers lived on this particular occasion,
and I knocked at their door and stated my
business. The door was opened by a young
woman, who, I afterwards noticed, was very like
my mother in appearance. She did not get the
paper at once, but led me into a back room,
wherein was another but somewhat older woman.
At the time it did not strike me, but looking
back I think they must have carefully scrutinised
my face and appearance. At all events, I re-
member being seated on the table, while the two
women sat on chairs in-front of me and asked me
many questions. I was a lad of not more than
seven years at the time, and have now, of course,
very little recollection of what the questions were.
I have an impression that they concerned my
parents and their mode of life. One thing, how-
ever, I do remember. Circumstances have hap*
pened which have caused me to change my name,
but at the time I speak of I was Henry Scott, and
ny questioners were very anxious to know if I
knew anyone named Rees. As it chanced, I did
not; and having satisfied their curiosity they
gave me the paper. The elder of the two women
accompanied me almost to' ! -the door of th e
house at which I said I lived, and watched me
enter the side gate, as if to make quite sure that I
really did reside there.
I was a secretive child, and mentioned nothing
of my adventure to my parents. Indeed, I had
little encouragement to do so, so far as one of
them went, for I hardly remember seeing my
father sober. I might have forgotten the events
of the night had I not seen the two women
shortly afterwards, under very peculiar circum-
stances. One day, just before dinner, I was seated
among the branches of a peach-tree at the end of
our garden abutting on a lane, when, looking over
the fence and up the street, I saw the two women
who had spoken to me pass by. The elder of
them had a basket of fruit on her arm, and was
dressed in ordinary costume; the other woman
had on a long cloak, and was closely veiled. On
reaching our house the woman with the basket set
it down on the door-step, while the other went as
far as the paddock and round the comer out of
sight. When she had disappeared, the basket-
woman knocked at the door, which was opened
by my mother. After asking some questions—
probably about the fruit—and being answered,
the woman took up her basket and replaced it on
her arm, yet did not straightway move olf, but
remained talking to my mother. Meanwhile, the
other woman had reappeared, and was walking
slowly back again. I noticed that she looked at my
mother, but did not stop until she reached the
lane near where I sat. She turned into the lane a
few steps, and was presently joined by her
friend. My curiosity was awakened, and as they
could not see me, I naturally tried to catch what
they said. They did not remain more than a few
moments, but long enough for me to hear the
younger woman say, “ It is just as I thought; it’s
Priscilla.”
It must have been a month afterwards, and a
Saturday. I had been forbidden to go out of the
yard, but having heroically obeyed during the
forenoon, in spite of my mother’s orders I had
sneaked over the fence at about three o’clock, and
gone to a grass paddock near Sydney Grammar
School, where I used to play cricket. At about
half-past six I stole homewards. I remember
everything which happened that evening, as per-
haps I had reason to do. There was a gate in the
lane through which we all entered the premises,
for I never, to my knowledge, entered the front
door, neither did my father. As I got near the
gate I cautiously peeped through the fence, then
carefully listened for signs of my father’s presence.
If he were at home I should certainly be soundly
thrashed for staying out so late, but, then, it was
Saturday, and it was not often that he came home
sober on that day, and when he did return it
was rarely before eight o’clock. So I listened, and
presently found myself praying. My mother had
taught me to pray, and explained to me the
efficacy of prayer. Perhaps under the circum-
stances, it was not out of place that I should pray,
and my prayer was that my father should come
home drunk. I suppose I thought it was hardly
any use praying that I should escape a thrashing,
since experience had proved that my only chance
on that score was that my father should not be in,
and if he were drunk, it was perfectly certain that
he would not be in. So I said my prayer and
sneaked into the house.
My father had not come home, so I was safe
from a beating and did not greatly mind being
threatened by my mother, who never hurt me very
much. Her chief concern was my utter untidi-
ness, for the poor soul could not afford to clothe
me out of the balance of my father’s earnings
after the publican was paid. My absence without
leave, however, had much displeased her, so she
threatened to give me some outs with the cane,
and when she went to get that instrument of
punishment I dived under the table. The cloth
was set, and the tea-things laid waiting my
father’s coming. There were, as usual, two plates
and two small knives and forks, and the carver,
two cups, the sugar and the slop-basin, and, 1
think, a cruet. My mother soon came back with
the stick, and, having called me, was on the
point of lifting the table-cloth, when a knock
came to the front door.
Leaving her cane behind, she went to see what
was wanted. Visitors after nightfall or indeed at
any other time were rare, and from my hiding-place
under the table I quietly listened to all that was
said. After thirty years I am not able to give any
accurate account of what passed ; indeed, in spite
of the many times I have since gone over it, I am
only certain of remembering a few scraps of the
conversation between the visitor and my mother.
Other things I seem to remember, but I doubt
their happening.
The visitor was a woman. At the time I thought
it was the younger of the two women who had
detained me at their house, but I did not see her,
not even her dress. When she spoke to me her
voice had been, if anything, rather subdued; now,
speaking to my mother, it was excited, and at
times approached a shriek. Yet I still think it
was that woman.
“ What do you want ?” said my mother, rather
sharply as she opened the door and peered out in
the dark.
“I want to see you for a moment,” answered
the visitor, pushing herself into the room—there
was no hall. My mother did not resist, not
realising, probably, the woman’s intention. Again
she asked “ What do you want ?” and then “ My
God ! it’s Bella !”
“Yes, it’s Bella. For over seven years I’ve
searched for you, and now I find you in this hovel.
Where is Robert Rees ?” Saying these words
she seemingly caught my mother by the arm, and
they both entered the kitchen or dining-room, for
it was both, where I was concealed. My mother
apparently had forgotten all about me, for she
asked or motioned her visitor to a seat, she herself
taking her accustomed place on the couch or
settle, alongside which the table was drawn.
There was a few moments’ silence, and perhaps
the visitor took the opportunity of glancing at the
mean surroundings, for she presently said : “ So
you’ve come to this ! Where is Robert?”
“ He lias not come home yet.”
The woman was sitting in my father’s chair,
and I could hear her and, for that matter, see her,
tapping her feet impatiently within an inch or two
of where I crouched.
“You must go,” continued my mother. “I
cannot have you here.”
“ No, you cannot, but I shall not leave just yet.
As I told you, for seven years I have sought you
everywhere, till chance brought me here to find
you. You traitor—why did you take Robert
from me? ”
It would be absurd to pretend to recall the
whole of the woman’s talk, but I have a fixed im-
pression of its violence, amidst all of which my
mother uttered not a word. At times the woman’s
excitement frightened me, and I thought of rush-
ing out, but curiosity was stronger, and through
it all I remained in my hiding-place. Again and
again she came back to the question she had
asked: “ Why did you take Robert from me?” In
her fury she presently stood up and hissed the
question in my mother’s face. At last my mother
spoke.
“I did not take him from you. He did not
care for you.”
“ You lie, you wretch, you lie ! ”
“It’s the truth,” cried ray mother. “What’s
more, he hated you.”
“ You lying, cursed thief ! ”
Something had happened, my mother fell back
on the sofa, and in a stifled voice cried—“My
God ! it’s over—at last —at last. ” The woman did
not move for an instant or two. Then I could
hear her blowing out the candle, twice or thrice
she tried without succeeding. “ I did not bargain
for this,” she said, as she softly but quickly left the
room.
The abrupt ending of the conversation, the
darkness, and the gasps of my mother, then the
silence, terrified me; but I did not move. Drip,
drip, I heard falling near me. They’ve spilt some-
thing-something warm I thought, as a little
stream reached the hand on which I was leaning.
Drip, drip, on the floor. I was about to call
softly to my mother, when I heard a well-known
footstep in the garden. It was that of my father.
He was drunk, of course, I could tell by the
sound. In his fumbling way he opened the
door and cursed at the darkness. Yes, he was
very drunk. He staggered into the room, describ-
ing a half-circle in his clumsy effort to find his
accustomed seat; striking hard against the chair
he finally reeled between the table_ and the sofa,
and sank on the floor. In falling, his legs shot out
and knocked me from under the table. Picking
myself up hastily, I ran to the stairs, and
shielded by the open door ventured to look
back. My father was sitting in a pool of blood,
for it was blood, one arm was thrown over my
mother’s body, the other clutched the table.
“What the devil’s this?” he muttered in his
meaningless voice. “Priscilla, I want you.”
Then, forgetting his question, he settled himself
to sleep. I went out into the garden, and seeing
my hand all darkened, I rubbed it in the earth
and then washed oft the stain. When I went in I
could hear my father’s heavy breathing ; he was
almost in the same position as when he fell, and,
fearing to attract attention, I went noiselessly to
bed.
Early next morning I was awakened by two
policemen, who roughly handled me. Seeing what
they were, I commenced to cry. “Do you know
your mother’s dead ?” they asked.
“ No,” I said, dreading they would fix the blame
on me.
“ Did you see your father do it ?”
“No.”
They removed me out of the house, probably to
the gaol, and both then and subsequently I was
frequently asked about my father, and if I had
seen him kill my mother. Through all the ques-
tionings I maintained the same answer, that I
knew nothing about the matter, my fear being
lest they should punish me. Of ray own know-
ledge I can say nothing further about the affair.
Eor a while I remained at the gaol, and was
afterwards sent to the Parramatta Orphan School,
taught to read and write, and after seven or eight
years was apprenticed to a Sydney bookbinder.
It was while in his service that I learned the
subsequent phases of the tragedy.
It chanced that I had some old bound copies of
the Empire to re-bind or repair. Turning over
the pages one dinner-hour, I became interested in
the account of the trial of one Robert Scott, alias
Rees, for murder —so interested, that I turned
back page after page till I got to the beginning
of the account, commencing on the Monday follow-
ing my mother’s death. It would appear from the
frequent references to it in the newspaper that
the murder created the greatest public excitement
at the time, but it would be tedious to narrate
the details given in the public prints. So far as
I can make out, this is what happened after I took
refuge in bed.
My father slept drunkenly in the pool of blood by
my mother’s dead body all night, his head resting
on the edge of the couch, one hand thrown over
her, while the other, for some time at least, must
have grasped the knife wherewith she was
stabbed. She must have still been bleeding as he
fell at her side, for one of his pockets was partly
filled with blood when, with early morning, he
awoke from his drunken stupor. What were his
feelings when he came to view the scene God only
knows. He had not the faintest recollection of
his coming home, nor of anything that happened
thereafter. Stunned and stupefied, he took no
trouble to free himself from his bloody clothes,
or even to wash his hands of their stains. Almost
mechanically he took his way to the Station-house
at Darlinghurst and told the police his fearsome
story. So unlikely did it appear that the blood on
his hands, on the seat and side of his trousers,
even in his pockets, was from a human body that
the police looked upon my father as demented
with drink. Erom Darlinghurst to our home,
however, was not very far, so the truth of the tale
was soon established.
The inquest was held in due course. I was not
brought to it —possibly after my persistent denial
to the police of having heard any noise or wit-
nessed any struggle, it was thought a useless bar-
barism to confront a child with his mother’s mur-
derer. The jury brought in a verdict of wilful
murder against my father, and a month after-
wards the trial came on at the Sessions. During
this time he frequently begged that they should
not ask him to see me. As his son did not know
anything of the matter, he wished him to remain
in ignorance till the end.
At the trial the circumstances surrounding
the murder were duly marshalled, my father
admitted the condition in which he had slept
through the awful night, and pleaded that
if he had killed his wife, it was impossible
to think that, however drunk, he would de-
liberately sit down in her blood. The judge
charged the jury against the prisoner. Drunken-
ness could not be admitted in extenuation of
crime, .else the very foundations of society would
be destroyed. Granting even that the prisoner
had no recollection of the deed —and for this
they had merely his assertion—the crime was
none the less his, and he must pay the penalty,
especially as wife-murders by drunken husbands
had been increasingly frequent about that time.
The jury found the prisoner guilty ; indeed, it was
hardly possible they could do otherwise.
My father said nothing against the justice of his
sentence, and at the last seemed quite resigned to
death, as if he believed the deed to have been his
and that it had utterly unfitted him for further
existence. Three weeks afterwards he was
carefully hanged, an eloquent tribute to what his
judge was pleased to call the most certain of all
testimony—that of circumstances.^

On Kiley’s Run.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The roving breezes come and go
On Kiley’s Run.
The sleepy river murmurs low,
And far away one dimly sees
Beyond the stretch of forest trees
Beyond the foot-hills dusk and dan
The ranges sleeping m the sun
On Kiley’s Run.
’Tis many years since first I cajne
To Kiley’s Run,
More years than I would care to lurr.e
Since I, a stripling, used to ride
For miles and miles at Kiley’s side,
The while in stirring tones he told
The stories of the days of old
On Kiley’s Run,
I see the old bush homestead now
On Kiley’s Run.
Just nestled down beneath the brow
Of one small ridge above the sweep
Of river-flat, where willows weep
And jasmin flowers and roses bloom,
The air was laden with perfume
On Kiley’s Run
We lived the good old station life
On Kiley’s Run,
With little thought of care or strife.
Old Kiley seldom used to roam,
He liked to make the Run his lion;?,
The swagman never turned away
With empty hand at close of day
From Kiley’s Run.
We kept a racehorse now and then
On Kiley’s Run,
And neighb’ring stations brought their men
To meetings where the sport was free,
And dainty ladies came to see
Their champions ride ; with laugh and song
The old house rang the whole night long
On Kiley’s Run.
The station-hands were friends I wot
On Kiley’s Run,
A reckless, merry-hearted lot—
All splendid riders, and they knew
The “boss ” was kindness through and through.
Old Kiley always stood their friend.
And so they served him to the end
On Kiley’s Run.
But droughts and losses came apace
To Kiley’s Run,
Till ruin stared him in the face ;
He toiled and toiled while lived the light,
He dreamed of overdrafts at night :
At length, because he could not pay,
His bankers took the stock away
From Kiley’s Run.
Old Kiley stood and saw them go
From Kiley’s Run.
■The well-bred cattle marching slow :
His stockmen, mates for many a day,
They wrung lus hand and went away.
Too old to make another start,
Old Kiley died —of broken heart,
On Kiley’s Run.
The owner lives in England now
Of Kiley’s Run.
He knows a racehorse from a cow ;
But that is all he knows of stock :
His chiefest care is how to dock
Expenses, and he sends from town
To cut the shearers’ wages down
On Kiley’s Run.
There are no neighbours anywhere
Near Kiley’s Run.
The hospitable homes are bare,
The gardens gone ; for no pretence
Must hinder cutting down expense ;
The homestead that we held so dear
Contains a half-paid overseer
On Kiley’s Run. •
All life and sport and hope have died
On Kiley’s Run.
No longer there the stockmen ride ;
For sour-faced boundary-riders creep
On mongrel horses after sheep, i
Through ranges where, at racing-speed,
Old Kiley used to “ wheel the lead ”
On Kiley’s Run.
There runs a lane for thirty miles
Through Kiley’s Run.
On either side the herbage smiles,
But wretched traveling sheep must pass
Without a drink or blade of grass
Thro’ that long lane of death and shame:
The weary drovers curse the name
Of Kiley’s Run.
The name itself is changed of late
Of Kiley’s Run.
They call it “ Chandos Park Estate.”
The lonely swagman through the dark
Must hump his swag past Chandos Park.
The name is English, don’t you see,
The old name sweeter sounds to me
Of “ Kiley’s Run.”
I cannot guess what fate will bring
To Kiley’s Run —
For chances come and changes ring—
I scarcely think ’twill always be
Locked-up to suit an absentee ;
And if he lets it out in farms
His tenants soon will carry arms
On Kiley’s Run.

SPIRIT-LED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Chapter I.
It was the hottest day the Gulf had seen for
years. Burning, scorching and blistering heat,
beating down directly from the vertical sun, in the
open, radiating from the iron roof which provided
what was mistakenly called shade. In the whole
township there was not a corner to be found
where a man could escape the suffocating sense
of being in the stoke-hole of a steamer.
The surroundings were not of a nature to be
grateful to eyes wearied with the monotony of
plain and forest. The few stunted trees that had
been spared appeared to be sadly regretting that
they had not shared the fate of their comrades,
and the barren ironstone ridge on which the town-
ship was built gave back all the sun’s heat it
had previously absorbed with interest.
Two men who had just come in from the country
swore that where they crossed the Flinders the
alligators came out and begged for a cold drink
from their water-bags; and the most confirmed
sceptic admitted the existence of a material hell.
Naturally there was little or no business doing
and, just as naturally, everybody whose inclina-
tion pointed that way went “ on the spree.”
Amongst those who had not adopted this mode
of killing old father Time were two men in the
verandah of the Royal Hotel. (When Australia
becomes republican it is to be presumed that a
‘ Royal ’ will cease to be the distinguishing feature
of every township.)
The two men in question were seated on canvas
chairs in the verandah, both lightly attired in
shirt and trousers only, busily engaged in mopping
the perspiration from their streaming faces, and
swearing at the flies.
“Deuced sight hotter lounging about here than
travelling,” said Davis, the elder of the two; “ I
vote we make a start. ”
“ I’m agreeable,” replied his companion ; “ the
horses must be starving out in the paddock. We
shall have a job to get Delaine away, though;
he’s bent on seeing his cheque through.”
“That won’t take long at the rate he’s going.
He’s got every loafer in the town hanging about
after him.”
“Hullo! what’s that?” said the other, as the
shrill whistle of a steam-latinch was heard. “ Oh !
of course, the steamer arrived at the mouth of the
river last night; that’s the launch coming up.
Shall we go down and see who is on board ?”
The two men got up and joined the stragglers
who were wending their way across the bare flat
to the bank of the river. The passengers were
few in number, but they included some
strangers to the place; one of whom, a young-
looking man with white hair and beard, imme-
diately attracted Davis’ attention.
“ See that chap, Bennett ?” he said.
“Yes, Dick, who is he?”
“ Some years ago he was with me droving for a
trip ; when we started he was as young-looking as
you, and his hair as dark. It’s a true bill about
a man’s hair going white in one night. His
did.”
“ What from ? Fright?”
“Yes. We buried him alive by mistake.”
“The deuce you did !”
“ He had a cataleptic fit when he was on watch
one night. The other man—we were double-
banking the watch at the time—found him as
stiff as a poker, and we all thought he was dead,
there was no sign of life in him. It was hot
weather —as bad as this —and we couldn’t keep
him, so we dug a grave, and started to bury him at
sundown. He came to when we were filling in
the grave ; yelled blue murder, and frightened the
life out of us. His hair that night turned as you
see it now, although he vows that it was not the
fright of being buried alive that did it.”
“What then?”
“Something that happened when he was in the
fit, or trance. He has never told anybody any-
thing more than that he was quite conscious all
the time, and had a very strange experience. ”
“ Ever ask him anything ?”
“No ; he didn’t like talking about it. Wonder
what he’s doing up here?”
By this time the river bank was deserted ;
Davis and Bennett strolled up after the others
and when they arrived at the Royal, they found
the hero of the yarn there before them.
“Hullo, Maxwell,’’said Davis, “ what’s brought
you up this way ?”
Maxwell started slightly when he saw his
quondam sexton ; but he met him frankly enough
although at first he disregarded the question that
had been asked.
In the course of the conversation that followed
Maxwell stated that he was oh his way out to the
Nicholson river, but with what object did not
transpire.
“Bennett and I were just talking of making a
start to-morrow, or the next day. Our cattle are
spelling on some country just this side of the
Nicholson. We can’t travel until the wet
season comes and goes. You had better come
with us.”
“I shall be very glad,” replied the other, and
the thing was settled.
Bennett had been looking curiously at this man
who had had such a narrow escape of immortality,
but beyond the strange whiteness of his hair,
which contrasted oddly with the swarthy hue of
his sunburnt face, and a nervous look in his eyes,
he did not show any trace of his strange experi-
ence. On the contrary, he promised, on nearer
acquaintance, to be a pleasant travelling com-
panion.
The summer day drew to a close, the red sun
sank in the heated haze that hovered immediately
above the horizon, and a calm, sultry night, still
and oppressive, succeeded the fierce blaze of the
day-time. The active and industrious mosquito
commenced his rounds and men tossed and
moaned and perspired under nets made of coarse
cheese-cloth.
The next morning broke hot and sullen as
before. Davis had risen early to send a man out
to the paddock after the horses, and was in the
bar talking to the pyjama- attired landlord.
“ You’ll have to knock off his grog or there’ll be
trouble,” he said ; “ he was up all last night wan-
dering about with his belt and revolver on, mut-
tering to himself, and when a fellow does that he’s
got ’em pretty bad.”
“ I’ll do what I can, but if he doesn’t get drink
here he will somewhere else,” replied the other
reluctantly.
, “.Then I’ll see the P.M. and get him to pro-
mbit his being served. It’s the only way to get
him straight.”
At this moment the subject of their remarks
catered the bar—a young fellow about five or six
mid twenty. He was fully dressed, it being
c ''ident that he had not gone to bed all night. The
whites of his eyes were not blood shot, but blood-
red throughout, and the pupils so dilated that
they imparted a look of unnatural horror to his
face,
“Hullo, Davis!” he shouted; “glad to see a
white man at last. That old nigger with the
white hair has been after me all night. The old
buck who was potted in the head. He comes
around every night now with his flour-bag cobra
all over blood. Can’t get a wink of sleep for him.
Have a drink ?”
His speech was quite distinct, he was past the
stage when strong waters thicken the voice ; his
walk was steady, and but for the wild eyes, he
might have passed for a man who was simply
tired out with a night’s riding or watching.
The landlord glanced enquiringly at Davis, as if
to put the responsibility of serving the liquor on
him.
“Too early, Delaine, and too hot already;
besides, I’m going to start to-day and mustn’t
get tight before breakfast,” said the latter sooth-
ingly. . , • . ,
“ 0 be hanged ! Here, give us something, and
the young fellow turned towards the bar, and as
he did so caught sight of Maxwell who had just
come to the door and was looking in.
The effect of the dark face and snow-white hair
on his excited brain was awful to witness. His
eyes, blazing before, seemed now simply coals of
fire. Davis and the landlord turned to see what
the madman was looking at, and that moment was
nearly fatal to the newcomer. Muttering: “By
, he’s taken to following me by daylight as
well, has he? But I’ll blank soon stop him;” he
drew his revolver and, but that Davis turned his
head again and was j ust in time to knock his hand
up, Maxwell would have been past praying for.
The landlord ran round the bar, and with some
trouble the three men got the pistol from the
maniac, who raved, bit, and fought, like a wild
beast. The doctor, who slept in the house, was
called, and, not particularly sober himself, in-
jected some morphia into the patient’s arm, which
soon sent him into a stupor.
“By Jove, Davis, you saved my life,” said
Maxwell ; “that blessed lunatic would have
potted me sure enough only for you. Whom did he
take me for ? ”
“He’s in the horrors, his name is Delaine, and
he’s out on a station on the tableland. They had
some trouble with the blacks up there lately, and,
I suppose, it was the first dispersing-match he
had ever seen. There was one white-haired old
man got a bullet through his head, and he says he
felt as though his own father had been shot when
he saw it done. He’s a clergyman’s son; of course
he drinks like a fish and is superstitious as well.”
“I trust they’ll lock him up until I get out of
the town; but I’ll remember your share of tin's.
Wait until we get away and I will tell you what
brought me up here, but don’t ask me any ques-
tions now. Is your friend Bennett to be trusted ? ’
“In what way? Wine, women or gold? I
don’t know about the first two, but the last I can
answer for.”
“It’s a secret. Possibly connected with the
last.”
“I hope so, I want some bad enough. I think
I know where to put you on to a couple of good
horses, and then we’ll make a start. ”
Chapter 11.
The stove-like township is three days journey
away; four men, Davis, Bennett, Maxwell, and
a blackfellow are camped for the night by the side
of a small lagoon covered with the broad leaves of
the purple water-lily. In the distance the cheery
sound of the horse-bells can be heard, and round
the fire the travellers are grouped listening to
Maxwell who is telling the tale he has never yet
told.
“When I fell down on watch that night and
became to all appearance a corpse, I never, for one
instant, lost either consciousness or memory. My
soul, spirit, or whatever you like to call it, parted
company with my body, but I retained all former
powers of observation. I gazed at myself lying
there motionless, waited until my fellow-watcher
came around and awakened the sleeping camp
with the tidings of my death, then, without any
impulse of my own, I left the spot and found my-
self in a shadowy realm where all was vague and
confused. Strange, indistinct shapes flitted con-
stantly before me; I heard voices and sounds like
sobbing and weeping.
“Now, before I go on any further, let me tell you
that I have never been subject to these fits. I
never studied any occult arts, nor troubled myself
about what I called ‘such rubbish.’ Why this
experience should have happened to me I cannot
tell. I found I was travelling along pretty swiftly,
carried on by some unknown motive power, or,
rather, drifting on with a current of misty forms
in which all seemed confusion.
“Suddenly, to my surprise, I found myself on the
earth once more, in a place quite unknown to me,
“ I was in Australia—that much I recognised at
a glance—but whereabouts ?
‘ T was standingon thebank of a river—a northern
river, evidently, for I could see the foliage of the
drooping ti-trees and Leichhardt trees further
down its course. The surrounding country was
open, but barren ; immediately in front of me was
a rugged range through which the river found its
way by means of an apparently impenetrable
gorge. The black rocks rose abruptly on either
side of a deep pool of water, and all progress was
barred except by swimming. The ranges on either
hand were precipitous, cleft by deep ravines ; all
the growth to be seen was spinifex, save a few
stunted blood wood trees.
“ What struck me most forcibly was, that in the
centre of the waterhole, at the entrance of the
gorge, as it were, there arose two rocks, like
pillars, some twelve or fifteen feet in height above
the surface of the water.
“Below the gorge the river-bed was sandy, and
the usual timber grew on either bank. At first I
thought I was alone, but, on looking around, I
found that a man was standing a short distance
away from me. Apparently he was a European,
but so tanned and burnt by the sun as to be almost
copper-coloured. He was partially clothed in
skins, and held some hunting weapons in his
hand. He was gazing absently into the gorge
when I first noticed him, but presently turned,
and, without evincing any surprise or curiosity,
bjekonedto me. Immediately, in obedience to
some unknown impulse, I found myself threading
the gloomy gorge with him, although, apparently,
we exercised no motion. It was more as though
we stood still and the rocks glided past us and the
water beneath us. We soon reached a small open
space or pocket; here there was a rude hut, and
here we halted.
“Mystrange companion looked around and with-
out speaking, drew my attention to a huge boulder
close to the hut and on which letters and figures
were carved. I made out the principal inscrip-
tion. ‘ Hendrik Heermans, hier vangecommen,
1670. ’ There were also an anchor, a ship and a
heart, all neatly cut. I turned from these records
to the man. He beckoned me again, and I fol-
lowed him across the small open space and up a
ravine. The man pointed to a reef cropping out
and crossing the gully. I looked at it and saw
that the cap had been broken and that gold was
showing freely in the stone. The man waved his
hand up the gully as though intimating that there
were more reefs there.
“Suddenly, sweeping up the gorge came a gust of
ice-cold wind, and with it a dash of mist or spray.
Looming out of this I saw for a moment a young
girl’s face looking earnestly at me. Her lips
moved. ‘ Go back. Go back ! ’ she seemed to
whisper.
“ When I heard this I felt an irresistible longing
to return to my discarded body and in an instant
g irge, mountains and all my surroundings disap-
p; vred, and I found myself in the twilight space
uattliug despairingly on, for I felt that I had lost
my way and should never find it again.
“ How was I to reach my forsaken body through
such a vague, misty and indeterminate land?
Impalpable forms threw themselves in my path.
Strange cries and wailings led me astray, and all
the while there was a smell like death in my
nostrils, and I knew that I must return or die.
“O, the unutterable anguish of that time ! Ages
seem to pass during which I was fighting with
shadows, until at last I saw a sinking sun, an open
grave, and men whose faces I knew, commencing
to shovel earth on a senseless body.
“ Mine!
“I had felt no pain when my soul left, the
re-entrance of it into its tenement was such infinite
agony, that it forced from me terrible cries that
caused my rescue from suffocation.”
Maxwell paused, and the other two were silent.
“ You will wonder,” ho resumed, “ what all this
has to do with my present journey. I will tell
you. You remember Milford, a surveyor up here,
at one time he was running the boundary-line
between Queensland and South Australia for the
Queensland Government. A year ago I met him,
and we were talking about the country up this
way. In running the line he had to follow the
Nicholson up a good way, until finally he was
completely blocked. He described to me the place
where he had to turn back. It was the water-
hole in the gorge with the two rock-like pillars
rising out of the water.”
Again there was silence for a while, then Davis
said musingly—
“lt’s impossible to pronounce any opinion at
present; the coincidence of Milford’s report is
certainly startling. But why should this sign
have been vouchsafed to you? Apparently this
being you saw was the ghost of some old
Dutch sailor wrecked or marooned here in the
days of the early discovery of Australia. Had
you any ancestors among those gentry ?”
“Not that I am aware of,” returned Maxwell,
“but if we find the place we shall certainly make
some interesting discovery, apart from any gold.”
“ And the girl’s face ?” enquired Bennett.
Maxwell did not answer for a minute or two.
“I may as well tell you all,” he said then; “I
was in Melbourne, after I saw Milford, and I met
a girl with that same face, in the street. Strange,
too, we could not help looking at each other as
though we knew we had met before. That meet-
ing decided me on taking the trip up here. Now,
that is really all. Are you ready for the adven-
ture ?”
“I should think so,” said Davis; “we have
fresh horses at the camp, and nothing to do with
ourselves for three months or more. Please God,
on Christmas Day we’ll be on Tom Tiddler’s
ground picking up gold in chunks.”
“ One question more,” put in Bennett. “ Have
you ever had any return of these trances or cata-
leptic fits?”
“Never since, not the slightest sign of one.”
Chapter 111.
There was no doubt about the strange proof or
coincidence, whichever it should turn out to be.
The three men stood on the bank of the Nicholson
River gazing at the gorge and the waterhole, from
the bosom of which rose the two upright pillars
of rock. Two weeks had elapsed since they were
camped at the lagoon.
“It is the same place,” muttered Maxwell, and,
as the overwhelming horror of his fight through
shadowland came back to him, he leant on his
horse’s shoulder and bowed his head down on the
mane.
Bennett made a sign to Davis and both men
were silent for a while, then D avis spoke—
“ Well, old man, as we are not possessed of the
supernatural power you had when you were last
here, we’ll have to get over that range somehow. ”
Maxwell lifted his head. “We shall have to
tackle the range, but I expect we shall have a job
to get the horses over. How about leaving them
here in hobbles and going up on foot ? ”
“Not to be thought of,” replied Davis; “why,
the niggers’ tracks just back there in the bed of
the river, are as thick as sheep-tracks. The horses
would be speared before we got five miles away. I
know these beggars.”
“ That’s true,” said Bennett.
Davis eyed the range curiously for some time.
“ There’s a spur there that we can work our way
up, I think,” he said at last, indicating with his
hand the spot he meant. The other two, after a
short inspection, agreed with him. It was then
nearly noon, so the horses were turned out for a
couple of hours’ spell, a fire lit and the billy
boiled.
“What dould have led your Dutch sailor up
this way?” said Davis as, the meal over, they were
enjoying an after-dinner pipe.
“That is what has puzzled me. I have read up
everything I could get hold of on the subject of
Dutch discovery and can find no x-ecord of any
ship visiting the Gulf about that date,” replied
Maxwell.
“There may have been plenty of ships here, of
which neither captain nor crew wanted a record
kept. Those were the days of the buccaneers,”
said Bennett.
“Yes, but with the exception of the ship
Dampier was on board of, they did not come out
of their way to New Holland,” returned Maxwell.
“The Bachelor’s Delight and the Cygnet were
on the west coast, as you say ; why not others
who had not the luck to be associated with the
immortal Dampier?”
“True; but the Dutch were not noted as buc-
caneers. However, plenty of ships may have
been lost in the Gulf of which all record has dis-
appeared. The question is, what brought the man
up into this region ?” said Davis.
“ I firmly believe we shall find the clue to that
secret, when we find the ravine. It seems in-
credible that a shipwrecked or marooned man
should have left the sea-coast, whereon was his
only hope of salvation, and have made south into
an unknown land, through such a range as this.”
“Well, boys, we’ll make a start for it,” said
Davis, jumping up; and the party were soon in
their saddles.
The range proved pretty stiff climbing, and
they were so often baulked, and forced to retrace
their steps, that it was sundown before they
reached the top.
It was a desolate outlook for a camp. A rough
tableland of spinifex—evidently extending too far
for them to attempt to go on and descend the
other side before darkness set in—lay before them.
“ Nothing for it but to go on and tie the horses
up all night,” said Bennett. Fortune, however,
favoured them ; in about a mile they came on a
small patch of grass, sufficient for the horses, and
as their water-bags were full, they gladly turned
out.
For a time the conversation turned on their
expectations for the morrow, but gradually it
dropped, as the fire died down. One by one the
stars in their courses looked down through the
openings of the tree-tops on the wanderers sleep-
ing below, and silence, save for the occasional
clink of a hobble, reigned supreme until the first
flush of dawn.
“ Well, Maxwell,” said Davis, as they were dis-
cussing breakfast, “ hear anything from your old
Dutch navigator last night ?”
“No, but I had some confused sort of dream
again about this place; I thought I heard that
voice once more telling me to ‘go back.’ But that,
of course, is only natural.”.
“I think we are close to the spot,” remarked
Bennett. “ When I was after the horses this
morning I could see down into the river, and there
appeared to be an open pocket there.”
Bennett proved right. In half-an-hour’s time
they were scrambling down the range, and soon
stood in an open space that Maxwell at once
identified.
Naturally everybody was slightly excited. Al-
though at first inclined to put the story down to
hallucination, the subsequent events had certainly
shaken this belief in the minds of the two friends.
Maxwell silently pointed to the boulder; there
was something carved on it, but it was worn and
indistinct. Two centuries of weather had almost
obliterated whatever marks had been there.
“They were fresh and distinct when 1 saw
them,” said Maxwell, in an awed voice.
By diligent scrutiny they made out the inscrip-
tion that he had repeated, but had they not
known it the task would have been most difficult.
The words had not been very deeply marked, and
the face of the boulder fronting north-west, the
full force of the wet seasons had been experienced
by the inscription.
“This is a wonderful thing,” said Davis.
“ There can be no doubt as to the age of that.”
“ Let’s go up the ravine and look for the reef
and then get back as soon as possible. I don t
like this place. I wish I had not come, ” returned
Maxwell.
They left the packhorses feeding about and
rode up the gully, taking with them the pick and
shovel they had brought. “It was here, 1 think,"
said Maxwell, looking round; “but the place
seems altered. ”
“ Very likely the creek would change its course
slightly in a couple of hundied years, but not
much. That looks like an outcrop there.”
“ This is the place, ’’ said Maxwell, eagerly, “ I
know it now, but it is is a little changed.”
The three dismounted, and Davis, taking the
pick, struck the cap of the reef with the head of it,
knocking off some lumps of stone. As he did so
a wild “ Holloa !” rang up the gully. All started
and looked at each other with faces suddenly
white and hearts quickly beating. _ There was
something uncanny in such a cry rising out of the
surrounding solitude. .
“Blacks?” said Bennett, doubtfully. Davis
shook his head. Once more the loud shout was
raised, apparently coming from the direction of
the inscribed rock.
“Let’s go and see what it is, anyway,” said
Davis —and they mounted and rode down the
gully again, Bennett, who had picked up a bit of
the quartz, putting it into his saddle-pouch as
they rode along.
Maxwell had not spoken since the cry had been
heard, his face was pale and occasionally he mut-
tered to himself, “ Go back, go back !” The pack-
horses were quietly cropping what scanty grass
there was ; all seemed peaceful and quiet.
“ I believe it was a bird after all; there’s a kind
of toucan makes a devil of a row—have a look
round, old man,” said Davis to Bennett, and they
both rode up and down the bank of the river,
leaving Maxwell standing near the rock where he
had dismounted. Nothing could be seen, and the
two returned and proposed going up the gully
again.
“You fellows go and come back again, I want
to get out of this—l’m upset,” said Maxwell)
speaking for the first time in a constrained voice.
Davis glanced at his friend. “Right you are,
old man, no wonder you don’t feel well; well
just make sure of the reef and come back. If you
want us, fire your pistol; we shan’t be far off.’
The two rode back to their disturbed work and
hastily commenced their examination of the stone.
There was no doubt about the richness of the find,
and the reef could be traced a good distance
without much trouble. They had collected a
small heap of specimens to take back, when sud-
denly the loud “ Holloa !” once more came pealing
up the gully followed instantly by a fainter cry
and two revolver-shots.
Hastily mounting, the two galloped back.
The packhorses, as if startled, were walking
along their tracks towards home, followed by
Max'well’s horse with the bridle trailing; its
rider was stretched on the ground ; nothing else
was visible.
Jumping from their horses they approached the
prostrate man. Both started and stared at each
other with terrorstricken eyes. Before them lay a
skeleton clad in Maxwell’s clothes.
“ Are we mad ?” cried Davis, aghast with
horror.
The fierce sun was above them, the bare moun-
tains around, they could hear the horses clattering
up the range as if anxious to leave the accursed
place, and before them lay a skeleton with the
shrunken skin still adhering to it in places, a
corpse that had been rotting for years ; that had
relapsed into the state it would have been had the
former trance been death. Blind terror seized
them both, and they mounted to follow the horses
when an awful voice came from the fleshless lips :
“ Stay with me, stop ! I may come back ; 1
may—”
Bennett could hear no more, he stuck the spurs
in his horse and galloped off. Davis would have
followed but he was transfixed with terror at what
he saw. The awfuTobject was moving, the out-
cast spirit was striving desperately to reanimate
the body that had suddenly fallen into decay.
The watcher was chained to the spot. Once it
seemed that the horrible thing was really going to
rise, but the struggle was unavailing, with a loud
moan of keenest agony and despair that thrilled
the listeners’ brain with terror it fell back silent
and motionless. Davis remembered nothing more
till he found himself urging his horse up the range.
The place has never been revisited.

In an asylum for the insane in a southern town
there is a patient named Bennett, who is always
talking of the wonderful reef he has up North.
He has a specimen of quartz, very rich, which he
never parts with day or night. He is often
visited by a man named Davis, who nursed him
through a severe attack of fever out on the
Nicholson. The doctors think he may yet le
cover.

Sandy Macpherson’s
Christmas Ride.
Some few years ago, before the picturesque, grey,
box-bark roof on bush-huts had given place to
hard, ugly, angular galvanized iron ; when real,
living shepherds were still in existence, and stock-
men who wore cabbage-tree hats, and made their
own stockwhips instead of buying them from a
store, had not all gone to the main camp, the
following curious incidents took place.
Sandy Macpherson, to give him his full name,
was hut keeping at a small out-station where, just
at the period this story opens, he had only a
couple of stockmen for companions. It was nea r
Christmas time ; an iron drought had set in, and
there was nothing to do but wait for rain and put
off the mustering until more favourable weather.
Under the circumstances, Sandy’s two mates had
got a few weeks’ holiday and gone to the nearest
township to spend it, that is if they had succeeded
in passing the first pub; a matter of doubt.
Sandy was noted as a careful soul who did not
surrender himself to unrestrained joviality at the
festive season. He was reputed to have a stocking
somewhere, and was respected accordingly.
“ Blessed if I’d stop here by myself for a week
or two,” remarked Jim, the younger of the two, as
he said good-bye ere mounting.
“I don’t see much in itto hanker about,’’returned
Sandy; “it’s bound to be lonely, but 111 hav e
my cheque in my pouch after Christmas, and the
publican will have yours. ”
“ But I’ll have some fun as well, old man; and
you won’t be lonely at this time of the year by all
accounts,” was the reply.
“ How’s that, who comes here ?” demanded the
hutkeeper.
“ Some queer coves, according to all accounts,
especially when they find a man alone,” and Jim
waved his hand and cantered after his companion,
leaving Sandy rather perplexed.
The out-station was twenty miles from the head
station. No other road led to it. To the West and
North lay an unoccupied waste, and Sandy pon-
dered over Jim’s parting words without finding
any clue to them. In the older days the blacks
had been troublesome, but now they were all gone,
so there was no harm to be apprehended from
them.
Sandy turned into the hut and prepared for a
fortnight’s laziness. He had laid in a couple of
bottles of whisky which, as he was a temperate
man, would last him till after the new year; he
had the usual station-luxuries if he liked thus to
enlarge his account, and the super, had sent him
out a big bundle of old newspapers, so he felt
equal to the occasion and dismissed his com.
panion’s words as idle.
Nothing happened in any way to disturb him or
his serenity until Christmas Eve came round;
and Sandy had by that time to acknowledge that
solitude was a trifle monotonous. The summer
night was moonless and dark, the mosquitoes were
bad, and Sandy pricked up his slush-lamp, covered
up his fire, and retired under the mosquito-net he
had rigged round his bunk, taking with him a
paper to read himself to sleep.
His eyelids were just commencing to get heavy
when he was aroused by the tramp of a horse
outside, then came the noise of a man dismount-
ing ; and before Sandy could get outside his care-
fully-tucked-in net, the door was opened and a
stranger walked in.
Sandy was a slow-going fellow who took things
coolly, so he returned the stranger’s greeting as a
matter of course, and with the usual bush hos-
pitality made up the fire and put the billy on.
The new-comer was a silent man, with a large
red beard, and as he turned his head Sandy saw a
livid weal or bruise encircling his neck.
After a few remarks intimating that he was a
traveller wanting a night’s shelter, he went out
again, and Sandy heard him unsaddling and
hobbling his horse; then he returned. He ate
like a hungry man, but seemed to have an un-
accountable difficulty in swallowing, and spoke
little during his meal. Twice Sandy asked him
where he came from without getting any reply,
until, on a third repetition, the new-comer told
him curtly that it was no business of his, and a
somewhat irksome silence ensued.
“You can take that bunk, mate,” said Sandy,
stiffly, to break the spell, indicating the one
belonging to the absent Jim.
“Thanks,” said the stranger; “if you don’t
mind my keeping the fire going I’ll sit up a bit—l
don’t feel sleepy.”
“Must be warm where you came from,” re-
turned Sandy,” “when you want a fire su<J> a
night as this.”
“It is hot,” said the traveller, grimly.
Under cover of the mosquito-net Sandy lay and
watched his taciturn guest. The man sat upon
the rude slab bench with his chin in his hands
gazing into the fire with an unwinking stare that
made the watcher in the bunk feel that he should
like very much to get up and seek some Dutch
courage in a moderate drain. This could not be
thougnt of, he could scarcely infringe the custom
of hospitality so far as to drink by himself with-
out offering the other man anything.
So Sandy lay quiet, and was dropping off into a
doze when a movement of the stranger aroused
him.
The man had turned slightly, and Sandy saw
distinctly that little drops of blood were oozing
from the discoloured bruise on his neck and run-
ning on to the collar of his shirt, where they
merged into another and a deeper stain.
Sandy was horrified, and when the man pre-
sently rose, he almost gave a nervous start and a
cry, but he restrained himself. The stranger
looked towards the darker portion of the hut,
which was of some length, and shook his fist at a
shadowy tie-beam just visible. Sandy’s horror-
stricken gaze followed in the same direction and
could he believe his eyes ? —a rope with a noose
at the end of it dangled from the beam !
“Get up, Sandy Macpherson,” cried the visitor,
in a terrified voice, “and don’t lie shaking there
any longer. I’m the man who hung himself here
four years ago this Ohristmas-eve. Get up, for
I’ve got work for you.”
He made a stride as though to second his in-
lunction, and Sandy, with a quaking heart,
•lipped out on to the earthen floor.
“ Now, look hole. To-morrow morning, sharp
;en, you get a horse up and ride to Murderer’s
Camp— you know it —where all the niggers wer e
shot one Ohristmas-day, as you’ve heard tell of.
I did most of that, and their black ghosts worried
me till, at last, I up and hung myself. You go
and watch on that camp all Christmas-day until
daylight next morning, and say a bit of a prayer
for me, and mayhap I’ll get some rest. If not —-
if you don’t obey me—l’ll haunt you, and hunt
you, until you follow my example.” And hC
pointed with threatening finger to the shadowy
beam and dangling noose.
The red-bearded man did not wait for any
answer—in fact, Sandy could not have made one,
his teeth chattered so. He watched his awful
visitor open the door and close it after him ; then
he thought of the whisky. He got the bottle,
took a deep draught without using a pannikin,
and sank down on to his bunk half stupid and
half asleep.
The sun was shining when he awoke, and he
sprung up and looked about him. The rope and
noose resolved itself into an ordinary halter
thrown over the tie-beam, though Sandy could not
for the life of him remember having seen it there
before. There was certainly a low tide in the
whisky bottle, but he could not determine whether
the bread and beef were in the same condition as
before the stranger’s visit.
His spirits fell, however, when he found the
unmistakeable fresh tracks of a horse outside the
verandah. But if his visitor was a ghost, how did
he come to ride a horse that made tracks ? There
could be no error, as he had swept all around the
hut since the two men left. This thought struck
Sandy very hard, and he sat down to work it out.
As a Highlander, Sandy was slightly super-
stitious, but he had plenty of sense notwith-
standing ; and he felt very sore at being caught
unprepared and having showed the white feather.
“It’s some lark of the fellows at the station,”
he muttered to himself; “going to make me
spend Christmas out on Murderer’s Camp and
then chiak me about it. Not if I know it.”
Then a new thought struck him. The red-
bearded man was certainly none of the station
men, nor anybody from anywhere about. He
was a stranger, and not anybody he knew in
disguise; he had looked
at him too well for that
—no man can disguise his
eyes. He knew the yarn
of Murderer’s Camp, and
how men, gins and
piccaninies h ad been ruth-
lessly slaughtered there;
but he never heard of
anyone committing sui-
cide in the hut, and he
began to doubt it.
After referring for
advice to the sadly-
diminished whisky-bottle
he made up his mind.
He would go to Mur-
derer’s Camp, it was
eight miles up the river.
He would wait there
until dark; then he would
come back quietly and
try to bite the biters.
Sandy had a horse of
his own in the paddock.
As a hutkeeper’s hors p

ING TO HIS FOLLY.”

FRUITERER: “Only round ones.”
should be, it was fat and fresh, and Sandy, with
a supply of food, mental and otherwise, and an
allowance of the second bottle of whisky—
broached, alas ! before its time—was soon on his
way up the river.
Arrived at the Camp, he tied his horse up, for
it was too fresh to trust in hobbles so near home.
He then passed the day reading his newspapers
and smoking. He kept his eyes about him but
could not say for certain that any one was watch-
ing him, although at times his horse cocked its ears
and whinnied suspiciously.
Night came on, and Sandy cautiously stole
away leading his horse and listening intently every
now and then. But he heard no sound, and soon
mounted and turned his willing steed homeward.
When within a mile or two of the hut, the
familiar sound of cattle came to him on the faint
wind. To a trained ear the noise made by cattle
when freshly yarded is as distinct as possible from
any sound they make when at large. “ Cattle in
the yard,” thought Sam. “And on Christmas
Day ; what can be up ?”
The stockyard was on his way, and he rode up
to it. Although only hut-keeping, he had been
too long knocking about cattle stations not to
know the routine of the work.
The continued drought had deferred mustering
so long that many of the unbranded calves were
between six and twelve months old. At least two
hundred cows with calves of the age above men-
tioned had been yarded and drafted apart into
different yards. The mothers were bewailing
their lot at one end of the stockyard, and their
children gnashing their teeth at the other.
Sandy grasped the situation at once ; there was
no room for doubt left. A raid had been made by
a gang of cattle-duffers, and his absence had been
desired in order that they might utilise the yard
for drafting purposes; for, in spite of the tall
blowing of some bush hands, no one has ever yet,
in a satisfactory manner, succeeded in drafting
weaners from their mothers on a camp.
The men at the head station were keeping
Christmas, and he was supposed to be keeping
watch on Murderer’s Camp. He rode round the
yard, thinking of these matters, amidst the furious
bellowings going on, and fhcn his attention was
arrested by two things.
On the gallows hung a freshly-killed beast, and
in the yard immediately alongside were some ten
or twelve horses.
More than that. As ho ranged up alongside the
rails, a head, familiar to him in the clear star-
light, was thrust through and exchanged familiar
equine greetings with the horse he was riding.
He at once recognised the familiar front of
Boomerang, the well-known racehorse belonging
to the head station. Probably the others were
station horses, but it was too dark to determine.
, ~ _ i it.
His first impulse was to t r , .P
rails, let horses and cattle go, anc ' ,
his life, and had he done so e f u
saved a bitter experience. But us , ,
of rage at the way he had been fooled, and he
made up his mind to identify men who had
played the trickonhirn, at whatever P / ; •
lie rode towards the hut, an , , .
some distance off crept cautiously up at the hade
and peered through the ill-httmg s a s.
A strong smell of fried steak proved that some-
body had usurped his billet. A party of five men
were seated at the table eating and drinking from
the iron plates and tin pannikins he had so often
cleaned. Listening, he heard their talk was ot
him. Redbeard was at the head of the table, and
with much humour was describing his ghostly
experience with Sandy the night before.
“I give you my word, boys, lies out at Mur-
derer’s Camp now shaking in his shoes and pray-
ing that all hands and the cook up above will take
pity on the soul of yours truly.”
“How did you fix him?’ said one.
“ With a painted mark round my neck and my
own devil’s humour. It was the greatest fun
out.”
Sandy listened with ears cooked to the fullest
extent, but shortly his attention was taken up by
a man sitting opposite to the crack through winch
he was taking observation. This man’s face was
familiar to him. He had just served a sentence
of ten years for cattle-stealing accompanied with
armed violence. Sandy knew him before he was
sentenced ; knew him for the best rider in the
district, and the most dreaded scoundrel. As he
watched the lowering eyes and dogged, sullen
manner, the man spoke.
“Now, boys ! Time flies, and we must shape.
That blanky fool may be safe at Murderer’s Camp
or he may not; we don’t know. Meantime, we
must make sure. Two of you get up to the yard
and let the weaners out and steady them there
as well as you can until we come, and catch our
horses.”
Sandy’s nerve betrayed him; he might have
crept quietly off in the darkness under cover of
the noisy bellowing going on at the yard, but he
felt that the murderous eye of the black-muzzled
ruffian opposite was on him, and that discovery
meant death. In an instant the reins were over
his horse’s neck, his foot in the stirrup, and the
next he was galloping for dear life over the flat.
Shouts, and a couple of shots, told him he was
discovered. The two men who had their horses
saddled-up started in pursuit. Fortunately for
Sandy, both he and his horse knew the bridle-
track to the station, and his pursuers did not.
One of them came to grief in a tree, and the other
soon dropped behind, for the cook’s horse was
fresh and, thanks to being tied up all day on the
camp, in good fettle for a run.
Sandy galloped on three or four miles and then
pulled up to listen. Silence? No! the distant
noise of a horse. A sudden conviction shot
through Macpherson’s mind, it was the man he
dreaded, mounted on Boomerang. He was lost;
the horse was the fastest in the district, and the
man who rode it, a demon with cat’s eyes that
could see on the darkest night, a man who could
stick to anything that was ever foaled. The cook
stuck the spurs m his nag and the race was com-
menced. A deep sandy creek intervened about
half way, and as he eased his horse over the
shingle, under the gloomy sheoaks, it seemed to
him that his enemy must be right on the top of
him, in spite of the long start he had got.
On, for another mile or two, and then Sandy
thought that his only chance was to turn and
fight, for his game little horse showed signs
of caving, and took the spur without flinching.
Suddenly he remembered that about six miles
from the station there was a short cut across a
rocky boulder-strewn hill. If he could turn off
there, his pursuer might keep on the main track
and miss him, so with eyes strained and heart
beating he pushed on, while the clatter of Boomer-
ang’s hoofs drew nearer and nearer.
At last there was a turn in the roan and a dead
tree that he knew; the short Cut was close at
hand, none too soon, for now the other horse was
within 200 yards. His horse know the short cut
as well as he did, and turned off of his own accord.
Up the stony hill and down the other side, and then
he pulled up and listened anxiously. His pursuer
must have kept on. No, great God ! here he was
c ose to him and with a mad, excited whinny,
Boomerang dashed up to him-riderless.
Sandy felt like fainting for a moment, the
tension had been pretty sharp, but he recovered
himself and listened eagerly ; save the hurried
panting of the two horses the night was still as
death. Boomerang had a saddle on, so he must
have been ridden, but Sandy had no intention of
enquiring after the fate of the rider at present,
and leading the racehorse he made his way onto
the stat i on

Sandy’s pursuer was lying there with his neck
broken. It had been a very near thing after all.
Boomerang had turned instinctively to follow the
other horse along the short cut, his rider had
pulled him off, and the racer had blundered and
rolled over on the unfortunate man, who was the
one Sandy had dreaded,

LITTLE NUGGET.
A Record of Old Forest Creek.
BY VINOENT PYRE,
Author of “ Wild Will Enderby, "&C., &c.
(For Thu Bulletin.)
1851.
W \ ’ m LOVELIER valley than
11 jjmtkra Forest Creek, as I first
saw it in the early spring
of 1851, was not to be
found in all the broad expanse of Australia. The
summer heat had not yet scorched the tender
green of its grassy dells and soft reaches, and
the stream brightly sparkled in the sunlight as it
wound in and out and around the gently sloping
hills. Valiev and hills alike were decked with
noble gums —red and white, interspersed with
occasional box and peppermint trees, and stately
ironbarks reared their lofty columns in the higher
ridges; in sequestered nooks silver watth 9
scattered their fragrance on the warm air, and
the more rare golden acacias, often adorned with
the beautiful purple blossoms of the native sarsa-
parilla climbing lovingly around their slender
stems, delighted the twin senses of sight and
smell.
The ruthless axes of the inrushing gold-seekers
quickly denuded the forest, and the upturning of
the soil, in their eager search for its hidden
treasures, desecrated Nature’s verdant carpet and
polluted the stream ; but some lingering vestiges
of its pristine beauty remained for many years.
We were all “new-chums,” though we carefully
concealed the fact, dreading the term of blank!ty
dash “ jimmygrants ” applied to new arrivals by
“the fifty thousand vagabonds assembled round the
Mount ” (Alexander, be it understood). If a man
had not burgled his mother-in-law, or married
two sisters, stolen a horse, broken the game laws,
or perpetrated some equally atrocious deed he
“didn’t count for much,” as a gentleman from
“the other side” (a polite euphemism for Van
Dieman’s Land) once observed to me.
Yes ; we belonged to the despicable class of new-
chums ; but we flaunted it as bravely as the oldest
hand in “brab”hats and “Sydney streamers,”
serge shirts, and moleskin continuations. We
called to mind the stories that had delighted us in
boyhood, and felt that in a sort of way we were
adventurous heroes —across between Captain Kidd
and Sinbad the Sailor; and truly there was a
charm and an excitement in that wild life that I
fairly revelled in, and would fain experience over
again.
Tom, Dick, and Harry—I don’t care to particu-
larise them —were my shipmates in the old
Candahar, Captain Goss commander—144 days
out from London, and our companionship at sea
resulted in comradeship on land. Tom is a grey-
headed lawyer of good repute in Melbourne now,
and Harry is an opulent station-owner in Northern
Queensland, but Dick—cheerful, merry-hearted
Dick —was crushed to death in a “ drive ” at the
Turon. And then it came out that he was the
heir-presumptive to an English peerage—the
descendant of a very famous English admiral, who
upheld the honour of the British flag in the old
Dutch wars. After Dick’s death a Sydney
Israelite, in whom there was no guile, went up to
Government House, and produced the family
medals presented by a grateful nation to the naval
hero, and Sir Charles Fitzroy (so it was reported)
redeemed them and sent them back to the family
in England. There were plenty of such men—
men of “ good family” —knocking about in those
days, when gold raining had somewhat the aspect
of a prolonged picnic, and the adventurous life
had a charm unknown to the plodding miners of
these degenerate times.
None of us had any experience in the wielding
of picks and shovels, nor in tent-fixing and other
useful accomplishments, and we little dreamt of
gold-mining when we left old England, and tried
not to feel miserable when the Lizard light went
out of sight, and did feel as miserable as anyone
could wish when we got into the chopping waters
of the Bay of Biscay. But whilst we were crawling
over the sea, the “ root of all evil ” —which is just
the seed of all good—had been discovered and the
news of Forest Creek had reached Melbourne when
we anchored in Hobson’s Bay,
After sundry migrations we pitched our tent in
a little glade—a mere dimple in the ranges — which
had several attractions for us. In the first place,
it was apart from the diggings—overlooking them
from a slight rock-bound elevation, at the fo t of
which oozed a tiny spring of cool, pure water—an
important; consideration now that a summer sun
was blazing and water was selling at half-a-crown
a bucket. Another attraction was the seclusion
of our chosen camping-ground. There was only
one other tent in the gully, and the tent-keeper
was a neat, motherly woman (women of any sort
were scarce on the diggings), whose appearance
satisfied us of the respectability of the surround-
ings. We discovered afterwards that her boarders
wereVandemonians of the deepest dye, and that she
was another. But they were very good neighbours
for all that; and indeed I always found that the
safest “ pitch ” was in the immediate vicinity of
this class. They had an unwritten code of some
sort, one of the articles of which, scrupulously ob-
served, was—“Thou shalt not rob thy neighbour,
but only him who is at a distance from thee,” and
1 never knew this commandment to be broken.
The range behind us—densely timbered —had a
low saddle, which led into Donkey Gully, where
there were some considerable workings, but it was
not often used, as it was out of the ordinary route.
But one fine morning an incident occurred to
break the monotony of our We had
been firing off our pistols ere reloading them;
also to let all whom it concerned understand that
we had arms and ammunition at command. The
general—I might say the universal —practice en
the diggings was to fire off pistols and guns at
sundown, and what with the discharge of firearms,
the barking of dogs, and hoarse shouting of men,
there was every evening as pretty a how-d’ye-do
as could be desired But, being of the despised
new-chum species, We regarded the business of
firing off as being more appropriate and impressive
in the morning, when the stillness was unbroken
save by the rocking of multitudinous cradles,
which sent up a commingled roar as of many fac-
tories at work. Moreover, we wanted to be expert
shots, and, therefore, we blazed away at a barked
target on a gum-tree about thirty yards away up
the gully. That tree was not much injured by
our experimental warfare ; but, then, our weapons
were “pepper-boxers”—so-called—revolvers with
six barrels, and in my own case a pair of toy*
pistols, carrying ballets a little larger than swan-
shot, and only dangerous to the user. Well, we
had wastefully expended our ammunition as usual
on that particular morning, and seated ourselves
contentedly on a log in front of the fire to enjoy
the flavour and fragrance of the morning pipe,
when down the gully came a dainty youngster
with “ new chum ” written all over him in
unmistakeable character’s. He was a dapper
youth, apparently about eighteen years of age
—certainly not more, short in stature and of
slender figure, and he wore his hair in long curly
locks—a fashion much affected at that time—
which gave him rather an effeminate appearance.
We stared at seeing anyone coming from that
direction. Such an event had never happened
before.
“Good morning, gentlemen,” said the stranger;
and he spoke in a soft, mellow, voice that in some
way touched a chord of sympathy. Evidently he
was a very “ new chum,” for that was not exactly
the sort of language in vogue amongst the habitues
of Forest Creek.
We returned his polite salutation, and then said
he— “I beg your pardon; but have you been
firing up the gully ? ”
We admitted the soft impeachment.
“Well,” quoth our visitor, with a pleasant
smile and a rather sarcastic twinkle of his
eyes, “you were nearly the death of me—
look at this.” And he showed us a bullet-
“ I have been hunting, too, and here is the game I have bagged .”
hole in the loose folds of his serge shirt, in peril-
ous proximity to the region of the heart.
It is unnecessary to tell how profusely we
apologised. The end of it was that the stranger
sat down on our log, and drank a pannikin of tea
with us. Smoke he would not. He said tobacco
disagreed with him. Bit by bit, he told us how
he was working all by himself just over the range,
and not having struck anything good he had
strolled over our way, on the look-out for some-
thing better. We were so well pleased with his
appearance and pleasant manner that we forth-
with proposed he should “chum in” with our
selves. But no ; he preferred to be alone, only, if
we had no objection, he would like to pitch his
tent near ours. And when we came back for the
midday meal he was busy fixing a picanniny tent,
with a luxurious stretcher and —above all things
—a camp-stool for furniture.
From that time forth he was our companion.
But he always wrought by himself—going away
in the morning with a tin-dish and an attenuated
pick and shovel that looked more like playthings
than implements of labour, yet he managed to
gather a fair average quantity of gold in his own
fashion. He seemed very pleased when we asked
him to join our mess. Indeed after one timid
offer to attend to the flesh-pots—the camp-oven
and frying-pan—he succeeded so well that we
unanimously elected him chief cook and bottle-
washer of the establishment, and remitted his
share of the expenses in consideration of his
culinary services. Such unexpected dainties as he
used to turn out for our delectation— such savoury
pancakes and tender “ dough-boys ” and luxurious
“ plum-duff ! ” Nothing very epicurean, it is true,
but the health-inspiring vocation of the miner and
the bushman makes delicacies of many things that
are “common to the general.”
Very soon Joe —that was the only name he gave
—became quite a pet with us. Only Dick would
persist in calling him “ Missy,” on account of his
effeminate appearance, and Joe did not like this
at all. I remember one evening when Dick had
been more than usually aggressive in this way,
Joe —flashing an angry glance at' him from his
dark blue evee—ociea out: “ Why do yew inwilt
me ? Am I not as good a man as any ei you 1 I
will shift my tent in the morning.”
And then we fell upon Dick, and made his life
very uncomfortable until he apologised to Joe,
and promised, like a good little boy, never to do it
any more. After that Dick was mighty civil to
our pet, and always wanted to be doing this thing
and the other for him. But Joe would have none
of it. Harry—the surly old bear, as we regarded
him, who was about as taciturn a member of the
human brotherhood as I ever chanced to meet —
was Joe’s favourite. Harry never “fussed.” He
would fetch logs for the fire, and water for the
“ billy,” and all without speaking a word, except
when Joe would thank him. That seemed to
irritate him. “What’s the use of bothering?”—
he would growl. “Ain’t I better able to do it
than a boy like you?” And then Joe, never
taking offence, would laugh and sing a snatch of
the milkmaid’s song—“ Nobody axed you, sir, she
said.”
Altogether Joe was a puzzler. After many
serious consultations over our pip s, we came to
the conclusion that he came of good stock, and
had run away from home in some boyish freak.
We were not far astray in this conjecture, as it
afterwards turned out. Remember, the eldest of
us was actually twenty-four years of age, and we
felt and reasoned like the “grave and reverend
seigniors ”we believed ourselves to be. lam sure
that one at least of us felt more sedate and
Solomon-like in those far-off days than now.
One of the youngster’s fancies was the accumu-
lation of nuggets. He had a positive passion for
the shining lumps of gold. One day I chanced
upon a nugget of about two ounces weight. It
was shaped somewhat like a pear with a small
hole at the thin end, and freckled with specks of
milk-white quartz. Joe’s eyes-always as bright
as a stag’s—actually danced with delight when I
exhibited it. He ran away to his tent, and bring-
ing the match-box—the little wooden cylinder
then in use—in which he kept his stores, he
begged me to give it to him in exchange for an
equal weight of gold. Now, I wanted to keep it
for a certain young person ; but somehow Joe
always had his own way, and he coaxed me into
making the transfer. He got a fresh nickname
through this affair. Mischievous Dick bestowed
it on him, and he was as often called “ Little
Nugget ” as by his own name thenceforth.
One day Joe disappeared. When morning
dawned the lithe young figure was missing from
the camp-fire. “ The young rascal is asleep,”
said Tom, and, “I’ll soon rouse the little beggar,”
cried Dick. But Harry, saying never a word,
strode over to Joe’s tent; after shouting in vain
for the owner to “Come out of that,” he untied
the fastenings of the entrance, and tumbled in,
only to tumble out again, muttering a savage im-
precation. “By Jove! he has bolted,” said he,
“ blankets and all.” And so he had, and we saw
nothing of him that day, nor the next, nor for
many days thereafter.
Now, it was a curious thing, but it so happened
that we became very cross and cantankerous after
Joe’s disappearance. Something seemed to have
gone out of our lives, and we bickered with each
other—quarrelling would be too strong a phrase—
without provocation—aye, and over our pipes,
too. Joe had so thoroughly wound his way into
our hearts that each of us felt his absence as a
personal affliction, and we roundly abused one
another for having been the cause of his depar-
ture. Mutual recrimination on this score was
ceaseless, but neither of us would own to having
given the youngster any offence. I had a sneak-
ing suspicion which I prudently kept to myself,
because Dick was a much more muscular Chris-
tian than I, that he had been making too free
with his jibes and jeers for Joe’s patience. Cer-
tainly the absconder was but a poor sort of
“molly-coddle” in my superior estimation ; but
I loved the lad with the patronising kind of affec-
tion that one bestows on pets—human and other-
wise.
However, one evening, just as the sun was set-
ting behind piled-up banks of purple clouds,
barred and flecked with stripes and patches of
crimson and gold, Master Joe came daintily trip-
ping down the gully, and bade us “ good-day !” as
placidly as if he had just stepped out from his
tent hard by.
“ Good day, mates !” said he, as cool as a cucum-
ber, slipping his “ swag ” easily to the ground;
“ have you any tea in the billy ?”
And with a swift deft motion, all his own, he
took a pannikin, and helped himself without more
ado.
“ Wall, I’m blessed exclaimed Harry ; and al
of us cried, “ Well, I’n. ,” filling in the hiatus
in divers ways, according to our various moods.
“ Where have you been, you daft young gipsy?’*
queried Harry. “Do you know we have been
scouring the country for you, and should have set
the “traps” on your track only they’re so busy
digger-hunting that they can’t attend to anything
less important—yourself, for instance?”
The young fellow absolutely blushed at this
rude speech; but, quickly recovering himself, he
said : “1 have been hunting, too, and here is the
game I have bagged. ”
And he field up for our inspection a nugget of
about 12 ounces, as we gauged it with our experi-
enced eyes. A fine lump it was—solid and un-
mixed with quartz. Shall I confess it? I felt
envious of Joe’s luck. Here were we, pegging
away in a beastly hole some fourteen feet deep, to
work in which was reckoned a reckless risk of
death and danger in those days, when six, or at
the most, eight feet was as far as the ordinary
digger cared to venture into “the bowels of the
land.” And all we had gotten for our pains, after
six weeks’ toil and trouble —our sore hand-blister-
ing and back-aching exertions —was less than a
half of Joe’s handsome nugget.
“Look here, now,” quoth Dick, “you had
better give that to the preacher chap next Sun-
day.”
Now, “ the preacher chap,” as Dick irreverently
called him, was an elderly man of unctuous
speech and oily appearance from the crown of his
hat to the soles of his boots, with special additions
of grease about the collar and cuffs of his rusty
black coat, and the bulging knees of his still
rustier trousers. He used to mount a stump
whenever he could collect an audience and deliver
a sort of religious discourse, liberally sprinkled
with invocations to the Deity, and promises of hot
weather in the next world, interspersed with
surely the most doleful of all possibly doleful
hymns. Whether he was a sincere enthusiast or
not I cannot tell, but as the principal part of these
al fresco services “lay in the application thereof,”
which consisted in the business known as “ send-
ing round the hat,” it seemed to me that the
worship of Mammon rather unduly'predominated.
None of us believed in him. Tom denounced him
as “a fraud,” Dick said he was “a precious old
humbug,” Harry (whose father was a rural dean
at home) called him “an impostor.” As for Joe,
he positively detested the man. Dick’s suggestion,
therefore, was not well received by our young
friend. “No,” he said, “if I give it to anyone
someone I love shall have it.”
The expression did not strike us as curious at
the time, but it did afterwards.
“Don’t keep it about the tent, Joe,” said I;
“ sell it or take it to the bank, or you will have
such little brains as you possess rudely scattered
if it should be suspected that there is such a prize
in your possession.”
(Par parenthlse, I may say that the Bank of
New South Wales then flew its blue flag over a
tent in “the Camp” at “ the Junction ” as the
confluence of Forest and Barker’s Creek was
■ designated.)
“Thank you. Jack ” —I was Jack—“thank you
for the compliment. It is very nice of you to say
that, but I don’t care to part with my pretty
nuggets for fifty shillings an ounce ” —the then
current price on the creek. And with that he
broke out in a peal of merry, boyish laughter,
shaking his sunny curls from his forehead ; and I
pictured to myself some dear home in the far-off
mother-land of which he had perhaps been the
pride. Boor lad ! he was so very young in all his
ways to be alone, save for us, his chance friends,
in the great wilderness of the South.
Our happy days in Centipede Gully (that was
the name we gave it, for hundreds of excellent
reasons) came to an end all too soon. Of course
the primal cause was woman. One fine morning
when we went down to our spring, we found to
our dismay that two intruding fiends, in the guise
of washerwomen, had cet up a laundry there and
defiled the only drinkable water in the neighbour-
hood. To this day I owe those women a grudge,
for it caused the breaking-up of our pleasant
party. We had to use other and impure
water —muddy, and charged with mineral matter.
The result was that we all suffered, more or less,
from illness, and Dick worst of all. So he
set out in search of a doctor. There were
plenty around, but most of them were more pro-
fitably engaged in sluicing gold than in drenching
patients. However, Dick found a tent on Bed
Hill, on which appeared a written calico sign—
“ Jeremiah Rogers, Docter ” (so it was spelled).
On inquiring for the “Docter ” he was introduced
to a burly fellow in a red serge shirt, with sleeves
tucked up to the elbows, and a dripping sheath-
knife in his mouth, busily engaged in “dressing”
a sheep. Putting a grimy hand on Dick’s pulse,
pounding him in the ribs, making him show his
tongue, and performing other antics peculiar to
the profession, “Docter” Rogers first demanded
a sovereign and then prescribed brandy.
Now, at that time, total prohibition was the law
on the gold-fields. Licenses for the sale of liquor
were not allowed to be issued for any house
situated within five miles of the gold-fields’
boundary. As a natural result, grog - shanties
flourished in great numbers. None of us had ever
entered these dens ; so where to get brandy Dick
did not know. He explained the difficulty to the
“ docter.”
“Oh. well, said that eminent practitioner, wip-
ing his knife on his moleskin continuations, “I
keep a small quantity for medicinal purposes, and
as you are really very bad I’ll let you have a bottle
for two pounds.”
Dick paid the price demanded by the shanty-
keeping doctor, and brought it to the camp.
There he warmed some water, put in some of the
drugged medicinal brandy, added sugar also, and
drank the villainous stuff with much apparent
relief and satisfaction. He beamed so brightly
over it, and the fumes from his pannikin were so
pleasant that we all wanted some of his medicine.
More than that, by unanimous consent we took,
and partook of it, until we became first cheerful,
then hilarious, then controversial, then angry,
and finally wound up with a regular breakmg-up
quarrel.
In this unhappy business Joe had no part. He
made a grimace when the steaming poison was
passed round to him, and, putting it aside, fled to
the refuge of his own tent. “It isn’t good,
Harry,” he cried—Harry was always his favourite
—“ It isn’t good. Don’t drink it! ”
“ I can’t make that youngster out at all,” said
Dick. “He doesn't smoke, and he won’t drink,
and he is as squeamish as a school-miss.”
“No,” growled Harry, “I don’t suppose you
can make him out. You see he has been brought
up, and you were only dragged up.”
Then Dick, with the blood of his fighting
ancestry surging in his veins, knocked Harry back
over the log we were sitting on, sending the scald-
ing liquor into his face. A rough-and-tumble
fight ensued, in which we all got mixed up some-
how. Everybody hammered away at the most
proximate body without discrimination, quite
content to hit somebody. Suddenly Joe rushed
fn amcmgwb us and dragged Harry out erf the


tangle without a word, and we saw them no more
that night. In truth we were all very thankful for
this seasonable interruption of our too-animated
discussion, and we adjourned to seek repose in
We met next morning all sullen, downcast, and
ashamed. With few words we divided our stock
0 { gold and dissolved partnership. Tom wended
his way to Melbourne and went in for the practice
of his profession like a sensible man. Dick
migrated to the Turon. Said Harry to me : “ What
are you going to do ? ” 1 told him I should follow
suit, and so I did, for Dick and I went round to
Sydney together. .
I sadly wanted Joe to come with us. .1 was
vexed and somewhat dispirited, thinking of the
bright little lad remaining, all alone, amongst the
rough crowd of diggers. “Come with us, Little
Nugget,” I urged, “ we will take care of you, be
Bl Joe only tossed his saucy head, and laughed
with a musical, rippling laugh, that somehow
made me more sad than tears would have done.
« Don’t you think I can take care of myself ?” he
asked. “ Only do one thing before you go. See
me safe to the camp with my gold, and when you
are gone, I’ll go and gather more nuggets. I mean
to have quite a number, I assure you.”
We volunteered to go in a body as an escort with
Little Nugget, but he said : “Oh ! one is enough.
You go with me, Harry.”
And so it was arranged, and the rest of us
shouldered our swags and started for Melbourne,
Harry promising to overtake us if we went slowly.
We did go slowly—very slowly—but Harry never
overtook us. And I thought I had lost sight of
Joe and Harry for ever.
1852.
After a brief spell Dick and I started for the
Sydney goldfields, where we worked at Ophir and
the Turon. But luck was against us, and I wended
my way back to Melbourne while Dick found his
fate in the way Ihave narrated. Just as Igotthere
the first escort from Eaglehawk came in with nearly
seven tons of gold, guarded by a corps of pen-
sioners, or “military settlers,” as they were
termed, who had been brought over from Van
Dieman’s Land to do duty in the absence of the
regular police. I witnessed their arrival at the old
Treasury in William-street, after their many days
patient plodding through the bush. Hardy old
veterans they were, some with only one arm, and
others with wooden legs, but the boldest bushranger
would have reckoned the cost twice be f ore ven-
turing to encounter them. This sight induced me
to try my fortune at Bendigo, first and properly
known as “ Bandicoot ” Creek. But I had a diffi-
culty in finding mates, for I was rather particular
as to whom I foregathered with, having a well-
grounded objection to consorting with strangers
of dubious antecedents, who might find it con-
venient or profitable to sever my carotid artery,
or drop me into a waterhole. Some days, there-
fore, passed and found me still mooning about
Melbourne. I sought out Tom, but he was
immersed in Chitty and Blackstone, and would
not listen. “ I’ve had enough of digging,” he
averred; “gold is all very well in the concrete,”
said he, “ but I prefer it in the abstract.”
“That is contrary to the old proposition,”
quoth I. ...
“Ah! yes; but if my clients get it in the
concrete I can more easily abstract it.” And
with that he returned to his musty parchments
and precedents.
But the very next morning, as luck would have
it, whilst I was breakfasting at the old Royal
Hotel in Collins-street (afterwards the Criterion,
and now a bank) a hand was laid on my shoulder
pot lightly—l was almost surprised into choking
by the concussion—and a well-known voice saluted
me _“ Well, Jack, old boy ! how goes it?”
I jumped up in impulsive ecstacy. The voice
was the voice of Harry, and the hand was his
also.
We were so glad to meet that we made a long
day of it. We called in the solitary waiter, who
was nearly all that remained of the establishment,
and commenced proceedings by ordering in not
champagne, for champagne was a, vulgar liquor in
those days, but beer —real, British bottled beer,
charged for at the rate of about a crown a bottle,
from each of which, with the infectious recklessness
of the period, we only poured one glass, disdaining
the remainder. When we were tired of that we
went about the town and developed other eccen-
tricities; and in the evening we patronised the
dingy hole called a theatre, in Queen-street, ad-
joining the St. John’s Tavern, kept by the re-
doubtable John Thomas, who afterwards bloomed
into a perennial Mayor of Melbourne. And in
that pandemonium we saw the Young family gesti-
culating on the stage, amidst an indescribable up-
roar that prevented anything being heard, and
narrowly escaping annihilation from the empty
bottles and other missiles playfully tossed about
by the occupants of the dress-circle. They threw
gold about, too, but that was reserved for those
performers who danced or ranted to their satis-
faction. Otherwise, when they failed to come up
to the mark, bottles made them understand that
better things were expected of them.
Next day we had cogent private reasons for not
being very merry. However, in the afternoon we
did to business seriously incline, and made a com-
pact fast and sure to go once more together on the
gold path.
“And what about Joe —our Little Nugget? ”
“Ah ! ” said Harry ; “ that’s a mystery. Do
you know I was very fond of that little beggar,
and, by Jove ! —yes —well, I lost him.”
“Lost him! Lost Joe!” I cried. “Please
explain.”
r< Well,’ said Harry, “ I believe that nugget of
yours was the primary cause of the mischief. ou
remember I went with him to lodge his gold in
the bank. He would not sell it outright, but got
a small advance on it, and he kept back the nugget
that he wheedled you out of.
( “ When he came out of the bank he said :
' Harry, I have not had any letter since I came
to the Creek, and I am sure there are some waiting
tor me somewhere. ’
“ I asked him if he had given his address at the
Melbourne Post-office, and ho told me he had.
‘Did you tell Captain King to inquire for you at
Kyneton ?’ I asked again. You know ‘ Captain ’
King, as he called himself, used to fetch any letter
he was authorised to get for people at the Kyne-
ton office, 20 miles off—the usual depot for Mount
Alexander, charging a shilling a letter for Ins
trouble. ‘ Yes, he had done that.’ Well, then,
I told him the only other chance was that they
flight have been sent ' o the Porcupine, nine miles
on the other side of Forest Creek, on the Bendigo
Hoad. ‘Oh ! Harry,’ says Joe, 4 will you go over
there with me to inquire V And I did. and that’s
wl ;y I never overtook you and Dick.
We started over to the Porcupine next day,
which was Sunday, but there were no letters for
Joe, and the poor little beggar fairly broke down

body cared for him, and he was without a single
tPlfend, and all that sort of thing, you know. I
rmd to chee'r him up a bit. and got him to eat
something—drink he wouldn’t —and as he was
tired and footsore, I proposed to stay for the
night. But the landlord, who seemed to be a
decent sort of fellow in his way, looked grave
when I sounded him about beds. ‘Look here,’ he
says, ‘ you appear to be respectable young fellows,
and I wouldn’t advise you to stop here to-night.
You see there is only this public-house anywhere
near the diggings, and a lot of rough fellows
come over here every Sunday—not your sort at
all, I can see. Go home, boys, if you’ve got any
sort of a one, for your own sake, and that’s my
advice.’
“ And very good advice it was, too ; so away we
started on the return trip. The miners were
already beginning to congregate about the house,
and I noticed a hang-dog looking customer,
with greasy Vandemonian ringlets, strolling
after us. But I said nothing, because I did
not want to alarm Joe. However, when we got to
a big waterhole at the junction of the Mount
Alexander-road and Barker’s Creek, the youngster
complained of his sore feet, and said he must
bathe them, and (you know what a particular
fellow he was) he went round under a big gum
that grows there and took off his boots and socks
for the purpose. Presently, the rascal who had
dodged us all the way from the Porcupine came
along, and asked for a light for his pipe, and
wanted to have a friendly chat. Perhaps I was a
trifle hasty, but I did not like the look of him, and
advised him to clear out. Then he got impudent,
and—well, I just pulled out my pepper-box, you
know, and fired a shot o v er his head. “What’s
that for ?” he asked ; and I saw he was a cur by
the droop of his under-lip. So I quietly turned
the barrel of my pistol and cocked it, mildly

First, draw a low comedy nigger: then throw in a lower comedy “rooster” somewhere
in the picture —no matter where-only there must be a rooster. Now then chuckle inwardly
as you write some characteristic but unintelligible nigger lingo underneath-the more unin-

remarking that I was going to have a little prac-
tice, and that if he didn’t get out of the way I was
so nervous that perhaps the next shot might hit
him. He scowled at me, but took the hint and
went off with an explosion of terribly sulphurous
language. Then I started to look for Joe and—
hang me ! if he hadn’t fainted.
“ This was a fix. I haven’t had any experience
of that sort. Our people are not much given to
fainting. ” And the good-natured giant glanced at
his broad, brown hands, and laughed, from the
chest outwards. . , „
“ Ton my honour, I don t know how to tell you
the rest. Of course I dashed water in Joe s face,
and then I thought of opening the collar of his
shirt to give him air, you know. And, Jack
well it’s an awkward story, but I can trust you.

°I was so amazed at this revelation that I could
only emit a long sibilant breath and stare at him.
“Now look here,” continued Harry, 1 don t
profess to be a superlatively moral young man ;
but upon my soul! when I made that discovery, I
felt as if I had committed sacrilege. I softly re-
placed his—her - necktie, and waited till he—she-
wed Joe revived ; and then, without saying any-
thing I helped him along for a couple of miles or
so 1 would have carried him if I hadn t known
what I did. Somehow I think Joe must have
had some dreamy notion of what had happened.
< >Tis all my fault. ’ he said, ‘ I took out my nugget
to 1 ok at it when you were away, and a shadow
made me look up, and there was that dreadful
man with his face close to the window. lam sure
he must have seen it ; and that’s why he followed

scarcely hobble along ; and just as we got in sight
of the first lights on Barker's Creek he sain he
must rest. So I left him sitting-on a log while I
went forward to see if I could get any help or
accommodation, and I never saw him, or her,
whichever it is, again. I had obtained the loan
of a horse for tier use. but when I got back she
was gone—how, or in what way, I cannot tell. I
have sought high and low, enquired at the bank,
and all that sort of thing ; but I have never seen
or heard of Joe from that day to this.”
Four months or more had passed away when
Harry and I, after a fairly profitable sojourn at
Eaglehawk and Spring Gully, joined the big rush
to Moonlight at Forest Creek, where we chanced
on some very pretty ground. One Sunday morn-
ing we were aroused from our slumbers at day-
break by the angry roar of a turbulent mob. We
had pitched our tent on the slope of a rise, and
from this post of vantage we could see what was
gomg on. In a broad flat, aside and apart from
the main workings, a large crowd had collected,
forming a wide ring. They were yelling like
maniacs, and at first it appeared as if a pugilistic
encounter was under way. But further observa-
tion revealed something different. In the centre
of the ring stood a solitary human figure, around
whom some five or six men slowly and continu-
ously perambulated. “Get the breakfast ready,_
Jack, while I go down and see what it s all about,
said Harry. . ,
Just then some miners came away from trie
crowd, and of them, as they passed by, we en-
quired the cause of the disturbance. They told us
that the central figure had stuck up an old man
and robbed him of his gold, and that the miners
wanted to lynch the culprit, but that some sailors
the men revolving around him— had sent to the
Camp for the authorities there to take charge of
him and whilst waiting their arrival they were at
once keeping him in custody and guarding him
from violence “Lynch him !-string him up !”
cried the angry and excited crowd. But the
sailors steadily refused to give up their prisoner.
“No !” they answered, and they clinched their
denial with a “mouth-filling oath” that would
have satisfied Hotspur himself : “ No; we ain’t
going to allow any Yandemonian tricks or Yankee
fooleries to be played off on these diggings. We
are holding the young fellow, and we mean to keep
him in tow till the ‘traps’ come for him, if it
takes us all day ; and if he has robbed that old son
of a sea cook as says so, why he’ll get all he
ot a sea-GOOK as says »<J, Ll .r
deserves in a proper manner according to the
articles of war. And, by thunder, if any of you
try to take him from us, we’ll let daylight into
some of your hides.” .
This little oration had its intended effect, and
the conservators of order continued their ceaseless
perambulations around the wretched object of
their attentions. And, as we gazed, we saw him
turn his head from side to side, as if in search of a
sympathetic face.
I set the camp-oven and the billy on the fire,
and then turned to see how the trouble was pro-
grossing. Harry had disappeared in the thron n ,
and as I did not feel particularly interested, I
attended to my cooking operations with the zest
begotten of a well-set appetite, sharpened by the
keen air of an Australian spring morning.
It was a beautiful scene that I gazed upon as
placidly smoked my well-seasoned cutty. The shafts
of the uprising sun were glinting through the
branches and pendulous leaves of the stately white
gum-trees and playing around their boles, chequer-
mg the carpet of earth with ever-ranging traceries
where the rich, red soil gleamed Jrough the bright
green grass, save where upturned piles of clay and
gravel disfigured the landscape. Even the distant
reaches of the muddy creek glistened in the sun-
light. And in the face of it all that grim drama,
which might at any moment turn to tragedy, was
being enacted. As the hours passed on the crowd
became more ominously sullen, and, as I judged,
more dangerous. The prisoner had dropped on
the ground as from exhaustion, and still his
keepers marched round and round the prostrate
Jgure, revolvers in their hands, with patient,
persistent, forceful monotony. The day wore on,
and the sun had mounted nearly to the zenith,
and none of the officials from the camp had put
in an appearance. Suddenly several shots were
fired, whether at the prisoner or not I cannot say;
and the mob surged backwards, then forward, and
broke up in confusion The prisoner and his
guardians were merged in the indiscriminate mass
of human beings. The uproar became terrible,
but in the midst of it I heard a potent voice, that
I thought I recognised as Harry’s, crying out to
someone to “Run!” and a lithe figure —that of
the prisoner—suddenly burst through the crowd.
He came flying like a hunted deer, across the flat
and over the workings, leaping from hea,p to heap
of the upturned soil with desperate rapidity, and
close at his heels followed the enraged miners,
howling and shouting like infuriated demons.
Just as he passed below the point on which
I was standing, a red faced virago darted from
a tent near by, and, crossing his track dealt him
a mighty blow from her brawny arm, felling him
tothe earth. Like wolves athirst for blood, the
pursuers fastened on their victim, and half dragged,
half carried him to the side of the range. A coil of
rope was taken from a neighbouring store without
the formality of purchase—a noose quickly
knotted was placed round the prisoner’s neck, and
the other end cast over the projecting branch of a
convenient gumtree amidst cries of savage exulta-
tion. The victim, now insensible, was held in an
erect position ; half-a-dozen burly ruffians seized
the loose end of the rope in impatient expectancy
of the signal ; the sacrifice was about to be cqp-
summated. I saw Harry and some of the sailors
desperately attempting to effect a rescue, and
endeavoured to join them. But we were over-
powered by numbers, and the end seemed close at
hand. “ Hoist away !” shouted the ringleaders,
when just at that awful moment four horsemen
appeared on the range above. It was the Com-
missioner and his mounted escort, The lynchers
paused, and allowed the rope to swing loose, and
the inert body of the prisoner, released from sup-
port, fell in a tumbled heap at the foot of the tree.
Either the Commissioner was frightened by the
spectacle or he lost control of his horse, for, as
a Northumbrian observed to me, “he kept filling
and backing, like a Geordie running down chan-
nel.” At last he managed to gasp out : ‘My
good men, whatever you do don’t take the law
into your own hands.” .
Considering that Mr. Commissioner had been
six hours coming a mile to do his duty, and that,
but for the pluck of the sailors an innocent life
would have been sacrificed, this has always
seemed the most amazing piece of moral advice
that I ever heard enunciated.
Harry, breathless and bleeding, with myself
and some of the better disposed, struggled to the
front. Our first care was to cast loose the rope,
our next to raise the still insensible prisoner. One
look was enough. It was Joe—our own Little
Nugget ! „ , . ~
Her clothing had oeen torn from her shoulders
(it is useless to palter with the pronoun any
longer), and I saw that what Harry had told me
was correct. Others saw the same evidence.
Some of the wretches jeered, but more had suffi
cient humanity to shrink away abashed.
“ What—what—what is the matter?” stam-
mered Mr. Commissioner.
“He has robbed me,” shrieked Joe’s accuser
—a man with long, greasy ringlets. “He
has got my nugget on him now. I can swear
to it anywhere.” And he described, with mar-
vellous accuracy, the very nugget that I had
parted with to Joe—my own “ first find ”on
Forest Creek. Then he approached, as if to make
a search, but Harry strode between—“ Stand
back, you scoundrel!” he cried, his face blazing
with honest wrath, and I regret to say that he
made use of very strong language, utterly ignoring
the majesty of the law as represented m the per-
son of Mr. Commissioner. , , ,
“No one shall touch her but me,” he declared.
“ Don’t you see it’s a woman ?” And then, with
all delicacy and tenderness, he drew from Joe’s
pocket the veritable nugget and told its story,
which I, of course, confirmed.
Then the tide of popular feeling turned and the
hunter became the hunted. The false accuser was
set upon and violently hustled by the mob, which
panted for something or somebody upon which to
expend its aroused passions. I believe they would
have hung him with the rope prepared for Joe
but for the presence of the Commissioner. As it
was, the scoundrel was treated to such a course of
mud-baths and other indignities as satisfied their
ardour for justice and their thirst for amusement.
Harry told me afterwards that he was the fellow
who had dogged them at the Porcupine.
Poor Harry was so badly hurt in this affray
that he had to take up his quarters in the Mel-
bourne Hospital for a time. And Joe —well, Joe
had had enough of mining adventure and hence-
forth very prudently abandoned garments propria
quce maribus.
I learned Joe’s story (her name was really
Josephine) long afterwards. It was simple enough.
She had run away from an uncongenial step-
mother and donned the disguise of boy’s clothing
as a protection in the lawless state of the diggings.

1877.
A quarter of a century passed away. I had long
since migrated to New Zealand ; and the memory
of the events I have recorded had become as a,
dream of the distant Past, when I received a letter
from Harry.
Dear old Jack ! (Thus it was worded.) I hear that you
are located at the Dunstan. We have been “ doing” the
o-rand scenery of your beautiful country, and shall be
passing through Clyde next Monday. Do meet us when
the coach passes through. I want to take you by the
hand again, and, above all, to introduce you to Mrs
Harry.
Then followed this postscript
Do you still remember Centipede Gully and Moonlight?
Be sure I met the coach, and quickly recognised
Harry, though he had aged considerably in the
sultry Queensland climate. He introduced me to
a little woman, not young nor particularly hand-
some, but well-preserved and beautiful with the
beauty that comes with middle age. There were
“ silver threads amongst the gold,” but the dark-
blue eyes still sparkled brightly, and a sweet
smile illumined her face as she offered me her
hand. “ Don’t you know me, Jack?” she cried.
“ I’m Joey the' Little Nugget, you know—and
(divinely regardless of grammar) I have it yet.”
Few and brief were the words we exchanged,
fos Harry was in haste to get back to his herds
and flocks. A glass of wine, and then—“ All
aboard !” A crack of the driver’s whip, a rattle
of wheels and brakes, a prancing of horses, and
Joe and Harry passed away like
A Tale that is Told.


THE SPELL
OF THE
MAS SHANTOO
Pontianak, at the
mouth of the Kapoeas
River, is not a place
much visited by Euro-
peans, but one can
obtain an exceptional
experience there.
Pontianak is the
head-quarters of the
Dutch in Borneo, and
the Resident-General
has a small joke of
his own, which he plays
off on the unsuspecting
new chum. As is cus-
tomary in those torrid
settlements, business is
generally transacted dur-
ing £he comparatively
cool hours immed i ately
succeeding daylight. As
you discuss it with the
courteous old resident,
he inveigles you into a
stroll up and down the
verandah, and after a
slight experience of this
exercise, he informs you
that the equatorial line
passes right through the
centre of his bungalow,
and that during that
morning walk you have
crossed and re-crossed the
equator several times.
I have other cause to
remember Pontianak. It
was my starting-point
on an expedition destined
to be =. very memorable
one. L had long con-
templated a trip into
the interior of Borneo,
allured partly by the
reports of the half-worked
diamond mines, and part-
ly by natural curiosity to
see a place so little known.
I had accidentally met
with a young travelling
Englishman, an enthusi-
astic sportsman, who
eagerly jumped at the
notion, and the result
was that we soon found
ourselves at Pontianak,
where, after the necessary
official permission had
been obtained, we made
our arrangements for de-
parture.
Travelling there is a
far more luxurious style
3f thing than in the Aus-
tralian back-blocks. Our
destination was the
Sintang district, and
our highway the river
Kapoeas. A large roofed-
in native boat, known as
a gobang, a native crew
under a mandor or head-
man ; a good outfit of
stores, &0., were obtained,
and we started for the
land of the Dyaks.
For days our travel-
ling was most auspicious.
The dense jungle on
either hand afforded a
good supply of animal
life for my companion to
exercise his sporting in-
stincts on, and the native
tribes we met were
friendly and interesting.
As time went on we
found ourselves amongst
Dyaks—permission to
pass through whose terri-
tory cost some diplomacy,
but patience and a
friendly demeanour over-
came all objections, and
we soon got well into
the mountainous districts
on the upper reaches of
the river. As yet I had
not met the object of my search—the aban- |
doned diamond mines, legends of which
were often repeated by the coastal Malays.
Once or twice I was shown places where gold-
mining on a most primitive fashion had un
doubtedly been pursued in some long-forgotten
time. Circular holes had been sunk in three
places in the shape of a triangle. Drives had
then been made from one to another, but by
whom it had been done the Dyaks could not
tell. Certainty not by their forefathers. Some
told me that it was the work of slaves long
ago, when the sultans from India had swept
down on the archipelago and enthroned them-
selves in Java and Sumatra, thence enforcing
tribute over Borneo, Celebes and the smaller
islands.
No ruins nor inscriptions were to be found
indicating that the country had ever been per-
manently settled by the men of that time. Some-
times I heard mysterious reports of a wild race
whose descent was more ancient than that of the
Dyaks; they were known as the Orangpooenan,
of forest men, and were marked with a white spot
in the middle of the forehead, a proof, at any rate,
of their Hindu origin.
One day Morton and I were dozing inside our
mosquito-nets, when frantic yells of pain from the
boatmen aroused us, and next moment they all
plunged overboard. We sat looking at each other
in silent astonishment. Everything seemed
peaceful enough : what could have caused such a
dispersion ? Presently,, one after another, the
men re-appeared and climbed back into the boat,
when we learned the cause of it. A swarm of
bees had suddenly invaded the gobang during
their flight across the river, and being most
pugnacious insects had routed the crew, flying on
when the men took to the water. Morton and I
being inside mosquito-nets had escaped.
This incident happened on the last day of our
progress. That afternoon about 4 o’clock the
mandor came to me and pointed to a rope of
twisted rattan stretched across the river—a sign
that we were to go no further. Some Dyaks
were assembled on the bank, and we went ashore
to parley with them.
They were apparently as friendly as usual, and
accepted some small presents of tobacco, but
declined to give us any reason for refusing the
required permission to proceed. We visited the
village and partook of fruit there, and after dark
returned to our boat. Morton was very hurt at our
sudden detention, and wanted to go on in spite of
the natives. I pointed out to him the folly cf such
a proceeding, and he consented to take things
quietly and wait for a day or two. During those
two days I made every effort to conciliate our
neighbours, and with perfect success, excepting in
the one direction. We were not to go up the
river. I could get no reason for this refusal, and
came to the conclusion that we must perforce
return.
My enquiries as to the ancient gold and
diamond mines seemed to amuse the old men
mightily. One of them told me that I had seen
the Kambing-Mas. This is a golden sheep which
appears to certain doomed men; so infatuated
does the victim become at sight of it, that he
follows it on through jungles and mountains day
after day, until he dies of fatigue.
Of legends and traditions I got my fill, but per-
mission to proceed was not obtainable. My old
“ Behind me, as I squatted by the water's edge, the two yellow, semi-nude figures, of the old
man and the girl, bending over my shoulders in rapt attention."
friend who told me of the Kambing-Mas asked me
if I wanted to try for the great diamond which
was supposed to be in a lake at the head of a river,
This gem, described of enormous size and un-
speakable lustre, can be plainly seen at the bottom,
like a star, but woe to the rash man who dives
down after it. The infuriated spirit-guardians
seize and strangle'him, and his dead body floats
on the surface as a warning,
“Perhaps,” went on my loquacious host, ‘‘you
would go to the land of the Mas-hantoo, the
spirit-gold?” This district, rich in the precious
metal, was cursed by a sultan of old, on account
of the death of his son, and though you may go
there and fill your pockets with gold-dust and
nuggets, they all turn to sand and pebbles when
you cross the boundary on your return.
Meanwhile Morton chafed greatly at our delay,
and I had to exercise much tact to pacify him.
The third evening I saw him in close talk with
the mandor; he then left the boat and went to the
village, returning about dark, with the informa-
tion that we had now permission to proceed.
It seemed strange to me that I had heard
naught about it, but at the time I suspected
nothing. It was a bright moonlight night. Tak-
ing the mandor's kris, Morton went ashore ami
severed the rattan rope where it was tied round
the butt of a tree. The men took their places and
the boat was once more under way
I dropped off to sleep about ten o’clock. I
awoke amidst the crash of boughs and branches,
bringing ruin and destruction on us and our craft.
Although half-stunned, I managed to struggle
from beneath the crushed-in roof, and, as the boat
sank, struck out feebly for the shore, which I
had no sooner reached than I fainted.
What had happened to us was the result of
Morton’s rashness. Poor fellow, he paid for it
with his life. The villagers had not given him per-
mission to proceed, but he had bribed the mandor
to consent to go on at night and risk it. Along
the bank of the river the Dyaks had selected cer
tain leaning trees under which we would pass.
These had been cut through to within an inch of
breaking-point, being secured from falling out-
right by twisted rattans. As we passed, these
guys were cut, and we were swamped by the fall-
ing trees. Morton was killed instantly, although
I strangely escaped, and most of the crew were
more or less hurt. All this 1 learned afterwards.
When I came to my senses I was lying by a fire
in a small clearing in the jungle, with two or three
Dyaks sleeping around. One man was awake,
apparently watching. When .he saw me looking
about he came over to me and brought me a drink,
Ho was very light-coloured, dressed in the ordi-
nary chawat or apron with a jacket, called a
“ lag a,” on his body. He smiled pleasantly and,
addressing me in the native dialect, said “ Saki ”
(a name they had given mo at the village), “ you
were ill-advised to seek the Tampat-mas (gold-
mine) here. Why did you not watch the flight of
the fish-hawk first ?” I asked after Morton, and
he told me of his death.
I was well treated, and the fate of Morton
whom they knew to be guilty of the offence, had
apparently atoned for our trespass.
On the second day I was much recovered, and
the Dyak who had just spoken to me—he was
named Abiasi—was sitting by my side showing me
how to use the blow-pipe, when a strange old
man came from the jungle and advanced in the
clearing.
He was tall and white-bearded, and on his for t ,
head was a round mark made with white pigment
of some sort. Abiasi rose and said something to
him of which I could only catch the word
“ Saghie another name for the forest men. Pre-
sontly the old man, who had only a ragged chawat
on, came over and regarded me earnestly, then he
and Abiasi renewed their conversation.
“Saki,” said the latter at last, addressing me
directly, “If you still wish to see the Tampat-
Mas where the Mas-hantoo is, this old saghie will
take you there.” He then further told me that
the old Saghie, or Orangpooenan, lived in the
mountains where there were many old mines, but
it was all spirit-gold, that turned into sand and
gravel after it was taken away. The Saghie
thought that the presence of a white man might
break the charm. I eagerly agreed to go, and
Abiasi gave me many instructions as to my return,
lent me a parang, or heavy knife, and bade me
farewell.
It was evening when we started and the old man
led me through the jungle by a well-beaten path.
Although the moon was bright, the shadows were
dense where it did not penetrate, and I confess to
feeling very nervous as we pushed on in silence,
starting at intervals some sleeping bird or a troop
of monkeys.
Presently we came to a
small opening and halted
in front of a low-thatched
hut. In answer to his
call a young woman, evi-
dently just aroused from
sleep, came out; she
brought some live embers
and made a fire. Like
the old man, she was
very fair in colour, good-
looking, with well-shaped
limbs, which, as her only
attire was the chawat, or
apron, were fully dis-
played. After eating
some rice and fruit I lay
down by the fire and
slept for the remainder
of the night.
I was not sorry to see
a fine large fish cooking
on the coals for breakfast,
as my returning health
brought with it a good
appetite. When we had
finished our meal the old
man and the girl, whom I
took to be his grand-
daughter, took a large
rush - woven basket be-
tween them and started
along a narrow path lead-
ing through the forest,
motioning me to follow.
In about two miles we
reached an open space,
and before us rose the
rugged side of a hill.
We followed the base of
this round for some time
until the face of the
hill grew steep and pre-
cipitous, and I noticed
we were amongst some
ancient workings.
At the mouth of what
seemed a drive in the
cliff the old Saghie
stopped, and they set
down the basket. He
then spoke rapidly to the
girl, whom he called
Suara, and she collected
dry wood and built up a
fire, the old man lighting
some tinder with a flint
and steel. Suara then
broke down the branches
of a resinous kind of
pine common to the hilly
country, and with the
assistance of my parang
dressed them into rude
torches. I now under-
stood what these pre-
parations meant, and
when we had lit the
torches the i wo picked
up the basket and led the
■way into the tunnel or
drive.
As seen by the dim flare
of the torches, it pre-
sented far more finished
work than any of the
ancient workings I had
yet seen. We must have
gone at least one hun-
dred yards before the old
man stopped, and I then
saw that somebody had
recently been at work,
for there was loose dirt lying about, and some
native tools.
The old Saghie put down the basket, and
motioned to me to come and fill it with the
shovel. I did so, and naturally took the oppor-
tunity of examining the dirt. I sifted some in my
hands, and blew part of the finer dirt away
and am satisfied, even now, that there was a large
quantity of coarse gold through it and several
specimens, as they are generally called by diggers.
Of this I am quite sure, in despite of what
afterwards occurred.
The old Saghie was peering over my shoulder
while I was blowing the dust away, and grinned
hideously as he saw the gold exposed here and
there. I remember wondering at the time what
possible ambition could be his for the yellow dross.
Perhaps he thought the same of me ?
Anyhow, we were both satisfied with our in-
spection, and I went on filling up the bag until it
could hold no more. The old man and the girl
picked it up and carried it out of the tunnel.
Instead of taking the homeward track as I
anticipated they turned down another one, and in
a short time we were beside a small stream that
descended from the range. Here there were rude
appliances for washing, and I selected,_ as the
most convenient, a shallow baked-clay dish, and
commenced washing out a prospect.
Not a speck nor a trace of gold was there. 1
did not look at my two companions, for it struck
me that possibly the dirt at the top of the basket
was different to what I had examined in the


tunnel. I therefore took another prospect from
the very bottom and proceeded to wash it.
That was a strange scene. The narrow path
leading down to the running stream, just cutting
a thin gap in the dense forest. The shrill chatter-
ing and screaming of parrots overhead, and the
noises made by the troops of monkeys, which swung
from bough to bough, and from one long hanging
vine to another. Behind me, as I squatted by the'
water’s edge, the.two yellow, semi-nude figures, of'
the old man and the girl, bending over my
shoulders in rapt attention.
The dirt was rapidly reduced as I swirled the
water round in the dish, and when I tilted it
to and fro, there, at either end of tire grit and
gravel appeared the yellow glow of gold. I
heard the two behind me heave a sigh of satisfac-
tion as this sight appeared. Surely the spell of
the Mas-hantoo was broken at last ?
Suddenly, without a sound of warning, a
glistening flashing object dropped from overhead
and struck me and the girl headlong into the
water. Blinded and frightened, I staggered to
my feet, for the stream was but shallow, and in an
instant saw what had happened. A huge boa had
dropped from a tree above, as is their custom on
the paths by which the deer go to water, and
snatched its victim from our midst. The old man
was crushed against the tree by three or four
folds of the creature whose tail was still in the
branches above, and he was already in the pangs
of death.
Suara, who, like myself, had been knocked for-
ward by a blow from a coil of the reptile as it
dropped on its prey, was standing near me gazing
with horror-stricken eyes on the death-scene.
The crunching of the unhappy man’s bones was
quite audible, but his collapsed body showed that
life was over.
The dish had floated on the surface, and was
now held from going down stream by a tussock of
reeds. Suara picked it up and handed it to me,
with a strange look of despair. Instinctively,
despite the near presence of the monster, now
gloating over its meal, I finished washing the
prospect. The spell of the Mas-hantoo held good.
Nothing but gravel and sand was now in the
earthen dish, which I dashed to pieces on a rock.
Together, Suara I and left the spot and made
our way to the hut, which we reached that even-
ing and there rested for the night. Next morning
she conducted me through jungle paths to within
sight of the village where Abiasi lived.
Here she stopped and pointed in another direc-
tion, nor would she accompany me a step towards
the village, and so, neither able to say farewell to
the other in language both could understand, we
parted. Abiasi told me afterwards that more of
her people lived in the direction she had pointed.
A lot of our goods had been recovered, and the
crew were now nearly all well. A fresh gobang
was provided, and I parted from the Dyak
villagers with strangely mixed feelings, although
it was with some sense of satisfaction that I saw
mile after mile increase the distance between me
and the mines of the Mas-hantoo.
BOOVYEA.
The Sundowner’s Sacrifice.
(PER MR. JACKY DOW.)
Old Jacky gazed on the setting sun
As he stood by his garden gate,
When to him appeared a “ regular” one
Of the sect called the Swag Estate.
“ Chance of a job ?” ’Twas the fixed address,
And it glibly slipped his jaws,
As a parson’s patter as void of stress,
And told, too, for the self-same cause.
An idea lit up the humorist’s brow,
Of a fine retributive plan,
And he answered : “ Well, I want just now
A really active man.
Can you run ? Would you mind running round
the shed ?
You can mess with the men to-night.”
The thought of a feed of yeasty bread
Made the whaler’s heart as light.
He dropped his “hump” and he hitched h
trews,
And took up a hole in his belt;
A stomach ill-used braced up his thews,
His soul two square feeds smelt.
At something like a “ Botany ” pace
He covered the track set out,
Great tears of sweat ran down his face—
He was “ winded, just about.”
As the woolly joker again he faced,
flying a dirty “ wipe,”
A smile that gentleman’s visage graced
Suspiciously rich and ripe.
Ah ! very good. Yes, I think you’ll do
(Give this to the cook) very well.

The Story of Conroy’s Gap.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
HIS was the way
of it, don t
you know—
Ryan was
‘ wanted ’ for
stealing sheep
And never a
trooper, high
or low,
Could find him
—catch a wea-
sel asleep !
Till Trooper Scott,
from t li o
l Stockman’s
' Ford—
A tushman,
too, as I’ve
heard them
tell—
Chanced to find him drunk as a lord
Round at the Shadow of Death Hotel.
D’ you know the place ? It’s a wayside inn,
A low grog-shanty—a bushman trap,
Hiding away in its shame and sin
Under the shelter of Conroy’s Gap
Under the shade of that frowning range,
The roughest crowd that ever drew breath -
Thieves and rowdies, uncouth and strange,
Were mustered round at the Shadow of Death.
The trooper knew that his man would slide
Like a dingo-pup, if he saw the chance;
And with half a start on the mountain-side
Ryan would lead him a merry dance.
j
Drunk as he was when the trooper came,
To him that did not matter a rap—
Drunk or sober, he was the same,
The boldest rider in Conroy’s Gap.
“ 1 want you, Ryan,” the trooper said,
“ And listen to mo, if you dare resist
So help me heaven, I’ll shoot you dead !”
He snapped the steel on his prisoner’s wrist,
And Ryan, hearing the handcuffs click,
Recovered his wits as they turned to go,
For fright will sober a man as quick
As all the drugs that the doctors know.
There was a girl in that rough bar
Went by the name of Kate Carew,
Quiet and shy as the bush girls are,
But ready-witted and plucky, too.
She loved this Ryan, or so they say,
And passing by while her eyes were dim
With tears, she said in a careless way,
“ The Swagman’s round in the stable, Jim.”
Spoken too low for the trooper’s ear,
Why should she care if he heard or not ?
Plenty of swagmen far and near,
And yet to Ryan it meant a lot.
That was the name of the grandest horse
In all the district from East to West
In every show-ring, on every course
They always counted the Swagman best;
Ho was a wonder, a raking bay —
One of the grand old Snowdon strain —
One of the sort that could race and stay
With his mighty limbs and his length of rein.
Born and bred on the mountain side,
He could race through scrub like a kangaroo,
The girl herself on his back might ride
And the Swagman would carry her safely
through.
He would travel gaily from daylight’s flush
Till after the stars hung out their lamps,
There was never his like in the open bush.
And never his match on the cattle-camps.
For faster horses might well be found
On racing tracks, or a plain’s extent,
But few, if any, on broken ground
Could see the way that the Swagman went.
When this girl’s father, old Jim Carew,
Was droving out on the Castlereagh
With Conroy’s cattle, a wire came through
To say that his wife couldn’t live the day.
And he was a hundred miles from home,
As flies the crow, with never a track,
Through plains as pathless as ocean’s foam,
He mounted straight on the Swagman’s back.
He left the camp by the sundown light,
And the settlers out on the Marthaguy
Awoke and heard, in the dead of night,
A single horseman hurrying by.
He crossed the Bogan at Dandaloo,
And many a mile of the silent plain
That lonely rider behind him threw
Before they settled to sleep again.
He rode all night and he steered his course
By the shining stars with a bushman’s skill.
And every time that he pressed his horse
The Swagman answered him gamely still.
He neared his home as the East was bright,
The doctor met him outside the town ;
“ Carew ! How far did you come last night ? ” -
“ A hundred miles since the sun went down.”
And his wife got round, and an oath he pass’t,
So long as he or one of his breed
Could raise a coin, though it took their last
The Swagman never should want a feed.
And Kate Carew, when her father died,
She kept the horse and she kept him well;
The pride of the district far and wide,
He lived in style at the bush hotel.
Such \yas the Swagman ; and Ryan knew
Nothing about could pace the crack.
Little he’d care for the man in blue
If once he got on the Swagman’s back.
But how to do it ? A word let fall
Gave him the hint as the girl passed by ;
Nothing but “ Swagman—stable-wall;
Go to the stable and mind your eye.”
He caught her meaning, and quickly turned
To the trooper : “ Reckon you’ll gain a stripe
By arresting me, and it’s easily earned.
Let’s go to the stable and get my pipe ;
The Swagman has it.” So off they went,
And soo f l as ever they turned their backs
The girl slipped down, on some errand bent
Behind the stable, and seized an axe.
The trooper stood at the stable-door
While Ryan went in quite cool and slow,
And then (the tricWiad been played before)
The girl outside jpive the wall a blow.
Three slabs fell out of the stable-wall —
T’was done ’fore ever the trooper knew—
And Ryan, as soon as he saw them fall,
Mounted the Swagman and rushed him through
The trooper heard the hoof-beats ring
In the stable-yard, and he slammed the gate,
But the Swagman rose with a mighty spring
At the fence, and the trooper fired too late,
As they raced away and his shots flew wide
And Ryan no longer need care a rap,
For never a horse that was lapped in hide
Could catch the Swagman in Conroy’s Gap.
And that’s the story. You want to know
If Ryan came back to his Kate Carevv ;
Of course he should have, as stories go,
But the worst of it is, this story's true ;
And in real life it’s a certain rule,
Whatever poets and authors say
Of high-toned robbers and all their school,
These horsethief fellows aren’t built that way.
Come back ! Don’t hope it —the slinking hound,
He sloped across to the Queensland side
And sold the Swagman for fifty pound,
And stole the money, and more beside.
And took to drink, and by some good chance
Was killed— thrown out of a stolen trap.
And that was the end of this small romance
The end of the story of Conroy’s Gap.
THE BANJO.
Johnson and his Mates.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There were four of us who worked right cut tho
twenty-acre block—
Me and Johnson, Irish Mick, an' Tommy Bates ;
When she buffered out we left the place (the tin-
field, Granite Rock),
’Ceptin’ Johnson —he was wiser than his mates.
Now, we’d not done very badly in the two years
we’d been there
(Fortune’s- bound to come unto the man who
waits),
So we had a spree—a real good time (we’d plenty
cash to spare),
’Ceptin’ Johnson —he was wiser than his mates.
An’ we had a trip to Melbourne, an’ we went an’
saw “the Cup”
(A cup which cheers not, but inebriates).
An’ we all of us backed stiff ’uns—for we played
our money up—
’Ceptin’ Johnson—he was wiser tiiat his mates !
But a jolly time the three of us had while we held
the cash
(Ain't it odd how soon the money dissipates?)
And we showed the city fellers how tin-miners
cut a dash,
’Ceptin’ Johnson—he was wiser than his mates !
For he stayed right on at Granite Rock, did
Johnson, and he lent
All his money out at money-lenders’ rates ;
By-an’-bye his pile grew bigger still—while we’d
lost ev’ry cent —
A r es! that Johnson, he was wiser than his
mates !
Then we thi’ee who’d knocked our substance down
with joyous disregard,
Had to go to graft again, and cuss our fates ;
An’ we worked, and swore, and growled, and
thought our lot was really hard—
’Ceptin’ Johnson —he was wiser than his mates !
lie got rich, an’ drove his carriage, an’ he wore a
shiny hat
On the baldest and the shiniest of pates-;
Wc were getting just our tucker, an’ sometimes
we’d not get that—
Oh, yes; Johnson was much wiser than his
mates !
Then he courted old Brown’s daughter—we were
all in love with her;
But in wooing it’s the “ jink ” that operates ;
An’she married Johnson straight away without
the least demur—
Once more was Johnson smarter than his mates!
Johnson’s wealth kept on increasing, and his
business grew more big,
But the lust for gold is one that ne’er abates ;
And to keep his “specs.” in progress, Johnson
slaved worse than a nig.—
(lie was always reckoned smarter than his
mates !)
Well, the rest of us we jogged along, just in our
usual way
(That is, me an’ Irish Mick, an’ Tommy Bates),
If wo had bad times, we stood ’em—if we’d luck,
we just were gay,
But not Johnson —he was wiser than his mates !
If we struck a patch, an’ made a “rise,” that
“rise” we all enjoyed
(The chummiest we were of syndicates),
An Wed take a spell, an’ see some life (our t-me
was well employed)—
’Ceptin’ Johnson—who was wiser than his
mates!
An’ now Johnson is a J.P., an’ a squatter, an’ a
toff,
An’ his wealth it ev’ry day accumulates —
But he doesn’t know the pleasure now of havine a
week “off,”
Doesn't Johnson—who is wiser than his mates !
An’ he has a “ touch of liver,” an’the gout, like-
wise, he’s got,
An’ his wife’s a reg’lar terror—Johnson states—
But, we're free from wife and liver an’ from gout
an’ all such rot -
’Ceptin’ Johnson—who was wiser than his
mates !
So we think, at times when tucker’s scarce, and
sinkin’s mighty hard,
Or the bottomin’ a duffer aggravates—
That we oughtn’t to be sorry we’re not all from
pleasure barred
Like poor Johnson—who was wiser than his
mates !
For there’s better things in this hero world than
money, you can bet,
(As this story I am telling indicates);
And I’ve come to the conclusion that, in spfto of
riches, yet,
Darned if Johnson was much wiser than his mates /

Sydney E. Noose said of somebody the
other day that she had “information of the
brain,” This awful complaint has killed every
Noose man who ever suffered from it.
m RTS is the story of the bumptious Govern-
I meat surveyor, the farmer, and his ‘ dorg,’
The surveyor was prancing round a paddock,
down South, with the air of a man who owned
the earth, and was in treaty for the purchase of
the heavens as well, when the excited owner
came along and told him to “git out o’ that
dam quick.’
The surveyor haughtily replied that he had
been sent there by the Government, and there he would remain until his
business was finished.
“ The Govermint be hanged!” roared the farmer; “that’s my ground, and I
won’t hev no one a-trampin’ across it,” and then the man of measures, flourishing
a roll of plans, declared he held Government papers authorising him to enter the
paddock, and he would stay there as long as he pleased.
Then the farmer spoke never a word nor wept, but, going over to an adjacent
shed, he liberated an aggressive-looking pup.
The ’aughty official and the dog immediately started on a go-as-you-please
flutter for the gate, while the farmer, who evidently had more faith in the dog’s
sagacity than the surveyor, climbed up on a fence to enjoy the fun and yelled, “ Don’t
run away, Mister ! You’ve got authority to stay in that paddock for a year, if you
like. Why don't you shore Tiger them Govermint papers ? Snow him the Gover-
mint papers, y’everlastin’ fool ! STOP AN’ SHOW THE DORG THE
GOVERMINT PAPERS!”
Five minutes later a sad-eyed, panting surveyor might be seen in ihe bush
behind a gum-tree endeavouring to patch the southern hemisphere of his pants
with a parchment-plan and a boot-lace, while a brindled “ dorg ” laid the scalp of
the pants at the feet of his delighted master.
“Not Sufficient Funds.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“Brownson!” called the manager from
the bank-parlour.
“Sir!”
“What’s the amount of Weatherboard’s bal-
ance ?”
“ Thirteen and ninepence..”
“Sure?”
“ Quite.”
And so it was, though I was too lazy to turn up
Weatherboard’s account in the ledger and look.
My indolence was partly hereditary and constitu-
tional, and partly the result of imitating the boss
too closely. He wasn’t a bad fellow, Chapson,
and was very popular, but he was even worse than
myself as regards carelessness. He had a fine,
high-toned, don’t-care-a-curso sort of way of over-
looking such trifles as accuracy and certainty
which quite suited me.
The manager and myself constituted the entire
staff of the Consolidated Bank at Bumblegum. It
was a very slow place, was Bumblegum. Some ’’
days we would have customers, and some days we
wouldn’t; but we never allowed the state of busi-
ness to prey upon our health or undermine our
constitutions. And on slack days we could make
up the books and balance off before closing-time,
and then recreate at billiards or cricket or fishing
from the very moment the doors closed. Nobody
was likely to come in during the last half-hour,,
and if anyone did we would just let the matter go-
in with the next day’s business. This lack of
strict precision on our part never had the effect of
c ausing a crisis, or a financial panic, or an un-
easiness in the London money market, or any
such foolishness, and therefore neither of us-
thought it advisable to worry about strict exacti-
tude.
“Well,” said the manager, “ don’t you cash jny
more of Weatherboard’s cheques. He’s no dam
good. He's gone broke about five times and lie
had the Commercial last year for a hundred-and-
twenty. There’s a cheque of his hero from tho
Provincial for five-pounds that we’ll send back
He don’t get at us, not if I can help it.” Then,
aside: “I want to get quits with him, anyhow.
Took me down for eight-pound-ten at billiards
last night.” And he wrote “N.S.F.” on the back
of Weatherboard’s paper with a grin of satis-
faction. And it was posted for its return journey
to the Provincial Bank at Taramine that evening.
# * *
Next day I was posting up the ledger as
usual, and happened, by accident, to come across
the page devoted to Mr, Weatherboard’s business.
And when I did so, I got a shock worse
than treading on a hoop. For I observed that
Weatherboard’s balance was not 13s. 9d. It was
£l3 9s. And we had dishonoured his cheque fo r
£5 1 And Weatherboard was just the very man
to make things hot for us in consequence.
Well, the boss had to be told, anyhow. So I
coughed away some of the huskiness from ray
throat, and mopped a little of the cold sweat off
my forehead, and went in to the parlour, and told
him.
“Well,” said Chapson, “I must say you are a
•consummate idiot, Brownson.”
I couldn’t deny it. I felt that my superior
officer’s remarks were characterised by solid truth.
He repeated his candid, unbiassed opinion-of my
mental capacity several times with a pleasing
variety of nouns and adjectives. Then he said :
“But we can fix it up, though, now. It’s not
too late. Telegraph to the Provincial, ‘ Weather,
board’s cheque returned in error. Present again.’
Off you go 1 Sharp, now 1”
A great sigh of relief gushed from my overladen
bosom as I realised that we could prevent Wea-
therboard from knowing anything about the
matter, and that there was, after all, no immediate
probability of my being dismissed the bank’s
service for stupidity and culpable negligence. But
when I got to the telegraph-office, I was once
more jerked back to utter misery.
“ Line’s down t’other side of Bingy Creek,’’
said the operator. “Won’t lx; fixed up till the
■day after to-morrow.”
There was only one chance left now. With the
eagerness of a drowning-man grabbing for the
hair of the other fellow, I asked :
“ Has the Taramine mail gone out yet? ”
The cheerfulness of that man was positively
hateful as he replied ;
“Why, bless you, yes ! Mailman started at 7
o’clock this morning. Be at old Gluey’s wine-
shanty by now, boozing up. Don’t think he’ll get
across the creek though, till to-morrow. It was a
banker yesterday, and old Jimmy don’t like water
much, in any shape. Funny old cove is ”
But I didn’t want to hear any more. I was too
miserable. For we were in a fix now, just. I
could see the consequences looming up in the near
future as big as two haystacks. Old Weatherboard
would bring an action against the bank for
damages, as sure as fate, and get them, too. Then
our head-office would want an explanation from
Chapson, and he could only lay the blame on me,
and the result would be that we would both be
dismissed. And all through my accursed laziness.
I could have kicked myself !
When I told Chapson about the telegraph being
interrupted, he swore. First at the repairers,
then at me, then at his condemned luck in having
for an assistant the biggest blankity fool in the
lurid country. I went on with my work and said
nothing. I couldn't. Chapson gave me no time.
He got through with his observations at last
and I could see he was thinking hard. By-and-
bye, his mind seemed to be made up, and he said ;
“I’m going for a ride. If I’m not back by 12
(it was Saturday), lock up and balance off your-
self; that is, if you don’t forget.” This last
remark was ‘‘meant sarcastic.”
* * *
Chapson wasn’t, back at 12 ; and lie didn’t
turn up all the afternoon. And at bed-time, whe n
I inquired at the hotel where he lodged, they said
they had seen nothing of him since morning.
Next day was Sunday, About dusk the
manager rode into town. Ho looked rather the
worse for wear. His horse was nearly knocked
up, too, and had evidently been ridden hard and
long. Chapson said he had chased a kangaroo*
and got lost, and had been out all night in the
ranges. His demeanour, however, was more con-
ciliatory, and his language considerably less crude
than when I last saw him. And a night on the
Bumblegum ranges doesn’t generally improve a
man’s temper either !
* # #
Just before closing time next day, Chapson
called out:
“Hello, Brownson ! here’s a discovery !”
“ What is.it ? ” I asked.
“ Why, here’s that infernal cheque of Weather-
board’s lying on my table! Must have forgotten
to put it in the envelope ! By Heavens, I’m get-
ting careless ! But it’s a lucky thing for us this
time, anyhow. Here, take it, and put it through!’’
Now, I had enclosed that cheque myself and
posted the letter, these being duties the manager
never, under any circumstances, performed. So,
when I had collected my wits a little, I began,
“Why, sir ”
“Now, can’t you dry up ? When will you learn
sense enough to hold your blank foolish tongue’
You ought to know by this time that you only
make an ass of yourself when you do speak. Shut
the door, and when you’ve finished, I’ll give you
30 in a 100 for two nips. Look slippy, now !”
I “dried up.”

Extract from the next issue of the Bumrlh-
gum Scorcher
Mr. James Hobson, who runs the mail from Bumblegum
to Taramine, reports having been stuck up by a buslr
ranger on Saturday last about 16 miles from here. Tin
robber, who was masked, presented a revolver and ordered
Hobson to “bail up.” Hobson, being unarmed, did so,
and his assailant then seized and rifled the Taramine bag.
He then rode off, leaving the letters lying on die road.
The mailman collected them and took them on. From
our respected Postmaster we learn that the robber left all
the letters behind him (being probably disappointed at
their valueless nature) except one. This one bore the
seal of the Consolidated Bank, and the highwayman, n >
doubt, expected that its contents were valuable. But
Mr. Chapson, the able and courteous manager of the Con
solidated Bank here, informs us that the missing letter
was a purely formal one and of no value whatever. The
enterprising knight of the road is now doubtless consider
ing the Question—“ Is bushranging a failure?”

Then we all had a drink.
The
BILLIRA MARKERS
YARN
I
*A. WAS the billiard-maker of
® the Gin and Cloves Hotel —
A sandy man, with tender feet, no doubt you
know him well—
Who told this simple story, in his plain,
straightforward way,
Of the disappointed shepherds and the lamb
who went astray.
“ The meanest skunk,”
said Thomas (that’s
the worthy marker’s
name),
“ As ever came in here
to play a dirty,
sneakin’ game,
Was a swell we called
‘ the Kernel ’ —a tol-
lollish breed of bloke,
Who never said ‘ Good
day,’ but what he’d
offer one a smoke.
“ You must know that
this ’ere Kernel used
to lounge about the
room,
A talking of his ’orses,
and his kerridges,
an’ groom;
He didn’t sport no jool-
rey except a slap-up
ring,
And if we had a Pool
he’d drop his shil-
lings like a king.
“ Three months or so I’d I hi
know’d ’im, when I
put it to the chaps
As the Kernel might be good to work a swindle
on, perhaps,
Tor he give me the impression that he fancied
he’d a show
To hold his own at billiards with old Chorley
Clitheroe.
“ Old Chor —there ain’t his equal for a puttin’
through a toff —
Had been ’avin friendly games with Mister
Kernel on and off ;
And when the Kernel beat him then the old ’un
used to kid,
As he hadn’t got no nerve for playin’ billiards
like he did.
“So the boys they sit and watch ’em, O ! so quiet
and subdood
And remark, in stagey whispers, as the Kernel
was ‘ too yood,’
And how he seemed a gentleman wot wasn't up
to snuff,
Or else he’d land old Chorley for a tidy lump o’
stuff.
‘ But the Kernel didn’t seem to want to have no
money down ;
At first the most he played for was a modest
’arf-a-crown,
And when the game was over, let him win or let
him lose,
He was sure to ask the company to order in their
booze.
“ Yer can’t make brass by drinking —we was
almost in despair
Of gettin’ at our juggins with the ’igh and
mighty air—
When at last he says to Chorley: ‘Will you
play me for a stake ?’
And Chorley, after kiddin’, said he would—-‘for
friendship’s sake.’
“ A ‘level thousand up’ for fifty sovereigns was
the game;
Old Chor. put down his ‘ pony ’ and the Kernel
did the same;
TB4 ,
/ |Cerr,e i
A doctor held the money and was chose ag
referee,
And the boys rolled up next night the bloomin’
sacrifice to see.
“ We brought up Ikey Gizzard (’im they call the
Golden Dook)
And several other chaps as makes a ready
money book,
And if we loored the Kernel and his party on
to bet
We was promised ’arf the sugar what the layers
was to get.
“ The Kernel had a crowd of toffs to come and see
him play ;
They backed him for their “tenners,” when they
heard what we’d to say,
Before the game comm-need, and when he got
in front of Chor.
By thirty points, or so -we made ’em back ’im
for some more.
“O’ course we kept on kiddin’ that old Chorley
was a muff,
And the toffs, quite fresh and innercent, kept
pilin’ on the stuff;
But when I called ‘six hundred h’all,’ I sex to
Choi’., I says,
1 Don’t you notice some improvement in the
way the Kernel plays ? ’
“ ‘ Well, when you come to mention it,’ says
Chorley, ‘ I believe
This covey has been keepin’ of a trifle hup his
sleeve,
So I think it will be safer now to let him ’ave
more show.
Just tip the wink to Ikey, and I'll teach ’em all
I know.’
“ Then Chorley has a brandy, and he don’t put
down his cue
Until he plays a purty little break of sixty-two—
‘ A hundred pound to forty !’ shouts out Ikey,
when he’d done.
The Kernel took that wager, and the trouble
then begun.
“ Tor he catches up to Chorley and ho works a
bit ahead,
And he has a sudden genius for a-shovin’ down
the red :
He never leaves Chor. nothing but a blessed
‘ double baulk ’ —
To cut the story short, the Kernel did us in a
walk.
“ Tlie bookies dropped
1 three - fifty,’ alto-
gether, on the deal,
And of course they had
to settle, howsoever
they might feel.
The Kernel shouted fizz,
and said he’d never
played so well—
While all as Chorlcy
uttered was the hex-
clamation ‘ ’ell!’
They never come again,
not after doing of
the trick,
And to talk about the
Kernel turns my
stuoumick fairly sick;
All faith in human nature and religion it
destroys
When a masher has the meanness to come robbin
of the boys.”
EDMUND FISHER.
“In Memory of
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Jimberoo, on the Upper Meroe, Never-
Never Land, has always been reckoned a hot
place —in more senses than one. It’s temperature
was nearly always a hundred in the shade, when
it wasn’t a hundred and ten, neither grade being
conducive to strict abstention from alcoholic drinks
in a place whore there was little better to do than
hoist one’s toes on the arms of a “ squatter’s” chair
and discuss the prospect of being able to get away
for the next “Cup.” If by any chance the ther-
mometer took an occasional deviation either below .
or above its two normal points, then it was felt
that the occasion required celebrating with more
copious libations than usual, and when it rained,
which happened once in two years, the entire
township got drunk with tho greatest promptitude,
and remained in that condition till the heavens
had resumed their normal placid aspect. The
somewhat nomadic population of squatters,
drovers, bank-officials and Government hacks, to
say nothing of the doctor and lawyer, were all
pretty well “seaspned,” but we were not altogether
without aspirations towards better things, for one
Sunday long Sandy M’Dorrald, the overseer at
Warribridi, having a very sore head and remem-
bering the days when he would gang to kirk at
hatne, tried to get up a “call” to some saintly
body of elders away south to send along a parson.
“ And they’re rare ylns for the whuskie, mon,
some of these Presbyterian meenisters,” he added
as an extra inducement. But as, after discussing
the matter till the original subject was almost for-
gotten, we could only guarantee an annual stipend
fund of nineteen pounds seven shillings and three-
pence, we were forced to abandon the idea.
The arrival of a new resident was always an
■event at Jimberoo. Consequently, when a fresh
accountant arrived at one of the local banks, vve
■gave him as hearty a welcome as we had given his
predecessor a hearty send-off the week before.
“ Hardly up to our mark, but not a bad sort,’’
was the verdict.on John Marchland. Ho was a
little man, placid of speech and mild of manner,
with kindly eyes and a good matured face. Ho
had not been long in the bank and was about to
keep himself on the munificent salary of three
pounds a week, and not only keep himself but—
Heaven help him ! —a wife.
If John March laud was little and quiet his wife
was certainly large and loud. They had been
married a month, and'she was the daughter of his
boarding-house keeper in B . A full-blown
rose with a complexion liberally got up and a style
of dress that made flash Harry, the drover, ejacu-
late, “ Well, this is a stunner !” it was easy to see
that John Marohland’s married life would pro-
bably at times be stormy, and it was also equally
easy to see that he worshipped the very ground his
wife trod on.
Tor two or three months, except in the way of
business, we saw little of the new bank-clerk.
Our ways were apparently not his ways, he shrank
from the constant invitations to drink or play a
hundred up, or “ put a shilling in and th« winner
shouts,” pursuits of which the common or bachelor
bank-clerk apparently never tires ; he always
returned to his cottage immediately the bank
closed and was rarely seen later.
Tew could help noticing that his face got
careworn as time went on, and there were
rumours, traceable, of course, to the ten-bob-a-
week servant, that matters were not going
smoothly in the Marchland household.
“The missis wus a-givin’ it dm awful last night,
she wus,” confided this young lady to her bosom
friend next door ; “ poor dear man, ’es as quiet as
a blessed lamb, but she’s a reg’lar she-devil, and
they do say, too, as she ain’t no better nor ” —and
here the conversation went off into private and
probably slanderous possibilities; but. however
this may be, it was evident that to John March
land the vulgar, tawdry, over-dressed woman he
had taken for better or for worse was a goddess to
be loved indeed. One had only to notice the
almost ludicrous look of pride and affection with
which he watched her every movement, to be sure
of this.
In the meantime, as the year passed, things went
from bad to worse, for Marchland began to drink.
It was not that ho drank regular.y and “on
principle,” as did the rest of us. But now and
then he would come into the parlour of Host Mike’s
hotel and, sitting alone, would drink silently till
the potions, acting on an unaccustomed brain,
rendered him oblivious to all his troubles, and we
knew that on these nights his wife would probably
have left him alone afier a violent quarrel, and
that he was drinking to forget, if possible. It
was the old story of a man driven by an over-
mastering Tate.
One evening, when John Marchland had
been at Jimberoo barely a twelvemonth, be re-
returned home, looking more careworn and wor-
ried than ever; and with reason, for his pockets
were full of unreceipted bills ; and although the
up-country storekeeper is more than lavish with
his credit, still there comes a time when even his
patience gives out.
“John,” she said, “I must have twenty-five
pounds. ’
“ Good God, Annie, you know I have not five
pounds in the world ; and there is no one I could
get it from.”
He was wrong there, for almost any of the
“boys” would have got him the money; but he
would not ask.
“But I tell you I must. It’s no use telling me
that you are in debt and cannot get it. Your own
fault, for being in such a miserable place. Twenty-
five pounds I must have by to-morrow, or I will
leave you for ever.”
John Marchland clutched at his wife’s dress.
“Don’t say that, Annie, don't say that—any-
thing but that, dear.”
“ But Ido say it. Get me the money, or I will
never see you again.” And, with a bang of the
door, she left him.
At the bank next day it was very plain that
John Marchland had been drinking heavily— so
much so that he barely knew what he was doing.
To himself it seemed that on every cheque, on
every bill, on every page of the ledger, he could
see nothing but the sum o: twenty-five pounds.
The overdrafts in thousands, the accounts in
hundreds, the fat balances of the local butcher
and storekeeper all bore their relation to this
wretched account of twenty-five pounds—a
miserable sum, indeed, but how far beyond his
reach ! As the day wore on, his burning head and
throbbing eyeballs (for lie had been drinking even
in the bank) .could no longer bear the strain ;
dazed with drink and care, he was about to close
the books and go, when How Long, the gardener,
came in to make a deposit. It was twenty-five
pounds, exactly, in notes.
Half-an-hour afterwards John Marchland came
to his h me.
“Annie,” he said, holding out his hand, “ here
is the money—kiss me ”—and he staggered on to
the conch arid fell into a drunken sleep.
When he awoke he could remember nothing at
first, but it was plain that he had slept long, for
the sun had risen on a glorious summer morning.
. Then he caught sight of a letter placed con-
spicuously on a table near, it was addressed in his
wife’s handwriting and, tearing it open, he read
the contents.
With the money you have given me I am starting by
the night coach to B . You can send me from time to
time what money I shall require.—Annie.
Then he remembered everything. Deserted, and,
not only deserted, dishonoured too, it came sud-
denly to the man that he had only one alternative
left, the usual resource of those too weak to
wrestle with this rough world. Placing his wife’s
photograph before him on the table, he wrote on
its back a last message.
Good-bye, dear wife, you will get the insurance-money
and can pay back the bank. Good-bye, dear.
A moment later, two clicks of tiie trigger and John
Marchland was dead.
* * #
Twelve months afterwards we were dis-
cussing in our usual lazy manner all possible topicf
—from the fate of Europe to the winner of the
Cup—when the mail came in. One of our number,
who had secured a copy of the leading B daily,
suddenly startled us with a profane ejaculation,
He held out the paper in silence—we all looked,
and in the obituary column was the following
notice :
MARCHLAND.—In memory of John Marchland, who
departed this life Kith August, ISS—.
“Thou art not yet forgotten, dear,
Although the days are dark and drear
Without thee.”
Inserted by his sorrowing and loving widow, Annie.

THE JOYS OF POULTRY-PA RMING.


TERRIBLE TOMMY: THE BOY BUSHRANGER.
A SUNDAY SCHOLAR’S STORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
CHAPTER I. —THE ROBBERY.
■ / ? Hp=p
WAS evening.
The sad, sweet glam-
our of twilight was
settling down slowly
but surely on Wombat
Gully.
The tall gum-trees growing on either side of the
r oad that ran through the Gully whispered weirdly
to each other in the solemn stillness, like the
muffled conspirators in a melodrama.
But no sound came from the dark river running
thousands of feet below; perhaps because ther®
was no river; perhaps because a passing com
positor had drunk it up. The true reason wil
probably never be known.
It was a savage scene, worthy of the pencil of
Salvator Rosa, who would delight in painting it
as a drop-curtain for the Minstrels if ho were not,
unfortunately, dead.
Some such thought as this would, no
have been passing through the mind of the soli,
tary figure sitting on a log by the side of the road
if he —for the figure was human had ever heard
of Salvator Rosa.
But he had not—a sad evidence of the results
of irreligious education.
* * #
His face was pale ; his eyes dark and
mournful, but with something in them that told
the observer they could on occasion dart a glance
as deadly as the basilisk’s. On his head he
wore a cap of curious construction which looked
strangely like an old hat with the brim cut off.
He said it was the scalp of a schoolmaster.
His other attire consisted of a coat and mole,
skin —he called it policeman-skin —trousers, and
two odd boots, several sizes too large for him,
which he referred to as mocassins.
In his belt were stuck what appeared to be a
carving-knife and a handsaw.
He said they were “ yataghans.”
Across his knees lay a shotgun, with an
enormous barrel, which he stroked caressingly,
from time to time addressing it as “ Grave-filler,”
“Corpse-maker,” “Coroner’s Joy” and other
cheerful names of that kind.
He seemed to have a grim humour and fine play
of fancy for one so young.
For he could not have been more than twelve
years old at the most. And yet—but we are
anticipating. What brought this small boy out
so late in such a gloomy spot ?
’Possum-shooting, perhaps.
Ha! Ha !
# « *
Suddenly the silence was broken by the
sound of wheels.
It was the coach from Broken Hill bowling
gaily along with a cargo of bearded diggers on
board bound for Adelaide with the intention of
painting that quiet city a lurid vermilion before
they left it.
There were eight horses in front. It had been
found necessary to use so many on account of the
weight of gold—mostly in nuggets of the size of a
cottage-loaf—which the diggers would insist on
bringing down with them.
The driver was the celebrated “Brummy”—a
reckless desperado who had once shot a man who
differed from him over the spelling of a word, but
was pardoned for his marvellous skill as a “ whip.’’
On each side of him sat a trooper, armed to the
teeth, who had been sent to guard the coach—
which also contained a chest of golden ingots sub-
scribed by the generous miners of Broken Hill to
the Victorian Temperance Society, care of Mr. S.
A. King, editor of the Licensed Viotuaeleu*
They had been jesting with “Brummy” about
the absurdity of having an escort on such a seeir 0
road, when, as the coach came to the top of ti e
hill and was plunging into the gloom of the gully,
he gave a wild whoop and threw the reins of the
eight horses into the air, catching them dex-
terously as they came down with his teeth.
Anyone who could have
seen the troopers at that
moment would have
noticed that the bronzed
hue of their cheeks had
turned to a livid green.
‘ ‘ Brummy ” chuckled
softly to himself. But
suddenly as he caught
sight of the figure sitting
by the side of the road
it was his turn to look
green.
“ It’s all up with us,
gentlemen,” he muttered
with a savage impreca-
tion, for “Brummy,”
being the best driver on
the road, naturally swore
up to that level and some-
times cousiderab’y above
it.
“ What's up :” asked
the troopers, who bad
begun to recover their
courage somewhat.
“Everything, ■
you ! Do you see any-
thing on the. side of the
road there ?”
“ Yes, a boy—wait-
ing to get a lift very
likely.”
“Waitin’ to get a lift.
Oh, ye-',” and he laughed
bitterly; “ waitin’to get
a lift of what’s in this yer
coach, and you, too, if
yer not mighty civil.”
“Why, who is it?” asked the astonished
troopers.
“Who is it,” replied “Brummy,” who had a
habit of repetition when he wanted to be parti-
cularly contemptuous.
“ It’s Terrible Tommy - that’s who it is.”
* # *
The troopers laughed incredulously and
said, “Just leave him to us. We’ll soon settle
him.*’
“All right, gentlemen, but I’d better tell you
before it’s too late that he’s sent more o’ your kind
to where there ain’t no free drinks than you’re
years old. But if you will tackle him do it an’ I’ll
try to ’old the ’osses. I’ll probably see you both
again where you’ll be the chief features of th®
entertainment, as the play-bills say.”
“Where might that
be?” they enquired.
“ The Coroner’s in-
quest ” —with a grim
chuckle.
These remarks had been Interchanged rapidly
and the coach was now within about a hundred
yards of the small motionless figure.
“Perhaps the poor boy’s asleep,” said one
trooper, loosening his revolver.
“ Or dead,” muttered the other, doing the same.
“ Brummy ” merely snorted.
Suddenly as the loading horse came within a
dozen yards of him the
figure sprang into the
road and pointing his
shotgun at the driver,
said in a sweet treble,
“Have the goodness (he
was always polite, was
Tommy) to stop this
vehicle for me for a few
moments.”
“Why, what’s the
matter, Tommy ?” ex-
claimed “Brummy” in
a wheedling tone, doing
as he was told, neverthe-
less.
“ Now, tell those gen-
tlemen beside you to be
kind enough to step
down,” continued the
voice, ignoring the ques-
tion.
“Do, or you’re bleed-
ing corpses,” whispered
Brummy, “ he was never
known to miss his man
yet.”
But the troopers had
too much reputation at
stake to obey without the
show of a struggle.
Both blazed away at
the same moment.
The horses plunged a little, but Brummy held
them with wrists of steel.
Tommy laughed scornfully and Stood there urn
moved and uninjured. Just then one of the
diggers inside looked out to see what was the
trouble. , ...
“ What is it, Bill ?” enquired those inside,
“ Only a kid m the road bailm up the coach
he growled.
" Go out and kick him,” they suggested.
“ He’s got a gun,” said Bill drily, “and a boy
with a gun is as good as a man while his ammuni-
tion lasts. Perhaps one of you fellows would like
to go out ?”
“ What’s the gun like?” cautiously enquired the
man who had made the suggestion.
“ Looks like a shotgun with a mighty big barrel,”
was the reply.
* * *
While this conversation had been going on
among the passengers Tommy stepped forward
and cried in short, sharp, but still melodious tones,
‘ Enough of this nonsense, if you please. My
time is valuable. I have not the good fortun e
to be a member of the force.” This tickled
“ Brummy ” so much that he nearly let go the
reins with laughing. “ Gentlemen,” said the
diminutive brigand, “ I give you thirty seconds
to consider what you are going to do. You ob-
serve you are covered.” Then a wonderful thing
happened. The huge barrel of the shot-gun
opened out like a fan into little wicked-looking
barrels that ranged round the whole of the com-
pass so that the small desperado looked like the
hub of a wheel.
The troopers got down.
“ Deposit your revolvers there,” indicating a
place a few yards away. “ Now go and stand in
that spot of moonlight.”
They did.
“ And now, gentlemen,” he continued, address-
ing the passengers, “ I am sorry to put you to
this temporary inconvenience, but please step out
one by one and stand beside those gallant officers.
First, however, inform me if you have a lady
inside.”
They replied in the affirmative, and a stout, old
lady carrying a basket came forth.
It contained eggs, she said, which she was taking
in to the Melbourne market. “ Good young gen.
tleman,”she cried, falling on tier knees before
him, “ don’t rob me. I’m a poor lone widow with
nothing but this little basket of eggs.”
“ Say no more, good mother,” said the gallant
boy, “ you and your eggs are safe from me. It
shall never be said that Terrible Tommy ever in •
jured a woman. I only regret that the exigencies
of my situation prevent my emulating the example
of my distinguished predecessor, Claude Duval,
and asking you to do me the favour of joining me
in a minuet on the greensward—l mean the road_
But, perhaps, I may have that happiness another
time. Meanwhile, just step out and sit down on
the bank there while I settle with these gentle-
men. I won’t detain you long.”
The old lady got out and sat down with her
precious basket of eggs in her lap.
Tommy knew as well as she did that the
“ eggs ” were nuggets, but he was too courteous
to let her suspect this.
Tommy never forgot he was a gentleman.
The diggers got out after her and stood in
a row with the two troopers.
“ My valiant friends,” said Tommy, addressing
the latter, “you will do me a further favour if one
of you will step inside the coach once more and
push out to the other end a small chest you will find
inside. It is addressed in care of a friend of mine>
and I will take charge of it for him till he calls
for it.”
In the course of a few minutes the box was in
the road.
“Now, then,” said Tommy, gracef. lly placing
one foot upon it and addressing the diggers, “I
wish to say a few farewell words to you. You
may think my conduct strange and perhaps even
uncalled-for on this occasion. But you will ba
grateful to me in after times when you come to
consider the matter calmly. This is what,
when I attended school in the vanished past,
my teacher—poor old man ! 1 had to shoot him ;
he would be so exacting in the matte :■ of
long-division used to call an object lesson.
You were on your way to Melbourne when
I, fortunately for all of us, stopped you.
You were going to throw your money away in
foolishness and, perhaps, worse. You would have
been robbed anyhow, so that you see I am really
your benefactor in limiting your immoral courses.
You will now kindly step forward and each de-
posit half of his money in a line with the door of
the coach and then enter with my bhssing. . I
trust to your honour not to deceive me in the
amount you deposit.”
Touched by this genei’ous conduct each digger,
as he passed by, dropped about a tenth of what
he carried in the spot indicated and got into the
coach again.
Tommy was in too great a hurry to get away
with the box—a fortune in itself —to let on that
he knew this. As the old woman passed by with
her basket he took up the largest nugget in the
pile and handed it to her saying with a smile,
“ Good mother, allow me to add another egg to
your basket.”
Covered with confusion she stumbled in with
’ he others, and then, turning to the two troopers,
Tommy said to them, “I shall not ask you for
any money, gentlemen, but as I have put you to
some inconvenience I beg you will each accept the
largest nugget you can find in the pile as a small
contribution to the building of your first terrace.
/ Tl d now, good-bye, and convey to your friends of
the Police Department my best wishes. Get along
V> rummy.”
* * *
As the coach disappeared down the road
the passengers could still see the small figure of
the young bandit standing in a path of moonlight
in the same position with one foot on the box. .
Presently he gave a cat-call and four or five
figures of about his own size emerged from the
moonlight.
‘ ‘ All right, Cap’n ? ” said one interrogatively.
“All right ?” recreated Tommy contemptously_
“Did ycu ever know me to fail? Take that box
aw.iy and place it in the old spot.”
When they had gone Tommy shut the gun up
again and laughed. “To think the blessed fools
' could be frightened by a lot of stair-rods.” But
in a moment his eyes assumed the old mournful
expression and he sighed, “This is an exciting
pf e —b u t I would give that chest of gold for a slice
of bread and jam.” Then passing his hand across
his brow he murmured fiercely, “Perish these
maddening memories !” and strode after his com-
panions into the darkness.
* * #
Tommy and his band were captured that
night in their cave. One of their number—a
dastard by the name of Billy Jinks —had betrayed
them. Tommy swore, while the deadly basilisk
light glittered in his eyes, that even if he had to
wait a hundred years for
it he would get even
with Billy Jinks.
And he did—but ol
that anon.
Terrible Tommy was
not taken without a des-
perate struggle. With
his own hand he slew
four of his assailants—all
strong and powerful men.
As the fourth fell with a
dull thud on the rocky
floor of the cave Tommy
heard the sound as of
broken glass, and a strong
odour of rum pervaded
the atmosphere.
Ho looked down and
discovered that the noise
and the smell came from
a bottle in the pocket of
the deceased, which had
been smashed in his fall.
A rapid combination
of familiar recollections
caused him to turn over
the face of his slain
enemy.
He staggered and gasp-
ing wildly “ Oh, heaven,
I have killed my old
man !” fell backward into
the arms of a policeman.
# # #
Weeks after when Tommy came out to be
hanged, the good chaplain asked him if he had
anything to say before he was worked off.
“Yes,” he replied, in a solemn whisper, “tell
all the boys you know who stay away from Sunday-
school and want to be bushrangers to take warn-


mg by me and repent in time. ”
And the good chaplain said he would.
Then the white cap vas drawn over Tommy’s
eyes, there was a sudden jerk, and he awoke with
his father bending over him.
He knew it was his fat hr because of the spiri-
tuous smell of his breath.
“Then I’ve not been hanged?” murmured
Tommy, while the cold sweat of terror stood thick
upon his brow.
“No, but you will be one of these days if you
don’t alter your ways,” replied that respectable
parent; “get up out of this at once and fetch me
a shillingsworth of rum and tell them to put it
down with the other lot. ”
Tommy rose up, and as he did so a book fell out
of his bed. It had a flaming-pictured cover re-
presenting a boy of about his own age with a re-
volver in each hand and a proud smile of defiance
on his lip standing upon the bodies of two police-
men and keeping four others at bay. It was
entitled “ Dare-Devil-Dick—the scourge of the
Never-Never. ’ He had fallen asleep reading it
the night before.
“ After this,” said Tommy, with earnest fer-
vour as he hid the bottle for his parent’s rum
under his waistcoat, “ I’ll turn good boy and go
to Sunday-school regularly—if it kills me. But I
know that part of my dream about Billy Jinks
must mean something. I never thought much of
him, anyhow.”
# * *
Five little years rolled away and Terrible
Tommy was in a Land-Boomer’s office—the smug-
gest, sleekest, most respectable of clerks—and
teaching regularly in a Sunday-school.
One day he met Billy Jinks, who had lately
come into some money, and, taking him aside,
said confidentially, “ Billy, would you like to go
in for a big thing ’”
“ Would I not ? ” answered Billy with emphasis.
“ Then I can put you in for it—l do it for the
sake of old times, Billy, because hundreds of
people would give their ears to be put in for it.”
So Billy went in for it to the extent of ad-
vancing Tommy pretty well all the money he had
received as a legacy.
“ You’ll wake up a millionaire one of these
days, Billy,” said Tommy, asking him to have “ a
bottle of fizz ” out of his own money.
Tommy invested the coin all right, and sold the
property for eight times its value a month after-
wards.
It teas a good thing. Tommy had told the
truth so far.
But that was the last Billy saw of his money.
Tommy has an office of his own, and is now one
of the most promising young business-men in
Melbourne, and everybody says he has a great
future before him because he is so religious and
so steady.
One day a forlorn-looking creature with touzled
hair and a hungry look in his eyes came to
Tommy’s office.
“ Well,” said Tommy, in his brisk business way,
“ what do you want ? ”
“ Don’t you know me, Tommy ? ” said the for-
lorn creature in broken tones.

there was nobody about to hear him.
“ I’m Billy,” exclaimed the other bursting into
tears, “ and I’m starving.”
“ Sorry to hear it, Billy, but you ought to ia\e
looked after your money when you had it, and —
really, you know-the affair is not mine, and I’m
busy. However, here’s half-a-crown for you and
don’t call again till I send for you.”
As the door closed behind poor Billy, Tommy
said to himself: “I never thought thereuasmuc
in Billy Jinks and now I know it. But it was a
blessed interposition of Providence, that dream
This business is a heap more profitable and less
risky than being a bushranger.’

A Journalist’s Funeral.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a new sensation to be in a coffin, with a
hearse all to myself as the sole passenger. I had
exhausted all other sensations, and this seemed to
be the last. Strangely enough I was not afraid—
the utterly novel experience acted upon me like
hasheesh. I actually enjoyed it in a dreamy con-
templative kind of way. You will at once per-
ceive that I was not dead at the time, or I would
not be writing this now.
Two dismally shabby cabs crawled after my
conveyance, and I noticed with mingled envy and
indignation (so far as I could be touched by eithe r
of these feelings) that they stopped at every hotel
on the road—in order that the mourners might
have an opportunity ot drinking my health, I
suppose.
In the state of trance—for that was what it
really was—in which I was at the time the mys-
terious faculty, sometimes vaguely called the sixth
sense, must have been developed. I heard what
my mourners were saying about me as plainly as
if I had been sitting beside them, while the hearse
went slowly grinding along the dusty road to the
cemetery.
‘Me was nobody's enemy but his own—poor
•Tack !” said Mr. O’Connell, blowing through the
stem of his pipe to clear it. And out of the glass
windows of the hearse—paid for, as I discovered
afterwards, by a generous theatrical manager
whom I have written slightingly of on many
occasions, but who, thank heaven, still survives to
be repaid by my borrowing a tenner from him the
first time we meet—l saw, through all intervening
obstacles, this stout, dark b'ttle man making rings
(mourning rings, I suppos* vith his tumbler on
the bar-counter of the hotel.
And at once there flashed upon me a memory.
It was a moonlit night in summer six years ago—
ah, those happy days when I was so miserable !
I was on board one of the small steamers that
run from Circular Quay to Mossman’s Bay. Sit-
ting beside me in a great grey coat which, with
his head peering forward predaciously, so to
speak, gave him the appearance of a bald-headed
eagle, was the brightest and lightest writer I
have met in these lands. He was not given to
serious reflection as a general thing, and I was
somewhat surprised when he turned to me sud«
denly and said in a tone of gloom so intense that
it was almost grotesque : “ They may say any-
thing they please about me when I am dead, so
long as they don’t say ‘He was nobody’s enemy
but his own.’” And that is precisely what they
did say, word for word. He has been dead for
some years now, but his imitators have been many
and one or two have almost succeeded in catching
something of the ring of his style—reminding me
of the tall skeleton in Goethe’s ballad who is
climbing up the steeple of a church to get at the
sexton, and, when he has almost attained the top,
falls to the ground, a heap of bones, the moment
the cock crows.
We —that is to say, the hearse, the under-
taker’s men and myself—were about a mile ahead
of my mourners just then. I noticed them
coming out of the fourth public-house on the
road wiping their lips, and then the two disgrace-
ful shandridans came tearing along, full-gallop,
after me. I also noticed that there was another
funeral approaching by a cross-street. There
seemed to be no end to it. I remembered that
it was the final procession of a prominent old
pirate who had died a few days before me, and
had been kept in state (on ice) till then. He had
risen to affluence and a title by usury during
six days of the week, and carrying the
plate around in churches on
the seventh. He had most
of the city folio wing him to
where he was going to sleep
in hopes of a glorious resur-
rection. And I had only
a wretched queue of two after
me—a, man of poetry and
learning—a man wh j had
hauled upon the Archimedean
| wer till it almost snapped
with the strain ! It was dis-
gusting. If I could have
only got out of my coffin and
on to the box-seat of the
hearse I would have made a
vigorous dash—the proces-
sions being somewhat mixed
■—to divert the traffic and as-
sume the lead of the retired
pirate’s cortege and let my two shabby cabloads
go to mourn over him!
But they had overtaken us by this time—all
, , ~ ... ~
talking together and smoking like chimneys.
“ Well, there’s no use Crying over spilt milk,
boyg » ( nobo dy was crying that I could see, so this
. ,
must have been a mere facon de purler) said the
sub-editor of the paper to which 1 used to contn-
bute most of my work. “ He’s dead, and that’s
ad t bere ; s about it. Brush away those tears !
(Spoken melodramatically—there were no tears.)
' 1 ... ~ . . , , '
I’ve got to get out here to start on my work, dead
or no dead.”
Which he at once proceeded to do, and went on
his way with long strides and a slight lurch.
And this man I had considered a genuine, if
n t particularly demonstrative, friend of mine,
. •’ ’ .
The miserable tail of two cabs-looking like
desperate bailiffs on wheels—followed me until it
cam e to the next pub. Then it detached itself
aga in and the occupants shambled out. Presently
voice sai(] .. Poor ld b , He , g l kto

him wherever he goes. He was never afraid of
hot weather. ”
“ Not while there was any drink around,” re-
marked Jim M'Cann, draining his pint of shandy-
snlendid swi*
% ‘ ~, g ‘ . „ A u.u
Plent y where’s he’s going,” said M‘Nab, the
commercial man, “ he always liked his liquor hot.’'
And then this perjured calumniator of the dead
began to tell a string of the most outrageous
fictions concerning what he and I had done when
we had been on “ tears ” -together—things which,
if they had ever happened, would have got us into
gaol or the lunatic-asylum half-a-dozen times over.
Yet, he actually intended these astounding fabri-
cations as a tribute to my memory ! It was his
idea of a funeral eulogium.
“Well, gentlemen,” said the first voice, “I
must leave you here. I enjoy a spree as much as
anybody, but I have some special work to do, and
I can’t neglect it. See the old boy planted truly
and well.”
And he went off. “Nice lot of heart-broken
mourners I have, ” I thought.
My old friend, Tom Dorgan, who had never
said a word all this time, except that it was a fine
day for a funeral, then observed, “ The mourners
are thinning out, Flynn.”
“Yes,” replied Flynn (a kindly cynic in his
way), “ they mostly do at the end of. any funeral
of this sort. You see ” —(it was an amiable char-
acteristic of Flynn’s that when he had an audience
cooped up in a corner —and what better corner
could be found than a mourning cab ?—he held
that audience at his mercy, which wasn’t much)—■
“the poor old boy had to die. He didn’t time his
drinks, you know. All the time was his time
when liquor was about ” (another atrocious per-
jury), “ and ’’—jerking his thumb in my direction
—“he has made all his time his own by it. Besides,
the strain upon his intellect in writing comic para-
graphs was enough to kill an emu. I’m beginning
to feel it tell upon me, myself. ”
At this there was a muffled laugh—out of
respect to the feelings of Flynn, I suppose.
“ I want to get out at South Melbourne,” said
a husky voice from the corner of the cab.
It appeared that this gentleman had got into
one of the cabs while the mourners and drivers
were in a pub., saying what a fine fellow I was if
I could only have kept sober one day a month or
so, and being in a somewhat intoxicated condi-
fcion, had mistaken it for one of the cabs that plied
on the road to where he lived.
“ I’d like to inform you, sir, that you are at a
funeral, and respect shall and will be shown to the
illustrious dead, or there will be trouble,” said
M‘Ginnis Walker, of the Press Bureau, for the
first time. And with that M‘Nab hustled the
gentleman violently into the road. As soon as he
had picked himself up he tore off his coat, threw
his hat down, and challenged the entire funeral,
offering to smash up the whole party and dance
upon the corpse (regarding which he made certain
coarse remarks that almost caused me to burst
through my trance with rage).
But the funeral passed on and left him prancing
around in a ring and defying everything within
the circle of the horizon to come on and be ground
into powder.
Soon after another mourner left. He said ho
would be late for dinner if he didn’t get out it
once and his wife would be very angry if such a
tragedy occurred.
And he departed.
‘‘ He was not a bad fellow—he was my best
friend, boys—this has cut me up terribly—have
you got a match, Flynn ?” said M‘Nab, the com-
mercial man.
“He stole two of my best original stories,"
growled M'Ginnis Walker, “but I forgive him,
now he’s dead. I stole them myself.”
When we arrived at the grave there was only
one mourner—M'Ginnis Walker, and he was
asleep in a corner of the cab. All the rest bad
either got out or fallen out on the way. Tom had
been overcome by his grief at the last pub., and
M‘Nab had been taken in charge by a policeman
for offering in a public place to fight anybody
who would dare to say that I wasn’t the best all-
round genius that had lived since the time of
Shakespeare.
I felt two or three dull thuds on my coffin-lid
and awoke with a jump.
-“ Mother of Glory!” I yelled, “ what’s this ? ”
About a yard of the bedroom ceiling had fallen
upon me. That was all.
I wonder if this will be anything like what will
occur when I die ? I don’t care in the least so long
as, in the words of my friend gone before, they
don’t say, “He was Nobody’s Enemy but his
Own. ”

And many simple signs denote
He is a Barmaid’s “ Boy.”
Behind the bar Miss Flossy stands;
The girl is slim and dark,
And washing glasses gives her hands
A kind of ruddy bark ;
But ah ! she is a graceful dear,
So fresh and trim and smart:
Not stout and bitter like the beer —
Although a little “ tart.”
Woung Freddy stops a solid hour
To gaze in Flossy’s eyes,
And soon the rosebud from his coat
Upon her bosom lies ;
He swallows half-a-dozen drinks
With rapture and delight,
At last the wearied syren thinks
“ It’s time to say good-night.”
His fingers Flossy’s fingers press—
How thrilling is their touch !
He’d like to snatch a fond caress,
But Flossy knows too much.
(Of all the womenkmd we meet,
There’s none can be so coy,
So altogether quite discreet,
As barmaids with a Boy.)
Young Freddy takes a fond farewell,
And struts away on air
(Who knows the power of barmaid’s spell,
Unless he has “ been there ”?)
Another Boy comes strolling in
As Freddy turns his back ;
That rosebud, fastened with a pin,
Brings happiness to Jack.
Then Flossy hears it all again,
For Jack is also young,
And sings the old familiar strain
Which foolish Fred has sung ;
And, after Jack, on Dick and Tom
Her arts she must employ—
There is no rest for Flossy from
The ardent Barmaid’s Boy.
They come and go, they go and come—
Boys dull, or bright and quick :
She hardly gives a thought to some—
The others turn her sick;
Mechanical the witching glance
She sheds on all the batch,
And Floss ignores each decent chance
To make a decent match.
She might have Bertie if she chose,
The notion makes her smile ;
And as for Freddy, goodness knows
He’s not at all her style;
Such youngsters may be straight and true,
As some among them are—
They haven’t learned the way to woo
Young ladies at the bar.
For all their roses and their gloves
The girl cares not a jot,
One man, in truth, the syren loves,
A lazy, reckless sot;
Pert, pretty Flossy’s peace of mind
Her “ fancy ” will destroy—
The Barmaid is at least as blind
As any Barmaid’s Boy.
And, doubtless, after many days
(When Freddy and the rest
Have settled down to sfiber ways
And gi> en barmaids best),
To Floss, in Time’s hard lesson schooled,
This thought will oft occur :
That, while her Boys she lightly fooled,
Her “chap ” was fooling her.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Chapter I.
Jim Killen, the puntman, and his mate
Tom had just swung back their pontoons after
-letting the old Pride of the Murray and her
barges drop through from the wharf, when the
exhaust of an incoming steamer was borne pant-
ingly on the languid evening air. Jim put his
hand to his ear to catch the sound more distinctly.
Like most of the dwellers by the river-side he
could distinguish the various boats by the tones of
their escaping steam.
“It’s the little Lizzie,” he growled to his
assistant. “S’pose I’ll have to let her through !’’
“’T’aint the Lizzie, Jim. It’s Maltby’s Hero.’’
“ Get alon’ with you, you Sydney-side crow.
Think I don’t know ev’ry twist and turn of the
little woman’s steampipe. Listen there now—
she’s down by the park, and she always speaks so
when she’s that far. ‘ Open the bridge, Jim ;
open the bridge, Jim !’ that’s what she says, and
none but a denied fool of a cornstalk what don’t
know a side-saddle from a stern-wheeler would say
dif’rent.”
“Lor’, Jim, don’t get shirty, old man,” said
Tom, who, being a Sydney-side native, was con-
temptuously regarded as a “colonial” by Killen
(imported by Government at a cost of £2O 3s 4d
in the days of assisted immigration). “ You know
better’n me, of course. But what are you goin*
to do ? You won’t let her through to-night ? It’s
after knock-off time, now.”
“ W’en a cove as don’t know a steamer from a
barge wants to boss this bridge, I tells him to shut
up straight. So now, Tom Hopwood, shut up.
The little Lizzie’s a’goin’ through if the skipper
wants her !”
And though the dusk was fast settling down
into the long, sweeping reach that was crossed by
the floating bridge, and though the steam-whistle
of the crane engine had shrieked the knock-off
signal full fifteen minutes before, Jim swung wide
the crazy old pontoons into the muddy stream.
They swayed on their hempen hinges sullenly and
oreakingly, as though, too, convinced that it was
quite time to end their . jng day’s work.
The men hauled in one rope, slacked the
bight of the other, and waited for the steamer.
Tom had shirked his pull somewhat, and Jim
knew it. But he heeded his mate’s ill-temper as
much as he did the mutual grinding of the pon-
toons, or the vexed beat of the river-ripples as
they wrestled with the crumbling bank. If the
Lizzie wanted to go through she should, and if she
didn’t, well, it didn’t matter. So Jim, surly and
precise always, and surly and precise in a double
degree when it was a case of swinging his bridges
after hours, resolved. Jim, like many a better
and many a worse man, was, as he himself ex-
pressed it, “a bit weak on the womanines. ” That’s
what he used to say when accused of favouringthe
Lizzie by letting her pass the bridge at all sorts of
unreasonable times and periods. But there was
the Victoria and the Emily Jane, and half-a-
dozen other boats with feminine appellations, and
the Alice, and he would never budge from the
strict mark of duty and routine for them. And
this circumstance—coupled with the fact that
when flour was £7O a ton at Wilcannia and
potatoes £l5, and the great Cumberocfna and the
little Lizzie, both loaded to the pilot-house with
produce, were starting at the same moment for the
drought-smitten Darling township, he had acci-
dentally jammed a pontoon against the Cum-
beroona’s starboard paddle (thereby smashing the
box and several floats) —had tended rather to dis-
credit his affected partiality for the sex. “ It
isn’t the Lizzie Jim favours,’’said “Gus” Pierce, of
the Undaunted, the satirist of Riverina. “ It’s
the Lizzie’s mate ! ” Gus was right; though it
scarcely needed his keen vision to discern as
much. Anyone with the proverbial half-an-eye
could have perceived the true cause of Mr.
Killen’s willingness to oblige the Lizzie. Cer-
tainly no one who noticed how, on this September
evening, the ruggedness of his face softened as th©
“ mate ” hailed him, could have failed to under-
stand the motive for his acts of favouritism. For,
sure enough, it was the Lizzie and her consort, the
Wombat, that with great animalish gaspings and
pantings stemmed the strong river, and forged
breathlessly round the willowy bend, through
the pontoons, past the half-buried bull of
Cadell’s old Lady Augusta, to her berth
under the wharf - crane-«. “ Thank you,
Jim,” shouted the “mate” from the pilot-
house, “ you’re a good soul to let me through to-
night. It’s worth ten pounds to me.” And a
flattered smile ironed out the furrows in Jim’s
countenance, as he waved his hand in acknow-
ledgment of the words. High-pitched was the
majestic voice, but there was a note of mournful
music in it which Jim, with his rude fancy, com-
pared to a curlew’s cry. No man's voice could
claim that trill, surely. The mate of the Lizzie
was a woman.
Chapter 11.
There had been the very devil to pay on the rivers
when Capt’n Ringsley—who, after running one
season under M'Culloch’s flag, and another under
Whyte, Counsel’s - had,inthethird year, purchased
the little Lizzie with her barge Wombat, and put
his wife to the wheel. It was done as a joke at first,
the mates and deck-hands thought, and they
entered into the spirit of the freak. They cheered
the little woman as she piloted the craft in and
out of shoaling channels, by snaggy gullets, and
over treacherous reefs. And they “ put their
money on ” her and the Lizzie when it came to
racing the big Princess or the stately Cumberoona,
for what the more powerful boat gained in steam-
ing, the little ’un more than won back by the deft
way she was handled. And they worked with
new vigour when wrought upon by the kindly
criticism of her glance.
When, however, in the beginning of Capt’n
Kingsley’s fourth river season it was made
apparent that he was shipping no mate, but that
his pretty, youthful wife, a mere slip of a girl she
was then, was going to take turn and turn with her
husband, the skipper, there was open rebellion on
the part of the Lizzie’s crew, and deadly anta*
gonism, covert and overt, from the hands of other
boats. Men whom the event directly concerned,
men whom by the widest stretch of imagination it
could not be conceived to concern, joined in the
row. The whole river population—from Albury
to Goolwa, from the Wakool Junction to Wagga ?
and from Wentworth to Wilcannia—were in
agitation. The mate whom Mrs. Kingsley dis-
placed had almost as much to say on the matter
as botty Bill the loafer, who never had a wash
except when he was thrown into the river in a
squabble, and who never did an honest day’s work
out of gaol.
Unto Captain Richard Kingsley came Captain
Freeman, Inspector for the Melbourne Under-
writers. “You’re frightened of the insurances,
are you, Mr. Freeman?” politely inquired the
former. “ Now, my wife doesn’t get drunk. And,
tell me, how many down cargoes come to grief and
the river’s bottom through a drunken mate at the
wheel?” Captain Freeman walked away.
Unto the Captain came a deputation of skippers.
“Look here, gentlemen,” he said, “ I’ve a little
girl down in Melbourne. She can’t live with us
on the river or in Echuca—the weather’d kill her.
My wife does a mate’s duty, saves a mate’s wage>
and we keep that child where she has a chance for
life. It’s my wife’s own wish-, not mine, and as I
haven’t paid for this boat and barge yet, I don’t
intend to cross her.”
Upon the heels of the skippers’ deputation there
came a number of deck-hands. “Men,” said
Kingsley, “I’m skipper of my own boat !*’ They
persisted. “Men,” he said, “If you don’t like
my service, clear.” And they did so. Not that
they were afraid of trusting themselves to the
“ mate’s ” skill, but the idea of being bossed by a
woman galled their manhood. And as no other
men would till the revolters’billets, Kingsley filled
up the vacancies with Chinese. He could not
foresee that in enlisting nine or ten odorous Ah
Fats and Ah Leans and Moy Sins on his wages-
sheet he was placing the axe to the roots of his
life and his fortunes.
They served him and the missic-matie admir-
ably. Whatever the Pagan was put regularly to
do, he did with that unerring instinct of imitation
in which consists his intelligence. As deck-hand
and rouseabout, as stoker, as cook and steward,
as lumper of wool-bales on the river-banks, as
outter-up of firewood and stower of cargo, John
was active and untiring. But where initiative
and readiness of wit were required he was almost
as miserable a failure as a new-chum who berthed
on a river-boat to earn tucker “till his remittances
arrived.”
Captain Dick stuck a sounding-pole in Ah
Ling’s hands one afternoon on an up-river trip.
“ Ah Ling, you put stick in water, and when
water comes to this mark you call “By the mark
—three. And to this mark —four, and to this
mark —five, and to this mark—six. You savee?”
After half-an-hour’s patient instruction, Ah
Ling “ saveed,” and the skipper relieved his wife
at the wheel. They were in a long, deep reach
where the ten-foot pole should not touch bottom.
Dick thought he’d test his pupil.
“Sound, Ah Ling,” shouted the Captain.
“ Sound!”
With a coolness that indicated a mastery of his
business, the Chow dropped in the pole and
boldly sent forth the awe-inspiring cry of “ By-
y’-mark, Fwee!”
“Three! Heaven!” There was no shallow
ridge, or bottom thereabouts, but a great snag
must have shifted into the boat’s course—and the
Wombat was down with produce seven feet ! In
a second the skipper had his wheel hard down,
and the engine-room telegraph had been signalled
“ full speed astern,” and the bargeman shriekingly
ordered to “stop ’way.” Dick recovered from
the fear of seeing his crafts snagged in mid-stream
just in time to hear Ah Ling repeat the last
words of his lesson—“By-y’-mark, six”—and to
hear his mate, Nell, who had rushed forward,
laugh with a laugh that was a half-sob —“Go
ahead, Dick, it’s over the pole. This gaudy old
parrot doesn’t know any better !”
Another day Andy M‘Bean, the Lizzie's en-
gineer and the only white man who had remained
on board after the Chinese invasion told his
stoker, Sun Leo, to watch the steam-gauge, while
he, Mac, made up, by a short nap, for the loss of
sleep during the previous night when they had
been running till the small hours. “Water get
down here, Sun,” said Mac, pointing to a safe
point on the tube, “ you come and shako me !”
Mac coiled himself in the shade of his wood-pile
and slept the sleep of the just man and the tired-
out engineer for a couple of hours. Then he was
awoke by the hiss and the bite of scalding steam.
Sun Lee had been relieved on the night watch, but
if his boss slept in the day time why shouldn’t he?
So he allowed his silky eyelids to droop over the
almond orifices through which his soul looked out
on the world, and he. too, slumbered sweetly
while the steamer plodded along the Twenty-mile
Reach, and the water in the boiler evaporated,
and the tell-tale in the gauge got lower and lower.
Sun Lee and his brother heathens were nearer
Heaven at the moment Mac woke up than they
were ever likely to be again, unless some other
steamer’s boiler blew up. “ The closest shave I
ever knew,” breathed Andy to himself, as he
flung open valves and cocks with trembling fingers,
which did. not lose their tremulousness till they
had encircled Sun Lee’s dreamy eyes with grimy
rings of puffy flesh.
A close shave indeed ! So close a shave that
the skipper and mate henceforth had to do double
duty, because they could not trust any single
Pagan further than they could see him. For the
mechanical routine which an educated donkey
would have gone through with ease John was
invaluable ; but as to all else he wasn’t worth his
ration of rice, Kingsley would have thrown the
individual and collective Chinese overboard but
for the “missie matie.”
Chapter 111.
She stuck to the Chows when Kingsley’s better
judgment would have sent them adrift.
“ Dick, there’s Katie, and, dear, I don’t like to
be beaten. I’ll work double, but go back to the
old plan I won’t. I’ll not confess we’re beaten.
We save forty pounds a month by having them
aboard. That’ll buy us a new barge next season.
And, Dick, how the rivers ’ud laugh at us having
to own up we’re wrong.”
So six-foot Dick, with the broad shoulders and
the bronzed face, was wheedled by his fatherly
love and his wife’s cooing and his skipper’s pride
into continuing a very foolish policy. He was
manly enough to face a crowd of drunken deck-
hands when they rushed from the wharf-side
on to the Lizzie’s deck to avenge the insults to
their class implied in the engagement of the
Chinese; manly enough to face them and strong
enough to thrash them. Nevertheless, his love
and his pride made him weak, and he kept to his
plan. He worked double-tides himself; was
skipper, deck-hand, mate, and bargeman in turns.
And worked his wife, too, double-tides. The
rougher work she could not, of course, manage;
but her little hands grasped the wheel almost con-
tinuously while steam was up. She would stand
in the pilot-house for nine and ten-hour watches,
clad in neat blue serge with bright brass buttons.
Beat the sun ever so hotly, or blew the wind
ever so blastingly, she kept her post. In her
long spells of duty she learnt the river so
thoroughly that no other mate possessed an equal
knowledge. She knew all the landmarks and
guiding points, and where the water shoaled, and
where the currents would lodge the snags. She
threaded with delicacy of touch the boat’s way
under overhanging gums to dangerous landing-
places, and up shallow channels to wood piles, and
when she was at the wheel the boat seemed to steal
from her something of womanly felicity of move-
ment, and went in and out of the pinches and
bends with a more graceful swaying of her stem
and a softer beat of her paddles. By the close of
Kingsley’s fourth season, his mate Nell was the
most accomplished steering-hand, bar Bill Davies
and Ted Barnes, on the three rivers. Even the ri yer-
men who hated Kingsley for his alliance with the
Celestials admitted as much. When six steamers
and nine barges were stuck up by the falling water
at Campbell’s Island, Kingsley’s mate put the nose
of the Lizzie straight up the channel, and with
swift, nervous balancing of the wheel, drove her
through devious cross-cuts and over treacherous
spits of sand that masked ghastly snags beneath
their glittering whiteness into deep water.
“ Damn’d if she war’t take th’ craft over wet
grass nex’! ” cried the Riverina’s mate, Jim
Morris, with an honest chord of admiration ring-
ing in his rough voice.
And if you think anybody on the rivers desired
greater praise than that, you don’t know the
Murray boating trade !
* # *
The close of that fourth season brought
them, though Capt’n and Mate Kingsley knew it
not, the beginning of the end. Fate had dealt
out to them some first-class cards, but she had
made the shuffle with her hand covered with a
poisoned glove.
During the summer off-season when the rivers
were down, and the boats laid up, the Kingsleys
visited Melbourne to taste the rare joys of a sweet
home life for a few months. After one happy day
spent on the St. Kilda Beach beneath ti-tree
clumps, in and out of which the father and mother
played hide-and-seek with their laughing child,
the Capt’n strolled into the baths. He rolled
himself luxuriously in the pungent waves as was
his wont in the greenish Murrumbidgee after a
warm day’s work on Hay Wharf ; and shewed the
other bathers a trick or two of fancy swimming.
But they looked strangely at him as he leapt out
of the water, with a curious shrinking feeling
made visible in their glance. For upon his head
and limbs and body, like miniature moons sur-
rounded by rose-flushed halos, were white spots
encircled with pinkish aureoles. All over him,
from the broad forehead that he had held aloft as
a frontlet of manly pride in the face of all men,
to the curving ankle which it would have defied
the skill of Phidias to mould in marble, the horrid
blotches appeared.
He saw the things himself. As he gazed upon
them, scarcely alarmed as yet, and with no
dawning of the awful truth glimmering its
way into his brain, his strength went from him—
the strength which had nurtured the copious
hairiness of the massive chest whereon the spots
clustered most closely—and he fell, a log, on the
deck of the bathing platform.
One only of the bathers drew near him - a young
doctor. “ Keep back all ! ” the latter cried,
and then ordered blankets to be brought. With
careful touch he covered Kingsley up, and then,
striving vainly to overcome a natural repugnance,
whispered to the barely conscious man, “ Where
do you live ?” Dick told him, muttering with a
feeble discordance, and prayed : “ What is—the
matter with me?”
The doctor rose up, and motioned the staring
bather’s and attendants away. They obeyed the
gesture—some who were half-attired gathering up
their garments, and dressing as they went.
The doctor knelt again by Dick’s side.
“ Are you a man ?” he said. “Canyou take—a
blow ?”
“ Yes,” answered Dick, “ if you—don’t hit—my
wife—and child—as well.”
“ The blow will hit all you care for.”
He paused, and the air was heavy with the
respirations of the two men before lie went on.
“ You are a white leper—and a dead man !”
Chapter IV.
The old order of things partially resumed its
sway on the steamer Lizzie and her consort, the
barge Wombat, with the beginning of the
Kingsley’s fifth season. A white-man crew
superseded the spawn of the lazar-house. But
Jim Morris, late of the Riverina, was skipper,
while Matie Nell retained her post. The rivers
did not object to that arrangement when they
were told that Capt’n Dick had been smitten by
mortal sickness and would never finger wheel-
spokes again. Upon the news, the great heart
of the river manhood gave one sharp, short beat
of gladness, and then another of shame at itself,
•and then went on pulsing regularly in sympathy
with the little woman.
The rivers did not know how awful was the
doom that had overtaken their erstwhile enemy.
Nebulous popular belief shaped itself at last into
the notion that Dick’s masterful brain w*»s
"Are yo u the Cove"?
“ Arc you the Cove?” he spoke the words
As swagmen only can ;
The Squatter freezingly inquired,
“ What do you mean, my man ? ”
“Are you the Cove?” his voice was stern,
His look was firm and keen;
Again the Squatter made reply,
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“O ! dash my rags ! let’s have some sense—
You ain’t a fool, by Jove,
Gammon you dunno what I mean ;
I mean—Are you the Cove ? ”
“ Yes, I’m the Cove,” the Squatter said ;
The Swagman answered, “ Right,
I thought as much ; show me some place
Where I can doss to-night.”

INDISPUTABLE EVIDENCE
OF SUPERIORITY.
DR. REDWOOD, Ph.D., F.C.S., F.1.C.,
Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.
“My analytical and practical experience of Pears’
Soap now extends over a very lengthened period—nearly fifty years
“during which time

thrown out of gear by a sunstroke; and it was
good 0r Nell that nothing of the ghastly
truth penetrated to the quick intelligence of the
boatmen. Deck-hands would have fled the Lizzie
as a thing accursed, and stevedores would have
refused to handle freight. For the river men
would have concluded—and justly—that had
Capt n Dick kept himself from contact with the
leprous brood the hideous canker would not have
rotted his splendid virility. When a white man
clutched poles, and ropes, and fenders, after
Chinese paws had slimed them over, what could
he expect but that some of the slime should stick ?
That is what they would have said had they
known. Fortunately, they knew next to nothing.
Fate was so far merciful.
Only, of all Riverina, did Jim Killen the punt-
man know. A worthless son of Jim’s had died in
Wbntworth Hospital while the Lizzie lay at the
wharf at the junction township. Nell had nursed
thb scamp in his last hours with sisterly tender-
ness. Thereupon Jim had raved that what he
could do for the Mate he would do,
“The Mate, she loosed my Ned’s warp-lines
gently, an’ he hadn’t to let go with a thud,” he
had said when he spoke of the incident.
Up to the coming upon them of Kingsley’s doom
Killen had done no more than throw an occasional
ten-pound note into the Captain’s way by dropping
the- Lizzie through the pontoons after hours, so
that the boat might have first chance with a dis-
engaged crane. But in the hour of her extremity
Mate Nell thought of the puntman. Dick craved
to return to the river-side; he would live in a bark
humpy or a tent, he said, anywhere, in anything,
so long as it was within sight of a river and
within the sound of a steamer’s whistle and ex-
haust, and where he could sometimes see his wife.
And Nell took the puntman into her confidence.
He helped her. “So Capt’n Dick’s a-goin’ with
the stream, is he?” he said. “I never liked that
Chow bus’ness, but I’ll help you for Ned’s sake,
Mrs. Kingsley. You let Ned’s warps drop quietly
into the current, ma’am, an’ the Capt’n shan’t go
with a rush, if I can help it.”
He built a rough humpy on a thickly-timbered
twenty-acre block he had purchased on the Moama
side, and there Dick was brought by night-stages
from Melbourne. In the late autumn this hap-
pened, and with the first winter rains the rivers
were “ up.”
The season promised to be a long one. The
Hay, Balranald, and Wentworth wharves still
were burdened with back-block wool left over
from last season. Every station bn the river and
out back was crying out for produce, and stores,
and sawn timber, and the late wool would give
return cargoes till the new clip was rushed down.
These bright prospects made Dick desperate!
He moaned in his gunyah tomb, and fretted his
hfiart away quicker than the scaly patches ate
into his flesh. The next seven months should
have given him fortune, and instead he was being
offered death!
•Every sound of nature or of man pained him
with a sharper than physical pain. The steam-
saws at Macintosh’s mills on the opposite bank
tore him with their teeth ; and again and again he
suffered the throes of dissolution as he pictured
himself being crushed between the gigantic logs
that fed their steel maws. That was all he was fit
for—to throw himself beneath the logs. Other
men could carve the timber into shiny, golden
sovereigns, each of which would melt into some
joy or buy some happiness—but for him, the only
timber he needed was six pine planks for a shell 1
Then the laughing-jackass would stop in his
work of snake-hunting to cast a sneer at him from
the crown of unstripped gums, and the young
cioadae would join in the taunting chorus from the
teeming grass. And he would deride himself for
being their revengeless sport.
Then the rippling stream, on which he dared not
look in day-time save between the interstices of
thick foliage, stung him with its jesting whispers.
It asked hiin why he did not drag money from its
bosom, and when he did not answer itself answered
for him. It flaunted an iridescent bubble on its
surface that momentarily mirrored his dreadful
features.
So with everything. The monotone of the
curlew was the wail of his despair, the steam-
whistle spoke to him defiantly and dared him
ever to disturb the forest glades with its shriek
again; the fluff of the wattle showered upon him
the jingle of the gold whose hue it had stolen.
Ihe distant hoarseness of the men as they called
the soundings and the screech of plumaged parrots
made him shiver, for they reminded him of Ah
Ling and he knew now the significance of the
tiny spot on Ah Ling’s neck! And the sky,
whether it glared in brassy brilliancy or opened
its storm-fountains, tortured him, for the one
aspect told him the hot sun would draw down the
mountain snows, and the other bade him reflect
how the swollen tributaries would pour their
wealth into the main streams and give the boats
another month of activity when every hour would
be worth a yellow coin. Life mocked him at
every turn.
So, in effect, he saw on the slate, which, his sole
means of communication with the living world in
his wife’s absence with the boat, he was accus-
tomed to leave on the border of his woody prison •
and Jim Killen, reading the chalked words with
laborious eyes, muttered, “ He’s a-goin’ looney.”
And when, in the September night on which we
saw Jim first, he waited at the head of the cutting
after throwing the bridge across the stream, for
Mrs. Kingsley in order to escort her through the
darkness to the leper’s home he recalled the words
so that he might break to her the frenzy of her
husband.
“ What news, Mr. Killen?” she asked, shaking
his hand. 8
Bad, Im afraid, ma’am. He’s loosing his
lines in a way I don’t like. He’s a-goin’ looney.”
“Oh, God!” She could say no more, but fell,
trembling, against a wattle that, shaken by the
pressure, dropped a golden snow on her head.
Oh God ! That is too much !”
He put on the slate two days ago, as near as I
remember, these words :
h&ve cursed God, And yet He lets me live.
T. very snakes laugh at me when I want them to
bite me, I took a tiger-snake to bed with me last
night, and lam alive still. Say the word, Nell
and I will kill myself. I won’t do it till then
because I promised you. But say the word
darling. ” ’
“Oh, Mr. Killen, Oh, Jim, what shall I do’”
wept Mate Nell.
Jim knit his brows painfully. “You won’t be
vexed, ma’am ?” he muttered, at last.
“Vexed, Jim, my friend! How could Ibe
vexed ?”
“Well, I’d say the word, ma’am, It ’ud be
most merciful to you, an’ him, an’ the little
daughter !”
“Never, Jim, never ! Better be a leper’s wife
than the widow of a suicide’!”
“ It’ll be that in any case, ma’am. But if you
"•;>n t say the word you’ll just have to stop with
him.'
“He won’t allow me !” moaned Mate Nell. “ I
did not want to start this season—l wished to
stop with him. But he said we would be.robbed
if I did not go, and no one could watch the rivers
as I would!”
To watch the rivers was necessary to play the
game of speculation successfully. An exact cal-
culation which would get a boat and barge loaded
with produce down the “ summer-level ” Murray
in time to meet the first freshets of tne Murrum-
bidgee or Darling, might win a couple of thousand
pounds, while an error of a few hours would entail
the loss of hundreds. And it took the owner’s eye
always to note the rise and fall of the stream, so
Dick thought.
They moved on—-the man wondering how it
was all going to end ; the woman stupefied and as
in a dream, the dilated pupils of her eyes alone
showing she was awake to the horror that awaited
her.
Chapter Y.
The next down-stream trip from Echuca, Mate
Nell was mate of the Lizzie no longer. She was
“bargeman ” of the Lizzie’s barge, Wombat, and
the old bargeman had taken her place on the
steamer. And aft on the barge, in a newly-built
compartment, went—a passenger.
Nell wouldn’t say the word which would have
released Dick from his fate, and he wouldn’t let
her remain with him. To leave him alone was to
leave him to madness. So in the dead of the
night, before the Lizzie next cleared the Customs
for Hay, a tottering spectre, sheeted in greyish
cloths, stole from out of the shadows down by the
path through George Air's ship-yard on to the
punt, and thence to the Wombat’s cabin.
* # *
The men wondered at first that they had
not seen Oapt’n Dick come aboard, but their
delicacy forbade a syllable of their surprise to
reach the ears of Mate Nell. And then Killen
dropped a hint here and there in mysterious
accents how he had seen Capt’n Dick, “An’ he’d
take his oath Dick was a gone looney.”
Down to Hay, and thence to stations beyond
for late wool; up to Echuca again ; up to Tocum-
wal for a short timber-trip and back to the port
once more to fill up with stores and wire for which
the big Bidgee stations were ravenous, went the
Lizzie and the Wombat. Another quick run would
have followed with the first-clipping of the new
wool, and back again to race the Victoria for the
Burrabogie and Hunthawang clips. First come
first to load, was the rule of the two crack
stations, and their freight carried an extra pound
per ton of “greasy,” and thirty-shillings for
* washed,” for the balance of the Lusitania’s cargo-
room was booked for their wool, and, filled or not
the ocean freight would have to be paid. Up to
Burrabogie, beating M‘Oulloch’s boat by half-a-
day, and back to Hay, there to top up with
Hunthawang bales, and thence home for Christ-
mas. This was the plan.
Golden trips in golden weather, all these pas-
sa&es ! Every hundred revolutions of the Lizzie’s
paddles minted a sovereign as the Leper calculated
on his slate. If the water would hold up till
January or February they could then sell the
crafts, and, with the proceeds added to the
season’s earnings, bid the rivers farewell. They
would seek thereafter some distant home-and
wait calmly for the end! This was Capt’n
Dick s notion, for once back on the river, the
swish of the floats as they churned the water,’ and
the throbbings of the pistons, imparted something
of their restless vigour to his enfeebled system,
and thoughts were struck out of him as masterful
and bold as in the old days.
“We shall have a happy Christmas, after all,
■Nell,” he wrote on his slate, and passed it through
the partition to his wife’s hands, just before they
left Pollard’s Wharf, at Hay, on the last trip of
the year.
“ grant it, dear !” she whispered, as she
went out to trim her barge.
The wharf-loungers cheered the little woman as
the barge drew by, and wished her the best of
good luck, and the happiest of Christmases, and
the speediest of recoveries to the old man. Por a
moment, the cloud lifted, and against hope she
hoped and believed their hearty wishes would come
true. As Skipper Jim sounded the last whistle
she turned and kissed her finger-tips to the throng.
, became a tradition, that kiss. The glory of the
river-trade has departed, but the memory of Mate
iSells farewell lingers yet in nooks and corners of
the .Riverine country.
Por Hay never welcomed Mate Nell again.
* # *
The craft had reached Canoon when the
water fell suddenly. That very morn the sun had
risen hery red, and as he ran his course he trailed
n * urtl scorc hing blasts and steaming mists
that wanted only a solitary spark to link the
heavens to earth in a chain of flame.
And the spark fell!
, n .the great reach, 15 miles below Canoon,
Morris found he had to run a gauntlet of fire.
Magnificent eucalypti bordered the sorrowing
stream with spires of flame, and the tangled under-
growth spread the lurid contagion from clump to
clump with an unquenchable rapidity. Por miles
in their front, miles on either side, and miles to
their rear, the torrent of fire rolled on, roasting
boat-hands with its heat, barring return with
mammoth trunks that fell hissing into the stream
and threatening to stop their egress from the fur-
nace with like impediments.
Every eye on the steamer was strained with a
forward gaze, and none noticed that the piles of
wool on the barge ignited. The bales had not
been tarpaulined, and a fiery shower from a
thicket of ti-tree had set the packs ablaze. Nell
was the first to see the fire from the barge-bridge
where she held the wheel, and she cried for help. ’
Some of the steamer-hands rushed to save her
at the moment, the Wombat reeled and
shuddered as she struck bottom. Drawing two
feet more than the steamer, she was aground.
Morris put full towage way on the Lizzie. The
paddles lashed the cindery current into foam, and
the great shaft seemed as though it would burst
from its bearings with its Titanic strokes. But this
effort had the most fatal of results, for it severed
the tow-rope. As a bird freed from a cage, the
Lizzie sprang forward and left the Wombat
aground and wrapped in her cerements of smoke
and flame.
There was no returning. The shoaling water
threatened the Lizzie with the same fate if she
delayed her advance. Morris lingered till death
had nearly completed his leaguer around him and
his men also, and then, then, went ou—leaving
Captain Dick and his Mate Nell on their funeral-
pyre.
Perhaps it was fancy, perhaps not, but Morris
looking back, thought he saw a woman’s hand
eofc itself from the smoke as if waving a k'ss
‘ hor little Kate,” Morris whispered. “Por
little Kate! ”

Measuring the Baby.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We propped our crowing cherub
Against the parlour wall,
A dado topped the wainscot,
And the boy was just as'tall—
A pink and yellow dado
Of fashion quaint and new,
Relieved by pea-green roses
And buttercups of blue.
We measured that noisy infant—
Our latest young re-ruit—
With fond, parental chuckles,
For a tiny sailor suit.
And the greasy fists of Bobbie
Fell fast on mamma’s nose,
As she took his dear dimensions
And kissed his restless toes.
His eyes were bright as diamonds—
His lips were damp and red —
A few weak flaxen tresses
Were sticking to his head ;
And we said, ’twixt sighs of rapture,
Like this life’ll not remain—
When Spring brings round her jonquils
We’ll measure our pet again.
Ah me ! with a smile of sorrow,
And a laugh of deepest woe,
We have measured the sturdy baby
We breeched six months ag >;
And the bandy legs, then dimpled,
And the mottled arms so strong,
And the little trunk of Robert
Are twice as fat and long.
That pink and yellow dado,
Once level with his head,
Now reaches past the middle
Of our darling’s back, instead ;
And the clothes his mother makes him,
Although they bag at first,
Scarce last our growing treasure
A month before they burst.
We measured the costly baby
With ribbons snowy white,
Marked off in eighths of inches,
For another suit to-night;
And out of the dadoed parlor
We rushed with a stifled sob :
■ v y o,l ld that the distant angels
Might come and call for Bob !
EDMUND FISHER.
The Cruise of the In Memoriam;
Or The Ship That Came Back.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The wan light of a stormy dawn
Lit up a tossing ship ;
It was the In Memoriam
Upon a mourning trip.
Wild waves were on the windward bow,
And breakers on the lee ;
And through her sides the women heard
The seething of the sea.
“ O, Captain !” cried a fair widhw,
Her white hands olaspfed she,
“ Thinkst thou, if drown’d in this dread storm,
That saved we shall be ?”
“You speak in riddles, Lady dear,
How savfed can we be
If we are drown’d?” “Alas, I mean
In Paradise !” said she.
“ I’ve sailed North, I’ve sailed South ”
(He was a godless wight),
“ But, boy or man, since my days began
That shore I ne’er did sight!”
The Captain told the First Mate bold
What the fair lady said ;
The First Mate sneered in Ins black beard—
Quoth he, “I am damned !”
“ Full forty souls are here aboard,
A-sailing on the wave—
Without the crew, and, ’twixt us two,
I think they've none to save—
“ Full forty souls, and each one is
A widower, or widhw,
They weep the scuppers full ; the ship
Is waterlogged with woe.”
Again he sneered in his black beard,
“ The cruise is not so brief,
But, ere we land on earthly strand
All will have found relief. ”
“ Nay, nay,” the Captain said, “ First Mate,
You have forgotten one
With eyes of blue; the tears are true
From those dear eyes that run !
“ She mourns her sweetheart drowned last year,
A seaman he, forsooth !
I would not drown for Christ his crown
If she were mine, Fair Ruth !”
“ Brave words ! but words,” the First Mate cried,
“ Are wind ! Behold in me
The warmest lover and the last!
Mine shall the maiden be.”
. . • • • • • '
Fair Ruth stood by the taffrail high,
A cross dropped in the sea,
“ If you lie here, my sweetheart dear,
By this remember me !”
Fair Ruth stood by the taffrail high,
A ring dropped in the sea,
“ Marry him not, ye false mermaids,
For married he’s now to me !”
The heav’ns flashed flame ; a black cloud came.
Its wings the sky did span,
And hover’d above the fated ship
Like death o’er a dying man.
Bended the spars, and shrieked the shrouds,
The sails flew from the mast,
And, like a soul by fiends pursued,
The ship fled through the blast.
“ More sail! more sail!” the First Mate cried
(The Captain stood aghast),
“ More sail! more sail!” and he laughed in scorn,
All by the mizen mast.
“ O, brethren, dear, there's nought to fear,
The steward told me so !”
’Twas the parson meek who thus did speak,
Just come up from below :
“And were there,’ he said, with upraised head,
And hands clasped piously,
“ I have a sainted spouse in Heav’n—
I trow she waits for me. ”
Then grimly laughed the false First Mate,
“ Good parson, let her be !
I’ve a wife in every port, but that —
And that we shall not see.”
“ Oli pardon seek ! ’ cried the parson meek,
“ And pray, if pray you can,
For much I fear, by your scornful sneer,
That you are a sinful man.”
Then louder laughed the false First Mate,
Louder and louder still,
And the wicked crew laughed loudly too,
As wicked seamen will.
“ O, Captain !” whispered a gentle dame,
“ When shall we see the land !”
The Captain answer’d never a word,
But clasped her by the hand.
“Come Heav’n, come Hell,” cried the fair widbw.
“ For me—l have no fear,
I pray ye let me land where I
May meet my husband dear.”
The Captain turned him round and said—
“ If this wind holds to blow
Ye’ll meet in either place ere night,
But which—the saints may know,,”
“My love’s in Heav’n,” quoth the fair widow,
“For, when he passed from view,
In golden script on a marble crypt
They carved it fair and true.”
• •
Day after day, night after night,
On, on the ship did reel;
The Captain drank with the second mate,
The First Mate held the wheel.
Down came the black cloud on the ship,
And wrapped her like a pall,
And horror of awful darkness fell
Upon them one and all.
The night had swallowed them utterly,
None could his fellow see,
But ghostly voices up and down
Went whisp’ring fearsomely.
No faint ray shone from moon or sun,
The light of Heav’n was gone,
But ever the First Mate held the wheel,
And ever the ship rushed on.
. . . • • •
Fair Ruth knelt down in that grim gloom,
She prayed beneath her breath :
“ God carry me o’er this dread sea
That seems the Sea of Death !”
She ceased and, 10, a lurid glow
O’er that dark water spread,
And in the blackness burned, afar,
A line of bloody red.
“ What lights are yon?” the Captain said ;
The First Mate answered then ;
“ No lights that ever shone upon
The world of living men.”
“ Down on your knees !”the parson cried,
“ Thank God, for all is well!”
The First Mato sneered ; “Those lights, they are
The Harbour lights of Hell. ”
On flew the ship to ev'ry lip
An ashen pallor came,
For all might see that suddenly
The sea had turned to flame.
The lights were near ; the Sea of Fear,
Amid the silence dire,
On that dread shore broke evermore
In soundless foam of fire.
“ O, what are yon grey ghosts and wan ? ”
The parson cried, “ who seem
With coloured strings of beads to play,
As in a dreadful dream ?”
“Damned souls,” the First Mate said, “they sit
And count, through endless years,
The moments of Eternity
On beads of burning tears. ”
‘And who,” exclaimed the fair widbw,
“ Is that grim ghost I see
Who stands upon a rock, and girns
And wags his head at me ? ”
“Your husband dear,” the First Mate sneered,
“ At last you have your pray’r—
He says Hell is not Hell to him
Unless you, too, are there.”
“ Then, will you land, my fair widhw ?’•
(Full scornful were his tones) pt
“For you he aches, for you he makes
Hell weary with his moans.”
Three paces took that fair widhw,
Three paces on the deck, *“■
Then suddenly she turned and fell
Upon the Captain’s neck.
“O, Captain, dear, my mourning year
Is o’er—l would not own
That grinning ghost—while there remains
One man of flesh and bone !”
The wretched spectre heard the words,
And, in his anguish great,
He beat his head against the rooks—
Loud laughed the false First Mate.
Then “ Who are you,” the parson said,
“ That talks so free of Hell ?”
“ My name is Satan,” he replied,
“ Have I not steered you well?”
“ Back—back the yards !” the Captain cried ;
Then quoth the false First Mate :
“ Like many more who sight this shore—
You back your yards too late.”
“ There are the dear deceased you mourned J
With such exceeding zest, ,/ i:
They call you—whoso freely goes
E’en yet may save the rest.
“ Soul-saving is the parson’s trade,
He here may save a batch.
Where is he?—speak !” The parson meek
Was safely under hatch.
One pale ghost waved the vessel back
With gestures sad and dumb —
Fair Ruth has plunged into the sea,
“ My love, my love, I come ! ”
All in a moment shone the sun,
Blue gleamed the sky and sea,
The brave old ship upon the waves
Was dancing merrily.
And merrily to sound of bells *
To her old port full soon,
The In Memoriam, that went forth
Returned the Honeymoon.
There o’er their grog sea-captains still
Her wondrous story tell,
And how her Captain backed his yards
A biscuit-throw from Hell.

Woman’s Rights.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It is Woman’s Right to scrub,
And to cook our daily “ grub,”
But it’s not her right to search us when we come
home from the Club.
It is her right our bread to bake
And to fry our chop and steak,
But it’s not her right to think we should keep
sober for her sake.
It is Woman’s Right to say
Just what tve think, and she may
Do that, but musn’t think of hitting out in her
own way.
It is her right to dust and sweep,
And the house in order keep,
But it’s not her right to buy up things because she
thinks they’re cheap.
It is not her place to think,
And it’s not her right to drink,
Nor to ever want to visit a theatre or a rink.
It is Woman’s Right to know
What will please her master, so
She can bring the very liquor that will drive away
his woe.
It is Woman’s Right, you see,
To do many things, but she
Mustn’t trespass on the province of the Everlasting
He.

The New Pygmalion.
An Idyll of Flinders Lano.
He was a sculptor, possessed of an impossible
dream, a dream of finding amid the daughters of
Hve a woman that in her beauty should equal his
own conception. The modern method of patching
this girl’s head on to another’s neck, of selecting
good arms here, a bust there, and the rest where
one could, shocked him, and so the Cleopatra he
had dreamt of still lay in the marble, and he
wandered to Melbourne partly because of his rest-
lessness and partly because a friend had told him
’twas there if anywhere lie would find the model
he wanted. “Yonder in the fair South,” this
friend had said, “ where English blood has
wedded the sun-light—and, as yet, Fashion is not
nurse—women are as God intended them to be.”
. On® morning, ’twas at the end of his first month
in Australia, and so far he had been unsuccessful,
he sat in his studio in Flinders-lane looking at the
large block of stone he had bought out of his small
store of ready money, and wondering if his ideal
woman would ever find shape. Through all hin-
drance his soul saw her lying there, in the centre,
even now, with that glorious neck of hers rising
like a Roman column from out those shoulders
whereon kings, while empires drifted, have let
their heads linger, and the face and form of her
all quiet and passionless as she lay asleep in
oblivion’s embrace awaiting the chisel of her
awakener. Suddenly a rap at the door aroused
him from his dreams, and at his bidding a girl
entered ; there was an awkward pause, and then,
with much nervousness, she said:
“Mr. Clifford, I believe?”
Clifford bowed.
“ I hear that you are searching for a model., and
I came to ask you if I would suit your purpose.
My name is Clark—Sara Clark,”
The artist looked her up and down, and in one
big draught drank in all the lines and the curves
of her and their faultless beauty. She was
Beauty personified, and crowned as beauty should
be with the head and neck of a goddess. She
wore a dress of blue serge, a material made for
the betrayal of beautiful women, as elastic in its
hold as a man’s love, and as tender and constant
as a woman’s. The healthy mind of the maker
(the girl had made it herself) had thrown to the
wind all idea of the unnatural excrescences where-
with the modern woman improves on Nature’s
handiwork, and told the willing material, in
common gratitude to show all it dared of her.
“You will not only suit my purpose,” Clifford
said when the artist in him had absorbed its full
of her, “but you are the very woman I have
dreamt of. Will you really sit to me?”
X will sit to you,” she replied, now thoroughly
self-possessed and leaning, as she spoke, back
against the stone, “on two conditions. The first
is that I am well paid, for my people are very poor
and this appears to be my only chance of making
money honestly; and, secondly .”
“ The question of payment,” Clifford broke in,
“ need not be mentioned. I will gladly pay you
all you ask.”
. The girl nodded her thanks. “My other condi-
tion is that—that—how shall I put it ? I have
heard,” she continued, after a pause, during Avhich
Clifford wondered much what was coming “I
have heard that the reputation of an artist’s
model is not always of the best, and I must take
care ipf my good name—’tis all I have—will it bo
safe in your keeping ?”
Then from the deep hollows, at the bottom of
which hiseyes lay half hidden, flashesof angerleapt.
“ God forgive you, girl,” he said, “for placing t o
true artist on the same level as other men !”
The girl saw her mistake and her great safety,
and, promising to return that he might start work
by eleven on the morrow, left him. During that
day and night Clifford finished his roughing-in ;
and in the morning, punctual to the moment, the
girl came.
“ Here is your couch,” he said, “and you will
gather from this (pointing to the marble) how X
want you to lie. You will be half on your side,
lying restfully with one arm uncovered—thrown
behind your head, the other will lie at your side,
this piece of drapery will be thrown across you!
I think it will be sufficient, thee room is warm.”
Half an-hour after, as Clifford hung over the
girl and saw the accuracy of her death-posture,
pone of the truth of its deep origin dawned on
him, he knew nothing of women nor cared for
them, but as figures to carve from. The curves of a
breast, the rounding of a shoulder—or a brave,
graceful neck, moved him to his depths, but for
the human soul beneath he had no care, nor time
to think; love for him meant love for his art —
and all his passion went out in a search for it.
Had it been otherwise, he might—from the
very attitude of the girl—have learnt that the
death in her was not assumed. Her young life so
far had been no life at all, but merely protest—a
long, angry, deep-seated protest against the
powers that had planted her queen-like form in a
pauper’s home : the deep undercurrents and the
shallow laughters—the day-dreams of a tiny hand
in hers and a stronger one about her, that
mysterious going-out after sympathy; all these
and other like yearnings that play so great a part
in the building up and beautifying of most
women’s lives had neither part nor lot in her
making.
But the crimson curtains about the east wind’s
bed hide the coming day—the twins sleep together
—look, with the expectant dead, that way, and
while the cruel sister sleeps you’ll see young rosy
morn playing about the hills.
The girl was both—the biting blast when breath
was in her and beauteous morn when silence held
her dumb.
And so, sinless of posturing, she lay like some
white blossom on the earth, no modest snowdrop
with bent head and its “I am not worthy,” but
rather some wide-mouthed, thirsting lily drinking
admiration as its own ; across her loins a soft silk
scarf was thrown, and about her head for halo the
“ noli me tangcre ” of passionless indifference.
A month has gone, and the curious man—art-led
—is finding fast, beneath the rugged stone, the
queen he dreamt of. About the room, as thick as
snow, were broken fragments of stone—Nature’s
hiding-stuff—and all these four long weeks the
girl has, through her cold, grey eyes, watched the
coming.
The artist had been to her first a mystery, then
a study, and, last of all, an education.
His impatience and hungry eyes during the
early days, when the first rough work was done,
were as incomprehensible as his loving, tender
touch when Cleopatra looked through her
stone.
Sometimes, as wrapped in heavy rugs she sat
up to eat her meagre lunch, she would talk to him
of his art, and try to fathom it, but he would
speak but rarely and then in the strange language
of a rhapsodist.
Open-mouthed, the girl would listen while ho
told her that the figure there was the best part of
him writ in unalterable stone—his own creation
that sprang from his soul—“No, not sprang,” he
would correct himself, “but conceived one night
when the silver-sandalled moonlight crept into my
room and played about my bed, and from thence
brought forth, as all things great are, with pain and
travail. ’Twas so,” he continued, pointing to the
stone ; “the ancients told their dreams of beauty
and wrote their religions, and tired multitudes
stepped aside a moment from their labours and
grew silent and stronger in the truth of it.” Then
he would move over to his work and his love-
leaking fingers would dwell long and tenderly
about Cleopatra’s reposeful lips.
“How great it is to be a maker,” she would say.
Then he, half angrily: “I am no maker but a
valet only with some knowledge of my Masters’
secrets. ”
And so the days sped on, and the sculptor glad-
dened in his heart, and the girl softened in hers ;
for—and here’s the pity of it—what the chisel had
done for Cleopatra’s glorious form the watching of
i b had done for the model’s stolid heart—found it
and laid it bare.
In the long silences, and in the presence of a
love hitherto unknown, the coldness in her had
died away and from the warm north there had
come the whisperings of something better.
As she watched Clifford turn first to her with
the calm, cold, critical stare of a connoisseur, and
then back to his stone with paternal love, a mad
jealousy took possession of her, and it was the
all-devouring jealousy of a first love born late.
As breaks the lava through the snow-clad moun-
tain, so the torrent of her yearnings through “the
winter of her discontent.
One day, it was a hot-wind day, and the fever
of work was off him, Clifford was dismissing his
model before her time. She had just returned
from her dressing-room, and stood for some
moments unnoticed behind him, for he with bent
head and folded arms was worshipping at the altar
of his own creation. The maker of two women
stood between them, and all unasked poured upon
the cold, irresponsive stone that tempest of hot
love the other thirsted for.
Suddenly Clifford turned and faced the girl,
much of whose beauty had gone from her, in the
presence of this strange something, greater than
anything she had dreamt of, and because a new
hunger and thirst had her by the throat.
“ I shall not come again,” she said; “ you have
nearly done and can finish without me. ”
“ It is impossible—why, this hand is not nearly
finished, and my drapery is only roughed in—but
why —what do you mean by this sudden determina-
tion ? Has anything hurt or offended you ? ” then
his subtle eye caught the alterations in her. “ Has
some brute been prying into your dressing-room?
Has something frightened you? Of course you
will come again, but you must not look like that,
why your shoulders are fallen together, your cheeks
have sunk, you look hungry.”
“ 1 wonder,” the girl said at last, looking up as
she spoke—“l wonder if I look at all like you did
the first day.l,saw you ? You looked hungry, I
remember.”
“I was hungering, but not for bread—but,”
and he examined her again critically, “if you look
to-morrow at all as you do to-day I don’t know
that you need return.”
Then the girl went out; she was at first glad to
be away, in the air her breath came easier, her
love was not so oppressive out of doors, and back
to her home in that squalid street. Her father
had recovered somewhat and taken a job of bill-
sticking. About their one living-room there lay
parcels of posters referring to beer, soap, insecti-
cide, and other shrewd guesses at a people’s
wants. The room was dull and comfortless, so
was the studio she had just left; but the last had
suddenly become heaven to her, the other more
than ever hell.
Then an irresistible desire seized her to go back,
and giving her hand to her yearnings she was led
into the street again. At the corner of Collins-
street she stood a moment irresolute. All around
the brass plates of vaunting specialists peered
through the twilight. Eyes, ears, lungs, all are
cured, she thought, but broken hearts—no ! then
an aching desire to be alone seized her, and she
made for the river’s bank and saw the day go, and
the moon come to the hill-top and, throwing off
her mantle of cloud, step into her Kingdom of
Night. At her feet the calm stream slipped past.
So like her old life it was—muddy, perhaps, but
passive and passionless; and now all was
changed—a new horror hung about her as a
garment! ; T was not like hunger ; she had often
known that, and the sickening weight of it. ’Twas
not hopeless ambition ; she had felt that, too—all
her short life it had been there, in her breast
somewhere. But deeper down than either, a
hollow, empty cavern, where yearnings live, had
opened itself, and the breath of it made life cold
for her.
Then she rose and, with no definite object in
view, wandered, numb and past feeling now, back
to the city, and found herself come as a mere
automaton to the little right-of-way by the side of
the studio. Suddenly a noise within the building
, disturbed her and set her thinking—who could it
be?—not Clifford; he lived miles away. Not! —
no, it could not be her rival—she was only stone.
Lifting an empty box she placed it noiselessly
beneath the window, stepped on to it, and saw
the sculptor himself leaning over his masterpiece
He had placed three candles at Cleopatra’s head,
and moved every few minutes to see new shadows
fall and old curves with now light upon them.
Then ho took a deep breath, and, stepping back,
muttered in the words of the great singer—
Each part about her was a righteous thing.
Her mouth an almsgiving ;
The glory of her garments charity ;
The beauty of her bosom a good deed.
In the good days when God'kept sight of us,
Love lay upon her eyes,
And on that hair whereof the world takes heed ;
And all her body is more virtuous
Than souls of women fashioned otherwise.
Then the girl felt sick, and getting down from
her box went home. Knots of men at the street
corners made way for her, and even stopped their
babbling of shares to notice the vacant stare and
withered face of the young girl—a face full of
“grey old miseries.” Once at homo the incom-
plete thing threw herself upon the bed, and
staring at the ceiling saw, not in the brain but in
the aching heart of her, that the four corner-stones
of a perfect womanhood were four capacities—to
love, to be loved, to wonder and to resolve. Two
of these were hers already, the last she would get
and the second should be the child of it.
In the morning she rose and spent some time in
the framing and forgiijg of a letter that was sent
directly after breakfast to the studio. This letter
purported to come from a wealthy patron of the
arts living in East Melbourne, and requested Mr.
Clifford to favour him with a visit, hinting at a
commission that would probably follow the inter-
view.
The girl, from a stable where she had secreted
herself, saw Clifford take one last look at
Cleopatra, close the door, and start; then, as one
about to do murder she crept into the studio
locked the door and faced her rival, and the over-
flowing passion of a woman with blood in her
took possession of the stone— and they sneered at
one another; the girl could swear she saw
Cleopatra’s lips curl; it strengthened her in her
resolve, and seizing the mallet and chisel that lay
near she bared her strong arm for vengeance.
Taking her stand in front of the figure, she
looked it up and down, saw its great beauty, and
hated it the more. Suddenly the pent-up passion
of a woman’s love that, when dammed, stagnates
into cruelty, found vent in blows, and in less than
three minutes Cleopatra had gone to nothingness,
and was lying about the room in small pieces of
meaningless marble; then the girl crept back to
her hiding-place with the curse of Cain upon her.
She had scarcely hidden herself when Clifford
turned the corner. He had the hang-dog look of
a man who, for the first time in his life, had come
in contact with personal cruelty. Someone had
deliberately deceived him. “And yet,” he asked
himself, “ to whom had he ever been unkind?”
He reached the door of the studio and, for a
moment, stood with his hand upon the latch,
pausing, as a child about to plunge his teeth into
luscious fruit. One he knew who could not treat
him falsely, and a woman, too ; one there was who
would always be the same to him, for was she not
built of stone, and his own making? He opened
the door and looked, and there, in the yawning
death of everything, the light went our, black
clouds floated about him, his head grew dizzy, he
fell, and kindly unconsciousness took him to her
breast and rocked him to sleep a while.
The girl saw it all, and with it realized for the
first time the full truth of what she had done.
She had deliberately broken the stone, not so
much because the stone had broken her heart, as
in the hope that the torrent of the man’s love
might then come her way, and now the truth
flashed across her that in the destruction of Cleo-
patra she had destroyed Cleopatra’s maker. She
might have known it earlier, for were they two
not of one flesh? Was not all the life she had of
his lending? Was she not, as he himself had said,
the better partof him,and couldhelivewithout her?
On the swift feet of frightened love, the girl was
instantly at his side, and the next moment had
lifted him all limp and lifeless as he was on to the
couch whereon she had spent so many curious
hours. A sharp fragment of marble had cut his
temple, and a dark stream of blood was running
down his pallid cheek and falling upon the floor.
So realistic in the girl’s mind had become the idea
of Cleopatra’s personality, that when she saw the
blood upon the stone about her she involuntarily
swung round to the rugged remnants of the figure
to see if that, too, was bleeding.
Once assured of Clifford’s immediate safety she
hurried into the back-door of an hotel near, and
from the kindly hostess begged some brandy, and
then went back to her nursing.
In an hour or two, although still unconscious,
Clifford was well enough to be moved into a bed-
room that she had hired close by.
All that day the girl sat over him —now moisten-
ing his dry lips that muttered, now shading him
from the inquisitive sun-light, and always raining
on him the continual dew of her love and
yearnings.
With evening some consciousness came, and
came, as consciousness always does from its
holiday, like a timid girl to a new boarding-
school; half curious, half afraid—one moment
asking, with thoughtful face and wrinkled brow,
the meaning of this or that, and the next retreat-
ing into the sanctity of itself.
A hideous dread lay just in front of the girl as
silently she sat and watched the ebb and flow of
Clifford’s thinking. It was the fear that jvith his
full consciousness there would come not a recog-
nition of the new self she felt, but of the old model
she hated to remember; she had loved him before
she had destroyed her rival, but now seeing the
greatness of her crime she was desperately deter-
mined to compensate for it with an overwhelming
love and a devotion that should be all-absorbing.
But how ? Love, love for the animate had no
place in his composition—it was eaten up, she
knew, by his love for the beautiful, nevertheless
his love for beauty was intact and her beauty was
still her own. It came back when fear left her,
she would bait her hook with it, angle with her
curves, and then if only she could get him
interested in her again, she would lead him by
other methods into the now realm of her newer
womanhood. And so it came to pass that when
Clifford awoke from a long sleep he found the
light so placed that its rays fell full upon her and
his hand was held by her own against her bare
neck and shoulder, the part that she knew he loved
best.
With eyes now widely opened he looked at her
long and wonderingly, then asked where he was.
In bed ; you have bee> very ill.”
“ And where —where is Cleopatra ?”
A shudder ran through the girl. “She is in
the studio.”
A smile shone through the fog of his anxious-
ness. “I am so glad; I had a horrible dream
that she ”
The girl ran her fingers through his hair as no
one but his mother had ever done. “You must
not mind your dreams —you must get well.”
Then he turned half round, nearer the fingers that
caressed him, and found, in the untiring hand of
the girl, old associations and strange memories of
the waste wilderness of his boyhood, when a
mother’s love was the only shelter.
Then, with eyes still closed, he left the past,
came up to the present, and tried to understand
it; weighed the girl’s gentle touches in new balances
and found they meant very much to him, then he
opened his eyes and looked into her face and saw
her soul there.
“ You seem to me changed very much—aie
you ? ”
“Yes.”
“ What has changed you ? ”
“ ’Tis a long story, and you cannot hear it now,
you are not well enough.”
“ I am quite well—tell me.”
And so with the cloak of night about them she
knelt down and told him all, and somehow was not
afraid.
He did not speak until she had finished, and
then putting his hand firmly upon her head bent
it back, and looking straight into her face said :
“ Pygmalion lives still, and the gods have been
again kind to him.”
MANNINGTON CAFFYN.
The Widow’s Mourning.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ I have not long to live,”
he said
To the gentle wife quite
newly wed.
But tears did not be-
come her;
So, with a smile, she bent
her head
And kissed his brow and
whispered, “Fred,
I think you’ll last the
summer !”
“ The nights are warm,
no breezes chill
The fragrant buds or
blossoms kill,
And if, old dear, you’re
wary,
With proper care I think
you will
Stay with your little wife
until
The end of February.”
Again she kissed his brow, and, oh !
His breathing then grew faint and low,
A lifeless form was present.
Said she, “ I knew it must be so,
But as, poor boy ! he had to go,
I tried to make things pleasant.”
She left the room with streaming eyes
And saw the sun in splendour rise—
Another day adorning;
Anon she murmured ’mid her sighs—
“l wonder where a widow buys
The nicest kind of mourning !”

CHRISTMAS, 1890.
AT this season of the year, the old adage, “The proof of the pudding is in the eating,”
is more likely to be put to the test than at any other period, and the dry subject
of statistics is scarcely one that can well be chosen as an aid to digestion. We will not,
therefore, dear reader, inflict upon you any very severe tax of that nature. Suffice it to
say, that it is an interesting and surprising fact that over
1,500,000
One Million and. a Half Bottles or
WARNER’S “SAFE” REMEDIES
Have been sold in these Australasian colonies and New Zealand during the past five years,
and what is more astonishing still, is, that their sale goes on increasing; a solid proof that
they are not simply nostrums got-up for the bald purpose of making money, but, on the
contrary, that they are preparations specifically adapted to the cure of the diseases for which
they are designed and honestly placed before the public, to be by them tested as to their merits.
The verdict arrived at after a fair trial is so unmistakably in their favour, that not
a word more is necessary as a recommendation to any who are unfortunately in despair of
finding, from any other source, a cure for long-endured maladies, many of them falsely and
unnecessarily declared to be beyond human aid. But the following case, as a specimen of
many hundreds, is here given :
Messrs. H. H. WARNER and CO.
Port Wakefield, South Australia, ,17 th July, 1889.
hioiu June until the end of August, 1887, I was a severe sufferer from disease of the kidneys
and urinary Organs, so much so that it became necessary to prepare my will, in anticipation of my early decease.
During my illness I obtained advice from several of the medical profession, but instead of benefiting therefrom
grew woi se and weakei, until, finally, I was confined to my bed and despaired of recovery. Among many
distressing symptoms from which I suffered acutely were hemorrhage, palpitation of the heart, throbbing pains
in the head, paralysis of the bladder and growing weakness, ending in fainting. Referring to my diaryl find
that I commenced to take Warner’s Safe Cure on 13th August, with the happy result that on Bth September
—a period of only twenty-one days—l was enabled to attend to my business/ From that time the improve-
ment, although gradual, was continuous and decided, the fluids became natural, and the tone of the system,
which had become very low from loss of blood and exhaustion, steadily rising, until normal strength was regained!
Whilst fully the goodness of Almighty God in my restoration to health and strength, I
gladly bear testimony to Warner’s Safe Cure as being the means or agent of my recovery. You are at full
liberty to use this if you choose.

Nicholson’s Ear Drum, of which following
is a description, is simply one of the most perfect
inventions of art for the restoration of the im-
perfections of nature. The eardrum is about fof
an inch in length, and is constructed after the mould
of the natural drum of the ear from pure gum and
finished in gold and silver. It is intended either
to fill the place of an absent eardrum or to enforce
the action of an imperfect one, and may be easily
introduced into the auditory channel, whence it
can be removed and replaced at pleasure. When
placed in position and pressed back against the
natural drum, a vacuum is produced which causes
a cupping of the natural drum, should that be
collapsed or sunken, while, in cases of perfor-
ation it replaces the imperfect natural drum of
the ear. It is impossible for one who has not
suffered from deafness to write with enthusiasm
of this wonderful invention. That admirable
quality addsits convincing testimony in the numer-
ous testimonials from sufferers of all classes.
Deaf 40 Years.
5 Johnston-street, Wellington, N.Z.
23rd April, 1889.
Dear Sir, —I have received very considerable
benefit from using your Ear Drums. I have
suffered from deafness for over forty (40) years,
the result of measles in my childhood, Latterly
my deafness has been so painful that my business
talking had to be done by writing. I was nearly
stone deaf. The Ear Drums and Lotion relieved
me in about ten days, and after one month’s
wearing I could distinctly hear a sermon preached.
In my opinion, as in my own experience, your Ear
Drums and Lotion are, using very mild language,
Invaluable Remedies. My family are astonished
at their effect on myself.—Faithfully yours,
T. GLUYAS PASCOE.

Traralgon, Victoria, September, 6, 1889.
Dear Sir,—l have great pleasure in being able to
inform you that I find my ears very much im-
proved already. The singing is already much less
than what it was; I can also hear a great deal
better. I use the powder a good deal, and believe
it does as much good as the liquid.—Your obedient
servant, PETER M‘OALL.
Has found the Drums of great benefit,
4 Charlotte-place, East St. Kilda, Melbourne,
20th September, 1889.
Dear Sir,—l have used your Artificial Ear
Drums with the Lotion for nearly two months,
and have found them of very great benefit. I can
now hear the clock tick quite distinctly,,which I
have not been able to do for the last ten years.
My wife and friends are delighted with the result,
as they do not require to shout to me now. I can
follow any ordinary conversation. I shall have
great pleasure in recommending your wonderful
invention to anyone suffering from deafness.—
Yours very gratefully, R. J. WESTWOOD.
He can dispense with the Drums.
Yarraville, Melbourne, 12th Eebruary, 1890.
Dear Sir,—l think it my duty for the benefit of
those afflicted with deafness and noises in the
head to make known that after several years’
suffering from partial deafness, I used your Ear
Drums and preparations with great success, so
much so that I can hear as well as ever I could.
I wish particularly to state that I followed the
directions for the treatment to the letter, and can
now dispense with the Drums. Wishing that all
who use your wonderful little Drums may meet
with the same success as myself—l am, dear sir,
yours faithfully, W. UREN.
Deaf 27 Years.
Glenferrie, Melbourne, 27th June, 1889.
Dear Sir,—l have great pleasure in testifying to
the value of your patent Ear Drums. I have been
deaf for 27 years through colonial fever. I ob-
tained a pair of your Gold Ear Drums some few
months back, and have found greater benefit from
than from anything else I have tried. I can now
hear any ordinary conversation. —Yours truly,
CHAS. F. CHIPPERFIELD.
A Hopeless Case.
86 Ferrars Street, South Melbourne,
Melbourne, July 22nd, 1889.
Respectful Sir,—Considering that I have used
your Patent Artificial Ear Drums and Lotions
since May 15th, I feel it my duty to make known
to you that I cannot find words great enough to
express myself in their favour. Having consulted
and been a patient under, the care of five of the
most skilful aurists in England and Melbourne
within the last five years, but to no good effect, I
can without hesitation state that it has been a
blessing to me that such an invention ever came
into existence. I have been a patient in the
Liverpool (England) Eye and Ear Institution,
Myrtle-street, also in the Melbourne Eye and
Ear Institution, when they pronounced me incur-
able in both institutions. The Liverpool Insti-
tute treated me for catarrh in the throat, and the
Melbourne Institute treated me for excessive wax
in the ear. Further, should any person, aurist or
otherwise, be desirous of having any other infor-
mation, I shall consider it a pleasure to answer
any inquiry personally or by letter. Sincerely
wishing you success in your simply combined
remedy. You are at liberty to make use of this
letter to vour own approval, as facts are stubborn.
—Yours most respectfully, THOS. HOOSON.
A great benefit received,
Falmouth Street,
Hawthorn, Melbourne, 27th April, 1890.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in stating that
your Drums are a great benefit to my son.—
Yours respectfully, T. DROUGHT.
Noises in the head cured.
6 Byron Street, North Melbourne,
22nd August, 1889.
Dear Sir,—l wish to inform you that for the
last ten years I have suffered intense pain and
spent many sleepless nights, caused by noises in
my head. I was under the treatment of several
doctors during my affliction. Since using your
Ear Drums, Lotion and Preparation, I have
completely recovered. —Yours faithfully,
mary McDonnell.
Great Benefit received, 86 years of age.
Neerim Road, Oakleigh, Victoria,
April 20, 1889.
Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in informing
you that I have obtained a great benefit from your
Artificial Ear Drums; aged 86.—Faithfully yours,
G. SIBON.
The Hearing greatly improved.
3 Victoria-street, East Brunswick, Melbourne,
October 16, 1889.
Dear Sir,—l am glad to inform you that since I
began using the Artificial Ear Drums which I re-
ceived from you a few weeks ago, my hearing has
improved greatly.—Yours respectfully,
CHAS. J. POOLE.
Deaf 20 years, much better.
Packington-street, Kew, Melbourne,
January 16, 1890.
Dear Sir,—l am glad to say that since I pur-
chased your Artificial Ear Drums, a few months
ago, I can hear much better. I have been deaf
for twenty (20) years, and my hearing is still im-
proving.—Yours truly, O. H. B. CHRISTIAN.
The Drums continue to give satisfaction.
Mount Duneed P. O. Victoria,
February 5, 1890.
Dear Sir, —I have pleasure in letting you know
that the Drums continue to give satisfaction, and
I should find it very hard to he without them.—
Yours respectfully, MISS E. PAECH.
The hearing is much better.
Laton House, Humtfray Street, Ballarat East,
Victoria,
March 4, 1889.
Dear Sir, —I am glad to let you know, that my
hearing is much better since 1 began using your
Ear Drums. —Yours respectfully, MRS. WAINr

AYER’S HAIR VIGOR Is unrivaled for
tue restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use it, pronounce it, also, the best hair-
grower. When the capillary glands become en-
feebled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Indies find that this preparation Imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

If you were what the beer is,

Till it should wane and dwindle

Tennyson, who was hazy :
Beers, foaming beers, I know not whence they
come,
Rise in the glass land gather to a head,
And gently fizzing slow subside again,
Then cool and pleasant travel down my throat,
And so become the beers that are no more.
Ah, passing strange !—before me I perceive
Two tumblers, yet there was but one before;
And —wonderful! —two pipes. Alas, my sight
Swims round and round. Ah, well, I know the
cause:
It is, it is, the beers that are no more.

Shiels, Victorian Minister of Railways,
lately announced his intention of thoroughly re-
forming his department, and next day a man
wrote him to ask if he could refund the sum of
two-and-sixpence, which the applicant had dropped
through the spittoon of a smoking-carriage some-
where near Brighton. Also an old lady forwarded
a peremptory demand for a lost umbrella, and a
cricket-club requested him to forward a free pass
by return post, and some thirsty travellers insisted
that better liquor should be supplied at the
refreshment-rooms else they would wreck the
Government, and some teetotallers demanded
that the supply of liquors should be stopped else
they would also wreck the Government, and six
other deputations demanded 847 miles of new line,
and nearly burst with rage because they didn’t
get it.
Charles Marvin, the well-known traveller
and writer on Asiatic affairs, whose death “ at
the fatal age of 37” has just been cabled, was
once a nine days| wonder. Employed as a writer
at lOd per hour in the British Foreign Office, he
was deputed, by a well-paid official too lazy to earn
a vulgar salary, to copy out the famous Salisbury-
Schouvaloff agreement made prior to the Berlin
Treaty. Contributing to the London Globe to
eke out an existence, Marvin disclosed to that
journal the contents of the document, which,
when published, sent ahum through Europe. The
poor “ tenpenny ” was arrested and charged with
stealing an official paper, but as it had never
left the pigeon-hole at Downing-street, the case fell
through. ■

THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN.
ST. JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
Ist. It is in one word a cure ; it is not merely a
relief, and in no sense a cure-all; it is the product
of scientific research.
2nd. It strengthens while it soothes and sub-
dues, heals, and cures ; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the whole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.
4th. It does not merely irritate the outer
surface, nor does it merely soften or relax a con-
stricted muscle. To its specific action a superior
curative virtue is superadded.
sth. It penetrates deeply but gently; search-
ingly and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer,
6th. Each constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain.
SOME AUSTRALIAN EVIDENCE.
The editor of that favorably known and pro-
gressive periodical, the Illustrated Sydney
News, writes that he “has much pleasure in
giving the proprietors of St. Jacobs oil his testi-
mony with respect to its wonderful curative
properties. The editor has suffered acutely with
chronic sciatica, and has found the greatest relief
by the application of St. Jacobs oil to the affected
parts, and has no hesitation in recommending it
to sufferers.”
The lady who edits the Band op Mercy
(Sydney), also states that she “can testify to the
value of St. Jacobs oil, as it is used in her family
with great benefit.”
IF YOU WISH
to be worried into an early grave by the
petty inconveniences of this paradoxical sub-
lunary—if you wish to lose your trams, your
trains, your temper —if you wish to arrive at your
business premises in the morning disposed to
quarrel with everyone you come in contact with,
and to arrive home of an evening in a fit mood to
abuse your wife, baste the baby, kick the cat, or,
indeed, for the matter of that, to “kick the
bucket,” in a sudden fit of splenic apoplexy, why,
buy one of those cheap, trashy, made-up-to-gull
Swiss atrocities in the shape of a so-called watch.
But if you wish a
RELIABLE TIMEKEEPER,
A true and trusty friend and faithful companion
—if you wish a timekeeper which myriads of
grateful purchasers have satisfied themselves is
fully up to the standard of excellence claimed for
it, the testimony in favour of which is so over-
whelming, the reputation of which is unrivalled,
the durability of which is assured, the construc-
tion of which is simple and such that it rarely gets
out of order, and, in event of aceident, can be
repaired at a trifling cost —if you wish a low-cost
and reliable TIMEKEEPER, which has proved
itself worthy of the high encomiums passed upon
it in every clime, by pulpit, press and populace,
you will assuredly buy a Waterbury,

CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and vigour to growing children, and
those of delicate constitutions.
“Breakers Ahead!”
That cry has brought terror to many a stout
heart. A shipwreck is a frightful experience, to
hear the wind whistle, the timber creak and crash,
the cordage strain, the sailors swear, and the
women scream, tremble, and run hither and
thither like maniacs, is enough to appal the
bravest heart. Yet, with all its terrors, death by
shipwreck is not half so terrible as the slow and
insidious course of disease, which for the latter
years of the stricken one’s life makes existence a
misery, not only to the victim but to all around
him. With such terrible facts staring us in the
face how careful we should be to preserve that
blessing of Providence —health and strength. Note
should be taken of the first signs of disease.
A simple headache is an infallible sign that
the liver and stomach are disordered ; fre-
quent toothache and neuralgia indicate infalli-
bly that the nervous system is becoming
enervated; that tired feeling is proof positive
that strength is failing. There are hundreds of
such symptoms which should have immediate
treatment. Clements Tonic fortifies the blood and
builds up nerve tissue ; it is the greatest regulator
the system ever introduced, and thousands of
grateful sufferers testify to this fact. For in-
stance, Captain H. Dibden, Master Balmain
Ferry Boat, was for years an acute sufferer from
nervousness, debility and chronic dyspepsia. He
had recourse to Clements Tonic, which effectually
cured him. He says :—Balmain. —Dear Sir, —I
have much pleasure in giving my evidence in sup-
port of the value of Clemeuts Tonic. For a long
time I suffered from indigestion and debility, and
tried many remedies with but little benefit.
Seeing Clements Tonic advertised, I tried it, and
after the first bottle I felt quite a change, and am
now anew man altogether, and shall be glad to
afford anyone further information if desired. And
Mrs. Woodlands, Port Macquarie, suffered from
Sluggish Liver, Hsepatitis and Dyspepsia.
She took three bottles Clements Tonic and
the pain was completely gone and perfect
health restored. She writes : —Port Macquarie,
N.S.W.—Dear Sir, —For many years I have been
suffering from very severe pain in the side and
indigestion. I tried all sorts of remedies and
consulted many medical men, but got no relief. I
tried Clements Tonic, and before I had taken three
bottles the pain in my side was completely gone,
and I never felt so well in my life before. And
Mr. S. D. Wood, Yerger of All Saints Cathedral,
Bathurst, and a most reputable and respected
citizen of “the city of the plains,” frankly en-
dorses this wonderful remedy. He says:—■
Howick-street, Bathurst, January 30th, 1890.
Dear Sir, —I have lately been taking Clements
Tonic with such wonderful results that I am in-
duced, as a matter of justice, to send a plain
statement of my case, which you are at liberty to
publish in the interest of similar sufferers.
For some years I have suffered acutely
from indigestion, giddiness, languid tired
feelings, no inclination for exertion, hum-
ming noises in the ears—this symptom being
especially troublesome —and extreme lowness of
spirits. I tried many “cures” which did me no
good. I eventually used Clements Tonic, and the
second dose completely cured the noises in my
ears, and during recent attacks they were worse
than ever before, but, thanks to Clements Tonic,
before the first bottle was used my general health
was greatly improved, and I can truthfully state
that it is far superior to any other medicine I ever
took, and I honestly believe that all sufferers will
derive great and permanent benefit from its use.
All unpleasant feelings have entirely left me, and
I shall always use Clements Tonic when out of
sorts. It is a grand pick-me-up, and I am thank-
ful that I gave it a trial. There can be no doubt
even in the most sceptical mind, after such proof
as this.

—Dear Sirs, —It is with pleasure ! take the oppor-
tunity of writing to you, to let you know the
wonderful benefit I derived from your Eucalypte
Extract. Some time ago, if you remember, I
wrote to you from Camden relative to a complaint
of the lungs, which at that time I was suffering
from, and were it not for your Extract I am cer-
tain I would now be in my grave. I felt so bad
that my voice was gone, and the cough I was
subject to would have killed me were it not for
your Eucalypte Extract, which has now, thank
God, restored me to health. —I remain, yours sin-
cerely, Patrick Carroll. 242 Hereford-street,
Forest Lodge, Sydney.
The unique and phenomenal enterprise of
Messrs. Raphael Tuck and Sons, of London, was
never manifested to such an extent as in their pre-
parations for the Christmas season. It may seem
a commonplace and somewhat coarse idea to try
to indicate the wealth of their artistic novelties
by the ponderosity of the samples of them, but it
may convey some idea of the marvellous profusion
of the new patterns if we say that the specimen-
books alone would nearly fill an ordinary hansom
cab. Those devoted to. the one department of
illustrated books and booklets are quite sufficient
to tax the strength of an ordinary porter to carry
them, while those filled with Christmas and New
Year’s Cards form six huge volumes, embracing
over 1000 sets, and comprising nearly 4000 indivi-
dual designs. This prodigious abundance makes
it extremely difficult to present within the compass
of a notice any adequate idea of the varied and
novel features of even any class into which these
productions might be divided, but of this really
wonderful collection it may be said that for beauty
and excellence, as well as for extent and variety,
it is absolutely unique. Messrs. Tuck have catered
for all tastes, and for all purses, and if their antici-
pations are realised, as we may expect, sales
during the coming season of Christmas and New
Year Cards, will be on an altogether unprecedented
scale.
The display of “Fine Art Furniture” at
Messrs. Wallach’s, Wynyard-square, has always
been admitted one of the finest in Australasia,
but this season they have evidently determined
to eclipse all former efforts. The magnificent
show of dining, drawing and bedroom suites in
every design, both modern and antique, hand-
somely and solidly upholstered, fairly takes one’s
breath. The antique oak sideboards, mounted in
brass, are particularly attractive, and, together
with hall furniture, are a feature worthy of notice,
being both elegant and serviceable. The carpet-
department is represented by all the best-known
manufacturers in England and the Continent,
and is equally remarkable for variety of pattern
and make as for the enormous stock there is to
select from. Oilcloths and linoleums of every
description. A shipment of pianos by all the
well-known makers has just been opened and
added to the already large assortment of pianos,
organs and other musical instruments. Messrs.
Wallaoh, are also showing a most unique assort-
ment of “Xmas Novelties;” among the more
notable are the antique oak clocks, brass-
mounted ; reading and piano lamps in brass and
nickel, copper and bronze ornaments, armour
clocks, bronze statuettes, photo, albums, &c.;
immense variety of Japanese goods, screens,
ornaments. &c. ; flower-stands, rush and willow
tables and chairs in endless profusion. Ladies
about to furnish or refurnish their “boudoirs”
should not fail to pay a visit to this Establishment.
To Messrs. Oolemaneand Sons, Cootamundra. —
Dear Sirs, —I have used the Eucalypte Extract
which I got from you, and am now quite out of it.
Almost every possible complaint I use it for,
including burns, scalds, cuts, bruises, sore throats,
colds, chilblains, neuralgia, toothache, &c., &c.,
and I do not believe there is any disease it will not
cure if persevered with. In ulcerated sore throat
or inflamed throat it is invaluable, having had
personal experience of the fact very recently.
Where children or even adults are badly affected
I usually erect a kind of small tent near a fire-
place, place a kettle on the fire, and when the
water reaches boiling point I pour a quantity of
the Eucalypte Extract into the kettle, and attach
a long tube to the spout of the kettle, and make
the steam play about the patient in the tent. The
steam, owing to the distance it has to travel when
it reaches the patient is thus in a cool form and is
not enervating like hot steam. The whole atmos-
phere in the tent in this manner becomes im-
pregnated with the volatile properties of the Ex-
tract, and the patient is not only relieved but
stimulated. I have by this means “saved tne
lives of one of my children when the medical
attendants said that the only chance of saving the
child’s life would be by performing the operation
of tracheotomy.” In diphtheria I would adopt
similar treatment with the addition of swabbing:
the tonsils and glands frequently with the Extract
on a camel’s hair brush or feather. Nearly every
one here now uses it.—Faithfully yours, J. C.
Ryall, J.P., Editor Cowra Free Press. Cowra,
Aug. 16, ’BB.
The hero of this awkward incident was a
Sydney man by the name of Smyth. Not a
Baron, nor a missionary—just a plain pot-fronted
white shirt and nail-kag Smyth of a pattern as
common in the luncheon-hour as locusts are in
Riverina. And as he sat and scooped up a plat©
of soup with kidney-pie to follow, a stout and
withal shapely maiden, but with a wild, eager look
in both her eyes and a small baby in her arms,
burst in upon the proprietor with an impatient
demand for the whereabouts of “Mr. Smith.”
His glance fell upon the luckless man who was

“There’s Mr. Smith, at the end of that table.”
Stepping up with an air of confidence the damsel
deposited the baby on the table beside the empty
soup-plate, merely remarking: “That’s your
baby, Mr. Smith—good-day,” and vanished. With
a wild gurgle he recognised the horror of the
situation, and grabbing the bundle with one hand
rushed out after her. “No you don’t, old man;
it’s your baby right enough, you know, and you
can’t play it back on to me that way.” “Good
God, woman, I tell you it’s not mine. Why,si
spell my name with aY ! ” And it was not until
a constable came up and explained that she must
sue the gentleman in the orthodox fashion that she
reluctantly took the baby back. And then Smyth
“ with a Y ” explained it all to the bobby and to
about 1500 derisive people who were standing by,
and didn’t believe a word of it.

SWORN CERTIFICATE.—One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugblmann, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing mo the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About, February last i began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, 1 became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank pod and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

Which is now universally acknowledged to be the only Humane, Efficient and Natural Method of Eradicating Chronic Diseases of every kind, now known to Mankind.

As there is no other man practising in Australia who is so experienced and so well qualified to |
treat chronic and long-standing diseases as Mr. Kugeemanx, everyone may know they have here the
most undoubted skill and advice obtainable. j
Mr. Kugelmann’s Treatment differs from all others known, and is Perfectly Unique and Original
to himself. If you are suffering from any form of Disease do not fail to obtain a personal consultation j
(free), as he never fails to understand the producing causes of all Chronic Diseases, and will tell you at j
once what it is, and the cost for a complete cure. You can then have treatment or not, as you may
prefer. No Mineral Drugs or Poisons are ever used by him. Avoid Allopathic Drugs and Operations |
as you would avoid a pestilence. Nature’s remedial agents are purely Herbal, Magnetic, and Elec- j
trioal, and never leave any injurious after effects like Drugs and the Allopathic Knife do. I
Mr. Kugelmann has successfully Cured the following Diseases amongst others *
Cancer, Blindness, Cataract of the Eye, Scrofula, Scurvy, Lupus, Eczema. Itch, all and
every Skin Disease, all Blood Diseases, Pruritus, Consumption, Asthma, Bronchitis, Induration

Cobden-street, Kew, August 19, 1890.
To Mr. H. E. KuGELMANN. —Dear Sir, —I feel that, in justice to you, and to let others know the
great benefit I have derived from your treatment, I should speak, and it is with great pleasure I do so.
I hereby make oath and say that about thirteen (13) years ago I began to feel very unwell, and had
continual and great pain from an internal disease, which my medical attendant completely failed to
benefit or to correctly diagnose. I continued his treatment for more than a year, with great persever-
ance, but instead of improving any I gradually became worse, my doctor first prescribing one drug,
then another in endless succession without relief. I then consulted another eminent medical man,
Supposed to be the most skilled in Melbourne. I continued his treatment for another year, during
which time I took an immense amount of Drugs, Poisons, and Minerals, none of which did me the
least good whatever. I continued to become worse and to lose flesh daily, and the pain I suffered day
and night was most intense. This Doctor then declared my case to be perfectly hopeless, and that it
was only a matter of time and the disease would kill me. In despair I then tried another Doctor of
reputed skill, and he declared that no case of the disease from which I suffered had ever been known
to recover, but that he could ease me, and prescribed chlorodyne, which pOison only stupified me, but
did not ease my complaint in the least. I therefore abandoned this treatment and tried others, all of
which proved to be only blind experiments, as none did me even temporary good. In this state I was
therefore forced to pass nine years of wretched existence ; many times I would have been glad (had it
been God s will) to have died, and so ended my misery, as I never hoped to be well again. Eventually,
however (and I thank God for it), I saw your address in the paper, and I made up my mind to consult
you immediately, which I did, and you at oncp told me the correct nature of my disease, and without
hesitation I accepted your treatment and continued it for a good many months, during which time I
rapidly recovered, and have been completely cured now for over a year, which generally is a good
indication of success. Before I close I would further say I thank God I was ever induced to come to
you, and I pray you may be long spared to do good to suffering humanity, and I hope that through
reading my ease that sufferers with chronic diseases, supposed to be incurable, will consult you, and
discard the old-fashioned Doctors and their destructive drugs and operations. Trusting that this will
do good, I remain, dear sir, yours very sincerely, Mbs. ELIZABETH LEE.
. I; Elizabeth Lee, of Kew, Victoria, do solemnly and sincerely declare the above written statement
signed by me is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true in every particular, and I make this
declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of an Act of Parliament
of Victoria rendering persons making a false declaration punishable for wilful and corrupt perjury.

(Copy of Sworn Certificate.)
Bannerman-street, Sandhurst, October 30, 1888.
Mr. Kugelmann, 172-174 William Street, Melbourne.
Dear Sir, —I consider it a duty to suffering humanity to add
my testimony to your undoubted skill and ability in successfully
treating chronic disease. Seven years ago I began to have diffi-
culty in breathing, and my lungs began to be affected, with great
tightness on the chest, and rapidly getting worse I consulted a
; medical man here and continued his treatment for some time,
? but not getting any improvement and getting also much weaker,
I consulted another doctor here, and continued his treatment for
some years. I always had a great deal of hard matter in my
chest that I could not get away by any medicines that I used :
I had night sweats very badly for years and my appetite almost
entirely left me. In spite op ale treatment and drugs which
I took under medical advice, I rapidly lost flesh until I was
reduced to skin and bone. During this treatment I got the
Rheumatic Fever and Dropsy, my legs and body swelled con-
siderably and also MY heart became affected, and remained in
a weak condition, until I consulted you. The greatest wonder
to me is that I survived the fever in the low condition that I was
in, for I could not eat or drink without great effort. I vomited
most of my food during the whole seven years ; and, although
my chest was frightfully choked up with matter, all the treat-
ment I had failed to bring any sputa away. Consequently my
breathing during the whole of this time remained most difficult
in the extreme, so that my life was a complete misery to myself.
One doctor whom I consulted pronounced me to be in a very bad
state of consumption ; and i was told by one doctor, it was
ONE THING ; AND BY ANOTHER IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE. I tried
the Chinese doctor, as I was determined not to leave anything
undone to relieve me, if not to cure me, of my misery. This
Chinese doctor told me there was a large hole in my right lung,
and treated me for it for six weeks ; but all to no good whatever,
as it all ended in a miserable failure. After this I heard of you,
and decided to consult you, which I did; and on examining me,
you stated you could cure me ; and as you described exactly
MY CONDITION, AND THAT, TOO, WITHOUT MY TELLING YOU ANY
symptoms, I began your treatment at once, and, I am happy to
state, I began to improve rapidly. My heart soon getting into a
better condition, and is now quite right; also my lungs im-
proved fast, and the matter all came away; my appetite
improved gradually, and also my strength, so that I can now
breathe quite freely, and my lungs are quite strong again; and
I can do a hard day’s work again, to the great surprise of many
of my friends, who thought I should have been dead long since,
which, I have no doubt, I would have been before now if I had
not had your treatment at the juncture that I did. Now any
person wishing any further information may have it by calling
on me. To all other sufferers i would say :do not waste
YOUR MONEY BY TAKING THE OLD-FASHIONED DOCTORS’ TREAT-
MENT. Mr. Kugelmann’s medicines are purely herbal, and his
treatment perfectly natural, and that is the treatment that I am
happy and grateful to say has saved me from a life of misery and
untimely death. That this may be circulated far and wide
wherever there may be suffering, is the ardent hope of yours,
•ver gratefully, JOHN RUDE.

P.S.—I forgot to mention that I was treated by you under
an agreement, which you strictly carried out, and I am quite
satisfied that the treatment I received was worth the money I
paid you.

27 Commercial Road, South Yarra, November 20th, 1888.
_ Mr. H. R. Kugelmann, —Dear Sir, —I was suffering for eight years from extreme nervous debility
and weakness, so much so that I could not sleep ; at last I became so bad and weak that I could
scarcely walk. My food (what little I took) seemed to do me no good, and I had to leave my situation
through it. I had medical treatment, but got no better. I had just given up in despair, when one of
your circulars came to hand, and, as a last resource I placed myself under your treatment for twelve
months. I began to slowly improve. Three years have now elapsed, and Tam happy to say that I
am, and have been well during that time; my nervousness gradually left me, and I have not had any
return of it. What I felt I wanted was rest, which I seldom got. I think it my duty to thank you,
not only for the medicines I had from you, but also for the extreme kindness and attention X received
at your hands; altogether, I shall ever remember you with gratitude. Several of ray friends have
been to you and have received lasting benefit at your hands. Anyone calling upon me, I shall be
happy to speak to.—l am, dear Sir, yours truly, W. J. EBDALE.

NOTE.—There are a great many medical men now advertising themselves as specialists in nervous diseases, and that they can cure all cases of such a nature
as loss of vigour and power, decay of the nerves, loss of vitality and all kindred ailments. But by the vast number of people who come to me for proper treatment after
they have tried in vain these advertising legally-qualified doctors, and by the way in which they have been robbed by them proves most conclusively that the whole of
them are a most consummate lot of rascals, who merely fleece their victims of whatever cash they are able to extract from them. They dose them with Quinine and
b-on, Strychnine, Phosphorus, Bromide of Potash, Ammonia, and other vile drugs. These may cause a temporary feeling of relief, only to result in greater misery than
hetore. No one whose nervous system is afflicted in any way should have anything to do with these medical sharks, but should at once consult me, and I will tell them
at once what to do.

Colonel Maplksok writes as follows:—‘‘Madame Roze
recognises in your preparation the precious Saline that
she found so invaluable when she visited New Orleans
during the last yellow fever epidemic, in order, by her
concerts, to raise funds for the benefit of the stricken
ones, who could not afford the necessary comforts, and
which the crowded hospitals were unable to supply to
thousands of applicants. Madame Roze was advised by
Dr. Barnes, of London, to take your Saline with her, and
we took several dozen bottles. I really believe it saved
our LIVES.’

tendency to Feverishness ; Invigorating the Digestion.
Acting on the Liver, Bowels and Kidneys imperceptibly
but surely ; tranquillising the Nervous System, inducing
wholesome appetite and recuperating the brain power.
Its utility as a remedy in fevers, and as a cooling drink
in diseases of children, such as scarlet fever, measles, &c.,
has been testified to by the leading members of the
profession. May be had of all Chemists in glass-stoppered

To Messrs. Colemane and Sons. —Gentlemen, —
Having received much benefit from the use of
your Victory Ointment and Volatile Eucalypte I
can, with confidence, recommend to all who suffer
from skin disease the use of same. During the past
nine years I suffered from a most annoying skin
disease on my face, caused by the bite of a fly,
and though the most eminent doctors in this
colony treated me for the complaint, it gained
ground, and threatened to unfit me for business.
Acting on the advice of a friend, I determined
to try your Victory Ointment and Volatile
Eucalypte; the result has been most successful.
In cases of bronchitis and colds I have used your
Volatile Eucalypte with success, and in a case
which I met in the bush, far away from medical
aid, it saved a life. —I am, Gentlemen, &c. —
D. M. Campbell. Cootamundra, July 1, 1886.
To Colemane and Sons. —I have been directed by
the Committee of the Temora Hospital to inform
you that the parcel of Eucalypte Extract which
you sent me recently has been used with
very satisfactory results. —Yours faithfully, W.
Wiscon, Hon. Sec. Temora Hospital.

The Most Useful Ointment in the World,
Bar None.
PREMIER OINTMENT is the SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. But, as many new arrivals
have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may b » as well to let them know that there is such
an article as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
theproductionof thecolony, composed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable, and
Guaranteed Ebee eeom all Poisonous
Qualities. No Artificial Colouring, as the
Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.
WHO SHOULD SUFFER FROM PILES,
when one application will relieve you ?
Read this letter and Try for Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Joseph son’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen: —
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows ;
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public tc
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
■ Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS.
We recoramed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known. ,
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
Bee what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned : — 4
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflcted as I have
been may take advantage of them.

“ There is in Sydney an Institute where, for less
than three farthings a day, you have the use of
forty thousand books, five hundred newspapers,
a nd one hundred and fifty other periodicals.”
“But can I take a book home with me to read?”
asked the Inquisitive One.
‘ ‘ Yes, certainly, and not only a book, but if
you are a yearly member, you can take magazines
as well and change them three times a week.”
“What sort of books are lent out?” said the
Inquisitive One again.

England, and all those are for loan. Run over
the titles for yourself.”

The Inquisitive One seemed satisfied, but still a
little sceptical.
“ What sort of people join this Institute?” he
asked.
“ All who are fond of reading. They find that
nowhere in the Australian Colonies is there such
an Institute —and, as a pure matter of business,
nowhere can they get so much for their money.”
“ Why, how do you make that out ? ”
“By a glance at our balance-sheet. Here you
are. Over eleven hundred pounds spent in pur-
chasing books and journals, and all a member pays
is one pound a year or under three farthings' a
day. That is, he gets eleven hundred pounds for
one pound. It is simply ridiculous to think such
advantages should be offered for the money, and
that anyone should hesitate.”
“ Do you get any good Magazines ? ”
“ Here is a list of the principal journals from
England and America. Read for yourself. Then
there are others for the Colonies and elsewhere.”

A SURE ROAD TO FORTUNE
THE majority of wealthy men in Australia are those who invested in land when it was cheap and
reaped the benefits of increased value. Land close to Sydney can no longer be bought for 2s. 6d.
per foot, but one chance is left, viz., in the coming Colony of WESTERN AUSTRALIA. Land is
steadily increasing in value over there, and in a few years’ time the old story of Svdney and Melbourne
will be retold about Perth and Albany. We are selling Grand Building Sites at Perth from £l5 to £BO
each, and Acre and Half-Acre Blocks at Albany from £l2 to £3O each, on such easy terms that from
about is. bd. to os. per week will meet the payments, and past experience proves that a few shillings
a week saved and invested in this way may make you independent for life. A Eree Deed is given to
every Purchaser, and the land is guaranteed good, high, level building land, we having personally
inspected the Estates. If you wish to make your children a Xmas Box that will prove a real source of
income in after years pay the Deposit on a Block of Land in Western Australia, which, by the time
they are of age, will be worth fifty times the amount you pay for it now. (Send Is. in stamps for Book
containing general information, also, maps and views of Perth and Albany.) Now do not delay, but
send at once for Plans and full particulars of this Really Genuine Investment to

Among the numerous new buildings which
have recently been erected in Melbourne, the
warehouses of Messrs. Oraig, Williamson and
'I homas are the finest. The building is a stately
structure of eight stories, built in the classical
style of architecture, on the sites formerly occupied
by the offices of the Tasmanian Steam Navigation
Company, and of Messrs. Suddeley and Cos., on
the east side of Elizabeth-street, about a couple of
chains from Flinders-street. The lower portion of
the building is of polished Harcourt granite,
which gives a highly finished effect, and the upper
stories are constructed of brick-work coated with
cement. The plans show a frontage of 82ft. Gin.
to Elizabeth-street by a depth of 121 ft., and the
building rises to a height of 120 ft. above
the footway. Access to the various floors
is gained by a wide central staircase, and
for the convenience of visitors two fast-
running Waygood elevators, convey them to the
spacious and well-lighted show-rooms. A service
of hoses for the extinction of fire is provided on
each flat, and every labour-saving appliance to
facilitate communication in the shape of electric
bells and speaking-tubes, is brought into requisi-
tion. Messrs. Craig, Williamson and Thomas
were originally an exclusively wholesale ffirm of
drapers and warehousemen,’ but in 1879 they
determined to embark on an entirely novel course,
and throw open their warehouse to the public,
supplying them with drapely, woollens, and cloth-
ing at wholesale prices, which they were enabled
to do by making their terms with retail customers
strictly cash. In this way they act as distributors
for the manufacturers, and so save to the retail
consumer the 30 per cent, profit which is taken by
the middleman. As evidence of the fact that they
have kept faith with the public, the firm were
compelled to enlarge their original premises in
1881; two years later, to purchase the warehouse
at No. 6 Elizabeth-street, and in the following
year to erect two additional stories, adding
furniture and carpets to the other depart
ments. The firm, however, still finding the
additional accommodation inadequate, owing to
increase of trade, and recognising the inconvenience
arising from defective lighting, as well as the
trouble buyers are put to in having to move frgm
one warehouse to the other before completing their
purchases, procured the adjoining allotments, on
which their new warehouses are erected. Asa
short resume of the history of such an enterpris-
ing firm cannot but be of interest to our readers,
it may be stated that although they bear the name
of a triumvirate who have been long and well
known in commercial circles of this city, the
business is now carried out by Mr. Craig and his
eldest son, who has recently been admitted as his-
partner, Mr, Williamson having retired in 1887,
and Mr. Thomas in 1881. Mr. Stephen Lewis is
the firm’s representative in London, and, with an
able staff of buyers, is engaged in purchasing
goods from home and continental manufacturers.
Anything and everything, from the most trifling
article in drapery to a complete suite of furniture
for a mansion, can be obtained at actual whole-
sale prices for net cash.
To Colemane and Sons. Gentlemen, Our
child, some twenty months old, was suffering
from a severe attack of influenza. For three
nights she was feverish and restless, with copious
running at the nose and eyes, attended with hard
coughing. We were induced to try your Eucalypte
Honey, and I am glad to say the effect was won-
derful, for after the first day of using the Honey
the child has fully recovered her health and spirits.
You can make what use you please of this willing
testimony to the value of the Eucalypte Honey,
and we shall always recommend it to our friends.

It is said that St. Louis (U.S.) is infested
by a crank who kisses every pretty woman he
meets and bestows on her a card inscribed : —
“ With the compliments of Jack the kisser.
“ Any lady who has been kissed three times by Jack
and retains this card is entitled to membership in the
Grand Army of the Redeemed.
“ Jack’s kiss purifies, but never defiles. His mission is
divine, and his kiss devoid of sensuality.”
“ His Honor, in summing up, pointed out
that the jury must not be influenced by the mere
fact that Mr. O’Connor was the Postmaster-
General. He did not suppose if Mr. O’Connor
was asked that he would make any claim on
account of his position. Mr. O’Connor, who was
sitting at the solicitors’ side of the bar table,
turned round to the Bench and, half rising from
his seat, bowed and remarked, ‘Certainly not,
your Honor.’ (Laughter.)” And yet they say
that all Irishmen are humorists.
Rev. T. J. Curtis, now on a visit to Sydney
from San Francisco, is the clergyman who (aided
by Rev. Dr. Gilchrist) took so active and manly a
part in endeavouring to obtain the reprieve of
those victims of Lynch law, the Mount Rennie
prisoners.
Baron Huddleston is dead. He was a
clever advocate, but a narrow-minded judge. At
the bar he took part in many celebrated cases;
among them, the prosecution of Dr. Palmer, the
Rugely poisoner, the defence of Mrs. Firebrace,
and the defence of Walter Pook for the Eltham
murder.
Advertising as a medium of conveying to
the public the improvements in every branch of
science cannot be too highly extolled. Important
discoveries would remain dormant if it were not
for the all-powerful press. In the present instance
we consider it our duty to acquaint our readers
with the superior properties of Ewing’s Indelible
Marking Ink. It produces a beautiful and irre-
movable jet-black, and is now being used by ail
the leading hospitals, asylums, &c., throughout
the colonies. We have tried it and are convinced
of its efficacy. We are not anxious to single out
any one individual for popularity, but may be
excused in this instance in consequence of the
superior merits of the preparation.
To Messrs. Colemane and Sons, Cootamundra,
N.S. Wales.—Dear Sirs, —I deem it my duty to
give you a testimonial. For some years past I
have suffered much from a very bad leg, which
gave me continual pain, and at times I was com-
pletely laid up. I tried every human remedy,
and several doctors failed to do me any good. I
may add that my leg was a continual running
from the ankle almost to the knee. Seeing your
advertisement in The Bulletin, I determined to
give your remedies a trial, and with the result
that one small pot of the ointment and a bottle of
your Eucalypte Extract has brought a complete
cure. I can now go about my daily occupation.—
Respectfully yours, Philip Spicer Francis, South
Australia.
Colonial Treasurer M‘Millan has just ap-
pointed an Assistant-Superintendent of N.S.W.
Government Stores at £4OO a year. He says he
found from the Superintendent that there was no
one in the department capable of performing the
duties, and after investigation he “ selected a gen-
tleman from two or three applicants (outside the
service) for the position.” How deliciously
ingenuous ! As if there were no one in the whole
of the N.S.W. Civil Service.capable and desirous
of undertaking that position. How, asked Mr.
Traill, did it ever come to pass that Treasurer
M'Millan had but two or three applicants for a
billet of £4OO a year ? Did he advertise the posi-
tion ? No fear. Another apparently discreditable
N.S.W. Civil Service affair of the week is the case
in which an ex-mining man, with whom Post-
master-General O’Connor had been more or less
directly connected in business, suddenly turns up
as a Post-office clerk—appointed at the expense of
juniors in the service.

HEAD what the South Australian Religious Press say
concerning Dr. RAYMOND’S Skill and Treatment
“ During his residence in this colony we have had full
opportunity of making Mr. Raymond’s acquaintance, and
of observing the cures he has performed, and we ha\ e no
hesitation in saying that in our opinion he is a genuine
man and a skilled physician. We have come personally
into contact with a number of persons that have been
cured by him of eye and ear diseases of a complicated and
difficult character, so that we speak from actual know-
ledge and observation. Professor Raymond is a bolamo
physician ; he uses no mineral drugs, and his treatment is
painless and uninjurious.”— The Christian Colonist,
Adelaide, 1889.
The FOLLOWING CUKE that has just been EFFECTED
in SYDNEY not only supports what has been done else-
where, but illustrates the superiority of Dr. RAYMOND’S
method.of combating difficult and complicated affections
of the Human ear„ „ , , „ . .
“To Dr. RAYMOND, Aunst, Oculist, and Botanic
Physician. . , , . ,
“ Dear Sir, —In response to your request, 1 desire to
nubliclv testify to the benefit 1 have received from your
treatment. You have considerably improved my hearing
md general health, although I had previously been under
the treatment of one doctor in Sydney, and been in con-
sultation with several others. I had also vised Nicholson’s
ear drums, lotion and nose powder, and without receiving
the slightest benefit therefrom. You have treated my
case, nose and throat deafness, botanically ; and, in my
opinion, your system is the right one—-you, at the same
time attacking'the root of the disease with internal treat-
ment. I shall be happy to answer any enquiries as to the
benefit I have received whilst under your treatment. —
Yours, very truly. 11. TAYLOR, Palisade Hotel, Millers

Extract from Sydney Morning Herald of August 15.
ISSB, referring to the exhibits of the United States Court,
Centennial Internationa] Exhibition, Melbourne, says:—
A little more to the westward the visitor finds a plat*
unn on which are placed a number of Hammoquette
Reclining Chairs, one of the latest things from' that in-
genious class of Americans who devote their lives td the
invention of objects which shall minister to the fastidious
tastes of the invalid, or meet the luxurious demands of
the wealthy. The Hammoquette Chair, constructed mainly
of American ash, coloured to resemble mahogany, is shown
by R B. Jones, 6 Bridge-street, Sydney, and can, and
will, be made to assume a great variety of shapes. It is
difficult to conceive a more valuable addition to a sick
room, library, study or verandah, than the Hammoquette
Chair must prove.”
Parliament House, Melbourne,
Mr. R. B. Jones, 12th June, 1888.
Dear Sir,—ln reply ta your letter of Bth instant, I
hnvc much pleasure in stating that the nine chairs I pur-
chased from you have given me every satisfaction.
Yours truly,
M. H, DAVIES, M.L.A.,
Speaker Legislative Assembly.
