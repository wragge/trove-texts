“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Comnlete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System. ■
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap

cheap European pauper to be absolutely

A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to

the other to be chosen by the whole
Country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
f'ttd follow its Hubs. The result of its powerful
influence tind its unprecedented literary and oom-
mefcial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever se< n.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clabns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushmai. of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly baaed.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period
of many years, obtained the highest positii n in
his profession. The various diseases embrace din
his speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

ing ; specks floating before the eyes; halos or circles

HOW BABIES | SUFFER
From Torturing'Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize. I
To know that a single application of the'Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cashes, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. |No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour -
ished with pure blood.\
CUTICURA,
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
\‘
k
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to sr ofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success,
Treatment. Cuticura, the great skin cure, and Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
ing, and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated surfaces, clear the skin and
scalp of crusts and scales, and restore the hair, while Cuticura Resolvent, the new
blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor remedies, cleanses the blood of all
impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.

indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.

adult, smaller quantity for childi>_u.

and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.

One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.

BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinan
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrati
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine from
itiiI OSS ?f. tone P ar ts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Ohroiiii
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
Slant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
iseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.

A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steaue’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by - greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
f eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANEP WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.

A Question of Taste.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“I WA3 on an island in the Solomon Group,”h®
said, “ and the only white man there on one occa-
sion. I was collecting copra for a well-known
trading-firm and had a pleasant enough time
until I fell sick of New Guinea fever. For-
tunately, I pulled through pretty quickly. As
soon as I was able to eat anything, the old woman
who had been appointed by the natives to attend
me, because she knew some English, began to
fetch me little delicacies to tempt my appetite.
One day she brought me some cooked meat in a
piece of split bamboo, which they use as a dish—
you know that, Mr. M‘Guinis.”
He turned towards a big, red-bearded jour-
nalist who had been sent to the Islands some
years before for press purposes by a Melbourne
paper.
“Ido, Dickson,” replied the red-bearded man,
with a great sigh.
“Thatmeat, gentlemen,”said Dickson, solemnly
stroking his black beard, “ was like nothing else I
ever tasted in my life.”
“I believe yon there,” observed M'Guinis,
regarding little Tapley, of the evening press, who
was uncommonly plump, with a wistful glance.
“ Well,” continued the narrator, “I got right
again rapidly. The old woman, at my special
request, brought mo the same kind of meat every
day until a day came when she brought me fish
instead. I asked her why she hadn’t brought mo
the meat. She shook her head slowly and replied,
‘No more lit’ boy. Lit’ boy all done.’”
“ Will you tako another drink, boys ?”
We shook hands—all of us except M'Guinis,
who probably wanted to talk over old times and
tastes with Dickson. We had no heart for drink-
ing after this story.
When wo got outside the hotel little Tapley, of
the evening press, said, “ You boys may say what
you like, but I’d just as soon go picnicking with
Marcus Clarke’s Gabbett as with these two fellows
we’ve left inside.”
CREEVE ROE.
A Tewkesbury (Eng.) monumental mason
advertises that he has “ splendid designs of
marble monuments just ready for the coming
season.” “The coming season” is good. In
England it would probably be the cholera or
small-pox season; in sunny Now South Wales,
the bank-audit season.
Dear Bulletin, —l am seriously thinking
of standing for an agricultural constituency at
next election. My political creed, which has been
carefully fixed up to suit the principal yearnings
of the bucolic soul, is as follows
All agricultural produce shall be carried on the railways
absolutely free.
Every farmer shall have a frontage to the main road
and another to a permanent creek.
There shall be a full moon every night.
There shall be a strong arid convenient gate every 400
yards along every road, so that the selector's daughter
and her “boy" oan lean on it conveniently while con-
versing under the aforesaid full moon.
It shall rain hard every morning between one and three.
The adjacent town shall, in every case, be the principal
one in the province, and shall never be more than two
miles distant.
Every selector shall be supplied with six or more large
dogs out of the consolidated revenue.
There shall be a large bridge over every river, creek,
rivulet, billabong, water-hole and mud-hole in the elec-
torate. ■
There shall not, under any circumstances, be more than
two roosters in any one setting of eggs, and I am strongly
opposed to bush-fires and gum trees with big tap roots.
The above are the principal features in my pro-
gramme, but others will be added as I go along.—
Yours, Titus Salt.

writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It’s an errant thought of an idle mind
That the Arch-Fiend’s fate might be
To carry death to the human kind—
Be “ Death ” to humanity.
That perhaps it may be the Arch-Fiend’s wage—
Since the wage of sin is death—
To wander for ever, age by age,
Killing with every breath.
That wherever he goes—by land or sea—
He should hear th’ expiring cry.
And list to the ceaseless liturgy
Of a people doomed to die!
That his legions ever, by night and day,
Pursuing their courses fleet,
Should swoop in their headlong flight to lay
Their spoils at his bloodstained feet!
S.A.
PALLAS.
Old American story with valuable moral:—
Theophilus Harrington, a Vtrmont judge, was a man
who loved the right and cared little for mere legal quib-
bling. “If justice controls your verdict,” he would
often say to the jury “you will not miss the law’s general
principles.” At one trial, where the possession of a farm
was in question, defendant produced a deed, to which
plaintiff’s lawyer, Daniel Chipman, objected, because it
had no seal. “But your client sold the land; was paid
for it, and signed the deed, did he not ? ” asked the judge.
“ That makes no difference,” said Chipman. “The dosd
has no seal, and cannot be put in evidence.” “Is any-
thing else the matter with the deed 7 ” asked the judge.
“ I don’t know that there is.” “Mr. Clerk," said the
judge, “give me a wafer and a three-cornered piece of
paper.” The clerk obeyed, and the judge deliberately
made and affixed the seal. “There, Brother Chipman,”
said he “ the deed is all right now. A man is not going
to be cheated out of his farm in this court when there is a
whole box of wafers on the clerk’s desk.”
The Bulletin’s Missing Word Compe-
tition No. 10 closes on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 1894.
One of the sensations of the Monson
murder trial in Scotland was a ghastly experiment
practised on three corpses. The cadavers were set
up in a position as nearly as possible resembling
that occupied, or supposed to be occupied, by
Harnbrough at the moment of his death,
and then shot at in order to decide
whether the fatal wound could have been self-
inflicted. After the bombardment, sundry
doctors, with the gruesome cooksureness which
characterises the medical expert when he
is swearing away somebody’s life, decided that
the case was obviously one of murder. As a
matter of fact, however, they couldn’t have
proved anything of the kind. The theory of the
defence was that Harnbrough had been climbing
over a fence, or scrambling through some
brushwood, and dragging his gun behind him,
after the customary fashion of the idiot who
“didn’t know it was loaded.” Therefore, if the
medical experts had climbed over the same
obstruction, each dragging a loaded gun
behind him, and each expert had shot
himself in the process, it might have been
decided whether a man could blow the side and
most of the back of his head off by his own act.
As it was, the experiment only proved that it
could be done by somebody else’s act, which every-
body knew before. Anyhow, the Monson case
has supplied a new and valuable precedent, which
may prove useful in the future. Some day, when
a man is bashed to death at a political meeting,
and the defence pleads that he really killed himself
by pounding his own head against the doorstep, the
law will hire a prize-fighter to pound with his fists
on the head of a corpse, and thus decide whether
the skull-fracture arose from outside causes or
otherwise. It will be a gratifying spectacle—a
late sitting of the court by the light of a few
flaring gas-jets; a sleepy Judge blinking on the
bench ; the medical experts standing round watch-
ing the progress of the experiment; and the
bruiser in the box with the cadaver’s staring head
in chancery, pounding away on the senseless,
shaven skull, with ink blots on the scalp to show
where the fracture ought to be. Then when the
disorganised remnant seems to have been suffi-
ciently pounded it will be removed and dissected,
and if the result is not sufficiently definite a new
corpse will be brought in, and the defence will rise
and demand that a new bruiser shall be appointed
on the ground that the previous one was a biassed
witness, and the fresh pugilist will be duly sworn
to bang the remains in the interest of the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
according to the good old formula, and then he
will seize upon the remains, and get them into
position, and go for them.

The Apotheosis of Premier Patterson.
J. B. Patterson, the fierce meat-man of
Castlemaine, who is now Premier of Victoria,
has been organising a new grovel. His idea
is that the people of Australasia, or rather a
few dozen politicians who are hungering
after titles and personal distinctions, and
who will profess to represent the sentiments
of the people, should send a cordial invita-
tion to the Duke of York and his bride,
inviting them to visit these provinces, and
listen to the enthusiastic whoops of “ their
future subjects.” According to the eloquent
language of the inflated Patterson, the mvita-
tion would be a “ gracious act but perhaps
it would be better to let that energetic ex-pig-
slayer speak in lus own words. A circular
letter addressed by him to the other Aus-
tralasian Premiers, in which document the
great idea was first mooted, runs thus
Would it not have a K ood effect on the whole of Aus-
tralasia just now to get our future king and queen, the
Duke of York and his you.ig wife, to piy us a visit, say
during next year? I think it would be beneficial in
every point of view. Anything that strennthens the
cords between ua and the old country strengthens our
position and importance. The visit would probably be
extremely interesting to “Young Australia,’’ with whom
it would assist the growth of patriotic and loyal feeling,
and tend to popularise our connection with that old Imd
from which we sprang. At this juncture, too, an event
like this would do much good in raising the spirits of
these communities after ihe late depression, which we
have all felt so much. The Prince has been here before,
when he came in his boyhood as a young sailor in the
Bacchante, and this may be expected to whet his interest
in revisiting the same scenes with his wife, now that he
is heir-presumptive to the throne. I would propose that
we should each send a cordially-worded telegram through
the Governor simultaneously, instructing the Agents-
General, and following up with a memorandum, which
the Governor can forward by mail. Kindly let me have
your answer as early os convenient, as the Princes
programme is probably filled for some time ahead.
• # *
Patterson’s absurdly ungrammatical sug-
gestion, it is interesting to note, has been
adopted promptly and with enthusiasm, and,
as we write, the invitation is already on
its way. It purports, of course, to be sent
iu the name of the people of Australasia,
though, as there has been no semblance of a
pretence at consulting them, the assumption
that it is their invitation is as utterly false
as are “ loyal ” assumptions in general. And
the refusal will probably be as prompt and as
enthusiastic as was the invitation. For the
Duke of York is a personage of immense
value to the British monarchy, and his life is
not to be lightly risked on the seas, or among
possibilities of infection beside the Yarra.
Since the death of the Duke of Clarence his
brother, the weakly York, is the only in-
dividual who stands between the throne and
the horrible possibility of a Fife dynasty.
If he were to die without an heir, then the
Imperial heritage must go to an awful Scotch
family with kilts and red hair on its legs,
and this prospect is too dreadful for contem-
plation. Britain has been ruled by foreigners
for so many years that the possible accession
of a British sovereign is a thing to
be avoided by every imaginable means.
Also, Britain has such a slavish reverence for
royal blood, even if it is the blood of a
German sub-monarch whose kingdom is only
a Sabbath-day's journey in circumference,
that the accession of a “subject” would
damage the royal tradition, probably beyond
repair.
* • •
Therefore, the chance of the British royal
family risking the life of its heir on any far
journeyings is just about the same as the
chance of an Australian squatter turning out
his 700-guinea prize ram to run wild in the
bush. Consequently, the knighthood which
would almost certainly fall to Butcher James
if the invitation were accepted is about as
hopeless as anything well can be, and his
circular is chiefly interesting as showing his
own lamentable state of mind. His first
idea is that a visit from the Duke of York
would help to strengthen the “cords” which
bind us to the “mother land.” Other
“ loyalists ” have babbled about the “ silken
thread ” which connects us with that remote
island, but Patterson’s metaphors are large
and hulking like himself, and suggestive
of the hangman’s rope, or of German sausage,
or of the gristle in his own bullocks. If
Patterson were a monarch his yearning
after the large and the imposing would impel
him to reign with a golden bedpost for a
sceptre—or else with a Cape-0 tway-range
tree-trunk. According to his view, the Duke
of. Yorks advent would help to raise the
spirits of the community—which simply
means that Patterson s own spirits would
be raised if he got a knighthood, and that
he mistakes himself for the community.
And there is something weird and awful
in the suggestion that Australia should hurry
up with the invitation before the Prince is
otherwise disposed of. It is reminiscent of
the old butcher days at Castlemaine, when
James B. Patterson’s customers were in-
vited to send in their orders promptly in
order to avoid disappointment. Patterson
can’t rid himself of the recollections of these
old days, therefore he wants Australasia to
send in its order promptly, lest the last
fore-quarter of the Duke of York be disposed
of before it arrives, and the sirloin should be
all gone, and there should be such a run on
the prime cuts that nothing remains.
Patterson’s invitation is, doubtless, meant
as a compliment, but the compliment comes
down in much the same w r ay that the aggres-
sive Premier used to come down on his own
blood-stained meat-block in his younger
days. His desire to grovel before the heir-
presumptive may be pleasant enough for the
heir himself, but it is decidedly unpleasant
for the present occupant of the throne. No
sovereign, however aged, cares to be cabled
to by a blatant butcher at the other side of
the world, with a reminder that she is only
mortal. But the ambitious Patterson, in
his own coarse fashion, is a far-seeing man,
and probably recognises great possibilities
in the royal visit—if it ever comes off. Next
year there will probably be another heir in
existence, and the succession to the British
crown will be provided for down to the
fourth generation, for the Guelphs are a
painfully numerous family, and the supply
of heirs never runs short. And if the Duke
of York could be induced to visit Australia
next year, that heir might be born on Aus-
tralian soil, and Butcher James, as the
originator of the visit, might hold it as god-
father at the baptismal font, and might be
the first to suggest that Britain’s un-
developed king should in future be known as
the Prince of Australia. Then the city where
the birth took place would get so far ahead
of all other Australian cities that it would
almost to a certainty be the capital of Fede-
rated Australia. Therefore, the Victorians
would set forth the great advantages of being
born at Toorak or Brighton, and New South
Wales would point out that Manly Beach is
a good place to be born at, and Queens-
landers would demand that the future king
should be born at Southport, and there would
be great confusion and danger of civil war in
the land. And, at last, as the only way out
of the difficulty, it would probably be neces-
sary for the royal visitors to take their way
to Thargomindah in the great wild west, and
let the coming monarch see the light for the
first time under the wattle and in the shade
of the ragged eucalyptus. Then, when his
great-grandmother is dust, and his grand-
father and his father have taken a short turn
each upon the throne, he could reign as
Thargomindah 1., Emperor of the Back-
blocks, and Australia would rise to great
honour thereby, and the aggressive jowl of
Butcher Patterson would be graved in im-
perishable brass and erected all over the
land.
# # #
There is one chance —a microscopic one at
the best—that the ex-meat-man’s dream may
be realised. The health of the Duke of
York, like that of the rest of his family, is
not of the best, and the idea of sending him
out to recuperate in the land where his
uncle’s wash-bill is still unpaid, might have
some attractions. When a British royalty
of any importance goes to recuperate on the
continent of Europe the process is apt to
consist too exclusively of much drinking
with foreign emperors, and to avoid this
evil the Duke of York might be despatched
to Australia for a brief season, there to be
killed by colonial beer and talked to death
by wild wattle poets. If he should come
The Bulletin can only pray that the local
anarchist may throw no bombs at him, and
that he may be allowed to go his way in
peace. Australia was made disgustingly
loyal for twenty years because a local
maniac shot the uninteresting Edinburgh,
and the country has even now hardly
recovered from the injury done to the
under part of that parsimonious dignitary.
But the chances of Patterson’s order for a
fore-quarter of royalty ever being filled are
so exceedingly remote that this aspect of the
case is hardly worth considering. The Duke
of York is not coming. Patterson’s knight-
hood, so far as it depends upon the Austra-
lian advent of Pork—we mean York—is only
a dream, and the vision of the Victorian
Premier scowling affably at a pair of royal
twins as he holds, them at the baptismal font
is a vision and nothing more.

Therefore, about forty tons of unnecessary
food will remain unconsumed, and four
thousand hogsheads of needless liquor will
remain undrunk, and many clumsy, though
well-meaning, citizens will not make a
hideous exhibition of themselves in their
effort to dance lightly on an unaccustomed
toe, and much apoplectic feeding and much
wild cheering by fat, red capitalists with
grease and crumbs in their beards, will be
altogether left out. And, as further conse-
quences, many incoherent and hiccupy
speeches about the silken bonds will con-
tinue to be undelivered, and many frantic
poems beginning with “Great offshoot of a
royal race,” and similar unsupported state-
ments, will be unwritten and unsung,
and vast quantities of agitated slobber
which would otherwise afflict the daily press
will be a lost affliction. Also, Thargomindah
I. will be missing from the roll of British
monarchs, like those other three shadow
kings, James 111., Charles 111. and Henry
IX., who moulder under a tombstone at
Home. Therefore, The Bulletin suggests
that it would be a delicate attention to erect
a marble mausoleum at the dreary town out-
back, with an inscription upon it setting
forth that it is sacred to the memory of that
British king who might have been born in
the metropolis of Federated Australia under
the auspices of Sir J. B. Patterson, but for
the fact that his parents didn’t come, in con-
sequence of which he was born somewhere
else, and, as a further result, Thargomindah
never became the capital of Australia, and
that country is not Federated, and Patter-
son continues to be plain Butcher Patterson
to the end of his discordant days.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Twang.
Chief Justice Madden has dared to attend a
girls’-school Speech Day, and tell the angels
that their speech is disfigured by a “colonial
twang.” He besought them to pronounce the
English vowels as they are intended, and to
keep their little noses out of the matter as
much as possible. Whereupon the Argus
started a solemn enquiry into the why and
wherefore of twang in this country, and came
to the conclusion that it is begotten of mental
and physical laziness. Ghastly nonsense is
lavished upon the subject of “ colonial twang.”
Practically there is no difference between the
dialect of the London loafer, who leans against
a wall and spits, and the pronunciation of the
Southern larrikin, who does ditto. But in this
country the nasal loafer is more generally in
evidence, his voice is more heard, and his
accent infests the land instead of being localised.
The early English convicts, mostly from Lon-
don, brought it over with them. Early Aus-
tralian parents were too busy, and generally too
uneducated, to notice that their offspring had
caught the complaint, and said “ kike ” for
“cake,” and “gripes” for* “grapes.” In
England the desire to imitate the twang is
knocked out of children at boarding-school.
The twang is considered “ very low indeed ” by
people who drop their h’s freely. Austra-
lian girls are instinctively correct as regards
the old, preposterous Anglo-Saxon aspirate,
whilst their twang, bred amidst the courts
and alleys of New Babylon, is also
very pronounced. If the thing is to be
eradicated, the reformers must start upon
State schools at once, for every year brings its
thousands of recruits to the twang brigade. At
present there is no effort made to raise the
standard of State school accent, nor are the
masters in general aware that it is a terrible
thing to hear the youngsters reading. They
read nearly as nasally themselves. The twang
is everywhere—in Victoria, at any rate—ring-
ing in one’s ears. If it remains on familiar
terms with society for a few years longer, it
■will become the accepted pronunciation of the
country and pass as “ good form.” But whether
the “ colonial twang ” dies out of Australian
mouths, or grows and strengthens and is im-
proved, on the American system, the fact will
remain that it was never at the beginning any-
thing better than the twang of cockney vul-
garity. We imported it, long before rabbits,
sparrows, snails, and other British nuisances
were grafted upon our budding civilisation. /
The Japs in Torres Straits.
The Brisbane and Sydney daily press has sud-
denly become violently aware that Japanese
are crowding the whites out of Thursday
Island. The curse has long been notoriously
apparent in Torres Straits, and has by no
means been abated since a Japanese syndicate
won £27,000 net in a big Southern racing
sweep. Japanese own, perhaps, the finest fleet
of boats to be seen in the Straits, and it is no
uncommon sight to see these boats at work in
British waters with the Japanese flag flying at
the peak ! These boats employ only Japs,
They are not registered in Japanese names,
and it is a legal question whether the Q.
Government could not, if it chose, forfeit and
sell them. While men down South need to be
warned against working their way up to
Thursday Island, in the hope of there earning
good wages. Except a rarely fortunate one,
the white man who lands moneyless on
Thursday Island drops into the quagmire of
bottomless loaferdorn. Most “ stations,” ashore
and afloat, refuse to employ white men, or only
accept them so far as is absolutely necessary.
The constant instreaming of Japs keeps the
market in full supply of crews. The heathen
usually arrives unable to speak one word of
English; but he is shipped as “seaman” all
the same—a fact that should be interesting to
Australian marine assurance offices that accept
risks on boats the crews of which cannot under-
stand the orders given. The Jap “ sea-
man ” is on the articles as receiving stan-
dard wages; but, as a rule, he receives
much less. He “learns English” during
his first term of engagement —usually six
months. As to the female question: White
women who trade in their own charms are
peremptorily ordered oft' the Island. Japanese
harlots ply their calling undisturbed. More :
they often devote their savings towards pur-
chasing boats for their male friends. All this
is ancient history, furrowing itself more deeply
into the life of Thursday Island every « year.
But, since good dog Towzer has asked the Slip-
Press to give one yap in unison with his bark,
it has been thought worthy of resurrection. It
would be interesting to know when John
Douglas —unquestionably a man of mental
nobility and integrity—a gentleman of honor
who has given signal proof of his contempt for
social caste—sent in his first report on this
subject to any Q, Government, and why his
reports have been merely pigeonholed,
“ToDied Away.”
A little while ago Premier Patterson, of Vic-
toria, announced, in his own frank and butcher-
like fashion, that the Treasury had no more
money to “fool away” on providing work for
the unemployed. Therefore the unemployed
were to shift for themselves, and the bounceable
James B. washed his hands of all responsibility.
Considering the piteous state to which Mel-
bourne, in particular, is reduced, the statement
seemed rather unfeeling, but most people
assumed that Patterson was acting under the
pressure of hard necessity, and that his mode
of expression was not meant for inhumanity,
but was merely the result of deficient education
and natural coarseness. Melbourne, ever since
the boom, has been about the most hunger-
strikeu and abjectly wretched city south of the
line, and death from star station —a thing hither-
to practically unheard-of in Australian cities—
has begun to make its ghastly appearance
at intervals in the daily newspaper re-
ports. Still, if the Treasury is absolutely
empty, as Patterson represented it to be,
then there is no immediate remedy for these
horrors, so far as the Government is concerned.
Patterson explained all this with the friendly
air of a man who brains a calf, and the country
accepted it in the same spirit. Yet only a few
days after his announcement that he had no
money to fool away in granting relief to the
hungry and the helpless he conceived the great
idea of inviting the Duke of York to Australia,
and filling the country with banquets and
champagne and all manner of glittering orgies
in his honour. Therefore, Patterson can
obviously find either money or credit, provided
it is to be spent in grovel instead of food, and
(incidentally) in scrambling after a title for
himself instead of furnishing work for the
hungry masses. The coarse and bowelless in-
humanity of the ex-butcher here stands out
conspicuously —in fact, it is difficult to
know whether his inhumanity or his
coarseness is the more conspicuous. To
Patterson the relief of the worst distress ever
known in Australia is a “ fooling away” of
public money, while the unauthorised and
inevitable expenditure of thousands in shows
and banquets, which will only weary the royal
recipient and make him wish that Patterson
were in the nether hell, is a lofty and com-
mendable proceeding. Yet, among all the
Governments of Australasia there arose not one
Minister with courage enough to tell this
offensive politician of his brutality and his
wormy degradation. Truly democrats are
wonderfully scarce in Australia.
Duncan Gillies, the newly-appointed Vic.
Agent-General, is probably the least en-
lightened public man in Australia. He knows
little about this country, and has forgotten
anything he may ever have known concerning
the country he came from. His history is re-
markable for lack of variety, Duncan having
been one of the most monotonous persons that
ever lived upon the revenue. Thirty or forty
years ago the Ballarat diggers returned him to
Parliament on account of his peculiar inability
to find gold an} 7 where else. With the charit-
able idea of “ doing something for talker
Gillies,” who could do no good for himself with
a pick, they sent him up to the House.
And to the House he has clung like
a barnacle. The miserable little political
world of Victoria is the only world that
Duncan is a man of. There he has moved—
or, rather, sat—during what ought to have
been the productive portion of his lifetime,
absorbing the petty secrets of v political
“generalship,” acquiring an unwholesome mass
of official experience, and cultivating the art of
doing nothing with an air of importance. He has
lived only to sit in Parliament, and lias sat in


Parliament to live. Under his premiership the
state of Victoria turned rotten and the finances
went raving mad, to the subsequent surprise
of Gillies, whose little mind was full of gas
and tactics all the time. Quite unconsciously
he was a curse to the Constitution, by reason
of his ghastly ignorance of things outside the
House. There is but one side to Duncan
Gillies’s character —one narrow, thin side,
which consists entirely of front. As an up-
holder of Victorian “prestige” in London it
would, no doubt, he difficult to beat him. He
is specially built and trained for any position
that has no real purpose beyond the adjoining
salary.
Grandfather Parkes, at latest advices, was
going to Westralia to deliver speeches to the
inhabitants. When he returns from W.A. he
intends to stump Maoriland. Now that Higin-
botham— hats off!—is dead and Judas Grif-
fith has vanished from the political stage,
Parkes feels more hopeful than ever that he
will be the first Premier of federated Australia,
and when he shakes his hoary mane over the
seven provinces of Australasia he feels that he
is practically stumping his future electorate.
But a man of Parkes’ character and ante-
cedents must never he permitted to engineer
himself into the George WashiNgton-slhp of
Australia. Should he ever dare to pose
as an aspirant for what: will amount to the
Presidentship, a full, true and exact
history of him, personal and political,
written with a knife, printed in vitriol, and
signed with the name of the author, should be
sent to every man and woman on every electoral
roll in Australasia, and to the editor of every
paper in the English-speaking world. So far,
the Presidential posturings of this shock-
headed old political greaser don’t signify as
much as a row of pins, and may be smiled at
accordingly ; hut should he venture at time of
action to aspire to the chiefship of our nation
there are several newspapers and scores of
thousands of men and women ready to
demonstrate that Australia has not yet
sank so low as to he dependent for
a figure - head upon any person of his
calibre. In the Federal Convention he cut a
despicable figure and was heartily desp sed by
all his colleagues, even by some who were joints
in his tail; and ten years after he has departed
and has been followed to Heaven or elsewhere
by Ids miserable claqueurs he will he as dead,
historically, as is Governor Phillip’s butler, if
Gov. Phillip ever had a butler. Parkes, as
energetic an advertiser as the late pill-man,
Holloway, has never yet given people an
opportunity of sitting down in a cool place and
asking “ What has he done?” What has he
done ?

The first note of discord has been heard from
“ New Australia.” Hitherto the news lias
dealt .exclusively with oranges and blossoms,
with dark-eyed seuors playing softly upon
guitars, and moonlight dances on the deck as
the steamer ploughed its way up the shimmering
Parana river, and, in a general way, with
soft breathings of love among the bowers and
the ethereal beauty ami romance of things in
general. But now it is briefly reported that
eight common, large-hooted Australians, with
nopoetry orguitarororange-hlossom about them,
have risen up and quitted the settlement in
protest against “ the injustice of the adminis-
tration ” (which, say Lane & Co., cut off their
grog-supply), and have telegraphed to the nextlot
of argonauts to carefully stay away. This is
probably the first result of Lane being made
Dictator. In New Australia everything was
to he decided by popular vote, but instead the
Paraguayan Government made Lane sole
magistrate, chief of police, and the whole
system of local government in himself, and so
the dream faded. Lane, in fact, seems to have
been appointed absolute boss - tyrant, and,
however wisely he may use his power, the fact
that he is boss-tyrant knocks one beautiful vision
on the head.
On Saturday night the jury in the Speight-
Syme libel case returned a general verdict for
Mr. Speight with £lOO damages, bub were sent
hack to make a separate deliverance on each of
the numerous counts; however, that £lOO
represented the aggregate opinion of the jury on
Saturday. It seems a pity that the verdict
wasn’t accompanied by the jury’s reasons for
arriving at it. The Age undoubtedly wrecked
Speight’s character to the very utmost of
its ability. Therefore tne jury either in-
tends to convey that Speight had only £lOO
worth of character to he damaged, or that
the Age, when it is cursing its hardest with the
loud pedal down, can only do £lOO worth of
damage altogether; or else that Speight’s
business character was exceedingly had, but that
the Age represented it as being worse, to the
extent of £lOO worth of libel, than it really
was. Anyhow, the jury intended to convey that
Speight should receive £lOO and his costs from
Syme for injury received. And, seeing that the
recovery of that £lOO will probably cost
Speight £lO,OOO, over and above the costs
allowed by the court, the case is chiefly
valuable as another advt, for the iniquity of
the law. That grand old Oriental device,
according to which an intricate case used to be
settled by making the plaintiff and defendant
dive in deep water—the verdict going to the
party who came up last or who never came up
at all—has been improved on in Australia. For
in this country neither party comes up again,
and neither gets a verdict. The verdict goes to
the lawyers on the hank.
The Victorian Cabinet has decided that
Frances Knorr, the hahy-murderer of Mel-
bourne, shall be executed in the good old way,
and the rope is being soaped and the gallows
carefully overhauled accordingly. It is diffi-
cult to see what other decision a Cabinet, with
a solid faith in capital punishment, could have
arrived at. The crime of which Frances
Knorr was convicted was one which pre-
sented no single redeeming feature. It was bald,
unvarnished murder, perpetrated not from sud-
den passion, or drink, or jealousy, or revenge, or
under any form of provocation whatever, but
done in cold blood and from the meanest
motives. It was, in short, professional murder
done for 305., or thereabouts. The only pos-
sible reason why Frances Knorr should not
be executed is the fact that she is a woman,
and in a country which supports the gallows as
a permanent institution there is no more cause
why a woman should not he executed (or
flogged) than there is why a man should not be
executed or flogged under the same set of cir-
cumstances. The rope fits her neck quite as
well as it does that of a male assassin, and the
formal inquest on a woman with a broken neck
is- no more horrible than the inquest on a man
with a similar dislocation ; and, barring the
fact that her skirts may possibly get in the way
of the drop and that her hair needs to he cut
short in order to facilitate the arrange-
ment of the noose, her sex makes no visible
difference. The plea that capital punish-
ment is altogether brutal, disgusting, and
unnecessary may he a logical reason why
Frances Knorr should not be hanged, but the
plea that there is any special horror about the
execution of a woman, because she is a woman,
is a mere spineless sentiment, and the Cabinet
of ex-Butcher Patterson evidently realises the
fact. The matter was formally decided last
Friday, but it was really decided the day that
a damp judge passed sentence and commended
the criminal’s soul to God according to the
good old platitude of the law. The decision
was written in legible characters on Patter*
son’s aggressive underjaw, and anyone who
knew that portentous bone would have recog-
nised it from the very first.

enjoy all the comforts of a homo with a labourer
possessed of £3O capital and good prospects. For
two days, during which she cost her husband only
“a penny for hairpins,” in addition to her keep,
the bridal pair were presumably very, very happy.
On the third day the bridegroom notified his
better half that he was going away, never to
return, nor had he returned at latest dates. A
Bench, on being applied to, said “it would be a
pity to part the young couple,” so they issued a
warrant for the arrest of the missing partner and
remanded the case for a fortnight. This magis-
terial faith in the re-uniting properties of the law
is most affecting. If a husband repudiates his
bride after two days’ trial, and tells her not to
worry him further, the difficulty, it seems, can be
overcome by a warrant. The great object of the
Court is to make married couples live happily
together—an obvious impossibility in cases where
the husband remains absent. Therefore they send
a policeman to bring back the sheep that was lost
and domestic felicity is restored.
A London paper :
Paraguay is essentially a land of women, for the men
have been swept off by civil wars and revolution, especi-
ally by the wars of Lopez, and the women are anything
but a nice lot. Of course, now and again, one comes
across a very magnificent specimen of the Guarani girl,
tall and stately, serene of countenance, with skin like
brown satin, piercing black eyes, heavy black hair falling
in braids below her waist, and figure well-formed and
graceful; but the picture is always spoilt by the big cigar
which she is sure to be chewing and sucking at all the
time. From a very early age, the women of Paraguay all
smoke big cigars, and the natural result is that their
teeth are blackened very soon by the nicotine, and their
breath is far from savoury. Besides, even the handsomest
of Guarani girls “ goes off ” in the most painful manner
in a very short time. Before she has well
reached middle age, this dusky Diana will be
as hideous a specimen of decayed humanity as her
mother; and a Guarani mother is always an awful old
hag—scrawny, blear-eyed, and wrinkled as a dried fig.
The majority of the women are, however, not Dianas at
all. They are ugly in face, shrill in tongue, sad and
miserable in appearance, and, moreover, splay-footed,
owing to their constant disuse of shoes and stockings.
Add to this that they are always sucking at one of the big
coarse cigars of the country, or chewing the end of one,
and the picture is complete. In one thing, however, the
women of Paraguay excel. Their figures are wonderful,
and their carriage is Juno-like. This is mainly due to
their habit of carrying packages on their heads, which
strengthens the spine as in the case of Hindoo women.
Such adepts are the Paraguayan girls at this that they
will carry an empty water-jug poised at a rakish angle on
the head, and go down the st reet stopping to gaze at any-
thing of interest, or to talk to acquaintances without for
a moment endangering the safety of their load. The
women of the upper classes are mostly half-bred
Spaniards. They are usually far from handsome, but are
very amorous and very jealous. They are also lazy, and
not particular about ablutions. Their idea of pleasure is
to eat sweets and swing in hammocks. They are devoted
to dancing, and dance with an energy perfectly astound-
ing by contrast with their usual laziness. They are born
intriguers, and have played an important part in the
secret history of all the civil disturbances of the country.
A Requiem.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The sun was bathed in the heaving sea ;
The sea, in the glow of the sun ;
And there came, from the glorious harmony,
Three voices, blended in one—
Voices that, passing, sadly told
Of the ceasing of things to be,
In the wane of the year, the sunset gold, ,
And the ebb of the sobbing sea.
Soft western winds, through briar and cleft,
Delivered the Year’s “Good-bye ; ”
And the wistful East grew grey, bereft
Of the Year condemned to die.
The sands lay bare as the sun sank down—
The sun that killed the Year;
And the whole world wept, in funereal gown,
As the night-pall draped the bier.
Gloomily sounded the muffled deep,
Within its hollow caves ;
And I heard a world of voices weep
Behind the swirling waves—
Weep for the life, for the love, for the light;
Weep for the hope, beside,
That had died with the Year, and gone out, that
night,
Away on the ebb of the tide.
Thou Power, that best in the Caves of Death !
Thou Slave-god, lying in thrall!
Of life, the life ; of breath, the breath ;
Thou Mystery, hid from all !
That shap’st from decay, in charnel-den,
By a subtle alchemy,
The forest-tree and the brains of men,
Ay, all that comes to be
Say, is’t so, with the souls of the sons of men,
As it is with earth’s grosser mould?
Shall hope, love, life, be shapen again
From the sere and dead and cold ?
The Slave-god is silent. Though he may hark,
He will not answer me ;
And the Year is dead, and the West is dark,
And eternally moans the sea.
Paeroa, M.L.

Adelaide Advertiser on the recent local
tragedy:—
The sickly sentimentality which induces people to gloat
over scenes of horror and death drew crowds to the
thoroughfare in which the butchery was committed, and
all day long corrupt curiosity caused men and women to
gape and stare at the commonplace shop in which most of
the bodies lay.
Then follow seven columns of long-drawn-out
“ blood,” “ brains,” “ gaping wounds,” and
“bloody weapons.” And. the ’Tiser wood cuts !
The murderer little knew what he was inflicting
on the poor Adelaide public !
Although the Bill to abolish Supreme
Court holidays was ejected from New South
Wales Assembly last session, it seems certain
that the “long vacation” is not going to be
so long nor so complete as it used to be. The
Supreme Court offices are now to be kept open
right through vacation, and much business will be
taken in various courts during January. Also, it
is said that the judicial Joshuas are not going to
make the sun of litigation stand still for eight
weeks, but, on the contrary, will allow time to run
in matters of pleading during at least a part of
vacation. Which changes will suit the struggling
junior who can’t get away for a long tour, but will
much “ nark ” the seniors, who will have to limit
their excursions.
An English paper reports the discovery
that if peat moss is heated up to a certain degree
with diluted sulphuric acid and afterwards fer-
mented with yeast, excellent whisky is the result.
Apropos of the heat and the general thirst, this
seems a fitting season tor an item on strange
drinks. In one of the Ellice Group of islands the
natives had, and perhaps still have, a wholesome
family drink brewed by winding fathoms of coir
cinnet around pigs’ snouts till the animals are ready
to burst with suffocation, and then cutting their
throats and mixing the hot blood with the pulp of
mashed-up young coeoanuts. Also, in one district of
New Guinea, according to a well-known missionary,
the decease of the head of the family is made the
occasion for much quiet festivity. The body is
placed upon a platform in the house, said plat-
form being built for the occasion, and in about a
week or eight days it is generally reported to be
sufficiently mellow. A committee of the mourning
relatives then sits around with drinking vessels in
their hands, and chant the virtues of the swollen
departed. Then the deceased’s nearest relation
rises up and—but on the whole it seems advisable
to change the subject just about here.
Apropos the whales disporting outside
Sydney Heads recently. Two years ago, one of
Macgregor’s (Tas.) whaling captains, having cut
the blubber from a whale, was about to cast the
rest adrift, when there came alongside two Hobart
fishermen —“Portuguee Joe” and his mate, an
African negro. The Portuguese begged to be
given the carcase, so that they might tow it
ashore, and make what they could of it. “All
right,” said the skipper, with the generosity of a
satisfied exploiter who knew the blubber business
to its omega. Joe, having got leviathan’s frame-
work on to the beach, began to search for
ambergris, which drug was quoted at that time in
the current price-lists at somewhere about =Bl3
per oz. He found 174 lb. Many people inter-
viewed him and wanted to give him from <£sooo
to .£9OOO for the lot; but the man understood the
luck of his find, and got a friendly and dis-
interested Hobart resident to place him in direct
communication with the best London brokers.
Meanwhile, the ambergis was lodged with a bank
—which was presently served with an injunction,
on behalf of the Macgregor firm, to restrain the
sale of the precious prize pending a discus-
sion re ownership. But these legal fireworks
fizzled out, and the ambergis is still being
gradually realised in London, the two fishermen
having already received several thousands of
pounds apiece. By the way, a Dunedin (M.L.)
chemist once gave a few hundreds for a lump of
ambergris, which he afterwards sold for .£9OOO.
That chemist knew “too much, yet not quite
enough.” At the then market rates, he should
have got £50,000 for it, instead of £9OOO. Amber-
gris is a substance that has baffled scientific defini-
tion. It is found floating on the sea, and in the
intestinal canal of the cachalot, or spermaceti-
yielding whale. It appears to have its origin in
some of the while’s meat-diet, and has been
regarded by some us being in the nature of biliary
calculi.

Were The Bulletin asked for the recipe
of “Beauty and the Beast,” at Sydney Lyceum,
it would answer: “Take 987,645 tons of King
Beetle splendour, striped paint, pink legs, lime-
light, frocks and female loveliness, and flavour
piquantly with one comedian disguised principally
in a rug-strap.” Lauri is that comedian—without
him the whole glorious splodge of dazzle would
probably give you ocular dyspepsia. In a word,
he is the olive of the show, and the other wags,
hired to tone down the sentiment and relieve the
loveliness of the thing, merely clear the_ course for
him. ’ The test of the true comedian is when he
is confronted by a limp and doddering book that
doesn’t even fib the scenery, and is expected to
tickle the groundlings with wheezes as old as
Abraham. Then art steps in when author fails —
and “author” fails like a sandbank in “Beauty
and the Beast.”
* * •
Miss Nellie Stewart is personally very
happily cast as Beauty, and although her style is
much too refined for even the most gentle form of
variety business, still a real artist always fits into
the puzzle somehow. Her song of “ Molly and I
and the Baby” will be whistled everywhere, and
the very Prenchy “Marguerite” song is another
huge success—the fanciful dance included. By
the way, the management might enlarge the Blue
Couch in the Beast’s Palace —the human intellect
totters at the mere thought of what would happen
if Beauty had the nightmare and plunged about
much. Florence Young is far and away too
girlish for the Prince, but she sings her songs
acceptably and looks extremely neat. Polly
Emery and Elsie Cameron, as the comic sisters,
are amusing while they last. Their first duet,
“O, Mister Porter !” is the funniest duo in the
’mime, but the “ fat ” is scantily served out to the
twain, and beyond sporting loud colours and fat,
false cheeks, they are not a side-splitting experi-
ence all through. Vernon has rather a hoarse
explanatory part as a monkey major-domo,
Lissant’s legs act very well as the Beast.
« » «
The butterfly Bartho is the spirit of the
spectacular part of the ’mime, for whenever there
is a great rush of elaborately-clad people and a
ranging of forces for dazzling ballet-spectacles,
Bartho, of the swansdown floatsomeness, is sure
to find a clear patch to disport herself. In the
extravagantly-dressed procession of nations at
Chicago (which fell a little fiat on Boxing Night,
because there was no allegorical Australia to set
the gods going) Mdlle. B. gives a series of national
dances, which are not only correctly dressed and
stepped, but are done with national feeling. At
the same time, Bartho in ballet-costume as the
white butterfly of the first act is undoubtedly
Bartho at her best. Lucy Cobb gives a serpentine
dance, made gaudy by a plaid reflection —like the
spirit of the Duff tartan wrestling with the lime-
light-man. “Beauty and the Beast” is a very
overwhelming spectacle, and if W. & M. try to
outshine it on some future occasion the Arch-
angels will probably send down a celestial law-
yer’s letter to say that Paradise is copyright. The
usual harlequinade, arranged by George Lauri,
plays the audience out of the house.
*» * *
Another courageous management has arisen
at Sydney Imperial Opera House—coming in like
a lion, to go out, probably, like a very badly shorn
lamb if the old blight doesn’t lift for the new
year. An energetic opera 00. commenced a comic
opera season in that haunt of theatrical frosts on
Boxing- Night, opening in the “ Royal Middy.”
As the versatile and much-mixed middy, Miss
' Oolborne-Baber proves herself the king-bolt of the
show. Miss Baber, besides looking pretty, acts
piquantly and tirelessly, and though her speaking
voice is borrowed from various sources her singing
voice is bright and clever. “Willie Walsho”as
the giddy king, controls his strong tenor so as to
till the theatre without raising the roof, and is
burdened with a part in which the victim has to
stand in an attitude of profound attention while
various people bully-rag him from the centre. One
pleasant thing about the gigantic Walshe is that
you never fear when the heroine faints backwards
on top of him that she is going to bowl him over.
• • •
Farley, as a lymphatic Don with plenty of
“fat,” renews a success of Emelie Melville’s
traditions; and Miss Edith Moore, as the Queen,
manages her voice and her train much better
than the only other Queen The Bulletin ever
saw. That monarch, to whom this paper now
figuratively kisses its hand, had a long train
of Guv’ment blanket working out between her
large, flat feet, and she was asking for ’bacca in
a voice not a bit like Miss Moore’s. Mr. Mor-
rison, as Mungo, is the wag of the undertaking;
and Harry Craig, as Don Domingo, might be a
great deal worse. The “Royal Middy” isn’t
staged to bankrupt the management, but the
dresses are well done.
“Jack the Giant Killer,” at Sydney Her
Majesty’s, is running strong and well for its
second week, and the howl of the agitated infants
when Joe Tolano writhes across in the iron grip
of a giant whose head is lost in the flies is highly
complimentary to the management. Also the
comic characters seem to have a deeper sense of
their responsibilities. “A funny man” is—or
ought to be—a sort of snowball of wit and humour
-—you should never know when he’s finished grow-
ing—the mechanical witticisms of pantomime
authors are never good enough to travel
on. Apropos of “Jack” —the Xmas-keeping
compositor inferred last week that the writer
thought the harlequinade more than atoned for
the transformation, which is an error of the
deepest dye. Brunton’s “Birth of the New Year”'
is a glittering vision of unearthly beauty that
maltej one even forgive the clown when he is pick-
ing eggs out of the pantaloon, as if that knock-
knee’d annual were an incubator.
** * *
“ Charley’s Aunt,” which holds possession
of the long-deserted “ Cri.,” is a little tale whoso
merits undoubtedly are high—a short and simple
story of the multifarious woes which fall upon the
spirit of a man in woman’s clothes. The man a
British lord is ;he is short and dull and fat; his
legs abbreviated are, and bis mind is brief and
squat. The tale begins at Oxford with a dinner
laid for five, but one member of the party fails
somehow to arrive; and one comes uninvited with
a red and dr inky nose, and the fizz has been em-
bezzled by the man in woman’s clothes. Four
members of the party are very deep in love ; one’s
in mourning for a husband who has lately gone
above; one’s in drink, one’s in the army—at least,
we’re led so to suppose—and one, as already men-
tioned, is disguised in women’s clothes. This per-
son’s manners, so to speak, are much behind the
age, for he seriously proceedeth to undress upon
the stage; but when, without his frock, he
bounds upon his native heath, we find, to our
relief, he’s got his pants on underneath. If he
hadn’t, what might happen it’s impossible to say,
for he’d probably be naked—in a general sort of
way.
• • *
The people all belong unto the aristo-
cracce, and are distinguished by the elegance of
the caste of Vere de V. And their habits are
conspicuous by a mild and soft repose—save for
the frenzied antics of the man in woman’s clothes.
And, excepting for the fact that, ’mid the
evening dews and damp, one who props his devious
footsteps with a mouldy cotton gamp, and
whose legs suggest some crooked place where
the spiral corkscrew grows, makes love to
the aforesaid man in the aforesaid clothes.
And a military person with a figure long and lank
desires to hug him lovingly upon a grassy bank.
Still, the comedy in general is filling to the soul,
and, only for the absence of Uncle Oattermole, it
might be even better than that comedy of yore
where the boneless curate leaveth bis goloshes on
the floor. The company is uneven, and one im-
ported dude should be assailed with eggs by an
indignant multitude. But otherwise the story,
like a sparkling river, goes, and a thrilling in-
stitution is that man in woman’s clothes.
* *■ * *
Messrs. Gourlay and Walton’s pantomime
at Sydney Royal improves considerably on a more
enlarged acquaintance. Some of the beauties,
which were formerly lost in the confusion, begin
to emerge and more definitely assert themselves,
and the loveliness of the transformation-scene
grows upon the audience, and the procession of
English kings and queens, which can’t get any
better owing to the badness of the material, at
least manages not to get any worse. Still, if this
item could be cut out and replaced by a grand
march of famous murderers, each carrying bis un-
buried victim in his arms, or by a procession of
fraudulent bankers, or by a great review of ghosts,
devils, absconding bankrupts, prominent drunk-
ards, hangmen and bushrangers, it would be a
relief. Australia doesn’t take so profound an
interest in British kings and queens as the Royal
management seems to imagine.
* * * *
Coogee Aquarium the establishment
where the Blue Groper resides —has a holiday
Srogrammeof about 240 items, includingPunchand
udy, snakeobarming, performing fleas, palmistry,
a minstrel show, concert, farce, ventriloquists,
and a string band. That infant phenomenon,
Phyllis Perrier, is on next Sunday’s programme.
This year’s pantomime at Melb. Princess’s
is the ghost of last year’s ditto at Sydney Lyceum,
retrirnmed and altered in sundry places. Its
furtive attempts to tell the story of Red Riding
Hood constitute a gross insult to childhood. A
man in black satin smalls, a swallow-tailed scarlet
coat, and the face of a prehistoric hairy animal, is
supposed to be a fox in league with the wolf. The
wolf is also a hopeless case, whilst the grand-
mother he threatens to devour is left out of the
cast. Seeing that some trouble is taken to make a
purely idiotic narrative, it would probably have
been worth while to turn out a faint suggestion of
the nursery legend. Serious stupidity is a sheer
waste of space in any form of entertainment.
Elsewhere the show is more entertaining than
the average Xmas medley. A Sports Pro-
cession, including animated cricket-bats and
other implements of recreation, is a pleas-
ing, although a slightly tedious, novelty,
depending for humour on the occasional collapse
of a cricket-bat or the eccentric behaviour
of a billiard-ball, which will, perchance, lose its
way and require a fairy’s kindly aid. Caiecedo,
the wire-dancer, is another unduly elaborated
item, outlasting the astonishment be creates.
Caiecedo is, properly speaking, a bounder on the
wire, using it as a spring in turning somersaults
and landing upon one foot if necessary. He puts
himself into a pair of jack-boots and repeats the
whole of his business with the same neatness as
before. A wonderful but monotonous performer,
not half as amusing as Wainwratta, the droll dude
who (with flesh-coloured tights under his dress-
suit) used to stroll along the wire shedding gar-
ments one at a time until at last he stood shiver-
ing in his shirt. There is nothing of the mad wag
about Caiecedo.

Dame Courtneidge forms the leading
comic element and chief reminder that a panto-
mime is happening. He is an elderly female with
an eagle eye that takes in the situation at a
glance. He conducts a riotous infant school, sings
the only songs that catch on, and seems to have
definite ideas as to what he is about. Some of the
other men are sadly wanting in this particular.
Miss Violet Varley, in scarlet cloak, is prettily
paired off with Jennie Lee, but, whereas Violet
makes the most of some feeble ballads, Jennie’s
lively ditties get lost in her upper register. Miss
Ethel Haydon warbles concerning the roses which
bloom, a subject that has fairly earned a
rest. Miss Rosie Nott puts in a bright
and festive appearance, but she, like several
other nice visions, is seldom called upon
to express her feelings. Miss Mary Weir’s mystic
whirl and D’Argo’s fascinating pas are thankfully
received ; also the chorus effects, arranged on
operatic principles, abound in sweetness and lime-
light, and the public attendance for the past week
may be described as splendid,

At the little Gaiety Theatre they have
■ventured upon a pantomime burlesque. James
Wilkingon and Miss Amy Johns head a small
company in H. J. Byron’s witty old version of
“Cinderella,” and a miniature transformation
scene, likewise a glittering fairy coach with ponies
attached, are displayed with reckless indifference
to the cost of such luxuries.

Maggie Moore is the beginning, end, and
most of the middle portion of “Sinbad the Sailor,”
at Melbourne Royal. For some three or four
years past Miss Maggie has been steadily grow-
ing younger. Just now she is so exceptionally
youthful and full of infectious “go” that the
pantomime, after being handicapped by a poor
start, is making a bold effort to get level with her.
The show is urged on, lured on, and pulled on by
Maggie Moore, whenever it needs a friend.
Premier Patterson’s infantile scheme for manu-
facturing “loyalty” was an unexpected stroke of
luck for the Royal, inasmuch as its chief scenic suc-
cess is a panorama of the Duke of York’s wedding,
painted by Grist from pictures in English illus-
trated papers. The subject, of course, is harrow-
ing to every well-regulated mind, but the
panorama is pretty, and Patterson has advertised
it at Government expense. Miss Isabel Webster’s
voice is another charming feature, some variety
business chips in opportunely, and Martin Hagan,
who met with gallery opposition on Boxing Night,
seems to do very well in a good part. Leumane
gets an encore for requesting Australia to Ad-
vance. Also here, as at the Princess’, there are
many precocious children, and hordes of banner-
bearing supernumeraries addicted to coming and
going in the time-honoured pantomime style.

Dan Barry, who has often talked of giving
his travelling melodramas a little metropolitan
experience, produced “Ransom,” at Melbourne
Alexandra, last Saturday week. The Haleck is a
proverbially ill-fated house, but if the present
management cannot drag affairs right along to a
successful issue fate must be very sick indeed.
At less than half of ordinary prices, Barry stages
a capable, smart-looking company in a somewhat
lavish manner. Two or three of the backgrounds
are cheerful bits of painting. Also, a fair-sized
orchestra performs lively music in tune, and the
general appearance of the venture is businesslike.
It is surprising to find so much care bestowed on
a mere shilling shocker. “ Ransom ”is a furious
absurdity in five acts, introducing two corpses
and a good deal of live _ horse. Although
the story has been located in “ bygone bush-
ranging days ” it admits of modern reference to
Carbine’s Cup, and the patriotism of Miss Dora
Mostyn, as an angelic bush urchin, is quite up to
date. Flourishing a stockwhip, Miss Dora (the
Jennie Lee of the piece) declares that Australian
boxers, Australian trees, cricketers, sheep, miners,
butter, frozen meat and sporting men (!!) are each
and all of them the noblest works of God. The
average British hero, raving about his country’s
Flag, is a modest, retiring person by comparison
with this golden-haired boy. Apart from a balder-
dash plot and clap-traps for the gallery “Ransom”
is a pleasant affair. The acting all round is so far
from being barnstormy that the company might
raise their voices without doing any damage to the
roof. Their quiet naturalism is rather too quiet for
the Haleck’s acoustic properties. J. P. Oathcart
and Prank Cates, who have been specially engaged
for villainy business, both die dreadful deaths. Two
Eromising young men are J. G. Patten and D. L.
lalziel, well balanced by Miss Eugenie Duggan
and Miss Ida Gresham. Miss Duggan has learnt
to moderate her enthusiasm since she Julieted at
the Theatre Royal, a while back, and Miss Gresham
requires only a little more confidence and voioe-
traming to make her an excellent ingenue. Dan
Barry and Miss Sydney walk through superflu-
ous parts in an easy manner ; the rest of the cast
being mostly bandits, who pin the aoe of clubs
over their victim’s heart for pistol - practice.
“Ransom” has confirmed first night opinions by
drawing big houses all through Xmas week, and
it is still flourishing.

One night during his triumphant “Silver
King” season at Melbourne Princess’ Walter
Bentley was suddenly taken so very ill that he
forgot his lines and sat speechless on a garden
seat. They gave him his cue several times to no
purpose, and finally Wilfrid Denver made a hur-
ried departure, leaving the rest of the scene to
take care of itself. Miss Henrietta Watson then
came to the rescue, accompanied by little Cissie.
“Which way did the kind gentleman go?” said
Miss Watson to Oissie, who, as a matter of fact,
had never seen the kind gent., because he col-
lapsed before the interview with his cheeild should
have come off. “ That way, mamma,” said Cissie,
the adroit fibber, pointing to the back of the
stage, whereas Walter had really made his exit
at the o.p. side. “Go and bring him back!”
shouted Miss Watson to the aged Jaikes. For-
tunately the play makes out that Silver King
catches the train for London at this moment, and
before his next “call” came, Bentley was suffi-
ciently recovered to resume operations.

The late Henry Pettitt was essentially a
playwright. He devised melodramatic plots and
filled in the fustian dialogue, looking to his colla-
borates to draw character sketches and complete
a stage story which the scenic artist, assisted by a
clever mechanist, might make a presentable job
of. In his early days Pettitt partnered Paul
Merritt in dozens of blood-and-thunder dramas of
the old “transpontine” school, suitable for audi-
ences who mostly sat in their shirt-sleeves and
brought bags of nuts with them. The villains of
these plays had to be paid a little extra on account
of the awful risks they ran, after trying to choke
the heroine in the third act. It was not unusual
for a stone ginger-beer bottle to catch the villain
napping and lay him up for a fortnight.
At Poverty Point.
Here is virtue, if you like. The other night, just before
Mary Weir began her Serpentine at Melb. Princess’, a
lady and gentleman ostentatiously walked out of the
theatre—and walked in again when it was over.
The early-donr racket has been played at Melb. Prim
cess’, during this pinto, season, in a way rather irritating
to the economic. The amphitheatre is advertised at Is.
but the 2s. door only is open till the overture begins. To
be sure, the expenses are vast, and there has been a
genuine rush to take advantage of. The panto, would be
good right up to Easter, but for the necessity of having
a pretty-well-crowded house nightly to make ends meet.
Interprovincial ill-feeling is likely to arise out of the
fact of Sydney getting Bartho for the pantomime-time.
Brough and Boucioault, who did splendid busi-
ness in Tasmania, extol Launceston audiences as amongst
the most discriminative they have ever faced. The
Hohartians were delighted wdth the co., which gave them
a new play every night. The season was the most memor-
able in Tasmanian theatrical annals.
Inasmuch as a Melb. Herald leaderette of last week
recommended the constant reader to go three or four
times to see the D’Argo and Mary Weir pantomime, it is

Sylvia Grey (her real name is Susan Wickett) has
captured a rich husband, a Mr. Fenwick, who is described
indifferently as an Australian and an American. I believe
he paid a visit to Australia some few years ago, says The,
Bulletin’s London correspondent.
Brough and Boucioault have been offering £4O a week
to an English actress, to play Mrs. Tanqueray, in Aus-
tralia.
Julia Neilson and Fred Terry are coming to Australia,
and it is hardly too much to assume they will be the Mrs.
Tanqueray people. Neilson almost carries the prestige
of that Adelaide of yore, who perished so miserably in
Paris, and was laid out on the slab of the morgue. Julia’s
first big jjJunge was the “ Dancing Girl.”
Isabel Webster shunts from the concert-hall into the
Melb. Royal Panto., and, like everyone else, declares she

J. Sheridan, Widow O’Brien, has been engaged to play
the part of the second Mrs. Block, wife of the absurdly
impossible Yankee in “Christopher Columbus." Sims is-
writing a part for him, which is to make Lonnen sit up.
There is more real cleverness in Sheridan’s little finger,
than in Lonnen’s whole body.
Pattie Browne has followed the fortunes of “ The
Other Fellow" to the Strand from the Court, and acts,
says The Bulletin's London correspondent, with, if
possible, greater piquancy than ever.
Melb. Age, in an article regretting the financial non-
success of the late Italian opera season, refers to the
musical enthusiasm of Milan, where, “ a few da.\s prior to
the first performance of Verdi’s ‘ Falstaff,’ one found the
whole city in a state of almost feverish excitement about
the new opera; peop.e thought of nothing else, talked of
nothing else.” Which is all-very sweet and soulful from
a musical gusher’s point of view. But whilst Italy thinks
of nothing but new operas, the country grows more
poverty-stricken every day, and pretty soon the national
mind wall be concentrated upon the question of how to
live happily on nothing a year.
Many of the costumes in this year's panto, at Melb.
Royal are doing duty for the third successive time (with-
out reckoning a season at Her Majesty’s, Sydney), and
still look well. They were among the splendid lot that
George Coppin’s agent bought from Mrs. Langtry—a
wonderfully cheap line of goods, as time has proved.
The voices of W. and M.’s new-Btyle opera co. made but
a poor effect in “Faust,” where the solo singing is all
powerful. Not one of the four principals could approach
(vocally) the best of Simonsen's importations in his or her
particular character.

The following epistle has been received at this office..
It is signed “Aim6e Moore Dear Editor,—Perhaps
you will allow me as the person most concerned to settle-
the questions which have lately agitated your corres-
pondents. Some people have insinuated that I am nob.
equal to Bernhardt, but then they were not judges, just,
as those who suggested that my beauty is not more
transcendental than Mary Anderson’s were bound to see-
crooked. And to those who suggest, I am too slight II
would say that I have an elbow people come miles to see,.
In the same way those persons who whisper that my,
wardrobe is not so complete as that of Mrs, Potter must,
know that the couple of millions I recently realised at,

The term “Her Majesty's servants” is still (or was;
until quite recently) applied to the companies at Drury
Lane and Covent Garden theatres. The shows at those-
two old-established houses enjoy the meaningless privilege:
of being authorised by Royal Letters Patent, or, in some-
other equally vague and musty manner, they are supposed
to be different from ordinary theatrical performances.
Also, a couple of British grenadiers are (or were) told off
every evening to act as sentinels at the principal entrance,
and fight for Her Majesty’s servants if necessary.
You must blame “Tay Pay" O’Connor, of London
Star, if this is a lie. Beatrice Battenberg is very much
up to date as regards music-hall songs, and she adores
Chevalier’s cosier ditties. She plays selections for “Ma”
after dinner, and the eldest Battenberg boy is permitted
to put his granny to sleep chortling “ Knocked ’em in the
Old Kent Road.”
Lord Sholto Douglas, youngest son of the (newly re-
married) Marquis of Queensberry, is a veritable chip of
the old block. Recently he had a fair go-in at a music-
hall at Sandgate, and it took three policemen to look him
up. He had been pouring liquor from the dress-circle
upon the heads of the people below, and was fined £2.
Beerbohm Tree, says The Bulletin's London corres-
pondent, is to revive “Captain Swift” when the

one of Tree’s favourite parts, and many think his best.
Chambers has never explained, by the bye, how a squatter
managed to have so much cash about him, as shearers are
usually paid by cheque. Following the bushranger will;
come a play by Buchanan, and then Haddon Chambers,
will have another show with the play I have already told
you of, to which he has given the provisional title of
“The Lovers”—a capital name, too—which is to be
something ultra intense.

846 Macquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
January 3, 1894,
My Dear Moorabinda—
A Block spectacle in Sydney on New Year
Saturday morning was a couple of —I pause here
for a badly-missing word ; but, let us say, skipping
infants—who made the whole street stand aghast.
One was 16 and well-developed and wore a pink
dress cut d la “My Sweetheart,” showing nine-
tenths of her stockings and surmounted by a pink
sun-bonnet —but Elsie Cameron in the Panto-
mime is an ordinary schoolgirl to the other one.
Her dress was high above her boots, too—a
white dress peppered with black spots like un-
cooked plum-duff and fitting loosely over an Elsie
Caiqeron figure above the waist-belt. This infan-
tile array culminated in a white-frilled sun-bonnet
from which peered forth the visage of a woman of
over 20 ! The spectacle the two presented (they
had somebody representing “Nursey” along) was
absolutely paralysing. It looked as if the apos-
trophised mamma in “ Make me a child again ”
had come back and inserted her elderly daughter
into a sun-bonnet as per request. Also, they re-
minded me of the giant babes at Her Majesty’s
out for an airing. Even the newsboys’ breath
was taken away by the spectacle, and there wasn’t
a man on the Block who, so to speak, didn’t know
those girls’ legs by heart in half-an-hour.
p suppose we owe the variety-stage another for
this wondrous sight. An old-young girl goes and
sees the actress who she knows is over forty
looking something sooner than eleven in open-
work socks and pinafore, and she conceives a
stupid idea of carrying out the wrinkle on the
Block! And some people do it successfully.
Gracie Whiteford, for instance, looked like a little
girl, even in the street, where she always dressed
in short frocks. A couple of variety sisters whom
you see occasionally in the street keep up the
baby game rather cleverly—but such tricks are
only possible to the round - featured, slender
woman. The charmer of fourteen-stun must never
buy a sunbonnet and a smock frock, and hope to
be admired as a fine child by any responsible
critic.
I am told that that other legal youth of baritone
voice, well-known in Melbourne and Sydney
“ best society,” who has thrown his brief-bag sky-
high and will shortly bid for footlight fame,
will make his maiden professional effort in the
land of wooden hams. It is also said that the
open-mouthed admiration of his gifts expressed
by the late Fred Leslie is responsible for the mis-
chief. I only hope he won’t have to transpose
the Lyceum ’mime chant into “ 0 Mr. Leslie,
what have you done for me?” after he’s once
adopted grease-paint.
The departure of the squadron from Sydney the
other Friday was a solemn affair. Very few ad-
mirers rushed out to the Heads to see the iron-
clads steam steadily over the heaving tide,
seeking out a cool spot to summer in—Hobart
this time. A faithful few, egged on by the mer-
curial Major-General and Mrs. Hutton, were
gathered together in the military reserve at South
Head to watch the farewell signals ; but the im-
pressiveness of the ocean tableau was spoilt by a
boat-load of Ohinamen, who placidly fished all the
time the warships were slowly filing past. Six
Chinamen in the middle-distance would ruin an
epic.
There are whole oceans of spectacle in “Beauty
and the Beast” at Sydney Lyceum, and the person
who is obliged, for reasons of space, to boil the
whole panorama down into a mere simmer of
approbation, should plunge at once into admira-
tion points over Nellie Stewart’s Marguerite dress,
in which Beauty cuts the sort of piquant figure
that gets on to the cover of a French society print.
The gown is in Marguerite colours—gold and
white the jaunty satin skirt, trimmed with
festoons of white lace and fans of golden tinsel,
the seams outlined in jewelled gimp; gold tinsel
in the hair, golden slippers and a golden gamp.
But the new thing about the dress is that it is
lined in black, and when lifted reveals pink-blue
petticoats. A horrible idea strikes the spectator
when those petticoats are first revealed—that
Nellie is going to peel down to them in full view
of the stalls, but she doesn’t. A grey silk smock
and Greenaway cap make Beauty look fourteen
in the first act, when she is surrounded by gold,
green and red infants, who reminded me, by the
way, of the fate of the youngsters who teased a
dyer, with the result that their victim caught a
handful of them one day, dipped them, clothes
and all, into the dye-vats and then let them loose
a covey of red, blue and purple bantlings—as a
warning for the rest.
A ribbon gown, long, razor-strop-looking tags
of cream satin faked with gold and separating
over four-o’clock-ooloured tights; a smart pink
hunting dress and a web-like, golden-starred
gauze over cream tights, were Nellie Stewart’s
most gorgeous other gowns. The Prince was in
coffee-colour taffeta and terra-cotta satin glitter-
ing with jewels and topped by a pink satin hat;
but the neat Miss Young appeared most kissable
in the grey satin bicycle suit and cap which she
carried very smartly. An inherently-neat woman
always looks unhappy with her hat hanging on
her ear, which is the principal objection to Miss
Young in the sea-gull suit and the wedding
glories inevitable in the last act. May Pollard’s
Fairy Queen, in pink-and-grey silk and gauze,
was a well-dressed Titania, even if the colours
rather reminded you of a rosella parrot; and
Lauri, in a travelling-rug, wore a red necktie
round his bared gullet, looking for all the world
as if the gifted oomique had severed his jugular.
Talking of the principals’ dresses Nellie
Stewart hasn’t an understudy for Beauty, so, if
anything happens to Nellie the management will be
reduced to the necessity of giving ’Amlet without
the Ghost, so to speak. W. and M. wouldn’t go
to the expense of duplicating the heroine’s radiant
raiment, and as the star won’t let any perspiring
imitator wear her frocks —not if she knows it —
the situation remains as stated. But it strikes me
that a really shrewd manager would make it a
point in the signed articles that the leading lady
temporarily forfeits her purple and fine linen to
an understudy whenever she cannot appear her-
self. The average actress would go on for 52
weeks if she felt there was a possible r-r-r-rival
waiting to jump her low-cut corsage and her fan-
tail frock. But women everywhere are spikey
about their wardrobes. The culminating point
of feminine friendship is when Darnonida lends
Pythiana her best spring bonnet.
The eggshell Mdlle Bartho, like the red-haired
Sarah, “no speakee Ingleese,” and it is a terrible
affliction for the local jeunesse doree to try and
make tender insinuations per medium of the
sheep - dog which accompanies Mademoiselle,
and superintends her in five languages.
Where is the bold, bad man who could possibly
carry out his nefarious schemes through
an interpreter and that interpreter the
maiden’s chaperone to boot? Bartho, herself, has
the advantage of being able to talk with her
whole graceful form and twinkling “ silver pedes-
tals,” as the Easterns call a woman’s feet —bub
the feeble Johnny, in wide pants and a glass eye,
whose ideas, even in English, only come to the
surface after long pauses of mental grappling—
cannot hope to express his absorbing passion by
chopping meaningly about on his large tan feet.
So there is no hope but the polygot Cerberus.
By the way, Bartho wears nary a di’mond, I
notice.
The most bewitching costume into which Bartho
inserted herself in the ’mime was her white tulle
ballet-frock with gold-spangled corsage and two
perky little butterfly wings jutting out at exactly
the right moment from her dimpled vertebrae. A
yellow silk and black lace turn-out with black and
gold Bolero jacket worn in the Spanish dance was
characteristic, and so was a Russian get-up of pale-
blue satin designed in gold, and crimson velvet coat
edged with brown fur, a smart cap and top boots
and spurs ; also, a blue-and-white satin sailor suit,
in which she condescended to do a very British-
sailor-like hornpipe in the fastest time on record,
comes into the same category—but I really must
protest against those blue-satin breeches. Any
garment that conceals the twinkling tibia, so to
speak, of the symmetrical Bartho is obviously
over-doing its earthly mission. By the way, on
the first time, one of Bartho’s silvery spurs shot
off into the orchestra. The reserved stalls never
have any luck.
In a whirl of life-like butterflies, brown bats,
demons, fairies, pages and ladies draped in Judson
hues of spangled gauze over fleshings long-drawn-
out, one pounces upon the stately upholstery of
the procession of Nations at Sydney Lyceum—
every yard straight from ’Ome —and you can’t
help thinking how lucky it is that all the powers
revel in National colours that harmonise so well
when they come together. I like the_ Indian
dresses best —the filmy diaphonies flashing with
fire-fly jewels, and the bizarre topping off —the
upper half of an elephant’s head in ele-
phant grey. France was a mingling cf airy
tri-colour silks and wreaths of laurel; Ger-
many (one looks at the standard-bearer, by the
way, for the most frills) in white satin and black
plumes, and a long white velvet cloak designed
in black “tri-antelopes,” apparently. Turkey
was barbaric in green, cream, crimson and gold—
all the colours of a swell narghili—and came on
led by a very well-supported officer in dark-blue
and a fez. Britain’s cloak was the British
standard over a large white satin lady who waved
the flag without-an-allnsion-to-which-no-melo-
drama-is-complete, and was backed up by several
pale-green silk and emerald-clad sylphs copiously
trimmed with ich dien feathers who looked highly
artistic. Indeed, the most monotonous thing
about the March of Nations at Chicago was the
sumptuousness of the dressing. If Spam had
only been trying to hide a patch on its trousers
or Austria seemed conscious of odd boots, the
audience wouldn’t have felt so sun-struck. A
shower of gold is sometimes as unhealthy for the
man without an umbrella as a shower of bricks.
The feature—from my point of view—of the
“Royal Middy,” at Sydney Opera House, was
Edward Farley’s neck. From a gorgeous satin
collar, left loose a long way down —it undulated
like the frontal aspect of a wax doll, and must
have made half the ladies on the stage green with
envy. Miss Colbourne Baber wore a very modest
suit of blue and crimson satin and gold embroidery
as the middy (a prima-donna who teaches young
ladies how to warble in her disengaged moments
has to be particular), but the inexpressibles were
a little too voluminous, giving the effect of a mer-
maiden’s tail. However, Miss Baber’s pink silk
dress became her admirably. The athletic Willie
Walshe was gorgeous in rainbow silk and lace as
the King, and the best dress Miss Moore wore as
the Queen was a white satin robe with a court
train of blue velvet edged with ermine. At least,
that’s how I sized up the regal garment, but I
have no documentary evidence to prove that it
was ermine. Still there is no more incongruity
in calling a yard or so of Tom-cat “regal fur”
than in alluding to some cotton-back chorus-girl
as an empress. It’s all “ staige ” glamour, I
suppose.
Somebody at ’Ome has been interviewing a
wonderful spot-stroke billiardist who said, inter
alia, that women are taking to the game much
more than they used to do, and that many would
be lured on to the green cloth if they could only
be taught by one of their own sex. “ I hope my
little girl will go on playing,” said the man of
cues, “for I see in it a handsome income for her.
Here is a new occupation for women which is
not overcrowded.”
Bub surely billiards can never become a she-
game—there are too many awful possibilities about
where the next stroke is to be reached from to
make a feminine diversion. Imagine a fat woman
sprawling half over the table (as we used to see
Roberts on ladies’ day) poking at a ball in the
exact centre ! No short-legged charmer would
play billiards decently without a step-ladder
either —no matter how high her heels were. There
is no need for a sharp, nerveful woman to take to
billiards. She could earn quite as much at scien-
tific card-playing, especially if she were pretty
and had shapely hands, also a diamond ring or
two and an unsuspected genius for solo-whist.
The engagement is announced of pretty Miss
Ethel Pilcher, eldest daughter of Mr. 0. E. Pil-
cher, Q.C., of Sydney, to Mr. Jay, who hails from
England.
The feature of the Rignold-Huenerbein sacred
concert, at Sydney Her Majesty’s on Xmas night,
was certainly the fiddling of M, Henri Staell—a
nervo-fibrous person who stands on the stage like
a man getting his sea-legs and who reminds you
of Riccardi starved down to nine “ stun,” Mons.
Staell (lately from Paris) plays with everything
but fire. In a tempestuous finale he fades away
like a Cup favourite at the finish, but in quick,
bird-like movements and dainty pizzicati he is
indeed a ourly-haired fiddler, besides always play-
ing with appropriate expression. Kowalski
accompanied the hero in concerto. By the way,
when Kowalski is effacing himself instrumentally
he moves his hand on the piano like a cat crossing
a wet patch.
Apropos of music, a full-length picture o*
Madame Amy Sherwin, the Tasmanian Nightin"
gale, is published in a ’Ome society paper*
_“ Madame ’’Sherwin is represented standing up,
in a do-or-die attitude, with a dagger in her back-
hair and a white feather fan, and, in a column of
praise appended to the picture, you learn that she
lives at St. John’s Wood, in a house crowded with
“ mementoes.”
On the word of a leading actress at present
drawing the enchanted multitude at an Australian
theatre, I have it that the front-row stalls in—to
put it expansively—Australia are not now what
they were in the dear days lang syne. The indict-
ment is that the front-row is no gentleman. If
the performer near the footlights isn’t to their
liking, they simply converse affably with one
another, laugh and chat with careless gaiety until
somebody comes on who pleases them, when they
listen patronisingly, with a re-assuring smirk.
However, I have watched a typical front stall
soaring out in the intervals to get a breath of air,
and I can hardly imagine anybody but a chorus-
girl taking any of them seriously, even if they
began to snore with their mouths open in the
middle of an aria. For they are obviously the
legal prey of the girl with the kohl-soaked eye-
balls, the double-barrelled wink, and the brief,
gauzy garment who carries a banner in the front
row, and if they wither like flowers that are wait-
ing for the rain during exits, I think the principals
should be very patient with them.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.
“The Bulletin’s” Missing Word
Competition, No. 9.
The above competition closed with 1884 sub-
scribers, making a total of <£94 4s. There were
seven successful guesses, and the dividend is con-
sequently £l3 9s. 2d. Two speculative families,
which sent in several dozen coupons, gathered in
no less than five out of the seven prizes. The
missing word was “Thanksgiving.” Most of the
competitors, however, pinned theirfaith to “Jubi-
lation,” and there was also a considerable run
upon “Joy,” “Hilarity,” and “Exultation.”
One erratic theorist speculated his shilling on
“Buckjumping,” and another festive person re-
garded “Boozing” as a word that would be in

Mayor Manning, of Sydney, knighted,
and not millionaire Sydney Burdekin! Mr.
Manning’s bauble, is, of course, a social, not a
political decoration. Burdekin’s vigorous mayoral
and other appeals to the stomachs of the distant
great should have touched their hearts; but
Manning has probably reached a still more vulner-
able point, their purses, for he has long been, and
still is, the trusted financial representative in
Sydney of such estates as those of Rosebery and
Sherbrooke. Mayor Manning’s public farewell
oration to Gov. Jersey is an historical piece of
adulation. Somebody should look it up and have
it pasted in every State school as a model for the
good little boy who hopes to become a knight.
At a recent Bundaberg (Q.) Ministerial
“guzzle,” Attorney-General Byrnes, responding
for “ The Ministry,” spoke on the coloured labour
sugar industry question. “The late Govt, had
rescinded many acts of legislation erroneously
carried out in the past. . . . But a revolution
of feeling may come, and ‘ we ’ have endeavoured
to place the roots of this industry so deep into
the soil that no Government put into power by
a temporary wane of feeling can possibly uproot
it.” A. J. Thynne, M.L.C., then arose and
assured his audience (mostly planters and their
“ tobies ”): “ That in view of revulsion of feeling,
we are now bringing into force a system of elec-
tion to the Second Chamber that will provide a
check for hasty legislation. I am one of the
youngest members of that House, but I am look-
ing on and learning.” Let Democratic Australia
“look cn and learn ’’what elective Second Cham-
bers are meant to do. In vino veritas /
The Adelaide Hbvenink Journal starts
its narrative of the Oxley murders with half-a-
column of big, black headlines about the toma-
hawk and other horrid details. Then it girds up
its bloodstained loins and wades in to the extent
of seven columns. A few Cobbloquent extracts :
For awful unexpectedness, unpremeditatedness, dia-
bolical execution, and for fearful results, the tragedy
which occurred in Adelaide on Christmas morning has no
equal in the annals of crime in South Australia, or, per-
haps, in Australia. . . . Oxley came out in a night-
shirt and a pair of pants, but whether he had any boots
on was not known. He was evidently in a depressed
condition. ... He was a happy lad of ten years
old. The right side of the head lay exposed, and a
sheet covered the body. One foul blow with the back
of the tomahawk crashed the skull, spattered the room
with blood, scattered the child’s brains on the floor, and
left no trace of his features free from blood and brains
which streamed all over the pillow-case. The little
fellow’s hands lay peacefully on his chest. . . . Going
through the door the man would see his wife calmly
sleeping with her hands on her bosom, her legs slightly
drawn up, and the bedclothes thrown off on account of
the heat of the night. . . . Then the axe fell
again . . . rendering the head a shapeless mass. The
brains streamed out, blood flooded the place, and an
artery threw the red fluid far up the wall. . , . One
little innocent rested near the edge of the bed . . the
brains protruded and the force knocked her out of the bed
on to the floor. Her sister . . . got the blow on the
right side, her skull being also opened and the brains ex-
posed. He himself was left amid a scene of wreck to
survey his diabolical w’ork. . . . His life-blood dripped
down to the floor mingled with those of his daughters.
It splashed on to the floor as the clocks in the house
ticked out the seconds of his life. ... In two rooms
the life-giving fluid had drenched walls and floors with a
shower ... an unshapely mass of brains, clotted hair
and crushed bone . . . so crushed was the skull it
was difficult to distinguish the pillow from the head
. . . “ Mind the blood and brains,” courteously said
the constable ... It smelt of blood . . . His
naked feet pattering through the warm blood
his life oozed through the gash in his neck ... a red
bath of blood . . . blood . . . brains . , .
gore . . . crushed bones ... he saw a girl on
the floor scratching herself . . . red blotches . .
brains . . . protruding brains . . . shattered
brains . . . tragedy . . . unexampled horror

Ex-Gov. Onslow’s elocution is declared by

Reporter John Rider once missed an

There is a delicious story current re the
conversational ambush whereby Parkes, when in
Adelaide recently, ridded himself of an intrusive
clerical bore. Like most Parkesian anecdotes, it
is unprintable; but, as every N.S Wales M.P.
knows it and will tell his wife, the yarn is guar-

Maoriland Premier Seddon is but a

There is at least one exception to the rule
laid down that Australian knights have invariably
fallen from democratic grace through wifely per-
suasion. Thomas Elder, G.0.M.G., of Adelaide,
is a bachelor of between 70 and 80 years standing.
On the other hand, had not Mr. Way, the S. A.

it is probable that long ere this the brand of Im-

Colonel Boyle Travers Finniss, the first
Premier of S.A., under Constitutional Govern-
ment, died in Adelaide on Christmas Eve, aged
86. He came to the province in 1836 as assistant-
surveyor, and helped Colonel Light to survey the
city of Adelaide. So completely forgotten was he
when he died that his funeral only attracted
mourners enough to fill four vehicles. And, yet,
once —from Dec. 20, 1854, to June 8, 1855—he was
Administrator of the Government!
At Tonga, recently, a discharged officer
used indecent and insulting language to the king,
at whom he fired three ineffectual shots. Next
day, however, ho called at the palace and apolo-
gised, and the king having accepted the apology
the incident closed. Tonga isn’t much of a
kingdom, and its potentate is a very small digni-
tary, but there are the elements of a man and a
brother about the king, small or large, who will
accept an apology after having been missed three
times with a gun.
Archbishop Murphy, of Hobart, had a
desolate Xmas. While he was at Ballarat in re
the consecration of his priestly brother Delaney,
some ruthless blackguard raided the archepiscopal
stye and laid sacrilegious hands on one of the two
pigs—which they were fattening agin the 25th
December, that due honour might be paid to the
Star of Bethlehem. The robber slew the sacred
animal on the spot, and left naught behind him
save some bootmarks and a big clot of pigly gore.
This outrage has made the blood of Tasmania run
cold, Murphy’s pig having gone, whose pig is
safe ?
Premier Dibbs’ tendency to retail Scrip-
tural variabilia is said to be the outcome of a
literary and oratorical ambition. When much
younger his style in speech and writing was
adversely criticised, and Stuart (afterwards Pre-
mier) recommended a study of the Bible for the
simplicity, purity, and eloquence of its diction.
That recommendation Dibbs followed awhile, and
the bizarre jumbles of Scriptural phrasing and
allusion to which N.S.W. Parliament' and public
are now so frequently treated result from the
application of a secular mind to religious records
in pursuit of effective diction.
Some years ago, when those distinguished
Radical politicians, Gordon and Cockburn, were
on a visit to Sydney, they stayed at the Reform
Club. Their bedroom was only divided by a par-
tition from the room occupied that night by the
late “Jack” Robertson. The Adelaide visitors
promptly cleared out of the Reform Club next
morning. They had not slept one wink, for old
“Jack” Robertson, the whole night through, had
never ceased swearing in his dreams at the blanky
blank dashy dash miserable little “ Cabbage Gar-
den.” Honest in his hates, as in his likings, the
ancient had to curse the “ Cabbage Garden ” even
in his sleep !

other night, finding himself still alive, despite his

“And now, my friends, tell me, why have I not
been struck dead?” “Because,” replied an
earnest Christian just outside the radius of the

What has become of the projected Sydney
Daily Post ?
Premier Nelson (Q.) has also gone on a
pilgrimage to Maoriland —with the intention of
studying what to avoid.
At the Isis scrub (Q.), certain free kanakas
lately struck against a wages-reduction, and their
places were instantly supplied by a gang of mean
whites.
Dibbs, cursing the “colonial party,” per
Westminster Gazette, says the “colonies” don’t
want meddlers. Is Dibbs opposed to imported
Governors ?
Ebenezer Ward, M.L.C., succeeds Baker
as leader of the National Ass party in S.A. Legis-
lative Council. Ward is a born leader—of any
ass party.
A large number of N.S.W. Civil servants
have only to thank the bankrupt condition of the
Superannuation Fund for thei r continuance in
their situations.
S.A. revenue for last half-year of ’93—
£1; 103,172, an increase (over last half of ’92) of
£47,826; but receipts fall short of the Treasury
estimate by £203,365.
Cabled that a shipment of Australian eggs
sent to England per Britannia arrived in rotten
condition. The N.S.W. elections are near. The
shipment should be returned instanter.
Premier Seddon lends “his enthusiastic
support” to Jingo B. Patterson’s proposal that
the Australian Governments unite in inviting
York and May to Australia. Seddon has lost his
Ballance.
Country Gentleman (Eng.) says that
Baron Oarington lost the vice-royalty of
by his former stupid public speeches abou c
“ Australia for the Australians, and Ireland for
the Irish.”
Henry Parkes says that his life has been
‘comparatively wasted.” No; “superlatively
wasted.” And that’s not the worst in this
particular matter. Parkes has contrived to also
waste some 40 years of the national life of N.S.
Wales.
W. B. Melville, Protectionist, Democrat,
&c., and formerly private secretary to N.S.W.
Premier Dibbs, now runs the Landowner, which
opposes payment of members and is the organ of
the N.S.W. Landowners’ League—whatever that
may be.
One Alderman Grose, candidate for Mar-
rickville (N.S.W.) at next election, boasts the
possession of a complete cure for poverty, but
will not reveal his secret till election time. £3OO
a year parliamentary salary is one complete cure
for poverty.
Premier Patterson says that the only way
to put the affairs of Victoria straight again is
to live on porridge and the Proverbs of Solomon.
It is Patterson’s misfortune that he looks a good
deal more like a man who lives on raw meat and
the Song of Solomon.
There is some doubt whether the approach-
ing S.A. Legislative Council elections will be
fought out on “progressive” or “direct” land-
tax lines. The progressive party is very strong in
the country, but in the city the direct taxers in-
clude the Labour-party.
The South Carolina liquor law continues
to work well. The licensed victuallers are bought
clean out, at fair market prices, and the State is
the sole grog-dealer. Real experts continue in the
trade, as salaried men, their interest being to sell
as little liquor ais possible.
Parkes is “a-lashin’ of his tail.” There
is one plumbless sea between the old fox and his
hated rival, Dibbs. Dibbs has committed one
crime for which there can be no forgiveness, no
mercy, either in time or in eternity. He has been
photographed with the Prince of Wales—and has,
so says rumour, derisively sent Parkes a copy of
the picture.
Thankfull Willmetfc is the name of the
Mcllwraithian candidate for Townsville (Q.), in
the election to fill the parliamentary seat made
vacant by the death of G. Burns. Thankf ull has been
Mayor of Townsville, and is in the stationery line.
As he is opposed by Anthony Ogden, whom
Burps only beat by one vote, he will probably re-
main stationary.
Said ex-Gov. Onslow in England recently:
■*lll6 new Maoriland Parliament consists of 40 men of
business, 6 journalists, and representatives of a number
of handicrafts^but,'even then, there are only 7 mechanics
to 80,000 wage-earners, and the 3000 professional men in
the province''are better represented than the 40,000
farmers.
The friendly javelin is more poisonous than the
foe’s claymore.
The Argus on the proposed visit of George
and May: “It would tend to enhance the im-
fortance of Australia in the eyes of the world.”
f they should come “ the volume of production
and business will be so increased that all Aus-
tralian investments will command the best prices.”
After this we must have George and May, even if
we have to kidnap them.
0. A. Lee’s adjournment coup is being
put forward by the political friends of that
N.S.W. legislator as ample qualification for a
portfolio in the first Freetrade administration.
The Mines is mentioned. To the question—what
does Lee know about mines?—the answer is
promptly given—what did Abigail and attorney
Slattery know about mines ?
Henry George cheers an Australian Single-
taxer by assuring him that “our time is surely
coming.” It is ominous that the only definite
item of fact in the same letter is that “ Moxhara
—Tom Johnson’s partner,” has given “ £5OOO for
backing Single-tax members of Congress.” At
Current U.S. rates that sum ought to induce
several members and a lot of voters.
Despite the huge franchise advantages
given by the Westralian electoral law to Fat Man
and his barnacles, it is thought that the next
elections (about May) will give the overshadowing
“ Six Families ” a pronounced set-back. Hardly
one electorate in the province will be uncontested.
The defeat of two or three Ministers (Lands and
Railways particularly) is regarded as assured.
The S.A. Assembly of 54 members can be
“ sectionised ” thus: —Ministers, 6; Opposition-
ists, 5; Labour members, 10 ; Independents, 9 ;
Country Party, 23; and the Speaker. Thus the
Country Party and the direct Opposition, when
combined, just command an absolute majority,
and once or twice during the session, notably on
the Land Values and the Factories Bills, the union
took place.
Of all fallen idols, none has come to such
hopeless smash as Graham Berry, once high priest,
so far as lip-service went, of Victorian Radicalism.
The other day, at his old stronghold, Geelong, the
ennobbled liberal attended a municipal festivity,
and was seen, bedraggled, perspiring, and utterly
baked, hustling for a place on the outskirts of the
crowd. Later on he attempted to address the
assemblage, but was howled down and scoffed at,
and resumed his seat looking very white and
flabbergasted. Altogether, Berry is a dreadful
example to the Australian politician who yearns
to be Sir Something, and to wear a foreign gew-
gaw on his chest.
Maoriland Oppo-
sition candidates
seem to have had
more than a fair share
of luck at the recent
elections. At Auck-
land, George Grey,
Independent, was re-
turned at the top of
the poll with 6372
votes. Another In-
dependent candidate
polled 2390, making a
total of 8762 votes
recorded for one In-
dependent candidate
elected. The two Op-
position candidates
standing polled be-
tween them 8793
votes, and both were
returned. The six
Ministerial candi-
dates polled a total of
13,075 votes, yet not
one of them got a
seat. In Wellington,
two Independents
polled between them
8579 votes, and one
(Stout, with 6200
votes) was returned
at the top of the poll.
The two Opposition
candidates polled
among them 10,580
votes, and both were
elected. There were
six Ministerial candi-
dates who polled be-
tween them 16,665
votes, and neither of
them found a seat.
Of the 13 members
representing the late
Opposition in the
M. Parliament,
four at least represent
slender minorities.
It must be gall
and wormwood to
N. S. W. Labour-mem-
bers that, under the
guise of friendly criti-
cism, a peer like ex-
Gov. Onslow can—
and, the sting of it
is, can truly— accuse
them of brilliant fail-
ure because they were
leaderless and dis-
united, as a contrast
to the triumphant
Maoriland Labour-
members, who “sel-
ected an experienced
parliamentary hand
as leader and threw
in their lot with the
advanced party.” If
the urgings of friends
have failed to inocu-
late "N.S.W. Labour
leaders with serpen-
tine wisdom, it may
be that the taunts of
an hereditary Tory
may enlighten their
vision.
Parkes, if he stands for St. Leonards, will,
in all human probability, be beaten by E. M.
Clark, honest bawling auctioneer. So it is
rumoured that, making a virtue of something
which closely borders upon necessity, the old man
will hold back his nomination and contest with
Premier Dibbs any seat the latter may select,
with a view to utterly shutting him out of
Parliament.
Judge Hensman’s departure for England
and improbable return to W.A. is regarded as
meaning the appointment of Attorney-General
Burt to a judgeship, with George Leake as sue-
ceeding A.G. The ennobbled George Shenton
hopes to be made Attorney-General, and the be-
baubled Lee Steere to become President of the
Legislative Council, his Assembly tenure being
easily frangible.
Premier Dibbs’followerscharge Barton with
having “sold them like a bnllock at Smithfield. ,,
They sought to make him retract his resignation
and arranged a Cabinet meeting to discuss with
him the exact form his retractation should take,
but he failed to attend, walked straight into the
House, and “ hurst the show.” They suspect him
of coquetting with Parkes with a view to a
Ministry whose ostensible raison d'etre will be
Federation.
Attorney-General Burt (W.A.) : When
a candidate comes along, ask him if he will sup-
port the Forrest Ministry, If he says ‘ Yes,
put him in ;if he says ‘ No,’ put him out.” This
is like Septimus Burt, Q.C. He talks to juries in
a similar fashion. “ I think so and so; in fact, I
don’t see how it could have been_ otherwise; there-
fore, I ask you to give a verdict in accordance
with my opinion.”
Sam Griffith, much improved in health, is
understood to be disgusted with the obscurity in
which his acceptance of a Judgeship has landed
him. He pines for activity, and, had_ he his own
way, would resign and re-enter Parliament. It
is doubtful, though, whether ho could now politi-
cally hold his own against “Tommy” Byrnes, or,
in these depressed times, make anything like his
present income at the bar.
The hollow mockery of Robert Reid’s
“mission” to England and America was put
beyond question as soon as he had sailed from
Melbourne. One of Reid’s mightiest undertak-
ings was to be the fixing up of things at the Agent-
General’s office for a long interregnum period, a
task that could easily be accomplished by a short
official letter and a postage-stamp. Now comes
an announcement that a new Agent-General
(Duncan Gillies) is to be appointed immediately,
and people naturally desire to know the latest
excuse for the English portion of Reid’s expensive
trip.

SO ENGLISH, YOU KNOW.
“A Good Old Custom. —And we would help to make the coming
Christmas more pleasant, and to assist in maintaining the good old
English custom of welcoming Santa Claus and making the outward and
visible signs of the season symbolical of the time of the year.” —Suburban
Newspaper Drivel.
Mr. De Dobson keeps up (while it’s 105 in the shade) a “good old
English” custom.
A well-known Maoriland politician, whose
“h” was mislaid in infancy, was recently address-
ing a meeting on the West Coast when an elector
asked him what views he held upon the Sinking
Fund. “Hi refuse to hanswer,” was the response;
“ hand if it wasn’t for the hexalted position I
’old, hi would dab your ’ead hin your own paint-
pot.” Then there was so horrible a silence that
the audience could hear the interest accumulating
u P° n its overdraft,
Duncan Gillies is said, by his champion
journal, to have enjoyed the full confidence of the
present Victorian Assembly. He was its natural
leader, “ sitting, so to speak, above the Premier.”
But what an awful accusation to hurl at a man in
the form of a compliment! The natural leader of
that malodorous gang—the chief husher-up—pre-
dominant keepitdarker—principal dumb protector
of the bank-busting crowd !!! Gillies ought to
Argus for libel.
Cackling over the recent ocean - race
between the P. and O. s.s. Australia and the
French M.M. Co.’s Arraand Behic, a professedly
“ Australian” paper, a Sydney daily, says—“ The
sea is England’s, not so easily as of old, but still
undoubtedly.” Of course! The sea is England’s,
the earth is England’s, the sky is England’s, the
air is England’s, the equator is England’s, heaven
is England’s, hell is England’s—and, by Jingo, the
daily press is England’s,
The letters of thanks which retiring Crown
Ministers officially tender to their officers and
clerks are now generally laughed at by the
recipients. They are always tendered, they
always breathe the same sentiments, they always
extol the same virtues, and it very often happens
that the writers fall into using the same words
and phrases. Several lines in R. E. O’Connor’s
late letter to the N.S.W. Justice myrmidons were
identical with lines in the effusion which the
lamented Abigail bestowed upon “ my loyal co-
workers in this great Department of Mines.”
The vigour with which the Patterson
Ministry decides to hang Frances Knorr for baby-
murder is in strange contrast with the want of
vigour which characterised it when it “washed
its hands of the Mercantile prosecution,” and
refused to take any cognisance of James Munro’s
broken banks, and positively declined to move in
the smellful Freehold Investment case and many
other affairs of the same kind. The Ministry has
a reputation for energy to maintain, and, having
let so many influential suspects slip through its
boneless fingers, it is bound to hang the wretched
woman to show that it is still a “ strong Govern-
ment.”
Dear Bulletin, — Relative to the kingdom
of Greece’s proposed composition of 10s. in the £,
and your comments thereon—isn’t it a fact that Bull
has made more money out of some countries that
“let him in ” than from those which borrow at a
comparatively low rate of interest ? Turkey and
Egypt, for example, have been profitable clients
for John Isaac Moses Bull, despite their in-
solvencies. —Yours, Unearned Increment. [The
borrower that the money-lending Bull made most
out of was his own nation, which floated loans at
50 per cent, discount to raise money for the
French wars of George 111. and the Bottomless
Pitt; and the countries which let him in generally
did it before Bull had time to make much out of
them. Egypt, by the way, isn’t insolvent. —
Ed. B.]
Ed. Bulletin, —You say that “during the
worst of the depression the Vic. Government gave
out some =£2ooo worth of passes.” So it did, but
it is still doing it, and on the same conditions as
you mention. The other day a cab drove up to
the door of Melb. public offices and a well-dressed
young man with a radiant blue tie dashed from it
into the office. He wanted a pass to Warrackna-
beal—would the clerk please hurry up as he had
to catch a train. Asked what the cabman was
charging him, he replied carelessly: “Three bob
an hour.” He signed the agreement and had got
as far as the door when a happy thought struck
him. “By the way, I see this thing’s second-
class. If I pay the difference can I travel first?”
—Wat Tyler.
Dear Bulletin, —The Midland Railway in
Westralia is one of the most scandalous pieces of
political jobbery ever perpetrated. The Govern-
ment not only gave the co. thousands of acres of
good land to construct the line, but actually found
it £500,000 in hard cash. Indications are that
the province will have to pay that .£500,000, and
then buy back the line, before it can get rid of the
crowd mixed up in it. How much change then
out of .£1,400,000? Did you notice the State-rent
reductions of £250,000 to enable some members of
both Houses of Parliament and their friends to
re-stock their poverty-stricken runs, on which they
employ none but Chinese and aboriginals ? Well,
so soon as these people heard that a man from
another province was crossing the border into
W.A. with 10,000 head of cattle to stock an out-
side run they rushed the Stock Tax Bill (30s. per
head) through Parliament, and demanded from
this man, at the point of a police-trooper’s re-
volver, “£15,000, or take your cattle back.”
Until the “six families” no longer monopolise
this province, Westralia will remain a howling
dingoland. The best Xmas-box that W.A. could
receive would be the sudden death of some 50 or
60 of her so-called “ prominent citizens ” — alias
political jobbers—and their bummers. —Yours,
&c., Jarbah. Perth, W.A.
HOW THEY SAVED THE COUNTRY.
“ From every imaginable quarter Peers were whipped-
up to give their vote against the Home Rule Bill and
make its defeat as impressive as possible.”— (Daily
Paper.)
The Duke he came from his kennels down ;
The Earl was carted from Bedlam town ;
The Baron deserted his Hebrews true
(And left unpaid some bills past due);
The Bishop came in his shirt of hair
From his lowly hut with its walls so bare ;
The Marquis came on his keeper’s chain
With an ice-pack cooling his heated brain ;
Lord Bevis came from the boozing ken;
Lord Guy he came from the harlot’s den—
For the maddening beat of the Tory drum
It rolled and rang in a fury : “ Come 1
O ! come, and save the country 1 ”
O ! Some were sober and some were not,
And some were short of a tile (I wot);
With a martial flash in the fishy eye
And a doddering gait they hobbled by;
They hastened downward for their lives,
They left their homes and their neighbours’ wives;
They even left (these patriots true)
The ballet-girl and the billet-doux;
They left their royalties—left their rent,
And helter-skelter away they went,
At the maddening beat of the Tory drum
As it rolled and rang in a fury ; “ Coma !
O ! come and save the country ! ”
Q’sland.
P. LUETIG.
The Political Outlook.
The most appropriate and significant descrip-
tion of political affairs in New South Wales, at
the present moment, is “in chaos.” The light of
representation is absolutely extinguished. Is it not
time for electors of this country to be up and doing,
and say, like theßomans in the days gone by, “We
will suffer wrongs no more?” Let every elector re-
flect, and grasp the situation, then, when the time
has run and the day is at hand when the battle
shall be fought, there will be—there must be—such
an overwhelming opinion given as to the base
treachery and subtle scheming of the past few
days, that on all sides the acknowledgment will
be heard, “ The voice of the people is the voice of
God.” Such an acknowledgment as that has for
years been heralded in regard to the original
panacea for debility, lassitude, and weakness,
“ Marshall’s Tonic Nervine,” and for the coming
struggle, when staunch nerves, indomitable pluck,
and fearless resolution will be absolute necessities,
let everyone fortify himself with this super-
lative, recuperative, and vitalising agent. Mr.
Whiteford, late of the Herald office, further
testifies to the above by writing. “My wife,
after taking two or three bottles of Marshall’s
Tonic Nervine, rapidly improved in appetite,
digestion, and consequently nerve vigour. She
was before rapidly sinking, now she is strong and
well. ”

A HOLIDAY TRIP TO LAUNCESTON, HOBART AND PORT ARTHUR.


Thus Premier Patterson . “ Would it not have a good effect on the whole of
Australasia just, now to get our future king and queen, the Duke of York and his
young wife, to pay us a visit, say during next year I
Duke of York “And, oh, granny,
__ I should so much like to go !”
GrauYy Dei Gratia “ But, ray child, your wedding has cost a lot of money,
you know, and I don’t really- think we could afford ”
York : “ But, granny, I'm sure Australia would be only too glad to
stump up the ex.’s.”
Grakkt : “ Oh, well, in that case, why, of course, I would have no|
objection,”
Having Uacie Alfred’s experience
before him, he should get the court
boiler-maker'to fortify his clothing in
places with iron plates.
The Queen is here seen whispering some parting words t
of advice to the Duchess, in which the Sydney Morning
Herald’s London correspondent will overhear frequently
epeated—“And, my -dear, do be careful of yourself!''

Which same potentiality miybt become
a new source of friction between the two
rival provinces
gfd
g
Haply there may be two little potentialities, in which
case there would be enough to go round.
No doubt the spectacle of the royal couple spooning
upon the hanks of .the Yarra “would be extremely in-
teresting to ' Young Australia,’ ” and stimulate the
drooping manufactures of Melbourne! In the distance,
siaokc may be seen issuing from the chimneys of num l
Uericss boiling-down works

“ The Prince has been here I

boyhood as a young sailor in |
the Bacchante, and this may be |
expected to whet his interest

the throne.’” . , I
That’s all very fine, but dragging a full-grown duchess about over the
“ scenes of early boyhood is not all that the poetic Patterson cracks it up to
be. However it might “ strengthen the cords between us and the oM country,
jt would be very trying to the cords of a young duke’s legs.

SOME POTENTIALITIES OP THE PROPOSED TORK-MAY VISIT.


Gold discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened at Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Mur-
chison, &c., in West Australia, which will bo one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is to secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., 309 Pitt-street, Sydney,
offers exceptionally well-positioned blocks from
,£lO each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well-known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J, Douglas,
who will be pleased to forward plans to any
address, and, having a personal knowledge of the
properties, will select faithfully for intending
purchasers where required.

No representative Australian cricketer
must again be allowed to take his wife abroad on
a team-tour. The captain of a mail-steamer is not
permitted to bring his wife—on the principle that
there must be only one captain on board a ship.
The principle obviously applies to cricket-teams.

The wife of an Australian Judge having
gone ’Ome, her learned husband began to philander
with a shapely singing- woman. Hearing that
Madame was about to return, his Honor visited
his melodious friend and explained that his posi-
tion as a Judge would not permit of the all too
delightful intimacy being continued, but he would
take the liberty of calling again and offering her
some little memento of their—er —friendship.
Later on he did call bearing a heavy parcel, which,
when undone, proved to contain—a family Bible.
You should just hear his Honor’s learned brother,
the chief of the divorce-court, relate this little
story.

AT GEEY GREEN DAWN.
(For The Bulletin.)
A deep sweet sleep I fell in,
And I dreamt a dream of joy,
/ nd in waking I murmured, “ Helen I”
1 had dreamt of Helen of Troy.
The woman I love was bending
Above me with lightning gleams
In her eyes : “Though your love’s unending,”
She said, “I dislike your dreams.”
“ And what if the dreams were true then ? ”
I whispered, nestling my head
On her lily breast —“ As for you then
I would strangle you, dear,” she said.
V. J. DALEY.
Australia spent a very jerry Xmas.
A man got a divorce
recently, in Melbourne, on
the ground that his wife had
deserted him “about thirty
times altogether.” Their
married life extended over
a period of fifteen years, so
it would seem that the lady
left him every half-year on
an average. This exercise
probably did a lot to keep
her in good health. The
sedentary life led by most
women is very injurious.

Auckland (M.L.) Wes-
leyans are much perturbed
with regard to the proper
method of running their
paper, the Methodist. One
rev. gentleman said that they
would “ never get a paper
to please them unless it was
published in Heaven, and
edited by Gabriel.” That is
a good suggestion, but maybe
Gabriel isn’t a Wesleyan.

In Auckland (M.L.) a
man lately got two years for
stealing an opera-glass. Then
another man was brought up,
charged with a brutal and
horrible assault on a little

two years also.

“See, amid the winter
snow, born for us on earth
below,” runs the presumptu-
ously ignorant h’old Hinglish
carol. Christ was born in a
warm country, anyway,
apart from the question as to
the time of year when the
event took place. But the
typical Christmas of Great
Britain is snow-bound, and
no other Christmas is sup-
posed to have a voice in
the matter. Most people
are aware that Hingland
bought the sole rights in the
Saviour’s birth.
Another love-story, from N.S.W, divorce-
court. After the unyoking the divorcing wife
said on several occasions that she was still
attached to her husband, and was willing to for-
give him and live with him again. The solicitor
caused a communication to be sent to respondent
on the subject, but he said he preferred to remain
in gaol.

On the morning of Dec. 28th, 250,000
(more or less) married men read aloud to their
wives the news that seven senseless politicians
had conspired to invite the Duke of York and
bride to visit Australia; 250,000 left male
eyelids winked when the announcement was
completed, and the same number of ladies said,
“The idea! as though she hadn’t something else
to think about.” There wasn’t a woman in the
land who couldn’t see further than a Premier.
Unless Premier Patterson, and all the other
Australian Premiers, had gathered from private
information that the Duchess of York might have
reasons for wishing to take a long sea voyage,
instead of an overwhelming reason for not wishing
to do so, then their joint-and-several invitation
scheme was childishly foolish on the face of it.
Haven’t they wives to give them a judicious hint?
Apart from domestic contingencies, the Yorks
would find a few score of objections to rushing off
to Australia just now. The Duke’s aged grand-
mother and nervous mother would object. The
Duchess’s parents would sooner fall out of the
window than willingly let the prospective queen
of their family visit the other end of the earth
until the “direct succession is further provided
for.” Finally, the Yorks themselves, having any
amount of fun cut and dried for consumption
whole battalions of relatives, friends and toadies
waiting to entertain them—would, one imagines,
regard the Pattersonian idea as a crazy joke. And
it was indeed a very crazy joke. Nevertheless, its
lunacy appealed to the mind of the Australian
daily press, and won plaudits from every import-
ant editor whose imagination requires greasing.
Didn’t The Bulletin mention (in rhyme) a few
weeks ago that the Queen was anxiously looking
forward to “ the first of May ? ” Wasn’t that good
enough for the seven statesmanlike dodderers who
thought the present time “ most opportune ” for
a visit to Australia? The Bulletin is infallible
with its Royal Family information. The Duke of
York was apportioned to Princess May by this
red-covered journal long before the matter was
settled anywhere else.

ONE LAST APPEAL.
“At this juncture, too, a \isit from the Duke of
York and his young wife would do much good, in
raising the spirits of these communities after the late
depression which we have all felt so much.”— {Extract
from Premier Patterson’s immortal circular note.)
Come over, Dook, and do your best
Your level best,
To cheer a people sore depress’t—
Our state of mind is fearful!
Come here and be a buttered guest,
And set the troubled souls at rest
Of thousands who are tearful.
For since pur banks began to break—
Began to break,
We’ve suffered from the pocket-ache ;
Beloved Dook, for Hingland’s sake 1
Consent to make us cheerful.
When stocks and shares are going down—
Hi, derry-down!
The jokes of pantaloon and clown
Seem anything but novel.
BALLAST FOR THE HUT.
SQUATTER: “Now then, you are not going to camp in that hut.
You’d best crawl off the run!”
MOULDY MIKE: “If it was’nt for the trav'lers sleepin’ in it
your bloomin’ hut would crawl off itself.”
There’s nothing doing round the town ;
Our only comfort is the Crown
That lets us file a shovel.
With muffled sigh and meek “ hooray ” —•
Alack a day !
We bless yourself and Princess May,
And on our knees we humbly pray—
“ Assist us, Lord, to grovel.”
Come over, Dook, and bring your bride—
Your royal bride,
We need a “ burst ” of joy and pride,
A “drunk” of adoration ;
At banquets you’ll be glorified
(What loyal lies would then be lied !)
By snobs of rank and station.
Triumphal arches we’ll erect,
So gaily deck’t;
A “Splendid Welcome ” please f xpect;
Again we cry, with deep respect,
Come out and save the nation !
’Twas Patterson who struck the plan
The artful plan;
He is a tough old Orangeman—
You never met a tougher.
He smileth on the Munro clan
And hates the rebel Fenian
Or democratic “duffer.”
In fancy he is placing now—
Is placing now
A coronet upon his brow,
And jubilantly thinking how
The Radicals would suffer.
BREWERY

ONLY SHAMMING.
INSPECTOR (to Moriarty 761 XXX, who has Just come out of a brewery) :
“Why, man, you’re drunk!”
M ORIARTY: “No, sorr. Oim — hi c—only shammin’ to thry and catch
thim — hi c—pickpockets.”
Come over, Dook and Duchess fair,
Exalted pair,
Twin spectacles sublime and rare
For legislative jobber;
Disperse the clouds of dark despair,
And make each heart that harbours care
A light, ecstatic throbber.
Fill all the land with song and dance —
The merry dance;
Bid biped asses neigh and prance—
Give Australasia a chance —
A decent chance to slobber.

A Bulletin man the other day attended
the funeral of a Catholic gentleman (in Queens-
land, of course—nearly everything happens in
Queensland). A particularly stale cleric was in
attendance. He was a short, squat ecclesiastic
with a red face covered with the shine of old,
neglected perspiration. His hair hadn’t been
brushed recently, and a great mass of red and not
over-clean fat bulged out over his dirty, tight
collar, giving him the appearance of a man who
was being strangled while hot. He had no neck
worth speaking of, and his large bullet head, with
protruding veins just below the grease-mark of
his hat and just above his inflamed nose, gave him
a most aggressive aspect. Two dirty, hairy,
freckled paws with short fingers like sausages and
a deep rich loam beneath the nails, formed the
balance of him so far as he was visible. The out-
ward sign of his holy calling was a cassock that
was ripped at the seams for want of a tidy house-
keeper to repair it, and shiny at the back; and he
looked as if he had been dressed with a fork.
There were grease-spots on the good man, and he
was vaguely suggestive of snuff, onions and anger.
This over-ripe individual hurried through the
service in a thick voice, so unctuous as to suggest
that his utterances were sifted through ham.
Then, when he had mumbled the necessary Latin,
he felt in his waistcoat pocket for the holy water
with which to sprinkle the deceased. The waist-
coat was old, stale, grease-spotted, and redolent
of pipe-ash like the rest of him, and the holy water
was in an essence-of-lemon bottle with the label
still on. He brought it out and made a hurried
grab at the cork, but it broke off short, and the
holy father grew purple with sudden indignation.
Then he cocked his eye sideways at the remains of
the cork, and hurriedly fishing out a knife with a
broken blade he opened it with his murky nails
and proceeded to gouge anxiously—there were a lot
of people present—at the obstacle. Meanwhile the
proceedings were at a standstill. The cork, despite
all the good man’s gouging, wouldn’t move, and
with every effort he grew redder and madder, and
his black and blue muzzle, where he was in urgent
want of a shave, began to champ ominously. At
last the knife broke. Then a sudden thought
striking him he poked the cork in with his black
little finger, and hastily sprinkled the coffin.
Soon afterwards the impressive ceremony ended.
It was a mean, squalid affair from first to last,
and to the clean Catholics present, who, no doubt,
hope to be buried decently by clean priests, it was
obviously most unspeakably disgusting.

Jules Joubert is again to the fore, pro-
moting a “Tasmanian Exhibition” at Hobart—
perhaps the very last promotable possibility in
exhibitions. The Tasmanian Exhibition is 12
months distant, as yet; but all Hobart is already
steadily choir-practising for its inaugural shriek-
music. It is a common evening occurrence to
meet a procession of sets of choristers—four
women to one small man is the usual set—with
music under their arms, and amours in their hearts.
The amount of social responsibility now being
undertaken by the imperturbable Joubert cannot
be estimated by any known process of calculation,
but when the final results of the choir-practices
are consummated, the total should be interesting
to sociologists. M. Joubert strikes many persons
as being a dilution of De Lesseps—this is intended
as a compliment—just as Surgeon Fitzgerald, of
Melbourne, and perhaps also the. much travelled
R. S. Smythe, appear to be dilutions of the Great
Napoleon.

good little boy called Henry in Mrs. Wood’s
novels—the boy who dies young of consumption.
The lawyer employed him (at first to clean boots)
and educated him, and when, later on, he had
become a law-clerk with a large hole in his
lung the kindly lawyer gave him £5 and sent him
out on to a friend’s station in the Far West.
There he took part in making the biggest silver
find on earth, and by-and-bye he came back to
town wearing a collar as high as a sheep-hurdle
and a fan-tailed diagonal coat, and looked up the
lawyer and told him that he Was worth .£BOO,OOO,
after which he went “home” and discovered his
relations, who were, of course, people of noble
birth. /
The story serves to show how, provided he has
phenomenal luck, the respectful small boy, who
cleans the boots assiduously, may rise in the world
and come to 'great affluence. Still there are a
few conspicuous omissions in it. When Philip
returned the boom was over, and the Melbourne
lawyer had doubtless been ravaged by it like all
other Melbourne lawyers, and the ashes of his
burnt hopes were conspicuous in his silvery hair.
Yet Philip isn’t stated to have wept on the neck
of his good, benevolent old master and asked him
whether a cheque would be of any service. This
omission (possibly due to Philip’s modesty) is
very poor encouragement to the next lawyer to
take in and educate the next small boy who wants
boot-cleaning employment. Also, the discovery
of his elevated relatives at “ ’Ome,” and the
triumphal return to the moated grange, or the
hereditary towers, or whatever it was, is a
depressing penny - dreadful incident; and the
moral of it all is that if Philip hadn’t got a hole
in his lung he would probably have remained a
lawyer’s drudge to this day. Therefore, the pros-
pects of the small boy who isn’t sufficiently
diseased don’t seem to amount to much.

In some of the big Anglo-Australian liners
the under-stewards and stewardesses get £1 to
£l.los. a month, depending entirely on saloon
tips to make £5 a month. This, however, they
fail to do on the trip out, even with a full passenger
list—unless there should be a fair percentage of
returning Australians aboard. The “Home”
trip, with a full saloon, usually results in a
“fiver” for the man who is sufficiently adroit
with his “gentlemen.” The stewardesses prosper
according to the number of fat lady-passengers.

The fact that Robert Stout, the boss
atheist of Maoriland, got a larger share of the
female vote, and was canvassed for more vigorously
by the female propagandists than any other can-
didate at the recent elections, seems to break up
some old-established theories about the orthodoxy
of women. Or else it may be that women are
teetotal first and orthodox afterwards, and when
the choice lies between the cold tea infidel and the
drinky Christian they prefer the former. Any-
how, the egg-bald Stout didn’t get in on his good
looks.

still more largely through the capital voluntarily
surrendered by the second batch of emigrants.
There are over 3000 names on the Australian roll,

The once dignified Argus heaps common
cuss-language on the Age :
The Melbourne morning journal whose disregard for
strict veracity is notorious cannot apparently help study-
ing our articles, though they have unfortunate conse-
quences of provoking severe attacks of foaming at the
mouth. The journal in question comes hack again and
again to the study of the articles. And the more often
they are read the more painful the exhibition of the
constitutional weakness. Now, whatever else may be
said of Ananias, he kept his temper. Our proposal cannot
be challenged on its merits, but it can be lied about, and
it is lied about. Lies are told as to its origin ; lies are
told as to its meaning ; lies are told as to our past utter-
ances ; lies are scattered broadcast in the form of dis-
honest quotations. Now, Ananias seems only to have
told one lie.
There was a time when the Argus regarded the
Age with the lofty contempt of an archangel
regarding a dead worm. And now
Says a correspondent.:—
In 1846 the Stockton cloth factory (at Newcastle,
N.S. W.) throve so that it. was able to turn out billiard-
cloths cheaper than the imported article. Then, the
manufacture of these cloths was considered as one of the
highest achievements of the art, and was usually entrusted
only to experts. The high freights ruling between this
country and Europe constituted for many years an ample
protection for the little industry', which then employed
over 80 hands, but, with the introduction of steam and
cheap freights, it languished and died. So effectually
was it knocked out that in ’5B the whole building was in
ruins, and a few years later had wholly disappeared. No
trace of it now remains—in fact, not a tenth of the pre-
sent inhabitants of Stockton know that there was ever
such an institution in the district.
When the Orange Free State (S. Africa)
was on the eve of defeating the neighbouring
tribe of Basutos, Britain, fearing the loss of
eligible territory, arose at Heaven’s command,
and so successfully negotiated for mercy for the
poor nigs, that the simple Basutos looked upon
Britain as their friend, and petitioned for a
Government Resident. They got him, and
missionaries, too; and lo ! behold another slice of
territory grabbed by J. Bull. That was a score or
so years back, and to-day that same holy Britain
which exhorted the Orange Free State to treat
the nigs, with mercy—snuffle—is shooting down
the Matabele with machine-guns. Some ten years
after the British Resident’s advent to Basutoland,
Cape Parliament passed a Bill enacting that all
natives under the “Crown ” were to disarm. The
Basutos objecting, Gen. Gordon, then Com-
mandant-General of the Cape forces, was des-
patched to put down the “ revolt.” As he entered
Basutoland the native school-children met him
singing, and Gordon, overcome thereat, wheeled
round Ins horse’s head, and returned to the Cape
to resign his Commission. “You send me to
stamp out a revolt,” he said, “ and they meet me
singing hymns !” There always were more of the
ingredients of the successful missionary than of
tile soldier about Gordon.

From Victor Cohen’s report to the Vic-
torian Cricket Council: “The team had the dis-
tinguished honour of lunching with H.R.H. the
Duke of Connaught during the progress of the
match at Portsmouth. To his Grace the Earl of
Sheffield thanks are especially due.” In his
reverence for the salt of the earth Cohen gives the
Earl’s title a ducal style. Which again reminds
us of the British bookmaker who yelled out to the
Duke of Hamilton in the betting-ring at New-
market —“Won’t you take my ten monkeys to
one, yer Royal Tghness?” “He isn’t a Tgh-
ness,” whispered a friend who had managed to
pick up the code of nobility. “Ain’t he—why I
thought the was a dook ! ” replied the bookie.
Lord Gormanston, Governor of Tasmania,
a Hibernian colossus, lately bad introduced to
him, at choir-practice in connection with the
forthcoming Hobart Exhibition, a very little
fiddler with long, rat-sucked-looking hair, and that
far-away expression known among young ladies
as spirituelle. The Jumboesque Governor, tower-
ing above the catgut virtuoso, proceeded to
descant on exhibitions he had seen, and particu-
larly on the “wan of eighteen-fifty-wan,” which,
he remarked, was perhaps the best though not the
biggest of the lot, “After all,” remarked the
Gormanston, drawing himself up to his full
75 or 80 inches, “ soize is no critayrian.” Nobody
laughed—in Hobart Viceroyalty is sacred, and
theatre dress-circle audiences line the passage to
let the Governor get out first—but the little
fiddler looked immensely relieved.
“Barney Parkes” is what a Melbourne
paper calls old man Parkes’s son. The aforesaid
“ Barney ” is getting on for his half-century now,
yet he is still only young Parkes, old Parkes’s son.
The ghastly and horrible youthfulness of old
Parkes makes it impossible to regard young
Parkes as anything but a jam-smeared infant, and
no one takes him for a serious, middle-aged
architect. Then, when old Parkes dies, young
Parkes will come out of his shadow and become
hoary in a day. It is his awful fate to have no man-
hood at all, but to jump from infancy to old age
in one fatal act. If old Parkes kept on living,
young Parkes would continue to be young Parkes
at 94. A man with an overshadowing parent like
that must emigrate if he wants to have an in-
dividuality of his own. By-the-way, there is a
great opening for a sanatorium in some remote
and healthy spot for elderly young men with
oppressive fathers.
Carter Harrison, the recently-shot Mayor
of Chicago, is alleged to have delivered the fol-
lowing address to a party of French engineers
who visited the great Pork Fair :
You have shown us the way, but I reckon we shall very
soon beat you. lam not an engineer, but am the Mayor,
and as such I direct the engineers. lam also head of the
Fire Brigade, and I extinguish fires. By virtue of this
star you see on my breast, I command all the policemen
in this city, I could order them to put you all in prison,
as I could order them to release you if I chose. You will
say lam a great person. I think so, too. Xam the first
man in Chicago. Chicago is the first city in Illinois.
Illinois is the first State of the United States, and the
United States is the greatest country in the world. I am,
therefore, the greatest man in the world. I invite you
and your children to come to the next World’s Fair at
Chicago. By that time, Chicago will be the greatest and
most beautiful city of the world, and beside it London
will be a village and Paris will be nothing at all.
“ Chicago is a hog city,” said somebody or other,
“and the people who live there are hogs.”
A Magnificent Adjustment.
The watch, undoubtedly, is a fine piece of mechan-
ism. It has lately been brought to a very
high state of perfection. One of the most wonder-
ful pieces in the whole of the escapement is the
fine spiral spring commonly known as the hair
spring. The way in which this coil is tempered
is truly marvellous. For many years it was a per-
fect secret, and even now certain factories pride
themselves upon the perfection and exceptionally
fine temper they throw into the spring. Let either
the main or hair spring break and the whole train
comes to a standstill. Both are indispensable, and
each must have perfect action. Now what these
springs are to the watch, the liver and kidneys are
to the body. On the one hand you have the liver
in the form of a large gland or secreting organ
separating bile from the blood, and also making
glycogen from it; while on the other hand you
have the kidneys in the shape of two glands, and
consisting of many tubes, removing the water and
urea from the blood, and forming a part of the ex-
cretory system. As long as these two act in unison
a general healthy order prevails. Let the kidneys,
however, become granulated and Bright’s disease,
with its train of suffering and anguish, makes its
appearance. The uric acid is not carried off, and
the man becomes the subject of distressing afflic-
tions. There is, however, a specific for all liver
and kidney complaints, and its cures are simply
wonderful. Warner’s “ Safe ” Cure has pro ved
itself a boon to thousands and a treasure worth
more than its weight in gold. By keeping these
two springs of action in their normal condition it
secures an almost perfect immunity from danger
to the whole of the body.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHA.T IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpenoe, then it’s domestic economy to close with the merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at

under the old man’s notice. - A. J.S. Bank shares (£5 153-
paid up) are offering in an unresponsive market at £2 ss.
The City of Sydney’s £8 shares are offering at £4 ss. and
its £6 shares at £3. The 70s. shares of the Q.N.B. can’t
find buyers at 15s. National of Australasia (90s. paid up>
are going at 31s. 6d. The Bank of Victoria’s 555. shares
are offered unsuccessfully at the awful figure of 65.; and
the B.N.Z.’s shares (£5 ss. paid) can be had for £3 16s.
Of all the lot the shares of the B.N.Z. are the only ones
which offer any specially attractive prospect. When
that institution reconstructed (without closing) some
1 ears ago, a large number of unrealisable properties were
transferred to an Estates Co. at a low valuation which
was in keeping with the blankness of the times and the
hopeles ness of the general outlook. The Bank of
N.Z. holds most of the shares in this co., and with the
general revival in Maoriland they promise, in course of
time, to bring back almost all the money that was lost by
the bank in the bad time.

The alleged sales of Melb. properties these times
are a mirthless farce. Every now and then some dis-
tracted boom-bank resolves on a special effort to get rid
of a few dozen or a few hundred suburban allotments.
Accordingly, an expensive catalogue is printed, a lot of
advertising is done, the reserve-prices are fixed at a
minimum which makes the ghosts of the old boomers
weep in their graves, and the sale comes off. But nothing
is ever sold. Nobody dreams of offering anything even
distantly resembling the reserve. A small crowd gathers
and looks at the auctioneer with a despondent eye, and
that is all. The other day, by way of a bold experiment,
the Freehold Investment Co. decided to auction a few
properties with no reserve at all, but one such experiment
is likely to be enough. Land that fetched £lO a foot
three years ago went for 205., and ground valued approxi-
mately at £lOO an acre was sold with great difficulty at
something like £9. The theory that vacant land in the
Melb. suburbs has fallen 50 per cent, was knocked on the
head there and then ; it has fallen 90 per cent., and even
the remaining 10 per cent, looks shaky and uncertain.

The Bank of Van Diemen’s Land lottery is ab
last fairly under way. The ruins of the old bank are to
be disposed of in £300,000 shares of £1 each. There are
over 370 prizes, the first one being a Hobart city property
valued at £26,000. The second prize is a first-class city
hotel (Hadley’s “Orient”) of between 60 and 70 apart-
ments, value £22,500. Then follow one £12,000 prize;
one of £10,500 ; one of £9500 ; two valued at £BOOO each,
and so on down to a humble minimum of £lOO. The
prizes are all put in at a reasonable valuation, and the
lottery is managed (on behalf of the liquidators of the
V.D.L. Bank)by Geo. Adams, the well-known “Tattersall,”
whose name is sufficient guarantee for the solid integrity
of the whole proceedings. The properties are all situated
in Tasmania—a pleasant place where any man can put in
his declining years with satisfaction, and the winner of
any one of the 16 or 20 big prizes can’t do better than
settle down on his property, and let the restful, sleepy
atmosphere of Van Diemen’s Land soak into his soul, and
sink into a state of unutterable rest.
The V.D.L. shareholders, by the way, have lost
til their capital, and the success of the lottery, which is a
fair gamble duly authorised by Parliament, will simply
mean that they will be able to pay their debts without
making a call.

Almost the only Xmas presents which circulated
in Melbourne this year were official notifications setting
forth that the receiver had been put on the “ B ” list of
contributories In a broken bank the “A ” list of con-
tributories consist of the actual shareholders at the time
of the suspension. This lot seldom pan out for any-
thing worth speaking of; even 6d. in the £is usually
unattainable. Then the liquidators proceed to squeeze
the “B” list, which consists of people who sold their
shares to individuals on the “A” list, and who mostly
imagined that their liability had long since vanished.
But the Australian boom-bank bursts both the man who
stays in and the one who gets out. The latter individual
loses all claim on the profits, if there are any, but he
retains a vested interest in the losses, and is liable to be
sold up just the same. The man who buys a bank share
buys an incubus that, in most cases, he never altogether
gets rid of. He is like the person who carries about with
him the secret of a mangled corpse hidden in a cave, or
the knowledge of an unburied crime which all the
monkey soap on earth won’t wash off his soul. Last
year most of the broken banks of Melbourne about
exhausted the “ A ” list of contributaries, and the process
of skinning “ B ” list is just commencing in real earnest.

The latest news the writer has from Coolgardie
is that both gold and water are increasing in Bayley’s
Reward ; that work on several of the outside claims is
proving the existence of big lodes of stone, poor in com-
parison with Bayley’s specimen crushings, but good
enough for several ounces to the ton, and that the lasting
character of the field is rapidly being established,
• * *
News from Coolgardie is spasmodic, indefinite,
and unreliable. A wire from Southern Cross to the field
would cure this. We hear of many thousands of ozs. of
gold, of other rich finds, but get precious little detail.
What the public wants to know : size and value of ore-
body, quantity in sight, nature of formations as well as
country rock, character of gold, and, above all, the per-
manent or short-lived features of reefs—is seldom pub-
lished.
» # #
No two plans of Coolgardie (as shown on the
prospectuses of newly-floated companies) seem to agree.
Each has its lease placed next door to the Reward, which
must have a tremendous circumference if all the claims
said to adjoin it really do so. Another perplexing thing
is the direction of the Reward reef, which appears to
wander terribly. In one plan it runs north and south (if
the projected co.’s lease occupies one of those positions),
whilst in another it runs east and west. And then how
do the promoters scoop ! In one 00. recently floated, the
capital was £lO,OOO, of which £7OOO went to the pro-
moters ; and at the first meeting it was calmly announced
that the co.’s first work would be to prospect for gold 1
They didn’t even know if they had a reef.
# • #
The Bayley Reward agony is piled up by the
exhibition in Perth of the latest cake, 68800 z., value,
£25,000. What will the crushings he when they come 7
It is understood that practically the whole of the gold
sold so far comes from a rich thin thread in the reef—the
value of the balance whereof is, so far, publicly uncertain ;
it may yield lOOoz. per ton, or, on the other hand, it may
only give lOdwts. Suppose the controllers of the claim
find the main body of reef poor, will they include any of
the golden thread in their crushings, so as to make up a
leoent average, or will they let the bulk stone take its
chance? Those without definite information on this
point- which the owners are in nowise bound to give—
had better not plunge in Bayley’s shares.
mm*
When the rain comes it will be—“ Go West,
young man, go West.” There are thousands going to
Coolgardie “in the wet season.” Then blessed are they
who have remained there in the dry.

Spa shares have risen from 6d. to Is. 3d. in a
week ; but everything on the Shoalhaven is sick from a
market view. Maorilanders who have seen the sluicing
arrangements there declare them amateurish and a long
way behind the age. If two-thirds of the gold has not been
lost, then the prospects taken from thousands of places
altogether have deceived many mining men.
• • *
Some shareholders are furious at the hole-and-
corner policy pursued by the directors of the Spa Sluicing
Co. The mine is nearly £4OOO in debt, and the only hope
appears to be the new manager’s confidence that by quick-
silver they will be able to save the finest gold.
* • *
The manager of Shoalhaven Consolidated Sluic-
ing Co. doesn’t think he has lost any gold. If not, then
it is the poorest wash on earth; almost as much gold
could be got out of Sydney street-sweepings. A return
from 1000 cubic yards of wash from a new face averaged
over fid. to the yard, which sounds well.

it for £6OOO.

Another creep on B.H. Proprietary, this time
some distance from the famous Block 11 disturbances, in
a locality previously but slightly affected. On Xmas day
a chasm 30ft across at surface appeared on the hanging-
wall side of the lode, within a few feet of the old railway
viaduct lately dismantled. The caved-in ground has, at
present, fallen about 15ft., and the sides of the cavity
overhang at a stiff angle—evidence that the disturbed
area is much greater below than at surface. The timbers
below have fared badly. The divergent railway which
replaces the old viaduct over this portion of the mine was
finished none too soon.
Gnashing of teeth amongst B.H. Proprietary
officials over the rumoured appointment of Uriah Dudley,
secretary of the Australasian Institute of Mining Engi-
neers, and an old-time Barrier mine-manager, to the
management of the lately-completed chloridising works.

The foundering of the steamer Alert near

ously along, weighted down with an amount of

enough the hatches are off and sometimes a lump

The story of Wood, M.L.A., of South
Australia, seems to grow more complicated every
time that gentleman is heard of. At latest
advices the tale of his difficulties was something
like this : Wood married in England at an early
age, and, after a while, he and his wife separated.
He married again, and so did she, therefore he
seems to have two wives living, while she has two
husbands. Wood, however, claims that his first
wife had a husband living when he married her,
so that his first marriage was null and void, and
his second one holds good. Meanwhile, the lady
denies the existence of the alleged first husband,
so the question is, whether Wood committed
bigamy, or whether the alleged Mrs, Wood com-
mitted trigamy, or more? Meanwhile, Wood’s
constituents have decided, with much applause,
that Wood is worthy of their fullest confidence,
and there the matter rests for the present.
True copy of a “Merry Xmaa” letter that

but in vain. I put off writing to you, thinking I

I am here in Bathurst, barefooted, and don’t know
where to go and ask for a pair of boots. The
people tell me they are asked every day by men
for something or other, and that they cannot give
any more. I want to ask you, Joe, please, if you
could manage to send me as much as would get
me a pair of boots and a bit of food, and, as soon
as I can earn it, the first money you will get. I
know it is hard to ask it, but I held back as long
as I could. I have seen starvation this trip, I
must have travelled over 2000 miles and got
nothing. At the present time I am stopping in

In the opinion of the most experienced of
the Newcastle coal-mining engineers and experts a
colliery at Cremorne ? Sydney Harbour, has but a
small chance of being established and a still
smaller one of being worked profitably should it be
established. Old Harry Harper, perhaps one of
the most experienced coal exploiters in the world,
says that from first to last the expenses will be
colossal and will greatly outweigh the advantages
of position. He asserts that the coal will be even
better than the bore shows—experience teaches
that the thicker the cover the better the quality of
the mineral. The average cost of sinking under the
most favourable circumstances is estimated at £35 a
foot and the average rate about ten feet a week, so
that the cost of sinking the two shafts alone will be
over a quarter of a million and the time occupied
about six years. Then perfect winding machinery
of the most costly sort must be used, and ventilat-
ing fans capable of throwing far more air into the
mine than any ever yet constructed. Should any
largo body of water be met with the expenses of
shafting will almost be doubled. It is his opinion
that the seam struck is identical with the upper
one of the Newcastle measures which he has
traced as far south as Bird Island. There it
dips under the Hawkesbury sandstone, the forma-
tion which is superimposed on the Cremorne seam.
He also hazards the opinion that should the bore
be sent down another hundred feet it will pierce
the other two seams of the Newcastle fields. The
temperature is of but little practical account except
inasmuch as it will cause a slight increase in
working-expenses. Mr. Croudace, manager of the
Scottish Australian Co.’s mines, says that the
tremendous pressure on the coal will greatly in-
crease the cost of timbering. Instead of costing
about 4d. a ton to timber, as in Newcastle, the
expense may be as high as 2s. a ton, and only
the most skilful and experienced miners can be
employed on that duty. Moreover the coal, for
the same reason, will have to be worked on that
expensive and wasteful method known as the
"long-wall system.”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The cricket-matoh, N.S. Wales v. South Aus-
tralia, ended in an easy victory for the S.A. men, with
237 runs to the good. In their first innings the Adelaide
crowd scored 106, and the Cornstalks followed with 118.
Then the South Australians made a stupendous effort and
compiled 483 in their second innings, a result chiefly
owing to the splendid play and good luck of George
Gillen, who held his wicket for 6i hours and scored 205
runs. Lyons made 82, and the next highest score was
Jarvis’ 30. N.S. Wales then went to the wickets two
men short, Donnan and Pierce being on the sick list, and
made a total of 234, of which Callaway scored 71; Iredale,
41; and Bannerman a humble 1.
# # •
N.S.W. had another stroke of bad luck in the
match against the Victorian cricketers, who won by
three wickets. In the first innings Moses’ 71 and
Iredale's 27 were the chief elements in the score of 155.
Turner, Murdoch, Callaway, and Mackenzie registered a
duck’s-egg apiece. Victoria followed with 126, and no
sensational scores. N.S. Wales’ second innings closed for
174, Murdoch, with 64, being the principal contributor.
Then the Victorians rapidly compiled 204 for seven
wickets down, Graham, with a score of 68, and Trott
with 54, being responsible for the best part of the
result. The gate-money was £1283, a painful falling-
off of nearly £7OO as compared with last year.

The lightning fighter, Joe Goddard, has been
beaten again—by Laing, of Maoriland, in a £l5O match of
20 rounds, whereof 12 only were fought. Goddard played
cautiously instead of in his old whirlwind style, and
though at times he held a strong advantage, after all the
tricky Laing fairly wore him down. Goddard alleges
“ lack of condition,” but then he was “ out of condition ”
when he succumbed to Denver Smith. The man who is
always out of condition has lost his condition. Goddard
will be a bright exception to the general rule if he doesn’t
now leave the ring and get into condition again bypu'Ung

In general terms, the old agreement (1893)
between the Northern District coal-owners and
the miners was, that the wage of the latter should
be 3s. 6d. a ton when the selling price of coal was
9s. a ton, and that every rise or fall of Is. in the
Belling price should be accompanied by a rise or
fall of 4d. per ton in the hewing rate. During
1893 the selling price was 9s. a ton, and so small
were the earnings of the men that, in a general,
unofficial way, they had determined to resist any
further reduction whatever. For the last four
-months most of the coal companies were, without
apparent cause, gradually reducing the number of
men in their employ. This “ cavilling out,” as it
is called, caused a feeling of defiant uneasiness
among the men, who surmised it was intended to
render them financially unfit to sustain a strike.
Towards the end of December the masters decided
to lower the selling price to Bs. per ton free on
board. Contemporaneously with the publication
of this decision, it was announced that the A. A.
Co., formerly the strongest supporter of the
Masters’ Association, had, in disgust, seceded
from that capitalistic mob, and alone intended to
adhere to the old agreement (3s. 2d. a ton), while
all the others posted notices at the pitheads,
stating their intention of paying only 2s. 10d,, in
that way shifting Bd. out of the shilling fall on to
the miners. On balloting, the majority of the
men decided to accept the A. A. Co.’s terms, but
with scornful unanimity rejected all others. The
iminers were masters of the situation, and had
a strike eventuated, it would have been the
.first time in the history of these disputes in
which the men had a positive assurance of
success, for the A.A. Co. by itself could
supply the whole trade of the port. At
(the last moment, however, the owners gave
way. Reviewing the actions of the capitalists in
tthis affair —the much-published defection of the
A.A. Co. from the Masters’ Ass., their com-
paratively liberal treatment of the men, and the
blatantly determined attitude of the other mine-
owners (who, one and all, declared that they
would rather lay their pits idle than pay 3s. 2d. a
ton), one cannot but conclude that the whole busi-
ness was a cunning, knavish trick intended to
jockey the men into accepting 3s. 2d. a ton all
round, a reduction they might otherwise have been
indisposed lu submit to.

Wool.—As is usual at this time of the year the sales
have been postponed for a fortnight, and our next will be
held on the 11th inst., when we will bring forward a very
attractive catalogue. There is a good private demand
existing for all classes at late rates.
Sheepskins.— Hides, hair, bones, &c., and marsupial
skins. Sales of these lines have also been postponed until
Friday the sth January.
Tallow.— At the sales on Friday the demand was dull
at a decline of from 5s to 10s per ton on previous week’s
rates. Best mutton selling up to £2llos ; best mixed,
from £2O to £2O 15s; beef, £2O to £2O ss; broken
packages, from £l2 per ton.

Some time ago a S.A. politician was
carving a Xmas duck or something, when his
knife slipped, and he thought he was going to die
from lockjaw. Wherefore he rushed to the bosom
of Mother Church, and is now known amongst his
enemies as “ the Carving-knife Catholic.”
One Coolgardie man saw so little fluid that
he never had a wash for six months. His luck
was out, too. While he was coming back to spend
ajdisgusted Christinas with his Adelaide friends,
he got wet to the skin by a succession of thunder-
storms, and his old mate struck one of the richest
shows yet chronicled.
N.S. Wales finishes 1893 with a surplus of
.£16,000 a small thing in itself yet something to
rejoice over as being the first real surplus the dis-
tressful province has seen for a good many years.
The year’s expenditure shows a reduction of
•£769,000, the result of much retrenchment and
hard economy on the part of the Dibbs Cabinet.
All sorts and conditions of men can be
found at Coolgardie. Broadnbb, the ex-Broken-
hillionaire and 3600-guinea-Titan-gelding man
was there a few weeks ago. There is another man
there who was once a member of the Four-in-hand
Club, and has been seen driving the Prince of
Wales behind a spanking tandem team. He was
dry-blowing on Hannan’s rush.
And are we to assume that even the
Radical S.A. Premier Kingston joined in inviting
York and May to Australia—instead of seizing
the opportunity to sneer at the hideous alleged
English of J. B. Patterson’s circular, and the
greasy toadyism which alone could prompt such a
scheme at a time when our people are dying for
want of work? The correspondence in this matter
should be moved for.
Prendergast, the shooter of Mayor Harrison
of Chicago, was the author of a plan by which the
Chicago railroad companies would be compelled to
elevate their tracks and the outrageous loss of life
caused by the 1500 open and unprotected crossings
be reduced to a minimum. Harrison was bitterly
opposed to the proposed innovation, although, in
the first seven months of last year, 120 persons
were killed on these crossings by passing trains.
The wildly eulogistic notices of Harrison never
alluded to the fact of his being the nominee and
advocate of the gambling and liquor interests of
the hog city.
Messrs. Fisher and Lingham, dealers in
National Cash Registers and Smith Premier
Typewriters, forward a mass of most interesting
and charmingly-printed literature dealing with
their specialities. Among them is a massive book
containing 1001 letters expressive of the writers’
cordial approval of the National Cash Register, for
its accuracy, simplicity, and cheapness, and the
strict honesty which distinguishes it from the old
style of live meat cash-keeper. Also it can be
made to register credit sales as well as cash, and
to do most of the book-keeping in a small estab-
lishment. The Smith Typewriter is represented
by a number of letters written with that imple-
ment, and remarkable for neatness and absolute
freedom from defect. The American firms which
manufacture these articles send out a mass of
marvellously elegant illustrated books concerning
them.

AN XMAS TALE.
Dear Bulletin,—l charge
You tell it not to all.
My heart—it was so large ;
My means—they were so small.
Had I been Croesus? Whoo !
I would have sent no end
Of Xmas Presents to
Each enemy and friend.
My heart and soul they ache
Because of this, my need ;
I hope my fiieuds will take
The will as for the deed.
But, could I let it go,
L ; ke broker’s pledges, by
Without one gift to show ?
I couldn’t. No; not I!
Ah ! season eloquent
Of joy and festive larks !
I couldn’t. So I sent
An old dead cat to Parkes.
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
Sydney’s advance in the matter of
morality is one signal incident of the depression,
and landlords whose tenants comprised the
“widow lady who wants to borrow .£s’’from
kind but hairless gent., and the lady whose hus-
band is away in the country, find that the demand
for conveniently-situated premises has fallen away
to nothing. Tne police explain that many of the
undesirables have gone Coolgardie way, and the
rest to Paraguay.
An American critic, writing in one of the
magazines, says that h« has seen English “women
of the best class struck by stones and eggs and
dead fish ” while electioneering on behalf of their
friends or relatives. He omits to state whether
the eggs and fish were also of the best class, but
no doubt they were of the best class for electioneer-
ing purposes. It is the Primrose dames who
•come in for these favours, the British plutocracy
having a finely admiring eye for the lower classes
when polling day is on.
■Colemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Pills stir one up.
When a Hebrew dies his body is taken
charge of by officials from the synagDgue and
buried in a plain, deal coffin—rich and poor alike.
“ We brought nothing into this world, and it is
certain we can carry nothing out and fond as
Jews are of show they bow to precept. But for
the number of be-diamonded “followers”it would
be difficult to distinguish between a millionaire
Hebrew’s funeral and a pauper’s, buried at the
State’s expense. It is only the Gentile who takes a
ghoulish delight in having a pompous burial,
with all its dismal paraphernalia, gin-besotted
hangers-on, and ruinous expense.
Members of the Melbourne W.C.T.U.
urge the Government to abolish the use of penny-
in the-slot cigarette machines, as they are a
temptation to the small boy with a penny for the
missionaries. The W.C.T.U. would be content if
the mechanism of the machine were so altered as
to deliver a tract on the evils of tobacco to the
youngster who expected a cigarette. The langu ge

In life there are no Unities, but three Incom-
preheusibles : Destiny, Man, and Woman.

Just before he died he kissed his wife’s hand
and ca'led her “Elizabeth.” She had been chris-
tened Augusta Frederica; but then, as the doctors
explained, dying men often make these mistakes.

Men heap together the mistakes of their lives,
and create a monster which they call Destiny.

Emily was shocked at his death and grieved
because she could not grieve. He had been so
very kind and so very stupid. She went in
mournful weeds,, and ordered orchids to be placed
on bis grave twice a week. Her mother suggested
—“At all events, for the present.”
m * *
“To see men as they are not, and never could
be, is the privilege peculiar to the feminine nature.
You see,” he went on, “love comes to man
through his senses—to woman through her im-
agination. I might even say, taking the subject
on broad lines, that women love men for their
virtue; while men, very often, love women for the
absence of it.”
* # *
When a man gets an idea into his head about a
woman, whatever she may say or do only gives
him one more reason for sticking to it. It is only
when he gets an equally strong idea about some
other subject or some other woman that he becomes
nicely critical.

Women have boundless faith in the sobering
effect of Commonplace. It is the remedy they
administer to disordered passions.

“A man may give his whole life to a woman,
and it won’t mean so much to her as if he had once
jawed her out of neuralgia.” “And a woman,”
said Emily, “ may give her soul for a man, and he
won’t think so much of her as if she had jilted
him for somebody else.”
• • *
“My wife was beautiful,” he said; “I cannot
tell how beautiful.” For the lover there is only
one glory. He paused and sighed ; his eyes seemed
to pierce into another world. . . . “Fancy!”
said Mrs. Grimmage, “only fancy! Was she
very nice?” . * . “Nice? Dear God! Where
did you learn that word? Nice?” He threw
back his head and laughed.

“Work is good,” murmured Legge, “the only
good—except Hope. I have lots of Hope.” ....
“Oh, yes,” said Anna, “there is Hope.” She
looked hopeless. ... I have been harder hit
than you,” said Legge. “I died twelve years
ago; the only thing about me that lives is my
stomach. I remember they fed it with chops—on
the day she was buried.”

June—that a year of such would be unhealthy.

Lord Middlehurst’s death, gave his lounging-coat

man that a rat-hunt might be amusing,

The tableaux. Emily, as “ Vivien,” under
limelight, showed him that Emily was frivolous;
also, that her hair fell below her waist. Both dis-
coveries were soul-plaguing: the first because it
jarred; the second because he shared it with
assembled Middlehurst. After the performance
he was the only one who did not offer some
tribute to her beauty. “7 am afraid,” she said,
“you don't care for Tennyson.”

One of the gentlemen wore the gaiters of a
dean. One of the ladies looked as though she
would like to wear them, if only for half-an-hour.
She was a small woman, and extremely slight, yet,
in spite of her slimness, there was not the faintest
sign of bone about her; in fact, it was said that
she had not a bone in her body. She was com-
posed of flesh, blood, and spirit.
Mr. Digby Yallence was a gentleman of some
fame who had translated Theocritus out of
honesty into English, discovered a humourist in
Jeremy Taylor, damned Rousseau, and, in his
leisure, bred canaries. Mrs. Digby was tall o’
span, with a small face, big eyes, and a large
mouth. Digby was fond of saying that his wife’s
face was geometrically impossible. The parts were
greater than the whole.
* • * *
The Dean’s sister was the widow of an Irish
major, who had left her his lame hunter, four very
healthy little boys, and a dying command that
she should do her duty by the children.
Sacheverell awoke one morning to find the pitiful
group on his doorstep in St Thomas’s-in-the-
Lkufes, where he held a small living. “I knew
you would be glad to have us,” said Eleanor.
The next day his study was referred to as the
drawing-room, and he was moved away to the
attic out of the children’s noise.

The New City Bank of
Sydney Premises.
No more artistically conceived and worthier
example of the abilities, skill and experience of
the designers, constructors and other craftsmen
employed on the many palatial public buildings
that ornament the city of Sydney, is to be seen
than that which has been achieved by the erectors
of the new premises of the City Bank of Sydney,
shown hi the accompanying illustration. This
structure takes first rank among the many magni-

elevation. The Pyrmont stone fagade has an
altitude of 78ft., surmounted by a graceful tower,
which rises to a height of 110 ft. The spandrels
display chastely-executed sculptures represent-
ing* Manufactures and Commerce (each de-
picted by a female figure in a reclining attitude),
Justice, and Telegraphy; and Agriculture, Navi-
gation, Mining, and Minting—these four latter
being pourtrayed by boys working at their respec-
tive avocations.
That portion of the building facing Pitt-street,
shown in the fagade of our illustration, consists,
above the ground-floor, of a mezzanine and four
other storeys, approached from the side-entrance

massively-built strong-rooms, so constructed that
features of the building, the vestibule is specially
worthy of a few words. Entering from Pitt-
street, its sumptuous decoration at once strikes
the beholder. On either side handsornely-orna-
rnented doors lead into the general manager’s and
assistant-manager’s rooms, and wide swing doors
open into thegeneral banking chamberinfront. The
sides of the vestibule are rich in their linings with
the choicest and rarest marbles of the Pyrenees—
Br&ohe Ombre, Grande Antique, Rouge Griotte,
and the lovely Yert de Alpes. Overhead, the
ceiling of Sicilian marble, coffered with enriched
bronze panels, and supported by a rich cornice,
forms one of the many beauties of the vestibule,
whioh is a work of beauty and taste throughout.
The new bank claims to have, and does possess,
in the large banking chamber the most magnifi-
cent room in Australasia devoted to banking
purposes, and no written description of it could
be attempted but that would fail to do justice to
it in many particulars. Imagine, however, a
chamber 100 feet in length, nearly 43 feet
in width, and 27 feet in height from floor to
ceiling, divided into three main compartments
by detached Corinthian columns and pilasters
placed upon a stylobate, and supporting the great
principal beams. In the centre compartment is a
domed skylight 24ft. in diameter, rising’ to a
height of 46ft. from the floor, and glazed with
stained glass similar to that of the windows, with
lateral and spandrel ceiling panels. Although
this scant outline of the general banking chamber
may convey a faint idea of its main features—its
size and noble proportions generally—no idea can
be gained, except by a personal inspection, of the
wealth of decoration, the beauty of colour, and the
all-round sumptuousness that are manifested
wherever the eye may rest.
The general bank accommodation may be briefly
outlined by saying that in the splendidly-lighted
basement are three additional strong rooms,
clerks’ luncheon-room—3oft. x 18ft.—store-room
for stationery, messenger’s room, the electric-
lighting plant and the furnace for the destruction

A Tale of a Mask.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Lannigan, who lived on Motukoe, was in
debt to his firm. This was partly due to his fond-
ness for trade gin and partly because Bully
Hayes had called at the island a month or so back
and the genial Bully and he had played a game or
two of poker.
“ I’ll give you your revenge when I come back
from the Carolines, Lannigan,” said the redoubt,
able captain as he scooped in every dollar of the
trader’s takings for the past six months. And
Lannigan, grasping his hand warmly and declar-
ing it was a pleasure to be “claned out by a
gintleman,” bade him good-bye and went to sleep
away from home for a day with some native
friends. Tariro, his Manhiki wife, had a some-
what violent temper, and during the poker
incident had indulged in much vituperative
language outside, directed at white men in general
and Lannigan in particular.
• • •
“ See, thou swiller of gin, see what thy
folly has brought us to,” said the justly-incensed
Tariro, when he came back, and with her took
stock of his trade goods; “ a thousand and fiv e
hundred dollars’ worth of trade came we here
with, and thou hast naught to show for it but
five casks of oil and a few stinking shark-fins 5
and surely the ship of the m alo (his firm) will be
here this month.”
Lannigan was in a bit of a fix. The firm he was
trading for on Motukoe didn’t do business in the
same free-and-easy way as did Bobby Towns’
captains and the unconventional Bully Hayes.
They made him sign papers, and every time the
ship came the rufous-headed Scotch supercargo
took stock, and a violent altercation would result
over the price of the trade; but as the trader
generally had a big lot of produce for the ship
matters always ended amicably. He—or rather
his wife, Tariro—was too good a trader to have an
open rupture with, and the wordy warfare always
resulted in the trader saying, in his matter-of-fact
way, “ Well, I suppose it’s right enough. You only
rob me wanst in twelve months, and I rob the
natives here every day of my life. Give ms in a
case of gin, an’ I’ll send ye a pig.”
* * •
But he had never been so much in debt as
he was now. Tariro and he talked it over, and hit
upon a plan. He was to say, when the ship came,
that he had but five casks of oil; all his trade had
been sold for cash, and the cash —a thousand
dollars—represented by a bag of copper bolts
picked up on the reef from an old wreck, was to
be taken off to the ship and accidentally dropped
overboard as it was being passed upon deck. This
was Lannigan’s idea, and Tariro straightway tied
up the bolts in readiness in many thicknesses of
sail-cloth.
* • •
“Here’s Lannigan coming,” called out
the captain of the trading vessel to the super-
cargo, a week or so afterwards, “ and that saucy
Manhiki woman as usual with him, to see that
he doesn’t get drunk. The devil take such as
her ! There’s no show of getting him tight.”
“How are you, Lannigan?” said the super-
cargo, wiping his perspiring brow. He had just
come out of the hold where he had been opening
tinned meats, and putting all the “blown” tins
he could find into one especial case—for Lannigan.
This was what he called “makin’ a mairgin for
loss on the meats, which didna’ pay well.”
“Eine,” said the genial Lannigan, “an’ I
haven’t got but five casks of oil for yez. Devil a
drop av oil would the people make when they
looked at the bewtiful lot av trade ye gave me
last time. They just rushed me wid cash, an’l
tuk a matter av a thousand dollars or so in a
month.
“Yerra guid business,” said the supercargo,
“ but ye made a gran’ meestake in selling the
guids for Cheelian dollars instead of oil. An’ sae
I must debit ye wi a loss of twenty-five par cent,
on the money— ”
“Chile dollars be damned 1” said Lannigan,
“all good American dollars—we've had about
twenty whaleships here, buyin’ pigs an’ poultry
an’ pearl shell.”
“Twenty-one ship,” said Tariro, blowing the
smoke of her cigarette through her pretty little
nose.
“ Whaur’s the money, onyway ?” said the
supercargo, “let’s get to business, Lannigan. Eh
mon, I’ve some verra fine beef for ye.”
“ Get the bag up out of the boat, Tariro,” said
the trader, “ it’s mighty frightened I was havin’
so much money in the house at wanst, wid all
them rowdy Yankee sailors from the whaleships
ashore here.”
• • •
There was a great crowd of natives on
deck —over a hundred—and the mate was swearing
violently at them for getting in his way. The
schooner was a very small vessel, and Motukoe
being her first place of call for cargo, she was in
light trim;, having only her trade and a little
ballast on board.
“Send those natives away from the galley,” he
called out to the cook, who was giving some of the
young women ship-biscuits in exchange for young
cocoanuts, “can’t you see the ship keeps flying up
in the wind with all those people for’ard !”
» « •
Hekemanu, Lannigan’s native “Man Jack,”
sat in the boat towing alongside, with the bag of
“ dollars ” at his feet. He and all the boat’s crew
were in the secret. Lannigan owned their souls;
besides, they all liked him on Motukoe.
Tariro stood for a moment beside the captain,
indulging in the usual broad “chaff,” and then
leaning over the rail she called out to Hekemanu :
Ta mai te taga tupe (“ give me the bag of
money.”)
The man for’ard hauled on the line to bring the
boat alongside the schooner, and Hekemanu stood
up with the heavy bag in his hand.
“ Hold on there, you fool. If you drop that bag
I’ll knock your head off,” said the skipper.
“Here, Mr. Bates, just you jump down and take
that money from that native or he’ll drop it, sure.”
Before Hekemanu had time to let it fall over the
side the mate had jumped into the boat and
taken it.
Lannigan, putting his head up out of the little
cabin, groaned inwardly as he saw the mate step
over the rail with the fateful bag and hand it to
the supercargo.
“ Be the powers, ye’re in a mighty hurry for the
money,” said Lannigan roughly, taking it from
him, “ye might ax me if I had a mouth on me
first.”
The supercargo laughed and put a bottle of gin
on the table, and Lannigan’s fertile brain com-
menced to work. If he could only get the super-
cargo out of the cabin for a minute he meant to
pick up the bag, and declaring he was insulted
get it back into his boat and tell him to come and
count it ashore. Then he could get capsized on
the reef and lose it. They were always having
“ barneys ’ and it would only be looked upon as
one of his usual freaks.
.
“What the deuce is that? he said,
pointing to a hideous, highly-coloured paper mask
that hung up in the cabin.
The supercargo handed it to him. “It’s for a
man in Samoa—a silly, joking body, always play-
ing pranks wi’ the natives, and I thoct he would
like the thing.”
“ Bedad, ’tis enough to scare the sowl out av
the divil, said Lannigan.
Just then a mob of natives came aft, and the
two men in the cabin heard the captain tell them
to clear out again. They were saucy and wouldn’t
go. Hekemanu had told them of the failure of
Lannigan’s dodge, and they had an idea that the
ship would take him away, and stood by to rescue
him at the word of command.
“ I’ll verra soon hunt them, said the super-
cargo, with a proud smile, and he put the mask
on his face. Tariro made a bolt on deck and called
out to the natives that the supercargo was going
to frighten theriTwith a mask.
# # »
Instead of wild yells of fear, and jumping
overboard, as he imagined would happen, the
natives merely laughed, but edged away for’ard.
The schooner was in quite close to the reef; the
water was very deep, and there was no danger of
striking. She was under jib and mainsail only,
but the breeze was fresh and she was travelling at a
great rate. The wind being right off the land, the
skipper was hugging the reel as closely as possible,
so as to bring up and anchor on a five-fathom
patch about a mile away.
“ Here, quit that fooling,” he called out to the
supercargo, “and come aft, you fellows. The
ship is that much down by the head she won t pay
off, with the helm hard up_.
One look at the crowd of natives and another at
the shore, and a wild idea came into Lannigan s
head. He whispered to. Tariro, who went up
for ard and said something to the natives. In
another ten seconds some of them began to
clamber out on the jibboom, the rest after them.
“ Come back 1 ” yelled the skipper, jamming the
helm hard up, as the schooner flew up into the
wind. “Leggo peak halyards. By G—d ! we
are running ashore. Leggo throat halyards, too.
The mate flew to the halyards, and let go first
the peak and then the throat halyards; but it was
too late, and, .with a swarm of natives packed
together for ard from the galley to the end of the
jibboom, she stuck her nose down, and, with
stern high out of the water, like a duck chasing
flies, she crashed into the reef—ran ashore dead to
No one was drowned. The natives took
good care of the captain, mate, and supercargo,
and helped them to save all they could. But
Lannigan had a heavy loss—the bag of copper
bolts had gone to the bottom.
The captain and supercargo had very strong
suspicions, but, as Lannigan was their host and
practically their ruler during the three months
they remained on Motukoe, they said nothing.
But they gave him a wide berth afterwards.

Colemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Ex. is the strongest.
Ever since millionaire Astor took over the
Pall Mall Gazette to “ get on to ” that paper
is the highest ambition of every London journalist
—every sordid one, anyway. The general pay
there is many per cent, more than elsewhere; and
if the matter is very good the salary is ladled out
with both hands. At first Astor fixed the amount
to be “ lost ” at £12,000 a-year, but the loss
threatens to overstep J 120,000. Which, altogether,
is a goodly sum to pay for the privilege of living
in a foreign country and buttressing a throne.
Colemane & Sons’ Eucal. Loz. are for the voice.
“Jim Griffin’s horse ” has “ revolushed ”
Northern Tasmania. Years ago, when the
Launceston-Deloraine railway was proposed, the
farmers along the route promised, if the line
didn’t pay interest on cost of construction, to
submit to a railway tax. The tax was imposed,
but, in the two decades or so of interval, the
farmers changed their minds, and now refuse to
pay. Then “Jim Griffin’s horse” was seized for
arrears of tax and auctioned at Deloraine. Not a
solitary bid. Then at Westbury. Same result.
So the animal was removed to Launceston and
advertised for sale on a certain date. By that
morning’s early train came down “Griffinites”
galore. They paraded the streets, carrying a
large coffin, bearing on each side the legend :
“Eor the man that buys Jim Griffin’s horse.”
Nobody wanted to inhabit the coffin, and the
“ lot ” remained unsold. And at latest advices
“ Jim Griffin’s horse ” was still going to and fro
on the face of the earth in a vain search for a pur-
chaser.
Colemane & Sons’ Yic. Ointment is marvellous
The barque Loongana brings news from
the Gilbert Islands that the three years drought
still continues and the traders are reduced to the
awful necessity of drinking neat gin (sold to them
at 500 per cent profit) instead of the temperance
cocoanut. A private letter to a Sydney resident
from a trader at Butatitari states that the white
residents, who, in the main, howled enthusias-
tically over the annexation of the group, have been
disenchanted of the glory of living under British
rule by High Commissioner Thurston, who has in-
terfered with many of their little privileges to an
alarming extent. According to the letter, Thurston
“ is made a god of by the native missionaries and
sucks in all they tell him like a sponge. ” The
writer adds, more in sorrow than in anger : “ We
will have to knuckle down to the native teachers
now with a vengeance or get yanked off the islands
as undesirable residents. 1 went on board the
Sydney trading steamer the other day and when
Igothomemy wife told me that the native teacher’s
wife had been in and asked her to find out if
my breath smelt of gin, so that I could be fined.
Hard, isn’t it ? (Think of a white man being offi-
cially smelt by a saved Kanaka —the ignominy of
it). . , . The Yankee firm have sold out to
the Dutchmen at Jaluit and now there is nothing
for us poor devils to ,do but get goods from the
Sydney firms and bilk them instead of helping to
bilk the natives.”

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Stubbs, the “stick-hunter,” jumped out
of his hammock. “Hold on, Dan ! I know
where you’re qff to, and what I say is—don’t go!”
Dan Dickson turned short round with the door-
screen raised in his hand. “Look here, my little
man 1 you’ve been so long pottering about after
mashing-sticks for your London Chollies and
Johnnies that you’ve lost what little nerve you
Cockneys ever have!”
Little Stubbs grinned good-naturedly at the
notion. “ Walking-canes may be trifles, my lad,
but wild men and wild beasts ain’t trifles—nor
fever and dysentery, pizen-plants and pizen-rep-
tiles. And them’s the little chances the stick-
hunter’s got to take. Just you wait, my bold
Bananalander, till you’ve been as long in this here
bloomin’ Borneo ”
But the young Queenslander was off. Im-
patiently disdaining the ladder, he swung his
lanky six feet of carcase off the platform by his
hands and vanished amongst the fan-palms.
“Down river !” said Stubbs, looking after him.
“ It’s old Saji’s daughter he’s going to meet, Mr.
Beekley.”
“ Bad ! ” said the naturalist, glowering over his
spectacles.
“ And she’s promised to Tanga’s son—Tanga of
Bruti Island. Bao-Lu, the fellow’s name is, and,
as he’s hunted heads for the girl, this is like to be
a parang-business, or worse ! It ain’t here as it is
up Brunei way or over near the Dutch settle-
ments—these chaps won’t stand any dashed non-
sense about their women. If Dan won’t hear
reason, Dan’s a goner—and that’s all about it! ”
Out of a fragrant undergrowth—frangi-
panis and azaleas —stood up, slim and solitary, a
scarlet-crowned sterculia. Dan caught its blaze
against the sapphire sky, and halted cautiously
within the jungle-margin.
“There’s the red-headed tree—that’s the place !
And the sun’s abreast of the bamboo-tops—that’s
the time ! But where’s Balasi ? ” And then
Balasi answered for herself, creeping wild-eyed
out of the blossomy tangle, and pointing him
imperatively back by the way he had come.
He didn’t understand —or wouldn’t! “That
be hanged !” he muttered. “Now, I’m here, I’m
not going back without a kiss ! ” And, with the
words, a smacking kiss he got, as a rotten mud-
fish, aimed skillfully from the bamboo-clump,
landed square on his mouth and plastered him to
the eyes with greasy abomination.
Balasi fled squawking out amongst the man-
groves of the river; Dan clawed the stuff from
his eyes, whipped out his Smith-and-Wesson, and
glared every way but the right one, for, from
behind, a swift hand gripped him by the ankle,
and down he went upon his nose ! A knee was
on his pistol-arm in a moment, but hardly was the
weapon wrenched away before the Queenslander
was on his feet again—a sinewy twelve-stone of
astonished fury. But the Dyak—weight tor
weight—is probably the strongest man in all the
world. Two nines, or thereabouts, gave the white
man six stone the worst of it, and down he went
again, with a jabbering little yellow-skin on each
elbow. Round leg and arm went then the rapid,
lithe rattan—and Dan was done !
Struggling no more, he looked up at his captors.
Naked to the loin-cloth, bareheaded, weaponless
—these two saddle-coloured rascals couldn’t be
jealous, at any rate; for Dyak pride of birth
is mighty, and Balasi was a chief’s niece.
But then from the bamboos issued a resplendent
figure, and Dan understood. This must be Bao-
Lu; for Bao—like the professional assassin else-
where—was an exquisite of the first water. About
his conical rattan hat stood up a row of sun-bird
feathers, crimson and yellow; crimson, too, and
yellow his silk sarong; uncountable the graduated
rings—from finger-size to bracelet—that fringed
his ears around. His ihlang-sheath was bedight
with green-dyed human hair; his cloak was of
mias-skin, with grinning mask attached ; his tur-
meric-tinted hide was like brand-new pigskin;
and like night the blackness of his sinka-stained
teeth. Beneathhis turned-up nosegrew that dearly-
coveted Dyak distinction—a twenty-haired mous-
tache.
This gorgeous vision gazed for a minute
on the prostrate white man. Then it spoke—first,
Malay, which to Dan was Hebrew ; Dyak, then —
and here and there the captive caught a word he
knew. Something about “blood” he gathered,
and a “swamp,” and “water;” then two more
Dyaks trotted up, and Dan’s heart stood still a
moment as, at a word from the chief, the four men
hoisted him, log-like, on their shoulders. “ The
swamp?” he thought. “The crocodiles, of
course?” and, at the notion, with a frantic jerk
he rolled his trussed-up body clean over the heads
of the two men on one side of him. But rattan
lashings hold like steel; the Dyaks laughed, picked
him up again, and went on.
* • •
The sun went down in a lurid haze ; every
leaf was still as cast-iron; the white cranes
mourned and the trumpet-frogs jubilated, as the
swift tropic night marched over from Celebes.
Beekley went to his barometer. “Blow from the
westward before long !” he said, and, even as he
spoke, the far-away screech of the Sumatra came
faintly over the blackening ocean. Two minutes
more, and the top-knot of the lofty tappan before
the house was thrashing the reeds out of the
thatch—there was a shriek as of a thousand buzz-
saws—a fusillade of branches and pebbles—and the
squall had gone yelling away into the east. Then
both men started, as, out of the tomb-like succeed-
ing silence, there arose a sudden cry—weird and
inarticulate, but human.
“Dan!” said the stick-hunter, and out he
rushed upon the platform. Nobody there; but
again came the voice—from 'below. Beokley
brought out the lamp, held it over, and saw a
ghastly face. “Take the light!” he said, and
went down.
At the ladder-foot lay Dan, stripped to the
waist, and around him the ground was red with
something that smoked horribly in the lamp-
light. Between them they got him up the ladder;
Beekley gave him brandy, and Stubbs looked at
his wounds —all small, but all bleeding.
“What devil’s work is this?” said the stick-
hunter. “Thorns?”
“No ! ” said Beekley, “ leeches I See?”—and
he pointed to half-a-dozen of the yellow-striped
bloodsuckers still hard at work. “Not much
chance for the poor chap, I’m afraid ! But give
him some more brandy, and perhaps he’ll be able
to tell us something about this.”
The brandy did its work, and presently Dan
told them how, by Bao-Lu and company, he had
been stripped to the waist and dumped up to the
neck in a leech-swamp—fastened by the wrists to
an overhanging spiderwood. When the squall
came it snapped the branch, whereupon Dan had
struggled out and made for home, but had been
too far gone to get up the ladder.
When the sun came round again he found the
good-natured little Cockney blubbering freely over
a hole he was making under the shade of the
big tappan. Beekley came out and looked down
at him. “ That’ll do I” he said, softly. “ Won’t
be wanted, after all I ” Stubbs dropped his
chunkal and scurried up the ladder. “I knew
you were a slap-up doctor 1” he said. “ How did
you pull him through ?”
“It was Youth that pulled him through 1 Had
it been your case or mine, that hole would have
been wanted by this time ! ”
ALEX.MONTGOMERY.
FOUR HOURS TOO LATE.
“ Oh, Ood lif I could recall the past three or four
hours. £ee what trouble a man may bring upon
himself all in a moment .”
Mr. James Curtis and Mr. G. S. Bennett, both
of San Francisco, had been intimate friends for
years. Last summer they quarrelled for the first
time, each accusing the other of wrong. Better
thoughts prevailed and they were reconciled.
But you can’t undo what is once done. Memory
kept the record on her slate. They avoided each,
other as much as possible. Still, living as neigh-
bours, men must meet some time. These two met
in the street. The quarrel was renewed. Bitter
words flew fast and thick, and Curtis, beside him-
self with rage, drew his pistol and shot Bennett
dead on the spot. Later in the day he used the
above language—so laden with self-reproach and
sorrow. Yet how useless, how hopeless, how
vain.
But was Curtis right in saying that trouble may
come all in a moment ? True, it often seems so,
but is there not a deeper fact which we don’t see?
It matters nothing what the nature of the trouble
is. Therefore, let us consider a different case on
the same principle.
An intelligent woman says :—“ In October,
1890, I had an attack of illness from which I never
expected to recover. I had aching pains all over
me and a cough that nearly shook me to pieces.
I obtained no good sleep night or day, and had to
take to my bed. I was fed with liquid food from
an invalid’s cup, for I could not raise myself in
bed. My heart fluttered so you could hear it beat
on the pillow, and often pain struck through it as
though somebody had stabbed me. I lay perfectly
helpless and could scarcely breathe. A doctor
attended me over a month, but I grew weaker and
weaker. Sometimes at night I was so bad he
feared I would not live till morning. He called in
a consulting physician and both agreed that my
condition was critical. I was fed with brandy to
keep me alive. My husband and daughter stayed
with me almost constantly. None of the medicines
administered had any effect. I was almost at
death’s door,
“ At this time, Mrs. Keeling, of Mutley, near
Plymouth, a friend of mine, urged me to try a
medicine called Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup.
I procured a bottle, and after a few days I was
able to take and digest sufficient food to give me
some strength, and the worse symptoms were
greatly abated. After having used six bottles of
the Syrup my health was completely restored, and
I have since felt better than for the previous thirty
years. _ My two daughters have also been cured
of indigestion by it. I will gladly answer any
enquiries.”
(Signed) Mrs. Louise Jackson, Builders’Arms
Hotel, Bridge Road, Hammersmith, London,
Jan. 11th, 1892.
In the letter, from which the above is an extract,
Mrs. Jackson further states that for over twenty
years before the attack of October, 1890, she had
suffered from a disordered stomach and liver.
She had a bad taste in the mouth, a poor appetite,
and what little she ate gave her pain. She felt
dull, languid, and tired, and had a miserable
sinking feeling in the stomach, great pain in the
chest and sides, palpitation, giddiness, and fre-
quently fell in the street and had to be assisted
home.
So we perceive that in her case a cause, long in
operation, at last produced the crisis which came
near ending her life. It is always thus, whether
we recognise the cause or not. The crime com-
mitted by Curtis was the sudden passionate act of
a man who allowed thoughts of hate and vengeance
to take possession of his mind and breed the con-
dition which made murder possible. In the very
different case of this lady’s illness it was an enemy
of her body, indigestion and dyspepsia, which at
length broke out into violence.
The lesson is the same. Watch the beginning
of evil and check it while yet jit may be easily
controlled.

h may have been a fragment of that higher
Truth dreams , at times , disclose ;
It may have been to Fond Illusion nigher —
But thus the story goes:
A fierce sun glared upon a gaunt land, stricken
With barrenness and thirst,
Where Nature’s pulse with joy of Spring would
quicken
No more ; a land accurst.
Grey salt-bush grimmer made the desolation—
Like mocking immortelles
Strewn on the graveyard of a perished nation
Whose name no record tells.
No faintest sign of distant water glimmered
The aching eye to bless ;
The far horizon like a sword’s edge shimmered,
Keen, gleaming, pitiless.
And all the long day through the hot air
quivered
Beneath the burning sky,
In dazzling dance of heat that dashed and
shivered.
It seemed as if hard by
The borders of this region, evil-favoured,
Life ended, Death began ;
But no; upon the plain a shadow wavered—
The shadow of a man.
What man was this by Fate or Folly driven
To cross the dreadful plain ?
A pilgrim poor ? or Ishmael unforgiven ?
The man was Andy Blane.
A stark old sinner, and a stout, as ever
Blue swag has carried through
That grim, wild land men name the Never-
Never,
Beyond the far Barcoo.
His strength was failing now, but his unfailing
Strong spirit still upbore
And drove him on with courage yet unquailing,
In spite of weakness sore.
When, 10, beside a clump of salt-bush lying,
All suddenly he found
A stranger, who, before his eyes, seemed dying
Of thirst—without a sound.
Some weave their web’of life well, and some
weave ill ;
One saves, one damns his soul,
But Andy was, for either good or evil,
A Man, complete and whole.
And so, beside the stranger on the sandy
Salt plain—a death-bed sad—

“Let ua pass on I" As brother might with
brother
So went they, side by side ;
Until the fierce sun, like an eyeball bloody
Eclipsed in death, was seen
No more, and in the spaces of the west, still
ruddy,
A star shone out serene.
As one, then, whom some memory beguiling
May gladden, too, and grieve,
The stranger, pointing up, said, sadly smiling,
“The Star of Christmas Eve 1 ”
Andy replied not. Unto him the sky was
All reeling stars —his breath
Came thick and fast—and life an empty lie was,
True one thing only—Death.
Beneath the moonlight; with the weird, wan
glitter
Of salt-bush all around,
He lay; but by his side in that dark, bitter,
Last hour, a friend he found.
Thank God !” he said, “ He’s acted more
than square, mate,
By me in this —and I’m
A Rip. . . . God must have known X was—
well, there, mate—
A White Man all the time.
To-morrow’s Christmas Day : He knows where
I’ll be
By then— l don’t—but you
Away from this d—d place should many a mile
be,
At Blake’s on the Barcoo.
“You take this cheque there—they will cash
it, sonny. . . .
It meant my Christmas spree. . . .
And do just what you like best with the money,
In memory of me. ”
The stranger, smiling, with a little leaven
Of irony, said, “ Yea,
But there it shall not be. With me, in Heaven,
You’ll spend your Christmas Day.”
Then that old heathen, that grey back-block
stager,
Half-jestingly replied,
And laughed—and laughed again—’“Mate, it’s
a wager !”
And, grimly laughing, died.

St. Peter stood at the celestial portal,

Beauty of Hilton’s Cove
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The lady is dead. The first families of the Point,
the Bay, the Cove and the Head remember her
well—the males, because a man has eyes for a
lovely woman, old or young; the women-folk,
because jealousy has memory. And, poor thing,
when all is told up, totalled and tallied, debited
and credited, God knows she was not happy
enough in her lot to be envded.
This is her story. Ike Hilton was an “old
hand,” and his wife was of the same sort. They
were both sent out, and Mrs. Hilton was confined
on the voyage. The circumstances of their trans-
portation need not be recalled, but as it is cus-
tomary to christen sea-born children after the
ship in which they first see light, Miss Hilton
was named Mary Ann Queen of Beauty, shortened
afterwards to Beauty Hilton. Here let me caution
Potts Pointers against double and treble names,
if one of them can be found in the list of convict
or even emigrant ships.
Hilton became rich, honestly or dishonestly;
honest people use the latter adverb, but, on the
contrary, others say otherwise. Naturally, Ike
and his missus died of rum. Rum at home caused
their exile, rum in Sydney freed them, rum made
them and their property, and rum killed them.
Hilton was a humorist in his way, and pretty
straight except for his crookedness. So he called
his home at Hilton’s Cove by the name of Tom-
ford House, alleging that he came from Paddle-
wyke, near Tomford, in Kent, His run on the
Bunkum Creek, near Bongowlali mine, he called
Paddlewyke Park, because it wasn’t a park; but
the Mortynes opposite had Gylone Park.
Before Mrs. Hilton (always called Mother
Hilton about the Bunkum) died, she and Beauty
lived a good deal at Paddlewyke, and Rollo
Mortyne was often a visitor. No doubt Beauty
was with his grand appearance, and
naturally fell in love with him. In her own simple
language she would have called it being “ shook ”
on him. Then she had a sneaking affection for
Tom Ray, the overseer, but hated his chum, the
storekeeper. The latter was quite a character.
No doubt he was a qualified surgeon, but whether
boundary-riding, burr-cutting or droving he did
not like being called Doctor, and just suffered his
mates to address him as Doc. Smiler, because he
oould not stop it,
I think it was in ’67 or ’6B that Beauty got her
smash. They were kangarooing; the three of
them, Ray, Doc. and Beauty. An “ old man ”
turned just as Beauty got up to him and down the
three came; the horse and kangaroo dead, and the
other next door to it.
That night Mrs. Hilton thanked the Lord, if
the prayed, that there was a surgeon ready to
tnend poor Beauty’s face: and that night Ray and
the doctor had a consultation. It seemed that
the overseer was trying to induce his chum to
test tome new treatment for the speedy recovery
of the—l was going to say girl—but I’ll call her
woman ; she was 27 at least.
Next day, Mr. Smiler asked the mother and
nurse to leave the room, whilst he dressed the face-
wounds, saying that he should have to extract
some splinters and earth, and would put the lady
under chloroform. He said the operation was
painless, but not pleasant to see. Miss Hilton
was conscious and consented (knowing that her
looks depended on good healing of the wounds)
to the withdrawal of her mother, if the servant
maid, who was a good nurse, would hold her
head.
It did not take long, and Beauty became, after
the plastic treatment of Doc, Smiler, just as ugly
as she had been lovely. Her mouth was twisted
and one eye drooped, and she had a grin—l can
only call it that—which was simply horrible.
There were no visits to Sydney now, and Rollo
Mortyne was told not to call again. Then Mr.
Ray married Beauty. It was no love-match on
either side; in a quiet way they lived comfortably
enough until the death of Mrs. or Mother Hilton.
But there was another death in the house—that of
the old doctor. Both Ray and his wife were at
his bedside when he had his final encounter with
a bad case—his own. He had become partially
paralysed, and was stuttering and gurgling:
“Another operation—Beauty again.” Ray put
this down to raving, but Mrs. Ray pondered.
Next year was that of the Bingiegong railway
accident. In one of the carriages, playing nap.
and winning, was a young squatter, who, in one
cut, lost all. His wife was called to the inquest,
and had, for a moment, to show her face.
Now, there was present a young surgeon called
Mortyne, brother of our Bunkum neighbour, who
showed more than ordinary civility to Mrs. Ray :
he was of the modern school, and plainly told her
that her face had been tampered with. Old Hilton
would have called it “faked.” And the great
surgeon, Mr. O’Kelly, from Sydney, was con-
sulted. With very little trouble, and a short
trip to Tasmania, our Beauty was restored.
It was a strangely-lovely classic face that
again' took Rollo Mortyne’s attention, and
it was now accompanied by a splendid
dot. You have all heard how the Mor-
tynes were dried and fried out of Queens-
land. It is even stated that after the banks had
foreclosed and sold them up,the rain came down,
when they were leaving Gylone, causing them to
get bogged in the horse-paddock. This second
marriage, too, was not so lucky or happy.
Mortyne heard about the temporary aberration of
comeliness from his brother, and even twitted
his wife with it. Of course, a woman who has
been a ghoul for a year or two knows how to be
nasty. Then Mortyne drank and died, leaving a
lovely widow and a son.
As I said, she died and that’s her story. Fifty
years hence her son, or grandson, Duncan
Mortyne, of Paddlewyke Park (which, doubtless,
hell change to Gylone Chase), will be making a
family tree. I bequeath him this history, for a
start. He will then very likely be Sir Duncan
Ray Mortyne, or, perhaps, my Lord Redeviva, of
Castle Turnford and Gylone Hall.

THE BEST
BEVERAGE
FOR
CHILDREN
Absolutely fure.
CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and vigour to growing children, and
those of delicate constitutions.
Two Showman’s Stories.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
"THE DAUGHTER OF A CLERGYMAN.”
Daisy Dome was very poor, very shabby,
very pretty, when she made her first application
for a situation to a theatrical manager. She must
have had histrionic talent, or this story would
never have been told.
Her manners were tender, nob to say alluring.
The manager felt inclined to engage her. The
manageress, when she heard that Daisy was “ the
daughter of a clergyman,” decided the point with
an emphatic affirmative.
The company took her measure variously. The
ladies held that she was “dangerous,” and
promptly ignored her. The men —the average
actor, in private life, is an intellectual pigmy
hearing her jabber scraps of Latin and French,
reverenced her as a prodigy of learning.
The leading man only expressed the lofty ambi-
guity—” Well, she knows how to kiss.”
The manager said she was “genteel;” the
manageress triumphantly recommended hat in the
words—“ She is a clergyman’s daughter.”
Hartley, the stage-manager, a widower with a
large family and small means, saw more of her
than anyone else, and summed her up enthusias-
tically—“ Exceptionally intellectual and a perfect
lady.”
Hartley spared neither time nor patience in
drilling her into “understanding” parts, taught
her all the “tricks” and “business” he knew,
and felt repaid for hours of drudgery by a tender
glance from her “ pathetic brown eyes.” Nobody
else ever found her eyes “ pathetic.” To Hartley
“ pathetic eyes ” were irresistible.
Daisy Dome was humbly and visibly grateful
for the stage-manager’s patience and encourage-
ment, and took childlike pains to please him.
* * *
Rehearsal was over. The company had
gladly cleared out of the stuffy premises. Hartley
was collecting books and turning out bunch-ligh ts,
when he caught sight of a disconsolate-looking
figure crouched in a corner.
“ Not gone home yet, little woman ! ”
“No, Mr. Hartley. It’s raining, and I have no
umbrella.”
“Let me get you one. There, don’t cry. Is
that all the trouble ? ”
“Oh, it’s very hard. We are so poor, dear
mamma and I. It’s so wretched. People sneer
at my shabbiness, and sometimes I feel like giving
up altogether. I want to get on. You have been
so good in helping me, but it is all so difficult, and
ray salary is so small.”
‘ ‘ Cheer up, my poor child. I have been through
it all. I know it all by heart. Don’t lose courage.
You are in a good theatre. You have youth,
beauty and talent; it’s only a question of time
and the world will be at your feet.”
“Oh, Mr. Hartley, it is so good of you to
encourage poor little me.”
“Now, look here, don’t be offended. If it’s
money that bothers you, let me help you. I’m
not well off,'but I’ve saved a little. I’m old
enough to be your father.”
“ You are nob old. Forty is a lovely age for a
man. ’’
Hartley was 56, wore a wig, and looked every
day 66. He was about to stammer out a confes-
sion when Daisy said, “ Don’t interrupt me, sir.
You are the best and dearest—oh, oh, what am I
saying ? Perhaps you wouldn’t mind taking me
home to dear mamma ?”
* * *
The manageress heard with kindly plea-
sure of the small legacy left to Daisy’s mamma
“ by a dear old college chum of poor father,” since
it enabled “the clergyman’s daughter ” to emerge
from, her chrysalis of shabbiness without a “ rise ”
in salary.
“ lb is a good thing you know how to dress, my
dear; it is. the first essential of a successful
actress.”
Hartley’s little hoardings decreased as Daisy’s
wardrobe expanded. At last came a day when
he, with shamefaced awkwardness, was obliged
to confess his inability to supply any more wants.
The brown eyes lost their pathetic tenderness.
“ I cannot have a new dress and I am to recite
at Bishopscourb before the best people ?”
The commonplaces of the scene that followed
may be easily understood. Hartley at last
pleaded the needs of his family, and that he was
in debt already.
“ If you care for your children best, why do you
want to marry me? I understand. It was a
speculation on your part. I was a profitable in-
vestment for your old age. lam to work to keep
you and your encumbrances. Since I now under-
stand your mercenary spirit, there is an end to
everything.”
“ Daisy ! ! ”
“ Please don’t make a scene. You are too old
for that sort of thing. A withered old sinner of
70! Pah!”
She stalked off like the real actress she was.
# « «
Hartley, after the first shock of his en-
lightenment, braced up his manhood, and vowed
to work all the harder for his family. “lb is
lucky I know the worst,” he said, self-consolingly.
If he had bub left it at that, it might have
been “the worst.”
* * •
The papers gave a glowing account of
Miss Daisy Dome’s success at Bishopscourb, and
one or two society scribblers described minutely
the charming toilette worn by her on the occasion.
“ Where could she have gob it?” thought Hart-
ley.
Soon she drove to rehearsals in a well-appointed
brougham.
“Dear father’s relations have relented,” she
told the manageress, who now began herself to see
an “ investment ”in “ the clergyman’s daughter.”
Hartley, who had heard from “dear mamma”
the whole family pedigree, listened to the news,
when it flittered to him, with icy gloom. As she
was leaving the theatre that afternoon, he drew
her gently into his office, and closed the door.
“ Why did you tell Mrs. Oarr-Burton that lie ?
Do you think you are deceiving me as well as the
others ? Daisy, you do nob know the end of all
this? For your own sake, don’t go to utter
ruin !”
She looked at him with cold blankness, and
then laughed hardly, while he shuddered.
“I had no idea you drank,” she said. “Try
and keep it from the management.”
Then she swept out, leaving him utterly as-
tonished.
. , . . .
Hartley stood in the manager’s room, a cheque
and open letter in his hand,
“I have been 15 years with you, Mr. Oarr-
Burton, and—this, without any reason ?”
“ Really, Hartley, now, we’re very sorry, bub,
after your disgraceful insult bo Miss Daisy Dome,
we had no alternative.”
“ Disgraceful insult ?”
“ There, there. Take the pledge, old man. In
consideration of your long and faithful service,
we have persuaded Miss Dome to keep it all
quiet. It’s really a police matter, you know, and
we’re risking a good deal on your behalf.”
Hartley lefb the room, completely dazed.
, * •
.. ~ ~ , ,
“ Can there be any doubt? said the
manager to the manageress. “ 1 would like to
believe old Hartley.”
“I would bake the word of an innocent child
like Daisy before that of fifty hardened old stagers
like Hartley. You forget, my dear, that she is
tha daughter of a clergyman I”
“OUT OF THE COMMON."
Old Bill Sclater was born “ unconven-
tional.” When he first saw light, it was found
that nature had equipped him with six toes to
each foot. As he grew up many offers were made
bo him by travelling menagerie-men to go on
salary as a “ freak,” bub his temperament was so
inordinately “unconventional” that ho declined
every temptation, so as to be “ out of the com-
mon.” The same abnormal twist in his nature
had led him to shine as a meteoric offender against
the law at various periods. I had heard of Bill,
but I didn’t know all this then.
Business was in a torpor, when I heard that
Bill was at Oakeyville, a remote mining town, and
I conceived the idea that a 12-toed man would fill
a then-existing gap in the show line.
After a 50-mile ride, I reached a place where
the track forked into two. A slab humpy, half-
concealed by a clump of trees, was visible, and I
rode over to make enquiries.
Against a doorpost leaned an angular youth,
dirty with a month’s abhorrence of water, his
head thatched with long, straight, fibrous hair,
From inside the hub came a continuous chaos of
hilarity.
“ Which is the road to Oakeyville 7 "
“That there one,” said the dirty angularity
with an unreadable shift of his head.
“ Which is ‘that there one?’”
“ You keep to the right ’’—savagely.
An inspiration !
“ S’pose you haven’t a drop of liquor handy 7”
The angularity raised his voice.
“I ain’t smelt grog,” he shouted, solemnly,
“for nigh on six munts, let alone basted it,”
A grizzled head and face appeared in the door-
way and was thrust over his right shoulder. After
an investigation of myself and trappings, the
grizzled head opened :
“Now, ain’t yer a awful liar, Boko7 What
the (polyglot gutturals) d’yer want to bluff the
young un for ? 'E ain’t no cop. Get off yer ’orse,
young feller, an’ jine me.”
I dropped: down without a second invitation and
entered the shanty, taking no notice of Boko’s
mnfflflrl nrnl«ia
muffled protests.
The grizzled man handed me a pannikin of rum.
“Now, yer don’t know me, do yer? No.
Well, I didn’t espect yer would. You arst these
coves who I am ; they know.”
“ These coves ” were three fairly good replicas
°f “Boko,” and were drunkenly sprawling on
?ne canvas stretcher. Two of them only grinned
knowingly. The third said—“ The old un’s a
fair daisy, be cripes I”
} Yer don t know me, but p r aps yer’ve ’eard
0
J, shook ray head.
. Dam queer I Ive been m quod fourteen
times, I have ; and broke out of quod five times,
You arst the copmen if they knows old Bill
Sclater, ’n’ see what they say.”
Here was luck ! I had tapped the vein with the
orst stroke of the pick. I drank a pannikin with
the daisy.” I slapped him on the back.
So you’re Bill Sclater? Why, I’ve heard of
Bill Sclater all over the country!”
“’Ave yer, young feller?”
“ Everywhere, s’w’elp me I”
“Now, what ’ave yer ’eard about me?”
“I’ve heard that you can carry more liquor to
the square inch than any other man in tha
(flaming) country.”
“Correct. Pub it there, young feller,” giving
me one of his huge paws.
• V 8 heard of you as a boss fighter, a boss
miner, an’ the smartest (crimson) cattle-duffer
that——”
“Rybuck! Put it there, young feller.”
“I’ve heard that you grow six toes on each
foot.”
“ By Cord ! young un; pub it there.”
“You’re the only man in the country that can
brag that, anyway,”
“You’re right, young feller. Bub it’s an un-
lucky brag. D’yer know what I’m a-goin’ ter
do?”
“ What ? "
“ Out two toes off, an’ then kill somebody,
That’ll be out o’ the common, won’t it? Them
(torrid) toes give me away to the copmen every
trip,”
“ By gum ! don’t you out ’em off, Bill.”
“ Why ? ”
“ Why ? Why, they’re worth a fortune to you.”
“ How ?”
“Go on show.”
“My ( —)!” roared Bill; as he
gripped me by the back of the neck with a hand
that felt like a spring-trap, and turned me slowly
round. His grisly form dilated, and he seemed
about to burst, while his heaving chest and throat
showed how sternly he was repressing himself.
At last, his voice came—hard, sarcastic, measured.
It even omitted the higher profanities,
“Yer damned skunk ! I’ve been waitin’ a hell
of a time for one of your sorb. When I let that
Italian bloke go who wanted me ter show my feet
ter women an’ kids, an’ offered ter pay me wages
for it, I swore it ’ud be the last I’d let off.”
“I was . . . only . . . joking , . .
Mister . . . S—S—Sclater 1” I gasped.
“lb don’t matter a curse if you was. I’m a-
goin’ to kill a man an’ it may as well be a blasted
showm ”
His voice died out suddenly. I remember no
more. The doctor says lam nob to ask questions
as to how I came to the hospital until I am quite
strong.
