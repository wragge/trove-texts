COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearue’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned.have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, "Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully. J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

THE TERRIFIC TWINGES
Endured by Rheumatics are first soothed

that beneficient annihilator of pain
and preventitive of its return,
Canadian Healing Oil,
a combination of six medicinal oils, devoid
of alcohol, and consequently non-evapor-
ating when applied. Economic, because
little of it is usually required to produce
the desired effects, and the small cost of
which is rendered doubly insignificant by
contrast with the salutary results which it
achieves. It is equally safe whether taken
internally or externally, is applicable to
diseases and injuries of horses and cattle,
as well as to man, and exterminates Throat

Piles, Tumors, Sores, and a great num-
ber of other physical ailments.

Buchu Bitters.,
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given, in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from,
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters 1 also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic •
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affection's. The action of,
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on alls,
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbaU
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from. Skin,
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and i
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. :—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on -the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases ■
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D —BBBB-I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and a
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting digea,-
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and I
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.

—THE-
Universal Cure!
JUST LISTEN. We don’t trade on credit,
you know, we’re not built that way, and be it
understood that if any HIGH AND MIGHTY
PERSONS, who disdain the nimble ninepence,
and who, up to the present, have been unable to
persuade themselves TO PAY CASH for all they
buy, would now, on the instant, turn from the
error of their ways, and disburse as they go along,
or, in other words, scatter their bawbees when
they pick up the TEA AND JAM, they would be
richer in less than a BRACE of SHAKES.
Where they pay the DOWN TOWN tradesmen a
SHILLING a yard, and the suburban grocer
HALE-A-CROWN a pound, they would pive us
sevenpenc© halfpenny and on© and nine re-
spectively.
WHAT THINK YOU? Will you try ! You
who have' been battling with high prices for
years, you whose income has been continually
depleted by heavy charges, you who never looked
at the Price TILL THE BILL CAME IN, you
who have been worried to death by the arithmeti-
cal intricacies of dog’s-eared tally-books and long
drapers’ bills, will you not turn into the pleasant
pastures of SPOT GASH? SPOT Cash is the
universal cure, the one and only remedy for
financial disaster, and for a state of emptiness of
the family purse.

With Agonizing Eczemas and other Itching, Burning, Scaly, and
Blotchy Skin and Scalp Diseases are relieved in the majority of cases
by a single application of the Cuticura Remedies, and speedily, perma-
nently, and economically cured, when phy-
sicians, hospitals, and all other remedies
fail. Cuticura Remedies are the great-
est skin cures, blood purifiers, and humor
remedies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and may be used in the treatment of
every humor, from the simplest facial blem-
ishes to the severest diseases of the blood,
skin, and scalp.
The great Skin Cure, instantly allays the
most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, clears the scalp
of crusts and scales, speedily soothes and
heals raw and irritated surfaces, and restores
the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
Skin Purifier and Beautifier, is indispensa-
ble in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuti-
cura Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin
Purifier, and greatest of Humor Remedies,
cleanses the blood of all impurities and poi-
sonous elements, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Reme-
dies cure every disease and humor of the skin, from pimples to scrofula.

Various Verses,
AMONG THE PALMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN].
To save the past by one brave deed 1 (|
The time was “now,” the place “this spot.
Love-stifled rage importunes speed,
For Hate can thrive where Love will rot.
A noiseless step, a whispered word,
A man clasped in a woman’s arms 1
The white-faced watcher saw and heard,
And beckoned Death—among the palms.
He kissed a dagger’s silvered hilt —
Her gift once in the long ago ;
Then whisp’ring Heaven —“ Forgive her guilt!
He freed her with a single blow.
And who shall say ’twas ill or good
Who reads not the Recorder’s scroll.
An angel came and caught his blood ;
A devil laughed and took his soul.
I only see what might have been —
A girl locked in a dead man’s arms;
A traitor slain, a stain wiped clean—
Among the palms, among the palms.
N.S.W.
HESKETH.
OUR COMMENTATOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In a dingy little chamber, where the massive four-
post bed _ 'I
Seems annoyed because the ceiling presses closely
overhead,
Where the meat-safe crowds the washstand, and
the table crowds the chairs,
We engage in daily struggles with our literary
cares.
We are two aspiring authors who are striving all
we know
To earn enough to keep us till the talents that we
show
Shall gain us recognition— then we’ll take an extra
room
That shall mark our own advancement and “ Our
Commentator’s ” doom !
For we have a Commentator, one who chatters all
the time
When we need our whole attention for an awk-
ward bit of rhyme,
Keeps suggesting hopeless subjects, or inanely
volunteers
Some ridiculous perversion of our loftiest ideas ;
Who, though innocent of grammar and the rudi-
ments of verse,
Offers criticisms freely, which are usually adverse;
And insists on our explaining all discussions that
are rife;
And we have to grin and bear it—she’s the younger
author’s wife !
And she fancies she is helping and she shows a
marked delight
When an article’s accepted, or we get a tale to
write; , !
And when funds are at their lowest and there s
nothing for the pot,
She will pawn her Sunday petticoat as cheerfully
as not.
But, if she shares our troubles, she demands an
equal share I
Of anything that’s going when we’ve any cash to
spare; j
She claims a fair division of our beer and cigar-
ettes ; I
And ’tis not the smallest portion she invariably
gets !
And at times she’s very mournful and at others
very gay,
And which is most disturbing it is difficult to say,
For she’s generally saddest when we strike a
merry vein,
And particularly lively when we seek a solemn
strain !
When we’ve work that must be finished and we
have to sit up late,
The man who didn’t marry her must go outside
and wait
Until the lady goes to bed—but not, alas !to rest, ,
For it’s then “ Our Commentator ” is distinctly at
her best!
From behind the close-drawn curtains of the big, j
old-fashioned bed
She hurls her interruptions and her comments at
our head ;
If we won’t take any notice, then her face will
soon appear,
And she’ll give us her opinion of our efforts with
a sneer. j
But we worry through it, somehow, till at last the
work is done,
Which is very, very often at the rising of the sun ;
And, as the lucky husband shows his partner to ,
the door,
“ Our Commentator ” speeds him with a valedic-
t’ry snore! j

“ Yanhee Doodle, Mended with Politics,
The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
given later on.
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can teat the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford tc
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more Aim fican leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands“ CON-
QUEROR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE’
ranks supreme.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1895.
Premier Reid and Federation.
The almost-forgotten project of Australian
Federation was disinterred from its ashes
last week, when the Federal Enabling Bill
was quietly introduced in N.S.W. Assembly.
It is four years since the sitting of the first
Federal Conference and nearly one year
since the second one, and for most of that
time the federal project has peacefully slum-
bered. At each conference N.S. Wales led
the way, and after each conference that pro-
vince fell asleep so conspicuously that at
last the adjacent States decided to move no
further in the matter until something definite
was done by the Parliament at Sydney.
When that unexpected event happened the
Governments of Victoria, Tasmania, and
South Australia pledged themselves to fol-
low suit, so that the federal movement has
for a long while back been waiting until the
N.S.W. Government should see fit to take
some further interest in the matter. But
most politicians either regarded the subject
as dead, or had forgotten that it ever was
alive, and the appearance the other day of
the long-delayed measure was a considerable
surprise. Its reception was a sad and solemn
proceeding. Premier Reid certainly intro-
duced the scheme with the air of a man who
was in dead earnest, but thereafter a number
of members rose and stated in listless tones
that Federation was£a question in which
they took a great and living interest, and
added, with a weary aspect, that they had
always been enthusiastic in the matter.
Then the subject died standing, in a manner
of speaking, and the Bill which is intended
to make Austral a a nation was brought in
amid so little interest that it might almost
as well have been a Saturday night drunk
being carried into the lock-up on a wheel-
barrow.
• • •
Even at this early stage of the proceed-
ings, however, there are signs that the
curse of party politics is going to interfere.
Ex - Treasurer See asked contemptuously
whether tlie Federal Bill was worth intro-
ducing, and Lyne and CoPt.land demanded
that the House should abandon the workable
scheme agreed upon at the last conference’
and go back to the hopelessly unworkable
one devised by the Convention of ’9l. The
scheme of the ’9l conference was abandoned
not only by New South Wales but also by
all the other provinces, so that if one pro-
vince reverted to it the others would almost
certainly refuse to follow its example. Also,
the men who made it are almost all politi-
cally dead and gone, and some are personally
deceased as well. Even their names—
Pakkes, Dibbs, Jennings, Grey, Atkinson,
Griffith, MHlwraith, Macrossan, Play-
ford, Bray, Munro, Gillies, Shibls, and a
lot more—read like ancient history ; there
has been such a great and almost unani-
mous downfall among these constitution-
makers of ’9l that Australia has nearly
forgotten them along with their clumsy,
ill-devised project. The proposal that New
South Wales should go back all alone to
the forgotten ideas of four years ago, and
thereby compel the other provinces to do
likewise or else bring about another dead-
lock, is a fine sample of the brutal stupidity
of party politics. The Lyne party, it is
true, has some semblance of a grievance in
the matter. But for the ceaseless obstruc-
tion of the Opposition it might, or, again, it
might not, under the Dibbs Government of
1891-’94, have actually passed the original
Federal Bill, and then Lyne, Dibbs, Cope-
land and their friends might have gone down
to history among the Fathers of the Common-
wealth. But the country has not time to
consider the personal grievances of small
politicians, and the Government which lost
its opportunity, whether by its own fault or
not, must do without it. Nobody wants to
know now about what might have been but
wasn't, and no one cares about the merits,
whatever they might be, of the original Con-
vention scheme, because that scheme has
died and become impracticable through old
age. The one thing to be considered is that
there is a chance of carrying out a new
scheme now, provided the New South Wales
Legislature, wliich has so long blocked the
way, does not lose time mooning over the
dry bones of the past, and scattering recrimi-
nations about the personal grievances of its
members.
The present Federal scheme, of which
Premier Reid is one of the authors, is in-
comparably superior to the one which the
Dibbs Government failed to enact a year or
two ago. Under the original project a
certain Bill was to be submitted to the
various Parliaments of Australasia, and
when they all passed exactly the same
Bill, the Commonwealth would be estab-
lished. But it would be absolutely impos-
sible to prevent the various Parliaments
making alterations in the original measure,
and it would be equally impossible to induce
them all to make exactly the same altera-
tions, and the prospect of ever arriving at
entire unanimity was very remote indeed.
The device of the more recent Hobart con-
ference gets over this d.fiiculty. Each pro-
vince is to elect ten repres ntatives, and
these are to form a convention and draft a
constitution for the Commonwealth. If
New South Wales and only two other pro-
vinces adopt the constitution thus drafted
ttie Commonwealth will make a start as soon
afterwards as possible, the other provinces
being left to come in later on, as the dis-
advantages of isolation become more and
more apparent to them. There is no pro-
vision for amending the constitution before
the Commonwealth is started,’for to allow
amendments by the separate Parliaments
would simply be to bring about tire deadlock
wliich inevitably awaited the scheme of ’9l.
.The constitution must be wholly rejected, or
else accepted as it stands, however that may
be, and the Federal Legislature must amend
it afterwards wherever repair is necessary.
In short, it is recognised that the first
essential is to get the best kind of Federation
that circumstances admit of to begin with,
and make it better as things go on, instead
of waiting in the foolish hope of getting an
ideal Federation to begin with.
* « *
The arrangements provide that all the
provinces shall be equally represented on
the convention which is to prepare the plans
and specifications of the Commonwealth.
Therefore, Westralia and Tasmania will have
as commanding a voice as New South Wales
or Victoria, though either of these has five
times the population of the first two com-
bined. Mr. Lyne carped at this as one of
the reasons why the scheme of the Hobart
convention should be abandoned, but it is,
in The Bulletin’s opinion, a wise and
statesmanlike proviso. It was necessary, or
at least advisable, to make the concession to
induce the smaller provinces to join in the
movement, but it is quite probable that the
convention, created on these lines, will build
as good a constitution as would have been
produced by one elected on a population
basis. If it doesn’t, thy superior voting
power of New South Wales and Victoria in
the Federal Parliament will enable them to
repair things later on according to their own
wisdom, or want of wisdom, as the case may
be What the constitution thus prepared
will be like no one knows ; the country of
necessity “goes it blind” in the matter.
But providing that it is based iu a
general sense on popular suffrage, and that
it does not create any legislative body
so constituted as to be absolutely indepen-
dent of the popular will, and therefore im-
pervious to amendment, it should be adopted
whatever its other defects. If the propos id
Federal Legislature is amenable, either
directly or indirectly, to the popular vote,
then the new Australian nation can pre-
sently make it as democratic as it pleases
and as perfect as it knows how —in other
words, it can make it as good a Legislature
as the country deserves to have. Every
country which is ruled by the people gets
in the end just as good a system of govern-
ment as the people deserve.
* * *
There was a time, a few years ago, when
The Bulletin troubled itself considerably
over the details of the Commonwealth. In
those days there was some semblance of
popular interest in the subject, and it seemed
possible that the Parliaments might take the
matter up with something almost resembling
enthusiasm. Since then, however, this paper
has gradually come to realise the length and
breadth and depth and general vastness of
the public indifference, and the unlikelihood
of getting either the people or the Legisla-
tures to devote any prolonged attention to
the matter. Everybody approves of Aus-
tralian unity in the abstract, but hardly any-
body approves of it with much interest or
energy. Therefore, The Bulletin of to-day
will be glad to see the arrival of almost any
kind of a Federation, provided only that its
badness is not so elaborately devised as to be
wholly incurable. When it arrives the com-
munity will take an interest in it as a matter
of necessity, and will amend it so far as the
sense ot the community goes, and in course
of time Australia, as already mentioned, will
get as good a system of government as it is
worthy of. Then there will be an end of the
dreary wrangling about petty local tariffs,
and of the dispute about the debateable land
on the S.A. border, and the expense and
waste of the border customs will be done
away with, and the war of railway rates will
be ended, and also the building of unprofit-
able lines along the various frontiers with a
view to stealing the trade of the adjacent
province, and instead of six separate grovels
to as many distinct Governors, there will, let
us hope, be only one grovel at the most.
Also, there will be a chance of constructing
a really good central Government such as
this country has never yet possessed. Great
Britain, with nearly forty million people to
choose from, often finds it difficult to supply
material for one thoroughly capable Minis-
try, and Australasia, with only four millions,
has fully demonstrated that it can’t furnish
seven honest and brainy Cabinets, and seven
intelligent Parliaments all at once. Butitpro-
bably can, out of these four millions, supply
at least one Government which will be suffi-
ciently capable to bear reasonable inspection,
and if it fails to do so it will be mainly the
nation’s own fault. Also, it will have an
opportunity to consolidate the public debt
at a greatly reduced rate of interest,
and to settle t! i Chinese question
for all Australia, and to shut down on the
Queensland Kanaka and the coolie and other
forms of cheap labor, and to prohibit all
future land-grant railway jobbery, and
if it fails to do these things also it will
again be the fault of the Australian people
as a whole. The establishment of almost
any kind of a central Government will give
Australians in general a voice in all such
matters, and if they are not settled satis-
factorily it can only be because the majority
of the people don’t deserve - through their
ignorance or indifference or stupidity—that
they should be. /
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Fourteen Years.
The sentence of 14 years’ penal servitude
passed on George Dean, for perjury and
making a false declaration, is a remarkable
propf of the disadvantages of being a celebrated
criminaL Dean’s nominal offence was that he
swore falsely to save his neck from the hang-
man, but it would seem that the worst part cf
his crime was that he fooled the people of N.S.
Wales, and made the Government look more or
less ridiculous, and was the indirect means of
bringing down obloquy on a prominent Judge
and on the Attorney-General and sundry
members of the bar, and on the Crown Law
Department, and that he gained sympathy
under false pretences, and thereby made a
large and influential section of the public
feel, when it looked back at itself, that
it had been a very great ass indeed. Dean
induced the great, illogical people to cheer for
him, and drink his health, and come long
distances to shake hands with him, and
dedicate waltz-music to him, and hug
him publicly, and, in short, he had a
loan of the community in many different
ways. And the natural end of such a pro-
ceeding is that he gets the heaviest sentence
which the law will allow. A few years ago a
girl, also in Sydney, swore falsely that one
Buttner had committed a capital offence on
her, and by hard, continuous, and wholly
gratuitous lying, she got him sentenced to death.
She did it, apparently, from mere vice, cruelly,
and bloodthirstiness. She had not, like Dean,
the excuse that she was driven to perjury by
the instinct of self-preservation ; her only
apparent motive was the desire to hang some-
body by way of amusement and sensationalism.
She was proved by good evidence and on her
own confession to have been a perjurer and an
intended murderer and a person who en-
deavoured to pervert justice ; in short, she was
exactly what Dean was in every detail. But
she didn’t get 14 years in gaol; she wasn’t
even fined 2s. 6d. and costs; in fact, she
wasn’t even arrested, nor was any at-
tempt made to arrest her. Since her
time, half-a-dozen other vicious females have
comurtted the same perjury and attempted
mu u ml perversion of justice in different
pats of New South Wales, and, despite the
clearest proof of their guilt, not one of them
has been arrested for it. The Bulletin has a
vague recollection that one of the tribe, who
attempted by gratuitous perjury and through
pure cussedness to send a complete stranger to
lifelong imprisonment or the gallows, once got
three months in Victoria, but, otherwise,
criminals of this class have been allowed,
and are still allowed, to flourish absolutely un-
checked. Considering that the law abso-
lutely refuses even to know of their exis-
tence, and comparing its somnolence in
their cases with its enthusiasm and vigor in the
much less atrocious case of Dean, it is evident
that there is a serious discrepancy somewhere.
The Exemption Muddle.
\
The present situation as regards the N.S.W.
Land-tax Bill is about as complex as anything
well can be. In the first place, the President
of the Council ruled that the Upper House
couldn’t lawfully amend the Bill. The Speaker
of the Assembly afterwards ruled that it could
make amendments, and the Council accepted
his decision—partly because the Speaker is the
highest local authority on cbhstiluiidnal points,
and partly because his ruling suited,it ‘’down to
the ground.” Accordingly it amended the Bill
by striking out the <£475 exemption altogether.
Premier Reid now declares that the Council’s
action is unconstitutional, but in the face of
Speaker Abbott’s pronouncement to the con-
trary, his statement amounts to very little or
nothing. At last election the province affirmed,
with tolerable distinctness, its adhesion to the
land-tax principle, but that is about all it diii!
It couldn’t state definitely, by the cumbersome
and indefinite process of a general election,
whether it wanted a land-tax with exemptions,
or with this particular exemption, or without
any exemption at all. But it may be assumed
that the people who have no land and no money
invested on mortgage mostly approve of the
tax, because everybody approves of taxing
the other man. Also, the people who
come under the exemption mostly approve
for the same reason ; wdiile the people
who are not exempt disapprove strongly.
These latter either want no land-tax at all, or
else they want one with no exemptions what-
ever, so that they may have the profound joy
of seeing the small owner—who voted for the
tax under the impression that it w ould only hit
the other man—hoisted with his own petard.
As most of the voting population owns no land
there will probably still be a majority in favor
of the tax, even without the exemptions. But
it w’ill be mainly among th urban population,
and in ia good many agrimltural electorates
wheFfe the small holders v Red for the land-tax
policy under the imprtssi m that they would go
free, there is likely to be a serious change of
sentiment and a general tendency to c use the
Reid Government, if the Council’s policy pre-
vails. The Reid Ministry is pledged to die if
necessary in defence of the exemptions, and
it will have to de r end them or alienate
many of its supporters. The Council will pro-
bably stand to its position ; there is a holy joy
in taxing the small owners who voted so enthu-
siastically for taxing the large owners, and the
rich landlords of the Upper House appreciate
the situation. The Government’s organ, the
Daily Telegraph, blows hot and cold; it
declares a land impost without exemptions to
be an ideal tax, but it professes to favor the
exemptions rather than . lose the Bill alto-
gether. Therefore, if it can persuade the
Ministry and the Assembly to accept the
Council’s ideas on the subject it will
be all the better satisfied. Probably, for the
sake of the extra £400,000 of revenue, Premier
Reid would also be better satisfied, but (o
knuckle down to the Council in this matter
would mean ruin sooner or later. Meanwhile,
The Bulletin desires to point out for the
fiftieth time that the Land-tax should be a
measure for the encouragement of small hold-
ings and to prevent the accumulation of big
estates, and the establishment of a squirearchy
and a rack-rented tenantry and a servile peasant
class. The exemption-clause would tend this
way, by making small holdings more profitable
than large ones, and if it is sacrificed there is
not very much left in the Land-tax portion of
the Bill that is worth preserving.
One Law for the Jew.
“ The Abrahams are being prosecuted not
because they are ofl'enders against the law, but
because they are Jews,” said Barrister Duffy,
a month or two back, in Melbourne Supreme
Court, when the quartette of gun-forgers were
being tried, and the assertion drew down a
severe rebuke from Bench, Parliament, and
press. Yet in the light of later events Mr.
Duffy’s assertion would appear to have been
based on an extremely solid substratum of
fact. Since the Abrahams were sent to
gaol four persons concerned in another Hebrew
firm were found guilty of defrauding the Cus-
toms Department, and were also awarded terms
of imprisonment varying from three months to
one year. Since this .conviction no less than
four allegedly Christian business concerns have
been discovered in the act of defrauding the
Government. In each of these cases, the Cus-
toms Department was satisfied to accept a big
fine ; and there was no hint of criminal pro-
ceedings. But the latest cases are even
more glaring. For some time past, the Customs
Department has had its eye upon sundry wine-
anil spirit firms of go lly repute and unquestion-
able antecedents, and, after the collection of
sundry evidence, it became possessed of the fact
that these same highly-respectable mercantile
houses were selling locally-made spirits as the
products of noted French and other distilleries.
The cases, in fact, seemed to the lay mind
to amount to obtaining money under false-
pretences, yet a civil prosecution in a minor
court was the only course taken. There
one merchant was fined £lO, with £7 7s. costs,
for causing a label of “ Laurier et Cie., vintage
1585,” to be placed on brandy which had never
seen Laurier’s. Another firm, which bail in
its possession a quantity of Warrenheip
brrndy, also labelled as Laurier’s, was fined
£lO, with £l2 12s. costs. The prosecution
of another firm was for some reason
stopped, and a fourth firm was mulct in £lO,
with £lO 10s. costs. At the conclusion of the


cases the president of the Beach warned the
malefactors that a repetition of the offence
would mean gaol without imprisonment. Mean-
while the four Abrahamses, Rosenjfeld, Ben-
jamin, and Davies are whiling away the long
summer afternoons with a two-pound hammer
and a heap of bluestoue spalls, or something
like that. Again, the Chosen race appear to be
chosen with a vengeance.
The Crentle Kanaka.
The virtues of the docile and “reliable”
Kanaka, writes a Bulletin correspondent, are
being brought forcibly home to the persons, if
not to the intellects, of the people of the Bunda-
berg (Q.) district. Every Saturday night for
the past month the dusky savages have held
a tribal fight in the streets of the town, and the
utmost vigilance of the police has been unable
to prevent bloody encounters. A few Satur-
days ago the police watched the different points
of ingress to the town and disarmed the mur-
derous wretches as they arrived. Four loaded
six-chambered revolvers, hundreds of bludgeons,
leaden missiles, axes and tomahawks re-
warded their search. But the climax
came last Saturday night, when a fierce
tribal row occurred in the main street between
the Gala and Malayta “boys,” who “went for”
one another with much fury. The com-
batants turned on the police when they
intervened, and some of the constables
were injured. The savages, were, how-
ever, dispersed, and the townspeople again
breathed freely. But on Sunday morning
(20th Sept.) they were rudely awakened from
the delights of their fool’s paradise, by the
announcement that an inoffensive white had
been brutally murdered by Kanakas near
Rubyanna plantation, about five miles from
town. Joseph Lawtv, a selector, had been
done to death on a sequestered road near the
plantation, and his body was found there on
the Sunday morning. The man (about 35 years
old) had left his house to seek an errant child,
when he met his death. The body was literally
hacked to pieces by the savage brutes. He was
apparently encountered by a gang of Kanakas
armed with tomahawks and knives, and slain
within 150 yards of a neighbor’s house and
about twice that distance from his own domi-
cile. His collar-bone was cut through by a
blow of a tomahawk, the cut extending down
to the lungs. A portion of his scalp was
cut away by another blow, while his spine
was cut through in several places. Each
of the murderers apparently inflicted a wound
on the prostrate body on his own behalf, as is
the custom amongst the Polynesians in crimes
of this sort. Some seven natives of Malayta
have since been arrested charged with the
murder, and it is understood that one at least
has turned “Queen’s evidence.” The effect of
this hideous crime has been a universal cry
from the people, “ the Kanaka must go.” The
district is now in a state of white terror, and
in the country parts few have the temerity to
venture out after nightfall. This is the second
murder by Kanakas here within the year. As
the close of the crushing season is rapidly
approaching, the public realise that hundreds
of these murderous blacks will be thrown out
of employment by the genial planters and
allowed to “walk about” until next season.
The consequences likely to attend this can
easily be conceived. With bands of the planters’
pets roaming about the town and country, sans
work, saws food, sans moral responsibility, deeds
of violence can be counted upon. The boys arrested
have all been long-time residents of the pro-
vince, and came for years under the civilising (?)
influence of the Christian missionaries. The
tree of missionary zeal is badly recom-
mended by its fruit. The next Buuda-
berg election will be settled in one act
by this crime: no friend of the slave-trade
will be elected again. The planters look on ap-
parently unconcerned, and seem to feel no ill
effects of black-labor so long as their own hides
escape untouched. Independent of these
crimes, daily wrong is being done to the white
men by the presence of the niggers. White
laborers’ wages in the sugar industry have gone
down to zero (most people will agree that 7s. fid.
a week is zero) and even then the Kanakas are
employed at white men’s work in and out of
the mills, in contravention of the law and
the regulations. There might about as
well be no law at all prohibiting the
employment of the Kanakas in the mills, for
the planters completely ignore it, and the
supervision by the Polynesian Department is
such a screaming farce as to make even the
Kanakas themselves laugh at it. The dis-
district is virtually given over to the planters
and their slave-labor, while hundreds of white
men, able and eager for work, are humping
bluey all round looking in vain for employment.
Law Reform.
The law-reform scheme of Premier Kingston
(S.A.) sits right down on some of the worst
abuses of the legal ring. It practically throws
open the profession of the law to the world at
large by providing that any person, male or
female, who can pass a searching examination
in local law, and who has bad two years experi-
ence as an articled law-clerk, shall be eligible
for admission to the profession. All the stipu-
lations about going through a University course,
attending lectures, grinding up useless dead
languages, and so on, which have been intro-
duced so as.to block admission into the legal
ring, are to be done away with in one act. The
comparatively simple and inexpensive proce-
dure of the local courts is to apply to the
Supreme Court also, and many cases which
have hitherto been tried in the Supreme,Court
are hereafter to be dealt with by the inferior
tribunals. In certain cases solicitors and
barristers are to be wholly excluded. Pro-
vision is made for the settlement of appeals for
the small fee of £5 in the Supreme Court and
£2 in the local Court; no lawyers being allowed
to appear on either side. No solicitor can
recover costs from a client until his bill has
been taxed. Barristers are authorised to sue
the solicitors employing them for their fees.
Also—and this is the worst knock of all—a
barrister who takes up a case and doesn’t attend
to it, after the good old barristerial style,
is made liable to be sued for damages
arising out of his negligence. Hitherto it has
been the barrister’s privilege to take a big
fee, and then turn up in court or not, just as he
pleased, and if he didn’t turn up, or if he
arrived but proved to have not even read his
brief, and to be in a state of blank ignorance
about the case, the client had to stand the con-
sequences and feel as resigned as he could.
Therefore, in laying a sacrilegious hand on this
privilege Kingston blasphemes the sacred Ark
of the Covenant itself, and the magnates of the
horsehair-profession are thirsting for his blood
to the last shark.
Another Privileged Shark.
The truly blessed privilege of being a lawyer is
again exemplified in the case of Thomas Ernest
Rofe, a Gent. One, of Sydney. Rofe was the
plaintiff’s solicitor in the infamous Butler
divorce-suit, and he conducted a case which
was from first to last a glaring conspiracy. The
law finally decided that Rofe’s client was a
perjurer and a hirer of perjured witnesses, and
it gave him and his witnesses up to seven years
in gaol apiece. The same law decided that
Rofe had conspired with his perjured client
and his client’s perjured witnesses, and that he
was deeply involved in the attempt to pervert
justice ; and it sentenced him to five years’ gaol.
But, with the express sanction and approval of
the New South Wales Crown-law authorities, he
was released under the First Offenders Act, and
so he goes cheerfully back to his luxurious
home, a free man, and will not serve a single
hour of his purely nominal sentence. The in-
ference drawn by the public will be that a law-
yer can commit almost any crime he pleases
without having to chew hominy and crack
stones. Rofe is the only man in the whole
batch of convicts who gets off scot-free.
Butler and his witnesses are left to
work out their respective sentences. Johnson,
who was convicted of perjuring himself on
behalf of the defence, not for money or any
other sordid motive, but in the manly (if mis-
guided) effort to save his innocent and brutally-
used sister from social ruin, wasn’t released
under the First Offenders’ Act, or any other
Act. Johnson’s case, at the worst, practically
was that he saw his sister overwhelmed by the
perjured evidence brought against her by Rofe
and his fellow conspirators, and he proceeded
to swear rather recklessly on her side to pull
her through, and, as a consequence, the Law has
decided that he must serve out his three-year
sentence. But Rofe, who was convicted of
cold-bloodedly conspiring for a mean, sordid
fee to blast the good name of an
innocent woman, and whose action was
an indirect but powerful incentive to Johnson’s
crime, is treated on a wholly different plan.
There are many redeeming features about John-
son’s case, but about the offence of the heart-
less, soulless attorney there is not, so far as the
evidence goes, even one. His release will still
further convince the public that the ordinary
processes of law don’t apply to the well-con-
nected attorney, and the fact that his release
was stated to have been specifically asked for
or assented to or smiled upon by the Crown Law
office sounds like a wholly unjustifiable interfer-
ence by one lot of lawyers on behalf of another.
The law, by registering a sentence of three
years against Johnson and of five years
against Rofe, expressed a distinct opinion
that the latter was much the worse criminal of
the two. And now the public wants to know
if the worse criminal was let off because he was
a lawyer, and the less offender was gaoled
because he wasn’t one ? Lawyer Heydon’s
remarks about Rope’s mental sufferings and
the “ respectable position ”of his brothers and
sisters furnish no explanation whatever. John-
son also had mental sufferings, and if his sister
didn’t occupy a “ respectable position ” at the
time of his sentence, that was largely Rofe’s
fault, and the law has no more right to weep
about one man’s sister than about the other
man’s. Have the N.S.W. Parliament and
public sunk so low that this kind of thing is to
be endured ?
Insulted by Act of Parliament.
One of the clauses in the New South Wales
Civil Service Bill provides that no relation by
blood or marriage of any one of the Civil
Service Commissioners shall be appointed to
the service while the Commissioner he is related
to holds office. This opens up a large question.
A considerable portion of the press opposes the
proviso on the ground that it is the business of
the State to find men who are honest enough to
be trusted with an important office without
this “ degrading restriction,” and denounces it
as a “deliberate insult.” This is a specious
argument which looks as if it had something in
it. Nepotism is one of the most common forms
of corruption in the public service, and the
Public Service Bill makes a special effort to
prevent it. By doing so it distinctly implies
that the best kind of Commissioner it expects
to get can’t be wholly trusted, and by putting
him under this special restriction it casts
an insulting reflection on his honesty. At
the same time the world is so full of insulting
reflections, that, in The Bulletin’s opinion, one
more doesn’t matter. Everybody in the public
service who is entrusted with cash is insulted
by having his accounts audited, which distinctly
implies that the Government is much afraid
lest he has been peculating the funds. He is
also required to produce vouchers, which means
that the Government suspects him of lying and
cooking the accounts. The work of every
public official is supposed to be overhauled by
somebody, because he can’t be trusted without
being overhauled. Even the Colonial Treasurer’s
accounts are examined to see if he has been
taking any of the money ; and Judges’ decisions
are frequently reviewed by the Full Court, which
implies a doubt about their law and common
sense, or else about their impartiality. Every-
body, in short, in the State service is insulted
by somebody else, the insult being carefully
adapted to the circumstances of each case.
Even the appointment of the Commissioners is
a direct insult to Parliament, as it deliberately
expresses an opinion that Parliament isn’t
honest enough or intelligent enough to run the
service any longer. Under these circumstances,
it is only in keeping with the general sym-
metry of things that the Commissioners should
be insulted in the same fashion as other people.
All the auditing and inspecting and bye-laws
and regulations are based on the theory that
the public servant, whether he be a permanent
under-secretary or a laud-agentat Mud Flat, will
do something very wrong at the earliest oppor-
tunity unless he is kept under strict supervision.
The land-agent’s accounts are examined because
embezzlement would be the most convenient
and probable sin in his case. The C.S. Com-
missioner is forbidden, to give billets to his rela-
tives because nepotism is the handiest form of
corruption in his particular instance, and if the
one precaution is an insult so is the other.
The Victorian Factory Bill.
The Factories and Shops Bill, introduced the
other day into the Victorian Parliament by
Chief Secretary Peacock is about the
straightest attempt to tackle the sweating evil
yet made in Australia. For a long time the
community found it difficult to take Peacock
seriously by reason of his youthfulness and his
dreadful laugh, nevertheless he is gradually
coming to be recognised as a brainy Democrat
and a man with great possibilities in front of
him. Whether his Bill proves a success or a
failure, its existence testifies that Peacock and
his colleagues are men with pluck enough to
tackle a dreadfully complex question, which
most politicians have hitherto shirked by reason
of its vastness and apparent hopelessness. The
Vic. Government commences at the worst end
of the evil—the sinful sweating of the sewing
woman who works in her own home out
of the public sight and beyond the ken of the
factory inspector. In most cases the sewing
woman would as soon work in her employer’s
factory or workshop, but there she would come
more or less under public observation, and
factory inspectors and trades union authorities
would take note of her gauntness and misery,
and her unspeakable rate of pay, and conse-
quently her employer doesn’t want her
there on any account. Peacock’s Bill pro-
vides, in the first place, that no work
is to be “ given out,” unless the person
who gets it has a permit, said permit to be
granted only if she is an invalid, or is detained
at home by domestic responsibilities. The prices
for all kinds of sewing-work done by women
and children are to be fixed by a board con-
sisting of two representatives of the employers,
two representatives of the employes, and an
arbitrator mutually agreed upon. Women and
children are almost w’holly unprotected by
trades-unionism, therefore they constitute by
far the worst-sweated section of the com-
munity, and as there is no prospect that they
will ever be able to unite for their own effectual
protection, the Turner Ministry rightly pro-
poses to interfere on their behalf. The new
system has the great advantage of publicity ;
three-fourths of the villainous things that are
done under the sweating system, often by high-
placed snufflebusters and pillars of the church,
would never have begun to take place if they
had to happen in the light of day. It is also
proposed to limit the hours of shop-assistants —
another class which works unspeakable hours
and seems incapable of effective combination ;
to limit the number of apprentices, it having
been found that the apprentice system is abused
simply in order to get a man’s or a woman’s
work done for a small child’s pay ; and to also
limit the number of alleged “improvers,” who
represent the apprentice evil in another and
often a worse form. No Chinese factory or
workshop-owner is to be permitted to sleep in
his workroom, or to work on Sunday, or later
than 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday, and
2 p.m. on Saturdays,— a strictly logical
proviso based on the broad ground that the
Chow has no more right to sweat his fellow
Chow than the white man has to sweat his
Caucasian Laundries, dye-works,
&c., are to be included among factories and
made open to inspection, and inspectors are in
future to have power to summarily close in-
sanitary factories and workrooms. Altogether
the measure seems calculated to do the maxi-
mum of good with the minimum of fuss and
interference, and if Chief Secretary Peacock
succeeds in engineering it through Parliament
his horrid laugh should be remembered with
gratitude through the years of Victoria’s
future history.
Our Daily Leper.
Victoria’s latest leper turns up in the per-
son of one Loono. For years the infected
pagan has been chief ironer and general rouse-
about at a laundry run by a shindykit of his
relations. Loong is 29 years of age, and,
according to expert evidence, has been diseased
for six or seven years at least, and his horrible
malady has been in active eruption for eight or
nine months. His “cousins” at the leprosy
emporium assume the stolidity and the dense
ignorance of a stone fence when questioned
about the matter; but it has been discovered
that since 1891 the contaminated foreigner has
been squirting water out of his baleful mouth
over the linen of a number of happy and
ignorant people who, in all probability, will
not sleep peacefully for a long time to come,
and will spend all their leisure miserably
examining themselves for rashes, and pimples,
and things, and sitting alone, feeling for
thickenings in their ear-lobes, and fearfully
searching their constitutions for “symptoms
akin to the above.” The discovery of Loong,
the leper, will do more towards the abolition of
the Chinese laundries in Victoria than a mile
and a half of newspaper argument, as the
person of cash and consequence will even
prefer rather to subsidise a large, coarse,
Irish widow, with 11 orphans and a great
want of proper reverence for the upper-
classes, than to clothe his fair daughter
in fine linen provided with germs from
the scaly hand of the diseased Hoo-Ki-La and
Co., and then live his days in an agony of
expectation, watching for the leprous fungus to
over-run the roses in her dimpled cheek. At
any rate, The Bulletin has no sym-
pathy to spare for any man who permits
the clothing of his family to be mauled by Hang
Oat, or any of his hundred million cousins,
should Hang prove to be a leper, and the
horror of it turn his white patrons grey
in a single night, and every pimple on their
progeny for 11 years become a source of hellish
anxiety, and ruinous bills from doctors and
apothecaries without end, amen 1 Australia
must decide that the leper brand won’t wash
clothes.
Garden-Party Government.
The National Review lately published a ser-
mon upon the duties and qualifications of
“ colonial ” Governors. The author described
himself as an ex-private secretary, who had
enjoyed three years’ experience with a Govern-
ment figurehead in Australia, and his ideas
concerning vice-royalty are full of melancholy
interest for the people of more than one Aus ■
tralian province at this moment. The first
qualification for success in the vice-regal billet,
says the ex-flunkey, is a title, richly gilded.
“ In Victoria the Governor will need to spend
from his private income quite .£6OOO a year ; in
New South Wales a private expenditure of
£4OOO will be found necessary ; in South Aus-
tralia, under the new or reduced salary, a
Governor will find himself some £2500 or more
out of pocket.” A wife of wondrous tact and
amiability is the second qualification. “ She is
looked to for guidance in all social and
charitable matters An insolent manner,
a lack of tact, discourtesy, or the merest
suspicion of parsimony in the dispensa-
tion of hospitalities at Government house
will render the occupants more unpopular than
a quarrel between the Governor and his Minis-
try.” A sublimely diplomatic aide-de-camp is
the third essential'qualification for a Brassey,
Hampden, or Buxton. As for the duties of a
Governor, they are expressed in the list of
qualifications. He must “ entertain ” lavishly,
dazzle sassiety with his titular distinctions,
have a dignified manner, and confine his
energies to the social circle. In short, he must
be the little god of a little clique of worshippers,
who devour refreshments on the vice-regal
premises and loyally demonstrate over him
elsewhere. The ex-Secretary’s artless sermon
is but an echo of Tory cant and newspaper
“ gags.” We have seen, in the case of Victoria,
how a Governor may be popular, in the
cant sense of the word, while his wife is
notoriously tactless, and, owing to her natural
diffidence, discourteous. Also, we have seen
that the unanimous absence in England
of three or four Governors’ wives made
no more difference to the public welfare than
the strange dearth of Governors during the last
few r months. And in this time of grovel-famine
vice-regal functions don’t entail a large expen-
diture from the performer’s private income, nor
necessitate a Hinglish title to his name. Vic-
toria enjoys seemingly the reputation (among
private secretaries and similar authorities on
the subject) of being the most expensive of Aus-
tralian provinces to govern, because “no less
than 5000 guests were invited to the principal
garden-party, and for a great part of the year
a dinner-party of some 40 guests was given once
a week.” This sounds like an absurd exaggera-
tion of fact, but for purposes of argument it may
be set down as a solemn truth. As a solemn
truth it has nothing whatever to do with a
Governor’s duties and qualifications. Granted
that as as 5000 people—the 40 weekly
diners being selected from the mob—have been
on the books at Melbourne Government House.
They represented about 1 per cent, of the adult
population. To the other 99 per cent, it
matters nothing whether the Governor spends
his own money, has a smiling wife, and belongs
to the peerage, or is the meanest, least-married,
and plainest mister under the sun. They recog-
nise, more or less, the official uses of a Governor.
He has power to prevent obviously disgraceful
legislation, which power serves as a check upon
political immorality ; and people who think
at all about the matter would prefer to have a
Governor elected by themselves as a sort of
national Speaker. They cherish no desire for
a Brassey ; they don’t order cannon-firing,
triurpphal-arches, and fiddledeedee on the occa-
sion of his arrival. A public holiday is thrust
upon them ; a show is provided ; they go to see
the fooling, some of them ; and that’s all about
it. Brassey’s reception is a necessary thing in
the eyes of sassiety, because sassiety expects
him to spend a lot of money beyond his salary,
but a need for his triumphal-arches and subse-
quent private expenditure doesn’t exist outside
the pestilential little world of grovel with itf
5000 unwholesome inhabitants.
Tasmania, where the ruling class objects to
straightforward payment of members, is a
veritable paradise of “ deadheads.” Every
Mayor or warden of every one-’possum-power
hamlet has the freedom of the post and tele-
graph service. The other day it transpired
that ball-invitations in a lady’s handwriting
had been franked through the post. At least
one legislator is known to have sent out all his
monthly business accounts “on the never.”
They don’t believe in adequate payment of
members in Tasmania. Every legislator has
free use of the railways and telegraph wires,
and letters addressed to members during session
go unstamped. The member is also privileged
to send reply free telegrams; not “ reply paid ”
thus: “Do you wish me to call on XXX?
Reply free.” Of course all distinguished
visitors get a free railway pass, and naturally a
good many who aren’t distinguished travel “ on
the nod.” In fact the railways might as well
be free altogether, and it would come cheaper
in the end. The Conservative papers have
always got along all right in regard to free rail-
way travelling, but the two Democratic journals,
though in existence for several years, have only
during the past month managed to secure a free
pass for their editors. And, undernocratically,
they accepted the privilege.
The gross Toryism of the Imperial Fitz Gibbon,
of Melb. Metropolitan Board of Works, exhi-
bited itself in his remarks re the sweating of
labourers by sewer contractors, an evil brought
under his notice by a deputation from the Anti-
Sweating League, the other day. Said the
Gibbon : —“ My Board has fixed a rate of pay for
labourers. The workman who accepts a lower
rate and then complains of the contractor is
guilty of dishonest conduct, and I will be no
party to paying him the balance he should
receive under the minimum rate, as such an aCt

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It lias long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback- the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.
would be giving a premium to dishonesty.”
Nothing about the premium to the dishonesty
of the bosses given by the Board when it refuses
to take measures that will abolish their sweat-
ing tactics. For the labourer guilty of “ dis-
honest conduct ” in taking less wages than he
should lawfully be paid, there is a good excuse :
he is between the devil, who offers him 3s. a
day, and the deep sea of hunger and destitu-
tion ; for the contractor there is no excuse
beyond the characteristic ravenous greed of
Fat Man. But in the eyes of men like the
Gibbon, of the Board of Works, the former is
the rascal, and the latter the gentleman of
business acting in pious conformity with the
holy principle of Supply and Demand.

The dramatic season at Sydney Lyceum
opened on Saturday witli “In Old Kentucky,” by
C. F. Dazey and Arthur Shirley. This play, as
the management explains, was never before pro-
duced in Australia, and The Bulletin regretfully
adds that it wouldn’t very much matter if it was
never produced there again. The drama is staged
with every possible attention to detail, and so far
it is a beautifully-finished work. The racehorses,
five of them, are realistic-looking animals, and
wholly unlike the second-rate cats-meat which so
often does duty in such cases; and of the twelve
people who make up the cast, four or five could
pass as stars in any high-class company. But
“ Old Kentucky ” itself is a sketchy concern which
drags heavily in places, and if the name of the
joint author had been Hazey it would have much
better expressed the situation. The first act is
full of go, but after that the piece tapers off badly.
The plot concerns a mountain girl whose father
was murdered many years ago by a bad individual
with an inward expression in his eye, and a noble
youth in the illicit-whisky trade, whose parent
was cut off by the same party. This murderous
person happens around in the first act —he never
arrives in any purposeful fashion, but just
happens around and his inward-looking eye
arouses dim recollections in both their minds.
Thereafter the story struggles along vaguely, till
the villain, by frequently happening around, has
tried to blow up Granville Blake witli a dynamite
bomb, and has set fire to the stable where Queen
Bess is located, and has attempted to lynch tho
youth in the unlawful-whisky trade. Then sud-
denly they remember where they saw thatinward-
lookingeye before, and theyoung man in the whisky
trade leads the owner of it by the hair into the next
room and bombards him to death with artillery.
Then he goes away to be tried anil released under
the First Offenders Act witli the approval, ex-
pressed in a private conversation only, of the
Attorney-General, ami no one knows exactly what
is going to become of him afterwards.

This little tale is garnished with niggers,
horses and bits of extraneous humor. Elton
makes a great deal of miithfulness out of a rather
thin part as a drinky colonel who has tried for 20
years to prdpose to Miss Nelly Mortyne, and that
pretty and clever lady climbs a tree with great
ability, and otherwise does a lot to fill the aching
void. King Hedley shows to much better advan-
tage titan he did in the horse-scene at Her
Majesty’s, and as a quiet, repressed, silently-
baleful sort of villain he is very effective. Scot
Inglis, though his ’Murken accept gives out at
times, makes a fine, upstanding young man in
the illicit-whisky trade ; and Miss Harrie Ireland
fills a small part and a beautiful dress to admira-
tion. Also, the new star. Miss Helen D-tuvray,
the “ Californian Diamond,” plays the part of an
energetic, wholesome mountain maid in a way
that endears her to the great soul of the audience,
and Granville Blake is a nice, colourless young
man, with an unexceptional hair parting. It is
vaguely understood that the latter gentleman _ is
ruined if his horse doesn’t win, but his financial
difficulties are very ill-defined. Tho racing scene
is not much above the average, and the burning
stable and the explosion are only average inci-
dents, and the fact that the inward-look’ng per-
son is killed in the next room is disappointing.
Even two rousing fights, in each of which the
illicit distiller severely disarranges his enemy,
have nothing specially new about them.

At Sydney Royal the geysers, and the hofc-
rprings, and the great Tarawera eruption con-
tinue to explode six nights in the week with great
i-olilt. For rich and picturesque scenery “ The
Land of the Moa ’’gets away from all competitors.
There is not one scene in all its stupendous length
which isn’t wildly unusual, and even the most
usual of them all would look extraordinary if it
wasn’t overshadowed by the more remarkable
nnustialness of the other sixteen or thereabouts.
The Maori war-dance, too, grows upon the public
with each repetition, and the maddened whirl of
these 40 chocolate-colored legs suggests brown imps
chasing a lost soul over the coals in a picturesque
hereafter. It is the biggest and maddest insur-
rection of brown legs ever seen on the stage.
Their color vaguely suggests that the figure of
Britannia on the back of the modern copper has
just broken loose from a lunatic asylum, and lost
most of her clothes as she got over the fence, and
their appalling velocity confuses the eye, until it
seems as if all the world was full of cataracts of
brown legs rushing down steep slopes into
nowhere, witli more and more and still more
brown legs to follow. They make a soulful and
refreshing spectacle, and whoever desires to fill
himself with brown legs should go to the Royal
at ouoe and be filled.

The dreadful Greenwood family, which, by
the aid of Misses Maribel, Ruby, and several
other daughters, also Master Bob and the house
dawg, brought so many good dramas into dis-
repute a few years ago, has broken out afresh.
According to the pathetic story told in Sydney
police court, Mr. Greenwood has lately repaired
his shattered fortunes, and, in consequence, the
whole family determined to rush upon the stage
once more. “Leah, the Forsaken,” a drama
which is too old to defend itself, was selected as
the opening trouble, and the family wired £5 to
Mr. Greenaway, the well-known actor, on account
of salary, and cordially invited him to come along
and join in tho struggle. Greenaway, however
(The Bulletin is now telling that gentleman's
version of the story), hearing that the family was
breaking out again, and having been there before,
gathered up his clothes in affright and fled to
Sydney en route to an engagement with Plain Bill
Holloway in South Africa. Also, he kept the £6
on account of some arrears still due him from a
previous season with the same soulful combination.
Then Greenwood sent an extradition warrant after
him for embezzlement or homicidal vagrancy with
intent, or something, and Greenaway had to turn tip
along with the drunks and brutal-assault oases and
explain things. The explanation, by good luck,
proved satisfactory, and the extradition was re-
fused, and the Greenwood family will have to
break out by itself. Meanwhile “ Leah the For-
saken ” is und-rstood to be in active rehearsal, so,
presumably, Masser Bob is stage-managing in
place of the escaped Greenaway.

Mahomet, the arithmetical horse, has
been putting up some new records doting the
week, and is more firmly established than ever as
the favorite attraction of Fitzgeralds’ allow. It is
confidently expected that this animal will shortly
add bookkeeping by double entry to his other
accomplishments, and then take a billot as an
auditor. At all events, The Bulletin is firmly
convinced that Mahomet knows more about
figures than many auditors of its acquaintance,
and if that honest-looking animal put his hoof
and attestation to a bank balance-sheet it would
be disposed to view the document with more con-
fidence than usual. The Roumanian lady and the
Professor drop from astonishing heights as usual.
The other night, after the latter gentleman had
fallen in with his accustomed regularity, a well-
known lawyer climbed up the ladder and looked
with a discriminating eye into the tank with the
severe expression of a man who was resolved to
investigate tilings by the roots. The fact that he
didn’t also fall into the tank was a severe disap-
pointment.

John Coleman, the first of Mr. Rickards'
new liatch of imported artists, has already estab-
lished himself as a favorite at Sydney Tivoli, and
proves to be a rather brilliant person with a good
many new ideas in his unpretentious head. He
is described on the bill as “one of the greatest
character comedians and expert dancers in the
world,” and so far he has lived sufficiently well
up to his character to pass muster. The Tivoli is
particularly well supplied with musical talent,
and there is material fora high-class concert com-
pany iu Harry Rickards’ show at present.

Lord Brassey and “ The Old Guard” put
in a joint appearance at Melbourne Princess’s last-
Saturday night. His Excellency achieved a more
distinct success than the opera, because bouquets
were provided for him by the management before
the curtain rose, and he was seen at his best
between the acts. Also the Legislature sat around
the new Governor, and tightened those “silken
bonds ” with an enthusiasm which no words can
express. The Bulletin can only remark “Rule
Britannia,” leaving the rest to its readers’ imagi-
nation. A revival of little Miss Flora Graupner
in her original character brought bygone memories
to bear upon “The Old Guard.” Flora’s natural
brevity is more noticeable than ever, after her pro-
longed absence from the stage, and now that
there is no Violet Varley, alas ! to keep her figure
in countenance, so to speak. But her nigh spirits
and broad smile fill the part very satisfactorily.
George Lauri, Miss Florence Young, Howard
Vernon, and Miss Ida Osborne do as they were
wont to do of yore. Mis Juliet Wray is a popular
Patatout, although the bloom of novelty has de-
parted from her. Wallace Brownlow’s appearance
as Marcel didn’t take place owing to a bad cold,
so Sydney Deane made gloomy music in his stead.
To-morrow (Friday) Lauri will take a benefit.

Six operas in six nights are promised for
the coming racing season. “ Ma Mie Rosette ” is
to be the Derby bill, followed by “ Madame
Angot,” “Old Guard,” “Dorothy,” “ Mascotte,”
and “ Yicar of Bray.” The combined effect of
these six successive shows upon the soul of a
sporting visitor who sees them all whilst under
the influence of holiday excitement is rather awful
to think about.

“Man to Man,” at Melb. Royal, is a
solemn melodramatic warning against the folly of
taking off your frock-coat in order to fight the
villain. George Rignold, who has had more
stolen papers thrust upon him than any three
other heroes in Australia, rashly flings his wed-
ding garment across a garden-seat at the bidding
of his bitterest foe, and is undone. A small boy
places the incriminating documents in a tail
pocket, where they are discovered by the lynx eye
of the law five minutes after George’s mar-
riage ceremony. For the next few years he
languishes in a convict suit, but at last
his frock-coat and fair young bride are restored
to him, together with all the earthly possessions
of his late employer, which had been made over to
the villain under a forged will. “ Man to Man ”is
brightened by the evil deeds of Augustus Glover
as a comic desperado, and the lurid, fitful presence
of Miss Maud Williamson in a skirt of mauiy
Miss Williamson is a gipsy having
secrets to impart, and Augustus brings timely
disaster to the night express, whereby the stage is
strewn with dying passengers, and proofs of the
hero’s innocence arise from the debris. Also the
engine bursts in a manner that ensures success for
the entertainment. Twenty characters, more or
less, mingle with the excellent scenery of “Man
to Man,” and tell the old old story for all it is
worth. It will run for more than a week, unless
George Rignold insists upon producing another
huge melodrama on Saturday. Rumours of
“ Youth ” are in the air.

A Grand Oriental Carnival, Fair and Art
Union will start at Melbourne Exhibition Build-
ing on Derby night (November 2), and pursue its
picturesque career until November 16. =£3ooo have
been invested for the benefit of this bold enter-
prise. The name of the things that will happen
during the fortnight is Legion. The Exhibition
interior is being rapidly converted into High-street,
Jerusalem, with gorgeous shops on either side,
and a colossal programme of amusements at the
far end. Concerts, variety shows, dives from the
dome, and larks with a live lion may be casually
mentioned as joys in store for visitors to that holy
city. Athletic sports are promised by way of out-
door tonic for the dazed and sated senses. One
will go down from Jerusalem to Jericho, as it
were, to see a bicycle race, and come back with a
renewed appetite for pleasure. The Oriental Car-
nival promises to boom. It reads like a dream of
Jerusalern up to date, and excites a certain feeling
of pity for Solomon in all his glory, who never had
half such a chance of being staggered at the cost of
one shilling.

The Alexandra Theatre has been awakened
from a long and dusty slumber by Charles
Holloway, and its doors will be thrown open to
the public on Saturday. The valour of plain
Bill’s younger brother deserves success, but The
Bulletin advises the management to be prepared
for the worst. And the worst —in the way of
Alexandra business —is a ghastly fate to look for-
ward to. “The Broad Arrow” will test the
situation.

The Opera House show stands where it
did, and supplies the same want as usual. Mes-
merist Kennedy, too, has established himself and
his pitiable “ subjects ”at a hall, but it is not yet
clear that Melbourne craves for any more Ken-
nedy. The fact that he is a red-headed calamity
and a despicable dabbler in human degradation
begins to make itself felt. Nobody laughed very
heartily at the fat man’s loathsome performance
on Saturday. The larger portion of a somewhat
small audience seemed glad when the bloated
personage announced, in a rasping squeak, that his
‘ ‘ entertainment ” had come to a conclusion.
“ Entertainment! ” —for pigs.

Mr. Flavelle, erstwhile of the "Firm’s” opera co.,
better known on the field as “Ted, the actor," is running
a grocery and condensed-water shop at the Six-Mile,
Kalgoorlie, and speculating with fair success. But he
cannot be tempted to warble, and it is said that the
highly-colored labels on meat-tins announcing the con-
tents of same have a depressing effect on him.
Bradfield suggests a query. Is it an imperative adjunct
to success in modern burlesque to be able to gabble lines
at the express rate of 385 words to the minute ? The un-
speakable Lonnen is mainly ri sponsible for this tongue-
steeplechasing. The “great” comedian of the fu.ure

When Pollard’s Lilliputians were up North recently a
suckling dude promised one of the principal girls a floral
wreath. He spent a week’s pittance on a gorgeous mass
of flowers and sent it by a messenger to give to the door-
keeper. It chanced that an angular New Woman was
lecturing at the rival hall. The chuckle-headed messenger
delivered it to the wrong place, of course, and it was
carefully handed up to the Apostle of Cold Tea and
Liberty. Attached to it was a sugary note pleading for a
meeting and containing the sender’s name and address.
There was a sad five minutes interview the next morning

Mias Leonore Orelli, whose fine voice is said to have
improved greatly during six months of calm retirement,
has been engaged for the Oriental Carnival at Melbourne
Exhibition building. The Jews heard Orelli sing on the
first night of the amateur " Pinafore ” performance, and
heard Flegeltaub Wray struggle with the same music al
hours later. After which they solaced themselves with
the assertion lhat the tall, fair damsel was really a Jewess
In disguise—which she certainly isn’t. All the same, the
Chosen will presenlly be able to claim that they "dis-
covered” and adopted Miss Orelli, unless the Gentiles
take her up.
The practice of changing the names of music hails is
becoming most bewildering in Melbourne, where each
house has been christened half-a-dozen times over. The
Cambridge becomes St. George's Hail again for Kennedy’s
Season. Each variety crowd that lands in applies a new
name, evidently with an idea of convincing the public
that they travel with their own hall.
Mesmeiist Kennedy exp riences no difficulty in getting
subjects in Melbourne. The man who has eaten board-
ing-house Iml ter there has no pirticular objections to
candles if they are good, and some of the unemployed

Pascal, “ The Demon” of Fitzgeralds’ show, is a French-
man of sft. 4in., 14st. 121 b. weight, 50in. chest, 18J
biceps. He is the most solid contortionist alive—
quite an elephant doing the eel. His great feat of grip-
ping with bis teeth a mouth-piece set upon a table and
then poising himself upon it with feet upwards, took him
three years to learn and cost him two or three teeth. His
father w; s an acrobat, and Pascal began circus work
when four years old ; he has continued it for a quarter of
a century. Lein, “ the Crocodile,” with ids green coat
and sinuous twistings, never had an acrobat or such in
his family, but when he was four years old a circus-pro-
prietor diagnosed him as animated india-rubber and took
him in band. The Ciocodile is 23 years old, sft. 6in.,
13st. 41b. ;he is a German. BUh Demon and Crocodile
take eight hours sleep, and are very parlicular over diet.
Breakfast at 9 a.m. is a couple of raw eggs and a glass
of milk ; lunch at 12.30 cousists of, say, one chop, little
vegetable, a little pudding, and claret; nothing then till
midnight—after the show when a frugal supper is taken.
Fond or drink in the stomach during contortion acts
might mean choking. Both are very small eaters, believ-
ing, with Sandow, that to become strong a man must eat
little. Both avoid spirits and tea but each smokes about
12 cigarettes daily. The morning’s exercise is an hour or
two of limbering up, and the afternoon’s a steady three-
miles walk. Cold weather gives them nipping pains in
the shoulders and back ; they wear flannel round the
loins, and Use embrocations. But in warm wealher these
things are forgotten. Eight years ago the Crocodile put
his hip out contorting, and spent a few monthsin hospital.
One peculiar result of the contortionist’s woik is the
development of a solid lump of muscle, walnut-size, under
tile chin, which gives the wearer a somewhat extra-
ordinary appearance. Pasoal can speak English like a
John Bui’, and both he and Lelo talk English, French,
German, Spanish, and Italian.

Tuesday last (Oct. 29) was the centenary of the birth of

Rignold should lie interested in the following from Sidney
Ooloir’s life of the hard : “ A still jounger member of the

‘ Stories after Nature,’ and of t bat singular and strongly-
imagined Biblical drama, or dramatic poem, ‘ Joseph and
iiis Brethren,’ «hicti, having fallen dead in its own day, has
been resuscitated by a group,of poets and critics in outs.”
So that Rignold can’t fairly claim that the idea of a play
about Joe and Mrs. Potiphar was all ins own.
The cold-blooded Yic. authorities appear
nervous lest the. public suspicion that Emma
Williams is pregnant may save her from the hang-
man. At first the official doctors confined them-
selves to the opinion that the woman was nut
"quick with a quick thild ; ” upon pressure they
added that there was “no reliable evidence of
pregnancy at all.” But, as in the early stages of
conception, no absolutely reliable signs are
admitted by any authorities, this statement can
by no means be accepted as final. More-
over all agree that certain indications are
strong circumstantial evidence. These symptoms
are stated to exist in the case -of the condemned
woman, and it is likely that the public will insist
upon her getting the benefit of any doubt that
may be settled by development.
No woman should be held accountable with her
life for any act she may commit while pregnant.
A pregnant woman is not a responsible being.

Readers of The Bulletin in the country are often
puzzled to know where to send their orders, so
many drapery firms are advertising what they can

There seems to be a general idea that “ anything

ladies, even in the remotest backblocks, like to

have for the past 30 years given special attention
to their Country Order Department, and know
intimately the requirements of every part of the

Baron Rothschild in TV. A.
It is the present intention of the Baron Alphonse
de Rothschild to pay a visit to Western Australia,
about Christmas time, in order to inspect the
numerous properties in which he has lately become
interested. Should this intention become an
accomplished fact it will be a splendid advertise-
ment for W. A. and her mines, and will bring a rush
of speculators who are only too glad to follow the
famous baron’s lead. His confidential agent has
been in the western colony for many months, and
has bought several valuable properties, and as
naturally we like to know all we can about a man
with Rothschild’s reputation, our correspondent
waited upon the agent and was graciously
accorded an interview. Our representative States
that from his conversation he gathered that the
baron is a generous man, who lives in princely
style and neither stints himself nor his employes.
He glories in a first-class smoke, and for that
reason indulges only in the B.L. Corto Roths-
childs. At Xmas time he presents to each of his
employes a box of these fragrant weeds. If some
of our colonial grandees were to follow his good
example and give their hard-worked clerks a box
of B.L. Corto Rothschilds at the'"festive season
they would get popularity at a trifling cost,
besides giving pleasure to the recipient. Con-
sidering that the smoke of princes, viz., the B.L,
Corto Rothschilds, are now obtainable at all first-
class tobacconists at Gd. each, and in boxes of 25
for 125., they are within reach of every lover of a
good weed.*

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
October 29, 1895.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
Mark Hambourg farewelled to a matinee
stuffed with women on Tuesday of last week after
making a bright success of his Sydney season.
The audience looked as if each individual girl’s
main object was to catch the downcast eye of the
boy’s-size Paderewski, and the show of pink roses
and airy gimcracks was a compliment in itself. A
girl in the first gallery presented a very new effect.
She had on a greenish bodice and was standing
just behind one of those greenish pedestals which
divide the gallery-rails, and which reached to her
waist, so she looked exactly like a bust of a girl
of the period. Ladies who stand up in the Cen-
tenary hall gallery should remember that this
effect is lying in wait for them.
The programme was classic and affecting. One
maiden hauled off in tears, and another was sup-
ported out half-fainting, but no flowers were
thrown, and what hysterics there were appeared
to happen strictly in front. Mr. Sydney Muss,
Mr. Harry Weir, and Miss Blanche Thomas, a new
contralto, who wore white to suit her water-name
I suppose, helped to still further strengthen the
bill. I must say the audience listened breath-
lessly—partly for love of music and partly because
once the brilliant Russian ivory-pounder abruptly
left off playing and retired from the stage when
the crowd got too cacklesome, and only returned
when silence reigned. It wouldn’t be a bad idea
if mummers did the same at Lyceum Theatre first-
nights.
Kruse on Nov. 2 is the next musical sensation
to soothe the unsettled feelings of the people who
haven’t gone to see Melbourne Cup; and I hear
that the Marquardts are only waiting to get their
o.ir into musical matters. Madame M. harping
on her harp in her own angelic manner ought to
run to a successful return Sydney season in, say,
the Centenary Hall. Talking music, the most
amusing incident of the recent Hambourg season
was the way Australian pianists of prowess banked
their Promethean tires while the bow-legged
Russian genius was abroad. You couldn’t get a
piano-solo of consequence in any quarter where
his musical pyrotechnics were going strong, and,
although the stock-instrumentalists allowed their
names to appear on programmes, somebody always
arose before the item came on to explain that the
local genius had been obliged to go to bed owing
to that tired feeling, or something of the sort.
The unanimity with which everybody agreed to
let Hambourg have the platform to himself was
remarkable.
The newest thing I’ve heard lately is that the
warships on the Australian station are not going
to be ordered into active service in Hobson’s Bay
for Cup week. Just now, the navy seems to be
suffering a recovery from its long, long lapse into
hedonism, and the character it has earned in Aus-
tralia for chasing the glowing hours on largo tan
feet, and doing precious little else will have_ to
be contradicted, with apologies. The new Admiral
appears to be keeping up his character as a marti-
net, and promises ,to have even severer attacks in
future. For one thing, madame the Admiraless
is not coming out, after all, to figure as chatelaine
at Admiralty House, and the little Admiral, who
has hitherto given the necessary social attention
to the “shore people” in the shape of at homes
and tea-parties has, I hear, expressed his inten-
tion of letting society “go hang,” as they say in
“Madame Angot,” and only means to entertain
“his own ships,” when he comes across them.
But perhaps Rear - Admiral Bridge has a
smoke-concert soul and prefers cock - robin
functions, like the dinner the English ships
recently gave the Germans, while cruising amid
the coral isles. At this dinner a “ Yarman ” cap-
tain made the toast of the evening. Ho said,
“Gentlemans, I haf to you probose a German
toast. Herr captain, I drink your mozzer ; herr
lieutenant, I drink your vife and ze ozzer ladies.”
Who they were was fortunately not “ eggsblained.”
The pet of one of the warships at present on
Sydney station is called a Tanna hen, though it
isn’t a hen at all, but a rooster, in spite of which
the shorter name sticks. At mess sometimes the
bird is perched on a bracket and given fiery spirits
until intoxication sets in, and, as connoisseurs in
that sort of low comedy all agree that an inebriated
rooster can put more stagger into his stride than
any other member of the animal kingdom in his
cups, the sight is regarded as extremely humorous
by the naval heroes. Once this intemperate fowl
fell overboard as H.M.S. Pinafore was forging
ahead, and the ship was stopped and a boat was
lowered to rescue the feathered warbler. The
British navy is a most humane institution.
The navy ought to feel very tired —and so should
the army—when they see the crowds of people,
male and female, who wear army or navy colors
in their hatbands and neckties, whether they know
either profession when they see it or not. Since
that quartette of youths in “A Gaiety Girl”
sported bloodshot bands and scarves when war-
b'ing about the boys of the Household Brigade,
■ very counter-jumper does violence to the public
ye in liis haberdashery, and so does every subur-
ban girl too. So general have these hitherto-
exclusive badges become that the people who
really ought to wear’em are the only ones who
don’t.
The gee-gees will have left Australia ere these
scintillations get into print, and when the
shadowy distance blots out the myriad attractions
of tiie bubblesome co., people will console them-
selves with remembering that alter all pretty
Deoima Moore had about as much voice as would
be expected from a dotty bronchial tube; and
even the winsome Grace Palotta-took a No. 5 boot
and a glove to match; Also, that nobody ever saw
the real Maud Hobson, who was born with black
hair and the sort of complexion that usually goes
with it —for in Australia she was golden and
frescoed in many colours ; so what the real Maud
Hobson looks like will for ever remain a conjec-
ture. Ami people who incline to break their
hearts over Blanche Massey may find consolation
in recollecting that the beauty’s complexion, seen
at close range, suggested the “Before Taking”
picture on a patent pill advertisement ; and that
one at least of those fluffy little girls, who played
the society maidens, was at heart a downcast
hypochondriac perpetually “shaking the bottle.”
Ex-Premier Parkes got married again last
Thursday. Lady Parkes No. 3 (the daughter of
an Irish farmer) was a servant in the Parkes
menage for over four years, and was “greatly
attached ” tothelate Lady Parkes, who died happy
firmly convinced that her husband would , not
survive her three months ! The third ceremony
was performed at the Anglican church, Parra-
matta, with only two Parliamentary cronies of
the well-seasoned bridegroom (who must be letter-
perfect in his responses by now !) to support the
blushing pair, after which a bridal jaunt was
taken to the very suburb where Lady Parkes No.
2 has reposed in peace for the last three months
with a little glass lid in her coffin, put there to
enable her ex-husband to focus one last heart-
breaking look before the grave closed for ever.
The new Lady Parkes is said to be a fine figure of
a girl, twenty-three years of age.
The Royal Comic Opera Co. farewelled last
Thursday to a full and enthusiastic house, with
the usual number of bald-headed men glistening
like door-knobs all round the front row ; but then
the Lyceum’s speciality is the billiard-ball aspect
of the van when a show comes along with fleshings
in it. A few Saturdays ago I counted eight of
them (five of ’em almost egg-bald) in the front:
row, and a look round the dress-circle failed to
show any others so seriously affected by want of
hair. The man with the tennis-ball skull evi-
dently thinks that to be bald is to be beautiful, so
he loves to catch every ray of electric-light, firstly
on his shiny poll and then on his diamond stud. I
have often noticed and wondered why, when a
man’s hair has worn off on top, he should always
gravitate to the front row at the theatre (in the
audience I mean, of course, for if he was on the
boards he would most undoubted'y come next last
to the back cloth), and so I asked a leading Syd-
ney doctor to explain the whyness of the thing.
“Why,” I asked, “is it that the bald-head
is always in the front row?’’ “It’s being there
that m ikes him bald,” said the medicine-man.
By the way, what a golden age for doctors
is dawning behind the lady cyclists, and yet the
disinterested rnedicoes advise you please not to
buy a bike. Still, a craze is a craze, and not until
the shrieks of the wounded sound a loud warning
will women come back on to their own two feet or
their gee-gee’s four feet, and leave the wheel alone.
The mania is spreading in Sydney, where some-
body is busily getting a hall ready, cl la skating-
rink, where women will be taught to cycle on
hired machines. To do a tour is the lady-
wheelist’s noblest ambition, and yet I hear of a
well-advertised lady who goes from Dan to Beer-
sheba on her gridiron, returning from a very long
ride tanned and grilled almost to blackness, and
with the skin hanging off her in strips. So un-
sightly was she that she either avoided the towns
coming back or rushed them masked in a thick
veil that almost blinded her. If that sort of thing
is what women like, the sex must indeed be
evoluting.
No woman looks her best on a bike, but if it
comes to comparisons the she-Englishwoman gets
ahead of her Parisian rival, for the former clings
to skirts, which are the secret of woman’s great-
ness, while the latter leaves very little to the
imagination in boldly-bifurcated knickers. The
Americans think they strike a happy medium
with the baggy divided skirt, while in Australia
every woman appears to wear her own par-
ticular fancy, which is mostly knickerbockers.
Foolish virgins! “Skirts are to form what
rhythm is to poetry,” wrote somebody, I forget
who; and certainly the photos, one sees of
women skewered on bikes encourages the idea
that they look more like something new
for the Zoo, or promising subjects for a
comic song than seraphic creatures who ought to
be having sonnets written to their eyebrows, I
think—judging by her elegant appearance in Lord
Noel’s velvet suit —that Mrs. Brough would look
graceful on a cycle. But, then, how few Mrs,
Broughs there are, and how many short-legged,
fat women cyclists—suggesting that the egg-
beater is running away with the cottage loaf—
would we have to suffer in between ? By
the way, an official lady of Melbourne, who
has done much to encourage a love for wheels in
society, always has her photo, taken with her eyes
cast down. Prince Laurent, in the Mascotte,
would shudder to know the reason why.
“In Old Kentucky,” at Sydney Lyceum, is a
one-woman piece, and Miss Helen Davvray
(known to Australia as the “ Californian Dia-
mond” of years ago—so quite a J. L. Toole sorb
of audience turned up on Saturday night to renew
favorable impressions) is an actress who could puu
worse literary dill water than “Old Kentucky’
through. She reminded irte of a pared edition of
Maggie Moore, only that she appears to have no
vocal intervals like that other plump and pleasing
favorite. Miss D. Was a great hit as the warm-
hearted Madge, although her costumes were sim-
ple and phenomenally clean—her only sartorial
thrill being the jockey suit in which she suggested
that if the Ashland Cup was weight-for-age Miss
D.’s mount must have been the oldest gee in the
flutter,
Nellie Mortyne wore the handsomest frocks>
and her dressing would have weighed-in for draw
ing-roorn comedy. A brown dress she sported
was just the artistic tint of the bottle-brush
“shag” that bad little boys smoke as a pre-
liminary to baccy. Miss Mortyne goes on a sorb
of sartorial spree in “ Old Kentucky,” for she
has a new gown in every act. The hero
wore a brown suit in one act, with buff-
colored legs and white vest, in which he looked
like a sort of cock-sparrow in a pantomime, and
the villain erred in dressing himself so carelessly.
I have been brought up to think that no man can
plan or carry out a crime unless he is in full even-
ing dress, with a light topcoat and a cigarette, and
to find that evil may be wrought in a sac suit and a
felt hat such as the hero usually wears on his return
from trying to earn his living, is a revolutionary
notion. I liked the race-scene immensely—it was
the first stage-race I have ever witnessed which
wasn’t won in a trot.
It seems to me —re the absorbing topic of Bene-
dict Parkes and his new bride—that the Australian
Gladstone, in his extreme old age, has renounced
active politics and started in business as an incu-
bator. A wife can be replaced as easily as a
broken tea-cup* Women are queer creatures ;to
a man, it would be revolting to marry a toothless
old woman, and when he does (as ho sometimes
does), there’s always a flare-up and a separation
in short order; but reverse the sexes, and you’ll
find the rule does not apply to women. Indeed,
this ex-politician of 81 appears to be able
to bowl ’em over against heavy odds, for
he is said to have -cut out a young swain
in his recent marriage; There must be life
in the old dog yet, although the late Lady
Parkes was quite sure that grief at her loss would
kill her heart-broken husband in less than three
months—which shows the over-confidence of loving
Women ! But, after all, these things must be
looked at philosophically, and from the standpoint
of the eternal vital'principle, which here and
there asserts itself even to the verge of the grave.
The Grand Old Man of Botany Bay boasts that
he could have married cash had he chosen, and
for my part I am sure he could have had his pick
of the woman-suffragists, who always appear to
have a yearning to rest in his hair. But “as a
man of the people,” the G.C.M.G. wanted “a
wife of the people’’—and got her. It really does
look as if spouses grew on every bush for the per-
fervid admirer of Stella. The bride, by the way,
is Irish—which may lead to the Irish forgiving
their ancient enemy a great many things. This
latest Parkes wedding, by the way, has a most
amusing effect on the social status of the “lady-
ship” rank, which so many fat, political women
are a-hungering for.
Mark Hambourg must consider the music-fol-
lowing Australian female a weird product—•
though genius-worship is a form of feminine
hysteria all over the world. But here it was laid
on so wry thick. They all called him “Mark,”
and he retaliated by calling them by their
Christian names when he met them, though I
don’t suppose they would have permitted it had
they known that he had one whom he really, semi-
seriously admired—“ the prettiest and nicest girl
he had met in Australia,” so he said— and to whom
lie gave a brooch on leaving Sydney. His departure
for Melbourne was a spectacle. The station was
crowded with women, some of whom begged his
buttonholder as a souvenir. Mark refused on the
ground that it was a love-gift, whereupon it was
torn out of his coat and divided.
Apropos of music, I am glad to hear that Annie
Summerbelle’s well-written song, “Unrest,” has
reached its second edition.
Reprisals move very slowly, it would seem, in
religious circles. For instance, it was only the
other day that a picturesque Anglican canon gave
a Roland to Card. Moran’s Oliver re the alleged
spiritual cargo of rum on the mission ship John
Williams, though the Card.’s remark is blue-
mouldy by now. The canon alluded to the thumb-
screws and racks discovered in the foundered
Armada as “spiritual cargo;” and now, after a
few more months have passed away, the Kyardinal
will have doubtless got his little mediaeval quip
arranged to balance the canon’s. But the Angli-
can priest might have brought his retort more up
to date, by alluding to the “ holy Roman ” fancy
bazaar, held at a certain uncivilised N.S.W. town-
ship not so long ago, when some of the lottery
prizes were sundry cases of spirits, diced for
bottle by bottle by the local priest, in utter disre-
gard of the Gambling and Licensing Acts, not to
speak of the conventional religious scruples to
dice and grog as spiritual aids. Though 1 am
afraid the Episcopalian Church is not without its
faults in the same direction. What Frilz Rimma
would call a “bazaw,” which will shortly break
out in aid of a suburban Anglican church, has one
case of Australian wine on the manifest of the
gospel ship, to be raffled for per medium of the
snowball or the lucky-bag, or some such innocent
stepping-stone to the art of gambling. The
revenue officers should keep at least half an eye
on these pious fancy fairs.
Writes my Melb. correspondent:—
“ Ancient mariner Brassey took his “swearing-
in ” more calmly tlian his predecessor, and, when
the formalities were concluded, faced inspection
with folded arms and boots pressed down hard,
like a school-boy Casabianca rehearsing the burn-
ing-deck scene. Lady Brassey, too, kept cool and
examined the presentation-bouquet of Sydney
flannel-flowers and boronia (were there no Vic-
torian blossoms available ?) through up-lifted eye-
glass with at least a semblance of interest, which
was generally regarded as a healthy symptom.
To the very last, the ’augiity countess invariably
forgot to bestow a glance on the floral offerings of
the faithful, and once, at a society function, when
her son (gastronomically reckless like most juven-
iles) covertly filched and nibbled rose-leaves from
his mother’s posy, its owner was none the wiser.
“ Melbourne’s new vice-regal dame, who is tall
enough to take a bird’s-eye view pf hubby’s top-
hair, if required, saw the ‘'swearing-in ’ in pale-
grey crepon with white chiffon vest and touches
of magenta in her bonnet, while her shorter half
played his favorite role of ‘a mariner bold’ in
naval uniform and rather more sunburn than his
features could conveniently accommodate. With
him came Cant. Wallington, scarlet-clad as of old,
and attache Shaftesbury, round-faced and bullet-
headed, vide, Collins-street photos.
“Chief Justicess Madden faced the moment of
abdication with a smiling countenance, and ap-
parently tookcomfortin imparting to her neophyte
successor such useful wrinkles as the advisability
of frequent pivot-like revolutions to ‘ give ’em all
a show,’ and the value of ecstatic bouquet sniffing
as a yawn antidote, and so on. The dethroned
empress made her exit in the pensive toilette
which had chastened the opening of the Artists’
Carnival, her daughters counteracting the festive
effect of their big white sleeves by funereal black
stripes.
“Most people went to the opening of the Vic.
Artists’ Carnival, and found it a somewhat dis-
appointing spectacle, as stall-holders, fixings, and
surroundings generally proved to be own cousins
to those of the ordinary Philistine bazaar. The
artists, themselves, sounded the first chime in the
knell of expectation. Squat patriarchs and baldish
bachelors in floppy tail-coats and baggy boots were
cold comfort to those who reckoned upon velvet
jackets and flowing curls, not to speak of Bohe-
mian collars and taper fingers. Nevertheless,
after the first plunge, spectators opened their eyes
to the fact that bric-ikbrao, human and otherwise,
was not altogether absent. Melbourne’s alleged
“Beauty’’ really looked the part in a noble
Gainsborough toilette of pale-pink satin, her
soft golden hair, “rolled” in the fashion of the
period, crowned by a picturesquely-plumed hat.
The race-game, run by a society-syndicate m
powder and patches, was a centre of attraction,
thanks to the energy displayed by Speaker Berry’s
vivacious dark-eyed daughters, and the becoming
small-clothes of their male coadjutors. Mrs.
Baronet Clarke, amiable as ever, hawked round
the evergreen wax doll, and, in virtue of office,
wore a white frilled apron over her heliotrope
gown, as did tier colleague, a well-known military
daine, who otherwise affected the ugly ducklings
of her wardrobe.
“The opening ceremony was put through by
His Acting-Ex. and party, Miss Lucy Madden
looking fresh as a rose in a black hat and skirt,
worn with a soft yellow chiffon blouse, its sleeves
of a deeper shade, besprinkled with goldy-silk
pansies. The ct ing-Governoress, like every
second matron outside the frisky brigade, had
violets in her bonnet and a half-mourning gown
in stripes of black and white.
“The Quakers’ Stall was one of the carnival
disappointments. One reads of fair “Friends”
and pretty Puritans, but, unless the uniform of
the artists’ “ Shakeress ” is howling libel,
Miles Standish and friend Phineas were extra
susceptible, even for very good young men. The
much-vaunted “ dove-like-Quaker bonnet” turns
out to be a hideous grey hood, which disguises its
wearer as a “ Little Sister of the Poor,** or a Mrs.
Gamp, subject to ear-ache ; according as her figure
happens to be meagre or inclined to embonpoint.
Toe artists were in despair, at first, when they
found the carnival must discontinue for nearly
two days on account of the swearing-in. But
there’s a silver lining to every cloud, and, at the
much-abused function aforesaid, stallholders, who
were in the side-wings preparing to resume busi-
ness as soon as Gov. B. was off the premises, rose
to the occasion and did a brisk business in after-
noon-tea. The miracle of the loaves and fishes
was hardly more popular in its day than the
action of these smart girls in ministering (at a
profit, of course) to the wants of Friday’s parched
throng, chained to their chairs for fear of losing
them, from one till four, and frequently harrowed
up by false reports of the procession’s alleged
arrival.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

The aggravating good humor of a Melb.
crowd under trying circumstances was again
shown on the occasion of the beaching of Brassey.
H.E. was advertised to arrive promptly at two,
and at 1.30 an enormous crowd had gathered
about St. Kilda esplanade and pier, but the pre-
liminary swilling and soapy gabble on the steamer
postponed the V.R. landing till about 3.15, and
during all that time the people stood around,
and baked in a sweltering sun. When the funeral
moved, the cheering along the line of march had
a feminine and juvenile ring in it, but, on the
whole, the people seemed glad to see H.E., and
willing to make the most of a gubernator who is a
solid man, and a out above the average grinning
figure-head sent along to “ govern ” “ our depen-
dencies.”
Inside the Exhibition Building, however, where
the favored 6000 who were “ class enough ”
to be officially invited to the swearing-in were
penned up for two hours, there was a very
obvious display of cultured disgust and yawning
ennui. It was felt that somebody was to blame
for keeping a whole raft of the very best people
gaoled up beyond the reach of drinks, to be
played to the verge of idiocy by a brass band,
so when, after many disappointments, the vice-
regal pair were led in, the upper circles main-
tained a certain hauteur that cast a chill over the
hasty proceedings. The cursing-in had lasted two
hours and a half, the swearing-in lasted ten
minutes ; then the Brasseys escaped, and the first
families slowly fought their way out, everybody
wondering how anybody else could have been such
a fool as to come.
The invited guests at the swearing-in of Gover-
nor Brassey—all high-nosed and imperious people
of ancient lineage—-shuddered visibly when Mrs.
Premier Turner tripped upon the platform and
presented Her Ex. with a bouquet. The proceed-
ing jarred on their highly-strung organisms.
Obviously, it was felt that the country had lost
prestige by trusting this small but important cere-
mony to a mere “Missis.” Any stamped-and-
registered “ Lydy ” would have done —the
Speaker’s “Lydy ” or the “Lydy ” of the lone
baronet. Why should not “our titled families’
be packed on top at show-time?
Driving back to Government House the Brasseys
had their first glimpse of Melbourne’s trouble.
Hitherto the extremely-poor had been lost sight
of behind the thick ranks of well-dressed and
apparently prosperous people; but between
Princes’ Bridge and the gates of the vice-regal
abode were gathered scores of miserable-looking,
ragged, poverty-stricken men, women and children,
arrayed there exactly as if spurred by a cynical
bitterness of spirit to get up a demonstration of
their own, and give their Excellencies a glimpse
of the gingerbread beneath the gilt.
Lord Brassey has aged considerably since his
last visit to Australia. Apparently all the por-
traits here were taken years ago. He is quite
grey, “ sideboards ” and all, and looks a hale man
of 60. On Friday he was sporting the corned-
beef complexion of a bluff, old sea-dog. There
was none of the paleness and languor of Hopetoun
about him, nor did he exhibit any of the young
Scotchman’s painful agitation ; he was cordial but
self-contained, and worked his gracious nod with
a due respect for the gubernatorial spine. As for
Lady 8., either that pleasant-looking young per-
sonage is a consummate actress, or she regarded
the whole shivoo as a most delightful picnic. She
laughed throughout the march round as if she
fully appreciated the joke, and realised that Mel-
bourne was being had on toast, as it would find
out when it came to know Thomas even half as
well as she did.
According to the papers, Premier Turner was
to ride in the same carriage with the Brasseys
in the procession, and when the head of the
Government was not visible in the shay all sorts
of thrilling rumors flew about, it being even
hinted that he was driven off at the point of Free-
man Thomas’s sword.
• • »
All the addresses read to Governor Brassey
by the local Mayors and other small fry had to
be submitted in advance to Private Secretary
Wallington, who remorselessly cut out great
pieces of bad grammar and bad grovel, and re-
fixed the spelling and punctuation, and generally
made the wretched documents look as publishable
ns he knew how. Generally, the lofty peroration
which had been fixed up by the united efforts of
the town-olerk and the inspector of nuisances was
sacrificed altogether; and the very long words
were excised for fear the Mayor should fall
oyer them. Then a clean copy of the re-
vised document was made out, and the Mayor
went out and learned it by heart in the
backyard, to the surprise and alarm of
the house oat, which spat at him and then fled
into the washhouse; and people looking over the
fence could see his washup in his shirt sleeves and
with his weskit unbuttoned declaiming to the
broom which stood up against the wall, and telling
it that its arrival marked an epoch in the history
of Victoria. Most of the local mayors in the last
few days before Brassey’s arrival took to firing off
the address of welcome in their sleep; and even as
they walked along the street in the day-time a
glazed expression would suddenly come over them,
and their thoughts would go far, far away, and
they would point a short, thick finger at the banana-
cart man and tell him that his presence was a
bright augury for the future of the country. If
Gov. B had been delayed a week longer, at least
four mayors would have gone into violent lunacy,
and read their address of welcome for the remain-
der of their lives in Yarra Bend.
• * *
Melb. sassiety scribblers have discovered
that the Hon. Miss Brassey has “ a beautiful
brass-mounted goat-cart,” intended to be drawn
by an educated “Billy.” After this announce-
ment, Vic. Parliamentarians will probably break
their necks in their hurry to repeal the local law
against working goats in harness.
• • •
The great Brassey grovel reached stupen-
dous proportions in the last day or two before that
hardy gubernatorial mariner reached Melbourne.
The Mayor and council of Warrnambool tele-
graphed to Brassey at Adelaide, asking him to
steer his yacht close inshore as he passed their
town so that he might hear them firing a salute of
welcome. The Portland councillors tried to go
one better by signalling some touching words of
welcome from the signal-station as the yacht went
by, but the use of the station was ruthlessly
denied them. So when Brassey’s vessel was about
due, in the dead waste and centre of the night,
they drove to Oape Nelson, and there on the wet
sands, among the seaweed and the crabs, and with
the midnight wind blowing the spray through
their whiskers, they solemnly welcomed the pass-
ing Governor by waving lamps at him. They
were seen, and lamps were waved in return, and
then they got back home again at 3 a.m. and were
happy. Also, some of them had a bad cold, and

Vice-Governor Madden was called upon,
in the absence of the sounding Brassey, to declare
the Melb. Artists’ Carnival duly opened, and
seized upon the opportunity to relieve his sur-
charged feelings with regard to the Gaiety Girls,
whom he declared to be creatures of loveliness
and light and joy, who devoted themselves to the
glorious work of elevating mankind and their own
heels at the same time, and who by their strenuous
efforts to make that carnival a success, and by
their beautiful presence on that auspicious occa-
sion. showed how devoted they were to Art, and
how anxious they were to exert themselves in a
good cause. At this stage a hoarse whisper was
borne to His Waxcellency to the effect that the
Gaiety girls were not in the building, that they
had never had anything whatever to do with the
show, and for heaven’s sake would His Magnifi-
cence switch off. Then Gov. Madden blushed a
beautiful shell-pink all over his regal baldness,
and coughed twice, and said that anyhow it was a
very nice carnival, and sat down, and tried to
hide his discomposure in his hat. Soon after-
wards a large, dignified gentleman of middle age,
disguised in a waxed moustache, was seen behind
a railway-truck on the wharf, surreptitiously
tearing the feeble remnants of a noble head of
hair, as the ship bearing away the Gaiety co. slid
over the horizon.
Gov. Madden’s absurd mistake was per-
haps due to his being misled by the powdered
surface of the stallkeepers at the Artists’ Carnival.
It wasn’t within the bounds of probability that J.
C. Williamson would let the Gee-Gees draw the
public to a rival show. But the Chief Justice
didn’t stop to think what he was saying. His
mind was perhaps fully occupied with the thought
of how vice-regal he looked when he was saying it.

It is rumored that Governor Brassey made
his triumphal entry into Victoria with the re-
mains of a very bad black eye, acquired through
falling against the binnacle or something one
dark night when the stormy winds did blow, and
chat his head was swollen and very tender owing
to a rope falling on it.

An up-to-date reading—“ Every billet has

Another batch of (five) Victorian lady
missionaries has arrived at Sydney, en route
to China and Corea. The Bulletin advises
them, if they have any respect for the feelings of
their male white friends, never to stir out of doors
in the Chinese baokblocKs without carrying
poison. The most effective and portable preven-
tive to being hacked about by filthy Chinamen
while you are still alive is hydrocyanic acid—
packed in a homoeopathic medicine-vial, which
can be put into the mouth and cracked with the
teeth at the right time. It kills you instantly : a
friend of the present writer’s, who was dying by
inches of cancer, took it one evening and was dead
so quickly that he had not time to carry out his
intention of dropping the phial out of the window
at which he sat.
Thus Curzon in his “Problems of the Far
East ” :—“ A steamer rarely sails from American
shores for Yokohama without carrying a bevy of
young girls fresh from schoolroom and seminary,
who, with the impetuous innocence of youth, are
about to devote their young lives to what they
conceive to be the noblest of causes in Japan and
China. Only last year, at Kuei-hwa-chang, a
friend of mine encountered a missionary com-
munity of one male and twenty Swedish girls.
The society which iiad committed the outrage of
sending out these inhooent girls only allowed
them 200 dollars, or £27 10s. a year apiece, for
clothes and lodging.”

Victoria is making a “ record ” in the
matter of woman-hanging.
# # #
A holocaust of hanging at Cup-time. On
Monday, the day before, three people are to be

(no doubt in a fit of madness) killed her child at
Melbourne, and two coloured murderers convicted
in Queensland. On the day after the Cup, Lynch
is to be hanged at Adelaide for the murder of his
nephew.

In barbarous Russia, the other day, the
authorities decided to hang eight men. Hanging
is a punishment rarely inflicted in the domains of
the Czar, being usually commuted to life-long
labor. To obtain a hangman for the occasion
official advts. were published far and wide, but
for weeks not a single volunteer responded, until
a solitary blacksmith offered to perform the duties
of public assassin. In Queensland, some years
ago, the hangmanship fell vacant, and nearly 200
applications for the billet came in out of a total
population of under 400,000. But, then, Russia is
a barbarous land.

Stylishly-dressed, upstanding, high-stepping lady
carrying an umbrella horizontally in her left hand.
In her right an enamel-handled pair of carrying
straps, holding in perpendicular position a large
envelope with the following words copper-plated
thereon : “To the Right Hon. Thomas; Lord
Brassey ; Petition for Patronage. ”

London World is the “ aristocratic ”
weekly par excellence, and it is amusing to see how
it speaks of the class of peers to which Brassey
and Hampden belong. Sir Edward Malet, late
ambassador in Berlin, was lately offered a peer-
age. But by taking it he would have reduced, in
the order of Court precedence, his wife, who is the
daughter of a duke.
If (says the World) her husband were to be made a
peer, she would rank as his wife, and not as the daughter
of her father. This being so, Sir Edward Malet prefer!
that Lady Ermyntrude should retain the position which
is hers by right of birth, and not yield precedence to
Lady Tagrag, Lady Bobtail, and the other wives of the
bounder barons of recent times.
Delicious ! “ Bounder barons of recent times.”
“ Bounder Baron Brassey.” What a lovely even-
ing-paper thunderstriker!

Brassey, the chief topic of local conversation.
Elderly spinsters, without legs, have almost gone

The triumphal-arch at Prince’s Bridge, for
Brassey, was like that put up for Hotharn 41 years
ago. It bore the motto, “Victoria Welcomes
Victoria’s Choice,” but the then democratic
Argus said the words ought to be “Hobson’s
Choice.”

Dean Stretch, of Adelaide, has been

that “ the one and only check upon any unjust or

thing were just as it should be, nothing would

A most effective vote of censure has, in
the eternal fitness of thing, been passed on the
N.S.W. Crown Law Dept, by a common sweep.
The Bulletin, while in no way impugning the
good faith and scientific accuracy of official-
analyst Hamlet, recognises that he is only mortal,
like all other analysts, and that the prisoner
should have been represented at the official
chimney-sweeping and soot-analysing operations.
The trap laid for the analyst by the sweep, however
unsuccessful and unnecessary it may have been,
serves as a most suggestive protest against the one-
sided methods of Botany Bay criminal prosecution.
Under a fair legal system the Crown would have
tested the value of the public analyst’s evidence
in a manner similar to that in which the over-
loquacious and blundering sweep endeavored to
test it.

The privileged Sydney lawyer, Rofe, con-
victed of partaking in the cold-blooded conspiracy
to fasten upon the innocent Mrs. Butler (now
slowly dying in the Alfred Hospital) the charge of
adultery, comes of a rich family of good standing,
who could, if necessary, find ten times the amount
of the security (.£2000) required in connection
with the farce of releasing their relative under
the First Offenders’ Act—which Act, accord-
ing to Judge Windeyer’s dictum of the other day,
A PARKES PAEAN
Parkes airs his politics in private life,
For he believes in actual demonstration j
The other day he took another wife
To show his strong belief in Federation.
Thus Federation’s virtues are displayed,
And in a way to crtish the least objection ;
He holds it vastly better than Freetrade,
And evidently better than Protection.
His work for Federation has been great,
His enemies now dare not underrate it;
He wants to see Australia one state,
And also seems to want to populate it.
“This hinfant State ” —or words to that effect—
Has often been his phrase, and not amiss, too.
It must be owned, at least in this respect.
He’s done his best to make her what she is, too.
No doubt his foes his recent deed may note,
But let such carping critics still remember
To have the decency to not-to-quoto
That ancient gag about “May and December.”
Out here December is as hot as—well
A certain place that’s preached of by the
Primate,
While May is cold—so Parkes may safely tell
His critics that he represents the climate.

JJ-.S. Wales Crown Law Office unduly
“ rushed ” the latest trials of Dean. Prisoner was
arrested on Oct. 8, charged with making a false
declaration. Within 17 days he has been tried
before both the Police and Central Criminal
Courts. No matter what a man’s alleged crime,
he is'entitled to a deliberate hearing ; the practice
of committing an accused person from the Police
Court to a higher Court, sitting at the time, is
most dangerous and unjudicial, as in a sensational
case the excitement has no time to cool down, and
the jury are unconsciously influenced by one-sided
newspaper talk.
Salomons, Q. 0., has frequently expressed
his disapproval of committing prisoners straight-
way from lower Courts to sentencing Courts, as
the Crown officials are hurried in tiling true bills,
and the rush may result in a case being poorly
defended. (Witness the original Dean trial, which
commenced on April 4, prisoner being committed
at the police-court only eleven days previously.)
Chief Justice Darley and more than one of his
colleagues are also known to be very averse to the
practice.

Some of Dean’s defenders feel extremely
galled. “ I’m very sorry,” remarked one promin-
ent person, “ that I ever had anything to do with
the wretched business. Why, I took that man to
my house, introduced him to my wife and
daughters, and treated him just as a member of
the family. I shudder to think that we were
harboring a poisoner all the time. It might have
been worse, though. I’m not so sure that, if
Dean confessed to me, I wouldn’t have held the
secret. Then there’d be the devil to pay.”
A Richmond (Yic.) pawnbroker has altered

The Oriental Carnival, according to all
accounts, will blot the Victorian artists’ ditto
clean out of public recollection. The artists had
no funds to play with, and, although a mob of
enthusiasts were understood to be “working to
make the affair a great success,” their ideas on
the subject of show-manufacture were soft.
People who prattle art-jargon and supply little
sassiety-journals with paragraphs re their sub-
urban committee-meetings are soft, as a rule.
The Oriental Carnival, on the other hand, is a
Hebrew scheme, backed-up by hard-cash, and
arranged with a keen eye to pizness. The Israelite
at the head of it doesn’t look only to Jewish
sentiment for support, but invites the Gentile
world in general to pay a shilling for “the most
gigantic entertainment ever attempted at the
price.” Rather than run the risk of putting th e
artists up to a few wrinkles, the Oriental manager
was careful not to advertise the strength of hia
pn>grainme until the other show had fairly started.
You don’t catch an Israelite giving away anything
that a rival might profitjby. #
The feature of the Melb. Artists’ Carnival
was the four-horse drag traversing Collins-street

One of the pleasant
effects of Melb. Artists’
Carnival has been the
production, by many of
the brush men and women
themselves, of a number
of really delightful win-
dow-posters, advertising
the affair. In the prin-
cipal city shops are pic-
tures —perhaps a score in
all—comic, serious, or
femininely “ fetching ”
done in water-color or
black -and - white, an-
nouncing theshow. Some
of them are delicious bits
of work, dainty studies
in windblown skirt and
lace, or quaint designs
ingeniously worked out.
There ought now to be a
local boom in artistic
posters, as there is in
Paris and London, after
this demonstration of
what local artists can do.

The friendly societies which worked so
hard for the hospitals in Sydney Domain on Sun-

amount raised had they, like the Eight Hour
people, established a lottery in connection with
the movement. The Government which sanctions
a lottery—call it an art-union if you like—to swell
the funds of Labor processionists should tmcounter
no spiritual scruples in extending the official im-
primatur to a similar device for aiding such insti-
tutions as public hospitals. In France the hospi-
tals obtain a generous sum (say, iIIGO.OOO a year)
from a three per cent, tax imposed by Government
on the stakes in horse-racing.

A Chinese leper was recently arrested in a Melbourne

Wuu Lung, the flaky leper, by the laundry table
A fearful thing to look on, seamed and shrivelled

And he mauls the snowy linen with his lean,

By day or night he labors as the master Chow
decrees.
He tills his mouth with water, and he lightly
blows a spray .
Oil that shirt-front most expansive, and his irons
swiftly go; . , . ..
For the owner, Percy Banker, is a bounder in his

And his linen must be “ bang-up,” or there a

her brow.
And on his glossy shirt-front rests her dainty,

Readers of The Bulletin will recollect
some time ago a warm discussion was carried on
in these columns as to the respective advantages
of life in the bush and life in the city. As Sir
Roger de Coverley remarked on a famous
occasion: “There is much to be said on both
sides.” From a lady’s point of view one of the
keenest disadvantages of an existence in the
country is the difficulty she experiences in supply-
ing her wants in the way of ribbons, laces and the
thousand and one articles of feminine attire.
This difficulty, however, almost vanishes in face
of the fact that a twopenny stamp brings her
within reach of the vast resources of Mark Foy’s
establishment in Sydney.*

by publishing the Greville Memoirs with the

The Wild-Cat Column .
The National Bank of Australasia has arrived
at the natural result (anticipated by Tub Bulletin with
monotonous regularity for the last three half-years) of its
unwise anxiety to pay divs. and take little thought
for the morrow. For the last four half-years the
net profits have been respectively £31,312, £25,231,
£15,125, and (for the present half) £13,762, so that each
six months things have been worse than they were the
one before. This falling-off has continued despite a large
reduction in working expenses, which are now £lB,OOO a
year less that in ’93. In the face of this evidence of
trouble ahead the management has, ever since the recon-
struction, systematically paid away almost all its profits
in divs., and the amount thus spent in two and a half
years is no less than £86,813. No addition has been
made to reserve during this period, nor has any
special provision been made, so far as appears, for
possible depreciation in securities. Now it is an-
nounced that the whole of the existing reserve
(£100,000) will have to be carried to a fund for “the
equalisation of the dependencies of the bank,” which
seems to be a polysyllabic way of saying something
unpleasant. And in spite of this stupendous writing-off,
and the continuous fall in the profits, the 5 per cent. div.
on preference shares is paid as usual. It is about time
someone took the management aside and asked it, in a
serious tone of voice, where it thinks- it is going to.
Doubtless it is morally bound to pay its div. on preference
shares so long as the necessary amount is earned, but if
losses are not provided for out of the half-year’s takings,
then the alleged profit can’t be said to be earned in any
legitimate sense of the word.

The National Bank has a magnificent business
Which, so far as can be judged, keeps up remarkably well
despite all trade fluctuations. Also, it has paid up the
stipulated 4J per cent, interest regularly ; and it has the
colossal cash reserve of £1,800,000, and another
£700,000 in Govt, debentures. Yet with all this mass of
coin earning hardly any profits it has paid off only
£500,000 of its reconstructed deposits in two years. On the
surface of things, the National should be in a posi-
tion to release one instalment at all events, and
thereby s ive a portion of the heavy outlay for in-
terest. The National, even in its present depressed state,
is in a much better situation than most Australian banks,
but considering its possibilities it is in a much w-orse state
than It ought to be, and the desire to pay divs. which
shouldn’t be paid, and to show sensational cash reserves,
are two of the causes of the trouble.

The Colonial Bank of Australasia, which lately
obtained a reduction of interest on fixed deposits from 4J-
to 2J per cent., has closed its half-year with a profit of
£7BO. Last half-year showed a loss of £4694, so the posi-
tion has improved to the extent of £5474. The profit,
according to the directors’ report, would have been larger
but for two things : the reduction of interest was only in
force during a part of the half-year, and the expenses of
the second reconstruction had to be metoutof'the profits.
As the report doesn’t state the exact date at which the
new arrangement came into force, or what the aforesaid
expenses amounted to, it is impossible to tell with absolute
certainty whether the half-year just ended has been a
little better or a good deal worse than the previous one.
The figures, how-ever, look none too cheerful. For the
half-year ended 30th Sept., ’94, the Colonial made a gross
profit of £29,168. Next half, the gross profits dropped to
£18,791. This time they are £23,084. As the reduced
rate of interest was in force for at least three months of
the half-year, however, it seems that, under the old cir-
cumstances, the gross profits would have been only about
£16,000, which means that the fading-away process is still
going on. The expenses have been reduced over £lOOO
compared with the previous six months, and but for this
remorseless screwing-down there would have been another
loss, despite the reduction of deposit-interest. Within
the last 12 months expenses have been reduced at the
rate of £9OOO per annum, and still they have not been
able to keep pace with the falling-off in the profits. And
there must come a time when expenses can be reduced no
further.
When the Companies Act becomes law the
Colonial proposes to write off a portion of its capital to
provide for losses. No information is supplied as to the
probable amount of these losses, but the advances amount
to £2,650,000. If it were found necessary to write off 10
per cent, of this amount it would mop up half the ordinary
paid-up capital, while 20 per cent, would absorb the whole
of it. As the net profits, despite the reduction in
deposit-interest, are barely 4s. per cent, per annum
on capital, it seems reasonable to assume that a con-
siderable proportion of the investments are more
or less lost. At all events the advances, on a rough
estimate, and so far as the scanty information goes, seem
to yield about 4.) per cent, per annum all round, and as
no bank habitually lends out its money at 4J per
cent, this average appears to suggest that a good pro-
portion of the investments are either temporarily or per-
manently dead. The smallness of the returns is not
owing to any large amount of unprofitable coin on hand,
for the Colonial’s coin-reserve—though quite large enough
considering that it has just fixed up a boom-proof recon-
struction and can’t possibly be rushed by creditors—is
very nearly the smallest in Australasia. Next balance-
sheet, when there are no reconstruction expenses and the
reduced rate of deposit interest is in full operation,
should show an improvement, but though the Colonial
ought—considering its special advantages—to come out
all right in the end, there is nothing to whoop about in
its present circumstances.

The terms on which the B.N.Z. is to buy up the
Colonial, so far as the cable information goes, do not
seem calculated to make the latter institution's share-
holders feel good. The purchase price of the business is
nominally £461,211. Of this £133,906 is to be handed
over in cash, which means 13s. per share for the Colonial
proprietary. The remaining £327,305 is to be held pend-
ing the realisation of doubtful accounts, and the local
impression is that when the realisation is com-
pleted the shareholders will get out of this sum only
between £70,000 and £BO,OOO. Sundry alleged assets
which the B.N.Z. refuses to take over at all will probably
yield enough to make the total £1 2s. 6d. per share. This
means £225,000 rescued out of £465,000 of alleged capital
and reserve fund. If these calculations represent the true
state of affairs the Colonial is sacrificing a good deal to
get rid of its business and charging nothing for good-will,
and, considering that the business pays 6 per cent. divs.
on £400,000 capital, it seems to be going remarkably
cheap.

Barnato’s South African bank, lately floated in
London, is a fine example of how money is made by the
mysterious process of sitting in an office and writing
things on a bit of paper. Barney Barnato, a retired acro-
bat, started the bunk and sold to himself 2,500,000 shares
at £1 each. Also he gave himself the option of taking up
the remaining million shares at £3 each. Then he sold a
lot of his own mining and other properties to the
bank, and the bank, which was exclusively himself,
made a big profit out of them, or at least Barnato,
who was the whole management and directorate, said
it did. So far the bank consisted of Barnato selling
his own shares to himself, and buying his own mines from
himself, and paying himself a big div. out of the profits.
But now he sold 500,000 of his shares to a syndicate at £2
each. Then he began to sell a few to the public at £3
each, and finally he bumped great masses of scrip into the
London market, and, at latest, the public was taking all
it could get at £4 10s., just 4J times as much as Barnato
paid himself for them a year or two ago. And yet nobody
except Barnato himself seems to know anything about
the bank, and nobody seems to know much about
Barnato, save that he is a retired circus-tumbler who has
struck it rich at Johannesburg.

of £9141 was also brought) forward from Sept., ’94, A

making it,£62,C00; £lOOO to the fund to provide for un-
adjusted losses, making It £5000; £316 Is written off
furniture i and £9214 is carried forward. The United In-
surance Co. has more different varieties of reserves than
any other that Tim Bulletin is acquainted with, and
when the reserve-fund and the re insurance reserve-fund
and the reserve for unadjusted losses and the reserve for
equalisation of dividends and the reserve for depreciation
of investments are all added together they amount to
£81,600, which is a pretty solid line of defence.

A- railways last year yielded a profit of £‘d
28. 6d. percent., which is a big drop from the£3 10s. 9d. of
the previous year. As the money for railway construc-
tion was borrowed at a shade over 4 per cent., this means
that the railway deficit has suddenly gone up about
£50,000. The falling off in the Broken Hill traffic
has knocked the bottom out of the S.A. rail-
way business. Despite the addition of 58 miles of new
line, the receipts have dropped nearly £40,000 as com-
pared with last year, and the profits have declined £39,000.

“During the last five years,” says Brisbane

debt of Australia, involving an addition to the annual
interest hill of £660,000 a year, while the gross railway
earnings have increased by only £51,599.” Almost ail
railways which the present population could find work
for were built by 1890, and the lines constructed since
then have, as a rule, paid neither interest nor axle-grease.
Yet Queensland, which has already more railway in pro-
portion to population than any other country on earth,
except, perhaps, W.A., and the worst railway deficit on
this continent, is going to construct ten more lines
shortly. But, as Premier Nelson says, “ the compensa-

Twice last week, in N.S.W. District Court,
Judge Murray fixed 8 per cent, per an. as the legal
interest on money due. One of the cases was a little
remarkable. A financier claimed £69 10s. for money lent,
but adding to this sum the interest accruing in 13 months
he made out a gross claim for £246 14s. 6d. Compassion
for the debtor, or a desire to bring himself within the
of District Court law, induced him to knock off
-650 I make a present of it,” he said—thus reducing
the amount of claim to £196145. 6d. Judge Murray gave
a verdict for £69 10s., and awarded interest at the rate of
8 per cent, per an. for the 13 months-or about £75 in all.
8 per cent, may he a desirable figure, hut why does the
law permit each Judge to establish a figure of his own?

Stories of the ancient smash of a certain
Westerly bank are continually cropping up. Here is
One. A trader owed one of the directors a considerable
sura—thousands—for which the director pressed him
sorely. A little time before the collapse the trader
decided to “go broke," but first proceeded to the capital
to make a last appeal to his chief creditor. The latter
advised him to borrow £lO,OOO or so and start afresh
“But where am I to raise such a sum?” asked the trader’
“ Now, listen to me," quoth the D. “The bank is doing
a roaring trade just now—lately declared a rousing div.—
go and state your case ; go to-morrow morning. They’ll
give you an overdraft; have no misgivings about that."
Acting on this excellent advice, the trader saw the man-
ager, got an overdraft of £9OOO, paid the director
bought a fresh lot of stock with the balance, and went on
his way rejoicing. He sold most of the stock at a good
profit, with every probability of clearing the lot when
the bank went bung. So did the trader. The banfc col-
lared the balance of the stock, and the director winks his
eye when he meets the man who paid him.

On July 21 the fire broke out in Block 11 of
B.H. Proprietary. On Oct. 21 (just three months after-
wards) it first appeared in Block 10, the mine to the
south. At Block 10, threatened from the first, elaborate
precautions were taken ; courses of timber were removed,
and the spaces filled solidly with non-combustit)le tail-
ings, which, with the standing ore and rock, were thought
to thus form an impassable wall near tire boundary. As
the fire in Block 11 smouldered—and only a fortnight
ago Tins Bulletin stated that it still smouldered, and
that the position had never been more serious—and as
heavy blasting was done almost over the charred timbers,
subsidences, of course, took place ; and, as the result of
one of these, a fissure was probably formed, acting as a
conduit between the workings of the two mines. The
opening of the shafts near the affected ground in Block 11
supplied air at one end ; the fissure and an old mullock
pass in Block 10 supplied the outlet; and thus a good
draught was caused. How intensely heated was the air
which rushed out of the pass may be judged by the fact
that the timbers near the surface caught fire, though
there was not a stick of wood, and therefore not a spark
of fire, lor a depth of 150 feet below these few surface
pieces.
Firemen were able to at once go down Block 10
mine and approach to within a few yards of the burning
timbers. The sight was magnificent: there was no mere
smouldering here. In Block 11, it will be remembered,
the men could never fight the fire at close quarters—first
on account of the heavy smoke, then on account of the
ground being so broken. But there was a better draught
here, and the smoke was carried away ; also, the ground
was better stayed by pillars of ore and filled-in spaces.
Still, the firemen’s job is not a pleasant one ; and it is
not unusual for a man or two to be brought to the surface
overcome, either by smoke or the gases which are given
off. b
The great advantage Block 10 mine possesses
over Block 11 of the Proprietary mine is this; it has no
huge surface excavations, reaching down below the upper
timbers, and thus forming an inlet for air and an outlet
tor smoke. When the square-set system of timbering
with Oregon was introduced by ex-general manager
Patton, he never contemplated that the timbers would
be exposed like tins; and now that they are exposed,
and the whole conditions altered, it becomes urgently
necessary to consider whether the square-set system or
soft wood is still the best.
Capt. Thomas, underground manager of Block
10, is credited with saying that “for weeks past he had
expected the fire to reach Block JO ; and when he heard
last week that Block 11 was to be opened up he knew
they would have it quickly.” He also speaks of “ a mine
that caught fire in the Burra, S. A., 38 years ago, and
burned for two years. It was opened up at the end of 12
months, but had to be shut down again, as the fire was
as bad as ever.” A pleasant prospect for Proprietary
shareholders, at any rate, seeing that Block 11 is still the
best part of the mine.
Next the Block 10 is the Central; but that is
safe.

B.H. Junction half-yearly report (to Sept. 30)
is the most satisfactory docuraeut issued by this 00. since
that great and good man, Jolly, reigned there The
directors now, in view of the development off M‘lntyre’s
shaft, speak of the “practically unlimited” supplies of
sulphides. The directors, it seems, have two proposals
under consideration. The Camden syndicate first w-
gestedabig sale of the ore ; then, having (so the directors
say), secured 40,000 Junction shares, proposed the recon-
struction of the company, “ with a duplication of the
capital and the establishment of a London register ”
The latter proposal was made after the M’lntyre develop-
ment ; further particulars are awaited by the directors.
Junction sulphides are fairly rich in both silver
and leadf While the ore of, say, the South mine is worth
about Boz. silver and 60 per cent. lead, this is worth on
the average 25 to 30oz. silver, and 30 to 40 per cent. lead.
The ore from the M‘lntyre development goes about 30 to
350 z. silver, and 35 per cent. lead.
A start has been made with the new concentrat-
ing plant (Hancock’s patent) for the British B.H This
mine is now supplying a small quantity of sulphides to
Block 14. By the way, the weekly returns supplied by
the latter 00. would be much more valuable if it was
shown what quantity of its own and what of bought ore
had been concentrated. Also, “ the usual fair assav for
silver and lead ” is hardly a satisfactory statement of the
result of the work of concentrating ; but no other is given '
to shareholders and public.

the Govt., and praying for a big thunderstorm.” Less
than a month ago it was understood in the East that
there was plenty water on the field. The rains this winter
were above the known average; scores of shafts have
been sunk below water-level, and, so far, batteries do not
consume one-tenth the water required on any permanent
goldfield. Millions subscribed in London long ago to find
gold ; nolhingfor water. It looks as if this summer the Cool-
gardie water-difficulty will be worse than ever, and that
fever will secure hundreds of victims. Tens of thousands
of people in a waterless waste is serious business for the
W.A, Govt.

Bayley’s last crushing went a little over 7dwt.
At the half-yearly meeting last week the directors
regretted many things; mostly the want of gold, and
consequently, absence of divs. No important discoveries
have been made. “The scarcity of water continues a
source of difficulty and expense. Six acres of land have
been purchased 12 miles from Perth. This is in every
way suitable for a battery-site, and gives ample space for
cyanide works in case it is decided to erect them later
on.” It was also decided that in future only payable
stone should be put through the battery; that further
exploration work should be done, and that part of the
battery, not required should be thrown open for public
use. This is the first intimation we have read of the
existence of non-payable stone in Bayley’s. This mine
has a market value to-day of over £200,000, while its real
value is probably nearer as many shillings—possibly not
as many pence. Many people bought at £1 since the iaso

market will expose its real value.

The discovery of a piece of gold about the size
of a man s hand in the Boulder mine, has led to the
posting of a notice, to the effect that all miners employed
there are to submit themselves to be searched on landing.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Premier Kingston is searching for eligible
Liberals with whom to fight Conservative consti-
tuencies next year.
Neild, M.L.A. (N.S.W.): “At the pre-
sent time an M.P. is simply a perambulating
labor bureau, and his life is a sorrow to him from
daylight till dark by reason of political patron-
age.”
A thing to be placed to the credit of the
Reid Govt, is that, defying the most honored of
Botany Bay Executive traditions, it has never
yet disregarded a jury’s recommendation to mercy
in a capital case.
Murray Smith, the Yic. Freetrade M.L.A,,
objects to the suppression of sweating by Act of
Parliament. It should be put down, he thinks, by
the force of public opinion. Query : When did
the mere force of public opinion put down any-
thing?
It is pointed out that the Victorian
Speaker now only gets£looo a-year, and the chair-
man of Assembly Committees £4OO, whereas the
N.S.W. Speaker gets £l5OO and the Chairman
£BOO. N.S. Wales has not yet seriously begun to
retrench.
Gem from the wisdom of Morrison re
Chinamen : “ With regard to the competition
between the European and Chinese in the labor-
market the former must inevitably succumb. Of
two currencies in a country the baser will always
supplant the better.”
It has the appearance of Liberal progress,
anyhow. Last week N.S.W. Leg. Council passed
the second reading of Reid’s Land-tax Assess-
ment Bill by 30 to 11. In ’B6 the same Council
rejected the second reading of the Jennings
Land-Tax Bill by 23 to 7, although the Reid Bill
means a tax of Id. in the £, whereas the Jennings
Bill only claimed a half-penny.
Dr. Bowker, M.L.C., the most inveterate
opponent of all new political ideas, is now of one
age with Parkes, and began work on his own
account early in his teens. He has been working
ever since, and even now earns his week’s income
by personal industry. When he rises in N.S. W.
Council to speak in the interests of property his
cry is as that of a man in the grip of garrotters.
Just before his death, the late Barrister
Healy—in his day, perhaps, the foremost N.S.W.
expert in criminal law—was engaged in reviewing
the Mount Rennie case at the instance of the
Crown Law Department. The Bulletin under-
stands that Mr. Healy had got far enough into
the matter to see that the surviving prisoners
should be released. Will some M.P. please ques-
tion Ablepharus Gouldi in this matter?
On Rylstone (N.S.
Wales) hustings,
M. L. A. Fitzpatrick
admitted that he had
received and attended
to 700 letters from his
constituents in seven
weeks. His opponent,
Wall, charged the Min-
istry with acts of cor-
ruption and bribery in
wiring to all parts of
the electorate stating
that sums of money
were being granted for
different works.
Dear Bulletin, —
The fact of a squatter
up Tenterfield way
holding 46,800 acres
for a rental of £l2 10s.
per annum seems te
surprise you. But a
more surprising fact is
that if the same land
were taken up by a
parcel of selectors as
conditional leases, the
Govt, would extort
from them £390 per
annum rental, with the
privilege of purchasing
their leases at £1 per
acre. I have calculated
the rental to the selec-
tors at the minimum
of 2d. per acre, but it is
more often 4d. than 2d.
Only pure road-metal,
unadorned with grass,
would meet with a
minimum rental from
any self - respecting
land-board. Yet we
are continually being
told that it is the small
holder the Govt, wishes
to encourage. Is it ?
Go on the land, ye
idiots 1 go on the land !
-—One of Thru.
One clause of Minister Peacock’s Yic.
Factory Bill provides that no factory or work-
room where any Chinaman is employed shall be
used as a sleeping place under pain of a heavy
fine. J. Beef Patterson complains that the clause
is dangerous and tyrannical. “ What is to be
done,” asked the butcher of Oastlemaine, “ when
a Chinaman falls asleep over his work ? ” “ Wake
him up,” answered the brief and practical
Peacock.
Governor Braasey’s “ only desire in leaving
his home in England and coming to Victoria was
that he might assist in strengthening the bond
between the colonies and the mother-country.”
The 4 per cent. bond.
A terrible fear besets the Fat Men of
Oentralia lest the Nelson Govt, be ousted and its
place supplied by a Liberal-cim-Labor party.
Rather than see this they would sacrifice all they
once held dear—even Separation itself. The
Hughenden-Winton extension spells disaster to
Rockhampton, but her legislators would rather
see it a thousand times over than be the means of
upsetting the Boodlewraith and helping in the
party of Reform.
The bill providing that every domestic
Biddy in Maoriiand shall have a weekly half-
holiday, and that if she is not driven out, in the
rain if necessary, to have her half-holiday she shall
be deemed to have been unlawfully kept in by her
mistress, or something to that effect, went over-
board the other day, among the unfinished busi-
ness of the session. Premier Seddon, who is
growing old with the incubus of much Biddy
legislation, was probably glad to see it.
One week, Premier Nelson would hear of
no attempt to shelve the Winton railway. Next
week, he allows a committee to consider the whole
question. Flabbiness or finesse; perhaps both.
North and Centre fight over Winton like dogs
over a bone, and the South can’t settle which side
to favor. New railways soon demoralise a House.
It is easy for an erstwhile honest man to persuade
himself that a line through his constituency would
pay well, however other lines might fare.
Premier Kingston objects to the admission
of Chinese into Australia, but protests against
those who are here being “made slaves of.”
This is just the root of the whole Chinese diffi-
culty. If “ those who are here ” would live and
work like free, self-respecting heathens there
would be little to say against them. But they are
not built that way. If the Chow is not made a
slave of by some richer Chow, or Chow co., he
will make a slave of himself on his own account.
It is his nature —bred in the bone of him for thou-
sands of grimy years.
When the bill for placing the N.S.W.
Civil Service under the control of commissioners
came before the Assembly, the old political
jobbers rose as one man, and moved that Parlia-
mentary officers, employes in the museum and art
galleries, the police force, the whole Education
Department and the Public Works Department
should be left under political rule as heretofore.
If they had succeeded they would probably have
gone on to exempt most of the other departments.
The old longing to “app’int Maloney” is still
strong in the politician’s soul.
J. L. Fegan, M.L.A., compares the pre-
sent N.S.W. Assembly to a temperance-lodge in
point of sobriety. This is one of the improve-
ments for which payment of members is directly
answerable. In days when men simply went into
the Legislature for “ honor and glory ” there was
little responsibility, less work (unless by pro-
minent office-barraokers), and endless refreshment-
room bibbing, to which some of the cleverest suc-
cumbed. Now the Parliamentarian has at least
to make a show of earning his screw. This
is a hard point for salary-hating Anxious Cameron.
ORGAN RECITAL
THIS day
jg
WHY SYDNEY CITY COUNCIL OBJECTS TO SIGNBOARDS.
The new British Tory Government is pre-
senting ultimatums in all directions. One has
been served on the black monarch of Ashantee,
who is to be annexed at an early date, and a par-
ticularly fierce ultimatum has been sent in to the
republic of Venezuela. The border-line of Vene-
zuela and British Guiana was always an unfixed
and dubious affair, but, a few years ago, a gold-
field was discovered on the debateable land between
the two States, and Britain promptly settled the
difficulty by annexing all the known gold-bearing
country and fixing the frontier as she darned well
pleased. Some officials who were found m the
Venezuelan end of the doubtful territory were un-
hesitatingly “chucked out,” and now the little
republic is warned that it must agree to the new
arrangement at once, or it will be disembowelled
and its remains dragged all over South America.
Why, The Bulletin again asks, should
N.S.W. (the only country in this hemisphere to
do so) accord free-postage to newspapers, con-
sidering the tremendous loss on her postal °P er^:
tions? It isn’t that the newspapers can t afford
to pay postage, seeing that the price of web-
printing paper is now 50 per cent, less than it was

a few years ago, and that over 50 per cent, is
being saved by machines on the cost of manual
type-setting. Hero is an item of at least .£40,000
unjustly lost to revenue, which no political party
—not even the Labor-party —dares to try and
save, for fear of losing its Parliamentary billet.
In fact, no M.P. dares to mention this matter,
even in face of the fact that the S.M. Herald,
which must be pocketing thousands a year by
free-postage, actually had the cheek to oppose the
institution of oompletely-free State education the
other day, on the ground that the province could
not afford it 1
Maorilaud Parliament having gob to that
stage of weariness when it is ready to throw the
whole country overboard in order to tinish the
session and get home, thirty-one bills were oast
out the other day in one act. The Referendum,
the Betterment Bill, the abolition of capital
punishment, the new Local Government system,
and the scheme for municipal fire insurance were
among the derelicts, which represented seven
weeks’ hard work sacrificed. Every year every
Australian Parliament winds up by a general
throwing overboard of half the unfinished work of
the session in sheer disgust and weariness, and
then it has to be all done over again, and thrown
overboard again in a half-finished state next
session, and so on ad infinitum. Half the un-
limited cackle of Parliament would be saved if
the unfinished business were taken up again next
session just where it left off, but no Legislature
has yet had sense enough to effect this very simple
and obvious reform.
Vic. Coroner YouTs guiding maxim :
“ There’s nothing so deceptive as eyesight, except
hearing.”
Professor Loisette is the man who delivered
a lecture on Memory at an American ladies’
school, and went away forgetting his umbrella.
In a Maoriiand city, Talmage’s remarks
were gibbered at by a bibulous stallite. A big
laugh resulted when, as the offender was being
passed outwards, he yelled, “ Yah, gar’n yer ole
Tui!” —Tui being Maoriland’s parson-bird or
magpie, a bird with jet-black plumes and a small
white-feathered necktie.
A wealthy 82-year-old identity, living in
retirement on a bay off Sydney Harbor, boasts
that though over 60 years in Sydney he has never
travelled further than Parramatta. The veteran
does not use the ferries, but rows over daily in his
own boat to parade streets which, when he first
saw them, were little better than sand-tracks.
There is only one officer in N.S.W. detec-
tive force who goes in for disguises. Ordinarily,
he looks the typical Yankee detective —clean-
shaven, with a brown-haired wig, soft hat, frock-
coat, and light-checked trousers —his occupation
can be told a mile away. When “made-up”—in
that way he does almost all his work —even his
closest acquaintances and brother officers do not
know him till he reveals his identity. His
favorite character, when hunting for information,
is that of a talkative Irishwoman, although he
occasionally bursts out as a well-to-do squatter or
swaggering bushman.
J. R. Houlding, “Old Boomerang,” ia
well on with two new novels of adventure, which
he hopes soon to place in the publishers’ hands.
Notwithstanding the current vogue he still
believes in the homely naturalness of incident and
treatment.
At Burribooroona (N.S.W.), where the
local member is the Be-all and End-all, a friend
of his from Sydney, the other day, met in the
(one) street the great man’s father, whom he
accosted, holding out his hand with—“We have
met before. You are Mr. Bullethead.” “No,”
replied the old gentleman, seemingly oblivious to
the pathos of the situation, “ I am only Mr.
Bullethead’s father.”
“The N.S.
Wales Ministry
did nob,” re-
marks a local
paper, “actually
send the Trea-
sury chest to
Rylstone at the
recent local Par-
liamentary elec-
tion, and pay so
many sovereigns
for so many
votes, bub if
wiring to differ-
ent parts of the
electorate that
this, that, and
the other would
be proceeded
with at once is
not unfair, then
of what does un-
fairness consist?
There is nob a
constituency in
the province
which would not
return a sup-
porter of the
present Govern-
ment were the
same expedients
resorted to, for
times are so bad
and money so
scarce that the
local expendi-
ture of public
funds would
always com-
mand votes. If
all future elec-
tions are con-
ducted on the
same disgraceful
system, there
will shortly ar-
rive a time in
which no strictly
honorable man
will be in the
Assembly, for
no honorable
man will have the remotest ouance of being
elected, and, in fact, no honorable man will lower
himself by coining forward as a candidate. Mr.
Wall does not owe his defeat to Freetrade, direct
taxation, or drastic Upper House reform, but
to the powerful and seductive influence of the
“ root of all evil.”
Ex-Chief Justice Yilleneuve Smith, Tas.,
was a most comfortable-looking official on the
bench. Nothing seemed to impair his serenity.
Some years ago he sentenced a 72-year-old burglar
to 14 years in Launceston; whereupon the old
sinner exclaimed, “ Well, I’ll see you out, you
old blank, anyhow !” Yilleneuve smiled sweetly
as the prisoner was removed. He bore no malice.
“ A real good fellow ! I’d do almost any-
thing for him,” exclaimed a member of the Vic.
Cabinet on being asked by a confrere whether he
knew a certain out-of-luck ex-railway employe.
“ Glad of that,” returned the latter, grimly, as he
produced a subscription-list. “ What can I put
you down for, old man ? ” “ Huar-ah ! You can
book me for half-a-crown. Good-bye, I’m in a
hurry.”
The sire of a certain well-represented Tas-
manian family was chiefly noted for his remark-
able digestive powers. He was accustomed to
visit the larder between meals, and to convey
secretly therefrom to his person the contents of
various dishes. One day a laborer rushed up to
the farm-house and frightened the family into fits
with the news that the boss had been thrown from
his horse and had his brains knocked out. The
entire household fled wildly to the scene of the
catastrophe, and found the old man sitting in the
middle of the road with a sickly smile on his face,
and the remains of a black-currant pudding trick-
ling slowly from his hair. He had planted the
delicacy in his hat. Quite a number of members
of other old Tas. families in Parliament are re-
ported to be puddin’-headed.

A former Governor of New South Wales,
with a reputation for meanness, once ventured to
question the price of a pair of boots made by his
shoemaker, a Scotchman, and a well-known
identity of those days. “Well,” responded
Sandy, “ I mak the boots, and I mak the prices,
and if ye dinna like the price ye needna tak the
boots.” At Mark Foy’s neither boots nor price
are ever called into question. The most famous
factories in Europe and America “mak” his
boots, and Mark Foy himself “maks” the price.*

llie most remarkable incident connected
with the great Brassey reception grovel was Pre-
imer turner s appearance in anew sac-suit of light
tweed and a renovated Denton bowler-hat.
Zimmerman and his wife are diamond-
lovers; the champion puts most of his cash prizes
into stones. He and Mrs. Z. glitter so that a
change to Shimmerman would seem a fair thing,
Parkes’s record is probably unparalleled in
the annals of matrimony. His first wife outlived
their golden-wedding day by three years, and now
the awful old man is honeymooning with number
three.
Chief Justice Way (S.A.j, in consequence
of the divulging of the story of the Windeyer
prayer-meeting and weeping-match at Adelaide
Government House, swears that he will never ask
* Wesleyan minister to dinner again. But the
Lieut.-Governor himself, on the railway-platform
when farewelling Pastor Fitchett, talked publicly
of the “dramatic incident ” before the newspaper
got hold of it.
Pianist Ham bo urg’s
most glaring manner-
ism is the contempt to
which he subjects his
audiences. When re-
called, he exhibits all
the symptoms of spleen,
real or affected —which
departure is refreshing
at first, but soon palls.
But the inspired Mark
should at least stick to
his practice of throwing
away the laurel gar-
lands presented b y
musical idolaters. A
laurel wreath is the
worst and most hack-
neyed form of grovel.
Treasurer Ward,
the M.L. Pooh-Bah,
and Gillon, editor of
Wellington Post, are
engaged in deadly duel.
The latter accuses Ward
of using the telegraph
service in order to give
priority to messages
connected with his In-
vercargill business.
Ward retorts by saying
that Gillon has “ had
his knife into him ”
ever since he declined
to appoint the editor’s
daughter to a Govern-
ment billet. Tt is a
very pretty quarrel as
it stands.
The death is an-
nounced in Loudon
from influenza of
Charles Day, once a
proprietor of S. A. Re-
gister, who was just
about to flee back to
Adelaide to escape the
English winter. Once
there were three Days
on the Register.
Charles was called Pay
Day, because he pre-
sided over the cash ;
the editor (now in Syd-
ney), who had been a
parson, was christened Sun Day ; and a reporter,
whose duty it was to do the criminal and other
courts, was known as Judgment Day.
Gov. Brassey’s aide-de-camp caused quite
a flutter in Vic. Cabinet circles, a day before His
Ex. arrived, by solemnly announcing that Mr.
and Mrs. B. would be much annoyed if their name
was pronounced Brass-ay. “ The correct pronun-
ciation is 'Bra- cey ’ —his lordship is really most
particular about it—not Brass-ay on any account,
tf you please.” So the whole Cabinet took to pro-
nouncing “ Bra-cay ” in front of looking-glasses,
and woke their wives up in the night by saying
“ Bra- cey ”in their sleep. The ex-chairman of
the Railway Board—Judge Casey—is childishly
delighted at the discovery that he is the only truly
great man in Melbourne whose name rhymes with
that of His Ex.
When in Wesfcraliau Assembly the Premier
announced the appointment as Governor of Colonel
Gerard Smith, one member asked: “Will they
kni B ht him ?” And another enquired : “ Has he
£ ot “ n y money ?
Newly-appointed Coroner W. Ferguson,
°f a P e Barren Island, on the iasmanian coast,
had for his first official duty the holding of an
inquest on the body of his own wife, drowned in
the wreck of the ketch G.Y.H.
The Yic. Government saved exactly one
penny owing to Hopetoun going and Madden
acting as Governor. The division of the salary
between them, by some curious chance, left the
Treasury one penny to the good,
Phil May will shortly receive a unique
present in the shape of a nugget, found at Cool-
gardie, which bears a laughably close resemblance
cut at the head of “Sappho Smith s ’
weekly letter, designed by Phil.

Ihe gloomy John Dillon, it is cabled, is
engaged to be married to a daughter of Mr.
Justice Matthew, of the Queen’s Bench division.
Jt i s hard to imagine Dillon engaged to be mar-
ried ; it is much easier to imagine him being en-
gaged to be buried,

Edit T ° r Vinluyson, of r „.f' A ' Kvgihtek,
taunts Land-Commissioner Gillen with being a
mere country storekeeper. * “ And yet, says
Gillen, indignantly, “ I have been the Register’s

around dairy butter and salt henings.”
Lord Brassey, at Adelaide, inspected the
squad of Naval Reserve men on the wharf (who
were duly presenting arms), and, turning aside to
Commander Cresswell, said : “ A very fine body
of men ! ” Which historic incident recalls Sir
Joseph Porter, K.C.8., aboard H.M.S. Pinafore,
Gov, Brassey’s allegation that he stands in
the position of British Ambassador at the Cour t
of Victoria is backed up by the evident fact that
Ris wife is an ambassadress. When the Sunbeam
anchored off Queenscliff the vessel was boarded by
“ Lady Brassey’s maid, with private despatches.”
When Gathorne Hardy, who is to private-
secretary Gov. Hampden, arrived in Australia to
hold the pen for Gov. Duff, S.M. Herald an-
nounced that he was the grandson of Lord Cran-
brook. So absorbed was it in realising this fact,
that it forgot to say who the young man’s father
was>

Nathan Rothschild was talking to Ade-
laide’s new Governor, Fowell Buxton, the other
day. Said the banker : “ Sometimes, to amuse
myself, I give a beggar a sovereign. He thinks
it’s a mistake, and, for fear I should find him out,
runs as hard as he can. I advise you to give
a beggar a sovereign sometimes. It is very
amusing. ”
Another N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge is
expected to retire on pension within the next six
months. Assuming the present Government to be
in power then, a favorable opportunity will occur
for trying the effect of a promotion from the
District Court bench. Mr. Want could, but will
not, assert a political claim, and there is no other
first-class barrister-politician at the back of the
Ministry. Hence an opening is made for Judge
Murray, the District Court senior, and the pro-
motion would have public approval.
Sculptor Simonetti left Sydney for Italy
by the German mail-boat to superintend the oast-
ing in bronze of the last figures modelled for the
Governor Phillip statue. This commemoration
in metal of the commonplace naval captain who
was Botany Bay’s first governor and gaoler, is a
legacy from the reign of Parkes, and will cost the
bleeding country something like .£12,000. One of
the “reproductive works” in which J. Bull’s
money has been invested.

Waiter Buller is mentioned among the
probable successors to Westby Perceval in the

Somers Vine, a toady of H. R.H. Pat Buckley
was a struggling lawyer, until he married into
the influential Fitzherbert family, and in his
younger days was a thrifle “fresh,” but for some
years past he has settled down as a staid pater-
familias and a highly-dignified legislator.
Rev. Mother Real, of Monte St. Angelo,
North Sydney, who was successful defendant in
the habeas corpus case decided by N.S.W. Chief
Justice Darley last week—a case in which the
mother and paternal grandmother of an illegiti-
mate child sought to withdraw it from the
custody of the nuns —is a sister of Justice
Pat. Real, of Queensland. The latter’s por-
trait, with all the paraphernalia of office about
him, ornaments the convent parlor, and untutored
visitors occasionally offer up a prayer to the
picture, thinking it represents some canonised
Pope of the Middle Ages.
Naturalist M‘Cooey (whose name appears
to be Scotch-aboriginal) has discovered a new
lizard in the Dubbo district, and dedicated it to
N. Premier Reid, “in recognition of his
democratic principles.” Another explanation is
that the varmint has been dedicated to Mr. Reid
as a tribute to the wrigglesome flexibility of his
backbone. But The Bulletin is puzzled at that
lizard not having been named after Just loe
Minister Gould, who, in his official capacity, is
perhaps the most cold-blooded of a cold-blooded
series of Ministers. Perhaps M’Cooey is waiting
to find a new frog?
Hori Grey writes from London to his
friend Laishley, of Auckland: “ I am getting
more feeble every day as my age increases. The
climate here agrees very well with me. I may say
it is that in which I was brought up as a child.”
Grey’s worst complaint is extreme old age. In the
dog-days his condition was extremely critical, but
with that marvellous elasticity of his he rallied
sufficiently to make a trip to Sandhurst in com-
pany with Lord Stamford, his nephew, and to
visit the Military College where he was educated.
Mr. and Mrs. Seymour George, who passed
through Sydney a few days ago, en route to Eng-
land, will accompany the old man on his return to
Maoriland.
When octogenarian Parkes got married
again, the other day, for the third time, “he
did not kiss his 23-year-old bride, but inclined his
head to receive his first kiss from the third Lady
Parkes. The unexpressed invitation was accepted
by the bride, and she bestowed on her husband a
dutiful but half-timid salute. The marriage cere-
mony occupied nearly half-an hour, and through-
out the old man appeared to be greatly affected,
and at times it was with great apparent difficulty
that he could make the responses. The bride
had her own prayer-book, which she had carried
in hand all the morning, and as the ceremony
went on little pauses were caused as the ex-Premier
turned over the leaves of his book, since it ap-
peared that he had great difficulty in following
the service, so affected did he become. When the
solemn vows were taken Sir Henry remained on
his knees during the remainder of the ceremony
instead of standing, as is customary. The service
apparently had a great effect upon him, and the
veteran, who appeared in such good spirits at
first, appeared to be broken down completely.”
The curse of Dean again. Everybody is breaking
down.
J. B. Thurston, High Commissioner of the
Western Pacific, says the Fiji Times, was once
assistant in a small grocery in Mudgee; subse-
quently owned the store, but failed; went on a
trading cruise in the Pacific; got wrecked, but, as
one of a boat’s crew, reached laud safely, and
settled; became British Consul, then Fiji’s first
Governor, and was eventually appointed to the
post he now holds. . . . Which, says Thurston,
is all a lie. He never was a storekeeper in his life.

Madame Antonio, the startling gymnaste,
a portrait of whom was printed last week, has
been a trapeze-artist for 18 years— i.e., since she
was four years old. Her parents were both
trapezists, and her grandparents on both sides
were trapezists also. So that the law of heredity
is considerably responsible for Madame having
man’s muscles and being stronger, comparatively,
in the arms than in the body or legs. She is a
Roumanian, but was brought up in Paris almost
from infancy. She has exhibited in every large
European and American city, and in India and
China. Her biggest audience numbered 35,000, at
the Tivoli, Copenhagen, in ’B7. She can speak
French, English, German, Spanish and Italian.
She finds the Frenchman the most enthusiastic
spectator, the Englishman the slowest. She lives
most temperately, eschews potatoes, and drinks
only claret, lemonade, tea and water. Her meals
are breakfast, lunch, and supper after the show.
Her morning rehearsal is a half-hour on the
trapeze. In the afternoon, she walks or drives.
Her first accident was 10 years ago ; the trapeze
broke, letting her down 15ft. upon the floor, and
breaking a rib. Twelve months later, in another
such accident, she broke her ankle. Soon after
this she began practising her dive into the net,
and managed 25ft. Now, she will perch like a
bird 140 ft. above the net, take a full breath, coma
sailing headlong down, turning two somersaults
like a tumbler-pigeon, and falling upon her
back into the net. The impact knocks
the breath out of her, and the re-
bound flings her up yards; but she lands
back on her feet, and comes off smiling. Her
great feat causes her neither pain nor stiffness,
but comparative idleness during the long voyage
to Australia made her back tender, so that the
smack of the concussion gave her a tingling at
first. She uses no liniments, but resins her hands
to ensure her hold. She says she loves her work—
“it is everything to me. tip there, I never lose
my head—why, if I did”—and she laughs, “I
might fall upon my feet, break my knees, cause
concussion of the brain—and, if I fell upon my
face or breast, I should hurt myself badly.’’

Mr. Nathan Herman, the proprietor of the
Misfit Parlor in Wynyard-square, Sydney, will he
remembered in that city for many years as the
man who struck a new idea. In every country
where man is sufficiently civilised to have his
clothes and boots made to order, there is neces-
sarily a large accumulation of garments which
have been made to fit the frame of particular pur-
chasers, who didn’t call for them, or couldn’t pay
for them, or died, or absconded, or went
mad,, or got into _gaol before delivery, and
so left them on the maker’s hands. And
in every case, there is someone else about
whom the rejected article would fit, for
everybody’s clothes—except those of Dick Dead-
eye and the Hunchback of Notre Dame—fib
somebody else, and this person would be glad to
■ get a first-class garment at a reduced price, and
the builder of it would be pleased to get rid of it
at almost any sacrifice. The difficulty always has
been to bring the misfit and the man it will fib
together, and Mr. Herman solved the problem by
accumulating in one place misfits from all
the ends of the earth, so that everybody who
can possibly be fitted by human ingenuity
may go there and be satisfied. He is
also a universal provider—a dealer in safes,
crockery, furniture, bedding, carpets, linoleums,
oil cloths, drapery, jewellery, watches, cigars,
tobacco, tea (401 b chest for 30s. or 121 b. tin for
10s.), cutlery, fancy goods, ironmongery, &0., &c.
But the misifit idea was his own special inspira-
tion, and he is proud. of it. Even the famous
£2 bale, which contains a suit of clothes, two
shirts, two undershirts, six pairs socks, two ties,
two collars, six handkerchiefs, set studs, hat, pair
braces and pair of boots, all sent to the railway
station or wharf nearest to the-buyers’ residence
for 405., doesn't appeal to his soul like that great
original idea. Mr. Herman ha,s lately broken out
into pianos, firearms, ammunition, and other new
departments,' and makes gentlemen s suits for
.£1 9s. 6d., and supplies dress-suits at one-fourth
ttie usual price. Also, he has broken out into so
many other lines of business of late that no one
knows tor certain what he lias gpt, and the things
that lie hasn’t got could mostly be enumerated on
the back of one postage stamp, and even then the
stamp wouldn’t be unduly crowded.

Hospital Sunday at Bendigo was a wasted
opportunity for the marvellously-tailored Dan
Lazarus, M.L.A., to aid the cause of local charity.
Dan stood around the gates of the park whilst the
band was playing, and took up a collection in a
tin-box. He was gorgeously arrayed—tight-fitting
gloves, slim umbrella, everything new and glossy.
But scores of constituents, who would have been
glad to drop a modest contribution in a less-
appalling person’s box, shrank from the thought
of insulting this modern Lazarus with a bit of
silver, therefore his services represented a loss to
the fund. Next Hospital Sunday, if the authori-
ties are wise, they will enclose their senator in
a capacious tent and charge the masses sixpence
to go in and gaze upon his wearing-apparel.
Dr. Dowling raised a nice point at Rich-
mond (Melb.) Police Court, the other day, when
he declined to certify to the lunacy of a woman On
the grounds that her aberration was due to A
physical complaint curable at an ordinary hospital;
Magistrate Keogh waxed indignant and sent for
another physician, explaining that the so-
called lunatic-asylums are actually hospitals for
the insane. Nevertheless popular stupidity
attaches a stigma to inmates of them only second
to that attachable to occupants of gaols. Any-
how, Dr. Dowling’s delicacy was nothing to rave
about.

arranged to hang out from his window a calico
sign representing a woman hanging from a gibbet,
and with the inscription “The Executive
Chokes a Pregnant Woman Next Monday
Week ! ” But some ladies who have a finger in
the editor’s literary pie got wind of the proposal,
and promptly squelched it, on the grounds that it
would discredit the organ at Guv’rnent ’Ouse. 8°
the banner was finally handed over to Messrs.
Fleming, White and Co. for Sunday use on Yarra
Bank. A great opportunity lost.

Herald on Oct. 24 :
London, Oct. 22.— 1 n the French Chamber cf Deputies
to-day M. Henri Briason eulogised the heroism of the
French troops in Madagascar. In answer to interpella-
tions, it was announced that cablegrams had been
received stating that a disastrous explosion had taken
place on board the transport King, by which 17 of those
on board, mostly officers, were killed on the spot. The
others, it was added, rushed the boats, with the result
that 500 men were drowned. Two hundred others clung
to the wreck for 17 hours before they were rescued.
Sydney Daily Telegraph version of the same
cable: —
Explosion on a Chinese transport. The soldiers rush
the boats. Five hundred drowned. Two hundred res-
cued after 17 hours. London, Tuesday night.—Details
have been received with respect to the terrible explosion
which took place on board a Chinese transport at Kin-
chow, a seaport at the head of the Gulf of Liao-tong.
Most of the officers on board the ship were killed by the
explosion, which completely wrecked the vessel. The
soldiers rushed the boats, with the result that 500 were
drowned. 200 others clung to the wreck for 17 hours
before they were rescued.

Messrs. Win. Howard Smith and Sons,
Ltd., issue a “Handbook of Information” for
travellers on the Australian coast, which contains
spirited descriptions of the ports visited by their
steamers, many very well-executed illustrations,
and a variety of useful general matter. Die book
does credit to its editor and to the well-known
firm which issues it.
The proprietors of that well-known
remedy, ' end’s Extract, issue a pamphlet con-
taining reprints of a number of testimonials from
medical men, all of whom speak of it in very
high terms. The .extract is a preparation of
Hamawetis, which is a valuable curative agent for
ulcers, nasal catarrh, varicose veins, hemorrhage,
dysentery, and many other diseases. It is also a
powerful antiseptic, and applied externally to
injuries or inflamed parts it is of great assistance
for the relief of pain. Pond’s Extract is one of
the best preparations of this drug in the market,
and has stood the test of many years’ service.

Nimble Cupid capers madly
Round the bridegroom and the bride;
Hymen greets them, smiling gladly
On love’s passion sanctified.
Let the clang of joy-bells weighty
.Echo far o’er land sea—
Lo ! the grand old man of eighty
Weds a girl of twenty-three!
He the oak and she the ivy
Clinging to his manly form,
Not dead yet, but all alivey—
Full of youthful vigor warm.
Here’s a toast; come, fill your rummers !
May they long united be—
Parkes, the swain of eighty summers,
And his wife of twenty-three.

“ The courting devil is supremo,” wails a
Melbourne cleric. He means that Mr. Y.M.C. A.
and Miss Y. VV.O. A. pair off, and no more is
heard of missioning.
The demand for “ Crom-a-boo ” has neces-
sitated a fourth edition, which is now in the press.*
Dear Bulletin, —This is not Southland
(M.L.) Acclimatisation Society’s first move
towards acclimatising the opossum. Six or seven
years ago ’possums were placed at Orepuke and
Colao Bay, and those localities are literally alive
with them. The cold climate, too, has improved
their skin—the fur is much thicker and better
than that of the Australian animal. — ScuiP.
The success of the Winfcon (Q.) bore is a
remarkable example of perseverance rewarded.
The contract was first taken in ’B9. The contract
depth of 2500 ft. was attained in ’93. As no
aitesian water was struck, the Govt, authorised
another 1000 ft. In Oct., ’94, a depth of 3810 ft.
was attained, and 100,000 gals. day. The Govt,
authorised anotlnr 500 ft., and at a depth of
3555 ft. a fresh supply was struck. On June 22 of
this year the steam-whistle of the engine roused
the Wintonites, who turned out and found them-
selves the proud possessors of the deepest bore in
Queensland (4010 ft.), and million gals, of water
per diem. Six years’ hard work was thus de-
s rvedly rewarded. The contractor remarks, by
the way, that he always knows when he is
approaching artesian water by the strong mineral
smell issuing from the bore.
When the British Board of Trade author-
ised Mr. Stewart, the Senior Official Receiver, to
hold an enquiry into the affairs of the N.Z.
L. and M. Agency, it was heard before Mr.
Justice Vaughan Williams, reputedly a very able
Judge, whose forte lies in disentangling intricate
commercial transactions. The evidence of the
directors, officers, and valuers turned mainly on
the value of certain properties. There had
been two separate valuations—one made dur-
ing prolonged drought, when the runs looked
like well-trodden stubble, and the gaunt cattle
were propping themselves up against the trees;
the second, dated a few months later, after rain
and warm sunshine, when the grass had freshened
up and the stock greatly improved. Of course,
the second valuation was much higher than the
first. It was this that excited the lofty ridicule
of the Judge. With raised eyebrows and a sar-
donic smile, he asked the witness, Mr. “Tom”
Russell, whether he thought English people were
so easily gulled as to be induced to believe that a
few showers of rain could make a difference of
several thousands of pounds in the value of a run.
The bar and the public grinned in sympathy with
the sapient Judge. None of them had the slight-
est conception of the effects of a drought. Their
notions of an Australian run were drawn from an
English meadow, or Regent’s Park.

Vic. Supreme Court decides that the
transference of railway-tickets bought in another
province is not illegal. For instance, a ticket
from Adelaide to Melbourne and return may be
sold in Melbourne, and the Vie. Commissioners
have no power to interfere, the law applying only
to tickets sold within the province. The wonder
is that anybody; from anywhere with a return-
ticket in Melbourne these times should want to
dispose of it.

A Dream of Dry Bones .
[FOR THE BULETTIN.]
When I read that some surveyors had found a
skeleton on the edge of the desert in the Never
Never, I felt guilty, because scratched on the
billy-lid beside the whitened bones was the name
of my old schoolmate. He had died of thirst in
the desert. Most likely he had wandered away
from some shanty “in the horrors.” Anyhow
they found his bones when the dingoes had gnawed
them and the ants had eaten away all signs of
flesh. Perhaps the ravenous kites had picked out
his eyes before the flesh was cold. Close by was
an old, rusty billy, and near it the skeleton of a
dog. Nothing remained to tell who the man had
been except the name on the billy. Evidently his
had been a terrible end, and my guiltiness was
because I could have saved him from such a death.
Once, years ago, he and I slept in the skilhon
room of my father’s old bark-roofed house. At
midnight the moon shone through the holes in the
roof. The moonbeams played on the old wooden
posts of our bedstead and on the ’possum-rug that
was our only blanket. They showed me the white
face and dark, curly hair of the boy about my
own age—who slept beside me. How I envied
him ! My hair was red, and my freckled face was
sunburnt and blistered, audit smarted so that for
hours I lay awake, counting the sides of bacon
and hams, and bags of pumpkin-seed and dried
peaches that hung from the rafters above my
head. The mosquitoes buzzed and the dingoes
howled on the moonlit hill behind the house, and
the morepork hooted and crooned on the edge of
the forest. By and by a ’possum came frisking
along the roof. I watched his antics for a while
drowsily, and then dropped off to sleep.
In my dream I saw a wide, barren stretch of
sand fringed with stunted bush, and bordered with
ragged belts of scrub. Here and there grew mis-
shapen trees, bent and gnarled ; then mile on mile
nothing but scrub and sand, where the whitened
bones of men and animals that had perished were
strewn along the grassless plains, and a dead
silence was over all. Overhead a cloudless sky
gleamed and dazzled down to the horizon s
edge, and the sun seemed on fire, and the
sands of the desert burned. In the shade
of a clump of trees the kites gathered round
a man with weary, swollen feet. His bps
were parched and blackened, and he had glaring
eyes. His dog, sore-footed too, lay at his feet.
The inan rose when the kites came near
cursed them and pelted them, and they flew off
clamoring and quavering, but they came back and
taunted him, and he cursed at them till his lips
cracked and bled. Then he moaned and muttered
to himself, and called to his dog, and staggered
away from the demons sent to haunt him.
All day he walked, and there was no track, and
his throat was parched, and a great thirst tortured
him, and all the pitiless day he was haunted by
the memories of his life. His feet bled, and the
merciless, mighty sun poured down upon him ;
but he was mad, and saw green fields and cool
rivers and shining lakes that fled away and
mocked him ; and only the fierce, bright sun and
the burning sand of the desert remained. All day
long his head was filled with memories of the old
farm and the canefields. The shearing-sheds and
the shanties—the gay city life and the gambling
hells. The dance-room and the old school-house,
and the cool solitude of the prison cell. All the
jumbled memories of his past life seethed in his
maddened brain as he staggered on—outward to
the desert; and overhead, as lie walked, the kites
circled, and the hot winds blew, and the glaring
sun blazed redder and set; and the sands grew
cool, and again he lay beneath a tree, but the dog
sat out on the edge of the shade and whined, for
the man’s eyes were bloodshot and he foamed at
the mouth. The sun went down, and the kites
gathered near and whistled and chattered among
themselves, for it was in the drought, and they
were fat. The red moon rose a perfect ball of
fire. Then the dingoes came, and the dog chased
them away, and they howled and waited for the
man to die—and he raved and dug in the sand,
and when the grim, grey, dewless dawn came he
was dead. Then the dog licked his face and
crawled to his feet and died too. Then came the
kites and the crows, and they fought and had a
great feast, and the hot winds blew again, and the
sun shone, and the sky gleamed, and the sands of
the desert burned.
I awoke. The ’possum still frisked on the roof,
and the boy still slept. The moonbeams shone on
the old gun hanging on the wall. I shivered at
the horror of my dream. Better that the boy
should die in his sleep than live for years and
perish in the desert. I thought to reach for the
gun to kill him. I who had envied him would
kill him—in mercy and in pity I would kill him.
But the moonbeams faded and the moon set, and
the cold, grey dawn came over the hill. The boy
woke and stretched himself and yawned, and
called me “ Ginger,” and told me to get up. The
calves in their pens close by bellowed, and the
cows answered them from the paddocks. It was
milking-time, and the world began to be astir.
But to-day when I read the name which in wild
delirium he had scratched on the billy-lid, I felt
guilty, because I knew that I could have saved
him from the death he died.

KST” Please to observe that Mr. Steel is the ONLY AC-
CREDITED PUBLIC INVESTOR in Melbourne, so
BEWARE of IMPOSTERS (who advertise at THIS
season of the year ONLY, with a view to “catching” a
few of the UNWARY—not having the MEANS at any
other season of the YEAHI with their SCURRILOUS
STATEMENTS and MISREPRESENTATIONS. Mr. Steel

Only Member of Tattersall’s
who gives racing advice, which ANYONE can satisfy
themselves about on application to the Secretary of (he

In this connection see LAST week's Sportsman where-
in the SECRETARY OF TATTERSALL’S emphatically

of sufficient means to advertise himself as a Turf Com-
mission Agent, Turf Adviser, etc., for a WEEK OR TWO

NOT A MEMBER OF TATTERSALL’S,

The generation has almost passed away
that used to daily interrogate each other in the
words, “ Who struck Buckley?” The person in
question was “Wild Buckley,” well-known in the
early days of Victoria, and his bad luck was so
phenomenal that the phrase “Buckley’s chance”
came to signify about the worst kind of fortune
that could befall a man. Buckley it was who,
when rescued from the blacks, could only recollect
the one English word, “ bread.” Very so. n after
going into exile among the natives, his moleskin
pants succumbed, and he had to take to kangaroo-
skins. But, in these days, bushmen have a far
better chance than Buckley, as Mark Foy’s great
stores of clothing are within a few days’ reach of
the remotest of them.*

Analysis of Suicide.
Who among us does not feel pity, if not horror
and contempt, for those who have so lost all re-
gard for law, human and divine, as to premedita-
tingly take measures for self-destruction?
Want of self-reliance; lack of self-mastery ; an-
tipathy to existence, and a longing to escape life’s
responsibilities are the frequent excuses offered by
those who in “ fits of temporary insanity ” rudely
out the thread of life.
While there may be some excuse for these, there
is none for so-called criminal carelessness; for
those who cultivate a disregard for kindly advice,
and under-estimate admonition. When lifeseems
a burden, when the nights are long and sleepless,
when the continual strain threatens life, many
recklessly turn a deaf ear and cold shoulder to a
friend’s proffered advice. Why should prejudice
and arrogance so often prevent one following the
dictates of conscience? “Fortunately,” says Mr.
Hugh Barnett, retired Government Officer, Roraai
Queensland, “I accepted the advice of a friend
and took Warner’s Safe Cure. For a long time I
endured terrible suffer ing from liver disease. The
pains under the shoulder-blades, down the back,
and in my chest and sides were so severe that I
could get no rest day or night. My appetite
failed, and I became so weak and worn out that I
was obliged to give up work of all kinds. After
spending much time and money in other direc-
tions, I commenced taking Warner’s Safe Cure,
and after using several bottles I am thankful tb
say that I have quite recovered my good health,
and consequently have no hesitation in advising
those suffering from liver disease to try this medi-
cine, in preference to all other remedies that may
be offered to them.”
SPORTING NOTIONS.
This year’s Melbourne Cup is quite likely to be
a favorites’ race as in 1889, when Ihe winner started at
eights, the second horse at sevens, and the third at fours
to one. lint there are no wai m favorites thus far. After
the Melbourne Slakes and Derby have been decided
punters will “know something," for each of the races
aforesaid must inevitably reveal one or more “ good
things,” uni ss the condilion of Fleminglon course on
Saturday is abnormal. A muddy gallop is about the
worst of all guides to fair-weather "foim." The three-
year-olds, this year, appear exceptionally good in com-
parison with their elders, and an unusual amount of Cup
interest will attach to the Derby struggle if no particular
breakdowns occur meanwhile. This is such a dry season
that the rush of “breakdowns” may beat the Dean-case
record, nevertheless one is bound to leave accid- nts out
of the question in discussing Cup chances. Given a
vision of the Derby and a photo, of the Stakes
finish, the writer could almost be persuaded to back
his own tip for the Cup. Anraria will seem a sound
selection for Tuesday’s handicap if she should heat Water-
fall, Wallace, Rewi, and Usculator in the Derby. The
writer fancies Aurar'a for the classic event in preference
to the colts, all of which have pretensions to win the Cup.
Fifteen of the last 25 Cup winners have been
“ seasoned ” animals—four years old, nr upwards—carry-
ing middle weights, from 7st. 31b. to Bst. 71b. Therefore
a prophet must show some reasonable excuse for expect-
ing either a top-weight, or a young horse, to win t his hard-
run race. On the face of precedent one couldn’t do
better than put the names of all the 7st. 31b. to Bst. 71b.
horses in a bat, pick one of them at random, and
back it. As regards top-weights down to 8s:. 81b.—
the probable starters are Brockleigh, The Admiral, Hop-
scotch, Devon, Delaware, Quiver, lioia, Elswick and
Trenchant. We have bad evidence, at one time or other,
tiiat Brockleigh, Hopscotch and Hova cannot live light
through a fast two-mile race, Devon and Quiver, it is
clear, can stay well enough, and the writer assumes that
they are likely lo beat, Delaware, The Admiral and Tren-
chant, yei neither Devon nor Quiver is a very attractive
chance with Bst. 121 h. or Bst. 13lh. to carry.
Very few of the old ones, classed as rniddle-
w'eights, have ever done anything to make them appear
dangerous candidates. This is a poor reason
for despising their chances, seeing that Tarcoola
and Glenlot h were open lo the same objection
before their victories came off. The writer will take I
Preston, The Trier, Chesteiman, and Taranaki to he pos- '
sihle winners, but less likely than Dreamland, Music, or
Monastery. Two of these three are specially difficult;
ohaiicts to gauge. Dreamland promised to he a brilliant
horse until he fell ill, fifteen months ago, and now
nobody knows how much, or little, that illness has dis-
comfited Dreamland’s fulure prospects. He ran pretty
well in tiie Caulfield Slakes, and lias a very fine outline !
anyhow. Music, the “dark” Tasmanian champion, may
lie a real good one. Monastery, from S.A., lias a fair
ciiai oe for the Cup on some of her running, and no chance
at all on other running. One would pick this st>lish
mare from a crowd as a likely winner, and the writer
reckons Monastery capable of worrying Devon and Quiver j
with a 141 h. advantage in the handicap. Of the matured
lightweights only Lord Richmond seems worth consider-
ing, though Palo Alto may find backers. Lord Richmond
is a fine, improving horse tiiat ought to make a hold show
forthe Cup, and owner Jellett fancies him immensely.
But Jellelt’s opinions about his own cattle are seldom
justified.
The writer, then, can’t see much to choose
between Monastery, Quiver, Devon, Dreamland, and Loid
Richmond, nor any reason why a first-class three-year-old
shouldn’t heat the lot. None of the crack “classic ” per-
formers of 1894, or 1893, are left in this year’s Cup crowd.
Tiie surviving veterans don’t look templing invist-
menls for the great two-mile event, hence Delaware’s
position as a nominal first favorite these last few
weeks. A little money would have brought any-
thing else to the fore. They seem to be at the
mercy of any brilliant youngsters, which brings us hack
to the question whether this season’s three-vear-olds are
above tiie average. Probably. Waterfall won the Caul-
field Cup in excellent lime and style. Te VVliiti ran pro-
minent ly in the same race after being badly beaten for
the Guineas by Wallace. Rewi, again, is said to pull over
Te Whiti on the training-track, and has been backed for
the Cup on his private form and good looks. Osoulator
a half-brother to The Bulletin's old friend, Tranter, is
an imposing thoroughbred, almost certain to make a
name for himself if he remains sound. As for Anraria
she comes from S. Australia with tiie reputation of being
a “ smasher,” and appearances favor the impression tiiat
the Ally's friends are not overrating her. Asa two-year-old
Auraria (in receipt of 2st.) beat The Possible over 8, 9 and
10 furlongs, at a time when Mr. Gollan’s mare wasshowing
good form. The handioapper gave The Possible Bst. 31h.
for the Cup, and Auraria, as a three-year-old, will have to
carry no more than weight-for age if she wins the Derhv.
After her defeat for the Maiibyrnong Plate the South
Australian flyer ran six times as a two-year-old—winning
four races outright, making a dead-beat for first place in
another, and finishing second on the other occasion. This
season, Auraria was asked to win the S.A. Derby, when
not nearly fit, and she cantered away with the race. A
consistently fiist-class performer, and a beautiful filly
Auraria will be worth hacking for the Derby in prtfer-
ence to Wallace, or even Waterfall (who probably s
better than tiie Victorian pet). At time of writing she
is not doing much on the Flemington track, and the
books offer 5 to 1 on tiie principle that a filly is likely to
“go off” at any minute in the early summer. All the
same Auraria is The Bulletin's tip fo'r the Derby, and its
tip for the Cup is the Derby winner. Also Tub
Bulletin ventures to predict that the three first horses in
tiie Cup race will come from a lot of seven—viz., tiie six
placed for either Melbourne Stakes or Derby, with Music
thrown in as a likely outsider.
The Officer, though penalised 101 b.. has a really
good show to win the Maiibyrnong Plate, and perhaps
The Heroine will pick up a minor handicap during the
V.R.C. meeting.

exception of one, a lad at col.ege.
Likewise Wallace has fallen into good hands,
and the public will have a fair run for their cash in Derby
and Cup, without inteiference from Ikey Mo and Co. A
syndicate of four, Messrs. 0. E. House (publican), J.
English and J. H. and E. Brown (mining men), now own
Carbine’s son, and intend racing him “on their own.” A
3UOO guinea ofl>r wasn’t sufficiently tempting in view of
the EJeminglon meet.
Trenton, worth at least £lO,OOO, goes to Mr.
Arundel, a Berrigau (N.S.W.) publican, who, standing

clerk to Matthew Davies, and well-known in Melbourne
legal circles. It is on tire cards that Mr. Wilson will
make an offer for Trenton himself.

Zimmerman, allegedly suffering from sandy-
bligl.t, diarrhoea, insomnia, and other things, was enabled
by his indomitable pluck to down Parsons in the Half-
Mile at Adelaide, and run second to Parsons in the Five
Miles with only a length and a half b( tween them. Zim.’s
half-mile was done in Imin, 6 1-5-ec.— a new record for
Austraia; still, considering that Zim. and Paisons have
each cone a quarter in 27isec., this time is nothing to
bellow about, especially as Hie first lap was paced. Zim.
scratched himself for the handicap races (he will ride in
no handicap races in Australia), whereat the insatiable
herd butted their bullock heads against the palings and
hissed and groaned.
In the Five Miles, Parsons hung on to the
tandem and made the pace a scorcher—still Zim. kept
there. Zim.’s condition didn’t permit of his picking his
machine up as of yore and shooting along the last
hundred yards with the whiz of a bullet. Probably
Parsons will ride with Zim. right through the Australian
tour.
♦ * * *
A London paper says that bicyclist Zimmer-
man’s great success is due to hisahnormally large heart,
whicli is declared by doctors to he much bigger than
the average. Strange that no mention is made of another
not unimportant feature in Zim’s success,— viz., his large
and fan-like ears. When Zim was racing in Adelaide, the
writer was particularly struck with this peculiarity, and
calculates that the American is at least 2secs. to the mile
quicker, owing solely to the ingenious way he assists
his machine liy woiking his ears windmill-fashion.

Zimmerman tells Melb. Argus that the entry
of his name in the Austral Wheel Race was not authoiised,
and that he will not, owing to other engagements, be able
to compete. Truth is that Zim yearned to ride, hut nob
for the pure love of sport. Hard cash is his basis. He
wanted 1100 paid down to ride in the Austral, besides
the prospect of winning the big prize. Melb. B.C. very
rightly didn’t see the force of pay ing any competitor to
ride in a lace which is a pure sport affair. So Zim has
“ other engagements.”

SKIN DISEASE
CUBED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Geo. W. Burtner, Keezletowu, Va.,
■writes, as follows:
“ Shortly after leaving college, 1 was troubled
with a skin disease which showed itself, first, at
the ankles. Thysicians pronounced It eczema,
and treated me for that complaint. The erup-
tion crept slowly up my limbs, and on the body,
until it enveloped the whole frame. It gave me
infinite trouble with constant Itching, casting off
of dry scales, and a watery liquid which would
fl
exude from tinder the scales. I treated it for
over three years unsuccessfully, and was unable
to check it, until I began using Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. I used three bottles of this medicine and
was completely cured—my skin becoming as
smooth and clear as before/’

“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
•Bengor's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never Vie able to
rear her. We took her totho

ties recommended ‘ Bcnger's

began to pick up flesh and
strength.”

The other day, at Sandridge (Vie.), a
sailor prosecuted the mate of his vessel for assault,
and exit ibited damages caused by blows from an iron
bar. The Bench (which included Fat Men interested
in shipping) said that there was no doubt of the
mate s guilt, but the presiding Solon pointed out
that the A. 8., in refusing to perform the task set
him, was guilty of as serious an offence, and the
case was dismissed. Which shows that, in the
opinion of the paunchy J.P., the lash has simply
given place to the crowbar as a means of implant-
ing humility and discipline in the breast of the
| common sailor. Another reason—the ten-thou-
sandth—why the Vie. honorary bench should be
sponged off the slate.
At Wellington (M.L.), where the China-
men have such a hold, an Irishman poured forth
a lament to the P.M. : “ ’Tisn’t because I can’t

paying up to a Cliej uamiu. For years I paid up
to a whoite-mahu, and now I’Ve got to pay a Chey-
namin. A cratur that came wid nothing at all

Dear Bulletin, —You take a one-eyed
view of the stamp-collector’s grievance. “F.M.G.
Cook is reprinting old postage-scamps for the
good of the N.S.W. revenue, and apparently
intends to continue at the work. Consequently
the British person named Evans will have to
simmer down. N.S.W. can go on issuing its own
stamps as long as it pleases.” There’s no doubt
that N.S.W. can issue its own stamps, and the
British person will have to simmer down ; never-
theless P.xVl. G. Cook is debasing the philatelic
currency, as Evans complains, and enriching the
revenue by illegitimate means. A value for out-
of-issue postage-stamps was created wholly and
solely by collectors, who have paid handsome
prices for “rare specimens,” and such speci-
mens became rare for the reason that they
had been officially made obsolete by the
various postal departments. Mr. Cook to-day
is trading in what are (so far as collections
go) practically forgeries of old-time stamps, the
rarity of which is owing to the former action of
his department in changing the issue. He
doesn’t reprint them as postage-stamps, but as
copies of stamps which have derived a fancy
value from the fact that they ceased long ago to pass
through the post. Furthermore, the department
is charged with misrepresenting the age of these
repiint stamps by means of old postmarks. Any
number of petty state postal departments have
condescended to issue reprints to dealers at a
paltry profit, or perhaps the men who
had the old plates under their control
struck off copies for their own small
private beneht. But a plain reprint of a stamp is
quite a different matter to a reprint that professes
to have been defaced by the Government as a
stamp going through the post 50 years ago, inas-
much as a postmark is an official guarantee of age
for a stamp. In Germany, the other day, a man
got a stiff sentence of imprisonment for putting
false postmarks on reprint stamps, though his
swindle, of course, injured nobody except the
philatelists, whosaem to be recognised as property-
owners in that well-educated country. Mr. Cook’s
way of doing good for the N.S.W. revenue is un-
doubtedly crooked.— Sydney Yuse.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to paruse Herr Rassmusseu’s advt. on page
23 of this issue.
Even the aboriginal waxes a-weary of the
Boodlewraith. Mr. A. Petrie, a well-known
Bananalander, the other day met a blackfellow,
an ex-tracker, who spoke excellent English. The
nig. had a grievance—he had received no blanket
at the annual distribution. A long tirade on the
matter concluded with : “ Well, if I don’t get a
blanket next time Government ’ll hear about it.
I’ll join the Labor-party ! ”

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herb Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies,
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was.’ Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper o)
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheej -
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfalim-
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish. Fulfilled
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and
doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’ standing. My

Dear Sir, I shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I
come across. You are quite at liberty to publish or make what use you
like of this testimonial, and anyone writing to me will have full
particulars. I am, yours respectfully, Mrs. E. SMITH, Port Mac-

THE FIFTH REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
—OF —
THE COLONIAL BANK OF AUSTRALASIA LIMITED,
To be presented to the Shareholders at the Fifth Ordinary General Meeting to be held at the Bank,
126 Elizabeth Street, at noon on
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1895.
R, IB IP O R T.
The Directors beg to submit to the Shareholders their Fifth Report, with a Balance-sheet and
Statement of Profit and Loss for the half-year ended the 30th September, duly audited.
After providing for expenses of management, interest accrued on deposits, rebate on bills current,
and tax on note circulation, the net profit, including the balance brought forward from previous half-
year amounted to JHO23 Os. 10d., which the directors recommend be carried forward to next half-year.
Since the last half-yearly meeting the Bank has arranged with the holders of its deferred fixed
deposit receipts for — . . ,
Ist. A substantial reduction in the rate of interest.
2nd. An ample extension of time for the repayment of its deferred deposits.
3rd. A provision for making all new business since 10th July, 1893, whether current account
or new fixed deposit receipts, preferential to the deferred deposit receipts.
The bank has had the benefit of the reduced rate of interest for only a portion of the half-year
under review, and the balance to be carried forward would have been larger but for the expensesuf the
amended scheme of compromise, the whole of which have been charged to the profits for the half-year.
The amendment of the Companies Act, referred to in the last report, authorising the reduction ot
capital by writing off losses, has not yet been passed, bub will probably be in force next year.
The fifth ordinary general meeting of shareholders will be held at the head office of the company
126 Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, on TUESDAY, the 29th day of OCTOBER, 1895, at noon.
By order of the Board.

Hanging in lawyer Crick’s office in Philhp-
street, Sydney, is the free pardon issued to Biittner
on the very morning he was to have been hanged
on a charge of criminally assaulting the woman
Lennox, whose real character Crick discovered at
the last moment. It is the only free pardon ever
issued in Australasia i to a prisoner lying under
capital sentence, and it was all that Biittner was
able to give his advocate.
There was once a hairdresser at Geelong
He had four sons. One of these is now Australian
editor of the Review of Reviews ; the second is
Dean of Ohristohurch (M.L.); and a third is in
the M.L. Legislature. They all agree that the
fourth brother, who died, was the cleverest of the
quartette. Matthew Davies and his brothers also
hail from Geelong.

The Freaks
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
True, he ain’t no account as a nag,
ah’ I’m not goin’ to boast of his blood {
If I liked I could pitch you a mag
’Bout his sire, once a prince of the stud ;
Give performances colored and plain,
An’ a pedigree long es me arm—
Which is style, but I’m straight in the main,
So he ain’t of the Wangdoodle strain,
Nor his dam wasn’t Kate or The Charm.
Kiddle-headed an’ spavined ! Well, p’raps.,
Yes ? his legs is all over the shop,
An’ his pacin’s described by the chaps
Es a sort of a wallaby hop.
He ain’t good over sticks, an’ a mile
In four-thirty’s his best up to date;
An’ he’s jest pure Gehenna for guile,
But I wouldn’t sell out for a pile,
Cos I’m not goin’ to dog on a mate.
See, I’m here, an’ he’s yonder, of course,
But I might a-been crow-bait by now—
Once my life seemed to hang on that horse,
An’ I didn’t get left. That is how !
They’ve bin tellin’ you—-Billy an’ Spence?
Ah, they’re mighty smart men down the creek,
An’ they won’t allow horses has sense,
But jest guy it es chance or pretence
When I tell what was done by The Freak.
But I’m here, an’ he’s there—that’s enough 1
We were out ’mong the Misery Hills.
’Course you don’t know the country. It’s rough ;
An’ the man that it corners it kills.
I can’t figure what happened us quite,
But we came in a heap, me an’ him.
When I knew who I was it was night,
An’ my head an’ my chest wasn’t right.
An’ the bone poked right outer this limb.
Fer a spell I felt horribly sick
While I held there a meetin’ of me,
Proposed—“ It is U P with Dick.”
Put, an’ carried unanermously.
Broken-legged, fifteen mile from the Creek —
I weighed chances, an’ gave up the case,
But I didn’t deal fair by The Freak,
Till he limped to me, staggered an’ weak,
An’ he flopped his ole lip in my face.
Do ? I fondled his nose like a fool,
An’ I called him love names without end ;
Though I ain’t a soft man as a rule,
There is times when I sorter unbend.
’Tain’t no use now to talk of the pain
I endoored es I struggled to climb
To his back frum a log, or explain
How I fell back again an’ again ;
But I gave up exhausted in time,
An’ I flung meself down on the ground,
An’ I cursed an’, yes, maybe I cried,
But The Freak he came nosin’ around,
An’ he rolled over right by my side.
Don’t you try to explain, I’m content
That he knew just es well es could be,
’Cos i looked in his eye es he bent,
By the Lord, an’ I saiv what he meant,
An’ that’s good enough talkin’ fer me.
Well, I crawled on his back es he lay,
An’ he heaved himself up again, so,
An’ then struck out fer home, an’ till day
I hung on him, but how I don’t know.
Not a thing do I mind after that
’Fore I came round all right at the whim,
Spread out on the bunk of Big Mat,
With a doc. on the job from The Flat,
An’ my leg fairly timbered and trim.
Yes, I’ve heard all the mag of the men—
That he wanted to roll or to die,
An’ it’s true that he’s kicked me since then,
An’ he’s likewise uncommonly sly ;
But I’m here. If they talk fer a week
That one fact isn’t goin’ to change,
An’ I owe it this day to The Freak
That a crow isn’t clippin’ his beak
On my rib-bones out back by the range.

After Shearing
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thev met out back, in one of those long, strag-
gling bush pubs, with its beer-stained and mos-
quito-oovered wooden partitions. Shearing was
over, the sheds out out; their work was just start-
ing. Jack hadn’t shorn at any of the sheds—he
never did; his shed was a pub, his shears clubs,
hearts, &0., and he was a good workman in his
own line. So was “Ginger.” I never heard his
other name ; they said he came from Queensland.
Jack was seated on a cask in the bar, shears in
pocket, waiting for a sheep —or, as he termed it, a
“dook.” Ginger swaggered in, he looked every
inch a “ dook ” —it paid him.
“ Two drinks, missis—’course you’ll join.”
“ Been shearin’? ”
“ Rather.”
“Melbourne, I suppose?”
“ Well, I’m d d.”
“ So’m I; we’ll start in mornin’.”
“ Same again, missus. By Gawd, it’s ’ot.”
Ginger proposed poker. They started. Each
feigned sleepiness, each ivas sleepy; more liquor,
higher stakes. It really was hot; each actually
fell asleep. . . . Ginger awoke, took in the posi-
tion of affairs and the stakes at the same time,
and had “faked ’’Jack’s hand when the latter
awoke.
“Hello, mate, where’s the boodle? ”
“ Oh, that’s all right. I had the best of the
deal that time, boss —look at yer ’and.”
Jack looked —and recognised a kindred spirit.
“ Yes, indeed yer did. Yer woke fust /”

ONLY FOUR TO MAN THE PUMPS.
Dear, dear! When you come to think of it how
closely related things are ; how one thing brings
up another. Ideas are like a lot of beads on a
string, aren’t they ?
A letter I have just been reading makes me re-
member what happened to me one winter about
twenty years ago. The story is too long to tell
here, so 111 merely give you the tail-end of it. I
was supercargo on a bark bound from London to
Rio. A tremendous gale, lasting five days,
wrecked us. Forty-eight hours after it ceased
there were four men and no more-left on the
vessel. The captain had been killed by a falling
spar, three of the crew washed overboard, and the
rest of the thip s company (save us four) went
away in the long-boat with the first and second
mates. We were taking in water through a leak
at the rate of six in hes an hour. Working with
all our might the four of us could pump that out
in forty minutes, but we must do it every hour.
It was awful wo k. For two days we kept it up,
without sleep Then we stopped, took to the
quarter boat and shoved off. The sea was quiet
—no wind. While we lay to within a mile of her
the ship threw up her nose and went down stern
first. We were picked up the next day by a
Danish b ig.
Now the odd thing is that the letter that re-
minded me of that experience has nothing what-
ever to say about ships. Please help me to find
out the association
The lady who w ites the letter says that in
July, 1881, she got a bad fright. Exac ly what it
was she doesn t tell. I v\it-h she did. Anyway it
so upsc her that she did it' get over the effects of
it for niue years. After that her appetite fell off;
she lost all real leli-h for food, and what she did
eat only made t ouble in-iead of nourishing her.
Jtgave her pain in the pit of the stomach and
(curiously enough) between ihe shoulders. She
says her eyes and skin p. esently turned yellow as
a but e cup. Her face and abdomen swelled, and
her feet the same, the lat er so much so that she
was obliged to have her suoes made larger.
“ I got little sleep at night,” she says, “ and was
in so much pain I hid to be propped up with pil-
lows. For weeks together 1 could not lie down in
bed. I had a dry, hollow cough, and bad night
sweats. Then diarrhoea set in and my bowels
became ulcerated I was often in dreadful agony
for forty-eight hours at a time. Then I would
have a chill as 'hough a bucket of cold water were
poured down my back. I got so low I could no
longer sew, knit, or do any housework or look
after my children. My sister had to come and
help in the house.
“ Everybody said I was in a decline and must
die. What I suffered for eight years tongue
cannot tell. The doctor could do nothing for me.
He said my complaint was complicated and bad to
deal with. In 1886 I wen tas an outdoor patient
to the Shrewsbury Infirmary, but only got
transient relief. ”
The writer is in good health now, but why did
her case remind me of the shipwreck ? Let’s settle
that first. The a-sociation is easy and natural.
Just see. The ship sank because we four men
hadn’t the strength to pump out the water as fast
as it came in. twenty men might have got her
into port. It is the last straw that breaks the
camel’s back ; the last unsupplied need that makes
poverty abject and desperate.
These bodies of ours carry the seeds of disease
with them all the time —chiefly the poisons created
by imperfect digestion, made worse by careless
habits. But as long as nothing extraordinary
happens we manage to scrape along in a half-and-
half sort of fashion. Yet We’ve got in our blood
the stuff that any of a dozen diseases is made of,
only waiting for something to set it afire. While
the liver, kidneys, and lungs and skin keep us
fairly free —that is, don’t let the load get too heavy
—we say, “ Oh, yes, I’m tolerably well, thank
you.” Little pains and unpleasant symptoms
bother us now and then, but we don’t fancy they
mean anything.
By-and-bye something happens. A cold, too
hearty a meal, a night of dissipation, an affliction
through death or loss of property, a fright, as in
Mrs. Bunco’s case, &c. Over we go. The last
straw has crushed us. One loose spark has blown
up the barrel of powder. The crew is too small to
save the ship. The kidneys, liver, skin, and
stomach strike work, and we must have help right
away or perish. All of which means the explosion
of latent indigestion and dyspepsia poisons in the
blood.
There 1 isn’t it plain why I thought of the ship ?
Now for the conclusion of the lady’s story. She
says : “In 1889 1 first heard of Mother Seigel’s
■Curative Syrup. Half a bottle made me feel
better, and by keeping on taking it I was soon
strong and well as ever. (Signed) Mrs. Ann
Bunce, The Park, Worthen, near Shrewsbury,
February 22nd, 1893.”
If there were only a way to save sinking ships
as certain and trustworthy as Mother Seigel’s
medicine is in the case of sinking human bodies,
•what a blessing it would be to poor sailors.*
The Story of a Signature .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the stirring times of native land-purchase in the
North Island of Mnorilund, when several wealthy
syndicates competed with each other for the in-
heritance of the Maoris, l)r. Buller, naturalist
and financial magnate, and Hon. Johnny Shee-
han, ex-Native and Defence Minister, reaped a
rich harvest of fees. This, in fact, was where
Buller made the fortune lie took to London to
spend, and which, I have no doubt, he is still en-
joying.
Sheehan made the more money of the two, but
he generally had it all spent some time before he
got it. Tiie two men were engaged by rival
syndicates, and they, in turn, engaged a staff of
agents, touts, interpreters and other border vaga-
bonds to do the routine work of the land-purchase
business. Both were expert Maori scholars, know-
ing not only the language, but every trait in the
' native character ; in addition to which they had a
powerful influence with the people generally.
The natives loved Sheehan as one of themselves,
for he sang their songs, danced their hakas, made
love to their wahines, slept in their whares, and
distributed his money and other favors with the
same lavishness as marked the bestowal of his
affections. He never refused to anyone anything
that he had it in his power to give. I have known
him receive <£soo in one sum in the morning
and not have a copper by sundown. His wine-
bill at the hotel where he stayed was seldom less
than .£lO a day ; at times it was very much more.
Indeed, I have known him spend as much as
£6O in one “ shout ” while perhaps a creditor was
waiting outside to dun him for a debt, most likely
incurred by some friend in his name. The veriest
stranger who could tell him a tale of woe about a
sick wife and a hungry baby could always reckon
on emptying his pockets, and if his pockets were
already empty he did not hesitate to pledge his
credit for what was wanted. When he went to
church on Sunday, the priest was generally richer
by .£5 or ,£lO when the service was over. I have
known him put a cheque on the plate for a fairly
large sum, and though it sometimes happened
that there was not sufficient at the bank to meet
it, still Johnny’s intention was good.
For a short session of the Lands Court he and
Buller would each receive, perhaps, <£soo as a
retainer and <£loo a day besides, not to speak of
occasional “refreshers ” and side practice. Buller
was known as the Pakira (or the Bald Head). He
was economical in his mode of living, and always
required discount on his bills. Yet he was at
times a man of large and wise hospitalities. Un-
like Sheehan, he had no creditors, and lived on
the sound principle of cash payments.
Sheehan’s great influence with the natives was
illustrated in a remarkable fashion when difficulty
was experienced in getting the whole of the native
owners in a block of land to sign away their
inheritance; for until every man, woman, and
child had affixed his, her, or its sign manual to
the deed of sale, no Crown grant could issue to
the purchasers. It often happened that one indi-
vidual declined to sell after the other members of
the hapu had affixed their signatures and obtained
their money, and to circumvent this obstruc-
tionist all kinds of devices were resorted to. A
bundle of notes were flashed before him or a bag
of gold jingled in his ear. If this did not bring
him to his senses a determined effort was made to
make him drunk and get at him in that way. This
latter device frequently succeeded when all else
had failed. Neither Sheehan nor Buller, I may
say, had anything to do with tins part of the busi-
ness.
The syndicate, which had taken in hand the
purchase of a block of some 500,000 acres in the
Auckland province, found itself in a disagreeable
corner for want of a signature. All the tribe had
signed with the exception of one old man
named Paraki, and until he put his pen to
paper the title could not be completed. Fully
.£lOO,OOO had already been sunk in securing the
property, but without Paraki’s signature the
money had been spent to no purpose. Every
known device was adopted to induce him to
sign. As much money was spent in making ihe
old man drunk as would have paid for his share
twice over. When they filled him up with rum he
would lie down where he stood and decline to talk
business until he became sober again. After this
they would give him presents, all of which failed
to bring him to a proper sense of duty. Two or
three times a day, perhaps, he would march into
the syndicate’s office where the parchment was
always ready, and, asking for a pen, would spread
himself out over the document and make a flourish
right over the spot reserved for his signature—
without, however, touching the paper. Then he
would look up at the anxious faces standing
around him, put down the pen with a smile, and
pulling his old blanket up round his naked loins,
would walk out of the office with a hurricane of
curses in his wake.
This went on for weeks, Paraki finally declining
to have anything whatever to do with, the deed,
despite the large sums of money offered him.
In this dilemma the syndicate appealed to
Sheehan.
“ We’ll give you .£lOO if you can get Paraki to
sign,” said the secretary.
“ You will give me £500,” said Sheehan.
The company declined the offer, but two days
after they told Sheehan that he could have the
£5OO.
“I want £lOOO now,” said Sheehan.
There was nothing else for it. Sheehan got his
thousand and the company got the signature.
Paraki, I think, got a new blanket.

What Killed Lowater
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I heard about Lowater’s luck, I
thought I would go and congratulate that hero of
a hundred debts. No need to specify the part of
Sydney he lived in. He doesn’t live there,
now—no; anywhere else! He is dead, and I
fancy I’m about the only person who really knows
what killed him.
At top of a tall old house, overlooking one of the
least aesthetic corners of the harbor, dwelt
Lowater in a room for which there is every reason
to believe he had once paid a week’s rent. But
that had been two years ago, and as his landlady
—an ancient virgin with a hard eye and a hairy
chin —was, with all her other lodgers, a stern
exacter of her pound of flesh and a bit over, there
are grounds for the hypothesis that in her sour,
Calvinistic way she had come to accept the un-
remunerative Lowater as an unescapable develop-
ment of the essential cussedness of things. Here,
at all events, after weird vicissitudes of staircase,
if you were lucky, you didn't find Lowater ; if
you were unlucky, he was in, and promptly bor-
rowed half-a-crown of you.
But now all this was to be changed. F’ortuno
had “ let up ” on Lowater at last. An unexpected
death and a legacy in five figures had brought rest
for the sole of his financial foot.
Straddled across his solitary cha ; r, I found him,
looming vaguely through the cloud from the
burnt-out old briar that for years had warmed his
nose and assisted his cogitations. And, as with
the pipe, so with all! He hadn’t even treated
himself to the shave the undue postponement of
which he had been wont to declare was the pain-
fullest circumstance attaching to the non-posses-
sion of threepence sterling. The outer man, in
fact, was still as consistently and harmoniously-
shabby as the inner was obviously unelated ; and
altogether, as Lowater slouched over to the bed
from the chair he had vacated in my favor, he had
so little the air of a legatee in even two figures—
to say nothing of five ! —that I had my doubts, and
expressed them. I was wrong, though. The
thing was true enough, Lowater said. Close on
.£20,000. Uncle in Bristol West-Indian trade.
“Bopped off suddenly!”
“And opportunely!” I said. “Though, ’pon
my soul, old man ! anybody would think, from the
look of you, that it was an injury the old gentle-
man had done you !’ And then of course, I got
off a recondite and obvious witticism about the
change from Lowater to high- water.
A smile died young about the bristly corners of
his mouth, as he took from it his ancient pipe,
and stared as if, in it, he beheld symbolised
the order of things which was passing away.
“ I suppose I shall have to get a new one 1 ” I
heard him mutter, and then, as his glance dropped
to his feet—“ An i new boots ! D n new boots!
I hate ’em 1 As for clothes,’ he looked suddenly
up at me, “these togs are p -etty fair still, aren’t
they ? Bass muster anywhere, wouldn’t they I ”
“As a dress-suit for Guy F'awkes, Esquire,
they might! ” I said, and his fine fell further.
“I see how it is,” he said. “You think I
ought to be a bit more set up over this business
than I am ? ”
“Think? Why, man, look at the creditor-
haunted life you’ve had of it for years ! Hell-
upon-earth it would be for me, I know ! ”
“Yes,” he murmured, “yes! It has been a
bit rough. But,” taking up one knee and nursing
it reflectively, “I—you see—l’ve got accustomed
to it! ”
“You’ll find it a lot easier to get accus-
tomed to the other thing, my fine fellow!
Just think of all the schemings, and skulkings,
and borrowings, and—excuse me ! —lyings you’ve
been driven to ! You’re not going to tell me you
like that sort of thing, are you ? ”
Lowater dropped his leg and took up his pipe
again. “N—no I” he said, uneasily rubbing his
nose with the stem. “ I can hardly say that I
like it. But ” —I scarcely caught the muttered
words—“ I shall miss it, for all that —miss it most
damnably ! ”
# # *
Not till three months later did I meet
Lowater aga’n—coming out of a Pitt-stmet cafd,
well-dressed, well-lunched, and in jovial company
—but himself so far from jovial that I was fain to
ask if he’d been ill. He took leave of his friends
and walked a little way with me before he
answered. No ; he hadn’t been exactly ill ;
though, somehow, he didn’t feel altogether gay
either. I looked hard at his face. It was fleshier
than of old, and the peculiar, hunted expression
had faded; but plainly enough marked upon it
were the lines of a new worry and a worse.
“ Gambling, eh ? ”
“ No—very little in that way. Fact is, I’ve no
taste for it, any more than for liquor.”
“ Oh, well,” I said, “ in that case, we have only
to fall back upon the ”
“The woman?” he put in, quickly. “No,
you’re out of it again! Youd never guess,
unless—by the way, you don’t happen to have
half-a-crown about you, do you ? ”
I had ; and, wondering, I produced it.
“ Lend it me for a couple of weeks! ” said
Lowater, with so exactly the hurried half-shame of
his impecunious days that, wondering yet more, I
was handing over the coin when, with a mirthless
little laugh, he pushed back my hand.
“That’s the trouble!” he said. “Do you
remember my telling you that I should miss the
makeshifts and the dodges of the empty pocket ?
“Something of the kind. But, surely
“ That’s what s the matter, then 1 I d give any-
thing, this moment, to be badly in want of half-a-
crown, and to be compelled to borrow it! Good
day to you ! ” and he walked away.
“ Give anything ? ” I echoed as I stared after
him. “ Well, my friend, you have only to hand
over all your substance to those who don't thirst
after impecuniosity—one half-hours return to
which, unless Im vastly mistaken, would cure
you of about the strangest grievance any man ever
labored under! ”

“ Know a man called Lowater!”
“Lowater? —yes! That is, I did know him.
Haven’t seen him for nearly a year, though. Do
you know anybody of the name ?”
“Yes! —same man! I’ve heard him mention
your name. I’m attending him, you know—along
with Grubber.”
“ Attending him ? He’s ill, then ! What’s the
trouble ? ’
Dr. Skemlett looked me so hard in the face that
I saw he was sorely tempted towards an unpro-
fessional wink. “ Well, now, look here !” he
said. “ You’re sufficiently one of ourselves to
understand me when I say that we call it neuras-
thenia.”
I nodded. “For want of a better name. No
discoverable specific affection, eh ? ’
“ Thats it! The man, in fact, has no patholo-
gical business to die—but he’s dying, for all that!
Will you go and see him? Here’s his address.”
“ Thanks, I'll go. But, about dying; what does
Grubber say ?”
“ Oh, just what you’d expect him to say ! That,
where there’s no diagnosis, there can’t possibly be
any prognosis ! Rule-of-thumb man, old Grub-
ber ! Slay you, secundum artem, sooner than cure
you untraditionally. But this poor chap, Lowater,
is booked. If you don’t see him to-night or to-
morrow, you won’t see him alive—that’s all! ”
* • m
“ He is asleep ! ” whispered the nurse.
“No!” the sick man said, catching the slight
sound with a facility which was, in itself, a
desperately bad sign, “Who is it? Oh — you?
Well, I wanted to see you. Was it Dr. Skem-
lett ? ”
“ Yes ; he told me you were pretty bad.”
“Told you I was dying, you mean! Don’t
trouble to deny it. It doesn’t matter much. But
the point is—why am I dying? What am I dying
of? Don’t use long-tailed doctor’s words, now.”
Fused the shortest- “ tailed ” words I could
find. “ Don’t know,” I said.
“Well, I know; and I’ll tell you, because” —
his voice suddenly weakened—“you’ve had the
history of the case from the first.”
“I? Why, you were well enough last time I
saw you.”
A faint smile flickered over the death-pinched
features. “I didn’t look it,” he said—“as you
lost no time in telling me. But, go further back—
to the time before that. When I had just come in
for ”
His voice died away, and the nurse stooped
over him with a restorative. ‘‘ He must talk no
more,” she said.
“ For the legacy,” resumed the sick man, un-
heeding. “What did I tell you, then ? —as I told
you afterwards. About the old life, I mean I ”
“Well, you said you’d got accustomed to the
hard-up, hand-to-mouth way of existence —if
that's what you’re referring to ? ”
“Yes; and to the dun-dodging, and the bor-
rowing. and the scheming, and the glorious
uncertainty and dubiousness of it all! It was—a
game, and I his tones tapered feebly off again
—“ I missed, as I said I should, the excitement
of it—dam ’’
Again the nurse, with soft expostulation,
stooped over the face into which had stolen sud-
denly the last great greynoss. But into the dying
eyes came also something like a twinkle, as, with
a ghastly whimsicality of persistence, Lowater
forced out the latter half of the bisected word :
“ Nably ! ” he gasped ; then his eyelids fluttered
rapidly and fell.
“ Gone ? ' I said gently after a pause.
“Yes!” answered the nurse, with a cheerful
relaxation of manner that was like a blow.
“ Gone, sure enough ! A strange death, too ! I
never saw one like it! And I haven t the slight-
est idea, no w, what he died of. He said some-
thing about you understanding the case, didn’t
he? Do you know?’
The uniformed young person elevated a pair of
very pretty eyebrows, and I answered the un-
finished question.
“ Yes,’ I said; “I know what his complaint
wa>, It is a common one enough, though I never
knew it to end fatally before. He died of
crumenitis. ’
It was an illegitimate compound, forced upon
me by the fact that I couldn t, for the moment,
remember the Greek word tor purse ■, but it was
unquestionably inflammation of that important
organ, the treasury, that killed Lowater.

“ Where’s that miserable book I’ve got to
translate, adapt, and condense into a short story ?
It’s a fearful thing to travel the world without
ideas and have to steal them from other people.
If a man is not rich he ought to be famous. When
he is neither he is merely a loafer, a beggar, a
thief, a hanger-on to the coat-tails of the world.
The world is mad for something new, and there
are only about six original ideas on earth. Six !

working against. Me, for a certainty. A good

and what I have done. He was just as tired of
everything as I am. He gets drunk on absinthe.
I’ve been drunk on almost every other liquor.

“ Last chapter. Well, there’s only a few'
leaves left to finish it all up. It’s one of these
trick novels, perhaps—where there is a sudden
solution like the key-move of a chess problem.
I’m in an awful fix —I mean the hero is—at pre-
sent. Don’t see how I’m going to get out of it in
four pages either. . . , One. . . . Two.

At Malvern Downs (Q.) shearing-shed two
shearers (Scotch and Australian) were disputing
as to their Biblical knowledge. Finally a tenner
was put up as to which of them could repeat the
“ Lord’s Prayer ” correctly. Sandy, after gauging
his man, starts, as a feeler, the 123rd Psalm—
“ The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want,”
