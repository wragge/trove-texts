MOST PICTURESQUE OF SCOTLAND'S UNIVERSITIES, ST. ANDREWS
ST. ANDREWS, a little city of 10,000 inhabitants, occupies a place
in Scottish history that is rivalled only by Edinburgh. The ancient
ecclesiastical capital of the country until the 17th century, residence
of the Scottish primate and home of the first; the city has been the
scene of countless events of national consequence or human drama.

present name; its earliest charter dates from the time of King Malcolm
IV (c. 1 160). The university, with its grey quadrangles splashed by
the scarlet of the students* is still a place where traditions
linger to charm the “stranger within the gate." It is. at the same
time, the oldest and smallest university in Scotland; founded by Bishop
Henry Wardlaw in 1411 and endowed with all the traditional
privileges by Pope Benedict XIII in 1413. The university has three
colleges and about 500 students. The Colleges of St. Salvator and
St. Leonard, founded respectively in 1450 and 1512, were combined
in 1747 to form the United College of St. Salvator and St. Leonard
with the faculties of arts and science. St. Mary s College, founded
in 1537, contains the theological faculty and the University Library.
John Knox resided in St. Leonard s College, and many of the
youthful Reformers studied here. Throughout the 1 and 7th
centuries the college remained a place of stirring drama in Scottish
life. Many of the most vivid episodes in the Reformation andin
the stormy career of John Knox were staged at St. Leonards. The
house in which Mary Queen of Scots lived can still be seen here,
and a thorn planted by her in a college quadrangle still flourishes.
The above picture shows a group of students in the courtyard
of St. Salvator’s Residence Hall.

A LEVIATHAN IN HAND.
A ustralia (University of California
Press; Angus and Robertson), edited by
C. Hartley Grattan, is one of the United
Nations series of books issuing in a
steady and authoritative stream from the
University of California under the general
editorship of Professor Robert J. Kerner.
It is a monster of a book, a leviathan.
Fowler’s Concise English Dictionary
defines “leviathan” as; “Sea monster
(bibl.); huge ship ; anything very large of
its kind; person of formidable ability,
power or wealth”: a description which
more or less fits Grattan’s Australia. It
is large of its kind, and it is written, in
the main, by persons of formidable
ability, rich in erudition and in academic
distinctions.
Any attempt to list the academic degrees
of the contributors to Australia in this
review, although fascinating in contem-
plation, must be abandoned as imprac-
tical. There are too many contributors
and there are too many degrees. Eris
O’Brien writes on early settlement, Pro-
fessor MacDonald Holmes writes on the
geography of Australia, Professor Elkin
on its Native Peoples, Professor Bland on
Public Administration, Professor Bailey
on the Constitution; and so on—one
eminent authority treading, as it were, on
the other’s heels, with Doctors of Philo-
sophy almost as plentiful as spring
flowers in Sydney’s Botanical Gardens,
From Professor MacDonald Holmes’s
article one learns that Australia lies be-
tween east longitude 113 deg, 9min. and
153 deg. 39mm., has a total area of
2,974,581 square miles, measures approxi-
mately 2400 miles from east to west and
2000 from north to south, and has a coast-
line of about 10,000 miles. Again, with
geological detail, there is information con-
cerning the heights of mountains, and a
variety of maps and charts. And for
those who take pleasure in catching an
authority out, there is the interesting fact
that in Table 1 (Seasonal Incidence of
Rainfall) Melbourne is included under the
heading N.S.W.: a pleasure immediately
dimmed by the knowledge that the
solecism is merely a compositor’s error —
it is extremely unlikely that MacDonald
Holmes, who is Professor of Geography
at Sydney University, really thinks Mel-
bourne is a part of New South Wales,
Impressive as the maps and charts of
Professor MacDonald Holmes are, they
pale into insignificance before the
accumulated energies of Burton, Walker,
Crawford and Clark, writing on a variety
of economic subjects. Brian Fitzpatrick
manages to get through an article on
Secondary Industries without a chart or
diagram, but Colin Clark uses eight charts
and a full page of statistics in a short
essay on Tertiary Industries, and J. G,
Crawford, writing on Primary Industries,
has a perfect passion for graphs.
It is possible, of course, that charts and
graphs are a necessity of the subject—that
an article on Tertiary Industries without
statistics would be something like Hamlet
without the Prince of Denmark ; and it is
difficult for anyone who is not a profes-
sional economist to form an accurate
judgment on the value of these articles to,
say, an economist in Missouri, or an
accountant in New York. But the sus-
picion survives that Clark, at least, is
rather overdoing the technicalities of his
subject in a book intended, presumably,
for the general reader. Significantly,
Professor F. A. Bland, who ranks as
very heavy metal in economic and
academic circles, expresses himself clearly
and unambiguously, beginning his article
on Public Administration with a direct
diagnosis:
The outstanding characteristic of public
administration in Australia is addiction to
centralisation
and going on to illustrate the text that
this addiction is injurious to the substance
of popular government (“Few will be
found to deny that good government is
no substitute for self-government”) by an
examination of local - government,
statutory corporations, the public service
and the general approach to politics and
administration in Australia.
Professor Bland gives a clear historical
outline and mentions in passing a piece
of comparatively recent history of con-
siderable importance: the interaction of
political and economic factors which led
to public servants’ rates of pay being
fixed by arbitration courts after the First
World War:
Although this meant weakening the
authority of the commissions in their most
vital parts, the Governments acquiesced in
the demands of the staff associations, and
the Arbitration Courts now provide an
alternative method for determining salaries.
The application of a common scale for
groups of employees has lessened the im-
portance of efficiency and merit and has
measurably increased the cost of govern-
ment.
And, closely related to it, the amend-
ment to the Constitution of N.S.W. in
1916 which allowed officials to contest
elections without prior resignation. This,
on the surface a harmless concession,
was, in Bland’s opinion, a first step to-
wards a “politicalised” public service—the
beginning of a drift, which is currently
expressed in the growing inclination of
public-service associations to affiliate with
Trades and Labor Councils:
Where the public has seemed indifferent
to the emergence of political public servants,
it has become apprehensive and critical of
group affiliations, especially when that
action is by State schoolteachers and the
State police.
Professor Bailey, writing on the Con-
stitution, constantly refers to the Con-
stitution of the United States, a circum-
stance which, combined with the clarity
of the essay as a whole, should be of
interest to American readers. The chief
interest to Australian readers will be in
passages where he pronounces what may
well be the official legal view of the Gov- s
emment.
Sir Frederick Eggleston, writing
on Foreign Policy, expresses himself so
diplomatically that nothing very definite
is stated, although the general impression
is one of smooth authority. Discussing
our Asiatic neighbors, he says:
Java now supports 70,000,000. How
many would it support if Dutch organisa-
tion and efficiency were absent?
But he neglects to mention the curious
duality of our foreign policy in connec-
tion with the Dutch and Javanese. No-
where in the article is there any mention
of the Wharflaborers’ Union.
Considering the book as a whole —
glancing down the table of contents again
and noting all the contributors —Mac-
Donald Holmes, Eris O’Brien, John M.
Ward, R. M. Crawford, G. F. James,
L. F. Fitzharding, Bailey, Gollan, Bland,
Eggleston, Burton, Walker, J. G. Craw-
ford, Fitzpatrick, Clark, Butlin, Lloyd
Ross, T. H. Kewley, Grattan, Vance and
Nettie Palmer, H. M. Green, Bernard
Smith, Clive Turnbull, Bishop Burgmann,
K. S. Cunningham, Elkin, Greenwood,
Gavin Long, Coombs —it is obvious that
the editor has followed a consistent policy
in the selection of the material which he
considered important, and in the selec-
tion of the men—of varying schools of
thought—who write on it. There is
an impressive grouping of authorities;
besides those specially mentioned, Gordon
Greenwood on “Australian Interests in
the South Pacific Islands” (Dr. Green-
wood is Senior Lecturer in History at
Sydney University, and has made a special
study of the subject), Gavin Long
(Official War Historian) on World War
11, Dr. Coombs on Reconstruction, Pro-
fessor Butlin on Banking, Professor
Crawford and G. F. James on the Gold
Rushes, L. F. Fitzharding on the Com-
monwealth and Dr. Cunningham on
Education. Throughout the book there
is a slight and deliberate overlapping of
material which serves the useful purpose
of comparison, and also underlines the
unobtrusive theme: the historical develop-
ment —a growth to nationhood.
There is, too, the avowed moral pur-
pose of the United Nations series (to
promote goodwill and understanding be-
tween the nations) to give the book a kind
of Biblical bulk, and prestige. It is diffi-
cult to quarrel with such an excellent
purpose. And it is not difficult to imagine
Grattan’s Australia as a ship, crammed
with information, on a trans-Pacific
mission of goodwill. Or as a whale.
Now if an ordinary person, quietly
bathing in Manly Pool or its American
equivalent, were to run suddenly into a
whale he would experience, probably, a
certain feeling of respectful consterna-
tion ; just such a feeling, in fact, as would
seize an ordinary reader plunged without
warning into Mr. Clark’s statistics or
Professor MacDonald Holmes’s charts.
And if by chance the creature was washed
up on the beach, and perished, he would
find the job of disposing of it a wearisome
business. A zoologist, on the other hand,
would probably be delighted to find a
whale so close to shore, and would be in-
terested in dissecting it.
It may be argued, of course, that if
books were written only for the “ordinary
reader”—for an arbitrarily-drawn dead
level of intelligence—some of the best
books in the world would never have been
written. But the articles in Australia are
written, in the main, by specialists, and
although, under close examination, there
are not too many technicalities for com-
prehension (by the ordinary reader), and
although it is probable that the writers
have consciously softened the edge of
their erudition, there is an unconscious
flavor of specialisation about most of the
book. One has the impression that the
writers, although consciously writing for
the layman, have a specialist audience at
the back of their minds, and so, making
their arguments watertight, as it were,
often succeed in making them imper-
meable. For the “ordinary reader,” after
all, is universal: one cannot be a
specialist on everything.
Ross Gollan, a newspaperman, writing
on “Party Politics,” is lucid, informative,
balanced: his article is an exception to
the general rule and one of the best in
the book. Doctor Cunningham, writing
on the important subject of education,
has the difficult task of bringing together
the characteristics of six separate and
autonomous State educational systems
into a general whole, and presenting the
synthesis in an essay. He tackles the
job by tracing the evolution of education
here, clearly bringing out the influences
which similar background—and, to a
lesser degree, imitation—have had in pro-
ducing a species of overall uniformity. In
this connection it is interesting to note
how Cunningham interprets the Aus-
tralian system against the social-economic-
political background: whether those
in charge of education pay much atten-
tion to these matters is another matter.
From Dr. Cunningham’s remarks it
appears that they do not.
Centralisation comes up again in Cun-
ningham’s essay. No doubt, he says, a
highly centralised administration with a
rigid examination system may lead to
efficiency. But it can also lead to in-
flexibility and a perpetuation of medio-
crity. Australians, Dr. Cunningham
points out, are inclined to be complacent
about their educational system with, per-
haps, little justice. He is of the opinion
that the system suffers by comparison with
English and American systems, which
reflect a belief in the need for variety and
experimentation, and he criticises the link
between educational administration and
politics;
Even changes in school curricula and
general organisation can be regarded as
matters of policy not to be decided with-
out Cabinet approval. The professional
officers of the department even if they
feel that there are serious weaknesses,
cannot easily give publicity to their
opinions. They are often placed in the
position of explicitly or implicitly defending
the Government. This is often rendered
easier by the fact that the criticism may be
extreme, or the critics uninformed.
r On the Australian universities he passes
the obvious judgment that they lack that
“close relationship with the community”
which is typical of most American univer-
sities, and, at the same time, have not yet
achieved the background of traditional
culture of the universities of the Old
World. (Vance and Nettie Palmer, in
their somewhat ambiguously entitled essay
on “culture,” have something interesting
to say on the influence of Australian uni-
versities on writers: in brief, that few
writers have sprung from the universities,
but that the literary influence of the
universities in the professions, particularly
in law, has been strong. They, mention
Deakin, Sir Samuel Griffith and Mr.
Justice Higgins.)
Cunningham criticises, incidentally, the
daily-newspaper practice of publishing
results of public examinations, which
leads to a comparison of the passes in
various schools and an obsession with
examination-passing as such. On the
other hand he pays tribute to Australian
technical education, to the Correspon-
dence Schools (which have been widely
imitated abroad) and to Federal agencies
such as the A.C.E.R. His review of the
attempts to bring compulsory, free and
secular education to a sparsely-popuiated
continent is of interest, firstly, to the
student of comparative education, Aus-
tralian or American, and secondly to the
general reader. His essay, in subject and
treatment, is on the borderline between
the historical essays and Gollan’s article
and the more heavily specialised subjects.
His style is clear and unambiguous, but
social-economic-political factors are, after
all, abstractions. Dr. Cunningham’s
essay would have gained in interest, and
certainly in color, if he had described one
particular school.
An essay by Hartley Grattan on “The
Social Structure of Australia” belongs to
a special category. Mr. Grattan, who is
the editor of the book, is an American
authority on Australian affairs. He has
the advantages both of knowledge and de-
tachment. The main point he makes is
the comparative weakness of the middle-
class in Australia, and the historical
significance of its changes of allegiance.
“The Australian middle-class has never
been able to impose its values on the
nation as the American middle-class has
done.”
The general emphasis in Australia is
on economic and social factors. The
arts have been somewhat curtly dealt
with. Bernard Smith, writing on painting,
dismisses the art of Norman Lindsay,
Blamire Young and J. J. Milder in one
embracing paragraph, while giving a quite
unjustified prominence to Russell Drys-
dale, Noel Counihan, Roy Dalgarno,
James Cant, Herbert McClintock,
Roderick Shaw, Hal Missingham, Jean
Bellette, David Strachan, Francis Lym-
buraer and Wolfgang Cardamatis. Lance
Solomon, Australia’s leading contempo-
rary painter of landscape in oils, is not
even mentioned. Thus there is a double
misrepresentation: a distortion of em-
phasis in the book as a whole, and, by
the selection of a man who is outlining
not the total achievements of Australian
art but the views of a special group, an
utterly false picture of art in Australia.
Perhaps Mr. Grattan, who has so
shrewdly selected experts to write on
Geography and Public Administration,
found the task of selecting someone to
write on art more difficult, Bernard
Smith has written a book on Australian
art: ergo, Mr. Smith , must be the
authority on art in Australia.
There was much more justification in
selecting H. M. Green to write about Aus-
tralian literature: Mr. Green has been
long in the field. His views are expressed
cautiously and, on the whole, soundly.
A general characteristic of his criticism
is a certain radical conservatism: it is
as hard for a young writer to get a men-
tion from him as it is for a young
cricketer to get a game in some suburban
cricket teams. Where young—or com-
paratively young—writers do get a notice,
Mr. Green seems to choose the wrong
ones. James McAuley and A. D. Hope
are respectable verse-writers, and may
do well; but had Judith Wright and
Francis Webb not come under Mr.
Green’s eye when his article was written?
Clive Turnbull’s contribution on
“Journalism in Australia” leaves much to
be desired. Like Smith’s article on art,
it reflects a special viewpoint. Writing
on The Bulletin in the days of Archi-
bald, Turnbull gives a clear and interest-
ing account of its influence, and then goes
on to say:
When Archibald retired, its critics said,
the spirit went out of it. Under its altered
motto, “Australia for the White Man,”
it appeals to a different public today. On
March 7, 1945, the Minister for Informa-
tion, Mr. Arthur Augustus Calwell, a
member of the Labor party, said in the
House of Representatives, “the ‘Bulletin’
is undoubtedly the most anti-Australian of
all newspapers published in Australia,” a
pronouncement which would have astounded
the Laborites of the ’nineties.
Mr. Turnbull does not make it clear
whether or not he concurs with this in-
teresting judgment by the master of the
Manila girls, but his abstention from
comment is rather like the country
editor’s, “We hesitate to believe Coun-
cillor Brown’s statement that the Shire
President is a liar.”
On dissection Australia proves to be,
after all, not such a very large whale. It
is split into manageable chapters and
individual articles are interesting. Per-
haps the grouping of so many learned
authorities is a mistake —a professor, like
a leviathan, is best contemplated in
solitary splendor. The book’s virtues are
solid; its chief defects are abstraction
and dullness.
At the same time, it fills a want: in-
completely, if such an exhaustive study
can be conceived as being in any way
incomplete. But with such formidable
chapters on economics, something might
have been said of Australia’s achieve-
ments in the physical sciences, and on the
subjects of industries (primary and
secondary). Some sketches might have
been made of industries as they are: a
sheep farm, for instance, and a big in-
dustrial undertaking like a steel-works.
And, for color, a description of such
places as the Botanical Gardens or Manly
Pool. An American soldier who has
been out here, and has seen Melbourne
and Brisbane and Sydney’s King’s Cross
may fairly claim that he knows something
of the vital essence of this country which
he can look for in vain in Grattan’s
Australia. If, indeed, he does look. More
probably he will read the Table of Con-
tents with immense respect, and place
the book carefully at the back of a book-
case.

A NEW DEVELOPMENT
Spreader Firing, combined with a
Forward Moving Grate
The introduction of the
Forward Moving Grate,
discharging ash continu-
ously, has widened the scope
of Spreader Firing because:
I. Combustion conditions
are not disturbed by inter-
mittent ash removal.
2. There is no clinker for-
mation, even with ash
having very low fusion tem-
perature, as the bulk of the
air required for combustion
passes through and cools
the ash layer, thereby
avoiding harmful deposits
on the pressure parts.

3. Automatic control

4. High burning rates are
readily attained, as the fuel
and,4;he air are evenly dis-
tributed over every square
foot of grate area.
Whatever your steam requirements may be, and whatever fuel
you may use, you can rely upon Babcock & Wilcox for advice,
which will be given without bias. As manufacturers of chain grate,
travelling grate, retort type and spreader stokers, also pulverised
fuel firing and oil firing equipment, in addition to furnaces designed

Details of life'and works of Francis
Adams ?
Born Malta, Sept. 27, 1862, he was
educated at a private school at
Shrewsbury, afterwards at Paris. After
acting as assistant master at Ventnor
College he came to Australia in 1882.
In 1884 he published Henry and Other
Poems, in 1885 Leicester, an auto-
biography, followed in 1886 by Aus-
tralian Essays, The Madeline Brown
Murder and Poetical Works. In 1888
appeared Songs of the Army of the
Night, which went through three
editions in London. During his resi-
dence in Sydney he wrote regularly
for The Bulletin. In 1889 he left
Australia for London, where he pub-
lished John Webb’s End, and con-
tributed to the “Fortnightly Re-
view.” He spent the winter of 1892-
P 3 in Egypt, and in 1893 returned to
England, where he died by his own
hand at Margate on Sept. 4.

(1) Did a bushranger known as
Starlight exist or was he entirely a
fictitious character? (2) What was
the ultimate fate of the bushranger
Moonlight? (3) Did a sergeant of
mounted police of period 1850-70
wear stripes of his rank as today or
below the elbow?
(1) According to a statement made
some years ago by Rolf Boldrewood’s
son, Gerald Browne, the character as
presented in his father’s book
Robbery Under Arms was based on
the salient points. of three men, but
owed most to the horse-thief and bush-
ranger known as Moonlight. (2)
Captain Moonlight (actual name Scott,
and a native of Ireland) was hanged
at Darlinghurst on January 20, 1880,
for murder of Constable Bowen.
(3) They appear to have been worn
inverted, on the cuff.
What is the difference between a
two- and three-dimensional painting?
Two-dimensional paintings are those
which express nothing save a flat
pattern such as the old Byzantine
painters made, and the Florentines
before 1300. After Giotto,
shading was introduced to give
roundness to the figures and distance,
and perspective was used in land-
scapes. The more realistic style is
sometimes termed three-dimensional
as a convenient method of distinguish-
ing it from the earlier method.

What are the Nobel prizes?
There are five of them, founded by
the will of Dr. Alfred Nobel, who
died in 1896, and are awarded each
year for the most important discovery
or improvement in (1) physics, (2)
chemistry, (3) physiology or medicine,
(4) the most distinguished literary
work of an idealistic tendency, and
(5) the best effort towards the pro-
motion of peace.

How to preserve eggs in salt-and-
lime solution?
The solution is formed by mixing
freshly-slaked lime at the rate of
21b. to five gallons of water, stirring
three times per day until a milky fluid
is formed. To this solution 11b. .ot
fine salt should be added. After being
allowed to stand for several hours,
the liquid should be poured on; it
is then ready for the eggs.

How is oil of lavender made ?
Almost fill a large bottle with laven-
der tops, add enough spirits of wine
to fill the bottle; cork and leave m
a warm place six to eight weeks.
Strain the. oil, which will float on top
of the spirit, into a clean bottle. One
tablespoon of this oil in 4oz. of water
makes a good perfume.

Recipe for a colorless transparent
priming ?
Take yellow wax, 1\ pints
boiled linseed oil, 2 pints turpentine,
lib. resin. Dissolve the wax m the
linseed oil and the resin in the tur-
pentine, separately over a slow heat,
when quite melted, mix all by stirring
gently into one another. This dries
fairly soon, but hardens gradually.

papers, as silverfish thrive on the
glazed paper used in catalogues and

nothing better than insect-spray

a pump; failing this, use kerosene

A TRIP TO MANLY.
You cannot mistake the Manly Ferry,
Where for fifty years it has been very
Distinctive in design and build,
And captained by hands so skilled,
That all those years no accident major
Has been attributed to the behavior
Of the captain and the crew,
Which proves the safety of the trip to do.
As you sail down the stream
Fort Denison can be seen;
Garden Island is on the right;
On the left the Zoo is snug so tight.
In the distance there is the old Clontarf,
And old ’uns remember the many a laugh
They had in the ’nineties so gay
When they were young and had their say.
At the Heads as it was a very fine day
We experienced the thrill of the gentle
sway
Of the Ferry as she passed the Captain
Cook,
A sight which makes one always look.
As we step off the ferry the pool is seen,
And then beyond the patches of green,.
While on the sand young matrons with
baby and pram
Are lying around to get a good sun tan.
As one sits on the seat and surveys the
scene
You must admit that Manly’s the Queen
Of the State’s holiday places
Which can be mentioned without any
grimaces.
There’s the Ocean Beach where you get
the spray
And the white horses ride the waves every
day.
While the Cardinal’s Palace on the hill,
Are symbols of Manly that give us a
thrill.

RIVERVIEW PRIDE
By
OLAF
RUHEN
Danny nicholls had
a split personality if ever
a man did. Most of the
year he slunk around the
stables and the byres, a little
fleeting shadow with a bucket or
a dandy-brush, comical in worn
leather leggings so grazed and
broken that there was no sur-
face left to polish. He looked
as though he wouldn’t have the
heart to polish his leggings.
But in the Season he rode
abroad, sitting very straight and
dignified on the skewbald geld-
ing, a Lord of the Road, and
certainly something more than
an ordinary human to River-
view Pride of Jocelyn, dancing
staccato beside him, and scream-
ing insolently at every mare for
miles.
RIVERVIEW PRIDE was a
great bay Clydesdale with a
white blaze and four white
stockings. At four years he
girthed 84 inches, and stood
sixteen hands. He had a crest
like all the Kings of Hanover,
and he never stood wrong. He
was well coupled and a good
doer. Elis fault lay in the short
old-fashioned pasterns, a bit
overfeathered. AH his gets were
to develop the shuffling pigeon-
toed gait that harked right back
to Saracen, on his dam’s side,
and there were those that said
they had a tendency to greasi-
ness, though they worked well.
But there was never a sign of
greasy heel on Riverview Pride,
fresh from his high dry pasture
on the hillside.
And he had a wall-eye, a
white rolling eye, a tremendous
angry eye that lent character to
his head.
When the last mares of the
Season were in foal, and the
Pride was retired again to the
double-fenced paddock on the
hill, Danny lost stature. He put
on his old clothes, and worked
about the stable-yard with the
teams and the riding-hacks, and
helped in the byre on occasions.
The Pride was just one of his
tasks. It was the task above all
that he attended to conscien-
tiously, hissing between his teeth
like a nesting goose as he worked
the currycomb into the stal-
lion’s coat, and ambling busily
to and from the isolated loose-
box with a stable-bucket. He
“Got to make ’em go a lot further these days, Bert”
wore a cloth cap pulled over
one eye and a ragged vest; and
you took it for granted that he
had served his apprenticeship in
a racing stable.
DANNY’S wife Flora looked
huge beside him. She was
not overbig, but she was plump
and slow, and she stood idle half
the day in the doorway of their
cabin, in the sun. Beside her
would be ranged an empty
wood-box, and an empty kero-
sene-tin or two for Danny to
take to the well, and perhaps a
pair of the kids’ shoes for Danny
to take and mend in the harness-
room.
In the middle of the day,
when Danny w a s trying to rest
on the baled hay in the loft.
she’d call to Bob the rouse-
about.
“Tell Mr. Nicholls I want
him.” “Tell Mr. Nicholls I’m
right out of water.” Or “The
water in the can’s all got warm,
Have you seen Mr. Nicholls?”
“Have you seen my husband?
I haven’t laid eyes on him all
day, not since breakfast.”
And soon you would see
Danny slinking up the path with
a kerosene-tin, or his under-
nourished rump in the stackyard
where he’d be searching the
straw for nests to furnish the
baking eggs.
Sometimes when she drove
the fat grey cob to town, Danny
would go with her in the gig,
hunched up in the corner with
his elbow reaching over the back
of the seat, and blind to every-
thing on the road. Flora
handled the reins—not the way
that Danny would have, but
Danny never complained.
He would stay in the gig until
she had done all her shopping,
and then, when she had got to
the library at last, he would slip
over to the pub while she
changed her book, and drink
two handles of beer very quickly
and come back to sit on the seat
until she returned.
Some weeks the spectacled
lady who ran the library would
have books set aside for her, and
she would be first back to the
gig. Then she would drive down
the road, a little at a time, and
Danny would bustle down the
middle of the road after her until
he caught up. When he was in
the seat she would call to the
cob, and jog back home again
until the next week.
There were three Nicholls
kids, two boys and a girl, funny
little beggars with tow hair and
pale serious faces. The boy,
who was eldest, jog-trotted all
over the place. He never walked,
and he crabbed a bit when he
was running in the same sort
of funny way Danny used to get
about the stables. The girls
played dll day at the back of
the cabin by the fowlhouses
under the trees. Flora ruled
them all as though rebellion was
a thing she couldn’t imagine.
“Mag-gie . . . Al-bert.” Her
call carried over to the back of
the Forty-acre, and all the hands
would stop what they were do-
ing and grin to watch the
scramble.
Where Danny’s horses glis-
tened in the sun with well-being,
the kids were barefooted and
tousle-headed, and their clothes
were ragged,
“No sense buying clothes for
them little beggars,” Danny
would say. “They’re out of
them before you turn round,”
D IVERVIEW PRIDE never
1 ' wore shoes, either. Jim
Whelan, the smith, charged ten
bob a shoe for the first set he
put on.
“By God I earned it, too,” he
said. “Them hooves of his is
like iron, and him running on
that mountainside you’d know
they would be. And he won’t
save you his weight. Why don’t
you teach him to stand, man?”
“It’s just he’s not used to you.
He’ll stand as sweet as a maid
for me,” boasted Danny,
Next morning the Pride had
only a front shoe on, and that
loose. 'They found one of the
hind shoes a chain outside his
fence where he had kicked it.
“What sort of a smith do you
call yourself now, Whelan?”
Danny wanted to know,
Whelan took no offence.
Danny knew he was a good one,
and was only talking because
he wanted everyone to know
what sort of a horse this was
that he led at the end of a rope,
Danny found the hooves
heavy enough when he had to
trim them, and he used a lurk
he didn’t want anyone to see.
He brought the little sledge into
the loose-box, and set one of
the three-by-three pickets in one
corner of it, and rested the
Pride’s hoof on the square top
of the picket, to rasp it. He
couldn’t clip the hoof with the
farrier’s tongs at all, and he
used a wood chisel and a little
hammer to take the rough off.
He kept the tools in a niche in
the wall of the box, by the door,
j_[ E hit the Pride only once,
1 * He was carrying the feed in
to the manger, which was badly
placed at the back of the box,
and the Pride was following
him in as usual, nipping him
with his lips, and nodding his
head up against him as a stallion
does. A devil must have got
into the horse, and he took a
good hard clutch of Danny s
thin shoulder with his teeth, and
bit fairly hard,
Danny dropped everything,
picked up the hammer and laid
on to the Pride’s shoulders. Id
like to have seen that meek little
man, fighting the great horse
with his little hammer. He

A little patience can
m ?ym a lot of money
Because Vauxhall can save them £5O to £2OO, and Vauxhall
Is the proved favourite British car for Australian conditions,
more and more buyers are thinking twice before spending
possibly hundreds of pounds more than necessary. Every
year since 1934, when Australians were free to choose
any car they wanted, they bought more Vauxhalls than any
other British make.
If you must have immediate delivery, no matter what it
may cost you, there’s no more to be said. But if you’re
not in quite that hurry, it will pay you to wait for Vauxhall,
the car that will suit you best and save you money into the
bargain. Your Vauxhall dealer has all the facts the
detailed figures of purchases of all British cars since 1934
and all the details about Vauxhall’s current engineering
and value leadership. Before you commit yourself to
purchasing any make of car, see your Vauxhall Dealer.

hammered until the Pride was
standing sweating and trembling
at the side of the stall. Then he
stayed with him for hours,
soothing him and rubbing black
ointment on a place where he
had broken the skin.
Next morning the horse’s
shoulders were up all in lumps
the size of tennis-balls, and the
Boss asked Danny about them.
“You wouldn’t mind Jim Wal-
lace that led a big roan horse
for Munro?” said Danny. “That
was before your time, but may-
be you heard about it. He was
leadin’ on foot, and the horse
picked him up by the shoulder
at the cross-roads in front of
Meggett’s store, and carried him
as far as the post-office. He
never led another horse, Jim
didn’t. When they picked him
up all his shoulder-bones were
broken in little bits and he took
I don’t know how long, months,
it was, in the hospital.”
“Still, the Pride’s never tried
anything like that with you,
Danny,” the Boss pointed out.
Danny looked away. He
wasn’t used to talking to the
Boss, not talking back anyway.
“I don’t aim to let him start,”
he mumbled. “Jim never
handled another horse. Shook
him and tossed him like a dog
with a rat.”
He carried the feed into the
loose-box and the horse went in
after him, not at all afraid. But
it stood by the side of the box
till Danny had the feed in the
manger.
“He won’t need any more
lessons,” Danny said, coming
out. “That’s his first hiding,
and maybe it’s his last.”
The boss didn’t look very
convinced, but he walked away.
When he was too far off to hear,
Danny said: “Anyway, he don’t
use them shoulders.”
HEN the Season came,
Danny was transformed.
He wore new shiny leggings
and his best corduroy pants, and
a coat instead of the waistcoat.
The first man up in the morning
would find Danny already in
the stables, braiding the Pride’s
tail, or mixing charcoal paste
to take the new grass-stains
from the skewbald gelding’s
patches and fetlocks. He was
as excited as the Pride himself,
and just as anxious to look his
best. He was an expert at his
craft, and worthy of an expert’s
homage, and you could see he
expected it.
The Pride was travelling a
limited district, no more than
forty mares, and not too much
road-work; and after the first
“Massage or shampoo ?”
week Danny brought him back
to Riverview. There were seven
brood mares there, and these
came first as far as the Boss was
concerned. Danny spent every
minute with the horse for the
next fortnight.
You could notice a change in
Flora about then. Since Danny
had been gone she had carried
the water and the wood herself,
unless Bob the rouseabout
couldn’t avoid seeing her on the
path to the well. She kept right
on carrying it when Danny
came back. She took to hush-
ing the kids and calling them
quiet-like when Danny was
having his noon sleep in the hay,
and Bob swore he saw her one
meal-time polishing the deep
tan leggings.
There were a couple of girls
working in the kitchen at River-
view homestead, very interested
in the Pride, at this time. Even-
ings when the men led in the
brood mares they would steal up
to the pine-trees and the shrubs
back of the stableyard fence
and watch. It was worth watch-
ing.
Three-quarters of a ton of
horse was silk-shining from
every inch of his great lovely
body, dancing impatient, and
keen and eager, and dangerous
as a drawn dagger. Screams
softened to little love-nickers,
flashing teeth and lifting hooves
gave sudden place to lips that
nuzzled the mare as tenderly as
any human lover’s.
These were all phrases in a
story anyone could read, and
carry to the climax that was
pure majesty ; and the girls were
stirred by a beauty they couldn’t
name and would, maybe, have
feared to admit.
And Danny was among those
steel hooves, the iron limbs;
Danny carelessly intervening
when the ivory teeth flashed,
tending the giant in his amours,
encouraging or curbing him.
Danny wasn’t the same hand at
all who slunk around the stable
and the byres all winter. Danny
was at large in his province, the
master of the moment.
THE girls spoke to Danny
after that. Mavis, country-
bred, was shy, but long-legged
Kitty, red-lipped, black-headed,
sloe-eyed—Kitty made excuses
to see him. She called a greet-
ing from the washing-lines or
the dairy whenever he came in
sight. She found reasons for
excursions that took her by the
stables. Danny kept seeing her
in places where he had never
seen the girls before. He gave
her back her greetings, but
otherwise he didn’t seem to
notice her.
Very soon he was getting
ready for the road again.
Bob, the rouseabout, saw
Flora one day going in the barn
door just ahead of him. She
came out quickly and her face
was red as though with her
hurry. When she saw him she
stopped and looked as though
she were caught at something.
“You looking for something,
Mrs. Nicholls?” he asked as he
felt he ought.
“No, nothing, Bob. I wanted
to sew the leather on my shoe.
The strap’s come off my old
shoe and I was looking for the
palm, that’s all.”
“I’ll get it for you. It’s in
the harness-room.”
“I doubt that it’s there. Bob.
Have you—do you know where
Mr. Nicholls went?”
“He’s there in the barn, I
guess. Usually is, just past
noon.”
“No, he’s not. I wonder
could you find him for me?”
She seemed to be stopping him
from going in the barn,
“Just a minute. I’ll get you
the palm first, Mrs. Nicholls.”
He pushed past her and opened
the barn door and stopped.
There was no mistaking what he
saw. Danny, with Kitty, the city
wench, up on the baled hay in
the loft. Bob stepped outside
and closed the door softly.
“I just remembered, Mrs.
Nicholls. I left the palm in my
hut. I’ll just nip down and
bring it over to you later.”
“All right. Bob,”
| T was hard to tell what she
* was thinking. She didn’t
look mad. She didn’t even look
discontented as she usually did.
She usually looked dissatisfied
all the time.
He brought the Sewing-palm
over to the cabin after half an
hour or so, and she took it
from him as though she were
wondering what she would do
with it.
“Thanks, Bob.”
Then she looked him full in
the eye; “You didn’t find Mr.
Nicholls. It doesn’t matter.
He’s a busy man in the Season.
Aye, and he’s a wild one some-
times, too. There’s no holding
Mr. Nicholls sometimes in the
Season.”
Suddenly it came to him what
the queer look was. He couldn’t
think why, but it was easy to
see she was as proud as Lucifer.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
THE GREAT AIR-LIFT.
Already-noted definite effects
of the Berlin air-lift include such
a strong swing of German pub-
lic opinion to the Western side
that the air-lift, enforced by the
Russian blockade, can be said to
have finally wrecked the Krem-
lin hopes of a Sovietised Ger-
many.
Size and efficiency of the air-
lift could well have steadied
Kremlin war-thinking. The
same sort of service could be
delivering bombs.
Also, the air-lift, being carried
out under military conditions,
has provided British-U.S. air-
crew training that could not
otherwise have been given in
peace-time. If the Kremlin did
start a war strong air-opposition
would be trained to the split-
second.
London “Times” has given
some remarkable figures on
what the Kremlin plainly
thought could not be done. Be-
fore the air-lift started, Gatow,
the British terminal in Berlin,
had a traffic average of seven
aircraft in two days. The daily
average since then has been over
400 arrivals and departures, with
the top figure over 460. It
means an aircraft coming into
or taking off from Gatow every
90 seconds! And these are
planes with up to nine-ton-
load capacity.
“So critical is the time factor
in handling the aircraft,” says
the “Times” report, “that if a
pilot misjudges his landing
attempt he cannot make a
second attempt, because this
would interfere with the stream
of traffic coming up behind. He
must instead carry his load back
—"Christian Science Monitor,” Boston.
TOO DARK FOR READING.
to base and return with the
stream from his airfield.”
Adding that “there is no rea-
son to believe that the air-lift
cannot be maintained as long as
the need continues,” the report
points out that, while the ex-
penence gained would be invalu-
able in the event of another
wax, it may also be applied to
civil air-transport, particularly
in the flying-control methods
used with such outstanding
success at Gatow.”
Even so, the air-lift has been
accurately described by N. Y.
Times as costly and danger-
ous. Up to last month 11
planes had already cracked up,
with 19 deaths, and the real
winter test still to come. An
American air authority, Colonel
W. E. McDonald, has stated
that it is costing $lOO a ton to
fly supplies into Berlin.
The sort of brutishness the
air-lift is combating and so far
defeating has been pointed out
by Colonel Howley, Command-
ant of the American sector, who,
bitterly attacking the Soviet
authorities for imposing “the
most inhuman blockade in
modern times,” recalled that the
measures taken by the Russians
had included the stopping with-
out warning of supplies of fresh
milk. Had this not been
remedied by the Allied authori-
ties, he said, it would have re-
sulted in the deaths of 6300 in-
fants in the Western sectors of
Berlin within three days.
A Peace Coalition.
Editor of “Foreign Affairs”
Hamilton Fish Armstrong,
whose ideas have carried consid-
erable weight in American
policy-making, has now come up
with a proposal for what
amounts to an unrestricted coali-
tion of nations for the purpose
of maintaining peace and jointly
opposing the breaking of it.
That was the original idea for
the United Nations, and Arm-
strong’s present proposal is for a
working grouping of the peace-
seeking nations, which would
still work under U.N.0., giving
that body a strength it only too
obviously lacks. /
The most important single aim
in the setting up of U.N.O. was
to ensure that any aggressive
force that might emerge would
be inferior in strength to forces
already assembled to deal with
it. This aim has, of course, been
killed by the Soviet abuse of the
veto, which has persistently
blocked all efforts to that end in
the Security Council, and as well
has blocked any progress by the
U.N.O. Military Staff Com-
mittee, originally set up to
arrange for the military con-
tingents to be supplied by
members; a fate that has also
stopped the Atomic Energy
Commission.
The veto cannot merely be
abolished: “The conditions
under which the veto may be
used cannot be changed while
the present Charter exists; and
the present Charter cannot be
changed while • the veto exists
and the Soviets stand ready to
use it.” One exit from this
impasse which has been fre-
quently suggested—changing the
Charter even at the cost of
changing U.N.O.’s universal
character—Armstrong dismisses
as a counsel of despair.
His more constructive pro-
posal—admitting that working
international co-operation is
both vitally essential and possible
—is for “members who are un-
happy over the deficiencies of the
present U.N. procedure to under-
take that they themselves will
carry out the obligation to resist
aggression even beyond the point
when a veto prevents the
Security Council from telling
them that they must. Thus they
will bring into being, formally
and at once, the coalition of
loyal members which has always
existed in embryo” ; a “coalition
for peace” open to all members,
though “only those who are will-
ing to prepare seriously for col-
lective action against aggression
will join.”
Armstrong suggests there
should be an extremely simple
protocol, under which, when the
danger-point was reached, action
would be prompt and unham-
pered: “The protocol would of
coprse make clear that it in no
respect impairs the signatories’
rights and obligations under the
Charter. It could state that the
Governments concerned look on
the United Nations as a living
organism and are confident that
in time it will develop capacities
of its own to enforce its prin-
ciples and purposes the
Charter laid down minimum not
maximum obligations of mem-
bership ; nations which are will-
ing to increase the efficacy of
their undertakings on behalf of,
peace and security are free to do
so.”
The voting for action in final
case of need would be on a
majority basis, preventing any
Soviet veto-obstruction should
Russia join, as it could if it
wished.
Regarding “the mechanism for
enforcement,” Armstrong sug-
gests that the signatories would
need to begin discussions at
once: “They should allocate to
a military staff composed of
representatives of the principal
military Powers concerned the
same forces and facilities [bases
and the like] which they would
have allocated to the Military
Staff Committee of the United
Nations if that body had been
permitted to function.”
As to the basis of membership
in this new body, Armstrong
argues for a much wider or-
ganisation than the already exist-
ing Western European defence
group set up under the Brussels
Pact. This group, he points out,
has various interests restricted to
its present members, as well as
its omitting “many democratic
European nations which are
menaced by aggression, among
them some for whose safety the
United States feels particular
concern. Several of these —Eire,
Portugal, Austria and Finland —
are not members of the United
Nations because Russia vetoed
their applications; another,
Switzerland, did not apply for
membership, more because she
did not wish to court a Soviet
veto than because she is un-
willing to reconsider her tradi-
tional neutrality.”
As well as the other Western
European countries not included
under the Brussels Pact,
“Nations on the periphery of the
Continent like Greece and
Turkey, where we [United
States] are spending great sums
of money in an effort to increase
their capacity for self-defence,
would come into a broad
arrangement more naturally than
into a group centring on the
Atlantic. The psychological
effect of our course of action in
Eastern Europe must also be
considered. Nations under
Soviet domination cannot at
present be expected to join ; but
it would be an error for us to
exclude them even by implica-
tion.”
Regarding Britain, Armstrong
contends that “Commonwealth
solidarity might be better pro-
tected if Britain, having decided
that she must enter into a
special defensive pact, assumed
her new obligations on a general
rather than a regional basis.”
Dominions doubtful about the
Brussels arrangement might will-
ingly support the more general
coalition: “The Brussels Pact is
a valuable achievement in itself,
and signalises a rapprochement
among certain States which are
a necessary part of a wider de-
fence arrangement. But from
the American viewpoint, and in
the eyes of various other States,
including some that belong to it
as well as some that do not, it
does not provide a satisfactory
basis for the additional security
measures that the present world
crisis seems to demand.”
Armstrong sums up his pro-
posal: “A general pact open to
all United Nations members will-
ing to accept its specific obliga-
tions, and entered into from the
start by the most powerful mem-
—Milwaukee ( U.S.A .) “Journal.”
ELEMENTARY GEOGRAPHY.
(Henry A. Wallace: “The Russian problem is just a question of geography.”)
bers of the Brussels Pact and the
organisation of American States
[countries], would achieve all
that a limited security pact could
achieve, and much more besides.
It would be evidence that among
some of the strongest members
of the United Nations there was
a new determination to make the
Charter come alive in its full
integrity. It would not merely
underwrite the safety of those
brave enough to risk something
in order to gain more for them-
selves ; the same act would
underwrite the United Nations
itself.”
Bespectacled Britons.
Most remarkable phenomenon
resulting from Britain’s give-
away Health Act so far noted
has been the huge rush for free
spectacles.
The “Lancet” has reported
that, whereas before the start of
the new service the output of
spectacles from all sources was
between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000
a year, the present demand is at
the rate of nearly 8,000,000 a
year.
The “Lancet” gives the almost
incredible figure of 40 per cent,
of the population not merely
seeking but actually requiring
some aid to vision,
“A few,” London “Times”
has stated, “are asking to have
their eyes tested to get some-
thing for their contributions and
some merely because the service
is free. Nevertheless, no more
than 10 per cent, of those
applying for testing have been
found not to require spectacles.”
Nationalising Mania.
Alfred Edwards, M.P., the
British Labor member who some
time back got into severe strife
with his party for openly oppos-
ing its steel-nationalising pro-
posals, has spilt a tidy hatful of
beans in a London “Times”
letter, in which he declares that
his experience “among honest
Socialist colleagues in the
House of Commons is that few
now subscribe to the dogma
that nationalisation is essential
to Socialism.”
The majority in Britain’s
Socialist Cabinet, Edwards
states, “have grave doubts
about the wisdom of nationalis-
ing steel.” Also, “No industry
so far nationalised is able to
get along without substantial
subsidy.”
Because of the direct enhance-
ment of prices, he points out, in-
creasing costs are being passed
to the consumer. “The result is
seen in the rising cost of living
and the consequent demands for
higher wages—which again in-
crease production costs and
necessitate further subsidy or
higher prices, or both.”
Stating further that “The
nationalised industries are be-
coming a burden on the com-
munity,” Edwards declares that
“The claim that Socialism really
had a plan for organising in-
dustry has been proved false
lf steel were reduced by
bureaucracy to the pauper level
of the other nationalised in-
dustries the workers would stand
to lose all they have gained in
improved social services. If this
were fully realised there would
be a more effective drive for in-
creased production and less in-
clination to tamper with any
section of industry where output
is high and increasing.
“There might be some move
to end this unhappy state of
affairs if only one member of
the present Government had
business experience. Certainly
no businessman in the Socialist
party agrees with the proposal to
nationalise steel. They are all
most unhappy about it, and even
those with no business experi-
ence show signs of increasing
uneasiness. There is a growing
realisation that ‘the rich’ are no
longer rich and can be ‘soaked’
no more; but the persistent
minority still imagines that the
country can be saved by another
dose of the nationalisation
dogma.
“In this situation the welfare
of the nation becomes the
responsibility of the practical
men ofybusiness. They have to
point and repoint the disasters
that have already overtaken the
industries transferred to the
State, In none of them is any
hope held out that the losses
are only temporary. The pros-
pect in all is increasing costs
and, probably, declining produc-
tion. Should steel go down to
the same disaster this country
would be finished and 46,000,000
of us would go down with it in
penury.”
U.S.-Israel.
Former Chief Rabbi of Ber-
lin, Dr. Leo S. Baeck, is re-
ported in N. Y. “Post” as stat-
ing that the centre of “Jewish
life and studies” has shifted
from Europe to America.
“I would say,” he added,
“that now there are two centres,
Palestine and the U.S., and the
currents are strong between
them. I cannot see a future for
Judaism without Israel, but
neither can I see such a future
without the U.S.”
Dr. Baeck is at least one
who would not be gulled by the
current Soviet pretence of cham-
pioning Israel against U.S.-
Britain in U.N.O. He gave the
remarkable figure of about
5,500,000 Jews now in Russia,
“about the same there as there
are here in the U.S.” But
Russia, he added, “is a serfdom,
not free like the United States,”
and though Jews are permitted
to go to synagogues in Russia
Zionism is prohibited there.
U.S. Needs Japs.
Back in the U.S. from com-
manding the American occupa-
tion troops inr Japan for three
years, Lieut.-General Robert L.
Eichelberger, addressing the
National Safety Council, de-
clared that the “United States
faces potential defeat in any
future Pacific war if Russian
Communists gain control of the
Japanese islands.”
Because the U.S. disarmed the
Japs, he said, it now had the
obligation to protect them:
“Russia, as a result of the Allied
victory in the Pacific, received as
a reward the strategic, as well as
the geographical, aspirations of
150 years. Except for a part of

Korea, Communistic countries
control the Asiatic mainland to
the north, and if Japan were to
become Communistic and
thereby be added to the chain of
the Kurile Islands the Japan Sea
would become a Communistic
lake,
“One can appreciate what a
great prize Japan would be to
the Communistic nations if they
were permitted to gain'posses-
sion. But to the United States,
Canada, the Philippines and
Australia, it would signify the
loss of World War II and a
potential defeat in the Pacific in
any future war that might be
forced upon us.”
He urged the forgetting of
past cruelties of the Japanese
military party and acceptance of
“the Japanese as they are now,
potentially a powerful friend.”
China Dilemma.
Recent reports in cables of a
wide difference in U.S.-British
policies in China, with that of
Britain based on doing business
with the spreading Communist
side, could be supported by
quite a lot of reports and com-
ments in London “Times” over
the past year or two upholding
the view that Chinese Com-
munists are different from other
Corns.
Capable American corres-
pondents who have been in the
Chinese Communist territories
have ridiculed that view, and it
certainly did not get much sup-
port from a recent official
Chinese Communist broadcast,
which called for “an anti-
imperialist united front headed
by the Soviet Union.”
Reported in N. Y. “Times,”
the broa’dcast scoffed at the idea
of any “middle road” or “third
road” between Communism and
capitalism as “utter, hypocrisy
and thorough bankruptcy.” It
further stated; “The particular
task of the Chinese Communists
is to unite all revolutionary
forces within the whole country
to drive out the aggressive forces
of American imperialism, over-
throw the reactionary rule of the
Kuomintang [Chinese Govern-
ment party] and establish a uni-
fied Democratic People’s Re-
public.”
The public and official view
in America is that the Chinese
Communists are just what that
broadcast indicates; but ever
since the Marshall report on
China —which amounted to the
utterance of “a plague on both
your houses” —American policy
has practically been to let them
fight it out and trust to luck. At
any rate, America has done
nothing approaching adequacy
to help Chiang Kai-shek, and the
present evidently accepted view
is that given by a correspondent
of N. Y, “Herald Tribune”;
“Today it is amply clear that
American aid in its present
volume is incapable of stem-
ming the Communist advance.
Even a more positive American-
aid policy toward the Nationalist
regime would stand little chance
of success unless accompanied
by new and inspired Chinese
leadership and American advice
and supervision amounting
almost to control.
“Obstacles to such a course
are formidable. It would an-
tagonise a large segment of the
Chinese public—ever sensitive to
any infringement of Chinese
sovereignty. It might goad
Russia into more active support
of the Chinese Communists. It
would involve the United States
in a mammoth and expensive
gamble.”
On the outlook of the Chinese,
the “Herald Tribune” Peiping
correspondent sees “a multi-
tude of signs” that the majority
of China’s war-weary people
would welcome a negotiated
peace, “even if it meant a con-
siderable measure of Communist
control, as it undoubtedly
would.”
Also, “It is extraordinary how
the Chinese people’s attitude to-
ward the Communists has
moderated during the last year.
This is not to say that the people
of Nationalist China have be-
come pro-Communist. It means,
rather, that they are more anti-
Government, and are tired with
military reverses and economic
distress
“Moreover the new modera-
Moreover, me new mouera
tion in Communist policy has
softened the old fears and
hatreds. The word has got
around that the Communists are
now taking a tolerant attitude
toward private business, small
landlords and most Nationalist
officials. To what extent this line

ing the public mind for Com-
munist or coalition rule.
“Even foreign [including, pre-
sumably, British] businessmen
are now frequently heard to say
that perhaps the Chinese Com-
munists are not such bad fel-
lows after all, perhaps they will
permit foreigners to do business
as of old, perhaps they are a
different breed from the people
in Moscow.”
The upshot is a very awkward
dilemma for Uncle Sam, with
the knowledge that, on the one
hand, “American policy would
be more popular in China if it
were directed toward encourag-
ing coalition government rather
than supporting an unpopular
regime in continued civil war,”
but, on the other hand, that
“however mild the policies of
such a coalition, and however
efficient its operation, it is evi-
dent that it would be Com-
munist-dominated, with all the
hazards that implies.”
H.C. of Do-gooding.
One of these days Uncle Sam
is going to clamp down hard on
the high cost t of belonging to a
whole host of what Americans
call do-gooding concerns, which
at present are setting U.S. tax-
payers back $109,616,644 a
year.
Including U.N.0., Uncle Sam
is in no fewer than 45 inter-
national organisations, and, as
noted in a report on the cost, is
bearing the lion’s share of the
expense (the share the Lion once
would have borne). The report
shows that “percentages contri-
buted by member countries are
based on capacity to pay,”
which makes its own comment
on Uncle Sam’s flourishing con-
dition, and a further wry com-
ment on that prosperity after
two wars which just about
busted J. Bull.
The warning that Uncle isn’t
overlooking the cost of the do-
gooding business is conveyed by
the report, which, drawn up
by a U.S. Senate committee,
suggests that every effort should
be made by international or-
ganisations “to make the most
efficient use of the funds at their
disposal.” Adding that the
budgets of these organisations
“should be kept at the mini-
mum,” the report indicated one
especially lush locality where a
bit of pruning would be in
order; ,
“Although United Nations
salary scales range from annual
net salaries of $l5BO to $lO,OOO
a year, United Nations em-
ployees are at present receiving
approximately nine different
types of allowances in addition
to their regular salaries or wages,
as well as reimbursement for'
national income taxes.”
War-crime Doubts.
As expressed by a London
“Times” letter-writer, pointing
to “two acts by opposing com-
manders” ;
“The first, which, according
to the minds of those people
who press for these [war-crimes]
trials, merits the sentence of
death, is that of the German
commander who, for the pur-
poses of military security,
punishes and makes an example
of an Italian village, which has
helped anti-German partisans,
by destroying the population, in-
nocent and guilty alike.
“The second, which, accord-
ing to the same minds, is to be
considered only as a painful
necessity, is that of the leaders
of the Allied cause in permitting,
for the purposes of military ex-
pediency, the dropping of the
atomic bomb, the use of which,
it was known, would mean the
destruction of large numbers of
innocent people.
“Both are horrifying expedi-
ents and both are the products
of modern war. It is, however,
unjust to try the perpetrator of
one act without trying the
perpetrators of the other, and,
in my submission, the interests
of peace, justice and Christian
ethics all call for the trial of
neither.”
Elephant Surplus.
Noting the dire effect on
India’s elephant market of
princes’ purses being slashed,
a correspondent of N. Y.
“Times” has reported that any-
one can buy a jumbo for as
little as $6O from any of the
maharajahs, who, under the new
Indian democracy, have had to
cut their living standards.
Even at that bargain-price it’s
hard to find takers, and the
Indian States Ministry is con-
sidering advertising or approach-
ing circuses, rich maharajahs
and other outlets. Nature of the
“other outlets” is not stated, but,
as everything from rabbit to
whale has been used to ease the
world food shortage, handy-
sized tins labelled Elephant en
aspic may yet appear on the
market.
Along with elephants there’s
a slight surplus of princes. Some
have sold-up their expensive
palaces or transferred them to
State Governments, which, with
such excellent addresses for it,
have promptly gone into the
hotel business. Other princes
are looking for jobs, while many
of the younger ones will be
trained for foreign service.
The general set-up is that
princes can no longer dip into
State funds, and only those with
sufficient personal wealth can
afford such items as palaces,
dancing girls, court musicians—
and elephants.
The Nizam of Hyderabad,
one prince who can afford prac-
tically anything, is, unfor-
tunately for the homeless ele-
phants, not given to extrava-
gance. It seems that the popular
story that the Nizam uses a
massive diamond for a paper-
weight is utterly false. The
weight is only an emerald.
Dragnet Digest.
U.S. Isolationists Outed. —Washing-
ton “Post” has reported one little-
noted but significant aspect of the
U.S. elections: that about a third
of the Republicans in Congress who
voted against the Marshall Plan when
it was last up for consideration bit
the dust. “The latest list of defeated
Senators and Representatives showed
that isolationists were routed more
decisively than in any elections since
before the war.”

The Ladies for Truman. From
underneath the broken limb, whereon
he erstwhile cavorted with most glee-
ful anticipation of a Truman wash-
out, John O’Donpell, in N. Y. “Daily
News,” regretfully tells how it was the
women that did it all: “The distaff
side of the electorate gave Gov.
Dewey the works. At least, that is
what the political brain-trusters tell
us. Why this happened we don’t pre-
tend to know. We wouldn’t even dare
to guess. But there it is. It’s more
than the so-called housewife vote of
angry protest against family food
costs and lack of housing for which
the Republicans were given a blanket
damnation. This was a matter of
emotion and/or imagination and/or
intuition—factors that we must re-
gretfully report are more potent than
intelligence when the hand that rocks
the cradle pulls the lever in a polling
booth.”

U.S. Stock-piling. One probable
outcome of Truman’s election noted
by “U.S. News and World Report”
is that stock-piling of “strategic
materials” by the U.S. is likely to be
speeded up, leading the new Congress
to be “more generous with stock-
piling dollars,” to the benefit of the
British, French and Dutch Empires,
as well as Latin America. The same
well-informed source expects the allot-
ment of new money needed for the
European Recovery Programme —■
$1,200,000,000 —“will go through early
next year without much fuss.”

Down on Polls. Latest air-mails
show U.S. “public-opinion” polls
still taking a whale of a belting, being
lambasted by the scribes for mis-
leading both them and the voters.
Thus, George E. Sokolsky, typically,
in N. Y. “Sun”: “Obviously, the
polls lulled the Republicans into false
security; they were too sure of them-
selves; many of them did not even
come out to vote.” But that could
surely cut the other way. The polls
were so absolutely certain of a Dewey
victory and so emphatic about it that
they might well have influenced many
Democrat voters that it would be a
waste of time going to the polls for
their supposedly doomed man.

Polls in Britain. In London
as well as in the U.S. public-opinion
polls have been taking it, with the
“Times” correspondence columns a
leading arena. One of the writers
there who see reason for “welcoming
the fallen status” of the polls con-
tends: “The theory of the poll is
that a highly-accurate estimate of the
opinions of the nation at large can
be legitimately inferred from a know-
ledge of the opinions of a tiny sample,
representative so far as income, occu-
pation, age, religion, sex, etc., are
concerned. It assumes, in other words,
that we do not determine our own
opinions, but have them determined
for us by the external conditions in
which we happen to find ourselves.
And it is reassuring to see this dis-
turbing assumption unverified.”
* * * *
Too-technical Universities. Mr.
Churchill back at an old address, at
Harrow: “I am terrified at the idea
that our universities should become
technical schools where every form
of material proficiency should be
imparted in the different grades and
where the great studies of the
Humanities should drop away. It
will be a great tragedy if we should
cast the classics aside.” By “classics”
he was referring especially to Latin
and Greek.
* * * *
Supreme Act of Faith. —Noted by
a London “Times” correspondent in
a general review of U.N.O. carrying
on (in one sense and another of the
term) in Paris: “By and large,
observers who have been in the
closest contact with the United
Nations are tempted to explain its
survival as an act of faith by the
democratic Powers in the eventual
abandonment by the Soviet Union of
its design to accomplish their de-
struction.”

The Brabazon Plane. Reporting
that Britain’s largest land-plane air-
liner, the 127-ton, eight-engined
Bristol Brabazon, is now structurally
complete, London “Times” says it’s
designed to carry 100 passengers non-
stop from London to New York,
necessitating the carriage of 13,500
gallons of fuel. Features of it in-
clude a “unique engine installation,
consisting of coupled Centaurus,” six
alternators with an electric-power out-
put “sufficient to supply the needs
of a small town,” and almost 150
miles of electric cable. It’s expected
to be ready for flight trials about
March.


BURNING OFF
By
HELEN
MEGES
/"| UNT EMILY was always inviting
/j me to Rock Mountain. “And come
| in autumn,” she would say. “It is
so pretty then.” So towards the
end of March I found myself in the rather
battered Rock Mountain bus, leaning
back against the hard leather, and indulg-
ing in pleasajit day-dreams; lying in a
hammock under the tall golden poplars,
watching birds and wallabies in the bush,
or floating lazily in the placid, if some-
what muddy, dam.
And that’s just the way it was, the first
day, I had a swim in the dam, then 1
took a book under the poplars, and after
lunch I took my camera into Uncle Jim’s
10-acre block of uncleared bush and
managed to snap a wallaby, staring with
soft-eyed surprise at me over a log.
When I went in to dinner Uncle Jim
was back from town, where he had been
to take down a load of timber.
‘‘ | SEE you’ve cut quite a lot of trees
I since I was here last,” I said as we
sat down.
“Yair,” replied Uncle Jim,
“Reckon the logs I took down today’ll
be the last, though. I’ve got just about
everything worth while outer that there
block.”
“Oh, well,” I said philosophically.
“Some of the larger of the ones still there
should be worth a bit in another five
years.”
“Huh!” was all Uncle Jim said.
“I hope we won’t be here in anoiher
five years,” said Aunt Emily. “This place
is all right at this time of the year, if
there’s no fires about and the snakes
aren’t too bad, though the flies are always
awful, but in winter it’s always rain, rain,
rain and mud up to your knees all the
time. It gets me down something awful.”
“When did you have a bushfire in your
trees last?” I asked. “I noticed a good
many had been killed.”
“Huh?” Uncle Jim looked puzzled as
he shovelled in a huge mouthful of
corned beef. “We ’aven’t ’ad any bush-
fires ’ere since 1939. Two or three years
ago I put a fire through that block meself,
but it wasn’t a bushfire. Just burnin’ orf,”
“Oh,” I said. “It must have been a
pretty fierce blaze judging by the tall
trees that were killed,”
“Aw, I dunno,” mumbled Uncle Jim,
through half a potato. “Didn’t do no
’arm. One or two big fellas looked as
though they was dead, so I cut ’em
straight away. The fire did get away in
the end, though. Burnt a few of me own
fence-posts and got into Ted Angus’s cow-
paddock and burnt a lot of ’is grass.”
“Was Ted Angus annoyed?” I asked.
“Aw, no,” sighed Uncle Jim, as he
spread his knife and fork across his plate
to indicate that he had finished that
course. “’E knew it was an accident.
’E ’elped me put in new fence-posts, an’
I let ’is cow come an’ eat the weeds down
on the paddock that I wasn’t using that
year. Trouble was I should ’a’ burnt orf
that scrub sooner. It was too thick. Time
I did it again now.”
I was horrified at this suggestion,
“But is it in any danger?” I asked.
“It’s an island block, so how can a fire
get either into it or out of it accidentally?”
“A grassfire might get into it,” said
Uncle Jim, “same as it got out into the
grass.”
1 ‘ D UT the only grass is on the south
I—' side,” I pointed out. “There’s a
road and ploughed land on the other
sides, and a south wind usually brings
rain and cool weather.”
“Yair,” agreed Uncle Jim vaguely.
“Anyway, it needs burnin’ orf, ’Asn’t
been done for three years.”
I made one last attempt to save what
had seemed to me such an attractive little
piece of real Victorian bush.
“But how can the young trees ever
grow if you keep burning them down?”
I protested. “There are millions of young
mountain ash, messmate and bluegum
seedlings coming up all over the place in
there.”
“Yair?” said Uncle Jim, digging his
spoon into a large slab of steamed pud-
ding. “What’s the use of seedlings? You
can’t sell ’em. I don’t know one from the
other meself.”
I looked at him incredulously. But I
soon realised that Uncle Jim, although
he had lived at Rock Mountain all his
life, knew very little about trees, apart
from the technicalities of cutting them
down and selling them. In Uncle Jim’s
mind native trees were divided into three
categories: Large, sound trees provided
by a kind Providence for man to fell and
sell; fully-grown but rotten or imperfect
trees, to be ignored ; and seedlings and
saplings, to be treated as inflammable
rubbish and burnt.
My final remark, to the effect that the
fire-prohibition period had not yet ended,
met with the information that it would
end that night, and that next day I could
help him with the “burnin’ orf” if I
liked.
AN ominous north wind was already
blowing when I got up next morning,
but “Can’t do no ’arm” was Uncle Jim’s
verdict. So we set off, Uncle Jim lightly
armed with a box of matches. I took a
fern-hook and hoped for the best.
“I got a photo, of a wallaby in there
yesterday,” I remarked, pointing.
“Did y’?” Uncle Jim marvelled. He
cogitated for a time, “Pity I didn’t bring
me gun.”
We lit about 14 fires along the south
edge of the trees so that the fire would
burn back against the wind, and immedi-
ately had to set to work beating out grass-
fires around the potato : paddock fence-
posts. By the time we had them all safe
the fire was roaring away merrily on a
solid quarter-mile front, but just moving
steadily, owing to the north wind blowing
it back all the time.
There wasn’t much to do but stand and
watch, and at eleven o’clock we left it to
go inside for a cup of tea.
When we came back the wind had
changed to north-west and part of the
fire had got away through Uncle Jim’s
east fence into Ted Angus’s cow-paddock
again.
We scrambled through the fence (of
which two posts were already ablaze), and
spent the next hour beating back the
grass-fire while Ted got out his plough
and ploughed a break around his hay-
stack. Then he ploughed a break across
the paddock so the lire could go no
further, and we all went off to lunch. I
marvelled at Ted Angus’s philosophical
attitude, but Uncle Jim seemed to think
he had no cause for complaint.
“’E can’t talk,” said Uncle Jim. “ ’E’s
a real firebug ’imself. Always settin’
somebody’s fence alight. Nearly burnt
down ’is own ’ouse last summer.”
The ten-acre block was now just a
smoking ruin, with not more than fifty
green heads showing through the smoke.
“She’ll be safe fer another coupla
years now,” remarked Uncle Jim with
satisfaction.
“Safe from what?” I asked rather
bitterly. “Timber thieves?”
This piece of impertinence was passed
over in silence.
SUDDENLY Aunt Emily leaped from
her chair and pointed dramatically
through the window.
“Look! ” she cried. “That fool Ted
Angus lighting the park on a day like
this! ”
Ted Angus was sauntering across the
road, and just behind him, on the south
side of the road, a flame shot up through
the bracken. Uncle Jim responded with
an extraordinary burst of profanity. “I
said ’e was a firebug!” he panted as
we rushed towards the flames. I still had
my fern-hook, and Uncle Jim had paused
to seize a gum-bough.
The wind had veered again to due
north and was blowing about 50 miles an
hour, so the fire had spread over several
hundred square yards before we could
get there, and the undergrowth was so
thick we couldn’t get to the other side to
stop it.
A snake shot out from under a log and
wriggled right between my feet. After a
leap into the air which any Australian
Rules footballer might have envied I
quickly destroyed the snake, and then
looked around to see what Uncle Jim
was doing.
He was quietly rolling himself a
cigarette and gazing at the blaze thought-
fully.
ti ED ECKON we’ll ’ave to get the
brigade out fer this,” he , said
finally. “We can’t do much with it on
our own.”
I was pleasantly surprised at this dis-
play of civic interest, as I didn’t suppose
he would have considered the park any
of his concern. But his next remark dis-
pelled my illusions.
“The fire’s ’eading straight fer Dick’s
place,” he explained. “So you better go
an’ warn ’im an’ Mary while I go an’
get me truck out an’ rustle up the
brigade.”
I remembered then that Uncle Jim’s
younger brother Dick had married since
my last visit and had built a home on the
far side of the park.
The park consisted of forty acres of
natural forest with a lookout command-
ing a magnificent view, a picnic-shelter

{Who drowned herself in the Derwent .]
Put off my shoes. Early the wind was
sighing
About these rushes where the black
swans come no longer,
Where freezes the clod of earth hard as
my frosty heart.
Where the plover calls over the darkening
water, and the rattling cart
And the dog follow each Other into the
dusk.
Put off my shoes. I have had eighteen
years
Of other people’s living, but now I shall
Make death my own. No more to care
Whose shadows pass beside me on the
wall
Walking together. No more of anything
But dark, and dropping like a stone
Into the green and dark, and lying still
Except to swing a little, this way that
way
Among the weeds, at evening, on the tide.
Come walk with me on any Sunday morn-
ing
And I will show you the landscape of
my death . . .
The township huddling in the watching
hills
And the blind windows of the single street
Hiding the BraslinsNewtons, Cockerills,
Lees,
My other limbs, as hawthorn hides the
wire;
And by the river the threaded dipping
gold
Of oak and willow, weed and blackberry,
The place of grass, where love and I
would lie,
The faceless love, who lies no more with
me.
I see the shape of all the river now
To the full sea, and all that lies below
And how the naked rock cradles its flow,
And how I shall lie under, caught in the
sedge.
Search for me under this gentle tree, close,
close by the green edge.
I will not be far from my harsh home
love, when you look for me.
Put off my shoes, put off my little shoes
I was a poor silly girl who drowned her-
self
But they’ll not let me lie in those cold
waters.
They’ll bury me shallow and high
In the graveyard over the river,
Young, dead, dry.

VARIOUS
VERSE
The Hidden Fear.
It is so small
You hardly know it’s there at all —
Hidden like seed under dead leaves,
The dry stubble beneath heaped sheaves.
Dead yet living,
Intent on its own form of insidious giving,
Working unconsciously beneath the con-
scious-thought,
Appearing to mock when least expected
or sought;
With a slow friction
Building a solid, rock-enforced conviction
That will later color the whole vision of
life,
Destroying the careful structure with
recurring waves of strife —
How from the upper level
Reach down into hell and grasp this
elusive devil
Building a citadel deep down below the
will
Whose towers shall pierce and crumble
the sunlit hill ?

When diesel craft defy the harbor bars
To make the treacherous passage to the

His water-keg, as I might hold a fin
As trophy of the season’s finest haul.

Content with lesser harvests by the shore.

What madness called me from the timber

From the Outer Rock, the pines of

Spill their green lode between the dust-

And certain fortune hides in their

Remember from their masts the green-
plumed sea,
And the curving shoreline like a hovering
wing.
See how the wind-shoals feed among the
hills
Finning with songs of wonder, even such
As I long heard, yet swiftly found untrue,
With themes discordant, on this fretful
boat
That knows no rest, though cradled by
the sea.

There were no women on the rock, only
the singing ,
Choired by the wind out of the staves of

O fierce, white tide and high that steeps
the mind
In wordless floods! What curving thighs
are these
Each wave disports upon the Outer
Rock ?
What coverlets of green, what silken
skies ?
Ulysses lied; there were no women on the
rock,
And yet 1 heard the song that crazed his
eyes
And saw the sunlight darkening the wave.
Faint from the skyline’s hinge begin to
turn
The last bright pages of receding day.
The painted rock, Ulysses’ ship, pass by
And flash their gilded edges in the mind
Where, though the binding night may seal
them down,
Their flaring wake for ever scars my
dream.

CITIZEN STATUS.
About two years ago the Dutch pleni-
potentiaries in N.E.I. arranged with the
Javanese “republic” a form of consti-
tutional settlement—still halting—which
recognised the “republic” as one element
in a proposed Indonesian federation
(“the United States of Indonesia”), and
that, in turn, as one region of the
Netherlands Kingdom. This was gener-
ally regarded as an effort to make the
best of a bad job, albeit an incongruous
patchwork of every known pattern of
democratic self-government. Many critics
poked fun at it.
“British subjects,” to use the nomen-
clature of Mr. Cal well’s Nationality and
Citizenship Act, in Australia and all
other countries of what was formerly the
British Empire, must henceforth smile
(if they do smile) on the other side of
their faces. Mr, Calwell’s legislation is
identical with that of the brother-
Socialist Government in London, which
considered itself obliged, along with
other British (delete “British”) Common-
wealth Governments at the 1947. Im-
perial (delete “Imperial”) Conference, to
follow a Canadian lead of 1946. It is the
counterpart of the principal decisions at
these “informal discussions” (as the said
conference preferred them to be called)
to change the style, the form and (as
under the Nationality Act) even the
qualifications for membership of what is
now being called “the Third British Em-
pire”—henceforth to float along with a
constitution that makes the Netherlands
Indies arrangement look positively
simple and streamlined.
For the King’s realm (if that phrase
be still permissible) is hereafter to be
called “The Commonwealth.” It will be
an association of “Dominions” (a word
also on the way out), republics and aspirant
republics, federations, unions and even
one “foreign” State—turned foreign “in
order to remain friends,” the Southern
Irish Minister for External Affairs
asserts —all acknowledging some connec-
tion of political value with the former
centre of the Empire, the now half-
socialised United Kingdom. Only in that
commercial interest, Empire trade prefer-
ence, does the title “Empire” remain.
“British” is not quite ruled out, for the
world is large and unrestful, and the
right to call oneself “a British subject” is
still worth something. And as for com-
position, the new Commonwealth will
contain three categories of “British sub-
jects”—namely, those who are such by
right, those (honorary) who may wish
to be, and those who nominally refuse
to be.
Unbeknown beforehand to himself or
herself, every Australian will learn from
the clause which is the core of the
Chifley Government’s Nationality Act
that he or she is no longer a British sub-
ject first and foremost:
7. (1) A person who, under this Act, is
an Australian citizen or, by am enactment
for the time being in force in a country to
which this section applies, is a citizen of
that country, shall, by virtue of that citizen-
ship, be a British subject.
(2) The countries to which this section
applies are the United Kingdom and
Colonies, Canada, New Zealand, the Union
of South Africa, Newfoundland, India,
Pakistan, Southern Rhodesia and Ceylon.
The motives for these changes in the
Empire’s structure are, of course, the re-
publican sentiments in Southern Ireland,
India and South Africa, Even so, Mr.
Chifley said during the debate on the
bill that “Australia must reluctantly ac-
cept the position—which it was Imped
would be only temporary—that Eire
could not now be regarded as a mem-
ber of the British Commonwealth” ; yet,
he added, Eire’s act in cutting the last
link with the Crown “could not be re-
garded as converting Eire’s status into
that of a foreign country.” Simul-
taneously the British Prime Minister
used almost identical terms in addressing
the House of Commons.
In the effort to please everybody
(which leaves a widespread and unhappy
expectation of the usual results), the Em-
pire, from being “a family of nations,”
is now to become a soft of club. If the
electors of the United Kingdom con-
sciously decided at the 1945 elec-
tions upon “the liquidation of the British
Empire”—which may be doubted —they
voted correctly for Attlee rather than
Churchill to preside over the business.
But Mr. Attlee’s apologists declare, per-
haps justly, that he could not help him-
self—that nothing could have kept India
and Burma in the old Empire, or have
maintained the British in Egypt or
Palestine, or have restored Britain’s over-
sea investments lost during the war, or
have saved the United Kingdom’s shat-
tered economy from absolute dependence
on financial aid from the United States.
But the line must be drawn somewhere,
and some of these Socialist excuses go
too far.
The best apology on behalf of the
Attlee Government that has so far ap-
peared is that of Mr. Francis Williams,
formerly editor of the London “Daily
Herald” and more recently First Ad-
viser on Public Relations to the Socialist
Prime Minister—a broadminded ob-
server who fcas just published a book,
Jhe Triple Challenge (Heinemann), in
pursuit of this purpose. Decisions
taken, he writes, “when a great empire
is in a state of flux.... .must affect the
balance of power among all nations,”
and “Britain faces the future with this
triple challenge”:
A challenge to former economic and
social concepts at a time when the whole
basis of her previous economic power has
suffered drastic and permanent amendment,
a challenge to former conceptions of im-
perialism at a time when vast and far-
reaching alterations in the pattern of the
British Commonwealth and Empire have
become historically necessary, a challenge
in the wide field of foreign affairs at a time
when her position as a Great Power is
superficially, at any rate, less durable than
at almost any'time of her history.
Mr. Williams does not explain why, with
the heart of the Empire in this parlous
state from war strain, it was necessary
for Britain to go in for a domestic revo-
lution which could be regarded only as
a risky experiment. He admits;
Here was a test of two vast and so far
unproven assumptions. The first is that a
planned socialist system is economically
more efficient than a private-enterprise
capitalist system; the second is that, within
democratic socialist planning, the individual
can be given a larger social justice, a greater
security and a more comple x freedom than
under capitalism....
In some other countries, in Australia
and New Zealand...;experiments are on a
laboratory scale. They cannot have the
world significance that the British experi-
ment has. The stakes are not high enough.
But in Britain they are as high as they
could conceivably be. If the experiment
succeeds the rewards will be enormous in
terms of human well-being and national
power. If it fails, the consequences may
be measureless.
So it is not altogether the force of post-
war conditions which has reduced the
British Empire to its present shifts but
partly the Socialist experiment at the
centre. Mr. Williams frankly puts the
widely-asked question, which for 290
subsequent pages he cannot satisfactorily
answer, or hope to answer except out of
wishful thinking:
Is Britain finished as a great Power and
the British revolution simply a fancy name
for the listless acceptance by her people of
the passing of former glory, with all the
consequences upon world history that such
a passing must have?
Attlee, Bevin, Cripps and Herbert
Morrison —and even some of the lesser
disposers in London of the Empire’s fate
—may be all, as Mr. Williams believes,
greater men than they appear. Demon-
strably these Socialists can ruin the Em-
pire, but can they restore its prestige in
the new form they contemplate? Mr.
Williams was present at all post-war
Commonwealth conferences in Mr.
Attlee’s Cabinet-room. He is convinced
that Empire trade preferences will not
escape relaxation along with other formal
Imperial links, and he believes that one
of the strongest links for the future will
be, not the Crown, but this very “Com-
monwealth citizenship” which the Cal-
well Act is concerned with. He seems to
overlook that we were all British sub-
jects, and, for practical purposes, British
citizens, too, before this Socialist plan-
ning was born or thought of, and his
chapter on “The Imperial Choice” up-
holds the old-fashioned creed that co-
operation for security in defence must
hold first place in the Empire by what-
ever name it may call itself, and that the
United Kingdom can no longer under-
take* the chief burden of defence as it
did 20 years ago.
Whither the “Third British Empire”
may be heading is, for this British apolo-
gist, a matter of, conjecture. There is
some fanciful stuff, of the Evatt brand,
about a possible “union of independent
States girdling the earth and which, it
may well be, others may wish to join”—
a sort of reorganised U.N.G. without a
veto, an alternative approach to the prob-
lem recently presented with the ques-
tion: Can Britain join in a Western
European Union and bring the
Dominions in, too?
Salvation for the future may lie in
that development, but an elder genera-
tion now passing out will not feel re-
assured by Mr. Williams’s hailing of the
new citizenship arrangement as a “sig-
nificant” step in the changing of the
British Commonwealth’s own structure.
One adjunct to the old-fashioned Imperial
idea co-reformers in Canberra cannot
afford to despise, and that is the White
Australia policy.
Could this be a nigger in the Socialist
woodpile?
We Should Begin at Home.
If the meeting of the Eastern Asiatic
Commission of the United Nations
serves any useful purpose it will be to
give the Australian taxpayer another
glimpses-of how his money is being
squandered by limelighting people like
Dr. Evatt and their colleagues in Can-
berra. It exhibits our own Government
in all its ignorance and incapacity.
Mr. Chifley and his colleagues cannot
even run a Cook’s tour, much less the
Commonwealth.
The Commission—ECAFE in the
horrible Germanised code - language
which was born of the Second World
War—will, however, be in its element
amid all the muddle which its hosts have
created for it. It is a body which has
no authority to do anything. And the
only nation represented from which even
the greatest optimist at Lapstone expects
any sort of material contribution—the
United States —has‘made it quite clear
that it will act on its own advice and not
on that of the representatives of . Babel*,
who have spent a busy week swapping
water-buffaloes and hurtling in a huge
fleet of Government cars, paid for by
ourselves, over the roads of the N.S.W.
Blue Mountains between breakfast and
debate.
There are 18 countries mixed up in
the conference, and a glimpse at the roll
of them is sufficient to provide evidence
that the British-speaking ones would be
well out of the arena, though it would
be too much to expect that Socialist Gov-
ernments like those of Canberra and
Westminster would overlook any chance
to meddle in business not their own or
miss any glint of limelight that was going.
The United States stands most im-
portant from the view of the Asiatic dele-
gates, since it is proposed that its
140,000,000 people, already generous
to a fault, should provide most of a cool
£2,200,000,000 to help, rehabilitate the
rest —nobody else could contribute effec-
tively. The noisiest delegates are, as
usual, the Russians and the Canberrans,
the latter represented at the first session
by Mr. McKell,' G.-G., and Mr. Dedman,
and later by Dr. Coombs, who has re-
cently been appointed governor of the
Commonwealth Bank mainly because
Socialist blood is still a little thicker than
water.
The Russians, represented by their late
High Commissioner to British India, M.
Novikov, and an army of secretaries, have,
of course, come only for the purpose of
causing as much disruption as possible
between the Asiatic members and the
United States and stirring up rebellion in
the British Commonwealth in order to
promote the completion of its dismember-
ment. Their main victim was little New
Zealand, which was accused of enslav-
ing the Maoris and whose- representative
was at a distinct disadvantage in reply-
ing, since he could not very well explain
publicly that the 100,000 native slaves of
M. Novikov’s imaginings actually hold
the balance of power in the Maoriland
Parliament and that but for the Fraser
Government’s barefaced purchase of the
Maori vote there would be no Fraser
Government.
For the rest, the whole boiling of
nations which are taking part in the con-
ference presents a chaotic picture. There
is China, which is in the throes of dissolu-
tion, its Administration completely de-
moralised. There is Russia, which comes
to a conference partly designed to pro-
mote the industrialisation of East Asia
with the grease of the vast quantity
of industrial assets which it recently
burgled from Manchuria still on its
hands. There is the Philippines, which
is supposed to be a free Republic, peace-
loving and democratic. It is actually a
large United States armed camp, fed and
clothed by United States subsidies, and
in which it is dangerous to travel from the
largest U.S. air base, Clarke Field, to
Manila, the capital (a matter of 60 miles),
at night for fear of being shot-up by
bandits.
There is Nepal, which is trying to feed
6,500,000 people on a mountain area
two-thirds the size of Victoria. ' There
are India and Pakistan, at veiled war with
each other and with the blood of tens of
thousands of each other’s slaughtered citi-
zens on their hands, countries slipping
back into Asiatic inertness and faced with
the problem of providing a future for
400,000,000 people, increasing at the rate
of 20,000,000 a year, in a territory which
even now provides only about half an
acre of food-producing land exclusive of
swamp, desert and uncultivable moun-
tain per head of population.
There is the Netherlands, which was
betrayed by its own well-tended Indo-
nesian citizens, sitting cheek-by-jowl
with our own delegates, whose Goverp-
ment assisted in the betrayal—to
“Labor’s” eternal shame —and there a
France and her “subject” areas, Carr
bodia and Laos —the “land of the mi
lion elephants”—which have becom
“countries” mainly through Japane
collaboration and assistance from th
Communists. There is Siam, which als
was a Japanese collaborator and whos
collaboration cost us many Au
tralian lives. And there is Ceylon
a new Dominion, formerly the strateg
centre of the Empire’s sea-routes, loya
to Britain but living close to India’s un
easy millions. Also there is Burma, whos
Parliament cannot meet except under th
protection of a ring of soldiers, anc
which provides the president of the con
ferenca in a ruler of one of the Sha
States, some of which were recently in
dulging in armed rebellion.
With the still-unstable Asiatic countrie
represented at Lapstone the Canberr
Government seems to consider itself in
tegral. Mr. McKell, who was Australia’
chief representative at the opening of th
conference, said that he hoped the Com
mission would “lay the basis of economi
co-operation between the East and th
West on terms of perfect equality.” Anc
it was evidence of the solemnity of th
occasion that there was no ironic
laughter from the gallery when —in the
presence of the British-Malayan delegate
—he hoped for the “development of con
crete plans to bring about the restora
tion t(f pre-war levels of agriculture and
mining” in the Ecafe area —an area in
which Australians who have been trying
to foster his ambition have been mur-
dered in cold blood by terrorists in the
last few months without the Australian
Government uttering a word which the
murderers need construe as anything
stronger than a faint- philosophic dis-
approval.
It seems time that the Commonwealth
Government developed some sense of
proportion. It is lecturing Asiatic people
on the need for early settlement of politi-
cal differences —that was Mr. Dedman’s
contribution—while in this country it is
promoting a miserable political class-war
which would have ended before this in
violence in most of the Asian countries
to which it is acting as tutor. It is in-
structing darker Asia in the processes of
rehabilitation while its own programme
is the laughing-stock of everybody who
observes it. It is lecturing them on the
need for individual freedom of thought
and action while trying to apply to its
own citizens abroad restrictions of move-
ment which must be unique outside
Russia.
It is obvious that involvement in the
politics of the “comity” of Asiatic
nations must presently bring us to the
point at which the Asian nations will
claim the right to interfere with our in-
ternal population policies, especially in
view of the delicate line which is being
trodden by Mr. Chifley’s emissaries, who
are proposing to help organise a new
life and plenty for what Mr. McKell
calls the “so-called overpopulated Asiatic
countries” —Japan has 500 to the square
mile, China, over large areas, 1000 to
the square mile, India 232 to the square
mile, while Australia has only 2.3 to the
square mile.
It seems that it would be much better
if Mr. McKell and his colleagues were
to set out to provide underpopulated
Australia with a regular supply of pota-
toes, which were recently unobtainable in
Sydney, and to assure that housewives
can buy a pound of beans or rump steak
for less than the daily wage of a skilled
mechanic in one of the richer countries
of the East Asiatic area.
Also, it would be more ■in keeping
with the normal canons of gratitude if,
instead of employing our zeal in half-
cocked and half-hearted “co-operation”
with people who may not thank us for it
and with whom we have little in common,
we devoted the whole of our energy not
needed for our own major tasks and to
getting Britain back on its feet —the
Britain which sent its navy to defend
us, which kept us functioning as an eco-
nomic unit with its mercantile marine
during the war, and which did not mur-
mur when we refused to allow our con-
scripts to cross the Equator to protect
Singapore, and to relieve Borneo and
Hong Kong, even though our own soldiers
were prisoners there. Rational Govern-
ments in any Asiatic country might also
consider that a strong Britain would be
of greater help to their democratic de-
velopment than the sophistical stunting
of Canberra Socialists and their represen-
tatives at Lapstone,
The future of the British Common-
wealth presents quite enough problems
without our pretending to solve those of
Darkest Asia for the advertisement of
Dr. Evatt and Mr. Dedman.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Victorian Mess-up.
Whatever chances there were of a
cordial coalition between the Victorian
Liberals under Mr. Hollway and the
Victorian Country party under Mr. Mc-
Donald after their resounding defeat of
“Labor” 13 months ago were probably
frustrated from the outset by the in-
fluence of Albert Dunstan in the Country
party. The fracture of relations between
the two parties last week occurred over
Mr. Hollway’s “lone-hand” settlement of
a threatened blackout of all Victorian
industry and transport; but what one
Liberal months ago called “a marriage of
inconvenience” had really been for some
time drifting towards divorce.
Knight Albert Dunstan was the evil
genius of the late Ministry. He could
not forget that he had been Premier for
10 years till 1945 and that during that
period he had contrived to use each of
the other parties in turn as his allies.
The only game of political cricket he
knows is one with three elevens in the
field; and although at the elections in
November last year his party was bitterly
hostile to “Labor,” he could not recover
from his surprise and resentment at the
outstanding preference of the electors for
the Liberals —particularly in many rural
seats.
It did not miss the Dunstan eye that
the Country party as a whole, though not
his own closer personal following
within it, could at a pinch still hold the
balance of power. By the middle of this
year the Melbourne press was reporting
that differences within the coalition,
which began with the formation of the
Ministry, had never been reconciled, and
that some Country-party men were
sounding-out possible “Labor” support
for a Country-party Cabinet, as in
Dunstan’s pre-war heyday.
These approaches did not make much
advance, because (1) the Country party
would have lost much “face,” and (2)
Mr. McDonald was apparently not ac-
ceptable to “Labor” as Premier. There
was thus a sort of rough justice in
Hollway’s refusal a few days ago to in-
clude Dunstan in a reformed Ministry.
Previously, at the beginning of June,
there had been earnest canvassing by
Liberal-party leaders in Victoria and
other States of the proposal for “com-
plete unity” between the Liberal and
Country parties, in Federal and State
spheres, for the Federal-election cam-
paign against the Socialists, Mr, Holl-
way offered to thrash out all differences
in Victorian politics at a joint party
meeting and to consider “any Cabinet
reorganisation that may be necessary.”
The Country-party response was so frosty
as to nip that offer in the bud.
The “Labor” Opposition in Victoria,
reduced to only a third of the numbers
of the other two parties combined, has
for months been working assiduously to
exploit the rift in the Government ranks
by playing on Country-party jealousies.
The toleration by C.P. members of these
palpably mischievous machinations has
finally broken the coalition, but cannot
fail to weaken their own party’s cohesion
also. “Labor” may consider that it can-
not emerge in worse condition than at
present from another election, but the
C.P. in such event may easily be the
chief loser. An election seems inevitable
in the new year unless the C.P,, or a
section of it, supports a new Hollway
Ministry with or without joining it.
The harm done by this stupid quarrel
is twofold. It must militate against the
Liberal-C.P. contest with the Socialists
at next year’s Federal elections; and it
must cause rejoicing among the Bolshies
in the unions, who are now informed that
they have but to provoke a proclama-
tion of the Essential Services Act, by
laying Victorian industry idle, in order
to smash a Liberal-C.P. Government
elected to restrain just such bushranging.
Eight months ago, while the shine was
still fresh on his portfolio as Deputy
Premier, Mr. McDonald declared at a
Victorian C.P. convention that “unless
the Government dealt effectively with
the menace of Communism the Country
party would not stay in the composite
Ministry.” He must have reflected
during this past week-end that he and
his party colleagues have made a pretty
mess of both his purpose and the only
means of achieving it.
An Australian Car.
The advent of the Australian-built Holden
car was attended with due ceremonial
in Melbourne last week. On the word
of the makers. General Motors-Holden’s,
it cost £B| million to bring the project to
fruition, and the car itself seems capable
of filling the Australian demand for a
medium - sized, economically - running
vehicle. Brief specifications:
Engine: 6-cylinder, o.h.v. Rating, 21.6
h.p., developing 60 b.h.p.
Petrol consumption: About 37 miles per
gallon from a tank.
Speed: Maximum, 80.5 m.p.h.
Gearbox: 3-speed selective, synchro-mesh
on second and top, with gear-lever on
steering-column.
Brakes: Four-wheel hydraulic.
Suspension: Front, independent, incor-
porating vertical coil springs. Rear, semi-
elliptic, in lubricated covers.
Dimensions: Wheelbase, 103 in.; overall
length, 172 in.; weight, 19cwt. 1021 b.;
height, just over sft. lfin.; width, sft. 6|in.
The Prime Minister said the right things
when he unveiled the Holden. He con-
gratulated the company on its initiative
and enterprise, added something about a
contribution to defence, and paid a
special tribute to the “humble workers”
without whom “the new car would have
been impossible.” It was all well-meant,
and it seems a pity to cast a cold eye on
it, but a eulogy of “enterprise” comes
strangely from the leader of a Govern-
ment which doesn’t believe in that sort of
thing, unless it is socialised enterprise.
Still, all Australia must feel happy
about the Holden and wish it every suc-
cess, though somewhat surprised both by
the enormous cost of the tooling-up pro-
cess and by the cost of the car itself. On
this latter point it seems that any illusions
about a vehicle which could be sold at a
price within the reach of the ordinary
salary- or wage-earner have been dis-
ALL OR NOTHING AT ALL.
"If I can’t get all my own way I’ll take the bat home."
pelled, though this is not the makers’
fault.
They expect to turn out 20,000 Holdens
a year. The more the better—and the
cheaper, perhaps, eventually. But anyone
who wants to put a new Holden on the
road now is up for about £750 all told.
A couple of years ago there was gossip
that it would cost between £4OO and £5OO.
The makers, however, were unable to state
a price until the last minute, obviously
because steadily spiralling costs brought
about by the shorter working week, lower
output per man per hour and constant
rises in wages, which in turn caused
similar increases in production costs,
prevented it. Some portion of that £Bi
million has to be got back, and selling-
price has to do that, cover present and
near-future cost increases and promise
the makers a profit of some sort.
The Holden strikingly emphasises to
Australians the point that if they are to
get high pay for shorter hours, and
follow the present habit of slow work and
strikes, they must expect to pay corres-
pondingly higher prices for goods. The
Holden could have been a popularly-
priced people’s car if all Australian in-
dustry had a better production record. It
may become that in the future. In the
meantime, the cumulative effects of the
Federal Government’s industrial policy
and the workers’ eagerness for more pay
though doing less have made it almost as
dear as a Chev. or a Ford on which
certain Customs duties have been paid.
The Holden venture deserves all the
support it can be given, by workers and
by the car-using public. Its appearance
is a definite mark in Australian manu-
facturing history, proving that Australian
brains and enterprise refuse to be over-
awed by external and internal obstacles.
What Does "Labor 11 Care?
Sentencing a parricide of 17 to im-
prisonment for life, Justice Herron said
“A great many crimes in this city of
Sydney are committed by youths.” A
dreadful truth, and it cannot be dissoci-
ated from the selfish and brutal spirit
produced by the politician- and paper-fed
craze for gambling, the staple -of con-
versation among too many of those youths
who think more of booze and betting
than they do of work and present or
future domestic responsibilities.
But what does “Labor” care? The
Herron judgment coincided with the
recommendation of “a sub-committee of
the State Parliamentary ‘Labor’ party”
that “the ‘Government’ should permit
greyhound and trotting meetings,” com-
plete with harpies, “on week nights.”
And there followed, within a few hours,
a “Labor” measure, the Racing (Amend-
ment) Bill, designed to make gambling a
greater craze than ever and whirled
through the Leg. Assembly in jig-time.
This latest example of “Labor’s” zeal
for the welfare of the toiling masses (or,
at least, those who do their toiling on
bookmakers’ stands and in s.p. shops)
“provides for 30 horseracing meetings a
year on the Newcastle racecourse
(hitherto 25),” and authorises the holding
of “mixed meetings” for gallopers and
trotters, with no specified limit, in dis-
tricts two hours by car and three hours
by train from Newcastle and Sydney, It
sanctions “the establishment” of “night
trotting, with betting” and a profusion of
new “dates”—4o, instead of 25, for New-
castle, 12 “instead of six” in places
beyond Newcastle and Sydney, and for
that city, it would seem, “an open go,”
restricted only by the chronic coal short-
age and the unpredictable blackout.
There are to be a Greyhound Racing
Control Board, comprised of seven mem-
bers “appointed by the Governor,” and
a grant of privilege to liars and others
appearing at “A.J.C. committee appeals,”
which are to be “open to the public.”
The implication being that attendance at
“A.J.C. committee appeals,” as well as
at places where gallopers and trotters
tear round tracks and tripehounds pur-
sue the tin hare, is, in a time of stag-
nant production, much more important
than work. Nor does the consumption
of coal in race-trains or the burning of
petrol by “sports” with cars (and, of
course, safe-deposits) seem to matter a
dump.
As for the possibility that the luckless
‘state of mind engendered by the mania
for gambling is a factor in “industrial
unrest”—well, no N.S.W. “Labor” poli-
tician ever concerns himself about that,
though Communists are exploiting the
mania for all they are worth.
Seven Years Afterwards.
Pearl Harbor, the seventh anniversary
of which was celebrated yesterday, will
always be a significant day in United
States history. It ought to be as signifi-
cant for Australia.
But how many Australians paused
yesterday to reflect on the staggering rush
of the Japanese down the Pacific seven
years ago? Within three months of the
raid on Pearl Harbor Singapore had
fallen, an Australian A.I.F. division was
lost, and Darwin was bombed. The
Japanese poured into Malaya, Burma, the
Netherlands Indies, the Philippines,
Borneo and New Guinea. Allied war-
ships vanished from seas they had ruled
for 300 years. Presently Derby, Wynd-
ham and Broome were bombed, epemy
submarines were sinking ships off the
N.S.W. coast, shelling Sydney and New-
castle, and penetrating Sydney Harbor.
It is true that generally the people stood
firm in the face of these disasters and
threats, but invasion was expected and
for a time it seemed that nothing could
stop it.
How it was stopped and the tide
eventually turned back is now history.
But the more closely that history is ex-
amined the more apparent it becomes
that we were lucky. Lucky in that the
Americans were able to get here in. time,
lucky in having seasoned naval, air and
land forces of our own whose numbers
were small but whose experience and
fighting qualities were great. The full
story of the Pacific War has yet to be
told; when it is Australians may be re-
minded again of how lucky they were.
Pearl Harbor, however, is also an an-
niversary of another sort. The crash of
Japanese bombs on Oahu on that morn-
ing seven years ago meant that Asia had
come out of a long doze. All that has
happened since has been of tremendous
importance to this, the only white coun-
try, with New Zealand, in a colored sea.
Mr. Calwell, the Minister for Immi-
gration, at least has some thoughts about
it. He told an audience in Melbourne
the other day that Japan was the only
Asiatic country he feared:
If she is built up again and then
embarks on a greater-prosperity venture,
seven and a half million Australians will
not be as fortunate as they were last time.
....Immigration must be a defence policy.
He added that under present plans Aus-
tralia would have 15 million people by
1980, “if the birthrate was maintained
and if migrants arrived at the rate of
70,000 a year.” If —if —if! And if immi-
gration is a “defence policy” it seems, on
the Government’s present performances,
to be the only defence policy.
A Government which, on the one hand,
encourages the people to believe that they
can enjoy high wages and comparatively
luxurious living standards without work-
ing for them, and on the other hand
professes to believe that it can defend
the country with a scratch team of volun-
teer regulars and part-time soldiers, must
be blind to the lessons of history, the
evidence of the present and the ominous
warnings of the future. And a people
which accepts that sort of Government
and that sort of policy is no less blind.
There is little reason to suppose that a
country which remains so indifferent to
its plain duty could survive another Pearl
Harbor.
Using the Snowy River.
A kind of a plan has come out of de-
liberations on the subject by “Common-
wealth and State officers.” This pro-
poses to divert not one but four rivers at
an estimated capital cost of £125 mil-
lion and to provide gallons of irrigation
water and hundreds of thousands of kilo-
watts of electricity after about 30 years’
building of dams, tunnels, pipelines,
power-stations, and so forth.
As far as can be gathered from
published statements, a third of the avail-
able Snowy water will be diverted into
the Eucambene, which runs into the
Tumut, which runs into the ’Bidgee. To
that will be added water equivalent to a
third of the Snowy supply, diverted from
the Tooma to the Tumut and thence to
the ’Bidgee. That ought to satisfy the
wild ’Bidgee boys.
Next, to compensate for thus taking
the Tooma from the Murray, water
equivalent to that taken from the Tooma
is to be diverted from the Snowy to the
Murray. The remaining third of the
Snowy will go to the Murray. That
ought to satisfy those persistent Victorian
fellows.
The South Australians? Let Mr. Pad-
man, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), explain: “Some
of the extra water passed into the
Murrumbidgee will probably find its way
back to the Murray through its natural
course. This will provide some of South
Australia’s quota, thus easing the drain
on Murray storages.” That ought to
satisfy those dashed South Australians
who seem to think the Murray was dug
for them.
It appears that the experts were faced
with five propositions. Two, the Snowy-
’Bidgee and Snowy-Murray, had to be
thrown out as likely to cause inter-State
uproar; two, the “Tumut diversion” and
“Snowy-Murray-Tumut” (whatever that
might mean), were merely “reported
upon”; the big job, Snowy-Murray-Mur-
rumbidgee-Tumut, includes “features of
the four previous plans,” and everybody
seems happy. Anyhow, the Murray
Valley Development League supports it,
and Mr, Hollway, of Victoria, is to seek
“an early conference” between his State,
the Commonwealth and N. S. Wales.
South Australia, presumably, can hope
for the best. It’s all very grand and
costly, and it shows what can happen
when a nation’s principal river system is
juggled by four different and conflicting
authorities.

If the Prime Minister’s statement to the
House on foreign policy did nothing else
it demonstrated clearly why he goes to
any lengths to avoid discussion on the
subject. Preoccupied with dreams and
schemes for socialisation at home he has
little interest in, and less knowledge of,
affairs abroad—and that goes for almost
the whole Socialist boiling, Evatt makes
the policy according to whim or ex-
pediency and Cabinet, while pretending to
instruct, merely concurs.
When, after many misadventures, Mr.
Cahill’s “Local” Government Act stag-
gered through the N. S. Wales Parliament
a couple of months ago it was here said
that the dragging-in to the City of Sydney
of Newtown and other industrial areas
would probably enable “Labor” to domi-
nate the City Council. At the muni-
cipal elections last Saturday—compulsory
voting and first-past-the-post—“ Labor”
romped in. Counting is not yet complete,
but the likely strength will be A.L.P. 19,
Lang Labor 2, Civic Reform 9. Not since
1927 has “Labor” been in control at
the Town Hall. Recollections of that
year will not be encouraging to either
the new aldermen or the public;
“Labor’s” conduct of civic affairs ended
with the suspension of the Sydney Cor-
poration Act by the Government, the
city being placed under a Board of Com-
missioners from October, 1927, to June,
1930. Still, the new City Fathers will
probably not overlook the fact that the
Council has often been a staging-post for
Canberra. Jock Garden, Eddie Ward and
Dan Mulcahy were all Sydney aldermen
before “Labor” sent them to Canberra;
so was Senator Donald Grant.
One of the most appalling symptoms
of the decline of public and political
morality is the apparent indifference with
which news of startling import is received
by the people. In a Sydney court last
week a police sergeant said in the past
year £250,000-worth of goods had been
stolen from the Government railways.
Nobody bothered. No Government voice
was raised to declare that this sort of
thing would be stopped at once. But
let somebody accuse somebody else of
doping a racehorse and black headlines
bloom at once, questions are asked in
the “Parliament” and a first-class roar
of indignation echoes from one end of
the country to the other —well, at least
all round the city.
It seems the Commonwealth. Govern-
ment offices in Sydney are not so well
equipped as they might be. In the New
Guinea conspiracy case Shand, K.C., sug-
gested to Jock Garden that he had
steamed open a letter. Jock denied it,
whereupon Mr. Shand said “I stippose
you know to what use a kettle can be
put?” The one-time liaison officer re-
plied, “Yes, but there were no kettles
there.”
The meetings of the little U.N.O. at
Lapstone—complete with Russian abuse
of everybody else —were appropriately
opened with the hoisting of the U.N.O.
flag upside-down. This signal of distress
was a highly intelligent anticipation.
Roy Morgan, the Australian Gallup-
poll man, flew into Sydney from the
United States last week; he was in the
U.S.A. at the time the American public
confounded the predictions of Dr, Gallup
and every other prophet of note by re-'
turning Truman to Washington. Jack
Benny and other characters who make
wisecracking their business are really en-
joying the Gallup situation at the
moment, but tlje Doctor is a scientist,
and is already on the job finding out
where his system went wrong. Pre-
liminary findings are that the doubtful
vote went 3 to 1 to Truman and that
general sentiment at the end swung to-
wards the Democrat, who fought a stub-
born battle. Roy Morgan’s own polls in
Australia have been remarkably accurate.
Bring a “Labor” politician into court
and along come the horses and dogs. Two
years ago when Thomas George de Largie
D’Alton was acquitted in Hobart of a
charge of “having corruptly solicited and
received” a gift of timber from a saw-
miller when a Minister of the Crown, he
swore in evidence that he had paid the
sawmiller in cash in a Hobart street out
of money kept in his Ministerial office
“for racing purposes.” Last February
D’Alton’s chief. Premier Cosgrove, was
also acquitted (by a 10-2 majority; jury
unanimity is not required under Tas-
manian law) on charges of bribery and
corruption. In the course of the trial
Cosgrove mentioned that he won “about
£lOO a year” at punting and admitted that
the “special” party fund which he con-
trolled received substantial contributions
from bookmakers, publicans, a dog-
racing man and a Sydney agent for
“Tatts.” In the first Garden case Mr.
Ward’s protege. Bill Urquhart, was on
his own showing a mighty punter and a
nightmare to the bookies —and there was
mention of “a big win on Precise.” It
seems to be the same on the other side
of the world. At the Board of Trade
inquiry Stateless alien Stanley, speaking
of his friendship with the Parliamentary
Secretary to the Board of Trade (John
Belcher), said that:
Every third or fourth Saturday when
Belcher was in London they met and went
to dog-racing. He used to make trig wagers,
but Belcher had place-bets of 2s.
A two-bob better! Belcher would never
do for the ranks of Australian “Labor.”
Mr. Finnan, the McGirr Minister for
price-fixing, said the new Holden car
couldn’t be sold in N. S. Wales until the
makers applied for a N.S.W. fixed price
and were granted it. He added that he
thought the price fixed by Victoria (£742
in all) was “rather precipitate” and that
neither the Victorian Government nor the
car manufacturers had consulted either
the N.S.W. or Queensland Governments
about the price. If this is the way State
price-fixing is to be conducted, there’ll
be an enormous amount of muddle and
time-wasting and it will, naturally, add
to prices. The blame lies with the Chifley
Government, which was not asked by the
May referendum to abandon price-fixing
but was merely denied a permanent
power over prices.
Nutshell history of a dumper:
The Bulletin nicknamed Albert Dunstan
“the Jumping-Jack and cartooned him
as Humpty Dumpty. All parties in Victoria,
including his own, have called him far worse
things than that at times for quite understand-
able reasons. As leader of the Country Progres-
sives, a breakaway section of the C.P., he kept
a “Labor” Administration in office, dumped it
and supported a Nationalist Government,
dumped that and supported “Labor” again,
dumped it once more and, as leader of a re-
united Country party, joined a composite Gov-
ernment with the U.A.P. This alliance lasted
three years and was returned to office at the
1935 elections, dropping only one seat to
“Labor.” Stanley Argyle made him Deputy-
Premier, but Dunstan, deciding the time had
come to swap horses again, moved a no-
confidencc motion against the leader whose
platform he had shared, got “Labor” support
and formed a minority Government himself.
That was on April 2, 1935, and by grace of
“Labor” his Country-party junta clung to office
for eight years, till John Cain, discovering at
long last that the C.P. was grossly over-
represented in Parliament, withdrew the props
and down fell Albert. But not for long. Five
days later Cain was an ex-Premier and Dunstan
was back in the saddle as head of a composite
C.P.-U.A.P. team, all parties having in the
course of a week swallowed and regurgitated
their principles a couple of times.
The jumping-jack Premier lasted two years
that time and was ousted by a “caretaker”
Government comprising a handful of Liberals,
Cookies and Independents. MacFarlan led it,
and at the ensuing election he and most of his
crew were obliterated, leaving “Labor” easily
the strongest party and a batch of Independents
holding the balance of power. With the support
of the Independents the second Cain Govern-
ment took office on November 21, 1945, with
high hopes of living three years. Twenty months
later Chifley’s Bank Grab killed those hopes;
“Labor” was slaughtered at the polls and the
Hollway-McDonald Government came into
office. Albert had by then lost the titular
leadership of his party, but was included in
the Cabinet as Minister for Health. Apparently
it wasn’t a healthy move for the Government,
as last week’s boilover showed. In the course
of Humpty Dumpty’s 28 years in Victorian
politics he has dumped everyone in turn. If
his party has any sense of reality it will dump
him.
Out in. the Queensland cattle country
they’re going ahead with the road-train
scheme for getting fats to market. A
diesel-powered unit, 61ft. long, is moving
fats from Marion Downs over a dry 140
miles lead to Dajarra railhead, making
three trips a week. It saves the cattle
and keeps the industry going. Out from
the Alice another big job, 135 ft. long and
capable of lifting 80 cattle or 200 sheep
at 20 m.p.h., is at work. It’s all very
progressive, but an outback killing works
and transference of chilled or frozen
carcasses to the markets would be more
like it.
A Mr. Page, from Shanghai, blew into
Queensland the other day and told a
reporter of what happened when the
Chinese Nationalist Government clapped
100 p.c. duty on cigarettes and 150 p.c,
duty on woollen goods. “The Shanghai
public descended on the shops like a
plague of locusts and bought up every-
thing in sight. I have never seen any-
thing like it,” He couldn’t have been in
Sydney when the Canberra Government
announced that it intended to introduce
clothes rationing.
For weeks Communist unions in Syd-
ney planned for December 1 a mass
demonstration against increased tram-
fares and rising prices. Mr. Finnan,
Minister for Price-Control, pointed out
what is apparent to all but those who do
not want to see it —that they could do
more to bring down prices by working
and producing than by time-wasting
parades and meetings ; but the Comrades,
including those noisy females the “New
Housewives,” continued their attempts to
whip up enthusiasm for the mob orators’
beano. Wednesday came, with the “Tri-
bune” forecasting “a big crowd” and re-
marking that the meeting would be “a
sharp warning to the State Government.”
A two-hour stoppage had been planned
in all Red-controlled industries, but some-
thing came unstuck somewhere. The
Ladies of the Revolution were there, to-
gether with a few other hardened demon-
strators who never miss a “rally,” but
the general body of unionists turned the
show down flat. The whole roll-up, in-
cluding those who came to look on, could
have been accommodated under one
medium-sized Moreton Bay fig-tree.
Acting-Premier Baddeley, of N. S.
Wales, doesn’t always find the Opposition
opposing his utterances. Late last month
in reply to a question in the Assembly
he said:
I assure the honorable member that the
Government is anxious to conclude the
present sittings by December 10
Christmas is not far away and I am sure
that no honorable member wishes to be
here right up to the festive season.
No honorable member disputed the
assumption.
Christmas being a bad season for elec-
tioneering, the Prahran by-election for
the Victorian House of Assembly will
not be held till some time in January.
There were 11 starters for the Liberal
pre-selection ballot; Martin Smith had a
majority over his combined opponents at
the first count. A businessman, member
of the Prahran Council for six*years, in-
cluding two as Mayor, he should be a
hard man for “Labor” to beat. A year
ago he got within 91 votes of Mr. Quirk,
whose death caused the vacancy. The
late member’s personal vote was consider-
able, and “Labor’s” haven’t risen since
then, as the Geelong by-election showed.
Amid cries of “Gandhi’s victory,” the
Indian Constituent Assembly recently
adopted a clause in the new Constitution
abolishing untouchability. One would
like to think that the troubles of the
70,000,000 Indians who can’t enter Hindu
temples, can’t drink from the same wells
as their fellow Hindus, can’t let their
shadows fall on the food of a casteman
and are permitted to do only the lowliest
jobs in the country are over, but there
is a similar clause with regard to negroes
in the American Constitution. Legal
enactments don’t change prejudices,
A “very strictly private and confiden-
tial” letter in the handwriting of Mr.
George Gibson, a “Labor”-appointed
director of the Bank of England, was
read by Sir Hartley Shawcross at the
Board of Trade inquiry. It began “My
dear Stanley: Thank you very much for
the sausage which came along for Christ-
mas, and was very much appreciated.” A
note containing the message “chops and
tomato-sauce” brought a whole heap of
trouble to honest old Mr. Pickwick.
If John Charles Thomas were to make
a recording of the string of platitudes the
Prime Minister called a statement on
foreign affairs it would be a bigger hit
than “Bluebird of Happiness.”
Albert was fond of suggesting innova-
tions and improvements, to the annoyance
of men who liked their own ways best.
Thus a considerable and very influential
section was always ready to cavil at what
he said, and find motives or suspicions in
what he did.
A generous comment on Victoria’s
Albert Dunstan? No, Justin McCarthy
on Victoria’s Albert the Good.
Mr. Pollard somewhat joyfully told
wheatgrowers early last week that they
were to get another sd. a bushel for
home-consumption wheat. Then the
flour-millers and bakers demanded of
Mr. Pollard how they were going to
keep on selling bread at the same price
with flour up £1 a ton. Bread being a
very important factor in an election year,
the Minister withdrew into a thoughtful
silence.
There’s no doubt about the modera-
tion of the A.C.T.U, moderates. Their
latest appointee to the panel of advo-
cates to press before the Arbitration
Court the claim for a basic-wage in-
crease of 30s. is J. McPhillips, assistant-
secretary of the Red Ironworkers’ Union.
Those- other well-known moderates
Thornton, Healy and Elliott may expect
a call at any moment.
Churchill took on his old role of critic
of unpreparedness last week when he
accused the Attlee Government of pre-
venting the service chiefs, “by irresponsi-
bility and constant changes,” from carry-
ing out “reasoned plans for re-establish-
ment of the defences on an organised
scale.” The Government, he said, “hid
themselves behind the pretext of military
security and refused information as no
other Government had done... .Surely
the British nation and Parliament had a
right to know as much as the Kremlin
knew about British defences?” The old
warrior was, of course, talking of British
Governments, but when it comes to shel-
tering behind “security” the Attlees and
Shinwells have nothing on the Chifleys
and Dedmans.
“Pitt-street” views an innovation;
The benefits of “Labor” rule hit the McGirr
City in another place last week-end, and the
howls of rage and pain that arose made the
noise of a Melbourne football final sound like
a whisper. Earlier the populace had grumblingly
paid another penny on all its bus and tram
rides, but when the increased week-end fares
arrived it looked like revolution. At lunch-
time on Saturday thousands going home found
themselves up for an extra 2d. or 3d. They
complained that they weren’t on a week-end
holiday but were going home from work, that
they were being robbed, that the “Guv’ment”
ought to do something. The Government did;
it went on collecting the increased fares, though
verbal brawls between conductors and passengers
went on all over the place. Many refused
to pay, refused to get off the vehicles, defied
conductors of both sexes, inspectors and drivers.
Boy scouts, bush-walkers and others who had
headed into the surrounding hills on Friday
night and returned on Sunday night found
they hadn’t the money to get home; on Satur-
day night picture business fell off; church col-
lection-plates were light on Sunday. Then a
ferry company seized the opportunity to
announce a tuppence increase, and a stunned
silence enveloped Sydney. On Monday the
population, going to work in no pleasant frame
of mind, learned that “Labor” had won the
City Council elections and immediately began
making inquiries about the prospects of getting
jobs in Melbourne, Adelaide and Mirboo North.


“FOR OPPORTUNITIES SACRIFICED.”


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Zake”; Were I one of the fortunates
who will shortly qualify for a life-pension
of £8 a week for having snored for some
years in the daytime on a fellow-legisla-
tor’s shoulder, I would introduce a private
member’s bill making it an offence to
give men slippers as Christmas presents.
Consider the wretched recipient. Invari-
ably accompanying the gift is the warning
that they are only for indoor use. At first
father uses them judiciously only to go
and search for the morning paper from
where it has been hidden with diabolical
aim by its vendor. Then inexorably
comes the morning when he notices how
dry the flower-beds are, so he stands
watering the garden in the twin curses.
From that it’s only a step to doing a
little transplanting, and then the final
enormity when, in the crisp pre-break-
fast air, he decides to dig over that bed,
his subsequent appearance in mud-caked
slippers being the prelude to a domestic
barney. The eye-searing tie can, after
the lapse of a few weeks, be used to keep
the tomatoes more firmly to the stake;
the cigarette-fighter can be pushed on to
little Johnny in the sure Knowledge that
he can never come to any harm with it;
cigars can be farmed out to unsuspecting
friends as the occasion arises; gift
handkerchiefs can be used as standbys
to present in return to some idiot who
springs a surprise present on you on
Christmas Eve after all the shops are
shut. But therfe is nothing for the slipper-
receiver to do but get them mud-caked
in the garden and face his spouse’s ire.
Away with ’em! ,

“Long Marker”: All those golf-club
members who mutter in their whiskers
every time an associate heaves in sight
and cling tenaciously to the theory that
golf is man’s last refuge from woman
will be far from surprised by what hap-
pened on a Hertfordshire (Eng.) course.
An associate, after being six times associ-
ates’ captain, was asked to resign. She
assaulted two associates, was haled to
court and bound over. Then she went
for the club’s 73-year-old secretary. Her
solicitor asserted that she was “no modern
Amazon, bestriding the golf course like
a colossus, assaulting members right and
left,” but there was evidence that she’d
kicked the sec.’s shins, laming him, had
threatened others, forced her way into
the clubhouse —imagine that happening as
you described a 20ft. putt at the 19th!
and “made rude faces” at the members.
It cost her £l5 10s. in fines and costs
and a two-year bond to keep the peace.
Knowing associates. I’ll hazard a guess
that she probably thought it was worth
it all. Me? Any time I sight an oncom-
ing associate I’m grabbing my five-iron.

“B. A. Ker”: Apparently the modern
youth is not aggressively critical of his
fellow - hobbledehoy’s hair - style (B.
10/11/’4B). In my youth none but the
extremely brave would have been game
to appear in public with hair permed or
artificially curled. And young men with
that sort of courage don’t ape women.
In those days custom decreed that the
young male should wear his hair long and
brushed straight back —with consequent
necessity to keep flinging the head back
so that opponents on the football-field
ceased to have the appearance of being
hidden in a dense jungle. This tossing
business became a habit. Enjoying a
swim recently I was called over to the
bank by my niece. “Why do you always
throw your head back sort of funny after
you’ve dived, Unc.?” she asked. I didn’t
know that I still did. But it must look a
bit ridiculous nowadays—with my arid
scalp.
“Mullum”: Curly-haired kids? For
20 years Fred enjoyed the manly quality
of straight hair. Then he joined file Army
and, for the first time in his fife, had to
wear a hat. In less then six months a
wave had appeared; in a year his hair
was a series of ripples. He went to
Darwin and put the clippers over his
head. When his hair grew again the
waves were even more numerous. He
“I'd even get the bath fixed if she'd only come back to me."
is resigned to it now, but isn’t decided
what was the real cause —wearing a hat,
change of diet, open-air life, or something
else. If he knew he’d be on a fortune.

“Pongo”: An advertisement of a
“Boy’s all-steel coaster-truck with rubber-
tyred wheels and sash-cord for steering”
took me back to the origin of the coaster
in Woollahra (Sydney) in the early
’nineties when a bright lad, Bill Dobson,
caused a sensation by travelling from
the Ocean-street gates of Centennial Park
almost to the gates at Randwick in his
new-style billycart. His invention con-
sisted of a gin-case fitted with two 6in,
cast-iron wheels at rear and a pair of 4in.
steering-wheels pivoted on a stout board
nailed to the bottom of the box, and
steered by ropes attached to each end of
the front axle. It sported an efficient
brake and a bicycle-bell for warning slow-
moving pedestrians. Prior to the advent
of “Dobbie’s new model” we nippers
converted our old-style carts into coasters
by placing the shafts of one cart inside
those of another. We would sit one in
each vehicle, the lad in the rear cart steer-
ing by means of the other’s shafts. Coast-
ing was perilous, especially when Stinker
in the front cart failed to hold the shafts
of the rear cart firmly. Less than a week
after the trial run of Dobbie’s new model
Centennial Park and near-by streets were
alive with replicas,

“C.Q.”: It has taken two Sydney
trawler skippers to blow out the notion
that the chronic shortage and high price
of sea-food in Melbourne is the fault of
the piscine population. Lowering their
anchors on a patch of sea-bottom off
Queenscliff which local fishermen had
constantly failed to trawl, they found it
cluttered up with Bren guns and other
Army equipment dumped there by the
Disposals Commission. Clearing a space
they waited for the fish to swim in and,
in four days, drew up eight tons of the
best flathead they had seen for years.

“Bo”: I can see at least one big ad-
vantage the Bft.-ceiling rooms of N.S.W.
Housing Commission homes will have
over the standard 9ft. pattern. The handy
householder, instead of having to balance
unsteadily on a rickety ladder and get a
kink in his neck as he reaches up with
his kalsomine brush, will be able to lie
flat on his back on the kitchen-table and
refurnish the ceiling in complete comfort.
This is perhaps outweighed by a slight
drawback—the risk the occupier runs of
buckling his neck should he leap for joy
on hearing over the air that a horse he
has backed has won.

“Simon”: A few more old-time
Domain orators (B. 27/10/’4B). In the
nineties there was Harry Foran, an elo-
quent Irishman with a John L. Sullivan
moustache. He could talk about any-
thing, had a fine choice of English and
ran against George Reid a couple of
times. He lived in Woolloomooloo and
wrote himself anonymous letters to which
he replied on Sunday, Another was Jack
Dwyer, with his tattered banner of the
unemployed. His mouth was like an
inverted V surmounted with a scraggy
moustache. He had only two teeth, but
as they were set opposite they functioned
serviceably, and he could talk. German
Charlie, of the frowsy ensemble, had in
his forehead a row of wrinkles that
opened and shut like a concertina. His
speciality was cancer, and he made his
cure public. This was it; Take the
patient, put him in a chaffbag, fill up
the vacant spaces with gum-leaves. Hose
the bag with soap-suds till you smell
the eucalyptus; then take the patient out
and burn the bag —the cancer would be
in the bag. Favorite joke of George
Perry, the Temperance orator, was the
Dew Drop Inn ; when you were busted
it was the Do Drop Out. He reached the
City Council as an alderman and was
once beaten for the State electorate of
Cook by only 40 votes.

“Dalziel”: There is still hope for the
nation. Across the road from me is a
group of partly-built housing-commission
homes. Work has been at a standstill
for many weeks, so we were surprised
this morning to see workmen arriving.
I checked my watch and also the calendar.
Both were correct. Work commenced at
6 a.m. on a Saturday morning, and if
that doesn’t deserve a Bulletin exclama-
tion mark, nothing ever will. But per-
haps pvertime explains it.

“Hattie Hop”: Theatre cats? Norman
Campbell used to tell of one which walked
on stage when H. B, Irving was de-
livering a “Hamlet” soliloquy. The cat
rubbed itself against the actor’s legs,
Irving stooped, picked it up and com-
pleted his speech with the cat in his
arms. Norman had another story about
a cat at the Melbourne Theatre Royal.
On a hot, sultry night the play being
enacted was set in the depths of an
arctic winter. The scene was a log cabin,
snow was banked up outside the windows
and a synthetic log-fire blazed on the
hearth. The melodrama, was approaching
a climax when in strolled the cat, and,
seeking a cool spot, walked to the fire-
place and curled itself up among the
“flames.” Embarrassing for the actors,
but the hit of the show for the audience.

“8.A.”: The first felt-hat factory in
Australia (B, 24/11/’4B) was established
in Pitt-street, Sydney, by an enterprising
citizen named Usher well over a century
ago. An advertisement which appeared
in the Sydney press on June 6, 1831, indi-
cates that the Usher hat was of excellent
quality, whatever it may have lacked in
style or craftmanship. “Four shillings
per dozen will be given for possum skins
of good quality at Usher’s Hat Manu-
factory, Pitt-street.” Prior to the intro-
duction of the Usher hat the dweller by
the Tank Stream was roofed with a hand-
woven broad-brimmer of cabbage-tree
fibre.

“Laetitia”: That N.G. goldfields iden-
tity (B. 17/11/’4B) who was an “uncon-
scionably long time in dying,” though
his demise was the subject of much wager-
ing, recalls the passing of Madua, the
greatest of the “purri-purri” fraternity
in the Torres Strait islands. Upon the
departure of all signs of life in the old
man he was duly interred and the tradi-
tional death-feast got under way. Sud-
denly the festivities were interrupted by
an unsolicited encore from the lately
interred one, who stood erect in his shal-
low grave. A family conference was
held and a formula was evolved as a
result of which a good time was had
by all except one of those assembled.
The lone dissentient was the persistent
purri-purri man, who was deterred by
bonds fashioned of fibrous vines from
making a second reappearance.

“Unicorn”: On a trip through the west
coast, South Island (M.L.), I was struck
by the general terseness. First-prize for
economy of words went to a provincial
paper for its weather report. simply
said “Improving.”
* * * *
“Minto”: If you see a man reading the
paper upside-down (B. 17/11/ ’4B) don’t
jump to the conclusion that he is mad.
I made this mistake about an elderly
gentleman in the train, and remarked to
a friend that he was probably “troppo.”
Overhearing this the old boy gently re-
buked me; “My dear fellow, I am neither
psychopathic nor, to use your vulgarism,
am I ‘troppo.’ I am reading my paper
upside down because the publishers see
fit to print the answers to the daily
puzzle upside-down.”
* * * *
“Waddlin’ Willie”: Too frequently
gremlins (B. 17/11 / ’4B) received the
blame for everything from a dead donk
to an uncontrollable drift. Remember
one day flying across the Kimberley
Ranges when the radio-operator could
not get his transmitter to “perk,” He
worked solidly for three hours and gave
up just prior to landing at Broome firmly
believing it was another case of grem-
linology. When we got down he saw a
lunch-wrap tied tightly around the aerial
insulator midway between the Lockheed-
Hudson’s nose and port rudder. Thrown
out from the cockpit, it had been swept
to the insulator by the slipstream, and its
greasiness had virtually earthed the
aerial.
* * * *
“Pawang”: A judgment that will be
read all over the world was made when
Judge Barry gave his decision on the
Kyneton mixed-baby case. There is no
doubt in the Judge’s mind that the mother
who protested that she had been given
the wrong baby is right, and he gave an
order that the non-objecting parents
should surrender the baby who was given
to them, though he allowed a stay of
seven days for them to have blood-tests
taken if they wished it and bring further
evidence if they could do so. It is a
very sad case, as both pairs of parents
appear to love equally well the babies
the hospital allotted to them. As both
little girls are now three and a half years
old, their early associations, usually the
most important determining factors in
people’s lives, are already fixed and firmly
lodged in their unconscious. Whatever
feelings of security or insecurity they
have will be stimulated by certain objects
or types of behavior and they will con-
tinue to be stimulated by similar objects
and similar types of behavior in the
future. Their “new” parents won’t know
why they react in this or that way any
more than they will. It seems to be a
situation .which is psychologically incap-
able of solution whatever the law may -
say about it.

“Horsefeathers”: M.p.h. means nothing
to a pioneer settler of Morowa (W.A.).
He’s just lobbed into Perth for the first
time ; it has taken him 65 years to do the
200-odd miles. There’s a younger brother
on the track somewhere, about 15 years
back. It’s a change these days to find
someone who doesn’t want to be there
before he’s left here. Another leisurely
bloke was the Italian who recently hit
the city of ex-Caesars. At 83 he had
never seen a plane or a car before.
Casual? Well, he’d done some stiletto-
sticking in his youth, and had been in
boob the last 53 years.

“Dualana”: Tourist-car drivers are a
cheery lot: but sometimes in their zeal
they’re unconsciously funny. A friend
and I were much amused by a driver
in Maoriland who, in explaining a trip
through the Nelson hop-growing district,
said with great solemnity. “And this,
ladies and gentlemen, is where they tram
the hop to climb.” I got a. mental pic-
ture of earnest growers taking the hops
on an early-morning exercise, but per-
haps he meant something else.
CAN LIGHT VERSE BE POETRY?
(One of the questions submitted to Leaving Cer-
tificate candidates at the recent N.S.W. schools
examinations.)
Well, and why not? I’ve yet to hear a single
Reason why those who regularly strive
Pleasant conceits with lilting rhymes to mingle
Shouldn’t, if only now and then, contrive
To spring upon the world a bit of jingle,
A stave or two that’s likely to survive
And live in memory when quite a lot
Of what’s now counted poetry is forgot.
True, there are bards whose stature and whose
status
Assure them on Parnassus’ heights a place,
But is there such a notable hiatus
Between them and the lowlier of their race
That not a sniff of the divine afflatus
Is left for minstrels round the mountain’s
base?
Cannot they have, however brief and few,
Moments of genuine inspiration too?
Poetry, if you should ask me, I submit is
The music—nothing more or less—of words,
No matter what the epics or the ditties
Refer to, or what theme the song engirds.
Whether it tells of countrysides or cities,
Of human beings or animals or birds,
Supremely grave or riotously gay,
It’s got to be melodious anyway.
Think of the father of all poets turning
From the grim slaughter and the sacrifice
Of lives ere Ilium’s topless towers were burning
To some more cheerful topic to entice
His Muse —that burst of minstrelsy concerning
The mimic Battle of the Frogs and Mice,
A sprightly effort that proclaims it true
A parody may be a poem too.
Verse can be poetry, it’s no delusion;
And though those modem bards I’d not
asperse
Whose cryptic efforts leave me in confusion
Whether the rhythm or the rhyming’s worse,
I’ve come regretfully to the conclusion
That so-called poetry isn’t always verse,
And far too often that it isn’t much
Like what might charitably pass for such.

T. THE R.


“Jasby” witnesses the settling of a
wager:
Last Thursday morning at ten o’ the clock
I wenMnto a Sydney pub. with The Bulletin
Showman and a character calling himself Salt
Junk Joe. Muttering something about the
lighthouse-keeper on Cape Naturaliste having-
let Kim down, the Showman called for three
schooners. Salt Junk Joe toasted “Here’s to
good old Griffith Taylor,” and we sank the
schooners. The Showman asked the lady of
the bar to set ’em up again. I was standing
between the two, and my left ear was
bashed with a monologue on wildflowers, the
opera, Ben Jonson, the ballet, “Love Me Sailor”
and the repertory movement, while my right
ear was being assailed with a discourse on
prevailing winds, hard-hearted sea-captains,
windjammers, tight-fisted owners, bully mates
and stormy westerlies. After the third round
the Showman looked at his watch; Salt Junk
Joe remarked that he hadn’t felt so dry since
the days when he was on the Chilean nitrate
run; the Showman nodded to the barmaid and
the glasses were refilled. The Showman said
his favorite Shaw play was “Captain Brass-
bound’s Conversion.” “What ships'was he in?”
asked Salt Junk Joe. Three rounds later the
Showman borrowed a pound from the barmaid,
handed it back to her and asked her to tell
him when it ran out. At this stage Joe said
he might be prepared to admit that there were
wildflowers on Cape Naturaliste, but he didn’t
“By the Way, Basil —are you any good
at cooking ?”
think the Brave West Wind had anything to
do with it; the Showman said that in certain
circumstances geography and poetry were the
sarpe thing. After five more schooners the
Salt Showman said a zone was a zone and
that was all there was to it; Joe Junk said
wind was wind and that was all there was to
that. Then the Junkman turned on me and
asked who I was to set myself up as an
authority, and Salt Shunk Show told me to
keep my bib out of it and not keep picking
on his old pal the Saltrtian. “Break it down,
boys/” said the barmaid. “You’re not in the
Roaring Forties now, you know.” “Who
isn’t?” demanded the Sunkman. “No one ever
said that to me and got away with it.” He
put down his schooner empty, of course.
“Steady on,” I said, “the girl didn’t mean any-
thing.” “What girl?” bellowed Joe Shalt. “Try
to shelter behind a woman, would you?’
■“Leave him alone,” said So-sunk, “he’s not
worth worrying about.” “Isn’t he?” shouted
Junk Show. “I’ll show you.”- Then Shunk
Joe tipped over the Manshow’s beer and the
Junker grabbed Junk Show’s schooner. The
Joeman and Shunk Salt both made a swing
at me where I wasn't and the two went down
together. “Beer’s off,” said the barmaid. So
was I.

“Adolphus”: Donald Grant’s com-
plaint that his speeches are ignored by
the press (B. 17/11/ ’4B) reminds me of
Alfred Deakin’s story about a Victorian
M.L.A. for Middle Brighton who fell
foul of the Melbourne dailies. After
weeks of neglect he saw a prospect of
being restored to grace when an im-
portant measure was brought forward
upon which he was particularly well
qualified to speak. The House listened
to him with keen attention for more than
an hour, and he was congratulated on all
sides for his contribution to the debate.
In the morning he was. waiting for the
newsboy at the front gate. First glance
failed to reveal his name in the Parlia-
mentary report, although the debate was
given plenty of space. He looked more
carefully at the report of his immediate
predecessor’s speech. Then came the
blow. He read “After an interruption by
the member for Middle Brighton, Mr. T.
R. Patcher (South Yarra) declared that
the measure before the House was un-
doubtedly,” etc. Donald hasn’t so much
to complain of after all.

“Spokeshave”: Boys get too well paid
in Melbourne these days to bother about
following the once-lucrative profession of
trapping the city’s multitudinous pigeon
population and selling them to the hotels
as squabs for the free lunch— anyhow,
the free-lunch fashion is as dead as the
dodo. Hence Melbourne City Fathers
have had to take control of the pigeon
menace in their own hands and the birds
are likely to get a fright shortly. Some-
one has devised a model owl made of
papier mache with eyes which blink in
an alarming manner, emitting with each
blink that cold white glare peculiar to
the family. Several of the “birds” will
be tried out on the roof of the Town
Hall. Presumably the pigeons are ex-
pected to drop dead with flight or com-
mit suicide or something and not just go
off and squat elsewhere; otherwise it
be a question of putting an owl on

“Momokan”: “Sixenate’s” account of
an encounter in court between a wife
and a “de facto” (B. 24/11/’4B) re-
minded me of a similar experience I had
as C.-in-C. of a native-labor camp in
Papua. The peace of the night was rudely
shattered by shouts and cries; a police-
boy dispatched to find out the cause
arrived back with a
strapping lad hand-
cuffed and accom-
panied by two
Marys. The culprit
had been married in
his village up the
Fly, and during the
war he had been
conscripted in a labor
corps and brought
down to Moresby,
where he decided to
remain after the
stoush. He had taken
unto himself another
wife; sfie wasn’t a
“de facto,” as his
tribe allowed two
wives. Now his
original wife had
come down to see
what was keeping
him away from his
village. I asked wife
No. 2 if she still
wanted the boy as
husband. She did.
Wife No. 1 also
wanted him back.
Turning to the hus-
band I asked “What
do you think?” He
replied: “These two
wives make plenty
trouble, Taubada.”
“I’ll say they do,” I
agreed. “What are
you going to do
about it?” “More
better I get another wife, eh, Taubada?”
Perhaps Native Protector Eddie Ward
could have solved the problem. It was
beyond me.

“Undertaker’s Assistant”: The most
impressive funeral my suburb has seen for
ages was not, as naturally was my first
thought, that of an underworld gangster
or a jockey. It was the, burial by his
very successful widow of a man who had
been a waster, had never supported her
and had caused her much expense over
the years. Whipping-up the attendance
for the obsequies of such a man had been
a triumph of organisation ; for one thing,
the lady had arranged with the tenants
of each of her residentials to send mourn-
ing coaches to pick them up, and had
suggested that they could order wreaths
from a local florist at her expense. Why
she should have gone to all that outlay
over a man who had lived apart from
her for 30-odd years, about whose
demise she could not shed a tear, is no
longer a mystery, for she has explained
it. “There was never anything about my
husband that could make me proud of
“I’m just doing what the wife said”
him ; I thought I would like to be proud
of his funeral,” she has been telling her
friends.
* * * *
“Uco”: There has been controversy
as to the meaning of the term
“drawn” in the old punishment of draw-
ing and quartering (B. 24/11/ ’4B), some
authorities holding that it merely meant
drawn to the place of execution, not dis-
embowelment. In the case of the Scottish
patriot Wallace it apparently meant
both. Tire sentence said that he was to be
drawn from the Palace of Westminster
to the Tower, then hanged, drawn, be-
headed and quartered. Lord Ellen-
borough, Chief Justice of England at the
beginning of last century, used to leave
no doubt in the condemned man’s mind
as to the nature of the punishment.
Brewer’s Phrase and Fable quotes a writer
in the “Gentleman’s Magazine” as evi-
dence that the old boy used to say:
You are drawn on hurdles to the place
of execution, where you are to he hanged,
but not till you are dead; for, while still
living, your body is to be taken down, your
bowels torn out and burnt before your
face; your head is then cut off, and your
body divided into four quarters.
There is a legend that one tough old lag
asked the Judge “What comes after that?”
His Lordship’s reply is not recorded.

“Sixenate”: There are 135 budding
lawyers among the 1600 students who
hope to finish off successfully their
courses in the big Sydney Professions
Factory this year. Quite too many;
offices are scarce, and except for those
who are going in to ready-made family
practices only a lucky few will be able
to put up a plate. Jobs in law offices
are all the others can hope for at present.
The 155 young doctors will easily be
mopped up, and, with the industrial de-
mand for scientists (356 of them), en-
gineers (154) and economists (110) none
of these should have any difficulty. And
the 8Q dentists are far short of the demand
now that molar inspection is a, routine
in the schools, and the advice in 50 per
cent, of the cases is for an expert to be
seen about dental deficiencies. A queer
thing is the poor showing in architecture
—a mere 17 graduates. There should be
more room at the present time in this
profession than in any other, but the
faculty doesn’t seem to appeal.

“South Coast”: When he found the
coffee in the tea-canister, my friend with
the Continental accent remarked, “But
yes, one time, back in Austria, my
father said to my mother, ‘How is it,
Truda, that I always find the sugar in
the wrong tin?’ And my mother said,
‘Well, the sugar goes in the tin for flour
and the flour goes in the tin for rice and
the rice goes in the oatmeal-tin. It is
just the system that men do not under-
stand. It is all quite clear when you get
the system. And, now, will you get put
of my kitchen and not ask so many silly
questions?’ So the feminine system seems
to be the same the world over.”

“Nicholls Pt.”: Back in August, 1945,
an eight-year-old girl vanished from the
tiny Murray hamlet of Gol Gol, a few
miles up-river from Mildura on the
N.S.W. side. Though the country in the
immediate vicinity is fairly open and no
effort was spared to find her, ho trace of
the girl was ever discovered. The other
week a fisherman at Gol Gol found what
he thought was brown human hair on
his fish-hook, there was a flurry of ex-
citement, a diver went down and searched
the river-bed. He found nothing of
what he looked for. Then an analyst
declared the hairs to be non-human and
the mystery remained a mystery. But
what animal (or fish) has hair that any-
body could possibly mistake for the
silken strands of a child’s head?
“Trek”: Habit is a dreadful thing.
Speaker Rosevear, of the Federal Parlia-
ment, usually speaks with a diction rather
superior to the averse in the House, but
he uses one phrase so often that now it
has become “I think the eye zavvit.”

“J.C.H.”; Tasmania stakes a claim to

for November 18 published six death

“Bungho”: The Cunnell at the pub
amused us with his constant moans.
Nothing was right till at breakfast one
morning he said after the usual oath,
“They made a mistake this morning ; this
coffee’s not bad.”

“Lawnstob”: Add a factory to the un-
usual cargoes that have been given wings.
Twelve A.N.A. and T.A.A. planes have
started to lift a complete engine-bearing
manufacturing plant from Carlton (Vic.)
to Mowbray, near Launceston. Fourteen
key employees and their families will go
with them. The air-lift has been spread
over three weeks to avoid breaks m
production. Repco, Ltd., are the movers
in this bit of decentralisation.

“Laetitia”: Like “Ex-Hutchins” (B.
3/11/ ’4B), I have thrilled at the achieve-
ments of old boys of my Queensland
G.P.S. —never more so than during a
cattle-stealing trial in the North, when
Judge, complainant, both counsel and
defendant were all old boys who had
won their colors in the same year. My
feeling of pride sprang from the fact that
the man in the dock never betrayed by
any inflection of behavior, even when he
received a stiff sentence, that he had ever
previously met the central figures in the
drama in which he played a star role.
* * * *
“Melbn”: Somebody has discovered
that the founders of Melbourne selected
a more appropriate name than they
imagined for their city. It turns out
that the British Prime Minister of the day
got his title from a small hamlet near
London called Melbourne, a name which
comes from “mel,” meaning sweet, de-
rived through Norman French from the
Latin word for honey, and “burn,” a
stream. That was a fair description of
the Yarra in 1835, and you can blame
anybody you like if it raises a laugh now.

“Hamer”: Perhaps the enforced
dullness of police courts makes dull all
the people who attend them. It is sur-
prising to recall some evidence that has
passed without a snigger. In one case
about which an old note has just turned
up amongst my- papers a battered-looking
husband gave his testimony: “Directly I
entered my wife came at me with a
scream and tried to hit me with an axe.
I took it from her, but she bit me,
punched me and scratched my face.
Then she tried to pull the hallstand over
on me and suddenly hit me with a sand-
bag, I tried to take it from her, but she
ran into the bedroom and threw a water-
jug at me and tried to push the wardrobe
over on me.” He paused, and the S.M.
asked what happened then. “She said,”
continued the witness, ‘“Now get out
before I lose my temper.’ ” There wasn’t
even a smile except my own ; and, catch-
ing that, the S.M. looked at me as if he
intended to fine me for contempt of
court.
GOOKS.
“American troops in Japan have been officially
ordered not to refer to the natives as ‘gooks’ (tali-
less monkeys).” —New York cable.
I wonder who invents these comprehensive
Expressions to disparage and deride
And hence to be regarded as offensive
By- those to whom they’re carelessly applied.
These pungent brevities for any mention
Of which in diction’ries one vainly looks
Are always being forced on one’s attention.
And here’s the latest —“gooks”!
Such terms as “drips” and “heels” are in the
cargo
Of our Australian appellatives;
“Bohunks” and “Wops” are current Yankee
argot . 5)
And lately we’ve been introduced to “spivs.’
“Boongs” are among intelligible phrases
In E'arliament, as in the haunts and nooks
Of blokes and coves. But what the blithering
blazes,
I hear you ask, are “gooks”?
How’s it derived? There isn’t a grammarian,
I’ll bet, can tell you where it was begot,
Whether it’s Gaelic or Indo-Aryan
Or pidgin English or Chinese or what.
There’s nought for those in libraries who dawdle
And flap the leaves of philologic books
To get a hint why monkeys lacking caudal
Appendages are “gooks.”
But there it is. Whoever it was translated
This curious word for our enlightenment
Has left no doubt on why it should be rated.
Something that any human might resent.
What though their treacheries and double-
dealings,
The memories of their crimes* beyond all
healings, ,
Stamp Japs in general as savage crooks
And wanton murderers, it hurts their feelings,
You’ll note, to call them “gooks.”

THE SERVICE MAN
SOCIALISM IN JAPAN.
“Ek Dum”: When plans for
the reconstruction of Japan were
made by its conquerors, mes-
merised by Russianised ideas
and visionary dreams of the new
world, based on U.N.O. and the
Atlantic Charter, it was confi-
dently believed possible to wean
the vanquished to “peace-loving
democracy” by the destruction
of “imperialist monopolies,” the
nationalisation of utilities, the
division of large estates among
the peasants, the establishment of
votes for women, the aboli-
tion of the peerage and the purg-
ing of rich magnates, and by the
hanging of Japanese politicians
whose fate would, of course, be
a warning to the Japanese--a
people who do not fear but
actually look forward to death,
life being in their philosophy
merely an unpleasant interlude
in an eternity which (they hope)
is composed of better things.
It is unfortunate that we are
now saddled with these 1945
theories at a time when most of
their basis has proved to be a
myth. The delectable Russians
have been shown before the
world as a race more immoral
internationally than ever the Jap-
anese were, the owners of the
worst slave-camps in modern
history, more aggressive than
any of the “imperialists” who
were responsible for the Jap-
anese war. They have a
leader more absolute, more
cruel and more detached from
democratic influence than all the
shoguns and emperors put to-
gether in 2000-odd years of Jap-
anese history. Nobody sensible
believes any more in the Atlantic
Charter or U.N.O.
Because of the U.S.S.R. we
cannot make a peace treaty with
Japan, we cannot end the occu-
pation, we cannot secure any
permanence in Allied-Japanese
relations. In fact, because of the
Kremlin, and its agents in such
countries as Australia, in which
they display part of a plan for
world conquest which makes
that of Japan look trifling, it is
impossible for the Allies to pro-
ceed with the internal govern-
ment of Japan with any set
policy which is acceptable to
everyone concerned. Thus the
'Japanese have a much wider lati-
tude in interpreting what we wish
of them than they otherwise
would have.
Democracy in Uniform
At what is going on, the Jap-
anese themselves must be a little
bewildered. Apart from any-
thing else it is difficult for an
armed force to teach democracy
to a people which has just been
atom-bombed into surrender.
And when a group of victorious
Allies is punishing a conquered
country for aggression and atroi
cities it must be puzzling to the
culprit country to find among its
mentors and judges the repre-
sentatives of a nation more
guilty, because more treacherous,
than itself; one which utterly
refuses to subscribe to any
of the tenets accepted by
the others under the Geneva
Conventions for the conduct
of “civilised” war, which is
fomenting and aiding and abet-
ting a major rebellion against
one of its “allies,” China, and
which has just completed the
greatest peace-time burglary in
history—that of Allied property
in Manchuria.
Two Hirohitos
For another thing the Japanese
must be completely bemused by
the attitude of its conquerors to
the Emperor:
(1) Dr. Evatt (Australia), the Rus-
sians and Mr. Justice Webb, who
presided at the Military Tribunal
Trials, say that the Emperor appears
to be a main war criminal and should
be tried.
(2) Many Americans and British in
higher circles mix with Japanese
court circles, attend their functions,
drink the Royal sake. American
troops are allowed to fraternise with
Japanese so long as they do not be-
come affectionate in public. Aus-
tralians glower over the fence, ban
fraternisation, which in the beginning
was a purely economic measure, but
has become political.
(3) Everybody among the Allies
agrees that the ideal is a
democratic Government elected by
the people, with the Emperor re-
duced to the position of a constitu-
tional figurehead, or deposed
altogether. This the Japanese know.
And then they are told by Mr. Justice
Webb, as reported by the Sydney
“Daily Telegraph,” that the reason
Hirohito should be numbered among
the guilty men of Japan is that,
though he was an absolute monarch,
he committed the crime of acting as
if he were a constitutional one like
the King of England and Australia
and taking the advice of his Ministers
to make war instead of acting like a
despot and refusing that advice.
While Dr. Evatt has been
shouting objurgations at the
Emperor, proclaiming his war
guilt and bis “imperialism,” the
8.C.0.F. Command, under an
Australian Commander-in-Chief,
has been circulating among the
Allied forces—and is still circu-
lating—an attractive official Aus-
tralian book called Know Japan,
printed—“by authority”— in the
highly democratic Federal elec-
torate of South Yarra. In this the
following account of his Imperial
Majesty’s virtues is given:— /
It is important not to exaggerate
his actual personal authority. Hiro-
hito is reported to be extremely in-
dustrious, methodical and economical,
a faithful husband, a loving father
and a dutiful son. His main intel-
lectual interest is the study of biology.
He was carefully trained for the role
he was to play, and his early years
on the throne were the heyday of
Japanese liberalism.
It is also set out in this official
book, written in 1945, before the
new constitution, that “by con-
stitutional usage, the powers of
the Emperor are never exercised,
except on the responsibility of
some adviser. In the event of the
adviser tendering mistaken
advice, he, and not the Emperor,
has to take the responsibility for
the consequences.”
Japan Goes Democratic
It is no wonder that the Jap-
anese are a little confused,
But this has not prevented
Japan from taking to democracy,
as understood by Australian and
British Socialist Governments,
like a duck to water and with
such verve that sometimes it has
to be dragged from its objective
by the back of the neck.' Such
an occasion was that on which
General MacArthur announced
that it is “unthinkable and
intolerable” that civil-service
unions should be allowed
to gain their ends by striking

ances in Force in the Ordinary and Industrial
Departments 1,505,000 Policies assuring
£179,000,000.
INCOME—The Income for the year exceeded
£10,700,000, an increase of more than £784,000
over the previous year’s total.

er> masse , and deprived them
of the right of collective bargain-
ing with the State, a right which
almost certainly would presently
lead to their becoming the real
Government of the country with
the Occupation Command no-
where—like Mr. Chifley’s little
lot at Canberra.
Reconstruction
The Japanese, indeed, are the
most ideally constituted people
on whom to graft democracy.
There is virtually no real indi-
vidualism or personal initiative
in Japan. On first contact a
European wonders however any-
thing at all gets done there in the
Gordian-knot riot of argument
and discussion which surrounds
the simplest of operations, such
as getting a taxi- or rickshaw-
passenger to a well-known build-
ing, a feat which usually calls
for the co-operation of innumer-
able policemen, pedestrians and
shopkeepers. Decisions are al-
ways achieved by crowds; the
thought of individual responsi-
bility seems hateful. The only
things which are done by indi-
viduals represent the fruition of
the decisions of a group, and
even when carrying those out the
single Japanese looks desperately
lonely unless he can induce
a few people to stand over him
to say “Ah, so”—the encourag-
ing Japanese affirmative —to him
at intervals. A few Japanese
would bring real perfection to
the proceedings of the Security
Council. They would fit into the
structure of the United Nations
like fingers into a glove. They
would shine like stars in the
whirling politics of Australian 4
trade-unionism.
It is little wondfer that they
have proved apt pupils of the
New Socialistic West, and have
shown themselves quick to learn.
Their tutors had good reason
to hail the last elections as a
triumph for reform and the
civilising influence of contact
with reafly cultured people like
ourselves. The voters sent to
the Diet 143 Social Demo-
crats, 133 Liberals, 126 Demo-
crats, 31 Co-operatives, 29 In-
dependents and four Com-
munists. That was on Anzac
Day, 1947. It has since been
an adventurous time in Japan,
during which that unfortunate
country has lately been guided—
ir. the best “Labor” tradition —
by an ex - journalist Prime
Minister and a number of ster-
ling trade-unionists and firm be-
lievers in “advanced” democracy.
Socialises and Fertiliser
The sum total of the permuta-
tions and combinations of pro-
letarian technique which they
worked out was based on a pro-
gramme of “reconstruction.”
And in the heart of their recon-
struction plans apparently has
been one of those' huge
and generous monopolies with
which Socialists sometimes
mysteriously get into tow —
appropriately to the flavor
of the new democracy a vast
fertiliser combine, the Showa
Denka Co. This was recently
found to have become so pas-
sionately democratic itself that
it subscribed 10,000,000 yen to
the Social Democratic party
funds, apart from individual
doceurs, receiving in return
two-thirds of the total bank re-
construction allocation for the
fertiliser industry, about
3,000,000,000 yen in all.
When the Diet met, shortly
before I left Japan, to hold a sad
session at which, by 186 votes
to 185, a new Premier was
elected a Conservative, dis-
guised as a “Liberal,” Mr.
Yoshida, formerly Ambassador to
Britain—it was recorded that 399
honorable and gallant gentlemen
were not present to vote.
No fewer than 29 “top-flight”
politicians and civil servants, in-
cluding the chief Cabinet Secre-
tary and former Deputy-Prime
Minister in one of the recent
Democratic Governments, were
languishing in jail awaiting trial,
including the Minister presiding
over the Economic . Stabilisa-
tion Board, and the chair-
man of the Army Disposals
Commission, He, up to that
time, had not explained how
“millions of tons” of war;
material had evaporated in re-
turn for only about £250,000
paid to the Government. All the
internees were no doubt de-
lighted with the forethought with
which they had previously helped
to reform prison life in Japan
to the point at which a calaboose
is virtually a home from home.
It seems that Japanese demo-
cracy has overreached itself.
When a politician there is
accused on fairly sound evidence
of being involved in a shady
transaction he is banded over to
the police.
Passing over the disturbing
effects of the misguided display
by the Japanese of anxiety to
exhibit their political sores and
rob themselves of the services of
highly-placed Ministers, demo-
cracy in Japan seems to be pro-
ceeding according to Cocker
even if some of the base, war
guilty, capitalist wretches who
were purged from commercial
life in the interests of proletarian
and peace-loving principles insist
bn becoming unpurged and “fre-
quent their former offices, trying
to influence their successors to
follow their own evil ways.”
Samples of “Progress”
Examples of the demo-
cratic “progress” which has been
made under the Allied occu-
pation, and of the readiness of
the Japanese to modernise them-
selves, are to be seen on every
side and read of in every news-
paper, as witness the following
among one week’s events:
According to immemorial
custom, male participants in the
recent autumn festival at the
Otonashi Shinto Shrine, Ito,
near Australia’s “procured”
luxury Kawana Hotel, exercised
the privileges which entitle them
to sneak up behind lady wor-
shippers and pinch them in the
rear. The Tokyo press solemnly
related that the ladies this year
appeared in pinch-proof kimonos
to protect themselves against this
democratic practice.
At Kyoto the Mayor has just
held a funeral service over a 400-
year-old cherry-tree which has
died, and, under its shrivelling
limbs, read a message of condo-
lence.
The annual Budget of 300,000
yen normally provided for tidy-
ing up the remains of young
couples who, under the influence
of love’s young dream, clutch
each other’s hands and leap off
cliffs or into volcanoes, making
a nasty mess, has this year a
heavy deficit, due to the boom in
business.
An earnest democrat has
turned' up in Kure and demanded
that 8.C.0.F.’s music-teacher —
like the official art-teacher of the
Australian Occupation Forces,
he is a Jap—should join the local
musicians’ union and contribute
30 per cent, of his earnings to
the support of the “industrial
movement.” Inquiry has just
proved that the enterprising
organiser is himself, “the indus-
trial movement,” and that he
alone was waxing fat on the
dues which he has been collect-
ing in the process of promoting
trade-unionism.
In a town near Osaka, the
local aldermen have decided to
try to attract tourists to a
sacred mountain with which they
are blessed by establishing round
about it amusement parks and
merry-go-rounds.
It has been discovered that
two out of the three highly-
publicised lovers of a gentle-
man who, single • handed,
murdered ,a whole bank staff one
morning were policewomen.
The Gloomy Conservatives
It might be expected in the
light of such examples that
everybody in Japan would be
radiant with democratic hope—
this even despite the edict that
Tokyo’s teeming pressmen will
be barred from the hanging of
ex-Premier To jo. And so is
most of the country ; but not all.
As usual, it has remained for
the Conservatives alias
“Liberals,” since to be Conserva-
tive is to be adjudged “Fascist”
to strike a gloomy note. Their
leader, the new Premier, Mr.
Shigera Yoshida, has remarked
sadly that “the appalling
scandals now being exposed
should be dealt with properly
and watchfully under the eyes
■ of the public.”
] He attributes them—this after
three years 6i highly moral
tutelage by the Occupation
Forces—to “laxity of discipline
and decay of morals that has
begun to set in since the war’s
end.” ,He says that he is con-
vinced that “the key to national
reconstruction lies in moral re-
form—in the resurrection of an
ethical Japan in which the
righteous are duly rewarded.”
He believes that “the only asset
left to Japan is the labor of her
82,000,000 people,” and he is
convinced that all those people
are “burning with patriotic
fervor and working in the spirit
of brotherly devotion to march
vigorously forward to revive
production, obtain more good-
will from the Allies and assist-
ance from the Allied Powers, and
so pave the way for the country’s
return to the community of
nations.” It alb sounds like a
clarion-call to reaction.
To show how much they are
“burning,” a large section of
Japanese trade-unionism, taught
and sponsored by its Australian
comrades, has just demanded a
200 per cent, basic-wage in-
crease which industry cannot by
any stretch of imagination pay.
Still, anything is possible in a
country in which the Communist
party has been absolved officially
from war-guilt, and poses as a
body of “reformists,” support-
ing private ownership yes,
private ownership—the return
of Japan’s strategic island
colonies, the deeding to Japan
of “equal economic rights” with
the other Great Powers (so that
its cheap labor can be used as a
weapon to help the U.S.S.R.
destroy Britain’s exporting in-
dustries) and the right of self-
defence.
It is possible that in 20
years from now there will be
little trace visible in Japanese life
that it has ever been subject to
the recent supervision of the
Western nations. The Japanese
people may, under men like Mr.
Yoshida, by then have reverted
to their former state of darkness
in which the Showa Denka con-
spirators would have been asked
to commit ham kiri instead of
being immured in a comfortable
prison awaiting trial.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Seeking a missing relative in Mel-
bourne might be easier than finding a
statue —or so Fl.-Lt. Michael Burke Cole,
R.A.F., A.D.C. to General Freyberg,
found when he made inquiries about
the location of the Burke and Wills statue.
His interest stems from the fact that he
is a great-grandnephew of explorer Burke,
He was bom at Galway, County Galway,
Ireland, in the same house as his pre-
decessor and where the Burke family still
lives. Only after repeated inquiries did
he find somebody to tell him that the
group is at the corner of Spring and
Evelyn streets, opposite the Dental Hospi-
tal,
Captain H. J. Buchanan, D. 5.0.,
R.A.N., is on his way in the Orion to
attend the Imperial Defence ■ College. A
gunnery man, he was Deputy Chief of
Naval Staff and later captained the
Australia, of which before the war
he was gunnery-jack.
“Trinco”; Communists have succeeded in
beating Chiang Kai-shek almost to his knees —•
a position the Japs never managed. Though
the General is assured of his place in history,
he is still little known inside and outside his
enormous country, and even, less understood —
though this itself is easily enough understand-
able. He is the man of complete contradictions.
He is called the unifier of his country, the
scourge of Communists: China is ravaged, by
civil war and its Communists were never stronger.
“Liberator” and “champion of democracy”
were his commonest appellations, yet Chiang
is the boss —of the army, the party and the
Government. Thin, but of a whipcord wiriness,
he was born to wealth and married more when
he was 15. He studied at China’s military col-
lege, crossed to Japan and there joined Dr. Sun
Yat Sen’s revolutionary movement. When in
1927 he married Soong Mei-ling, sister of Dr.
Sun’s widow (what happened to the first wife
is not clear), it was inevitable that this team,
the wily soldier and his clever, American-
educated wife, should arrange for the filling of
Dr. Sun’s empty saddle in 1928. For 20 years the
two have been fighters. When in 1936 Chiang’s
2 1.C., Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang, shot down
his personal bodyguard and took Chiang prisoner
and for 13 days his life depended on a whim,
Mei-ling flew to him in prison to share his
fate. An attribute about which there is no
contradiction is Chiang’s stubbornness in the
face of disaster, and it might be worth remem-
bering today that in all the warring years, even
when the Japs,had overrun his capital, major
cities, shipping lines and coastal industries,
Chiang Kai-shek never accepted a bid for peace.

ship’s doctor of the new Chinese ship
Soochow, lately arrived in Australia. But
the Doctor’s main interest is in skele-

disclosed, returned that night with an
Bft. mirror which, until then, had faith-
fully reflected the life of the local esta-
minet. The artist has come a long
way since then. He has exhibited at the
Royal Academy and New English Art
Club, London, and is represented in the
principal galleries in Australia and the
Metropolitan Museum in New York. A
happy cove full of life and normalcy,
the artist is farmer first, and couldn’t get
back to his harvesting quickly enough.
“Standby’s” tribute:
Dr. P. H, Macindoe, namesake of that other
famous plastic surgeon in England, is doing a
splendid job patchmg up war-wrecks in Green-
slopes Repat. Hospital, Brisbane. Plastic sur-
gery is a long, painful process, and a man needs
great confidence and a personal liking for his
surgeon to keep coming back for more. A
lively geniality and ability to wade into the
Diggers in their own language—he was a major
with a New Guinea hospital in the last scrap—
plus a record of remarkable “reconstructions,”
make Macindoe’s patients view him in the
nature of a god. In addition to some pretty
work on my empty eye-socket, he , did an ex-
ceptionally fine job on the scarre’d and dis-
figured face of an ex-p.o.w. of the Japs, giving
him in six operations a new face that kept him
in admiration before a mirror most of the day
his bandages came off. The English Macindoe’s
patients eiilogised their savior in verse: I’d
like to add our plastic-ward ode to tire local
boy:
A nose that once saw service on a hip,
A soft and hairless belly now an upper-lip.
A fleshy piece of leg, left upper rear,
Falls ’neath the scalpel into an ear;
While here we lie and watch our features grow
And hail our re-creator —Macindoe,
W. A. Brennan, who lately emerged
from retirement to discuss early Federal
pplitics in The Bulletin, when he heard
from Mcßeath that his article had been
published, cheerfully remarked: “Never
mind, it’ll do for my obituary.” He looks
as if he were still a long way off
W. A. BRENNAN, journalist from
retirement.
qualifying for that notice. His alert
mind, his interesting cultural, literary and
political background before his retirement
10 years ago and his continuous reading
are likely to keep him going for a long
time. As a lad he joined the public ser-
vice and stayed there, until Edward Cun-
ningham (now 90 and still full of beans)
spotted his journalistic talent and took
him on to the “Argus.” Brennan retired 38
years later as chief leader-writer. In 1920
he represented his paper on the second
Imperial Press Conference at Ottawa.
While the Federal Parliament held its
sessions in Spring-street, Melbourne, he
sat continuously in the gallery, and in
1910 accompanied Deakin on his last big
election tour, which stretched from Ade-
laide to Rockhampton. He was recently
elected president of the Melbourne Savage
Club after a membership of 38 years.
Abbott, J., wjio succeeds S. Talbot
Smith on the Adelaide Public Library
Board, was born in N.S.W., studied law
at the University of California, and was
admitted to the S.A. Bar in 1914. Later
politics claimed him, and he was Play-
ford’s Education Minister until appoint-
ment to the Supreme Court Bench in
1946. Right in his element talking to a
book club or literary society, he can also,
if required, deliver an informative treatise
on lacrosse or tennis.
One of the lighter aspects of Stafford
Cripps’s recent financial mission to
America was saying a few words in tribute
to Charlie Browne, an 80-year-old, digni-
fied American negro who has reached
his 60th anniversary as British Embassy
messenger in Washington, The Ambas-
sador, Sir Oliver Frank, presented Browne
with autographed, photographs of the
King and Queen, the King’s Medal for
Service in the Cause of Freedom, a
framed portrait of Ernest Bevin and a
cheque for 650 dollars from Embassy
friends. Browne started work at the
Embassy in 1888, when Baron Sackville
was Ambassador, and has looked after
the majls and confidential messages of
15 British envoys. When the King and
Queen visited the U.S.A. in 1939 he was
presented and later awarded the B.E.M.
C. L. Burns, who will be Vic-
toria’s Rhodes scholar for 194*9, is a
23-year-old son of Crayton Burns, of the
“Age,” one of the best-known journalists
in Melbourne, A cadet journalist when
he enlisted as a radar operator in the
R.A.N. in the late war, young Burns went
back to history studies at Melbourne
Uni. —he will continue them at Oxford.
He was co-editor of “Farrago,” the
students’ paper, and got his half-blue at
hockey. He spent his four years of war
service in H.M.A. ships Australia, Warr-
nambool and Nepal, saw fighting in New
Guinea and was at the Nippon landing.
Australian Scotch Colleges have a par-
tiality for Maorilanders steeped in the
traditions of the Land o’ Cakes an’ Par-
ritch. John Angus Dunning, an M.L.
Rhodes scholar for 1925, for the past
decade Rector of Scots College, Warwick
(Q.), is going to Adelaide Scots as head.
He was maths and science master at John
McGlashan College, Dunedin, before
appointment to Warwick.
“Ek Dum’s” farewell:
In Major-General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan,
dead at 80 in his native Scotland, the old
A.I.F. lost one of its toughest and best com-
manders. At the time of his death he had been
just short of 60 years in the Army, having
joined the First Borderers in 1889 and become
their adjutant during the Boer War, after ser-
vice in Waziristan in 1894-95. He was severely
wounded, .and, having taken a great liking to
the Australians during that show, he imme-
diately afterwards came to join the N. S. Wales
forces. One campaign which he brought off
here resulted in the capture of his C.-in-C.’s
daughter, Kathleen French. He returned when
the Commonwealth Defence scheme was framed,
to become Director of Drill under Bridges at
the R.M.C. and thus to help lay the foundation
of Duntroon. Bridges chose him to command
the Third Brigade in the A.I.F.—-Victorians,
S. Australians and West Australians, made up
largely of miners and bushmen, who suited his
salty, tough and humorous mentality very well.
He Was a shrewd, collected and determined
leader in battle, one who invariably knew how
many beans made five, and was never afraid
to speak his mind. His memory will always
be associated with two events in particular—
the landing battle at Anzac and the planning
and operation of the Battle of Hamel, when
he had command of the Fourth Australian
Division. After that war he commanded the
51st Scottish Division, which, under the much-
beloved Fortune, later covered itself with glory
in its retreat across France in 1940. It was
captured, but was reborn to fight beside the
Ninth Division, A.1.F., at Alamein.
Awarded the Moxon gold medal of the
Royal College of Physicians for the most
distinguished service in a triennial period
to clinical medicine, Prof. Neil Fairley,
C.8.E., is the brilliant Melburnian who,
when an obscure Army medico in New
Guinea, succeeded by shock methods in
getting past the brasshats to the ear of
General Blarney. Convinced that Fairley
had the sqnswer to the malarial scourge
which had already cost him a battalion.
Blarney then waived regulations and gave
the young man the celebrated “Fairley
Priority,” which, equal to his own,
enabled him to transport bis serums to
the front line, where he believed the
disease should be tackled. On one
occasion an officious sergeant-major pre-
vented the doctor from boarding a wait-
ing plane. While they were arguing it
took off. To Fairley’s unprintable com-
ment the s.-m. replied with the calm of
self-righteousness: “You couldn’t have
climbed into that one even if you were
Tom Blarney himself. That plane is
‘Fairley’s Priority.’ ” For a time Tata
Professor of Medicine at Bombay, Fairley
was tropical consultant to the forces in
the M.E. as well as New Guinea, and in
1943 took charge of the. school of tropical
medicine in London. He is 57.
Into the silence; —-
At Blacktown (N.5.W.),, at 65, Arthur
Leonard Francis, for 23 years a councillor
from whose interest both town and locals
benefited considerably. He served with the
Coldstream Guards in the Boer War. Diggers
old and new remember-his helping hand.
In England, at 69, Baron Strathspey, 31st
chieftain of the Clan Grant and second son
of the 10th Earl of Seafield, who came into
the title while living in Oamaru, M.L. In
turn a truck-driver, potato-digger, fisherman
and bailiff, the earl died six months after suc-
ceeding to the title, and his eldest son James
stepped into his shoes. He was killed while
with the Cameron Highlanders in the first war.
His daughter, whose mother was a Christchurch
woman, collected vast estates and Castle Grant
with the title. Baron Strathspey got little from,
the estate and fought for more, but the trustees
were deaf to his claims. On one occasion his
appeal for a set of bagpipes befitting the chief
of the Clan Grant brought the unsympathetic
reply that if the baron wanted to learn music
he’d better stick to the fiddle.
In Melbourne, at 65, Felici Gagliardi, known
to musicians throughout Australia as the finest
instrument-repairer in the country. His violin
hospital in Carlton received patients from every
State and,he was one of the few harp-repairers
in Australia. He owned many valuable violins,
including a Guarnerius.
At Stratford (M.L.), at 80, Dr. Andrew
Carver, author 4 of the medical history of the
Ist N.Z. Expeditionary Force. A native of
Dungarven (Ireland), he practised at Stratford
for 13 years, returned to Dublin for further
study in 1912 and served with the R.A.M.C.
and the N.Z. Medical Corps in the First World
War, collecting a C.B.E. At the end he was
M.O. in charge of treatments for the War
Pensions Board.
In Melbourne, at 67, L. J. Watson, one of
the best-known soldier-journalists of the 1914
war; he was wounded at Yillers Bretonneux.
His inkywayfaring started with the Barrier
“Miner” and ended with the Melbourne
“Herald.”


Women’s Letters
From Sydney
At a rough guess there were about 5000
keen followers of the England versus
New South Wales cricket match at the
Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday. A
lot of the spectators were men, too. They
say this women’s cricket-match was worth
watching, but to them women’s bowling
and batting still look a little strange.
Molly Hide is England’s captain, and
Molly Dive captains the N.S.W. team.
The English girls wear cream flannel
skirts and blazers, the home team has
navy blazers and white cotton skirts.
Former well-known English cricketer
Betty Archdale, now principal of the
Women’s College within the University,
is president of the N.S.W. Women’s
Cricket Association, and it was she who
received the guests at the party given on
Friday by the N.S.W. association to the
visitors. On Sunday Mrs. A. L. Holt,
life member of the Women’s Hockey
Association, and a former vice-president,
entertained both teams to lunch at her
Whale Beach home. Star performances
in Saturday’s game were given by Dorothy
McEvoy (bowler) of the English team,
and Mrs. Bowe (Florence McLintock) for
N.S.W, Yesterday the English team left
for Brisbane. . ,
A pretty bonnet could not have cost
£4 10s. in the Paris that Henri Miirger
tells us of in “La Boheme.” For the poet
Rudolfo could never have bought his dear
little Mimi one at that price. And how
entrancing she looked wearing it above
her poor check frock when she supped
with him and his friends in the cafe
scene. You felt glad looking at the group
that h.c.l. had not become the octopus it
now is. But, on the other hand, Colline
pawning his topcoat in Paris today would
get about three times more. Tiny Rina
Malatrasi is such a Mimi as the author
had in mind when he created his story.
This delicate flower-maker herself re-
sembled a snow-drop.
- Though women came to “La Boheme”
to sigh, they wore their best frocks to
do so. The touch of summer in the air
brought out diaphanous fabrics. Lace
walked supreme. There were lace frocks
with a graceful sweep of fullness to the
back of the skirt; lace frocks, tiered and
bouffant, in white, black and parchment.
There was a vogue for brocade, too. Fur
capes and jackets were worn, though
the night was warm. After all, if one
possesses sable or mink it would be a
wrench not to snuggle into it though it
were the Judgment Day.
The ’groom, the best man and the
groomsmen were all doctors when Dr.
Frank Leventhal, of Sydney Hospital,
married Olga Barrington, of Ufinarra,
North Coast, last Saturday. Not only
that, but the bride and her three attend-
ants were all Sydney Hospital sisters.
Olga wore a sherbet of white lace and
tulle. Hail-spot muslin frocks, ballerina
style, and crownless wide-brimmed white
hats were worn by the bridesmaids. St.
James’s, in King-street, blessed the part-
nership.
As near as could be to the minute
when Gwen Wilkinson, of Kirribilli, was
being wed before the altar of Trinity
Church, in Sutton, Surrey, England, her
parents, the J. D. Wilkinsons, surrounded
by a company of family friends and
Gwen’s girl and boy pals, drank a toast
to her happiness. Gwen is now Mrs,
Eric Barker, and her bridegroom is man-
ager of the British India Tobacco Com-
pany, in Bombay. When the Kirribilli
girl was travelling to England to take up
a job in the Bank of N.S.W., Eric joined
the ship at Bombay. After that romance
replaced high finance in Gwen’s thoughts.
She was married from the Sutton home
of the parents-in-law of her sister, Mrs.
Pat Herne.
Notable at the late-afternoon party in
honor of the Symphony Orchestra and
its leader, Eugene Goossens, was the
clean-cut simplicity of the flower arrange-
ments. Mrs. Charles Lloyd Jones, now
a member of the executive committee,
had conjured poetry from great white
pottery bowls filled with long stems of
white and purple-red gladioli and the
blues of delphinium. Mrs. Rupert Scam-
mell and Mrs. George White also brought
artistry to the decorations in the big
A.B.C. studio in Darlinghurst-road,
King’s Cross. From Mrs. C. J. Crane’s
and from Mrs. Sydney Herring’s garden
came a swag of deep-red roses, and from
Mrs. Harold Bott’s all the pansies that
trailed along the buffet tables.
Chief Justice Jordan’s wife, who is
president of the committee, received the
guests with Mrs. Hope Gibson. On the
jacket of Mrs. Eugene Goossens’s black
crepe suit was a stole effect of leopard-
skin. Sidonie Goossens wore gilt sandals
with her brown-and-white-patterned silk
dress. There was a spate of congratula-
tions for Mrs. Hope Gibson and Mrs.
Walter Swinson, who at the annual meet-
ing of the committee earlier in the after-
noon had been elected life-members.
One of the happy before-Christmas
parties of last week was given by Mrs.
H. J. Brady in the Royal Sydney Yacht
Squadron at Kirribilli. Many of the
guests were office-bearers and committee-
members of the English-Speaking Union,
of which Mrs. Brady is a committee-
woman. Feature of the afternoon was the
impromptu programme played by clever
pianist Mrs. Harry Twigden.
The girl in this Norton Trevaire photo-
graph is Marcia Moses, one of the Junior
Group working for the Christmas party
in aid of the Kindergarten Union. This
will be held on the thirteenth of this
month at Prince’s, amid an absolute
forest of Christmas-trees, and other sea-
sonable decor made by the active mem-
bers of the committee.
Prince Axel of Denmark is due in Syd-
ney on the Tlth of this month. The
Prince, who is a kinsman of our own
Royal family, is reported 60 (but doesn’t
look it) and a delightful companion. He
is not travelling as Royalty at all, but as
a businessman —he is chairman of direc-
tors of the East Asiatic Company of Den-
mark. At the airfield to greet the Prince
will be a group in which Danish
Consul-General Hergel and his wife and
the Peter Kochs will be front-rankers.
He will come from America by way of
Singapore, and his first big function will
be a super-cocktail party given by the
Danish Association at the Pickwick Club.
The Consular Henning Hergels are send-
ing out invitations for a supper-party at
their Edgecliff home. He will be enter-
tained by Governor-General McKell and
Denmark’s Minister in Canberra. A deep-
sea fishing expedition is also among en-
joyments listed.
A party which Prince Axel will really
enjoy is the Yuletide dinner planned by
the Peter Koch couple. (He is managing-
director of the E.A. Co.) In Denmark all
families hold festival on Christmas Eve.
Then the Christmas-tree and its gifts
are the glittering centre of attraction. All
the dishes included in a Danish Yuletide
dinner will be served by Mrs. Koch:
Goose with pineapple, and red cabbage,
caramel potatoes, rice cooked in milk,
sugar, cinnamon and almonds and the
traditional Danish apple-layer cake. And
ac the end there will be carols around the
tree. Mrs. Koch has already picked her
frock. It will be of ivory-taffeta flowered
in pinks, blues and yellows.
This Letter liked the flower paintings
of Margaret Stones, now being shown in
the Grosvenor Galleries. So did the
National Gallery, which bought two of
the present exhibition. Mrs. Darling, of
Macquarie-street, bought another of the
fragile beauties. These pictures depend
on no accessories for appeal—they are a
simple, direct statement in petal, stem
and leaf. They have been painted with
meticulous care. The artist, well-known
in Melbourne, was encouraged during a
protracted convalescence, in the pursuit of
flower-painting by artist Daryl Lindsay,
Miss Florence Patterson, of Maoriland,
was the only Enzed University graduate
at the Women Graduates’ Association
party at Sydney University last week.
Miss Patterson was one-time deputy-
headmistress of Epsom Girls’ Grammar,
Auckland. With her were Mrs. V. A.
Bailey, whose husband is Professor of
Physics, and Mrs. Keith Bullen, wife of
the Professor of Mathematics at Sydney
Uni, There was only one man among
the hundred or so Minervas. He was
Professor D. R. Peart, of the Chair of
Music. He and his wife were guests-of-
honor.
From Melbourne
The State Drawing-room at Govern-
ment House was decorated with bowls
of pastel-tinted hydrangeas, lupins,
gladioli and Christmas-lilies when Sir
Winston and Lady Dugan enter-
tained at a late-afternoon party in honor
of the Governor-General of New Zea-
land, Sir Bernard Freyberg, and Lady
Freyberg. Lady Dugan set off her softly-
draped black crepe frock with diamond
clips and a spray of gardenias. Lady
Freyberg’s turquoise-blue frock had
three-quarter-length sleeves, the skirt
being diagonally draped; her small tur-
quoise-blue hat had a cluster of match-
ing flowers set at the front. Marshal of
the R.A.F., Lord Sholto Douglas, was
accompanied by Air-Marshal George
Jones and Mrs. Jones. Rear-Admiral
John Collins and Mrs, Collins were
there, she in a black frock contrasted
with a natural-straw hat banded and
edged with black velvet. The Premier
of Victoria, T. T. Hollway, and Mrs.
Hollway were with Mr. and Mrs. W. S.
Kent Hughes. The Lady Mayoress, Mrs.
Disney, wore a black silk jacket-suit with
a blouse and facings of pastel-blue and
a black osprey-trimmed hat. Mrs.
Harold Holt’s brown-and-black-check
taffeta frock was worn with a wide-
brimmed toast-toned straw hat. Tiny
sea-shells trimmed the natural-straw
cloche hat which Mrs. R. G. Casey wore
with her periwinkle-blue silk frock. Lady
Herring’s frock of black crepe had a fine
Chantilly-lace yoke.
Water-lilies and a wide variety of
summer blooms decorated the Town Hall
rooms for the civic reception in honor of
Sir Bernard and Lady Freyberg. The
sole embellishment on Lady Freyberg’s
maize-yellow crepe frock was a diamond
clip ; a brooch in her dark-brown coarse-
straw hat was in the shape of the em-
blematic silver fern-leaf. The Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. J. S. Disney, allied a slim-
fitting jacket of powder-blue crepe with a
black skirt; her wide-brimmed upswept
hat was of black French felt. Five
former Lady Mayoresses were present;
Lady Wales, Lady Beaurepaire, Lady
Gengoult Smith, Mrs. Beatrice Campbell
and Mrs. Bernard Heinze. Lady Brookes,
who has just returned from England,
wore a hat of pastel-blue silk straw with
her black jersey-silk frock. Mrs. Arthur
Wenzel’s black crepe frock was slim-
fitting. Mrs. Dermot Connelly added a
black-and-white-striped taffeta hat to her
grey suit. Mrs. B. J. McConnan matched
her beige frock with a hip-length jacket;
her large upturned beige straw hat had
brown ribbon trimmings. Mrs. Len
Buxton’s frock was of patterned blue,
white and gold ; her royal-blue straw hat
was trimmed with ribbons to match the
color print of her frock and matching
jacket,
Josephine Rienits, wife of Rex Rienits,
who is the producer of Clifford Odets’s
“Golden Boy,” due to open its Tin Alley
Players’ season at the Union Theatre
next Saturday, has appeared in several
Tin Alley productions, but mostly her
talents have been concentrated on be-
hind-the-stage work, particularly the cos-
tumes. This is the final association of
Jo and Rex with the Tin Alley Players
before they leave on a trip early in the
New Year to London, where Rex is
having a book published. Jo hopes to do
some stage work while in England.
Toorak Presbyterian Church was the
venue for the exchange of vows by
Alison Mary, younger daughter of Mrs.
Campbell, of Toorak, and the late Mr.
John Dewar Campbell, and Dr. Leslie
McNeil, only son of Engineer-Rear-
Admiral and Mrs. McNeil, of Toorak.
The bride’s cream-and-gold brocade gown
had a fitted bodice and long sleeves. The
shaped hipline of the skirt flowed into a
. graceful train. A finger-tip tulle veil was
surmounted by a circlet of orange-
blossom. The ivory-bound Bible carried
by the bride had been carried by her
mother and sister on their wedding days.
Dr. J. R. Darling, of Corio, gave his
sister-in-law away, and his schoolgirl
daughters, jane and Elizabeth', whose
Jong frocks were of primrose organdie,
were bridesmaids; posies of primroses
matched the wreaths worn in their hair.
The reception was held at No. 9 Darling-
street.
Knowing how difficult lunching in town
with children can be during the school
holidays, the Y.W.C.A. committee has
made plans to cope with it. The Y.W.
cafeteria in Russell-street, City, will pre-
pare special meals for mothers and chil-
dren. Morning- and afternoon-tea will
be served as well as hot or cold
luncheons; ice-cream and soft-drinks will
be available. Baby-bottles may be heated,
and a rest-room will be provided for tired
mothers and weary children.
At the Victoria League clubrooms the
president of the Food for Britain Com-
mittee, Mrs. Raymond Barker, gave an
afternoon-tea party for regular donors of
parcels. In a short speech thanking the
donors, not all of whom are necessarily
club members, Mrs. Barker revealed that
many people also made gifts of money,
which enabled the committee to send
parcels to people on their lists and for
whom, so far, there were no sponsors.
More sponsors are urgently needed by
the League to send parcels to old-age
pensioners, retired schoolteachers, nurses
and governesses in Britain. Another
phase of the work done by the Victoria
League committee is the sending of food
parcels to branches of the League in
London, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Oxford
and other cities for the use of hostesses
who entertain overseas visitors through
the auspices of the League. Inquiries can
be made to Miss Alice Murphy, secretary
of the Victoria League’s Food for Britain
Committee, Collins-street, Melbourne.
The Miss Australia Quest for 1948 is
in its final stages, and one of the last
formal functions was the afternoon-tea
party which the Lady Mayoress, Mrs. J,
S. Disney, gave to over 30 metropolitan
candidates. Mrs. Disney, who was in
a black suit and small black hat, was
assisted by her daughter-in-law, Mrs.
Alec Hay, whose ensemble was also black.
Judy Gainford, last year’s Miss Aus-
tralia, wore a black frock with a creamy
lace bodice ; her fur scarf was of white
mink. Among a host of other guests were
Elizabeth Taylor, in a navy ensemble,
Louise Reed, in an off-white linen suit,
and Olive Copsi, the matching hat she
wore with her navy frock having offsetting
touches of red.
Opera-lovers flocked to the premieite at
the Princess of the National Theatre’s
latest offering, Wagner’s “Flying Dutch-
man.” The green-and-gold brocade gown
worn by Pamela Knox was covered with
a beige-fox bolero. Mrs. Ken Myer’s
turquoise-blue wool evening coat was a
notable sartorial touch. A scarlet gold-
embroidered hip-length jacket was worn
by Lady Knox over her creamy satin
gown. Of sea-green satin was the slim-
fitting gown of Mrs. Sam Wood. Filmy
black lace, the pattern outlined with tiny
jet beads and teamed with black taffeta,
was Mrs. Garnet Carroll’s choice. Silver
filigree buttons brightened the black
crepe gown worn by Mrs. Errol Knox.
Floral chiffons and white ermine dis-
tinguished Mrs. Herbert Pacini. Gertrude
Johnson trimmed her black gown with
silver embroideries.
In her final-curtain speech on the
opening night of the second Ballet pre-
sentation, Madame Rambert said her
company had been so long in this city
that the Yarra was now beginning to look
like the Thames—a statement which pro-
voked much laughter in the audience.
Ambng the well-dressed balletomanes
were Mrs. Fred Dennett, whose parma-
violet chiffon gowA had many bouffant
tiers in the skirt and a decollete bodice of
fichu drapery; Mrs. Desmond Barring-
ton, in sun-glow lace over cream taffeta ;
Mrs. W. H. McKechnie, a silver-fox cape
over her sage-green satin gown; Mrs.
A. Athorn, in a bouffant off-the-shoulder
gown of black marquisette; Gay Money,
a scarlet pearl-embroidered hip-length
jacket covering her white evening gown ;
and Mrs. Lester Bunbury, her gown of
deep-green taffeta.
At the late-afternoon party given by
Air-Marshal George Jones and Mrs.
Jones at Air Force Headquarters Mess
in honor of Lord Douglas of Kirtleside,
Marshal of the R.A.F., Mrs. Jones re-
ceived her guests wearing a black crepe
ankle-length frock with a Chantilly-lace
yoke; her toast-toned straw hat was
banded in black velvet. Mrs. F. M.
Bladin’s aqua-blue crepe frock was em-
broidered in crystal beads ; her small hat
was made of blue roses and cerise
feathers. Mrs. E. C. Wackett’s powder-
blue crepe frock had the skirt draped, the
neckline of the bodice outlined with
diamente; her pastel-blue straw hat was
trimmed with pink and blue roses. Mrs.
C. R. Gallwey, whose husband,, Flt.-
Lieutenant Gallwey, is personal aide to
Air-Marshal Jones, wore a green-and-
mauve floral-patterned frock and matched
the ribbons in her black hat with her
frock. Ruth Tyrwhitt-Drake’s ballerina
frock was of black moire taffetas.

Its attempt to nationalise the private
trading banks having failed to pass the
test of constitutionality before the High
Court, the Federal Government has taken
the matter to the Privy Council, where it
is listed for hearing on March 14 next.
Even if the Privy Council (1) decides
that, in the absence of a certificate from
the High Court granting leave to appeal,
it can go ahead with the case, and (2) up-
holds the Government’s appeal in respect
of Section 46 of its Banking Act, 1947,
amending legislation will still be needed
to repair other invalidated sections of
the Act. In view of the approaching elec-
tions, due toward the close of next year,
and the possibility of yet further litiga-
tion, hopes are that the question of
nationalising the private banks will yet
be one for decision by the people them-
selves. They never have been honestly
consulted on this vital question, which
contains the threat of subordinating every
form of industrial activity to political ex-
pediency, operating through one all-com-
pelling channel.
The small but robust Bank of Adelaide
set up in South Australia 83 years ago,
and, apart from a London office, two in
Westralia and one in each of the eastern
State capitals, it has never stepped out-
side its home territory. Its figures there-
fore mainly reflect conditions in South
Australia. Here nature has been kind of
recent years, fat prices have been obtained
for most primary products and livestock,
industries have sprung up, old ones
have expanded and trade generally has
been at a high level. Mainly because of
all this the board decided that £250,000
of the sum provided for contingencies—
lumped with deposits, etc., in the pub-
lished accounts —could be safely trans-
ferred to visible reserves, now £62,269 in
excess of the £1,250,000 of paid capital.
The inflationary conditions at work, in-
cluding Government extravagance, have
led to liquidity in trade and industry and
economy in the use of bank funds. Last
term a growth of £3,576,757 in deposits,
etc., was accompanied by a contraction
of £382,113 in advances and expansion
of £4,217,731 in low-interest-bearing
liquids:

Liquids include £7,218,000 on special
account with the Commonwealth Bank at
10s. p.c., £2,350,000 of Commonwealth
Treasury bills at 1 p.c., and £1,328,514 of
Commonwealth Government securities
averaging, say, about p.c. The co. is
thus assisting the Government to the tune
of £10,896,514, or £4,792,566 more than
it had advanced to trade and industry,
which it is well equipped to further assist,
subject to central-bank control, as soon
as the need arises. When the books closed
liquids were 79.8 p.c. and advances only
30.5 p.c. of deposits, etc.
Despite the drop in advances and
continued rise in costs, declared
profit was £9157 stronger at £89,127, best
showing for the last 17 years. Appear-
ances are that the improvement came
mainly from the investment basket. How-
ever, the cautious board considered the
outlook good enough to lift the div.
from 5i p.c. to 7 p.c., the final being at
the rate of 8 p.c. p.a., maintenance of
which would call for £10,873 more profit
than claimed last term.
The £lO shares paid to £5 each —the
other £5 is a reserve liability callable only
if needed on liquidation—are to be split
into £1 stock units, which will carry the
same rights and liabilities proportionally
as the shares did. Smaller capital units
will bring the scrip within reach of a
wider range of investors, strengthen
market support and widen ownership of
the bank.
The shares recently fetched £8 15s.
(£7 19s. a couple of months ago), making
the pound stock units worth 355., at which
figure the return is 4 p.c. on a 7 p.c. div.
basis. Net tangible cover is visibly
41s. 2d. per pound of paid capital.

Fish from all quarters of the globe
swim into the net of this prosperous 76-
year-old Auckland fi£e, marine and
accident co. A few years ago only about
one-fifth of the income was gathered in
the Dominion, one-third or more in Aus-
tralia and the balance, which has grown
considerably since the war, from risks ac-
cepted in U.K., Canada, U.S., Africa,
Middle East, India, Pakistan and
eastern Asia, Among other things, the
co. is, therefore, a handsome contributor
to the Dominion’s invisible balance of
payments.
Last term the business kept on expand-
ing, and the underwriting experience was
favorable. The contraction of £70,257
in profit and reduction of £1,0.36,892 in
reserves was the result of the recent ap-
preciation in the exchange value of the
N.Z. pound in terms of sterling upon
both income from and the value of assets
held abroad —the accounts are in N.Z.
currency. Expansion of the business
(this was most marked in the two
Indian Dominions, East Asia and Africa)
was, therefore, more pronounced than
the growth of £141,220 in net premiums
suggests. Helpful factors were livelier
trade, rising prices and full employment:

The loss ratio, to which cargo pilfer-
age, the unsatisfactory nature of motor-
vehicle insurance and the disastrous fire
at Ballantynes, Christchurch (N.Z.), con-
tributed, was 30s. p.c. heavier. But the
bigger business was written at 4s, p.c.
less cost.
Owing to heavier losses and exchange
adjustment there was a shrinkage of
£17,949 in the underwriting surplus
(£603,913) and of £52,308 in interest and
rents (£201,243). Total profit was
£70,257 less at £805,156. But that was
before allowing for unexpired risks,
which on the usually-accepted 40 p.c.
basis would reduce the underwriting sur-
plus to £547,425 and total net profit from
all sources to £748,668, which is a juicy
72.5 p.c, on capital as against 65.5 p.c.
and 51.3 p.c. for the two preceding
terms. Since the £1,031,640 of capital
has the support and assistance of
£5,234,058 of visible reserves, the year’s
profit was only 11.9 p.c. on share-
holders’ funds.
The solid protection for both policy-
holders and shareholders is in this form:

The contraction in the figures again re-
flects adjustments connected with altera-
tion of the exchange rate. It does not
affect the actual strength of the co. as an
underwriter. Broadly speaking, funds
held in various countries are sufficient
to cover risks underwritten in the areas
concerned.
What the future holds for Maoriland’s
big underwriters is difficult to say at the
moment. As boom conditions pass
losses can be expected to make off with
a greater proportion of premium in-
come, which might contract a little. The
Dominion’s Socialist Government pro-
poses to make workers’-compensation
insurance in N.Z. a State monopoly next
April. Its loss is not likely to seriously
affect S.B.’s net earnings. Nationalisa-
tion of insurance is a retrograde ‘ step,
giving insurers less efficient service at
greater cost, as experience in other parts
of the world has shown.
The market prices the f.-p. 10s. shares
at 88s. Bd., at which figure the immedi-
ate return is 2.8 p.c, on a 25 p.c. div.
basis. The investor at 88s. Bd. who looks
for no more than 3.4 p.c. on his money
counts on a 30 p.c. div., or, say, a four-
for-two bonus-scrip issue and a drop in
the div. to 10 p.c., which would then call
for £309,492.

The co. enjoys a wide goodwill—valued
in the books at £67,660 and worth a
lot more —in the high-grade furniture,
furnishing drapery, china, glassware and
kitchenware trade. Turnover in all
sections expanded last term, but which
one is the most profitable isn’t
ascertainable from the published figures.
Rising costs have bumped up the
factory price of furniture to about double
pre-war levels, while average retail prices
have risen by about 80 p.c., which means
lower retail margins. Hence increased
turnover and efficiency have become the
key to improvement in retail profit.
Abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax also
helped last term’s net earnings. After
making unspecified provision for taxa-
tion and unknown contingencies, and
allowing £1624 (down £1135) for depreci-
ation, the board wrote profit £8227
stronger at £52,330, best in the co.’s
history. It covered full contract rates
on both lots of prefs. and 11.5 p.c. on
the £381,867 of ord. capital, compared
with 9.9 p.c. and 7.7 p.c. for the two
preceding years. The ord. div. was kept
at 6 p.c, and the prefs.—3o,ooo first 7
p.c. and 52,500 second 8 p.c.—got 6 p.c.
and 6.2 p.c, respectively. The prefs. are
subject to the outmoded N.S.W. Interest
Reduction Act, under which they have
been rationed since the early 1930’5.
Their minimum rates under the Act are
5.4 p.c. and 6.2 p.c. respectively, but they
advance with the ords. beyond these
points to their full contract requirements.
As for the current term, demand in all
sections promises to continue at a high
level. Still, production and imports are
now following close on the heels of de-
mand, which means that competition can
be expected to gradually get more of
an edge on it. Much depends upon what
happens in connection with costs; they
won’t need to rise much further before
they begin to affect demand as well as
outgoings. The possibility of price
fluctuations in imported furnishing
fabrics, carpets, etc., is also a factor that
might have to be reckoned with in the
not-too-distant future. It is doubtful,
therefore, whether much, if any, further
improvement in net earnings need to
expected.

The larger stocks (up £110,716) are partly
the result of bigger trading and partly
a hedge against the current up-trend of
prices and delays in delivery. Book debts
(down £2677) are moderate. The addi-
tion of £60,600 to freeholds follows pur-
chase of a factory and warehouse pro-
perty previously rented. To meet outlay
£145,476 was added to the outside debt.

The present co., which took over
the Edments chain of gift-stores in 1936,
has been sailing with fair-weather trade-
winds most of the time, but its advance
is still remarkable. The original four
branches have been joined by another five
•—nearly all are freehold, and they are
represented in each capital city; paid
capital has risen from £35,000 to
£224,000, with an application for a
further increase now in the hands of the
Treasury ; and nothing less than a 10 p.c.
dividend has gone to ordinary share-
holders since the second year of the
co.’s life. Until recently, however, this
dividend policy has been somewhat
sanguine in relation to profits earned.
All the increased capital was issued at
par, and there is still scope for the policy
of strengthening reserves which the board
has followed since 1946.
Last term a second store at Prahran
(Vic.) was opened, while the Sydney
branch was transferred from leased
premises in George-street to the co.’s
freehold in King-street. The mov-
ing caused some dislocation of Sydney
turnover, but the board is confident that
it will be justified by results henceforth.
The £6121 improvement in the latest
net profit suggests that general turnover
was well maintained:

114 years of
service to the
Wheat Industry
WHEN this Bank was founded in 1834 Australia
had a comparatively small acreage under wheat. By
1850 the figure had grown to 491,000 acres. To-day
the area may vary according to the season and ruling
price from 13-20 million acres.
Most of our wheat producers started with little
capital and even those with what seemed like adequate
funds have needed “ finance” from time to time.
For 114 years this Bank has catered to these needs.
For 114 years its funds and its services to its customers
have been* an important factor in the production of
Australia’s greatest crop.
The Bank has the funds and the desire to continue
this service.

Gold
“Cambist” writes: —■
One of the most unsatisfactory
features of Australia’s post-war his-
tory is failure of the goldmining in-
dustry to recover. This is due not to
any technical, financial or other fault
in the industry itself, but to the
absence of any adjustment in the
official buying price of gold in the
face of a steep rise in operating costs,
a substantial part of which promises
to be permanent. It is an anomalous
position, rectification of whidi lies
basically with U.S. and International
Monetary Fund, in which U.S. has
a predominating influence.
At end Jan., 1934, U.S. authorities,
having found that the paper dollar
had lost much of its value in relation
to the gold dollar, reduced the weight
of fine gold in the dollar from 1.50463
grammes to 0.88867 grammes, and
raised the buying price of the yellow
metal from $20.67 to $35 per fine
ounce. A similar position obtains
today, and, so far as the goldmining
industry is concerned, the effective
remedy is the same. Yet, because of
possible widespread inflationary effects,
U.S. authorities' show no sign of
taking such a step. Meanwhile, the
imports we get from U.S. are in-
voiced in terms of paper dollars. So
far as we are unable to settle the
bill by exports of merchandise, we
have to pay in gold. According to
recent arbitrage transactions on the
Paris market, this gold is worth about
double the number of paper dollars
we receive for it.
Many find it difficult to understand
an American policy full of enthusiasm
for free enterprise and free competi-
tion which at the same time fails to
align the official price of gold with
world conditions, especially since the
I.M.F. makes gold the keystone 9!
the world’s monetary arch. Britain
is now the recipient of all Australian
gold production. And since future
production goes beyond purely in-
vestment considerations, the question
of a substantial increase deserves a
higher place in the Commonwealth’s
economic agenda than it now enjoys.

SUNDRY SHOWS
BOTANY AND ART.
The walls of the Grosvenor
Galleries, Sydney, are lined with
botanical specimens, neatly
framed flowers and weeds of dis-
creet and gorgeous colors painted
carefully on white paper by
Margaret Stones. In one corner
is the Utricularia hookeri—col-
loquially known as Hooker’s
bladder-wort a frail-looking
plant with little purple flowers
balanced on slim green-and-
purple stems, ending in roots of
a delicate hairiness and nodes.
Below the painting is the beauti-
fully-printed information:
Small bladders attached to the roots
are used by the plant to trap minute
animal life.
The artist’s main object, it
would appear, is not artistic but
botanical. There are other
specimens Chamcelaucium
uncimtum (Geraldton wax
plant) Anigozanthus biridis
(swamp kangaroo plant) and
plain pink petunia and clear
apple - blossom. Plain and
latinised, all are pleasant, in-
formative and graceful. Apart
from the botanical information,
the general effect is pleasing.
Plants, too, are beautiful. If
there is only a pale and elusive
thread of poetic observation in
Margaret Stones’s paintings of
them, there is, at least, a certain
cold beauty in the exact record of
their colors and growth. There is
a place for such painting, some-
where in the border territory
between art and science, and in
the fine and delicate analysis of
stalk and foliage there is evi-
dence, not of the diamond-like
brilliance of art, but ofrthe attri-
butes of art —fine discernment
and skilled craftsmanship.
Of the craftsmanship there can
be no doubt. Margaret Stones’s
paintings gain from the fact that
she paints well within her
powers. If an artist paints in
oils the body of a woman which
looks like iron, the artistic
result is commonly awful. But a
skilled craftsman, working in
metal, can make an object of
enduring beauty.
That truth of mediums is
applicable to design. Painters
of flowerpieces often produce
groups of mere botanical interest.
Margaret Stones, painting
botanical specimens, has flashes
of artistic achievement.
The paintings, as a whole,
bring to mind the bird paintings
of Neville Cayley. Margaret
Stones’s plants, like Cayley’s
birds, are beautiful and accurate
and dead. They could break
into life if the artist considered
the problems of art, as opposed
to those of botany and crafts-
manship. She may succeed in
keeping the two aspects of her
work distinct, but, if she does
not, her flowers and weeds, like
Neville Cayley’s birds, are
worthy of survival in their own
right.
Pareroultia.
Watercolors by Otto
Pareroultja at Anthony
Hordern’s Gallery (fourth
floor) are interesting, decorative
and uniform, the common de-
sign being a cone-shaped hill or
heap of rocks with a kind of
frilled background, or trees and
sky grouped similarly.
The colors are bright, but not
vivid, and the artist’s use of flat,
rather thick, outlines and a
secondary design in the detail of
the paintings—trees, for instance,
have trunks streaked something
after the fashion of tribal mark-
ings—give an original flavor and,
at the same time, a curious flat-
ness to the painting.
The main preoccupation is
design, and the fact that it is
not the familiar design of Aus-
tralian contemporary painters
makes the paintings more inter-
esting. But Pareroultja, a clans-
man of Albert Namatjira, is no
Namatjira. There is nothing like
Namatjira’s astonishing colors
and glittering ranges. There are,
however, competent paintings of
the same type of country, with
an individual style.
Assorted Painters.
Sidney Nolan’s taste for the
spectacular is demonstrated at a
“Christmas” exhibition at
Sydney’s Macquarie Galleries by
his “Desert Bird,” a large paint-
ing of a blood-red sky, desert
and swamp joining in blue, red
and green, and a bird, a weird
and wonderful and beautifully
comic creature, leaping right
across the picture, feet up and
head thrown back like a broad-
jumper, and wearing an expres-
sion of absurd solemnity.
The picture is colorful, bizarre
and humorous—all qualities of
Nolan’s usual work. It is a wel-
come relief to most of the other
paintings in the exhibition, which
have a distinct tendency towards
the lugubrious, the thin and the
commonplace.
George F. Lawrence’s “Com-
monwealth Street” is a fairly
large and fairly competent piece
of work, the clarity and realism
marred somewhat by a sky of
curdled milk. Sali Herman’s
“Old Warehouse” is dreary and
dingy, Jean Bellette’s “Girl at a
Window” is greasy and melan-
choly with fantastic figures off-
stage, and although Roland
Wakelin’s “Showery Weather”
and “Springtime North Ryde”
are more satisfying paintings,
with rich glimpses of the earth,
they are slight paintings.
Other exhibitors are not well
represented. The exhibition re-
sembles, not so much a
Christmas display of fruitfulness,
as a clearing-sale, and as such
provokes appropriate feelings of
melancholy.
"La Boheme."
At Sydney Tiv. on Saturday
poor Mimi ran her piteous
course and met her tragic fate,
and did it all with moving
realism. Realism is an element
so rarely bothered about in
opera that it is worth remarking
on when found. Mimi is
convincingly acted, as well as
sung, by the slender Rina Mala-
trasi, whose singing is delightful.
Her voice avoids ear-splitting
volume, but has a rich, full soft-
ness and ample power. Her
Rudolfo is done by Alvino
Misciano, with a light but very
pleasant tenor and considerably
more acting ability than opera
singers are usually wont to
bother cultivating.
The only exception to the
generally pleasing standard of
singing is Maria Huder, who, as
Musetta, strikes a little harsh at
times.
"The Flying Dutchman."
The National Opera Com-
pany’s production of “The
Dutchman,” at Melbourne Prin-
cess, caught its weird, wild,
brooding atmosphere sufficiently
well to leave the hearer with the
impression that he had been list-
ening to and looking at Wagner.
It was disconcerting to see
the shadows of Daland’s craft
and the Flying Dutchman
thrown on to the sky by a mis-
take of the gods in control of the
lighting, but the howling of the
gale, the thunder of the billows
and the tragedy of the sailor
condemned to roam the world
for ever or until some girl could
be found who would love him
faithfully unto death was con-
veyed in the music, the singing
and the drama.
Charles Skase as the doomed
skipper acted with distinction,
and gave the part a first-class
baritone, hampered in places by
a relaxed throat. The Spinning
Wheel act was brilliant. Histri-
onically and vocally Betty Fret-
well turned in a good perform-
ance as the girl obsessed with the
legend who feels predestined to
play the part of the Dutchman’s
savior.
N.S.W. Junior
Orchestra and Choir.
Apart from his admirable
policy of grounding his
orchestra in classics not beyond
their technical capacity. Profes-
sor Carl Sauer has the happy
knack of coming to light with
a work off the beaten track.
Such was Haydn’s “La Reine”
Symphony, given on the; pro-
gramme as No. 15, but in the
listing as No, 85.
Of the 104 Haydn wrote, the
ones most heard are the last 12
the Salomon symphonies,
composed in London. The “La
Reine” has grace and charm,
qualities which were empha-
sised in playing that was
generally good, with a broad
sweep achieved by the strings in
the adagio. >
The March from Handel’s
“Scipio,” the Overture to
Thomas’s “Raymond” and Wag-
ner’s “Am Stillen Herd” —the
last-named vigorous after an un-
certain attack —were examples of
works this band of keen young
players can handle mostly with
assurance and good volume of
controlled tone.
"1066 and All That."
The Kuringai Theatre Guild
is playing the stage version of
“1066 and All That” merrily
enough, but not without some
slight evidence of a struggle.
The Killara Hall is of middling
size, and the large, sprawling
farce with its 25 scenes and a
cast like an Army roll-call, plus
an orchestra, is more or less
jammed into the with a
shoehorn.
There is not, as it were, room
for voices or action to bubble
over as much as they should,
but within the physical limits of
the hall the players do a highly
creditable job, and, on the night
under review, the audience, also
packed like herrings in a sar-
dine-tin, pronounced a favor-
able verdict in no uncertain
fashion.
O. D. Bisset comperes the
show with easy comedy, al-
though he, too, needs more room
to display fully the casual strol-
ling humor with which he com-
pered the same play so success-
fully a few years ago at Sydney
Conservatorium.

Ancestors of
an Industry
Thomas Clark , a Scottish doctor, made the
important discovery that hard water can be
softened by chemical means. A common cause
of what is known as “temporary” hardness is the
presence of dissolved calcium bicarbonate. This
can be removed by boiling, the hardness being
turned into insoluble calcium carbonate —familiar
to most people as the “fur” in kettles. Temporary
hardness not only wastes soap, but is a serious
defect in water used for industrial purposes. The
“fur” deposited inside boilers and pipes reduces
their efficiency and leads to undue fuel consump-
tion. Clark discovered that the correct quantity
of lime added to temporarily hard water causes
chemical reactions which change both the lime
itself and the unwanted calcium bicarbonate into
an insoluble carbonate. This can be removed,
leaving the water soft, and suitable for use in
steam boilers and for industrial processes.
Clark was born in Ayr in 1801. Thirty years
later he obtained an M.D. at Glasgow University,
but instead of practising medicine he went to
work at the St. Rollox chemical works. In 1833
he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at
Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he remained
until his retirement twenty-seven years later. He
died in 1867, but his memory is perpetuated in
“Clark’s method” of water soften-
ing, which is still in use. All users
of water —from the power engineer
to the housewife —owe an incalcul-
able debt to Clark’s investigations.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT’S
RED MILL RUM.
Racing at Randwick on Saturday
produced a number of good Villiers
and Summer Cup trials —sufficient of
them, certainly, to interestingly com-
plicate the picking of a double which
is seldom an easy one.
The six-furlongs Varroville Handi-
cap saw San Domenico end his un-
beaten record, but a close third be-
hind Slander (W. Cook) and Filipino
was an excellent first-up effort for
a three-year-old carrying 61b. more
than weight for age, particularly since
the four-year-old Slander was carry-
ing 121 b. less than w.f.a. San
Domenico may not be quite up to
some of the ballyhoo that has been
accorded him, but he does seem a
really good horse who should win his
share of races provided his legs re-
main sound; one of his pins looks
scarcely capable of safely supporting
a gazelle.
A comparison of Varroville and
Villiers weights showed that of the
horses engaged in both races the
handicapper’s Villiers tip was Set
Purpose, weighted at 7.10 • for the
Varroville and 31b. more for the mile
race. Others had the same weight
in both races with the exception of
a couple assessed as a pound or so
better at the shorter distance. Set
Purpose finished well back in the
Varroville..
Slander, Filipino and San Domenico
each carried the same weight in the
Varroville as they have in the Vil-
liers; however, in comparison with
the w.f.a. scale Filipino will meet
the others on slightly better terms
in the Villiers and should be hard to
beat. The horse most likely to beat
him, especially if the going be softish,
is last year’s winner Barnsley, who
finished a very close fourth in Satur-
day’s race and will much prefer the
longer trip.
In assessing them for Saturday’s
mile-and-a-half Homebush Handicap,
the handicapper gave most runners
from 41b. to 61b. more than they have
in the Summer Cup; exceptions were
Gay Fault (only 21b. more in the
Homebush) and Polar Star (7.2 in
both races). ' Impressive winner of
the Homebush was the three-year-old
High Caste colt Lordly (G. Pod-
more), beating, by three-parts of a
length, the promising Bolivia, who
made his run too soon; third was
High Ideals. The three will meet
on similar terms in the Summer Cup,
but the longer journey may give the
older horses an edge on Lordly. The
Cup distance certainly will not trouble
Bolivia, and High-Ideals, it might be
remembered, ran a tip-top race in
the Metrop.^
At time of writing Lordly is
favorite for the Cup. Well down in
the betting list, however, there is an
unconsidered trifle in the shape of
Chaytor, who, a couple of years back,
was good enough to win the Hotham
Handicap carrying 8.10; he has 8.11
in the Summer Cup. After winning
the Hotham and running second in
the Williamstown Cup, Chaytor lost
form, and after running unplaced at
Rosehill in August last year was sent
for a long spell. Resuming racing
at Canterbury recently, he ran a most
promising race to finish right on the
heels of the placegetters in a Flying
Handicap which was- far too short
for him. Recovery of his old form
woul4 see Chaytor win the Summer
Cup.
The aged gelding Ever Faithful (R.
Coles) winning Saturday’s Novice
Handicap (12f.) could scarcely be
considered a Summer Cup prospect,
but, from the Villiers viewpoint, there
was merit in the effort of Mine Hosti
also ridden by Coles and carrying
a solid plaster to lead all the way in
the first Macquarie Grove Handicap
(7f.); a lightweight with a fair chance
in the Villiers. The second division
of the Macquarie Grove went to
Leetona (G. Moore).
A . couple of two-year-old events
produced some juicy tote dividends.
The grey filly Favour (N. Sellwood)
was well enough fancied for the
Greystanes Nursery, as was Tivoli
Star, whom she beat by a head, but
the Agincourt filly So Happy, finish-
ing third, paid £9 ss. 3d. Corosan
(J. Waterhouse) winning the Strath-
field Juvenile paid £23 16s. 3d. for a
win, and £4 7s. 9d. for a place, while
Flanders, who finished third behind
King’s Coin in that race, paid
£l2 7s. 9d. The mile Three-year-old
Handicap went to Montclair (A.
Thompson).
* * » *
Attendance at Caulfield on Satur-
day, despite good racing and splendid
weather, was much on the light side
for that course. Counter-attraction
to the racing was the cricket at
M.C.G., and Bradman won the Crowd
Stakes in a canter.
At Caulfield the colt to win in a
canter was Regal Scout, who may
be a really good ’un; he has
not been extended as yet. Start-
ing favorite for the Clayton Stakes
for two-year-olds, the Kinderscout
colt had the field covered all the
way and left them standing at the
finish. Though beaten three and a
half lengths by the winner, the Solar
Bear filly Sun Chick was an impres-
sive second, well ahead of Macshaw.
One wonders if the clock was not
a bit fast when Macshaw was credited
with running five furlongs in 59sec.
on the same course a couple of
weeks back.
Remarks about the old grey mare
notwithstanding, the grey filly Novam
(G. Bougoure) proved much too good
for other three-year-olds in the mile
Braeside Handicap. Showing the
colts a neat pair of heels all the way,
she won by three parts of a length
from Damon and Bartolus. Sup-
porters of the favorite Tamahine did
their money cold, the Balloch gelding
coming a cropper early in the race.
Owner O. R. Porter must be pleased
that he failed to find a buyer pre-
pared to pay 2000 guineas for Denhoti
when the horse was offered at auction
recently. Since then the Dhoti four-
“ Stand still, professor; I’ll be disqualified if I hit a
moving ball.”
year-old has done very well, and in
Saturday’s Holyrood Handicap (6f.)
he'beat a field of good sprinters in
excellent fashion. Claiming a 51b.
allowance for Queensland apprentice
R. Watson, Denhoti carried 9.1 to
win from Chal and River Hero.
Other Caulfield winners were Sun
Lyric (J. Purtell) downing Robert
Bruce and Dream Rocks over the
12 furlongs of the Noble Park Handi-
cap ; Dumfries (D. Barclay) beating
High Play and El Banco in the
rattling-close finish provided by the
Harrisfield Handicap for apprentice
riders; and the aged but able jumper
Gallant Gentleman (L. Meenan) win-
ning the Durham Hurdle from Elastin,
whose turn is not far off.

Apprentice Ray Selkrig didn’t man-
age to land a winner at Randwick
on Saturday, but had his moment of
glory earlier in the week at the Prize
Night of the A.J.C.’s Apprentices’
School, where he was awarded the
Perkins trophy and the Wootton
Saddle. Selkrig is a particularly
promising youngster with 10 winners
to his credit for the current season.

Stewards at Newstead (Vic.) last
week were faced with one that would
have stumped Solomon in all his
wisdom. After a skirmishing finish
in the Maiden Plate five protests were
entered. Sorting out the mess, or
at least rearranging it, the stipes
placed the winner third, disqualified
altogether the second horse, placed
the third horse first and promoted
the one that finished fourth to
second place. We’re still trying to
work out how they decided that the
fourth horse would have beaten the
first past the post but not beaten
the third.

A flock of small sailing craft dis-
playing appallingly poor manners
made a thorough mess of the Syd-
ney Rowing Club regatta on the
Parramatta on Saturday, The New
Zealand visitors must have formed a
poor opinion of the whole shivoo.
However, it enabled the Kiwi pair,
Schneider and Simonsen, to score in
the double-sculls event. The Haber-
field pair, Webb and Cannon, were
hit by a sailing-skitf when leading
clearly 100yds. from the finish, and,
with only one man rowing, they were
beaten a length by the New Zea-
landers. Webb won the single skulls
after Merv. Wood and Schneider had
collided, and New Zealand defeated
Haberfield in the eights after the latter
crew had broken a rigger,
* * * *
In the past week or so has been
seen cricket at its best and worst.
The worst was the N.S.W. v. Queens-
land Sheffield Shield match at Bris-
bane, which fizzled out in a win for
the Ma Staters on the first innings
with 499 to 384. No description of
it is called for except that it was
deadly dull.
By contrast, the opening of the
Bradman testimonial in Melbourne
was a cricketing delight with top-
notch players really letting their hair
down (such as have any) and having
a lash. Hassett won the toss and
batted; after six wickets had gone for
208, Lindwall and Saggers cut loose
to add 160 runs for the seventh wicket
in 84 minutes. Lindwall clouted five
sixers and nine fours towards his 104,
and Hassett’s men finished their run
early on Saturday with a total of
406.
Bradman’s henchmen began moder-
ately with M orr i s a . n d Hamence gone,
for 138 on the board. Saved to
delight the crowd of 50,000-odd in
the afternoon, Bradman’s advent was
greeted with cheers which must have
shaken Chloe near out of her frame
at Young and Jackson’s. A tremen-
dous ovation that might even have
been heard above the border in
N.S.W., but the response by public
and cricketing bodies to the Testi-
monial £md in Bradman’s original
home State does not suggest that they
have ever even heard of the man.
When the noise subsided Bradman,
though much out of practice (as if
he needs any!), proceeded to smite up
the customary century; hitting wildly
he was eventually out for 123, caught
by Neil Harvey off Dooland —Brad-
man’s II 7th first-class century. Stumps
on Saturday saw 364 on the board
for six wickets.

Ern Jarvis (10.9 j) was awarded 6.
points decision over Billy de Belin
(10.7) at Leichhardt, but there was
little in it. Landing good clean
punches, mostly speedy straight lefts,
Jarvis won the first four rounds cleanly
enough; De Belin, however, sat his
opponent down with a straight left in
the fifth and thereafter pursued him
through countless circuits of the ring.

Out of Step?
It is a shocking reflection on
the wage-earning population of
Australia that production of
bricks today is still away below
the level established in the last
pre-war years. Yet homebuild-
ing is supposed to have a top
political and economic priority.
The responsibility that rests
on the shoulders of wage-
earners partly arises through
the domination of so many
trade-unions by Communists
and by the acquiescence of
other unions to the general
Communist policy ; partly from
their support of a “Labor” Gov-
ernment that refuses to govern
in the industrial field, though
full of ideas in the economic
and financial arenas ; and partly
from a lackadaisical (almost
lazy) attitude that exists in all
sections of organised labor.
The “Labor” movement as a
whole has pressed for privileges
over a long period of years with-
out accepting the responsibilities
that go with its accession to
power. It does not yet fully
realise that it has such a large
equity, through the law, in the
total production of goods and
services by the community that
the harder it works the greater
are the benefits to be derived
by all trade-unionists. There is
not the same “solidaritjr’ as re-
gards an objective of increased
production for the general good
as there was in the organisation
for the securing of greater legal
rights, within the arbitration
system, for the trade-union
movement. The trade-unionist
for too long has been satisfied
merely with increased money
wages, a reduction in the hours
in the working week, increased
rates for overtime, etc. Though
obviously disturbed at the pre-
sent time about soaring prices,
he shows no inclination to start
a crusade for the obvious answer
to inflating prices—that answer
being increased production per
man per hour.
More than three years have
passed since the end of the war,
and this country’s output of
goods and services is still inade-
quate. Too much money is still
being passed out for the produc-
tion received in return. We still
have inflationary factors in our
midst which could cause a com-
plete loss of our apparent “low”
production costs (this “lowness”
almost entirely the result of ex-
change-rate anomalies) if over-
seas price-levels suddenly col-
lapsed. In other words, if Com-
munist and other influences suc-
ceed in retarding recovery in
this country until full produc-
tion is reached by the rest of
the world we shall be faced with
a major economic disaster.
Metropolitan Cement
Shares in Metropolitan
Cement, Ltd., were last week
dealt in unofficially on the Stock
Exchange at from 7s, 6d. to
8s 6d. each: —a discount on the
lOs.-paid scrip, which carries a
liability for calls to the extent
of another 10s.
Operations are running behind
prospectus schedule, and there
have been alterations in the
original plans. The plant was
expected to arrive in Australia
during October last; it is now
tipped to be in the country to-
wards “the end of the year,”
A section of the works is now
being established at Maldon,
about 50 miles from Sydney,
whereas the prospectus spoke of
Liverpool as being the manu-
facturing site. It is now hoped
to have the coalmine at Berrima
and limestone quarry at Marulan
in production in “six to eight
months,” and it remains to be
seen whether “the works will be
fully operating in 1949,” as fore-
cast in the prospectus.
Capital issued was £800,000;
the co., up to the date of its
statutory report, had paid out
£429,276, including £340,623 re-
mitted to the Ford Motor Co.,
Detroit, for the second-hand
cement-making plant.
N.Z. Buying-power
N.Z.’s pound, still ranked as
hard currency, doesn’t look
quite as solid as before the ex-
change rate dropped suddenly
to par in August, though it
might hold its own, under Re-
serve Bank and import controls,
long enough for the balance be-
tween money and goods to be
put right, if the N.Z, Govern-
ment gives production a chance.
The pressure today is from the
inside, where there’s as much
money in circulation as when
"Quit stalling—a quid from you!"
the.pound was worth 20 p.c. less
in the eyes of the world. Labor
financiers haven’t attempted to
reduce liquid funds in line with
the fall of £21,700,000 in over-
seas exchange assets, following
the big revaluation, although
it’s as clear as a. pikestaff to
economists and business-heads
that the Government should
have got busy drawing off a few
millions as soon as possible.
Instead of taking funds from
the public. Finance Minister
Nash has gone to the Reserve
Bank to raise the £2l million-
odd on the security of Treasury
bills at 1 p.c. “We don’t want
to take money out of purchas-
ing-power channels,” weakly
said Nash, who hoped Maqri-
landers would save more. Nash
has given the country its sterling-
value pound, and apparently
it’s up to Maorilanders to make
it work. Sounds like “passing
the buck.” Reducing purchas-
ing-power, taxes or State spend-
ing isn’t Walter Nash’s forte ;
he’s an expansionist in finance,
with a bent towards stabilisa-
tion, and can’t cast himself .in
an opposite role.
Some of the Treasury bills
might be liquidated by proceeds
from M.L.’s current “tap’Moan,
Nash promises, but he can’t
figure out yet how much." Last
year’s tap-loan (3 p.c., 1962-64)
produced £21,402,700, and the
first tap-loan (same terms) in
1946 had a yield of £18,300,000.
Nash’s guess for this year is
£2O million, and most of this is
earmarked for State works and
commitments. So the prospect
of retiring the Treasury bills
within a few months doesn’t look
bright.
Maorilanders, worried about
inflation, see in the Govern-
ment’s move another blow to
efforts to control costs, and
women are fuming over the cost
of living. Manufacturers,
through their president, S.
Howard Hunter, are crying out
for incentives to help industiy,
and say taxes, overheads and in-
flated prices are sapping the life
out of trade. They want more
freedom for competition, less
red-tape and more economy in
government, but Labor diehards
turn a deaf ear.
Merica Foundations
Aided by a small public issue,
Merica Foundations, Ltd., has
been formed to take over and ex-
pand the operations of Merica
Pty., which has had a brief but
striking record in Sydney as
manufacturer of brassieres and
corsets. When W. J. H. Nicholas
started the business late in 1939
he had “a few machines and
employees occupying a small
room.” On £2002 paid capital
—practically all held by the
Nicholas family—the number of
machines has grown to 200 and
the payroll takes in. 300 em-
ployees.
At June 30 last the proprie-
tary’s £2002 capital was covered
10 times by net tangible assets.
Stocks (at cost, £57,652) were its
biggest asset, while the main
liability was an advance from its
directors amounting to £41,677.
The prospectus quotes recent
profits after hypothetical tax de-
ductions at the existing rates for
a public co. For 1948 the net
figure is £17,739 ; 1947, £15,830;
and 1946, £3236.
Now the proprietary’s capital
is being lifted to £50,000, which
will belong entirely to the new
public co., Merica Foundations.
The latter will have £90,000 paid
capital, to be issued thus:
£40,000 to the Nicholas family
as payment for their £2OOO hold-
ing in the proprietary; £20,000
subscribed for cash by W. J. H.
Nicholas ; 'and £30,000 taken up
(at par) by the public. The in-
jection of £50,000 new money is
needed for working capital and
new plant. Merica Foundations
scrip is in ss. units, each of
which will evidently have net
tangible cover of about 3s. lid.
on consolidated figures.
With its hard-won goal of
tyre production now in sight,
Reid New Zealand Rubber
Mills, Ltd., Auckland, is making
a bound into the million-pound
group by issuing 280,000 new
£1 shares. Proceeds are needed
to cover stocks of raw and
manufactured materials. The co.
has had a long uphill struggle
since chairman A. M. Seaman
hinted in 1946 that the tyre-
plant should be operating be-
fore the end of 1947. Now the
co. figures that it will turn out
its first tyres in the early weeks
of 1949. This will put the co.
second in the race, a shade over
half a year behind the Firestone
Tyre and Rubber Co. of N.Z.,
Ltd., Christchurch. Dunlop
N.Z., Ltd., Wellington, will be
third.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
The Infant Prince
November 14 was a Sunday;
it was also a day of black,
drooping cloud and sullen
threats. Consequently most
people stayed indoors. As a
report from Buckingham Palace
had been freely forecast for this
week-end, and national interest
was widely roused, the eye would
keep glancing towards the clock
to make sure of switching on
the radio in time for the next
news bulletin. And the country’s
anxiety was not allayed until late
at night.
It was, and is, everybody’s
concern. After the immediate
feeling of relief a solid and com-
fortable sense of gladness spread
among the people. Everyday
life may be difficult, nerve-
wracking and unpromising, but
there is still time for intermit-
tent fun and laughter. What is
so seldom felt —and it is not the
fault of the British people—is
that inner gladness which is the
heart of contentment.
The Royal Family was never
warmer in the affection of the
people than it is now. A year
ago the nation cast off for a
short time its unwelcome cloak
of austerity to honor the heiress-
presumptive on her marriage to
the man of her own choice. The
country celebrated and was
glad ; then, as now, it set aside
its domestic squabbles and be-
came reinspired with unity.
That it was a boy has added
to the general rejoicing: for the
Prince will from earliest
awakenings be conscious of his
ultimate sovereignty. During the
half-century that has passed
since the last time a child was
born in direct succession to the
Throne, world communications
have shortened and the whole
fabric of Empire has changed.
The bonds between the Mother
Country and the Dominions are
by statute looser than they were
in 1894; yet in kith and com-
mon interest they are inestim-
ably firmer. The one constitu-
tional link is the Crown. What
can be more natural than that
the Prince should, in his up-
bringing, come to know them all
—and know them well?
Party Parade
With the reversal of the
scientifically-equipped Dr. Gal-
lup in mind, any attempt to
forecast the political trend after
a single Parliamentary by-elec-
tion must be uncertain and
dangerous. But the result of the
by-election at Edmonton, which
Labor won by a majority of
only 3327 votes, can hardly be a
comfort to the Socialists. Mr.
Morgan Phillips, secretary of the
Labor party, could find only a
few guarded words to say—that
the result confirmed “Labor’s
unparalleled by-election record,
which it had held unimpaired
for over three years.” True,
Labor does still hold the record,
and would have done so had the
majority been one vote. But the
figures suggest a marked swing
away from the Left:
General By-
Election election
(July, (Nov. 13,
1945). 1948).
Labor .. .. 33,163 26,164
Conservative .. 14,094 22,837
Independent .. 1,382
Labor majority .. 17,687 3,327
Present-day Edmonton is not
the pleasant country village re-
mote from “famous London
town” associated with John Gil-
pin’s wedding-day ride. Rather
does it represent suburbia of the
day before yesterday, on the
humbler side of middle-class and
well-dotted with factories. For
more than 25 years it has been
considered a “safe” Labor seat.
So the victory isn’t exactly an
exhilarating one. The much-
reduced majority suggests that
Mr. Morrison’s wooing of the
middle-classes stays unrequited.
He has persistently expressed
the conviction that the Labor
party should broaden its appeal,
presumably to attract the
Liberal vote.
Conservative circles are very
sensitive about their failure to
gain a by-election seat from
Labor. It is fair to say that
Gravesend was the only con-
stituency where the balance was
even ; and here the Labor party,
like a Panzer general, concen-
trated its entire resources and
won the seat, although narrowly.
That was in December, 1947.
Since then the Conservative-
party machine has been re-
organised and is now confident
of ultimate success.
It may be that the trump cards
are being held back, but as yet
there is little to suggest that the
Conservatives have overcome
the strong anti-Tory prejudice
that still lingers. While the party
affirms that it depends upon
support from people in all walks
of life and that, unlike the
Socialists, it is free from class-
distinction, the electorate has
still to be convinced.
The position of the Liberal
party is critical. The next
general election should deter-
mine whether it will survive or
perish.' Although it has de-
clared its policy and is stated to
have 300 candidates ready, the
impression given to the public
is neither virile nor purposeful.
Too many deposits have been
forfeited in by-elections.
Ibsen Retouched
A new adaptation by Max
Faber gives pith and pungency
to the dialogue of “The Wild
Duck” (St. Martin’s Theatre)
and avoids the stilted bookish-
ness that hag drugged other
translations. So well does this
64-year-old play wear that only
the costumes. Hjalmar’s
museum-piece of a camera and
the plushy opulence of the
Werle drawing-room set a stamp
upon its period. There is even
a reluctant topicality, perhaps
because psycho-neurotic dis-
orders have outlived Ibsen’s ob-
servations of them.
Some multiplicity of themes
tends to confuse; and one
searches for the exact symbol-
ism of the wild duck: but what
defeats reason is always theatri-
cally effective. Of impeccable
construction, the plot marches
with relentless precision. The
principal characters, in order of
their disturbance, are the do-or-
die idealist and home-wrecker,
Gregers Werle (Robert Harris);
the dithering, tinpot idealist,
Hjalmar Ekdal, to whom Anton
Walbrook’s consummate tech-
nique gives, inter alia, petulance
and self-pity; and Hedvig Ek-
dal, the 14-year-old suicide,
whose childish bewilderment and
gawky effusion are delicately
portrayed by the Swedish film-
actress Mai Zetterling.
Old Ekdal (Miles Malleson),
who shoots “bears” (rabbits) in
his “forest” of four withered
Christmas - trees, is lovably
humorous and childlike. As
Gina Ekdal, the commonplace
but uninhibited wife, Fay Comp-
ton is patient in her deep suffer-
ing and eloquent even in her
dowdiness. Dr. Relling (Walter
Fitz Gerald), for all his deliber-
ate excesses, is the one realist
in the group of fantastics; it is
he who prescribes to each one a
different “life-lie” or sham. In
a production which eschews the
“stagey” it is unfortunate that
he should come so near to bur-
lesque in the luncheon scene.
The Ekdal family is strangely
contrasted in accents: provin-
cial for grandpa, Austrian for
pa, Cockney for ma and Swedish
for junior. But this is an after-
thought: in acting of superla-
tive quality the incongruity is
hardly noticed.
Nowadays State aid seems to
be lavish, anomalous and unac-
countable. The need for it is
not in question, but the method
of allocation is. The all-round
excellence of this production
should cause some deep think-
ing among the Old Vic. (and
other) authorities whose produc-
tions have fallen short of ex-
pected standards. For “The
Wild Duck” (a cultural play)
has a tip-top cast, new decor
and high-production costs —in
fact, all the handicaps that are
intended to be softened by sub-
sidy—but enjoys not one penny
of State aid.
Messrs. Linnit and Dunfee,
who present the play, have
proved that artistic worth —and
capacity bookings—can still be
the reward of private enterprise.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: I never think of immi-
grants without recalling Jock McClure,
who blew into Murrayville one blazing
Saturday afternoon and announced
“Ah’m a pommy an’ a verra raw yin, but
ye’ll tak’ a drap wi’ me?” We did, and
observed that it was not by any means
. Jock’s first for the day. Clinging gravely
to the counter he said that he’d been a
month in the country, trying to make
himself an Australian, but to his grief
everybody seemed to know that he hadn’t
yet qualified. “What’s a monnie tae do?”
he inquired peevishly. “Ah can
dreenk ma share, Ah’m ready tae worruk
wi’ the best o’ ye, an’ if onny bluidy fule
wants tae ficht Ah’m his mon. But 'tis
aye nae guid. Nae guid at a’,” His rov-
ing eye fell upon a black saddle-horse
standing outside. He levered himself from
the bar, wavered through the door,
clambered aboard the neddy and slapped
it with his hat. The black reared, came
down, pig-rooted a couple of times and
then bolted. Jock yelled a queer
Gaelic war-song or something and
bounced madly from ears to rump and
back again. He got the horse back to the
pub, fell off into the dust and looked
earnestly up at us. “Ah’m tellin’ ye,” he
gasped, “that Ah never rode onnythin’
but a wee wooden pony on a tuppenny
roundabout afore. Hoots, if Ah’m no’ an
Awstrellyan noo Ah never will be.” We
folded him to our bosoms.

“Kilkennicat”: Those blacks who used
their molars as mincing-machines to feed
Bertram and Klausemann after their
rescue (B, 10/11 /’4B) showed their in-
telligence in another way a few years
later. The R.A.A.F. made use of the
mission air-strip in 1943-44, and to satisfy
the curio demand the abos. obliged by
making boomerangs, though they had
never been used in those parts before.
Where they got the specifications from
was a mystery. Incidentally, the Spanish
priests who conduct the mission were
very proud of the magnificent organ,
specially made to suit the climatic con-
ditions, which was given by the German
Government in appreciation of the rescue
of the two airmen. But the organ was
ruined beyond repair, and Father Thomas,
who was chiefly responsible for the
rescue, was killed when Germany’s allies
wiped out the mission in ’43.

“K. 9”; Tell “Gem” (B. 20/10/’4B)
that if he wants to avoid the risk of
choking his dog when giving it an emetic
not to follow the method he suggests of
gently forcing the neck of the bottle be-
tween the teeth and then trying to take
care that the liquid doesn’t run straight
down the throat into the lungs. Even to
a dog in spasm a liquid emetic can be
effectively administered without any risk
of choking if, with the forefinger, the
dog’s cheek is held so that it forms a
pouch at the sides of the mouth, and into
this sac the bottled emetic is slowly
poured. If the dog shows a disinclina-
tion to swallow tap-massage his throat.
As for giving powders, the usual method
nowadays is not to hold the dog’s mouth
open by pressing the jowls between the
back molars but by holding the mouth
open from above and not below the
muzzle.

“Sth. E.”: It was dull and cloudy after
a dry spell when Dad Parsons and his
missus drove into town to spend a long-
promised week-end with friends there.
The town house was modern, the friends
entertaining, but Dad soon grew restless.
Three times during dinner he dived out-
side for a minute, and through, the even-
ing was constantly seen making for the
door. Then came bed-time. For half an
hour the house slept, then surreptitious
movements began in the visitors’ bed-
room, extended slowly down the passage
and ended with the creaking of the back
door. A few seconds and the audible
trail came again in reverse. Followed a
little while of peace and the creeping re-
Host and hostess discreetly
ignored the many excursions during the
night. Next day the restlessness had
spread to Mum Parsons, who, on return-
ing from outside, was several times seen
to shake her head at the old bloke in
secret sorrow. Still their friends refrained
from comment. Monday morning, and
the visit over, the old utility turned
homeward. “Now, ain’t they rotten sort
o’ houses they have in them towns.
“And, what's more, I'll see that the doctor changes your tonic!"
Mum?” Dad remarked as they swung
into a quiet road. “It’s them flamin’ tile
roofs does it. Gripes, a man can’t even
tell if it’s rainin’.”

“Kelms”: Don’t know about sheep re-
fusing strange food (B. 17/11/’4B), but
the manager of a Westralian station went
nearly dippy trying to induce some im-
ported rams to drink. The water was
good and the troughs were clean, but
they refused to drink although they were
obvlbusly dying of thirst. Then some-
one remembered that in S.A., where they
came from, stock mostly watered at dams.
A hollow was quickly scooped and filled
and the jumbucks went for it with their
ears back.
* * * «
“B. A, Ker”: The discussion started
after Jum had quoted from Kipling:
“Smells are surer than sights or sounds.”
Bert agreed: the smell of cypress burning
always reminded him of the night when,
a lost, terrified kid, he had smelt burning
cypress on the night wind and thus found
his way to a habitation. George con-
tended that sound struck stronger chords
of memory. Every song, for instance,
reminded him of somebody, some place
or some incident; in fact, songs were
his notebook of the war, beginning at
“The Wizard of Oz” and ending with
“Waiting for Ships That Never Come In.”
Little Fred came in with: “I’m forty-
one, and I turned four on the boat com-
ing out from the Old Dart. Yet, passing
the Shire roadroller last week I caught
a whiff of burning oil and —zim! There
I was, standing with the dad on a deck
watching an engine working a crane.”
George seemed about to make an argu-
ment of it when the taciturn Bob said
quietly: “I reckon a smell kept me alive
once.” He would have closed up again
at that if we hadn’t worried him for
the rest: “I .was all in; so was the rest
of the mob. I was ready to drop, and
if I had I wouldn’t have cared if I never
got up again. Suddenly my mate looked
up and started to sniff; he seemed to get
all excited; I thought he’d gone mad or
something. Then I got a whiff of it.
The next minute everyone seemed to gasp
at once: ‘Gumleaves! ’ And it was. It
was just like getting a message from
home. Over the hill we saw where the
smell came from —two gum-trees growing
in a cemetery. But it made no difference
—I was convinced that I’d got a message
from the mother.” He lapsed back into
his habitual silence, leaving us to re-
proach ourselves for not having known
he was an Eighth Divvy man.
“T.D.”: Clem, the Maltese, ran a few
cows on some spare land at the back of
his small cane-farm and sold the milk in
the little township near by. One morning
when he was delivering to the hotel
the proprietor’s wife looked in the bucket
and saw three flies floating in the milk.
“Dear me, Clem,” she said. “That’s no
good.” Clem looked nonplussed for a
minute, then shrugged his shoulders and
grinned apologetically. “Strike me pink,
missus,” he explained. “Them old cows
of mine’ll eat anything!”
V * * «
“Solitude”: The mob was tiring .badly,
so about four o’clock we decided to
make camp below town and finish the
trip next day. Coming back from turning
the lead in along the river, I found
Seventyfiver seated on a log, one boot
off, telling Blue .what he thought of foot-
wear that came to bits on a droving job.
“Been frayin’ out for some time,” he
growled. “An’ t’day it bust apart. Cripes,
how c’n a bloke lace that up?” He
held out the offending boot. “Wants a
patch with eyelet holes, riveted on the
front.” I reminded him we’d be home
the following evening. “Yair,” he grunted.
“But I still ain’t got nothin’ t’ mend ft
when we get there.” He shoved his
hoof in with a bump, tethered the trilby
to his shank with the lace, and lent a
hand making camp. Then, without a
word, he dug out line and tackle and
made towards the big hole under the
bank where we’d tried for a feed on
former occasions. Hopefully I built up
stones, dragged out the frying apparatus,
then crept down to learn if it would be
fish or bully-beef. The old bloke was
seated gloomily on a rock. Alongside
him were three beauties, and as T
approached his line ran out; he played
it a moment, then up came a two-
pounder. As he landed it Seventyfiver
gave a snort of disgust. “Another blasted
fish,” he growled, tossing it impatiently
towards the heap. “Gripes, ain’t it a
cow! Them other times I bin here I’ve
dragged up nothin’ but boots!”

“Lower Tops’l”; Along the little-
visited, forest-clad shor'e by “Big” Rame
Head (Vic.) a host of goaunas and
dingoes exist on washed-up offal. Walk-
ing the surf-washed beaches there re-
cently I watched numerous gos,—large,
squat fellows —feasting on dead seals,
which for some reason seem to come
ashore to die from their rookery on The
Skerries, three rocky islets off Wigan
Head. The warrigals will go for any-
thing from sharkskin up.

“Gravelsnatcher”; Bill the Goose sel-
dom swore, but he had one choice ex-
pression which seemed to meet all con-
tingencies and which he never hesitated
to employ when he felt that the occasion
called for it. It was a shocking piece of
work that blistered and seared everything
within range and ended with a whiplike
crack that defied repartee. Often, after
a tactfully-worded request, the Goose
had promised to confine its use to male
company; but the habit was established,
and the presence of women rarely availed
to restrain Bill’s tongue in time. Some-
one asked him if he’d ever felt really em-
barrassed by the phrase, and he smiled
ruefully. Once, he admitted, he had. It
was on one of his trips to Perth, and he
somehow found himself mixed up in a
euchre tournament. In one game he was
partnering a motherly old lady who was
striving desperately to do the right thing
and seemed to be having a run of luok.
She and the Goose, it seemed, were both
well in the running for the prize, and on
this occasion they held between them
cards which, if properly played, would
win easily. Knowing the Goose’s fond-
ness for the game, we grinned as we
pictured the scene. The old lady,
anxious to please and thinking of the
prize, and the Goose, concentrating on
the game. “And what happened when
she trumped your ace. Bill?” someone
asked. Bill slowly shook his head. “She
didn’t trump my ace,” he said. “I trumped
hers. That,” he explained, “was where I
first heard that expression.”

“Mat’s Mate”: We got a job in a Mel-
bourne factory, though in separate de-
partments. By lunchtime that first day
I’d joined a union, bought two raffle-
tickets, been informed who would take
my bets, had a visit from a collector of
tea-money, been approached, by a football
secretary, a temperance officer and a
charity-worker, and twice told by the
foreman not to hang about talking. . At
lunchtime I went in search of Mat. He’d
had a similar experience. We brooded
over it, went back to work and endured
a few more visits. That night, as we
walked out, Mat sighted a “suggestion-
box” in which thoughtful employees were
invited to drop ideas. Mat wrote out an
idea and dropped it in. Next morning we
were carpeted by the factory overseer.
“If you don’t like the way we run things,”
he said, “you can get your time.” That
was enough for us and we got it. On
the way out I asked Mat about his idea.
“Aw, nothin’,” he growled. “I only
offered for the two of us to take over the
jobs collectin’, bitin’, bettin’ an’ so forth
that everybody seemed t’ be doin’. I
reckoned we could handle the lot while
the rest got on with their work.” He
spat disgustedly. “Let’s get back up-
country, mate,” he said. “Only things
t’ bother a bloke there is ants, flies,
snakes, hot days an’ work.”

“L. de R”; With a net of enticing
meals, careful laundry, the guest-room
and exclusive right to compere our radio,
we tried to hold our man (young, hired).
But he stuck it out only a couple of
weeks. “Too far out,” he said. “With-
out transport one is out of everything.”
We admitted the utility was almost done.
She ate up the petrol ration faster every
trip. But we played our last card. We
offered him a horse—quite a decent hack.
He turned it down with contempt. He’d
like to see himself riding that distance.
(We are quite 10 miles from a good
town.) And arrive at a dance-hall in
muddy riding-breeches! Oh, dear! In
our day even the ladies went places on
horseback, and carried spares to change.
If his dad had been so fussy he’d never
have gone anywhere or even met the
mother of our young hired man. Ah, well,
Grandma is over 70 but she can still lend
a hand with the cows and poddies. Does
a better job than most hired men, too.

“Laetitia”: The South Burnett (Q.)
blacks had a legendary explanation of
the kookaburra. A Bunya Mountain man
had taken Mis small son with him on an
emu-stalking expedition, his dual motive
being the filling of the dilly-bags and
instilling the youngster with the first
lessons of the hunter’s craft. The
moment the lad sighted the quarry he
was moved to loud mirth by the bird’s
ungainly appearance, exclaiming in tones
which stampeded the birds: “Boo-
yenaaarka [Look at his long legs] ha-ha-
ha!” In exasperation at the loss of his
game the father called on the local spirit
to punish the lad, who was then and there
changed into a bird. However, the sud-
den metamorphosis failed to subdue his
mirth, and, in his feathered guise, the
youngster’s guffaws continue to this day.

“Bon-yi”: It’s a wonder scientists
haven’t investigated the fodder, food and
tanning-bark possibilities of the N.Q.
“Chinee-apple” or jujube-tree. It is
classed as a* pest around the Townsville
and Charters Towers districts, where it
grows faster than the cattle and goats
can eat it down. A fast-growing thomed
shrub reaching gigantic spreading propor-
tions in old age, it is noted for its
cherry-size-to-larger fruits, sour to floury-
sweet, with a pointed large and hard
seed. The fruit turns from a deep
enamel-green into shades of yellow to
deep brown. Cattle reach up to strip the
small, velvety-sided leaves, while every
one of the many thousands of the trees
around the grey-soil flats are neatly
trimmed to average goat-height. Growth
in most cases is very fast even on the
poorest soils, the wood is excellent for
fires, the dark-brown bark makes the
finest tanning-bark for leathers, the fruit
under proper cultivation is edible and
the trees are highly resistant to drought
conditions. Planted in gardens and
pruned judiciously, they make good shade
trees and windbreaks. Axe-handles made
from old trees stand up to heavy work.
NARIEL BARON.
(Prizewinner, Melbourne Show.)
Nariel Baron, I came to see you at the Show-
grounds,
Stirred by my memories of Alpine days,
Wading the five great rivers circling Geehi
Or following the wattled Indi ways.
I thought of daisy hillsides by the Thredbo,
Of summer snowdrifts on the Ramshead
Range,
And Lake Albina red with sunset’s magic,
Jagungal’s giant summit, blue and strange.
September’s snows are melting into Groggin,
The Christmas bush and red grevrllea bud
By Leatherbarrel and, at stockwhip’s echo,
The Corryong Herefords sniff at the brown
flood.
Will you be climbing up the steep high moun-
tains,
Leaving low Biggera or Bringenbrong,
Nariel Baron, early in the summer,
Bellowing joy even to brown Towong?
Free-born and wild the brumbies from the
Cascades
Dare the last blizzard loosed by Dead Horse
Gap.
You should be there, sipping the crystal waters,
Robbing new snowgrass of its tender sap.
You belong there, leading the long-horned
cattle,
Brown-coated Herefords with breasts like
snow,
Faces like wind-curled snow upon brown
granite,
You, a prizewinner of the Melbourne Show.
Instead, roped in a dark, straw-strewn pavilion,
Frightened you stand with brooding head bent
down,
Eyes that in freedom sought the salting riders
Shrink from appraising glances of the town.
Gilt-edged certificates that hang above you,
Trophies of satin ribbon, blue and red,
Cattlemen covet from all broad Australia
Cannot assuage you for your heathy bed.
Courage, my Alpine friend, forlorn and won-
dering,
Soon they’ll entrain you back to happier days,
Nariel Creek for you, not drinking-bucket,
With Kosciusko smiling through the haze.

“S.E.”: Gockie Rogers’s daughter had
beep “tracking” with Dan Matthews for
some time, and the district predicted a
match. Dan was young, presentable and
owned a nice slice of property near the
Rogers dairyfarm, where he worked
early and late with eye-pleasing results.
Then came shearing-time and a straggling
of strangers to shear the small mobs the
farmers ran as a sideline. One greasy
little bloke spotted Sally Rogers and
turned for a second look. Soon Sally
was attending the local hops with the
little stranger in tow, while Dan tended
his stock, haggard and silent. Then news
of Sally’s engagement to the shearer wasi
sprung on the community. “Well, this is
a surprise,” the girl in the post-office
gushed, eyeing the new ring. “Why,
Sally, we all thought it was Dan that you
were in love with.” Sally sighed regret-
fully. “So it is,” she confided, “but a
girl’s got to think of the future, you?
know. Dad having the place, we’ve
always had to work pretty hard, and—
well, you can’t blame a girl for wanting
to marry into a life of ease and plenty,
now, can you?”

“Bo”: Fielding had run his eye along
the line of fence-posts he and his new
hand had been putting up during the
morning. Glancing at the roll of No. 8
wire that had been dumped at the comer-
post a thought struck him. “Hey, Tom,”
he called out to the hand, who was boil-
ing the midday billy, “Did you re-
member to bring the strainer?” The
newchum looked up. “Ar, gosh,” he said.
“I didn’t think you was that fussy. I
don’t mind puttin’ up with a few tea-
leaves meself!”

“Sth. E.”: Robbie glanced at his
watch and stepped on the accelerator.
Bit late tonight. He hoped. “Fighting
Mike” wasn’t in charge at the depot
where he was to leave half his load. Not
that the big bloke wasn’t good at un-
loading ; it was when he came to re-
cording the delivery he was clumsy and
slow as a lame elephant. Robbie swung
round the bend and roared to a stop at
the depot. Sure enough, there was Mike.
With file goods unloaded, Robbie handed
the list to the hefty one. “There y’ are.
All c’rect,” he announced briskly. “I’ll
“That's better —it can blow a hurricane now if it Wants to."
push on.” “Aw, no, y’ won’t,” boomed
the other. “Y’ll wait an’ see them things
entered in the day-book, then there’ll be
no argument later.” “But I’m late,”
Robbie protested. “An’ ” Mike’s
jaw set and he took a step forward. “I
said y’ll wait.” Robbie got an eyeful
of the prominent muscles and meekly
followed the giant into the office. On the
desk a kitten about the size of a teacup
was curled on the day-book. Hearing
Mike stop, the fluffy black atom set his
engine running in a low contented purr.
Came a long pause. Then a big hairy
arm slid the list on to the desk and Mike
turned. “Don’t you drivers think y’ c’n
get away without . . . without deliverin’
them details t’ the office, like I said,” he
scowled. “That’s awright, then. I’ll —
er —I’ll enter ’em later.”

“Sir Spen”: What’s wrong with “The
0.D.” (B. 17/11/’48)? Surely he’s aware
that, in addition to incisor teeth in its
lower jaw, a sheep has a full set of upper
and lower molars, capable of masticating
maize equally well with the horse or any
other ruminant. If a sheep also gets a
quantity of scrub or hay it will live
indefinitely on maize without suffering
any bowel trouble. How long sheep will
live on a strictly maize diet is, prob-
lematical, but because I was on the job
of feeding with maize alone 4700 wethers
marooned on a small island in the Moree
watercourse area during the 1921 floods
I know they will survive for a period of
seven weeks without ill effect. The maize
was delivered to the island by plane from
Garah, 33 miles distant—the first time in
Australian aviation history that a plane
was used for such a purpose. Incidentally,
it was during this period I discovered
Merino sheep will, and can, climb lean-
ing trees.
“Rawhiti”: “The 0.D.” (B. 17/11/’4B)
slips when he stated that sheep have no
top teeth and therefore cannot crush
maize. They certainly have no top front
teeth, but anyone who has drenched
sheep can vouch for the top back teeth
all right. Millions of sheep have been
kept alive and healthy and have even
ireared lambs on a diet of whole-maize
with a bit of roughage so as they can
bring their cud up. Whole-maize scat-
tered on the hard ground is still the best
and most economical way to feed sheep
‘in drought-time.

“Q.X.”: Gone with the old-timers is
the hand-drilling race. The last com-
petition I saw was staged on a granite
bar across the creek-bed at the foot of
Bamford Hill (N.Q.). Miners were
handicapped at anything from a second
up to three minutes. Each man spent
some time sharpening his set of drills
.and generally gauging them. They were
then laid out in' correct rotation along-
side the position drawn. A five- to seven-
pound Gympie hammer was used. At
the crack of the pistol the first miner
would start, the timekeeper calling the
seconds, each miner starting as his time
was called. Usually a time limit of a
quarter of an hour was set. The com-
petitor who had drilled the deepest hole
at the end of that time won. Though it
was curious the number of “Chinamen”
(three-cornered holes) which were drilled,
I’ve seen holes up to 12in. deep drilled in
15 minutes —and the driller had to clean
the hole out himself and do his own
watering and drill grey granite. Some
of those holes can still be seen there.
* ♦ * ♦
“8.A.”: When “Rabbiter” (B.
27/10/’4B) found two mother turkeys and
a tiger-sfiake lying dead together he was
quite justified in assuming that he had
adequate evidence of an all-in fight
before him. I once witnessed a fight be-
tween a turkey-cock and a fully-grown
black snake. The snake was closely
coiled with its head swaying to and fro
about 18in. from the ground watching
every move of the turkey, which was
walking slowly around him well out of
striking range. Suddenly the bird side-
stepped toward the reptile and spread his
wmgs out to their full length, and almost
at the same instant the wriggler struck
but found nothing more vulnerable than
the long, stiff wing-feathers. The bird
kept moving around repeating his rang-
flapping manoeuvre at irregular intervals
drawing a vicious return from his
opponent on each occasmn Presently the
gobbler jumped m and landed flatfooted
on the snake, and the reptile, bewildered
by the barrage of trampling and pecking
that followed, broke away and took
shelter in a root-hole where a stump had
been burned out, leaving the bird none
the worse for the encounter.
* * * *
“T.D.”: The selection in the scrub near
the Johnstone River (N.Q.) belonged to
an Italian with a large young family. He
felled about half an acre of scrub a year
wherever it looked easiest, giving the
place a very ragged appearance. I was
riding a horse, and as I left he walked
down the road alongside me, talking. On
the south side of the road a six-year-old
“ Hey , Martha, bring that light back!”
boy was vigorously chopping a sapling
with a long-handled cane-knife. Stand-
ing right at his heels was a younger boy,
and each time the cane-knife swung it
passed over the small lad’s skull with
about an inch to spare. I pointed and
said to the father, “Quick, Tony. Look! ”
Tony stopped with his feet wide apart,
hands on hips, clicked his tongue in dis-
gust, then spread his hands wide and
laughed. “You see? The silly cow. He
choppa da tree down on wrong side of
da road!”
* * * *
“Strop”: “Übet” (B. 21/10/’4B) scoffs
at the idea of exchanging confidences
under cover of a general row, but it has
a scientific basis. The human ear re-
sembles a drum, but whereas in a band
the instrument is struck with a stick, in
the ear the process is reversed and the
stick is struck by the diaphragm. During
silence the sound of a voice may fail to
register, but when pandemonium reigns
it is all recorded, with the voice included
in the medley. The victim of “Paracusis
\villisii” may not be able to hear a solo by
a lonely flute, but when the whole
orchestra is in full blast his eardrum,
throbbing under the impact of the brass
and percussion, picks up the woodwind
at the same time. Modern hearing-aids
simply magnify all the sounds within their
range, and it takes the wearer some time
to learn how to eliminate background
noises and isolate those that interest him.
One of the first questions an ear specialist
will ask is, “Do you hear better when
travelling by train than when sitting in a
quiet room?”
* * * •
“Bruno”: I doubt whether “Rawhiti”
(B. 13/10/’4B) has ever been nearer a
kava bowl than reading about it in a
Beatrice Grimshaw novel. The name
kava (not kava-kava) by which the drink
is generally known is Polynesian, and the
grog is made by pounding pieces of the
dried root of the Piper methysticum
shrub to a fine powder in a hollowed-out
piece of hardwood and steeping it in
water. It is then strained through a
bundle of hibiscus fibre merely to remove
all solid particles of root. As all this
takes only a matter of minutes it disposes
of “Rawhiti’s” fermentation yam,xand
the village maidens masticating the stuff
probably went out quite a while before
his Dad was born. I have never, heard
of kava being taken with food, and per-
sonally could think of nothing worse.
As to its “wickedness,” it can be tolerably
so if a bottle of “0.P.” is upended into
the bowl. But I’ll lay my bottom dollar
no South Sea islander or Darnley Island
boong ever made kava from the root of
the tapioca or manioc plant (kasava) as
stated by “Rawhiti.” “Young Slim” (B.
15/9/’4B) must have taken a pull at
some native toddy the coconut variety
of which packs a considerable swoosh.
♦ * * *
“Cheney”: Ambling around the Gim-
b'aldie Show Old Jack came on a bloke
driving 2in. nails into solid blocks of
jarrah. At “A shilling a go” and double
their money back if they drove it home,
lots of aspirants for easy money were
responding, but time after time they did
their bob, the nail bending with the
first few blows. Jack was long
accustomed to forcing nails into such
vegetable irons as wandoo, tuart, etc., so
here obviously was money from home.
“Make it a decent bet, say
a. quid,” he said. “Right,”
said the bloke. “Though
in that case we must make
it a match, I drive a nail
in against you.” Forth-
with, taking the hammer,
he banged a 2in. home
clean and straight. But
Jack must have been a bit
off, or the hammer greasy,
for at the fourth smack his
nail bent, and nothing he
could do would straighten
it and send it home. Next
time he went first, after
carefully scrubbing the
hammer in the dirt. But
again he was off. The
third shot brought him
luck; he redeemed one of
his quids. Which heartened
him so that he kept driv-
ing and bending until his
whole fiver was liquidated.
Then the Law, who’d been
watching with a tolerant
eye, intervened. “Give the
old bloke back his money.”
“What for? He lost it
fair.” “Fair! Look —the
nails you used yourself
you took out of your right-
hand pocket; the nails for
him you took put of your
left.” “You mean that
left-hand nails are un-
lucky?” Jack queried.
“Well, they are to you and
the other mugs—you see,
when a nail’s been bent
and then straightened it’s always likely to
bend again.”
♦ * * *
“Zake”: D.D.T. seems to have given
the k.o. to the green gum-bough that,
hung in the bush home, was the time-
honored counter to the pestiferous house-
fly and which didn’t take second place
even to flypaper. But what has replaced
seaweed as the bush barometer? Often
seen hundreds of miles from the seaboard,
it was accounted among many outbackers
of greater weather-prediction powers than
black cockatoos, ants or the corn on
Uncle Ned’s little toe.
* * * *
“Bill E.”: I wondered why the two
full-blooded abo. brothers, stockmen at
the outback S.A. station, never spoke to
each other, though they played cardo,
went mustering and slept in the same hut.
It was while we were on a three-weeks
muster that a half-caste told me the
reason Nunga said it was tribal law that
brothers should always be on friendly
terms. By speaking to each other an argu-
ment might occur, so they remained silent.
One of the boys left the station, but the
brother knew his walkabout plans from
a map drawn on the ground.
♦ • * •
“Gumsucker”: Maybe it was only
superstition, but back in an old-time
racing-stable where often as a youngster
I took a turn at grooming, etc., no jockey
“sweating”-off weight would taken even a
sip of water before going on the scales,
holding the idea that such taking of
fluid would instantly increase his weight,
which, though saving him from carrying
“lead,” would lead to trouble after the
race when, his body having in the inter-
val returned to normal, he would weigh-in
light.
* * * *
“E. 2”; Alec was grubbing stumps in
the top paddock, taking his lunch arid re-
turning late in the evening. “Y’ might as
well take the horse an’ dray with y’ in the
mornin’,” Mullins instructed him. “Then
y’ can bring home a load of firewood in
the evenin’.” Alec set out, but returned
to the stable an hour later with the horse
and headed off with him almost immedi-
ately. “What’s wrong?” Mullins inquired.
“Nothin’,” Alec said. “list brought old
Rissole back an’ takin’ him up agen.”
“But what’s that got t’ do with bringin’
a load of wood back this evenin’?”
Mullins persisted. “All y’ had t’ do was
keep him up there till it was time t’ come
home.” Alec scratched his head. “I had
him f’r takin’ the dray up this momin’,”
he said. “Well, I figgered he’d have t’
make another trip t’ bring it back. That
would’ve meant I’d have had t’ come
down once t’ bring him down an’ agen t’
take him back. What’s wrong with doin’
it straight orf an’ savin’ a trip?”
THE CURRAWONGS.
With the 1 raw grey days of winter, on the bush-
land shadows throwing,
When the gentler birds withhold their sweeter
songs,
Comes a chorus from the uplands, shouting
loud and ever-growing:
“Gonter rain tomorrow!” cry the noisy
currawongs.
Yellow-eyed old heathens, large of beak and
black of feather,
Jump and bump upon the branches, strut
the ground in yelling throngs,
And they make the whole bush listen as they
lie about the weather —
“Gonter rain tomorrow!”- call the mocking
currawongs.
Should some gentler singer rouse him from his
silence and seclusion
And he pipe a feeble protest in expression
of his wrongs,
Then there’s truculence and rudeness at the
weakly-voiced intrusion
“Corn now! Cut it out now!” shout the
churlish currawongs.
Oh, they’re like a crowd of tourists or of boys
let out from school . .
Rushing in the bushland that to silence deep
belongs:
“Gonter rain tomorrow! Wah-hee-hoo! On,
what a fool!
Gonter rain tomorrow!” chorus loud the
currawongs.

COUNTRY GIRL
FURTHERS CAREER AS
MOOEL ORESSMAKER
r
A TRUE STORY
A country girl took a big step
towards the realisation of her
ambition when she started work
recently with a high-class city
dressmaking establishment.
Refusing to be daunted by the
restrictions of the isolated
locality in which she lived, she
commenced a correspondence
course in the hope of becoming
a model dressmaker. After
two years, however, it became
clear that her further progress
would depend on practical
experience. Accordingly, she
wrote to the special Females
Employment Office of the Com-
monwealth Employment Service
in the capital city of her State,
and asked for advice and
assistance.
The Office first secured the
interest of a firm of model
dressmakers, and then arranged
for samples of the girl’s work
to be forwarded for inspection.
The samples showed great
promise, and, with the approval
of the girl’s parents, a position
with the firm was arranged.
The firm is well pleased with
the young lady and was able
to assist in finding her accom-
modation, while the parents
have expressed their gratitude
to the Commonwealth Employ-
ment Service for the active
interest taken in their
daughter’s career.
The Commonwealth Employ-
ment Service is in close touch
with employers, both rural and
metropolitan, throughout Aus-
tralia, and has helped in many
such problems as this. City
dwellers requiring employment
in the country are assured of
the same kind of assistance
from friendly and experienced
Employment Officers. Their

IN Q’LAND of
MEEHANITE
IRONS
THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I;M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Breeding Plain Sheep.
“K.W.R.”: Statistics having
shown that there has been little
improvement in average fleece
production during the past 15
years, Trangie (N.S.W.) Experi-
ment Farm is trying to deter-
mine whether further progress
can be achieved through pro-
geny-testing. A secondary ob-
jective is to render Merinos less
susceptible to fly-strike by
breeding out the skin folds.
F. H. W. Morley, a depart-
mental vet. research officer, con-
siders that skin folds are strongly
inherited in Merinos, which im-
plies that much unnecessary
skin development can be elimi-
nated by selection of suitable
breeding stock. However, com-
plete fold elimination does not
seem possible.
By mating sires which have
proved their ability to transmit
high production to their pro-
geny when mated with plain
ewes it has been possible to pro-
duce 80 p.c, or more of reason-
ably plain progeny from a sire.
As the flock becomes progres-
sively plainer it may be neces-
sary to use the progeny test
more extensively in order to
evolve a true breeding strain.
Progeny-testing at Trangie so
far has produced two outstand-
ing sires. One, as a two-tooth,
was classed as a cull, which at
least should indicate to sheep-
breeders the need for caution in
rigid culling at that age. Both
rams are improvers by about 12
p.c. on a clean-fleece weight
basis, and their offspring are
satisfactory in other respects.
Morley points out that bene-
fits of progeny-testing probably
depend considerably on the
value or otherwise of sons of
sires with a superior progeny
test. Influence of the sire him-
self is extremely limited, but his
use can be extended by hand
service or artificial insemination.
While experiments indicate that
sons of a ram throwing progeny
producing 20 p.c. above average
will themselves throw progeny
producing 10 p.c. above average,
this has yet to be proved.
Dipping the Flock.
“R.A.A. Sargent”: There is
always hard work attached to
dipping, but use of a modern
spray- or shower-dip and proper
yards can cut the work down.
Have had a go at all sorts of
dips and yards, and I reckon the
easiest working to be with the
square or race type, as the sheep
tend to fill them to capacity
more readily.
Main points to watch are
situation and subsequent main-
tenance. Site the dip so that it
is shaded during the hours of
operation, as sheep will balk at
reflected sunlight from the wet
concrete and iron walls. If
natural shade i§ not available a
hessian or bag roof will serve—
a bough-shed drops too many
twigs and leaves. A coat of dull
matt-finish paint helps on the
walls as well as protecting them
from the chemicals in the
fluid.
Penetration with a spray is
good with up to six weeks wool,
and though if does not reach
the skin with longer wool, ex-
amination later will show that
the saturation has been so good
that the fluid has got through.
It is possible for one man to dip
his flock with a shower-dip and
expend far less effort than if he
had four helpers and a plunge
bath.
Stem Rust in Wheat.
“Calo”; The common bar-
berry harbors and spreads the
fungus which causes stem-rust,
and it has been proclaimed a
noxious weed. It is common in
various parts of N.S.W., includ-
ing the tablelands and slopes.
The plant should not be con-
fused with Japanese barberry,
which is immune to the fungus.
The common barberry bears
clusters of green or purplish
leaves with spines about their
edges and has, also, a group of
spines at bases of leaf-clusters.
The bark is grey, the inner wood
is bright yellow. The bushes are
deciduous, the flowers yellow,
the berries bright red and
arranged in decorative bunches.
Each berry contains two seeds.
Bushes and roots should be
destroyed by fire after digging
out thoroughly, and dry salt
should be applied to the bases
of all clumps left standing. Five
or six pounds of salt would be
required to destroy a six-inch
clump. Rock-salt placed over a
clump has worked. A pint of
kerosene will destroy small
bushes, but a gallon or more is
needed for large ones. Take
care that neighboring plants
and grasses are not injured, as
rain will disperse the salt widely.
A circular furrow might be a
good idea.
Concrete Posts.
“Biggest Mac”: Cement will
be more plentiful than timber,
and concrete posts are durable
and have a neat appearance.
Make them four or five at a
time. Prepare a level platform
and space 2in. x 4in. timbers 7ft.
long at 4in. intervals. Oil the
mould or cover with waterproof
paper. All posts should carry
four reinforcing bars of |in.
round or No. 6 wire, but avoid
rusty wire. Two bars should
run to within six inches of the
“I got fed up o' cornin' ROUND that hill!"
ends of the post, while three feet
will be long enough for the
other two bars, provided they
are spaced so that half their
length will be in the ground and
half out. Pieces of triangular
wood put across the bottom of
the mould will make accurately-
spaced grooves for the wires.
Bolts can be placed vertically in
the mould to make holes if they
are preferred.
Using a l-2-2j- mixture, the
last of i-in. gravel, pour con-
crete in the mould to a depth of
one inch. Then place one short
and one long reinforcing rod.
Fill in the concrete to an inch
of the top and put in the other
two bars, then fill to top of
boards. Tamp as you go, level
off with a straight-edge across
the top of the moulding boards
and smooth off with a trowel.
Allow two days before remov-
ing and 10 days under wet bags.
It will be a month before the
posts are clry enough to use.
Always set them at least 2ft. in
the ground when fencing.
Snails.
“Nub is”; “Mul” (B.
20/10/’4B) is off the snail track.
Lime is practically useless unless
mixed with copper - sulphate.
Poison baits are required, and
metaldehyde or calcium-arsenate
gives the best results. Mix as
follows; Small quantity, metal-
dehyde joz. or calcium-arsenate
loz., bran lib., water 1 pint.
Large, metaldehyde ilb. or cal-
cium-arsenate 11b., bran 161 b.,
water 2gals. Add a couple of
tablespoonfuls of honey,
molasses or treacle for each
pound of bran.
Mix the poison thoroughly
with the bran, add the molasses
and then stir the water in until
a loose crumbly mash is ob-
tained. Broadcast the bait or
place it here and there in small
heaps. If subject to wet condi-
tions it is best placed in small
covered tins with “windows”
cut in the sides.
Old debris, rank weeds, vines,
etc., harbor snails and should
be cleaned up. Formula for
lime mixtures: copper-sulphate
or copper-carbonate one part,
slaked lime 12 parts. A barrier
of this mixture around a plot
of ground is invaluable, as snails
crossing the dust will be
poisoned.
Farm Record-book.
“Billjim”: To run a farm with
complete business efficiency D.
B. Williams, a Roseworthy
(S.A.) College economist, advo-
cates the keeping of farm
records. Any system, he says,
should provide for a means of
recording day-to-day receipts
and expenses in groups; a
record of important events on
the farm;, summary of the
farm’s position at regular periods
by a balance-sheet showing
property and a list of debts;
difference between the two gives
net equity or capital.
In preparing the statement
Williams points out that a
money value should be placed
on each of the farm assets.
Valuation of the assets should
be done to give a correct pic-
ture of the financial position of
the farmer after deducting debts.
Value of farm assets can be
recorded in appropriate

Pig-breeding.
“Mr.”: It’s a good start to
use boars and sows with an in-
herited capacity for high fer-
tility, but .this alone won’t en-
sure large litters. It’s necessary
also to provide an environment
that will enable them to produce
to the limit of their capacity;
and environment includes food.
Boars need sufficient to keep
them in good fleshy condition;
sows, after weaning their litters,
the same, and then feed on a re-
stricted diet to keep them in
good condition without excessive
fatness until they farrow.
A balanced diet for breeding
animals includes separated milk

Whole Grains for Poultry.
“M.”: Tests at Werribee State
Farm (Vic.) show that satisfac-
tory results can be obtained by
feeding whole-grain to poultry
without mash, but meatmeal has
to be fed to balance the ration,
The grain is fed in two ways:
regularly, twice a day, allowing
the birds as much as they will
eat at each feed or in hoppers,
The meatmeal is fed from a
hopper and is always available,
As the grain hasn’t to be
crushed or treated in any way,
it comes out much cheaper than
prbpared foods. Another ad-
vantage is that it cannot be
adulterated without detection.
The Singapore Market.
“Nubis”: Buyers’ require-
ments for the Singapore market
should be more closely studied
by Australian producers. Ameri-
can and Dutch exporters, who
have an intimate knowledge of
the market, consistently get top
prices, not always because of
an Y superiority of their pro-
ducts, but because of better
packing. The buyers are chiefly
Chinese, who are willing to pay
bigh prices provided that they
get what they want. The
standard, demanded by them
may be summarised as follows:

Fruit-cases—Redwood is pre-
ferred. Wiring is undesirable,
as it tends to bruise the fruit,
Unwired cases sell better, even
if the weights are lower,
Labels—Distinctive and well-
colored labels are attractive to
buyers.
The number of Australian
brands should be considerably
reduced, so that buyers will get
to know our fruits by their
labels. Zonal brands are sug-
gested, so that all the fruits from
one district (presumably of fairly
uniform quality) can be mar-
keted under one brand.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sundowner”: An old sheet
of iron split longitudinally, with
a piece of 3in. x 2in. hardwood
naifed on the sides and the end
filled in, makes a good grain-
feeder. A handy length is eight
feet. They may be run out
from a central container —say,
an old tank which will hold four
to five days’ supply of grain.
Using a a flock of sheep
can be fed in a very short time,
“Keekwun”: Queensland
small-crop farmers are making
increasing use of headland
drains. Plough the headlands
4ft. to 6ft. wide and 4in. deep,
scoop the loose soil up on to
the cultivation. No cyclone will
flood this drain, and one clean-
ing a year will keep the head-
lands clear of weeds.
“Thap”: Any farmer
troubled by wallabies might fol-
low the example of cane-
growers in the Ayr (N.Q.) dis-
trict. Baiting, electric fences
and the gun failed to stop wal-
labies. In 1944, however, the
beagle-hound was introduced,
and this determined, rugged,
keen-scented dog, the smallest
of all the hunting breeds, is
doing a splendid job. They are
rather small to kill a wallaby
unaided, but, by disturbing the
pests in the early hours and
hunting them for miles, cause
them to run to less unfriendly
areas and leave the young cane
alone.
“C.A.A.”: When a compost-
heap is being kept for some
time prevention of fly-larva
feeding may be secured by liquid
larvicide. Soak the top of the
heap two inches deep with a
mixture of soz. of sodium
arsenate and 7 fl. oz. of molasses
to 4gals. of water. Alternatively,
the heap may be sprayed with
D.D.T. or kerosene. However,
these will nbt get rid of larvae
located before spraying is begun.
“Bat”: Don’t waste time be-
fore attending to a horse’s knee
injury. Thoroughly cleanse the
wound, apply an antiseptic
dressing and keep it bandaged
until healed so that an ugly scar
does not remain. Cold salt-and-
water bandages will help to re-*
move thickness and to restore
elasticity. Moderate exercise is
necessary to prevent stiffness of
the muscles and sinews.
“Kalo”: It is possible to in-
crease the ration of linseed-
meal without danger to poultry
if the meal is first soaked for 12
hours. The toxic element is de-
stroyed by soaking and subse-
quent drying of the meal with-
out injury to the food value.
“Biro”: To get rid of pump-
kin-beetles dust the leaves with
a 2 p.c. benzene-hexachloride
powder as soon as the first
beetle appears. Dust again after
heavy rain. This powder is
especially useful for cucumber-
vines affected by the pest.
“M,”: For the tomato-moth
start to dust or spray as soon as
the first blossoms begin to set.
If Rusting, use a 50 p.c. arsenate
of lead powder; or spray with
2oz. of arsenate of lead powder
in 4gal of water. Apply every
10 days and continue for six to
eight weeks,
“Ben Acre”: A magnetic
screwdriver or a spot of heavy
grease or glue on the head of
the screw can be helpful when
getting a screw into an awk-
ward place.

WATER PAINT
Maisone is a noteworthy water paint,
oil-bound for durability.
Maisone colours have been chosen with
the greatest care so that they will
give the utmost in distinction and at
the same time blend it with
practically any type of
furnishing scheme.
1 gallon makes Ij gallons of paint
preharmonised c
and fireplaces. No resident of
Rock Mountain ever took the
slightest notice of it.
As I drove past the pretty
little log shelter-shed and down
the winding track flanked by tall
tree-ferns and trailing clematis I
wondered what it would all look
like when I returned. Already
the birds were clamoring shrilly
overhead.
FMCK was out felling timber
I—' somewhere, and Mary at
first was incredulous. But when
I showed her the cloud of smoke
rising above the trees at the back
she squealed in dismay and be-
gan to pack clothes in gaily-
striped suitcases.
“There’s no need for that
yet!” I said sharply. “Stop
being hysterical and come and
help me clear your backyard.
This house makes me think of a
bomb on the end of a fuse.”
And so it did. The park trees,
with dense undergrowth, came
right to the back fence, and
from there bracken, dried grass,
weeds and all kinds of rubbish
continued without a break to the
back wall of the big wooden
shed which served as garage for
the truck, workshop, toolshed
and general junk-store. From
the side of the shed nearest the
house timber was stacked un-
tidily, and about two tons of dry
firewood was heaped near the
back porch. The house itself
was weatherboard.
“Is the house insured?” I
asked Mary.
“I don’t think it is,” she
whimpered.
I made no further comment.
But I drove Dick’s truck up to
the porch and told Mary to load
the wood on to it while I made
a break through the bracken be-
yond. Mary was an ex-typiste
who still wore high heels and
red fingernails. With a little
brutal encouragement I soon had
her loading firewood, energeti-
cally but tearfully.
I hastily cut a small break all
round the backyard, then set it
alight and pranced like a dervish
ralking escaping tongues of
flame back into the central bon-
fire, t I was soaked in sweat
after the first five minutes, but
I had a fifty-yard strip of
scorched earth between the fence
and the house at the end of half
an hour.
Mary was still loading fire-
wood, and the smoke from the
fire in the park was rolling over
us like a blanket.
I had just finished tossing the
odd lengths of timber back into
the shed when Dick came
rattling up in a friend’s truck.
Dick and his friend leaped out
in great excitement.
Dick abruptly asked what in
the name of blazes Mary was
doing with the firewood. He
told Mary to go inside and pack,
and she shot me a look of
triumph as she disappeared.
“Thanks for burning this
break,” he added more
graciously. “It gives me some-
thing to start from.” Dashing
across to the fence he set light
to the undergrowth in the park.
I SAT down wearily on the
1 step of the truck and asked
friend Dave: “What’s that for?”
“It’ll burn back to the fire
that’s already coming forward,”
explained Dave. “Oh,” I said.
“What for? So as to trap the
chaps fighting in there?”
Dave spat contemptuously.
“Nah! ”he said. “I guess they
can go back the way they came.
They had the fire well under
control when we came round.”
“If they had it well under
control, why start it again?” I
asked, honestly puzzled,
“I wouldn’t have bothered
meself,” conceded Dave. “But I
suppose Dick thinks it’s best to
be on the safe side.”
“And what about the Ranger’s
house?” I asked.
The Ranger’s house was on
the south-east corner of the
park, and was therefore likely
to catch the fire from two direc-
tions.
Dave considered this for a
moment.
“Yair,” he agreed, as he
thoughtfully gnawed a cigarette.
“The Ranger’s in there fighting
with the others. Reckon I better
go round and warn him about
this one Dick’s started.”
So off he went, and in another
hour the fire was within a hun-
dred yards of the Ranger’s north
fence and within two hundred
yards of his east fence. Twenty
of us were converging in a
semicircle around his place
when a new recruit, known
locally as “Mad Mike,” rushed
up, armed with the usual wea-
pon, a box of matches, and set
fire to the bracken to the south
of the house.
When the scarlet-faced Ranger
asked him what the unspeakable
so-and-so he thought he was
doing Mad Mike pointed out,
with the aplomb of a general ex-
plaining a complicated tactical
manoeuvre, that if the wind
changed that would make a use-
ful break.
“And what if the wind doesn’t
change for a couple of days?”
yelled the Ranger, “Your bloody
break-is heading straight for the
house! Put it out at once! ”
It took six of us half an hour
to help him do it, during which
time the flames were crackling
steadily closer to the house.
O Y midnight our numbers
*—' had swelled to thirty, and
the fire had burnt down the
Ranger’s north fence and was
only a chain away from the east
fence,
» At dawn his wife was sitting in
the middle of the road with her
four wailing children and several
neighboring wives on top of all
the household possessions she
could move. The middle of the
road was safer than the far side,
because the neighbor over there
had decided at 3 a.m. that he
had better make his fence-line
“safe,” and in so doing had
burnt his fence down, and the
posts were still red-hot beacons.
This fire had “got away” from
his fence-line at the south-east
end and was now roaring madly
through a fifteen-acre block of
virgin bush next door. How-
ever, it only belonged to a city
bloke who was growing trees as
an investment, and no one
actually lived there, so the
general opinion was that “it
couldn’t do no ’arm.”
The Ranger’s house was
eventually saved, though you
couldn’t put your hand against
the north wall, and his once
attractive little garden looked
like an overbaked cake.
A T that stage the women on the
road rushed inside and made
quarts of tea, and everyone was
wearily merry. I was mildly
surprised to see that Ted Angus
showed no sign of self-conscious-
ness regarding his part in the pro-
ceedings, while everyone seemed
to regard Dick almost as runner-
up to the Ranger in importance,
because his house had been in
some danger. Dick told the
story of my sadistic treatment of
Mary, and everyone stared at
me with interest.
Uncle Jim and I drove home
in the bright morning, and I
asked him what Ted Angus’s
motive had been lighting the
fire in the first place,
“Aw, I suppose ’e thought the
wind was going t’ change,”
Uncle Jim said. “Then it would
have just burnt in a little way
and come back on itself,”
“But why did he want to burn
the park even a little way?” I
persisted, “His own place
wouldn’t have been in any
danger, even in the biggest fire,
could it, seeing the park’s on
the south side of the road?”
“No,” agreed Uncle Jim.
“No, ’is own property couldn’t
come to no ’arm. Only the park
’adn’t ’ad a fire through it for a
few years, so I suppose 4 ’e
thought it needed it.”
After breakfast I went out
and looked at the smoky land-
scape.
I INCLE JIM’S bush block
now consisted of ten acres
of blackened spars, a few of
them with shrivelled leaves on
top. Beyond them I could see
a collection of rusty tin sheds in
a neighbor’s backyard which had
formerly been invisible.
On the other side of the road
the park was still smouldering.
Some of the giant gums had
escaped comparatively un-
harmed, but nothing under
thirty feet in height was still
alive, and one huge red-hot
mountain - ash was tottering.
When it fell it would block the
road and smash through the
telephone wires.
I turned to the green hill to
the north, and my heart fluttered
in a quick spasm of alarm. All
along the horizon smoke and
flames were rising above the
trees.
“Uncle!” I shouted. “There’s
another bushfire coming straight
for us from the north!”
I heard Uncle’s bed creak as
he sat up with a muttered ex-
clamation. He pulled up his
lowered blind and looked out.
“Aw, that! ” he croaked in dis-
gust. “That can’t do no ’arm.
That’s just Sandy Wallace
burnin’ orf!”

D.H.E.
Here’s Health!
The Government having at
last decided which diseases and
ailments those entitled to treat-
ment under the bill would be
permitted to have, the National
Health Service was in full swing.
As the hordes of clerks were
sorting out the various forms
and then shuffling them to-
gether again so as to give the
appearance of being gainfully
employed, the first applicant
came in and leaned heavily
against the counter, on which
he feebly knocked.
After about 10 minutes one
“That's the third time he's seen her home
this week."
of the clerks glanced up at the
applicant, then resumed his
form-sorting.
“I’d like to see someone
about” began the applicant,
when the clerk interrupted him.
“You’ll have to wait till one
of the fourth-class clerks comes
in. He’s the only one who can
give you a permit to be crook.”
The haggard-looking appli-
cant sank down on to one of the
comfortable ironbark benches
thoughtfully provided by the
Government for applicants for
medical treatment in their day-
long waits.
About an hour later one of
the fourth-class clerks came
back to get some cigarettes off
his desk. On his attention being
drawn to the applicant, he was
about to stroll over to the
counter when the thought struck
him that with such mad rushing
he might himself be soon seek-
ing medical treatment for high
blood-pressure, so he slowed
down his perambulation to the
counter.
“And what might you have?”
he asked the applicant, a hint of
disapproval in his voice.
“Well, for one thing,” began
the applicant, shivering in his
overcoat, “I’ve got the ’flu, I’ve
also got a -twisted intestine that
needs”
The clerk glanced at a printed
copy of diseases in alphabetical
order, then frowned.
“You are allowed under the
regulations to have influenza,”
he conceded reluctantly. “But”
—sternly—“under the Act no
person is allowed to have, a
twisted intestine. A diseased
one is allowable in certain cir-
cumstances. Interpretation of
the regulations might be strained
to permit your having a blocked
intestine. A crushed one, caused
by a falling house and/or tree,
might, with the special permis-
sion of the Minister, be made
the subject of treatment under
the National Health Service.
But -a twisted one —definitely
no! If we were to allow you to
have a twisted intestine others
would want it.
“Your other being, with cer-
tain qualifications, a disease per-
missible under the Act” —here
he reached under the counter
and produced a form —“you will
be entitled to receive medical
treatment at half rates if you
fill in this form, have the statu-
tory declaration witnessed by a
Chamber Magistrate, police ser-
geant or J.P. and returned to this
office not later than forty-eight
hours after noticing the first
symptom.”
A spasm crossed the prospec-
tive patient’s livid face as he
tried to concentrate on the
clerk’s explanation of the multi-
tudinous traps in the form.
“You will see here,” the clerk
began, “in question number
fourteen whether your maternal
grandfather ever suffered from
a strained grummet, and, if so,
if it affected his ability there-
after to ( a ) lift a piano and/or
a horse (draught or light-
draught) ; ( b ) hawk (that is,
cough-up; it bears no relation
to any commercial activity);
(c) sleep on his left side (note:
if his normal habit was to sleep
on his back this part of the
question may be ignored, unless
the strained grummet interfered
with his snoring in that position,
in which case indicate whether
he then snored with an exhala-
tory whistle or a double-
snuffle) ; {d) play (1) football;
(2) euchre; (3)
mouth-organ; (4)
the horses. Un-
less this question
is answered fully
th e application
will be refused.
Should you make
a false statement
(for example,
that your ma-
ternal grand-
father slept on his
left side habitu-
ally, knowing full
well he always
slept on his
stomach) you will
be liable to a fine
of up to fifty
pounds.”
The would-be
patient’s violent shivering at this
information was interrupted by
the clerk.
“In question fifty-seven,” he
said, “you are asked what kind
of itch, if any, is associated with
your condition. If any you
must indicate whether relief is
temporarily effected by scratch-
ing yourself ( a ) horizontally ;
( b ) vertically ; (c) transversely ;
(d) in a circular motion; ( e )
rubbing against a post. You”
“Look,” broke in the appli-
cant, “all I want is to see a
doc”
The clerk bent on him a severe
look. “You’ll do what we say,”
he rasped. “Remember, this is
a Government department. I
have to point out that failure to
say where the itch is not only
will render the application null
and void but renders you liable
to a heavy fine for not disclos-
ing vital information.
“If you are subject to morning
sickness you will have to indi-
cate what —no, this is the wrong
form.” He pulled out another
form marked “Male Only” and
began again.
“In question eighty-two we
want to know if you get giddy
when you look (d) up, (b) down,
(c) cross-eyed, (d) down in the
mouth. You must”
“Listen, I think I’ll be sick
if I stop here much longer.”
The clerk pulled another
form out, this time a bilious-
green one.
“Before you’re allowed to
you’ll have to fill in this permit
to be sick,” he said. “Have it
signed by two witnesses —riot
relatives and returned here
within twenty-four hours. Now
no further interruptions, please.
Other questions which must be
answered fully are whether any
close relatives have in the past
thirty years suffered from the
mange, excessive hair on the
chest, ringworm, flat feet, the
bends, housemaid’s knee, tennis
elbow, St. Vitus’ Dance, snow-
blindness, hydatids, fatty degen-
eration of the aorta”
“Listen, I’m fed up,” broke
in the applicant, rebellious at
last. “Bring the head clerk —-
I’ve got a complaint to”
The clerk took back the
various forms and glared,
“What are you wasting my
time for?” he barked. Only a
complaint— l thought you had a
disease!”

The Weed
It’s strange that such an inveterate
smoker as Mr. Chifley has not shown
some sympathy for the breadline smoker
by ensuring the manufacture and supply
of wholesome tobacco at a reasonable
price.
In a long life I’ve done a power of in-
haling. Early my smoking materials in-
cluded cane, tea, oatmeal, honeysuckle
cobs and dried cabbage-leaves, many of
which I liked better than some of the
weed doled out today.
Some of the stuff contains stalks long
and strong enough to boil a billy, while
the flavor and fumes could only be
appreciated by someone with no sense of
taste or smell.
The manufacture of tobacco was much
more strictly supervised 40 years ago,
although one firm got out of a prosecu-
tion for selling a mixture which, it was
alleged, contained not tobacco, but mainly
seaweed. The defendants won because
their package bore the words “Smoking
Mixture,” while the word tobacco did not
appear. .
That “Smoking Mixture” if sold today
would be regarded as a wonderful smoke.
Admittedly it was seaweed, but it was
good seaweed.— Pongo (N.S.W.).
Airmanship and Flying
Faulty airmanship and not inaccurate
radio aids to navigation (B. 17 /11 / ’4B)
has been the main cause of some of
the recent air crashes. Flying is just
like driving a can The more you fly, the
more familiar and routine it becomes.
When danger looms the pilot who has
sunk into the routine rut “prangs.”
Apart from routine medical examina-
tions there is little done by D.C.A. to
insist on pilots being trained to a
high standard of proficiency. Though
D.C.A. claims its men are better trained
than the R.A.A.F., accident figures show
a sharp difference in favor of the service.
The reason is the continual training in
airmanship stipulated by the R.A.A.F.
and the lack of it by civil companies.
Years with the R.A.A.F. taught me there
was only one way to keep pilots up to
scratch and that was through hours and
hours of training flights.
Nothing could be more routine than
a daily trip by a civil pilot. It is mono-
tony itself. The drill when an engine -
goes, when a wheel will not come down
and for other occasional faults can
be quickly forgotten by a civil pilot. Not
so with the service skipper. He goes
through his drill at least weekly.
“ Don't yell—I'm not deaf!"
R.A.A.F. squadrons had a very low acci-
dent rate. Most losses were in action,
“Circuits and bumps,” “dummy ap-
proaches,” “single-engine flying” and the
many exercises were practised regularly,
and, though hated by all, did much to
ensure a high degree of safety.
Pilots can make first-class landings,
take off gracefully, yet be useless in an
emergency if they are not up to scratch
on the many common causes of flying
accidents. Even if it means- increased
fares D.C.A. should insist on at least 12
hours’, airmanship for each airline pilot
monthly. This practice has been adopted
by America and some European countries
with success,-—Nejos (Vic.).
Radio Aids in Flying
While it is probably true that very-
high-frequency direction-finding is the
only ultimate solution for safe air-naviga-
tion in this country (B. 17/11/’4B), it
cannot be regarded as a practical solution
while aircraft are not yet structurally and
mechanically foolproof and can, there-
fore, still become lost. At present-day
speeds the resultant area of search is too
great, and so far high-frequency direction-
finding has provided the only .extension to
a navigational aid by which a lost or
crashed aircraft’s position can be deter-
mined.
To use the Lutana example again, two
messages from the aircraft on h.f.-d.f.
frequencies would have shown that the
aircraft was approaching the peak which
it ultimately hit. The pilot could have
been instructed to increase height if
below 4500 ft. or to alter course. The
fact remains that h.f.-c.r.-d.f. alone could
have given the directions necessary to
save that aircraft ; it was, moreover, an
available aid, yet it was not in use.
“Waddlin’ Willie” exaggerates the diffi-
culties of the aircraft radio-operator.
Actually, conditions of reception in air-
craft are better than on ground stations.
The type of storm which blots out recep-
tion completely is always brief, and the
d.f. can be used on the perimeters of
such storms where conditions are favor-
able, If disaster were imminent, a
screwed-down key would indicate in d.f.
log-books the time of impact and the
exact position of the crashed aircraft.
Errors in h.f.-d.f. are not commensurate
with distance. Distance causes loss in
gain and a shorter trace, but these disad-
vantages ended with the introduction of
high-gain 3C gear.
“W.W.’s” statement that he would
sooner rely on his natural sense of direc-
tion when lost cannot be the sincere con-
viction of one who had six years’ war-
time flying. The errors at first and last
light were theoretical. lonospheric-
density changes at these times damp
signals and again produce shorter (and
fainter) traces, but directional errors are
not in evidence. During the war, fads and
fears such as those based on a little
knowledge assumed gigantic proportions
among many who were not closely asso-
ciated with the operation of the system.
To argue in favor of v.h.f.-d.f. in terms
of fighter planes is not to the point—
h.f.-d.f. does not even enter into this
field.
Demanding as it does intelligence and
air-ground co-operation for effective use,
h.f.-c.r.-d.f. will be replaced by more con-
venient aids, but in the meantime it is
small comfort to know that it has been
abandoned while the installation of sup-
posedly-better aids is being contemplated.
—Luke (N.S.W.).
The results of the Lutana inquiry have
been made public, but it is hard to dis-
cern the truth in the blurred statements
issued by Ministers and officials. - One
aspect of the crash that will occur to
many ex-R.A.A.F. airmen is the number
and composition of the crew, apart from
the air-hostess.
At present, two pilots are carried on
Douglas DC3’s and each must possess
pilot’s, navigator’s and wireless-operator s
licences. But the majority of these men
are, first and foremost, pilots, and as
such their main interest lies in flying the
plane. With due respect to DC3 crews,
the exacting and confined work of routine
air navigation, which takes advantage of
all navigational aids, cannot be fully
carried out by these two-man crews. If
a plane strikes trouble, the second pilot
who turns to the navigator’s table or the
wireless equipment in an emergency is at
a disadvantage.
The confidence engendered by the
presence of a full-time reliable wireless-
operator in the crew will be attested by
ex-R.A.A.F, men; in fact, present
R.A.A.F. Transport Command DCS
crews consist of pilot, pilot-navigator and
wireless-operator. Furthermore, rigid
navigational procedure and the full use
of the wireless-operator’s services are in-
sisted on. Many a lost aircraft has been
homed safely by the war-time w.-a.-g.,
even, in an emergency, on a commercial
broadcasting station.
Installation of radar would call for
alterations in design and construction that
would not be' justified, but the added cost
of including a wireless-operator in DCS
crews should not be weighed by the
Department of Civil Aviation or civil
airline operators against public safety,—
Lim-Limbu (N.G.).
As I started this argument may I take
a hand in the finish? Like “Waddlin’
Willie” I had several years of R.A.A.F.
service. Radio-operating on the G.H.Q.
night courier between Brisbane and the
islands, I was frequently called on by the
skipper for bearings which he accepted for
his course without question. Surely
“W.W.” would not suggest that his
natural sense of direction would be of
much use flying over Cape York Penin-
sula at night.
“W.W.” makes out a convincing case
for v,h.fs,, but until this gear is installed
the problem of radio communication in
bad weather remains. I still contend that
the only solution is to include a radio-
operator in the crew so that communica-
tion with the ground may be maintained
when trouble is encountered. —Minto
(Q.).
I agree with “Waddlin’ Willie” (B.
17/11/’4B) that the high-frequency
direction-finder has been superseded, but
before forgetting it completely we might
remember that in its development Aus-
tralia led the world. The model “3C,”
used by the R.A.A.F., was superior to
anything overseas, and was entirely Aus-
tralian-designed and -built.
It did a grand job, saving many lives
and aircraft, and also did a great deal
of unmentioned work for Intelligence. In
that work the Americans, usually so far
advanced in such things, were surprised
by its accuracy and the ability of its
operators.
Regarding future air-safety in Aus-
tralia, “W.W.’s” ideas are sound except
for one point—the cost. Australia is such
a large continent, with so few aircraft
flying, that the expense of installing radio-
telephone v.h.f.-d.f. could not be con-
sidered for many years. Mullum
(N.S.W.).
Women Teachers
Having given up teaching for house-
work I’ve just had time to glance at B.
1/9/’4B and read “Experienced’s” para-
graph about women teachers. Having
been one of them, I am, of course, pre-
judiced, but it was my experience in over
10 years in city and country primary and
secondary schools that the women were
generally a better type—teaching be-
ing one of the best-paid jobs open to
women, but a poorly-paid one for men —
and far more conscientious than men.
I’ve taught in mixed and in boys’ and
girls’ schools, and found a far higher
standard of organisation and school spirit
in the last, because the work was all done
by women.—M. E. H. (N.S.W.).

Shearers
“K.Mc.” seems to have bad luck with
his shearers (B. 13/10/’4B). My mate and
I consider ourselves good shearers and
we have a regular run of good sheds
every year, starting another as soon as
one is cut out. This season, as we were
ahead of schedule, we altered our usual
programme to shear 500 sheep for an-
other owner —a two-days job if all had
gone well.
The boss had the shed full, so we
turned up Monday morning in pouring
rain to start. The handpieces were lying
as they had been left the year before, the
overhead gear had not been attended to
or oiled for 12 months, with the result
that one “gut” broke as soon as we
started and the handpieces simply burned.
We eventually got a start. The shed
was full, but it held only 100, so we cut
out early and sat down until Wednesday
afternoon, when we cut out the next shed-
ful of dry sheep. Rain still fell and we
got no more shearing until the following
Monday, when we managed another 100
before they got wet again. Heavy rain
kept us idle until another day, when we
managed to cut out altogether.
A fortnight to do two days’ work, and
all that time some neighboring shed
which held up to 700 sheep, hardly los
any time. Our cheques amounted t
£3 10s. a week each. I wonder hov
“K.Mc.’s” shed compares with this one
Although the award says one learne
to every four stands, owners can easil
get around this, and many will not em
ploy a learner because he is too slow
One owner we shear for has only thre
stands, but a learner always gets one o:
them. That owner never has any trqubl
getting shearers, and he never will.
Master-bevel (Vic.).
“No Children”
The position isn’t quite as bad as G
McDonald (B. 10/11/ ’4B) makes ou
In some areas a married couple with even
one child find it hard to get a job; i
others they are welcomed. It’s a ques
tion of using your head.
Those in search of a job in the bush
where a house and many other advan
tages in the way of firewood, water, cheap
meat and free milk are often throw
in, should look through the list of countr
schools and pick a district where on
has the minimum number of pupils re
quired by the Education Department t
keep a school open. Try that distric
and you’ll usually find that somebody
with young children will be glad to giv
you work because your children wi
ensure that the school isn’t closed down
when some of the older kiddies leave.
Similar conditions existed during th
depression. Then a man with ordinary
qualifications could hunt in vain for wori
in the country, but if he were a gooc
football player and could also play some
musical instrument needed in the loca
band or a dance orchestra, he could take
his pick of the jobs, I know a garage
mechanic who did it and he now owns
the garage.
I also know a young married couple
who, after trying in vain to get a house
in the city last year, advertised that they
would take their two kiddies to any bush
job where a house was provided anc
where a couple of extra kiddies woulc
help to keep a school open. They had
eight good offers and they are still in
the one they chose. —H. A. L. (S.A.).
Here’s the other side of the question
Unable to obtain local labor, I advertiser
for a man, children no objection, anc
received a reply from a worker in another
district. He was duly employed anc
moved into the cottage near our home
Those children —three of them —nearly
drove us frantic. They chased the horses
and cows, tormented the dogs, left gates
open, boxed the sheep and mixed the
pens of fowls and chased broody hens
off the nests. When my wife and 1
objected, the parents said that if we
wanted them to stay on we would just
have to put up with the kids.
I was paying the man much more than
he earned as a farm laborer so that I
would be sure of help for the harvest,
but just as the wheat was ripening he and
family packed up and left for a more
lucrative position. Cocky Jumbuk
(N.S.W.).
National Medicine
A salient fact, overlooked in most dis-
cussion of the Goverpment’s health
schemes, is that during the war we had a
modified form of “National Health” in
the services. As a testing-ground for the
proposals of our halfibaked Socialists,
many things were discarded, but nobody
can truthfully say that the system did not
work. The refinements of a private hos-
pital may have been missing in a general
hospital, but all patients had the best
attention possible.
During the war there was no talk of
“regimentation” of doctors, yet there was
a scramble among our medicos to get into
uniform, whether it was A.1.F., R.A.A.F.
or R.A.N. Men who should have stayed
and looked after their civilian patients
submitted to discipline, from non-medical
as well as medical superiors—in rank, that
is. They were confined to a rigid formu-
lary for their prescribing, and the forms
to be filled in were many.
Dentists, optometrists, chemists and
nurses all submitted to the ways of service
life. Never once did we hear any voice
of protest from their respective organisa-
tions. Records kept were far more
detailed than those required under Mc-
Kenna’s scheme. It was surprising
just what went down on the forms, and
nqt one but dozens had access to them.
I can't recall that this ever adversely
affected anyone.
Much has been made of the secrecy
between doctor and patient. Is it really
necessary? Spend a few minutes in any
doctor’s waiting-room and you will hear
discussions on operations, etc., which
women and men tell complete strangers,
right to the gory details. One could be
pardoned for thinking that they want
people to know of their infirmities. —
R. W. (N.S.W.),


Women in Industry
As The Bulletin has remarked,
women in industry are a national
problem. I’ve worked in a big cotton
mill, and seen something of it.
At present there are shifts for part-
time workers, some women clock on at
9 a.m. and work until 2.45 p.m. Another
shift works from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Then
there are the ordinary full-time day
workers from 8 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.
The women who work the evening shift
see their husbands and families only at
breakfast and week-ends. Those who
work all day have to rush round in the
mornings and evenings, and are subject to
considerable nervous strain.
Overtime aggravates the problem from
the home point of view. Wages are high
—£4 14s. 6d. for 40 hours, with overtime
at time-and-a-half for the first three
hours and then double-time. It is entirely
voluntary, but recently it was available
every night in one week, and many
women worked 20 hours overtime, mak-
ing 60 in all.
Now the overtime is cut down to two
or three nights—four hours a night and
Saturday mornings—and the women rush
it. Some are widows or middle-aged
women whose families have grown up,
but many are young women with small
children. Their homes and families must
suffer for it. — Fodgie (S.A.).
“The Dust-bowl”
Australia now has a dust-bowl that
cannot be reclaimed without millions of
men and money. It will need scores of
local schemes of irrigation, an enormous
tree-planting plan and revegetation of the
country to stop the dust.
For a start we should rest the country
and give the herbage a chance to grow
after the next rain. We might have to
evacuate and compensate the settlers and
then plant a Maginot line of trees,
roughly from Broken Hill to Quilpie.
Most of our drought-resisting trees are
slow-growing, but a deep belt of salt-
bush might stop the invading dust.
The dust-bowl comes east all the time ;
it never ceases to move. Yet we
have in Morris Park at Broken Hill
a spectacular example of how vegetation
can stop soil erosion. Immediately after
the next big rain the Government should
send planes to scatter seeds of indigenous
herbage and scrubs. Our inland
country is being ruined by sheet-erosion
—it does not erode in great gullies as in
farming areas, but the very fine dusty
top-soil is being blown away in clouds.
Also, much of the fine sand that
is covering and ruining feed and silting
up waterholes is being blown over from
the Lake Eyre and Simpson desert areas.
In another 50 years of neglect the tragedy

Brisbane
“Brisbane,” said the noted British town-
planner Sir Patrick Abercrombie, “re-
minds me of a country town multiplied
several hundred times.” It was an apt
summing-up of an Australian city which
has grown unplanned along the winding
Brisbane River, and amid the ragged
humps along its course which rank as
hills.
Nevertheless Brisbane has interesting
points for a southerner spending some
time within its environs. After high-
pressure life in present-day Sydney
(where the comedy of manners has in
almost every essential respect become the
tragedy of bad manners), Brisbane retains
a friendly humanity which belongs much
more truly to the Australian tradition in
which we like to believe. The city is
fairly crowded, but not to the fight-for-
survival level of Sydney.
Although Brisbane’s population is
nearing the half-million mark, the State’s
population is growing just as fast; there
are nearly twice as many people in
Queensland outside Brisbane as there are
in it —a healthy contrast to Sydney. As
a result, one misses in Brisbane the
arrogant Sydney assumption that nought
matters beside its commercial supremacy ;
Brisbane is a capital, but it knows there
are big and powerful interests outside,
and that the day may come when other
capitals will arise
The footpaths in the main city streets
are almost littered with stalls selling art-
union tickets, Christmas hampers, sewing-
machines, almost anything; the streets
look at times like an Eastern bazaar.
Footpath navigation in busy periods is
becoming something of a task. Yet it is
pleasant to move about a place
which can afford to be leisurely, where
every square inch is not necessarily
mortgaged to human movement. Lottery-
ticket shops are the principal pests,
their number rather incredible when the
demand for legitimate shops is heavy.
Brisbane’s trams are pleasantly clean
and modern, with no footboard danger to
conductors, though tram-tracks are out-
moded . and congested through bad
original planning ; feeder-bus services are
good; trains are old, slow, dirty, far be-
hind the needs of a modern city. There's
much talk about electrification of sub-
urban railways.
Hotels are supposed to be open till
10 p.m., but seem to close at the whim
of the publican—the casual attitude of
the liquor trade to the man-in-the-street
suggests a confidence that neither Govern-
ment nor police will interfere too readily.
Average closing-time is from 7 p.m. to
8 p.m.; few if any remain open until
legal closing-time. Few hotels are attrac-
tive ; most are beer-houses, even worse
than in N.S.W., except that the six-o’clock
swill is missing. Licensing authorities are
demanding better standards, and busily
closing a number of useless country grog-
shops, but nobody seems to worry much
about bad standards in Brisbane itself.
Life eases off in the four main hot
summer months; Brisbane is an eight-
months-of-the-year city; November to
February is a period of semi-comatose
letting-up.— Dee (Q.).
Amateur Radio Licences
As “Waddlin’ Willie” asserts (B.
10/11/’4B), post-war radio amateurs are
not, in some respects, comparable with
the old “hams,” but it isn’t altogether the
fault of the newcomers. The difference
today is that between “amateur” and
“experimenter.” The P.M.G. licence now
comes under the second consideration,
following similar British P.O. action. If
the 1948 amateur never experiments in
the true sense (and plenty do) he is legally
justified in his microphone-meanderings
for the reason that communication is now
the first consideration. Just how he does
this and how far he keeps within the
bounds of regulations is a matter for the
P.M.G., and any lack of control from
authority is thus reflected in the general
tone.
One detrimental step was abolishing
the pre-war probationary period, which
decreed that new licensees function for
six months on telegraphic communication
only, no telephony being permitted until
Vigilance Committee sanction be given.
But the P.M.G. Wireless Branch is not
to blame for “scrubbing” the probationary
period—pressure from the Wireless In-
stitute was responsible.
The Wireless Branch, however, is to
blame for the manner in which so-called
“advisory” committees function. These
have taken the place of pre-war “Vigil-
ance Committees.” They function under
the chairmanship of an inspector
appointed by the State Superintendent
and consist of three amateurs nominated
“Which ones Mummy, mister ?”
by the W.I.A. and three non-W.I.A. men
chosen by the whim and fancy of indi-
viduals.
There have been complaints in one
State that irritation tactics on the part of
so-called “observers” in suburban and
country areas have resulted in consider-
able ill-feeling. In one or two instances
pioneer radiomen who have held experi-
mental licences from the earliest days
have been subjected to pin-pricking
“official” communications, generally
originating from some callow youth
“observer” virtually not dry behind the
ears.
There certainly is need for care in
issuing amateur licences, but there is
need for even more care in choosing
people who are to exercise authority
over the “hams.” — Hadit (N.S.W.).
Regulations
I’m a country chemist and, as such,
am permitted to keep my shop open until
7.30 p.m. Being in the main street of a
popular tourist resort, my trade is con-
siderably increased if I carry various
fancy-goods such as china, and many
other chemists do the same.
For some years I’ve been legally
obliged to partition off these fancy-goods
at ordinary closing-time. Similarly, news-
agents carrying my “lines” have been
officially obliged to use partitions. How-
ever, like a lot of other laws, this par-
titioning has never been enforced until
recently. Business in our town has been
conducted fairly and squarely, forbidden
“lines” being draped, or simply not sold,
after ordinary hours.
The Department of Labor and Industry
has lately .changed all that. Its inspectors
descended on the town and forced us all
to use partitions after 5.30 p.m. That
means I’ve had to have the carpenters in
and must waste 20 minutes or so every
day juggling with confounded partitions.
Only a minor nuisance, I suppose, but a
typical product of bureaucracy. I must
obey or lose a considerable amount of
trade by ceasing to carry fancy-goods.
Surely the Department of L. and I.
has more useful things to do than plague
people over these harmless “offences.”
Such action causes endless ill-feeling and
waste of time and tends to make petty
criminals of us all. —P. D. (N.S.W.).
Housing
When the Housing Commission’s repre-
sentative goes abroad, as recently fore-
cast, to investigate the possibilities of
building pise houses, he should make a
point of visiting the continent, especially
Norway, North Germany, France and
Switzerland, where for years they have
been specialising in cheap housing.
In place of earth, however, those
countries lean to the use of lime and sand,
proportions being nine parts lime to one
part sand. Houses, stores and even
bridges are built of this mixture, some of
the houses consisting of several stories.
The sand and lime must be .very
thoroughly mixed and the sand free from
any clayey content. Methods of con-
struction, forming, etc., are identical with
those used in earth pise, but the ramming
is done more lightly.
Building with lime and sand is slower
than with earth, as the former must be
allowed a setting period of 24 hours be-
tween layers. Many of the lime-and-
sand houses in Norway are in splendid
condition after as much as 120 years. —

Timber
“H.C.’s” statement (B. 10/11/’4B) that
he was offered 3s. per 100 super, for
standing hardwood and 12s. per 100
super, for logs on a property near Sydney
is an eye-opener, since hardwood at 60s.
per 100 is unobtainable in Sydney.
When ordering hardwood for'a cottage
yesterday my list included 4in. x 4in.,
4in. x Sin. and 4in. x 2in, When
4in. x 4in. and 4in. x Sin. were mentioned
the order clerk said “Forget it, sir, nothing
so heavy on hand.” “What about 4in.
x 2in.?” I asked. “Might manage some
of that,” he answered. “Right—give me
100 9ft. lengths.”
“Couldn’t look at that quantity, sir,”
said the clerk. “Order again in January.”
By January hardwood will probably
be priced at 655. per 100 super, feet. —

Root of the Matter
The divorced man, victim of anomalies
in income-tax law, misses out on some
concessional rebates. Take the case of
a man who has custody of his daughter
and whose ex-wife is still living. While
the daughter is under 16 the taxpayer
may claim child rebate, or student-child
rebate if she is under 19. But if the
daughter then continues to live at home,
is maintained by her father and is en-
gaged wholly in keeping house for him,
he isn’t allowed a penny. To qualify
for the daughter-housekeeper rebate, a
male taxpayer must be a widower. — Jen

Issue No. S 3 of the “Lae Garamut”
(literally the “Drum”) contains one
definition of Administration policy on
commerce in New Guinea. Written in
pidgin, and addressed to the natives, the
paragraph says, “There have been com-
plaints about high prices. Our advice
to you all is to study the price-list before
you buy. If an item is reasonable, buy
it; if it is too dear, then do not buy it.
If you do not receive value for your
money or consider you have been taken
down, the Government can do nothing
about it; it is simply a transaction be-
tween you and the storekeeper. There-
fore consider well before you buy.” “Lae
Garamut” is published by the Depart-
ment of Education and gives news of
interest to the native population. This
information, with its unconcern about
the unscrupulous trader and its disin-
terested attitude towards high prices
generally, is hardly likely to give confi-
dence in the present Administration. —

The farce of the Commonwealth Loans
and National Savings Organisation’s pub-
licity campaign continues. We’ve all
heard the extravagant quiz session over
the air, but who, after listening, feels an
overwhelmiqg desire to rush off and sub-
scribe? Then there is the “Loans Bulle-
tin,” the November issue of which ad-
vises that “People should learn to tell
their money where to go—instead of ask-
ing where it went.” I wish Mr, Chifley
would heed that. — Ceg (Vic.).

There is at least one authentic Aus-
tralian novel that doesn’t glorify strikers,
and admits Australia to be a land of
good wages and opportunity (B.
20/10/’4B) —Rolf Boldrewood’s In Bad
Company, one of his shorter efforts. It
deals with the great shearers’ strike of the
1890’s. The hero, a decent young selector
who takes shearing jobs to get capital, is
framed by extremist shearers and finds
himself facing a criminal charge. Friends
and neighbors who respect his character
and that of his wife —one of Boldrewood’s
best female figures—rally round and the
crime is sheeted home to the real culprit,
an unpleasant union agitator. Some of
the union-leaders described remind one
of certain authentic specimens of today.—

Fellowship of Writers
“Old Freelance” is right on the target
(B. 1/12/’4B). I was a member of the
Fellowship of Australian Writers for
many years and took an active part in
its affairs. Ten to 15 years ago its
membership listed most of the names then
well-known in Australian literature and
many who have since made their mark.
Today, the F.A.W. is more notable for
the names not included in its list, and, as
“0.F.” points out, has no claim whatever
to consideration as a body representative
of Australian writers.
The average writer is an individualist,
disinclined to regimentation of any sort,
but at the same time he likes to meet
and to talk shop with others of his craft.
Few writers are organisers and prefer to
remain in the ranks rather than accept
the responsibilities and duties of th* ex-
ecutive committee, particularly the presi-
dency and secretarial duties.
It was, therefore, a simple matter for a
few Leftwingers to get a foothold in the
committee, where their persistent tactics
gradually disgusted the genuine writers
and completely dispelled every trace of
“fellowship” and the bulk of writers from
its ranks.
Today, the freelance in Australia has
greater need for a body to look after
his rights than ever before. There is no
relation between the upward climb of the
cost of living and rates for freelance work.
The average wharfie draws more money
per day than the Australian freelance does
in a week, and, speaking as one who has
done both jobs, I know which is the more
exacting. The most successful‘Australian
writers, apart from journalists in regular
jobs, cannot hope to earn enough to
live comfortably and support a family;
consequently they drift into other occupa-
tions that offer a regular return and
some security.
The present system of taxing royalties
must have been evolved by someone
determined to kill writing in Australia.
The winner of the lottery gets his £6OOO
free of tax, but the winner of a literary
competition, who may have put years of
research and preparatory work into his
effort, loses more than half of his reward
in taxation. Publication of his work
is highly vulnerable to paper shortages
and pther restrictions and to the un-
accountable whims of publishers. The
individual writer can do nothing to pro-
tect himself against those things, and
writers are perhaps the most difficult of
all people to organise. The F.A.W. was
doing something for them until it em-
barked on “cultural” tactics; today it is
only the stamping-ground of a vociferous
minority and has forfeited the sympathy
and allegiance of writers.
There are other bodies of writers but
they are mainly social in character.
There is every need for a new body that
writers will be glad to belong to —one
that will be truly representative of Aus-
tralian writing.-
