Where Can
FUJI Electric Help?
Looking at the ambitious develop-
ment programs being carried out in
Australia, we keep asking this ques-
tion. And the answer keeps coming
back in the form of orders—from
government, from industry, and
from a multitude of private citizens.
It seems that they’ve all discovered
that where electricity needs to be
generated, transmitted, distributed
or put to work, Fuji Electric usually
has a more economical, more ef-
ficient way to do it.
The man in the street and his wife
are probably most familiar with
Fuji’s fine line of home appliances
which have made their daily lives
so much more pleasant, healthy
and efficient. Washing machines and
vacuum cleaners take the drudgery
out of cleaning, while TV sets, stereo
equipment and transistor radios give
new sparkle and vigor to recreation.
Our proudest accomplishment has
been showing thousands of fam-
ilies how fresh-squeezed fruit and
vegetable juices can set the founda-
tion for true health and stamina , . .
especially when the juices are scien-
tifically extracted with a Fuji Juicer.
But leaders in government and
industry know how Fuji Electric can
help and has helped in many ways
that are fundamental to Australia’s
long-term development. The first
contribution was made in the 950
KW Pelton-type turbine and genera-
tor which was delivered to the Snowy
Mountains Authority in 1964. Other
important projects to which Fuji has
contributed, or will contribute, in-
clude the Para Substation, the
Lemonthyme Power Station, and the
Wilmot Power Station.
Where can Fuji Electric help?
In components, in appliances, in
equipment, in complete systems
for the generation, transmission and
utilization of electricity.

WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’65 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’65
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Hermitage
Long weeks of sunshine and
a rain-free vintage period
favoured the sensitive Her-
mitage (Shiraz) grapes in
1962. After two years in oak,
the wine was bottled and lain
down for further maturing.
Now obtainable, this Hermi-
tage is soft and generous
a full, distinctive wine.
Coonawarra Estate
’6O Cabernet
Made entirely from the rare
Cabernet Sauvignon grape,
this Cabernet was matured at
the Estate for two years in
oak and then further bottle-
matured for four years before
being released for sale. With
a pronounced Cabernet nose,
this wine is full and soft on
the palate, with a firm tannin
finish.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz* pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from.Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

LETTERS
The PKI and Indonesia
Sir,
It is always nice to receive lectures
on objectivity from semi-decontaminated
totalitarians. May I answer Mr. Morti-
mer’s points in turn briefly?
(1) PKI complicity. Whenever I
raised this issue in Djakarta I was met
with incredulity that I really meant
this question and then with laughter.
Mr. Mortimer is free to dismiss the
proceedings of the Special Military
Court in Djakarta and the massive
testimony of witnesses from all walks
of life as fabrications. It is logically
possible to do so, in the sense in which
it was logically possible for Mr. Morti-
mer to maintain in 1950 that there were
no concentration camps in the Soviet
Union. The odd thing about Mr. Morti-
mer’s letter is that it seems to insinuate
that I am the only person in public life
to take PKI complicity for granted. One
really should not judge the political
standards of the community by the
murky dreamworld of Monash Univer-
sity, where this kind of stuff may go
down. To do so may be a very expensive
mistake, not made by Mortimer alone.
(2) PKI and national bankruptcy. Of
course, the PKI was not the only part
of the Sukarno racket. The PKI was,
however, the chief motor and instigator
behind Sukarno’s crazy, irresponsible,
and extensive adventurism in foreign
and domestic policy. The PKI supplied
Sukarno with his "Ministry of the
masses.”
(3) The information about the cor-
rupt life-style of PKI leaders comes not
only from KAMI leaders. One of my
informants on this was a distinguished
activist of the World Council of
Churches, who, whilst opposed to the
PKI, is an admirer of Russia. Again,
the comparison of KAMI leaders, repre-
senting almost all sections of student
opinion in Indonesia, including the John
Birch Society (KAMI is a coalition roof-
body of different societies), is a relapse
into Monash standards of political dis-
course quite unworthy of a former
editor of the “Guardian.”
(4) PKI flabbiness was one cause of
its defeat. The work of anti-Communist
activists another cause. And there were
many more causes. Did Mr. Mortimer
never hear about multiple interacting

AUSTRALIA AND
NEW ZEALAND BANK
LIMITED
Highlights from the Chairman’s Statement for the year ended 30th Sept., 1966
Steady growth of the Bank pontinues.
Trading Bank deposits increased by 10%.
Savings Bank deposits increased by 10%.
Trading Bank advances increased by 8%.
Housing advances by Savings Bank
now total SABO million.
REPRESENTATION. The Bank extended its
representation to the British Solomon Islands
with establishment of a branch at Honiara.
Altogether 29 branches were, opened in Aus-
tralia during the year thus increasing the total
number of offices to 1142.
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. Australia had a
satisfactory but not spectacular year. It seems
that the level of business confidence continues
to be subdued and that a further small official
stimulus would be appropriate.
The Bank believes that changes in interest
rates, now more readily adopted by the
authorities, are a valuable aid to economic
policy.
Economic policy requirements dictated a re-
laxation of credit to help maintain business
activity and employment levels during the year.
DROUGHT. Lending policy was particularly
directed towards alleviating effects of the
drought and assisting activity in building,
especially house construction.
FARM LOANS. The Farm Development Loan
Fund has aroused interest in banking circles
as a departure from traditional practices, par-
ticularly because of the longer terms involved
and its possible relevance to other financial
demands in Australia.
i
NEW DEVELOPMENT. There are pressures
from many quarters to help meet the demands
of all sectors of industry for cheap term
finance, which would assist in securing a
higher Australian equity interest in develop-
ment projects. A more satisfactory way of
dealing with these larger requirements would
be the establishment of a separate finance
corporation sponsored by the Banks and pos-
sibly other large financial institutions.
The Bank gratefully acknowledges
the goodwill and confidence of its customers throughout Australia.

(5) Yes, I did spend only three days
in Djakarta and 25 years on the study
of Communism in a dozen or so dif-
ferent countries. Mr. Mortimer should
ask the assorted “intellectuals” who
befouled the pages of the daily Press
with vacuously status-flaunting adver-
tisements on the eve of the Federal
Election, dispensing advice on policies
in areas which they were unable to point
out on the map how much time they
had spent in Vietnam, or, indeed, on
activities other than professorial back-
stabbing.

Tidying the Tresses
Sir,
I wish to draw your attention to an
article headed “The Obsolescent
Milliner” (8., Oct. 22). Tovar Tresses
(Aust.) Pty. Ltd. and Ultra Hats are
two entirely separate companies; the
latter has no interest whatsoever in the
former, and the only link is that I am
a director of both and use Ultra’s
address for office purposes.
Whilst millinery sales throughout the
world are “off” in volume, Ultra is
carrying on a very satisfactory business.
The statement at the end of the first
paragraph in your article was never
made. The figures and wording in para-
graph two are again incorrect. We are
also marketing Pure Hair Goods and
have been operating since the end of
March, 1966.

THE FATE OF LEICHHARDT
86 Years Ago: December 25, 1880.
JN offering a reward of one
thousand pounds for the discovery
of any traces of LEICHHARDT and
his party that may lead to the solu-
tion of the mystery of their fate, the
proprietors of this journal hope that
their action may be the means of
publishing to the world what would
be the last and most interesting
chapter in the history of Australian
exploration.
Thirty-two years ago LUDWIG
LEICHHARDT left on his ill-starred
journey. Men have been born and
lived, and died since then, and yet
against all probabilities we have at
times a picture in our minds of a
lonely white-haired man, bowed with
age and grief, whose fading memory
will not suffice to recall the language
of his youth: across whose brain only
at times dimly flits a notion that he
was once superior to the degraded
savages whose camp he has shared
through so many weary years of wait-
ing and hoping. That this picture
with its sequel of the white men
arriving at last and carrying him—
half unwilling—back to the life he
has almost forgotten cannot now be
realised, we know; but we have not
given up the hope that the survivors
or survivor of the party left some
message for their fellow men; nor
that the desert will be made to give
up its trust, even though it has
jealously guarded it through so many
years.

There are many points on which

I would challenge Brian Buckley’s

interpretation of my views (8., Dec.
3), but the one to which I take most
exception is the statement that I
am “too readily anti-Soviet.” I had
thought that only unregenerate Stalinists
equated any criticism of Soviet policies
or actions with anti-Sovietism. For my
part I am ardently pro-Soviet in the
sense that I admire its social system
and most of the policies for which it
stands, something I cannot say for the
United States. That I may adopt such
a position, while being fiercely critical
°f some features of Soviet life which
do not measure up to my concept of
socialist practice, appears to me to be
in no way inconsistent. As Mr. Buckley
himself notes in his article, I consider
that “constructive criticism of negative

nition of the end of the Age of Menzies. You’re
Lucky!

Cinders: I didn’t know there was one on.

There is a blinding flash of dullness and the Demon

She treads softly carrying her wand (a kind of big
stick). She waves it at a pumpkin, six pounds of new
potatoes, a shin of beef (with marrow bone jelly), a
book of verse, a slurp of wine, takes a pair of sparkl-
ing eyes and sort of tosses them into a skidproof
mixing bowl with Care (or Cur). The lights dim as

All the Way with Frances Faye
Lighting up Chequers like a Christmas tree
By CHARLES HICHAM
THE circular curtain that looks like
,-a gold cake wrapping at Chequers
flies up, everyone in the audience
seems to be wearing spectacles, girls
dressed as silver Christmas trees
shimmy, a female impersonator does a
Dietrich imitation and removes a
sponge from one breast (“My playtex
living bra dies of starvation), Joe
Martin appears in drag, and then she
hits the stage. She’s wearing chiffon,
covered in those multicolored things
you see in front of your eyes when
drunk or when blinking against the sun.
Her hair is black, ’twenties style; her
eyes are silvered, fringed with a stock-
ade of eyelash.
She taps out the rhythm with a green
satin shoe; it isn’t exactly a Stein way
grand, and her fingers are getting worn
to the bone. She still limps from
operations on her hip. And yet, with a
tremendous dynamic attack, with an
electric vitality that rushes out at you
like a wind, she’s superb. She breaks
up a song into pieces, singing often only
a few honkytonk bars, chatting with
the orchestra, chiding the audience —but
it doesn’t matter: this is her way of
drawing the audience closer and closer
into a feeling of intimacy, of friendship
with the performer. The mood is one
of exultancy, of love of life won against
pain: a conviction she’s ugly, a broken
hip. She makes jokes against herself
(“During the daytime I’m always wear-
ing a mini-skirt and I don’t know who
I am—l’m very neat and meticulous —
you can eat off me!”).
She plays with a strong sense of chal-
lenge, as though to say: OK, Fate, Fm
coming out slugging, you gave me a bad
deal. The fabulous baroque mask of a
face on stage (off stage it becomes
softer, warmer, less aggressive, kind)
remains almost deadpan even through
the most feral shrieks she delivers at
the end of the number, the loudest
squeals of the band.
She shouts the numbers with a terrific
nervous energy, still the fine speakeasy
belter banging away hard on the key-
board—“ Night and Day” and “Just in
Time” in particular are brilliantly man-
aged, with skilful adaptations of the
lyrics. She has shots—genial, not
malicious—at people like Noel Coward
(“I know a song of his—Lord knows
I’m not a schoolgirl!”), and delivers
a wry theme tune “A pretty girl is like
a melody” as a joke against herself. And
later, in a dressing-room I once inter-
viewed Dick Haymes and a vodka
bottle in, she is no less alive, sympa-
thetic, crackling with the energy of the
Los Angeles she comes from.
“Your name is H-I-G-H-A-M.
Higham. You know, that’s good. Jewish
people when they take a drink and say
haim, that’s a kind of good thing. A
welcome word. But there’s a fly on
your bare leg. You see? I’m going
to buy you long socks. I’ll make a note
of that. Buy Higham long socks to-
morrow. You mustn’t wear short socks.
Ely on your leg—ugh! Let me see,
when’s your birthday—no, I don’t want
to know the year. Aquarius. And I’m
Scorpio. That’s OK, fine.
“Good. Now.” She relaxes with a
gin, happy with the signs. “I don’t
drink as a rule, but I’ll have this little
one. You know what pain is?
Sickness is? The doctor said, I want
you to lie in bed for a year — me! I
screamed and screamed you could
hear me in Israel! My three opera-
tions, they took my hip out and put it

socks for you tomorrow flies!

hallucinations!

to think, if I could walk I’d engulf the

“I was playing at the New Frontier,
at Las Vegas. And I was crippled . . .
there were these security guards . . .
like, six foot five . . . they carried me : —
and I mean this is the truth! And they

could set me down on the bench. And
I played—l forgot I broke my hip.
And Dietrich. She was playing at the
Sahara. She never goes anywhere —she
wouldn’t go see a — forget it! And
every single night she was out there,
drinking beer—and when she saw them

gave me pills —they helped me so —•
she’d say, I’m going to bring you Fer-

“You know how I began? I studied

a big girl —slim girls just don’t know

theatres, nightclubs, Brooklyn, Detroit.
One night the singer said, ‘lf I left you

out of nowhere, I remember this as

came up to her and said you’re
fired . . .
“So I was on my own. ‘She stays,’ he
said of me. I was petrified —but I
played piano. Sang. And A 1 Capone
came. And his wife was beautiful—
and religious! So much so you can
forget it! And she had this boy; she
brought him up like a monk . . .
“AND later, there was Barbara Stan-
wyck—she brought Charles Coburn
to a place I was playing on his eightieth
birthday. They danced. And she said
to me, ‘I wouldn’t come to this toilet
if it weren’t to see you,’ and I said,
‘Maybe you’d like to meet the manager.’
And he was just standing there —and he
died. And Sophie Tucker. You know,
when she was here she was so sad.
The notices were so bad and she died.
She’d say to me, ‘lf anything happens
to me, you’re the only one left.’ ”
I mentioned Helen Morgan, once
Sophie Tucker’s rival and the greatest
star of the ’twenties. “Helen Morgan!
Look at my arm! Just mentioning her
name makes me feel goose-pimples. I
shiver. She never wore make-up, and
just a black crepe sleeveless dress and
a bracelet just one with a zillion
charms on it so now, remember, she
was always a star —maybe one of the
greatest stars of the nightclubs—and so
remember I came from Brooklyn (well, I
was playing at a Brooklyn theatre and
it was m'ine I mean, I was the star,
and I would just swing there). Anyway,
I saw her name way down below in
small letters, below mine, and I cried
so much, I cried and cried! I said,
‘My God, I’m not going to allow this,’
and I went to the manager before the
first show, said, ‘Mr. Brandt, how dare
you put Helen Morgan’s name so small,’
and he said, ‘She won’t bring me any
audience at all, Fran,’ and I said,
‘You will change that billing!’ and he
said, ‘You’re the first artist who ever
came to me and asked me to do some-
thing like that.’ I knew she was going
down for ever when she came in for
the first show and you just knew she’d
never taken her dress off the night
before. She was still wearing it. She
was rotten rotten on bad liquor,
and she died in Chicago, and she was
the greatest, until Judy . . . Do you
want a coughdrop? You don’t?
“Well, I guess that’s enough. You’ll
stop over? I never asked anyone to
stop over before —and you’ll eat?
Scrambled eggs? wild! I’ll have
them, too and strawberries and
tea?” And from then on, for two hours
of scrambled eggs and strawberries,
with tea, until well past midnight, the
conversation was strictly off the record.


Pop Artist on Trial
Michael Brown , three months ' hard labor
By MONTY DENNISON
IN the first “pop art” indecency trial
in Australia and one of the few
in the world a young Sydney
artist has been found guilty of deliver-
ing indecent paintings to a Paddington
art gallery. After a four-day hearing,
which began in November, Mr. G. A.
Locke, S.M., last week sentenced the
artist, Michael Brown, 28, to three
months’ hard labor. Mr. Brown has
since appealed.
The hearing took place in the Pad-
dington Courthouse, a large grey stone
building which seems out of place
among the newly renovated terraces.
Inside, the normally drab appearance
of the Court of Petty Sessions was
enlivened by Mr. Brown’s four brightly
colored paintings. Two leaned against
the defendant’s box and one, with a
painting on either side, was propped
against the wall.
Mr. Brown, a tall, slender young man,
sat quietly during the hearing near his
barrister, Mr. K. G. Horler. He wore a
light brown lapelless coat, brown tie,
and dark slacks. His father and a few
friends sat on one side of the court-
room. There were few spectators.
Delivering his judgment, the Magis-
trate described the paintings as an “orgy
of obscenity” that placed undue
emphasis on sex, sex organs, and sex
symbols. (The large abstract paintings
depicted among other things nudes and
four-letter words.)
Recalling that defence witnesses—
artists and art critics—had not found
the paintings indecent, he said that it
was the Court’s responsibility alone to
decide whether they were indecent. As
a member of the community, he looked
at the paintings not as an art con-
noisseur, art student, or art critic, but
as an inexpert, ordinary man.
As to Mr. Horler’s submission that
attitudes toward sex were changing
and that the community accepted pub-
lic discussion of sex, he said: “Does
society permit the flaunting of sex,
the debasing of the female form, or
are they being foisted on an unwilling
community by a noisy and arrogant
few?” The Magistrate deplored the
“noticeable tendency” toward sex in
“much of the stuff appearing these days
in the guise of literature, art, and the
films. I believe the great majority of
decent people mothers and fathers
responsible for rearing their children
feel very deeply about these tendencies.
These people look to the law and to
the courts to do something about it.”
In opening his case, Mr. Horler
submitted there was no evidence that
Mr. Brown had delivered the paintings
to the gallery. He also claimed the
prosecution had to prove that the exhi-
bition of the paintings constituted an
“outrageous affront to the public
decency of the citizens of Sydney.” In
fact, the standards of decency were con-
stantly changing and what was indecent
in 1868 might not be so in 1966, “In
view of the changes that have taken
place, are we to judge what is fit and
proper for adults who seek out a gallery
to see certain paintings? . . . One would
like to think we’re past the stage where
an artist of sincerity has to defend him-
self in a court of law.”
Furthermore, he said, the Crown had
not given evidence that the pictures
lacked artistic merit; two defence wit-
nesses and a Crown witness, in fact,
agreed the works did have artistic merit.
Both defence witnesses stressed that in
judging a picture, they considered the
whole of the work rather than indi-
vidual parts. “No evidence was given
of any complaint by an outraged citi-
zen. Who was upset and felt his
decency was affronted? Some anony-
mous person set this in motion; the
police are strangely quiet.”
The prosecutor, however, Sergeant
R. D. Martin, said, on the question of
delivery, that evidence indicated Brown
intended the paintings to be delivered
and sold. As for the paintings, “It is
perhaps difficult to conceive any greater
form of indecency in the form of a
painting than wliat is before the Court.”
He disagreed with Mr. Horler that such
pictures would affect only “prickly”
Brown with an earlier work
minorities. “In this State it is the
minorities that are trying to foist
matters of this type on to the public.”
At the beginning of the hearing,
Detective Senior Constable Frederick
Kitto, of the Vice Squad, told the
Court he went to Gallery A Exhibitions
Pty. Ltd., Gipps Street, on November
.22, 1965, as a result of a complaint.
He did not know who had complained.
This was ten days after the exhibition
opened and two days before it was to
close.
The chairman and managing director
of the gallery, Charles Maxwell Rowan
Hutchinson, said invitations to the
exhibition’s opening were sent to about
400 people, mainly art connoisseurs.
These included a Supreme Court judge,
schoolteachers, university professors,
and solicitors. He estimated 100 per-
sons attended the opening function, and
100 on each of the days it was open.
Referring to a painting with writing
in the middle of it, the Magistrate asked
if it were not the product of “a dis-
ordered mind.” Answer: “No.” The
Magistrate then directed Mr. Hutchin-
son’s attention to some sexual imagery
in one of the paintings.
Question: “What contribution does
that make to that successful piece of
pop art?” Answer: “I would say in this
case it has got something to do with a
virtual popular image in the teenager,
the miscreant, the group of people in
society that perhaps make sex a low
thing. My personal knowledge of Brown
puts him completely and utterly above
this category. As an artist I would say
he is attempting to make these particu-
lar images so commonplace that they
are accepted without their sexual conno-
tations.” Mr. Hutchinson said he re-
garded the picture as sexless.
John Reed, a founder of the Museum
of Modern Art in Melbourne and the
Contemporary Art Society of Victoria,
said he believed all Mr. Brown’s works
that had been on display at the gallery
—a total of 33 —had artistic merit and
were significant works of art.
Mr. Reed explained that his response
to a painting was visual. When asked
by Mr. Horler whether he was aware of
any sexual reaction to the painting, he
replied: “Not as far as I am concerned.
I see sexual images in it, but I get no
particular sexual reaction myself.”
The prosecutor objected when Mr.
Horler asked whether it was likely such
a work could provoke a sexual reaction.
The Magistrate said: “What is the rele-
vance of that? We are not concerned
here with the likelihood of depravity.”
Mr. Horler: “We are concerned as to
whether these paintings offend against
decency.” The Magistrate: “I have
already ruled, however, that that is for
the Court.” Later, the Magistrate said
there was overwhelming evidence that
the paintings had artistic merit.
The prosecutor asked whether Mr.
Reed remembered seeing a sign on one
of the paintings, “Nude for Rudeness
Sake,” or a sentence that began “So
go bloody . . Mr. Reed said he could
not recall the specific words. Drawing
Mr. Reed’s attention to a painting, the

MASTER-KEYED SYSTEMS
A Master-Keyed System is one in which each
lock has its own individual key, which oper-
ates that lock only and no other, but where
each lock is also built to a Master-Key which
will open all locks in the group.
Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to. the Master-Key.

GRAND MASTER-KEYED SYSTEM
Each lock has its own individual key which
operates that lock only and no other, but the
locks are divided into two or more groups.
Each group is subject to its own Master-Key,
which opens all locks in that group, but no
other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a
Grand Master-Key which opens all locks in
all groups.
As with Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Alike
groups may also be included in G.M.K. Systems.

prosecutor asked whether the represen-
tation of a man’s genitalia was ugly.
“I would have to answer categorically
no,” Mr. Reed replied. Mr. Reed several
times explained that painting to him
was a visual experience and that he
responded to the totality of the work
rather than to details.
The Magistrate commented: “It has
already become apparent, and I say this
not in the least disdainfully of the wit-
ness, that the witness is quite unaware
of some of the detail of some of these
exhibits and the extraordinary thing is
that the detail of which he is unaware
is the first thing that would strike the
ordinary unpractised viewer.”
Mr. Evan Davies, a senior lecturer at
the University of New South Wales
School of Psychology who has studied
behavioural stimuli in adults and
adolescents, was asked by Mr. Horler
what effect the paintings might have on
mature adults. Mr. Davies replied: “. . .
It is clear that they (the paintings) are
replete with stimuli of a sexual kind
and the effect this would have upon a
normal adult would be to create a con-
dition of perhaps disgust or certainly
inhibition in the person’s sexual
behaviour.”
Mr. Davies continued that the extent
of the sexual content and symbolism
in the paintings “would suggest to a
psychologist that the artist is in fact
indicating a certain amount of disgust
or perhaps social criticism with the un-
due stress upon sexuality which he may
perceive in our modern culture.” “Sat-
irical you think, eh? Is that your
opinion?” asked the Magistrate. “I
think that this would be close to it, Your
Worship,” Mr. Davies replied.
M R - Elwyn Lynn, BULLETIN art
critic and schoolteacher, told the
Court he saw parallels between Brown’s
paintings and those of Dada artists.
“Dada was often vulgar, rash, and
deliberately gaudy, and certainly aimed
to shock.” He said it was also a satirical
attack upon morality, especially of that
kind that had allowed the bloodbath of
World War I to take place.
When Mr. Lynn began to show
that artists have traditionally met op-
position in their time, the Magistrate
interposed: “Not even artists are per-
mitted to indulge in obscenity for art’s
sake. I am concerned with nothing
else. To show that artists through the
centuries have painted obscene pictures
from time to time is not to the point.”
Mr. Lynn told the Court the sexual
symbols did not distress or alarm him,
but caused a slight repulsion. “There
is a whole school of what is called
‘erotic’ art in Los Angeles, and in New
York I saw quite a few artists who dis-
played sexual organs in their paintings
in various ways. The point is, of course,
that this type of work is not a local
aberration, if I can put it that way.”
When Mr. Horler asked if there were
any subject impossible of achieving
artistic merit, Mr. Lynn said: “Now this
is a difficult question because it deals
with suppositions about paintings we
haven’t seen. If one could see the paint-
ing of an anus one might come to con-
clusions. I would say that it would be
most shocking. I’d say that if a man
persisted in doing paintings of this kind
one might wonder about him. But then
there is one kind of painting some
people think has intrinsic merit —the
innumerable crucifixions.”
The Magistrate then said: “I ask you
to desist from that type of gratuitous
evidence. I have put my foot down.
You will continue with your cross ex-
amination.” Mr. Horler: “You are not
even hearing me on the point.” The
Magistrate: “I ask you to comply, Mr.
Horler. If you keep begging the ques-
tion I will deal with you.” Mr. Horler:
“I am asking you to tell me why this
witness cannot give an answer.” The
Magistrate: “I ask you for the last time
to pursue your examination if you have
any. I direct you for the last time.”
Mr. Horler again asked whether any
subject was impossible of achieving
artistic merit. Mr. Lynn responded: “I
think all subjects can be treated in an
artistic manner.” Question: “From
which it would follow that there is
nothing excluded from the range of the
artist by its intrinsic nature?” Answer:
“No, nothing would be excluded.”
After imposing the three-month sen-
tence, the Magistrate set down March
13 as the date Mr. Brown will appear
again in the court on a related charge,
that of assisting the gallery to exhibit
the paintings. Not hearing Mr. Horler’s
attempts to address the Bench, the
Magistrate quickly adjourned the Court
and left the courtroom. Mr. Horler later
filed an appeal against the sentence and
Brown was released on bail.

AROUND MELBOURNE
In a State over Hanging
YOU must forgive us for being
so sensitive about hanging, be-
cause we do like to feel that
we are a non-hanging State, de facto,
that is. We did hang a man on
December 23, 1941, for a murder in
the Alexandra Gardens. Then our
next and last, hanging was on Feb-
ruary 19, 1951. Just in case you
have forgotten what happens with
capital punishment, this is a tale
worth recording.
We hanged three people, two men
and a woman, on that day. They
were Jean Lee, 31, Norman Andrews,
38, and Robert Clayton, 31. It was
a very unpleasant murder. The trio
attacked an old SP bookmaker in
Carlton. The police found him
bound up, covered in blood, savagely
battered, and dead. According to
the Crown, he had been tortured for
more than one hour before finally
he was strangled. Jean Lee, appar-
ently, had a good part in the tor-
turing. The Homicide Squad gave
evidence that she said: “I sort of
done my block and hit the old man
with a bottle and a piece of wood.”
There were wild scenes in the
Criminal Court when the jury con-
victed all three of murder. Jean
Lee collapsed into the arms of
Clayton and screamed, “I didn’t do
it. I didn’t do it.” Clayton went
to the jury, spat at them, and
shouted: “You team of idiots, may
your next feed choke you. You
swine, you.”
'J'HE anti-hanging groups went
strongly into action, but the feel-
ing seemed to be not so much over
the hanging of the men but revul-
sion at hanging a woman. After
all, we hadn’t hanged a woman in
Victoria since 1895. That was a
Mrs. Emma Williams, who drowned
her two-year-old son at Port Mel-
bourne. She drowned him because
she couldn’t get a job with a child
on her hands. According to the
newspapers, she died “calm and peni-
tent” on Melbourne Cup eve.
The “Herald” took several street
polls on the coming hanging of
Clayton, Andrews, and Lee. The
reporter found no anti-hangers. A
barmaid in an Exhibition Street
hotel said: “There is plenty of talk
about it in this bar, and every man
who drinks here thinks they should
hang all three of them.” A Miss
Pam Ralton, an operator in a
Collins Street beauty salon, was re-
ported as saying: “For eight hours
a day I hear everything that’s on
women’s minds. But I haven’t heard
one woman mention the hangings.
That can only mean it’s not worrying
them.”
The hanging was set down for
January 8. Next-of-kin were in-
formed. Clayton’s mother lived at
Paddington, in Sydney. Her hus-
band was bedridden with a stroke.
She collapsed when she heard the
news.
There was a special deputation of
women to the Premier, Mr. Mc-
Donald, and all police roundsmen
tipped that a reprieve for Jean Lee
was a certainty. There was no
reprieve. Mr. McDonald told the
women: “The day I had to order
the hanging of a woman was the
saddest in my life.” An appeal was
made to the Privy Council. The
execution date was put off to Feb-
ruary 5 and again to February 19.
And how did the prisoners take
it? Andrews in his cell prayed
night and day for a reprieve. Clay-
ton was reasonably calm but became
hysterical a few days before the
execution. He calmed down again
after a visit by his mother. Accord-
ing to a “Truth” reporter, Jean
Lee lived totally on the hope of a
reprieve, but when she found that
she wasn’t going to get it she went
berserk. She raved, screamed, threw
utensils around her. Wardresses be-
came scared to enter her cell.
Special warders were on the job
to make sure there were no suicide
attempts. Lights were kept burning
in the cells. For a hangman we had
to go to South Australia. He was
described as being 40, a short, stocky
man of about sft. 7in. He wore
khaki overalls and large steel-
rimmed goggles with a hat pulled
well down. When Victoria had its
own hangman he was paid an annuity
of £l5O and £75 for each execution.
The job would be better paid now.
Jean Lee wore a white shirt, khaki
trousers, and sandals. Her face was
covered by a white mask and she
“To remind me it’s Christmas."
was carried handcuffed to the scaf-
fold on a stretcher by the hangman
and his assistant. She appeared to be
unconscious, and when she was
placed on a chair above the trapdoor
and a rope placed around her neck
she had to be prevented from slump-
ing out of the chair.
Later there was an official state-
ment pointing out that Lee had
been given a mild sleeping draught
the night before. Her condition, no
doubt, was due to a last-minute
collapse.
Clayton and Andrews went to the
gallows quietly enough. They wore
plain prison garb and they had
white hoods over their heads. Their
hands were manacled behind their
backs, and for the execution their
legs were strapped. There were no
statements. Clayton called out,
“Goodbye, Charlie,” and Andrews re-
plied, “Goodbye, Robert.” It was
all over within a minute.
'J'WENTY or thirty people waited
silently outside the jail. There
were no demonstrations. They soon
dispersed. The same afternoon, as the
law directed, their bodies were buried
within the prison walls. Other
prisoners did the job.
The next time we were confronted
with this problem was in 1962, over
the case of Robert Peter Tait, a
sexual psychopath who murdered an
elderly widow in a Hawthorn
vicarage. This time the anti-hanging
forces were far more powerful. The
Labor Party fought harder, the trade
unions fought harder, the newspapers
unanimously were against it, and
perhaps the most powerful force were
the Bishops of the Church of Eng-
land. Tait had four appointments
with the hangman in three months
until finally Premier Sir Henry
buckled. It was decided that Tait
was insane and he was committed to
mental institutions for life.
It would appear that time is on
the side of the anti-hangers. Polls
show public sentiment is strongly
against it. ,
However, Sir Henry pointed out
that he has no doubt that the people
are on his side in the case of Ronald
Joseph Ryan, due to hang on
January 9 for the murder of prison
warder George Hodson last Decem-
ber. Sir Henry is accepting no depu-
tations, and he says definitely there
will be no reprieve. He made one
curious statement: “I notice the
people who are protesting, in the
main, are the same people who cam-
paigned on Vietnam.”
I wouldn’t have thought it possible
to place all the protestors into such
a neat little parcel.

and other cunningly evocative names —
there we saw one we must declare our
favorite. It was labelled, simply, HIC.
Stay Now, Fly Later
STAFF complaints about Qantas were
being aired in and out of the Courts
and in and out of union meetings last
week, but for 50 employees things
couldn’t have been better. These were
the group chosen to live as guests in the
new Wentworth Hotel in Sydney for
the dry run before doors were opened
for business. •
While some of the practising guests
spent their time earnestly changing
rooms and checking themselves in and
out, others slept, worn out by the mara-
thon effort of getting the 452 rooms
habitable, the eleven miles of carpet on
20 levels laid, and the doors open.
“Once we decided on a date we forced
ourselves to keep to it,” the general
manager, Stanley McNeill, said. “This
despite minor problems like burst pipes
and flooded carpets. It has been a matter
of progressive occupancy. I moved in
several months ago.”
McNeill has lived and breathed noth-
ing but Wentworth Hotel ever since.
He has actually been involved with it
since it was first suggested about five
years ago. As general manager of the
old Wentworth (his first hotel) he has
gone from dealing with a staff of 155
to coping with 700. All the old staffers
have come across to the new place, in-
cluding Jack Clancy, head waiter for
35 years. And so did some of the old
guests. When the original Wentworth
closed down (on the 13th of the month,
let the superstitious note) guests in the
old hotel were whisked across to the
new hotel in Phillip Street, a traumatic
experience.
There are many private dining-rooms
in the hotel with aggressively Australian
names like Barossa Valley and Hunter
River. There is a Matilda Room, which
will contain newspapers and market
reports from around the world. And,
in fact, the mirror-ceilinged grand ball-
room itself divides up very fairly into
separate rooms called Sydney, Perth,
Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, and
Hobart.
This determined Australian image
does not extend to the architecture: The
remarkably pedestrian structure was the
work of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill
of San Francisco, who are also design-
ing the new AMP offices in Melbourne.
The Wentworth is meant by “material
and design” to bring “warmth and sense
of security.” The sense of security
probably remained with the architects,
since the hotel cost upwards of
$11,000,000. Qantas, backed by the
Commonwealth, had none of the prob-
lems of Stanley Korman trying to get
the Chevron hotel above ground, and
it is hard to understand why they did
not give an Australian firm the con-
tract.
For some reason, perhaps to please
everyone, many styles of decorating
seem at war in the hotel. You could
probably call it Latter Day International
Hotel Style. There are reproduction
period pieces beside plain serviceable
low modern couches, an occasional
touch of Charles Eames, and moulded
plastic here and there. The main dining-
room has striped velvet on the walls in
green with a tone on tone spotted green
carpet. Additionally, there is an 18th-
century lead fountain complete with a
cherub who looks somewhat ill at ease.
But as the fountain was discovered by
Sir Hudson Fysh the cherub will have
to make the best of it.
But, for what it is meant to be —a
middle-priced international hotel the
new Wentworth fills all the require-
ments. “It will be outdated in fifty
years,” McNeill said. “It would be nice
to think we build for ever, but styles
change, the public changes. It’s the
biggest in the southern hemisphere now
—but this won’t last.”
The old Wentworth will now go un-
der the wrecker’s hammers, as the
licence has gone automatically to the
new premises. Meanwhile, a little fur-
ther down the street, another old hotel,
the Metropole, may also suffer. Until
last week that’s where the Qantas people
used to drink.
The Dark Side of Disney
CHARLES HIGH AM writes:
Walt Disney’s death in Hollywood ends
the career of the most successful single
entertainer in the history of the Ameri-
can cinema. His genius .emerged first
in the early ’thirties with a succession
of brilliant short cartoons, the most
notable of which was the “Three Little
Pigs,” distinguished for its inventive
use of color at a time when, unlike to-
day, technicolor was being used with
unusual artistry, complexity, and free-
dom. In the ’thirties, Disney made his
first full-length cartoon, “Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs,” which created
an immediate sensation and made him
internationally famous. Today much of
the animation of the human figures of
Snow White and the Prince look stiff
and awkward, but the film is full of
brilliant and undated things.
Since the war Disney’s empire has
spread to include the giant Disneyland
project, innumerable toys and other
manufactured goods, a long succession
of disappointing but lavishly mounted
cartoon features, and live action films
aimed straight at the American family.
When I met him last year in his
studios, he gave an impression of a
much darker personality than the car-
toons and family pictures suggested.
His office was done out in bright
colors, three very young and pretty
secretaries sat in the ante-room, and
the walls were hung with symbols of
Disney’s international renown, 29
Oscars, medals, shields, and plaques.
Disney himself wore a check sports
coat and casual shirt and seemed in
excellent health, but his personality
was fierce, hard, and uncompromising.
He spoke of his concern that the size
of the mass audience might finally
swing him away totally from artistic
cartoon-making. His “Winnie the Pooh”
full-length cartoon had been cut in
half, and one half released as a support
to a live-action feature, because he felt
that A. A. Milne’s delicate masterpiece
might be too subtle for the general
audience today. His full-length cartoon
of Kipling’s “The Jungle Book” had,
for the same reason, to be changed into
a teenage musical.
Disney died, it seems, just before the
demands of his huge audience killed him
as an artist. Perhaps we should be
grateful for that.
The Big Fellow at Ninety
“IF WHAT I have done can’t speak for
me, then it’s been no good.” The
stormiest petrel that ever fluttered in
the face of convention in Australian
politics, John Thomas Lang was 90
years of age on Decemer 21. Still vitally
interested in everything and active
behind the scenes in politics, he edits
his weekly newspaper “Century,” com-
ing in each day to Sydney from Wind-
sor to do so, and is still able and pre-
pared to tell us how to run the State,
the country, and certainly the Labor
Party.
“The Labor movement as I knew it
does not exist today,” he said. “A lot
of people have the wrong idea. They
think that everything depends on the
leader. In my time it was measures and
not men that mattered, and it should
still be true today.”
It is very hard to believe that this
man, once called The Prince of
Promisers, can possibly be a
nonagenarian. His eyes are clear and
twinkle with amusement in an unlined
face. The craggy jaw, the dramatic
gestures, the strong voice are all still

there. He is even still “The Big Fellow”
and towers over one, which in itself is
a feat at 90. His only concession to age
seems to be a slight deafness.
As a child he saw great suffering
around him after the 1880 bank smash,
and, looking back now with the clear
hindsight of old age, it seems to have
been the plight of women that affected
him most. “My mother was a very open-
hearted woman. The pot was always
ready for a cup of tea, and the house
was always filled with other women—•
mostly servant girls. In those days there
was nothing else for women to do. There
were no factories. They had to go and
work for another family. Be a cook or
a laundress or a slave of some kind. It
was very hard if they were ill or
widowed with children.”
It may have been the memory of
these girls which made him, as Premier
of New South Wales in 1925, ram
through the Widow’s Pension and the
Child Endowment legislation.
Other measures that went through in
these momentous years were the Mora-
torium Act, the 44-hour week, and
Worker’s Compensation. But it was a
bard time. “I had to face the Depres-
sion. Oh, we had a split in the party
in those days, too. But not a fight
between leaders. We fought about
issues.”
Beginning working life as an account-
ant, Lang was interested in politics
from boyhood and took the usual route
through local government. He entered
Parliament as MLA for Granville in
1913, but it was not until 1920 that
a portfolio came his way.
JN 1932, after two stormy years, when
half the depressed public adored
him and the other half burnt effigies,
and certainly no one could ignore him,
he attempted constitutional changes
and the N.S.W. Governor, Sir Philip
Game, removed him from office.
He was never again so powerful,
though his voice was heard loud and
long through the ’thirties and the
’forties. “I have no regrets about my
decisions. I did the right thing at the
time. History will prove I was right.”
History in the long run may point
this noisy, gesticulating people’s
politician out as having been very far
above the crowd that surrounded him.
He never travelled outside Australia,
stepped only briefly in 1943 into the
Federal House, and staunchly refused
to have parks and monuments named
after him.
With his desk covered in papers, the
phone ringing, and beyond his window
Sydney, which he knew in its ragged
days, growing into a high-rise city,
Lang seemed rather like an old lion
with plenty left to roar about. But he
doesn’t particularly like looking back.
“I suppose I had a pretty hard life,
but I was so busy living it I didn’t have
time to notice. You can’t live in the
past. If you do you stand still or you
regress. You must look forward. They
used to say I was forty years ahead of
everyone. Sometimes I still feel that
way.”

ON THE MARGIN
The Serpent was Subtil
I WAS looking at the badge on a
doctor’s car. It aroused my usual
envy of those who follow that elite
calling. I had Walter Mitty thoughts of
parking in a “No Standing” area and
saying to a policeman: “I have to stop
here, constable—Mrs. Hobbs has been
taken bad with the megrims.” Then my
attention was caught by the design of
the badge, a snake twined round a stick.
It seemed a curious emblem for a pro-
fession which aims to make people
healthy.
Persons who wish to inspire trust and
confidence usually avoid mentioning
snakes. You will look in vain in the
telephone book for Cobra Credits Ltd.
or the Taipan Insurance Co. Why, then,
should your friendly neighborhood doc-
tor expect to reassure patients by dis-
playing a snake on his car?
I made inquiries. The Australian
Medical Association was glad to explain;
clearly it had been got at over this
before. The badge, I learned, had its
origin in antiquity when snakes were
more highly thought of than they are
now. They were believed to possess
“wisdom,” especially in medical matters.
Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing,
carried with him a snake twined round
a stick. Tame, non-venomous snakes
were kept in this god’s temples, which
served as clinics for treating out-
patients. The priests, who were general
practitioners, summoned the snakes by
whistling.
The presence of the sacred snakes was
supposed to do patients good. The snakes
were also encouraged to lick wounds.
The priests took snakes with them when
visiting patients at night. Some patients
complained that whenever the priests
did not know 7 what was wrong with
them they prescribed the snake treat-
ment. This suggests that snakes had
much the same use in ancient medical
practice as antibiotic drugs do today.
The Australian Medical Association
has followed the BMA in taking the
snake and stick of Aesculapius as its
emblem. Whatever one feels about
snakes, the idea has tradition behind it.
But the public mind is confused by the
existence of another badge with a stick
and two snakes. This is the gadget
known as a caduceus, which used to be
carried by the god Mercury. In
America, the medical profession com-
monly uses the two-snake caduceus as
its emblem.
In view of Mercury’s dubious reputa-
tion in mythology, this practice is
strange. Mercury was, among other
things, the patron of thieves, and was
an accomplished thief himself. Another
of his activities was escorting the souls
of the dead to the underworld. While
on this job he carried his caduceus,
which was a kind of official pass. The
caduceus might, perhaps, be considered
a suitable badge for undertakers; as
used in America by doctors it seems
tactless.
There is, incidentally, a theory that
the two entwined snakes on the caduceus"
were originally meant to be mating.
Some primitive people think it is lucky
to come upon snakes thus engaged. This
thought that the snakes may be having
sexual relations does nothing, I think,
to raise the tone of the caduceus as a
doctor’s symbol.
one-snake doctors
make rather more sense tham
America’s two-snake ones. The public-
relations problem they have to face is
the abundance and unpopularity of
venomous snakes in this country. To
put their patients’ minds at ease, they
should at least explain that the snake
depicted on their cars is a non-veno-
mous species.
A young GP made a courageous,
practical attempt to gain acceptance for
the AMA symbol. Dr. T. Dingwattle, of
Sydney, experimented with snake-
therapy on Aesculapian lines. He first
obtained some carpet snakes and trained
them to come when he whistled. He
decided to test their efficiency one night
when called to attend a Mrs. McDimm,
who had come out in a rash.
After examining the patient, Dr.
Dingwattle gave a low, long-drawn
whistle. A carpet snake came out of his
bag and slid across the floor toward
Mrs. McDimm. Unfortunately, she had
been reading Sherlock Holmes’ stories
and was in a nervous mood. When she
saw the snake she screamed: “The
speckled band! The speckled band!”
Dr. Dingwattle had to abandon his-
experiment in a hurry.
As an ironic aftermath he received a
reprimand from the AMA. It was
pointed out that snake-therapy, though
good enough for Aesculapius, did not
conform to current medical ethics.
The public image of snakes is so bad
in Australia that the AMA might be
well advised to get a new badge alto-
gether. Here is a suggestion: an ancient-
statue of Aesculapius shows him accom-
panied not only by a snake but by a
dog, an emblem of watchfulness. What
more popular symbol could doctors put
on their cars than a doggie?

RIGHT,” we said, “up at 6.30 a.m.,
rendezvous CYC at 8.15, set sail
9, meet F. Chichester 10.30, back
to RSYC for celebrations, and that
leaves us nice time for 12 o’clock drinks
at the Gosses’ and the children’s Christ-
mas party at 2.30 p.m.”
The summons to report for duty on
Sunday at the Madigans’ yacht East
Wind had been received at a rather
late hour the night before, so it took a
certain amount of reorganisation to get
our clothes ready. In my opinion, and
I said so at the time, greeting one’s
fellow countryman in Harris tweed and
•chukka boots was hardly suitable in the
circumstances. Something more nautical
was needed. It was too late to take the
advice of “Vogue” and purchase PVC
tops and bottoms, caps with see-through
visors, and that sort of rig, but with
some diligence various moth-eaten
sweaters and after-shrunk shorts were
dug out and these, together with such
items as cricket socks, old badminton
shoes, and some smarter leisure wear
for the celebrations ashore, were
gathered together in our all-Australian
orange and yellow sailbag. I also packed
Kwells, because you never know.
We cast off in an atmosphere that
can only be described as exuberant.
None of us could recall, though we
tried, when we last rose so early on a
Sunday morning, but what did a few
bloodshot eyes matter when we were
taking part in the biggest nautical
adventure this century? Not only that.
Francis Chichester deserved the biggest
welcome he could get. It was his right.
Also, to write back to Aunt Ethel that
we hadn’t remembered our manners
would have been asking for trouble.
The next hour we pottered around
the harbor taking in the view. I had
never seen Sydney’s backside (as it
were), content till now to restrict all
movement from Centennial Park to
Woollahra Post Office. How glad I am
we came. It was superb. And to per-
sonalise things a bit, someone supplied
a commentary on who lived where. The
old familiar names crop up wherever
you go in this city. Past the Dekyveres’
residence, the Radfords’, where a lady
in pointed straw hat slowly descended
on their inclinator, the Point Piper set,
up there with binoculars at the ready,
the Woollie’s, the biscuits and the tea
sets, all represented at one bay or
another. The man who remarked you
don’t know Sydney until you’ve seen it
from this angle was right.
At ten o’clock the radio announced
that Mr. Chichester would be delayed
until noon. Well, bang goes the Gosses,
but one must be flexible on these
occasions. At eleven, it said 1.30. We
checked with Mr. Hugh Eaton, anchored
at Vaucluse in Bittern. “Right,” he
shouted, or something monosyllabic to
that effect. We parked at Watson’s Bay
and reviewed the situation. We were not
depressed, but a certain—how can I put
it?—doubt was creeping into our minds
about Mr. Chichester’s ETA. It was
not to be ignored, either, that the chil-
dren were becoming edgy at the possi-
bility of their party going down the
drain. Remembering Spock’s advice to
distract attention at the first sign of
juvenile frustration, we sent them below
to organise lunch. A further announce-
ment decided us. Chichester due in at
3 p.m. “Right, back to CYC, drop off
children, adults carry on alone.” Actu-
ally, adults fell asleep at the jetty and
acquired serious sunburn. Chichester
now due at 5 p.m.
The second trip round had lost its
earlier piquancy. I won’t say it was
flat, but conversation turned in the
sobering direction of Vietnam and the
cost of Property with Views. When
eventually the radio said Mr. Chichester
would not now arrive until late that
night, I am afraid Aunt Ethel would
have shuddered. In effect, we said that’s
one bit of nautical history that would
have to manage without us.
I T helps, when disappointed, to do
something out of character. The next
day, therefore, found me tending the
herbaceous border when the Madigans
arrived in a state of excitement. HE is
coming in at 1.30 p.m. for SURE, they
said. Pausing only to put out the
laundry, leave a message as to my
whereabouts, lock up the house, grab
Kwells and Revlon Moondrops against
further sunburn, I went.
There weren’t many boats about, and
even after ETA moved to 2.30 p.m.,
thence to 3 p.m., we toyed with the
pleasant notion that East Wind might
have the honor of escorting Mr.
Chichester on her own. We thought,
once, we saw his sail in the distance.
But even experts can be fooled. By 3.30
nothing had happened, the radio even
dried up. By 4, a tired voice said Mr.
Chichester was now expected at 5.30 at
the Heads, 7.30 at the RSYC. We, sir,
had been caught that way before. We
went home.
I am glad I went out to buy cough-
drops, otherwise I would have answered
the telephone, returned to the CYC, and
gone to sea again. I would also have
assisted the Madigans haul in a capsized
boat, tow it to Mosman Bay, and get to
RSYC in time to see Chichester dis-
appear into the building. I would then
have assisted them unfoul their mooring
tackle from a buoy, which occupation
kept them at sea till 8.30 p.m., where-
upon it started raining.
And it would have been damned little
consolation to me that inside his Belve-
dere Hotel suite with its sealess view
Mr. Chichester was enjoying his first
dinner ashore of mango cocktail,
Coquilles St. Jacques, followed 'by a
vegetarian platter (specially made).
Manners won’t come into it when he
leaves next month.

FINE OLD SCOTCH WHISKY
NEW YORK LETTER
Big Money from LSD
From GEORGE McGANN
THE scene is
the East Vil-
lage, heart-
land of the
switched -on set,
the cats and chicks
who really dig it,
the acid-heads, the
new-sound
music ians, the
drop-outs, and the
faggots. It’s rain-
ing lightly outside
the Village Theatre and Second Avenue
reflects the neon lights of Ratner’s, the
Jewish restaurant next door which knew
better days when the theatre was given
over exclusively to Yiddish drama and
comedy. The Dorn is right around the
corner and the five-spot cafe is already
beginning to come alive, the integrated
couples dancing, cool and loose, in front
of the jukebox. This is only a few short
blocks east of the “Old Village,” the
Greenwich Village of the squares and
tourists, but it is light years away in
mood, feel, and look.
The Village Theatre is now the shrine
of the League for Spiritual Discovery—
the LSD religion founded by Timothy
Leary, the unfrocked Harvard psycho-
logy professor. Tonight is the tenth
weekly gathering of the faithful in the
theatre—which seats two thousand at
three dollars per seat—to listen to the
hypnotic voice of Guru Leary and,
hopefully, to take a trip without LSD
but via psychedelic music pouring out of
loudspeakers along the sides of the walls
and via kaleidoscopic color films flash-
ing across a wide screen. Tonight’s
psychedelic celebration is entitled
“Illumination of The Buddha.”
Leary has been performing to a filled
theatre for weeks, clad in Zen-white
robe, long hair curling around his ears,
expounding the tenets of the new acid-
based creed and leading his followers
down through layers of consciousness to
the ultimate body cell. “Wonder of
wonders, man is Buddha” is what they
find when they get back to that cell.
“Like every great religion of the
past,” Leary says, “we seek to find the.
divinity within and to express this
revelation in a life of glorification and
worship of God.” The key to finding
God lies in the use of LSD, marihuana,
or peyote, but, unfortunately, for those
in the Village Theatre this stuff is all
illegal in the eyes of the cop and the
rest of the Establishment. So the trip
has to be taken without the help of
psychedelic drugs.
The psychedelic sounds, the flashing
lights and the droning voices of poet
Allen Ginsburg, apostle Ralph Metzner,
and Guru Leary himself are supposed
to turn the trick for the “pot-less” dis-
ciples. They are helped to “blow their
minds” without sugar cubes of LSD or
sticks of marihuana.
JjEARY has given the religion a six-
word symbol - “turn on, tune in,
drop out.” This means “to contact the
many levels of divine energy that lie
within your consciousness ... to express
and communicate your new revelations
... to detach yourself harmoniously,
tenderly, and gracefully from worldly
commitments until your entire life is
dedicated to worship and search.”
Chauffeured Cadillac limousines dis-
gorge mink-coated women and escorts
in dinner jackets in front of the theatre
for each of Leary’s psychedelic celebra-
tions. They contrast wildly with bearded
East Villagers in blue jeans and the
mini-skirted chicks. in bare feet with a
sparkling silver caste mark plastered on
their foreheads. Leary has caught on
with uptown sophisticates and it is very
chic to attend a celebration. But once
is enough. The performance was
scarcely under way the other night when
the uptowners started shifting uneasily
in their seats. In less than an hour
they were drifting up the aisles and out
of the theatre, quickly looking at but
passing by the makeshift sales counter
in the lobby. This contained a variety
of psychedelic material from “The
Head Shop” nearby. Incense, candles,
hookah pipes, and cigarette papers for
marihuana were on sale, also lapel but-
tons —“let’s legalise pot,” “psychedelise
suburbia,” “hands off Tim Leary”—and
gramophone recordings such as Ravi
Shankar’s mystic ragas.
Profits from the sales of these esoteric
items, as well as the net profits from
admission tickets, go to the Timothy
Leary Defence Fund, which is helping
to keep the Guru out of jail. Leary is
presently out on bail in two cases
involving possession of “pot” and LSD.
It was just as well that the mink
coats and dinner jackets departed. That
left an audience composed of celebrants
—aside from the heretical Press which
attends in considerable strength. Seated
to one side of the dimly lighted stage,
the figure in white began to talk. Leary
expressed a contempt for the spoken
and written word—“this is the electronic
age and we are all in tune with
McLuhan’s sensory experience theories”
—but, nevertheless, carried on for
nearly two hours without notes. Occa-
sionally he was spelled by Ginsburg and
his poetic chants, a musical interlude
from offstage guitars and zithers, and
synchronised cinema panoramas of
changing focus and clashing colors.
The burden of Guru Leary’s talk,
which he has delivered to college groups
throughout the country, as well as in the
East Village, was recently described as
“an instant mix of elementary
chemistry, anthropology, literature, and
comparative religion.” He has a sooth-
ing, yet persuasive, voice. It was at its
most mellifluous as he spoke of “the
millions of unused brain cells that can
be awakened and plugged into the
divine transformer.”
Although Leary is in the spotlight
most of the evening, a considerable
company of technicians assists him in
getting the electronic message through
to the eager nerve endings of the faith-
ful. Prominent among these are two
experts in the new technique of sound-
and-light projections, Miss Jackie Cas-
sens and Rudi Stern. This pair have
designed the lighting and sound effects
for many local discotheques, notably
“The Cheetah,” the noisiest, busiest
nightspot in the city. They have
also been preparing the way for Leary
to carry his electronic message to the
residents of San Francisco, Los Angeles,
and other cities. While Leary is taking
the show on the road, his stand-in will
be Ralph Metzner, who has taken more
than 250 LSD trips.
If he does not go to jail first, Leary
plans to take his psychedelic troupe to
Europe, the Pacific area, even to Viet-
nam. He is above the battle, he says,
and willing to let the Viet Cong switch
on along with everyone else.

Cellarmaster’s Christmas Reflections
I should
have a son more
often. Toby, born on
the fourth of July
(no doubt he’ll
think the celebra-
tions are for him!)
was head - wetted
with some of the
best wines I’ve seen.
I had to make a
quick trip to the
Hunter the follow-
ing day. Doug Elliot offered a 1945 red,
a 1938 white (still in wonderful con-
dition), and a 1928 Madeira from the
area, a rare Hunter dessert wine. They
were all marvellous and Toby was
toasted in glowing terms. That night
Keith Tulloch followed on with the
good work. He presented Tulloch Dry
Reds of the 1958, ’57, ’55, ’54, ’52,
’47, and ’3l vintages. The ’54 was the
famous wine that won both a burgundy
and claret prize in the same show. Of
them all I liked best the ’47, though the
’3l was a privilege to drink.
JN simple terms, you’re not doing
enough! After all, a measly 1.22
gallons a year. And in a country that
produces truly consistent wines of high
quality at most reasonable prices (avail-
able at all leading stores!) Of this, just
over .4 of a gallon is table wine. There
are six bottles to a gallon. So you are
drinking, on an average, two bottles of
table wine a year each! Two measly
bottles.
Yet being conservative, aware of the
means of means, assessing off-days, dry-
days, sick-days, furiously busy days, I
still reckon I average a half bottle a
day. That’s 182 bottles a year, fifteen-
odd dozen, or thirty-one gallons! You
other blokes have a hell of a lot of
catching up to do!
STOP PRESS: Figures released this
week show a per capita increase to 1.34
gallons a head. You’re learning.
pw, in spite of my previous pro-
testations, I am worried. I have
a vague suspicion that I am helping
to drink the country dry. In various
articles I have mentioned the increas-
ing consumption of good red wine.
There is also an increasing production
of good red wine, but I am afraid that
it may not keep up with the demand.
Much of this is pure hypothesis, but
even if there were unlimited money
available today for a colossal expansion
program, it would still take many years
before we were drinking the wines that
resulted. I know that the major com-
panies are pouring hundreds of thous-
ands of dollars into expansion every
year. They are aware of the approach-
ing situation. There is undoubtedly
more quality red wine being made than
ever before, but I repeat that I am
still worried.
The moral, of course, is quite simple.
My house is mortgaged, my car bloody
and battered from the scuffles in traffic,
my children walk barefoot, and my wife
has needed a new hairdo for the past
six weeks. But I am sitting on 2000
bottles of good red wine.
Dr. Johnson spoke of three-
bottle men. He didn’t mean a day.
He meant at one meal! Yet this is
simply explained. In those days bottles
were smaller and weren’t much bigger
than today’s half bottle. So his friends
only averaged about two bottles at
every meal! And he said claret was a
drink for boys.
anyone? Bottle sizes
vary, of course. I am often asked
to repeat the champagne varieties.
Bottle one, 26 2-3rd oz., 1 2-sth pts.,
Magnum two bottles, Jeroboam four,
Rehoboam six, Methuselah eight, Sal-
manesar 12, Balthazar 16, Nebuchad-
nezzar 20.
I have an 1898 Nebuchadnezzar in
my cellar. Empty! 12 bottles equal a
case equals two gallons. In Bordeaux 24
cases,'2BB bottles, is called a barrique.
Four barriques equal one tonneau.
Chateau production is rated by the ton-
neau. In Burgundy 24 cases, 288 bottles,
is called a piece, though for some
reason this can go to 300 bottles or
more. Two pieces equal one queue. In
Portugal a pipe equals 672 bottles.
In Australia we rate winery produc-
tion by the tons of grapes crushed,
wholesale sales by the gallon, and retail
sales by the bottle and case. Not nearly
so romantic.
JTOODMASTER Tony Bohdan, of the
Friday Club, served an incredible
dish during the year Veal Sausages,
Sour Cream, Dates, Almonds, Ravioli,
and sundry other delicacies were
enclosed in two enormous layers of
Brioche—each portion measuring about
12in. by Bin.
It transpired that Bohdan had read
Michelangelo’s biography and dis-
covered this was his main sustenance
when in the throes of creation. The
whole huge dish tasted delightful, but
in this case it was the Ecstasy first and
the Agony after.
JJ’NDERSTAND all the fuss over the
use of wine names? I can well
comprehend the countries of origin
wish to exclude others using such names
as Champagne, Chablis, Sauternes,
Graves, Barsac, and Asti. After all, these
are the names of specific regions. But
the other names, those which have
become accepted all over the world—
many of them are English corruptions.
There is a move to prevent all but
the Jerez wines of Spain being called
Sherry. But from the eighth to the
thirteenth centuries the Moors ruled.
Jerez is a corruption of the Moorish
name for the town Sherish. So if the
Spanish prevent the rest of the world
using the name, what is to stop the
Moroccans moving in on Spain?
All this is pure hyperbolothesis. The
stuff in the bottle is the stuff that counts.
often, I confessed when a delight-
ful female acquaintance recently
looked deep into my eyes, fluttered her
inch-long lashes, heaved a sigh (it fell
to earth I know not where) and said,
“Do you ever have wine with break-
fast?”
But lately we have been starting a
rather charming habit which I thor-
oughly recommend, and this is the
Champagne Breakfast. For the past
couple of Christmas mornings we have

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
ART, 1966
One Foot in the Past
By ELWYN LYNN
ART is a sociologist’s nightmare
or ought to be, for its dark, un-
charted wastes don’t daunt our
local impressionistic social commenta-
tors who act as though they are Arnold
Hauser, Geoffrey Gorer, and Levi-
Strauss combined; and a glance at 1966
might induce one to come up with
theories of the triumph of uniform
areas and radi.mt color, of the renais-
sance (or at least recognition) of sculp-
ture and of the resurgence of disparate
images in painting. The year might
have been part of a grand design, but
no pattern can be detected in it.
When a dominant group like the
Olsen-Hessing-Rapotec-Rose cabal, now
dispersed, can impose a point of view,
art can appear to have a pattern and
in 1966 the notions of minimal, basic
structure, emanating in ideology and
example from the Central Street Gal-
lery, gave the year some shape with a
series of hard-edged, sharp-contoured,
brightly and lucidly colored abstracts
from Hirst and Benjamin, of England,
Matisse, and the locals like Watkins,
McGillick, Harpur, and Szabo. But such
singleness of purpose looks eccentric
when all other galleries like to keep one
foot deep in the recent past.
Honors were divided between abstrac-
tion and figuration; the abrasive opposi-
tion between the camps seems dimin-
ished, though the Central Gallery’s
director publicly championed the view
that references to the real world in
painting were irrelevant and Albert
Tucker on TV deplored facile cosmo-
politanism and wanted our art to grow
out of our own society, landscape, and
history. The ideological front looked
reasonably bland, though Douglas
Pratt, a member of the Commonwealth
Art Advisory Board and celebrant of
gum-dotted panoramas, praised New
Zealand painting as a breath of fresh
air while he was in that country, and
hinted at the foul and filthy air of
Australia.
As though to confirm his righteous
view there appeared later Larter’s
nudes of unenticing flesh and bald
pudendas, Upton’s surreal-sexual shapes,
and Shead’s comments on the sexual
life of the private school. Gallery A’s
superb survey of the Australian nude in
Sydney and Melbourne excited com-
ment and peepers; whatever the pre-
servers of public morality may say, the
confrontation of the nude as a subject
and the new, cool abstraction was artisti-
cally healthy.
Most disturbing of the realists was
Brett Whiteley, whose dilapidated mat-
tresses sagged under Christie and his
distorted victims; a volatile, graceful
calligraphy accompanied the obsession
of a nauseating necrophiliac and empha-
sised a pictorial irrationality found, too,
in the cataclysmic distortions of Paul
Partos’ Picassoid figures. A similar
fetishistic irrationality was the basis of
Gareth Sansom’s excellent show which
mixed amorphous, squashy, intestinal
forms with crisp collages of World War
I pilots and planes; like Whiteley he
dropped clues all over the canvas.
Albert Tucker, surely our most
formidable proponent of the power of
the image, had his expressionist dynamo
at full pitch at the Adelaide Festival
and sent jet-parrots through gloomy
woods or across lurid sunsets; explorer-
cardplayers stalked the land like anti-
Hellenistic heroes; the Daws retrospec-
tive was not so memorable, but the
Mertz collection, also at the Festival,
remains the most comprehensive of col-
lections of recent art.
It was Molvig’s expressionist period
that most impressed in his restrospective
at Komon’s, and that expressionism
remains a powerful force in Australian
painting was emphasised by the lack of
it in two Melbourne retrospectives to
William Frater and Adrian Lawlor. It
certainly proliferated bulgy forms in
Sibley and tore like a whirlwind through
Jamieson.
A calmer air pervaded the charcoal,
gossamer-grey, solemnly serene land-
scapes of Lloyd Rees, and a more cheer-
ful one the primitives of Sam Byrne, at
83, delightfully unaware of the irrele-
vant literariness of his themes. Perce-
val’s landscapes were ecstatic and ebul-
lient, and though Blackman celebrated
domestic bliss, the shadow of disquiet
sometimes fell over faces and rooms;
some works had a haunting, contented
sadness.
Fred Williams’ show was an
apotheosis of gum tree with its graceless
The Search for an Artist
SOME time ago Donald J. Finley
walked into THE BULLETIN
office and set down his brief-
case. “I have discovered John Rus-
sell,” he announced. And it is almost
literally true that he has. For several
years Mr. Finley scoured France
and Britain, tracking down the his-
tory and paintings of the little-known
Australian artist who is reputed to
have taught Matisse the elements of
Impressionism and who gave boxing
classes to the artistic circle in Paris.
Some of these paintings are repro-
duced in the following pages.
The artist—John Russell—lived
and worked in France from 1885 to
1920. He was a friend of Van Gogh
and Rodin, and Monet often worked
with him on Belle lie, off Brittany.
Monet is said to have preferred some
of Russell’s Belle He seascapes to
his own.
“Books of Australian art give only
a mention of Russell because nobody
knew anything about him,” said Mr.
Finley. Mr. Finley, an Australian
Londoner for 30 years, is films and
exhibition officer for the News and
Information Bureau of Australia
House.
Previously, the main source of
information for biographers had been
Russell’s daughter, Jeanne once
known as a singer in Paris—but her
tendency in old age to romanticise
and invent details somewhat distorted
the picture. Mr. Finley culled con-
siderable information from a few
meetings in Sussex with one of Rus-
sell’s three remaining sons, Alain, in
the months before he died of cancer.
A letter Mr. Finley had published
in “Connaissance des Arts” brought
a reply from M. Louis Jouve in
Brest —Jeanne’s brother-in-law. In an
apartment in Brest, Mr. Finley saw
some of the 50 paintings left by
Jeanne’s husband.
The Art Gallery of N.S.W. has
three Russell watercolors and one
oil. It has also acquired another oil
and a drawing, both of which are in
transit to the Gallery. The Gallery
may also in the fullness of time
acquire another 24 Russell pictures.
These were left by Russell’s daugh-
ter, Jeanne, to the Louvre with the
stipulation that they be exhibited in
one room of the Louvre as a
memorial to her father’s friendship
with Rodin. If this were not done,
the collection was to come to the Art
Gallery of N.S.W. The Trustees of
the N.S.W. Gallery have made an
official approach to the Louvre sug-
gesting that they are claimants under
Jeanne’s will and now await develop-
ments.
Russell’s first wife, whom he mar-
ried in Paris, was an Italian beauty,
Mariana Antoinetta Matiocco. Her
beauty is immortalised in Rodin’s
“Minerve sans Casque” and Fremiet’s
“Joan of Arc.” Russell and Mariana
settled in a house he built on Belle
lie, the Chateau de l’Anglais—today
a rather smart, four-storeyed hotel
with an avenue of cedars. Russell
returned to Sydney with his second
wife, an American singer, and died
at Watson’s Bay in 1931 while build-
ing a stone port for his yacht. He
was 73.

foliage; he made a virtue of drabness
and repetition, and imbued the harsh
land with a tenderness one finds in
pietas or crucifixions. His “Chopped
Trees” and Blackman’s “Two Women”
are 1966 masterpieces.
It may be an age of satire and pro-
test: Vietnam titles appeared for some
gay Sydney paintings; Melbourne had a
protest show where Pacifists and Com-
munists mingled indistinguishably.
Garry Shead (rhymes with bed) and
Craig McGregor in his para-journalistic
introduction to the catalogue saw the
North Shore as a sexy but unenjoyable
riot. Geoffrey Proud, who could be a
good painter, was whimsical rather than
satirical with Red Riding Hood. He
lacks a subject.
JAMES changed subjects from
gem-encrusted, vetvety landscapes to
city scenes of pallid figures on beaches
or on streets; he continues to use
abstraction and figuration with elegant
virtuosity; master, not slave, of the
styles.
Certainly the combination of abstrac-
tion and figuration used by the
Melanesians, in a most important show
at the N.S.W. Gallery, was generally
inelegant: a black crocodile, zanily
white-dotted in the middle and with a
head at each end, still stalks the
imagination.
Abstraction revelled in lively variety:
there was the optical hypnotism of
Ostoja, the thin, bent line of Raft l , the
clear-cut, meticulously poised flat forms
of Robert Jacks, the blazing, stripped
discs from Syd Ball, the vivid, even
gaudy, arabesques from Reddington,
and the cool, cool clarity of Coburn,
lan Burn, and Jeff Bern. Reinhard.
whose frigid nudes seem to be dis-
appearing, and Jordan are calmer and
more analytic. Rhapsodic abstraction of
a piercing lyricism came with Aspden.
Syd Ball’s largest work at Watters and
Coburn’s large black-and-white bird-
foliage forms at the Hungry Horse were
among the masterly works of 1966.
Abstract expressionism’s turbulence
and waywardness were undiminished in
shows by Rapotec, Gleghorn, and Lam-
bert, and its calligraphic mode stimu-
lated Rodney Milgate, who took the
Blake. Analytic and flat-color-patch
abstraction won belated recognition in
a survey of work by Hinder, Fizelle,
Balson, and Crowley; it might help
people see more virtue in the work of
Nancy Borlase and in the water-
colors of Weaver Hawkins, who both
showed that maturity does not mean
adaptability to the latest.
The lacerated or boiling surface was
well represented; Peter Clarke was
most dour, reserved and of the earth,
earthy; Gordon Rintoul let a river of
debris of hessian, rope, twigs, and pig-
ment cascade through brown scapes;
John Neeson caught the sombre sug-
gestiveness of texture and Jan Riske,
in marvellously boiling and crumbled
surfaces, brought color back to texture;
Marmol encrusted and gouged his sur-
face in Spanish style and Reascod
flattened his to a shallower, paler
texture.
Surrealism, which has affinities with
texture and action painting, quietly
appeared in a show by Eric Thake (his
first in 20 years) and in Jeffrey Smart’s
finest works to date; both were shown
in Melbourne, which now appears to
be the home of the print, the new
galleries, Crossley and 99 showing fine
examples, South Yarra Gallery plan-
ning its own print studio and the Print
Council offering privileges and en-
couragement. Strines, also new, has
opened with a lively and varied policy,
but in Sydney the Dominion, and
Clune’s, as we knew it, have closed.
Sculpture has at last received real
encouragement, and has never been
more variously presented: inside and
in the gardens at Canberra’s new Sculp-
ture Centre; at the N.S.W. Gallery
with the truly representative Alcorso-
Sekers show (won by Baldessin’s fine
fun piece); and in Hyde Park with the
Transfield exhibition (won by Norma
Redpath’s impressive, solemn bronze
sentinel). There emerged some notable
colored sculptive, presaged by Mike
Kitching’s at Stern’s earlier in 1966.
F. there was a pattern anywhere in
1966, its end was a debacle in the
auction conducted to clean out Clune’s
back rooms; advertisements of Novem-
ber 5 and 12 warned owners to collect
their works or they would be auctioned
on December 1. To a protest from the
Contemporary Art Society, McDonald,
who now owns Clune’s, replied that the
gallery owned the majority of works to
be auctioned and that every endeavor
was made to contact owners. This was
not so. At the auction on December 7
reserve prices were not respected; a
“Williams” was declared not to be a
Williams from the rostrum; Charles
Blackman informed the auctioneers that
his “Lithograph” was a commercial
reproduction; works by Boynes (who
will show at Bonython’s Hungry Horse
early next year), Hessing, and a Hodg-
kinson, listed in the catalogue, did not
appear.
As could be expected, most prices
were disastrous; compared with the
Schureck sale of 1962, it was like a lost
property auction; the 1962 sale came
when a show of Australian art was being
selected for the Tate and the Power
Bequest had just been announced;
Schureck was a respected collector and
the release of his works raised the status
of art and artist.
Mr. McDonald, who imports art and
yet makes mistakes with locals like
Williams and Blackman, did the oppo-
site. Dickerson charcoals brought from
17 to 27 guineas; two drawings by Full-
brook (twice winner of the Wynne)
brought three guineas each; a Sharp
drawing, two guineas; a 42 x 40in. oil
by Upward went for 12 guineas; a 35
x 17in. Rapotec for 45; a Raft for 12;
a Hughes for 15; and a Hodgkinson
watercolor for 13. Only Nolan, Gleeson,
Cassab, and Passmore brought reason-
able prices, and though this disturbing
auction does not signal a general fall in
prices and interest, it does signal what
I thought unnecessary two issues ago:
an art dealers’ association with a code
of ethics; meanwhile, to caveat emptor
one may add caveat pictor.
The critic is not the artist’s only
bane.
FILMS
Padding
The Pad. Director, Brian G. Hutton.
Marco Polo the Magnificent. Directors,
Denys de la Patelliere and Noel
Howard.
PADDING is only too obvious in
“The Pad,” a film version of
half of Peter Shaffer’s playbill.
The plotline, after all, is simple
enough: a shy, solitary young man
finally summons up enough confidence
to ask a girl to dinner at his flat, then
begs for help and advice from his
sexually successful friend. Throughout
the disastrous evening he has to watch
his friend’s effortless, almost offhand,
conquest, and is finally left alone as
before.
The play and filmscript are more
like a short story than a novel,
illuminating a situation rather than
revealing any development of charac-
ter. In the original, the whole thing
took place in the young man’s flat,,
with the background his chance
meeting with the girl, his lifelong
timidity deftly sketched in by the-
dialogue. In the film, we are treated
to long and fairly uninteresting scenes
explaining all this, plus sequences
demonstrating his friend’s irresistible
technique with women. But, if;the v script
couldn’t make this clear to youj there’d
have to be something wrong with either
you or the script.
I T ' S dead easy to tell where the
adapters leave off and Peter Shaffer
takes over, for the quality of the writ-
ing and the dramatic content sud-
denly take such a turn for the better;
and in these later scenes the film is
believable and touching. Brian Bedford
is remarkably engaging as the gauche
dreamer; James Farentino, handsome
in the rather absurdly virile fashion of
a men’s cologne ad, deals expertly with
a role that is both easier and less re-
warding. Julie Sommars is always
capable and occasionally rather more:
than that.
Every so often a mysterious film bobs'
up made in Europe by a job-lot of
producers yet boasting quite a distin-
guished cast. I’ve always suspected that
these actors happened to find them-
selves holidaying in Italy, Tangier, or
wherever and decided over a drink in
the local cafe to fling together a movie
in order to defray vacation expenses.
Such is “Marco Polo the Magnificent,”
which employs the talents of Horst
Buchholz, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif,
and Orson Welles, among others. Well,
anyhow, they’re in it.

The Fancy Dress War
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Soldier’s Art. Anthony Powell.
Heinemann. $2.65.
Anthony powell’s long
sequence of novels “The Music
of Time” has now completed its
eighth volume. It rotates like some
great revolving stage, its characters
fluttering in and out of the sets like
butterflies, scattering green and cerise
dust from their wings, making love
briefly under the arc-lamps and some-
times getting mangled in the stage
machinery.
His tone is genial and sympathetic,
and his humor low-key and discreet
but always present. Much of Powell’s
material is trivial and tedious, but his
tedium is the tedium of existence. In
order to keep his elaborate corps de
ballet on the move and executing their
complicated movements, it is necessary
for him to keep up with a bewildering
number of characters and quickly flash
their names across the page. Often
you have to scratch your head and
think “Who was that?” before you can
work out what he is talking about.
The central motivating idea behind
Powell’s work is the notion of absurdity.
It is not the savage absurdity of the
modern theatre of the absurd. It is a
gentler absurdity. He demonstrates the
futility of all our little plottings and
schemings, the transience of our love
affairs, and the silliness of our social
conventions. And underneath all these
minor absurdities there lurks that
greater absurdity, Death, that stage
trapdoor which opens at unexpected
moments and pockets the dancers one
by one. In an earlier novel in the series
“Casanova’s Chinese Restaurant” the
big moment in the book is Maclintick’s
death. The high point in “The Soldier’s
Art” is the death of Priscilla Tolland
and Chips Lovell in the blitz only a
few hours after talking to them. Their
conflicts are cut short and left brutally
unresolved.
One of the more revealing sentences
in the book is where he writes, “All
the same, one never learns to expect
the obvious.” This is apropos of Odo
Stevens, an aggressively cheerful air
ace, who is having an affair with Pris-
cilla Tolland, and has just recited a
melancholy poem about army life
which sounds a bit like Eliot’s “The
Hippopotamus” or “Sweeney Upright.”
The recital of this poem reveals an
unexpected side to Odo Stevens, con-
cealed by his brash front.
Another example in the book of the
thesis that one learns never to expect
the obvious is the reappearance of
Stringham as a waiter in the mess.
Stringham has become a teetotaller
and has thrown off the tutelage of Miss
Weedon, who kept him in order during
his alcoholic days. Stringham quite
cheerfully accepts his job as waiter and
shrugs off his loss of social prestige.
Anthony Powell is a historian of
characters and events rather than a
writer who develops a dramatic situa-
tion and builds up tension and conflict.
He is what A. D. Hope once described
in a poem as “that sly anus of mind
the historian” rather than “the Eater
of Time.” As a historian rather than
a developer of conflict, it is necessary
for him to show the unobvious side of
his characters, otherwise his massive
novel-sequence would be totally flat.
theme which Powell en-
lists to his central notion of absurdity
is, of course, sex. So in “The Soldier’s
Art” we find that Moreland, the com-
poser, has allied himself with the sharp-
tongued widow of Maclintick, who had
been his abject admirer. Powell takes
great delight in playing his characters
off against each other and exploring all
their possible permutations and combin-
ations. Affairs are described from the
outside rather than from the inside.
We suddenly find they exist as estab-
lished facts, and the passion and feel-
ings which brought them into exist-
ence are only hinted at. Then just as
suddenly these affairs cease to exist, and
the characters have paired off with other
partners.
The basic narrative structure of the
series is the reason why the reader feels
he is watching from the outside rather
than from the inside. Nicholas Jenkins,
the narrator, is himself a novelist, and
he is chiefly interested in describing the
lives of his friends rather than his own
personal history. For this reason the
set-pieces are generally set-pieces in
public places such as a hotel or at a
party. In such places it is also easier
for the author to muster up his crowded
cast and parade them before the reader.
Love and death are seen as public acts
with social consequences.
In fact, the whole atmosphere of the
series has a peculiarly theatrical flavor.
In “The Soldier’s Art” there is a
symptomatic sentence. One of the char-
acters comments about Browning’s
poetry, from which the title of the
Anthony Powell
book came, that Browning “gives the
impression of writing about people who
are wearing expensive fancy dress.”
This is a phrase which aptly catches
the mood of much of Powell’s writing.
“The Soldier’s Art” begins with a
passage in which the narrator buys a
military overcoat from a firm which
hires and sells theatrical costumes as
well as supplying military wear for offi-
cers. The Levantine outfitter who serves
the narrator mistakes him for an actor
and asks him what show he is getting
the greatcoat for. In a glass display case
two headless trunks stand at attention,
one of them dressed as Harlequin and
the other in the scarlet full-dress uni-
form of some infantry regiment. The
narrator sees these two figures as
allegories, as “. . . Civil and Military
. . . Work and Play . . . Detachment
and Involvement . . . Tragedy and
Comedy . . . War and Peace . . . Life
and Death . . .”
Shortly after this follows a beautifully
handled description of an air-raid over
London in which “thin, greenish rays
of searchlight . . . create a small ellipti-
cal compartment through which, once
in a way, rapidly darted a tiny object,
moving like an angry insect confined in
a bottle . . . All the world was dipped
in a livid, unearthly refulgence, theatri-
cal yet sinister, a light neither of night
nor day.” A couple of lines later Bithel,
who is in charge of a mobile laundry
unit, announces, “There’s been a spot of
bother about a cheque.”
“The Soldier’s Art” has, in fact, very
little to do with war, and is much more
taken up by intrigue among Army
officers.
War is the theatre in which these
officers work out their little plots and
schemes to further their own careers.
The novel is dominated by that pecu-
liarly unlikable figure, Widmerpool,
whose only love is himself. Widmerpool
is deliciously sent up. War is merely a
backdrop against which the characters
act out their lives with all the absurdity
of peacetime.

Nabokov’s Mirror
By R. G. HOWARD
Despair. Vladimir Nabokov. Weidenfeld
and Nicolson. $3.15.
The Eye. Vladimir Nabokov. Weiden-
feld and Nicolson. $2.30.
TWO more books from Nabokov’s
past. There remain now only three
of his Russian novels that have
not been translated into English. “The
Eye,” too short to be called a novel,
was written in 1930. Beginning as a
conventional first-person narrative, it
undergoes a curious change when the
hero shoots himself after being thrashed
by a jealous husband. The hero-narrator
(at this stage nameless) believes himself
to be dead, and describes his stay in
hospital, his discharge, and subsequent
life as mere images in his brain, which
is still active after death. “What a
mighty thing was human thought,” he
muses, “that it could hurtle on beyond
death!”
In his new life he becomes acquainted
with a group of Russian expatriates,
among whom the recently introduced
Smurov particularly interests him. Fas-
cinated by the many faces Smurov pre-
sents to the world—to one woman he
is “a brutal and brilliant officer of the
White Army,” to his employer in a
Berlin bookshop he is a spy from the
new regime in Russia, to another man
he is a contemptible Munchausen, and
so on—the narrator undertakes to track
down the real Smurov. The self of most
concern to Smurov himself is the one
he presents to Varvara, the young
sister-in-law of his host; he imagines
this self to be rather flattering until the
moment she indignantly rejects his
advances. The shock causes a disintegra-
tion of all the different versions of
Smurov, including that of coldly de-
tached narrator, leaving only a pathetic,
insolvent young man with an unstable
mind. The best way to find your real
man is to observe him in a crisis.
The narrator’s quest for the real
identity of Smurov then is merely a
bizarre form of self-interest. Smurov’s
(or the narrator’s) extreme self-
consciousness leads, after his catalytic
attempt at suicide, to a strange split
in his personality, a division into the
one who acts and the one who watches.
“Despair” offers another variation on
this unusual theme.
Its hero, Hermann’s self-consciousness,
begins to get out of hand during the
act of love. “My face was buried in the
folds of her neck, her legs had started
to clamp me . . . but, at the same time,
incomprehensibly and delightfully, I
was standing naked in the middle of
the room ...” This split, he discovers,
enhances his pleasure, and the farther
apart the split the greater the pleasure.
In the effort to obtain better and better
orgasms he imagines himself farther
and farther from the bed. Finally, he
longs “to watch a small but distinct and
very active couple through opera glasses,
field glasses, a tremendous telescope, or
optical instruments of yet unknown
power . . .” But, with a shock, he dis-
covers, and so do we, that, unnoticed,
the real and the imagined selves have
changed places. Hermann is sitting in
the parlor and the active couple he
thought he was watching through the
open door vanish when his wife com-
plains he will not come to bed. As in
“The Eye,” self-consciousness has
become delusion.
This early incident is a preparation
for the main development of Hermann’s
duality. Coming upon a tramp named
Felix on a desolate hill in Prague, Her-
mann sees in him his perfect double.
He at once conceives a diabolical
scheme to collect his own insurance by

murdering the tramp. He persuades
Felix to dress up in his clothes, makes
one or two little adjustments to com-
plete the resemblance, and then shoots
him in the back. According to his plan,
his wife, whom he has tricked into un-
witting collaboration, is to collect the
insurance and join him abroad. The
plan misfires, of course, because of Her-
mann’s second delusion, and the novel
ends with a Nabokovian twist.
“Despair’s” surprise ending is not so
easily guessed as that of “The Eye,”
but in retrospect it is just as inevitable
in view of Hermann’s duality. The
peculiar psychological split shared by
Hermann and Smurov is not confined
to these two novels, nor is it given only
to madmen. Incessant self-consciousness,
the habit of constantly viewing the self
from a distance, is a sine qua non for
the artist. This quality, one might
almost call it a defect, obsesses Nabo-
kov. He explores it in novel after novel,
culminating perhaps in “Lolita” (to
date), the study of a man obliged to
watch in its minutest detail his own
emotional decay. The Nabokov hero is
like a patient watching his own opera-
tion—the pain which would prevent
most men from seeing such gruesome
detail is in his case deadened by local
anaesthesia.

Bohemian lover are familiar figures in
the Nabokov world, though less vicious
than others of their kind (the sinister
couple of “Laughter in the Dai'k”). The
expatriates of “The Eye” anticipate
those of “The Gift.” On the other
hand, quite new are the vengeful hus-
band in “The Eye” and the conciliatory
doctor in “Despair.” If Smurov is a
shadowy figure, Hermann, on the con-
trary, is one of Nabokov’s most success-
ful and original creations with his corro-
sive wit and his ruthless eye for the
ridiculous.
“Despair” is not the novel I should
choose as introduction to Nabokov.
(“Pnin” best suits that purpose.) Many
people will find its eccenti'icities intoler-
able, but to those already devoted to
this great artist it will be, together with
“The Eye,” a treasured addition to an
oeuvre, remarkable, if not unique, for
the indispensability of every single item.
The Caesar of Versailles
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Sun King. Nancy Mitford.
Hamish Hamilton. $7.35.
LOUIS XIV has a perennial fascina-
tion for biographei's: undei'stand-
ably enough, for the reign of this
magnificent royal stallion was the
climax of the European ideal of absolute
monarchy. The 17th century was
France’s grand epoque. Fi'ench taste
and French armies dominated Western
civilisation. At Versailles the Roi Soleil
built the most splendid palace the world
has ever seen. From it he ruled as a
despot more potent than any Caesar
or Mogul.
Outside the enormous, ever-rami-
fying building, the courtyards and
parterres, French history rolled on
through the military triumphs of
Turenne and Conde, the economic
miracles of Colbert, the foundations of
overseas empire, eventually to the fear-
ful disasters of the Sun King’s last
years, when the war of the Spanish Suc-
cession left France a vast hospital and
sen t a beggared country sliding toward
the abyss of revolution. Louis XIV gave
France la gloire in full measure. The
price of it was an aristocracy reduced to
irresponsible spendthrift idleness, a
bankrupted bourgeoisie, and a dumb,
desperate* and starving peasantry.
Nancy Mitford had a huge storehouse
of material to draw on for “The Sun
King” and she has exercised her choice
with art and intelligence. This is a fas-
cinating book, vividly evocative, im-
mensely readable, and obviously inspired
by a passionate admiration for the age
and its achievements mirrored in the
walls of Versailles.
Versailles, in fact, is the real theme
of Nancy Mitford’s book its creation,
its continual enlargement, and the
kaleidoscope of life within its walls
after King Louis finally made the still-
unfinished building the site of his
Court in the 16605. Once Louis estab-
lished himself at Versailles he seldom
left it except for brief visits to Fon-
tainebleau or to the fantastic cascades
and pavilions of Marly. Paris, haunted
by dreadful boyhood memories of the
Fronde, he hated.
Versailles was a 20-room hunting
lodge on the edge of a dirty little village
surrounded by forest and when
the transformation begcr... Wolves
could still be hunted in the nearby
woods until Louis’ son, Monseigneur
le Dauphin, extirpated the last of them.
From Vaux-le-Vicomte, the estate of
the disgraced Treasurer Fouquet, the
King acquired the trio of genius res-
ponsible for his initial building plans
Le Vau the architect, Le Notre the
gardener, and Le Brun the painter and
decorator. Later on Mansart took over
and built the tremendous facade and
the flanking blocks that form the garden
front today. Later still, long after the
Sun King’s death, came the fripperies
added by his uninspiring descendants
the Trianons and the frivolous little
fake hamlet where Marie Antoinette
played at being a milkmaid.
]\/[UCH has been written of the seamier
side of Versailles’ life—the slaughter-
houses in the cellars, the dirt beneath
the perfumed finery, the lack of sani-
tation. However, Nancy Mitford insists
that there were some privies in the
palace, though visitors had to bribe a
servant to use them. (She recalls, inci-
dentally, that things were not much
better when she was presented at Buck-
ingham Palace in the 19205; the only
convenience pi'ovided for the ladies after
a long, chilly wait in The Mall was a
solitary chamber-pot.)
Probably the healthiest inhabitant of
Versailles, in an age when disease and
the doctors swept off a dozen great
names every year, was the King him-
self. He was a big, bull-necked man
with a gargantuan appetite, a devoted
hunstman who spent every spare day-
light hour on horseback, and an insati-
able lover. When he was in his 70s
Madame de Maintenon was complain-
ing that he still insisted on his con-
jugal rights at least once a day.
The character of Louis XIV was a
strange compound that still defies
biographers. But in Versailles, with all
the outrageous extravagances that
Nancy Mitford lovingly describes, he
left more than a mere monument to-
his- arrogance.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Hark the Herald!
THE “Age” affair had been brewing for some time. There
havje always been interested bidders for Melbourne’s
stately morning newspaper. But the Syme family, oper-
ating through the cohesive David Syme Trust, holding 60
percent of the ordinary capital, had contrived to remain
independent. In the past few months, however, things began
to move apace as the advancing age of 88-year-old Oswald
Syme, the last living offspring of the late David Syme,
brought the Trust nearer to its termination, which takes
place on his death.
So interested parties in Sydney and Melbourne (and per-
haps in London, too) have been preparing for the end of
the Syme Trust. The inevitable fragmentation of the family
holdings when this happens would make it difficult for the
Symes to maintain their controlling interest, and the fear
that the company might come “under the control of rival
newspapers at present in direct competition with the ‘Age’ ”
(there are no prizes for guessing the Melbourne “Herald”
group) was the stated spur to the last week’s “partnership”
deal by the Symes with the John Fairfax group, publishers
of the “Sydney Morning Herald” and the “Sun.”
One of those preparing for . the end of the Trust was the
Melbourne “Herald” group. In the past three months it
has added considerably to its already sizable shareholding
in David Syme Ltd. And it may not have been a coincidence
that at the same time it was fighting an unsuccessful High
Court action in an attempt to invalidate sections of the
Broadcasting and Television Act dealing with the ownership
and control of TV licences. For the Act sets limits on the
number of shares one newspaper company with television
interests can acquire in another newspaper company that
also has a stake in television, even when the purpose of
acquiring those shares may have nothing to do with tele-
vision, and when the changed control of the newspaper would
not mean any real change in control of the television stations
in which it held an interest. The Melbourne “Herald’s” aim
was to have the law declared invalid because it went beyond
the control of TV services, in that people with no real interest
in TV licences were deemed by the Act to have such an
interest, and that people were deemed to be able to exercise
control over TV licences when in fact they could not.
For example, the “Age” has an 18 percent holding in
Melbourne’s GTV9, but this is so outweighed by the Aus-
tralian Consolidated Press shareholding in TCN, which
controls more than 60 percent of GTV and so clearly controls
the station, that the “Age’s” could not seriously be regarded
as a very influential holding. But it would prevent any
group like the Melbourne “Herald” (which, under the
terms of the Act, already controls four television stations)
from acquiring control of David Syme Ltd. so long as it
held its interest in GTV.
The law prohibits any person pr company from acquiring
after 1964 a prescribed interest in more than one TV
licence in any capital city, more than two in any State, or
more than three throughout Australia, and defines a five
percent holding as a “prescribed interest.”
But there are doubts that the Melbourne “Herald” really
wanted control of the “Age.” It was significant that the
Melbourne “Herald’s” recent buying of an extra 130,000
David Syme shares, at around the $2.45 mark each, lifted its
holding to only a few thousand over \ million of the 5 mil-
MEN AND MATTERS
FOR businessmen, there were two
significant appointments to last
week’s Holt Ministry. The Sydney
company lawyer, Nigel Bowen, QC, be-
came Attorney-General and the man
responsible for the controversial trade
practices legislation. Mr. C. R. (Bert)
Kelly, the South Australian farmer who
dislikes high tariffs and says so no mat-
ter what Government policy happens to
be, became Minister for Works.
Bert Kelly, the slow-speaking, de-
termined “scientific” farmer, has waged
a long battle against the “excessive”
protectionism of the present Tariff
Board and the Minister for Trade, Mr.
J. McEwen. It is ironic enough that
Kelly, a Liberal, should regard a
Country Party Minister as too protec-
tionist; but, in addition, Bert Kelly’s
father was a member of the Tariff
Board.
AT 4.10 p.m. on Tuesday of last
week, Mr. Nigel Bowen, QC,
walked out. of the Equity Court
after appearing in his last case as an
advocate before flying to Canberra the
following morning to be sworn in as
Attorney-General. Mr. Bowen, the third
“B” QC in a row to hold the Sydney
suburban seat of Parramatta (following
Sir Howard Beale and Sir Garfield
Barwick), has given up a lucrative prac-
tice to take over the
Attorney - General
job from Billy
Snedden.
His last case, ap-
propriately enough,
a winding-up order,
was before Mr. Jus-
tice Hardie, who
some years ago was
an unsuccessful in-
dependent candi-
date in Bradfield
against Mr. H. B.
Turner.
C. R. Kelly
Mr. Justice Hardie
Nigel Bowen
Mr. Bowen is strongly in favor of
the principles of the controversial Trade
Practices Act, to which so many busi-
nessmen still find objection despite some
significant softening of the original
Barwick proposals. Although he had
been a critic of some procedures under
the Act, he won’t be changing any of
the basic features of the legislation,
Nigel Bowen created quite an im-
pression in his two years as a back
bencher, even though it took him almost
12 months to get around to making his
maiden speech (on Housing Loans In-
surance Corporation legislation). As
chairman of the Government Mem-
bers Taxation and Finance Committee
he successfully moved 35 amendments
to last year’s Income Tax Bill, includ-
ing a major tax safeguard to genuine
superannuation companies and the
granting of appeals to courts on taxa-
tion matters as a right.
Mr. Bowen, born 55 years ago in
Canada, was brought to Australia as a
child and attended the Kings School,
Parramatta, before doing law as a stu-
dent at St. Paul’s College in Sydney
University and being called to the Bar
in 1936. An ex-serviceman, he became
a QC in 1953, vice-president of the
Law Council of Australia in 1957, and
president of the N.S.W. Bar Council in
1959. A cricketer who has turned to
golf, this former lecturer in company
law and taxation and former editor of
the “Australian Law Journal” has an ex-
cellent political background —and has
three daughters, which some politicians
think are almost as useful politically as.
daughters-in-law.


“There’s something wrong
with Qantas.”
lion shares on issue; or just
enough to block a complete
takeover of the company
under the 90 percent accep-
tance rule of the Com-
panies Act. This looked
very much like a “keep off”
sign to other bidders.
But the Fairfax group
appear to be defeating the
Melbourne “Herald’s” tac-
tics and also attempting to
avoid the legal conse-
quences that would follow
under the Broadcasting and
Television Act if it actually
got what the Act defines
as “control” of David Syme. So the partnership scheme
devised by which the Fairfax group and the Syme family
gain joint control over the “Age” when Mr. Oswald passes
on appears to be designed so that the Fairfax group would
have less than the 15 percent shareholding that the Act
regards as a controlling interest, even though it will jointly
“control” the company with the Symes. Under the scheme,
David Syme has placed one million 50-cent shares with
John Fairfax at $2.22. Until the death of Mr. Oswald
Syme, the trustees will continue to hold the controlling in-
terest in David Syme Ltd. Then a partnership between
Fairfax and the Symes will control the company, with
two representatives of the David Syme beneficiaries and two
of John Fairfax having equal votes in the partnership.
After the placement, David Syme’s paid up capital (in-
cluding preference shares, which have to be taken into
account under the Broadcasting and Television Act) totalled
$3.8 million. And the Act describes “control” of a company
as a 15 percent holding, so that if Fairfax has more than
$570,000 of the capital (or 1,140,000 shares) in David Syme,
it “controls” the company. The placement gave it one million
shares; it has bought a “substantial” holding from some
members of the Syme family (there appear to have been
about 120,000 shares in Syme family hands outside the
Trust) and more shares will go the Fairfax group (or at
least will be committed to the partnership) when the Trust
is terminated. And as methods of “control” under the Act
include “trusts, agreements, arrangements, understandings,
and practices whether or not having legal or equitable force,”
the actual terms of the Fairfax arrangements are vital in
determining whether the Act has been breached and, as. a
consequence, GTV’s licence ig in jeopardy.
S°, if the published details of the scheme have not yet
brought the Fairfax group into conflict with the Act, the
yet unpublished details of the actual number of shares sold
or promised to the Fairfax group by the Syme beneficiaries
could change this situation. John Fairfax already has “con-
trol” of three television stations and a “prescribed interest”
in five others. If Fairfax has breached the Act, David Syme
would be obliged to dispose of its GTV shares, and the other
shareholders would have first offer.
But all this is apart from the general question, so often
raised on the “SMH’s” finance page, of the propriety of
partial takeovers in which ordinary shareholders do not have
the right to participate. And as the Fairfax group is gaining
at least half the representation on the controlling partnership,
there is little doubt of the reality of its partial takeover,
which clearly prevents shareholders benefiting from any
other takeover bids. The Fairfax group paid an unstated
amount for the Syme family shares and only $2.22 a share
in the placement, about 20 cents below market, although to
have acquired such a holding of the existing capital in an
offer on the market would have cost much more than that,
and would have added substantially to the value of the
1,880,000 shares held by ordinary members of the public
who received no direct “power” benefits from the deal and
had no say in its consumation (and who may well have
preferred to contribute the capital needed for the “Age’s”
big rebuilding program themselves than for it to be raised
by this placement).
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: In the five months to Novem-
ber 30, wool proceeds have reached $304.3m., compared
with $265.3m. for the corresponding 1965 period;
greasy prices are averaging 49.35 cents a lb., against
47.82 cents previously.
Total civilian employment rose by 13,600 in the
three months to October; this same interval in 1965
had seen a growth of 19,400, while the 1964 quarter
actually added 32,700.
The president of the Bank of New South Wales, Mr.
J. Cadwallader, does not believe interest rates are
likely to show “any significant fall.”
For the markets: Two days of quite excited
dealings in Consolidated Gold Fields of Australia gave
spice to Australian share markets last week. Apart
from this, industrials have reinforced their advance with
a better demand among more second-liners.
Domesticity took preference over Rhodesia in
London, especially on some hints of lightening the
“squeeze.” Yet buyer demand remains rigidly selective,
moving to the leaders, and individual advances are
small . . . Moderate volumes on Wall Street are still
distinguished by a very mixed approach; the end-of-
year surge seems haphazard.
FOr companies : High-level management reorg-
anisation at BHP, after some American consultancy, is
intended to cope with the group’s vastly increasing
complexity and diversification; among other wide-
sweeping changes, the chairman, Sir Colin Syme, be-
comes a full-time executive and the managing director,
Mr. Norman Jones, retires on January 31 to be suc-
ceeded by Sir lan McLennan. Meanwhile, output of
pig iron and steel ingots exhibits a distinct rise for the
six months to November.
John Fairfax and Sons and the Syme family are
eventually to share control of the Melbourne “Age”
under a just-negotiated partnership agreement . . . The
drawn-out takeover struggle for F. W. Williams appears
to have been won by Pioneer Concrete Services and lost
by Martin Corporation; the Williams’ board has “con-
sistently” rebuffed Martin ... A N.S.W. country com-
munications chain, Western Newspapers Ltd., will seek
Sydney Stock Exchange listing after a public offer of
rights to 50-cent shares at 41 cents.
Builders still wrestle with a host of problems . . .
Just after cancellation of its Rocks tender, James
Wallace had to announce a $853,942 loss, following
1964-65’s small $32,572 profit; current major contracts
are apparently “in a satisfactory position” ... If
Concrete Industries recovers “most” of its North West
Cape investment, directors propose to return some
capital to shareholders . . . Construction contracts of
Sydney’s Project Development Corporation have been
profitable in 1966-67’s first quarter.
Steel, aluminium, and tractor dealer William Adams
achieved a half-year’s higher sales but found profits
down; however, the current profit trend is improving
. . . The breaking drought helped tractor maker Massey-
Ferguson in its last quarter, so sales crept from $37.4m.
to $37.6m.; here again, though, earnings went back
from $2,171,554 to $1,618,411.
“Promising values” are emerging from two drill
holes at Hill 50 Gold’s main mine . . . More nickel
is prospectively born, this time to Metals Exploration
N.L. at Greenvale, north Queensland; assessment pro-
ceeds . . . Greenbushes Tin will “never be as good as
indicated in the prospectus” ... A small oil recovery
came from West Australian Petroleum’s Erregulla well.
The first four months of 1966-67 provided Marrick-
ville Holdings with a 20.5 percent sales lift . . .
Men’s wear retailer F. J. Palmer lost $467,767 (pre-
viously $1,249,456) and ran into computer trouble in
its debtors’ ledgers.

A Greek in the City
By CROESUS
DO we really need Government
supervision of the capital market?
Better still, do we want it? In
making the suggestion at the annual
meeting of Development Finance Cor-
poration, Mr. J. H. D. Marks raises
a question of fundamental importance,
which cannot be dismissed lightly in a
setting where our Attorneys-General are
bent on an extensive exercise in Com-
panies Acts’ reform and ways have to
be found for more effective marshalling
and the better deployment of local
capital resources.
Admittedly Mr. Marks doesn’t
predicate the precise functions to be
delegated to such a secretariat apart
from the examination and approval of
prospectuses. But let us be perfectly
clear on the lines of Mr. Marks’ think-
ing. He wants the Federal and State
Governments to form a central secre-
tariat to approve the marketing of
securities and generally to supervise the
capital market.
From his analysis of suggested
advantages, it emerges that he sees
such a body as the final arbiter for the
approval of all prospectuses and, by
implication from his remarks, it seems
he is envisaging no less than an all-
embracing species of control for all
capital issues. This is because one of
the advantages seen by him in the pro-
posals would be that it would provide
information on national capital re-
quirements to “help governments to
avoid the unnecessary restrictions and
distortions that now exist.”
With distinguished service to Govern-
ment and the Commonwealth Bank to
his credit, the role of Greek in the
capital market may not be all that
uncongenial to Mr. Marks. And maybe,
with his ear so close to the authorities,
somebody in official places has put him
up to it or at least encouraged his
thoughts on the national exercise in
how to cut corners in solving the several
problems posed in his discussion. These
problems are real enough to get the
right sort of protection for investors;
to deter the unscrupulous and encour-
age the honest director; to speed the
national marketing of new securities;
to get a more efficient use of national
resources, and so on.
MR- MARKS undoubtedly sees a close
relationship between all these prob-
lems and, obviously, thinks that they
don’t have to be approached piecemeal
as in the present fashion but rather are
capable of an overall solution once the
principle of government intrusion into
the private capital market is conceded.
The difficulty from my viewpoint is
whether that principle should be sacri-
ficed simply to achieve the better pro-
tection for investors and the stream-
lining of security marketing on a
national basis, which seem to be worry-
ing Mr. Marks most. As I see it, the
latter considerations can be attended to
without a wholesale Government incur-
sion into the private capital market,
which Mr. Marks thinks necessary in
part, anyway, to accomplish a more
ordered and economic disposition of
capital resources.
Even if Mr. Marks is right in think-
ing there is a close inter-relationship
between this latter problem of how to
get a more rational allocation of capital
resources and the other problems, it
would still seem possible and more
desirable in the interest of sustaining
the private enterprise system not to
brook more Government interference
with it and its reliance on market forces.
On the line of resistance to his proposal,
while it may not be fully agreed that
all the mooted changes in the Com-
panies Acts now being considered by
the Attorneys-General are desirable, it
has to be conceded that many of them
would help materially in achieving the
much-needed clean-up of private finance
(particularly in the involvement of
public companies with proprietaries).
Equally, it should be possible, and,
in fact, considerable progress, has already
been made in this direction in the past
few years, for the capital market to put
its own house in order, so, at least, to
achieve a speedier and more foolproof
process of national marketing of securi-
ties, as Mr. Marks rightly deems neces-
sary.
in Sydney, financiers in Melbourne
were not enthusiastic about the
Marks’ proposal. As one put it, of the
finance companies continually in the
market for funds, those with the best
standing seldom (especially recently)
have any difficulty in filling their re-
quirements of funds and at lower
interest rates compared with those on
the outer fringe of respectability who
discount paper of dubious or lesser
quality. The market is no fool and
assesses the merits of borrowers more
accurately than a group of officials in
Canberra could ever hope to do. The
financiers could not see any point in
having an official surveillance imposed.
It would only complicate the smooth
working of the market. Underwriters
were of the, same opinion.
One suggestion put up by financiers
in Melbourne was that the most useful
addition to the local finance scenery
would be a central credit bureau along
the lines established in the United
States, where the credit standing of
would-be credit buyers is indexed and
available to all purveyors of consumer
and industrial credit. Americans visit-
ing or getting involved in the credit
business here express astonishment at
the absence of such a bureau here.
One’s credit rating would have to be
pretty high in the U.S., say, to get
enough paint to paint your house on
H.P. or to buy a $3BO mink stole on
a down payment of 50 cents. Two such
recent instances of ill-advised financing
on consumer credit occuring in Mel-
bourne were quoted to me this week by
the general manager of a big finance
company, who promptly cut off his
flow of finance to the supplier of the
goods.
In his view, probably the best re-
flection of the American astonishment
at our poor arrangements for tabbing
people’s credit-worthiness is seen in
the National City Bank of New York’s
insistence that Waltons buy back all
their slow credit accounts.


MAN ON THE LAND
Wool's Mission to Moscow
THE Australian Wool Industry Con-
ference, the “parliament of the
wool industry,” has frequently
been accused of being little more than
a “rubber stamp” for the Australian
Wool Board. Slogans (in wool politics
as well as anything else) are handy
devices but seldom tell the whole story.
Slogans can lead one astray. If it is
true, for instance, that Australia’s
foreign policy is neatly explained by
the “all the way with LBJ” slogan, then
the current policy in wool would appear
to be “let’s all chip in to help Kosygin.”
Nevertheless, the Wool Industry Con-
ference must soon, next year probably,
decide whether it will endorse the
recent visit to Moscow by the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat delegation
headed by Wool Board (and IWS)
chairman Sir William Gunn and the
as yet unexplained wool marketing over-
tones of the trip. It is quite fair, we
believe, to state that within the IWS,
the Wool Board, and in some circles in
Canberra there is a school of thought
which would like to see “Government
to Government” sales of wool made
possible.
“Government to Government” is a
slogan, too, but in broad terms this is
how wheat is sold. There is, therefore,
a ready-made persuader available to the
forces which desire wool-marketing
change. Most farmers who grow wheat
also run sheep and most farmers are
unlikely to question the argument that
wheat could not be sold any other way.
It could, of course. Both the United
States and Canada sell wheat under a
different system to Australia, but, to
revert to slogans, neither uses a com-
pletely “private enterprise” method.
What woolgrowers, or their delegates
to the Wool Industry Conference, will
have to keep in mind is the issue. This
will be difficult. The issue is not that
wool cannot be sold to the Soviet, and
Soviet bloc countries, any way other
than by Government to Government.
buys wool, when she needs it,
from Australia now, and has done so
for 50 years. So does Poland, Yugo-
slavia, and Czechoslovakia. But this
could be overlooked. Woolgrowers could
be* put in a frame of mind where, by
associating wool with wheat, they will
come to believe that a Government to
Government form of marketing will
bring them great benefits. They will be
assured that it will be in the “national
interest” —another slogan.
In short, the Russian trip, and the
promise of enormous sales of wool, will
be used to help bring about a wool-
marketing authority similar to the
Wheat Board, and this, as much as
anything, is the issue.
The Wool Industry Conference is
made up of men who are essentially
farmers. Some combine farming with
business interests and have a broad out-
look. To be a farmer does not neces-
sarily imply a narrow outlook. But
generally speaking, the farmer admits
he is sometimes at a disadvantage in
deciding big issues because he is, per-
force, closely tied to the everyday
problems of running a property. He
tends to rely heavily on advice from
people he can trust.
JT is not the advice the organisations
get from their own officers that in-
terests us here. It is the advice the farm
organisations, the Wool Board itself,
and even the Country Party, get from
the Canberra public sector planners.
In the functioning of most of the
primary producer boards there is a
common thread. Economic policies
have an uncanny similarity in that
London School of Economics (circa
1930) theories keep coming up.
The Wool Industry Conference, under
its new constitution, has at least the
chance of asserting itself and deciding
whether the advice which comes to it,
through the Wool Board, the Country
Party, and in other ways is good advice.
It need not be a rubber stamp. The
decision rests squarely with the dele-
gates. The constitution is not very dif-
ferent to the old one.
If the Conference wants to, it would
appear that it can elect its own chair-
man and that a chairman, so elected,
must have a big voice in wool matters.
The Conference chairman, indeed, could
tend to overshadow the Wool Board
chairman. If this is vague, then it is for
a good reason. It could be shown, in
theory, that in the past the delegates
have had exactly the same power. But
what happens, and this applies to most
of the primary producer boards (includ-
ing the Wool Board), is that the word
comes through that the Minister wants
so-and-so, and then the members go
through a form of approving, by elec-
tion if necessary, the appointment.
The year may yet see a clash of
opinion as to whether courting Soviet
Russia means as much to the Australian
woolgrower as promoting Australian
textiles. The chairman of Felt and Tex-
tiles, Sir Robert Webster, in his annual
address bemoaned the difficulties facing
woollen manufacturers in Australia and
referred to the handicap of fluctuating
wool prices. If this is the prelude to a
concerted effort by Australian textile
manufacturers to influence woolgrower
opinion on marketing matters, then it
is not to be taken lightly. In the bitter
reserve price arguments (culminating in
the defeat of the Wool Board plan), the
voice of manufacturers in Australia was
rarely heard. As a factor in the voting
it was negligible.
There is something of a slogan, too,
about Sir Robert Webster’s statement
that both primary and secondary sides
of wool (growing and processing) “play
their part in the welfare of the coun-
try.” If this is taken up and developed
by other spokesmen for manufacturing
in Australia, and if it gets across to
woolgrowers, then at least we will have
a new factor in wool discussions.
AGRISEARCH
What to Feed Animals
CHRISTMAS festivities treat us to
manifold gustatory and olfactory
joys. While savoring the multi-
plicity of sweetmeats, some of us may
ruminate self-consciously on the popula-
tion explosion and the rapidly increasing
competition for food. Already in more
than half the world people count them-
selves fortunate to have sufficient of one
staple, such as rice, let alone the flavor-
some variety which tempts many of us
to consume more than our bodies really
need. Fewer of us will think of the next
link in the food chain and realise that
the same population explosion is also
creating food problems for animals.
Quite a lot of the food traditionally
offered to animals could also be eaten
by humans. More and more of it in the
coming years will be processed into
forms acceptable to the human palate,
leaving less for the animals. Eventually
we will have to find alternative foods
acceptable to them or train the animals
somehow to accept the new foods. Fail-
ing either of these we will just hajye to
reduce the number of animals.
Some progress has, for instance, been
made in feeding the pure chemical
urea to sheep and cattle as a substitute
starting-point for the protein they would
normally get from good pasturage. Aus-
tralia, with its relatively unimportant
pig, poultry, and dairying industries,
will not be pressed into looking for
alternative feeds for livestock as soon
or as hard as many other countries.
Nevertheless, this column (8., Dec. 10)
mentioned that it was now barely profit-
able to feed skim milk to our pigs and
that soybean production or fishmeal
manufacture might, well be stepped up
in the near future to provide an alterna-
tive protein for pig feeding.
The trend to higher stocking rates for
sheep and cattle is leading some of our
scientists to consider more carefully the
question of palatability. The digestibility
of fodder has a considerable influence
on an animal’s appetite, which, in turn,
influences its growth rate and produc-
tivity. Palatability, digestibility, and
intake may all be related for grazing-
animals no less than for certain labora-
tory animals and humans.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT AT THE
46th ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF
FELT & TEXTILES
OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED, HELD FRIDAY,
2nd DECEMBER, 1966 AT 12 NOON
Sir Robert Webster, C.M.G., C.B.E., M.C.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
In opening my address I should like
to welcome here today the Chairman
of Felt and Textiles of New Zealand
Ltd., Mr. I. D. Reid, who has again
come from New Zealand to join us at
our Annual Meeting. We are very happy
to have him here with us today.
A copy of the Company’s 46th Annual
Report has been circulated to you and
I do not propose to repeat to you the
information that is contained in it.
Rather shall I make some general com-
ments on trends and conditions since
the end of June.
Operations since June:
Firstly, with respect to trading for the
four months to the end of October, there
has been in Australia a slight drop in
sales overall approximately 3%
compared with the corresponding four
months of 1965, but this to some extent
reflects lower wool values this season.
In the Floorcoverings Division sales
showed a substantial increase.
Although the operating profits before
tax were down on last year the final
profit after tax for the four months is in
line with the previous year, after allow-
ing for past tax losses brought forward.
Stocks are almost $2,000,000 less than
at the end of June, and your Company
is in a very liquid position.
So far as New Zealand is concerned
the favourable trend in sales and profit •
reported last year has been maintained
this year. While recognising that the
New Zealand Company’s progress is re-
lated to the state t)f the general economy,
the New Zealand Board are nevertheless
confident that this year should produce
a further satisfactory result.
There is one comment I should like to
make, however, in comparing this year’s
results so far in Australia with the first
four months of last year’s, and that is
that the second half of the financial year
1965/66 was the period which led to a
reduced profit for the year. The January
to June period was a very difficult one,
and compared with this the four months
of this financial year are showing a de-
cided improvement with one very im-
portant exception wool.
The Wool Situation:
There is no need for me to tell you
of the importance to Australia of the
wool industry, but you may not realise
how closely your own company is con-
nected with it. It is a major processor
of wools in Australia, purchasing and
processing last year 2i% of the total
Australian clip 119,000 bales
plus another 14,000 bales processed on
commission. Of our wool products
tops, scoured and carbonised wool
$11,500,000 worth was exported to over
40 countries in various parts of the
world. Your topmaking and combing
factory, James Seymour & Co., at
Williamstown, employs nearly 700
people and is working to capacity six
days a week. In addition another 150
people are employed in scouring and
carbonising.
Seymour’s wooltop, produced on the
latest type of equipment, is recognised
and accepted throughout the world be-
cause of its high quality, yet such is the
state of the wool industry everywhere at
present that competition in overseas
markets involves the acceptance of con-
tracts at prices which do not show an
adequate return, but without which the
mill would have to cease working.
In some respects the present year is
probably the worst in the wool trade’s
history since the early 30’s. During the
1965/66 season there was a tendency
for auction prices to increase progres-
sively but it became increasingly harder
to obtain from overseas buyers com-
mensurately higher prices. Thus margins
decreased. In the current season prices
have been trending downwards, bring-
ing in their train the usual lack of con-
fidence because of the uncertainties of
a falling market.
Fluctuations in the price of wool have
proved to be a fertile ground for the
growth in popularity of man-made fibres
and their firmly quoted prices. The sup-
ply of synthetics is ever increasing in
volume and there is progressive improve-
ment by way of variety, quality and con-
sumer acceptance. Furthermore the trend
in prices of synthetics over the years
has been steadily downward.
More and more the overseas purchaser
has sought to shed himself of the com-
modity risk so far as wool was con-
cerned. Purchasers have come to demand
not only firm prices but long credit
terms. The outcome has been to squeeze
profits of the wool processor and mer-
chant till now they have reached the
present unsatisfactory stage.
There is another factor which adds to
the burden of the wool processor
when a contract is entered into he has
to ensure that he will be able to fulfil
it, and the fundamental factor is, of
course, to have the right type of wool,
which cannot necessarily be purchased
throughout the year. Stocks therefore
have to be carried against firm orders
received but for fulfilment some months
ahead. A further period is then generally
involved before payment is received
probably up to 180 days from the ship-
ment of the order.
It is patent therefore that the pro-
cessing industry is one which requires an
abnormally high investment in working
capital alone.
Added Value to Exports:
Through the wool activities of your
Company, 850 people are employed
receiving $2,750,000 per annum in
salaries and wages. Furthermore the
added value to our exports arising from
the processing operation amounts to
something over $1,500,000. It therefore
follows that if the wool we processed
were exported in the greasy state, Aus-
tralia’s export income would be reduced
by that $1,500,000. Another significant
factor from the national point of view
is that 2i% of purchasing power in the
market; must have some effect in the
auction room.


domesticated animals are restricted to
monotonous diets, consisting sometimes
of virtually only one plant species and
even a particular strain of that species.
But in the recent past, if our animals
lacked variety, there was rarely a limit
on the quantity available to them. Now
higher stocking is making the sheep and
cattle work harder to fill their bellies.
Perhaps we are reaching the point when
they will come to look upon foraging
as an unrewarding chore and persist in
it only so far as they must to maintain
life. They will not continue to repletion.
Growth and production, consequently,
will be limited. If the pasture, though
sparse, consisted of highly palatable
species they might be induced to forage
harder. Perhaps, on the other hand, the
palates of our domestic animals have
long since become dulled as a result of
being forced for generations to eat very-
monotonous fare. Indeed, some Ameri-
can research suggests that this may well
have happened.
To contend with some of the prob-
lems emanating from heavy stocking,
Dr. G. W. Arnold, CSIRO, Canberra,
believes that we will have to acquire a
much better knowledge of grazing
behaviour and the feed preferences of
our different breeds of sheep and cattle.
This information, he thinks, would
enable us to develop more profitable,
and probably more humane, grazing
management systems. It would also help
the plant breeders to produce pasture
varieties which cattle would find more
appetising.
WITH these ends in mind he has con-
ducted some rather sanguine experi-
ments to explore with some exactitude
the importance to sheep of sight, smell,
taste, and touch in selecting their diet.
Blindfolds were used to cut off nearly
all the light reaching the eyes of some
sheep. (When a little light is let through
the animals remain reasonably calm
and so behave fairly normally.) The
senses of smell and taste, and touch in
the lips, tongue, and muzzle were
blocked out by surgical operations in
which certain nerves were severed. Some
sheep were deprived of all three of
these faculties, others of two, and still
others of only one. Numerous small
plots of pasture containing a great
number of species and strains of grasses,
clover, and herbs were available to these
sheep. By calculating the amount of
each species growing on a plot before
it was grazed and afterward, the grazing
preferences of the sheep could be deter-
mined and correlated with their sensory
impairment.
Oddly enough, the senseless sheep
accommodated to their plight remark-
ably well. In wool production and body-
weight they matched the performance
of normal sheep over several years.
Only at times of stress, such as when
the pasture consisted almost entirely of
tall, dry roughage, did the deprived
sheep reflect their handicaps. Yet im-
pairment of the various senses had an
obvious effect on the acceptability of
different pasture species and even of
strains of one species.
Your Company would naturally be
interested in any sound proposal for an
improved marketing scheme for wool if
this would 'ead to some stability in the
industry. The importance of first-class
promotion is undeniable stimulation
of demand is essential and, in your
Board’s view, it is demonstrably in the
interests of the National Economy that
the processing of wool in Australia is
given every encouragement.
Between 1960/61 and 1962/63 there
was a significant rise in the output of
processed wool in Australia, but since
then there has been a steady decline
as the following figures show:
1960/61 162.1 million lbs.
1961/62 172.6 million lbs.
1962/63 177.6 million lbs.
1963/64 166.3 million lbs.
1964/65 165.2 million lbs.
1965/66 162.5 million lbs.
A somewhat similar trend can be seen
in the wool content of woollen and
worsted fabrics over the period. Al-
though, until 1965/66 there was little
fluctuation in total output, the propor-
tion of pure wool articles has con-
sistently been falling.
I should tell you that, despite the wide
demand for carpets made from man-
made fibres, your Company still uses
10,000 bales of wool per annum in car-
pet manufacture in Australia. As an
organisation we do not set out to pro-
mote any one fibre against another
we aim to produce what the market
wants.
National Importance:
It is important from the national point
of view that there should continue to be
growth and development in the wool
processing industry. Quite obviously if
the present trend is to continue, this
growth will not take place. It is worth
pointing out to our shareholders that
under present conditions it would be
practicable for Felt and Textiles to close
down its wool operations completely,
realise on its assets and meet its
liabilities, and invest the net funds then
available at current rates of interest,
and show a better profit than is being
earned by the Wool Division. The large
amount of working capital we employ
in wool activities is fully realisable and,
moreover, capable of realisation over a
relatively short time. Stocks of wool are
readily saleable on international markets
and our book debts are sound. Con-
sequently, while your Board is not con-
templating any such steps, I do want to
emphasise that your Board’s concern is
with the future earnings position of its
wool activities, not the realisation of its
investment therein.
It is high time there was a more wide-
spread appreciation of the fact that the
wool industry, which is of prime im-
portance to the Australian economy, and
has been for decades, consists not only
of the primary side of wool growing,
but also the secondary side of process-
ing. Each plays its part in the welfare of
the country, and in the interests of the
economy wool processing in Australia
should be promoted and developed.
Exports:
I have already mentioned the large
part wool plays in your Company’s
total exports, but in addition to the
$11,500,000 worth of processed wool
sent overseas we have been from time
to time extending the range of products
exported and the areas to which exports
are made and last year the value of
these other products exported was
$500,000. We have recently received an
award from the Department of Trade
and The Associated Chamber of Manu-
factures in recognition of the success of
our export promotion.
New Activities:
Your Company has recently been in-
vestigating the opportunities in the plas-
tics field which an association with a
large European group promises to offer.
The new fields which this may open up
could lead to a significant increase in
the variety of your Company’s products.
Board of Directors:
As you know, Colonel Spowers who
had rendered splendid service as a
member of the Board for 14 years,
retired at the end of June last.
Recently an invitation was extended
to Sir Ewen Waterman to join the Board
and we are very happy at his acceptance.
Sir Ewen Waterman’s name is one
which is held in the highest esteem in
world wool circles. He was Australian
representative on the International Wool
Secretariat in London from 1948-1955
and was its Chairman from 1952-1954.
He was subsequently a member of the
Australian Wool Bureau, as it was then
called, and is now Chairman of the
Australian Wool Industry Congress.
Sir Ewen’s interests have not been
confined to wool, however. Besides being
on the Board of Elder Smith Golds-
brough Mort Ltd. perhaps the largest
wool-broking firm in the world, and
Chairman of Onkaparinga Woollen Co.
Ltd., he is also on the Board of News
Ltd., which publishes several metro-
politan newspapers, and also the national
newspaper “The Australian”, and he is a
Director of Southern Television Cor-
poration Ltd. His wide experience will
enable him to make a valuable contribu-
tion to the Board.
I now wish formally to move the
adoption of the Directors’ Report,
Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss
Account for the year ended 30th June,
1966, and I shall be pleased if someone
would second this motion, when it will
be open for discussion.

MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
WHAT are Consolidated Gold
Fields shares really worth? In
all the hoo-haa of its first day’s
trading last week, when 11 percent of
the company’s 5 million newly listed
shares (out of its total capital of 22
million shares) changed hands and
when the price rose as high as $4.15
for shares placed at $2.50, buyers
appeared to be putting a very large
value indeed of $1.50 a share on the
company’s one-third interest in the iron
ore development at Mt. Goldsworthy.
At around $4, the market was capi-
talising Gold Fields at $BB million, or
about $32 million more than its share
of the capitalisation of its listed sub-
sidiary and associate companies in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. The market
seemed to think that its stake in Mt.
Goldsworthy, in which it has spent or
plans to spend a total of about $lB
million, was worth $l4 million more
than that.
The existing iron ore contract should
return about 50 cents a share in profits
from the 16J million tons to be
exported over the next seven years.
The market capitalisation of CGFA’s
stake in its other investments totals
about 2| dollars a share, so at current
prices for the other “stable” stocks,
the subscribers to Gold Fields’ issue were
getting a free ride into the iron ore.
Based on likely profits from Mt.
Goldsworthy’s existing contract with the
Japanese, without considering any
further orders, Gold Fields’ shares look
to be worth closer to $3.10 than $4. This

gap of 90 cents a share suggests that
either the subsidiaries are all under-
priced or that the market expects very
large and very profitable further con-
tracts to emerge at Mt. Goldsworthy to
earn at least $6O million in profits and
be worth at least $2O million net to
Gold Fields’ shareholders. This is not
impossible, as the revenue of $l4O
million from the present contract will
pay off the borrowings and capital cost
of the project, so that future contracts
would have only the costs of extraction
and transport and so on charged against
them. But it is certainly taking a
bullish view of a long-term prospect.
THERE are some sound reasons
quite apart from the high level
of consumption over the Christ-
mas party period for investors hav-
ing a close look at two underpriced
brewery stocks that should prove highly
rewarding at current prices. They are
Tooheys, the N.S.W. brewer, and
Carlton and United, the Melbourne
monopolist that is soon to be chal-
lenged by the British Tobacco-Courage
Breweries venture.
The growth prospects for this in-
dustry are evident from the increasing
number of young men in the “peak
drinking” age.
Prospects at Tooheys have improved
considerably in recent years under an
energetic management team, and last
year’s result (profit rose slightly) was
despite the impact of drought, which
would have been serious, since Tooheys
sells about half of its output in country
areas, particularly in the drought-
prone north and west in N.S.W.
Tooheys has bigger country sales than
its big rival, Tooths, which has about
two-thirds of the total N.S.W. market.
Tooheys should do very well in
1966-67 now that the drought has
ended and the prospect of a beer price
rise sooner or later should give the
shares an added appeal. On top of
that there is the chance that the
Courage group may eventually find it
more practical to have a more national
approach to brewing and make an
offer for Tooheys. This could be to the
benefit of both parties, as Tooheys
could certainly use some extra capital
that this group could provide (there
are some obvious plant relocation needs
at Tooheys, for example).
Current prices of just over $1 give
The Chartist says:
THERE still appear to be prospects of further capital gains for holders of
KATHLEEN INVESTMENTS. The share price movements since 1960 have
shown rather wide fluctuations, and the consolidation formed during the period
from 1961 to 1965 suggested an overall base pattern. A 70 percent upward trend
which commenced toward the end of 1965 was recently “tested” for the third time,
and in spite of the current rights issue the present technical position of the stock
has “bullish” implications. Investors could expect a further rise to approximately
$3.50 in the short to medium term, where the situation would call for reassessment.
Although the present basic trend rate is 70 percent appreciation per annum, the
past history on the chart shows that much faster intermediate rates are possible at
times. Last sale price on 16/12/66 $2.52.

The Rhine Riesling grapes used for Yalumba White Table
Wines are picked when the degree of sugar and acid are
in balance (12° beaume and 8% acid). Immediately after
gently crushing through a special roller mill to avoid
stalkiness the juice is completely separated from the
skins, seeds and stems. This reduces astringency and con-
tributes to the delicacy of the wine. Fermentation is care-
fully controlled at regulated low temperatures. The wine
is then carefully prepared for very early bottling to avoid
excessive exposure to air, in order to maintain its crisp
freshness and full Rhine Riesling bouquet.

merits of Melbourne-based Gollin
Holdings. At 70 cents, the 50 cent
shares yield 6.4 percent from the steady
1965-66 dividend. Although profit for
the year declined by more than seven
percent to just a little over $1 million,
the nine percent payout was covered
almost twice by the 17.3 percent earn-
ing rate. The dividend rate is more
likely to be lifted than cut this year
and in the future. A lift to the round
figure of ten percent would be little
problem in the current year, especially
if general business activity, upon which
this group’s turnover and profits de-
pend, starts to turn upward again.
The group is essentially a marketing
organisation whose activities spread
through importing, exporting, and the
distribution of a wide range of products.
These go to both the industrial and
general consumer. It is this wide base
of activity which protects the group
from the fluctuations imposed on its less
extensive competitors and gears its suc-
cess to activity in the economy as a
whole. This concept of spread is added
to by the fact that operations are also
conducted in the U.K. and New Zea-
land.
A PREVIOUS question on this page
(8., Dec. 10), “Who was the
mysterious ‘large buyer’ of Petro-
leum Investment shares the chairman
spoke of at last September’s meeting?”
has brought one answer. Mr. J. W.
Cowan, the Melbourne investment coun-
sellor who is executive chairman of
Vehicle and General Insurance the
company now making a takeover bid for
Petroleum Investments —says that it was
certainly not him nor his clients, nor V
and G, as none of these hold any
Petroleum Investment shares at all. He
doubts that any one big buyer did
acquire any substantial proportion of
the company on the market this year.
Mr. Cowan says that he was the invest-
ment counsellor the company employed.

MINING
Miners and Ore Reserves
MINES don’t last for ever; CSR’s
decision to close down its blue
asbestos mine is a timely re-
minder of that. The 23-year-old mine
at Wittenoom has been losing money
since 1963, due to falling prices on the
one hand and lower grades and rising
costs on the other.
Most major mines in Australia have
scope, as costs increase or selling prices
fall, to increase the grade of ore treated
in order to maintain profitable opera-
tions. Most ore bodies, of course, are
not of completely even grade through-
out, but vary considerably and, although
not always possible, it is highly desir-
able that operations can be directed
to different ore grades so as to allow
the working of lower grade ores in
times of high prices, leaving the higher
grade areas to be brought in when costs
increase or prices fall. Otherwise much
mineral is likely to remain in the
ground and the full potential of the
mine will not be realised. (This pro-
cedure may not always yield the maxi-
mum profit, but is more consistent with
the efforts of mining companies to
maintain operations for the longest
possible time.) To be able to do this
the miner must be well informed as to
both the extent and the structure of the
ore body. Hence the continued pros-
pecting and development carried out
by mines which are already well estab-
lished.
Development and additional explora-
tion of established ore bodies in many
cases result in additions to established
ore reserves, and these additions not
only play their part in extending the
life of the mine but, as a corollary to
this, allow amortisation charges to be
spread over a longer period. For ex-
ample, the tin mine to be operated by
the recently floated Mt. Cleveland Tin
N.L. has a life of 12.8 years on current
reserves, costs, and metal prices; should
additional reserves be proved, profit
would benefit by a reduced amortisa-
tion charge. An increase in ore reserves
up to 20 years’ operations would reduce
amortisation of share capital by
$200,000 per annum on a straight line
basis.
When looking at ore reserve figures
published by mining companies, two
things should be kept in mind. First,
the fact that many companies’ pub-
lished ore reserves remain unchanged
year by year after the extraction of the
year’s output, indicating that the com-
panies concerned each year prove up
just sufficient ore for a year’s opera-
tions, or else publish only sufficient re-
serves for an arbitrary period. Secondly,
particularly when metal prices are
relatively high, some companies treat
ore which comes from areas outside
the published ore reserves. Such areas
may be of grades less than are deemed
necessary for longer term operations at
perhaps lower metal prices.
ir fHIS year’s balance sheets have re-
vealed some significant changes in the
reserves of some of our larger miners.
EZ Industries continues to expand re-
serves at its mines on the West Coast
of Tasmania. Ore reserves in 1963 were
million tons and in 1966 were stated
to be seven million tons —a considerable
increase. Another large increase in re-
serves was recorded by Mount Isa
Mines, which added 12£ million tons
to the previous 60.6 million tons, while
Mount Morgan recorded its first in-
crease in reserves for some years, ore
reserves rising from 9.1 million tons to
9.9 million tons. Renison Ltd. continued
to add to reserves and has now more
than double the 1964 figure.
On the other hand, reductions were
reported by Mount Lyell, where re-
serves fell from 21 million tons to 19
million tons after the treatment of 2.1
million tons of ore, giving an estimated
mine life of about 9£ years. These re-
serves are iji the open cut ore body and
take no account of the large but low
grade underground deposit known to
exist beneath the present mine and
which contains 40-45 million tons of one
percent copper ore. Other companies
where reserves are lower than a year
ago include Western Titanium N.L. and
Aberfoyle Holdings Limited, but in
both of these cases the drop in re-
serves was not as great as the amount
of ore extracted, indicating that small
additions were made to ore reserves
during the year.
Needless to say, the grade of reserves
is equally as important as their size.

reserve grades as against the grade of

ore mined can yield some interesting
information. Mount Morgan Limited
provides a good illustration of this.
Over the past 12 years the grade of ore
mined has been lower than the average
grade of reserves in all but three years
in the case of gold and in all but one
year in the case of copper. In the years
from 1963 to 1965 the grade of ore
reserves was 2.34 dwts. gold per ton
and 1.10 percent copper, while the
grades of ore mined in these years were
1.42, 1.55, and 1.94 dwts. per ton in the
case of gold, and .72 percent, .71 per-
cent, and .64 percent in the case of
copper. These figures would normally
indicate that in the future the company
can expect to be mining higher grade
ore, as occurred in 1966, but in the case
of Mount Morgan this is complicated
by the fact that the company each year
extracts a sizable amount of ore from
outside published ore reserves. This ore
is of grades lower than the published
ore reserves and has the effect of reduc-
ing the overall grade of ore mined,
However, this is less detrimental than
it appears; the bulk of ore will still
come from published ore reserves and
hence the ore extracted from these
reserves in the future can be expected
to be at higher levels than in the past
(more so in relation to copper; in the
case of gold grades it is unlikely that
these will continue at the 1966 level, but
they should certainly be higher than
the 1963-1965 figures). The .extraction
of ore from outside published reserves,
while diluting the grade of ore mined,
has a favorable effect in prolonging the
life of the whole operation. Improve-
ments in grade do not have to be large
to have a significant effect on Mount
Morgan’s profits.
COMMODITIES
Mixed Outlook for Copper
COPPER is still the centre of in-
terest in the metals markets, with
several new, generally encourag-
ing, developments, as well as the old
familiar discouraging problems.
The Zambian copper producers have
lifted smelter output from 66 percent to
75 percent of capacity. The reason is
“an improvement” in the fuel supply
position. Domestic coal production has
been boosted sharply in recent months,
but it is generally felt that the probable
•basis for the statement was a lift in
Rhodesian supplies. For coal has not
been included in the items exported
from Rhodesia covered by the sanctions
scheme in the UN.
Recently —before the latest ructions —
Rhodesia and Zambia had been holding
secret talks on the rail transport hold-up
between the two nations. Evidently,
some agreement was reached, which
would have contributed to the “im-
provement” in supplies.
The position is, of course, a little like
something from Lewis Carroll, for the
two hostile nations are economically de-
pendent on each other, although both
are working to change the situation, at
considerable expense.
Of more lasting importance for
copper is the rapid spread of interest
in the new “Torco” process for treating
oxide ores. The “treatment of refrac-
tory copper ores” process, mentioned
here early this year, was pronounced
“commercial” recently by its originator,
Anglo-American Corporation.
Two of the main developments plan-
ned for the process are in Mauritania
and Zambia.
THREE estimates of 1966-67 world
sugar supplies were recently made:
65.5 million tons, 65 million tons,
and 64.4 million tons. Taking the
middle figure, the U.S. Agriculture
Department’s, a surplus over consump-
tion of about 7 percent is likely, lifting
stocks to 28 million tons. Consumption
normally grows about 4 percent a year.
The forecast lift in output is likely
to be greater than the rise in consump-
tion, although production will not
regain all the ground lost in 1965-66.
Australia, Cuba, South Africa, Russia,
and Western Europe will provide the
lift.
Australian sugar producers have at
least been fortunate in excellent weather
conditions for growing and harvesting
this season. One miller, Pioneer Sugar
Mills Ltd., has paid a steady interim
dividend on the strength of the im-
proved efficiency of its operations this
year. And the $l9 million of Federal
loans will provide a financial lift at an
opportune time.
But overseas the market remains dull
and steady at about £stg. 14 a ton, at
least 50 percent below production costs
for the most efficient producer.
Although the sugar market has three
tiers domestic, overseas sales under
fixed agreements, and the marginal
“free” market, many of the overseas
contracts are at prices based on the
free market, which, as a result, is of
wide importance.
The only chance for a rise, barring
natural calamity in a major producing
area, is agreement among producers to
control markets.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Some necessary, even if expected, glamor trod the Exchanges
with the entry of Consolidated Gold Fields (Australia), and
the “stagging” was also a sight to see; the $1 shares, issued at
$2.50, made first sale at $3.90, hit $4.15, and closed their first
day (Thursday) at $4.00; Friday saw them finish at $3.98.
Elsewhere the edge went slightly off metals, but King Island
Scheelite put on 13 cents to touch -$2.65, Hill 50 ! s report
allowed a 9 cent gain to 29 cents, and Commonwealth Mining
Investments, at $2.60, added* 25 cents. Good industrials are
broadly sought, for mostly unspectacular rises.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Well-priced Dunlop Rubber
TWO years have elapsed since Dun-
lop Rubber Australia Limited’s
last issue to shareholders and dur-
ing this period the share price has been
halved. Certainly the price has re-
covered a little in the past two or three
months and seems to be steady at about
$1.20, to show an immediate dividend
yield of 6.7 percent. However, the divi-
dend of 8 cents per share is only just
covered by earnings of 8.9 cents per
share, so the price/earnings multiple is
a fairly high 13.5.
From 1959 to 1963, the price/earn-
ings multiple on the basis of the mid-
price between the high and low for the
year was well below this figure. It is,
therefore, possible to suggest that the
fall in the price of Dunlop’s shares is
due solely to a fall in earnings per share.
There do seem to be some other
factors at work which may be exercising
the minds of investors, but in general
these could well be the cause of the
decline in earnings. The question is,
“Can we see the effect of these factors
before the fall or rise in per share
earnings occurs?” When writing about
Dunlop in September, 1962, I suggested
that Dunlop should be priced at $1.92
“in view of the high level of competition
that is likely to be experienced in the
future, particularly in motor vehicle
tyres and floorcoverings.” It is all very
well to see that competition is about to
develop; it is quite another matter to
guess the effect on per share earnings
of the major companies concerned.
The approximate equivalent price
today of those shares of September,
1962, after a one-for-four bonus issue
and a one-for-three rights issue at par,
would be about $1.40 per share, or
nearly 17 percent more than the current
price. Personally, I think that the guess-
work was not too far off, because I
have some difficulty in believing that
any greater accuracy is possible.
there are a few other factors
that tend to give me some concern.
In recent days two rather surprising
acquisitions have been announced.
Firstly, Dunlop has acquired a con-
trolling interest in Frank O’Neill (not
a majority holding since it is less than
50 percent, but a controlling interest
nevertheless) and also Paramouht
Shirts. Although there may well be
some link between Dunlop’s previous
interests and swimming-pools and shirts,
it is rather difficult for an outsider to
see them without some help from the
board or senior company executives.
One is tempted to think that Dunlop is
merely scouting around for some sort
of investment to mop up the funds
which are becoming available as the
original business of making and selling
motor vehicle tyres, etc., starts to run
down.
It may well be that Dunlop’s manage-
ment skills can add more profit to the
relatively small companies which have
been acquired, but I think that the
investors in public company shares are
still waiting for the first success story
in this particular area. As with a diversi-
fied investment portfolio it seems to be
very difficult to get “super” profits out
of a diversified business.
When pre-tax profits are expressed as
a percentage of group sales the follow-
ing trend emerges:
Year to
June 30 1959 1960'1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
100 85 77 85 _ B7 96 83 57
Looking at the period from 1961 to
1964, one could easily have detected a
sustained upward trend in the ratio of
profit to sales; it is now apparent that
this upward trend was merely a
recovery and not a change in the general
direction of Dunlop’s profitability. This
leads to the problem that must beset
every analyst: “How does one dis-
tinguish between a genuine growth rate
and a ‘recovery’ rate of growth?” In
retrospect, it is fairly easy to say that
Dunlop was merely recovering, but, at
the same time, the growth that was
taking place in the automobile industry
made one think that the problems of
competition had been overcome and
everybody would benefit from now on.
As it subsequently turned out, competi-
tion started to develop as soon as there
was the slightest recession in the auto-
motive equipment industry, and Dunlop
seems to have been just as susceptible
as the others.
The trends in various profit ratios
seem to be rather less steady than the
trend in profit to sales.

Earnings to:
Capital 100 87 73 90 106 93 75 46
Funds 100 88 69 87 88 87 75 50
The trends in total sales, ordinary-
capital, and shareholders’ funds have
been as follows:
Year to
June 30 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Sales 100 112 115 125 142 "Tio ~170 ' 173

Shi! reholders’
funds 100 106 115 119 127 158 196 197
These figures show that, although
sales growth has been at the rate of
about 8 percent per annum compound
on average over the past seven years,
equity capital and funds have grown at
a faster rate.
Clearly, the effect of falling margins
and capital expanding at a greater rate
than sales has been to produce a declin-
ing per share earnings, even after
adjustment has been made for the
effect of the “bonus” content of rights
issues on favorable terms relative to the-
market share price at the time.

earnings 100 88 73 91 106 107 95 63
Dividends 100 107 107 107 107 153 138 145
Dividends have also been affected
since in 1965 the company reverted to
the 8 percent rate after a period of 11
years at the higher rates ranging from
to 10 percent.
At this particular stage there is no
indication that the competition in the
main field of activity is decreasing—in
fact, the reverse seems to be the case.
Further diversification into small and
apparently unrelated activities is un-
likely to form any worthwhile cushion
against such competition. As I see it,
Dunlop’s shares are still well priced,
since they are selling at 13| times
1965/66 earnings, which are after a low-
tax provision.

Chess Bulletin
SVETOZAR GLIGORIC
CVEIOZAR GLIGORIC, Yugoslav
Grandmaster, has won the West
European Zonal tournament with 121
points out of 16. His score comprised
9 wins, 7 draws, and no losses. Runner-
up, Hungarian Grandmaster Bilek,
also had a loss-free score of 12, consist-
ing of 8 wins and 8 draws. Kavalek,
of Czechoslovakia, was another half-
point away in third position.
The first nine placegetters were as
follows:
First Gligoric 121, second Bilek 12,
third Kavalek 111, fourth and fifth
Conner (Holland), and Velimirovic
(Yugoslavia) 11, sixth Pfleger (West
Germany) 10, seventh Tringov (Bul-
garia) 91, eighth Diez del Corral
(Spain) 9, ninth Peter Lee (England)
81.
Gligoric’s most recent successes were
the 1985 Championship of Yugoslavia
(for the 11th time) and at Natanya
this year. He has, no doubt, fond mem-
ories of 1961 and 1982, when he
journeyed to England and won the
Hastings Premier tournament on tooth
occasions without the loss of a game.
Here is his game against Tringov
from the Zonal tournament referred
to above.
White: Gligoric. Black: Tringov.
Opening: King’s Indian.

10. Q-Q2,
A necessary precaution. 10 . . . P-Q4
is threatened and Gligoric must pro-
tect his Bishop so that he can answer
KPxP
10 . . . P-Q4; 11. KPxP, PxP; 12.
O-O, N-B3;
So far the game has followed those
of Gligoric-Fischer, Stockholm, 1962,
and Reshevsky-Gligoric, Los Angeles,
1963. In those games Black played 12
. . . PxP; 13. QR-Ql, P-QR 3; 14.
BxP, P-QN4; 15. B-N3, B-N2 with an
even game. Both games resulted in a
draw and playing to the score this did
not suit Tringov, so he altered course.
13. P-85, B-Q2; 14. QR-Ql, Q-K2;
15. B-82,
Whether he likes it or not, Black
must accept the sacrifice of the pawn
as Gligoric threatens to post his Knight
at Q 6.
15 . . . QxP; 16. N-K6, Q-Q3; 17.
Nxß, KxN; 18. N-N5, Q-K4; 19. KR-
KJ, P-QR 3; 20. B-81. Q-R4; 21. N-Q4,
P-R3; 22. NxN, BxN;
22 . . . PxN; leaves a lot to toe de-
sired. It further hampers the mobility
of Black’s Bishop and badly weakens
his Q-side.
23. B-Q4, R-K3; 24. RxR, PxR; 25.
R-Kl, R-Kl; 26. R-K5,
Black now has real problems. Al-
though in severe time trouble, his next
move will not require much thought.
26 . . . P-KN 4; 27. P-84. K-Nl; 28.
B-K2, Q-N3; 29. B-Q3, N-K5; 30. BxN,
Pxß; 31. PxP, R-Ql; 32. Q-K3,
White still has to be cautious. If
32. PxP, P-K6!; and then if 33. RxP
(e 3), Rxß; and Elack wins. Certainly
not 33. QxP???.
32 . . . P-KR4; 33. P-KR3, R-Q4;
With his other pieces so restricted,
this forced swopping of Rooks seems
ill-advised. After the game, Gligoric
said he thought 33 . . . K-R2 was much
better.
34. RxR, BxR;
An unpleasant choice of two evils.
In recapturing with the pawn, Black
improves his pawn structure but shuts
out his Bishop.
35. Q-84, Q-B2; 36. Q-K5, K-R2?;
Tringov signs his own death war-
rant. 26 . . . Q-N3 offered better
chances
37. Q-RBch. K-N3; 38. Q-R6ch, K-B4;
39. P-N6, QxP; 40. Q-BBch, K-N4; 41.
B-K3ch, resigns.
Black cannot escape. 41 . . . K-R5;
42. Q-B2ch, Q-N6; 43. Q-B6ch, Q-N4;
44. B-B2 mate.
PROBLEM No. 3.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Cracking down on Brazil Nuts
SOMEHOW or other, through thick and thin, share investment still manages to
retain its respectability. Consequently, when some irregularity does occur in
the investment world, it generally takes my fancy.
This week I had to go as far afield
as Brazil. Apparently the troops there
have such diverse occupations as the
closing down of investment trusts. The
one in question was the Fund of Funds,
whose 650 subscribers suddenly found
their names published in the local
papers. A further shock followed when
these investors were confronted by the
local tax authorities.
To police our securities industry we
don’t employ anything as spectacular
as troops or as efficient as the American
Securities and Exchange Commission.
But there is the Australian Share-
holders’ Association and it is making
a useful contribution in improving the
standing of the most important group
of persons in the industry the inves-
tors. Formed only a few years ago,
there are now 1100 members in the
N.S.W. branch. Members of the Asso-
ciation have a habit of popping up at
company meetings, often causing reluc-
tant chairmen to disclose matters that
shareholders have an inherent but often
neglected right to know. The Asso-
ciation also presses for more informa-
tive company statements.
Returning to the more specific sub-
ject of “What’s good buying?” (a
phrase that has lost its ring in the
past two years), I settled on two quite
unrelated companies that have one
thing in common their market price.
The last sale price of both Tulloch and
Fire Fighting was 56 cents.
Fire Fighting was in the portfolio
earlier in the year. At that time the
company was moving ahead under full
steam and it seemed likely that the
dividend rate would be increased to
10 percent. Apparently, however, the
effect of the drought cut heavily into
the trading figures in the last two
months of the financial year. As a
result, total profits for the year were
only just above the previous year.
A disappointed market sliced the shares
back to 50 cents. The shares have since
managed to recover a few cents.
QN the score alone of the breaking of
the drought and the subsequent im-
provement in country trading, the
shares seem worth buying. But also in
favor of the company is the successful
absorption of Moffat Virtue into the
group and the steady performance of
the other two major divisions of the
company (fire protection and engineer-
ing).
To the man in the street, especially
if he is a rail commuter, Tulloch is a
more familiar name than Fire Fighting.
Like Fire Fighting, Tulloch has also
been in the portfolio this year. This
time, however, I’m plumping for the
shares rather than the options.
The backbone of Tulloch is its roll-
ing stock production. Double-deck
suburban carriages, goods wagons of
all sorts, bogies and even a few loco-
motives are all constructed at the
Rhodes factory. In addition, Tulloch
operates its own foundry and has both
a building and general engineering
division.
This sober description of the com-
pany’s activities gives no clue to the
almost disastrous collapse in 1960, and
the slow but ultimately successful
rehabilitation in the intervening years.
For the first time since 1960, a five
percent dividend was paid in November.
Now that the recovery phase has been
completed, there seems no reason why
the company should not enter a stage
of new growth. If it does, there is
plenty of room for the share price to
move up.
On the sales side, Peko Wallsend
has been given its marching orders. If
increased production from its own
mines and a higher dividend from
the 50 percent owned Rutile and Zircon
Mines Ltd. have no favorable effect on
the share price, then what would? A
small loss of $lO was incurred.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
500 Fire Fighting, 56 cents .. .. $287
500 Tulloch, 56 cents $287
SOLD
2GO Peko Wallsend, $2.10 .. .. $412
The account goes $lO5 into debit.
The portfolio now consists of:

It takes
5 seconds
(and two fingers)
*v
to change type faces on the
IBM 72 electric typewriter
Now you can make important points look
important with changeable type styles.
You can use one type style for paragraph
headings, another for text. Or you can
use one type style for personal letters,
another for business correspondence.
This has never before been possible on
the same typewriter.
To change the type style, just change
the typeball. Slip off one typeball, click
the other on. It’s as easy as putting a
cap on a bottle.
Want to emphasise a paragraph head-
ing with a different colour? (There are
nine to choose from.) Just snap in a new
ribbon cartridge with one hand. It’s
sealed in a convenient plastic container.
Your fingers never touch ink.
Call IBM for a demonstration of the
most dramatic advance in typing since
the invention of the typewriter itself.
The world's fastest
typewriter and
the easiest to use.
