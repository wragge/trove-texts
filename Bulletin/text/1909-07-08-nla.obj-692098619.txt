THE RED PAGE
Education
I7IFFICIENCY” is the watchword
_jj of democracy. The institutions
and machinery of the State need
frequent inspection and repair, and new
institutions are required to meet new
occasions. In no department is efficiency
so necessary as in that of education; for
upon the skill of the unit everything
else depends; and in Australia universal
military training and sound technical
education are the necessary complements
of the All White policy. Australia
should train her sons so that they may be
able to resist the foreign foe in military
and industrial warfare. The industrial
fight is getting keener every day, and in
other countries technical education is
advancing with rapid strides to provide
efficient privates and captains of in-
dustry. A brief account of the methods
in force elsewhere, and a full history of
what has been done and left undone here
are given in A Quarter Century of Technical
Education in N.S.W., by J. W. Turner
(Government Printer, Sydney). Tech-
nical education is in its infancy in this
State. “Like our thoroughfares, which
have followed mainly the tracks of
the bullock drays of the early
settlers, technical education has de-
veloped haphazardly.” During the last
few years, however, the progress has been
considerable. In 1908, 18,490 technical
students were enrolled. Of these, 7320
are at the central college in Ultimo.
Unfortunately, there are practically no
Continuation schools to supplement the
public schools, nor Trade schools to deal
with apprentices who require a brief
course of training in specific trades.
The Ultimo College tries to fill their
place and do its own work, and is conse-
quently overcrowded.
The superintendent makes a strong
appeal for institutions to fill the gap
between the public schools and a proper
technical college. He says indignantly :
An intelligent observer of educational de-
velopment in other countries could not
possibly conceive a British, or an American
or a German city, with a population on the
progressive high-road towards 600,000 in-
habitants, containing no State Commercial
School, no Technical High School, and with
but one or two Continuation and Trade
Schools. Yet such is the woeful condition of
the Capital of New South Wales education-
ally. -
W
A large amount of money is required
to effect improvements and provide ade-
quate equipment in Sydney ; and there
is urgent need of extension into the
country. Of course, the Government is
the only hope, for private citizens with
coin do not part freely for national pur-
poses. The Report pathetically mentions
that there has not been a single bequest
or donation to the Technical College. It
is not entirely a dependent institution,
as last year it received over in
fees; but the expenses must always be
much greater than the income.
There are indications that the Gov-
ernment is waking up to the importance
of technical education, and this excellent
Report will bring the matter vividly
before a wider circle .
The Dept, of Public Instruction is
trying to catch up to the times, but the
University moves with the ponderous
solemnity of an Antarctic glacier—an inch or
so in a decade. Its libraries and museums
are closed in the evening. Its fees make it
inaccessible to a large number of youths. Its
tone is English and conservative. It is not
expected that it should work like a Cliapman-
Alexander Mission to spread what' light it has
got, but it ought to be closer to the people,
and have a much more vital influence upon our
public life. There is plenty of latent talent
which does not get much encouragement
from Alma Mater. Graduates from our
universities do well abroad ; but they have no
chance of a local professorship. Reading books
for the public schools have been compiled
and printed here, and a number of annotated
editions of classical and other authors, scien-
tific handbooks, etc., have been produced
here; but the University does not favor
such things. A few years ago McMillans
published a selection of English poetry, From
Blake to Arnold, with critical essays and
introduction by C. J. Brennan, of Sydney.
In our opinion it is a better book than some
of those set for public examinations. It is
used in England, but is ignored in N.S.W.
Nevertheless, the University does move.
Australian history, as a disreputable rascal,
was excluded from the sacred precincts until
this year. The growing reform party will
soon be able to accelerate the pace, and
apply the policy, adopted literally in con-
nection with the public parks, of pulling
down the railings and turning on the light.
A book to be commended is Victorian Hill
and Dale (Lothian), by T. S. Hall, lecturer
in biology at Melbourne University. Geo-
logical and other information is imparted in
a series of. personally-conducted tours round
about Melbourne, Bendigo, Geelong, etc.
N.S.W. has Curran’s handbook and Pro-
fessor David, so that geology is safe in this
State ; but we think that little books on the
geology of the other States, if written in the
simple style of Hall, would do much to
widen interest in the science.
Prof. W. A. Osborne’s Elements of Animal
Physiology (Lothian) seems, to a layman, a
useful book for schools and stock breeders.
The Melbourne professor writes with know-
ledge and enthusiasm, and the book is
amply illustrated.
Ludwig Hopf’s recent work on The Human
Species, now done into English, is an elabo-
rate 'comparison of man with the other
animals. Merely as a collection of interest-
ing facts about the ancestry, bodily structure,
diseases, psychology and social customs of
man and the fraternity at the Zoo, the book
makes good reading. Though scientific and
from the German, the style is not heavy ;
and even the casual reader would find much
to interest him in this comparative study of
himself. The introductory chapter sum-
marises the primitive beliefs about man’s
origin, and mentions that the ape theory was
widespread amongst savage races. The
Madagascar people believed that the first
man always existed, and, becoming afflicted
with an abscess on the left leg, woman
emerged. This is more discourteous than the
rib theory. (Copy from G. Robertson & Co.)
Shakespeare or-
“ Shakespeare ” is a stock subject for the
book-maker, and appears more frequently in
the magazines than “Trouble in the Bal-
kans.” Any person who has read a little
and can write a little, needs only to select a
heading, and the rest is easy. The headings
run in sets :
The argot of S.
The bullies .
The caligraphy ■.
Was S. an Anabaptist ?
— a Bimetallist ?
—* — a chiropodist ?
a woman ?
Bid S. smoke ?
■ steal ?
have smallpox ?
S. and the musical glasses.
— l Abracadabra.
And so on, to n—l.
Whether Shakespeare was written by S.,
or by somebody else of the same name, or by
Bacon, or Ben Jonson, doesn’t matter much
to the real authors—the Elizabethan
Literary Syndicate, as they and their heirs
are all dead ; but it is/ a matter over which
a host of moderns foam and boil and
brandish sabres in print.
After Mark Twain retired from business
and wandered after Joan of Arc and Mrs.
Eddy, it is not surprising that he should
drop into the Shake-Bacon dispute. Is
Shakespeare Dead????(per RoycroftLibrary)
is a section of his autobiography. (If- there
are many digressions like this, the line o
his story will be more irregular than Tristrau
Shandy s.) Mark is very serious, and goef.
over the evidence brilliantly. He co ues to
the c mclusion that William of Stratford
son of the butcher, is really a Brontosaur-
nine bones and six hundred barrels of plaster
of pans. His one poem, his only poem, is
the epitaph :
Good friend for lesus sake forbeare
To digg the dust encloased heare,:
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones
And curst be he yt moves my bones.
—and he was probably dead when he wrote
it. “Still, this is only conjecture. We
have only circumstantial evidence. Internal
evidence.”
Shakespeare being disposed of, we may
look forward without excitement to M.
Raphael Symptor’s “ Jeanne d’Arc n’a jamais
existe,” which was announced in June. It
is stated in the Athenceum that the author
has spent several years in gathering evidence
to prove that there never was no sich person
as the Maid of Orleans. Meanwhile Anatole
Fiance and Andrew Lang are lighting over
her character. And Lang is the persifleur
who identified Gladstone with the sun myth !
A distinguished Sydney graduate is pre-
paring a bomb which will blow the bottom
out of the centuries-old presumption that
AEschylus wrote Prometheus Vinctus ; and
Melbourne possesses a citizen named Janies
Smith who claims to have discovered the
veritable author of The Letters of Junius.
Mr. Smith has published one book, and
threatens another to prove that the Letters
were written by Edward Gibbon. It would
be hard to find a deader subject than’Junius.
The Tichborne claimant, the Man in the
Iron Mask, and the First Discoverer of
America are comparatively fresh and lively.
authorship is, or was, a mystery ;
and the adventurous, uncompromising
spirit of the twentieth century will not
allow any mystqjhes to remain. The
extraordinary pains taken by the authors of
Shakespeare and Junius to tie up their
secrets only whets the appetite of the inqui-
sitive disentanglers. Isis has already been
very much unveiled. Myths are being ex-
ploded every day. The old beliefs and the
old philosophies are in the last ditch, and
history is riddled through and through. As
for literary reputations—quite a number of
standard authors are now mentioned amongst
The Hundred Worst Books; but it may yet
be proved that they did not really write them.
At present we hold fast to the belief that
Daley was the author of “The Sunset
Fantasy,” and that Lawson wrote “When
Tour Pants Begin to Go ’’—but no doubt this
also shall pass away.
J. S. Ryan, a verse writer known to Aus-
tralian newspaper readers as “ Narranghi
Boori,” promises to come up shortly
with his little lot in a book to be called
The Splinters on the Wall, and Other Verses.
It is to be illustrated by Lindsay, Leist and
others.
In Chambers’s Journal for June, Will H.
Ogilvie looks back upon the Australian Bush,
and sees that a good deal of it was un-
pleasant. He says that the bushmau’s
prowess in the saddle has been much
exaggerated ; but so has the bushman’s
drunkenness, and his heroism, stamina and
endurance were magnificent. “Of the Bush
itself ... is it beautiful, witching, caress-
ing, as its poets sing ; or fierce, cruel, repel-
lent, as its enemies allege ? Th 6 writer is
fain to confess that, even after many years,
these questions, so far as he is concerned,
are still unanswered.” From the poet who
wrote “ The Bush My Lover,” and the rest,
this is disappointing.
An Invasion
Betieath the faded broWn-and-yellow cover-
let the old man’s body lay so straight and
still he scarcely seemed to breathe. Above
his head the long, thin fringes of the lighter-
colored valance hung in a half-moon, stirred
by no breath of air : the fine gold threads
twisted amongst them hardly gleamed.
Within the broad bed curtains’ heavy shadow,
surrounded with a glimmer of grey silver,
the hollow ' features made a color of
yellow grey. His arms lay straight along
his sides, and over the coverlet Ins long light
beard flowed in a thin wave. The room was
large and dim, filled with a dry, cool silence
that was like a weightit seemed withdrawn
from sight and sound without, a resting-
place for time, incapable of change and self-
contained. Against the bed-foot stood a
large French window with its green blind
drawn, and through the slats filtered the
ghost of a warm afternoon, so faded and
refined that its light discovered little clearly
about the shadowy walls. To the right of
the bedside a mantelpiece of old discolored
marble stood, which, like the china vases
that it carried, and the faded engravings of
forgotten pictures hanging here and there,
left no particular impression upon the eye,
all blending with the dimness and the silence
in a low, not inharmonious, tone. Opposite
the mantelpiece, and just across the bed-
foot, stood a door, but it was closed.
The intense silence grew profounder yet,
speaking, almost with voices, of some tre-
mendous and approaching change.
Dry silk rustled ; a chair creaked. A
sharp click' sounded, as if a pencil were laid
down sharply upon a table-top ; there was a
thick breath, like a sigh. To the left of the
bed a woman’s broad, round back bent over
a writing-table against the wall. Her dress
was hard, black silk that crinkled when she
moved. Her head was bowed over an
account book ; her ears were large and thick
and rather shapeless, and from them
small jet ear-rings swung. The skin of her
face and neck was wrinkled and dull-
colored the folds and, lines upon it, small
signs of petty cares, were many but vague.
Her wrists were bony and thick ; her shoes
beneath the chair showed broad, splaw soles
and broad, down-trodden heels. She made no
sound, but calculated in a thoughtful
silence, one hand upon the table near the
pencil that she had just now laid down; a
finger of the other touched her lips, that
slightly moved.
“Sixpence three farthings a pound,” she
muttered. “Not very much ; nine and six-
pence three farthings the flitch.” She mur-
mured in the silence like a bee, and drifted
into thought.
The dull brown-yellow coverlet stirred
softly, as the old man drew a longer breath
and slightly moved one arm. The gesture
and the soft, low sound sefemed out of place
where all had been so still, and when they
ceased' the atmosphere grew tense again.
Silence increased about the room, settling
softly yet inevitably, like a fine, grey dust.
Without, the warm, dry, eucalyptus-
scented afternoon glared on the level street,
flashed on the scattered iron roofs of com-
monplace suburban cottages, filtered through
dusty leaves of casual trees, and on the
ground beneath dropped brilliant blots of
light. From opposite this larger house of
stone, out of a patch of vacant land
sprinkled with trees, voices of locusts
rose in a level monotone, that dying while a
single insect droned and ceased and droned,
grew up once more until it reached the back-
ground of the'brain, and sank beneath the
surface of consciousness, not to be evident
until again withdrawn. Far away some
railway engine whistled as a train roared by.
Steps sounded on the footpath ndar ; there
was a rat-tat and a cry of “Post,” and
children’s voices from next door, that rose
and died. The footsteps faded like the
sound of the passing train ; the locusts were
forgotten ; every sound was gone. The
growing influence about the room had over-
spread its boundaries, subduing imper-
ceptibly even the murmurous brilliance of
the outside afternoon.
“The market’s down again,” the woman
muttered querulously. .“ It was sevenpence
last month and ever so long. It should be
sevenpence. They’re always changing.”
She calculated, and her lips still moved.
They closed.
It was as though her voice, the only sign
of vigorous individual energy within the
room, had been a hardly-suffered interrup-
tion. As it had suddenly broken the volume
of that overflowing intense stillness, so now
it vanished abruptly, as if cut off. The heavy
walls of parted silence met together again
without a sign, like walls of water when a
keel is lifted out, but with the impression of
inevitable quiet force. A door jarred open
in some house near by ; a stray dog howled,
cast out, and yelping shrilly, pattered on
three legs along the dusty street.' It rushed
upon the verandah with a scurry of fright-
ened feet, and sniffed, between its yelps, at
the green blind. Sniffing and yelping sud-
denly ceased, and with light pads it slunk
away, almost unheard.
“That’s fourpence halfpenny difference
on the flitch,” the woman muttered again. . .
“ That nurse is always gadding about some-
where. Headache, indeed ! No wonder,
with all she eats. Fresh air, indeed ! It’s
fresh enough in here.” She glanced round
at the bed. “He looks about the same. .. .
Fourpence farthing ; it’s not much. . . . Her
job won’t last long now. .. . The market
should be up by rights, and then there would
be nothing to give bfick. I bought a day too
early, or it would have been up. And then
there’s sixpence farthing on the eggs, and
butter sevenpence halfpenny. That’s one-
and-six. The nurse eats like a pig, or there’d
be more. Just sitting round and feeding
him sometimes. ...”
The old man’s face was yellow grey, like
wax. His lips had parted slightly ; only the
faintest rise and fall beneath the coverlet
still showed he breathed. It may be that
the afternoon was old, but the shadows in
the room seemed darker now, the lighter
parts more dim ; the little life and freshness
still remaining seemed visibly to fade, grow
vacant and cold, as though before the ap-
proaching boundary of some irresistible slow
invasion, now at hand. The walls stood
solid, yet they opposed no bar ; the blind
was drawn, it only shut out light. Patience
inscrutable, power in a great wave, gathered
without and surged up silently. Out of the
curtains’ shadow at the bed-head the pale
flesh and thin silver very faintly gleamed.
Now the door opened, softly, silently, a
finger’s-breadth, letting in a little drift of
air. The bedclothes shuddered, the valance
fringes shivered, and were quiet. The door
closed softly to again. Breathing had ceased,
the old man’s jaw had dropped.
“ Eighteen pence! ” the woman murmured.
“ Besides, there’s half the flitch.”

MAGNESIA,

THE LIVER BLAMED.
Sincerity of conviction and directness of pur-
pose mark the action of Mr. Thomas Theak in
giving for publication the ensuing lines, which
were written at his home, No. 88 Botany Road,
Alexandria.
“I am one of the few people living in Sydney
who has never been out of it,” was Mr. Theak’s
initial remark, ‘‘not that it is anything to boast
about, but purely an uncommon circumstance.”
“Your business does not conduce to much
travelling, perhaps?” said the interviewer.
“I’m a painter by trade, and there has been
plenty of work to keep me here, without wasting
time looking for it in other parts. Yes ; I have
done fairly well from a business standpoint, but
from a health point of view I was not always so
fortunate. Let me give you, for example, the
time that I found it necessary to start taking
medicine, and I must have been pretty bad to
take that on, I tell you. It was because I was
much weaker than 1 should have been, conse-
quent, I firmly believe, on working too hard. I
had the unpleasant experience of never being able
to relish my food, no matter how daintily pre-
pared, for my appetite had fallen away to nothing.
I was also troubled with most uncomfortable feel-
ings, following upon the taking of foods, the
stomach filling with gases, and causing pain, be-
sides being oppressed with a dreariness of mind
which made it too much trouble to devote my
thoughts to anything. I felt fit for nothing but
to go and lie down after meals, and a person in a
healthy state should not be like that, you know.”
“That condition is a sure indication that some-
thing has gone wrong with the liver?”
“Precisely; and that’s what I was suffering
from. I went on ailing for a good length of time,
going from bad to worse, and wondering what on
earth would cure me and make my life a bit more
bearable, rvhen a son of mine who had been using
Clements Tonic advised me to try some. Well,
that was the best introduction I have ever had,
because Clements Tonic has been a firm friend of
mine ever since. But before I get too far ahead
of mv story, let me tell you of the way I suffered
trout neadaches —so heavy and acute that I could
c
K
Q
EESSkPKO
scarcely raise my head from the pillow, and mak-
ing me wish that I could leave this earth and all
its misery behind. A coated tongue and a vile
taste in the mouth started the day’s round of dis-
agreeable circumstances, and my sight got so dim
as to lead me to think that a skin was growing
over them. Then the giddy feelings—why, some-
times I almost dropped, through their sudden
visits, and my shoulders were so affected with
pain that it hurt me to move. Indeed, on one
occasion I was for a whole week and could not
raise my arms. The chest and stomach were also
out of gear, and on top of it all I was listless and
low-spirited to a marked degree. Each morning 1
got up feeling that I did not care what happened,
always being more inclined to go back to bed
again than to dress myself. There was sufficient
evidence to show that my nervous system was feel-
ing the strain of my physical adversities, so you
will see there was a big contract in front of Clem-
ents Tonic when I made my first purchase of that
valuable remedy. But I found it very, much up-
to-date, believe me. There was no taking of half-
a-dozen bottles, and feeling no better, as applies
to other medicines. Oh ! no; neither do I say that
I felt all right after taking one bottle of Clements
Tonic ; yet I can truthfully assert that I felt some-
what relieved, and that by judiciously sticking to
that treatment I conquered in the end. Yes,
Clements Tonic gained a complete mastery over
each of my ailments, and left me in the happy
position of being able to eat and drink whatever
I liked, without experiencing any ill effects after-
wards. Its power over the nerves is extraordi-
nary, its appetising influences are unique, its value
as a promoter of sleep is unrivalled, and for curing
indigestion and building up one’s strength I’m
positive there is nothing to come within coo-ee of
Clements Tonic.”
“Well, we’ll print your remarks ? ”
“Do—in any form you like to mention, or de-
cide upon.”

The fact that letters of this kind

Played-Out.
Yarning like little men
They sat upon the green,
Two played-out rakes of ten,
A roue of thirteen.
They long had lost the fair
Illusions known to youth ;
Around them everywhere
Was hard and squalid truth.
They knew (why should they not
With such sharp eyes to see?)
That life was not quite what
It was cracked up to be.
They felt the Scarceness sad
That most of us deplore ;
Three cigarettes they had
Among them ; nothing more.
Three cigarettes to clutch
And smoke, by fits and starts—
Sure they were not too much
To comfort three sad hearts !
Then spake the Eldest One,
With fur upon his tongue :
“The doctor says I’m done —
I’m spittin’ up me lung.
“ I didn’t ort to die
So soon, it seems to me ;
But, Gawd—l don’t know why—
There ain’t much left to see.
“I’ve seen the Pantermime
Gyints and fyries pale ;
’N’ I have done me time—
A month it was—in gaol.
“I ain’t had too much luck—
Not luck enough to talk
About. I got the chuck
Ez soon ez I could walk.
“ I’ve had to doss around—
You coves will find out, too.
How cold can be the ground
When you a doss must do.
“ There ain’t much fun, I say,
In dossin’ round ; you bet
I’ve had me bloomin’ day—
Gimme a cigarette !”
With tears their eyes did fill—
The two small rakes of Hell-
Says they, “Oh, poor old Bill—
’Ere’s our two stumps as well ! ’’
CREEVE ROE.
The One Man More.
I know a score of men whose years
Are spent in piling heaps of gold ;
They have no heart for joy or tears,
And all their hours are bought and sold.
Lean-jawed, keen-eyed, they haunt the street.
Like prowling brutes alert for prey ;
They have no uses for the sweet
Delights of night or charms of day.
They lie, and laugh to see how well
Their lie has worked; and care for naught
But that which they may buy or sell
And turn to profit—sold or bought.
I half believe the wolf survives
In their predacious souls—that back,
In other scenes and other lives,
They hunted in a ravening pack.
They lift their nostrils as of old
(Keen nostrils wide agape with greed),
And stretch their hungry lengths in bold
Pursuit of wealth beyond their need.
The hunt goes on from gold to grey ;
From dawn tilt Sunset lights the west
They follow fast upon their prey,
With snapping jaws and avid breast.
The priz.e is to the strong of limb,
The weak are trampled underneath ;
The victors stand alert and grim
Above their prey and bare their teeth.
I know a score of men whose lives
Are such and nothing more nor less,
In whom the ancient wolf survives,
Whose god and gospel is success.
No doubt the grey wolf sleeps at times ;
No doubt they have their fireside hours ;
And, when eyes shine or laughter chimes,
A certain love of song and flowers.
But that is when the hunting’s done,
And self has played its sordid part;
Yet, since all lives are linked in one,
The world demands a kindly heart.
I know these men and one man more,
And tha,t man more is worth them all ;
His heart is like an open door,
His soul is as a banquet-hall.
Tired men there be who knock and knock
At many gates, and knock in vain ;
No welcome rattles back the lock.
And gives them shelter from the rain.
But he is not so fast asleep,
And neither is the hour so late,
But that he hears the feet that creep,
The hands that knock upon his gate.
He lights his lamp and quits his couch,
And in the middle night lets in
A broken man whose shoulders crouch,
An outcast dark with shame and sin.
Ah yes, what counts when winds are cold
And hearts are aching, spirits sore,
Is not the wolf-men hunting gold,
But Fellowship and One Man More.

THE YASSBERRA CRIME, FRAUD AND
SWINDLE.
The printed official report of the Advisory Board
which was appointed to wander over the Yass-
Canberra area and pick out the best possible site
for a Federal capital is now to hand, and a study
of it shows that the newspaper summaries alluded
to last week were in some respects a trifle in-
accurate. These summaries made things look
bad, and it is difficult to say if the official printed
report doesn’t make thing's look worse. The
following are the leading features of the report
There is a supply of perennially clear and pure water in
the Cotter River. The catchment area of this river,
above the point at which the gauge readings for 1908 were
taken, embraces an area of about 170 square miles.
According to the 1908 records, the supply at the point of
gauging is sufficient for the domestic and civic re-
quirements of a population of 250,000 ; the total volume
from the catchment area of 170 square miles would he
available, however, only by pumping.
It is practicable to supply water by gravitation from
the upper 100 square miles of this catchment to service
reservoirs at the city. Such a scheme would involve
LARGE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE, EVEN FOR THE INITIAL POPU-
LATION.
For water supply only—apart from power—a pumping
scheme with conservation works, designed for extension
in course of time, presents advantages over a gravitation
scheme. To accept the Cotter River as the source of
power (in addition to supply) involves carrying outof part
of the engineering works for the gravitation scheme. To
meet the combined demands the full development of the
Cotterjwould (so far as available data indicates during
years of low rainfall, such as 1908) PROVIDE FOR A
POPULATION OF 50,000, A SUFFICIENT WATER
SUPPLY FOR DOMESTIC AND CIVIC PURPOSES-
FOR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION OF ENERGY FOR
LIGHTING, AND FOR CITY POWER AND STREET
TRAMWAYS ; but from the information available it
cannot be determined whether or not a scheme combining
a gravitation water supply and a power installation could
be laid down at a cost that would be economical. In
view, however, of the maximum consumption during
drought, combined with the minimum flow during suc-
cessive years of low rainfall, IT CANNOT BE
\NTICIPATED WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE
COTTER SUPPLY WOULD MEET THE DEMANDS
FOR THE ABOVE COMBINED PURPOSES FOR A
OREATER POPULATION THAN 50,000, AND FOR
MANUFACTURING PURPOSES OF ANY MAGNITUDE,
SHOULD SUCH EVER BE PROPOSED WITHIN THE
TERRITORY.
There are, however, other sources of water supply for
power in the territory, namely, the Molonglo and Quean-
beyan Rivers combined The total catchment is about
500 square miles, and, in conjunction with developed
conservation, the combined flow of these rivers, taken off
from the weir below the city area and carried to a site for
generating', would provide considerable power. The
character of the country points to the practicability op
SUCH A SCHEME, BUT THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT INFORMATION
AVAILABLE UPON WHICH TO ESTIMATE THE COST. It will be a
question for prolonged gauging and still further investi-
gation to ascertain the possibilities in this respect.
There is space for a considerable amount of
thought in these statements. The principal points
seem to be these :
(1) For a primitive sort of city which only wanted water
for drinking and washing, the famous Cotter Creek (it
was never called a river, even by the oldest local inhabi-
tant, till the Congested Population Party started to boom
the locality as a site for an Australian capit d) is sufficient
to supply 250,000 people. That estimate is based on the
supply during 1908, which was really a fairly good year,
seeing' that the N.S.VV. wheat crop was then 9,155,884
bushels. In a really dry year like 1902, when the N.S. W.
wheat crop was only 1,585,097 bushels, and when even
Sydney had a water famine on hand, the chances are that
the water supply of the Cotter Trickle would drop to
about one-fourth of the amount above mentioned. But
the supply, which is alleged, in a fairly good year, to be
sufficient for the drinking and washing purposes of a
little city of 250,000 people, is largely dependent on con-
tinuous and eternal pumping. And pumping is a costly
job.
(2) In the case of an up-to-date modern capital, which
wants water for drinking and washing, for power with
which to run electric lighting and heating'apparatus, power
for electric tramways, and power for manufacturing pur-
poses, the Cotter can’t be relied upon to supply anything
larger than an obscure country town of 50,000 inhabi-
tants. And the cost of pumping is so great and indefinite
that the Advisory Board says it is uncertain whether the
water for even this handful of people could be furnished
at “ a cost that would be economical.” In other words,
it isn’t certain that the pumped water wouldn’t cost so
much as to make its use not worth while.
(3) There are two other little streams available, but as
the Cotter has always been put forward as the great
reliable source of supply, it seems probable that the
others are of inferior grade. They would, it is said,
supply “ considerable power,” but the quantity of power
which they would supply seems to be unknown—at any
rate, it isn’t mentioned. “The character of the country
points to” the idea that the Queanbeyan and Molonglo
could be made available, but that is a vague statement.
The expense of making them available is unknown—the
Advisory Board declares that “there is not sufficient
information available.” Also, “it is a question for pro-
longed gauging and still further investigation ” to decide
what the ; Queanbeyan and Molonglo are worth.
(4) But it is set forth distinctly that there are 100 square
miles of catchment area from which water could be sup-
plied without pumping (Sydney, in a more liberally-
watered district, finds nearly five times that area none too
much, and vet Sydney, with its coal supply brought along
cheaply by sea, is able to use coal for innumerable pur-
poses for which an inland city at Yassberra would want
waterpower). But even as regards this fragment of a
supply, it is expressly stated that it will involve “large
capital expenditure, even for the initial population,”
Dalgety and Canberra are at practically the
same elevation, and with practically the same
climate —that allegedly bleak and objectionable

climate which was said by the Sydney daily
papers to make Dalgety uninhabitable, but which,
apparently, doesn’t make Canberra in the least de-
gree uninhabitable. The difference between them,
so far as watersupplyis concerned, is this : Dalgety
has a mountain range towering,4oooft. above it,
and from this range there pours down an almost
illimitable store of water which can be dammed up
in the hills, and allowed to roll into the city
cheaply by its own volition. Canberra, at about
the same elevation, has no great mountain range
behind it, and such water as it possesses is, to a
great extent, below the level of the proposed site,
so that it must be pumped up to the proposed
Canberra capital at vast expense. The. pumping
up of a city’s Water supply is a large under-
taking. It means the installing of great
masses of machinery, the employment of
a small army of men to watch and run and
repair that machinery, and the running day and
night of trains loaded with expensive coal to feed
the boilers that drive the machinery, Yet with a
Federal capital at a place like Yassberra the ex-
pense is inevitable. If a Federal city is at a place
like Dalgety, 2700 ft. in the air, with a mountain
range 7000 ft. high behind it, its water supply
comes down to it cheaply and naturally. If it is
at a place like Yassberra, which is about
the same height, yet is almost at the
top of things thereabouts, the water which
comes down to it cheaply and naturally is
mostly what it can catch in its hat when the
gentle rain descends from Heaven. The rest has
to be pumped at great and eternal cost. Yet an
inland city with no immediately adjacent coal
supply—which description applies to every place
that has been suggested as a Federal capital-
wants water above all things. Water-power, if
there is enough of it, and if it is easily obtain-
able-can do everything that coal is capable of,
and do it at a mere fraction of the cost.
* * * *
The Advisory Board, which presented this
wholly depressing report re the best site for a
Federal capital which it could find in the Yass-
Canberra area, said nothing about any other
special advantages as a set-off to the shortcomings
of the water supply. It made no glowing remarks
about the scenery, or the fertility of the soil, or
about any other local features that were calcu-
lated to arouse enthusiasm. And in this matter
it is impossible to allege that inter-State animosi-
ties or jealousies are in any way responsible for
the verdict. The man who made the first report
on the various proposed Federal capital sites, and
who declared the Monaro tableland, on which
Dalgety stands, to be the best place of all,
was a N.S.W. State official from Sydney.
The four men who now declare that the
vaunted Cotter Creek can only be relied upon to
furnish water for a mere country town of 50,000
population, and can only do that at great expense
—the four men who preserve sucli a surprising
reticence about the beauty and fertility of the
country—are also N.S.W. men. Nobody from
any other State has had a voice in the matter.
It has been dealt with wholly by people from
N.S.W., and the capital that is to be crowded up
against the back door of' Sydney doesn’t seem to
appeal strongly to these’ official people from
N.S.W. *
« ■» » *
So a question naturally arises again as to how
the whole trouble came about. Apparently it -\vas
a purely local trouble. The bulk of the members
from Westralia, S.A., Queensland and Tasmania
■eem to have held that, as the capital wouldn’t be
in their States, and wasn’t likely to be anywhere
near their States, the affair had no great interest
for them. The battle for a Canberra capital was
really fought by the Sydney daily papers. Their
point of view appears to have been that a Federal
city at Dalgety must needs develop a strong in-
dependent press Of its own, for a place which the
Sydney morning papers couldn’t reach before about
2 p.ra., and the Melbourne papers before about
4 p. m. or later, would be practically outside their
range of influence. They could annex neither its
circulation nor its advertising business. But if.
the Federal capital was planted little more than
100 miles from Sydney, the Sydney morning
papers could get there in time to command the
local circulation, and to annex the business and
the profits. And the Sydney morning papers
are not in, the least bashful when reaching out for
the business and the profits. Free postage and
free special trains and such-like bonuses granted at
public expense have taught them the cadging
habit; and even now they are clamoring for a
special early morning train to Newcastle, so that
they may get there in time to annex the local
business and circulation, and strangle the only
independent provincial paper of any standing
which has so far been able to hold its own
against them. And when the Sydney dailies
announced that N.S.W. was clamoring—though
it wasn’t aware of the fact—for a Canberra
capital, and that it was the duty of every N.S.W.
politician to howl his loudest for Canberra, they
were a power. The policy of dragging every-
thing to Sydney—the Congested Population policy
—has made the Sydney press almost everything
in N.S.W., while the rest of the press is just a
little more than nothing. The Sydney press can
create public opinion by filling its columns with
letters expressive of the public clamor for any-
thing that suits its own views, and by suppressing
all correspondence to the contrary. It can make
politicians by publishing at great length the crude
views of the incapable Smith, who is on its side,
and polishing them till Smith seems a brilliant
orator ; and by merely remarking of the capable
Jones, who isn’t on its side, that he said a few words
amid laughter and interruptions. The Sydney
morning press is the only institution which stands
to gain anything out of the wretched Canberra
Federal capital to which the water supply is to bo
pumped at great and never-ending expense. If
that capital is a small, poor failure it will be of no
appreciable value to the traders of Sydney. If it
is a great and successful place, that fact will only
mean that a rival city and a rival port have been
established at Sydney’s door, to Sydney’s great
loss. If a Federal capital at Canberra is a failure
it will be no benefit to Australia to know that the
only city on earth which is the capital of a whole
continent is something between a village and a
dog-kenneL If jt is a success, Australia won’t be
specially edified by the struggle between Sydney
and the Federal port at Jervis Bay for the owner-
ship of .the shipping and commercial business of
N.S. W. Australia to-day has a chance which has
come to no other country in all the world’s known
history—the chance to create a metropolis which
will be worthy of its unique position as the
political centre of a continent where all the
people speak one language, live under one
Government, and have equal rights in the control
of public affairs. And that it should fool away
that chance in' order that two enormously rich
papers should make an extra 6d. out of the lost
dog advertisement'is a memorable disgrace. The
Bulletin doesn’t profess to believe that Dalgety
is the ideal site for an Australian, capital. It
would far rather see this country’s political centre
placed on one of the great rivers in the Northern
Territory, where it would attracts large popula-
tion to garrison the weakest part of the continent,
and the part most liable to: attack. But since it
was enacted, through the quaint and disreputable
swindle and fraud perpetrated by the N. S. W. Sta te
Legislature, that the capital must be in N.8.W.. it
is essential to have it in the. best part of N.S. W.
And Canberra, on the report of the Advisory
Board, isn’t the best part by a long way.
DEAR FOOD.
Food has “riz.” About that there is, no possible
doubt whatever. It costs the N.S.W. citizen a
lot more for his daily victual than it did in the
days before Federation and the Bill Lyne tariff.
Therefore the consumer is encouraged to write to
the Sydney morning papers expounding upon the
evils and horrors of Protection and the great ad-
vantages of Foreign-trade; and as letters on the
other side of the case can always be judiciously
suppressed, the wail and fabrication of the
Foreign-trade consumer sound fairly plausible to
the ignorant. But when it is advisable to con-
sider the great blessing and profit and advantage
that come to the producer of raw material by
reason of high food prices, that side of the case
isn’t charged to Bill Lyne’s tariff ; instead State
Premier and Freetrader Wade takes credit for
the profit, and his attitude is one of “ Alone I did
it.” Hence we get such, literature as the fol-
lowing :
“One of Wade's Victims” points out that the cost of
living is high,, and wishes to set matters right by raising
wages, a step which would eventually make the cost of
living still higher. Would it not be a better remedy to
try and reduce the cost of living? Probably the
“ Victim” and her husband are supporters of the Labor
party, without whose help the Protectionists could never
have patsed the tariff which made the cost of living so high.
If so, let her look to it that in future she and her friends
support no advocate of Protection (so-called). —Letter on
“ the Cost of Livingitiyned “ One of Deakix's Victims,”
in S. M. Herald.
I notice in vour issue of to-day a letter from a working
man’s wife signed “One of Wade’s Victims.” This is
surely a mistake, as neither Mr. Wade nor any of his
Government had anything to do with imposing the extra
cost of 6s. mentioned, and it would have been much more
appropriate to have signed the letter, “ A Victim of the
Federal Labor Party,” as they are the ones who were
the cause of the extra cost complained of.— Letter signed
“ Fairplay ” (same paper, same date, same heading).
May" I point out that your correspondent who com-
plains of the cost of living, and herself “One of
Wade’s Victims,” evidently has not studied the question
of cause and effect. lam much in the same position as
herself, and I would remind her '.tjjat the reason the
wages of our husbands will not go as far as they did is
largely because the cost of living has been raised to us
by the votes of Labor members for heavy taxes on the
food, clothing, medicines, furniture, and other neces-
saries of ourselves and children. — Letter signed “Sold
by the Labor Party ” (same; paper, same date, same
heading ).
The tariff has reduced the wages.qf Australian labor by
26 per cent. Because of William Lyne and his herd of
pampered manufacturers the working man getting Bs. per
day finds it wqrth only 6s. This is the man who prates
about plenty Of wdrk and good wages after he has pro-
vided fruitful soil for monopolies and combines to grow
in. He has set up interests which live by sweating.—A.
G. Huie, unreasoning Single-tax crank, in S. M. Herald.
(2) I offer you my congratulat ions on the prosperity the
State now enjoys, and on the prospect of a continuance
of conditions calculated to make for the general welfare.
It is gratifying to know that for almost all primary pro-
ducts SATISFACTORY PRICES PREVAIL, and an ever-
increasing demand abroad creates a steady augmentation
in the volume of exports. At the same time, it is reassur-
ing to observe the growing strength and stability of our
manufacturing industries, and the greater number of
people to which these give employment.— Governor’s
speech ( composed by Freetrade Premier Wade ) at opening
of N.S. IP. State Parliament.
As already mentioned, food has “riz.” Great
Britain is a Freetrade country which has all the
world to buy from, and it isn’t affected in its food
prices by Link’s tariff—in fact, very few people
there have ever heard of Lynk’s tariff. In
1901 Great Britain was offering Australia
2s. 9d. per bushel for its wheat on
the wharves of Sydney, Melbourne or Ade-
laide, and naturally the local wheat-dealer
was willing to sell locally at 2s. 9d. In May this
year the hungry and frantic British person, suffer-
ing under all the advantages of Freetrade, was
willing to give ss. 3fd. per bushel for our
wheat, and the Australian, under the system
which leaves food-dealing and food-supplying to
Private Enterprise, had to pay the same price or
do without wheat. A number of other things
went up in proportion, for when Bull’s Freetrade
loaf went so sky-high that he could hardly see it,
he started to use increased quantities of bran,
potatoes, oats, and everything else that eoujd pos-
sibly be a substitute for ordinary flour. Therefore
these things also went up. If Bull, the Free-
trader, gets hungry enough to eat grass, the sudden
demand may make even grass go up. In fact.
Bull, the Freetrader, has raised his bids for almost
everything that Australia has to export. He did
it on so large a scale that whereas in 1901 he was
willing to give us £lOOO for a parcel of goods made
up in fair proportions of all the things that we
export, in 1907 he was offering us £1404 for the
same goods, and in May, 1909, he was offering,us
£1205. The prices had dropped between 1907 and
the present year, but in May, 1909, they were
again on the up-grade. And
amid the general rise the big-
gest rise was that which took
place in the cost of the dady
loaf—shoved upwards by the
clamor of Freetrade England
for wheat at almost any price.
Australia grows almost every
important article of food. When
food prices went up so seri-
ously in the Freetrade land of
Bull that the necessaries which
that person could buy with 20s.
in 1901 cost him over 28s. in
1907, and over 245. in 1909—in
other words, when Bull's Free-
trade £1 of the year 1901 became
worth only about 14s. in 1907 —
Australian prices, as a matter of course, rose all
round to correspond. There is no sentiment
about, the exporter; he won’t even sell a penny
scone to Australia unless it pays him the full price
that John Bull or John Chinaman or any other
distant person is prepared to give. To Pro-
tectionist Australia, taken as a whole and without
regard to individual cases, the increase of prices
was a blessing. If Australia grows certain
foods to a value of. say £4,000,000, and eats
one half and sells Bull the other half, it is
obvious that it gets its food and £2,000,000 in
cash. If the price of these same victuals doubles,
then Australia gets its own food and £4,000,000 in
cash. The result is that, in the case of a country
with a surplus of food for export, high prices are.
for the community as a whole, an unmixed
blessing. For the unfortunate Freetrade Bull,
however, they are b tragedy pure and simple. So
grievously has agriculture faded under Freetrade
that out of Great Britain’s 78,000,000 acres only
1,800,000 now grow wheat. The country’s imports
of food run at ordinary times to nearly £200,000,000
a year, and when the price of that same lot of food
goes up to £240,000,000, or £280,000,000, the differ-
ence is all dead loss, and there is hunger and
great misery in the Freetrade land.
*■*•'■**
Of course, when the price of food goes up, other
things go. up in sympathy. It costs the boot-
maker and the furniture-maker, and the maker of
everything else more to live when the clamor and
hunger of Freetrade Bull have put up wheat
from 2s. 9d. to ss. 3fd., and these people, natu-
rally, do their best to get more wages ? and, if
they get more wages, that adds to the cost of
boots and furniture. But to a country which
exports more than it imports, high prices pay,
despite all drawbacks ; if the exports in a time of
low prices are £25,000,000, and the imports
£20,000,000, the country has £5,000,000 cash to
receive; but if prices double all round, and the
exports are worth £50,000,000, while the imports
are worth £40,000,000, it has a cash balance of
£10,000,000 to receive. The trouble is that the
profit, as a rule, isn’t fairly distributed, and the
people who don’t get their fair share write to the
papers denouncing Bill Line’s tariff. On the
other hand, for a country like Britain,
which imports, in an ordinary year, to the
value of fully £100,000,000 more than it
exports, a great rise in prices, which calls upon it
to pay away perhaps £200,000,000 to square its
accounts, instead of the usual £100,000,000, spells
calamity. Australia, as a whole, with its surplus
of food for export, is never so prosperous as when
prices are high : Britain, which has almost given
up growing food, is never so miserable as when
prices are high. To the local Freetrade perverter
these facts are well enough known, but he regards
the rise in food prices as a handy argument in the
interests of his fiscal superstition. Therefore,
when he is talking about the fact that we have to
pay more for that part of our wheat crop which
goes to make the loaf we eat, he says it is the
natural and accursed result of Link’s Protectionist
tariff. And when he is talking of the fact that we
get twice as much for that portion of our wheat
crop which we sell to the distressed Freetrader.
Bull, he says nothing about Lyne’s tariff. Which


is characteristic of the Freetrade perverter in all
his bearings.
* * * *
These violent fluctuations, brought about by
outside influences, are distinctly bad for the
wheat-growing industry. When prices are very
low many farmers give up growing wheat; they
turn some of their employees adrift, stop helping
along the agricultural implement industry by buy-
ing ploughs and harrows, and take to the lazy,
harmless sheep. When prices go up like a rocket
they rush to plant wheat again ; but it is quite
possible that, by the time thecrop arrives, prices are
once more down, and the rush is, to a great extent,
wasted effort. There is a popular desire for some
system which will ensure the farmer a fair steady
price, so that it will pay him to stick to the wheat
industry, and will prevent the local loaf bounding
wildly up and down merely because J. Bull, or
some other remote person, has made a muddle of
his fiscal affairs or adheres to an antiquated and
Tory land system. In other words, there is a
very natural wish that the price of Australian
wheat in Australia should have no relationship to
the price of Australian wheat in England. Some-
thing of the kind might possibly be brought
about by a huge experiment in State Socialism—
about the largest experiment up to date. If the
Government constituted itself the sole purchaser
of grain from the farmers, and bought at a fixed
price, considerably above the low-water mark of
the worst years yet very considerably below the
exorbitant figure that prevails to-day, it could, by
selling locally at a fixed price, and by regulating
the price of bread to correspond, prevent the Aus-
tralian loaf ever kiting up to a figure that is right
out of sight; and, at the same time, it could
make the bucolic person’s job a good deal less pre-
carious than it is. Then the Government could
export the surplus grain, and sell it at the highest
possible figure, and when the exportation yielded
a profit it could form a big reserve fund to meet
the trouble in lean years when the Federal
authority was paying the local farmer 3s. 6d. per
bushel, yet had to sell the exported surplus to
Bull at 2s. 9d. or 3s. If the reserve fund became
very large the Government might even declare a
dividend to suppliers with part of the money, but
that would not be a thing to be done recklessly.
* * * *
There would, doubtless, be a heap of troubles
in the road of the Federal Wheat Monopoly.
In the lean years the farmer would be
overjoyed to get perhaps 3s. fid. per bushel
when the open market would only offer him
2s. 9d., but the eater of bread would very likely
grumble at having to pay £d. or more for his
loaf tnan he need do if everything was left to
open competition. In fat years the mere eater of
bread would ,admire the scheme which kept down
the price of the loaf, but the farmer would pro-
fa ibly raise Gain at only getting 3s. 6d. per bushel
when John Bull was willing to give ss. 3d. If
the Wheat Monopoly struck, bad years at the
commencement, it would get into debt before its
reserve fund started ; if it began with a run of
good years, and the reserve fund heaped up very
high and very rapidly, there would be a clamor
for the immediate distribution of the money. The
language of the useless middleinanor wheat dealer,
deprived of his job, would be terrible, and the
language of the daily papers which he was
able to influence would be almost worse. It
would be necessary to sternly regulate rents in
order to prevent them going so high as to make
wheat-growing at the Govfirnment price im-
practicable. If, for some unexpected reason, the
area under grain diminished, compulsory wheat-
growing might become necessary; and if a
grievous drought came along, and for a year or so
Australia became an importing instead of an
exporting country, the Federal Wheat Monopoly
would have a new problem on its hands. .Still
the price of wheat and the price of the loaf would
be kept steady, and when the costly and nefarious
middleman or speculator was abolished, the
farmer—who nowadays often makes very little
even out of a very big rise in prices—would
almost certainly be better off in the long run.
In this matter Indian State Opium Monopoly
furnishes a precedent to go upon. A blessed
thing is precedent, and handy to have about the
house.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Kingdom of Football.
This is the middle of winter, and the loud and
profane game of football is strong in the land.
The defence of Australia is no further advanced
than it was; but there are more football ciubs
than ever before, and the chase of blown humanity
after blown leather increases mightily. Football
is" an ancient Scotch game—or insanity—and it
made up quite a large section of the history of old-
time Scotland. In fact, most of the disasters
which fell on Scotland away in the remote past
were owing to football, and it almost looks as if
the same sort of thing might yet happen to Aus-
tralia. In the dim ages there were no firearms.
Soldiers either rode each other down with lances,
or pounded each other furiously with swords and
axes, or else stood off and spitted each other
with arrows. Very often the army that had
the worse set of archers never got near
enough to the other to hit it even once with its
axe ; it was cut to pieces at long range. In those
times the archer was the expert soldier; any
person of courage and brawn could put on his
mail and lash out with an axe just as if lie were
cutting wood at home, but skilled archery re-
quired constant practice. In England and Scot-
land military service was compulsory, and in each
country the able-bodied citizen was required to
own armor and weapons, and to practise assidu-
ously with the long-bow. The Englishman did
practise assiduously from childhood until his
60th year every Sunday and every holi-
day ; the Scotchman played football. That
is to say, the people of both countries wanted
to play football, but one nation was allowed
to do it and the other wasn’t. The arm
of the English king at London was long, and his
law, that the footballer should have his ears cut
off for the first offence and be hanged if he per-
sisted in the game, was a law that stood its ground.
The arm of the Scotch king at Edinburgh—the
king who was oppressed by the English on one
side, and harried by the Highland Gelts and the
armies of the Lord of the Isles on the other—was
of very little weight, and his laws hardly signified.
When a Scotch king had to borrow a pair of
stockings from one of his own noblemen in
order to receive a foreign ambassador, it
was hard to take his statutes seriously.
So the Englishman remained an archer, and the
Scot remained a footballer. The Englishman was
the best and longest range archer on earth ; the
Scotchman was among the worst. He wasn’t
a patch on the Lapp or the Cossack;
or in the same street with the famous
crossbow-man of Genoa. Scotland in the re-
mote ages was far madder upon football
than Australia is to-day, and quite as mad as Aus-
tralia seems likely to be to-morrow. A distracted
Government passed many ordinances making
football punishable by heavy fine and imprison-
ment, but the ordinances were mostly a dead
letter. So the Scotch learned practically no
archery for lack of time to practise. As a result
of excessive football in the one country, and prac-
tically none in the other, the Scotch army was a
short-range force like Tommy Burns, and the
English one was a long-range force like Jack
Johnson. Only an extraordinary military genius
like Robert Bruce could win a battle with a
Scotch army against an English one, while he had
all this football to contend with, and even then the
English commander mostly required to be con-
siderable of a fool to allow the Scot to win. The
problem of getting to close quarters—of getting
through a sleet of arrows, and arriving within
sword and axe range without such stupendous loss
as to make the attacking force useless and demoral-
ised when it arrived—was generally unsolvable.
When it was solved, the brawny eaters of porridge
and oatmeal cake usually came out on top, but
the event didn’t happen often enough to be much
worth mentioning. Alnwick, Northallerton,
Dunbar, Nesbit Moor, Falkirk, Halidon, Neville’s
Cross, Homildon, Flodden, and many other
appalling butcheries were, so far as the evidence
goes, lost to the Scotch on the football field. It
is alleged that a person who was old enough to
know better worked off on the public a foolish
saying about Britain’s battles being won on the
playing grounds of Eton; but the name of the
battles that were won there aren’t known, while
the names of those that were lost in similar places
are dotted through history. And to-day, when
the football barrackers go forth in their hundreds
of thousands, not to take exercise themselves, but
to yell horribly while other men boot the muddy
sphere, one is inclined to wonder whether old
Caledonian history may not be getting ready to
repeat itself at this end of the world. History
doesn’t trouble about localities ; it is as ready to
repeat itself at one place as at another.

Mr. “Whiskers” Ward, of the Sydney Tele-
graph, seems to be doing more to bring this
country into disrepute than all the rest of his
colleagues at the British Press Conference. We
keep hearing of Ward by cable, and always we
seem to hear of him in the same fashion —as a
hitherto-horribly-ignorant but now-amazed-and-
suddenly-enlightened Ward on whom the great-
ness and glory of England have just dawned as a
radiance. For instance: —
Mr. P. W. Ward, in an interview with the Daily
Chroniclk representative, said: “The deepest impres-
sion of the result of the Imperial Press Conference is
England’s vitality. Protectionists in New South Wales
are always saying that England is decadent. The size
and importance of England’s, manufacturing industries
simply amazed us. We cannot understand England’s
pessimism about England.”
Of course, the people who lead Ward and his col-
leagues around show them the best of everything
and put the best face on things generally. That
is always done, which is the reason why the visitor
to Australia is shown the glories of Monaro
and Kosciusko, and the lovelineness of the
mountains behind Cairns, and is taken to
Gippsland and Jenolan and Govett’s Leap,
but is not shown Yassberra or any place
even moderately adjacent thereto. Unto
Ward is revealed all the magnificence of the
front entrance, but his attention isn’t specially
drawn to the ash-barrel at the back gate. And
Ward evidently takes everything for granted.
He doesn’t go and look at the things he isn’t sup-
posed to see, and he assumes that what he is
shown is a fair sample of all the rest. Even on
that basis, however, the old man’s childlike
astonishment is painful to witness. He deliber-
ately sets himself to create the impression that
the typical Australian editor is an untravelled
bumpkin who has, all the years of his life, been
writing the wrong thing for lack of any know-
ledge of events outside his own narrow circle.
Ward, as the editor of a large and influential
Australian paper, poses as a sort of provincial
infant who has had a new world opened to him,
and is going back to explain it all to the
other infants. Now Ward has every right to
present himself in that light if he wants to; and
he has every right to present his own daily paper
as one that has been run on lines of profound
ignorance if his paper will stand it; but lie has
no right to pose as the astounded press back-
blocker from Australia in such a way
as to make the world think all Australia
is built on similar lines. Ward, casting
an astonished eye on the surface of
things, is quite unable to understand England’s
pessimism about itself. Yet Englishmen who
live in the country, and see more than the mere
surface, are pessimistic, and clamor for a change
of-policy. They know that the decay of agricul-
ture has reduced the area under wheat by nearly
one half in 30 years ; that the country grows more
and more dependent on foreign food supplies;
that its birfh-rate is dropping fast, and the chest
measurement of its scanty army is declining ; that
a steadily-increasing proportion of itsexports con-
sists of coal, an irreplacable raw material; that
the number of paupers in the United Kingdom
rose from 990,359 in 1890 to 1,125,594 in 1908 ; and
that a very large number of the huge industries
which so impressed and staggered Ward can look
back on some date not many years ago when
each of them was much bigger than it is now,
and that the fear of further decadence is a
very real fear indeed. Very great are Britain’s
industries, but it takes a heap of industry
to support a population of over 40,000,000;
and British statesmen, who know all about the
ash-barrel at the back gate, as well as about the
gorgeous front portal which they showed to
Ward, realise that the industries are becoming
insufficient, and for that reason they are leaving
Ward’s fiscal superstition in increasing numbers.
Yet Ward will apparently come back a more
convinced Freetrader than ever, simply because
Britain’s industries are still large, and because he
didn’t drop to the fact that the industrial edifice
isn’t all front.

The Victorian Land-Tax Farce.
The State’s own “Year Book,” just issued, shows
what a farce the Victorian land-tax is. Every one
of its three underlying principles is absurd :
(1) It isn’t a graduated tax—at least, it isn’t a gradu-
ated tax as that.term is generally understood. .
,(•2) No estate pf less than 640 acres is taxable.
(3) The land must be valued according to its sheep-
carrying value ; and the maximum taxable value is ±4 per
acre.
Under this law one bloated landlord might own
half , the city of Melbourne, and still pay no tax.
He might own the whole of it, and still pay only
about ss. a year, because Collins-street and
Flinders-street are notoriously poor grazing
grounds for sheep, whatever they may be
for wolves. From the revenue-producing
point of view, the tax is, therefore, utterly
absurd. But no matter how good an
estate may be, no matter how large a population
of men and women it might sustain, it must be
valued, not on that basis, but in proportion to its
capacity to carry sheep; and it must never be
regarded as capable of carrying more than two
sheep to the acre. As a means, therefore, of
breaking up estates that are specially suited for
closer settlement the tax is equally absurd. The
first result of the sections declaring that the pas-
toral value shall be the basis of taxation is that,
for the purposes of the tax, the land is valued
at less than one-third of its actual worth.
The “Year Book” shows that the declared
capital value of taxable estates in 1908 was
£10,440,615; and as each estate is entitled to a
£2500 exemption, the net taxable value was
£7,250,615. At tiie same time the Registrar of
Land Tax estimated that the actual value of this
land was £35,789,533. Thus by a cunning fake,
directed at the very basis of the tax, the big land-
lords of Victoria escape more than two-thirds of
the tax. But that is not all. The men who
ought to pay the most, because they occupy large
areas of the very best country, in reality pay the
least. The total tax paid last year was £90,632;
and, as shown above, the taxable estates are
valued on an honest basis at £35.789,533. That is
to say, the average tax is 0’25 per cent, of the
actual value, whereas the tax is nominally 1'25
per cent. But while on the average the estates
pay 0'25 per cent., the most fertile estates —those
in Class I.—pay only OTB per cent., because the
valuation must never go above £4 an acre. Thus,
instead of paying 255. per £lOO they pay only
3s. 7d. per £lOO. The richer the estate, and the
more capable, therefore, of maintaining a popula-
tion, the less the tax. Instead of offering an
inducement to men to sell or fully use such land,
the law encourages them to hang on and do as
little as they please with it. It is almost impos-
sible to conceive of a tax of o'3o percent. —6s. per
£lO0 —persuading a big, bloated landlord to pass the
estate on to men who would cultivate it; but still
a tax of 6s. per £lOO would obviously be more of
a persuader than a tax of only 3s. 7d. per £lOO.
Yet the heavier tax is put upon the owner of the
poorer land ; the shriekingly absurd 3s. 7d. in the
£lOO is saved up for the owner of the very fattest
land which can’t be valued above £4 an acre. To
that extent the Victorian land-tax is progressive,
but it progresses the wrong way. It is graduated ;
but it is graduated in favor of the fattest land-
lords. Instead of the rule being that the richer
the land the heavier the tax, the law works out
that the richer the land the lighter is the tax.
There apparently are persons who don’t believe
in the graduated land-tax. They say it is spolia-
tion and robbery. Well, what have they got to
say about this form of graduation?
British. Philanthropy in India.
The public assassination at the Imperial Institute,
London, of Sir William Curzon Wyllie, an
Indian political and military potentate of great
tonnage and long standing, by one Dhinagri, a
Hindu student, has made the British community
totter on its foundations. For it is perfectly well
known that Dhinagri is not an isolated nigger,
but one of a very large and ever-increasing
class ; in fact, that he stands for a gigantic
disaffection which may some day loom up
300,000,000 strong. When the Hindu is dis-
affected in India it is bad for Britain ; when, in
addition, the educated Hindu starts to pursue his
rulers to England and there slaughter them in
public, quite regardless of h.s own life, things are
plainly becoming worse. Yet it is difficult
to see what else Britain could expect.
Britain took India with the strong hand,
and plundered it with the strong hand.'
The amount of loot—plain stealings in coin,
gems, ornaments, curios, fabrics, etc.—brought
from that country to England in the early days
has been guessed at a value of £500,000,000. It
was to a great extent this capital which gave
Britain its sudden pre-eminence in Europe during
the days just before the Napoleonic wars. Then
began the new regime which promises to make
far more trouble than the old one did. The period
of philanthropy started. Britain to a great
extent repented of the sins of the old East
India Company and its villainous agents.
Missionaries went to India and pervaded
the land with a gospel according to which all
men were to be equal in Heaven,, and that
seemed a fair reason why they should
also be equal on earth. Schools and colleges
were established, and the babu was taught
Fnglish Constitutional history—about the equal
rights and liberties which belong to all persons
under the glorious British flag ; about how there
should be no taxation without Parliamentary re-
presentation ; about Hampden’s protest on
the same subject; about Washington and
Jefferson; about the public execution of a
British King because he endeavored to rule without
a Parliament, and so on. Britain has always been
intensely proud of the way it spread education
among the Hindu populations, and said that it
wasn’t like other conquerors —that its motives
were benevolent, and its doings were just, and
the Bible was the secret of England’s greatness.
Then, having deliberately spread itself to teach
the native that all its methods of govern-
ment in India were utterly iniquitous, it
is surprised that the very first generation of
its new students should begin to shoot at their
masters. It dare not give India any real local
Parliamentary Government, for then it couldn’t
hold India. It dare not give India a share, in
proportion to its population, in any Parliament of
All the Empire which may be created in the
future, for then the Hindu would govern England.
It dare not make the tenth part of a pretence
at treating the Hindu as the white man’s
social equal even in the Hindu’s own country.
The census of 1901 set forth that the British-born
civil population of India was 96,053, and was
decreasing; and the British civil and military
population was probably abo..t 200,000. The
native population numbered 294,000,000. The
only way in which that British handful can
retain its supremacy is by posing as a race of
gods, and persuading the native of his utter
inferiority. When there are so very few gpds
they dare not come down from their pedestals of
unutterable superiority and unutterable con-
tempt. Their dignity must be great and their mana
tremendous. The British person in India could
not live up to his own book-theories of freedom
and human rights, yet for the mere pride of being
unlike other conquerors—of being the world’s
great philanthropist—he kept on building schools
and colleges in which more and more natives
learned to read about Washington and Hampden
and Charles I. He had 20 or 30 years of
self-satisfaction out of all this—till the first con-
siderable consignment of students grew up. Then
the show threatened to burst. The Hindu,
having been encouraged to read the story of the
formal execution of Charles I.’s minion, Straf-
ford, does an informal but equally public execu-
tion upon the body of Edward Yll.’s equally
autocratic and unparliamentary representative,
W. Curzon Wyllie —and it is hard to see
what else could be expected. Yet things
are only beginning. Even at the date of the
census of 1901 a mere 15,686,421 of the
people of India could read and write ; there
were nearly 278,000,000 who had still to learn to
read so that they could discover all about British
freedom, the doctrine of “no taxation without
Parliamentary representation,” about Magna
Charts, the protests of Washington. Jefferson,
Hampden and Cromwell ; the fate of Strafford,
Charles L, James 11., and Archbishop Laud,
and such-like subjects. And the moral seems to
be that Britain has got to shut its Indian schools
and universities, suppress Indian newspapers,
destroy Indian libraries, prohibit Indian educa-
tion, chase its missionaries out of the country,
and settle down to be a plain, uncultured tyrant
— : or else the ultimate loss of India is the only
visible alternative.
The Yellow Pup Returns to the Old Kennel.
Six months ago representatives of the Orange
Lodges of N.S.W. took boat to Cremorne in the
wake of the only Hill (he of the calves), and
with much waving banner, cold tea and Kentish
fire proceeded to spout concerning a new “ Pro-
testant political party,” that had been formed.
The thing that differentiated this Protestant
party from all others was the alleged fact that it
was democratic. Speakers frankly recognised
the necessity that had arisen in late years of
attracting to DiLL-ism, not the small bourgeois
type merely—a type which is all right so far as it
goes, but which, for election and collection-plate
purposes, doesn’t go nearly so far as is desirable—
but also the huge army of non-Romanist workers.
A flood of talk, amazing when one considers
its source, was unloosed. The public learned
that Orangeism intended, thenceforth, to
support a “broad national policy.” The fiscal
question was to be sunk (which killed the broad
national policy in one act). Derryites were to
be barrackers, for the future, in the cause of Aus-
tralian as opposed to hired defence ; also for a
land policy which would throw open areas to
would-be settlers ; for fair wage-rates ; and for all
the other things their leaders had previously held
were machinations of Rome. That was in Febru-
ary last. A week ago the daily papers printed
this item—and it is typical of others that have
been appearing broadcast in the metropolitan and
country press of late :
Lithgow, Monday.
Pursuant to the formation of a Protestant political
party at the recent annual sessions of the Orange Grand
Lodge, the country lodges have been circularised to form
working political committees, and to enter on active
propaganda work in the interests of the party. The
matter was considered at a special meeting of the Lith-
gow Orange Lodge, and it was decided to take steps to
secure the co-operation of the Liberal and Reform party.
It was considered that if this were done it would prevent
the probability of a split at election time.
The N.S.W. Liberal and Reform party is, of all
the Australian parties, State or Federal, the most
solidly anti-Labor and anti-Australian. By com-
parison with it the Anti-Sosh wing in the Federal
House is broad-minded, tolerant and patriotic.
It is the anti-immigration party, inasmuch as,
behind a lot of unconvincing closer settlement
verbiage which leads nowhere and is intended to
take that path, it stands doggedly for locked
lands—an inevitable attitude (after all) in a party
one of whose main financial supports is Squatter
McOaughey. It is a party which affects to con-
sider any aspiration in the direction of Australian,
as opposed to hired defence, to be “folly” and
“traitorism to the Motherland.” In its hatred
of this so-called “ wild-cat Labor scheme ” it has
declined to even look into the Australian navy
proposal, so that its leader, the Premier of the
unhappy State of N.S.W., held the weird
view not many weeks ago-r-if, indeed, he doesn’t
hold it still —that the River destroyers ordered
to be laid down by the Fisher Government
were vessels designed for service in rivers only,
and incapable of taking to the deep sea, instead
of being vessels of the class which, in the British
navy, are named after British rivers. It is the
low-wage party —the party which believes in 4s. a
week for shop girls; and, in general, the party
beneath whose standard the militant Ma State
geebung, the Cabbage Tree Mob, the indent fakir,
the State Frighter and the vested interests fore-
gather. And it is with this gang of reactionaries
that the Protestant Political party, which six
months ago claimed to have democratised itself,
is now taking steps to co-operate. When The
Bulletin first read, in the queer DiLL-ite sheet
which appears weekly with the object of destroys
ing Rome, that DiLL-ism was to be Laborite for
the future, it expressed incredulity. It said
(11/2/’O9): —
Are Orangemen going to change their political spots
thus suddenly?... Are the Anti-Sosh DiLL-ites who hold
Our Debts.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Come, let us hymn the Future great,
Likewise the burdens that shall be ;
Pressed down beneath their everlasting weight,
Behold Posterity !
For him, Australia’s eldest born,
These packs of sorrow we prepare;
His curse shall echo in the distant morn—
What need the spendthrifts care?
The burden of the wars to come—
The bitterness and toil and sweat,
When we are dead, and lie for ever dumb,
Upon him shall be set!
The heavy loads that wo shall miss.
Shall on his haggard shoulders fall.
And we shall hear that deathless curse of his
Beneath the coffin-pall !
Upon his vanished ancestors
His malediction’s weight shall lie ;
The cost of dead men’s drunks and motor-cars
Shall drain his heart’s blood dry !
A wilderness of I O U’s
And grinding debts we leave to him ;
With shadow-necks in God’s eternal noose
Our souls shall dangle grim 1
The centuries our sons shall face
Are paven with their fathers’ lies;
And on our tombs their scornful hands shall trace
What thoughts within them rise !
And men shall scan our epitaph—
“ Here rest the breed of perished fools,
Who learned to scrawl their worthless autograph
In Folly’s drunken schools !
“ Like fools they lived in days agone,
Until they sank in bankrupt death ;
‘ Let’s pass the bill—let’s drink, and pass it on,’
They gasped with final breath !
• Upon our hapless children’s backs
Let these, our heavy burdens, be ;
4 Drink on ! Heap up the I O U’s in stacks,
And damn Posterity ! ’ ”

Mournfully The Bulletin records that its fore-
C L S *’ r\ Februar y ast has been justified. Already
the Orange Lodges are, politically, where they
were before the new party broke on the world.
Orangeistn is still, as heretofore, to be a sturdy
toiler in the cause of importerdorn and land mono-
poly, an upholder of State Frights and wire-netting
filchings, an enthusiast in the cause of Decayed
bish and the desirability of the working man
' knowing his place ” and not demanding a larger
weekly stipend .than his good, kind employer
proffers him. Australian workers are still to be
asked to vote for Wade, Joey Cook and
strenuous opposition to their (the workers’) in-
terests, on the grounds that, by so doing, they will
deal the Pope of distant Rome an agonising blow
in the dinner-waggon. It remains to be seen if,
in these days of free and universal education, any
number of sane Australian working-men remain
to be hoodwinked by such hoary confidence busi-
ness. The ones who are merit terms of light labor
as chronic Chapzander mission converts, coupled
with disfranchisement on the score of dementia.

The Mean Local Capitalist.
The news that land-monopolist Sam McCauohey
has ranged himself, howbeit belatedly, among the
ten thousand-pounders of the Dreadnought foolish-
ness, recalls, by a perfectly obvious thought
process, the astoundingly small amount N.S.W.’s
very rich men are wont to do for it. (When, as
in the case of the Dreadnought foolishness afore-
said, a chance arises to splash money round in
Englamd, they come forward briskly enough—but
that is another matter.) Eliminate the David
Berky and Walker bequests, and certain good
cash deeds to the credit of the charitable
though politically fatuous Abbey Dangar, and
it will be found that the Ma State’s
plutocrats have voluntarily returned practically
nothing to the land which made them.
The Cold Land millionaire has many faults, but
at least in a good number of cases he recognises
to some extent his unwritten public duties and
responsibilities to his birthplace. He takes pride
of a sort in the country where his fortunes were
founded. He shows his pride, not by spasmodic
gifts to a nation 12,000 miles away ; but by volun-
tarily doing financial things for the one he in-
hibits. His fatherland mayn’t be particularly
c imfortable as to climate and things, but it is good
enough for him mostly all the year round. Its
army is good enough for such of his sons as fancy
the military business ; its navy for those of them
whose tastes lie in the direction of seafaring ;
and its Parliament is good enough for him if he
can get there. And so with other English-
speaking countries—the United States, Canada,
etc. Their rich men stand by the land where
their fortunes originated and register their warm
approval, of it in the usual way. The Duke of
Norfolk’s gift, last month, of £60,000 worth of
p irk to the British public is not an uncommon act
on the part of the affluent man of any of these
c mntries. If anything like it eventuated here
there would be an agitated rush made by the
donor s relatives and friends to get him “ signed
up” as a maniac. Consider the average local
gift-record of the average very rich N. S. Welsher.
It is indeed a lamentable one. Most of him has
not only not bequested hospitals, parks, libraries,
university scholarships, art galleries, or such-like
expensive things out of his surplus thousands, but
he hasn’t given so much as a statue to a public
garden, or a picture to the State Gallery,
or a bed to a convalescent home, or a
fountain, or a village pump, or a dog-trough.
He not only hasn’t the decent pride in this great
country that a Yorkshire or Devonshire man has
m his county; he is actually afflicted with a sort
of sneaking shame in regard to it. He prefers to
be called not an Australian but a “Britisher.”
His sons are not sent into the Australian forces
but into those of the “Motherland.” There is
not one out of fifty of him that would be
found dead in the Parliament of his country.
His wife, if lie has one, and his daughters if he
owns any, dodge, with hisentire approval,between
England and a high old social time, and Australia
and dull retrenchment. And he, himself, when
the glad day comes that he is so extremely rich as
to be able to afford to clear altogether, does
so bag and biiggage, and settles permanently in
the land which is his Mecca. His excuse—
if, indeed, he feels that an excuse is re-
quired for such an obvious step—is that
“Labor legislation” has driven him forth. But
as he doesn’t sell out his properties, or try to, but
continues, like the Coopers and D’Arcys and the
rest, to leave them to produce revenue here, and
be despitefully treated by any Laborites who are
so disposed, hi.s argument carries short weight.
The truth is Australia’s wealthy folk quite frankly
regard this essentially white man’s land in the
light the Anglo-Indian regards the nigger-infested
strand of India—as a place wherein to make
money, and as a place to be left in great haste
when the money is made. It is the creed of these
most miserable citizens that nothing good can
come out of Australia, and that only the imported
is worth while; that no civilised person would
live here if he could afford to do otherwise ; that
the country’s manners are bad and its customs
b astly ; that it is incapable of defending itself
(hence the Dreadnought scheme), oughtn’t
to be allowed to govern itself (since, when it does,
it persists in heaving shipwrecked blacks into the
ocean, and imprisoning honest British hatters,
and so on), and in general is a dreadful, and
accursed and contemptible spot. It is Australia’s
plutocrat, the tvpical Dreadnoughter, who, 09
times out of 100. is responsible for the virulent
Decayed Fish lie which cries aloud here and
abroad for heathen burial. He is unspeakable,
and calls for treatment with arsenic. The country s
salvation lies in the fact that—wealth being pretty
evenly distributed here—there are, comparatively
speaking, few of this objectionable plutocrat, but
there remain enough to provide permanent
humiliation for local patriots, and a mass of
horrible examples in anti-patriotism for the world
outside.

There was a meeting of butter-factory secretaries
at Melbourne a few days ago, and, as usual, the
speakers deplored the absence of a full supply of
good men at low prices. Said one man with Cow
in his voice :
There was a question that concerned them deeply, and
that was the question of labor. If something were done
to overcome the labor difficulty, he thought the output
of the dairying industry could be doubled.
It never seems to strike any of these people to try
what better wages and improved conditions would
do. At present, the dairy hand gets from 12s. 6d.
to 20s. per week and found, for seven days’ work
a week, and his hours are anything from 12 to 14
per day. It doesn’t need a Solomon to under-
stand, then, that the work is loathed and
despised by all laborers, and that no man who
can get any other decent sort of a job
will tackle milking. So milking is the occupation
of the wasters and the men who are unfit for any-
thing else, and it is not surprising that they
do not “give satisfaction.” Even then, how-
ever, they give, as a rule, full value for their
miserable wage, especially considering their poor
food and wretched surroundings. It would be
bad enough if all this was necessary—that is to
*av, if the dairyman could not afford more. But
in the big dairying centres, such as the Western
district of Victoria, whence many of these
factory secretaries came, the landowners have
been coining money out of the industry, and land-
values are soaring up so high because of the Cow
profits that it will soon require a telescope to see
them. Yet, whenever there is any talk of ex-
tending the Factories Act to dairying, or creating
Wages Boards, there is a howl that can be heard,
on a calm day, as far as Tasmania. In fact, it
was that howl which created the legend of the
bunyip.
♦
The Launceston Examiner (Tas.), in its issue of
June 17, struck the newest and cheekiest explana-
tion of Australia’s big estates which has arrived up
to date:—
As a matter of fact, the chief trouble in Australia, and
to some extent even in Tasmania, is that there is too
much land. In the mainland States settlers have taken
up virgin land, have cropped it to death, and have then
sold it back to the pastoralist, and have gone further
afield to take up more virgin soil. Then they have
clamored for the State to follow them up with new roads
and railways, and as they possessed votes it has been
done. Thun we find the chief cereal centres in Victoria
are those remote, from markets, while soil, equally as good,
in a better rainfall zone, and nearer to a seaport, is
under pasture. If there had not been an overplus of land
these people would have farmed their original holdings
more scientifically, and would be on them to-day. To
some extent it has been the same in Tasmania.
So the Examiner would have people believe that
the vast grass estates of the Western District of
Victoria, and the Bibbenluke and Peel Hi ver and
A. A. Co.'s properties in N.S.W., and the huge
holdings on Queensland’s Darling Downs, and
such-like places, were once cut up into farms, and
were waving cornfields before the squatter and the
jumbuck got them. It is a marvel that a paper
which is so completely independent of history
and so capable of making new history while you
wait doesn’t round off its tale by adding that
Charles I. was executed at Parramatta, and re-
marked in his last moments that the land was
being cut up altogether too rapidly, and that if he
had read the Examiner more carefully he would
have come to a better end. After which Oliver
Cromwell beheaded him with a silver fish-knife,
and his body was eaten by the kangaroos, which
were then numerous at Summer Hill.

The Sydney Telegraph thanks Heaven for the
Fusion, because it will retard the spread of the mon-
ster, Socialism. But after the paper had for weeks
been cursing the monster in a vague, general
fashion it became one day necessary to consider
the animal more in detail. The question at issue
was the railways ; and imported chief Johnson
was sternly told that he mustn’t think he was in
England still: —
In England, and in America, too, trains are run by
companies, whose primary consideration is profit for the
private shareholders. It is to escape the evils inherent in
that system that the people of New South Wales have
vested the ownership and control of the railways and
tramways in the State. With us, the .primary purpose
for which the railways and tramways exist is public
usefulness.
And next day it considered the monster in .another
detail —in connection with a North Sydney light-
ing proposal this time :
Before making, any such concession, however, the
municipality might reflect that what will pay a private
company will pay it, and that it can probably render the
service at a lower cost to consumers than they will get it
from a private supplier. A company has to pay dividends
to its shareholders ; in a municipal undertaking the
ratepayers are the shareholders, and get dividends, much
more widely distributed, in the form of lower charges.
A company, again, is sometimes hard to dispossess when
public necessity calls for the public resumption of its
monopoly, and equally difficult to bring pressure upon in
the matter of reducing its charges.
In short, the awful monster Socialism, when in-
spected at close quarters, is a benevolent party
which aims at the public good ; and the good fairy
Private Enterprise, when likewise inspected at
close quarters, appears to lie mostly made up of
teeth and claws.
A mania of convention-holding has seized
the nations. There is not a Government depart-
ment of any pretensions that has not, during late
years, had the chance of sending a costly repre-
sentative to Europe to sit on some convention or
conference or ocher. • At present Statistician
Knibbs is away at one show. The newspaper
push is having a noisy gathering. A Military
Conference is on, and -Toe Ward, of M.toriland,
h is shut up the political shop until he comes back
from it. And now the Federal Government has
received invites to send representatives, at the
public expense, to sit on three international
conventions to discuss (1) Veterinary subjects—
sick horses and the like; (2) Drink; (3) Demo-
graphy. This sort of thing seems to be overdone.
If war breaks out. and Britain loses command of
the sea, many of our brightest intellects may not
be able to get back.

“The Gambler’s Sweetheart,” a melo-
drama of U.S.A. extraction, was staged at
Sydney Criterion on Saturday night last. The
action is laid in Idaho, where some of the coon
songs come from, and there is a certain appro-
priateness in the circumstance. “ The Gambler’s
Sweetheart ” is permeated with all the maniacal
improbability of a coon song, and it has all the
sticky sentimentality of that sort of ballad.

Alec Fairfax, Jack Mason and Max Wayne
own a gold mine. Duncan Le Moyne (1) persuades
Mrs. Wayne that her husband has left her
for another, (2) convinces Mr. Wayne that his
wife has played the same scurvy trick on him. So
Wayne hurries to a lunatic asylum and there dies,
and Mrs. Mayne arrives tearfully at the Golden
Hun Hotel near the gold mine aforesaid, and is re-
fused admittance with scorn—American pubs being
notoriously forbidden ground to any woman who is
suspected of having left her husband for another
man. Alec, a splendid though mutton-headed
young fellow in a flaxen beard, befriends her.
Enter Le Moyne and a horrible oldster named
Bixby, who affects a brimless tall hat, and is
addicted to drink and red stripes and spots on his
visage. This unsavory brace are in pursuit of the
title-deeds, which are to their sort as ground-
game is to the trained bird-dog. Meanwhile Jack
Mason—alleged to be a gambler, though
his lofty moral character suggests that he
never did worse in the game-of-chance
line than join a Star-Bowkett Society—
is employed making honorable love to Bess,
sister of Alec above mentioned. After a while
Jack kisses Bess, and the dark deed is observed
by Alec. The annoyance of Alec is something
stupendous. He rails at Jack with the warmth of
a hot-gospeller faced by an unrepentant Sab-
bath-breaker. It appears to be an unwritten law
of Idaho that gamblers may not embrace people’s
sisters. Jack reelsawav, a broken and hopeless man.
Years pass. Le Moyne and his disreputable ally
turn up once more, still absorbed in their old, tire-
less hunt for title-deeds. With them is a convict
brother of the late Max. whom they have per-
suaded to impersonate the deceased. Alec has
meanwhile married Mrs. Wayne. She encounters
the deeds-chasers, and is at once induced to flee.
The tendency of this woman to flee wildly into the
open country, on slight provocation, is amazing.
Just here Jack Mason returns. His hair is white
and he has changed his hat; otherwise he is the
same glorious character as in the years which the
locust had for dinner. This time he betrays a
belated horse-sense by removing and marrying
Bess regardless of the infuriated wails of Alec.
And now the deeds-pursuers burst on Alec. The
person with the spots, etc., reads to him from
what looks like a judgment summons, that
the mine is no longer his. That suffices for
Alec, who, for all his posturing, is a miserably
weak and unrcsourceful creature, and he subsides
immediately. Alec, when next seen, is in the
home of the Masons, clad in the neck-muffler of
extreme indigence. And so he remains till the
insanely-ungrateful treatment that Le Moyne
and the ex-convict accord their dipsomaniacal
colleague stings the latter to repentance and the
disclosure of “all.” A sound maxim for stage
villains is never to have any truck with
drunks. There is something lovable about a
drunk which makes an audience dissatisfied if he
doesn’t right himself by giving away the whole
show before the end of the play.

Miss Maggie Moore plays Bess with in-
finite vigor and jollity. But it is difficult, unless
one is prepared to regard hers as an extreme case
of arrested mental development, to accept this
plump and mature matron as a schoolgirl of 16.
Jack Mason (H. R. Roberts) is an alluring
character—a gambler, and yet a good, brave, and
honest man, a model husband, father and citizen.
In clothes and appearance he is a dashing back-
woods poker-expert, but the golden heart of him
is that of a typical verger. Miss Beatrice Esmond
(Ethel Wayne), Miss Bashford (Mrs. Boggs),
Sidney Everett as the intoxicated Bixby, W. J.
Montgomery (Le Moyne), Fred Francis (Alec), and
John F. Forde (Flynn) all do well, and the stag-
ing is effective.

Swift dramatic changes are to be the order
of the night at Sydney Criterion till the “ Cinder-
ella” pantomime happens along. To-night
(Thursday) and Friday Miss Olive Burke’s co.
appears in “Dr. Bill.” On Saturday “Leah, the
Forsaken ” will be played bv Stanley McKay and
colleagues; and Tuesday (13th) is set down for a
revival of “Hamlet” (he of Denmark) by the
Walter Bentley band of mimes.

“Sweet Kitty Bellairs” ceases to com-
promise herself at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) after
Tuesday next, and on Wednesday (which is the
14th of the month) the divine (though dead) Bill’s
“As You 'Like It” will be presented. Miss
Nellie Stewart plays Rosalind “for the first
time on any stage,” and gorgeous things in the
way of mounting are promised. William’s effort
will hold the boards for six nights, and then any
old dramatic thing may happen.

“The Great Rescue ” continues to occur
at Sydney Royal. It bids fair to be one of
the most profitable deeds of heroism on record.
The average effort of the sort produces
nothing more, 99 times out of 100, than bronchial
pneumonia, the plaudits of a few currish specta-
tors (themselves too cautious to go in for life-
salvaging) and an unsightly and practically un-
pawnable Humane Society’s medal. Also a loafer
steals the'rescuer’s watch out of the waistcoat
which he threw off before making the plunge.
The Blandolt rescuers retain their customary good
health, gather in a positive plethora of cheers
nightly, and have already earned the cash equiva-
lent of enough medals whereunder to stifle a
mastodon.

West’s Pictures, at Sydney Palace, are
committing the unpardonable sin of showing a
great newspaper office from within. This sort
of thing must be suppressed, otherwise the dwind-
ling influence of the great daily will go hung
altogether. Fortunately there is no gramaphone
to show the mob how the opinions of the
literary staff of a great daily are changed
at will by the boss of the advertising
department, or Heaven only knows what
might happen. The pictures of the dirigible
balloon give an atmosphere of up-to-dateness
that makes for popularity ; and the romance of
wealth, luxury and gems rich and rare is poured
forth as the story of the Brahmin’s Diamond
rushes across the flickerless sheet. The excellence
of the modern film is something undreamt of two
years ago; and anyone who doesn’t believe it
should see the Poison Flower series of delicately-
tinted pictures reeling past without a tremor.

Spencer’s Theatrescope, at Sydney Ly-
ceum, is still parading the rather dreary Harry
Lauder—the ruffian who receives £lOOO per week
for singing inane songs in dialect and kilts. To
writer’s mind Lauder is not a patch on Albert
Whelan as a humorist, and the chronomegaphone
does him proud. The pictures are nicely arranged
—first the dramatic, then the bellowdramatic,
followed by the scenic, and last the bitterly
satirical and wildly humorous films. Manager
Spencer has a good taste in satire.

Mr. Philip Newbury is back in Sydney
with his precious tenor possession intact. That
most valuable article he will lift at the
Y.M.C.A. Hall on Saturday evening (17th), and
every Saturday following until further notice. A
posy of accomplished artists will appear with him
—Miss Amy Murphy, and Messrs. Cyril Monk,
Gladstone Bell and Sykes. The best music of the
modern operatic class is promised.
*r m * *
Miss Amy Murphy’s fine soprano made
the Sydney Liedertafel’s second concert of extra
worth. In the “ Shadow Song ” and “ Norwegian
Echo” warble the Maorilander justified the words
of praise spoken of her from time to time. Messrs.
Emil Sussmilch and C. Larsen were the other
vocalists. Conductor Arundel Orchard drove his
orchestra to victory on a number of attractive
items. The first performance of Mr. Howard
Carr’s Choric Ode, “The Bush,” was the
centrepiece of interest. The poem by Mr.
Frank Fox shows Nature in a reverent,
tranquil mood. There are no dancing orgies
of sound in the Carr composition, no birds,
no waterfalls, no bush fires. The composer keeps
to the key set by the verse, and in that there are
no sounds but those of dreary winds. The poet
should really have introduced a bird and some
locusts, and thus have given the composer a
chance to be less dirge-like. There are doubt-
less high thoughts and “ immortal longings ” in
the composition, but the average human ears
can’t detect them.

Sydney cadets and scouts and footballers
and young sports generally of from 10 to 20 years,
have given their verdict on the performances,
outdoor and indoor, of the visiting American
Boys. As the verdict is favorable, the carper
who sits within an office, or the sport who has
reached thenit admirari age of 25, may do thePy tha-
goreau act. The forty-boy team consists of picked
members of a San Franciscan boys’ club founded
by Major Peixotto, who accompanies his charges.
They are the sons of working parents, and
though all of them were burnt out of house
and home by the big fire of a few years agone,
they are in no sense of the waif class. On Satur-
day night the Californian boys gave an entertain-
ment at the Town Hall, Music (band and vocal),
wrestling, boxing, human pyramiding,, and the
“Axe Rally,” made up the programme. An
ordinary wood-axe. decorated with the colors of a
Californian football club, would seem to have
some of the charm of Henry of Navarre’s white
turkey helmet. In the knightly days of some years
ago the Leland-Stanford University, blown with
pride and corn cakes, carried an axe into the
field of muddied oafdom as an emblem of victory.
The Californians reft it from the owners, but they
carry the mascot into the open only on big game
occasions. A wrestling-match was the star item
of the personal encounter description, and a bari-
tone of twelve sang popular ballads and sacred
songs with a beautiful voice. The youngsters
will appear at the Town Hall again during the
week.

The Playgoers’ Club will break out at
Sydney Royal Standard on the evening of Wednes-
day (14th) in a new Australian comedy in four
acts, “The Love Affairs of Mr. Boyd,” by Agnes
Chambers, which will be preceded by a curtain-
raiser, “A Quiet Little Dinner,” by J. C. Lee.
The show will be brightened up considerably by
the appearance of that well-known young Aus-
tralian actor, Mr. Fred Francis. The only Mr.
Boyd this paper ever knew was a shocking man
for platonic affairs with ladies, and if it is.his love
adventures that are to be portrayed—well, the play
should be delirious.

Sydney Tivoli this week has no new star
wherewith to blind its faithful patrons and arouse
the whistles of the shrill peanut gods: The enter-
tainment just now is at a moderate glow, the
brightest streaks being supplied by Rosina
Casselli and her dogs,- R. H. Douglas of the
monologues, the acrobatic Laurels, and Cissie
Curlette. Florence and Lillian (the girl musicians); :
Guest and Newlyn, and Graham and Dent also
contribute to the general illumination, and a num-
ber of lesser lights are present, some of which are
not much more than embers. In the fulness of
time, no doubt, a supply of fresh fireworks will
arrive.

The three weeks of “A .Royal Divorce”
are gliding along profitably at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s. For people who have already witnessed
that untruthful historical melodrama once or
twice the present revival has no attraction, except
in the fact that Julius Knight, as he grows
heavier, approaches nearer to the popular concep-
tion of an over-stomached emperor. Some of the
lines that he has to speak are absurdly un-
Napoleonie, and familiarity breeds further dis-
respect for them. His new empress Marie
Louise (Miss Elsie Wilson) has no ancient-family
manner of firing off her impossible remarks ; nor
is Miss Beatrice Day sufficiently dramatic in her
expression of injuned feelings. Josephine, as she
presents the childless matron, is much too English
to be convincing. She is only coldly emotional,

The S. Aus.- Labor party managed to hang
on to late Premier Price's seat, though it had a
hard fight for it. Still, Ryan’s narrow majority
over Cooke doesn’t make matters much better for
Premier Peake, because Cooke doesn’t belong to
Peake’s Liberal party. Peake’s parlous condition
is very well illustrated by the fact that he didn’t
venture to run a candidate of his own, but con-
tented himself with smiling on Cooke from a dis-
tance. He knows that he can’t get Ryan’s
vote, but in the confused whirl of S. Aus. politics,
something might happen which would give him
Cooke’s. And now he hasn’t got even that off-
chance running for him.
The uncertainty of the wicket at test
troubles appears to be, the chief factor governing
results. But if the wicket, cricket or otherwise,
be too moist, the best offset is to whet one’s
powers to their keenest edge by a little wet of
D.C.L. —the scholarly brand. A small trickle of
D.G.L. Whisky often converts an otherwise cause
of damp disaster into a sunny outburst of success,*
and nicely correct. The audience never gets
thoroughly shaken up by the present performance,
but the play and its tableaux are new to many of
them, and somehow “A Royal Divorce” has
acquired a reputation which it doesn’t deserve. It
will run until the end of next week, when Hugh
Ward and co. come along with “ A Bachelor’s
Honeymoon.”

“ White Australia ” scored a full house on
its second Saturday at Melbourne King’s.
Patriotism is laid on with a trowel, and corpses
are numbered by the dozen in Randolph Bedford’s
rugged drama. Also the deceased patriots are
covered with the new flag of Australia, which
sacred emblem has, seemingly, commended itself
to the Andersonian public as being a healthful
contrast to the dear old Union Jack of many an
imported shocker. And, in addition to its senti-
ment, the work of Randolph has three or four
character sketches that help to keep it going.
Temple Harrison, as the old swagman who swears
by ’Enry Parkes, is a popular feature; likewise
Bailey, the blackfellow, and his aboriginal Topsy,
and the young men whose early deaths are
avenged by the crew of the airship. Now that its
roughest edges have been filed down, “White
Australia ” is accepted as a well-meant piece of
audacity as well as a reckless expenditure of gun-
powder. Although woefully weak in woman in-
terest, it might, at least, have been supplied with
a stronger leading lady than the misnamed Miss
Vigors, but the author can find some consolation
in the fact that his young daughter, Miss Bed-
ford, who cut a very poor figure on the first night,
has already learned how to take her little part
winsomelv.

At Melbourne Royal this is the last
night of “The Hypocrites.” The mighty out-
break of the 500-ton guns from Britain is not due
before next week, and in the meantime there will
be five nights of “A Miner’s Trust,” by J. Smith,
of Australia. Then the house will be closed two
nights for rehearsals of “ The Taming of the
Shrew,” with Oscar Asche and Miss Lily Brayton
as Mr. and Mrs. Petruchio.
“ THE KING OF CADONIA,” AT HER
MAJESTY’S, MELBOURNE.
CLAYTON as the
King.
BERT GILBERT
as the Heir
Presumptive.
The fourth Saturday of “The King of
Cadonia” found Her Majesty’s crowded to the
utterm.ost seats. A little cloud of doubt that
hovered'abo ve the horizon what time “ Cadonia ”
was quite new to Melbourne has disappeared
during the past fortnight. Probably it resolved
itself into rain. Anyhow, this somewhat different
musical comedy seems good for a’ long stay at its
present address, and Bert Gilbert has added
another verse to his touching song, entitled “Do
not hesitate to shoot.” The terms of this ditty
demand the instant assassination of women who
wear the Merry Widow hat at a matinee, and other
obstructive citizens of both sexes. It reminds
one of “ The Mikado ” and the little list of suit-
able punishments for selected offenders, and like
many other things that happen in Act 1., it im-
proves on acquaintance.
Next Saturday (10th) Melbourne Bijou
will return to theatrical business under the direc-
tion of Allen Doone, an American-Irish “singing
comedian and actor,’’who is incidentally a per-
former on Irish war-pipes. The first outlet for
his varied accomplishments will be “Sweet
County Kerry,” wherein he will be supported by
Miss Edna Keeley and a company of 30. Aus-
tralia has been carefully sized up by Mr.
Doone, he says. He reckons that the people of
this country “don’t want slap-stick comedy or
any scenery chewing,” but something that is “all
plain and straight.” He was formerly a co-star
with another Irish comedian who now stands
behind a cheque for 4,000,000 dollars, and the
piece in which he is about to appear at the Bijou
was one of the valuable properties he took over
from the millionaire in question.

ball and a gentleman of the tattered tramp per-

trick-cycling; but their joint “turn”hasnot shifted
Cinquevalli from the centre of the bill. The
juggler in his juggles and his by-play with his
cbmic attendant is a decorative artist, to whom
the bill is under adeep obligation for his presence

Miss Ola Humphrey .put in a final week at
Adelaide Royal before leaving Australia. Kollter
had gone earlier, Greenaway taking his place in
“ After the Ball” and “ An Englishman’s Home.”
The final weekwas devoted to “ The Silver King,”
wjith Walter Bentley as the monarch. He was at
his'best in the first scene, as a bearded reveller,,
repentant in his cups; in fact, he showed a
resemblance quite realistic to some local
politicians of the bad old days. The ancient
melodrama is new to this generation, and its
simple pathos and robust comic relief found
gi-eat favor.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“H. llardup”: “Aladdin,” which is to be the next
Williainsonian panto., made his last appearance in Sydney
at the Royal in February, 1902, under the direction of
Geo. Musgrove. The life-story 7 of the famous Asiatic
fizzled out after a brief career. Yet it was a
gorgeous affair, with many enchanting views of Chow-
Land and Japan by Goatcher and Coleman. The
Gothams, who carried the fun of it on their backs,
w 7 ere happier when united in quaint part singing than on
their little alones, from which cause “ Aladdin ” suffered.
Furthermore Nellie Stewart, who was “principal boy”,
during’ the Melbourne run, handed over the tights of
Aladdin for the Harbor City campaign to Rose Hamilton,
a capable Fogland artiste, but not a Nellie Stewart. The
panto. w r as also heavily weighted by J. Hickory Wood’s
“book,” which was as thick and heavy as his name.
Cheerful spots in the show were the clever w 7 ork of Ada
Willoughby (as “ principal girl ”), and the embryo efforts
of Celia Ghiloni and Lilian Boanas, two young Aus-
tralians who in subsequent years did well. Pansy
Montague, La Milo of modern and more prosperous days,
gured in this show in the paltry part of San Hoi.
The forthcoming Amy Castles re-visit to Australia has
inspired a new crop of picturesque yarns about the future
career of Amy as a grand-opera “ star.” One story is
quite a masterpiece of managerial skill. It states that
Caruso heard Miss Castles sing the prayer from “ La
Tosca,” whereupon he was so transported with delight
that he invited composer Puccini to meet the young Aus-
tralian, and Puccini besought her to warble in his opera
as soon as possible. Unfortunately she had already
engaged with J. and N. Tait for an Australian concert
tour, so the earnest request of Puccini had to be declined.
But she regards it as “ the most graceful compliment
ever paid to her singing.” Thus far nothing has been
heard about King Edward’s royal admiration for Miss
Castles’ voice, but the cable may be expected to open
out on that theme ere the lady leaves Europe lamenting.
He can hardly let her go until she has promised him to
prima donna in grand opera sooner or later. Also the
ghosts of Verdi and Gounod will probably add their mute
appeals to the inducement.
John Wren is strongly 7 interested in a proposal to start
a “ labor” co-operative brewery in Melbourne. The wire-
pullers refer to him as “ someone ” who is prepared to put
£60,000 (the same old £50,000) into the business, if he has
a controlling voice in the appointment of the directors.
Wren’s enthusiasm for the cause of Labor is as great as
that of the parson in “The Hypocrites.’’ Not content
with supplying the working man with pure pony-racing,
he now wants to supply him with pure beer.
“ Skull ” : Clarke, Meynell and Gunn start Oscar Asche
and the beautiful Lily'Brayton with “The Taming of the
Shrew ”at Melbourne Royal. Only a few months back
we had “ The Taming of the Shrew ” at Melbourne
Majesty’s, with Miss Anglin as the star. Of course, Asche
and his leading lady are a big pair, with a lot of reputa-
tion behind them, but Miss Anglin was also no small
goods, and this may prove a little too much Shrew.
“ Melbournian ” : Mr. Bert Gilbert’s physique enables
him to exactly reproduce the Parisian Apache. He is a
curious animal, with a pallor hardly to be seen outside
Paris. It comes of absinthe and living in the abyss. Miss
Sargent’s Apachienne is rather a mixture. The female
Apache, like her Ape, is of platinum tenuity, vulpine,
aquiline, pallid and tall, with a cheeky cockspur of a curl,
exactly reproduced by Miss Mistigouche, or some such
name, in West’s Picture of “The Red Hand.” The
Apache gent, there is palpably an imitation—a mere deft,
agile, sinuous dancer—not the living Apache of Gilbert,
in his appropriate black blouse, black trousers, and the
little flat cap that is never to be seen out of the Moulin
Rouge and Chat Noir Quartier. Once I mixed for weeks
with a great city’s nearest approach to the Apache class.
I donned the right clobber, crabshells, cady, and stuke —
that is the red neck-handkerchief affected by the low
women of Paris, and by the low y-oung men, to
a large extent, of most other cities. Observe
how Gilbert pulls Lottie Sargent by the stuke.
The dance at Her Majesty’s is exactly the same as on
West’s Biograph. It is a theatrical concoction, ap-
parently 7 suggested by 7 the theatrical dances of London
costers. As a matter of fact, the Apaches don’t dance.
What is the origin of the word “Apache?” It was
applied to the most ferocious tribe of American Red
Indians. They did their scalp dance in the South-West.
General Phil Sheridan, then only a captain before the
Civil War, was in charge of the territory roughly marked
out as Arizona, and won his earliest slight celebrity fight-
ing the Apaches. The name was applied by French and
Spanish settlers. lam convinced it is old French.
Villon would have been able to give you the meaning.
The word is never used for “ larrikin ” in America. The
Parisian Apache is an inevitable criminal, ready for any -
thing up to homicide. Analyse other kindred names ap-
plied in various cities. None have an absolutely criminal
signification. The worst class were the former old Sydney
boys, the Rocks Push, and the like of them. The larrikin
is only monkey-mischievous. Take American and
English by-words. “ Hoodlum ” is a kid to be flogged ;
“ plug-ugly,” a dangerous stousher. The “ tough "is
only 7 a rough. The “ hooligan ”is just a yahoo. “ Tug ”
may almost be a term of affection, a mere “ barriker,”
which is an old London word.
“ 10-2-4” writes : “O.K.,”in commenting (24/6/’O9) on
a recent par. of mine in this column, smites the imported
Andersonian drama a cruel and unjust smite in what it
would consider a particularly tender spot. Also, incident-
ally, he misjudges me. “O.K. ” alleges (1) that dramas
of the above sort are guilty, equally with the home-
brewed articles, of supplydng the British noblemen who
infest them with absurdly incorrect and impossible titles ;
(2) that I “ forget ” the “ fact.” But it isn’ta fact. Dur-
ing the last two years I have, in the course of my duties,
attended every 7 imported Andersonian drama that has
opened in this city of Sy'dney, and I don’t think I missed
many of the diverting things in the days when it wasn’t
my 7 business to attend them.. In none of them was
any Briton of rank labelled with a title calculated to
bring a word of protest even from the class which “ 0.K.”
brightly 7 terms “ hades-de-kong.” The reason for this is
plain. The British melodrama, particularly the sort
which Bilanderson exploits, is written and staged in its
country of origin, with an eye, almost entirely 7, to
audiences made up of servant maids and shop girls and
their y 7 oung men associates, which latter are mostly male
servitors and shopwalkers. These people are brought into
constant relation with the titled folk of Britain, and know
all about them. They wouldn’t so much as cavil at the
spectacle of Napoleon I. represented as the contemporary
and beer-friend of the late Ahrimanes McPhairson, of
Greece {Circa 530 8.C.), but face them with a mis-titled
hero or heroine of the bulldog breed, and they would, as
likely as not, rise up furiously and do a mischief to the
management or destroy the big orchestral drum. You
may find banalities in plenty in imported British plays of
the bellowdrama class, but incorrectly-styled Debrett
residents—never. As well expect the Bohemian mime
who hangs out near Paddy’s market, which is over against
Sydney’s Railway Station, to make erroneous reference
from the stage to his old-time acquaintance, the
Owe’Sullivan.
“ Bloggs”: Beerbohm Tree, who endured knighthood
the other day, is, unlike the majority of mummers,
something of a humorist in his own robustious way.
It is very much the way of Toole in days gone by. Toole,
in a wildly hilarious moment, went into a draper’s shop
ahd demanded a pound of nails. Tree took a friend to
the counter of the Bank of England and called loudly for
“Two whiskies and sodas, please.” The next wildly
original British stage humorist will probably go to Oxford
University and clamor to be allowed to purchase a dog
biscuit. There is a great sameness about this sort of
mirth.
“E.D.”: I went to the public meeting in Melbourne
Town Hall called to consider the idea of a Repertory
company with £4OOO behind it and an ambition to pro-
duce theatrical masterpieces in Melbourne and Sydney 7.
Never did I meet with a united body that seemed less
aware of what it was about, or less capable of expressing
its awareness if it really 7 were cognisant of its own inten-
tions. There was a speech from John Madden to the
effect that the purification of the stage was desirable, and
the chief engineer of the scheme, Mackinnon, M.L.A.,
declared that it had missionary intentions and virtuous
aspirations. Recollecting that it is always the master-
pieces, and not the pornographic comic opera or the
morbid tripe drama, that provokes the riotous indig-
nation of the holy 7, I approached Chief-Engineer
Mackinnon for particulars on this point, instanc-
ing the fact that if the Repertory company is
to assume a sanctified attitude it will deny itself much of
Ibsen, most of the modern Germans, and the new and
improving Russians. He gasped twice and went away.
I spoke to other prominent features to the same effect,
and they murmured “Shakspeare” in a vague sort of
wav, apparently with the exasperating belief that when
William is reverently mentioned nothing more remains to
be discussed in the million-acre field of dramatic art.
Now if the records of the last ten years in Australia were
thoroughly sifted, I believe it would be found that no in-
dividual dramatist scores over the said Bill in the number
of presentations. We in Melbourne had a little Shaks-
bacon from Miss Anglin a few weeks ago ; a few weeks
hence Asche gives us more Beaconspeare. Heroic
adventurers in art, whose ideas of a thrilling de-
parture from conventional stage entertainment
revolve around productions of Shakspeare, are not
very noisily demanded even by the intellectual minority 7,
especially as the gallant exploiters’ purity of
ideals will bind them to the usual bartered, bathed,
scraped, and sterilised, over-dressed, over-painted, half-
Shakspearean play, the authors of which are really Tailor
and Cutter. Another important matter the promoters
knew 7 nothing about was the housing of their dramas. If
they take a big Williamson theatre their little venture is
likely to be torn asunder with a tremendous rent. The
small, comparatively cheap, easy and accessible domicile
necessary to success in such an enterprise is nowhere
visible. On the whole, the project looks as if it didn’t
clearly know w here it are.
“ Locust ” : Apropos of nothing in particular. When
is Melba going to discover a soprano? Her flair for
mezzo-sopranos and contraltos is marvellous. And, by
the way, is it a fact that Marchesi has not been finding
sopranos for years? Said that she even wanted to train
Castles—the possessor of an ideal soprano voice—as a
rpezzo. A cynical friend of mine in London used to say
that for many years Marchesi had “cornered” sopranos,
and wasn’t going to train any more, in the interests of
half-a-dozen of her pupils who had “arrived.” But he
was probably a liar. Such commercial methods could
never intrude into high Art.
Oldest Inhabitant: In writing- up the 70th anniversary
of the foundation of the Melbourne Club (B. l/7/’O9) no
mention was made of certain ali night sittings which
occurred there in the ’sixties. There was a certain sport-
ing captain who lived at the Club, and by him, it was
said, many pigeons were plucked. He presided at the
midnight “soirees” with much profit to himself. Walter
Montgomery, the actor, was an honorary, member for a
month, and made night hideous with his war-whoops.
He presumed, of course, on his position as chief toady to
the Duke of Edinburgh, and the toadies of the club put up
with him in consequence. The staid old squatters, who
liked their ease and comfort, complained bitterly that
Montgomery 7 was unfit to associate with man or beast.
An impudent theatrical fraud is being perpetrated in
up-country towns by somebody who signs his circular
“J. and N. Tait, per G. Williamson,” and the Taits are
naturally anxious to give the fraud all possible exposure.
From Cowra The Bulletin has received a typewritten
letter, which was addressed to every considerable
“ Sir” or “ Madam ” in the district, and which set .forth
the following :
“ Messrs. J. and N. Tait have much pleasure in inform-
ing you that they are presenting in Cowra, for the first
time in Australia, Mr. Francis Frohman’s complete com-
pany of entertainers ; in particular Madam Minetti, Miss
Madeleine Carr, etc. The enclosed circular gives a full
list of the company,” etc.
The alleged Frohmann company of entertainers has pre-
sumably been inflicted upon other places than Cowra
“ for the first time in Australia,” and if it is still travel-
ling under the pretence of being a Tait show, the
imaginative manager is likely to get into trouble. Who
steals the name of a recognised showman steals his credit.
Toby, the big elephant of Wirth’s Circus, who seems
harmless enough in the ring, and makes himself other-
wise useful in helping to push and shove the Circus along,
has distinguished himself some more by killing a roan
with whom he was engaged in shunting trucks at Chil-
ders (Queensland). This is understood to be Toby’s sixth
indiscretion of the kind. From time to time the gigantic
beast has a “ derry ” on a particular person, or is seized
with a desire to deal with the nearest human object he
can reach. The result is a funeral, and a paragraph in
the newspapers. One night Toby will get mad whilst
being bothered to make an exhibition of himself in the
ring ; then there will be a panic and lots of funerals.
Meanwhile the joke grows monotonous. Toby is all
the same as a cold-blooded murderer who is never brought
to justice.
“Theorbo”: Henry Conried, the most daring operatic
impresario ever known, died in the Tyrol a little while
ago. He first won his spurs as an actor at the Vienna
Burg Theater. He went to Bremen, and then became
manager of the Germania Theatre, New York. Passed
on to the more important Thalia, and next became man-
ager of the Irving Place Theatre. He gave unrivalled
presentations of German dramatic art, with Barnay, Son-
nenthal, etc. Next he dived into opera and brought all
the magnificence of Wagner’s Bayreuth over to the New
York Metropolitan. He had a fierce battle with Cosimo
Wagner over the composer’s last work, “Parsifal.”
Wagner had ordered that it should not be performed out
of Bayreuth. However, Conried laid sacrilegious hands
on it —of course, with immense difficulty—and produced
it in America amid a storm of indignation. After all, it
didn’t pay. Conried’s paraphernalia was in San Francisco
at the time of the earthquake and fire. This pretty well
knocked him out. Hammerstein’s opposition, at the
New York Manhattan, was too keen. He secured Melba,
which was a blow to Conried. The Caruso affair was
also untoward. Conried and Hammerstein were both
Jews. Almost everybody- seems to be a Jew.
“ Vaudevillain ” : Manager Butt, of the London Palace,
expounds things in the Strand Magazine. Takings last,
year were over £lOO,OOO, half being profit. Butt books
from 200 to 300 turns each year. Has engaged consider-
ably over 1000 artistes in his five years’ management. He
is anxious to give ever.vone a trial, lest his rivals should
snap up good people. On a file he has the week’s pro-
gramme of every important music hall in France, Ger-
many, Spain, and Russia. He admits making great mis-
takes, both in refusing performers and engaging tliem.
Audiences are unaccountably' variable. Their taste will
be quite different one night and the next. “ You may 7
stigmatise an Italian duet at rehearsal as rotten, but at
night there is a bewitchingly handsome girl, in a dress
that is a dream of Paris, singing to a handsome, daredevil
brigand on a brilliant, lighted stage with a pretty-
scene, ” and the audience is rapturous. Butt travels
immensely 7 . He scours all Europe and America, and it is
in America that he finds his most attractive talent. His
directors fully believe in the ancient saying that
the man who never made mistakes never made an.ything.
So they encourage him to take big risks, and don’t com-
plain if he puts them in a hole now and again. (They
shouldn’t, with 50 per cent, profit 1) Thus he engaged
Maud Allan in Paris, against the advice of the three chief
wiseacres of his acquaintance. That not overdressed
lady play'ed her first engagement in the Palace at a very
moderate salary, and returned about 1000 per cent, on
the investment. As an instance of the risks of the game,
he was strongly tempted in America to engage Marie
Dressier. She demanded enormous terms and a length
of engagement which would make her a terrific loss if she
failed. However, he took the chance, and she proved an
overwhelming success. Out of that success Marie- got
enlargement of the cranium, and afterwards visited
London again to manage for herself. And the father and
grandfather and uncle of all slumps ensued.
IMPERIALISM’S DARK HOUR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Senator Neild (N.S.W.) said that when the Labor
Government was in power there were things going on in
the Defence Department which were remarkable. If
there had not been a change of Government he would
have asked for a committee of inquiry 7. Mess jackets had
been ordered off. Cross-swords were abolished. An order
was made that box-spurs be removed.— Sydney Tele-
graph’s Parliamentary report, Z5/61’09.
It was a statesman-warrior,
Who reeled in blank despair,
And muttered broken words of woe
And tore his flowing hair.
For y 7 ears he’d helped to keep intact
The Empire and the Throne ;
By military methods, all
Unique, and all his own.
Each Empire Day he’d sally forth,
And in some public place
Howl re “the Motherland,” likewise
“ The Spirit of the Race,”
And “ silken bonds ” and “ loy 7 alty,”
And how the soundest way
To guard these shores was to bribe, hire,
Or subsidise, or pay,
To do the job a small, Cold Land
Across the rolling sea ;
Other Defence schemes he condemned
As wild insanity.
His views he inculcated oft
In Parliament ; also
At pubs, street-corners and the like ;
They served to stir a glow
Of patriotic fire, he said,
In ev’ry hearer’s heart,
By airing them he held he played
A grand and useful part.
In the Centennial Park, the while
The roar of musketry
Told that a battle was in train,
He argued ceaselessly.
To small Boy Scouts, cadets and such,
And callow volunteers,
He constantly 7 addressed himself,
Regardless of their jeers,
Expounding ever that the thing
To do was not to fight,
Or even dream of such a step,
But on the strength and might
Of distant Britain to rely
(For a fixed sum in cash),
And, meanwhile, wear glad soldier’s clothes,
And cut a howling dash.
Then came a time of misery,
A dark horrific day 7
When Labor \yon to office, and
Held temporary sway.
And straight the horrid Socialists
Began their loathly 7 schemes
To wreck the Empire ; Box-spurs ivent
Like unsubstantial dreams!
The Service barely 7 found itself
And its collective head,
When news was brought that all Cross-Swords
Had been abolish-eii.
The stricken warriors scarce had time
These weaponlets to doff
When one came weeping with the words,
“MESS JACKETS, TOO, ARE OFF !! ”
And then the statesman-warrior,
Mentioned above, went mad—
Perfectly mad, and swore out loud,
So that his friends grew sad.
Later he calmed himself, and said,
Cold venom in his eye,
“ For this attempt upon the Flag
Someone has got to die.”
At this stage, luckily (which fact
Without a single, doubt
Averted carnage) Labor fell —
Its Government went out.
ENVOY.
Yet still, when’er that time recurs
To memory, despair
Afflicts that statesman, and he moans
Of Dingoes who would tear
The Flag, and utters words of ivoe,
And rends his comely hair.

AN ENGLISHMAN’S HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The cot. was a detached one,
The suburb neat and clean,
And Dutch bulbs brightly gleamed upon
The small front-garden green.
The Swiss clock, hanging on the wall.
Ticked ever undismayed ;
The chamber floors were, one and all,
With Brussels carpet laid.
The busy housewife in her bower
Sang of the “ Zuyder Zee,”
And deftly mixed the foreign flour
With yeast from Germany 7 .
Upon the breakfast-table wide
Was spread in lavish plan
New Danish butter, side by side,
With ham Westphalian.
The lord his breakfast finished quite,
Then on his Yankee boot
He struck a Swedish match to light
A Mexican cheroot.
The news he then perused with zest,
But on the printed page
A something stirred his savage breast,
For he exclaimed in rage :
“ So dey’ll invade dis land divine !
Den tousands such as I,
Melchizedelc Von Jacobstein,
Vill know de reason vy.”

PENEOLD'S
WINES
“One of the ghastliest sights I ever saw
in London was that of nice English girls walking
with Babu law students, who hang about the
Temple.”— Australian Author- Journalist J. H. M.
Abbott.
Spence, M.H.R., created a streak of
excitement last week by getting up on his boot-
soles and stating that domestic servants who had
been brought from London to Sydney by the
N.S.W. Government had been driven on to the
streets through inability to find employment. The
statement, of course, was glaringly, ridiculouslyab-
surd, for all the servants imported up to date have
not even made a visible impression on the scarcity
of the domestic Mary Ann—or. rather, on the
almost complete impossibility of obtaining any
Mary Ann whatsoever. Any kind of female, even
if she has the countenance of a pirate and has
incompetence sticking out all over her, can get a
job as a servant for the asking these days. Of
course, some of the immigrants have probably
“gone wrong”; the tendency to take to the
oldest profession on earth appears inherent in a
certain proportion of every community. And
the girl who has taken to the most aged
occupation is much more likely to tell
Spence, M.H.R., that she was driven to it by
want of honest work than that she took to it out of
plain cussedness. But Spence, M.H.R., must be
so perfectly aware that the immigrant girl who
had just entered upon the most venerable
job in the globe’s surface was lying that
his repetition of her tale almost qualifies
him for membership in the Stinking Fish
family along with the people who circulated
the Six Hatters lie and the Petriana myth and the
tale about Labor’s alleged designs on the marriage
tie. And his yarn, unfortunately, gives color to
the Tory assertion that the Labor party is opposed
to all immigration, and would rather keep this
country empty and defenceless than share its ad-
vantages with any other persons whatsoever.
All the same, this paper hasn’t the least doubt
that some of Wade’s girl immigrants have taken
that turning to the left which leadeth unto the
Devil. It only made the acquaintance of one of
them, and the fact that she was probably
bound that way stuck out conspicuously. A
marvellously ill-selected immigrant she: was—a
Cockney maiden of the ’Arriet class, evidently
accustomed to some shabby-genteel occupation,
perky, uppish, conceited, ill-tempered, virulent,
scraggy, set off with cheap finery, and with a
blighted fowl in the hat that was cocked over one
eye. She admitted that she had never before
been a domestic help, but had passed herself off
as one in order to reach this Land of Promise.
She spoke a curious lingo which is difficult to re-
produce, and she was bitterly offended. “ I hev
been a week in this dreadful country,” she said,
“ and find I hev been deceived. It is a shameful
thing. The Gov’ment ’ll be made to pay my
passage back. I am Hinglish and not used to
these colonial people. I hev been cjicated, but in
spite of my ejication I am willing to work. lam not
afraid of werk. But these colonial girls hev no
respect for an cjicated Hinglish girl, and I will
not werk with them.” Boiled down it appeared
that the passionate little person with the scraps of
finery bought in the Mile End Road had taken a
billet in a large hotel, and the other girls had
treated her cheerfully and off-handedly as one
of themselves, thereby blighting her dignity and
making her position intolerable. It didn’t seem
possible to do anything about her grievance, so
she carried it away with her. Judging by her
appearance, the chances are that when she left
The Bulletin office she went straight to Flossie-
dom with some vague idea of thereby throwing
on society the full moral responsibility for the
way it had treated her. Possibly it was she who
met Spence, M.H.R., and poured her shriek of
woe into his credulous hearing-machinery. If the
girl Spence met said that she had been driven on
the streets by lack of werk, then she was the same
girl. Like Peter of Galilee, who was reproached
by the male fowl, her speech gave her away.

From Westralia conies the sequel to a
marriage between a white woman and an Afghan,
The woman’s two brothers happened to drop in
and found their sister on the floor being leaped
upon by her large, heavy husband. He then
started to make good progress at strangling one
brother, when the other brought wood down on
his head, aud his spirit fled across the bridge of
Al-Sirat. A jury acquitted the brothers of a
charge of murder, but they want no more Afghans
in the family.
A BOOM IN THE PROFESSION.

POVERTY POINTER: “ Another of us knighted, dear boy!"
“F.C.” stands out in the wet and moral-
ises :
Less than three months ago people jumped across the
Goulburn River at Shepparton (Vic.); a few days ago, to
the west of the town, the stream was two miles wide. In
this district the State has'done marvellous work. Stretch-
ing away to Mooroopna, the main road winds 10ft.
above the swirling torrents. This road is 20ft. wide on
top, and 50ft. at the water line. The Public Works
Department got busy at once and kept that road safe and
open. Also it guarded eight)' miles of canal banks, from
Shepparton to the Murray, night and day, thoug'h where
no damage could be done the pent-up waters were let out
to lessen the strain on the banks. Everywhere those
liable to danger were warned, and thus no lives and but
little stock were lost. But though no stock to speak of
were lost, the waste in other ways has been appalling.
Looking across those monotonous miles of water —water
that will be needed so badly only six months hence—one
thinks hopelessly of the many gorges and gullies higher
up the rivers where tens of millions of gallons of the
precious fluid could be locked at comparatively trifling
cost, to be drawn on when the inevitable drought comes
in less, perhaps, than a year. Nature in Australia is a
shockingly poor manager, providing a feast to-day and a
famine to-morrow ; and even after all these years the
State has only half-learned to store up in the feast time
against the days of drought.

There are some extraordinarily casual
people in Maoriland. A few weeks ago a man
was charged at Dunedin with firing a number of
revolver shots into his sweetheart. She wasn’t
killed, but that was only due to luck. The girl’s
father told the Court that he was in the next room
when the row waft on. He could tell by the ton-
nage of the preliminary quarrel that things were
pretty sultry, but he thought it best to mind his
own business. When the bullets began to fly he
still minded his own business. Another casual
parent —though he doesn’t appear able to concen-
trate his attention on his own affairs like the first
one—has been discovered in Wellington. Two
very young people, who had just been married by
the registrar, were apprehended on the Manuka
as it was starting for Sydney, and charged
with making false declarations. In the Court
the girl’s alleged father said, “as near as
he could say” the girl was 18 years
The old landmark known as the Gap Inn,
"at Watson's Bay (Sydney) is doomed. Old age
and the white ants have got at it, and the Muni-
cipal Council, which held its meetings there, has
decided on its demolition. In 1857 the ship
Dunbar was wrecked almost within beer-throw of
the old house. Daniel Egan, a well-known
politician and Minister, lost his wife and
a portion of his family in the wreck. In 1870 Dan
Egan died in the premises that are now about to
be demolished.
old, but he really could not tell for certain. He
did not know exactly what his own name was—he
only knew what his supposed father had told him.
Nor was he quite sure that the female accused was
his daughter. He had married a certain woman
some years ago, but he would not like to say (the
magistrate told him he need not) whether he had
or had not another wife living at the time. The
former woman—if there was such a person —was
not now alive, and was the wife of another man
when she died, and he wasn’t quite sure when she
did die. Anyhow, she was not the mother of the
girl. He had once gone through the Roman
Catholic form of marriage with the girl’s mother,
and “that satisfied her.” Witness said that in
the certificate of the girl’s birth some of the state-
ments were true and some weren’t. Anyhow, he
could not read it just then, because he had left his
spectacles at home. The magistrate passed the
puzzle oh to a jury.

The ship Leicester Castle which last
week sagged, into Auckland (M.L.), at the
end of a tow line, translates, some of the seismo-
graph’s recent earthquake scrawls into plain
English. The Leicester Castle left Monte Video
on April 12, bound for Newcastle (N.S.W.). Eight
days after leaving port, the Castle was blowing
along through a moderate sea ’when an immense
body of water, like an exaggerated Great Wall of
China, swept up from the horizon. Then the ship
fell over oh res side, and stared at the sky in a sickly,
one-eyed way,, until the vast heap of ocean rushed
away from underneath it,and allowed it to slide
down again to theriormal level of the sea. Then the
staggered mariners: took .hold once more, and
brought the vessel up to its course. Before the
ocean takes off its boots and blows out the candle,
it should look under its bed to see if there’s an
earthquake there. The violent upheaval that
takes place when it leaps in horror from its calm
repose presents the daily paper with a paragraph
and the seismograph man with a jagged record.;
but it merely gives the poor salt a bad fright and
a shaking. And the salt is entitled to a little
consideration. _ > , q
THE ANSWER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Archdeacon Gunther hoped young Australians would
in future look on the bright side of things, for he must
confess that in a country with every advantage there
was a great deal of pessimism to be found. Instead of
pessimists they should all he optimists. “ Why were
they not?” the Vicar-General queried.
Well-
In the first place there is Hell,
As the parsons always tell:
How the dickens can one optimise with wowsers on the
yell?
With their weird “ hypnotic spell,”
And their candle, book and bell
Don’t they preach the Brimstone Gospel and the Woe
because we “ fell ”
Don’t thej' toll an awful knell
For the soul we seek to “sell ”
To the Devi] (poor old chappie!) with his horns and
sulphur smell.
Who lives underneath Earth’s shell ?
As if one could still look cheerful while the parsons
hollered “ Hell! ”
Then, again :
We are threatened with a pain
And our aching heads are buzzing and our eyes are on
the strain,
As we look—and look in vain—
For a tnan with heart and brain
Who will fight with might and main
For Australia—one who’ll rain
Room and ruin on the train
Of Fat Landlords, who’re the bane
Of our country ! Holy Jane !
How the Deuce can one look happy while the Landsharks
still remain !
Then there’s Wade !
I’m afraid
Here to call a spade a spade
(In the Great Waste Paper Basket soon these verses
would be laid !)
But I’d love to have a go
At Wade, Wowser, Wood and Go.,
And by dint
Of cold print
Bring that bunch of Insects low !
They have made good old “ New South ”
.Tust a bye-word in the mouth,
From the Leeuwin up to Louth,
And her credit is brought low.
And they “gas ”
About Yass
Like one vast, collective Ass—
We have reached a pretty pass,
Thanks to Wade!
How the angels can we optimise and look serenely bright
When a horde of Gnats perch on us every morning, noon
and night !
While they buzz and they bite
And annoy with all their might—
Vainly trying to extinguish the Nation’s growing light ?
How in thunder shall we cheer up and take a joyful view
Of our monstrous IO U ?
Who the Devil could be happy with the Wade-Wood-
Waddell crew ?
Last, the press—
Yes, oh yes !
There’s our awful daily Press ;
The “bright side ” of the papers is a black and inky mess.
How in Hades can we sparkle when we watch their
“ leaders ” darkle
Every question that’s around us,
Seeking only to confound us?
When we mark their zeal to baulk us.
And their haste to overtalk us,
Their affection for the alien,
And their hate of things Australian !
Their joy in retrogression,
And their lying and suppression,
Their worship of stale flummery
And idiotic mummery—
When We notice these things daily
How the Deuce can we sing gaily?
How in Sheol raise a paean
When we cannot “ raise ” a bean ?. .. .
Great Gunther, vicar reverend,
If you these things will ever end
We’ll join your happy, happy creed,
And all be optimists with speed
We will— we will — we will, indeed !

A Woman’s Vote—Result
When our Australian women exercise the
franchise, it is a foregone conclusion that
the women’s vote will be on the side of
progress—quality and not quantity of mem-
bers. We see it in everyday life—there
are three women to-day using Sunlight
Soap for laundry and housework to one
using any other soap in the world. Why?
because women quickly recognise quality,
and the progress effected by the Sunlight
way of washing described on the cardbox of

Edward No. 7 got a severe backhander m
the last days of the Chapzander mission from ft
religious enthusiast into whose charge \ the
dervishes had commended a reclaimed Sydney
pugilist-burglar. The enthusiast; ere leading l his>
prize from the broad Town Hall on to the straight
and stuffy path, remarked that he would rather ,
be in the convert’s company than in that of the.
King. Of course, that may not he his real opinion

brand snatched from the burglary caused- him to
skid a little on the unfamiliar path of otatory.
But it is fortunate that Edward No. 7 was’ not at
the meeting; the most deeply religious
might reasonably object to such a violent com-
parison—even supposing the repentant house-
breaker had been a combination of Raffles arid
Jim Jeffries. The fact that St. Jemmy had been
somewhat of a failure in both his sinful professions
would have justified even a lightweight sovereign
in hitting him hard on the head with the sceptre.

that they may think things over calmly.
“ J.” : In “ The Great Victorian Age,.”
by M. B. Synge, I have been reading that
V the Eton 'boys had but one bath a term; and
that was the .night before they returned Horne for
the holidays.” Which reminds me that, sani-
tarily speaking, things aren’t very different how
in; the ’Omeland. No English public schodl-boy
“tubs” oftener than once a week. He isn’t
allowed to. In some of the great English public
schools, like Eton and Hay-
row, the weekly wash hap-
pens on F lid ay night; (in
other, on Saturday night.
Many of the great Ox-
ford colleges are still
absolutely with o ut
bathrooms. If the un-
dergraduate wants a
wash all over he has to
rely on the where-
withal being brought
to his bedroom in a
tin. The yarn about
the Englishman’s
“tub” arose out of the
fact that there were no
bathrooms. If the
English student had
rudimentary ideas of
cleanliness he kept a
sort of wash-tub in his
room, and bribed an at-
tendant to bring up some
water. The attendant had
to be bribed, for bringing up
water was no part of any
regular attendant’s business.
The rarity of the thing caused the “tub” to
occupy a large* space in English literature. Ten
years ago a hot bath apparatus was introduced to
University College, which is the oldest and one
of the richest colleges at Oxford, and the innova-
tion caused a stir,of doubt and misgiving that is
remembered locally to this day. For years I have
been reading in novels and the press of the Briton’s
scrupulous cleanliness, but always with a good
deal of cynical disbelief. As a result of experi-
ence, I class the tales of the Briton’s passion for
removing grime from himself with the yarns abour
battles which were won pn playing fields, and
wild statements regarding “overwhelming de-
sires ” to giveaway Dreadnoughts, and all of them
I regard as apocryphal.
Victoria continues to make discoveries
regarding the abominable Condition of its starved
State school buildings; Besides those recently
condemned ’by shire council officers, the one at
Quarry Hill (Bendigo) is in such a state of dis-
repair, that the parents have gone “on strike,”
and.defy the Department to prosecute, them for
keeping their children away from pneumonia and
other ills ; while the hut at St. Leonards, near
Portarlington, is so dilapidated that its shingle
roof lets in the sun in summer and the rain in
winter. Repeated complaints have been made
about these premises; but the Departmental idea
apparently is that, having been mostly built out
of borrowed money, they must necessarily be per-
manent works, and not subject to ordinary laws
relating to moth and rust and decay.
Sydney Evening News rages because the
jury recommended to mercy John Frederick
Crook, the North Shore burglar who unloaded a
couple of bullets into Mr. Sinclair, the owner of
the house. Rarely does an unsuccessful attempt
to murder lead to the gallows. The N.S. W. cases
in which it has done so of late years) are very few,
and such attempts are not now punished with
death in England. .Crook is young years),
and he denied before the Court that he intended
murder. Some newspapers, however, cultivate a
professional love for executions. Such hoyrors
are easy copy, they yield flaring headlines and
lead to “ speshal dishorns.” The boy can be taken
from the paste-pot to “ drof the picters,” with a
cross indicating “’Ere’s the spot where the bluggy
deed wor dong,’’ arid so on. It’s cheap work, and,
as deceased Alfred Bennett one time said, “It
takes well and gives pleasure to all.”
The present wet winter has convinced
Melbourne that it, owns <'a shockingly inefficient
transport system. On fine mornings
thousands of men and girls bike into
the city from the suburbs ; but the
continuous wet has stopped most of
them. Other thousands walk in, as
a rule; and the rain has stopped
them too. So, from 7.30 to 9 a.m.,
every tram on every line has been
groaning and lumbering heavily along
with passengers clinging to the stan-
chions and standing on footboards,
wherever they have been able to plant
a toe ; and even then many have been
left behind. The increasingly scarce
waggonette has cut in ; but cabby,
like other people, prefers, regular
runs. Of course, the Tramway Co.
has plenty of spare cars with which
to meet the rush, and it can find
spare men. The fact is that its en-
gines and boilers aren’t powerful
enough to draw more loaded cars
on the ropes, and; as its lease is running out, it
won’ t go to any expense that it can possibly dodge.

The 87th anniversary of St. Peter’s Church
Campbelltown (N.S.W.), was celebrated last
week. The first preacher there was Rev. Thomas
Reddall, assistant Colonial Chaplain. In those
days there were no collections. The Government
provided the church, the parson, and the congre-
gation, the latter being the prisoner-population,
or assigned servants, who had to attend or be
flogged. When Chief Justice Forbes opened the
first Assize Court at Campbelltown there were
great rejoicings. A cavalcade, headed by Parson
Reddall, went as far as Liverpool to meet the
C.J. and escort him to the new court. Macquarie
named the town in compliment to his wife, v’ho
was a Campbell. Mr. Reddall had a couple of
remarkable, parishioners. One was Frederick
Fisher, of Fisher’s ghost fame'; the other was his
murderer, George Worrall, wbo was executed in
Lower George-stfeet gaol in 1826. Mr. Reddall
and Parson Cowper assisted to make Mr. Worrall
ready for the rope..
Adelaide has just got as near as it is ever
likely to get to the solution of a mystery that has
been worrying it for six weeks. On May 15,
Alexander Hunter, a middle-aged contractor of
Port Adelaide, disappeared—simply faded out.
He was well off, happy in his home life, and hard
at work on the construction of a big wharf ; and
the least unlikely of various theories was that he
had been carried off unintentionally on one of two
ships sailing on, that day. Considerable searching
was done, but when at last cables from Aden and
Capetown showed him not to be on either ship,
it seemed necessary to make a systematic inspec-
tion of all the miles of sand and mangrove swamp
that flank the Port river ; and on the last day of
June his body was found in a desolate place
nearly a mile from the water. So the discovery
bf the body suggested nothing except that the
man was very dead ; and the mystery seems likely
jfco stop with no more light than that streaming in
upon it.
Victoria’s Parson Nash wrangle still
clatters in a faint, discordant way down the
murky staircase of ecclesiastical history, much
like a bucket which has been flung over the top-
most banisters, and has not vet quite arrived at
the floor of the,cellar. Last week the Nashers apd
the Anti-Nashers proceeded with the election of
two parish representatives for the Synod. Each
party put up two candidates, and the two
Gnashers climbed up to the top of the poll like
’possums, leaving the anti-Gnashers at the foot of
the tree. Order seems to have been preserved until

ploded a large quantity of crackers. Some day
one of these earnest religious broils will be mis-
taken for a Chow wedding, and the local Vege-

Religious Chinese.
Rumors have been current in Melbourne for some days
Chat Chinese in the city have been purchasing bowie
knives, with which to settle their religious differences.
One of the leading cutlers stated to-day that he had sold
a large number of bowie knives to Chinese, during last
week. A year or so ago, during what were described as
the Little Bourke-street “Boxer” riots, a great many
revolver shots were exchanged. Mr. Rosier, a Bourke-
street gunsmith, sold out his’stock of revolvers. This
year, however, it appears that if there is to be any blood-
shed bowie knives are to be the Choide of weapons.—■;

Is that wild week when Chinatown i
Is smitten with the fear
Of God, and wades in to be good
And bring religion near.

Or sheds, or barns or tents, ' -Ai •
And batter Golden Silence and

And gets him where he lives.
So that he yearns for Grace and Light
The first things he contrives
To commandeer are loaded guns ;
The second bowie-knives.

He does not strive to send
His message forth by (parson-like)
Stabbing the air—His end

An Asiatic friend.
Calm, stoical and taciturn,
He holds that man a bore, , ( ,
Also a fool who spills wild words ; \
That which belikes him more
Is, in the Cause, to sally forth
And scatter someone’s gore.
Quaint is the gentle Chow ; his ways
With paradox are rife.
Religious love he inculcates
With gun and dinner-knife ;
He spreads the Word that shall not die , ,
By taking human life.

Mr. G. H. Reid warned girls to beware of the blandish-
ments of young men who did not desire to visit their
homes and meet mother and father. “Is that what you
did?” asked an interjeecor. “My memory’s defective,”
drawled Mr. Reid .—News item.
Years back a maiden, bright and shy.
Both plump and pleasing, pert and pretty,
Attracted Georgie’s wicked eye,
And listened to him—more’s the pity.
His protestations, fierce and hot,
Of love undying proved effective.
She never guessed that h? had got
A memory defective.
Her name, she said, was', Foreign-trifle ;
He vowed it Was the sweetgst'ever ;
He bought her dresses fine, and made
A promise he’d desert her never.
He swore that elsewhere none could find
Such charms, both single and collective,
And no suspicion crossed her mind
Of memories defective.
Alas! Another loomed in sight,
One Anti-Sosh, an heiress wealthy ;
And George from Foreign-trade took flight,
And dodged her in a manner stealthy ;
Her honor gone at his request
She saw him seek a new objective ;
Too late she found that he possessed
A memory defective.
In frenzy she implored of him
To make of her an honest woman ;
He laughed “ Ha, Ha ! ” in manner grim,
His attitude was quite inhuman.
She soon went wholly to the bad ;
And now each p’liceman and detective
Moves on the tart of him who had
A memory defective.

Melbourne Weekly Times of June 12
supplied some wholesome advice to an inquirer
who admitted to being “Doubtful,” and wrote
from Ulupna West. The W. T.’s veterinary
expert’s answer, re “Swelling Under Cows
Throat,” was: “Probably it is a tuberculosis gland.
Your best plan will be to have her tested with tuber-
culin. Failing this, you should endeavor to
fatten her for the butcher.” But if the poor
cow was too diseased to admit of fattening, the
best plan would have been to cut her up into
small joints and present them to the Weekly
Times’ expert, who should have been compelled to
eat the lot. Perhaps he should also have got
three months.
Dear Bulletin, —As an ardent student of
the disquisitions in your columns by naturalists
and other scientific contributors, I am desirous of
obtaining information about the ground louse,
which frequents gidgee country, particularly that
in the Barcoo district. It affects a drab-colored
costume and leads a drab-colored existence. It is
gregarious, and travels in battalions. It is a hide-
bound Conservative in that respect, adhering to
the antiquated axioms of the British War Office,
and has learnt nothing from the Boer War. It is
also an anarchist, there being no discernible
officers or leaders in its solid phalanx. It
bears out Napoleon’s dictum literally, for it
marches on its stomach. It also resembles
poor Jo —it is always going “ somewheres.” Its
ambition would appear to be suicide—unless it is a
poor bushman —for it follows main roads and
tracks, making no apparent effort to elude wheel
traffic. Whence the ground louse cOmeth or
whither he goeth, or what his object is in life, are
mysteries to the amateur observer. Is he gram-
nivorous? He is worse than the Yankee, who
merely bolts his food. I have never seen him eat
—much less dine. He must occupy some niche in
the cosmos. It is melancholy to think of his
pariah existence—without a scientific moniker to
bless himself with, leading such a profitless life—
all on his lonesome own, industriously marching
nowhere.—Yours, etc., Bindkyi.

“Silas Snell” : At Colon’s Creek, back of
Yam, where I put in a few bucolic months, the
people seemed to subsist by promoting raffles.
When a family was in very low water it arranged
to raffle something: and as practically every
family on Colon’s Creek was in perennial low
water, raffles were numerous. While I was there
Coombs raffled a tank, Cameron raffled a moth-
eaten evening suit that had belonged to a Scottish
bailie-ancestor of his, Johnson raffled a dog, Mrs.
Kitts raffled her services as a washerwoman for a
space of three months, two families raffled sewing
machines (I was told these sewing machines had
already been raffled five times), and Dunstan
raffled a horse and a gun. I was in Dunstan’s
raffle. There were 50 members at 2s. a member,
the value to be paid in coin or kind. The horse
went to the highest thrower, the gun to the
lowest. I was surprised to find nobody wanted
to win the horse, but at that time I had
not seen it. The raffle was not an undi-
luted gamble, as the price of admission covered
sundry social privileges. Dunstan provided a
dance and a supper, and purchasers of tickets
were shareholders in these joys. Still I had fond
hopes of winning that horse. But when Finn,
who had bought two tickets, threw 17, he was
recognised as the winner, and everybody sym-
pathised with him. The sympathy seemed quite
sincere, as Finn’s disgust certainly was. Pre-
sently, however, it was found that Finn’s second
throw was the lowest. Then Finn bucked up.
He looked quite cheerful as he took the gun in
his hands. “ Anyhow, it’ll do to kill the horse,”
he said. Next morning, when Finn attempted to
shoot Dunstan’s first prize with his second prize,
the gun exploded and blew off some off Finn, and
the horse, startled by the unwonted excitement,
stumbled away and fell into Dunstan’s well.
When Finn came out of the hospital Dunstan
E resented him with a bill, “To removing one
orse from one well, £l.” And the horse was still
alive.

“Clef” (W.A.) : The jarrah sleeper in-
dustry is booming now, and broad-axemen are at
a premium. The Government is
throwing open reserves in the most
reckless manner, and the day is
plainly in sight when the export
of jarrah will be stopped. Mean-
while the combine (Millar’s K. and
J. Co.) is grabbing every Govern-
ment reserve it can get, and is
conserving its own concessions and
freeholds for the day, not far dis-
tant, when, owing to scarcity, prices •
for hardwood must rise. In another
half-dozen years there will hardly
be an acre of jarrah land, outside
the combine’s control, within
reasonable hauling distance of the
seaboard. And the smaller mills
will have to push out to the un-
payable area. As each new agri-
cultural spur line is opened, every
available acre is seized, and the
rate at which these are cut out is
appalling. There is absolutely no
attempt at conservation, and the
bush fires, accentuated by the fallen
timber, are ruining thousands of
young trees that would make
marketable timber later on. Pre-
mier Newton Moore, owing to an
exposure in the now defunct Perth
Morning Herald, has put his
foot on a most profitable Private
Enterprise. It was a device where-
by speculators took up C.P’s. and
sub-let the timber rights to sleeper-
cutters, who paid them (the specula-
tors) a handsome royalty. When the
land was cut out its bare surface was
thrown back on the Government, which
probably had not even managed to collect
the small survey fees, let alone any other pay-
ments. A single selection would often yield the
speculator a dividend of hundreds of pounds.
“ Edyson ” : I am reminded by the recent
Gippsland floods of the courageous and resourceful
conduct of William James Eddy when the waters
came down at Tremore. William was only a
settler, a simple soul in a rude, bark hut; but if
this brief recital should encourage our Australian
boys to emulate his fine faith and his splendid
spirit in the hour of greatest trial, I shall ask no
more (beyond the usual space rates, of course).
When the rising waters drove William James
Eddy to the roof of his hut, he had his stockwhip
coiled about his waist. Presently, flooded out
pigs from Cooper’s ham and bacon ranche came
climbing downstream. It struck Eddy that here
was a most lamentable waste of pork. Uncoiling
the whip, and using the long lash as a lassoo, he
deftly roped in a passing pig and tethered it to his
hut with part of a roll of hayband that happened
to be handy. Then, seated on his chimney, with
no implement but his whip, the courageous settler
fished for pigs. He caught nine, and tethered

them all to his hut. He would certainly have
captured a great many more, but presently the
frail hut lifted from its foundations, and drifted
with the stream of flood waters. Another man
might have been alarmed at this terrifying de-
velopment, but not William James Eddy. Stand-
ing on the ridge of the hut, and bringing into play
all the arts of the experienced bullocky, he drove
those captive porkers for the river, and gaily con-
ducted his pig team down stream. News of his
coming preceded him, and the 107 inhabitants of
Cammtown turned out in their thousands to greet
him. Splendid and inspiring was the spectacle;
bravely William shouted to his gallant team,
deftly he guided the swimming pigs with his
whip, and at last, sweeping out of the river, he
brought his hut safely aground in the main street
of Cammtown. There he settled, and in course
of time rose to be Mayor.

The Commonwealth Quarantine Act, which
got to work on July 1, will put a check on two
lots of people—the scientific crank, who wants to
experiment with strange foreign beasts ; and the
amiable crank, who wants to
make pets of them. The
science cranks, though they
sometimes produce good re-
sults, are often every bit as
dangerous as the amiable
lunatics. The gypsy moths
which have cursed Massa-
chusetts were taken there by
a scientist for experimental
purposes ; but some escaped,
and ruin ensued. An en-
tomologist carried a collec-
tion of Colorado beetles to Eng-
land ; but a few got away from
him, and the potato crops of Eng-
land and Ireland fell a prey to devas-
tation. What might have happened had
a footing been got for the small beast that
it was lately proposed to scatter in order to
wipe out the rabbits in Australia, Heaven only
knows. Anyway, scientists and pseudo-scientists
who introduce new organisms for any purpose
whatever need watching.
“ Muru ” tells the tale of Jones, Brown
and Robinson :
Jones held the lease of his land from the Maoris on a
precarious tenure. He was in the habit of grazing his
cows at night in the Maori bonevard adjoining, to the in-
dignation of a moderately influential native named Brown.
Brown sat up many nights in succession to catch Jones in
the act of grazing his herd in the resting place of the de-
parted, and threatened him by day with an action for tres-
pass. Jones, one day, in the course of an inspection of the
cemetery with the object of future starlight grazing, un-
earthed an ancient taiaha, which is the emblem of the
Maori chief’s office, and conveys to the common mind the
same understanding of authority as the sceptre does in
the king business. Wherefore, when the infuriated Brown
met Jones at the sliprail of the burying ground
and renewed his threats, Jones produced the taiaha,
and, mustering his best road board adjectives, presented
it to Brown. Brown immediately fell upon the neck of
Jones, gave him the grazing rights of the tapu spot for
ever, and departed to give a special feast, whereat he
brandished the dishonestly acquired insignia of greatness
before his prostrate compatriots. Jones prospered subse-
quently ; obtained the highest butter-fat test at the local
cheese factory ; encouraged Brown (who was trusted by
the other Maoris with executive powers in land trans-
actions) to drink at the local pub ; acquired more land
from the natives, and chucked dairying for the more
luxurious job of sheepfarming. There was a man named
Robinson in this yarn, but my recollection of him is
indistinct. I think he kept the local pub.

THORW ALD’S SHANTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
At Thorwald's shanty, by the road
’Twixt Ballarat and Bendigo,
Of old the amber nectar flowed—
Thank God ! It has not ceased to flow.
And there a glass I clinked to-day
With bearded men in corduroys,
Who took my memory right away
To golden days when we were boys.
’Tis just the same, the smoking room,
The windows with their faded chintz,
The back door opened into gloom,
And on the walls egregious prints,
And one of which portraj r s “The Hounds,”
With Reynard half an inch in front;
One is entitled “Out of Bounds,”
And one is called “ The Darktown Hunt.”
But Thorwald, rufous, broad of face,
The Bacchus of the roaring days,
Has long relinquished pride of place
And gone his unremembered ways.
The customers are fewer now ;
The passing teamster hears no more
The songs, the laughter, and the row
That made the roadside shanty roar.
The place seems smaller ; yea, it seems
As if the very world had shrunk !
Is this the castle of our dreams
Wherein deep draughts of joy were drunk?
I know those shelves ; the bracket-lamp
That glims, and reeks of kerosene;
The narrow counter, always damp,
With Yankee cloth that glistens green.
The Hebe of the pewter pots
Is not as fair as she of old
Whose eyes were blue forget-me-nots,
Whose tresses were alluvial gold ;
I well recall her smiling face,
A loadstar unto younger men,
Who marvelled greatly at her grace—
Perhaps our blood was warmer then.
The latter Hebe’s hair is gilt;
To me she looks a trifle plain.
I noticed, when my beer was spilt,
She glanced at me with cold disdain.
Ah well! ’Tis long since golden rains
Have brought full harvest to the door ;
When life’s high tide was in the veins,
And Earth gave up her lavish store.
But comrades, let us, ere we pass,
Drink to the days when we were boys.
Old bearded friends, I raise a glass
To buried men and former joys !
And to that merry brew that flowed—
Thank God 1 It has not ceased to flow—
At Thorwald’s shanty, by the road
’Twixt Ballarat and Bendigo.

“The Harmy ” was holding an open-air
meeting in a Maoriland mining town, surrounded
by the usual Saturday night crowd. As the cap-
tain hoarsely exhorted them all to “come and be
saved,” a man pushed forward. “Wy you, you
dashed -loafer,” he said, contemptuously, “you
.never done an’onest day’s work in yOiyr life. It
■ ’ud be more ter yer credit if you was ter do a bit
of ’ard graft.” (Laughter from the crowd, and
cries of “Go it, old ’un !”) The captain raised his
voice in louder exhortation, but above the din
could still be heard the cries of the intruder saying
that the Salv’army man had never once done “a
day’s ’ard graft.” With rage in his eye the
badgered captain gave out a hymn, and the Army
sang with all its might, yet even the hymn
couldn’t drown the voice that addressed the
crowd, and told it that the officer had all his life
loafed on his mother, who took in washing. Pale
with fury, the Army man said “We will close
the meeting with prayer,” and started to suppli-
cate at the top of his voice : “ O Lord ! ” he-’said,
“ Thou knowest that our beloved brother here is
a loafer and a thief, who has just come out of
quod, where he has been doing six months.
Thou knowest, too, that he is a wife-
beater and a slanderer and a coward,
and _ that he has been fined for cruelty
to his dorg. Save our beloved brother, O Lord".
IN SPLENDID ISOLATION.
THE MAN : “I dunno w’y yous wimmen always
foilers a man about. Carn’t yer see I wish
ter be alone?”
Make him give up lying and cadging for drinks
. The rest of the supplication was lost be-
cause the disturber was explaining to the crowd
that the captain habitually stole the money out of
the plate. Then the captain closed the meeting
hurriedly, and in his private capacity landed the
stranger “one” on the jaw that sent him half-
way down the street, and peace settled on the
neighborhood once more.

“ M.A.” and his mate’s serpent :
I saw a low down trick played on a mate o’ mine when
we was hoofin’ it in ther vicinity ov Crows Nest (Queens-
land). We had managed, somehow, to strike a big saw-
mill up there ’bout the dinner hour, so drifted over among
the men, where they' was feedin’, an’ remarked, “ Don’
mind if we do.” They seemed a real jolly crowd, an’ ther
boss in pertickler was all one big laff. Me ’n Bill decided
they was a real unsofistikated mob, so we started in to
intertane them.
Bill sed that on’y fer the cussed drink—wot had alwes
bin his rooin—’e mite be rollin’ in welth. An’l told’em
I had bin egicated fur the ministry, but a early parshality
fer wimmen V wine had outed me in the first lap ov the
race. They seemed ter sympaithise, an’ ther boss ad-
mitted I had a sorter cßrical look even yit, an’ then they
orl lalfed some more, an’ sed it wor a pity ter see a clever
bloke rooin ed be sech vanities.
“Blow up" sounded whilst we was yarnin’, an’they
orl sprang up to recommence operations. Then ther boss
sed, sorter careless like, “Some one ov yew men shin up
to ther loft ’n’ bring me down the jack plane ye’ll find
there.” Bill sed he’d go, an’ ther boss laffed ’n’ sed
“ Orlrite,” an’ then me mate seesed 'old ov the ladder an’
scurried away up to the roof ov the shed.
This ladder ran a good 30ft. up,
an’ was clamped at top to a sniorl,
unrailed platform at ther door
ov the tool-’ouse, the lower end
bein’ buried in the great sawdust
heep piled jest onderneeth.
I saw Bill reech the top an’ dis-
appearinside. Prisintly, from that
loft, there arose to Hiven ther
wild wail ov a perishin’ sole—ther
dyin’ shriek ov Liberty—ther des-
pairin’ yell ov one damned —or
nearly so. Then something else
came out. Bill came. He emerged
on the seen starn fust, crossed
the little platfarm still in that
order, and hit the sawdust, 30ft.
below, with violence an’ profanity.
I went over and dug down inter
the sawdust till I found Bill’s
speakin’ end, but hed to cover
him up quick again on ercount of
the remarks ’e made. I waited
a bit, and then unburied him some
more, when ’e told me ter haul ’im
out cleer.
“Tom,” ’e said. “As I’m a
honest, Chrischin man, th’e’s
er boy constrictor up in that loft as wud reech frim
here to Dalby. Hit’s thicker round than that chimbley
over there and the hissin’ ov it as it med after me
was louder ’n the scream ov a blunt sawr cuttin’ inter
ironbark. Gawd knows how I escaped, Tom. Ther
brute ’ad me down twice, an’ I ’ad ther cross buttok on
him wance ; but ’ow I finally got away from ’im is more
n’l kin tell.”
“ Is this ver betty noor?” said the boss, as he kem over
laffin’, and held out a decent-sized, stuffed diamarid
snake. ’E wud be erbout Bft., mebbe, an’ pretty thick at
that. “ I keeps ’im up there fer the benifet ov blowhards
an’
“ £l v ’ o’,' van ter ’lll ” ses me mate, wearily, as ’e lifted
Matildar ’n’ staggered away towards ther ’orrizon.
“ £’! 110n > Tom ! Ther snake wot I saw ’ud make fifteen
millions ov that appology.”

“ M.” : I rise to endorse The Bulletin’s
oft-expressed abhorrence of pigeon murder, and
to mention that the fish-torturer should be in-
cluded in the office list of undesirables whom it is
necessary to wipe out with heavy sentences of
imprisonment. The “sport” who pursues the
Murray cod is one of the horrors of this continent.
On the Goulburn I recently came on an old
villain setting his night lines, and this was his
method of adjustment. First he stretched a line
right across the river, and attached to it about a
dozen lengths vvhich terminated in a hook and
bait. The bait in each case was a live frog hooked
through the lovyer part of the body near the hind
leg. A short distance away another ruffian was
baiting his hooks with live bream of from two to
three ounces weight, impaled through the dorsal
fin about midways along the back. These unfor-
tunate creatures were left careering at the end of
their tethers until a merciful cod happened along
and took the place of the bait on the hook. Frogs
and bream secured as above will live for more
than a week ; and although the pigeon slayer is a
horror, I really think this cod ruffian is worse.

“ Vigilans ” visits Sheol, jun. :
After a good look all round, I place Wyndham first for
extraordinariness among the townships of Australia.
Situated away up on the Far JSTor’-West, it consists of a
mere strip of sand three chains wide, at the foot of a
high and almost perpendicular hill. The inhabitants
usually number only about sixty, -besides blacks. Yet
Wyndham is the greatest cattle shipping port in Australia.
The harbor is undoubtedly a fine one, but the rise and
fall in the tide is thirty-four feet. The jetty is a wonder-
ful wooden structure, built especially for shipping cattle.
Sometimes the sea reaches to within a few feet of the top ;
at other times ycfu see a steamer resting serenely on the
mud, with immense saurians lying around in the sun.
The harbor is fringed by mangrove scrub, the home of
these monsters.
The mode of cattle-shipping is unique. On the
east of the hill there is a low saddle, with a good
road made across it by the blacks. Over this the
cattle are driven from the back country. They are then
in a natural lane, with the steep hill on one side, and the
sea on the other ; so they are pushed along until the
approach of the jetty is reached. Here the lane is fenced
into a race, and the hornies are forced on board,
without any trouble. As many as 20,000 cattle have been
shipped to Fremantle in a season.
The gaol is nearly always full of blacks who are accused
of cattle-killing. On my visit there were 80 there. Tliev
THE CHOICE.
“ Look ’ere, Jimmy, wot's it goin’ ter be? Me
or cigarettes?”
were building a road round the hill, which is raised-20ft.
from the swamp. They worked chained together in
pairs, while others were chained to wheelbarrows. Three
warders, armed with rifles, guarded them. The poor
nigger wonders whaffor, because in probably ninety cases
out of a hundred he has done nothing.
Now and then a “ whirligig ” strikes the city, but pro-
vision is made for this, and most buildings are chained
to the ground. Nothing will grow' on the sandy strip,
and when I was there vegetables w'ere a rarity, except
when the Wha-Hoi called from Port Darwin every three
months. Coin of the realm was not to be found ; the
only money being “ Durack’s shin-plasters,” ranging from
ss. to £5. It was a useful sort of money—for the
Duracks. At the back of this desolation there is some
fine grazing land ; and, in a year or two, if the mobs go
on growing, freezing and canning works will have to be
established.
THE RINGER’S CURSE.
(A fragment of a new Epic of Hades.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ Now damn my eyes,” the ringer sternly said,
Wiping his shear-blades on his gleaming moles,
“Be this word true the blanky scouts have brought,
Behold, the whistle sounds, and we are caught
Right on the tail, the cobbler yet unshorn."
Whereat a sound of many voices rose,
Bond, clamant, red with adjectival gore,
That smote the gaping tar-boy into awe.
Then, hitching up his pants, the ringer strode
Straight to the press. His large and hairy chest,
Save for a flannel green with grease of wool,
Was bare to every passing wind that blew.
“ Cobbers and union men,” he cried, “ this day
We gather all the crowd of noble coves,
Here and at Barrabunda. Strike me pink,
The blanky heathens press us to the wilds
Beyond the Never-Never. We are done.
The armbd legions of the ensanguined Chow
Are masters of the station. Can we light
So few against so many ? Damn their eyes !
Oh, blank, blank, blank their blanky carcases
VVho make our hard-earned cheques their spoil of war.”
Whereat the ringer wept as heroes weep,
And all the shed kept silence till the splash
Of his vast briny agony was seen
To wet the second-combing in the bin.
He spoke again : “ Take me and fill me up
With horrent whisky from the lone bush pub,
That I may see the vision wild with snakes,
And learn to curse aright before I die.
I fail, I lisp in petty syllables
Tongue-worn with use. The damns that now I damn
Are as the starshine to the risen sun
To that which shall be when my soul has drunk
The fire of Murphy’s nectar. Bear me hence
Before the blanky cows begin to shoot.
I would not die in dry sobriety
The death of some poor soldier. Fill me up
Till, serpent-bound with horror, I create
A curse of gory splendor for all time.”

The appointment of Dr. Horace Morgan
Baker, a graduate of Pennsylvania (U.S.A.), as
assistant to Professor Douglas Stewart in the
newly-created Veterinary Department of Sydney
University, recalls a page of S. Australian history.
The new lecturer’s grand-uncle, William Morgan,
came to the wheat State in 1849. He entered
Parliament in ’67, and became Chief Secre-
tary to the first Boucaut Ministry in ’75,
also to the third Boucaut Cabinet of ’77.
In ’7B Boucaut, struck by his own especial fitness
for the position, raised himself to the Bench, and
Morgan became Premier. He lasted 29 months
and 27 days; though S. A. had had 30 Ministries
before Morgan’s, only one of them had lasted
longer. He died, suffering from knighthood, in
England in 1883. When Broken Hill was so
young that it might reasonably have been called
Baby Hill, some of the profits went Morgan’s way.

THE STATE MOSQUITO.
State politics, temporarily eclipsed by the overpowering
interest of recent impressive events in the Federal arena,
are once again recalled to public attention by Mr. Wade’s
speech— Daily Paper.
LITTLE BOY (after a heavy thunderstorm): “ Ah ,
there you are again. Just when I had for-
gotten all about you."
Professor Gregory, who made the right
kind of commotion when he was professor of
Geology at Melbourne University, and then
passed on to Glasgow, is back in Australia, dig-
ging out material for another book on ore-occur-
rences. He has “done” Westralia, and is now in
Queensland, with a view to probing Gvmpie and
Mt. Morgan, in particular.. And before he quits
the State he will get ready to make a few remarks
on the subject of the artesian-water supply, as to
which he and Pittman, the N.S.W. Government
Geologist, can’t agree at all.
R. C. Bishop Doyle, erstwhile of Lismore
(N.S.W.), passed to the land where cash is not
with the strictly modest sum of Is. Gd. to his
credit, and no other property, real or personal,
worth mentioning. It is not every follower of the
Nazarene that can show as seemly a financial
record as that.
Lawyer Parry, of Sydney, sentenced to
five years for embezzling his clients’ money, ought
to be cheered in gaol with an address of sympathy
from his brother practitioners in Melbourne.
The price of a similar indiscretion in Victoria
would have been two years’ suspension from
practice, and a severe, though tearful, reprimand
from the learned Judge.
During last week Samuel “McKakkey,”
squatter and knight, threw £lO,OOO to the cold, stiff
Dreadnought Fund ; and the Sydney Telegraph
shuddered and gave Samuel \\ lines in a part of
the paper where, if not absolutely hidden, it was
at least a little off the main road. This is an
example of how a wealthy but well-meaning and
unpunctual man may revive unhappy memories,
there wets a fund once, but the wreaths are now
withering on its early tomb; and, just when the
Telegraph was getting over the shock nicely,
news comes from the country that Sam has
bought the deceased a new hat, or something of
the kind. Someone had better break the news to
Mr. McKakkey that poor Dreadnought is no
longer with us.
Sergeant-at-Arms Larry Harnett, an iden-
tity of the House in Maoquarie-street, Sydney, is
still on the invalid list, and has handed in the
insignia of his job. Members, on re-assem-
bhng, looked in vain for his great, genial face
under the clock. Lawrence Joseph Harnett first
saw service in the Assembly in 1800, four years
after the establishment of Responsible Govern-
ment. In 1804 he became Sergeant-at-Arms.
“ Mount V.” writes from Maoriland :
James O irroll, alias Timi Kara, alias Taihoa, is aotirw
Premier here while Joseph Ward takes his Bull ward wav
to assure the Ma country of the unalterable loyalty of
Wanganui and the solid adhesion of Hokitiki. Tai.ioa, I
believe, is Maori for “Don’t hurry." It is the same as
“ bide awee” and “ manana,”and is a relation of the tired
feeling. Jimmy Carroll gets the name bv reason of his
fiery lingering and the foaming haste of his sitting still.
It was he who invented the saying, “It is the pace that
kills,” and he isn’t killed. When Ward comes back he
will find everything where he left it. Minister Carroll
won’t shift anything. He never was a shifter.
A very old lady died in England last month
—the widow of Richard Graves xMncDonnell, who
was Governor of S. Aus. from 1855 to 1862. A
south-eastern port and Australia’s great central
mountain range keep green the family name of
■MacDonnell, while the lady’s own front name is
borne by a number of lakes, caves and other items
—among them Blanchetown, and the Blanche
Cup, a curious spring in the Far North. But the
real memorial of her former popularity was the
“ Lady Mac Donnell,” for nearly 50 years almost
the best-known rural inn outside Adelaide. The
honorable pub was shut up under a local option
poll only a month or two ago.
By the Oldest Inhabitant :
Mr. Gordon Korff, who died on June 30 at the age of 82
years, was one of two brothers well known in Sydney
commercial circles any time for the past three-quarters
of a century. In the early ’forties, the father, John
Korff, was shipbuilding at Miller’s Point, and a few years
later he became an “oil, ship and general cooper,” in
Lower George-street, while in 1850 Gordon Korff was a
coal merchant in the same street. In the mid ’fifties
brother Frederick joined Gordon. Frederick Korff will
be remembered as a very tall venerable-looking man, who
had a sort of shipping business in Bridge-street and
Queen’s-place. On his premises you could buy flags of
all nations and anything in a shipping way from an
anchor to a sail-needle. It was even said that he had
main-decks for sale. The father and sons discovered the
harbor on the North Coast, now named “ Goff’s,” hut
originally “Korff’s.” For many years the brothers
owned a number of iron houses' on Glehe-road and in
Hereford-street. Their iron settlement was named “St.
Germains,” and there most of the Korff tribe resided.
“C.M.G-.”: I read Melvin’s obituaries
in the Melbourne dailies with mingled feelings.
The sheets were enthusiastic in praise of the dead
scribe, enthusiastic in precisely the same tone and
in almost the same words. The notices might
have been written by the same man, and each
paper posed as a sort of indulgent proprietor and
patron. For a long while neither daily had
wanted Melvin ; when he died both papers claimed
him, with a sort of self-glorifying fanfare. It
was much the same when Davison Symmons
passed hence. In his later days he couldn’t have
got a job in either office; when things were

The last member but one of the earliest
Legislative Council of Queensland (that of 1860)
passed out last Saturday, when Alfred William
Compigne handed in his earthly resignation at the
age of 90.
Rarely does the poet obtain Parliamentary
recognition in his own life-time. The politician,
if he quotes verse at all, favors mostly the work
of bards long since dead and mouldering. Ex-
Minister for Defence Pearce struck a new note
(24/6/’O9) by delivering in the Senate a Bulletin
poem of “Den’s” on the Fusion. The Senate
provides an interested audience for poetry, con-
taining, as it does, in the persons of legislators like
J. C. Neild, Walker, et al , some of the keenest
(albeit worst) versifiers in the Commonwealth.
About a deceased politician of small
account: —
In the year 1842 George Sheriton was a grocer in Perth
(W.A.), and in that year there wis born to him a son,
whom he named VV. A. George. The son, when the time
came, was educated at Taunton, in Devonshire. He
returned to VV.A. in 1858, and carried on business with
his father. The latter died in 1867, and young George
succeeded to the tea and the sugar and the bacon. He
entered politics in 1870 under the old Constitution, was
11 times Mayor of Perth, and was Chief Secretary in the
first Ministry under Responsible Government. Also, he
was chairman of the Rank of Western Australia and other
monetary ventures, lie left Perth some months ago on
a visit to England, and died on May 30, aged 67 years.
Heart trouble closed the career of George Shenton.
It was not a kindly send-off that Maori-
land Premier Joseph Ward got when he started
for the British Defence Conference. Quite a
crowd of the unemployed waited long hours on
Wellington wharf for a chance to hoot at Joseph.
They hooted him, and his horses, and his carriage,
and his police escort, and his beautiful clothes,
and his shiny hat. There was even a special exe-
cration for his portmanteau when a flunkey was
seen carrying it up the gangway. Joseph, the
well-fed speculator, hasn’t the hold on the people
that burly Dick Seddon had.
Chief Justice Darley is the first occupant
of the top Bench in N.S. W. to take his body tiome
on full pay with the avowed intention of putting it
to sleep in the halls of his ancestors. Sydney
Evening News thinks there are precedents; but
all Darley’s predecessors, from Forbes to Salo-
mons, though foreign born, have left their dust
in Australian soil. Darley’s career was that of
the old Roman type of exploiting colonist. He
raked together all he could, even a tinal 12 months’
grace-allowance, and carried the treasure back to
where he came from.
“ 0.K.” writes :—-
It is possible for a Duke to have a {rood effect on a
draper. The cable mentioned lately that a defunct Lon-
don draper—one Frederick Gorringe—had bequeathed
some £400,000 to charities, a fact worthy of note con-
sidering' the circumstances of the case. In thus dedicat-
ing the bulk of his fortune to the public instead of devot-
ing it to the endowment of anew baronetcy or peerage
(seeing that any male inheritor of an immense fortune is
inevitably taken into the blessed aristocracy if he so
wishes), Gorringe gave plain proof that his business ex-
perience had made him about as democratic as a wealth}’
draper can be. He traded on the Buckingham Palace
Road, which was regarded as an out-of-the-way district
for expensive “shopping” until he brought it into
notice by working up a business in special fur-
belows for special people. The Duchesses and Countesses
and sich were lured to Gorringe’s. Then on the
strength of its high-toned clientele the shop attracted
the great snobocracy, and prospered exceedingly.
All this time the draper was paying a comparatively
moderate rent. He had got a lease of the premises when
the neighborhood was out of the way of “ distinguished
patronage,” and a subsequent renewal on reasonable
terms. But at last his landlord came in and demanded a
large slice of the annual profit. Gorringe was “ a tenant
on the Westminster estate,” as a sassietv newspaper
would say. His Grace the Duke of Westminster owns the
land whereon Gorringe had been piling more bricks and
improvements during his successful career. When a
further renewal of the lease was required, his Grace
clapped £3OOO a year on to the old rent. Probably Gor-
ringe had lost some of his love and reverence for Britain’s
ruling classes before this time; doubtless a good many
noble lords had failed to pay up the bills of their wives, or
the other ladies’ bills. Anyway, the draper decided to
cut his connection with the blessed aristocracy when the
Dook “stuck’’him for another £3OOO a year. He sold
the business to a company (limited), and bequeathed the
major portion of the capital to charities, as aforestated.

Australia got its
nose in front even in
the recent Turkish
troubles. Donahoe,
the old Sydney
pressman, now Paris
correspondent for
the London Daily
Chronicle, worked
a great “ scoop ” for
his paper by getting an interview with the new
Sultan immediately after the old one had been
booted out.
S. Australia stands easily first among Aus-
tralian States in the matter of forest-planting ;
and David Nock, who died the other day, aged
80-something, always claimed the credit for start-
ing the business. He got himself, Millionaire
Angas, and Krichauff—all now dead—appointed a
Parliamentary committee to consider the matter ;
audon their report the State went ahead, making
forest reserves and sticking trees into them.
In refusing to impart certain tremendous
evidence to the Bent Commission, Mackey, ex-
Vic. Minister of Lands, tumbled rather heavily.
He based his objection on the allegation that his
oath as an Executive Councillor bound him to
fearful secrecy, and the Commission was so im-
pressed by his assertion that it started circulating
correspondence, via the Premier and State Gover-
as to whether the potentate could be relieved
of his bond of silence. After further composition,
it then occurred to somebody to inspect Mackey’s
oath, and it wasdiscoveredthathehad merely sworn
not to disclose matters “which shall by the Gover-
nor, Lieutenant-Governor, or Administrator of
the Government, be directed to he kept secret.”
So the dark, mysterious Mackey wasn’t really
tottering under the burden of great hidden circum-
stances of State after all; and but for his cheap
little dignity he could speak as freely as any un-
trammelled office boy who was called upon to give
evidence about the vanishment of petty cash. 1

I am Ward of the Sydney D.T.
With amazement I’m perfectly dumb ;
We have nothing like these things I see.
And I can’t understand why you’re glum ;
It’s your country, of course, and you ought
To know just how you’re getting along.
But ... It’s like this ! For years I have taught
That you, Father, could never go wrong !
I am Ward of the Sydney D.T.
And it rather puts me in a hole
If you make a poor mouth. Do you see ?
For I’ve backed old Freetrade with my soul;
Oh, of course ! I have had all the facts
And the figures beside—quite a heap.
But they’re dry—dry as leaders or tracts,
And I find that they put me to sleep.
I am Ward, of the Sydney D.T.

In the midst of his laces and braid ;

And I carefully cover the bones
That were picked long ago by the birds.

I am Ward, of the Sydney D.T.,
And I will not believe he is ill !
Get the old fool some whisky for me
And make him take a dose—or a pill!
Cheer up, Father ! You’ll soon be all right!
Don’t you worry ! Drink this while it’s hot!

Very well, nurse, I’ll leave him to yon !
But I’ll preach till I die : GET THINGS CHEAP—

And, although he seems doubtful to-night,
If Freetrade was the right way—But no !
No, confound it 1 He must have been right !

r ■ 0.K.” : If poet Grant Hervey is wooing

Labor candidate, he will find that Provincialism
is his most formidable rival. He has to persuade

“ Scribe ” writes :
Joe Melvin, just passed away in Melbourne, was the
most enterprising- reporter ever known in Australia. He
missed a country train one time, on Argus business, and
pa id £4O out of his own pocket for a special. The Argus
refunded it. He did the Kelly Gang- fight at Glenrow m.
Going- along in the train he crawled upon the carriage
roofs and put out all the lights—a precaution no one else
had thought of. In the battle he was in front of all the
press. He was the first person to see Net! Kell vin armor
and Ned fired his first shot at him. He went to the
Soudan as a stoker, when the Sydney and Melbourne
papers he represented were refused accommodation for a
correspondent. This involved a bribe of £BO. He and
Lambie—afterwards killed in the Boer objectionableness—
had a rather narrow escape from being shot by Arabs. Yet
more remarkable was Melvin’s Kanaka-stealing expedition
in the South Seas, as a supercargo. The old lion had to
live on mice. Joe s last sensation was having a suit spoilt
with rotten eggs at a Judkins’ Sunday meeting in the
Melbourne Gaiety. To think that Melvin should come
down to reporting Juddy.

Under the Braddon clause the Commonwealth is for the
present bound to return to the States three-fourths of
the net Customs revenue. Including- the half-year to
June 30, 1901—not covered by the foregoing- figures—this
is how that provision has worked out:—
Paid to States to 30/6/’OB .. .. £57 776 611
Paid to States, 1908-9 .. .. 7,930,350
Three-fourths of Net Customs £60,706,961

Ditto, 1908-9 7,930,350
59,647,872
Total paid to States in Excess of
Constitutional Requirements .. .. £6,059 OS9
It will be seen that the Commonwealth, having previously
starved itself in order to overpry the States, was last year
not able to return to the States more than the Constitu-
tion provides for.
The total expenditure was £G,420,110. This was
divided up as follows (a few other years are given for the
sake of comparison)

Under the Constitution all expenditure other than that
incurred in running things just as they were when the
Commonwealth took them over is “other” expenditure
and is debited to the States according to their population!
Tor instance, Tasmania guaranteed a certain revenue to'
the Eastern Extension Co. for the Bass Strait cable
service. After the Commonwealth arrived, and when the
inter-State rates were made uniform, the special cable
charge was abolished ; so the Commonwealth has to pay
about £4500 a year to the Cable Co., and this is “other ”
expenditure. So the trawler is “other” expenditure"
hkewise new rifle ranges, etc., the Commonwealth’
Patents Office, the sugar bounty (or refund of special
excise duty), the cost of the administrative staff of the
Customs Department, and so on. This explains the
rapid increase in “other” expenditure.
-Post Office has lately been the most dis-
cussed Commonwealth Department; wherefore it is
worth a paragraph all to itself. Partly, no doubt, owino-
to the great telegraphic concessions that were made the
growth of the business has been remarkably rapid. The
revenue has rushed along like this y
4902 £2,372,861
4905 2,632,551
4 908 3,300,096
4909 3,409,919
As it was always certain that the Commonwealth would
take over the Post Office, the State Oovernments de-
liberately neglected that department, so far as works
were concerned. For years it was known, for instance,
that the Sydney G.P.O. was utterly unsuited for its
work and would have to be remodelled ; yet nothing was
done. Now, with much heavier work to be done, the
Commonwealth can’t any longer postpone that heavy
outlay, and the remodelling is to be put in hand. As a
result of curses coming home to roost like this theex-
penditureon new workshasbeen growing all the time ; and
of course, the increase of population has called also for
more postal accommodation. Last year the department,
therefore, panned out as follows
Revenue £3 499 919
Expenditure.—Ordinary .. .. £3,630,386 ’ ’
New Works, etc. .. 547,715
-3,578,101
Deficit for year £168,182
This is apart from the department’s share of “other ”
expenditure. Just at present two accountants are trying
to find out whether the telephones pay at the old rates •
it is quite obvious, however, that the Department, taken
as a whole, has made too many concessions already if it
is ;,o pay for reasonable extensions as it goes along. And
as the next generation will have to pay for its own exten-
sions, it seems a monstrous thing to load it with the cost
of our present extensions as well.

N.S.W. State Treasurer Waddell says that the
net surplus for the year was £460,753, arrived at this
way 1 —
Consolidated Revenue Fund, bal-
ance, 30/6/’O9 .. .. .. £637,677
Ditto, 30/6/’OB .. .. ~ " 176 924
Surplus £460,753
But there is another way of looking at it
Total revenue £13,625,034
Total expenditure .. .. 18,158,356
Real deficit .. £4,533,322
No doubt there are assets to represent some of this
money. But that is exactl}' what the State has spent in
excess of its revenue ; and from that point of view the
record is about the worst in the State’s historj’. Of the
total expenditure no less than £3,107,243 came from
straight-out borrowings ; nearly a million was derived
from previous land sales, etc.; and the gross total was
made up as follows:
Expenditure. Increase.
„ „ . for 1908-9. for Year.
Revenue Account .. .. £12,990,688 £832 232
Treasurer’s Advance.. .. 245,464 69,620
Cioser Sett ement .. .. 773,319 772,953-
Public Works Fund .. .. 1,041 642 45 730
Loan Account 3,107,243 55L329-
Totals £18,158,356 £2,564,864
Wade and his party got into power by pretending to be
horrified at the extravagance and heavy borrowings of
the Owe’Sullivan and his colleagues ; and'thiseomparison
shows what a confidence trick has been worked on the-
State:—
Loan
Revenue. Expenditure. Total.
1904 £11,248,328 £2,288,742 £13,537,070-
1909 .. 13,625,034 3,107,243 16,732,277
Thus, though Wade and his party had £2,376,706 more
revenue to play up than the spendthrifts had in 1903-4,
besides large sums derived from the so-called surplus of
previous years, they nevertheless spent no less than
£818,501 more borrowed money. If Wade and party were
justified in calling on the State to fire out the old Govern-
ment in 1903-4, what do Wade and his party honestly
think the State would be justified in doing to themselves
now ?
The Victorian expenditure figures are not avail-
able. The total revenue was £8,169,264, or £119,244 less
than that for the previous year. If the expenditure has
been within the estimate, there will be a surplus of
slightly over £50,000.
Queensland shows up as follows :
1908. 1909.
Revenue .. £4,488,398 £4,766,244 Inc. £277,846
Expenditure.. 4,373,096 4,756,303 Inc. 383,207
Loans.. .. 1,033,676 1,247,820 Inc. 214,144
The surplus in 1907-8 was £115,302 ; but in the past year,
though the borrowings were £214,144 heavier, the ex-
penditure on revenue account has b -en so much larger
that the surplus is only £9940. While the revenue
only grew by 6'2 per cent, the expenditure on revenue
account grew by B'S per cent., and the loan expenditure
by 20'7 per cent. The figures cannot be regarded as
satisfactory; for the size of the population the loan ex-
penditure is absurdly high—about £2 3s. per head. In
proportion to population it is worse even than the N. S.
Wales record.
Neither the Tasmanian nor Westralian figures
are available ; they are held back for adjustments at the
end of the year. The S. Australian Treasurer iniimates
that the revenue was approximately £3,547,266, or
£107,400 less than the previous year’s ; but he still ex-
pects a surplus of about £250,000, which would have been
nearly £400,000 but for the Harrier labor trouble. He
doesn’t say anything, though, about loan expenditure,
and that is the weak point in S. Australian finance.

The A. J.S. Bank : —The long-delayed scheme
for the reconstruction, foreshadowed last week, has now
been published. At the time of the bank crisis the
Companies Arrangement Act was passed, making it pos-
sible for a bank to reconstruct without closing its doors,
ihat Act, however, lapsed in 1899 ;so now, if a bank
wants to reconstruct without closing its doors, other
measures have to be adopted. The most feasible plan is
to form what is nominally a new bank, which takes over
the old bank. It was a long-debated question whether
the name should be altered. As a matter of fact, some
alteration was necessary as, nominally and legally at
least, it will be an entirely new bank. Eventually, a
complete change was decided upon ; and the new institu-
tion will be the Australian Bank of Commerce.
Three lots of people are interested in the recon-
struction (1) The “new” depositors, etc. ; that is, all
the creditors of the bank except the holders of old
deposits. (2) The old depositors, now represented by
holders of “B” and interminable inscribed stock. (3)
The shareholders. The “new” depositors, etc., will be
taken over by the new bank ; and, as will be seen pre-
sently, they will have even more security for their money
than they enjoy at present. Most interest, however,
hangs on to what becomes of the other two lots. The
holders of “ B ” deposits and inscribed stock are dealt
with as follows (the amounts are calculated on the figures
as at Dec. 31 last) :
Payments in Exchange for Old Deposits.
Payable
in the £ Total
Amount
Deposits. Payable.
2 6 Deposit receipts .. .. .. £468,872
6 8 Preference shares 1,2.i0’324
10 10 Interminable stock .. .. 2,031,777
20 0 £3,750,973
After the new and the old debt has been disposed
of in ths foregoing- manner the shareholders in the
old bank remain to be dealt with. On Dec. 31 the paid
capital was £154,570. There were 155,790 shares of £3 10s.
each, of which £1 had been called up (of this £3257 was in
arrear), leaving a liability of £2 10s. per share. The old
bank undertakes to call up the whole of this, and make
the money thus raised available for the new bank. The
old paid capital, along with the reserves, disappears ; but
shareholders are to be entitled to take up a £1 share for
each of the £1 of their liability; and by paying for the
new- shares the old shareholders will wipe out their
liability. These shares are to be paid for 2s. 6d. on allot-
ment and 2s. 6d. per quarter afterwards. A shareholder
in the old bank will not escape liability by neglecting to
apply for the shares in the new bank.
(1) The deposit receipts to be issued will carry
3 per cent, interest, and will be payableat two years from
the date of the order sanctioning the reconstruction, or
earlier at the bank’s option on giving three months’
notice.
(2) The interminable stock will carry 3 per cent. ; but
if and when the shares get more than 3 per cent, div., the
stock must get £ per cent, extra for every 1 percent,
extra drawn by the shareholders. The maximum in-
terest will, however, be 4 per cent. This stock is repay-
able at the bank’s option on three months’ notice.
(3) The pref. shares, which are to be issued as fully
paid-up, are (a) to be entitled to a cumulative pref. div.
of 3 per cent. After that, (6) the ordinaries are
entitled to 3 per cent. Then (o) the profits up to £12,500
are to be carried to a reserve fund until that fund
reaches £250,000; and if the profits after paying the
3 per cent, do not equal the £12,500, then the deficiency
is to be made good out of the profits of succeeding half-
years in priority to the payment of any increased dividend.
Next (cl), the stock must receive J per cent, extra interest,
if and when the shares get an extra 1 percent, asexplained
above. Pref. shares are not otherwise limited as to the
div. they may carry: if ordinaries get an extra 1 per
cent., the prefs. must get 1 per cent. also. Pref. shares are
to be preferential as to capital as well as to dividend.
If the bank makes losses in realising the assets taken
over from the old bank, the pref. capital must not be
touched till the ordinary capital has been wiped out, if
that should be necessary ; but there is to be no such re-
duction of capital, except in respect to new-business
losses, for seven years.
Practically this gives the shareholder in the old
bank a run for his money for seven years. His £1 per
share, which so far nominally remains, is wiped out,
of course; and he must pay up the other £2 10s.
per share. But, except new-business losses are
made, the new concern undertakes not to write off the
£2los. or any part of it for seven years; and that will
give securities a chance to recover. It is a fair and good
provision ; had it been in force in connection with, say,
Goldsbrough, More and Co., Ltd.—a concern which did
much the same sort of business as the A. J.S. Bank did
in the old days—it would have prevented a lot of bitter-
ness. In getting in the £2 10s. the liquidator is to act
under the supervision and instructions of the new bank,
and the new bank must sanction any compromise before
he completes it. Morally, the old shareholders are
under an obligation to pay up the capital. It was
because they had undertaken to pay it that
the depositors lent their money; and if it becomes
necessary for the shareholders to forfeit in order that the
old depositors may escape loss, they must forfeit. But,
though those shareholders have without a doubt lost
what they have already paid, they are to be given a verv
fair chance to retrieve the money which they are to pay
now. Still, if there should turn out to be'any further
losses to be made good, they must stand that loss up to
the extent of their £2los. per old share. In this respect the
scheme is thoroughly sound and just; at the same time
it gives the old shareholders every chance which fair men
could give them.
Of course, the people who will have to be argued
with most strenuously are the old depositors; and
W. P. Manning, one of the directors, has gone to
Britain to do the arguing with those who are there.
At present the stock is of two kinds—“ B ”
stock, carrying 3 per cent., repayable in 1912 and
1917 ; and inscribed stock, carrying 3£ per cent., and
interminable except at the bank’s option. Recently both
have been worth about 12s. 6d. in the £ in the market,
though the “B” stock has in the past been much lower
than that. It is possible for both iois to get another
1 percent, after a dividend has been paid to shareholders.
The “ B ” stock amounted to £2,953,218 at December 31 ;
and it would be practically impossible to repa}- that much
on the due dates. Some rearrangement is therefore im-
perative. The only question is: Do the depositors get
the best that is possible? On the whole, they could
scarcely expect anything better. They get 2s. 6d. in ihe
£ within two years; 10s. lOd. in the £ whenever
the bank can pay it (meantime it carries interest at
from 3 to 4 per cent.); and 6s. Bd. in the £
is taken for cumulative preference capital. Only the old
inscribed stock will get less minimum interest than it
has been getting- hitherto ; and even as to that, it is pos-
sible that the new stock will soon carry 3J per cent. also.
The stock as at Dec. 31 last cost the bank in annual
interest as follows :
3 p.c. “B” deposits £88,596
3£ p.c. inscribed stock .. .. 27,921
Total interest £116,517
If a 3 per cent, dividend is paid, the “ B ” depositors will
get, in all, just the same ; and in two years they will
have an eighth of their principal. The inscribed stock-
holders, on the other hand, will lose £3988 a year in
interest. But, if a 4 per cent, dividend is paid, this
will be the result:—
On Inscribed Stock.
Principal. Interest.
2-year Deposit (3 p.c.).. £99,719 £2,991
Interminable (3J p.c.) .. 432,118 15,123
Pref.-capital (4 p.c.) .. 265,918 10,637
Total £797,755 £25,751
On “ B ” Decosits.
Principal. Interest.
2-year Deposit (3 p.c.) .. £309,152 £11,074
Interminable (3£p.c.).. 1,599,660 55,988
Pref.-capital (4 p.c.) .. 984,406 39,376
Total £2,953,218 £106,438
So a 3£ per cent, rate of interest on the extended de-
posits, with the consequential 4 per cent, div., would call
for a total of £135,189 a year, or only £18,672 more than the
bank has hitherto been paying. Put in another way, if
the bank pays only 3 per cent, interest and dividend, the
depositors will in all get £3988 less interest than they
have been getting, but they will get one-eighth of their
principal within two years; while, if the bank pays
i percent, more interest and 1 per cent, more dividend,
they will get altogether £18,672 more than they have
been getting in interest. With the still-valu-
able connection that this bank has; with a big
and growing field to work upon ; and with the
old, obstructive lumber cleaned out of the way,
it should be easily possible for the bank to
earn an extra £18,672 a year. But it has to be remem-
bered that before it can pav more than 3 per cent, to old
depositors and on pref. shares, a dividend has to be paid
on ordinary shares, and £12,500 a year has to be put to
reserve; also if, say, in four years an average of only
£5OOO has been put to reserves, there will be £30,000 of
leeway to make up before the interest or dividend can be
increased. As to the dividend to be paid on ordinary
shares, however, it has to be remembered that these
shares will.be represented by new capital, which will no
doubt earn considerably more than 3 per cent. One
class of the old depositors may lose a trifle in interest at
the beginning ; but it is only a trifle, and in return they
get the advantage of greater security (the paying up of
ordinary capital guarantees that), along with an interest
in the business. They can kill that business if thev like ;
but they will be very foolish if they do that, for it is still
very w-ell worth keeping alive.
So far as the Edinburgh and London depositors
are concerned, they are evidently inclined to keep it
alive. If the bank’s ambassador had a bad time any-
where it was expected that he would have it in Edin-
burgh ; but the first cable the bank received from him
ran like this:—“Two meetings of the depositors’ com-
mittees held at Edinburgh. Capitalisation meets with
approval, provided exemption of, companies struck out,
except Savings Bank. Many 1 B ’ fixed deposits, deposited
individually, are held for companies which, with trustees
for private settlements, would also claim exemption.”
The only thing that the Edinburgh committee jibbed at
is of no real consequence to the bank—it was merely a pro-
viso that, since some cos. might perhaps be debarred by
their articles from holding shares, they might take inter-
minable stock instead. It would suit the bank just as
well, if not better, for everybody to take shares ; but, as
the committee is willing to exempt the Savings Bank of
N.S.W., the A.J.S. directors have cabled agreeing to
strike out the proviso, and substituting for “ companies”
“ the Savings Bank of N.S.W.” Following on the news
of the Edinburgh meeting a further cable was received
reporting a “satisfactory initial meeting of the London
committee,” when exactly the same thing happened as
had happened in the North. Apparently, therefore, so
far as the depositors on the other side are concerned, the
scheme will go through ; and no opposition at all is likely
to be met with from depositors on this side.

1908.. 39,558 5 ~ ~ 17,812 6 ~ ~ 22,500 16,386
This is a curious business. The Brisbane Tramways Co.
was formed in 1895, and got special Acts authorising it to
construct lines in Brisbane. It had no capital to speak of,
however ; though, having Malcolm McEacharn and others
of that tonnage behind it, it had the means to get plenty.
When everything was ready this co. was formed in 190oj
and it provided practically all the capital; it owns
149,913 out of a total of 150,000 shares, and last year
drew £64,965 out of the total dividend of £65,000. There-
fore when an investor buys into Brisbane Trams he buys
not into the co. that owns the trams, but into the co.
that owns the co. that owns the trams. Yet, as the co.
that nominally owns the trams has no capital worth
mentioning, when extensions, etc., are called for the
money is provided by the co. .that owns the co. that is
nominally the owner of the trams ; and it is its capital
also (that is to say, the Investment Co.’s capital) which is
pledged to see that the debentures, etc., are paid off.
The Investment Co.’s share capital is £375,000 in 5 per-
cent. cumulative nref. shares and £375,000 in ordinary
shares ; but in addition there are £450,000 worth of 4£
per cent, debentures outstanding, and another £50,000
are authorised. Therefore, before ordinaries have a look
in, this money must be earned over and above expenses:—
Debenture interest .. .. ..£20,250
Preference share dividend 18,750
Total £39,000
Thus, while £46,500 of surplus receipts would allow of an
ordinary dividend of only 2 per cent., £61,500 of a surplus
would pay 6 per cent., and £84,000 would pay as much as
12 per cent. Ordinaries take risks ;in bad times they get
nothing, but in good times they are liable to get some-
thing dazzling. Up to 1905 (inclusive) they got nothing
at all ; and in the early part of 1906, though these
ordinary’ shares are £5 paid, they were worth only
17s. 6d. in the market. To-day they are worth about £6 ;
aqd English holders have been steadily unloading on to
the Australian market at these rapidly-rising prices.
Pref. shares, also £5 paid, are worth about £5 6s.
The Tramways Co., so far as it is a separate
concern, has had the following record in the same time :
r, Re-
Deo., Receipts. Expenses. Profits. Dividends, serves
1906 ..£141,677 £82,525 £59,152 £50,000 £25,674

1908 .. 178,510 94,964 83,546 65,000 57,842
Of those reserves £57,000 forms a Renewal Fund ; appa-
rently current renewals are charged up with ordinary ex-
penditure, but nothing appears to be written off for
depreciation ; and, that being so, part at least of this
renewal fund is a fair deduction for depreciation, and
hence the true net profits were less for last year than the
£83,546 shown above. There are also some other proper
deductions, because it appears that the Investment Co.
has to do all the insuring-: so far it has built up an acci-
dent insurance fund of £2OOO, which isn’t included in the
reserves shown in the first brief table above ; and it also
has to pay out something over £lOOO a year on account of
fire insurance. These items plus interest on debentures
explain why the Tramways Co.’s profit differs from that
of the Investment Co., even though the latter does own
practically the whole of the former’s shares.

This was the big brewery that led the way towards the
amalgamation or combine that was fixed up a couple of
years ago. In return for the assets which it handed over
and for its interest in the business, it received 40 per cent,
of the capital in the new co.—the Carlton and United
Breweries. Thus it was able to wipe out the goodwill
item from its own balance-sheet ; instead of showing
goodwill, that intangible asset is now included in the
item—“ Shares held in other companies, £242,363.” The
original co. got into great trouble when the Melbourne
boom collapsed. At that time it was known as the Carl-
ton and West End Breweries, Ltd. ; the present co. took
affairs over in 1896. The real estate stood in the books
of the old co. at £671,354: but on revaluation this was
written down to £316,225. At that time the old co. owed
in all £893,502, mostly on debentures and mortgages.
A new co. was formed—after a memorable fight
with ex-brewer Terry—and there was a disappearance of
all but £40,309 of the old capital, which had stood at
£240,000 for some years. Subsequently rearrangements
had to be made with the principal creditors ; under the
last of these, which came into force in 1903, the deben-
ture-holders receive one-half of the profits in reduction of
the debt, and that arrangement made it possible to pay
a dividend out of the other half. The movement of the
debt during the past few years has been as follows :
„ 1903. 1907. 1908.
Mortgage-debentures .. £563,495 £542,407 £538,537
Mortgages .. .. 186,706 184,980 197,092
Other debts .. .. 67,583 22,561 5,787
The most cheerful feature of the recent an-
nouncements about this co. is the chairman’s statement
to shareholders at the recent meeting, that the directors
were having a revaluation made, and this “ would probably
wipe out the deficiency of £261.302 shown in the balance-
sheer.” As things stand, the dividend ought not to be
paid ; for if the co. has lost its capital and £261,302
besides (or £123,762 after deducting reserves), then every
P et| ny earned belongs to the creditors. If. however,
there isn’t any real deficiency, but if there is a substantial
surplus instead, then it ought to be shown, if only to
justify the directors in declaring a dividend. The mere
revaluation of assets won’t, however, add to their
earning power, and it won’t increase the profits.
Yet, even if the profits did grow considerably,
there would be plenty to do with them, apart
from the amount which has to be paid off the
debentures. Among other things, under the Victorian
Licensing Act of 1906, 3 per cent, of the value of the duti-
able liquor purchased by a pub has to be paid into a fund
to compensate the owners and licensees of closed-up
pubs; and two-thirds of the total tax the licensee mav
deduct from the rent. This deduction immediately
affects the capital value of a pub ; wherefore during
the past three years this co. has lifted portion of the pro'-
fits into a special depreciation fund, as follows :
Transferred to
Total Profits. Depreciation Fund.
1906 .. £7,612 .. - 3680
1907 .. 4,1U3 .. 1500
1908 .. 10,220 .. 2584
In the long- run, however, the closing-up of some pubs
will put up the value of the others ; and that is a set-olf
against this alleged depreciation. There is a large good-
will item also which oug-ht to be written off out of profits.
It is true that the item doesn’t now appear ; but, as
shown above, it is there all the same ; and, to get rid of
it, the value of those Carlton and United Breweries
shares ought to be steadily written down. For by this
time it must be clear to everybody that brewery good-
wills are not assets that are to be trusted as far even as
the first pub ; and that in most places isn’t very far.

This co. was registered in the early part of 1905 to carry
on the timber business of Allen Taylor, then Mayor o'f
Sydney, and R, McO. Anderson, a former town clerk of
Sydney. For the first two years the shares were in the
hands of these two pushing men or their friends ; then
they began to go on to the market, and have since become
a favorite industrial stock. When the public came in
during_ 1907 the accounts were given out for the
first time; but a “comparative statement” was
issued, covering the co.’s previous transactions, along
with an extract from the auditor’s report: “ The balance-
sheet is essentially one which is free from inflation.” As
the auditor was Albert Borchard, that certificate was a
first-rate send-off. But while the assets may be written
down hard, it will he noticed that reserves are very small.
Of course, the reserves in many cos. are fictitious, simply
because the assets are over-valued ; conversely it is possi-
ble for a co. to have internal reserves—reserves which it
never shows—by using undisclosed profits to write assets
down below their fair value. What this co. writes
off it rarely says (it publishes only a balance-
sheet, and no profit and loss account); but in a
rare spasm of talkativeness in December, 1908, the
directors said : “The profit and loss account, after mak-
ing full allowance for everything in the nature of bad and
doubtful debts, and depreciation £2397 (the usual
appropriation) ” was so-and-so. Still that didn’t neces-
sarily mean that £2397 was the usual amount of the
appropriation. At that date the assets less book debts
(good), advances and cash, amounted to £44,131 ; so the
profits written off all other assets (plant, stock, wharf
property, mills, etc.) were practically 5 per cent, of their
book value for that half-year. A further idea of the
extent to which revenue is used to write down assets
can be got from the following comparison

There was an issue of 15,000 shares at a premium of 2s. 6d.
during the past half-year ; this premium was added to
the Insurance Fund, which now stands at £5Oll, and is
not included in the reserves shown above. At the end of
the previous half-year this fund stood at £478 ; the share
premiums meant £1875 ; total, £2353. The other £2658 was
apparently added to the fund out of the year’s revenue—
or undisclosed profit, whichever you like. Possibly this
amount ought to be added to the profits shown above.

In the calculation of working costs m concen-
trating 1 mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best soiid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

This is the age of specialists, and it is scarcely
ths business of the employer to adjust claims for accidents
happening to his work people, although he is liable for
them under the Employers’ Liability Act of ’97. Insur-
ance is a science, and people who are not experts generally
come to grief when they dabble in it. So the wise em-
ployer takes out a policy with a well-known Insurance
Company such as the South British Insurance Company

just and unjust alike, so saving him time, worry and

The Callow Revolving Band Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it has already done in America, for all
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with vastly
improved extraction in the mills. At Broken Hill it has
been especially successful. It is an unqualified success as a
fine wet screen, and this is what all the mining world has
been seeking; it is also equally effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With it there is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh ; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine is a travelling band or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum over which the ore and its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers, and the
belt is caused to revolve continuously at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity of the material to be screened.
The machine is fully protected by patent rights. For
further particulars apply to the Austral Otis Engineering
Co., of Hanna Street, South Melbourne. This firm are the
manufacturers and sole agents for Australasia.* [1

Of the various “Sarco” fuel-saving appliances,
for which Gibson, Battle and Co., Ltd., 7 Bent Street,
Sydney, and 128 William Street, Melbourne, are agents,
that in most general use is their CO2- Recorder, which
has been installed in many factories and power houses.
This instrument speaks in a very definite way against the
amount of fuel which is wasted in smoke, and a user
states that, by installing a “Sarco” Recorder, his fuel
consumption was reduced from 9751 b. to 8941 b. per

It iust depends upon what work the Insurance Fund has
to do. Even, however, if nothing is insured outside,
£2658 is a very big year’s premium to pay ; which leads
one to think that the Insurance Fund is a handy hole in
which to stuff away surplus profits, though The Bulletin
doesn’t know wh.y the co. should stuff away so much
profits that what it leaves on view are not quite enough
to pay the dividend. At any rate, it looks a very clean
balance-sheet, and all the profits alleged to have been
earned appear to have been earned. Of course, there are
other points for investors to consider. For instance,
what are the powers of the two original and
are they removable, in case the shareholders should ever
want to remove them? The capital authorised is
£lOO,OOO, so that there are still 25,000 shares in
reserve: and that also is a point worth remembering.
It is probable, however, that the timber trade won t t*o
on showing the progressive figures of the past few years,
durum- which there has been not only remarkable activity
in the building industry, but also a more complete
“understanding” among the timber merchants than
there is at this moment.

Tnis co. is in the land-subdivision business; besides city
and suburban properties, it owns the Furracabad estate,
near Glen Innes (N.8.W.), portions of which have been
sold lately. The rest of the Glen Innes estate it either
works or leases; and it is probably from this source, as
much as from suburban subdivisions, that the extra profit
for the half-year has come. For years a steady improve-
ment has been shown; but the jump in the past six
months’ profits is quite unusual. Possibly a good deal of
the profits some years ago went towards writing down
assets; and no doubt the spring in values which has
taken place during the last four years or so has reduced
that drain upon profits. Meantime, however, other risks
have been taken, as this comparison shows:

“Other properties,” which, in spite of sales, have in-
creased considerably, include the Dobroyd estate, bought

£103,499; this money is in properties and advances,

heavily discounts the capital. It seems to be a case where
a re-valuation is called for ; for either the published

hopelessly at sea.

This sooiety, now in its 30th year, has a shareholders’
capital of £10,912, and it works wholly on that and its
reserves, having no deposits and no liabilities except for
a few trifling sundries. This means restricted profits, of
course, but it also means restricted risks. Mortgages and
premises represent £11,817 ; so the reserves are equal to

British Broken Hill has made arrangements
with the Zinc Corporation by which it will get prompt
payment of £40,000 for a dump of zinc tailings, instead of
£50,000 on long terms. The money will most likely be
put into a zinc concentrating plant to treat the new and
the balance of the old tailings.
C. S. A. Mines, Ltd., the owner of a Far-
Western (N.S.W.) show, which Great Cobar may some
day be glad to get hold of, publishes accounts when it
feels so disposed. A recent lot cover the period from
October 24, 1907, to June 2, 1909. For the 19 months the
mine expenditure charged to Profit and Loss is only £1252,
including salaries, £584; and in the same time Sydney
office expenses and directors’ fees, etc., amounted to
£l2BO. No wonder shareholders squirmed. But the
profit and loss account made things look worse than they
really are ; for most of the mine expenditure has been
charged up to Development, which, with main shaft and
drill-boring, now stands as an asset for £26,243, of
which over £13,000 has been added in the past term.
Whether the work is worth that many pounds
or less than half that many pence has still
to be proved. At present, evidently, the Board
can’t see its way to make any money out of this “ asset,”
wherefore six months’ suspension has been applied for.
Nineteen months ago, when the previous accounts were
published, the cash balances were £14,152. They have
now been reduced to £464, in spite of calls. The mine is
worth far more to the Great Cobar than to anybody else,
because it contains big bodies of basic ore, which is the
very thing the big mine wants as a flux for its silicious
ore. And on the prospects of being able to make a deal
with the Great Cobar the future of the C.S.A. largely
depends. *
Mount Morgan’s costs are high, though every-
body skims lightly over that subject. The net profit
(£228,215) falls short of the gold value contained in
copper (72,8220 z.) ; so all the copper and some of the
gold was absorbed in costs. The 106,952 tons of mundic
ore, averaging 9dwt. gold and also giving 453 tons copper,
must have j'ielded a big- profit ; but if all this is thrown
into the copper account, the cost of refined metal is still
considerably over £6O per ton. Costs are too high ; but
increased mining charges due to the creep provide some
excuse.
Mount Morgan’s general manager estimates that
88,000 tons have been added to the reserves of higher-
grade, and 154,600 tons to the reserves of lower-grade
copper ore during the year ; besides, “ a large amount pf
good grade ore has recently been discovered near the pre-
sent workings,” but he doesn’t know enoughabout it yet to
put it into figures. Apart from that “ large amount,” he
reckons there are 1,368,000 tons worth 3J per cent, copper
and Bdwt. gold, and 1,824,600 tons worth more than 3 per
cent, copper and 2£dwt. gold. The year’s output of
copper ore was 183,568 tons; and the metal recovered
works out at an average of 2'9 per cent, copper and
7-9dwt. gold per ton. There are also large quantities of
ore classed as low-grade, containing about 2£ per cent,
copper and up to-2dwt. gold ; and though these ores are
not included in the estimates it ought to be possible to
work them up profitably when the co. can get the Many
Peaks flux delivered cheaply by the railway that is now
being built.

“Myrtle”: Mt. Morgan says in its latest
report: “Development work has revealed larger quan-
tities of auriferous copper ore than were known of
previously. Yet the perpetual sink, sink, sink outside
the big co.’s pegs yields nothing except fees to solicitors
for winding up bankrupt cos. For years—in fact,
ever since the days of Morgan—cos. have been
looking for that mysterious “continuation of the
lode”; and the outer world, which reads of Mt.
Morgan’s dividends, hears nothing of these other mines’
calls. One, the Light of Day, had more than the usual
number of wild cats’ lives; but much dynamite and
energetic plugging gradually reduced the shareholders’
faith and capital. This co. and its predecessors had to
bullock with shafts, as near to the big freehold’s fence as
they could ; but later ones have had the diamond-drill to
help them. The Mount Morgan Extended found nearly
everything but the lode. On the western border, a
Charters Towers co.—mostly Tom Mills —has put a shaft
down 950 ft.., and now proposes diamond-drilling a further
2000 ft. When that is accomplished, even if it hasn’t
found the “continuation,” it will at least have the
deepest mining hole in Central Bananaland.

From Cloncurry (Q.): The Great Australia ia
closed down pending reconstruction, and this has caused
much local depression. There is some talk of erect-
ing a converter plant, but it needs to be seriously con-
sidered whether that would be justified without further
mine development. At the Hampden they are only
marking time, and they will have to push down to obtain
sulphides before much can be done. The Hampden has,
however, always preferred to dawdle about the surface in-
stead of sinking. Mount Elliott continues to produce matte
and blister copper, and there appears to be no difficulty
in smelting the ores, but getting the matte into the con-
verters has caused some trouble ; so the converters were
recently shut down for a while, and the matte was stacked.
Several alterations have been made, and, although only
a patched job has been done, blister copper is being
again produced. The manager and surveyor are busy
taking more levels, so it looks as if further plant altera-
tions were to be made. Still, though the plant is such a
jumble, there are cheerful features about Mount Elliott.
One is that the mine is supplying ore from which even
this plant can produce a high-grade matte ; another is
the arrival of the clearing gang, which means that quick
work is being done on the railway construction job.
* • * *
East Mexican, Charters Towers, has continued
its 830 ft. level past the 300 ft. mark from the old underlay
shaft sunk years ago. The formation, which was origin-
ally intersected at 810 ft. vertical, has opened out, and
looks better, though there is still only 6in. of quartz.
This moved the market a trifle ; but possibly overselling
had still more to do with the sudden jump. Day Dawn
P. 0., south of the Mexican, also comes in for more notice,
as it is sinking on a likely-looking- formation close to the
boundary.
East Oriental, Gympie (Q.), crushed 9203 tons
during the half-year for £19,280. Dividends were £BOOO
(Is. per share), which only left £653 to carry forward. This
co.’s formation is the deepest on Gympie, so the result is
an encouragement to the rest to keep on at it. State
Geologist Dunstan savs the same thing, especially a:s to
the Monkland end of the field. Since the western forma-
tion was struck the East Oriental has crushed 20,387 tons
for £44,933 ; and as costs are down to £1 os. sid., the co.
has been able to pay £20,000 to shareholders^
The Westralian Mines Department has done a
lotto help prospectors, but its methods need overhauling.
When a State battery is promised, the fact is duly
minuted, but nothing more is done until a cheap, second-
hand plant is thrown on the market. Then the Minister,
and the State Mining Engineer, and the Chief Inspector
of Batteries take a spell from office work to have a look
at the ruin, and if it is not too far gone, the
purchase is approved, and at the end of a year or so
the work of dismantling and re-erecting is started.
Meanwhile the poor devils w o have been raising stone
from their own leases* and putting off their creditors by
assurances of an early crushing, are driven to their wits’
ends for bare tucker. Some are driven to sell out for a
song and go elsewhere. At Youanme, in the Black Range,
■a second-hand battery purchased by the Mines Depart-
ment over a year ago is not yet running, although it was
promised for March. At the last moment it was dis-
covered that the pumping plant had not been sent up,
and the futility of running a battery without water was
recognised even by the Chief Inspector of Batteries.
Never since Westralia became a gold-producing
State has there been a better season for prospecting.
All over the country, from Norseman to Hall’s Creek, and
from Yalgoo to Like Way, splendid rains have fallen,
filling every clavpan, and making feed plentiful. Scores
of prospecting parties are pushing out into far-away
places, and some good finds may follow. Already on the
distafit Pilbarra fields gold has been found in five fresh
places, and when the railway gets there that district
should be worth watching. Thecountryfrom thecoastto
Nullagine, 150 miles inland, is rich in tin, copper, silver
and gold ; but without a railway anything in the way
of a goldbearing reef could not be worked at less than 2oz.
per ton.

It will soon be very hard to size up the value of
some Westralian gold stocks. Besides the Kalgoorlie
property and a big share interest in the Oroya-Black
Range, the Oroya-Brown Hill-hasagold mine in Nicaragua
and options over three others in Southern Cross (W. A.),
Tarquah (West Africa), and Tsehiksan (Southern Korea).
Lake View Consols also has a number of worldly posses-
sions outside Australia ; and the Great Fingall and one or
two others are trying to follow suit. Should the market in
these stocks soar in the future, speculators will be puzzled
to know whether it is on account of a good strike iii the
West or a rich development in one of the remote locali-
ties mentioned. On the other hand, if a slump sets in
they won’t know for certain whether the Labor party has
got' the upper hand in Perth, or something equally appal-
ling has occurred elsewhere.
London and Westralian Exploration, Ltd.,
issued its report for 1908 in London the other day. This
co. once did well out of scrip-gambling and mine flota-
tions, but some time back it loaded up with shares in
Zinc Corporation, Lancefield and other long-winded con-
cerns, and has been nursing the baby ever since. The
year’s receipts showed a surplus of £947 over office
expenditure ; but the balance-sheet shows a loss of £17,280
on account of shares which the Board was compelled to
sell in order to raise funds. When the accounts were
made up the co. reckoned it stood as follows Assets :
Shares and debentures (after deduction of £105,000 for
depreciation), £160,743; sundry debtors, £5847 ; cash,
£5227 ; total, £171,817. Liabilities: Secured creditors,
£20,569 ; unsecured creditors, £10,771 ; unclaimed
dividends, £386 ; total, £32,026. The directors whoop
about the successful outlook for Zincs, and also for the
Lancefield. The want of ready cash prevented the co.
from dabbling in any new business during' the year, and
for the time being its policy seems to be to lie low and
unload at the first favorable opportunity.
* * *
From a disinterested man who recently visited
the shows:—“Since J. M. Aldridge resumed control of
the Barrambie (W. A.) there has been a distinct move
forwards. The mine is now being worked systematically,
and handled by a man who evidently has faith in a con-
cern which has been badly mauled about. The ore is
plentiful, but hard to treat. It is mineralised dioritic
schist with a little quartz, and carries lead, silver and
copper, so that gold extraction is carried on under
difficulties. A first-class plant will soon be running
full time, and shareholders may look forward to
a cessation of calls, at any rate. Several good
shows have been opened up in the same part of the
country—one at Sugarstone, worked by a co-operative
party, being already in a position to pay for a winding
and crushing plant. Another, called the Bronzewing, is
also to be equipped with machinery, without a penny of
outside capital being asked for. In this respect the
prospectors are following' the example of the men who
found the Fenian, Ingliston, and other rich shows at
Meekatharra, some of whom are now drawing £5OO per
month each. One of the properties, recently acquired by
Hans Irvine, and traded off to the Black Range Co., is
locally considered a good honest proposition, but by no
means the best in the district. Meekatharra itself is now
a prosperous little town, with all the symptoms of per-
manency around it—one of the bright spots in W.A.
mining.”
* * * *
H. E. Rowe, chairman of the Long Tunnel
(Vic.), gets up in front of Minister Mcßride, and in cold
blood advocates the odious plan of making it legal for an
owner to search the miners’ bodies. It is a hateful
scheme and a dangerous one; it would put any
man at the mercy of a “mate” who, for any
reason, might want to get him out of the _ way.
Bendigo miners-threaten little short of murder if the
idea go son the statute book. For they are just at the
breaking point; they are so poorly paid that they reckon
they can’t stand any more at the price. The Gold
Buyers Act goes almost up to the point of personal
search ; and if that and the means the mines can take for
themselves can’t stop thieving, then the business is a
moral sink which had better be rooted out. If
the Chamber of Mines wants to do something for
the industry, which it says is heavily handicapped,
why doesn’t it fossick out some of the frauds
who rig the market, and, by various tricks,
rob the public of more gold in a month than would come
out of the average mine in a lifetime? Why hasn’t it a
fighting fund to chase down directors who pick up com-
missions on the sly, or legal managers who keep in with
the storekeepers? Why doesn’t it publish a list of cos.
that crush two tons for everyone reported? There are
scores of ways in which the mining shareholder is robbed.
Mr. Rowe might pursue a few of the robbers, and he will
mostly find them carrying 10 times more loot than the
most successful miner-thief gets away with. And—to
depart from mining for the moment —what about search-
ing bank directors? If every bank director had been
stripped and searched daily from 1883 to 1893 the famous
bank panic might have been averted. The case of Thomas
Bent even suggests that something might be done by
searching- Tory Premiers to see if they have land resump-
tions hidden about them.
* * * *
Bendigo’s balance-sheet for the half-year is
really better than is made out by ardent barrackers for
the Golden City. There is no South New Moon to sweeten
up the pudding ; but a lot of has-beens have returned to
show that they can still be used as ingredients. Veterans
like Collman and Tacchi, Horwoods, Suffolk United, and
Catherine Reef have all helped with their mite. Virginia,
in all the strength of robust life, tops the list with
£26,325 for the half-year, compared with which the others
make a modest show. New Moon is eclipsed, and for the
first time for years pays no dividend. Hustlers’ Reef is
another disappointment; ditto New Argus. Among the
old staggers, Johnson’s Reef will appear this term in the
list of div. earners, as the western ground is helping it to
the front. There is the chance also that the Collman and
Tacchi shoot will make into it. The field for the last
seven half-years shows up as follows :
Gold. Calls. Dividends.
June, 1906.. 116,0470 z. £95,190 £137,377
Dec., 1906.. 107,6860 z. 126,072 108,877

June, 1909.. 105,0030 z. 61,989 83,690
Better divs. mean that more cash is forthcoming to help
other mines out. Still in December, 1906, £126,072 was
forked out for calls, and only £61,989 last half-year ; and
that drop tells that the flow of outside capiial to the
field was largely checked by the way in which Bendi-
gonians landed the geptle public with wild cat stocks
during 1906-7.
Woah Hawp Canton, Ballarat East, has hit an
“ indicator” patch in a rise above the 850 ft. This is the
claim that Ah Ling, Ah Fat and a few score other almond-
eved Cantonese tried to make a do of, but which they got
into a tangle at the last. There was always gold here
and there ; but John is betterat alluvial than at quartz.
An attempt was then made to get J. Bull to put up stuff
to try and find some of the old patches, but John
wouldn’t listen. So at last the claim drifted
’way down to Geelong. The Western district luck
which has pulled the Black Range to the front wouldn’t
come the way of the Canton crowd, and the numbers
were just on the point of being hoisted, when word came
that gold had been found. Three days’ work on “ the
indicator” brought in about £3OOO worth of gold, got
out of a little patch 12ft. long. This put the co. a bit in
funds, so straightway it declared a dividend and put a
paltry £lOOO to reserve. Seeing the list of calls made, it
would have been thought that all the money would have
been kept in band for prospecting. But that isn’t the
Ballarat way of doing things.

Victoria Proprietary, Bendigo, has a London
Board with a Rupert Campbell and a Harcourt Bustard
to dispense urbanity as chairman and secretary. Still, to
give them their due, “ Viccy,” as the mine is known in
the Beehive, did more prospecting before it started to
stope than almost any other Bendigo property. Alto-
gether from 140,000 to 150,000 tons of quartz are proved
above 1100 ft. Bendigonians blink at being told this, for
they are not used to measure up reserves or to work out
gold contents save at the battery. The first substantial
reward came to the shareholders last year in the shape
of a 10 per cent, dividend. This is a pretty low
return for a gold mine, but it ought to be maintained
with over 6dwt. dirt if the stone is belted out on a decent
scale—which last, though, is also not according to Cocker
as spelt in Bendigo. Five years ago Bull nearly lost
the mine ; and now that he is off the rocks, he struggles
to keep away from peril. So besides paying the ruling
rate of wages he promises bonuses to the staff on dividends
paid. Even the truckers are to get their, little bit extra.
No doubt it will pay the co. ; it will promote loyalty,
economy, and hard work. It will lead to the biffing-out
of the skulker—always provided the distribution is big
enough to make men remember that they have an interest
in the concern.

Mount Lyell (Tas.) converters produced 736
tons copper, 58,9240 z. silver, and 868 oz. gold for a run of
four weeks. This improved return is partly due to rich
ore sent direct to the converters. The co. is making good
profits, and occupies a strong position as a cheap copper
producer. And its position will be still stronger if the
deepest level (llOOfc.) strikes it rich.
Mount Lyell will probably do the right thing,
and shortly come into line with Mount Morgan, which
now has its copper-refining done in Australia, The com-
mand of the Lyell output has been a great thing for
American market gamblers ; and that is one feature of
the business which the Lyell people don’t like.
A new idea is interesting life insurance people
in Britain, and is gettings itself considerably discussed a
proposal that life offices should offer free medical
examination 'to policy-holders every five years. It is
admitted that the offices couldn’t compel examination,
and they probably wouldn’t venture to make it part of
the contract; but if men did submit themselves for
medical examination, they might find out that they were
suffering from something or other in the incipient stage,
and would get advice as to how to ward the trouble off,
and thus continue to be premium-paying policy-holders
instead of dead and unproductive “ claims.”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, July 6, 1909.
Mr Dear Arini, —
*' That is done for a purpose. lam not per-
turbed !” So spake the deadly-calm, statuesque
London policeman-inspector unto Mrs. Pank-
hurst, after she had slapped his face three times.
And, thereupon, she smote him another twice
with considerable force ; a companion knocked his
beautiful hat over into France, and there were
arrests and confusion. It must have been a
splendid tableau —until the hat was knocked off.
The use of the word “ perturbed ” shows how the
smitten policeman had rehearsed for the great
historic assault. “ Perturbed ”is not a word for
roUgh, every-day wear ; it is one of the elevated
speech fragments, only used by authors; Orators;
aiid those about to die in front of several biographs
and fi herd of reporters. Probably Mrs. Pank-
hdrst duly intended to administer the first three
slaps and retire in good order with her forces and
hysterics; but tile calm,- Mercia-like “lam not
perturbed !” of the able-bodied policeman mad-
dened her to the final Wild-cat act; and she slew
his hat in Cold blood; Instead of posing beau-
tifully, that Inspector should have barked at her
in plain Irish, “Go’longwid you now!” Then
there wouldn’t have been any trouble. All police-
men should be taught to speak Irish. Ireland
produces the best shamrocks and policemen irt
the world; Another alternative would have been
to follow the Scriptures’ command, and return a
kiSs fot a bldw. If all suffragettes Were kissed by
the police it is hard to say what would happen.
The Dudley Lord is a rabid golfer. He golfs
every day but Sunday, and probably considers
the Lord’s Day a most inconvenient bunker. His
equal in enthusiasm, if not in skill, is Mr. “.Tim! ”
Allison.
Federal leading lady Dudley and State leadin'g
lady Chelmsford gave lustre to the National
Council of Women’s meeting last week, and the
former made one of those admirable little
sp eohes that always fit the occasion as
her gloves fit the speaker. The four
papers read were duplicates of those sent
to the Quinquennial Conference at Toronto, and
were on the subjects of “Consumption,”
“Music,” “Libraries for Children.” and “In-
dustrial Legislation in N.S. W.” The consump-
tion and labor papers were dealt with by,
respectively, Miss Wearne and Miss Duncan,
whose knowledge of their somewhat gloomy
subjects is expert and exhaustive. They were
not the kind of papers to which the lay he or
she would willingly lend an ear, but at the
Toronto Conference for which they were written
they will be hearkened to, not by the
lay he or she, but by experts primed with
the subjects. Like the other two papers—
“ Music” (by Mrs. Boesen) and “Libraries for
Children,” by Miss Margaret Windeyer—
they were not the choice of the writers, but
were written in reply to certain quvstions sub-
mitted by the International Council fo> Women.
The writers were the choice of the local body of
National Councillorettes and the selection was
abundantly justified. The afternoon was moist-
ended by tea-lapping.
At three in the afternoon yesterday (Monday)
Mrs. Chief Mayoress Allen Taylor began to
receive at her suite in the Town Hall, and
by four o’clock she and Mr. Layton, who
announced the guests, were wishing that the
suite were elastic, or else that the reception
were occurring in the body of the hall or in the
Palace Gardens. Most feminine Sydney and
suburbs rustled along to press the mavoressal
hand, drink tea, and murmur “S’glad.” Mrs.
Taylor accepted the pressure and murmur, wear-
ing a black charmeuse gown and sables and an
attractive item in pink and mauve toques.
The T. Murdochs—-Mr. and Mrs.—from Hobart
are at the Australia. So are the Claude Mac-
donalds of Victoria. She is one of Melbourne’s
smart dressers, the owner of one of those spare,
svelte, not to say lathy, figures around which the
latest yelp in gowns swathes right becomingly.
The twain are distinguished among society folk of
the Commonwealth, in that they have together
climbed to the top of one of M.L.’s highest moun-
tains. They are mighty fisher folk before the
Lord, and are sports generally.
The Harry Mannings and their toddler have
transferred themselves from Point Piper way to
Beulah Flats, near Admiralty House, and are
living the Venetian life in the big brick pile built
by Mrs. “ Havilah ” White. The lady herself and
her small girl inhabit a flat in the same amphibian
structure. It is, of course, wicked to so miscall a
building, but Beulah is half on the sea and half on
land, and you may catch a fish with a line from
your window while a cab waits for you at the
door. By the way, a dance in aid of the Seamen’s
Mission will be held in the dining-room of Beulah
Flats on the lGth of this month.
Mrs. Allen Taylor and the ladies who are work-
ing with her to raise funds to provide adequate
accommodation for the nurses at Prince Alfred
Hospital will surely win the required coin bv the
ball planned for August 10. It will be a beautiful
and variegated ball and a joy to the student of
ethnology. Mrs. Wilfr d Fairfax and Miss Lue
Dowling will general a black-and-white set; Mrs.
(Dr.) Hinder has an Egyptian set in training;
Mrs. Michaelis has selected "Night” for her
energies; Mrs. A. E. Hughes will a-hunting go
with her set; Mrs. (Dr.) Purser’s bunch of N. S.
Welshers ought to be popular; and Mrs. (Dr.)
MacLaurin will probably snare an “Australian
birds ” set. Mrs. Sinclair Gillies, Mrs. Gordon
Wesche, and Mrs. Pritchard Bassett are also aiding
and abetting the good work. Mrs. (Dr.) Mac Co-
rmack and Mrs. Anderson Stewart are hon. trea-
surers, and Mesdames B. Sheridan, PI. E. Rennie,
and V. Le Patourel are the hon. secs. “ Mixed,
Plain, Fancy Dress, and Poster ” the ball-to-be calls
itself.
Balls and rumors of balls will make July a
very whirly month. ’That worthy, unsectarian
charity, the Waitara Foundling Home, will take
the floor early in August with a dance to extract
funds for its good work. Further particulars will
appear at a future date.
If you are not too giddy to read some more
swiftly revolving intelligence, I will mention that
Mosman rose to the occasion again last Wednes-
day with its second annual ball to help swell the
funds of the Mater Misericordise Hospital at
North Sydney, and a crowded house was the
result. Fancy sets were the order of the evening,
and the palm branch was handed to Mrs. Dr. D.
Kelly’s set, “Autumn,” with its collection of
good-looking girls in short frocks of autumn tints.
They had berries in their hair, carried long-
handled baskets of berries iind grapes, and were
headed by little Dorothy Coffee holding aloft an
arch of autumn leaves. The second prize was
awarded to the “Dreadnoughts”—girls in short
frocks of grey, with men o’ war on their
heads* flags in their hands, and men o’ war in
White by their sides. They were headed by a
miniature admiral, Lady Poore, in a frock
reminiscent of Sea-green depths, gave away the
silyerwate arid said nice things to the takers.
One feature of the evening was an array of young
men, who waited in a row by the wall till their
“autumn leaf ” partners should fall out of the
grand march for dancing purposes. Altogether
the ball Was a huge success, due mainly to the
energies of the hon. secs.—Mrs.* J, H, Phipps,
Mrs. A.- Cambage, and Mrs. Wool land—and the
committee. The hospital should benefit to the
extent of £lOO or more.
Archbishop Wright, the hew Anglican prelate,-
is like Unto' the Dudleys irt that he is blessed with
youthful twins. It seems to Ule that a country
Whose Governot-General and Archbishop both
point the Way with personal property like twins
has only itself to blame if it continues to be
afflicted With a declining birth-rate problem.
The departing' SailmareZ Smith maidens Were
gDeri time to' gaZe oil the fade of a brand new
kinswoman before they left. On June 27 the
stork arrived at the Neutral Pay home of the Rev.
Hubert Saumarez Smith to the tUHe of one small
daughter. The Rev. is the only son of the late
Archbishop, and imported his bride from the Coldi
Land a few years ago.
The City Health Officer, Dr. W. G. Armstrong,
and family are back from foreign holiday parts,
and the doc. has settled down to work. His
homing lets Dr. Sinclair, his temporary deputy,
off the chain.
Visiting strangers within our gates are the
Rarnsdens —Captain and Mrs. They have left
the hostel at which they were abiding, and are
staying with the Dudley potentates at Federal
Government House.
The Francis Suttor’s second son Reginald and
Miss Hope Mayne, third daughter of Mr. Alex.
Mayne, went into matrimonial partnership last
week. A large contingent of Suttors and Sut-
torial connections graced the orange-blossoming.
Concerning weddings—there’s one due for the
very young Dr. James Hughes, second son of
Solicitor John Hughes, Vice-President of the
Executive Council, who is having the flattering
thing said to him on his engagement to pretty
Miss Holly Coffee, second daughter of the much-
travelling Frank Coffee, of Chatswood. Mr.
Coffee is at present adding his energies to the
sum of America-at-Work. The bridegroom-elect
is a prominent muddied —I mean, he’s a con-
spicuous footballer.
George Shenton, ofWestralia, recently deceased
in England, had such a fondness for tripping to
the Bull Country that he made the journey some
25 times. He succeeded his father in the store-
keeping business at Perth in 1867, those being the
days when pearlshell and sandalwood were such
valuable assets in trade. He had a quiverful of
daughters, who are all married and well-dowered.
Also he had a smattering of sons, but he only
smattered moderately in the matter of sons.
The Glaciarium is earning for itself an indif-
ferent reputation among the local accident insur-
ance offices. A few days ago Mrs. Arthur Allen
broke her wrist on its hard, chill surface. About
the same time a fair unknown was led off with a
badly-gashed lower extremity or leg—a male
skater having hacked her in passing with his steel-
clad hoof. Minor casualties have been as frequent
as grievances in a State Leg. Ass. The big crowd
that scratches madly round, and the incompetence
and extreme youth and the rashness of a section
of it, are responsible.
Someone sends me The Bodleian, containing an
interview with the author of “Mrs. Gramercy-
Park.” An ex-Sydneysider (Mr. Goring Thomas)
is the author of the queerly-named story, and if
it is like his interview it ought to be in great
demand at the Kermadecs and other thicklv-
uninhabited centres. The interviewer got nothing
out of the writer about the scheme, ideas, or plan
of his literary campaign. He got instead en-
treaties not to wear a purple necktie, was asked if
“he remembered the jingle on the purple cow,”
and was told that “my father had a sovereign
remedy for the cure of ideas in children.” It
suggests a mad pursuit of Oscar Wilde’s literary
style, and utter failure to catch up.
At a recent Outback wedding reception, held in
the parlor of the bride’s home, the flushed and
happy bride’s contribution to the musicale was
“The Death of Nelson.” Later the company
joined in the singing of “ Home, Sweet Home,”
and the newly-wedded departed for their humpy
on the next allotment, amidst ringing of cattle
bells and showering of rice.
European mountaineers are making much of a
Mrs. Bullock Workman, who has climbed alone a
Himalayan peak 21,350 ft. high. She has really
lived up to, or climbed up to, the name of Bullock
Workman.
A passer-by from Perth (W. A.), who saw Misses
Grace Palotta, Celia Ghiloni and Rose Musgrove
in the City on the Swan, says they told him they
had come to Australia nearly shillingless. They
had spent all their large earnings in Shanghai and
Hongkong on the loveliest silk and lace and linen
fabrics. When they were let loose on these fields
of cloth of gold the spirit was unwilling and the
flesh was weak. The actresses were tempted,
and fell—down before the drawn-thread work and
the rosy, spindrift crapes. Evidently the Hugh
Ward co. will bring other attractions here besides
“A Bachelor’s Honeymoon.”
As big a section of the pride and might and
glory of London society as the house would hold
were at Covent Garden to hear Tetrazzini on her
first appearance there as “Lucia.” An Aus-
tralian girl was amazed at Tetrazzini’s gowning,
which was directoire and eel-skinny. Not at all
the kind of gowning Lucy Ashton affected either
before or after her attack of homicidal mania.
Carrie Moore’s second-best boy—that is to say,
the one she might have married if she hadn’t
lavished the treasures of her young affections on
Percy Bigwood—one Proctor, recently went broke
at Manchester. His story was brief and simple.
He was a life-insurance clerk earning £5OO a year,
when his father died leaving him about £12,000.
That was in 1907. He put down £5303 as spent
on 12 brooches, 23 pins, nine bracelets and three
pairs of earrings. There was also a mention of
40 rings costing £7650, a diamond searfpin (£215),
a bracelet (£365), a very special diamond ring
(£420), a necklace, some unset diamonds and a
pile of sundries. The assets seem to have been
chiefly pawn-tickets, dogs and some promises of
financial aid from his mother. It was a very
sudden story, all things considered.
How often, by the way, the person who comes
into money after a life of toil, does it in with wild
fatuousness. The hero of “Ten Thousand a
Year,” Thackeray’s Yellowplush, and, to take a
real-life instance, Benzon, the “Jubilee Plunger,”
are all rigidly true to type. Here the miner who
Strikes it amazingly rich, and is found a year or
so later back at toil, having liquidated the fruits
of his shovel at a favorite hostelry, exemplifies the
immemorial way of the suddenly-affiuent with his
Wealth. Of course, the hereditarily-wealthy
young man does the dash which terminates
at the portal of the Insolvency Court often
enough l , but not nearly as frequently as cir-
cumstances (bis ingrained tastes and habits, and
normal low-grade brain-capacity) would lead
one to expect. One of the simplest young men I
have met was an A.D.C., with a tidy income in
addition to his modest gubernatorial screw. He
habitually eschewed calls in favor of trams,
economised in cigars, and was indifferent whether
he dined off vintage fizz or local beer. Withal,
he was open-handed when need arose. I think
the' explanation of the lavisliness of the Proctors
of this world is to be found in the fact
that they, never having had much money, elevate
the dross into a fetich. They get an
exaggerated idea of the glory that resides in
blewing coin—an idea that does not obsess your
human who has always existed with coin in the
neighborhood of him, and has thus been enabled
to appreciate to the full the lamentable inglori-
ousness of most of those to whom it appertains.
The most enthusiastic bowers-down before the
Auriferous Calf, the most reckless pourers of cash
libations at its hoofs, are often those who, during
most of their time, have stood at a great distance
from the gorgeous brute.
Miss Eva Moore (playing in America), sister of
the heavily-jewelled Caroline Bigwood, is matri-
monially engaged to Mr. Patrick, of the Nellie
Stewart eo. She is known fore and aft the foot-
lights as “an awfully good little thing who minds
her church,” and hasn’t put her foot through any
of the Commandments. Bridegroom-elect is a
Maorilander, and was by way of being a medical
man when the footlights dazzled him.
Mrs. Dulcie Deamer Goldie, the youthful
phenomenon who wrote those prehistoric stories
for the earlier numbers of Thk Lone Hand, went
through Sydney lately on her way back to M.L.
where her people abide or hang out. When she
returns, the Hugh Ward co., piloted by her
husband, will be in Sydney, and the pair will
settle at 'Mosman. The Deamer girl and the
Goldie man met through a curious coincidence. He
was travelling in M.L. on business for J.C.W.,
and a fellow railfarer in the same compartment was
a newspaper girl on her way to interview the
winner of the Lone Hand prize. Goldie, as one
(of the losers) who had “tried for” the prize, was
naturally interested in talking about the winner.
Later the newspaper girl introduced them. Then,
love’s young dream was dreamed. Whilst in
India Mrs. Goldie went into strange by-ways,
and she will tell of her experiences later in book
form.
Mrs. Pinhey, mother of “ Rosina Sydna,” has
left Sydney for Milan, where she will join her
young singer daughter, and cherish her during her
future engagements.
The Theatre for the current month has the
first portrait taken since her marriage of Betty
Ohls McQuade. A floppy coat and a plate-hat
with two tufts of floral goods and a brace of
strings are the aids to a face that the photographer
has contrived to make saintly. All the sauciness
and worldliness are eliminated, and there remains
only the expression necessary to faces in the
orchestra stalls of the cherubim. When Mrs.
Betty applies to Father Peter, she need only
hand in a copy of that photograph.
Julius Knight and Miss Beatrice Day play in
Sydney three nights on their way to Brisbane,
after Nellie Stewart has removed her loveliness
from Her Majesty’s. Report says that Miss
Day’s undeniable figure has lost too many pounds,
and hand-feeding may be necessary to bring the
lady up to her old standard.
The Sydney Stage Society intends to put on
“Candida” at the end of the month. Also it
intends to ask Mrs. T. H. Kelly if she will play
the name part. It is a part that should suit the
lady, and she has had U.S. experience in Shaw
plays.
Scrubbing Made Easy ! Now, isn’t that a more
blessed phrase than Mesopotamia, or Yass-
Canberra, or Chapzander? Mrs. Blanche Brosa
is the inventor of the movable stand that
bears her name, and the thing is going to save the
housewife, and housemaid much labor. It is a
circular circumstance on three castors, into which
the bucket fits snugly ; so there will be no further
need for the scrub-lady to stand up to lift her dish
of slop from spot to spot. She may retain her
devotional attitude, and with a touch the bucket
glides in the direction she wishes. Mrs. Brosa
will take orders for the flying bucket at thedepdt,
236 Liverpool-street.
The yearly Sheep Show has again exploited
the overclothed sheep, and put ribbons on his
horns, and has enabled the State Governor to say
platitudes about the great natural resources of thi3
favoured country. Sheep shows are always held
in cold clammy weather and on bleak spaces;
and beefy-looldng men lean over the pens and part
the dirty wool as if seeking for lost property. A
hue like unto the petals of the tea rose is disclosed,
but no notice is taken of that. Merely something
is said of “ density and texture.” The sheep,
even if he be a grand champion, is too stupid and
too overdressed to know that anyone is
taking liberties with his all-wool garment. I once
travelled a short sea journey with several hun-
dred sheep, and nothing duller, more irresponsive
or uninteresting came out of the Ark. They
made me feel an objection to the idea of my being
drafted amongst the sheep on the Last Day.
Why should the New Testament have selected so l
stupidly negative an animal as the sheep as thq
synonym of a good Christian. The goat is a much
more amusing and brainy creature, yet his human
equivalent is to be sent to a place where the heat
is over-proof and there are grills at all hours.
Meantime the beknighted Suttor says it’s been the
biggest show on record. The most prizeful of the
prize stupids came from Mudgee ; also the clever-
est sheep-dog hailed from Maoriland.
Yours affectionately.
AKENEHI.

The Most
Remarkable
Piano Success
of the Age.
Many pianos have what is known as a, “ local reputation.” In a
certain City or State they may be well known, but outside of a limited area
there is no demand for them.
The Steck Pianola Piano has a reputation which extends all over the
world, into every country where there are cultured music-lovers. In
London, in New York, in San Francisco, in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and St.
Petersburg, the Steck Pianola Piano has a strong following amongst the
most progressive people. That is what is meant when it is said that the
Pianola Piano is the standard instrument of its class throughout the world.
It is always agreeable to know that one’s personal judgment is ratified
by those whose opinions carry the most weight.
The Steck Pianola Piano is an upright piano of the highest grade, and,
in addition, contains within its case a complete Themodist and Metrostyle
Pianola, the only piano-playing device endorsed by the greatest living
musicians.
It can be played by the fingers on the keyboard in the usual way.
It can be played by means of a Pianola action within its case.
There is nothing to move up in front of the keyboard. To change
from hand-playing to Pianola-playing it is only necessary to slide back a
panel in the front of the case, and insert a perforated roll of music.
If unable to call, you should write for a catalogue. Simply write and
ask for Catalogue C. You will get it at once, post paid.

The MOST DESIRABLE TYRE
Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture cf the most desirable Motor Tyres —and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.
The Continental Co.’s interpretation of the word
“reliability” is “ability to get there,” and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to be certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.
CONTINENTAL TYRES
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, July 5, 1909.
My Dear Yarrik, —
When the Australian Parliament bursts into
session it takes much of the glory off the State
House’s special matinee. On Wednesday,
Governor Carmichael got his little axe and hewed
open the local legislative proceedings. The
Carmichael has a set back in his cue for entrance.
Lord Dudley has the magnificence of the grey
steps for a background; but the local Ex-
cellency has to make his humble approach
along a less impressive avenue and pull up
at the barnlike Exhibition Building. On
this occasion he was late for his cue. I
think the Excellent gentleman had to wait for a
new hook to be sewn on his collar, and then it
was done too hastily—probably Missus Car-
michael couldn’t find a thimble in the flurry.
Anyhow, his poor Excellency was tugging dis-
tressfully at his gold-laced neck gear all the while
he muttered and read that “things were in a
highly satisfactory condition.” It was evi-
dent, too, that Missus Carmichael had had
a rush to put on her hat. She didn’t
wear the new one with the ostrich feathers
—but the same dumpy lid of nondescript
colors. Mr. Carmichael, waiting at the motor,
said: “Oh, come on! Be thankful you have a
hat at all —look at mine!”—or words to that
effect. His feathered headgear was flattened
horribly. Secretary Victor Hood probably put it
under the motor seat to keep the feathers in curl,
and the belated Governor was forced to bash the
thing with several thumps before he could get it
into any kind of shape to read the speech with.
Colonel Stanley backed up the State Excellency
on one side, like a gilt poker high, and Com-
mander Tickell tried to make his few roly-poly
inches of height look like a balance on the other
side. Secretary Victor Hood looked preternatu-
rally solemn and held the notes, but the whole
party felt as if it had just caught a train by the
skin of its shins. The opening was so soon over
that the Tired Man forgot to rise. President
Henry Wrixon bobbed up and down in his chair
upon one or two false alarms, waiting for the Ex-
cellent rising—it reminded one of Daie and
O’Malley, recently of the Pickards’ show. Then
an aide prodded the Governor man in an interstice
of the gold lace, and he jumped to attention. It
was the most crude performance imaginable—
especially for pros, who have so often played their
parts.
President Wrixon’s wife dispensed tea to the
famished political wives, who had broken away
from home after a mere snack of lunch to be on
time in the packed Council Chamber. Mrs.
Wrixon put on a black feathered bonnet of pea-
cock blue, and pump handled at the door of one
of the corridor rooms. The dressing was surpris-
ingly dull, but the grey London-like weather was
probably responsible. The Bent knight defied
the atmosphere and looked quite smart. I don’t
know just the pattern of his tie and weskit, but
it was something new-, and the circle the weskit
incloses is growing perceptibly less. Daughter
Mrs. Bleasby wore a smart rig out in ame-
thyst color. She is a sort of feminine study
built on her father’s lines. The faces are absurdly
alike. Miss Huntly, his fair-haired niece and
adopted Bentian daughter, frocked herself
in blue. The Oliver feminines were much in
evidence and most frockily smart, from their
crushed silk hats, all the way down their
slender sheath frocks to their ultra-smart shoe-
toes (riot tips—tips are not the thing). Eva
Robertson got herself into a swagger mould of
putty color, with a black undertaker’s hat—a
most fashionable lid. Pretty little Mrs. Geoff
Syme wore a banana-colored cloth, cut with the
most insidious, long graceful tails—the skirt
wriggled like a glidesome snake, and the whole
thing was braided. She topped the perfection
with a Miss Muffit turban of mink fur. She had
a miniature copy of herself—a sister—along with
her, clad in glad togs of Wedgewood blue and
ermine. A Queensland colonel’s wife wore a
purple Varden bonnet and some tropical color on
her lips and cheeks, and veiled the pomegranate
tint with a neurotic, purple-spotted veil. Most
of the political wives were apparent in spite of
furs tailed like rabbit-ohs, and all gabbled gossip
as they drank tea in a dim matinee light of colored
electrics buried in oak and laurel leaves.
On Saturday the Grand National and a spanking
meeting. Elemington could take a challenge,
easy, for the best-dressed July meeting it has ever
boasted. It was a brisk, cold day, without wind
and without rain. Melbourne has been fairly
wallowing in a meteorological depression, trimmed
with Scotch mist and tornadoes, and this let-up
in the playful brutality of the elements brought
out a mushroom crop of smooth, even tempers,
perfectly groomed hair, hats that dared not poke
their feathers out of their cardboards heretofore,
and frocks of winter colors, such as one might see
in a vision of the Better Land. This winter
makes for good taste in fig-leaves. Silky, cling-
some woollen weaves are the fashion ; in plain
cloth, moreover, the colors travel warmly through
hundreds of tones of browns and prunes up to
twilight purples, and trek off in another road
through tender bronzy greens. These hues are
harmonies ; not one of them is a shout.
All the Naice women - whizzed out in their
motors, clothed clingfully in these tints and
wrapped cosily in the bearish hug of furs. Even
the Carmichael lady—she of the sonsy smile—
swore off her dowdy hat and appeared in a smart
top-dressing. She was all in black from tip to
toe. It was such a happy little hat with crisp
curls to its feathers. It still breathed of dainty
tissue wrappings, and had never once been
sat on. That black hat was the top note
in the day’s frocking and hatting. Nothing
lightens a feminine heart like a “duck”
of a headgear ; nor, for that matter,
does anything more effectually lighten a male
pocket-book. The bride of the minute, the
feminine part of the Clarke-Power combination,
put on a few inches of extra dignity with a rose-
leaf rig. It was pinky-red, and tailored into coat
and long skirt over a mysterious pinky-red
inwardness. A black hat the size of Hoadley’s
chimney or the firemen’s watch-tower waved
plutocratic plumes far up into the ether. I did
not get a good view of the top of it, having had to
leave my aeroplane at home behind the washhouse
door because it was my sky-pilot’s day out. The
bride is by nature a little dumpling, but her head-
gear went one better than stilts. , Several pelts of
flossy black fox made imposing width.
The beautiful Rupert dame is away in the coun-
try —staying on a brother's sheep run. Papa
Rupert is still chasing sisal hemp in Papua.
There is no news as to whether he has overtaken
the brute. One of the little Power sisters
wrapped her light suit in inadequate feathers,
and wavered about in the Important shadow.
Mrs. Raleigh danced about as lady-in-wait-
ing, with pretty pink roses on her pretty fair
head, and squirrel furs warming a blue
suit. Mrs. R. 0. Casey wore the Same Hat.
One of the Landale girls hung a whole polar bear
—a white one—over her shoulders. Mrs. Newly-
wed Rupert Boyd got her small self into a jaunty
tailor rig with a Dolly Yarden bonnet. Ruby of
the Maddens, wrapped in dimples and a vast scarf
of fur, had the fairest of the young Baillieu
brothers dancing in hot attendance. Baby sister
Beatrice played a pained game of gooseberry.
Leslie of the clan and a Baillieu sister are at the
Australia in Sydney, on their way to Kosciusko.
Mrs. Norton Grim wade got herself into snowy
white serge, but her purple hat shrieked like a
cry in the night. Tom Hogan was busy doubling
“ King of Cadonia ” Clayton. They are as like as
two chimney-stacks, and both wreathed them-
selves in grey (I like to get poetical about
men’s attire—their sartorial perspective is so
limited, poor things!). Mrs. Tom was a
beneficent picture in the smartest of black
from tip to toe, like the Governor lady.
Willie Kelly wore a black and white tie like a
magazine illustration, and he walked with a Bond-
street strut. Lawyer Croker carried his P.D.’s
ever in close attendance on the Excellent Car-
michael. He seemed to be trying to out-aide
secretary Victor Hood. Pretty Mrs. Captain
Boyle put an autumn-brown frock into the guberna-
torial picture. The O’Hara doctor man was
in his racing element. Pretty daughter Nan
topped her locks with a ferocious bearskin
busby. Geoffrey Age Syme brought wifey’s pretty
little sister with big bows on her shoes, and the
minor addition of some green tailored fig leaves.
Mrs. Bank Urquhurt splashed some ferocious
feathers against her hair, and indulged in hot
mustard-colored clothes. The Whiting girls were
demure in granny bonnets and smart tailorings.
Byron Moore wore his white beard, and his
daughter donned blue tailorings and a big warm
muff of a busbv. If you cram yourself far enough
into one of these fur turbans, and swathe the
semi-circle of visible phiz with a spotted veil, the
effect is decidedly It. A good many pretty
mummeresses sported themselves in the crowd.
Julius Superbus was not thereto lead the mum-;
mer-man beauty brigade, so the minors shone
without a rival. Roy Redgrave, with holly in his
buttonhole, wore a grocer-man pencil behind his 1
beautiful ear. In the earlier “Among those pre-
sent” I forgot the Frank Madden daughter. She
trailed over the lawn in lilac silk, and wore a lilac
turban that dangled amethyst wheels over her
temples. Mamma Frank plodded uncompromis-
ingly alongside in sturdy black coating.
The Charlie McEvovs gave a dinntir on Friday
night—a set of twenty-two —and then the whole:
crowd “went on” to the blossoming out of the
Tait bud. Papa and Mamma Railway Tait gave
a gorgeous party to usher their grown-up progeny
into the world. They took the P’ran Town Hall
(the big one) for the dance, and the affair was
beautifully done. Mrs. Tait buried herself in a
gown of intricate loveliness, and the bud, of
course, wore her debutante white. There was a
debutante set —all white, with the exception of
a Clegg maiden, who insisted in being in
the set, and yet declared she was not officially
out. She scandalised the white-clad novices by
sporting a spangled dress—only ankle length—
and decorating herself all over with unorthodox
pink roses. All the Maddens were there and
looked just Madden. Miss Ruby of the dimples
got the Lorgnette Stare for dancingovertiine with
the most devoted of Baillieus. The Reggie
Clarke-Power bride looked discontented in darkish
blue toggery. The Jack Fiskens were fashionably
bored. Claire Whiting looked as if she had
stepped out of Arcadv. Chiffonv, misty blue
floated over her pink frills. Sister Eileen glowed
in Asiatic splendor—a daringeharmeuse of cherry
color and white. The Charlie McEvoy girls looked
crisp as bandbox maidens, Nancy Price danced
as if she had not come a cropper at the hunt two
days before. Jean Langtree got herself into what
looked like a white bathgpwn with a cross between
a toreador sash and a bath towel tied around her
middle. Tom Grantham got another instalment
of chaperonic glassv eye by trying his step too
often with the McGeikie maiden—the step-
daughter of the bored Fiskens. Jack McComas
was there, in full swing, and racing Petersen.
Many important ones made things brilliant, but
it was essentially a young people’s affair. The
new Boston dance had a good innings on the pro-
gramme. Four times it rose up, to the glory of
the initiated and the undoing of the not-up-to-
date.
At the Tait girl’s blossoming, the ’Murkan
spirit loomed out in rehearsals. The ’Murkans
rehearse everything except deaths; even wed-
dings are not left out —there is no conventional
sentiment spilled over the Yankee girl’s barter.
In the case of this dance, the debutante
set had been carefully drilled. The result
was a stately minuet crusted with curtseys that
swept the floor, and decorated with the Downcast
Eve that tells of a fluttering young heart within.
The effect was a decided improvement tin the
anxious debut ante scatter as it is usually pulled
off. It was a graceful poem—a poem composed
by clever Florrie Green.;
There was a truly Dollar-land splashing in coin
over the decorations. One cluster of roses in the
ceiling—a tremendous effect of bloom—let the
happy florist send in a bill for £5O just on its
little own.
Archbishop Carr was guest-in-chief at Margot
Duffy’s wedding, and proposed the bride’s health.
He spoke tenderly of sturdy oak and clinging
vine, and other quite original thoughts.
The bride is the daughter of Barrister Gavan
Duffy. The happy man is H. E. Starke. . This
is a notable union in law circles. Starke is easily
the most brilliant of the younger barristers. He
has sprung into great demand at the Bar, and
even in these times of little litigation his clerk
brings him in two coal-scuttles full of briefs every
morning. There is, by the way, no other man at
the Victorian Bar who dares such liberties with
the Court as are indulged in by Starke.
The knot-tying was at St. Mary’s, and the social
shivoo followed at the house of an aunt of the
bride—nice and handy to the church. The Chief
Justice proposed the health of the bridesmaids.
There were 300 guests, all told, to drink the
champagne. All the Madden throng followed
the Chief Justice, and the whole affair was, in
polite words, a snorter. The bridegroom owns a
most beautiful nest whither to take his new acqui-
sition—Calembreen, on Toorak-road, Kooyong.
It is a huge place, set in a forest of timber. One
gets glimpses of a red-tiled roof through acres of
climbing roses—a sort of Sleeping Beauty Palace.
The Whitings farewelled at a shrill top note
last week. The At Homes took on the atmo-
sphere of a carnival, and extended solidly ovet-
two days and nights. On Tuesday, Mamma
Whiting was At Home in all seriousness.
Everything feminine with a handle to its
name wore its top-notch frock and responded
to the pump handle. The Madden dame
came across from t’other side of the street
(where Cloyne is), and the Fysh dame from
Tasmania. The Best dame also transpired.
The Winter Irvings turned up in clan, as
did the Cummings and the Grimwades and
the Isaacs and others great in the land.
Muriel Cumming sang, and the two pretty daugh-
ters warbled in foreign tongues. One was fawn-
clad and the other in grey, like a nun. Mrs.
Whiting frothed a creamy lace gown round her
small pretty figure, and sister Miss Conn gloried
in amethyst erdpe from Japan. The At Home over-
flowed into the next day, when the daughters said
“All Hail ! ” and “ Farewell! ” and “ What-oh ! ”
to the youth of their acquaintance, and the said
Youth of both kinds helped to finish up the gor-
geous feeding left over from the more important
grown-up kine. The Girl of the visitors flocked
in surreptitious groups to Claire Whiting’s room,
to peep at her trousseau and the piles of presents
that are flocking in for the wedding in September.
Arthur Streeton is again in our midst, and whilst
the Vic. Society of Artists is trying to lure the
world in general to its very out-of-the-way annual
exhibition at Eastern Hill, the festive Arthur
will be running a show of his Venice Pictures at
the Guild Hall, which is less out of the way than
the Art Gallery aforementioned. These Pic-
tures of Venice were exhibited'only three months
ago in London, at the Alpine Club Gallery, where
the critics said nice things about them. Seem-
ingly Mr. Streeton packed them up (the paintings,
not the critics), and was away to Australia with
them as soon as they were off the walls of the
“ Alpine.” Or perhaps he packed off the pictures
only, and left himself in London. Anyway, the
invitation t» the private view on July 13 suggests
that the artist will be there himself, as well in the
flesh as in the spirit.
Miss Trenchard, of this city, has got herself en-
gaged to Sir Henry Greene Kelly, who has been
Chief Justice of Southern Nigeria for the past de-
cade. He arrived here recently, via your old city.
Theycatch their Chief Justicesyoungin themalarial
regions of the Dahomey native, wherefore this
representative of the great Kelly clan is not the
oldster his position would suggest. He is a tall,
fair person with a Hibernian accent, a cheery eye
and the capacity for life which those assets mostly
connote.
Oh Monday the Austral Salon extended the
spacious hand of welcome to Miss Catharine Hay
Thomson, an Australian journalist who has lately
returned from England. Miss Thomson pushed'
the pen much during her absence, and looks well,
but the British damp and cold froze her soul, and
she was driven to pack her suit-case and skip back
to the land where the Children of the Sun have
their dwelling.
The Felton Bequest Committee has its grasp
firmly on Walter Withers. It has annexed his
“ Silent Gums,” that peaceful canvas of accurate
botanical study aqd materialised Australian atmo-
sphere.
Sassietv is tonguing Rosie Musgrove’s marriage
with Mr. Douglas Garrick. Australian mammas
(those who have taken ship to Colombo and
beyond, and considered the whale and the hus-
band and the prawn and the other marvels of the
deep) speak of him as a “desirable.” He is a
tea-planter of Ceylon, with a quite opera.-bouffe
scale of wealth. Rosie is not leaving the
Stage—yet awhile, anyway. The bridegroom
is a Maorilander, though he transferred his
business talents to the Spicy Isle. Miss Mus-
grove met her Douglas on tour, and made
troth in Colombo. Then the company (Hugh
J. Ward’s company of comedians) departed
for its Chow-Jap scramble, intending to return
to Colombo where the knot was to be fixed.
A cruel management decided to bring the crowd
direct from Singapore to Westralia. The man
was equal to the occasion, however; he jumped
aboard the speedier liner from Colombo, and was
in Fremantle to meet liis bride. They were
married on June 14 quite secretly, to escape fuss
and flummery, and hubby has attached himself
like a barnacle to the co.
This is the third marriage in the co. since the
tour started 10 months ago. Manager Goldie
was the. first culprit. Celia Ghiloni followed suit
with Mr. Ronald McPherson, in Bombay (they
had Bombay duck for a wedding-cake). There
is a fourth engagement pending, but it’s a dead
secret.
From “Rosna,” of Adelaide :
Our new Excellency turns out to be a golfer as well as
an Admiral and a K.C.M.O. and the father of twins.
The other Saturday he and Captain Wright went down
to Seaton, and gave the local caddy a little gentle exercise.
That was private and unofficial ; but on August the 14th
Seaton will have a top-hatted visit to celebrate the
closing of the amateur championship meeting.
The festive pasteboard is now pursuing the younger
grown-ups, bidding them put on the garb of some
celebrity who is too dead to be annoyed about it, and
come to a dance at the Residence on July 28. This is
exciting, for it is a long and dull space since anything in
the way of a fancy revel happened at Government House.
But, then, the present Exes., having two glad young
Excelleneettes to give things a gentle push along,
are doing more entertainment than anyone who has
governed us since the Dark Ages.
Others are trying to live up to the new pace set by the
Residence. The John Downers have asked society in to
dance on July 9 ; and during this week the Dr. Niesches
give two revels —one for grown-ups, and the other for the
infant mandarin, milkmaid, king and cobbler. Also, the
Semaphore Tennis Dance, famed among suburban scram-
bles for general good management and a maximum of
partners, will cause the great invited to rejoice on August
6 ; while the great uninvited will stay at home and try to
persuade itself that it’s glad it hasn’t to go out on such a
beastly night as this !
Ermyntrude, who isn’t yet quite “ out,” is also wearing
the bland smile of content; for there is shortly to be a
dance at St. Peter’s College, where the Very Best People
send their boys to get the final polish put on their Latin
verbs.
Whfen Adelaide can manage to stop dancing it gets
married. On Tuesday of last week the Voice was re-
quested to put flowers in its hair and breathe its best at
Christ Church, where North Adelaide goes to regard its
best friend’s millinery. The occasion was the presenta-
tion of Miss Handysirie to Mr. H. R. Trude, which same
was kindly done by Mr. Bradshaw, a relative of the lady.
The bride wore raiment embroidered with roses, and a
hat with a pink lining, and sundry pearl necklets and
armlets. One of Speaker Cole’s daughters—Ruth, to be
exact —who stood beside her and begged her to bear up,
wore pale blue, with blue feathers waving from golden
millinery. The Bradshaws, who dwell ’at Medindie,
beckoned the favored few in to tea, and then packed
Mr. Trude and his new possession off to seek honey in
Queensland. After which they will run hack toWestralia.
Another day Beatrice Dobbie was fastened into the
holy bonds with Mr. Charles Ives, who squats at Oakland
Hills station, away up in the Far North-West. The
henediet won some renown as a lieutenant in the late
Boer scramble and disorder in South Africa.
But the most interesting wedding of the season will
happen on July 13,' when Miss Ilarmer will (all going well)
become Mrs. Archdeacon Bussell. The lady is a sister
of ex-Bishop Harmer, once of Adelaide and now of
Rochester ; and neither bride nor benedict is at the young
and giddy age. The wedding feast will be spread at Chief
Justice Way’s home, Monteliore.
If it didn’t seem wrong to mention anything but dances
and weddings in this letter, I might be persuaded to tell
you that our Clara Kleinschmidt has been singing at her
first “At Home” in London, and that all the guests said
it was perfectly charming.
The Rowing Club ball on Friday night took the palm ;
in fact, it captured many palms. Adelaide is never likely
to see a prettier array of girls and frocks, and the hosts
provided a fine decorative background for them. There
were oars crossed all round the walls, and miles of muslin
festoons in the club colors, and acres of poppies and fern.
You went through a flag-decked passage to a cool-
drinkery, and if you were very hungry, you only
had to break through a partition and steal some
of the supper on the other side. It was sim-
plicity itself. All the Excellencies were there, the
girls in white frocks. Mrs. Albion Tolley had a dream
of a raiment —white satin with panels of lace and
sparkles. Pretty Alice Campbell, in cloudy white with a
pale blue sash ; Dorothy Deeley, in green taffetas ; and
Hazel Fotheringham, in heliotrope and silver, were among
several hundred bright young whirling circumstances,
for whose fair sakes I should have renounced all the rest
of the universe, if I had been a Merely Man.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

PURIFYING THE BLOOD.
What ails you ? Do you know ? Does your
doctor know? You complain of languor, tired-
ness, headaches. Your complexion is sallow,
your skin pimply, your heart action is sluggish,
your brain confused, your mind sleeping.
Perhaps your blood needs purifying. Perhaps
you have eaten to excess and your organs have
failed to throw off the poisons of fermentation.
Don’t despair ! The remedy is at hand ! A dose
of FRANZ JOSEF Natural Aperient Water
taken before breakfast will begin the cleaning
process. Another, to-morrow, will continue the
good work. It is mild, prompt, effective. You
will quickly feel a new energy throb through your
veins, sending a new life-giving vigor to every
fibre of your brain and body.*

*
The Ccmmon Sense Treat-
ment of Indigestion*
$
This Woman Who Had a Bad
Attack, Tells how She
was Cured.
The experience of sufferers from stomach
trouble, who have tried the tonic treatment with
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, has been that their
trouble has disappeared as soon as the blood
supply was increased. The numerous disorders of
the stomach, acid stomach, nervous dyspepsia,
gastritis, and lack of tone, have the same under-
lying cause —weak, watery blood. In each ease
the stomach is weak. Dr. William'.’ Pink Pills
supply the stomach with the strength it needs by;
enriching and purifying the blood. Pure blood
gives tone to the nerves, muscles, and glands of
the stomach, and makes it capable of properly
performing the work of digestion.
A recent cure of a severe case of stomach
trouble is that of Mrs. George Hathaway, Mount
Hardy, near York, W. A.
“Indigestion attacked me some time ago, and
I began to suffer more and more from it. As sure
as I ate anything I’d get a dreadful pain in the
stomach. My food seemed to lodge in my chest,
and would not digest; sometimes I could not
keep it down at all. I could hardly draw my
breath, and felt as if I would suffocate. At
times I’d have flushes up each side of my face.
People remarked how sallow and yellow my skin
was. I suffered a .ot with bilious headaches.
Mv sight was bad, and there were always blurred
objects before my eyes. As a rule, I slept badly.
Many a day I’d have to leave my housework and
go and lie down. I was irritable and out of sorts
and very melancholy. I had medicine from the
doctor, but it d IVI not cure me. Then about
twelve months ago I tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
Mrs. Sims recommended them to me, for they had
cured her daughter Jessie. The first box started
to do me good, and two boxes drove away all the
pains of indigestion. My food began to digest
and my appetite picked up. The headaches
yielded, and I was able to sleep well, and got up
morning without that horrible drowsy
feeling. I didn’t need to take more than the two
boxes, and now my health is very good.”
It is well to remember that it was Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and not an imitation, that cured Mrs.
Hathaway. Getting the genuine is the important
thing in a cure. They are sold by most chemists
and storekeepers, or will be sent direct by The

POLITICAL
POINTS
Senator Pulsford is gifted with an exqui-
site moderation in defence matters. Raking over
the bones of an expired farce the other day, he re-
marked that he was not only in favor of giving
one Deadhorse to the Other Country, but would
give five of the animals if he could. It is wonder-
ful how glibly Pulsford will talk of presenting
Britain with a trivial £10,000.000. Yet, if he
were asked to present Australia with a trivial
£10,000,000 for a quintet of Dreadmarines, he
would probably get up and shout “ Disgraceful!”
“How dare you!” etc., etc., in quite a bitter
tone of voice.
The outlook of the Peake Ministry in S.
Australia gets no brighter. The Labor party has
practically announced its intention of seeking to
slay it the first time it gets a chance, which will
be when the Parliament meets on July 22.
Butler, hitherto the leader of the Opposition, says
plainly that he too will have nothing to do with
the Ministry unless there is something for him in
the business. Without counting the new member
for the Torrens seat, the Labor party has 19
followers, and Butler has 13. Peake, with his
colleagues reckoned in, can only muster nine.
If Peake throws over three of his colleagues, and
gives the Butler party a show at the Cabinet
feast, matters may be arranged ; but as there is
only an almost invisible margin even if Peake and
Butler combine against Labor, it will be rather
dangerous to adopt Draconian measures. The
whole position is extremely complicated, and if
Peake were a practical joker, he could not have
evolved a more humorous political tangle.
APROPOS THE LAND QUESTION:
As it was in the beginning , so it is now.
SKIPPER NOAH : “ Ven all the animals are ashore ,
mine son, we will broceed to divide the earth.”
In the straggle for supremacy at sea, it is
worth noting that Britain, with a small army and
a little over 40,000,000 people, spends about
£63,000,000 a year on land and sea defence, while
Germany, with a very large army and over
60,000,000 people, only spends close on £57,000,000.
Therefore Germany can spend another £6,000,000
a year before its people as a whole are paying as
much as Britain—in other words, before the indi-
vidual German has to pay 13s. 4d. against the
individual Briton’s £l. But if the German paid
as much par head as the Briton does, Germany
would spend over £90,000,000 a year on land and
sea defence against the Bull person’s £63,000,000.
This leaves a huge margin yet for the expansion
of Hans Sourkrout.
Politics are cut rather fine in Australia
just now. In Tasmania the Lewis Government
reckons on a majority of six. and it is in a stronger
position than most. The Fused Federal Govern-
ment isn’t much, if any, better off. The Phidston
Ministry in Queensland had a majority of two the
other day on a critical division. The Peake
Ministry (S. A.) has no majority at all, and doesn’t
know where to find one.
A case before Justice Pring last week
suddenly collapsed in a manner that suggests that
trafficking in Crown lands is still dangerously
easy in N.S.W. _ A woman sued a man for £2BO
in respect of a ringbarking contract. In her evi-
dence she candidly admitted that defendant was
a dummy on a 900-acre farm adjoining her pro-
perty. The real owner of the land was her son,
and his father had stocked the land. Defendant,
the reputed owner, had no interest in the stock or
in the land. The amazed Judge asked the plain-
tiff if she was aware that she was admitting a
criminal act, and the lady said she hadn’t the
faintest idea of it. Hethen gazed at plaintiff's coun-
sel, and that staggered person said inwardly that he
was blowed, and skied his brief. So it appears
that not only does dummying still exist in
N.S.W., but there are still people who don’t
know that there can be any serious objection
to the practice.
Cann, of the N.S.W. Assembly, has an
awkward motion down on the business paper—
that, in the opinion of the House, the people
should be asked by referendum to say whether
they want to retain (1) the Legislative Council,
(2) the State Governer, (3) the State Agent-
General. It will be interesting to watch Wade.
If he votes against the motion it will mean that
Wade doesn’t trust the people—in short, that
Wade proposes to govern them and not allow
them to govern themselves, which will be a pretty
stiff proposition for the leader of a great “ Liberal
and Reform ” party. On the other hand, if Wade
votes “Yes,” then he knows he will be in danger
of crushing most of the State insect in one act; at
any rate, he will have to risk being told that the
people want the State insect crushed. So the
chances are that Wade, the strong man, will
dodge the trouble by taking all sorts of care that
Cann’s motion is never reached.
Wade and Waddell made Chelmsford say,
when the N.S.W. Parliament opened, that they
proposed to go a more furious pace in (1) the
matter of immigration, and (2) establishing agri-
cultural schools, farms, experimental plots, etc.
N. S. Wales has about eight agricultural colleges
and school-farms already; and a recent count
showed that not more than about one-third of the
youths trained at these places stay on the land.
Probably some of them don’t like the hard,
grubby work when they get to close quarters
with it; but a heap more of them don’t stay on
the land because there is no land available for
them to stay on. There is land, but the owners
are hanging on till Wade borrows some more
money to buy them out at a tremendous price ;
and Wade won’t think of a graduated land-tax to
make the big estates available without the State
needing to go into power to purchase them.
When only one-third of those trained at the exist-
mg agricultural schools go on the land, even Wade
might be expected to see that there is something
rotten somewhere ; and that rottenness won’t be
got oyer by establishing more schools, or even by
boosting immigration.
That disorderly old female at the street
corner, the Tory press, is protesting altogether
toc> much that she is a perfect lady, and that there
isn t a blotch on her character. In a voice thick
with political gin she declares daily that her
Fusion is an honest re-union of two parties which
were never divided by any serious difference of
principle, and that it fully represents the will of
the majority. And the Fused people try to keep
up the pretence—that is to say, Mauger and
Hume Cook, Democrats and White Australians,
declare that their constituents’ views
and those of the constituents of Smith
and Kelly, Tories and advocates of
nigger labor, are identical ; and Jabez
Coon says that the High Protection
of his electors is adequately repre-
sented by Johnson’s raving Freetrade ;
and Ewing, with a slight difficulty
in swallowing as he makes the
statement, asseverates that his union
with Iceberg Irvine represents the
views of both electorates—in fact, the
two men are so much alike that
Ewing’s electorate would just as soon
be represented by Irvine and Irvine’s
by Ewing as any other way. So the
disorderly old Fused female protests
her complete respectability, and, if
anyone looks doubtful on the sub-
ject, she is prepared to fight that
individual according to Marquis of
Dogberry rules.
The Registrar-General comes out with
more figures to show the distressing effect of
Federation and Protection upon N. S. Wales. In
1899-1900-1901, the three last years before the new
order began to push Ma along, 268 limited liability
cos. were registered ; in the last three years 574,
or more than twice as many, were formed. And,
besides that, the then existing cos. only found it
necessary to apply for the registration of £457,825
of new capital in the three years before Federa-
tion and Protection started to do things for
N. S. Wales; whereas trade and industry have
been so vigorous during the last three years that
the increases of capital have totalled £3!270,795.
“Jean Sibi ” : Amid all the fraud and
rottenness and decay of the Victorian Lands
administration, the affairs of the Vic. Agricultural
College Council make only an item—still they do
make an item. The College has an endowment of
150,000 acres of really excellent land. It could let
this to small farmers for agricultural purposes and
get a big rent. It prefers, and has preferred for
25 years or so, to let it in large areas at a very
small rent, so that rich men may graze live meat
on it.. And why it thus sets itself (1) to prevent
the increase of population, and (2) to throw away
a vast amount of money, the Vic. Ag. Coll. Council
doesn’t explain, and the Government of Premier
Weary doesn’t inquire.
THE NEW ANTI-SOSH LEADER.
Mr. Deakin, in replying to Mr. Fisher, pointed to his
programme before Parliament. There it stands. Any-
one can read it.—The Aon, enthusiastically.
Recently, Sydney’s Syrian merchants gave
a farewell shivoo to W. Abourizk, who was going
abroad, and Mr. Abourizk seized the chance to
deposit a really remarkable Old Fish on the
table: —
He hoped that a great petition, pointing out the griev’
ances under which the Syrians labored, would be pre-
pared and presented, not to the Prime Minister, but to
the Commonwealth Parliament. There were good
reasons to be advanced. If a Syrian went to Court here,
he or she only got half the witnesses’ expenses given to
others ; yet 90 per cent, of his countrymen were mer-
chants of good standing, paying wages higher in propor-
tion than were paid by merchants in York-street. He
hoped this silly law, with the help of Mr. MoGowen and
Mr. Wade, would be amended.
Now, can Mr. W. Abouiizk, or any of his fellow
Syrian merchants, mention any law. Common-
wealth or State, which provides that Syrians shall
be paid “ only half the witnesses’expenses given
to others ” ? If he could, why didn’t Mr. Abou-
rizk specify the mysterious bit of legislation which,
according to his yarn, is such a fixture and im-
movable object that it will take the combined
efforts of the Federal Parliament and McGowen
and Wade to shift it?
“ M.M.” presents a belated report:—
The strongest note struck at the recent Chow
banquet given in Sydney to the new Consul was
the sturdy spirit of State rights that pervaded the
assemblage. The speakers who told of the marvellous
prospects of “New China” were given the sort of
applause that a Tivoli audience hands Out to the song-
and-dance lady who isn’t desired to take an encore ; but
t he moment one chrome orator touched on the fact that the
Consul was to be located in Melbourne, everybody pre-
sent assumed his fighting face. I couldn’t catch exactly
what was being said, having acquired my Cantonese with
a Parisian accent, but I gathered that’the speaker was
denouncing Federation, talking about postal mismanage-
ment, and holding up Victorianising influences as the
root of all evil. At any rate, my , right-hand neighbor
hammered hard with his chop-sticks, and remarked fer-
vently at intervals, “ Gobblesser Misser Wade ! Hip-hip-
hoolay for him Joey Calluthers.” There was no mis-
taking the spirit of the gathering. It was a splendid
tribute to our great defenders of State rights, and was
one up against the Labor party.
The late Governor Norman’s published
reminiscences casts reflections on the tricky
politics of Queensland’s prancing patriots of a few
years ago. The Northern Separation movement,
he says, was a big
question early in
his career. The
principal agitators
owned land in and
around the pro-
posed capital of the
new State that was
to be, and reckoned
that, when the place
was a seat of Go-
vernment, things
would hum like a
capsized beehive.
And it might all
have come to pass
.only for a little
incident. Ogden, a
Laborite, beat Will-
mott, a Govern-
ment supporter.
He made the eighth
Labor member in
the North, and
word went round
that if separation
were obtained the
northern division
would be governed
by a Labor Parlia-
ment, and the
patriots might find
a progressive land-
tax instead of the
unearned inc r e-
rnent they were
looking for. The
fearsome tidings
caused a sudden
backslide, and the
loudest separators
left the movement
with such velocity
THE NEW SPIRITUAL
SIGN-POST.
Mr. Alexander is gratified,
and he made especial reference
to his satisfaction at what
Mr. G. H. Reid had said about
the mission. “It will mean,”
he said, “that Dr. Chapman’s
message will get into places
which it would not have
reached if Mr. Reid had not
spoken.”
that Norman couldn’t see them for dust.
“ Jean Sibi ” writes :
There is a scrap of irony in the Federal Labor party’s
jeer at the Black Labor leanings of Honorary Minister
Foxton, seeing that several of the jeerers betray the same
over-colored sympathies by their fiscal faith. As pro-
fessed Freetraders, they avow a belief in the cheap
foreign nigger as an industrial competitor. Foxton
wants to have his nigger competing here, while Labor-
member Hughes, for instance, prefers to have him com-
peting afar off. But they both want nigger competition.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The moral of the Third Test is that cricket is a
fool of a game to bet on. Australia went in first, and
had a fearful time, no less than six of the team being
outed for single figures. Gregory made top score, with
46, and Ransford, Bardsle.v, Armstrong and Trumper
made 45, 30, 21 and 27 not out respectively. The whole
side vanished for 188 —which was a miserable score for an
Australian XI. But if the Australians eould not bat
Macartney could bowl, and he laid out seven English
wickets for 58 (six of them for 30), and the Englishmen
left only 182 behind them ; so Australia started the
second innings with six in hand. The second attempt
did not inspire much hope, and when the news
came that the Australians were all out for 207, the match
was considered a lost battle. But again the Jeremiahs
reckoned without the Australian bowlers. With 214 re-
quired to win, England commenced the second innings in
lovelv weather on a good wicket; hut Cotter and Macart-
ney went baresark, Cotter taking five wickets for 38, and
Macartney four for 27. It was terrific. England was
smashed, the top score being Hobbs’ 30. Sharp and
Rhodes made 11 and 16 respectively. All the rest made
single figures or none at all. The side vanished for 87,
leaving Australia victorious by 126 runs.
Australia has now won two of the five tests,
and, although it plays the counties with difficulty, seems
to be able to more than hold its own against All England.
The result is a heavy knock in the countenance for the
crowd that yelped about the Australian XI. being weak
in the bowling division. So far all the success has been
due to the bowling. To dismiss All England on a good
wicket for 182 and 87 is a feat that ought to satisfy the
most grudging Jeremiah. Macartney, who wrecked
England, is the smallest man in the team, and in this
respect resembles Napoleon, who was generally the
smallest man in his armies.
* * * *
A cricket crank, who keeps tally of these weird
facts, writes that in the three tests Australia has used 13
batsmen, while England has opposed with 19 ; and in the
bowling Australia has used seven, while England’s battery
numbered ten. This slab of knowledge may be interest-
ing to some.

The first day of the Grand National meeting at
Flemington was like old times, or even more so. The
heavenly water tap had been turned off in the morning,
and the novelty of a bright day attracted the Melbourne
crowd in thousands. Certainly it was not the G. N.
Hurdle Race that accounted for the strength of the
attendance. With Ataahua among the scratched, the
field had no special feature of interest. The bookmakers
expressed their opinion of the twenty-two candidates by
offering S’s and 9’s to 1 on the field a couple of hours
before the gong sounded, and the betting at the start
was 6 to 1 against the first favorite, The Sun—with 12
to 1 against Vernier, and from 14 to 20 to 1 against ten of
the others. The race, after all, proved much faster than
was expected, with the result that the light-weights had
all the best of it, and Fossil on the bottom mark, beat the
lot. This was the eighth time in ten years that the
winner of the big Hurdle Race has carried less than 10st.,
the weights of the four placed horses being
st. lb.
(1) Fossil .. .. 9 0
(2) Kalnuck .. 10 7
(3) Old Nick .. 9 5
(4) Wooloomooloo 9 7
which, considering that eleven of the unplaced lot had to
carry more than iOst., casts a pretty severe reflection on
the present handicapping system.
A victory for the Tasmanian nag, Kalnuck,
would have been popular. Last year he was the runner-
up (carrying 9st. 41b.) in the Doutta Galla Hurdle Race
on the second Saturday of the meeting, and his perform-
ances on the flat and over the sticks had been consistent.
But the burden stopped Kalnuck from overhauling Fossil.
The bottom weight from Ballarat was in the front lot
before half a mile was covered. Soon afterwards he took
the lead and kept it to the finish. It might almost be
said that Fossil led all the way. Hence the groans of the
crowd on the Flat when trainer Scobie’s “ surprise,"
ridden by George Scobie, his son, returned to scale. Here
was an extraordinary “ reversal of form,” which, although
reasonable explanations may be made for it, sdemed
utterly unaccountable to readers of mere newspaper
reports.
Scobie had openly confessed his faith in Fossil
before he brought the common-looking customer from
Ballarat to Melbourne to get “ sharpened up ” by a couple
of gallops at Moonee Valley. The dark horse, on the
strength of his private reputation, was made favorite for
a hurdle race on Saturday (June 26), but he ran badly.
He was never “in it.” Subsequently the Australasian
offered this excuse for Fossil’s poor performance:
“ George Scobie was weak from wasting and was in a 31b.
saddle. Just after the start a leather went, and anyone
who looked at the race could see that Scobie could not
drive the horse along in a way a slow plodder should be
driven. I have no desire to suggest that Fossil has a
chance for the big race, but'this was his first time over
hurdles (in public), and he did better at the Hunt Club
meeting on the following Wednesday.” But hoiv did
Fossil do better at the Hunt Club meeting? He was
backed down to 7 to 4 for a petty hurdle race, and the
Age report was that he “ struck a hurdle heavily
after going a little over five furlongs, and dislodged
his rider.” Subsequently'the Australasian writer, who
had referred to Fossil as “ a slow plodder ” the first time
he failed, said of this second failure : “ He was going very
nicely when he slipped up two or three lengths after
jumping a hurdle, and lost G. Scobie.” According to one
account, the horse struck a hurdle so heavily that his
rider was thrown ; whereas the other account gives it
that the animal slipped on the flat, whilst the jockey
slipped from the saddle. The crowd at Flemington last
Saturday was judging Fossil on the bad performances
they had witnessed or been told of. What they knew for
certain was that the horse ran like a very “ slow plodder ”
on June 26, lost his jockey somehow on June 30, and won
the G. N. Hurdle Race practically “all the way” on
July 3. His two bad performances had caused him to go
out at 20 to 1 for the National, despite the fact that the
stable and its friends took the long odds pretty freely.
On paper, the Ballarat “surprise” hadn’t a 1000 to 1
chance of winning a big race in such decisive fashion.
Therefore the mob hooted.
Next Saturday’s Steeplechase promises to he a
capital race, with a note of interrogation attaching to the
first favorite. All the top weights—Bribeiy, Kuala
Lumpur, Pilot, Kiatere, Boisdale, Workmaster, Boome-
rang, and Up-to-date—are likely starters at time of
writing. Among the 9-stoners Alcuin, Lycaon, and Fred
have pretensions. Squirm (9st. 121 b.) has made some very
respectable show's of late, and on the lOst. mark stands
Grafnax, from N.S.W., with the note of interroga-
tion to his name. If he were a tried and trusty
jumper, Grafnax might be expected to make hacks of
his opponents. He won the Maiden Steeple last Satur-
day in the easiest way. The others were outclassed by
the good-looking son of Grafton and Xantippe. But
although he raced away from them as he pleased on the
flat, Grafnax “hung” like a raw novice at some of his
jumps. In the G. N. Steeple he will have to take many
more jumps at a considerably faster pace than on Satur-
day, and the chances are that if he gets bustled he will
come to grief. All the same, there is no horse among the
acceptors that could be confidently backed to beat
Grafnax—one to win.

On Saturday last the Sydney Rugby Union
suspended its .competition to make way for the N.S. W.-
Queensland match. The result, in the opinion of many
of the spectators, hardly justified the suspension. The
Queensland crowd was a g-ood general team ; especially
the forwards. But the back machine was very groggy,
and it bumped a Wallaby team which knew all the details
of its own game, with the result that the score was 37 to
nil. Of course, this sort of runaway victory is quite un-
interesting, and calls for neither description or comment.
The figures tell the yarn and supply all the comment
necessary. N.S.W. is stronger at Rugby this season than
ever before ; and Queensland is just about the same as it
has been for the last six or seven years. Lack of combi-
nation, insufficient practice together, and a few other
things explain the downfall of the Bananalanders.
» * » *
The Rugby League also had an inter-State fixture
in the sh-ipe of the “final test,” at which about 7000
people rolled up. The outward and visible insisrnia of
success is the Black and White Cup, and it goes to the
Ma State. Like Queensland, Maoriland had never a hope ;
the game was a deb&cle, and Maoriland fell in the dirt to
the tune of 25 points to five. The Maorilanders streamed
away from the field of disaster to the boat, and, with the
mud of the match hardening into a crust upon them,
started for Auckland, home and beauty.
As a preliminary, the League ran a novel tussle
in the shape of a Combined First and Second Grades
match. Naturally the Combined First won, but the
juniors put up a great battle ; and it was a far more
interesting go than that between the inter-State teams.
The First won by 11 to three, which was anything but
discreditable to the Seconds.
* * * *
The amazing feature about Sydney Soccer com-
petition is that, so far, Pyrmont has not been beaten.
Only once has it failed to down the other crowd, and then
it was a drawn game. The only clubs to get near it are
Rozelle and Sydney, and they have each been walloped
twice, while the unfortunate Western Suburbs have only
escaped being walloped twice, and one of those occasions
was a drawn game. So Pyrmont is right at the top of the
heap, on the diamond ridge of pre-eminence, with 19
points. Rozelle and Sydney toil behind with 15 each,
Glebe 14, Powerful and Balmain 12 each, and Ultimo and
Granville 10. After that there is only a row of tomb-
stones.
**• . *
On Saturday Pyrmont routed the Powerful
crowd by five goals to one. The bluejackets put up a
great defence, but Pyrmont’s shooting was deadly.
Garden Island, having got over its grievance, came back
and got beaten by Granville, the score being two to nil.
Glebe smothered North Sydney by five to one in a game
which, in spite of slippery ground, was fast, and fine to
watch. Newtown downed Balmain by four to nil, and
Sydney dished Ultimo by two to nil.

The Westralian Soccer team which recently
roamed eastward has panned out a deficit of £36 18s.
4d. ; the expenses having totalled £297 Bs. 2d., and the
income £260 9s. lOd. Which is a nice way for Australia
to treat the men who play England’s national game in
this time of ultra-aggressive loyalty.
* * * *
Melbourne had hardly finished talking over the
great game of Saturday week before the ructions in the
St. Kilda club focussed themselves on its sporting mind.
At the League meeting on Wednesday night the ball was
started by the star player of that team, who notified the
delegates that he had been “requested by the secretary
to hand in his boots and uniform,” and asked a permit to
join Essendon (Association). This was cheerfully
granted, but the funny part of the occurrence was that
while one of Saints’ two delegates said the ’bailer’s
dismissal was owing to a want of adaptability and a lack
of brotherly love among certain players, several more of
whom had been retired simultaneously, the other delegate
asserted that that was the first he had heard of the
matter, and that he was amazed, not to say flabbergasted.
Other Saintly ’bailers applied for transfers to Association
clubs, and will probably get them when the customary
formalities have been complied with. The case of St. Kilda
is prophetic of the disaster that must supervene if the pur-
chasing of players continues. Last season it was third on
the list; this year, with the stronger men still in the
team, it has gained but one victory—over ’Varsity. A
while back two prominent committeemen resigned, their
successors being assured by the others that a new policy
of encouraging local juniors was to be followed. The old
policy of acquiring new talent from any and everywhere
was still followed, and the team still kept on losing. Now
half a dozen men are fired out, and the same committee-
men are scouring the country for more —one of last
week’s new men being a suspended Bendigo ’bailer whose
disqualification the local Association kindly removed
so that he might play with the Saints, although
he had already arranged to play ith Essen-
don when his term of suspension was over. Pos-
sibly St. Kilda may do better in the future—it can’t
do much worse—but this writer adheres to the advice
given the club last week to get a new committee that
will capture and develop the local juniors. They won’t
win the pennant this season, but they will speedily train
into a workmanlike, organised body; they will belong
to St. Kilda, and the club will love and take a pride in
them. Also, they shouldn’t need so large an outlay for
“expenses” as the Bendigo or Ballarat star, who never
becomes a real Saint, and who causes more jealousy
among his mates than he is worth. As to the
discarded ’bailers, most of them have already
been acquired by Ass. clubs, though no one
imagines such captures to be anymore than temporary.
The secret history of one is typical, and would be in-
teresting if published with the wealth of detail that he
alone could give. He is a fine “mark” and a mighty
place-kick, and even before the secretary’s bomb-shell
struck him he had been “approached ” by Footscra.v. He
declined, and the shell had no sooner burst than Essen-
don (Ass.) snapped him. Now Carlton and another
League team are dangling fat worms on hooks before him
with intent to acquire his services next season.
After the tremendous game of the week before,
Melbourne’s League football last Saturday was tame and
slipshod. The only encounter which promised a fine
finish was that between Carlton and ’Varsity, on the East
Melbourne mudhole. This turned out a sprightly episode,
the students holding a bit more than their own for the
first three-quarters, when the board showed 49 points to
Carlton’s 43. But in thelastquarter the eclipse occurred ;
the Old Blues put on 26 more points While Uni. vainly
strove to avert disaster. Scores : 69 to 49. Certainly,
’Varsity had to replace four damaged players with two
medium ’bailers and two passengers, but the debacle
was mainly due to lack of training and a want of
that persistent determination that keeps bogging
in right up to the bell-ring 1 . If Uni. isn’t careful
it will get the name of a brilliant but unstable team.
The other four collisions were all catastrophes. South
did as it pleased with Geelong (by 111 points to 31);
’Wood wiped its feet on ’Roy (52 wipes to 21); while
Essendon, though not the “same old ” as of yore, totted
up 72 points to Saints’ 42. The argument between Rich-
mond and Melbourne was anticipated with some emotion,
opinions being divided as to whether the heavyweight
conquerors of South would stamp on the lighter but
faster Red Legs, or vice versa. Alas ! Richmond seems to
have got into the same box as St. Kilda, and to be any-
thing- but an affectionate family. As Bruce Smith would
put it, an injurious differentiation in the matter of ex-
penses causes a lack of cohesion, and an exclusiveness of
play that invites disaster—and the disaster arrived in the
shape of 82 points to Richmond’s 15, though these points
don’t include several that a prize ring referee would have
counted.
Most of the Ass. games, being less one-sided,
gave more joy to the spectators. The collision of the
regenerated ’Scray and Brunswick was like the Deakin-
Cook fusion, in that no man could say how it would end.
Either party seemed liable to boil over at any moment,
in a manner of speaking. ’Scray ultimately took the
laurels by 59 points to 46. The upheaval of Williamstown
nearly overwhelmed F’ran, but the volcano got to work too
late to be effective. At three-quarter time the board
showed, P’ran 40 points ; ’Town 7 ; and the shopkeeping
suburb’s barrackers were jubilant; but as the seasiders
steadily piled up the points they began to quake and to
pray for darkness and the bell, and to thank their joss
there wasn’t another quarter to follow'. P’ran 46, ’Tow'n
34 was the record ; and, considering all things, ’Town
needn’t be ashamed of it. The collision of Ports and
Northcote hardly counted in the scheme of things, but it
provided great joy to the supporters, inasmuch as only a
point separated the teams at the close, the said point
belonging to ’Cote- 32 to 31. Brighton trod on North —
47 to 23—and Essendon demolished Preston—9l to 36.
Among other happenings that were given needless
publicity was the capsizing of Coburg, of the Junior Ass.,
which almost equalled its last week’s feat by scoring 0 to
Port Juniors’ 95. Not even a Tory government could
equal Coburg’s vast capacity for doing nothing.

The first of the Commonwealth motor postal
vans is now running round Melbourne, where the taxi-
meter is also pursuing its adventurous way. It is said
that Sydney’s taximeters are also ready to start, but
cannot do so because the City Council will not issue
permits, rules, and regulations. In fact, it is said that
some of the councillors hold a brief for the cab pro-
prietors, and by present appearances it is likely to take
some weighty arguments to overcome the opposition to
the horseless cab. The two motor postal vans that are
in use have Australian-built bodies on 16-h.p. English-
built “ Albion ” chassis ; and are capable of carrying
15cwt., which is, roughly, 20 full bags of mails. All the
same, 15cwt. seems a very light load for 16-h.p.

Evidently the Warrnambool to Melbourne bike
race this year is going to be a gigantic affair, for, although
the nominations do not close till September, already over
400 nominations and a hundred acceptances (before the
handicaps are declared) have come to hand. As the entry
is to be limited to 500, it is a case of get in early and avoid
the crush. Meanwhile, the air is thick with the noise of
preparation. The Beverley to Perth spin of 116 miles,
which is to decide who shall represent Westralia in the
Warrnambool-Melbourne event, is fixed for September 4 ;
the Goulburn-Sydney smuggle should eventuate about
September 18 ; and the Tasmanian test race will come off
about the same date.

Dunlop tyres have been immensely successful
during the past year. The Bordeaux-Paris, Paris-Roubaix,
and the 100-kilometers (62 miles) Road Championship of
France have all been won on Dunlop tyres. In Australia
the nine leading road races of last winter were also car-
ried off by the tyre that was first in 1888. Of the 19
Bordeaux-Paris events decided 15 have been won on the
same make of tyres—an amazing record.*

Of late years King Ned, who used to be very-
partial to the bike, had gone in for motoring ; but his
physician has now advised him to take to the wheel again
for exercise ; and Ned accordingly whizzes quietly round
Buckingham Palace Grounds on a Dunlop-shod tricycle.*
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen has decided to
keep the Bathurst to Sydney road race alive in spite of
the withdrawal of financial support by the Continental
Tyre Co. So the “ trade ” has been levied upon, and at
time of writing is understood to have shelled out on
a scale of liberality that will enable this excellent event
to be duly held. The date decided on is Saturday, Sep-
tember 4, two weeks before the Goulburn-Sydney race ;
and the distance is 133 miles.

The Motor Cycle Club of N.S.W. has asked the
Victoria Motor Cycle, Club to co-operate with it in Arrang-
ing a relay ride between Melbourne and Sydney in about
two months’ time. The idea is a good one. The last
occasion when motor-bikes figured in this sort of amuse-
ment was in the Dunlop reliability motor contest of 1905,
when Harry James swarmed home first on the hike in 27
hours of actual riding, split up into five sections. An
out-and-out race between the two capitals would be too
severe an ordeal —those motor-hikes do bump a
fellow about. Harry James, who has been there
more times than writer can remember, advocat es
that the course be divided into three sections—Mel-
bourne to Albury (201 m.), AlburytoYass (186 m.), and
Ya s to Sydney (188 m.). Unless this is done, it is a cer-
tainty that only a small fragment of each rider will see
the journey out, and young, fond wives will certainly not
allow their husbands to nominate for the event. With
properly arranged relays it should be possible to get the
despatch through from Melbourne to Sydney in one day.
But the event should be postponed till November or De-
cember, when the apologies for roads between the two
cities will be at their best.
A committee of the Melbourne City Council has
declared that a fixed motor speed limit is unnecessary for
the control of the motor traffic in the city ; and that the
“driving to the common danger ” clause of the ordinary
Act is quite good enough. Perhaps! But the best
: remedy of all would be the adoption of the German law.
Under that sensible statute a motor accident is priina
facie evidence and proof of carelessness on the part of the
driver, and he has to clear himself. If he fails, he
may be fined or imprisoned; and he is compelled
by the Act to maintain the widow of the man run
over till she either dies of old age or marries again ;
also he is compelled to maintain, rear, and educate in
that sphere of life to which they have been accustomed,
any children of the victim. If the victim is only injured,
the motorist has to maintain the whole family and pay
all medical accounts and a lump sum in compensation for
pain and anxiety. Seems harsh, no doubt, but it is
effective. The law has only been used three times in all
Germany.

A Californian baseball team, calling itself the
Columbia Park boys, attacked and defeated Paddington,
the premier club of Sydney, on Saturday at Sydney
Cricket Ground. The figures were two to nil, so appa-
rently our local baseballer is not to be sneezed at with
complete impunity.
Tahmmy Burns is threatening to break into the
baseball and lacrosse g rues in Sydney. If he does, there
will be some interesting cases before the discredited
Amateur Sports Federation.

The complete failure of Fred Weiss to give
young Lindrum 2000 start in an exhibition game of 16,000
points, at Sydney, lifts the young Australian another
notch up the billiard cue. The game, too, put a lot of
1 heart into the junior player—a deficiency which Was all
along alleged to be his worst obstacle. During the 12
days of the match, Lindrum averaged 34-91 points per cue,
while Weiss’average stood at 29-62. In the first week, Lin-
-1 drum scored 7000 to Weiss’ 5152 ; while the second week’s
figures showed that Lindrum scored 7000 to Weiss’ 6759.
Lindrum also put together 42 breaks of 100 and over,
while Weiss could only average 25 breaks of the same
dimensions. The match ended with a spanking run of
236 (unfinished) by Lindrum, at which time Weiss had
scored 11,911—the boy therefore defeating the man by a
clear 2039 points irrespective of the 2000 points conceded
as a handicap.
* * * *
Said that another of the Lindrum family has
appeared above the billiard horizon in the shape of a
10-year-old limb, who finds little difficulty in compiling
breaks of 50. People who allege that they can spot the
material of which champions are made are prophesying
a big future for the youngster. It seems a pity. At least
one of the boys should be taught to do some useful work.
Poor old Peter Felix waddled into the limelight
for a brief moment at Melbourne Athletic Pavilion on
Monday night last. There Mike Williams rushed at him.
Felix poked a dilapidated left into Mike’s dial. Mike
ignored it, and bashed hard and often. In exactly 2min.
40sec. from the sound of the gong Felix was down and
out. As he left the ring to resume his position among
the has-beens, he was fiercely hooted, which was quite
unnecessary, and cruel to boot; also silly and boorish
and ungentlemanly, and the conduct of hogs.

Poor Joe Grimm, described by himself as
“a Dago and a gentleman,” was last week placed in a
hospital for the insane by the Westralian authorities.
Joseph’s stock-in-trade was the alleged fact that, he
couldn’t be knocked out; and as he was as game as they
make ’em, he took some tremendous assault and battery
to demonstrate his possession of the iron jaw. Said that on
one occasion Burns knocked him down 19 times in three
rounds ; and then owned up to a helpless feeling when
Grimm came up laughing and poked his chin at him.
“ Hanged if I knew what to do with him,” said Tahmmy.

N.S.W. amateur boxing and wrestling champion-
ships provided heaps of fun in Sydney recently, the bulk
of the joy coming from the fearful, grampus-like flounder-
ing's of the heavyweights. On Saturday last the efforts of
a 17st. 71b. aspirant to avoid the attentions of a 12st.
enemy were worth going far to see. As Lean could not
reach over Fat’s lower chest to inflict any real damage he
got the verdict on points.
In a moment of exhilaration Johnson deposited
$5OOO forfeit and invited Jeffries or, incidentally, anybody
else to come along and tread on the tail of his money.
Jeffries took no notice, but Delaney, on behalf of A 1
Kauffman, danced a fandango on the coin, and covered
the negro’s forfeit with the intimation that he was pre-
pared to increase the sum to ten, fifteen, or twenty
thousand if Johnson was anxious. Kauffman will fight
Johnson in the club that offers the largest purse. John-
son is now fairly cornered, and must either fight
Kauffman or retire into the background. Exactly
why anybody should suppose that Johnson is afraid of
Kauffman is not clear ; but over in Yankeeland there is
apparently an idea that Johnson is not looking for fights,
but music-hall engagements. The Yankee pressmen
indicate what they think of his desire for battle, bash and
sudden insensibility by nicknaming him “The Big
Smoke.” However, much as Johnson may be anxious to
avoid fighting, there is but little danger of him losing his
title to Kauffman, who is proving somewhat of a disap-
pointment. The fact that Jeffries allowed Johnson’s for-
feit to go uncovered has convinced the fight fans that the
ex-champion is just as determined as ever to shed no
nose blood.
The result of this failure was that Jeffries’
power of attraction as a music-hall star slumped badly,
and his manager was immediately set to making excuse. o .
He brought along a fresh batch daily ; and, according to
the press, the public turned them all down. How the
pressmen knew is not stated. The final reason given
was that Jeffries’contract prevented him making an en-
gagement till after July 24, and the contract was produced
to prove it. Jeffries announced orally that he would fight
Mister Johnson, but said nothing about when, where or
how ; and, according to the press, the public again turned
him down enthusiastically. Writer’s own opinion of the
matter is that “ The Public ” doesn’t care a hang whether
Jeffries fights Johnson or anybody else. It is merely
amused at the frantic endeavors of these wasters ,to
keep themselves in the limelight and get cheap advertise-
ment.

Detailed accounts of the Hague-Langford fight
show that, although the negro won quickly, he was more
than once badly hit. 'the trouble seems to have been
that Hague—who was out of condition and almost un-
trained, owing to an attack of swelled head —did not hit
often enough in the first two rounds. There was no com-
parison between the strength of the two men,;and,
properly’ trained, Hague should eat up the dark -man.
This swelled-head disease is a baffling thing.
“10-2-4 ” : Johnson is now also matched to fight
Stanley Ketchell, America’s middleweight champion, at
Oolma (California) on October 12. Ketchell will be conced-
ing Johnson over a stone in weight, and two inches in
height; on the other hand, Johnson is 31 years of age,
while Ketchell is but 22. Ketchellis ahurricane fighter, a
master of the knock-out punch, and a marvel of pluck
and endurance. Californians who are acquainted with
the methods of both men are laying their footwear on the
white lad’s chances. An extraordinary feature of the
negotiations in this match was Johnson’s dogged refusal
to fight a forty-five round contest (which is to
say, a scrap to a finish) which was the sort Ketchell
favored. For three weary hours, Coffroth, the promoter
of the disturbance, besought the ebony calamity to agree
t 0.45 rounds, which is always an attraction with the gore-
loving stoush patrons of the U.S.A.; and then.he was fain
to giveit best. Johnson’s affection forthe 20-round limit
is widely attributed to a conviction on his part that in a
prolonged go he is incapable of lasting—as to courage
and condition—with the physical wonder from Michigan.
“ Oby ” writes
The chief reason why the monument to Explorer
Hamilton Hume was removed from the bank of the
Murray to Alb.ury (N.S.W.) Botanic Gardens was the
desire to save it from the assaults of the hairy mariners
who plough the dangerous stream. Those ancient navi-
gators used to aim coils of rope at the structure in hopes
of pulling alongside, and, had it not been placed beyond
their reach, it would have been dragged into the Big
Trickle soriie dark night and drowned.
“ALWAYS AILING.”
What a world of meaning: these two words con-
vey. Yet in thousands of homes the same tale is
told of sick and ailing wives and daughters who
suffer from constant headaches, loss of energy,
loss of appetite, depression, habitual constipation,
and frequent attacks of biliousness and indi-
gestion.
“For many months,” writes Mrs. Francis, of
32 Shepherd Street, Redfern, Sydney, “I was
always ailing, suffering from bad headaches and
generally depressed. I saw the doctor several
times, and he prescribed medicines, which only
gave me temporary relief. I usually retched upon
rising every morning, and it was not until I com-
menced taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
that this ceased, and I began to recover my
strength and get relief from the headaches. Ever
since, your pills have always been our family
medicine, and, indeed, they are the sole household
remedy of many of my relatives. You are at
liberty to publish this for the benefit of others.”
Are you always ailing? If so, do not give up
hope, do not despair if doctors’ prescriptions and
other medicines have had no permanent effect.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have invariably
proved successful, and thousands of women who
have been restored to health gratefully testify to
the great curative and corrective influences of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills.


The Piano without an Equal—
STEINWAY
THE PIANO BY WHICH ALL OTHERS ARE MEASURED AND JUDGED.
IS NOT MERELY A LOCAL OR NATIONAL ONE.
It is International, Universal, World=wide, and is the recognition in the
strongest possible manner of a work of art that is in its line
without an equal—without a rival.
From its inception it has always been recognised as an art product of
the highest genius, and this qualification has been sustained
throughout the whole world.
What JOSEF HOFFMANN (one of the foremost musicians of the present
day) says of the STEIN WAY
“I have tried English, German, French, Russian and Austrian pianos, but
only when I play the STEINWAY the critics, musicians and the public in general
comment upon the beautiful singing qualities of my piano. In the STEINWAY
alone, POWER, TENDERNESS and DAINTINESS are combined, while in all
other pianos one quality is sacrificed for the others. I use the STEIN WAY
because I know it is the best, and I praise it because good work ought to
be encouraged. America may well be proud of the achievement of
STEINWAY & SONS (New York).”
The unanimous preference expressed by Josef Hoffmann, and hundreds of other
celebrated musicians, surely indicates that the STEIN WAY Piano must be possessed
of qualities that establish its leadership beyond question. Yet you are not asked to
accept the verdict of these great celebrities without personal investigation. The
Piano that has evoked all this enthusiasm is here to-day for you to hear and try.
All that we ask is to permit your own senses to bear witness that it is indeed the
Piano of all others that you would rather own.
IN CONCERT HALLS all the World’s Greatest Pianists use the STEIN WAY.
IN PRIVATE HOMES the STEINWAY is the choice.
IN ROYAL PALACES the STEIN WAY is the chosen Piano.

A melancholy festivity was held last week
in Gore Bay, Sydney, where “ the Trade ” was
entertained by the local representatives of the
Standard Oil Trust to witness the unloading of a
record cargo—2soo tons of kerosene and 500,000
gallons of motor spirit, all imported from the
United States. A few wharf laborers get a casual
job, and a handful of men are employed sealing
the oil in tins, and that represents all the Austra-
lian worker gets out of the record cargo. Mean-
while, for want of Protection, N.S.W.’s great oil
works are lying dead, and the workmen are adrift.
The Yic. Government’s evident determi-
nation to run a State coal mine at the Powlett
River is causing an outburst of settlement in the
locality. The place is at present the wildest
vegetable wilderness, and the roads are long-
drawn-out bogs; but people are ploughing through
the mud and selecting building sites for shops and
other purposes. Also a squad of surveyors is busily
mapping the route for a railway to link the Pow-
lett with civilisation. About this railway there is
trouble. With unobtrusive frankness it is de-
clared that it is the longer, steeper, more costly,
more difficult and more ridiculous of two rival
routes, and that the line is to be dragged round
that way for the enrichment of certain land-
holders who have a pull with John Weary’s
Government, or with somebody who can pull the
Government. And though this story is called a
lie, it isn’t called that in a very convincing voice.
One of the most ruffled humanitarians in
Melbourne these times is Cole, of the Book Arcade,
who has suddenly found himself held up to
ridicule, more or less, as the victim of what the
newspapers called a “ hoax,” but which appears to
have been a quite serious, not to say artful,
attempt to start a system of blackmailing the
good Arcadian. Considering that the first demand
was for a sum of £3OO, with a certainty of more to
follow if the scheme “came off,” there was
nothing very ridiculous about Cole’s application
to the police ; but inasmuch as the would-be black-
mailer was not arrested the detective force stood
to look ridiculous had the facts been truthfully
reported in the Melbourne press. They were un-
truthfully reported, therefore Cole, through his
lawyer, is asking for an explanation of the mis-state-
ments which got into print. Either the newspapers
gave garbled reports of the information supplied
them by the police, or the police have been trying
to conceal the blundering of the precious “ depart-
ment”—at Cole’s expense. The wrong party has
been held up to “ridicule and contempt,” and the
victim is naturally indignant.

MEDICATOR
CURES: Catarrh, Deaf-
ness, Hay Fever, Asth-
ma, Neuralgia, Head-
ache, and Diseases of
Nose, Throat and Ear.
Price. 10s. post free,
Includes Medicator, In-
halent, and Ointment,
with full directions. If
required, extra Inhalent
2s. 6d., Ointment is.
Illustration shows the
Medicator used in two
ways—blowing- into the
nostrils, and inhaling.
Briefly, Catarrh is inflammation of the lining membrane
of the nose and adjoining passages. If the inflammation is
not arrested it invades the ears, throat and lungs, des*'oys
the senses of taste and smell; impairs the sight and hear.ng ;
causes baldness and rots away the frontal bones of the skull.
Dyspepsia and Consumption can also be direct y traced as
starting from the catarrhal discharges. The Ramey Medi-
cator is designed to treat the affected parts by direct applica-
tion. By its use, medicated air is slowly forced through the
nostri's and head and into the lungs. Our inhalent is a disin-
fectant containing carbolic acid. Long-standing cases of
Catarrh, Deafness, Headache, Asthma, Neuralgia, Coughs,
Bronchitis, Colds, Ira Grippe, etc., yield readily to the liea.-
ing properties of our treatment. It" kills the germs and re-
stores normal conditions. It is a well-known fact that our
method of treating catarrh and kindred ailments is endorsed
by thousands who have used it. Why pty a -.pecialist a large
sum of m ney for doubtful results when you can cure yourself
by this simple home treatment? The Ramey Medicator is
highly nickel plated, and should last a lifetime. The medicine
is put on a sponge in the enlarged part of the Medicator, be-
tween the mouthpiece and nose tubes. Full directions with
everv instrument. Send ros, postal note to the Sole Agents

Business, Robbery, etc.
The “ backbone of the country ” in bouth Aus.
seems like putting’ on a little more fat after the present
season is over. Things look so good that orders are
coming in from all parts of the State for implements
wherewith to cultivate the sod; and although the
implement-makers are working at top speed, the demand
exceeds the supply. Which shows that cockj- is feeling
sanguine, likewise joyful. Another pleasing feature is
the general use of local superphosphate. S. Australia's
requirements are estimated at about7o,ooo tons, of which
not more than 10,000 tons will be imported, and the in-
spectors have to keep their eyes in good working order to
ensure that even the 10,000 tons is what it says it is on
the bags.
* * * *
“ Moorabinda ” : The first discovery of silver-
lead ore in South Australia was made in 1838, on a block
of land belonging to Mr. Osmond Gilles, at the foot of
the hills near Adelaide. No attempt was made at that
time to open up the mine, but three years later a teu-
tons of ore were sent to England as a sample, and an assay
made locally resulted in the astounding report that there
were 12,5260 z. of silver to the ton of ore, and 75 per cent*
of lead. It is on record that the first piece of silver dis-
covered in this mine was applied as a stopping to the
front tooth of a member of the Bar. About the same
time a lode of copper was discovered on the banks of the
Onkaparinga, near Noarlunga, on land belonging to the
South Australian Company. The find was shortly
afterwards known as “The Wheal Watkins Lead Mine.”
The great discovery of the period—the rich Kapunda
Copper Mine—was made late in 1842, first by Mr. C. S.
Bagot, youngest son of Captain C. H. Bagot (one of the
“ fathers ” of the province), whilst gathering wild flowers,
and shortly afterwards by Mr. F. S. Dutton. Dutton was
searching for a flock of sheep that had been dispersed in
a thunderstorm, and rode to the top of a hillock ,to view
the surrounding country. The spot at which he pulled
up was beside a large protruding mass of rock, tinged
with green carbonate of copper. Dutton’s first impression
was that the rock was covered with moss ; but, on break-
ing off a piece, he found that the tinge was as bright in
the fracture as on the surface. His acquaintance
with mineralogy was not sufficient to enable him
to pronounce on the character of the rock, but he
had little doubt that it was impregnated with copper.
Dutton and Bagot joined forces. They got 80 acres sur-
veyed, all the forms laid down by the old land-sale regu-
lations being complied with. The land was advertised for
a whole month in the Government Gazette, and the part-
ners became the purchasers of it at the fixed price for
waste lands of £1 per acre. A few Cornish miners were
secured, a considerable quantity of rich ore was raised,
and it soon became evident that the mine was
of unusual value. In purchasing the SO acres,
Dutton? and Bagot thought they had taken in all
the copper deposit, but some other outcroppings
were observed, not only by their own miners, but by
other people. When the next block of 100 acres was put up
to auction, in April, 1845, the price'ran up to £2210, when
the land was knocked down to Captain Bagot. While
excitement was still running high on the Kapunda mines,
the Montacute Mine,in the Mount Lofty Range, 10 miles
from Adelaide, and 16 miles from the. Port, was discovered
by Mr. Fortnum’s overseer (Andrew Henderson), while
searching for a stray bullock. Eortnum was a chemist
and mineralogist, arid at once pronounced the specimen
shown him as rich copper ore. But instead of keeping
his own counsel, he divulged the secret, first to one, then
to another, until at last it reached the Survey Office, and
the chance of securing the land except by competition at
a public sale was lost. It was brought under the hammer
on the 16th February, 1844. A small syndicate deputed
one of its members to bid as high as £4OOO for the 80-acre
section, but at that time little was known about the value
of the Kapunda ores, and the bidding was not very high.
When the price reached £1550 the land was knocked
down to the syndicate’s deputy. Within a few weeks the
syndicate resold less than one-third of its interest for
£5OOO, and the property became merged into the Monta-
cute Mining Company. Several other mines were dis-
covered and partially worked about this time, such as the
Yattagolinga, the Oiikaparinga and others ; but all these
were practically abandoned when, in 1845, the great
Burra Burra mine was discovered. It threw all the others
into insignificance, and gave an enormous impetus to the
mining interests of the province.
“Jar.or”: Put “Genting ; s” apology for the
Gold Buyers Act (B. 10/0/'O9) through the battery, and it
won’t clean up 3gr. of truth to the ton. The Act is not
a “godsend” to the fossicker, but is quite otherwise-,
and"his gain of 10s. per oz., as alleged by “Genung’s ”
gold-buying Ananias, is moonshine. As a matter of fact,
the Act has not affected either way the price paid by the
buyer, who is also a storekeeper; but, on the other
hand,’ the banks throughout Victoria have lowered
their buying price from 2s. to 3s. per oz. That is
the reason the alluvial delver prefers dealing with the
storekeeper, for that means a gain of at 2s.
per oz. —not the loss of “a bob” or “a day’s work,” as
“Geniing” misrepresents. As to buyers’ profit, it runs
to more than “ Is.. per oz.” Take Gippsland mining
camps. Best storekeeper’s price is 795. per oz. in parcels
over sdwt. ; under that, 3s. lid. per dwt., or 78s. 4d. per
oz. Bv actual average assay the value of Gippsland allu-
vial gold is 82s. 3d. per oz. And it is safe to write down
30 per cent, of the individual sales as under sdwt,
As to the selling of stolen gold, the Act of 1907 makes it
no more difficult or risky than of old, and the way of the
“nicker” is not “narrow as the thoroughfare to
Elysium,” but rather wide as the macadam to Hades.
Alluvial miners’ objections to the present Act are—(l)
The futile and troublesome witness; (2) buyers are too
few and far apart; (3) the publicity of the present method
of entering up sales. There is no secrecy about it now, for
there is the open page of the buyers’ book for every seller
and every witness to read ; and naturally the gold digger-
objects to that. In all mining camps there are a few- bad
evgs who do a bit of nocturnal gouging in claims known
to be “on a bit” ; and since the arrival of the Act strik-
ing a patch mostly means camping right on it until it is
worked out. The attitude of quartz miners to the Act
is mostly that of bland indifference ; for most of them
have no gold to sell, and the small percentage of “ nickers,
can easily dodge the law as long as they keep their heads
and hold their tongues.
♦ * *
Judging by this quaint note, somebody seems
to be pushing business in Victoria: —“An insurance
avent asked me to let him insure me. I told him I was
74 but he said that didn’t matter. So, to see how- far the
thing could be carried, I got an order from him to he
examined, and went to the doctor. I told him I was re-
fused by a society 12 years ago for heart failure ; that I
had suffered from rheumatism since I was 26 years old ;
that I had my leg broken two years ago ; that I had been
under an operation for cancer ; that my father died of
cancer, and that two of my brothers had died of con-
sumption. I don’t think they w-ill accept me now ; but
do you think a society which will even hunt up 74-year-
old cases and examine them is quite right in the head t
IN HER TIME!
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
She was .young: and fair and perky, and she stood behind
the bar
That was specially reserved for “ Ladies Only;”
Not in all, but many, hostelries such refuses there are
For the female feeling tired, athirst, and lonely.
And one afternoon there called an elderly and portly
dame,
With an air of conscious pride and satisfaction
In her manifest importance, which aroused no cause for
blame,
But was rather an additional attraction !
“Ah,” she sighed, “you girls have got the times! A
pound a week, I’m told ;
Ordered by the Board, they tell me ! It is nigh time
Wages Boards were all abolished ! With such things Ido
not hold,
For we did without a Wages Board in MY time !
“ Yes, I was behind a bar, my girl, and had to work real
hard,
And no fixed day off but once a month —just one day !
P’r'aps a Tuesday or a Thursday ; Sundays we wore all on
guard,
For we often did our biggest trade on Sunday!
“And my weekly wage was seven-and-six, which’ I
thought paid me well,
For I saved, and now I can afford a high time,
As my savings, when I married, helped to buy a good
hotel—
But, then, barmaids did not put on airs in MY time ! ”
“ No, you hadn’t such good wages,” said the girl behind
the bar.
“ We are better paid than barmaids were aforetime.
Yet you saved much more than we do—careless creatures
that we are !
But they didn’t have cash registers in your time ! ”

London
From the last issue of the “ London Musical Courier” dated May ijth, igog : —-
AUSTRALIAN PIANOS.
News comes from Australia of the still further success of the pianos manu-
factured by Messrs. Beale and Co., of Sydney, New South Wales. This is the
natural result of organised progress and development on the part of this
exceptionally enterprising firm, which produces instruments possessing both
beautiful tone quality and that durability which is absolutely necessary in the
extremes of climate of various countries where they are daily becoming more
and more popular.
Their unique tuning system is of the greatest value where great heat, strong
winds, or intense humidity affect the ordinary piano adversely. By this system
their pianos stand in tune, resisting these trying influences, and for this reason, as
well as their superior tone qualities, they are daily building up a reputation for
supplying the public with pianos of the greatest intrinsic value.
'... ri—-■
Although Messrs. Beale and Co.’s factory is one of the largest in the British
Dominions, it is already found necessary to enlarge it in order to keep pace with
their constantly increasing orders. The unqualified endorsement of the Beale
Pianos at the Franco-British Exhibition, held in London last year, has given an
impetus to their sale, which proves that the laudable efforts of this colonial firm to
produce pianos of the highest class is being widely appreciated. It will be
remembered that they not only won the Grand Pnx for tone and construction, but
the Diplome d’Honneur for quality of iron castings, gold medal for cabinet work
as such, gold medal for inventions and factory arrangements, and silver medal for
bronze castings as such. No such comprehensive list of awards was ever won by
a piano manufacturer before, and it is significant of the pre-eminence of Messrs.
Beale and Co. that they should have been the first to win this distinction.

The Milk Foods closely approximate in composition to
human Milk, the natural and therefore best nourishment for
the young infant.
They are as easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow’s milk as obtained
in towns-
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles need be feared
from the use of the “Allenburys” Foods.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment, hot water
only being necessary.
The “Allenburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.

The first indication of croup is hoarseness,
and in a child subject to croup it may be taken as
a sure sign of the approach of the attack. Follow-
ing this hoarseness is a peculiar rough cough. If
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy be given as soon as
the child becomes hoarse, or even after thecroupy
cough appears, it will prevent the attack. It is
used in many thousands of homes in Australasia,
and never disappoints the anxious mother. We
have yet to learn of a single instance in which
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy has not been
effective. No other preparation can show such a
record. Nearly half a century of constant use
without a failure.*
IN BANANA LAND
Though things are improving every year,
now that Tommy Tanna and his atmosphere of
cheap labor and mental sloth are out of the road,
there is still a shocking lot of waste in the Queens-
land sugar business. Something over 0,000,000
gallons of molasses were turned out from the
mills during last crushing season ; and of that lot
it is admitted that 1,587,000 gallons were de-
liberately run to waste. The department has a
pretty good idea that hundreds of thousands of
gallons more ran to waste ; but it doesn’t know
for certain. Of the total used or saved a, shade
more than half went into the distilleries, and
came out as 391,230 gallons of rum and
171,329 gallons of methylated spirits. To turn
it into methylated spirits seems a poor use to put
such a fine food to; but anyhow it’s better than
letting it run down the mill gutter. Yet it is
pretty certain that the mill gutter will go on
getting it unless either the mill-owner or the
Government uses some pointed arguments with the
shipping cos. on the subject of freights.
“ Flinderino ” : I back my Oldest In-
habitant against The Bulletin’s. Mine dwells
in an out-of-the-way creek on the North Queens-
land coast, and I estimate that he is 300 years old
or thereabouts. To be explicit, he is an alligator
—ora crocodile, if you lake that better. He is
fully 25ft. long, and has a patch of oysters grow-
ing on his back. Experts say that a ’gator grows
lft. every 10 years, so, if he started from scratch,
a 25ft. specimen would be only 250 years of age.
But people who probably don’t know say that
after the alligator has celebrated his 200th birth-
day his growth becomes much more gradual—pro-
bably he then takes 20 years to put on a foot. In
his day he has learned a thing or two ; wherefore,
seldom is anyone with a gun allowed to get within
range, and he knows too much to take a bait. Once
or twice Oysterback has been hit at long range, but
all the bullets did was to break off a few shellfish.
Apparently he encourages the patch of oysters
about his premises. At all events, during the
recent cold weather cunning old Oysterback spent
the sunny hours of the day snoozing on the bank
of his native creek. He would arrange himself in
imitation of a fallen and dilapidated tree trunk.
A passing sea bird, noticing the fine crop of
oysters, would alight on the old log and com-
mence to open the lid of the best-looking fish.
Then there would be a greased-lightning move-
ment, and the log was having its dinner.
The language of “ Leo Lear ” :
Senator M’Coll’s path, while endeavoring to persuade
Queenslanders that they have a blessing instead of a
curse in the prickly pear, promises to be as thorny as the
cactus anathema itself. He states that the pear kept
stock alive during the big drought, butmany cattle-men
express thq opiniqn that it was also responsible for a
multitude of deaths among their kine. This view is born
out by the fact that, in infested country, clumps of pear
(grown from the seeds swallowed by dead beeves) are to
be seen standing among the bones that mark the spot
where an ox handed in its resignation during th • starva-
tion period of ’O2. Furthermore, a leading butcher in a
pear-damned district says the tongues and tripe of local
cattle slain in his yards are unfit for consumption ; they
are a mass of pear thorns, which would eventually per-
forate the walls of the beasts’ innards and cause death.
Even if pear does save some cattle in a drought, only a land-
holder with the intellect of a Yassberra advocate would
grow the vegetable porcupine in anticipation of a lean
year somewhere in the future, and allow it to take the
place of good grass. Every year, before the summer
rains, thousands of acres of country are deliberately,
burnt off in the coastal districts. This burnt area grows
grass 4ft. and sft. high in places, and the tall vegetable
could be stacked away pending a shortage, and would
make much safer and better feed than M’Coll’s blessing,
which has to be burnt and mixed with other fodder before
being used. And other fodder in drought-time is about
as rare as a Dreadnought subscription these days. The
Phidston Government is pushing settlers along in the
matter of pear extermination, and this fact should
go on the credit side of its national account.
The first year that Bananaland gets a long-con-
tinued flood will see the end of miles of pear.
Four or five days under water and the pear orders
its coffin. Two days was the old reckoning, but that
theory has now g'one overboard along with the Six
Hatters yarn. I saw acres of pear covered for two days
in the floods Of 'OB ; but that period of wetness was just
long enough tb rot down the centre stalk and lav the
leaves flat on the ground. These leaves have now rooted,
and a thick forest of young curse has sprung up where
there were previously only scattered clumps. 80 the last
state of the country is worse than the first.
When the last session of the Queensland
Assembly closed, seven members of the old Kid-
ston party were sitting in opposition to their
former leader. These were Airey, Kerr, Blair,
Mann, Murphy, Woods and Sumner. When the
new session opened, the other day, the seven, had
been increased to 11 by the addition of Redwood,
Douglas, Herbertson and Kenna. The 11 include
three ex-Ministers (Airey, Kerr and Blair) and
the mover and seconder of the address-in-replv
two years ago.
“Leo Lear” : To vary the monotony of
salt junk, we residents on the Burnett make good
hauls with our nets. Choose one of the small
bays made by the myriad sandbanks along the
river, swim across the opening with a 50ft. net,
and you have the occupants yarded. If you have
cornered a ‘ ‘ school, ” youfsoon get to know of it. A
scouting mullet, feeling his way over the country,
bumps into your line of attack, and darts back
through the bay like a bolting torpedo. The
alarm spreads wildly, and all the inhabitants
make for the open water, but pull up short on sight-
ing the net. The men at each end work towards
the head of the bay, intending to scoop the whole
show; any spare hands wade behind the belly of
the net to prevent the mullet jumping. But some
old warrior has been at the game before. Getting
back to gain impetus, he comes like a hydro-
plane through the water, rises at the line of
corks, and shoots through space straight for your
middle. Wearing only your birthday garments,
a 31b. mullet ramming you on the water-line puts
you out of action for a few minutes, during which
time many of the captives follow their leader.
Eventually you get to shore with the lame, halt,
blind, and bad “fencers.” You pick out the best
mullet and gars, and pass the rest back. Besides
the chosen few, the haul mostly consists of Jew-
fish, catfish, bonv-bream, perch, eels, turtles,
and numerous small craft. Sometimes a Burnett

salmon is caught; but these air-breathing gentle-
men usually inhabit deep poois under boulders. I
have seen them up to 3ft. sin. long ; but they are
not of much account for the table, although an
aboriginal classes them as “ plenty good.” Mullet
are great rovers; I have found them in small
creeks many miles from the river and a couple of
hundred miles from the sea. After the heavy
frosts last year I picked out many dead ones in the
shallow water.
“ Itan ” : Whafc a remarkable repository
is the soil of Australia for plant life in seed form !
When a dense crop of jungle is cleared it fre-
quently occurs that an undergrowth will spring
up of a totally different class of vegetation. It
may consist of trees, shrubbery, or weeds. In
North Queensland lately a cleared area of scrub
timbers gave place to a dense thicket of wattle, a
tree which had not previously been seen or dreamt
of in the locality. It would be interesting to
know how long the germ of life will remain in
wattle seeds. It requires the heat of a bush fire
to germinate them, but without that they may
remain intact in the soil till somewhere about the
Day of Judgment. After the first cultivated crop
has been gathered off scrub country it is astonish-
ing to, see the variety of weeds which will manifest
themselves in great vigor. The tomato and the
Cape gooseberry are great plants to appear with-
out an introduction. On the North Coast of
N.S.W., when the work of pioneering was going
on 40 years ago, ships could have been filled with
both these products after the maize crops were
gathered. The seeds had come from an unknown
source. The character of the vegetation which
arises along the creeks formed by bore water in
the west of Queensland and N. S. Wales excites
amazement. There, displayed in all their glory,
one may see giant reeds and rushes peculiar to the
coast, and never even heard of previously in the
arid West.
Meteor Downs, with 125,000 acres, is the
largest speck of freehold in Banana!and. One
Donkin owns this little plot of earth.
Kidston keeps queer company these times.
As old-man Barlow has at last given up the Edu-
cation portfolio, W. H. Barnes has been called in
and made Minister. And Barnes is the man who,
not so long ago, told the House that Kidston was
a disreputable character who had been drummed
out of Falkirk, his birthplace.
The Phidston Government had two narrow
escapes on the opening day of the new session of
the Queensland Assembly. J. T. Bell, its nomi-
nee for the Speakership, was elected by 37 to 35,
and its majority would have been one less if
“Joey” hadn’t been dragged back to vote for
himself. After that close call, the Government
moved the adjournment, and only carried that by
37 to 34. There is a stormy time ahead for Kilp
and Co.
Mrs. Jumbuck isn’t quite such a prolific
mother as the missus of Brer Rabbit; but, given
anything like a fair chance, the lady with the
woollen overcoat has a pretty good birth-rate
record. Queensland has had four respectable
seasons, so the lady who lives there has had her
chance; and already the result is that Charters
Towers is buying fat ewes at ss. the carcase, or
three-ha’pence per lb. Charters Towers gets first
serve when the Queensland western district is
overflowing ; but even coastal places like Towns-
ville are promised the cheapest chops they have
had for seven years or so. They will have to pay
the same old famine prices for their beef-steak,
however—“ Cattle King ” Kidman and his crowd
will see to that.
More Society news from Torres Strait: —
The Torres Strait native policeman is a person of im-
portance. Government provides him with one uniform—
a symphony in scarlet—and it has to last him five years.
But then Government also pays him no less than one
and eightpence a month. Still he doesn’t have to wear
his symphony as a regular thing. He only puts it on to
receive distinguished visitors (with whom he shakes
hands), to dig out truants from school or kirk, and to
walk round with a wand in prayer-meeting and wake up
the sleepy-heads. At most other times he is a semi-savage
sitting round in a sarong.
Each Torres Strait island used to be an absolute mon-
archy ; but the monarch (the London Missionary Society)
and the schoolmaster did not blend. So the islanders,
enlightened by Commerce—they trade pearlshell, bfiche-
de-mer and such like with Thursday Island—established
republics, each administered by a Council of four pre-
sided over by the teacher. Trivial domestic details, pub-
lic morals and family squabbles are “sat over” by the
Council, and adjudicated on according to native law.
Criminal -cases and inter-island matters are taken to the
police magistrate at Thursday Island.
For instance, at Saibai, one Sunday, when the natives
were in kirk, two dogs began to fight outside. The
owners went out and joined in. Gradually the edifice
emptied, one squabble made more, till the whole village
was struggling and squealing. The Council fined each
battler, including the curs, two shillings—and made a
mighty feast with the proceeds.
On Boigu there were four winsome widows, at whom
the wives sneered sideways. One evening Onise, the
prettiest, found a poison snake coiled in her hut. Amah,
whose wife was away, happened to be passing. He slew
the snake. Which was proof positive. So next day the
Council “ sat,” and ordered the relicts to re-marry. Said
Wap, the chief: “ When the diving boats come in, you
must each marry one man.” The boats came ; but a soft
soul crept down and warned the prospective grooms,
wherefore they refused to come ashore. Council sat
again. It said : “As you cannot catch a Boigu boy, you
must go across to Badu. Suppose no luck, go Moa.
Suppose every place no can, there are good grass huts
(deserted) on York. We sick of too much trouble.”

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP-
Brisbane, July 3, 1909,
My Dear Thargomindah,—
That tide which is ever supposed to exist in the
affairs of men flowed to its full as regards Joey
Bell on Tuesday, and floated him (with the aid of
every Government vote, including his own, which
he was hauled back into the chamber to record) into
the (Speaker’s lace tie and chair. His majority
was just two. Next morning, however, his smiles
were turned to fury when he opened the
pages of a certain daily and beheld himself
in full official robes. An enterprising editor had
caused the picture of the late John Leahy to be
decapitated and pasted on the cranium of the
laird of Jimbour, with the unfortunate result of
hunched shoulders and an inflated corporation in
place of Joey’s own graceful proportions. The
new Speaker is no more averse than any other
politician to stepping into dead men’s shoes, if
only the cast-offs be passing comfortable, but to
have the whole body and clothes of the defunct
foisted upon you is quite another matter.
The rain made Wednesday’s official opening of
the House of Recriminations a sad, damp affair.
True, the Chief Justice and his brother Real, in
their scarlet robes, together with the Mayor
(who had evidently a cold in his head, for he
never removed his hat at “Gor save ”) did their
best to give a tone to the gathering ; but the mud
and the threatened downpour were too much for the
average she. The consequence was an outbreak
of caution in the shape of coats and skirts and
subdued millinery. The lady of the House of
Morgan was quiet-looking in dark blue, with a
black and green lid ; and her large but youthful
offspring braved the elements in turquoise
blue. Our graceful but fast vanishing Mayoress
wrapped herself in much the same shade.
Melba, who came along to see the show, flanked
by a plum-tinted robe containing Mrs. Speaker,
sported nothing more striking than silver-grey.
Later, when the “ party went out,” the singing
divinity worried a cutlet with the whole peal of
Bells—ma, sister, wife, and two step-daughters—
and was shown over the House, introduced to the
pleasant Morgan couple in the midst of a family
lunch, and finally given a seat in the Chamber of
Debate and 111-feeling.
Just when the political atmosphere has
thickened to an alarming degree, and when cries
of “Resign” mingle with the announcement of
each division, and a general election seems a
certainty, the Kidstons have, I hear, fallen into
evil ways of extravagance. They have hired a
new abode at a rental of 17s. 6d. a week, and are
preparing to move therein. It is alleged that a
burst of garish hospitality was. contemplated upon
the new carpets, but William of Falkirk has
fallen upon such precarious political days that the
haggis js postponed until it is possible to decide
whether the thing is worth while.
Miss Winnie Hicks, who is'about to wed an
English D. 5.0., is well on the way to have her
digestion permanently impaired. She teas con-
tinuously. This week there was an acute out-
break of doyleys and incidentally of verse,
sufficient to stock a castle and a three-volume
autograph album.
Another marrier (or should it be wedder?) of
note this month is the nephew of Queensland
National Bank general-manager Ralston, who is.
to take unto himself Mabel, third daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. R. M. Collins, Tamrookum. This
makes the fourth wedding in the family in four
years.
The Melba fete, which happily struck the only’
three dry hours in a howling wet week, was at :
once the finest money-getter and the dullest
entertainment that has taken place in this city
for a decade. The arrangements simply weren’t.
There was no enclosed space for the ceremony,:
and no order. The feminines, about 3000 strong,
fought and scratched to be in at the death ;: and
they were, for they squeezed the official function,
out of existence and spoiled the drill that was to:
have followed it. Then every woman of them,
followed Melba’s blue crepe gown and black hat
from stall to stall, and stood round in full strength;
to see her drink tea and eat scones at an
unprotected table. The stalls, barring the one
dedicated, to food and sweets, were uninviting. ;
The drink (I mean tea) ran short, and the only
really interesting thing, in the whole affair was
Mistress Betty Ohls and a. bevy of fair Jacks and
Jills Under a gigantic Jap brolly, selling autograph
postcards at a bob a. name. The receipts panned
out at about £2OO for the two hours.
Both the Melba concerts filled the Exhibition
Hall to overflowing. The songstress flashed upon
her first audience in a gush of pope’s red ; but on
Saturday evening ivory satin, with diamonds and -
turquoise, composed the bill of clothes. Her
temper, still edgy, found vent in a comprehen-
sive !!! !! when the audience demanded a ninth
encore.
The Melba party, including son George, left on
Friday evening’s mail for Rockhampton.
Thursday being Canadian Dominion Day, Mrs.
Bengough celebrated the event with a tony little
tea, at which the menu cards were adorned with
cute thumbnail sketches of Canada’s own beaver
shaking paws with a kangaroo. The merry little
hostess draped herself in a dainty grey robe,
which went well with the roses she received.
Yours sincerely,
MARIO.
In consequence of what Queensland Rail-
way Commissioner Thallon saw' when he went
travelling recently, the Queensland part of the
Brisbane-Sydney mail train will shortly be one of
the most comfortable conveyances in the Common-
wealth. There will be three such trains, and
while two are running the third will be getting
its hair brushed and its tail washed. Each will
consist of a chair car. costing £2100; a first-class
compartment, costing the same ; two second-class
carriages, costing £i9oo each ; and a composite
car, costing £2OOO. The chair car w'ill be supplied
w’ith revolving seats ; and as all the carriages will
be on the corridor principle, travellers will be able
to walk from end to end of the train. Some of
the new vehicles are now being built at the
Government workshops at Ipswich, for Queens-
land long ago gave up importing its strolling
stock.


THE NARROW GAUGE.
Queensland adopted the 3ft. 6in., or narrow gauge
system. The systems in vogue in Australia
are :—
ft. in.
N.S.W. 4 8\
• Victoria \ 5 3
South Australia (main lines) J
Northern Territory I
Westralia
Tasmania V ... ... 3 6
Queensland
S.A. (branch lines) j
This gauge has the greatest mileage now in Aus-
tralia. the figures being: —
Miles.
Narrow gauge (including private lines) 7746%
sft. Sin. gauge ... ... ... ... 3954
4ft. B\in. gauge ... ... ... ... 3453
In order, therefore, to render the gauges uniform
throughout Australia, the adoption of the
narrow gauge presents the least difficulties.
The figures given were for 1907. The narrow
gauge roads have greatly increased in mileage
since.
The choice of this gauge has enabled Queensland to
build nearly as great a mileage as either
N.S. W. or Victoria.
This policy has enabled the Queensland Government
to —
1. Settle thousands of men on the empty spaces.
2. Bring millions of acres of forest land into
productive use.
3. Add to the collective wealth of the nation
several millions of pounds sterling.

THE RAILWAY SYSTEM.—III.
By J. D. FITZGERALD.
When the statesmen of Queensland’s vigorous
youth decided to replace the slow, laborious
bullock and horse team by the swift locomotive,
the ideas which are firmly held in Australia upon
State ownership of railways were then but im-
perfectly developed. The sacrosanctity of the
principle of private ownership, as it is regarded to-
day in England and the United States, was then
almost accepted in Queensland. If it was not
carried into effect, it was the fault of Private
Enterprise itself to a great extent. For, while it
was prepared to accept great concessions from the
State, it was extremely reluctant to furnish the
money. As it is money which makes the iron
mare go, the private speculators lost their
chance. The first of the private railway ventures
—the Moreton Bay Tramway Company—was an
egregious failure. It secured ample powers from
the young Queensland Parliament (then hardly
more than a year old), and it also secured a
declaration in the preamble of the Bill, that “it
is expedient that the public revenues of the Colony
should not be charged with the expenditure re-
quired for such purposes,” and that “encourage-
ment should be afforded to Private Enterprise ”
in tramway construction.
In the Bill which was afterwards passed into
law, we come into contact with what is known as
the “land grant” system of railway building—
not unknown in the United States of America.
The State, as the Feudal Lord
Paramount, allotted to the
Company, in con-
sideration of the

ot a tram-

nect Ipswich
with Toowotnba,
alternate blocks of
Crownlands, at the
rate of one acre for
every £1 expended
on the rail way. The
Company, after 21 years’ working of the line, was
to hand it over to the Government in considera-
tion of the use of it for that term and of the
alternate blocks of land granted to the Company
along the line of route, which it could either
put to use or sell, at its pleasure. This project
was, no doubt, a valuable sop to Private Enter-
prise, as applied to railway building ; but it was
thrown away. The Company could not find the
money, and the project fell
through. The negotiations and
the failure to begin work had
one good effect—it spurred the 1
Government on to fresh efforts,
and convinced it and the people
behind it that for develop-
mental purposes the Govern-
ment must be its own railway
builder.
The whole of the rail-
way systems of the States

SOUTH QUEENSLAND.
have borne out this view. It
stands to reason that the
Government of a young country
. n , ,
would not. hesitate to build
railways for developmental
purposes —purposes which a private company
neither would nor could undertake. Many of the
most useful railway lines, which were built on the
strength of a policy of opening up the country,
are run at a loss. In later years another principle
has been applied (already referred to) by which a
neighborhood guarantees, in advance, a refund of
the loss to the Government on a projected rail-
way. It may safely be said that if the develop-
ment of the Commonwealth by railway build-
ing had been allowed to depend upon Private En-
terprise, we should not be in
anything like the favor-
able position in
which we
are now.
A THRIVING REAVE.— TALLEGALLA,
LOCKYER DISTRICT.
This may
be asserted
without in any
way discussing the
question of the pro-
per functions of the
State as against Pri-
vate Enterprise. In
Queensland, so far as railway construction was
concerned, the latter system had its chance, and
failed to avail itself of the fleeting opportunity.
Not that the policy of Queensland is to debar a
private company from building a railway for its
own, as apart from public, purposes. Up to the
year 1907 there were 295 miles of privately-owned
railways opened, which cost £821,737 to build.
Most of these are available for public use.
It must be noted that the idea of a “land-
grant” railway scheme was not, in itself, a bad
one. It meant the settlement of population along
the sections of the railway line as each was built.
The land was to be made available on the road ;
each alternate block belong-
ing to the Govern-
ment would at
once receive
an enhance-
ment of
the then
problema-
tical prairie
value, while
the alternate pri-
vate blocks would,
when sold or
leased, provide
the capita] or
the security for
the railway build-
ers. The same plan is being put into
practice in Siberia to-day, though on differ-
ent principles ; because the great military
railway from Moscow to Vladivostock, of which
the first cost was £70,000.000, is now being
used to transport Cossack farmers on to
blocks surveyed along the railway line. There
is no reason, however, why the same scheme
of settlement should not be applied to a
Government as to a “land-grant” railway
with just as much prospect of success as might
attend the operations of a private
company. The principle came
up for final decision later on,
when Sir Thomas Mcllwraith re-
vived the idea of land-grant rail-
ways, to be built by Private
Enterprise, and fell from power
through his advocacy of it.
On a land -gran t rai 1 way sch eme,
the company would not only be
bound to build a railway line;
it would have to bring the people
to settle on its land. It would
have to establish an office in
London, or some other centre
of European population, and use
the devices of ad vert.smg, etc
to catch the eye of the emigrant,
Possibly it would not be too
particular as to the representa-
tious which its agents might make so long as it
secured the occupation of its land by settlers. Nor
can it be supposed that it would be inclined to
scrutinise too closely the class of emigrant which
its agents sent to Queensland. At several points
the private company would, therefore, clash with
the clear policy of the State of Queensland towards
immigration. When you are endeavoring to fill up
your waste spaces, develop your public estate,
increase vour natural wealth, and provide for
defence by an immigration policy, numbers are
an important factor, of course; but quantity is
not everything. Suitability of the new men to
the new country is eminently
desirable ; and it is
to the interests
of the State of
Queensland
that
neither
shall the
emigrant he
deceived as to
the nature of the
country he is,coming
to, nor shall the
Government he de-
ceived as to the
nature of its immi-
grants.
With all the fascination which a land-grant
railway scheme has on paper, the present system
of the Government of Queensland is far better.
It plans and builds its railways, after ex-
haustive tests as to the probabilities of success,
and after fully convincing itself of the natural
resources in the district in which the railway is to
be constructed. It borrows on the public credit,
and its securities are better than any which can
be offered by a private company, which probably
would no more be able to construct a great rail-
way line without borrowed money than the
Government. All the services of Government are
at the disposal of the State scheme. One depart-
ment classifies lands, and values them. The emi-
grant, before he leaves his own home in Europe,
can, with all the information which the Queens-
land bureaux in London or in Brisbane supply,
know exactly where to get land, what it will cost,
and what is the nature of his railway communica-
tion with the world’s or his own local market. In
furnishing this information there is no necessity
for misrepresentation. The bald statistics and
the facts speak for themselves, and he who runs
may read. The Queensland authorities, on their
side, see to it that no undesirable emigrants are
allowed to avail themselves of the concessions
which the State makes to those whom it desires
to attract to its shores, with a view to helping to
develop its great national heritage.
The failure at the outset of a Queensland rail-
way policy based on private enterprise, thrust
the task back upon the Government. It was no
easy task. There was, first, the choice of gauge—
a matter of the most vital importance, in which,
as many experts think, a most admirable choice
was made of the 3ft. Gin. gauge. We may now
regret, as Australians, that a uniform gauge was
not adopted on all the railways of the Common-
wealth ; but from the standpoint of Queensland
there is no cause for repentance. Though a few
men of prescience, possessors of the prophetic eye
of statesmen, saw the future greatness of Aus-
tralia, it is doubtful if they connected it with the
prosaic matter of railway gauges. When the
poet Campbell, his eye in a fine frenzy rolling,
wrote of Australia—
Delig'htful land, in wildhess even benign,
The glorious past is ours, the future thine.
As in a cradled Hercules we trace
The lines of Empire on thine infant face ;
he saw the future as through a glass darkly ; but
neither he nor the other prophets of our future
greatness concerned themselves to adumbrate a
railway policy (if they had known what rail-
ways were) for the Commonwealth; in itself
another detail that was unobserved by the pro-
phetic eye, but which even then was in the
fruitful womb of Time, awaiting the right moment
to he born.
We all hope that some day a device will be per-
fected (it is claimed that more than one now

exists) which will enable us to carry our trains
over the whole of the Australian lines of railway
without the passengers having to change at
border stations- as they have to do now on the
borders of N.S.W. and Queensland and N.S.W.
and Victoria, owing to the gauges of these three
States being dissimilar. If this device is effective,
and the running gear of the carriages can be auto-
matically adjusted to the change of gauge, it will
put the coping-stone on the credit due to those
who decided upon the Queensland gauge, for it
will be proved that the economy of that gauge is
not inconsistent with those defensive measures
which, at the time of need, may depend upon the
feasibleness of transporting troops and supplies
from one end of the Commonwealth to the other
with all possible speed. Meanwhile the advant-
age which the narrow gauge has given the St-'-**}
of Queensland are, first, that it has enabled
State to build nearly as great a mileag® a*?
N.S.W., at about half the cost; and then, in fes
construction itself, it has simplified the problems
which cost so much to solve in other States. The
late W. H. Traill wrote: —
The uninitiated might suppose that a difference in cost,
hetween, for instance, the Queensland 3ft. 6in. railways
and those of N.S.W., at 4ft. BJin., would be arrived at by a
simple calculation of proportion. This, however, is far
from being the case. It is not merely in dimensions of
cuttings and embankments, width of bridges, length of
sle pers, weight of rails, and amount of ballast, that
differences exist. In surveying a route for a railway, the
adoption of the shorter course permitted by the narrower
wheel base gives extraordinary advantages. Obstacles
can be avoided by sharp detours ; the track can be
twisted round this cliff-face or that ravine, and by such
and similar facilities, miles of distance saved between two
points.
It can also be seen that heavy construction ex-
penses can be avoided by the handiness of a
narrow gauge. So that, all things considered, the
choice of gauge was a very fortunate one. and
meant a great deal to the Northern State. Had it
not been for the economy in construction, which
was a corollary of the adoption of the narrow-
gauge system, thousands of men who are doing
well on the land to-day in Queensland would
never have had an opportunity of getting there;
millions of acres of pastoral and agricultural land
which are yielding their spoils to the world to-day
would have remained in the desert stage. But the
rest of the story of the Queensland rail ways will be
told in next issue.


A DREADFUL STATE
Four Children Suffered a Year with
Terrible Ringworm Hair All
Came Out in Patches Leaving
Scalp Dry and Scaly —Grew
Worse Under Various Treatments.
ALL CURED BY TWO
SETS OF CUTICURA
"About eighteen months ago my four
children had ringworms 'on the body
and head. They were under the doc-
tor’s care over three months without
any satisfactory result; in fact they got
worse. Then we tried several other
so-called remedies without effect. All
the hair came off in patches and left
the scalp dry and scaly. They were
in a dreadful state. At last a friend
persuaded me to try the Cuticura Rem-
edies. I used the complete treatment,
Cuticura Soap, Ointment and Resolv-
ent. I had two lots of each and before
I finished the second lot they were
completely cured. Now they have
beautiful heads of hair, soft and glossy.
I still continue to use the Cuticura Soap,
which I find much superior to all other
soaps for the head and skin. My chil-
dren had been suffering nearly twelve
months before I tried the Cuticura
Remedies and I shall always recom-
mend them to others. Edward S.

The people who saw the safe from which
the recent Melbourne jewel robbers extracted
£6500 worth of stones are pretty unanimous that
the job must have been an uproarious proceeding—
a sort of burglars’anvil-chorus, in fact. Yet the
unpleasant noise did not disturb the police. The
safe-smashers completed their deafening business
without one curse of protest, and, after collecting
the gems, let themselves out, slammed the door,
and trudged home like tired plumbers, or plough-
men plodding their weary way. If anything with
a helmet on the summit of its anatomy heard the
hammering, chiselling, and the dull thud when
the murdered safe fell on its face, the helmet-
stand apparently thought that someone had un-
expectedly opened an iron foundry. Yet the fact
that it was Sunday, and that the metallic uproar
came from a small room on the first floor of a city
building, might have aroused a glimmer of curiosity
in the official intellect. If safe-opening made the
same sort of sound that beer does when it is
poured out, the brigands would undoubtedly have
been served with a summons for Sunday trading
before they had packed up their tools. Is there
any instance of a pub being robbed on Sunday ?
“ 0.K.” : Carlyle Smythe’s article,
“Modern Germany, through Australian Eyes,”
published in Sydney Morning Herald, strikes
me as being about the brightest and most inform-
ative thing of its kind that I’ve ever read in a
weighty daily journal. It throws sidelights on
the situation that are more illuminative than top
or front lights. For instance :
It would be scarcely accurate to describe any section
of German journalism as the “ provincial press,” as
that term is applied in England or France. It would
be almost nearer to the facts to say that the only provin-
cial press in Germany comes from the capital. The
authority of the opinions expressed by the great dailies
of Cologne, Frankfort, Hamburg, and Munich, to men-
tion only the chief centres, equals, and sometimes even
surpasses, those of the papers published in Berlin : and
it is surprising for the stranger to discover that one of the
leading- organs of German public opinion is published in
Vienna, and that the greatest illustrated weekly is issued
in the comparatively small city of Leipzig.
Id is this broad basis of public opinion which gives
strength to the term “United Germany.” Again,
Carlyle Smythe casually exposes the fallacies of
English deductions from German wage statistics,
whilst he paints a picture of industrial life in the
Fatherland:—
Everybody seems to be at work : the men in the fac-
tories, the women in the fields. Women not only till,
manure and sow the ground, but between Potsdam and
Berlin they are employed on railway construction works.
In the very heart of Berlin, in the beautiful Tiergarten,
the work usually done in London, Vienna and Paris by
men, the turning over of the beds and cleaning of the
paths, is done by women. The general employment of
women in Germany, never entered in the English statis-
tics of wages earned on the Continent, upsets all calcula-
tions on which are based the usual comparisons of the
relative standard of comfort among the working classes
in the two countries. The boast that there is no'leisured
class in modern Germany seems justified. The old idea
that the Germans are a race of philosophers must be
revised. They are an empire of stern realists and tireless
producers.
And “God’s Chosen People” are increasing at
he rate of 20,000 a week.
Dr. J. B. Nash, of Sydney, who valor-
ously backs up Bill Lyne, and is looked on in
other ways as a coming active politician, is an
instance of a man whom life in a dull and parish-
minded Legislative Council awoke to the wider
service of the State. The rule, notwithstanding
such an exception as the case of R. E. O’Connor,
is that the Upper House kills the sense of public
duty. Dr. Nash succeeded to his father’s medical
practice at Newcastle, and, though taking a
philanthropic interest in the community gene-
rally, he rigidly abstained from contentious
politics till his appointment to the Legislative
Council. Since that date, however, his political
sphere has consistently extended. He is com-
paratively young (born in 1857), a Sydney
graduate, and keenly interested in everything
Australian ; and N.S.W. Legislative Council will,
it is hinted, be his springboard to a place in the
Australian Parliament.
“ N.” sends an amazingly raniblesdme and
wandering-all-over-the-shop item :
Britain’s old-time Premier Melbourne is recalled by the
announcement that Windsdr Castle has 100 volumes of
Queen Victoria’s diary and 1200 volumes of her corres-
p mdence. The earlier part of a biography is always
the most interesting. The eccentric G. F. Train was a
Melbourne merchant from 1854 to 1858, yet he coolly set
down in his book, called “ Young America Abroad,” that
Premier Melbourne came up the Yarra and founded the
city. Bourke named Williamstown because he thought
it would be more important than Melbourne. Curious
that prayers were offered for Archbishop Smith in
St. Paul’s, Melbourne, many hours after his death.
A reporter went to Archbishop Clarke and told
him. Prayers were offered in Sydney for William IV. up
to three mouths after Victoria’s accession. William Lamb,
second Lord Melbourne, was born in 1779. Byron said that
William’s mother was incomparably the best woman he
ever knew. Yet Greville hints a suspicion that William
and his sister, Lady Covvper, afterwards Lady Palmerston,
were the children of Lord Egremont. Melbourne married
Lady Caroline Ponsonbv, a little blonde (like Lucretia
B)rgia), with manners described as unrivalled for fascina-
tion. She was much mixed up with Byron. See Mrs.
Humphrey Ward’s “ William Ashe.” Melbourne was
Premier in 1836, when the f 'rim. Con. case of Norton v.
Norton was plotted to ruin him. Verdict for defendant.
Melbourne had been concerned in a former divorce case,
which was withdrawn. Such matters did not promise
well for his Premiership with Victoria, that eminently
Podsnappian moralist.
A few people at a Brisbane hotel enjoyed
a little telephonic exchange between the manage-
ment of a theatrical co. recently in active eruption
thereabouts and the attache of a distinguished
scientist. The attache wanted most-favored-
nation privileges for his principal in the selection
of a seat. “Yes; who is the gentleman?” said
the manager. “ Tommy Burns ! ” came the
answer. “Burns, did you say?” “Yes, Burns
—Tommy Burns.” “ But who is he ?” “ What,
don’t you know Tommy Burns ? ” “Who is the
gentleman ? ” “ Why, Tommy Burns the pugilist,
ex-champion of the world—the man who fought
.Johnson?’’ “Johnson? Who is Johnson?”
There was silence at the other end for a moment,
and then came the query, slowly and emphati-
cally : “ I say, you—did you ever hear of God ? ”
That false and disreputable tale told by
N.S.W. Works Minister Lee, to the effect that
the Federal policy was preventing railway exten-
sion and such-like works, has now got as far as
England, hence pars like the folio .ring in the
London papers
“ Go slow,” is now the motto of the States, the Minister
for Works has informed a deputation. A new Federal
policy had been issued, lie said, and the finances would
be crippled. The deputation had asked Mr. Lee for the
Construction of certain s.-werage works and the extension
of a tramway but though lie would have granted the
requests, the Federal Government now made it im-
p issible.
11 was a shabby mockery of a pretence, for
N.S.W. railways and sewers and tramways are
built out of loans, and the fact that the
Federal old-age pension system reduced the
N.S.W. revenue a little was a matter which had
no bearing on these works. Unfortunately
there are far too many State politicians who
regard any lie as justifiable, and even creditable,
so long as it is a lie directed against the Aus-
tralian Government. That seems to be the only
excuse which can be offered in this case.

The vitality of some things that were
better dead ! Many years ago The Bulletin
was sent a story concerning a little lad named
Tommy or .Willy or Eustace or Hasdrubal —it
forgets which at the moment —whose mother, by
way of countering a school-teacher’s rebuke in re
liis unwashedness, stated that her child was
admittedly “no violet,” and was “to be learned
and not smelled.” Ever since, during all those
long, weary years, this paper has been rebuking
people in its “ Corres.” col. for seeking to unload
the old anecdote on it as a recent happening in
Bourke or Thargomindah or Kalgoorlie West or
Oollins-street North. Last week, the Sydney
Telegraph found and starred it, under the waggish
caption “Our Tommy Ain’t Violets,” as an
incident which had occurred a few days previously
to —
a teacher in South Australia, who recognised it his
■ luty to protect the olfactory organs of his pupils from
being disgusted by the foul skin and clothing of one of
his flock.
We are sure that years hence when the Dread-
nought fund is closed, and Allen Taylor is
a knight, and the States have ceased from
borrowing, and alcohol is free, compulsory and
unsectarian, and the millennium adjacent, that the
aged quip will still be going the rounds. And at
l ist London Punch will get it. Then, and not
till then, will it fall dead.
The City of Sydney Improvement Com-
mission bogged hopelessly over the financial
difficulty. It suggested a scheme that was pretty
comprehensive in its way; but it said that the
scheme woqld have to be very gradual because of
the cost involved. The Commission apparently
didn’t dare to suggest that the German methods
adopted in similar cases might be tried with
advantage. If a German town decides to recon-
struct itself, it doesn’t spend hundreds of
thousands of borrowed money in resumptions,
and let the undeserving landlord reap most
of the benefit of the improvements. It
simply takes possession of the area to be
reconstructed, plans out the necessary roads,
avenues, parks, and public buildings, and then,
deducting the area used for these purposes from
the gross area resumed, redivides the residue pro-
portionately amongst the owners whose land has
been mixed up in the transaction. A landowner
may receive a block entirely different from the one
he previously held, and the block is, of course,
smaller; but it is estimated that the improve-
ments make.it of equal if not greater value. In
Sydney, however, the landowner is so used to
making money out of the fool people that he
would cry with a loud voice that any suggestion of
that sort is Socialism and Confiscation ; and even
if Paradise had a signboard bearing those words
hoisted over it, quite a lot of supremely virtuous
people would at once shy off the place 'with out
even looking through the gates. .
To a man who shaves every day a good razor is
as necessary as a good breakfast. “ Cheap and nasty ”in
a razor doesn’t pay. Huy a good one—a reliable, long
wearing, thoroughly satisfactory article. The I’l.t'M (for
which Messrs. Craig arid Aitken are the sole agents) is the
finest imported razor. Made of unequalled Sheffield
steel, specially hollow-ground, and finally trued to a
particularly keen edge—it is famed for its splendid re-
sults, day after day doing the same work, giving the
clean, quick, comfortable, and perfect shave that every
man desires but few get. Messrs. Craig and-Aitken will
forward the Plum razor for 10s. 6d., post free, anywhere
—and also give a guarantee to ke p the razor in perfect
shaving order for two years free of charge.*
“Platman” writes from a far northern
address :
I want to move an amendment to “Harrison O.’s”
motion re BillLyne(B. 17/6/'00). “Three cheers’’bed d.
I move that every Australian puts his back up at the
next e-lection and votes straight for the policy that Li ne
has preached for so long. Thar, is better than 161 cheers.
Certainly Lyne’s sermon hasn’t been eloquent, and has
been expressed in deeds rather than in words ; but that
should count unto him for righteousness. Just think,
O eloquent ones, what a h -1 of a lot of explanation
D»akin will have to make to reconcile his present position
with his past professions.


“ Galleryite ” speaks :
Perhaps the most pathetic figure in the Federal House
to-day is Willy Kelly. For utter, despairful loneliness
there is only one to compare him with —to \vt;t, Bruce
Smith. William and Bruce resemble one another, inas-
much as each advocates causes which are not moribund
merely, but Utterly dead and coffined. But Bruce is dis-
mally proud in his isolation. He believes firmly in the
burst doctrines he advocates. He is a whole-hog anti-
Socialist. lam sure that if he had the chance he would,
without a moment’s hesitation, denationalise the railways
andN.S. W. tramways, and hand every other State Concern
over to Private Enterprise. Furthermore, he would provide
Australia with complete Freetrade, and so ruin it within
five years or-less. As to defence, he would rely for ever
wholly on the dear old Motherland, and when the Japs
arrived he would be found on the steps of the Burwood
Town Hall with a Union Jack in his hand, arguing poly-
syllabicallv that the thing was incredible, and that none
but rank disloyalists and Dingoes would support the view
that a magnificent race like the Japanese had invaded a
country under the aegis of the Flag. And he would con-
tinue arguing to that effect till the new arrivals convinced
him of his error at the point of a sharp weapon. Willy
Kelly, unless my judgment is horribly awry, has
no convictions. He is a politician after the Foreign-
trade newspapers’ own heart. He takes liter-
ally each fresh doctrine these organs propound;
and continues to cling wildly to the said doctrine long
after all hands (the journals in. question included) have
recognised its decease. Willy, as above-stated, cherishes
no deep-seated belief in the foolishnesses he advocates. He
hasn’t that sort of niind. His trouble is that, unlike Joe
Oook and the rest of them, who are capable of being
about 15 different political things in as many months, he
has no talent for getting in out of the wet. William
dived feverishly into the “ Dreadnought movement;,” and
pointed out, whenever he could get half a dozen
listeners, that unless the Motherland got the dashedo
craft it would hurst forthwith. Now the Motherland
has coldly said that if Australia feels it must blew
at, 000,000 of borrowed money, well and good ; but
emphatically it (the Motherland) will not have a Dread-
nought. Yet William talks Dreadnausea as earnestly as
ever. William is a Foreign-traderof the uncompromising
breed. Yet the Confused Party, to which he now belongs,
and the confused leader which he is pledged to follow, are
committed to a “rectification of tariff anomalies”—
things which in Willy’s electorate are not regarded as
anomalies, but as blessings. And, finally, William’s
expressed Defence views are that the Australian Navy
idea is dementia pure and simple 1 , and he m all for
an increased subsidy to Britain. But his party
has adopted the scheme of an Australian navy,
and it is not only not going to increase tbe
present subsidy, but to do away with it altogether. And
to crown his miseries—Or, possibly, because of them—
Willy has had his Whipship torn from him and handed
to Hume Cook. And so he has gone to live in a corner
of anguish by himself with Johnson of Lang, and Willis,
and other dejected persons. The man who has no pity
for Willy—the deluded of Party politicians, the member
who made the cardinal errorof believing that his Foreign-
trade colleagues and the Anti-Sosh newspapers meant
what they said —has a hard, cold brickbat in his interior
ih place of a heart.

TO KEEP YOU SICK!
THE first impulse of persons who find that they are ailing in any way is to
plunge into a chemist’s and purchase a box of pills or a bottle of some patent
medicine. . . Failing to get more than temporary relief from this they then
consult a doctor, and he writes a prescription which more than likely calls for the
same medicine, only in a different form from what the patient has already taken.
The same result, generally. Next, the patient comes to the conclusion that this
doctor didn’t diagnose the case right, and then goes to another, with the same
result. And so on.
Oup modern medical system Is a foolish system. We practically pay
our doctors to keep us ill. Their prosperity depends not on our health,
BUT ON OUR SICKNESS I . . . To-day very little is known of medicine
and its use. The wisest doctor can do but little more than clear out
the system or accelerate the action of the heart. When he has done these
things he has reached the end. MEDICINE CANNOT MAKE STRENGTH.
Now, just study yourself for a moment. The failure or breaking down of any
organic function means that it has not strength to do its work. If there was any
nourishment in medicine it might bring about a healthy change, but you know there
is not. Drugs, medicines, stimulants, narcotics ai d antidotes are POISONS, not
food. Food is needed to build up new energy. F.lectricity is nerve food, nerve life.
No pain or debility can exist in a body charged with Electric Life; you can have
no WeaKness, no Inactive Parts, no Rheumatism, Indi-
gestion, Constipation or Kidney Trouble, if you fill your
body with it, because the life generated by this grand force gives health and
strength to every organ, and
Dr.MgLAUGHLIN'S electric belt
is the newest and most successful method of applying it. It is a series of small batteries which }-ou wear about your waist.
It worKs wlaile you sleep, and generates its power constantly. t lt is worn as comfortably as your clothing,
adjusted in a minute, and made as strong or mild as you like'by. the pressure of a finger upon the regulator. With it
vou can carrv the current direct to the spot affected. You can get the full current at your ankles, feet, arms, shoulders,
head or any other part of your body. It has a Special Attachment for men. We have fixed a price for it which puts it
within the reach of everyone. Its price is as low as £1 in many cases.

DOREEN’S the dearest girl I know;
The surf-men ogle her
When she arid I a-bathing go
No girl looks comelier.
Though I be as deep in love, my dear,
As you are fancy-free.
And vow by the stars above, my dear,
You merely laugh at me.
The white surf’s chant is strangely sweet,
The green waves romp and comb,
And fling my heart at her cool, pink feet
In a smother of curdling foam.
When I am as bold as the waves, my love,
’Twill be a glorious jest
To swim far away from the knaves, my love,
Your heart against my breast!
Through wind and spray we’ll swim, and far
In quiet dream-dark sea,
Explore the caves where merfolk are—
And stay to shrimps and tea.
And tarry for tea and shrimps, Doreen,
And scandal old and new.
The babes are the queerest imps, Doreen,
That ever winked at you !
And we will follow, wonder-led,
Through dazzling coral halls
Unto the amber bridal-bed,
Where no grief-shadow falls.
If you will a mermaid be, my love,
Then I’ll be a merman brown ;
We’ll see what no landsmen see, my love,
In coral caves deep down.
I’ll win for her the rarest gem
A hundred fathoms down,
While fifty nimble fingers hem
Her seaweed bridal-gown.
We’ll gossip o’er tea and shrimps, my dear,
While wedding-bells resound.
And you’ll have the quaintest imps, my dear,
For bridesmaids, I’ll be bound !

The Shepherd Kings of
Canterbury.
THEIR VENGEANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
squatters of Old Canterbury were
Pagans in their lives, regardless of what-
ever religious beliefs they professed.
Nominally, they were members of the Anglican
Church ; in reality, they were worshippers of
Astarte and that god who was notorious for the
liberties he took with the property of other
deities. But there was one matter about which
these cheerful heathens were in deadly earnest,
and in which their exclusiveness was so dour as to
constitute a sort; of religion. That was the class
of men with whom their wives might flirt. The
squatter himself might make love to the beggar-
maid—that was romantic —but no squatter’s wife
dared glance, even under her lids, at a man soci-
ally her inferior. That was the unwritten law of
the wool barons, and from wind-swept Rakaia to
the banks of the wild Waitaki there was not a
woman who did not believe that the said barons
were quite prepared to enforce that law with rope
and rifle.
* * * *
It was the last day of tournament week at Tara-
haoa. The more distant stations had not attended
because the flooded state of the Rangitata made
crossing impossible ; so only the people within
easy driving distance were present. The after-
noon wore on till the shadow of the great holly
hedge that was the delight of Tarahaoa station,
and the envy of all Canterbury, fell across the
tennis lawn. Between the high tree-tops, across
thespurof Mount Tarahaoa, great shaftsof sunlight
streamed into the upper sky from behind the blue
and silver heights of Mount Somers. The tennis
stopped short. Bells rang, servants hurried about
affixing wraps and cloaks, and then, one after
another, the splendid equipages of the wool
queens came trotting round the sweeping car-
riage drive that led from the stables to the
entrance hall of the homestead. There were
some splendid horses in old Canterbury, and as
that crowd of lovely women drove away, disap-
pearing between the rowan trees, all aflame with
bright red berries, they Wfere indeed beautiful to
see.
“Note my new coachman,” said Mr 3. Win-
stone, of Lyonesse station, drawing her magni-
ficent furs closer around her, as through the
chill autumn air came a magnificent pair of
dark bays, which the picturesque coachman
handled with splendid skill. He had the
throat of Apollo Belvidere, and as he swung the
horses round, the admiring ladies noticed that it
was the profile of Nero that was silhouetted
against the amethyst sky. Altogether it was a
most classic face, but it was a draught of beer in
the middle of a magnum of champagne to learn
that this monarchial figure was distinguished by
the name of “ Long Harry.”
“A most noble-looking animal, indeed—sets off
your horses beautifully,” said Mrs. Greville, of
The Wilderness, as the landau stopped at the
verandah steps. Mrs. Winstone glanced at the
classic coachman admiringly, looked round the
waiting ladies triumphantly, and then stepped in.
Her companion, Miss Hawkins, followed, and
spread the rugs around her. the door clicked and
the landau moved off. When the last carriage
had rolled away into silence, Squatter St. George
turned to his wife and remarked :
“Egad, I wouldn’t have that handsome brute
about the place, my dear.”
“ Why ?” laughed his wife.
“ Well, the maids would be sure to fight over him
—start poisoning one another about him, don’t
you know, and all that sort of thing ; and, egad,
WE might get poisoned in the unpleasantness.”
“Well, it isn’t the maids who are likely to get
poisoned over him at Lyonesse,” laughed the tall,
brown-eyed lady.
“ Eh, what ? Now, my love, what scandal have
you been raking out ? You’re a wonderful woman,
my dear. Marvellous how you find things out.”
His wife laughed—this intense and genuine
admiration of her husband for her cleverness as an
amateur detective pleased her better than any-
thing else in the world.
She linked her arm in his and strolled into the
drawing-room, where a fire of bright-burning,
black pine logs crackled cheerfully. Standing
there in the ruddy firelight, her hand on her hus-
band’s shoulder, she lifted up a pair of red lips to
his capacious purple ear, and murmured:
“ Margaret Winstone’s madly in love with her
coachman, and Muriel Hawkins is almost as madly
in love with Reginald Winstone. There will be a
lovely complication there, presently, and if Muriel
plays her cards properly she will end up as Lady
of Lyonesse.”
Squatter St. George dropped his wife’s arm
and stole silently to the door, which he opened
suddenly. He found no one there. When he
came back he spoke in a whisper, with something
of fear behind it.
“ My dear, don’t breathe of such a thing unless
we’re alone in the middle of a naked plain.
They’d hang that unfortunate coachman as sure
as he’s good-looking. They’d hang him on bare
suspicion, and throw his body into the Rangitata.
For God’s sake, my dear, don’t set that whisper
going.”
“ Well, I don’t think Long Harry would submit
quietly to the hanging process, and he might find
unexpected support in many quarters. In fact,
there might be a revolution, my dear. If a woman
falls in love with her coachman, what on earth is
her coachman to do? He’ll be hanged either
way.”
* * * *
A veil of mist came creeping down the purple
ridges of Mount Tarahaoa, and the last bat of
autumn was wheeling through the twilight.
Mrs. St. George walked up and down her veran-
dah in feverish excitement, straining her ears for
the sound of hoofs. Suddenly she heard it. Then
out of the gloom came the indistinct form of St.
George between the rowan trees. He stopped a
moment to gaze upon the cheerful glow from the
windows of that lovely old home. Then he saw
his fur-clad wife rushing across the wet grass to
meet him. This sudden abandonment of dignity
astonished the squatter so that he automatically
dismounted, and caught her in his arms.
“My dear, it has come. She has been out
gathering ferns with him —ferns and moss for a
new conservatory. And Winstone’s found her
letters, or something—but that doesn’t matter.
They’ve gone across to Underwood to get him, to
hang him, dear—to hang him.”
St. George smote his horse on the flank with
his open hand, and the animal started for the
stables with a snort. Then the wool baron
scratched his head, and thought hard.
“Any chance of saving him, do you think ?”
“Yes, yes; at least, we must try. You see,
dear, they’re not at Underwood —they’re over at
the river-bed, at Joan Heatherbelle’s post, gather-
ing moss. They will come back by the Mount Reel-
road. Couldn’t you intercept them, and warn
him ? Bring her here to hide —only the servants
mustn’t know.”
“Well, here’s Roland,” said the squatter, as
the youth rode up the drive.
“Well, tell him what to do, and I’ll go back
and have some preparations made for her comfort.
I’ll put her in the room beyond the skull,” said
Mrs. St. George, starting to run lightly across the
wet grass.
A wisp of moon hung over the tops of the
giant pines, and showed the outline of the bridge
across the ravine glimmering in ghostly uncer-
tainty. The sound of hoofs, the noise of wheels
told Roland that he was in time. Still, it might
not be them, and he didn’t want anyone else to
see him in that locality : There were possibilities
about this unpleasantness that the wary young
squatter did not like. So he drew back under
the shadow of a fern tree that hung from a bank.
The carriage rolled slowly by. Mrs. Winstone
was on the box with the coachman. Her dark,
gypsy-like hair was blowing free from under her
cloth hat, and she was laughing gleefully. As
they disappeared round the curving road Roland
came out from his hiding place and galloped after
them. Mrs. Winstone’s hands flew up to her hair
and disordered furs as he drew alongside.
“Good evening, Tarahaoa,” she said with all
the dignity she could muster.
“ Stop, for God’s sake. I want to talk.”
“What’s the matter, Mr. St. George?” said
the coachman, slackening speed without pulling
up.
“ Will you stop and listen to me? It is most
important.”
“ This is very extraordinary,” said Mrs. Win-
stone, in a tone of vexation, as the waggonette
stopped.
“It will be downright unpleasant if your driver
meets your husband and his gang returning from
a wild-goose chase. Someone has sent them to
Underwood after you,” snarled young St. George.
“ What do you mean —how dare you, Roland ? ”
“ What will happen, Mr. Roland ? ” said Harry,
with intense interest.
“They’ll string you up to the nearest tree,
Harry. They claim to have discovered that you
and Mrs. Winstone are more to one another than
employer and employee, and they’re going to
wipe it out in blood.”
“ Who are ‘ they ’ ? ”
“ Your husband and some half-dozen others.
What are you going to do about it ? ”
“Get off the road first thing, just in case they
come this way,” said the intensely practical
Harry, suiting the action to the word, and driving
over a log into a wilderness of bracken that hid
horses and waggonette.
“Bully for you !” chuckled Roland St. George.
“Now, let’s hold a council of war. My father
doesn’t want to see any murder done, and the
only way to prevent it is for you, Harry, to get
across the Waitaki, away down among the miners
and Scotchmen. The nearest point of the Wai-
taki is 60 miles from here as the bird flies. Take
my horse and saddle and start right away. I’ll
look after Mrs. Winstone. I’ll turn her neddies
out to find their own way home, and take her
through the bush on foot to our place, where she
will be quite safe.”
“ Can you guarantee that ? My own inclination
is to stay here and fight it out.”
“That’s absurd—they are armed !”
“So am I,” said the coachman, producing a
long and deadly-looking revolver.
Roland bent forward and examined it closely,
without offering to take it.
“Your possession of that thing convinces me
that if you and the gentlemen meet someone will
certainly get hurt. I’m afraid you have no respect
for those whom it has pleased God to place in
position over you ! ” said the young squatter
scoffingly.
Mrs. Winstone was plucking every scrap of
jewellery from her fingers, ears and dress—her
ruby ear-studs, her rings, two gemmed brooches,
a gold watch, a gold chain, and a few other
trinkets.
“Give me a leaf from your pocket book,
Roland,” she said.
“ Time’s valuable,” said the youth significantly,

UNEXCELLED FOR
LUNGS, THROAT & CHEST.
V&7ITH the arrival of Winter, Peps are
* * indispensable to the weak=chested
and all those subject to bronchial or
throat troubles.
There are very vital reasons for the success
of Peps. The medicine is an original and
most valuable remedy—entirely distinct from
old-fashioned “ cough -cures ” and “lung-
tonics” which being in liquid form are merely
swallowed into the stomach and therefore
cannot touch the real seat of lung and chest
trouble, only effecting temporary “benefit”
by drugging the system.
The Peps way is to do without opium and
such dangerous drugs and instead depend upon
a certain breathe-able medicine which has been
proved the most effective in coughing and breathing
ailments. This medicine, in handy tablet shape, is
removed from its preserving silver wrapping, placed
on the tongue and allowed slowly to dissolve. Rich
medicinal fumes areithen released and with absolute
ease may be breathed in until their healineinfluence

is
carried to the innermost recesses of the lungs and chest.
Thus soreness in the chest is at once alleviated, harmful
germs lodging in the chest are destroyed: phlegm is loosened
from the throat, and that old-standing cough is removed.
The chronic bronchial sufferer by taking a Pep regularly as the
season advances need no longer stand in dread of an annual attack.
To those in fear of the changeable weather, and
for all who work amid lung-chilling surroundings
or impure air, a box of Peps is a veritable boon and
chest-preserver. Do not wait for that old cough
to arrive and make further inroads on your vitality.
Keep a supply of Peps always by you.

WANTED
Every Reader of “The Bulletin ” interested
in Nerve Affections or Brain Exhaustion
(Neurasthenia) to know that Two Valuable
Treatises on “The Brain and Nerves,” as
well as a Trial Supply of ANTINEURASTHIN,
Neurasthenia's only antidote, will be sent
upon application .
Sufferers are now given the opportunity of
learning why the newly-discovered “ Anti-
neurasthin.” treatment never fails.
44 Antineurasthin” succeeds where doctors
and allothermethods
have failed, because
it FEEDS the nerve
and brain tissues. It
is to the brain and
nerves what ordinary
food is to the body.
Just as drugs and
medicines are in-
capable of feeding
the body, so are they
powerless to streng-
then nerves and
brain.
4 4 Antineurasthin ”
is a brain and nerve
food—the only food
yet discovered that
directly feeds the
nerve and brain.
90 per cent, of
44 Antineurasthin” is
used up by the brain
and nerves —and by
the brain and nerves
only. Only 15 per
cent, of ordinary
food is actually used
up in the body, about
85 per cent, being
waste matter.
The treatises al-
ready referred to
contain information which every sufferer
should know—in fact, must know, if he (or
she) desires to recover nerve and brain health
and power.
The trial supply of “ Antineurasthin ’’ itself
is amply sufficient to demonstrate that the
nerves only need to be fed with it to quickly
recover their strength and power.
It is op en to
readers to discover
for themselves how
quickly “Anti-
neurasthin” changes
nerve weakness to
nerve comfort and
power. With the
restoration of nerve
strength the brain, as
the chief centre of
the nervous system,
becomes str o n ger
and more able to
fulfil its manifold
duties. Nerve sen-
sitiveness and mental
depression—and that
lack of energy which
is its physically ex-
pressed counterpart
—fades into nothing-
ness. The sum of
strength imparted by
“ Antineurasthin”—
the brain and nerve
food—banishes the
clouds from mind and
body alike, and your
whole being will
rejoice in the joyous
sensation of healthy
life.
Forms of application for the two treatises, with
trial supply, should be forwarded to the wholesale
distributor for Australasia, H. A. GODDARD,
Eagle Street, Brisbane, with eightpence in stamps
or postal note.

turning away and commencing to undo the car-
riage horses. Harry led Roland’s horse round the
corner of the bracken, and Mrs. Winstone fol-
lowed him. In a few minutes she crept back,
weeping softly.
“He wouldn’t take it, after all! ” she said, piti-
fully, showing her jewellery heaped together in
her handkerchief.
“By Jove, I believe the fellow’s half a gentle-
man !” said Roland, admiringly.
“He’s a hero—and the best-looking man in
Canterbury, Do you think he will get away?”
sobbed Mrs. Winstone.
As she spoke the roar of a gun reverberated
through the silent arches of the pines, and rolled
away up among the ravines and gorges of Mount
Tarahaoa. Mrs. Winstone clung to the youth in
a paroxysm of terror.
“Oh, Roland, they have killed him! Let us
go and try and save his life. Never mind any-
thing else. Let us go, I say.”
“Time we left here,” said the squatter youth,
gripping her by the arm and gliding through the
bracken with a silent, wriggly motion. At the
roadside he paused, and then flitted across it into
the obscurity on the other side. Well for them
he had spent his youth roaming through those
dense thickets, where supplejack and lawyer vine
blocked and tugged them back. In less than an
hour they emerged where they could see the
kitchen lights of the homestead. Thence he led
the tired woman along hedges, round three sides
of a paddock to the plantation fence, lifted her
over, dragged her through a hazel thicket on to
the tennis lawn, and through the conservatory to
his mother’s drawing-room. When the servants
were all at the other side of the house she escaped
up the stairs to the big gable room that was to be
her hiding-place from the fury of outraged
squatterdom.
* * • *
Margaret Winstone lay awake in the gable room
watching the tracery made on the wall by the top
of the rowan tree, in which the white peacocks
roosted. The tick, tick of the old-fashioned'weight
clock in the passage outside her door seemed
unusually loud. Through the open window came
the distant, faint, musical roar of the Rangitata
thundering over its boulders. Her thoughts were
with the man who had fled away to the wild
Waitaki with his life in his hand, hunted like a
wild beast by the vengeful wool barons. She was
consumed with anxiety. Mrs. St. George had
been very kind, but there was an aloofness, which
the gypsy-haired woman had supposed to arise
from the fact that she was no longer regarded as
respectable. There was a steely look in the big,
lustrous orbs of the lady of Tarahaoa. Mrs.
Winston was half inclined to leave her refuge and
await her fate, whatever it might be, in her own
home.
Through the open window came the sound of
a horse galloping up the drive. The rider must
bo the bearer of news. She sprang from' the bed
and looked out of the window. It was Roland St.
George. She heard him burst into the house and
hurry to his mother’s room. His father was at
the out-station.
A few minutes later there came a faint knock at
her own door. She was already in her wrapper.
She hurried into the little sitting-room Mrs. St.
George had fixed up for her use. Roland St.
George took her hand sympathetically.
“I have bad news,” he said, very softly.
Which of them is hurt ? ” she inquired shortly.
“ Both of them. Lyonesse is down with a
revolver bullet through his lungs.”
“ May he die ! ” she hissed savagely.
“ He is almost certain to do so.”
“ Tell me all about it—where is Harry? ”
“Let nie begin at the first. After he left us
that night he rode straight over to your place and
took Black Sultan out of the stable.
“Riding down the carriage-drive they caught
sight of him, and hunted him to the Orari River.
It was running a banker. He never hesitated,
but plunged right in. When they got to the top
of the northern terrace they caught a glimpse of
him disappearing over the edge of the southern.
They rode down river two miles for a safe ford.”
“ The cowards ! Well, what then ? Where did
he get away to ? ”
“He didn’t get away at all. He might have
been heading for a dozen places, but some devil’s
intuition told them he was making for the
Waitaki, above Duntroon. For three days he
gave them a terrific chase. He kept on changing
horses—any horse at all, you know, so long as it
was a good one, and he seemed to be able to pick
those out a long way off. He took a beautiful
stallion from Silverburn, and old Bernard came
along and joined in the chase with his blood-
hounds. But he kept right in front down to the
Waitaki.
“That awful river! No bridges, no boats—
only rolling waves of icy water. It was a death-
trap. He had struck it at the wrong place. He
rode down the ravine, half galloping, half swim-
ming. Behind him the deep bay of Bernard’s
bloodhounds told they had lost the scent; the
running water had baffled the brutes. But the
squatters guessed he had gone down the river, as
the ferry was miles below, and started after him
at top speed. Then the dogs got the scent once
more, and ran with their noses on the ground.
“They caught sight of him scrambling up aridge
of loose shingle in which his horse could hardly
get a foothold. But he struggled to the top, and,
riding behind a mass of rock, faced round. They
shouted to him to give himself up. He asked for
what. Silverburn roared out something about
horse-stealing. He warned them that he was
armed, and would not surrender. Bernard read
out a warrant for his arrest, and in the middle of
it Winstone fired. He missed. Harry didn’t,
although it was such a long shot, and Winstone
dropned.
“ They all let fly together, and some ricochet-
ting bullet must have struck him, for he suddenly
leaned over and let go every chamber of his re-
volver. Then he dragged himself on to his horse
with evident pain, and plunging down the bank
urged the horse into the water. A cloud passed
over the moon, and when they reached the top of
the rock he had disappeared. They never saw
him again, but a little later they found his horse
drowned, lying on the edge of a little shingle
ridge that rose out of the water.”
“ ’JThen you do not know if he is dead or alive.”
“I don’t know ! But I have not the slightest
doubt he is dead. No man could live in that
stream once he had lost liis horse.”
“ Why did you tell him to make for the horrible
.place ? ”
v “It was his only chance, but he kept too far to
the west, and struck it too high up. I did not
know he would be foolish enough to go back to
Lyonesse to get another horse. He could have
got away safely enough had he stuck to mine.
Now I’m going to the out-station to let my father
know. Good-night ! ”
* * * *
Now that Harry was dead nothing mattered.
She felt that she must get sympathy. So she
slipped on stockings and shoes and stole down-
stairs to Mrs. St. George’s room. She found that
lady with liar face buried in pillows. As site
entered Mrs. St. George looked up, and Mrs.
Winstone started back at the change in her face,
It was convulsed with rage. She sprang from her
bed, and Seizing Mrs. Winstone by the arm threw
her out into the passage.
“ Out of my house, you blunderer ! I’d kill you
now only you might meet him in the next woi d.”
Mrs. Winstone arose very quietly, and faced the
angry woman in the nightdress :
“ Listen to me. You wrong me and you wrong
that dead man. Our relations were merely those
of friendship. He understood moss and fe,ns as
no one I have ever met understood them, j was
indiscreet; and that night that Roland met i s on
the Mount Peel road and told us what had hap-
pened, I saw that explanations were useless, and
his only safety lay in flight. We were prejudgeu 1
I repeat, my relations with Henry Dunstan were
perfectly innocent.”
“ Well, mine were not. I know all about you.
But although he never had one spark of feeling
for you, you brought about his death. But for
you he might have been here to-night. Now he
is lying exposed on some horrible shingle reach of
that infernal Waitaki. Get out of my house, you
—you murderess ! ” . . .
And the crushed, but innocent, woman gathered
her wrapper round her, and, fleeing forth into the
misty moonlight, wandered through fields of
clover, mile upon mile, till the square-roofed home
that was being prepared for her mortally wounded
husband’s return rose up before her, and the
scared Miss Hawkins came down and silently let
her in.
O. A. JEFFRIES.
The Jawbone Volunteers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Speaking’ at the anniversary smoke night of the Koronir
Vale branch, A.N.A., Mr. D. Mackinnon, M.L.A., said
that he was not in favor of spending much money in con-
nection with local defence. He was quite prepared to
trust that Providence would allow us to work out our
destiny peacefully.— Melbourne Age.
And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and ... slew a
thousand men therewith.— Judges xv., 15.
IVTO need to launch the battleships, no need
to drill and arm ;
' Mackinnon, with persuasive lips, would
deprecate alarm;
The land in sloth and lethargy may waste the
precious days—
All’s well with Time and Destiny, so D. Mac-
kinnon says !
As from some Pisgah-eminence this Moses doth
descry
The guardian hoof of Providence—but keep your
Jawbone dry !
Let droves of legislator folk conduct us down the
years;
They’ll guard us from the lightning stroke—the
Jawbone Volunteers!
Loud jeers !
At danger’s call they’ll save us all—the Jawbone
Volunteers !
’Tis well to know that we may sleep, whilst
marching to and fro
The Jawbone captains sternly keep their eyes
upon the foe !
How thankful should Australia be—behold ! the
A.N.A.
Will pulverise the enemy with its almighty bray !
Like him who smoke the Philistines, as gaping
Judah saw,
’Twill trample down the foeman’s lines, armed
with its fatal Jaw !
At Wayback’s braneh-corroboree, amidst the
members’ cheers,
Mackinnon hymns their bravery—the Jawbone
Volunteers!
Who fears ?
Let trouble come. They’ll fight, by gum !—the
Jawbone Volunteers !
So let us hang our signboard out, that all the
world may see
A land whose Jawbone, strong and stout, defieth
destiny !
Let older lands in silent awe observe our arma-
ment —
Our M.L.A. whose flapping jaw pervades the
continent ;
Let others put their faith in steel, in ships and
shotted guns;
But Jaw protects the Commonweal—there’s Han-
sard piled in tons !
The soldier-men of Xenophon, with silver-flashing
spears,
Marched o’er the wreck of Babylon—behold our
Volunteers !
Wild cheers !
They trust too much who trust in such—the Jaw-
bone Volunteers !
When Alexander at the gate demanded Athens’
keys,
Did Jawbones save the threatened State?—Ask
dead Demosthenes !
When ’neath the battle-axes’ blows Mahomet’s
legions fell,
Did Blather aid the Christians’ foes? —Inquire of
C. Martel !
When Paris heard the Germans tramp, with
Moltke in the van,
Did Jaw protect their leaguered camp ?—See
Gravelotte and Sedan !
The world is crammed with Talkers’ graves—His-
torians, with sneers,
Tell how they met the fate of slaves—the Jaw-
bone Volunteers !
Time leers !
Fate laid them low in grief and woe—the Jaw-
bone Volunteers !
The years are stacked with evidence that towers
to the skies;
The land that trusts in eloquence—that land most
surely dies !
The old Egyptians by the Nile made Jaw their
early aim—
They ceased to blather by the mile when fierce
invaders came !
Beneath the Persian’s grinding heel for dreary
centuries
They groaned unto their gods for steel and fight-
ing Raineses !
The Talkers do not signify when flaming War
appears;
Their scattered bones lie stark and dry—the Jaw-
bone Volunteers !
Long years
They’ll lie forgotten in their graves—our Jawbone
Volunteers !
VICTORIA.

THE REPUTATION OF
B^CHAM'S
PIUS
Every great thing has usually a small beginning—no matter to what degree
of maturity or excellence it ultimately attains. Even BEECHAM’S PILLS,
now so universally appreciated, had a reputation that was necessarily at
First Local
But their merits were quickly recognised. Their popularity grew ; the sales
greatly increased, and ere long the demand revealed that the reputation was
Then National
Good news travels fast and rapidly circulates. 1 Cured and delighted users
talked about the famous Pills, and the result was that the reputation
continued to spread in all directions and is
Now World-Wide
All this is entirely due to the merits of the medicine. Scientifically prepared
from certain vegetable sources of remarkable medicinal value, they could
scarcely fail to achieve the results that have secured their universal fame.
Acting primarily on the organs of digestion they strengthen the stomach,
cleanse the liver, stimulate the kidneys, and regulate the bowels. They
also exercise great influence in purifying the blood and giving tone to the
nervous system. These ■ are some of the reasons why the reputation
of Beecham’s Pills
CAN NEVER BE SHAKEN.
