CENTRE OF BRITAIN'S
RADIO NETWORK,
BROADCASTING HOUSE
/"\NE of the finest examples of modern
architecture in London is Broadcast-
ing House, headquarters of the British
Broadcasting Corporation, which stands
like a ship in Langham Place, near
Oxford Circus. This impressive building
was designed by Val Myer in the shape
of a massive oval, covering an area of
20,000 square feet, and was built in 1931.
Two years later the Corporation moved
there from Savoy Hill, where it was first
established under the famous call signal
2LO.
The building relies for its appearance
on the skilful grouping of masses of
stone rather than on ornament. The little
ornament it has to relieve its dignified
splendour is a sculptured group of Ariel
and Prospero by Eric Gill, which appears
over the main doorway. In order to
deaden outer sound no steel was used in
the building of the tower, where the
studios are protected by immensely thick
walls. The largest room in the tower is
the concert hall, which occupies three
floors in depth, and its walls are decorated
by friezes depicting scenes suggestive of
dancing, poetry and the harvest. The
Council Chamber is panelled in light
Tasmanian oak, and its long tables are
built of walnut from Queensland. The
music library, with more than 50,000
pieces of music for singers, orchestras and
military bands, is perhaps the biggest in
the world.
During the Second World War the
8.8. C. broadcast in forty-six different
languages, and was a priority target for
enemy bombers. The building received
three’direct hits, but broadcasting was
maintained throughout these attacks, and
there was no interruption of programmes.
The 8.8. C. is free from commercial
broadcasting, and for listeners in Britain
it transmits three main programmes—
the Home Service, the Light Programme
and the Third Programme. In addition
to these domestic services and television,
the 8.8. C. broadcasts to listeners overseas
in English and over forty foreign
languages.

JEFFERSON HOGG.
The life of Jefferson Hogg by
Winifred Scott (Cape) is an example of
how effectual an “ineffectual angel” like
Shelley can be at blasting an old English
oak.
Hogg came of a well-to-do legal family
with a fine house at Norton, near
Durham; he became Shelley’s close
friend at Oxford, and when Shelley was
expelled from Oxford because of his
pamphlet on “The Necessity for
Atheism,” Hogg protested on his friend’s
behalf, and was expelled with him.
This pattern of taking after Shelley
persisted; Shelley and his 16-year-
old bride Harriet found his company
pleasing during a holiday; they moved
with him to York, where he had to work
at law, and there, while Shelley was off
meeting the intellectual Elizabeth
Kitchener, of Cuckfield, Hogg fell hard
for Harriet. Shocked, intrigued and
delighted, Harriet might have gone the
whole distance but for her sister Eliza’s
production of the moral code. Harriet
was persuaded to complain to Shelley.
Again, but for Eliza, the matter might
have been overlooked.
[Shelley’s] own personal modesty and
excessive belief in Hogg’s fascination and
powers of oratory caused him astonishment
at her resistance. Any girl, he thought,
must see that Hogg was the better man.
At last Shelley was brought to see that
there were standards by which Hogg’s
conduct was unsuitable ; he remonstrated,
referred the matter to literary analysis ;
and fled with the two women ; and for
two months both parties relieved their
feelings in a grand opera of passionate
and excited correspondence.
This was when Hogg was 19. In
London, aged 22, now the author of a
novel, Alexy Haimatoff, Hogg found
himself called upon to console Shelley’s
new wife, Mary (Godwin), while Shelley
was out with Claire, her sister. The new,
17-year-old Mrs. Shelley made the
advances in writing :
.... we need not be prudent now, for I
will try to make you happy and you say
it is in my power.
And to this was added Shelley’s appro-
bation, in writing:
My dear friend, Mary wished to speak
with you alone, for which purpose I have
gone out and removed Claire.
If you should return before this evening
and are at leisure I need not direct your
steps.
Affectionately yours.
However, their view of the situation
hardly met Hogg’s when Mary wrote:
....hut our still greater happiness will be
in Shelley—l who love him so tenderly and
entirely, whose life hangs on the beam of
his eye, and whose soul is entirely wrapped
up in him—you who have so sincere a
friendship for him to make him happy —
no, we need not try to do that, for every-
thing we do will make him that without
exertion, but to see him so—to see his
love, his tenderness —dear, dearest Alexy,
these are joys that fill your heart to burst-
ing and draw tears more delicious than the
smiles of love from your eyes.
Hogg was very partial to Shelley, but
his passion for Shelley’s wife could
hardly be expected to survive that
interpretation of it.
Almost ten years later, Hogg took over
Shelley’s last inspiration, a posthumous
love. It seems that Jane Williams was
never Shelley’s mistress, but the con-
tented wife of Edward Ellerker Williams,
and mother of a son and daughter. But
it was to her that Shelley’s most exquisite
song was dedicated —“To Jane” —she
reminded him of those regions:
Where music and moonlight and feeling
Are one.
It was her husband who was drowned
with Shelley; and on her return to
London, Hogg met her, fell in love with
her, and, after she had sent him on a
Continental tour to discover whether
they both meant it, was accepted. They
could not marry, since she had married
and left an officer in India to go with
the late Edward Williams ; and the Indian
soldier was still alive ; thus Hogg had to
face the family displeasure, which
involved the refusal of his mother and
sister to meet Jane, and also to face the
loss of real advancement in the law —
ail of which he seems to have done with
equanimity: it must have seemed to him
comparatively simple after having to deal
with the complications with which
Shelley, alive, had entangled his earlier
loves.
However, Mary, Shelley’s widow,
seems to have done what she could to
break Jane away from him, perhaps for
old-time’s sake, but mainly because she
felt that protective instinct towards Jane
with which so many a strong character
props itself up against the emptiness of
life. And later, in his sixties, when he
had decided to expand some earlier
reminiscences of Shelley into a full-scale
biography, the Shelleys reached out for
him again.
Shelley’s son, Sir Bercy, and his wife
Wrennie suggested the biography to him,
and, at the end of his life, he saw a
chance of making his mark in literature.
As Miss Scott is not backward in point-
ing out, it is hard for us, conditioned by
almost a hundred years of Arnold’s
“beautiful but ineffectual angel,” to credit
that Shelley’s first official biographer
should write to the already-adoring
family: “our book must be amusing.”
Hogg was an ironist; he was a son of
the 18th century; his idea, says Miss
Scott, was that the book should not be
sentimental or elegiac:
His Shelley was to be no drowned figure
in marble. To him .Shelley could never be
a human wreck cast upon the shore, nor
could he be the “divine poet” of a pious
myth; he was dear Bysshe.
For example, from the preface:
Shelley was great as a poet —divine,
indeed ; great as a philosopher, as a
moralist, as a scholar, as a complete and
finished gentleman, great in every respect
as a man; but he was most conspicuously
great in that particular excellence which in
all ages and in all nations has been
invariably the characteristic distinction of
the greatest of mankind —he was pre-
eminently a lady’s man.
The Shelleys let him get as far as two
volumes ; then wrote him a letter as a
result of which he sent back all the papers
they had given him. A third, completed
volume, and the fourth, partly written,
have disappeared.
Thus Hogg’s fame rests upon a bio-
graphy known only to scholars —and
evidently much respected by them ; on
his Two Hundred and Nine Days on the
Continent, which may have been read
by 20 people alive now; on his ironic,
amusing, learned, and tendentious con-
tributions to the Encyclopaedia Britannica
of 1842 on the subjects of “Alphabet”
and “Antiquity,” which were superseded
in later editions; on his writings in the
“Edinburgh Review” on such subjects as
Italian Fainting, Drama, Bapyri, Ancient
Tachygraphy, Falimpsests, Etruscan
History and Antiquities, Byzantine and
Roman Historians, etc., which were un-
signed ; on his essays on Longus, Apuleius
and the Athenian Sophists in “The
Liberal,” chiefly famous for having first
printed Byron’s “Vision of Judgment” ;
and on his political pamphlet, Reports on
Certain Boroughs, the product of his
labors as a Royal Commissioner (one of
20) inquiring into the working of town
corporations, which, although he was con-
sidered the commission’s most conser-
vative member, is “referred to constantly
in the monumental work” of the Fabian
Socialist Webbs.
The commissionership was his highest
honor in his profession ; the rest of his
professional life seems to have been spent
as a barrister on circuit, a professorship
in the newly-established University of
London having fallen through ; what time
he did not devote to law he spent in be-
coming almost incredibly learned. Miss
Scott has presented him very well, a
strong man, hard to know, well able to
take knocks and to withstand the world’s
disapproval, owing much, both of fame
and misfortune, to a poet on whose life
he wrote himself;
A poet is a maker, but he is likewise a
marrer. I have often wondered and asked
myself, and amongst the rest my friend,
how many poets the world could bear at
once, all simultaneously energising destruc-
tively?
Home Towns.
When England was at the threshold
and morning of her world power, the
Elizabethans and Jacobeans felt that all
would soon be over, and spoke of “this
fading part of time” —it is reassuring to
remember this when one reads the first
words of the preface to The English Past,
by A. L. Row?® (MacMillan): “Now
that the great dt ys of England are per-
haps over”....
In this spirit, which prefaces so many
new English books, Mr. Rowse visits
some ten English scenes, and meditates
upon the writers who lived there: All
Souls’ College, Oxford, of which he is a
Fellow (“So there is—though I am sure
I ought not to say it —a certain cachet
attached to becoming a Fellow of All
Souls”); Bisham, home of the Ho by
family, which produced the translator of
The Courtier, and was held together by
the remarkable old Lady Russell;
Hillesden, the country of the Dentons,
which produced Dr. Denton, a Restora-
tion writer much written-to, his tracts and
correspondence being of great value to
such social historians as Dr. Rowse;
Horton, the original of the landscapes in
Milton’s earlier poems, and Forest Hill,
the home of his father-in-law, and the
bother he had with his mother-in-law
over the mortgage on it; the rectory at
Letcombe, where Swift collected his
scattered wits and received an imprudent
visit from Vanessa in 1714 just before his
party, the Tories, went out of power for
a hundred years; Haworth Barsonage,
the home of the Brontes ; morning service
in the church at Stinsford, where Hardy’s
mother first saw his father ; and the home
he built at Max Gate, now inhabited by
an old lady who said “/ don’t like
Thomas Hardy. Miserable old man, I
call him. I like cheerful people.”
There is a tribute to John Buchan, and
then we come to Nottingham, down
whose streets Byron’s body was bora to
burial and D. H. Lawrence was led by his
mother to find work; and then we come
to Eastwood, Lawrence’s home town:
There was a very natural reason why he
should speak specially to me; he was then
the only writer of genius to come from my
own class, the working people, and his
books—especially his masterpiece, Sons and
Lovers —were the only books that described
the life of the people from the inside, with
absolute fidelity and conviction, and at the
same time transfused it with imagination
and poetry, made a work of art of it. I
was a predestined victim: my nerves
vibrated in sympathy with his.
To go back to Lawrence’s home in this
way is a master-stroke of criticism,
though, says Mr. Rouse:
My object is not literary criticism —there
is far too much criticism in contemporary
writing: a fungoid growth smothering and
devitalising the creature... .My ajm is to
see the people through the places where
they lived or which their lives touched, and
the places through them and their eyes.
But look at Eastwood:
Not at all one’s usual idea of a mining
town For one thing it .was clean, blowy,
healthy. There is still country round it,
fields and holdings and trees, and distant
views towards Ilkeston and Ripley, places
mentioned in the novels There was the
rawness and rudeness about the place, the
rough-edged angularity, the sharpness, the
hideousness. Everything recent and ugly
and Philistine, the chapels in evidence: a
working-class and petty-bourgeois com-
- munity. Nothing of the grace of life: no
taste, no culture, no relenting: nothing
whatever to stay the mind on or comfort
the elect soul.
How well its prophet was equipped to
speak to how many Australian com-
munities ! And how strange to think that
this scene exists in the same England as
All Souls, a College without under-
graduates, a history going back to 1438,
a roll-call of fellows from Linacre,
“father of modern medicine,” to Wren,
to Blackstone; John Evelyn, Froude,
Curzon, Chelmsford, Halifax, Buckle,
Geoffrey Dawson, Oman, Amery ; from
“Sir Antony Shirley, who perambulated
Bersia and the Levant,” to T. E.
Lawrence, “lying full out on the floor,
hour after hour, writing The Seven Pillars
of Wisdom.”
There are the bells of St. Mary’s, the
regular accompaniment to dinner in Hall
on Sundays, the chimes of New College
next door, the silvery surf of Magdalen on
mornings of May coming in waves over the
roofs. There are the great chestnuts in the
Warden’s garden, mountainous masses of
green and white blossom, rich and festooned
in the tapestry time of the year. Or there
is the scent of wallflowers stealing up in
the night from the old quadrangle, the
aromatic fragrance of Cheddar pinks from
the pavement outside the Codrington; in
autumn the secret figs ripening upon the
September walls.
South African Drama,
There has always been a tinge of
Leftist sentiment about Maxwell Ander-
son’s writing, and though he didn’t write
Alan Baton’s Cry, the Beloved Country
he must have been considerably in sym-
pathy with the novel when he dramatised
it as Lost in the Stars (Cape ; Bodley
Head), which was successfully performed
as a musical in New York.
It is orthodox from his viewpoint to
believe the rich are responsible for the
sins of the poor ; environment is every-
thing ; but though conditions in the negro
quarter of Johannesburg may well be as
distressing as Mr. Baton says they are, it
is a little difficult to swallow what seems
to be the central theme of the play, that
when a negro in Johannesburg commits
a murder it is because the white man
has dispossessed his race. Negroes in
Africa have been murdering each other,
and roasting and boiling each other,
since the dawn of time.
The play is about an old negro
preacher up the country who comes to
Johannesburg to see what his son
Absalom has been up to. Absalom has
been up to burglary ; and just about
time his old dad arrives he
the course of burglary, a white man *
has been a benefactor to the nesroL
There is a struggle between the
fathers—Absalom’s father and the fJh
of the murdered white man, who Ut"
that the negroes should be kept in th
piace. The negro wants the white father
to quash the trial against his son ( W E
he couldn t do if he wanted to>; the white
father wants justice to take its course
and so give him his revenge. Absalom I
duly hanged, but the white father realise
that grief makes all men one, and set
converted to religion and love of the
negroes just as the preacher is about to
lose all hope.
This theme, like the political com-
mentary, is sentimental: the arrogant
harsh, strictly conservative James Jarvis
of the play might conceivably melt in his
grief and spend the rest of his life doing
good deeds in negro chapels; but he
might also have very grave reservations
about consorting in grief and love with
the father of the negro who had killed
his son.
However, such a story obviously makes
for strong dramatic action, and there are
some scenes that should be extremely
effective on the stage: notably where the
preacher visits his son in prison and
learns that Absalom, having repented of
his misdeeds, intends to plead guilty;
and where the two fathers meet for the
first time and the preacher pleads with
Jarvis for Absalom’s life.
Mr. Anderson’s writing, like the
story, is of varying quality. His verse
runs to cliches such as “wings of the
morning” and “pathways of the heart,”
and there is a good deal of popular senti-
ment about paternal love and home sweet
home;
It’s not much to tell about,
It’s not much to picture out,
And the only thing special is
It’s home.
On the other hand there are some vigor
and color, possibly adopted from sources
as far apart as Christina Rossetti’s “Gob-
lin Market,” Eliot’s “Sweeney Agonistes”
and the jazz-poems of Vachel Lindsay,
when Linda, a naughty negress of the
Johannesburg streets, is singing about
Asparagus, yellow corn, black-eyed peas,
tomatoes, potatoes, beans and ruta-
bagas—
Who’ll buy
My oranges and melons?
Who’ll pay shillings for my lemons and
persimmons,
Who wants apricots and nectarines and
trimmin’s?
I haven’t got a licence, so I can undersell,
I haven’t got a licence, so I treat you well!
But most of the play is in a straight,
robust prose, with the songs patched on
to it, so that comparisons with Winter set
and the question of Maxwell Anderson’s
place in the contemporary verse-play
really do not arise. Altogether Lost in the
Stars reads like a sound job by a compe-
tent craftsman of the theatre, with not
much more to it than that. It is rather
interesting to see American writers and
audiences, with a negro problem of their
own, taking an interest in the troubles of
South Africa,
Some Penguins,
A flock of recent Penguins includes
the first of a batch of 10 murder stories
by Carter Dickson, the fourth celebrated
writer on this sanguinary subject to be
represented by 10 Penguins at one time,
and two instalments of a new series,
“The Buildings of England,” by Nikolaus
Pevsner. They are the usual excellent
Penguin productions. The first, on Corn-
wall, starts off with the statement that
that county possesses little of the highest
aesthetic quality, and then belies the state-
ment with photographs of great halls of
manor-houses with glorious carved roofs,
rood screens and church windows which
are architecturally on the same plane as
the great cathedrals, as well as humble
cotters’ homes,* which are as lovely as
a folksong.
The second, on Nottingham, says
that neither the architectural nor the
picturesque traveller would place that
county in his first dozen or so of English
counties and follows that up with a pro-
cession of stone doorways, naves and
chancels which are miracles of beauty.
The author is either a master of under-
statement or the rest of England that
escaped the Nazi bombers must be a
storehouse of unexampled riches, and it
will be a thousand years before the firm
of vignerons that decorates The
Bulletin’s front cover runs out of
subject-matter. ,■

the noble bearing of a Brisbane

for the moneyed guests whose

The late-afternoon special de-

about for automatic rifles, steel
helmets, fixed bayonets.
Only a few cockeyed icicles
painting the way for prevailing
gales. He pops ears for altitude
and relaxes. 1 am amazed to see
him living.
In Biella I knew him. I was a
battle-fevered bersagliere streak-
ing for regions untroubled by
bayonets, bullets and bomb-
blast. He helped escaped
prisoners, fallen airmen, intelli-

A clumsy little man who

She occupies lustrous lame
Abenkleid with nothing above

a smile hard as yakka. Make-up
subtle as the painted ironwork

Cobalt combs and tinsel toe-

She flaunts her longest eye-

She crams more significance into
honey-saturated welcome words

The newcomer is dazzled and
delighted. He forgets my tip.
“U /HAT’S he worth?” I
VV inquire later. As an
afterthought: “Who is he?”
“Professor of rhetorical
Romonsch,” guesses the hotel
hostess.
She provides clandestine clues
about clients. Maybe because
of my bonnie brown eyes and
innocent grace. Maybe because
of her percentage of my per-
centage.
Percentages pay where living-
costs mount without con-
comitant wage-increases.
“Probably slaves years to
spend vacations here,” I say.
“Academic types”—she gives
me a chuckle borrowed from
Rumpelstiltskin and I give it
back as an alcoholic smirk—
“are easy.”
She pensively sharpens nails
with her pocket rasp. Tonight
sometime she will ring. I shall
open the door. I shall leave it
open. The professor will be
fingering scratched face. The

academic laces skates and drifts
away. He’s had enough.
I contemplate my slug of
schnapps. One eye I’ve got half-
open on the skating scholar giv-
ing perfect examples of control
and position in the spin. Straight
out of the book. Tedious as
knitting socks. He flaunts plait-
able moustaches, fencing-wire
legs strained through tight
breekums. A hairy fairy. His
jacket needs a dryclean and his
skates are not outmoded enough
do be whalebone.
I rubberleg recklessly out for
a whirlwind workout. To
practise threes to a centre; in-
advertently collide with the
movie starlet. The skating
scholar steadies the starlet.
Magnanimously. He leaves me
prone.
“Que fais-tu la, mon cher?”
he sneers. “Acquiring edge?”
The stately starlet savors this
sparkling sally.
“Dense population, sir,” I
quip. Heavily. “No spating
skace.” 1 rub the rumples in my
rudder. Spinal column not quite
severed.
“Hundred inhabitants every
square kilometre,” he quotes.
“Ironed-out, this country would
be almost as large as France.”
“Admirable,” I creak. I try
to look at him in the eye. Man
to man. But I can’t get through
the glassware. “This country
has everything.”
“Fresh ideas we need,” the
scholar contends for the lady’s
benefit. “Too many dead
traditions.”
“More action less distrac-
tion?”
“More artists fewer crafts-
men.”
“The record is commendable,”
I soothe. “Watches, cheeses,
chocolates, head-waiters, alpine-
guides.” He eyes me quickly. I
am not smiling.
“Need commodities like syn-
thetic rubber, penicillin, peren-
nial wheat, radar, jet-propul-
sion.”
“Produced during war-time
conditions.” I am surprising
myself.
“If war is required ; why not
war?” He curls knuckles into a
bunch of jacks. Reconnoitres
my face for battlefield sites,
“No,” I say. Gently. He’s
the resolute type you never
catch wearing ski-skins. Unless
you look fast.
“You’re drowning the
orchestra,” says the screen
queen.
“Deservedly,” says the skating
scholar.
They appraise each other;
approvingly. Together they go
off unexpectedly like Sydney
beer, I watch them work
through snappy fourteen-step
routines. Blades flashing like
lights in glasses of Gletscher.
Dazzling. With plenty of
swing and edge,
‘*'"THE lady is Ida Awe,” in-
-1 forms the hotel hostess.
“Played the lead in ‘Winecarts
and Castanets.’ ”
“Married?”
“W i d o w e d. That’s her
youngster doodling on skates.”
I accost sonny with the honest
intent of a second-hand car
salesman. Clemens is his name,
he tells me.
“Your yodelling-cap matches
your socks,” I tell him.
“You’re wobbly,” he tells me.
He traces a track true as the
groove down the middle of your
skis.
His mother drifts dutifully,
beautifu'ly across the ice and
issues tissues for Clemens’s
copious proboscis. The skating
scholar scrapes in beside her.
Stippling me with ice-dust.
She’s not a modern belle, but
she still has appeal. A superb
pullover adequately pervaded
and a smile she tries hard to
subdue. Sun-honeyed skin re-
minding me of summer moon-
light filtered through clear beer.
Lapis-lazuli eyes full of Appen-
zeller skies; limpid with lucid
thought and crystal conscience.
“Hullo,” I say. Leerlessly.
“Hullo,” she says. Fearlessly.
The skating scholar smears a
sneer from ear to ear.
“Here is Clemens,” I say.
Hopeful as the Palais des
Nations.
“Do I know you?”
“I inhabit Pension la
Clairiere,” I admit. “Cheaper.”
“H’mm.”
“Drink?”
“Cafe creme, please.”
“Apfelwein,” says the skating
scholar.
IN the Stube we bask in mauve
’ glow seeping through glass-
bricks. Not quite so spacious as
the Hallenbad der Stadt Zurich.
Chandeliers smaller than swing-
ing bells in Bern Munster.
Wine-waiter circulating. Rhythm-
ranklers syncopating. Lale
Andersen emanating orches-
trated orisons for “Heimat,
deine Sterne.” I brush aside a
tear.
I display the hundred-franc
not© that waiters can never
change. But the screen queen is
inattentive. So I pull out the
lonely two-franc bit and satisfy
the fluid steward. Another
authentic business expense.
“Me,” warns Clemens. Con-
cernedly. Eyes glittering with
juvenile delinquency and
iniquitous greed. Maybe that’s
too much to get out of one
glitter. Even for me.
I find a rusty Rapp for the
saponaceous sarsaparilla
youngsters drink nowadays. I
snap out my silver pistol and
fire saccharine pellets into her
coffee. Impressive. For once
the gadget doesn’t jam. I
sacrifice cigarettes, chew over
chatter about starry nights,
paternal advice about kids.
Stuff to fill space. Like break-
fast cereal.
I run over lonely stretches of
a one-track mind gleaning ideas
to clean up the vapid prattle.
“Visit the Alps often, Mrs.
Awe?”
“Usually Bernese Oberland.
Gstaad or Lenk. Sometimes
Miirren.”
“Unfashionable spots,” I
grumble. “Why not take the
luge to Crans? No publicity in
this consumptive resort.”
“Publicity won’t admit I’m a
mother,” she says.
“Journalists buy those
stories,” I point out. Bright as
coal-dust.
“Try to sell,” says the skating
scholar, “and I’ll have your
visa re-examined.”
The lady blinks gratitude at
the skating scholar.
Clemens sucks color from his
shandygaff. I set him gyrating
before he demands another. The
skating scholar accompanies
him. They combine intricate
bladework which leaves me
crosseyed.
I linger with the lissom lady.
Inhaling fragrant lotions, con-
cealing vagrant notions, suppres-
sing flagrant motions. If I can’t
mould this into a pally dalliance

CALL TO WORK.
Parliament meets today in Canberra for
a short session, perhaps not so short as
was expected at the adjournment last
November. There is a limit set by the
desire of the Prime Minister and
others, including Westralian Senators, to
be in Fremantle by March 1 to meet the
Royal visitors.
At Parliament’s rising before Christmas
the stated purpose of the February meet-
ing was to ratify the Japanese treaty,
which demands debate. But now other
affairs have come to a head on which
Parliament and the country must have
information concerning the Government’s
course of action. One is the turmoil in
Egypt and the stage at which Australian
co-operation with British forces in that
region might, if the situation deteriorates,
be expected. The other is the
absorbing concern in the commit-
ments, made already by the Treasurer
in London or to be sought from Parlia-
ment, for united action by the British
Commonwealth to redeem the lost
capacity of the sterling area to live
within its means: in short, to increase
production and exports in the essentials
of world trade.
“Labor’s” claim that the Japanese
treaty is too “soft” and must be redrafted
never had any basis in the realities of
Power-politics, and today is farther away
from them than ever. Dr. Evatt might
as well talk about forbidding Russia or
U.S.A. to rearm as forbidding Japan, and
the “United” Nations about which he
continues to emit the stalest of plati-
tudes would not have been able to check
the Soviet-Chinese aggression in Korea
without the American-subsidised revival
of Japanese industries. The “Labor”
leader will have to come out of his
peculiar dream-world if his party means
to assert any influence whatever on the
free world’s policy in the Pacific, the
orientation of Japan’s course in friendly
collaboration, or Australia’s contribution
to the salvation of “confused and hungry”
Asian peoples, to which Dr. Evatt in his
Australia Day broadcast attached
importance.
Dr. Evatt was deputy-leader in a Gov-
ernment which through four vital post-
war years of universal shortage of goods
frittered away a priceless opportunity
offered Australia to win a high place
among the nations in production for
world market. The Chifley-Evatt Gov-
ernment lacked either the vision or the
courage to grasp that opportunity. From
many quarters, overseas and at home, it
was exhorted to make hay while the
sun shone—to jump to it while world
demand was holding out both hands, and
the industrial energy of our late enemies
was broken. They ignored advice and
plain facts alike. They appeared to
believe that U.N.O. and the Socialist
creed between them would assure the
victorious Allies against any revival of
German and Japanese trade competition
or need of hard work on any other
account. Had they not solemnly
approved a U.N.O. resolution for freedom
from want and fear?
These political mountebanks certainly
carried a great mass of easygoing
Australian electors with them. The
party’s financial wizard had the
recipe for providing easy money for
making life easy too, and propaganda
would do the rest. The Australian people
were, in fact, deluged, deafened and
demoralised with such propaganda.
“Social security”; overfull-employment
for ever; referendums to wrench a dis-
obliging Constitution this way and that,
as requisite for “liquidating” the old
social order based on the law that if a
man will not work neither shall he eat;
altering the electoral laws so that (as
Mr. Calwell hoped) the authors of this
revolution could not be ejected from
power for at least 10 years —this was the
theme on which the Chifley-Evatts were
going to make Australia great and free.
Training the country’s manhood in arms
for defence was anathema; U.N.O.
would look after that (anybody who
asked how was a “warmonger”).
Because of the demoralisation of the
community under this Socialist propa-
ganda the suddenly-perceived blaze of
Japanese industry has startled this
country exceedingly. That development,
however, is precisely what the Socialists
and their dupes were, by their behavior,
asking for. After they were routed from
office they were able to maintain
throughout 1950 and for half of 1951,
by means of obstruction in the Senate,
resistance to the present Government’s
efforts to do things which would bring
this people to their senses. That and the
tolerated propaganda against hard work
aggravated the local incidence of an
Empire-wide economic distress which now
demands drastic procedure for recovery.
Japanese trade competition is only
a feature of the problem to be
faced. The capital goods for which
this Government is seeking another
dollar loan may well come from Japan,
whose industries are rapidly becoming
embedded in the vast organisation of
American productive enterprise. Japan
is under the American-Japanese treaty in
shape to appear as that “arsenal for
democracy” in the Pacific which the
radio-converted sharers of Dr. Evatt’s
dream-world contemplated for Australia.
But there is one profitable function, now
being pressed upon Australia as an
obligation, which Japan cannot take from
us, and which America and Britain may
insist that we shall perform, namely, to
make this country a mighty food-
provider for export. There should be
no illusion on this point. White Aus-
tralia has got to do that job, and do it
enthusiastically and successfully, or
Asians will appear here to do it in place
of us.
Ministers may not talk as baldly as
this when Parliament meets. All the
same there will be some tough stuff to
take from Treasurer Fadden in line
with the new austerities in Britain.
The announcements by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in London of a further
severe cut in British imports in order that
a satisfactory export surplus shall be
achieved and of reductions in the civil
service are unmistakably the road-signs
that Australia is expected to follow.
With the dual obligations to increase pro-
duction for export and rearm against the
Soviet threat, the luxury of overfull
employment in Government departments
must be excised. • The manpower of this
generation has got to be levered out of
easy-chairs and directed somehow into
productive work.
It was written in these pages last week:
“If the countries represented at the
London conference are serious in their
announced intentions, then Australia and
Britain are in for a period of industrial
reorganisation such as has not been seen
in the last generation.” The credit
restrictions imposed late last year on
Australian business by the Menzies Gov-
ernment show now, in truth, as a facsimile
in little of wider restrictions to be applied
to and in the whole British Common-
wealth ; to Governments as well as to
the general community. If this Govern-
ment shies away from ordering
austerities like those Britain is about to
accept, it may as well abandon its own
current credit-controls (which the Prime
Minister has said definitely it will not),
and Australians can prepare for great
adversity without friends at all.
There have been union protests locally
against discharge of some hands in non-
essential industry, falsely called “unem-
ployment.” The switchover to essential
production has got to be much more
extensive. In Britain trade-union leaders
have agreed with employers tol
collaborate in such a movement, and that
it will have to be followed in Australia
also is certain. The president of the
A.C.T.U. seems to realise this. How
far is the “Labor” party from accepting
A.L.P. president Ferguson’s recently-
published views that if “Labor” were in
power it would have to follow the Gov-
ernment’s line?
REPORT ON KOREA.
(By a Bulletin writer recently returned
from Korea and Japan.)
111. Goodbye to All That,
Even before the Peace Treaty has become
operative it is clear that the occupa-
tion of Japan following her defeat has in
no way changed her nature. She remains
essentially the old Japan. It is not, of
course, true to say that she has failed to
adopt everything the Occupation authori-
ties desired her to adopt. She has met them
on all points on which it suited her to
meet them. She has grabbed those ideas
which have seemed useful to her just as
readily as she has grabbed the patterns
of the Ronson cigarette-lighter and the
Zeiss-Ikon camera. She has also grabbed
out of the Western conceptions of democ-
racy anything that looked logical to her.
But everything else that the Occupation
has imposed on her has gone, or is going,
the way of the sign which renamed Hibiya
Park in the centre of Tokyo as Doolittle
Park,
Today there is a cynical Western atti-
tude in Tokyo to the Japanese com-
pliances of the Occupation period, and a
tendency to ask: “Who wouldn’t be
docile while somebody was giving him
a few billion dollars in occupation money
and otherwise?”
The Japanese point of view, it seems,
has been considerably misunderstood. As
a people they have no sense of war guilt.
The few Japanese with whom I had a
chance to talk on this recent visit had
exactly the same outlook as the more
numerous contacts of 1948.
When a Japanese hears complaints
about a little slapping or water-torture of
prisoners-of-war he appears to be politely
nonplussed, since this is all in the day’s
work in Japanese military life. But
though the unnatural squeamishness of
the European seems to puzzle him, this
does not mean that he is not sorry for
having offended against his conquerors’
canons of polite behavior and willing to
accede to the necessity for a practical
apology in the shape of broken necks for
Tojo and Yamashita.
Japan has no sentimental or moral
qualms about her attack on Pearl Har-
bor. She merely regards it as a motor-
mechanic might regard his own action in
putting his hand on a hot engine-cylinder.
In precipitating war in the Pacific she
hurt herself, and is not anxious to repeat
the mistake. At the same time it is only
a mistake ; the result is a healable injury.
There never was a more erroneous con-
ception than that the war will make any
permanent mark on essential Japan
deeper than a scar. One old Japanese
summed the position up by saying:
“Japanese history is a highway 2500 years
long so far. Sometimes as you walk on
along a road you become incautious, and
put your foot in a puddle. That makes
you careful.”
And all the indications are that Japan
intends to be careful at this juncture, but
at the same time is not ashamed. Indeed,
the Japanese people seem by their Press
and general attitude to be rather proud
that, having had their cities razed, their
mercantile marine destroyed, their indus-
tries levelled to the ground, their air-
power blotted out of the skies, they
are, only five years after surrender, in a
position to challenge the world indus-
trially and to determine, to a large extent,
the terms on which they intend to live in
the future.
Anybody who has had past delusions
of being able to dictate the domestic
course of Japan permanently can now
abandon them, the more so because in
the present state and orientation of the
Powers the civilised world has more to
fear from a weak, gutted and hostile
Japan than from a virile and co-operative
Japan.
In respect of the integration of Japan
into the concert of nations fighting against
Communism, it may be said that two
Australian policies seem to be irrational.
The view of most politicians who agree
that the Japanese Peace Treaty should
be signed seems to be that they and the
Australian people will never forget
Japanese atrocities against Australians in
the war, but that we have been dragged
to the peace-table by dire necessity,
through the Americans having decided to
forgive and forget. This carries an infer-
ence that Australia is too weak to support
a policy in international affairs which
does not dovetail with those of the United
States and all the countries of the British
Commonwealth. It gives this country an
air of impotence, and it also opens the
way to charges of insincerity. “Labor’s”
policy is, of course, purely oppor-
tunist. It is always ready to
promote any hatred which will gain
votes and placate the Communist unions
which provide it with financial and other
support. In this case, what the Com-
munist unions and their Moscow masters
most want is a permanent schism between
the Western Powers and Japan. Ergo,
Australian “Labor” is for the schism.
All nations other than Australia appear
to be at one on the Japanese question.
They are all ready to submit to Japanese
resurgence, to forgive and forget what
they suffered in common with Australia,
just as the Black Hole of Calcutta, the
horrors of Cawnpore, the Armenian mas-
sacres, have been forgiven and forgotten.
They are, moreover, willing that Japan
should be able to stand on her own feet
and take as large a share in her own
defence and the containment of Russia
and Communist China in the Orient as
her resources will allow.
There are four reasons why the concert
of nations is prepared for this. Firstly,
the programme of Pacific defence cannot
be carried out without a foothold in
Japan and the islands which it formerly
included in-its empire, plus Korea, from
which Russian airpower must be held off
from Japanese industry. And a defensive
foothold, with all that implies in scattered
facilities, far-flung radar bases and labor
could not be maintained at this stage
without full Japanese co-operation, both
Governmental and in industry. For
an immense part of the defence
scheme of the Pacific (including
that of Australia) Japan shortens lines of
communication, provides materiel and
workers on the spot, and is a base in
which defence supplies can be piled up
at leisure before the bottlenecks of war
develop. Japanese facilities are of
inestimable advantage in the conduct of
the Korean war.
Secondly, the Allies, and all who have
been in contact with the Japanese, though
they have no doubt that nation will
ultimately take its own way in pursuing
its destiny, are convinced that Japan
knows it is vital to her interest to integrate
with the Western bloc. Her Achilles heel
in production is not its own country,
squeezed every season to the last grain
of food, the last bean and the last bit
of coal and timber, but the subsidiary
food-areas of South-east Asia, the tempta-
tion which landed Japan in the last war.
The Japanese appreciate that survival and
salvation lie for them in keeping these
rice-growing lands out of Russian and
Chinese hands. They know where the
priorities in food will lie if Thailand,
Indo-China and Burma and Indonesia
fall into the hands of the Soviet Union
and its satellites. They know that, con-
trolled by Russia, the products of this
region, if they could be delivered
in the face of a hostile West, would go
only to people who were prepared to sit
up and beg, and that almost certainly the
food, metals and rubber of South-east
Asia would be used in the Kremlin’s
hands exclusively for the purposes of
blackmail and the enslavement of peoples.
Thirdly, the Allies know that the
Japanese have a very genuine hate and
fear of the Russians, combined with an
enormous contempt for them. One of
the worst things for Japanese-Russian
relations which Moscow ever did was its
boasting entry, in August, 1945, into the
Far Eastern War after it was over, and
its bloodless “conquest” of a Japanese
Manchuria which had already laid down
its arms, its complete plunder of Man-
churian industry, and its making-away
with 300,000 Japanese war-prisoners, who
have disappeared into the blue. These
things, and the recent trials of Japanese
alleged to have been involved in plans
for bacteriological warfare —using Rus-
sians as guinea-pigs almost exclusively at
a time when Japan and Russia were not
at war! —have left an impression on the
Japanese mind which did not need the
official crystallisation by Mr. Yoshida,
the Prime Minister, who says that friendly
relations cannot be established with the
U.S.S.R.
Russia’s misdeeds have brought home
to the Japanese, who, with their teeming
journals, have a remarkably and instantly
responsive public opinion, how little they
may expect from the Russians and Com-
munist Chinese. And they have seen at
first hand how much they can expect from
the Western Allies.
Lastly, the Western Allies are not
afraid to integrate Japan with the free
world because they are able to differen-
tiate very exactly between arming Japan
for aggression and arming Japan for
defence and co-operation. Japan cannot
hope to arm herself effectively. Even in
1941, when Japanese industry was at the
height of its production and with the
West involved in a world war, it was a
hare-brained experiment for her to attack
the United States and British Common-
wealth,
Japanese victory depended on winning
with the resources in metal and fuel and
transport which she actually possessed in
1941. At the end of the war even metal
buttons were being collected in Japan,
wood-alcohol was being tried in aircraft,
and, generally speaking, the war effort
had stripped the country bare. No Asiatic
nation, even if willing, can supply Japan’s
needs even for minimum defence so long
as the present or predictable shipping
position exists and oil, coal and metals
are in the hands of the Western world.
Japan is as much subject to the alloca-
tions of the International Materials Con-
ference in copper and zinc, nickel and
cobalt, tungsten and molybdenum as any
other nation on the Western side. She
is equally at the mercy of the West for
iron ore, coal and oil, aluminium and
wool and cotton fibre, and must continue
to be. And competitive amounts of these
war and peace necessities she cannot hope
to get from any source without Western
Allied consent so long as the world naval
and transport position remains what it is.
Thus the Western Allies proceed with-
out qualms to the inclusion in the Pacific
defence system of a Japan which has
already asserted its independence ahead
of the day when it will become free of


Occupation supervision so far as to
impose a 50 p.c. tax on the incomes of
resident foreigners and to institute a com-
mercial export trade which is already a
headache to the world.
At Kaidaichi, an environ town of
Hiroshima, where the Australian 67th
Battalion, fathers of the Australian Royal
Regiment, used to be barracked, is the
H.Q. of a Japanese “police force” which
is a special objective of Russian and
Chinese hate and propaganda. Its
uniforms resemble those of the United
States Army. It is armed with tanks and
artillery. But, though it startles visitors,
and its existence fills the Russians with
fury, the Supreme Command of the
Allied Powers and all its integral parts
regard its assisted development with com-
plete equanimity.
They seem to feel that when the Peace
Treaty is operative they will have said
good-bye to all that was implied in World
War 11, and that they will be able safely to
welcome Japan, at least for the foresee-
able future, into the remarkable integra-
tion of defence which has been built up
in the Orient (with the Korean front as
the spearhead of resistance to attack on
essential Pacific defences) so long as
the Japanese military system does not
possess the machinery for overseas
operation which she cannot rebuild
without their help.
EK DUM.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Shepherd's Warning.
The First Battalion of the Australian
Royal Infantry Regiment is nearly ready
for transport to Korea, and the Third
Battalion, now at the front with the
British Commonwealth Division and
some of it apparently in action during the
past few days, will probably go into
reserve as soon as the Firsts arrive.
Great changes are taking place in our
position in the Japanese-Korean area.
The ship which takes away the new bat-
talion, a British trooper, will have brought
back some of the last main elements of
the British Commonwealth Occupation
Force proper, some of whose officers
have been in Japan almost since the first
troops landed. A great many of them
return with unexampled experience.
Many, still young, should provide
an invaluable administrative pool for
the Regular Army to draw on in the
future. With very few exceptions mem-
bers of the force have been fine ambas-
sadors.
The Occupation, for all its faults, has
been a great advertisement for Australian
troops. It was the first time in history
that Australia had been allotted a British
Commonwealth Commander -in - Chief
abroad when Lieutenant-General North-
cott was appointed fresh from the office
of Chief-of-Staff of the Australian war-
time armies, and since his time to the
present an Australian has held the
supreme British command in Japan with-
out interruption. Lieutenant-General
Bridgeford is the last holder of the office.
It is not too much to say that the high
standards set by Australia’s 34th Brigade
under Brigadier Ronald Hopkins, later
Vice-Chief of the General Staff, and now
major-general commanding Duntroon,
both placed Australia on the map with
the Japanese and caused a revolution in
the local standards of smartness among
American troops. The 34th Brigade bat-
talions were mothers of the Royal Aus-
tralian Infantry battalions and have a
place in Commonwealth military history
which can never be lost.
Furthermore, the administration of
8.C.0.F. in its Kure area, with its fine
workshops and splendid and extensive
signals and communication systems,
formed a nucleus of organisaton which
was instantly ready to give base service
in the Korean war.
Abroad in the east of Europe, in the
Middle East and in Korea and South
China threats to Australia’s continued
existence are developing which might jolt
the Commonwealth to a full war footing
within a year. Australians should be
made to get that possibility firmly into
their heads. Every red dawn in Korea is
a shepherd’s warning of the kind of
stormy day which seems to be ahead
of us.
Mew Australians and Crime.
Ever since European migrants began to
arrive in this country in large numbers
under post-war immigration schemes
there have been allegations that the new-
comers have been responsible for an
undue proportion of serious crimes.
A casual reading of the court news in
the daily papers, in which frequent refer-
ences are made to accused men as “New
Australians” or in which an unpronounce-
able name suggests that its owner has but
lately arrived from Europe, has certainly
lent color to the charge ; but evidence of
this sort is an unreliable guide, and it
was for that reason that the Federal Gov-
ernment appointed a committee to
investigate the charges. The committee
consisted of W. R. Dovey, K.C., T.
Dougherty, secretary of the A.W.U., J.
Neagle, secretary of the R.S.L., and Mrs.
I. G. Norris, of the National Council of
Women. The committee’s report has now
been published, and it declares that the
allegations against migrants as a class
are without foundation.
Taking police statistics for the 12
months ended November 30, 1951, it was
found that the proportion of convictions
for serious offences was higher among the
native-born than among New Australians
—5O per cent, higher in the case of
crimes dealt with in the superior courts
and 33 per cent, higher if magistrates’
courts were included. Serious sex-crimes
were more prevalent among “Old” Aus-
tralians ; minor sex-offences among
“New.” This latter fact the committee
thought might be due to the dispropor-
tion of the sexes of migrants —a 20 per
cent, predominance of males.
With crimes of violence it was the
same story—a lower proportion of New
Australians charged in the higher courts ;
a higher proportion haled before the
magistrates for less serious offences. Of
this the committee said the main causes
were
arguments based on national jealousies
where different nationalities were grouped
in hostels; insufficient normal community
life; and the suspicion and resentment ..of a
section of Australians who were inex-
perienced in dealing with foreigners.
This investigation was not confined to
police records. Information was also
sought from employers, trade-unions,
teachers, hostel staffs and others in close
contact with migrants, and the conclusion
reached was that there were no grounds
for believing that New Australians as a
class included an undue proportion of
criminals. The feeling was expressed
that the impression had arisen through
undue prominence being given in sections
of the Press to offences committed by
migrants. When an Australian was
charged with an offence he was referred
to as an individual, and by name. If a
New Australian was involved, he was
often described as a migrant, bringing
odium on the whole company of
migrants.
Something similar occurred m the
1920’5, when it was a common thing to
read “John Smith, a returned soldier, was
charged....” In nine cases out of 10
there was no more necessity for stating
that the malefactor was an ex-serviceman
than for giving the color of his hair or
mentioning that he had an uncle in
Burma, but the practice created an
impression that ex-soldiers were a lawless
lot. Now the same influence is working
against the migrants.
"No Fires in the Open."
“Cumberland Farmer” on a burning
subject:
From observation in but a limited area of the
vast regions ravaged by fires this summer it
strikes me, and others also, as peculiar that
these fires always seem to start in about the
same places, Does any authority ever investi-
gate into the causes, and, if so, does it ever
publish the results? About once in a thousand
times the police get hold of an offender against
some “Now I, Clive Raleigh Evatt, hereby
declare” regulation, and he is fined a fiver or
let off under bond. Generally speaking, no
neighbor will inform against another, though
there is rarely any whodunit mystery in the
case. But if this reluctance to take action
extends —as seems indicated —everywhere, and
right up to Ministers themselves, what hope is
there of ever preventing these fires?
The alibis are inexhaustible. It used to be
sparks from railway-engines, good enough to
pass even when fallacious, Modernly a common
one is the behavior of some internal-combustion
engine temporarily untrue to label. Some of
us who spent many anxious hours on that
recent disastrous hot Thursday tried to track
down the origin of a bad fire, and decided we
had a clue in the activities of a shire council’s
working-party on a bush road. But no; “it
was a bulldozer that backfired into grass, and
the fire got away from the driver.” It also
beat one heavily-strained local volunteer fire-
brigade, which was defeated by a series of
mishaps reminiscent of the accident to the
young man of Seville; the water-main burst
on them, the fire-engine exploded, and the fire
was soon miles away. The area open to it
between Dural, Hornsby and Berowra could
not cause more anxiety tp local inhabitants if
it were full of tigers.
These things do happen to cause the fires,
but I, for one, would like to know how much
respect there is about the place for Mr. Clive
Raleigh Evatt’s self-advertising regulations about
lighting fires in the open during the periods in
which he forbids them, and whether that victim
of political megalomania ever follows up his
regulations to see what happens. If he ignores
the mere morons, like those who started the
fire at Tumut by shooting down power-lines,
he could begin by inquiring how the multitude
of Government, semi-government or local-
government working-parties, sent out on jobs in
the county of Cumberland —or any other parts
of N.S.W. —'produce their morning, lunchtime
and afternoon teas without lighting fires, and
whether Mr. Evatt ever questions their attitude
towards emergency regulations “absolutely for-
bidding” any “lighting of fires in the open.”
If he admits such abuse, presumably Mr. Evatt
knows enough about the law to make unneces-
sary any argument on the consequences of such
admission. If he declines to admit it, will he
say on what ground?
Where Does It Go?
The American Atomic Energy Commis-
sion has informed the U.S.A. that the
plant needed to make the H-bomb will
cost the equivalent of £ASSB million,
twice the original estimate. When it is
noted that the amount is roughly equal to
the total sum paid in taxes of all kinds
by Australians in 1949-50 (£560.7 million)
it gives some idea of the cost of modern
defence.
It may also help Australians to
reconcile themselves to the startling
increase in total tax-collections in their
own country. The sum, according to the
Commonwealth Statistician, jumped from
£560.7 million in 1949-50 to £828.8
million in 1950-51. The latter figure
includes £109.5 million from the wool-
deduction tax (which will later even itself
out), but is still by far the biggest increase
in a single year ever recorded.
The figures represent the total revenue
from all forms of taxation —State and
Federal —except local-government. The
latest year for which 1.-g. figures are
available is 1948-49, when the total was
£23.7 million. Excluding this sum, but
including all others, it means that whereas
taxes cost £69 13s. a head of population
in 1950, they cost £99 14s. last year.
This year, the impact of basic-wage rises
and new sales taxes will make the figure
higher, though it is probable that
falls will occur in revenue from farming
industries and, to an extent, from luxury
trades.
One answer to the question as to what
the seven Governments do with all the
money is contained in the cost of the H-
bomb. The Federal Government is com-
mitted to an expanding defence pro-
gramme, and with one powerful friend
spending so much to make bombs, and
another facing hurtful deprivations —as
the British have been asked to do—to
maintain the strength of the free world,
it cannot in all conscience sidestep this
obligation.
In other directions, both State and
Federal, there is plenty of room for
criticism. Far too much tax-money is
spent on projects that can be labelled as
unnecessary where they are not simply
vote-catching, and there is little sign of a
halt to the steady increase of Govern-
ment employees. Too many of these, it
is obvious, are employed for no other
purpose than to interfere with the lives
and enterprise of private persons and
companies.
The Camera Doesn't Lie.
Told by Premier Playford that because
of congestion at Port Adelaide wharves
overseas ships were now refusing to put
in there with cargo for South Australia
and were carrying it on to Melbourne,
whence it was carted overland back to
Adelaide, Senator McLeay, the Federal
Minister for Shipping, said he would
consult Mr. Holt, the Federal Minister
for Labor, to see what could be done
to “right this dreadful position.”
The two gentlemen would profit by a
close study of a picture in Sydney
“Herald” of last Thursday. It is a very
clear photograph, clearly reproduced. It
is headed “Stockfeed for South Coast,”
and the caption beneath is “Wharf-
laborers loading bags of fodder aboard
the steamer Cobargo at Darling Harbor
yesterday for livestock on the fire-ravaged
South Coast.”
Graphically topical in more ways than
one, the picture shows slings each con-
taining nine bags of chaff being stowed
in the hold. Each sling is left with ropes
attached so it can be winched out at its
destination. Thus the bags of chaff are
not being stacked but merely dropped
in sling by sling.
In the picture five (5) honest wharfies
are shown carefully persuading one sling-
load not to jump over the side or sneak
into the galley. A sling of nine bags of
chaff would barely weigh half a ton. A
boy could guide it into position and slip
the winch-hook from the loop.
“Dreadful position” is right.
"Color-harmony" and the P.S.
In its annual report for 1950-51 the
N.S.W. Public Service Board records a
conference of heads of Government
organisations, at the instance of Premier
McGirr, “to explore the possibility
of securing the desired measure of co-
operation and co-ordination of activities.”
The conference found its task difficult
because of “shortages in labor and
materials which prevent the practical
application of what in normal times
should be more effective methods of
dealing with common problems.” How-
ever, the board “feels that regular meet-
ings of this kind will promote that greater
measure of understanding and co-
ordinated action which is so desirable be-
tween various State authorities.” In
short, the public may rest assured that
the game of “exploring avenues” is not
being neglected.
One important piece of business show-
ing progress is the redistribution of
departmental furniture for “the greatest
possible harmony in size, color and
design,” and “furniture which cannot be
reasonably matched” is being exchanged.
Who says these fellows don’t know
what hard work is?
Phony Peace and Fake
Friendship.
In announcing the A.L.P. decision
declaring the group organising the so-
called “Youth Carnival for Peace and
Friendship” to be an auxiliary of the
Communist party, “not genuinely con-
cerned with peace, but aiming to exploit
for propaganda purposes the young
people of Australia,” Mr. C. Anderson,
secretary of the A.L.P., said that, “apart
from a few people who had been misled,”
the only people supporting the carnival
were Communist auxiliaries and Left-
wing unions.
This is largely true, but the wonder is
that there are still apparently intelligent
people gullible enough to accept as
genuine a stunt so obviously reeking with
the stench of Moscow.
History abounds in examples of names,
bestowed in derision, becoming honored
through the achievements of those at
whom they were thrown in contempt.
Modern instances of this are the Old
Contemptibles and the Rats of Tobruk.
With the Communists this process seems
to work in reverse ; they touch nothing
which they do not contaminate. This
blighting influence has been operating for
years, probably the first word to feel its
force being “comrade,” which, once a
warm friendly word, is now merely a
colorless form of address for Ohe con-
scripted or sedheed into the service of
the Kremlin. Another word in the pro-
cess of being corrupted by evil associa-
tions is democracy. When a “comrade”
speaks of “democracy” he means the sort
of regime existing in Iron Curtain coun-
tries under which a careless remark idly
uttered can bring a midnight visit from
the secret police and a long, long journey
east.
Taking a leaf out of “Labor’s” book,
the Reds have long claimed a lien on the
word “worker,” and, just as the “Labor”
party does not consider anyone a worker
who does not belong to a trade-union, the
Communists reserve the title for those
trade-unionists who are prepared to
spring a strike whenever the central
executive of the Communist party de-
cides the time is ripe for one. “Youth”
is another word which needs to be care-
fully examined, since the Comrades set
out to appropriate it for their own pur-
poses, attaching it to “Eureka” —some
genius in the party having apparently dis-
covered that the Ballarat diggers, who,
unless they were'vastly different from all
other goldminers, must have been capi-
talists to a man, were fired with the
genuine Marxist spirit.
Most recent casualties in this war upon
words are “peace” —sorely smitten —and
its walking-wounded colleague, “friend-
ship.” It may seem ridiculous that these
words should have any but the most inno-
cent connotation; yet look what hap-
pened to “comrade.” In the last few years
the agents of Moscow have staged a
series of “peace rallies" and “peace con-
gresses,” and have organised in most
Western countries “peace councils,” which
hold meetings allegedly in the interests of
peace and hawk “peace petitions” around
the suburbs for unsuspecting housewives
to sign.
It is not difficult to get people to sign a
declaration that they are in favor of peace.
Women unversed in the ways of the
Comrades naturally see no harm in adding
their signatures to the list the canvasser
brings to their front door—especially if
they have sons of or approaching military
age. If they have any doubts as to the
bona fides of the appeal the canvasser is
able to point to the names of a couple
of churchmen who have been enticed on
to the executive to give a false front of
respectability to a gang whose only real
interest in peace lies in preventing their
own country from putting its defences in
order.
The Youth Carnival for Peace and
Friendship follows the same pattern as
its predecessors. The Communist
“Tribune,” reporting the meeting at
which the stunt was launched, said
that the meeting was held “in
response to a call issued almost unani-
mously by the Australian delegation

which attended the Berlin World Youth
Congress.” That congress was condemned
by the British Labor Government as a
Communist show, and many of the Aus-
tralian delegates visited Russia and Com-
munist China on their way home. Those
who came via Peking were loud in their
praises of the “peace-loving” people of
Red China, and appeared blissfully
ignorant or unmindful of the fact that
their fellow-countrymen were being killed
in Korea by the “peace-lovers” while
they were being entertained in Peking.
It is no doubt flattering to be asked to
act as sponsor or judge in a literary or
art competition, but there is nothing
flattering or complimentary in being used
as a dupe. When a man has innocently
agreed to act in such a capacity with-
out realising the true background of the
movement with which he is being asked
to associate himself there is a natural
reluctance to go back on his word; per-
sons finding themselves in such a
quandary should remember that an under-
taking obtained under false pretences has
no validity. Already a former Test-
cricketer and a Sydney cartoonist have
had the good sense and the courage—
for it takes courage to admit that one has
had one’s leg pulled—to withdraw their
sponsorship from the “Peace and Friend-
ship Carnival.” Others would do well
to follow their example.
POLITICAL POINTS
Federal Parliament reopens today,
mainly to argue over the Japanese Peace
Treaty and agree on bumping up mem-
bers' salaries. It will go into recess again
at the end of the month, reassemble for
a couple of days during the Royal visit
to Canberra and get down to business
again at the beginning of May.
Another Communist March-on-
Canberra has been arranged for next
Tuesday in protest against ratification of
the Japanese Peace Treaty. In accord-
ance with current policy Corns will be
in the background while their stooges,
organised into a Society for the Non-
Ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty,
carry the baby—in the form of a petition
entitled “Citizens’ Declaration for
Peace.” Moscow’s policy on this subject
is identical with that of Federal “Labor,”
and the plan is to ask Doc. Evatt to
introduce the delegation to Menzies and
present the petition in the House. To
avoid embarrassing Bert in his “fight”
against Communism, the whole stunt has
been labelled “non-party,” and the
signatories include, in addition to a
bunch of well-meaning fatheads who can
always be relied on to give their auto-
graph whenever a ball-point pen is thrust
into their hands, such true-blue “Labor”
men as Eddie and Bert’s little
brother Clive, neither of whom, of
course, could ever be suspected of having
any truck with Communism.
N.S.W. Transport Minister Sheahan
has openly confessed that his department
can’t run its own business, and that it
isn’t game to face public criticism any
more. He has appointed two “tribunals”
of three men each, the chairman of both
to be Judge De Baun. One is to
“recommend adjustments” in railway-
freights and -fares, the other to do the
same for tram- and bus-fares. Do the
gentlemen appointed realise that in future
they’ll have to take the blame for chronic
deficits and for any fare- and freight-
rises? “That’s a matter for the tribunal,”
will become a stock phrase in N.S.W,
transport matters.
Having unloaded, as he appears to
suppose, all the McGrrrrr Government’s
responsibility for power services on to
the new Electricity Commission, N.S.W.
Deputy-Premier Cahill now opens the
bag to reveal what puts the ‘Tong” in
Bunnerong. Will he now explain who is
responsible for the shameful waste and
years-long delay in construction of
Pyrmont powerhouse?
Almost the only responsibility the
McGrnrrs have not passed on to a board
or tribunal is the decision on fixing Par-
liamentary salaries. They voted their
own rise—a thumping one of £5OO a
year. Could it be that they feared a
tribunal might recommend a reduction?
The death, after a short illness, of
C.-P. member E. J. Eggins (Lyne,
N.S.W.) will necessitate an early by-
election, the third in the short life of the
present Federal Parliament. As Mr.
Eggins won Lyne by nearly 12,000 votes
at last year’s election the Government
need have no worries about holding the
seat, but with “Labor” keen to use the
campaign as a means of testing how far
its inflation-depression propaganda has
sunk into the electorate, and the Govern-
ment, for prestige reasons, eager to win
by as big a majority as it can muster.
there should be some pretty hot cam-
paigning in the next few weeks.
Lyne electorate is part of the Country-
party principality in northern New South
Wales. It includes the rich valleys of
the Manning, Hastings and Macleay
Rivers and its chief towns are Kempsey
and Taree.
F. 8.1. men in New York used movie-
cameras on the wharves, and developed
pictures clearly showing wharfies de-
liberately breaking open cargo and help-
ing themselves to goods. The films have
been handed to the New York Crime
Commission for further action. For Aus-
tralia, where wharf - pillage is not
unknown, the real interest is in the
American penalties. For pinching goods
worth less than £5O a wharfie there is
liable to a year’s jail or a fine of £400;
if the goods are worth more than £5O he’s
liable to 10 years or a fine of £2250.
In a letter to Brisbane “Courier-Mail”
a reader gives “the real reason for the
reduced [wheat] yield”:
A friend of mine owns two good blocks
of 900 acres of land on the Downs. I asked
him if he was planting them both with
wheat, hitherto the chief crop in the district,
and he replied: “No, I own about £6OOO-
- of good farm machinery, and if i
wear it out planting both areas, by the time
I pay tax I will have worn machinery and
insufficient money to replace it. So I am
only planting sufficient to make good
wages.”
Unless this problem of inflation v. depre-
ciation-allowances is tackled by taxation
people the whole of industrial Australia
will be crippled. And, obviously, present
“plans” for increasing the wheat yield
won’t increase anything save the stocks
of pigeonholed plans which litter the
country.
Victoria’s anti-bushfire campaign has
made much play of the dangers of the
lighted fag thrown through the motor-
car window, and the question has been
referred to the Police Department, which
sets down all sorts of requirements for
motorists. C. A. Daws, the bushfire chief,
has come out with an effective and
simple suggestion—to make an ashtray
an essential part of motor-vehicle equip-
ment.
Among other forms of austerity with
which the British are faced is the wearing
of suits made of synthetic fibre from
West African peanuts. It should comfort
them to know that £36 million of their
tax-money was spent by the Attlees in
trying to grow the peanuts.
Some unpatriotic person has suggested
that in view of the lag in municipal
works and the need for relief and
amenities throughout Melbourne’s indus-
trial suburbs, the cost (£2000) of the
Royal ball should be taken off the
shoulders of taxpayers and shifted to
the participants in the function. The
thought of the City Fathers asking each
guest for a donation at the entrance
sounds almost as awful as if each guest
were told to bring one bottle of
champagne or a dozen of Melbourne
Bitter and a packet of sandwiches.
Queensland’s peregrinating royal com-
mission on off-the-course betting turned
up in Toowoomba the other day and
heard the chairman of the local Turf
Club speak out strongly against the pro-
posal to legalise s.-p. betting. He said
(“Courier-Mail” report) that there seemed
to be an impression that gambling was
an amenity which should be extended to
people living in the outback. “If the
Australian way of life has developed
along such lines that baser ways of life
are regarded as amenities, it is most
regrettable,” He advocated sending a
batch of Queenslanders abroad “to study
world development in community
amenities for the outback.”
Having awaited the Galvin decision on
claim for higher margins in the metal
trades (a test case) —it was rejected—
Coal Tribunal Gallagher has now pro-
nounced against the miners’ claims for
marginal increases up to 265. a week, but
has awarded 3d. a ton extra (Is. claimed)
on contract-rates for filling machine-cut
coal in certain collieries. Incidentally,
when the mythical basic wage rose in
N.S.W. by 9s. to £lO 165,, the minimum
adult weekly wage on the coalfields was
increased to £l2 15s, 6d.
Truest remark of the week can be
credited to Alan Kirk, retiring U.S.
Ambassador to Russia. He said: “Russia
has changed her tactics for the moment,
but her main attitude never changes.”
Paul Hasluck, Minister for Territories,
has been looking over the biggest of ’em,
and has ventured a prophecy that “in the
next 50 years the Northern Territory will
develop so much that the whole of Aus-
tralia will be amazed.” There are prob-
ably still a few old-timers in the north
who remember much the same thing being
said 50 years ago. Still, they’re an opti-
mistic crowd in the Territory, and they
reckon Hasluck may be right this time.
Speakers at the A.W.U. convention in
Mackay (Q.) didn’t think very highly of
the McGrrrrr salary grab. They carried
a resolution “viewing with disappoint-
ment and apprehension the growing
tendency of some political Labor repre-
sentatives to put self before principle,”
and made it quite clear that they weren’t
merely talking in generalities. The
Queensland State president said that
when the union approached the Govern-
ment for increases for its members it
was told to go to the Arbitration Court.
When it did so it got nothing ; yet poli-
ticians raised their own salaries.
The Canberra folk, on this occasion,
have referred their salaries to a tribunal.
The report is not public yet, but everyone
seems to expect an increase. Menzies and
Co. have a chance to make history, set an
example to the community and help their
own campaign against inflation by intro-
ducing a bill for a smaller increase than
that recommended by the tribunal.
Ordinary citizens are finding it hard to
understand why Parliamentarians should
be on a different footing from everyone
else in the matter of “margins.”
If Senator Kefauver, one of the
aspirants for Democratic nomination for
U.S. President, ever reaches the White
House there’ll be a welcome touch of
color in Presidential speeches. A recent
item from an address in which he criti-
cised suggestions that American economic
aid to Europe should be reduced and said
it was impossible for the United States to
be at once politically internationalist and
economically isolationist:
This can no more be done than for one
Siamese-twin to do a high-dive while the
other plays the fiddle.
Last year 133,000 migrants arrived in
Australia, compared with 175,000 the
previous year. The decline was partly
due to the winding-up of the D.P. scheme
and partly to an intentional cutting-down
in numbers, made necessary by inflation
and the war in Korea. British migrants
in 1951 totalled 73,000.
“Spokesmen” for various wheatgrower
organisations have taken to warning
the Federal Government that unless
it gives growers “an incentive”
the wheat yield will be down another
15 p.c. to 20 p.c. next year. Exactly
what these people expect from Can-
berra isn’t clear. But there is a
growing belief among non-wheatgrowing
taxpayers that part of the reason for the
wheat decline is that so many growers
have done so well in the past decade that
they’re sitting back in the breeching.
Are we to believe that a grower would
rather go broke and starve than grow
wheat at current prices?
During 1951 working-days lost through
strikes were only half those lost in
1950. Last year days lost through strikes
equalled only 1.2 for every 1000 days
worked, the lowest figure since 1942.
It’s to be hoped Dr, Evatt sheets home
the blame for this to Menzies.
Victorian Transport Minister Hyland
has become commander-in-chief or boss-
rooster or whatever it is of all Victorian
public transport. There is a new Trans-
port Co-ordination Board under a Co-
ordinator of Transport with all the
appurtenances and personnel applying
thereunto. This is supposed to solve in
one victorious blow the whole problem
of Victorian transport.
Westralia’s new oil-refinery—Anglo-
Iranian Oil is building it, but citizens of
the McLarty State regard it as their own
—will cost somewhere in the vicinity of
£4O million, will be completed (it is
hoped) in four years’ time, will
have a capacity of 3,000,000 tons of
crude oil a year, sufficient to meet 40
per cent, of Australia’s present needs of
oil and petrol and a storage capacity of
1,000,000 tons. The site is at Kwinana,
14 miles from Fremantle.
P. Brahmachari, a candidate opposing
Pandit Nehru in the Indian general
election, took a vow of silence some years
ago and communicates with his followers
only in writing. Ah, if only we could
get some of our politicians to put it in
writing!
Bacon is still in the basic-wage fixer’s
basket; but how long is it since an Aus-
tralian wage-earner has been able to
bring any home?
In the Budget debate the Government
promised that something would be done
to ease the tax burden of elderly people
on fixed incomes. The promise has been
kept by a provision which exempts from
taxation single men over 65 and women
over 60 whose total income is not more
than £234 a year. Married couples of
those ages are exempt unless their income
exceeds £468.

Trade and Investments
Trade figures for the half-year
to December 31 show an
adverse balance of £215 million
—a record deficit, which com-
pares with a credit of £54 mil-
lion for the same period of
1950-51. However, the drift in
the position is now less violent,
the deficit for the month of
December being £18.2 million,
compared with an average
monthly deficit for the six-
monthly period of £36 million,
and with a record monthly deficit
of £55 million in September.
During a period which
approximately covers the trading
half-year the fall in the Com-
monwealth Bank’s holding of
gold and balances abroad was
about £290 million—£7s million
more than the trade deficit.
Ordinary invisible items would
account for a great deal of this
difference, but some may have
been the result of a repatriation
of so-called “hot-money.” _
In the last few weeks the rate
of drain on our London funds
has eased, but it is still at a rate
greater than the trade deficit for
December would indicate,
Though funds which were
attracted to Australia by the
boom in wool prices and the
buoyant stockmarkets may now
be tending to leave Australia for
investment pastures new, there
are indications that the fall in
our overseas funds will soon be
checked, as internal conditions
in Australia at present are in no
way conducive to excessive im-
ports of consumer goods. The
confidence of wholesalers and
retailers has been shaken by the
recent turn of economic events
both at home and abroad. (In the
U.S.A. and Great Britain the retali
trade fias been similarly affected.)
Reports from Canberra indi-
cate that the economic high
command has no fear of serious
unemployment for at least a
generation.” We could, however,
expect some disemployment—
temporary idleness during
changes of occupation” which
w °uld bring a “gradual transfer
°f lubor from less-essential and
less-efficient industries to the
short-manned heavy basic indus-
fries- ’ By pressure of Govern-
ment policy it was thought
better to reorganise industry
through disemployment than
wait until there is a crash.
The Prime Minister, Mr.
Menzies, said that his Govern-
ment was contemplating no
alteration of its credit-restriction
P°hcy. Referring to the effect of
credlt policy on home-building,
Mr. Menzies said that if banks
were now becoming more
stringent it must be remembered
that their advances had risen at
an unprecedented rate during the
l ast six months.
The Bulletin has no quarrel
with the Government’s broad
economic policy, but it empha-
sises the necessity for attention
to detail as well as to broad
policy. Central control of any
economic function has far-
reaching effects, and that imposes
heavy responsibility upon the
central bank and upon the civil
service. Doctrinaires within
these Government agencies
could defeat the Ministry’s pur-
pose if they are not watched —
and scotched. If Dr. Coombs,
for example, shows any tendency
to use the Government’s eco-
nomic policy to implement the
Socialist programme of his
previous political sponsors he
should be removed from office.
But if he is prepared to do a
faithful job as a banker and an
economist without regard to
politics or doctrines there can
be little cause for complaint
against him. On these points the
Menzies Government should
satisfy itself, because it will be
held responsible for the actions of
its servants, whether they were put
on the Government payroll by
a previous Ministry or by itself.

production in 1953, and the bal-
ance on expanding output of
products already being mar-
keted, New Zealand Forests
Products, Ltd., has been forging
ahead with development for the
greater part of another year, and
is now beginning to get a
distant glimpse of the day when
its big industrial-centre-in-the-
making will be turning out mil-
lions worth of timber, pulp and
a number of reductions in
interim-div. distributions, but in
some cases these have been the
result of refusal of Capital
Issues permission to offer new
shares, with the result that the
company concerned has had to
rely on internal finanee. Other
cos. have been directly con-
cerned with the wool trade, and
a cut in profits and distributions
was to be expected. The next
two months will see the
announcement of many more
interim distributions, and they
will be awaited with general
interest.
By contrast with sharemarket
weakness, there has been strong
support for gilt-edged and semi-
governmental loans. The 3} p.c,
loans are all at a premium, and
new 4i p.c. public-body offer-
ings have been rushed. This is
in marked contrast to the posi-
tion of less than six months ago:
though the borrowing-rate is
now about 10s. per cent, higher,
it is not the entire cause of
current strong support for
“gilts”; another factor is the
confusion in the public mind
about industrial shares, and a
consequent switch in investment.
But whilst investors generally
are quite right in now demand-
ing a return on industrials con-
siderably higher than was accept-
able a year ago, it is not wise to
sacrifice sound industrial stocks
giving a well-covered yield of 5
p.c. or more unless there is a
pressing need for the money tied
up. There is every reason to be-
lieve that basic industry in this
country will be very busy for the
next decade at least, and that
during that period there will be
a tendency for inflation to go
on, even if it is temporarily
halted and its present breakneck
rate slowed down considerably.
In any case it should be remem-
bered that if money becomes
more valuable (as the switch to
interest-bearing securities would
suggest) dividend-income re-
ceived from industrial companies
will be equally valuable.
The first six months of the
present year are likely to be
uncertain for a number of rea-
sons, one being the incidence of
the new taxation system on the
pastoral industry, which has
been g, considerable supporter of
the sharemarket in recent years.
But the present tone of the share-
market is so hesitant that it can
hardly be accepted as a reliable
guide to what it will be in a
year’s time. By comparison with
good second-line stocks some
market leaders appear to be too
high.
N.Z. Forest Products
After spending at least
£600,000 on building and plant
extensions last financial year (to
March 31), most of it on its
pulp-and-paper-m i 11 projects,
which will be due to swing into
paper annually. The mills at
Kmleith, the base of operations
—a new name on New Zealand
maps—should be making their
weight felt a couple of years
hence. Here are the co.’s main
targets:—
The pulp mill, to be ready early in
1953, will turn out a minimum of
25,000 tons of pulp yearly.
Lhe kraft-paper mill, ready six
of istooo ” U S
p aper .
Sawmills in production or under
construction will yield 70 million
super, ft. of sawn timber yearly.
Outlay on these schemes and
on some hundreds of houses and
facilities for the co.’s staffs will
exceed £5 million. In 1953 the
staff will total 2500. Today’s
figure is 1300.
The deadlines are later than
originally fixed, because of the
slow-down that resulted from
N.Z.’s big three-month strike,
which throttled supplies of
building materials and may have
set back divs. by a year, because
shareholders will have to sit it
out until full production begins.
Meanwhile there’s a growing
feeling that the shares may be as
good as an endowment policy.
With 11 years of steadily-
growing output, rising annual
profits since it first showed
promise in 1944, and accumu-
lated earnings of £702,316, it
hasn’t done much more than
touch the fringe of its forest re-
serves, which cover 176,000
acres, mainly insignis- and
radiata-pines, planted about a
quarter of a century ago in the
Putaruru-Taupo districts. In
more than a decade only 6000
acres have been felled. When
Kinleith demands soar in 1953-
54 the co. will have to cut 4000-
odd acres yearly, and the figure
will rise later in the ’fifties, par-
ticularly if the co. gets a licence
to make 60,000 tons of news-
print a year. Nature will re-
place about two-thirds of the
trees taken out, and the other
third will be planted. Under the
30-year rotation planned the
annual harvest could be 6000
acres.
Most of the increase in out-
put at the moment is going to
meet unsatisfied Maoriland de-
mands for sawn timber, corru-
gated and solid containers, multi-
wall bags and other packaging
materials, all sold under tight
price-ceilings that don’t leave
much margin over costs. The
main export contract is for
12,500 tons or more of baled
sulphate pulp annually for Aus-
tralian Newsprint Mills, to be
turned into newsprint.

The Roto-Baler rolling up Messrs. Brent’s lucerne crop at Bunjur jen, Boonah.
The lucerne had been
baled in rolls by the new
Roto-Baler and brought
£25/10/- per ton. Rec-
tangular bales from the
same crop, and baled on
the same day, brought
£23 per ton.
The lucerne was grown
by Messrs. J. and L.
Brent, of Bunjurgen,
Boonah, on what is
regarded as good dry
lucerne country. The
crop had not been irri-
gated and yielded one
ton per acre. Mr. Len
Brent said there was no
difference in the quality
of the lucerne in the
consignments, as both
came off the one field and
were harvested by the
two different methods on
the same day.
Before Mr. P. J. Skinner
auctioned the hay in the
Roma Street markets he
unrolled sample bales of
the roto-baled hay. Buyers
were impressed by the
absence of “leaf shatter,”
all leaves and flowers still
being intact on each
stalk. The Roto-Baler
rolls up the windrow in a
rotary action, each layer
sealing the preceding one.
The bale length is always
36 inches, but two adjust-

diameter, heavy or light

tinues to spin while it
is spirally wrapped with
binder twine.
Bales made this way

Christmas business, to judge by
the fact that departmentistore
sales in four weeks ending
December 22 were even with a
year ago, has been good,
inasmuch as last year’s figures
were exceptional. But it has not
been as good as merchants ex-
pected and prepared for for
many believed that after the long
lull from May to November a
4 or 5 per cent increase
could be realised.’ In the
merchandise trades generally the
emphasis is still on cutting down
inventories. Shocks of durable
goods relatively are higher than
stocks of softgoods.
The period of inventory-
liquidation has been running for
a good many months. Its effect
has been to reduce production
and employment in the indus-
tries concerned, to drive prices
below ceilings and to narrow
profit-margins. Production of
consumers’ durable goods is
restricted additionally by the
severe limitations on the use of
metals, which the defence
authorities now say will be
tighter in the second quarter
than in the first. The difficulties
of producers and distributors,
however, have been sustained
without grave losses or a notable
increase in failures, and the in-
fluences that will make for
improvement in due course are
in sight, namely, sustained high
purchasing-power and reduction
in stocks all along the line.
This sluggishness in consumer-
goods demand, with the accom-
panying increase in saving, pro-
vides the principal explanation
for the good balance between
inflationary and deflationary
forces which has existed in the
United States during the past
few months, and for the
failure of the extreme infla-
tionary predictions of a year ago
to come true. While other kinds
of demand were expanding and
personal incomes rising, personal
buying has subsided. Market
conditions have forced price-
cutting rather than expected
price advances. Compulsory
curtailment of production, where
enforced, has not caused the
shortages that were predicted.
The money that has been saved
instead of spent has helped swell
the supply of investment funds
available to finance the demand
for capital goods and construc-
tion. The pressure on the labor
supply from defence and de-
fence-supporting plants has been
eased by the release of workers
from consumers’ durable-goods
plants.
Shifts of U.S. production and
employment from consumers’ to
defence output are necessary to
carry out the defence pro-
gramme, and have to be
accepted as part of its cost. The
unique experience of 1951 was
that demand shifted con-
currently, in most timely fashion.
The inflationary pressures thus
have been reduced and the prob-
lems of the defence and control
authorities eased.
To many people the present
state of balance is somewhat sur-
prising, and probably not many
expect it to last through 1952.
The pressing question is whether
the price-rise will be resumed,
living costs advance further and
the dollar show continued de-
preciation. The conditions
under which inflation thrives will
be present. While areas of
unemployment will exist, at least
temporarily, people willing and
able to work in the main will
have jobs at high wages, and the
part of their product which goes
for defence will not return to
the markets to absorb their pur-
chasing-power, Most estimates
of consumer expenditures for
1952 forecast an increase, at
least after January and February,
when last year’s figures were
abnormally high. The declara-
tion of war by the C. 1.0. on the
wage - stabilisation programme
and the demands of the steel
unions threaten higher wage-
rates, which, if granted, will
raise wage and salary payments
further. The other side of the
shield is that industrial costs will
also advance. Upward pressures
on prices will be created.
The lessons of 1951 point to
the way to contain these pres-
sures. It is not correct to say
that increasing production of it-
self will suppress inflation, since
that cannot be true if purchas-
ing-power rises faster than pro-
duction and if the money is
spent. But increased output has
a profound effect in dampening
inflationary forces, because de-
mands for specific things are not
infinitely elastic and any given
market can be saturated. Of
course purchasing-power can
move from one area to another,
as from essentials into expensive
luxuries and services, but the
experience of 1951 shows it does
not always do so. At some point
people choose to save rather than
spend. Businessmen, for their
part, turn more conservative in
their own buying. This is what
happened during the past year.
Thus the first lesson to be drawn
is the need to work and produce.
No one knows now how
people will behave in 1952. They
have had a demonstration of the
needlessness of alarm over
fancied shortages of softgoods.
Obviously they are better stocked
with hardgoods and better
housed than most people ex-
pected a year ago. But two
dangers exist. One is that even
if 1952 begins with individual
soberness and restraint, a rise
in wage-rates, lifting money-
incomes, may increase demand
excessively and perhaps create
another cycle of shortage fears
and scare-buying.
The second danger is that
public extravagance, waste and
confusion may generate greater
alarm and cause a fresh rush
into goods. Unless more pro-
gress in U.S. Federal economy
has been made than seems likely,
or the defence programme is to
be reduced in scope and timing
more than the country suspects,
the forthcoming Budget for the
fiscal year 1953 will show a huge
deficit, most of which will fall
in the last six months of 1952.
The first essential of anti-
inflationary policy is to hold the
deficit to the minimum by
further curtailment of expendi-
tures, both by reducing non-
defence categories and cutting
out waste in defence. The
second essential is to finance the
Treasury’s needs by drawing on
savings and genuine investment
funds, and avoiding an inflation-
ary expansion of credit.
In last analysis, what people
think of the outlook will govern
their behavior. A demonstra-
tion of resolute intention to halt
depreciation of the dollar,
through Government economy
and vigorous fiscal and credit
policies, and a real stabilisation
of wages within the present
formula of the Wage Stabilisa-
tion Board, would not only re-
duce actual inflationary pressure.
It would also encourage saving
and restraint by people and
business everywhere.

“K.R.”; Friday, Jan. 25. The day on
which Sydney, with a maximum of
105.8 deg., had its highest temperature
since 1942. The day on which four men
were burnt to death, 40 or more injured
and nearly 100 homes destroyed in the
frightful bushfires. The day on which
two men died from the heat in Sydney
and 46 others collapsed. My entry for
the year’s classic understatement: Johnny
Moyes, the same day, beginning his “com-
ments” over the air just before the start
of the fifth cricket Test against the West
Indies —“It’s fine and warm in Sydney
today”!
♦ ♦ ♦ •
“W.M.H.”: I am all for encouraging
the sporty youth, but the other evening,
noticing a tiny-tot in a pram, parked in
the middle of the road, dangerously close
to the batsman’s flashing blade, I shifted
the pram to the comparative safety of
deep fine leg, and lectured the erring
“nursemaid” on the dangers of leaving
baby brother stranded in the middle of
the road. A crowd of protesting urchins
surrounded me; the batsman glared and
complained, “What y’ have to do that
for, mister? You’ve gone and pinched
our bloomin’ wicket!”
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: Vested rights seem
to grow in everything. Years ago an
s.-p. bookie known to me died; he had
started in a small way in the G.P.0.,
where he originally worked, extended his
clientele to neighboring banks and
offices until it grew so big that he had to
resign his mundane job, and established
it in a bigger way in the growing subur-
ban district where, out of the profits, he
had built himself a fine home. In that
district he had become the s.-p. tsar,
keeping his city end going through
agents ; his name was somewhere near the
head of every charitable sub. in his dis-
trict, his children went to Sunday school,
and he was a highly-regarded citizen.
On his death some of &is agents thought
they saw a chance for themselves; but
those who saw no opportunity of being
top-dogs reckoned that the business be-
longed to his widow (who knew something
about it), and they and most of the clients
gave the would-be interlopers short shrift.
After some years of widowhood one of
her principal henchmen induced her to
marry him; but he wasn’t too well
liked, and business fell off; there was a
general joy when the s.-p. lady woke up
to him, turned him out of her home, and
announced that he was no longer part of
the organisation. The battle over bis
effort to grab at least part of the business
is now over; the schemer, completely
routed, has disappeared from the scene,
and the lady s.-p.-er’s business is better
than ever. A notable feature of
the struggle was that while the lady’s
agents had the usual immunity, those of
the interloper were continually being
grabbed. Now the lady proposes to
retire; a group of her leading agents are
arranging to buy the goodwill from her.
The nominal sum (payments to extend
over 15 years) is quite staggering.

“Bagot”'; Chargedswith drunken driv-
ing, a Perth motorist pleaded he had
parked the car in a quiet suburban street
to await the clearing of the fumes of
many beers from his head. Approached
for an urgent lift into the city, he had
allowed a stranger to take the wheel;
and later came a collision which brought
traffic-police and caused the prompt de-
parture of the mysterious hitchhiker.
The charge was dismissed, but it is a safe
bet than an icy reception by Westralian
magistrates awaits the next bloke unlucky
enough to have a similar experience.

“Irving”; Sunburn causes the weekly
loss of more than a million production
man-hours by those who put their faith
in the acquisition of a coat of protective
tan by graduated doses of exposure.
Unfortunately, some folk are cursed with
a tender corneum, and no amount of
judicially lengthened periods of exposure
can remedy the defect. Old Sol stages
an insidious campaign against these con-
genitally thin-skinned ones, lulling them
into a sense of false security by his
exploratory barrage of long rays which,
though penetrating right down to the
basic layer of the skin, are quite
harmless. With his victims comfortably
comatose, he then pours in the short
ultra-violet rays, whose lethal power lies
in their very brevity. These penetrate
no further than the middle layers of skin,
where they do an effective job of
demolishing the capillaries!, leading in
some cases to the destruction of the
living cells and the absorption
of the decomposed particles in
the blood stream, with resultant chills
and fevers and, in some cases, death. The
belief that the severer incidence of sun-
burn on cloudy days is due to the victims
having been trapped into exposing them-
selves for extended periods is fallacious.
The severer casualties are the result of
the u.v. rays being further shortened by
atmospheric conditions, with attendant
stepping-up of their punching-power.

“Bosun’s Mate”: Seeing that it’s open-
season for Yank-sniping (and I’m not
denying the justification for it), I’d like
to record my impression of a trio of
Yanks in Darwin that day of the first
raid. U.S. destroyer Peary had been
caught at anchor by a brace of dive-
bombers. A sitting-shot, they laid her'
wide open, and fired her from stem to

stern. She was one vast boiling mass of
flame and smoke, with the oil-scummed
water for yards around burning, too.
Down went her bow ; her stem was kept
up only by a temporary air-lock. On
the steeply-pitching deck, barely able to
stand, hidden every few moments by the
acrid smoke, toiled three gunners, firing
desperately at the planes still coming in.
With one hand, holding on with the other,
one rammed a shell home. The other
two, layer and trainer, got it off. They
had no sooner done so than the air-lock
collapsed. Peary took a sudden and
definite dive under, taking the last three
with her. Whatever those gunners may
have lacked in the way of spit-and-polish
discipline, they certainly had a plenitude
of guts.

“Qui”: Many years ago the
permanent-temporary assistant at Stroud
(N.S.W.) public school was absent from
duty for a fortnight through illness. She
submitted the usual application for leave,
but without the customary medical-
certificate ; a footnote explained that a
doctor’s visit to her home, some miles
over the hills, would have cost more than
a fortnight’s salary. She had never heard
“You complained about it running away yesterday ."
of Rachel Henning, who while living at
“The Peach Trees,” five or six miles
from Stroud, 60 years earlier was visited
by her sister and baby nephew, who con-
tracted croup. Rachel recorded that they
risked the croup because of the expense
of bringing the doctor all the way from
Stroud,

“Wingella”; Every few months an out-
cry arises over the bridge
which crosses the railway-
line at Daly-street, Darwin,
a mere 17ft. in width, with
twisting S-curves at each
approach, and many feet off
alignment from the streets
which lead up to it. Built in
1913, soon after the Com-
monwealth assumed control
of the Northern Territory, it
had a clearance of only
13ft. 9in. above the railway-
line, and when large and
heavy machinery was un-
loaded at the wharf to be
transported by rail to Vestey’s
meat-works, the drivers of the
engines discovered that the
machinery was too large to
pass under the bridge. The
machinery could only be
transported by rail; the
engineer who had built the
bridge suggested jacking-up
the bridge. But to jack-up
the bridge might mean
weakening the trusses which
supported it. An old Terri-
torian, a railway worker, said
“You can’t lift up the bridge,
but what about lowering the
permanent - way?” The
permanent-way was lowered
file requisite distance, the
rails relaid, and the train,
with the machinery, passed
under the bridge in safety.
The dip in the line remains
there, permanently, but few who see that
curve ever realise why.

“Pat”: An article comparing Aus-
tralians and American teen-agers stated
that the former were a far more polite
tribe than their Yankee opposites. The
writer instanced an evening in an
American home when the teen-age son
and daughter requested her to move
from her chair, since it was their favorite
for watching the television show. At a
Sydney dinner-party I was surprised when
the two teen-age sons of my host sat at
the heads of the table while mother and
father meekly hunched their limbs round
table-legs. “It’s the only way we can get
them to eat their meads properly,” ex-
plained mother. “If I place them on the
sides their feelings are hurt and they go
on strike.”

“Russ”: In 1908, when I was a
lass of 20, there was a man named
Huie managing Buckingbong Station,
near Narrandera. He was by way of
being a good weather prophet, and I re-
member at times his prophecies were
published in the Narrandera “Argus.” It
became then a regular thing to exclaim
“Send her down, Huie,” whenever rain
fell. Some years ago this controversy
was discussed in The Bulletin columns,
but X always understood that was the
true origin of “Send it down, Huie.”

her associates, whilst ostensibly joining in
the search for the ghost. An American
phenomenon which took longer to ex-
plain was the appearance of the Madonna
in mid-air in a New York back-alley, at
regular times, to thousands, causing
traffic jams, and recorded by cameramen.
The local parish priest noted in the dress
of the apparition markings identical with
those on a"statue in his own church. He
then noticed that the vision’s appearances
and disappearances coincided with the
draping and undraping of the statue of
the Virgin in his own church. From then
on it was comparatively easy to trace
the apparition to a freakish combination of
light refractions,; though the chapel was
several blocks removed from the scene of
the seemingly miraculous manifestation.

“W.P.T.”: Wet weekends may bump
up the telephone revenue in Tasmania
(“O’Johnno,” B. 9/1/’52), but they have
the opposite effect in the Sydney suburbs.
A fine Saturday means a line-up outside
telephone-booths before every race
while stay-at-home-punters have their
five-bob-each-way with their s.p. bookies.
It’s the same on Saturday night when
“the dogs” are on, but when wet
weather postpones a meeting you can
gossip for half-an-hour in the public
telephone-box and nobody will complain.
Stay there more than a couple of minutes
when the races are on and you’ll cause
a riot.

“Bo”: That music-while-you-work is
an excellent tiring with which to relieve
some of the awful boredom attendant
on the performing of such as process
work f can’t be denied; but equally
irrefutable is that the radio can be a
positive danger to the skilled craftsman,
especially if absentminded. In proof of
which I cite a sad case. Bill was a glass-
blower, doing the early-morning shift.
Getting fed up with the endless run of
hillbilly-and-yawp disks, someone twirled
the selector-knobs and got on to a station
doing a physical-jerks session. An
ex-Army p.-t. instructor. Bill took a huge
breath in response to the announcer’s
call, and inhaled half the crystal water-
jug he’d just commenced blowing.

“Villefair”: In a most ineffectual voice
the elderly lady was calling after the girl
who, well down the street, strode station-
wards. “Oh, dear,” lamented the dis-
tressed old soul, “she’s gone without her
lunch, and L can’t make her hear.” A
long-asleep Boy Scout within me arose.
I took the brown paper-bag. Gosh, that
girl could walk! The gap extended. You
can’t go racing down the street yelling
“Shake it up or I'll miss that train!"
“Oy, oy! ” after a young female; and
middle-aged men who whistle in the wake
of flappers get themselves talked about.
I tried telepathy. It’s a failure. Having
passed the mayor’s place we were now
walking on a concrete path. The girl
must have heard my hurrying footsteps;
she half turned, then walked even faster.
I’m no runner, but I had to do something.
There is nothing so contagious as run-
ning— to people who catch workmen’s
trains. My jog-trot started the whole
street. The girl heard the stampede. I
saw her glance at her watch, evidently
decide it was slow, then leap into the
handicap. Youth was on her side; she
outstripped the field, “I’ll get her on the
station,” I thought. Wrong again. I
arrived in time to see her beat the guard’s
bell by a flicker —and catch the earlier
train. That’s how I came to have two
lunches —or rather, one lunch and a
snack that would have starved a dieting
canary.

“Melb’n”: Melbourne sharks aren’t
up to Sydney standard, A newly-installed
siren at Elwood blared forth its warning
when a 12ft. monster was detected; but
it was the shark that was in trouble. It
was so busily occupied with a school of
dolphins, which tossed it clean into the
air several times and chased it from
Elwood to Brighton and back again to
St. Kilda, that it hadn’t time to think of
bathers. The battle raged for an hour
and ended in the defeat of the maneater,
which was seen on its last fins mak-
ing seawards. A few minutes later the
siren went off for a really redoubtable
menace—a swarm of jellyfish which had
edged in-shore.

“F.S.”: Dunlop Rubber came out with
a sensible rejoinder to the charge of Alan
McCulloch, Melbourne “Herald” critic,
that they “had come out into the open
as champions of pictorial and representa-
tional art.” I suppose what he meant was
that the company was out with its £lOOO
competition to get pretty pictures for its
calendars. What is wrong with that?
Weren’t popes and cardinals in the great
age of art out to get pretty pictures for
their churches, and weren’t grand dukes
out to get pretty pictures and statues of
themselves and their wives and mis-
tresses? The awards have proved that
Dunlop Rubber isn’t in any way cheap
in its definition of prettiness ; it changes
its judges each year to ensure that all
schools get a hearing; and if it prefers
“rarely-treated Australian subjects in an
idiom which could be called Australian
in character” it seems a very reasonable
sort of preference. At least that sounds
like a search for originality instead of a
mere hunt for copies of the latest
European fashions.

“Edx”: Although most of the world’s
gold is extracted these days by chemical
processes, quite a lot is still won by
gravity separation from a watery pulp of
the crushed ore or sand in much the
same way as in ancient times. It is more
than 3*ooo years since a young man
named Jason, at the head of a gang of
cutthroats, set out from Thessaly on a
deliberate gold-robbing expedition to the
farther end of the Black Sea, where he
had heard there’d been a minor rush.
They arrived to find a thriving show run
by a man called /Eetes, who received
them hospitably enough and showed
them around the mine. Gold was won
by washing river-bed gravel down sloping
wooden troughs lined on the bottom
with sheepskins, the gold sinking and
being retained among the wool-fibres.
The general supervisor at the mine was
/Eetes’ mother-in-law, a tough old battle-
axe who reputedly never slept. Jason
took a job on a farm while he thought
things out. A good-looking lad, and as
crafty as any Greek before or since, it
wasn’t long before he had won the affec-
tions and willing aid of the' trump’s
talented daughter Medea. Together they
plotted, and plotted well. On the even-
ing before clean-up day was due on the
mine Medea plied her grandmother with
home-made gin, and late in the night,
while the old lady lay hopelessly be-
calmed on a sea of alcohol, Jason and
his mates swooped on the concentrating-
house, tore from the strakes the gold-
laden skins, and, with the roused Axles
S(D
"Cripes! This is th' best lot o' D.T.'s I've ever had!"
in futile pursuit, raced for their ship and
got clean away.

“K.”: “Egyptian ‘Times,’ tomorrow’s
news; very good news today. Lord
Kitchener dead” —what old Digger
doesn’t remember it? —has been recording
the offence of a Cairo student against
the modem Gyppo law forbidding kissing
by strangers in a public place. The youth,
it appears, was charged with kissing the
outside of a railway-carriage window in
the Cairo railway-station, intending the
kiss for a girl on the other side of it. The
window-pane could not be produced in
court for examination, and the defence
was that there was no direct evidence of
any kiss and that, anyway, the youth was
too short to reach up to the window.
A lower court let him off ; someone bent
on preserving the lofty tone of Egypt’s
moral standards continued the fight by
taking it* to a court of appeal, which fined
the accused 100 “disasters” for com-
mitting an immoral act. The highest
Gyppo court, the Court of Cassation,
has now reviewed the case and referred it
back to the court of appeal to discover
whether there was any window, and if so
how far off the ground-level. The re-
ports do not make clear wherein the in-
morality lay, since the girl wasn’t kissed
anyway; perhaps it lay in offering a
temptation to King Farouk, if he should
hear of it, to have the seductive lady
paraded before him, with consequential
irresistible urge to bigamy.

“Lyle”: Australian writers of westerns
who excel American exponents (B.
16/l/’52) have English counterparts.
These English circus cowboys, called
“Brixton cowboys,” because their head-
quarters are in that London suburb, can
perform feats in rope-spinning, trick-
riding and shooting, and other arts of
the cowboy, that put them in the class of
the American masters. There is an
interesting account of in A. F.
Tschiffely’s Bohemia Junction. The
fraternity owed its origin to Senor Carlos
Mier, a Mexican charro (cowboy), who
came to England with Buffalo Bill’s Wild
West show, and stayed on. During
World War I he broke-in particularly re-
fractory remounts at Market Harbdrough
for the British Army. When the war
ended he formed his own wild-west
troupe, mainly young Englishmen. After
a time he turned to the training of per-
forming dogs and pigeons, at which he
was very successful. Some of his cow-
boy pupils carried on, and taught the art
to others. Hence “Brixton cowboys.”

“Woody”: I have distaste for Aus-
tralian women who, suffering’a hangover
from the American invasion of 1941-45,
refer to our streetcars, sidewalks, candy
and lootenants. But I thought one woman
of my acquaintance was on uncertain
ground when she scolded her schoolboy
son for the excessive use of “mighty.”
The lad spoke of a “mighty game,” said
he felt “mighty fine” after it. The pedantic
parent claimed that such expressions were
Anglo-Texan rather than Anglo-Saxon,
and demanded their discontinuance, wi
the reminder that English literature was
rich enough in expressive language tor
anybody. What would she think or
Samuel Pepys? _ In one page of descnp-
tion in his Diary of a country walk
we find “mighty pretty, content him-
self mightily,” “mighty pretty again.
“mighty thankful,” “values his dog
mightily,” “mighty thankful,” and again
in a paragraph describing a jolly evening,
“mighty merry” twice and “mighty
sleepy.”

“C. Cure’’: May I suggest that either
Norman Lindsay is in error or else I have
married countless couples “wrong way round
during a quarter-century as a practising clergy-
man. In depicting Biddulph Henning meeting
his bride at the chancel steps (B. 26/12/’5l)
the artist has placed groom and best man to
the right of chancel, whence he is going to
dash between parson and bride to take his
allotted stand at her right hand for the ceremony.
At the same time Papa Tucker will be forced to
step back and between bride and bridesmaids to
take his place behind and somewhat to the
bride’s left side. In the usual run of events
the bride, entering the church on her father’s
right arm, comes to stand at her groom’s left
side, all with a minimum of confusion. From
the chancel she proceeds to the altar, and thence
to the vestry, still on his left arm, but, after
the signing of the register, leaves the church
on his right arm. One theory for this procedure
is the suggestion that, at least since the time
of young Lochinvar, or even earlier, the groom
needed to have his right arm free to draw his
sword if need be. After the register is signed,
presumably, attack would avail naught—the
knot being tied. My wife, however, suggests
that, as the bride is always to the left of the
aisle and the groom to the right, it means that
relatives of the respective parties are always
able to pick either “the bride’s side” or “the
groom’s side” during the ceremony.

“Clooter”: One of those “special
writers” let himself go in a Melbourne
paper about the general noise of the
city, and listed the worst as road vehicles,
trains, trams, motor-bikes, radios, bark-
ing dogs, night-prowling cats and noises
from next-door. If in the last-named is
included the bloke with an electric lawn-
mower I’m with him. However, the
point about all these noises is that, for
the most part, they’re spasmodic. Traffic
slows down, dogs and cats fall silent,
even the radio stops sometimes. But
there is one noise that defies me while it
drives me mad. It always occurs in the
silence of the night, when I’m trying to
sleep, and though I frequently rise and
attack the source, all I get is temporary
relief, for the moment I return to bunk
it starts again. You can stop a dripping
tap or a creaking blind or a burbling
lavatory cistern, but whatinell can you do
about a mouse inside the wall which is
convinced that the best place for it to
gnaw its way out is just alongside the
head of your bunk?

“Hamfat”: There was yet another
Dorothy Dix (B. 16/l/’52) who might be
remembered by some Australasians and
may still be alive. She was a relation of
some sort of the Dix who had a vaude-
ville circuit in New Zealand with head-
quarters at the Theatre Royal, Welling-
ton, before the rise of the Fullers gave
it an eclipse; Dix afterwards ran a
vaudeville-house in N.S.W., at Newcastle.
Dorothy was a merry little lady who
could be a capable actress in soubrette
parts, but was chiefly known as a mimic ;
but she faded out of the theatrical
picture. Probably she married.
TOO BLOOMING RIGHT.
“Devotees often adopt a blase attitude to other
hobbies and pastimes. But for true enthusiasm and
devotion to his love witness the gardener admiring
a beautiful plant.” —Horticultural article.
The long-marker takes up his stance,
And does his prelimin’ry prance.
At end of his flailing
His pill goes a-sailing
As straight and as true as a lance,
Ending up (and how strange!) to within
Half a foot of the far-distant pin. •?
Does he leap round, ecstatic?
Nay, nay. He’s phlegmatic,
For golf breeds a self-discipline.
And keen though your fisherman be,
Ah! Never demonstrative he.
He keeps a cool napper
Though a thirty-pound snapper
He may have just landed, you see.
When the mammoth, magnificent jew
That he’s hauling in swims into view,
And a blue-pointer snavels
The catch on his travels—
He simply looks bored, and that’s true.
But the gardener, in bud or full-blown.
Is in a class all of his own.
His zeal is titanic.
Infectious, galvanic,
While never to gloom is he prone.
With what joyousness die-back he snips,
And regards all his well-nourished thrips!
The sight of sick seedlings
And strong, sturdy weedlings
Brings never a curse from his lips.
Though in flowers that he’s picked he takes
pride,
Or the lettuce-head, solid and wide,
, It’s for plants he’s reserving
Affection unswerving—
And this no one’s ever decried.
But of all plants, the one he likes best —
And this you’ll have probably guessed—
He keeps ’neath the wattle:
Oh, just an odd bottle;
Its beauty he’ll always attest.

ABORIGINALITIES
“The Bunyip”: Long ago young
Arthur was one of the most fervent
fishermen I have ever known, but appar-
ently he found time for other pursuits,
for he got himself married. The honey-
moon was by the sea, and an early stroll
ended at the jetty, and before long out
came a line and Arthur settled motion-
less at the visible end of it. The little
missus stood by loyally for a while, then
began to fidget, and finally asked: “Arty,
are you going to stay there looking silly
all day?” Whereupon an ancient member
of the brotherhood took his pipe from
his mouth and spake: “Crack ’er!” he
said, “If you don’t want to crack ’er in
public, take ’er ’ome and crack ’er ; but
if y’ don’t crack ’er now, son, y’ll never
go fishin’ again—so crack ’er!” Lost
track of them for years, but last holi-
days came across them in the mountains.
They both looked prosperous, the four
youngsters healthy but obedient, all
apparently well content, except for an
elusive wistfulness that sometimes
fluttered near the surface in the conversa-
tion of the otherwise successful business-
man. Yarning apart, I asked him how
the fishing was up his way, but he
changed the subject. He’d never
“cracked” her.

“Solitude”: The dogs had a Too below
us in the creck-bed, and were kicking up
a considerable din. “Come out of it, y’
useless pair o’ mongs,” bawled Seventy-
fiver. “Come behind ’ere, can’t y’! ” The
barking continued. “Come orf it. Come
be’ind.” “Aw, let ’em go,” I chipped in.
“They can’t hear you, anyway.” “Well,
they got no right devilin’ that thing,”
growled the old bloke. “The pore little
animal’s got a right to live, ain’t he?
Gripes, them
mongs might
kill ’im. I’m
goin’ down.”
He rode as
far as he
could, then,
still bawling
himself
hoarse,
hitched his hack and clambered down
the steep side to the creek-bed. There he
grabbed a waddy and delivered it on the
rump of each mong, to the accompani-
ment of a pointed and very personal
lecture on behavior. The Too, heartened
by the comparative lull, left the water,
spotted the old bloke in his path, and
let drive with a hind-foot. His claws
caught in Seventyfiver’s shirt, ripped
downwards and ended on his boot. It
wasn’t the scratch from ribs to hoof that
did it —that would heal in time —and
possibly even the shirt-damage might
have been overlooked ; but the complete
destruction of his new 35-bob pants was
too much; and last I saw of the old
coot he was travelling all-out up the creek
in the wake of the Too. He had a waddy
in one fist, and was bellowing blue
murder at the dogs to come and help
“kill the ruddy cow.”

“Nor’-west”; What is the span of
cetacean life? Possibly the whale-
marking now being carried out by the
Commonwealth Fisheries research vessel
Warreen (B. 9/1/’52) may tell us some-
thing about the age of the average hump-
back. According to an American
authority, the life of the sperm-whale is
surprisingly short —a mere eight to nine
years. In his Moby Dick Herman
Melville speaks of a prehistoric stone
THE OPTIMIST.
harpoon being found in the blubber of
a whale, inferring that the cetacean had
a lifespan of centuries. The blue-whale,
according to modem authority, does a
little better ; the largest mammal that has
ever lived on this globe, either on land
or in water, occasionally reaching a
length of 100 ft., it appears to live only
20 years. The finback, an 80-footer in
adulthood, generally reckoned the fastest
of all the baleen tribe, has much the
same life-expectation. If these estimates
are correct, then the whale must eat
prodigiously and grow at fantastic speed.
The growing sperm, it is said, eats a ton
of flesh a day, its food being cephalopods,
squid and octopus. This estimate was
arrived at by old-time whalers hunting
the sperm with harpoon and lance. In
its death-flurry the dying sperm often
brought up the contents of its stomach,
masses of cephalopod flesh that floated
and could be readily estimated.

“Anthropo”: The abos who buried
Burdekin plums to make them eatable
(B. 2/1/’52) used a similar process in
dealing with the fruit of the zamia palm.
Both fruit and nut are highly poisonous
when shed green from the low-growing
palm, which carries its fruit in a head
not unlike a. pineapple in form. The
nuts, squarish in shape and about the
size of a thumb, are covered with a
thick, fleshy rind. To eliminate toxic
properties the green nuts were soaked in
a small muddy waterhole for a week or
so. In some curious way the clay in
the water neutralised the poison. Now
blue in color, the fruit was baked in the
ashes. With the rind eaten off, the nut
was given further treatment. Cracked by
a blow between two stones so as to admit
the water, it was given another week or
so, after which (if not required at the
time) the nuts were stored in a granary,
arm-deep holes in the ground, and
covered with earth. It was just such a
granary (which refutes the old charge
made against the abo. that he was
incapable of making commissariat pro-
vision for the future) that saved Lieut.
George Grey from starvation in 1839
when returning to Perth from a disastrous
exploring expedition. It was his native
guide who uncovered it some 40 miles
south of what is now Geraldton.

“Macquarie”; Any simpleton can be
the social secretary of a sports club in
the city, but you’ve got to be smart to
hold the job down in a flourishing rural
district like Gerringong, South Coast
(N.S.W.). The small township boasts a
Soldiers’ Memorial Hall, a friendly little
place which is quite big enough for its
purpose ; but for the social event of the
whole year—the New Year’s Eve Ball —
there can be only one venue: the Town
Hall, An imposing structure of plastered
brick, painted white, the building would
knock spots off many a similar hall in
Sydney’s poshest suburbs, and is the
civic pride of Gerringong, having undis-
puted priority on every postcard bearing
folding views. It is the fine dance-floor
and expanse of internal space, however,
that make it the golden apple amongst
social secretaries. In the 1951 stakes the
cricket club beat the golf club to it by a
short head. It was nice work. But the
victorious social secretary was even more
far-sighted. Even as the juvenile 1952
was being welcomed he booked the hall
12 months ahead. A master-move indeed
—if he had not overlooked the fact that
the current year is a Leap Year and the
last day will fall on a Wednesday. The
picture-showman holds the lease for all
Wednesday and Saturday nights. It
looked like the end —until the social sec-
retary got an inspiration. What was
wrong with booking the hall from mid-
night till dawn? “Nothing,” he was
informed. “Go ahead.” But inspirations
also come to golfers, footballers and surf-
clubmen. A peaceful settlement, it
appears, will only be reached by the good
old Aussie method involving four pieces
of paper and a hat.

“Bad Australian”: It is quite true that
certain types of eucalypt (B. 16/1/’52)
appear only on limited areas, but this
should not be regarded as an indication
that those trees would not thrive under
different conditions. The first eucalypts
grown in South America were propagated
from seed taken to Valparaiso by Chilian
wheat ships when the village by the
Tank Stream depended on Chile for
grain to feed its convict population.

“the Dog
" I ain't gonna feed 'im — I'm gonna dong ’ im !”
Since then the trees have become accli-
matised over the greater part of the con-
tinent, and the good work still goes on.
Eucalypts are well established on the
otherwise treeless pampas of Argentina,
and in Uruguay and southern Brazil,
I have seen bluegums and other
eucalypts flourishing on a little oasis in
the Desert of Atacama, 8000 ft. above sea-
level, and on the Great Plateau of the
Central Andes at 12,000 ft., where the
temperature varies from 90 degrees at
midday to zero a couple of hours after
sunset. Making an examination of a
plantation of some 20 varieties of euca-
lypts growing in the practically rainless
province of Mendoza, Argentina, on
irrigated land reclaimed from the adjacent
sage-and-cactus desert, I was surprised to
find specimens of blackbutt, messmate
and mountain-ash, which have their
natural habitat on our high mountain
country, associated with redgum, iron-
bark and yellow-box, typical lowland
vegetation. The plantation was about
12 years old, and the trees varied in
height according to species, the highest
being from 85ft. to 90ft.

“Charbro”: I am surprised that
“Salmon Gums” (B. 16/1/’52) was not
surprised to hear of a woman in Cali-
fornia who grows 2000 types of euca-
lypts. All the authorities I have read
place the number of species of eucalypts
at figures varying between 500 and 700.
Furthermore, of this number only part
would grow in one particular locality. It
looks as if the Californian figure carries
one too many naughts. Seeing that the
eucalypt is the dominant feature of the
Australian environment, it is surprising
how few know the significance of the
name. Since coming upon it by chance
only a few years ago, I’ve put the ques-
tion to several score of people, town and
country. Not one person knew. In all
eucalyptus buds the stamens are pro-
tected by a clearly-defined cap, which is
pushed off by the stamens when the bud
breaks into flower. Throughout the
remarkable variety of shapes of euca-
lyptus buds this cap (itself varying very
much in shape) is always present. When
this unique feature was observed by
L’Heretier, an 18th-century botanist, he
remarked to himself “Well covered.”
Translating this phrase into ancient
Greek —Eu kaluptos —he gave us the
name of the tree.

“One B.”: Not only should the tail-
end of St. John’s wort (B. 16/l/’52) be
pronounced “wyrt,” as “M.P.” says, but
the head of it should be “Sinj’n.” This
goes in harness with Sinclair (St. Clare),

it all ready in stacks”) of Gilbert and
Sullivan’s sorcerer, John Wellington
Wells, “at 70 Simmery [St. Mary] Axe.”

“Old-timer”: Don’t know how
Dolmareve Plain got its name or what
the name means (B. 30/1/’52). In lonely
country like that origins and meanings
become lost, and even when they can be
traced often have such humdrum founda-
tions as to make the search worthless.
There is the classic Katamatite, which
looks like abo. but isn’t, being merely a
corruption of “Kate, am I tight?”—a
query supposedly addressed to his wife
by an inebriated man under some lost
and forgotten circumstance. And
Windulva. When Ghallager wrote to me
from Mildura, saying he was building
drying-racks at Windulva, the name
looked so attractively native, but was yet
so different from the general run of
Murray abo. names, that I got Ghallager
to look into it. It was merely that the
owner had three daughters, Winnie,
Dulcie and Vera, and made the name
from theirs. This isn’t to suggest that
Dollie, Marie and Eva could have been
responsible for the Plain; the name
doesn’t seem Spanish to me and I doubt
if Shakspeare heard of it. Then, again,
names become corrupted: What its
founder named Joyous Garde, in Queens-
land, is now George s Yard. And what
once appeared on old-time dance pro-
grammes as Valse de Vienna is now
referred to by nostalgic persons as the
“old varsoo-vianna.”

She whose need is a dingo’s fang;
The striking snake in its scarlet mood;
She, the demented, the barren one.
Her bright train slithers over the hill.
Her girdled waist is a rope of embers.
She leaps to the root of her blood’s desire:
The seed, the stem that her blood remembers.
She has taken the sap in her furnace mouth;
She has charred the leaf in her flame-heaped
hand;
She is left alone with murder and theft;
Thirsty she mourns in a bumed-out land.
But the pee-wit’s sorrow, the autumn rain,
Whisper contempt, sharp as a thorn:
“See her bent back! See her torn train!
She, the sun’s strength, is an old mad crone
Who would take the seed from the summer,
And bear it as her own!”

“Billy T.”; The square-dancing started
it. The Regans used to go to the local
hops and were just one of the ordinary
couples till the advent of the hillbilly
imitation of the old-time sets; then it
was noted that Mum Regan’s normally
blank dial lit up when she was being
swung by Charlie Barnes. Charles, too,
seemed to appreciate the change from
his own earbashing spouse; and other
tongues began to wag when the new
partners clung together through what
should have been a progressive bam-
dance. Dinny Regan, to the shame of his
race, didn’t lift a hand about it —“If
everybody’s havin’ a good time, well,
that’s what we come for” —but Mrs. B.
seethed. Yet anything she had for
Charlie’s ear hit it in private. It wasn’t
long before Charles was going to the
dances by himself, and though his missus
never lacked for reports of the proceed-
ing, she appeared to have accepted the
new situation stoically until the other
morning, when all ears for half a mile
round suddenly cocked to the sounds of
battle in Regan’s backyard. There was
a din as of the booting of many tins and
tubs, then a clothes-prop swung high and
came down wallop across the washing,
half-dry in the morning breeze. Mum B.
tramped home breathing hard and
decorated with sundry torn rags. “Them
two! ” she snorted. “If they want to make
fools o’ themselves in public they can,
but I’m not goin’ to sit ’ere an’ see ’is
shirt flappin’ from ’er line!”

“5.D.8.”: The venerable chook —the
only one on the place—struts about with
complete one-of-the-family status. Also
a member of the family, in addition to a
black cocker and an old cattle-dog, is a
young fox-hound of massive proportions
but amiable disposition. When the egg-
laying urge
is upon the
chook she
makes for
Jack’s kennel
and a n -
nounces her
intention. If
i n occupa-
tion, Jack
merely shifts his big body over as far
to one side as possible, and Biddy
settles down in the vacant area. Her
contribution to man’s dietetic needs is
promptly gulped by the hound. A
second and smaller kennel made for, but
not used by, the black cocker was recently
placed alongside Jack’s, and Biddy im-
mediately decided to use the smaller un-
occupied nesting-place. Jack’s efforts at
the end of his chain, trying to reach a
long paw into the opening of the smaller
kennel and hooking out the tasty meal,
and his whining protests at the change
were comical to behold. He finally
managed it by pulling his whole kennel
around on an angle. Now happy again,
he merely watches closely from his own
bailiwick until the laying is accomplished,
and carries on as before.

“Iniwent”: Inigo Jones (B. 26/12/’5l)
predicted: “The Bruckner cycle shows
rain over the greater part of Eastern
Australia in January, which should be
heavy in the tropic, but becoming
moderate as it moves south, and light in
South Australia and Western Australia.
In W.A. about the third week in January
a willy-willy may appear in the far
north, near Onslow.” The cyclone arrived
on schedule at the end of the third week.

“V.”: Dad’s new hand seemed willing
enough, careful and agreeable, and the
old bloke got on well with him the first
week. It was after the newie got his first
pay that he seemed to be considering
something, and one day Dad came home
“You should ’a' seen this place before the railway opened it up.”
to find him squatted idly on the wood-
heap. “What’s the matter, Tony?” he
asked suspiciously. “Aren’t you satisfied
about something?” “It da strike mon’,”
the newie explained. “Too much da strike.
Got hava da more mon’. Mon’ for da
matches.” “For matches? Gripes, you
buy your own flamin’ matches,” frowned
Dad, “then you won’t use so many. All
I have to buy you is the tools or anything
else that you use when you’re doing work
for me.” “All-a right,” agreed the hand
readily, “Your work, you find heem,
hey? Better mon’ for da match dan da’
danger-mon’. Danger-mon’ beeg, hey?”
“Danger-money me fat aunt!” Dad
snorted at him. “Helping me mend a
bit of fence isn’t dangerous. And bring-
ing the old milker in isn’t either; and
sorting a few spuds never killed anybody
that I know.” “No danger plenty da
match,” agreed the newie again. “But
strika da match go to work, strika da
match see da way home, heem too much.
You pay da matches for dat, hey?”

“Mat’s Mate”: “The worst bushfire I
ever ran into,” Mat said, “was at
Moonbi. That’s on the Lachlan, between
Forbes and Condobolin, and there’s two
or three of us in the little pub when a
bloke rushes in and yells ‘Fire!’ and we
rush out. She’s burnin’ east an’ south an’
gettin’ closer, so we look west, an’ strike
me if she don’t spring up there. The river
was on the north, but we can’t get across
because all the low, dry swamp between
the pub and the river is goin’ up in
flames. So there’s nothin’ else t’ do but
sit in the pub an’ wait for the end —which
was quick.” Mat fell silent, and Perkins
rushed in. “Well,” he demanded, “what
y’ mean, the end was quick—did the joint
go up?” “No, the end o’ the beer was
“ Yeah —hut how'll y' be if the wind drops?”
quick,” said Mat sadly. “The publican
only had a nine, an’ how long you reckon
that’d last with five of us goin’ it?”
* * * *
“Sou’-west”: Possibly those trevally
observed by “Loulalo” (B. 9/l/’52) were
indulging in a change of diet; more
likely they were engaged in what pro-
fessional fishermen call “schooling.”
This congregating in a big school is one
of nature’s devices whereby the ova shed
by the female is brought in contact with
the sperm shed by the males. Much the
same as when a cloud of male pollen, in
the case of many species of trees, floats
away in the breeze to make contact with
the female blossoms. With fish there is
no direct bodily contact —everything
drops into the water. And since the sea
is constantly in motion, currents and
waves, such would become dispersed and
lost were it not that at such times the
fish gather into a big school. Thus a
placid area is held wherein sperm and
ova may make contact with the minimum
of loss. And more to it than that: with
so many individuals gathered, the element
of cross-fertilisation, with its beneficial
results, is introduced. Thus when
“Loulalo” saw the mass of trevally rise
from the water like “a sheet of solid
silver and fall back with a loud splash,”
they were making sure of a tolerably
even dispersal of the elements of life right
through the school. The result of this is
often seen in an adult school, which will
seldom be of fish all the one size—the
result of cross-fertilisation. The fact that
the school of trevally ignored all baits
showed that they were engaged in the
most important of life’s functions.
* * * *
“Bo”; Dropped in on old Dick, who
has a kipsy on a riverfront blackberry
block, in time to see him putting Billo,
the sulphur-crested cockatoo who has
been his companion for as long as I can
remember, in his cage, on the floor of
which he had put some meat that was
overripe. Dick looked up as I came
along. “There, perhaps a spell with
that rotten meat under his conk’ll teach
the cow not to be so insultin’ in the
future,” he growled. “Why, what’s he
been doing?” I asked. “Well,” went on
Dick, “we was havin’ an argument a
bit ago, one thing led to another, an’
he called me an adjectival old blanker.
I wasn’t goin’ to stand for that, so I’m
punishin’ him.” “But, remember, Dick,”
I put in, “it’s probably just as much your
fault as his—and anyway, didn’t you
teach him to say ‘blanker’ in the first
place?” “Aw, it wasn’t the ‘blanker’ I
objected to,” said Dick aggrievedly, “it
was the hide o’ the swine callin’ me old,
when I know the blanket’s at least ten
years older’n me!”
* * * *
“Buckwheat”: The high-pressure car-
salesman was working on old Herb.
“This Vee Twelve job, Mr. Petersen,” he
said, “has overhead cam and twin
carburettors, automatically - variable
compression-ratio, which, working in con-
junction with the spark - advance, is
designed to give you terrific acceleration.
But this is definitely not only a sports-car
of distinction; it is also a luxuriously
appointed means of transport. Built-in
cocktail cabinet, completely dust-sealed
body, canary-touch steering, radio-set in
the rear seat-cushions, and the revolution-
ary clashomatic transmission.” Old
Herb seemed to be oblivious to the verbal
flood as he opened the rear-door. “Be
cripes she’s roomy, eh! ” The salesman
wasn’t slow to take his cue. “I’m very
glad you noticed that, Mr. Petersen. This
car is designed to accommodate six really
big men, with plenty of room to spare.”
The old cove puffed at his pipe for a bit.
“Well, y’ c’n put me down f’r one o’
these,” he said. “Y’ know, with all that
room in th’ back, I reckon a man’d get
four or five backfatters in there easy.”
* * * *
“Hist”: The little hamlet at the junc-
tion of the four straight dusty roads
reaching out among the stations and
wheatfarms consists of a siding and silo,
a couple of cottages, some pepper-trees
and Mulgan’s store, which is also the
post-office. Mulgan has been trying for
years to get a carpenter to fix the place
up a bit and build some extensions. It
was a surprise, therefore, to find the work
well under way, and I asked how he had
managed it. He made cautionary signals
and led me away to the pepper-tree across
the road. It appeared that a city bloke
dropped off the mixed one morning, came
across to ask Mulgan the way to where
he wanted to go—said he was to ring up
from here and they’d send a truck in for
him. Trouble was he couldn’t remember
the name of the people or the place,
and he’d lost the bit of paper on which
he had written it. “None of the names
I mentioned clicked,” said the store-
keeper. “The cove sits on his bag o’
tools under a tree, to wait for the mixed
back at night. Then I says: ‘Look, mate,
what about writing to the city for the
address, and doing a bit of a job for me
while you wait? I’ll fix you up with
tucker and a bunk and pay good wages.’
He agreed, and he’s doing a good job,
as you can see. He ought to finish some
time this month, an’ when he does I’ll
give him the letter that come for him last
week—it’s a shame the way they delay
mails to these little outback joints!”
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: Recently in Mel-
bourne a Perth choir-girl said she was
“homesick for the song of a kooka-
burra.” Probably very few Westralians
saw anything odd in the remark, for the
big laughster is as well-known around
Perth as the magpie, and it’s pretty well
forgotten that it isn’t a native of the big
State. It was introduced about 1896 by
Perth Zoo’s chief Le Soeuf, and it has
done so well that it prompts the question
why wasn’t it native to the State. The
answer is that probably it was, thousands
of years ago, but that it died out during
some vast climatic change in which con-
ditions became too hard and too dry
for not only it but quite a lot of other
fauna. Remains have been found in some
sou’-Westralian caves of wombat, koala
and the Tasmanian devil, showing that
these, at least, must have been pretty
well distributed once. There’s no reason
why the kookaburra shouldn t have been,
too.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: Easter Island, the Chilean posses-
sion in the South Pacific which the United
States wants as an air-base, is what Professor
MacMillan Brown of N.Z., the leading authonty
on it, called “the Riddle of the Pacific. To
unravel it the professor spent six months on
the speck, and devoted a whole volume to it.
The existence on it of statues, or rather portrait-
busts, 30ft. to 70ft. in height, cut in a very
hard volcanic stone, and transported at some
time or other from quarries ten or more mues
distant, has puzzled the anthropologists for
generations. MacMillan Brown estimated that
a population of at least 10,000, exclusively
occupied in the sculptural business, would have
been required to produce the portraits, as well
as the stone terraces made of enormous blocks
on which they are mounted. The nearest land
is Chile, 1000 miles away, and the small dot
of Pitcairn, of “Mutiny on the Bounty” fame,
1100 miles distant. The arid island harbors at
present about 400 fisherfolk and sheepfarmers,
and couldn’t have supported more on its own
resources since the dawn of history. To explain
this puzzle the professor advanced the theory
that it was once the official graveyard of a
master race, who occupied a large and fertile
archipelago of perhaps a million people, most
of them slaves. He explained the non-existence
of the archipelago on the assumption that it
had vanished underwater in some cosmic
upheaval, and cited Nauru, the phosphate island,
which has been up and down at least five times.
The master race, he says, were descendants ot
the Children of the Sun, the greatest monu-
mental masons in history, whose migration from
EavPt along the shores of Asia to the Pacific
has been traced by the Australian Grafton
Elliott Smith. The evidence for Brown s theory
includes an entry in a ship’s log of a 15th-
century English mariner who was blown oft his
course, and reported passing a vast C9asthne
which was illuminated at night by myriads ot
lights, indicating cities and towns and a large
population. It is a fascinating theory, which
can’t be proved; but no better explanation has
been given of one of the most inexplicable
bursts of human activity in history. The Aus-
tralian airman Captain P. G. Taylor landed on
the island on his exploratory flight across the
Pacific last year, and if Chile gives its permis-
sion the U.S. will no doubt erect in a few weeks
another sort of monument, which anthropologists
will be puzzling over when aeroplanes and
steamships have been atomised out of existence.
PIONEER HOUSE.
All away for ever now, man and wife and
sorrow;
Child has gone and dog has gone and clock
that makes tomorrow:
Time has taken time away; nails and planks
drop rotten;
The walls forget and, in the chimney, fire is
forgotten.
Since rain has rented emptiness and storm’s
unlocked the door
Slime and stain have brushed the runes of future
on the floor;
Crib has gone and brick will go with lintel.
joist and rafter,
And weed will plant his weeds within the dust
that follows after.
No knife will clink enamel plate, nor foot nor
tear will fall;
No face —but moon’s a looking-glass upon the
grid of wall.
Blinds of day and night will hang to keep out
night and day
Until the woodlouse and the years have gnawed
the past away.
Yet, in the garden frayed to air and each year,
at its hour,
From earth returned to earth there fights the
one domestic flower;
Fence has gone and cow has gone and wife with
green fingers,
But wizened, chastened, stubborn, the foreign
flower lingers.
See! In the rifted fireplace now flames the
green of grasses,
And on the sky a starling swarm spurts like a
smoke and passes,
And up from the doorstep’s sun and dream the
southerly vaults in joy—
Pathless runs to the petals of pain and cooees
like a boy.

I ought to be playing ducks-and-
drakes over the Rhone in a
howling hurricane.
“Impertinent fellow, that pro-
fessor,” I try. “No ethics.”
“I stand a lot of smooth
direction and smart photo-
graphy,” she says. “But I assess
characters unaided.” A tactless
"“My word.”
“You have a job up here?”
she asks. For something to ask.
“Agent for snow-wares. Steel-
lined ash skis, sharp at the curly
end. Suntan lotions, Kandahar
clamps, fur-lined bootlaces,
Clemens need an outfit?”
‘H’mm,” she intones. Briskly,
“Let’s ski to Leukerbad to-
morrow. Spa-bath in mud
after.”
“H’mm,”
“Must go ” I say.
“Good ” she says.
Still her turn to buy a drink.
BACK to routine research,
Seeking cleaner, better
worlds in beer-slops on the bar,
borrowing smokes, talking snow
with tired tyros. Admiring wall-
posters where Skifahrer heroes
use hickories for splints over
captions: Paralysis begins with
the first glass.
The starlet leads drowsy
Clemens away to slumber. The
hotel hostess steps in close to
give the professor another course
in mesmerism. Lacquered locu-
tion, lascivious lipstick, finger-
nails like flashes on redback
spiders; against a backdrop of
slumber rhumba numbers.
Books to borrow, etchings to
examine, fortunes to tell. Maybe
she can develop lines like
etymology or Shelley’s ode to
Mont Blanc.
ZERO hour. I pace a spongy
beat beside the starlet’s
suite. Senses serene as snow-
stormed Santis. I try the locked
door. I listen. Audible silence.
My brains buzz with cerebra-
tion. Or with something that
makes my brains buzz. A
figure approaches, noisy as
cigarettes in a pack. I melt into
shadows. Another molten
shadow.

The skating scholar says what
Zwingli _ said at Eureka. His
complexion bleaches dingo
yellow.
The starlet takes a deep
breath. A deep breath in a
chiffoned kimono does me no
good at all. “Is that your busi-
ness?” she asks.
I untwitch ears. The starlet
blinks hair out of the field of
vision. “Respectability is every-
one’s business,” I sermonise.
“Guests pay more for it.”
I show my certificate of
respectability, endorsed by the
hotel hostess. For hotel em-
ployees.
“Stickybeak,” says the skating
scholar.
“Hero,” I say, I handle
bribes better than jibes.
His chin is square as a ski-
boot toe, “Careful, little man,”
I advise. For want of a better
line.
He offers an elementary
stringy left, and I move fancily
to block. I block nothing but
the do or-jamb as I pull up tired
and weak as a lazy lover’s
letters.
“I’ve seen better during work
hours,” complains the screen
queen.
“Best I know,” apologises the
professor. A wistful fistful.
She gives us tea-cosy over-
slippers in case we have
trampled snow up from the
ladies’ lounge. She clinkles
cleverly at the cluttered bedside-
bar. Parchment lampshades
diffuse listless luminosity.
Outside the alpine bise is
whipping along snow-scoured
streets.
Cold as contented spinsters.
“Who are you?” asks the pro-
fessor. I slip him my card. The
one with the streak of lightning
in the corner.
He offers me his card. “Well
fix this later.”
“Deal me out this hand,” I
mouth with what is left of my
tongue.
“Ach, so,” says the professor.
“All right, laddie,” I snarl.
“The lady is my friend.”
“I’m watching you, too,
brother.” I let that slip by
unmolested.
SO we choose pews and lose
blues. Soon we are clasp-
ing goblets long as lovers’ fare-
wells. Pale purple and still
slightly warm from Sion’s sun-
soaked harvest. My head is full
of pregnant aroma of fertilised
farmland. Airy dairies full of
fetchin’ Gretchens. I see moun-
tainfuls of moonlit snow-mist.
Edelweiss in Upper Engadine,
cheesy gold of Lac Ldman sun-
sets.
I dream-drowse of vines,
ploughs, benign cows, divine
Fraus,
“Zum Wohl,” ejaculates the
professor.
“My word,” I adjoin.
Heartily.
“First time up here?” The
lady’s attention is for the pro-
fessor. Exclusively.
“First time. A treat I give
myself. Just finished a work on
Teutonic philology.”
“My word,” I agree. The
obtuse angle in the eternal
triangle,
“Published yet?” The lady
ignores me.
“Must find money first,” ex-
plains the professor. “Will have
to be published privately.”
“Could I offer you financial
assistance?” Incipient infatua-
tion has crystallised in the flatu-
lent fluid of the social set-up.
“You don’t know me,” pro-
tests the professor.
“I passed through Biella
during war years, professor.”
The professor is overcome.
Sentimentalism is rather more
than he can swallow. I dissolve
disgust in another draught of
Dole de Sion. Smooth as the
Kerry under new snow.
Every fifteen minutes the
battery of town clocks peals to
us.
When we leave daylight is
combing the conifers, pines are
flecked with flaming larch,
children are sliding in snow-
strewn streets. Mountain
kiddies never cease to be excited
by the miracle of snow.
Hoar frost forms on my
clothes.
I wonder how long the hotel
hostess waited. If I know her
type, it was all night.
NO need even for pheno-
barbs. I crawl offstage to
the constricted comfort of my
EDEN.
This is the grief of the heart—
that it can never be
closed in one flesh with its love,
like the fruit hung on Eve’s tree:
this the lament of the flesh—
that it must always contain
the uncompleted heart,
greedy of love and pain
—This is not what I desired—
the flesh in anguish cries;
—the gift that was made to me
in my lost Paradise,
where is predestined joy
and with a shock like death,
the two halves of my being
met to make one truth.—
Yet where the circle was joined
the desperate chase began;
where love in love dissolved
sprang up the woman and man,
and locked in the pangs of life
sway those unwilling selves
till the circle join again
and love in love dissolves.

couchette. In time for break-
fast on a tray. Nourishing as
Turkish tobacco.
I rattle eyeballs till they roll
in unisou. Then I climb out into
clear shining mountain morn. I
take a quick look at blue, blue
sky through filigree twigwork
of linden-trees. I give myself
a sting of coramine to dissolve
coagulated ketchup on the
tongue.
I pull Scandinavian barrel-
staves out from under the bed
where they are wrapped in the
“New Zurich Times.” Blow off
fluff and check for white-ants.
I rub blue-mould out of heel-
grooves in the ski-boots. Last
dubbined maybe when Ned
Kelly was a lad.
I try a few rough Christis as
a dummy run on the bedroom
floor. Pivot on the heels. Swing
those hips. Unscrew those eyes.
“What’s the trouble?” The
landlady is knocking on the
door. “You alone in there?”
I dissolve matutinal fatigue in
a hot tub, load my saccharine-
pistol right up to the muzzle,
burnish mahogany lustre on my
teeth and spend a lot of time
picking the right shade of skin
cream.
I shackle on shabby skis and
herringbone along main street
toward Primavera Hotel. Hardly
dropping a stitch. Past chalets
with ceilings that skim your
scalp, structural design uncon-
cealed for decoration. After
two blocks I stack the skis on
the shoulder. Just so no one can
say “Look who dropped in!”
I call on the professor. “Let’s
go ski-running,” I suggest.
He is not averse.
We ride the bergbahn
through sunstreaked spruce;
over rich carpets of autumn
leaves as far as Vermala Hotel.
We pay three francs for a
hitch on the ski-lift and gaze
over frigid fields to black ice of
Wildhorn’s towering tabernacle.
“Let’s go,” enthuses the pro-
fessor,
“Let’s wait,” I restrain him.
THE ski-lift tows the starlet to
our level. Even in the
clumsy grip of a shoddy lift the
starlet retains regal grace and
pride of place in the bright-eyed
attention of the delighted
professor.
“Surprise,” says the professor.
Magnificently.
“Pleasure,” says the starlet.
Munificently.
“Glad I packed three lunches,”
I tell myself.
Mrs. Awe has flawless form,
unhurried ways and queenly
gaze. Snooded hair like winter
sun on driven sand. Smooth
symmetry of Chianti bottles and
a shape, brother, like drug-
soaked dreams. I look at her
and catch my breath.
She adds chlorophyll sun-
shields to her snappy ensemble.
“Ski Heil” is mosaic-stitched
across sweater bumps. I gravely
check through for spelling
errors.
We spend an hour of wreck-
ing hopes on easy slopes. As
good as a turn at the Tiv.
Fingernail crevices etched in ski-
wax, tooth-punctured lower lips,
glare-seared eyes. Air so rare
your nose bleeds. Sometimes I
sit down to ease the knees,
which doesn’t count.
My word. I love that life.
Like schoolboys love Latin.
The professor selects a lonely
lunch-spot. I ram beer deep into
snow-holes. The starlet switches
sweater for suntop. I put a
snowball in each beaker and
pour beer to the brim. Jolly
good luck to you, sir.
The professor’s pack smells of
old chestnuts, rancid apples.
Sour as the sentiments of a
literary critic. Olfactory re-
minders of war-time rations for
the scramble ramble over Col de
Monte More.
The starlet unknots suntop for
even suntan.
I wait for reflexes to level out
and add more snow to my beer.
In the social scheme I am re-
dundant as a wooden leg on a
centipede. Sensitive shoots of
mutual adoration proliferate
explosively. Spring crocuses
sprouting through snows of
strangeness.
Separation now would be
harder than unflipping an egg-
flip. With a dash of eau-de-vie
if you don’t mind.

She packs his pack. Lovingly.

1 in pursuit until X am out of
sight. Then I push off, imbued
with the urgency of gravity and
frozen to the controls. I crouch
till knees are spiking my chin
and seat describing a third
groove. I tumble on gravel-ice
where trees throw shadow. I
encounter compulsory - trainee
ski-soldiers in mobile skittle
formation. I miss some of
them.
Through evergreens shot with
the gold of the larch I catch
occasional glimpses of funicular-
corseted depths of Valais.
Marshmallow peaks from Simp-

Snow-spray spatters spruce-
trunks and falls away like sand.
I scud down deeply-grooved
iron-ice trails where flocks of
snow-birds have flown by. I
reach the hotel with only two
thick ears.
I smartly swap soaked ski-
suit for dry Martinis. Breathe
deep and submerge in pre-
dinner ambiance of gregarious
off-centre moments, nefarious
off-color comments, precarious
off-shoulder garments.
The hotel hostess quits her
retinue of haughty sorties,
naughty sporties, exotic neu-
rotics. Shows me a face I would
call chastened on anyone else.
Taut skin. Eyes big as tax-
deductions.
“Where you been?” she
breathes. It’s a long time
between knockbacks. Even for
her.
“Asleep, boss,” I explain. “I
waited all night for your bell.”
“Yeah,” she tells me. Simply
and sincerely. But she adds no
nasty comment. Extortion can
boomerang.
I PHONE Reuters’ corres-
-1 pondent. “Romance,” I re-
port. “Don’t forget my cut.”
I remind Mrs. Awe of faith-
ful service and accept pre-
arranged payment, I return to
my trade of answering room-
calls, peering into dirty glasses,
opening doors at bad moments,
seeking saleable smut.
I feel content when marriage
at Montreux eventuates.
Although they both forget to
say goodbye.
LOVE DUET.
I will not lie with her,
I will not sleep with her,
Because there is in her
That which is evil.
Oh it’s all right to love her
To love her is nothing
If it were all over
When loving were ended.
But we wake in the morning
And watch the glass staring.
And while we are talking
Don’t know what to say.
And she talks to me softly.
Calls me darling her lover
You strange lad my baby
Let me smooth down your hair.
Until I am darling
Her lad and her lover,
Something she wants me;
There is no me there.
In the night I have given,
Have built in her all of me,
Created as man must —
Now I want me back.
But she like a woman
Is collector not maker,
And even at the moment
Held some of her back.
In the night I have loved her,
Have been her, and us too;
But the business is over,
Now I want to be me.
But she like the spider
Is the collector, the mother,
Says build in, build for me
Do not go free.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
THE EXTRAORDINARY WAR.
“This far-off and nearly for-
gotten war ” New York
“Herald Tribune” correspon-
dent.
“The Allies tend to regard the
Korean war as an unfortunate
episode which must be wound
up as quickly as possible.”
G. F. Hudson, in London
“Twentieth Century.”
“And on the home fronts....
the impression that the war is
virtually over has led to a wide-
spread attitude of bored in-
difference with the whole issue,
in striking contrast to the elan
of the original United Nations’
war effort.” London “Econo-
mist.”
“Would this miserable war,
then, have been fought in vain?”
London “Daily Mail.”
Quotes of this sort could go
on almost endlessly. They add
up to one of the reasons why
the Korean war must surely pass
into history as among the most
extraordinary ever fought—all
the more so considering the
number of nations involved, in
some degree, in so small an area.
EMOTIONAL JAG
There are other grounds for
that description; among them
such aspects of the campaign
itself as one that American
publicist Walter Lippmann has
lately trenchantly commented
on:
“Our [U.S.] interest in South
Korea agrees with our moral
commitments up to that un-
happy time when, intoxicated
with victory, we lost our heads
and refused to settle for what
we are settling for now,
“That emotional jag has cost
us 100,000 casualties three-
quarters of all the battle
casualties of the Korean war.
There is no reason why we
should ever allow ourselves to
be entangled again in such
monumental folly.”
LOWERING MORALE
Then there are, as another
aspect of the extraordinary, the
long-protracted truce talks, and
how they have been conducted.
“A kind of diplomatic game
of snakes-and-ladders” is a
“Manchester Guardian” descrip-
tion. Questioning the “compet-
ence of the [Allied] negotiators,”
it savagely added: “Hitherto
their ineptitude has been one of
the most surprising spectacles of
the contemporary scene.”
Also on this particular aspect,
London “Economist” has
pointed out: “The public
spectacle of the truce negotia-
tions, with hopes continually
raised and repeatedly dashed,
has had the effect of lowering
the morale of the Allied troops
in Korea; nothing is harder
than for soldiers to fight when
it appears that a war is just
about to come to an end.”
Again: “As long as the talks
go on a large United Nations
army, for which there are plenty
of qses in other parts of the
world, is tied down. The stale-
mate does not, however, have
such evil effects on the Chinese.
The Korean war has cost them
dearly in trained troops, but the
truce gives them time to train
more and their supply of man-
power is so vast that they can
afford to have the forces at pre-
sent in Korea immobilised per-
manently.”
AIR LOSSES
Another element of the
extraordinary—as modern wars
go—is that with this war there
has been no home-front censor-
ship ; so reports like the follow-
ing (by “New York Times”
military writer Hanson W.
Baldwin) are fairly common in
the American Press:
“In one raid by nine B-29’s
against a target in north-western
Korea near the enemy’s ‘sanctu-
ary’ air bases in Manchuria, the
Russian-built MiG’s shot down
three—or one-third —of the fl-
ap's involved and damaged
virtually every one of the rest.
One United States jet fighter
also was lost in the series of
swirling air battles the raid
caused. The Air Force claimed
eight enemy jets as definitely
destroyed, and others as
damaged ; yet this action, which
was a definite defeat for the
United Nations forces, was
generally hailed as an air vic-
tory.”
Baldwin went on to report
that in the air war in Korea
“the United States has lost —
despite the edge in the jet versus
jet battles —far more planes than
the enemy.”
CHINESE IMMUNITY

ary feature of all is that noted

PROPOSAL.
—Minneapolis ( U.S.A. ) “Tribune.”
ANIMAL LIFE IN KOREA.
by G. F. Hudson in a
“Twentieth Century” article —
the general situation produced
by the Allied decision “to fight
the war in Korea without any
direct counter-attack on China,”
an immunity with which the off-
stage active participant in the
extraordinary war, Russia,
would not be favored:
“Nobody doubts that if
Russia or her East European
satellites were to attack in force
anywhere between the Baltic and
the Black Sea and force a war
with the N.A.T.O. Powers, they
would at once be subjected to
all the retaliation it was in the
power of the Western nations to
inflict. This is a consideration
which Russia must take into
account in making plans, and
the Russian hesitation over the
last two years to cross the
Rubicon with regard to Berlin
or Yugoslavia suggests that the
Kremlin is fully aware of the
risk involved in a head-on col-
lision with the West.
“But China can act with the
prospect of complete immunity,
however great the provocation;
she can send her armies outside
her frontiers and wage war with
absolute security for her ports,
airfields, communications, arms
factories and seaborne trade.
Thus, although China cannot to-
day be compared with Russia as
a military Power, and is depen-
dent on Russia for supplies of
all heavy war material and for
training in its use, China is less
confined than Russia by
deterrents to aggressive policy,
and can give the maximum effect
to what military capacity she
has by reason of her immunity.
CHINA VULNERABLE
This singular situation, the
“Twentieth Century” writer
notes, has been confused for
public opinion in the main
U.N.O. countries “by much
irrelevant argument about
China’s supposed invulner-
ability to aerial attack”:
“It is pointed out that the
Japanese were unable to subdue
China..,.and the inference is
drawn that no better result
could be obtained by action
against contemporary China.
But there is really no analogy
between the two cases, for there
is no question of conquering
China, as there was for the
Japanese empire-builders; the
only problem for the United
Nations is hqw to prevent
Chinese armies from penetrating
into other countries outside
China, and in this context the
Chinese are no less vulnerable
to attack on their bases and
communications than any other
nation.”
They are, in fact, more vul-
nerable than many would be:
“The paucity of their re-
sources in modern industry and
transport means that they are
without reserves for meeting the
strain of modem strategic bomb-
ing. A China deprived of her
slender apparatus of industrial
modernity would still be un-
conquerable in her own
territory, but would no longer
be capable of waging such a
war as she has been carrying on
in Korea over the past year.”
CHINA CAN GAMBLE
Apart altogether from the
painfully obvious assistance
that immunity has been to
China in the extraordinary war,
it might well have a future
application:
“The danger is that China’s
present immunity, combined
with the myth of her alleged in-
vulnerability, will encourage the
rulers of China to further, and
even more world-disturbing,
foreign adventures,
“They have brought China
already through the partial suc-
cess of their Korean interven-
tion an increment of national
prestige in the sharpest contrast
to the humiliations and frustra-
tions of the past century and
have aroused in the Chinese
people a spirit of unprecedented
nationalist exaltation and
enthusiasm; as against this, the
heavy casualties incurred have
little effect in a country where
life is so cheap as it is in China,
and the economic strain of the
war, though considerable, has
not been excessive in the
absence of any hostile interfer-
ence with China’s commerce or
communications.”
Tensions that would occur if
China should be involved in full-
scale war, the writer suggests,
might even bring about the col-
lapse of the whole Communist
regime, “but as long as the
principle of China’s immunity is
an axiom of international
politics, China can gamble on a
very small margin of risk.”
And “The trouble is that the
Chinese Communists so far have
had it too easy for them to be
expected to exercise ordinary
prudence in future unless they
can be persuaded that there
really may be serious risks in
waging war against powerful
nations.”
In view of such considera-
tions, the writer’s conclusion is
that, “even though a general
war would inevitably be fought
mainly in Europe, political
crises capable of producing such
“a war will develop in Asia
rather than in Europe.”
OBJECTIVE LOST
As for the ending of the
extraordinary war, most com-
mentators, American as well as
British, now appear to agree
that the originally proclaimed
U.N.O. objective is beyond
attainment.
As an American example, a
New York “Herald Tribune”
writer;
“There is no way that the
Korean problem can be settled
as a local, isolated problem. The
destiny of Korea is inextricably
bound up with the vital interests
of the great Powers, namely
Japan, China and Russia, amid
which, unhappily for the
Koreans, their country lies.
There is no near prospect, there-
fore, of any good and ambitious
solution like that to which we
committed ourselves in October,
1950.”
London “Daily Mail,” on the
truce negotiations, is typical of
most British comment:
“It seems impossible that a
settlement could produce the
‘free, independent, united Korea’
for which the U.N.O. nations
have been fighting. The best
that could happen would be
that Korea would be split into
two halves, with a neutralised
buffer strip between them. We
should be back almost to where
we were when the fighting broke
out 18 months ago.”
And even at that, “New York
Times” emphasises, the larger,
even more extraordinary war
will still go on:
“We all hope, most earnestly,
that no further lives need be
lost, but we shall delude our-
selves if we think that a truce
will end the contest between the
large forces that are arrayed
against each other. In the long
struggle between freedom and
slavery Korea is one battle-
ground. The deadly fighting
there is one skirmish. The truce
talks are one small episode.
The end is not yet remotely in
sight.”
Dragnet Digest.
J. Bull, Dependant. —Belgian
correspondent J. H. Huizinga in
London “Fortnightly” observes
a phenomenon: “It is a strange
paradox that because the British
are still by far the strongest of
America’s European allies they
are made to feel their depend-
ence on Washington more fre-
quently and acutely than any
other member of the Western
community.”
/. Bull, Worker.—ln “Man-
chester Guardian” Bertrand de
Jouvenel gives a French view;
“In the world economy John
Bull is placed exactly like a
worker whose wage-rates (the
unit price of exports) fails to
keep pace with the cost of living
(the unit price of imports), and
who must therefore work longer
hours to retain the same
standard of life, and even longer
if he wants to improve them.”
Formosa Troops. —Comment-
ing on Vyshinsky’s charge that
the U.S. has been ferrying
Chinese Nationalist troops from
Formosa to Siam, New York
“Herald Tribune” has reported;
“There are indications that the
possibility of finding service for
the Nationalists outside the
island has at least been under
review.”
Voices of China. —On a
Peking radio announcement
that roughly “a million and a
half Chinese will be employed in
the department of propaganda”
this year, “New York Times”
states that they will not be much
employed in the foreign field;
their job is to “tell the Chinese
what they must believe.... .They
are attacking family loyalty,
Confucian ethics, independence
of thought”—and also America.
Churchill Achievement.
When Mr. Attlee made his visit
to Washington he went home
with little more than a chilly
formula about “agreeing to
differ.” Mr. Churchill, in Lon-
don “Daily Mail’s” view.
returned with at least one thing
of paramount importance: “We
now have the promise that what-
ever happens Britain and the
U.S. will stick together.”
Truman - Churchill - Stalin. —
A Washington correspondent of
London “Economist,” after
quoting a U.S. Government
spokesman as stating that “This
country does not go along with
Churchill’s ideas that talks with
Stalin would be worth while,”
added the odd note: “Six days
later ‘this country,’ through the
medium of Dr. Gallup, reported
itself to be 70 per cent, in favor
of a Truman-Churchill-Stalin
meeting ‘to try to settle the
differences between their
countries.’ ”
Tito Help. “Manchester
Guardian”; “Already—though
this is not well known, since
Britain has been keeping quiet
about it —certain urgent military
supplies have been sent from
England, including fighter-
bombers for the Yugoslav Air
Force.”
Chinese Casualties. —“Excep-
tionally heavy,” says the
“Times’s” Hong Kong corres-
pondent, adding:. “Reliable
reports speak of Chinese losses
by early autumn of 1951 as
exceeding the total losses suf-
fered in the three years 0 f c j v ji
W ar from 1946 to 1949 ”
Stony Israel. “By any reason-
abje definition ” reports a
wandering New’York “Herald
Tribune” correspondent “Israel

all the time IsraeFs platoons
G f brilliant economists flood the
i n q U i r j n g visitor in statistics.

Uncle Sam’s Lesser Share. —
London “Times’s” diplomatic
correspondent notes a vital dis-
parity in Wes f s rearmament
set-up: “Although on every
other economic test—such as the
Proportion of national income.
° a a , ‘ o nT o“n de'
national revenue spent on de-
fence-the United States is mak-
far,the lar 8 e u st contribution,
h is making far the smallest con-
tnbution if judged by equality of
sacrifice, since in the United
tates > Wlt h. far the highest
standard of living, falls m con-
sumption are far less serious
thaa elsewhere.’
Whisky Galore. A New
Yor k correspondent’s report in
London “Times” suggests that
the Yanks have evidently said
“When!”; “A million more gal-
jons °f Scotch whisky arrived
in U.S. in the first nine months of
1951 than in the corresponding
period a year ago> but only
39,000 gallons of this increase
anc ’ wa / e , .P ■ nooaea
with Scotch ot
the stockpile. The keener
competition of Canadian
whiskies for the American
market.”
U.S. Bases in Britain. —As re-
ported by a London corres-
pondent of New York “Herald
Tribune”: About 30,000 U.S.
Air Force and Army personnel
are now stationed in Britain,
with about 7000 dependants. The
Air Force part is established on,
or preparing, eight to 12 bases
there for its own use. And
the U.S. Air Force build-up in
Britain is continuing.

TO-DAY
OFFER SO MUCH
TO YOUNG MEN
As always , Australia looks with great
pride upon her Servicemen
As in the critical war years, our sailors, soldiers
and airmen to-day have the respect and admira-
tion of every loyal citizen. And never before
have Servicemen enjoyed such fine career oppor-
tunities. To-day the modernised Navy, Army
and Air Force have become important career
grounds, packed with opportunities for keen
young men seeking to share in a vital national
task and at the same time satisfy personal
ambitions. There are now more than 100
different specialist occupations throughout the
Services. There are special facilities for techni-
cal training. There are ever-increasing openings
for improvement due to rapid expansion. There
are special privileges, pension and gratuity plans,
all of which make Service life the outstanding
career of the day. Get the full story without
delay.
AN IMPORTANT FACT ABOUT SERVICE PAY
There is one basic fact that makes a substantial
increase in a Serviceman’s income. The value of the
“ extras” over and above cash pay. As an example,
an 18-year-old Serviceman who has completed his
basic recruit training (usually 3 to 6 months) earns
over £9/3/-* a week and in addition is provided free
of cost with food , clothing, accommodation and
medical and dental attention. Married men receive
special extra allowances.
•This rate is subject to further increase during
February.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Fry in Church.
Christopher Fry’s “A Sleep of
Prisoners”—a long and bril-
liant one - acter about four
British soldiers who, taken
prisoner by the Germans in the
last war, sleep in a church and
dream and re-enact the stories
of Cain and Abel, David and
Absalom, Abraham and Isaac,
and, finally, Shadrac, Meshac
and Abednego in the fiery
furnace —was put on last week,
and put on very well, by Leonard
Thiele, Frank Waters, Paul Mc-
Naughton and Ivon Vander
under the direction of William
Orr.
The performance, intended to
be the first of an extended sea-
son, was in Sydney’s Garrison
Church, that lovely old stone
building in Argyle-street, almost
under the point where the
Bridge leaps from Miller’s Point
across the harbor. It was a most
appropriate setting, but at the
end of the opening night pro-
ducer William Orr announced
that the Anglican Archbishop of
Sydney had forbidden any
further performances in the
church.
There followed in the Press
some polite exchanges between
the producer, actors, the Church
and the Press itself. On the one
side it was pointed out that the
play had been commissioned by
the Religious Drama Society of
Great Britain; that money
raised by the current perform-
ance was to be used for neces-
sary repairs to the church in
which it was played; that it
argues a philosophy that is in
accordance with the teachings of
the Church ; and that it was per-
formed in St. Thomas’s Church,
London, and in many churches
in England and the United
States. Fry himself, from Lon-
don, said he had “no protest” to
make against the Archbishop’s
decision, adding that perform-
ances in churches had not been
permitted in Scotland.
For the Church the Arch-
bishop stated that permission to
stage the play had been given
without his knowledge; then,
“the church is a building for the
worship of God, and the effect
of real worship is to produce a
sense of awe and reverence. At
the close of the play there was
great applause—at least one per-
son called out. This is turning
a building which was built for
one purpose to quite another
purpose.”
The pother which would
have delighted Shaw, and which,
like most restrictive measures,
should not only bring Fry before
a wider public but ensure the
performance of “A Sleep of
Prisoners” a good season when
it finds a stage in Sydney—was
still unsettled when this went to
print, and, though the Church is
no doubt mistress of its house
and the great ideals entrusted to
its keeping, its attitude here
would seem to explain, in some
small part, the spectacle of
empty churches and crowded
theatres.
"Castle In the Air."
Sydney Metropolitan’s current
offering is a light English
comedy about an impoverished
Scottish earl who, while not try-
ing to get his Scotch on tick, is
trying to take in sufficient
boarders to make a living ; try-
ing to sell his castle to a lovely
and wealthy American widow ;
trying not to have it requisitioned
by the National Coal Board,
which wants to turn it into a
rest-home for tired miners ; and
trying to find someone suffi-
ciently broadminded to help him
give his wife grounds for
divorce. He also has a butler
who treats him as one of the
family, and a secretary, just as
lovely and even more devoted
than the wealthy American.
His troubles provide more
than sufficient amusement for
an evening’s entertainment under
Joseph Scully’s vigorous direc-
tion, and, even if they do not
achieve quite the manner and
polish necessary for this kind of
light English comedy, John
Llewellyn as the earl, Audrey
Peek as his secretary, Gerry
Epstein as the moneyed Ameri-
can, Kenneth Warren as the
butler, and Reginald Lye as the
National Coal Board all toss it
along with boisterous enthusi-
asm, which is the next-best
substitute.
Michele Wunderlich.
Michele Wunderlich’s show of
16 oils at the Macquarie Gal-
leries, Sydney, suggest that the
artist is, at present, more in-
terested in how she is painting
than in what she is painting.
That is probably a commend-
able attitude in a young artist,
even though it leaves the ob-
server more aware of Miss
Wunderlich’s careful, patient
working than of beauties
observed and recorded. Her
forms and colors, however, have
a. suggestion of solidity about
them, like a foundation, and
that is probably the most natural
view to take of them —a master-
ing of the means before tackling
the end.
There are promising indica-
tions of that end in “Country
Road,” with its rich red cow and
tree, pale, green and trembling
with light; in a “Flowers” which
is more conscious of flowers
than the painting of them; and
in “Old Houses, Edgecliff,” with
its planes of warm colors set
off against each other by sun-
light.
Sydney Musical
Society.
Gilsullivan is the forte of this
society, and in its production of
“lolanthe” it excelled even its
usual excellent standard. Under
the guiding hand of that fine old
Savoyard Gregory Stroud the
peers peered with fine dignity at
the peri, who didn’t let the
cramped space of the Con. stage
affect their fairylike grace.
But it was the strength of the
casting that spelt the venture’s
success. Keith Walsh’s Lord
High Chancellor had more spon-
taneous comicality and pseudo-
dignity than had Ivan Menzies
last year. As Lord Mountararat
John Young raised a resonant
baritone, and, with Robert
O’Donnell in the role of Tololler,
upheld the claims of the blue-
bLoods to “do nothing in par-
ticular and do it very well.”
Edward Smith’s Strephon was up
to standard, and Valerie Isbister
in the title role and Denise
Thompson as Phyllis sang and
acted capably. Jacqueline Tal-
bot was the Fairy Queen, and
her singing of “O Foolish Fay”
was one of the evening’s high-
lights. The orchestra, under
Ivan Rixon, and consisting of no
more than 20 pieces, was
excellent.
The Wilson Hall.
“F.S.”: “As the greatness of
every country consists in the
right use of the cultivated intel-
lects of its most gifted sons, it
is to the highest seat of learning
that we must look for the great
men of our future,” wrote
pastoralist Sir Samuel Wilson
when he offered Melbourne
University £30,000 for the
building of the Wilson Hall.
The hall has gone west now,
with its gallery of portraits of
past professors, its organ, its
magnificent oak roof and carved
stained-glass windows, destroyed
by fire. Fire is a destructive
agent, but it hasn’t done as
much damage at the university as
construction. It is rather a
melancholy comment on Sir
Samuel’s statement about great
men coming from the highest
seat of learning that the ugliest
building in the university collec-
tion of ugly buildings is the
school of architecture, though
the new arts building runs if a
good second.
The most beautiful building
is the Warden’s Lodge at Trinity
College, and the finest architec-
ture is the facade of the old
Collins-street bank, which was
demolished and re-erected at the
university with a frame of
modern bricks around it. These
were erected at a time when
there were good carvers in Mel-
bourne and good architects to
direct them, and when the old
craftsmen gave the Gothic form
of the Wilson Hall its lovely con-
tent there were still good carvers,
though not so good as the men
who worked on the old Bank of
New South Wales.

Surprising feature of the latest
accounts is the growth of £75,771 in
net earnings, despite the steady upward
pressure of costs and the sharp rise and
equally sharp fall that occurred in the
price of wool, which is the principal raw
material used by this big and closely-
integrated wool- and textile-manufactur-
ing organisation. The parent and its 30-
or-more Australian subsidiaries turn out
felt piece-goods, footwear, carpets, knitted
goods, woollen- and worsted-cloth, men’s
suits, wool-tops and -yarns and trimmings
for the motor body-building trade, etc.
There is also a large and expanding off-
shoot in New Zealand, in which the
parent holds a 52 p.c. ord. shares interest
(245,000 £1 shares), and a million-odd-
pound associate in South Africa in which
a 42 p.c. interest is held. Each of these
cos. again paid 8 p.c. last term.
From May, 1950, to March, 1951, the
clean-on-floor average price of the 64’s-
56’s quality-bracket for wool rose from
145 d. to 366 d. per pound. The figure
had dropped to 169 d. at the close of the
season. The effect upon net earnings is
summarised by chairman Walter Massy-
Greene in this way;
During the year....the co. made very
substantial aggregate profits from its wool
subsidiaries. It was, therefore, able to
absorb any loss arising from the severe
drop in market value of certain of these
wools after purchase. It has also to be
borne in mind that the Federal Government
determined to subsidise wool bought during
the 1950-51 season by Australian manufac-
turers, and that recently the Government
very wisely decided to extend the period to
April 30, 1952, during which subsidy will
be paid on all wool bought before June 30,
1951, and subsequently fabricated into
manufactured goods. You may take it
lor granted that before that date arrives
all wool bought by your co. before June
30, 1951, will be fabricated, and the sub-
sidy will be paid on all old stocks.
The co.’s selling-prices bobbed up and
down with the rise and fall of the wool
market, and the sales barometer reacted
accordingly. Still, most units of the
group “enjoyed prosperous conditions,”
and the money value of aggregate turn-
over was “very much greater.” After
allowing £506,709 (down £71,739) for
depreciation and £590,589 (up £21,156)
~~!: axat * on > aggregate net earnings were
£75,771 stronger at £672,851. The pref.
divs. took £64,800, and the balance was
equal to 20 p.c. on average ord. capital
as against 18.6, 26.3, 20, 22.6 and 17.8 p.c.
back to 1946. That leaves out of the
reckoning various reserve adjustments,
etc. .interlined in the table. The div„
steac ? y at 10 P- c - for a decade after the
public became interested in 1936, has been
maintained at \l\ p.c. for the five years
to June 30 last.
Early in the term the co. sold its con-
trolling share-interest (bought in 1946
and on which no divs. had been received)
m Korma Textiles (N.Z.), Ltd., to S. and
-H. Korman, joint managing-directors
J next ■ largest shareholders, for
£A500,333 on satisfactory terms. The
loss on the deal was £A55,960, debited
to capital reserve. Following apprecia-
tion of the N.Z. currency and growth of
competition from overseas, the path of
this Auckland knitwear and hosiery
manufacturer has become increasingly
difficult.
To help provide more working capital,
etc., shareholders put up £1,424,837
£949,891 capital and £474,946 share
premiums—in March, 1951. But it wasn’t
enough; the co. went to its bankers for
an extra £3,217,632 and increased the
amount coming to sundry creditors, etc.,
by £1,494,094:

Stocks increased by £5,087,633 and book

slashed off mortgages. Taking into con-
sideration the allowance for depreciation
(£506,709) and the sale of Korma shares
(which involved fixed assets totalling
£997,975), the year’s outlay on fixed
assets was £1,106,151. The more-or-less
liquid surplus was £4,020,738 (up
£1,929,734). Still, when the books closed
there was approximately 20s. coming to
mortgagees, the bank and sundry
creditors, etc., for every pound belonging
to shareholders in the business.
As for the current term, results for the
first half show continued improvement,
but what the rest of the year may hold
rests in the lap of the gods, the chairman
says. Though a firmer tone now prevails
in the wool market, costs continue to
spiral and consumer-buying has lost its
old buoyancy. The real testing-time for
the business appears to lie further ahead.
The f.-p. £1 ords. at 38s. 7d. (555. in

protected firsts seldom come into the

For over 29 years the Government
held a controlling share-interest (51 p.c.)
in this enterprising and very successful
organisation. Then, for reasons of policy,
it sold out in August last, when its hold-
ing of 853,956 shares of Bs. 6d. each (face-
value) was offered to, and promptly
taken by, the public at 455. apiece.
Meanwhile, in October, 1946, the Gov-
ernment had bought the co.’s telecom-
munication interests—development of
which had greatly quickened and
cheapened communications between Aus-
tralia and the rest of the world—for
£1,400,000, of which £1,120,828 was for
goodwill. And the owners of each
original £1 share on the private share-
holders’ register got 575. 7d. in cash, plus
one f.-p. Bs. 6d. share. That left the co.
with a paid capital of £418,845, and
manufacturing and other assets, all of
which have been expanded and have
turned in satisfactory profits since.
To help finance the growth, 350,000 new
Bs. 6d. shares were issued at a premium
of 10s. each in June, 1949, and a further
333,879 new shares were put out, also at
a premium of 10s. each, in January, 1951.
Paid capital thus became £709,494, and
it had the support and assistance of
£1,326,754 of tangible reserves at June 30
last. Also, the div. was lifted from 8 p.c.
in 1947 to 12 p.c. for the next two years,
and then eased fractionally to Ilf p.c.
for the two years to the close of last
accounts, with wide margins throughout.
The co. has thus put up an attractive
performance, and its position, technically
and financially, remains a strong one.
Still, owing to changing financial and
economic conditions, the sharemarket has
revised its assessment of the future of
equity values generally, and the co.’s
scrip, which fetched 545. in June, 1951,
fell to 455. following the Government
sale, and then eased steadily to 355. 6d.
at end December. Last week the figure
stood at 365., giving an immediate return
of only 2.7 p.c. on a Ilf p.c. div. basis.
So the investor at 365. who looks for
approximately 4 p.c. on his money counts
on a 17j p.c. distribution, or other
benefits. Net tangible cover (book-value)
is 245. sd. a share.
Manufacturing activities fall into four
main groups: (1) broadcast transmitters,
radar, frequency-modulation apparatus,
industrial aids, etc., (2) broadcast-
receivers, amplifiers, public-address sys-
tems, etc., (3) vehicular-operated traffic
signals, marine and aerial navigation
instruments, telephones, etc., and (4)
components for other manufactures. In
addition the co. is interested in eight sub-
sidiary and associated undertakings,
operates eight broadcasting stations, pro-
vides technical services for a lot more
and holds some 3000 patents covering
radio, radar and television.
Except one subsidiary, which made a
small loss, all sections of the undertaking
contributed to the improvement of
£1,304,251 (49.6 p.c.) in last term’s sales,
etc., which totalled £3,931,574. Includ-
ing bigger allowances for depreciation
and taxation, operating costs, etc.
(£3,781,636), gobbled £1,282,428 of the
gain. The net result was thus only
£21,823 stronger at £149,938 ; but it was
equal to 24.1 p.c. on average capital as
against 22.5, 21.6 and 19.8 p.c. for the
three preceding years. On shareholders’
funds (capital and reserves combined) the
year’s profit was 7.3 p.c. After pay-
ment of the div., over half the profit was
ploughed back into the business.
The financial position further
strengthened;

premiums—together with surplus earn-
ings, etc., and an extra £221,374 from
sundry creditors, etc., went mainly into
stocks (up £400,238) and book debts (up
£156,922). Freeholds increased by
£87,373 and plant by £67,880. Alto-
gether the more-or-less liquid surplus
(£1,446,324, including shareholdings) was
£402,453 stronger.
The co. is equipped and ready to step
into the television field as soon as the
time arrives. Meanwhile, turnover can-
not be expected to keep on increasing at
the same rate as it did last term, and
mounting costs will bite deeper into
takings. Still, some sections of the busi-
ness have not yet developed full earning-
power, and there might be little, if any,
shrinkage in the current year’s net
earnings.

Mainspring behind the recent extra-
ordinary growth in profits of this 14-
year-old is the rapid post-war expansion
of the Australian economy and
mechanisation of heavy-construction and
other work on both public and private
account. The co., whose works are at
Alexandria (near Sydney), claims to
be the largest manufacturer of earth-
moving equipment in the Southern
Hemisphere. It handles Cletrac and
Oliver crawler- and wheeled-tractors,
makes ’dozers, graders, rooters and
a lot of other tractor-drawn equip-
ment, as well as concrete-mixers and a
wide range of other heavy-engineering
products. The business, including servic-
ing, is spread throughout the Common-
wealth and New Zealand, and orders
have been received, too, from other
countries. Thus far, however, export has
been limited to token shipments, owing
to the strength of local demand.
Shareholders received a steady 8 p.c.
for the 11 years to 1948, followed by 9
p.c. and then 10 p.c. for the two years
to the close of last accounts, when only
38.4 p.c. of the profit was distributed.
And the 10 p.c. div. was sweetened
with a one-for-one bonus-scrip issue
(£170,000) on Nov. 1, made from a
reserve created by revaluation of fixed
assets. This was immediately followed
by a cash issue of 180,000 new £1 ords.
at par. Then, to lighten the debt and help
finance still further expansion, those on
the register at Jan. 14, 1952, were offered
a further 260,000 new £1 ords. at a
premium of ss. each. That will lift paid
capital to £860,000 in 30,000 7 p.c. and
50,000 5 p.c. prefs. and 780,000 ords.
The pref, divs. and 10 p.c. to the ords.
will then call for £82,600, or £19,001 less
profit than was claimed last term.
During the year tractors came forward
in better volume, thanks to the dollar
loan from the International Bank, addi-
tional plant and machine tools were
installed, and stand-by generating equip-
ment was put in to avoid loss of produc-
tion through power-rationing and black-
outs. Turnover (amount not stated) went
up with a rush, and, after allowing for
depreciation (£31,806, up £8282) and taxa-
tion (£96,805, up £52,655), the board
wrote net earnings £30,918 stronger at
£101,601. After paying the pref. divs.
(£4600) enough remained to show 18.6
p.c. on ord. capital as it stood at the
close of accounts as against 38.8, 19.4,
12.9 and 17.6 p.c. back to 1947.
Factory extensions, the purchase of an
adjoining four-acre block and the revalua-
tion already referred to are reflected in
net additions of £129,472 to freeholds
and £124,742 to plant;

The growth of £636,879 in stocks was
partly on account of moderate stockpiling
of scarce raw materials, and bigger trad-
ing added £219,670 to book-debts. To
meet the outlay the co. went to its bankers
for an extra £322,907, added £323,022 to
the amount coming to sundry creditors,
and gathered £lBO,OOO of cash-paid
capital from shareholders. Still, when
the books closed there was 295. 6d.
belonging to the bank and sundry
creditors for every pound owned by
shareholders in the business; hence the
recent new share-issue already mentioned,
which will ease the position considerably.
For the first quarter of the current
term turnover was about 35 p.c. greater
than for the corresponding period of the
previous year. And, the chairman says,
the “volume of tractors to come forward
during the next two years at least is so
great as to indicate the need for a further
substantial increase in our factory out-
put.” A lot of new equipment will come
into operation during the current term.
The rights to the new issue recently
sold at 125., making total cost of the new
shares 375. 6d., at which figure the return
is 5.3 p.c. on a 10 p.c, div. basis. On
the same basis, the old f.-p. ords. at
395. 6d. return 5 p.c. The 7 p.c. and
5 p.c. prefs. at 30s. and 21s. yield 4.6
p.c. and 4.7 p.c. respectively. Including
the new issue, net tangible cover is

In April, 1951, ord. shareholders were
handed two new f.-p. 10s. shares for each
old share f.-p. to 13 s. 4d. That was
equivalent to a bonus-scrip issue of
£127,917 (50 p.c.), which was met out of
a reserve of £202,797 created by a
revaluation of freeholds. It lifted paid
capital to £526,483 in 143,092 £1 7 p.c.
prefs. and 767,502 ords. of 10s. each.
The div. was dropped from 11.1 p.c. to
6.6 p.c., which was equal to 10 p.c. on
ord. capital as it stood before the gift,
and the lower rate, together with the
pref. div., called for £4425 more profit
than was claimed last term.
The slip of £8389 in declared net earn-
ings was due to a slightly lower output
of cement (owing to power restrictions)
and steep rise in costs, for which no relief
was granted in the controlled selling-
price. The chairman says the return on
cement at the co.’s works is approximately
£2 per ton less than the average return
received by cement cos. operating on the
mainland. The cement plant at Railston
(capacity 100,000 tons p.a.) is an efficient
unit alongside good shale, clay and lime-
stone deposits. Present restricted output
is insufficient to meet growing Tasmanian
demand in full, and an adequate supply
of comparatively - cheap hydroelectric
power is not likely to be available before
1953. The asbestos-cement sheeting
factory, put up alongside the cement

works in 1947, reports increased
production, though operations
are restricted to a single shift,
owing to scarcity of asbestos
fibre. To what extent, if any,
this sheeting factory contributed
to the year’s net earnings is not
ascertainable from the published
figures.
The £31,174 of profit claimed
was enough to pay the pref. div.
and show 5.5 p.c. on ord. capital
as it now stands. The figure was
written after allowing the usual
£lO,OOO for depreciation, setting
aside £50,000 (up £8657) for the
taxgatherer, and sending
£20,000 to a special plant-
depreciation reserve (now
£95,000). Whether the profit was
any better than claimed depends
upon whether the combined
allowances for depreciation
prove sufficient to cover actual
plant-replacement cost. Inflation
is playing havoc with the com-
putation of real profits. The true
economic cycle of a business
enterprise begins not with money
but with plant and goods, and
until provision has been made
for replacement of the appropri-
ate proportion of fixed and
liquid assets concerned no real
profits have been earned. Yet
for tax purposes profits are com-
puted after allowing only that
amount of depreciation which
will over the years equal the
original cost. Among other
things, this now means that part
of existing capital as well as
profits is being taxed. It is high
time the Government turned
attention to this important
national problem, the gravity of
which is obscured, but not
diminished, by the fact that re-
placement of the bulk of the
country’s industrial assets has not
yet become imperative.
There is nothing to worry
about in the co.’s finances:

Falcon Gold Mines, _ N.L.
(paid capital £84,400 in 4s.
shares), an Adelaide concern
which recently took an option
over the Scheelite Hill lease at
Mosquito Creek (N.T.), has just
published extracts from reports
on the property by Dr. M. D.
Garretty and Mr. J. R. Hylton.
Crushing and treatment plant is
now in course of erection. Among
other things, the extracts show
that “a long length of reef has
been prospected at intervals by
costeening and opencutting. On
the main reef the shaft has been
sunk on the underlay to a depth
of 85ft., and scheelite-ore mixed
with some wolframite is showing
freely in all parts of the reef, in
the bottom of the shaft under-
foot, in the backs on the hang-
ing wall and in both short
drives put out at 45ft. depth.
That the several veins present on
the property would as a group
continue to provide profitable
ore at depth. All ore awaiting
treatment should assay between
2 p.c. and 3 p.c. W 03.” They
are encouraging statements. But
the sophisticated investor would
have a more definite idea of
what it all means if some refer-
ence had been made to the width
and value of the reefs in ques-
tion. About four months ago it
was stated that the main reef,
explored on the surface for
about 800 ft., had an average
width of approximately 2ft. to
a depth of 45ft. (underlay), with
the lode widening at the bot-
tom. During 1951 the London
average price of wolfram per
unit rose from £S23 14s. 3d. for
January to £S3S 12s. lOd. for
June and eased to £S32 ss. for
December. A further easing of
the price is expected during
1952, owing to the international
agreement among consuming
countries to allocate supplies
and ration domestic customers.
Falcon’s 4s. shares recently
fetched ss. in the market as
against Is. in July last.

Montana Silver Lead, N.L.,
Zeehan (Tas.), has decided to
develop its mine on a large scale,
and to proceed with the installa-
tion of a selective flotation plant
to produce silver-lead and zinc
concentrates. It is hoped to have
this plant in operation by June
next on feed averaging about 10
p.c. lead, 10-12 oz. silver and
1.7 p.c. zinc. Meanwhile the
small gravity mill will keep the
pot boiling, and the tailings will
be re-treated later. On the 150 ft.
level the ore-body has been
opened up for a length of 180 ft,
and good ore is still showing in
the face and underfoot. The stuff
is being broken over a width of
14ft., with no footwall yet show-
ing. Co.’s paid capital of
£78,867 is in 173,500 10s. shares
paid to 9s. l|d. each. During
1951 the price of the scrip
fluctuated between 355. and 925.
in the market. Buyers recently
offered 61s. and sellers asked 655.


Women’s Letters
From Sydney
The return of the Borovansky Ballet
with all three acts and prologue of “The
Sleeping Princess” brought quite a gaily-
garbed group of first-nighters to the
Empire. Claudia Beazley was there in
black ornamented with pink-toned roses,
accompanied by Mrs. E, Esdaile in
classic draperies of yellow and a
sparkling decoration in her hair like
those worn by the fairies in the first act.
Mrs. Dekyvere wore navy silk, silver-
sprinkled like the midnight sky. Mrs.
R. Noss was in statuesque stripes.
Among the throng also were the Clunes
(back from somewhere, no doubt), Elaine
Haxton, Anne Le Guay and Gwen
Plumb in a black dress scolloped and
festooned in a fairytale manner with lace.
“The Sleeping Princess” opened on the
same night as “A Sleep of Prisoners”
(whose dreams were much more troubled,
it seems). Those who saw this play at
the Garrison church reported that it was
most impressive, and that the atmosphere
of the old church seemed to cast a spell
over the audience, who refrained from
those idle chatterings, noddings and beck-
ings and programme-flutterings which
usually precede a play. The ban forbid-
ding the play to be put on in any C. of
E. church is, it seems, based mainly on
the unsuitability of money being charged
for admission, but as the play is highly
edifying and a sermon in itself, perhaps
it wouldn’t be inappropriate to hand
round the plate.
Pamela Burrell, elder daughter of Dr.
A. E. W. Burrell and Mrs. Burrell, of
Griffith, wore bouffant white organza
when she was married at Riverview
chapel on Saturday to Bryan Parle, of
Potts Point. Pamela’s dress was made
with long sleeves and a high neck, and
the skirt, which was trained, was inset
with organza frills. She carried water-
lilies. Her attendants, sister Wendy,
Monica Lynch and Mary Sarks, wore
lilac organza over blue satin with
crinoline hats, and their flowers were
pink and mauve gladioli. The grooms-
men were Frank Gormley (Tumut), Brian
Nowland and Ross Clifton, Reception
was held at the Pickwick, where the 80
guests were received by Mrs. Burrell,
wearing pale-blue faille and navy acces-
sories. The bridegroom’s mother, Mrs.
C. Parle, wore a grey ensemble with black
accessories.
The ked Cross Ball has been set down
for Easter Monday night, April 14, so
that it should make a final grand
spectacle to Royal-visit activities. The
competition for table decorations will be
held again this year, but will call for
more ingenuity, as artificial flowers will
probably have to be used, and there will
be no entries by professional decorators
(impossible, as the firms will be on holi-
days). President of the committee this
year is Mrs. J. P. J. McCauley, and office-
bearers include Mrs. K. Pointing, Mrs.
Alan Williams and Mrs. Norman
Jenkyn.
The C. M. Guineys are off this week to
Crookwell, where they are to be house-
guests of the Kellys, of Corringle. A
pre-picnic race-party has been planned
by their host, who is patron of the Crook-
well picnic race-club, on the night of
the 12th, and a luncheon on the follow-
ing day when the races begin.
The James Bonds, of Mosman,
welcomed about 90 guests to a cocktail-
party at their home on Saturday when
they announced the engagement of their
elder daughter Suzanne to George Vaile,
son of the H. S. Vailes, of Neutral Bay.
Suzanne’s ring, which she designed herself
and which was specially made, has a
central sapphire and sapphire shoulders
with 10 diamonds in the setting.
The Americans (trust them!) have
invented a new way to make piano-
practice palatable to the young. A color-
chait with a different shade for each note
is placed in front of the keyboard, and
the music is printed in corresponding
colors. All the child has to do is to match
up the color on the music with the one
on the chart, and before he knows where
he is he has played “Hearts and Flowers”
or something. This sugar-coating is
designed to interest him and test out his
musical qualities. If he is really keen
on playing he will volunteer (it is hoped)
to learn orthodox keyboard notation.
Gadget-men seem to have sprung up
all round the Sydney shops, and they
invariably get a large crowd round them
while they are demonstrating their fancy
mincers, ice-crushers, clothes-pegs and
carrot-graters. Unfortunately, the word
“gadget” seems to imply, by its very
sound, something small and cheap, so j
that when it is revealed that the gadgets i
being demonstrated cost sums like 775.
and £4 10s., there is usually a bit of
a gasp round the crowd and a general
sidling away.
There are portraits of several ladies of
fashion in the current Archibald-prize
exhibition—Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere wear-
ing the white crinoline French model first
seen at the Black and White Ball to-
gether with a rather fixed smile, Lady
Lloyd-Jones painted by Dobell and look-
ing quite fey, Mrs. Vincent Fairfax all
ready dressed for the Royal visit, and
pianist Nancy Weir in a Renaissance
mood.
It seemed that Mary Edwards’s portrait
of Pamela Kendall was the most suitable
to ornament the Letter this week, first
because Mary Edwards has made so
valuable a contribution to the Archibald
contest in the past (her exhibit for the first
competition in 1921, by the way, was a
portrait of The Bulletin’s managing-
director, William Macleod), and second
because the subject, Pamela Kendall, is
a collateral descendant of poet Henry
Kendall. Pamela is an ex-Abbotsleigh
girl, and it was at the school fete and art
exhibition last year that Mary Edwards
sighted her in the same white pique dress
and Kelly-green hat she wears in the
portrait. Daughter of the J. M. Kendalls,
of Chatswood, Pamela is a nurse at the
Dental Hospital.
With a promise of aperitifs, Italian
dinner, table-wines and dancing the
National Opera Club (N.S.W.) starts its
social events for 1952. The tickets are
two guineas each, the venue the Italian
M.V. Australia, the date Saturday,
February 9. The number of tickets is
limited to 120, as only the first-class
accommodation is to be used, and the
guests are to have the maximum of
comfort. The party goes on from
7.30 p.m. to 1 a.m., so altogether it should
be a very happy affair.
To arrive in Australia by the Stratheden
on February 18 are Major and Mrs.
Greville Stewart-Stevens, of Perthshire,
Scotland. Mrs. Stewart-Stevens will be
remembered as Mrs. Aubyn Wilson,
whose late husband owned Yarrabera,
near Bendigo (Vic.). On their return to
Europe in March they hope to visit Mrs.
Stewart-Stevens’s daughter Prudence,
whose husband, Major Eric Penn, is in
charge of the Brigade of Guards in
Tripoli. Both sons, Ralph Stewart-
Wilson, M.C., and Blair Stewart-Wilson,
are officers in the Duke of Athol’s private
regiment, the Athol Highlanders. The
Stewart-Stevenses plan to stay at Menzies
Hotel when they arrive in Melbourne,
and will then pay a round of visits to the
country. Major Greville Stewart-Stevens
is an excellent golfer, having won every
type of club medal and competition at
St. Andrews, He is also a keen race-
goer and canasta player.
A special sub-committee is being
formed by the Garden Club to discuss
plans for a Memorial Highway. The
chairman is Charles Moses, and the first
meeting of this committee will be held at
the A.B.C. Auditorium, Broadcast House,
264 Pitt-street, at 4.30 p.m. on Monday,
February 11. It is hoped that as many
members as possible will attend, and give
the project the support that it deserves.
It looks as though the fashionable
thing to do on a Saturday morning is to
take the car to Paddy’s Markets in the
dawn and return laden with vegetables,
fruit and an empty purse. Reports say
that the fruit was by no means cheap
(oranges Bd., peaches 6d., for instance),
but that bargains could be fought for
and won among the onions and
pumpkins. The trouble with shopping
at the markets has always been, it seems
to this Letter, that one always buys too
much. To save 6d. a pound on pumpkins
is not enough Jo compensate one for
spending about 2s, 6d. on fares, unless
one buys, say, about 101 b. of pumpkin,
which in a small family would make for
misery and strife in the home. However,
shopping at the markets seems to be the
thing to do at the moment, and to the
connoisseurs of sales it must be a
godsend.
It makes one a little disheartened to
read that South Africa has provided a
lion, “gorged with the flesh of wilde-
beeste” and roaming more-or-less at
large, for the entertainment of the
Princess. What can we offer to compare?
The jostling crowds on a Friday after-
noon, the mad panic of the traffic seem
so insipid compared with a real live lion.
One thing, however, is clear from the
itinerary of the Royal couple in Sydney,
and that is that they are to be given
ample opportunity of getting to know
Gardener’s - road, Mascot, pretty
thoroughly. Perhaps a kangaroo might
hop across the path or a koala look in
the window of their car to relieve the
monotony of this repeated journey. Cer-
tainly the tour authorities should take
this lion as a challenge to Australia and
do something about it.
From Melbourne
Almost every large store is featuring a
showing of styles for the Royal visit, and
most of the clothes show only slight
differences from those worn last winter.
For instance, the “Princess” line leaves
the question of a waistline non-existent;
then, again, there are details which bring
the waistline back to its normal position.
Tiny boleros are chopped off well above
the waist, deep corselettes come almost
up to the armpits. The hemline of winter
frocks and suits are slightly nearer the
floor: 13 to 14 inches from it. For late-
afternoon wear the skirt is longer. Very
full skirts will be news. Jacques Fatb
makes his skirts the fullest possible, and
even suit-skirts flare over crinolines.
Dior’s skirts are straight. Another de-
signer makes skirts with the fullness
swung back like the wings of a bird.
Sleeves are varied and ingenious. Other-
wise-classic suits have bell-sleeves or very
long sleeves. There are melon-sleeves,
arc-sleeves and capesleeves. And in the
evening, although there are many strap-
less gowns, for the first time in many
seasons there is a return to straps or a
widening of the bodice-drapery. A gown
may be highlighted with fan-like sleeves
and have spreading crinoline skirts.
Colors are gay and exciting, with greens
from pale-sage through emerald to fir-
green. There are French - mustard,
beaver-brown and purple, “Chardin”
colors—looking as though mixed with
charcoal; all blues, royal and peacock
predominating, beige and oyster for late-
day, dark-grey and much white for
evening.
It is 16 years since Gertrude Johnson
convened the meeting which resulted in
the bringing into being of the National
Theatre, of which she has long been its
livewire director. Gertrude, who had
once been principal soprano at Covent
Garden and played Musette to Melba’s
Mimi in a gala performance of “La
Boheme,” is now preparing for the Arts
Festival which begins on February 18.
To the National Theatre has been given
the honor of presenting a Command Per-
formance which Princess Elizabeth and
the Duke of Edinburgh will attend.

Iris Williams, attractive in a black
faille frock, was hostess at a buffet-dinner
when Mrs. H. G. Connell was welcomed
back from a trip overseas. Party was held
at Iris’s home. Mrs. Connell, who was
accompanied by her son Barry, wore
green-printed silk. Among the guests
were Sir John and Lady Teasdale, the
latter in black crepe ; Mrs. W. E*. Agar,
whose choice was a black silk jacket-suit
and matching hat; Dr. Janet Cooper;
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Voumard; Mr. and
Mrs. G. Weisser; Mrs. P. D. Oram,
whose black-and-white-striped satin frock
was worn with a tiny black satin hat;
and Gladys Hammond and her sister
Marjorie.
An unknown young singer, Marie Col-
lier, will have the great honor of singing
“Aida” at the National Theatre Move-
ment’s command performance before
Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edin-
burgh. This will, be Marie’s first season
in opera, although she sang for 10 weeks
m the chorus of “White Horse Inn” and
“Oklahoma” for J. C. Williamson’s. She
will sing only in one scene, for the rest of
the programme will be composed of
ballet and drama. Lynn Golding will
dance the principal role in “Swan Lake”
(the third act); this young Sydney dancer
appeared with the National Theatre
ballet last season when she danced the
dual role of Odette and Odille in the full-
length presentation of “Swan Lake.” June
Brunei!, who has been selected to play
a scene from “St. Joan,” is best known
for her work with the Little Theatre, and
recently gave an outstanding perform-
ance in “Salome” at the Arrow Theatre.
June has also been on several tours with
Everyman’s Theatre. John Brownlee will
be a welcome addition to the cast of
“Aida.” This Australian singer has been
so long abroad that a younger generation
knows him only through his recordings.
The names of those who will appear
in the command performance were re-
leased at a late-afternoon party at the
National Theatre when Sir Robert Knox,
president of the National Theatre, and
Gertrude Johnson, its director, enter-
tained many guests. Lady Knox wore a
dove-grey ensemble, Gertrude’s duster
coat was of black faille, her large hat of
black silk straw. Guests included Mrs.
Frank Selleck, whose black crepe jacket-
suit was contrasted with a shrimp-pink
velvet cloche ; Mrs. Bernard Evans, her
steel-grey tailored suit matched by a
grey felt hat; Lady Heinze, who topped
her teal-blue jacket-suit with a natural-
straw sailor hat; Mrs. Massey Burnside,
in navy taffeta ensemble and matching
beret; Mrs. Simon Warrender, who wore
a lovely lilac duster-coat; and Mrs.
Muriel Hadley in black.
The gala premiere of “Kiss Me Kate”
at His Majesty’s was a notable one, with
the acting and singing of the two stars,
Joy Turpin and Hayes Gordon, of a high
order. The audience was a particularly
well-dressed one. Mrs. T. C. Manifold,
in a gown of pastel-pink chiffon, was
accompanied by her daughters. Mrs.
Lionel Grimwade chose midnight-
blue draperies, Mrs. Garnet Carroll
wore the new black-copper shade
of faille, over the strapless bodice
of which she draped a matching
stole. Mrs, Hal Percy’s frock was of
pastel-pink chiffon. A peacock-blue
ostrich-feather stole lent contrast to Mrs.
Rupert Downes’s white crepes. Mrs.
Conrad Charlton’s frock was of amber-
embossed satin. Mrs. A. C. Haworth’s
gown was outstanding. Of emerald satin,
the pockets of the spreading skirt, the
strapless bodice and matching jacket were
encrusted with emerald headings. Mrs.
Peter Condon’s white crepe frock was
full-skirted, the off-the-shoulder bodice
heart-shaped. Pamela Gold, who has
just become engaged to Ken Irvine, chose
white lace over pink nylon tulle and
taffeta. Joyce Patton, also recently
engaged (to Milton Mitchell), wore
bouffant blue-embroidered tulle.
A gay cocktail-party in the Marina-
room of the Australia was given for the
four lovely British mannequins who will
show at the Myer Emporium the suits
and gowns they brought from London.
There to greet them were Clifford Ellis
and his wife, the Ralph Hunts (Mrs.
Hunt wearing a multi-striped satin hat,
which matched the blouse she wore with
her suit), Margaret Miller in black frock
and matching hat, Lalla Dredge, whose
crepes were ice - blue, and Mary
McKenzie.
The premiere of the British Vogue
Export Fashion Show at the Myer Mural
Hall was staged with imagination and
taste. Figures in shining armor guarded
the stairs down which the mannequins
walked. In the foyer cocktails were
served, and, when the air became too
humid, from the ceiling perfume was
sprayed. All the usherettes wore black
with ribands of red, white and blue
draped across one shoulder. A lovely
gown was worn by Mrs. Sidney Baillieu
Myer. Of cinnamon-brown faille, it was
heavily embroidered with white beads.
Lady Brookes chose pale-beige faille,
Mrs. John Inkster (the Lady Mayoress)
slim-fitting black crepe. The wife of the
U.S.A. Consul-General, Mrs. Henry
Stebbins, wore a pleated gown of dove-
grey chiffon. Mrs. A. H. Tolley’s black
organza had black velvet appliqued on
the bodice and the swirling skirt.

PERSONAL ITEMS
After close on half a century playing
with trains (though he’d qualify the verb
for the last four years of his service),
Frederick Charles Garside has retired to
his bowls. Born in Sydney 65 years ago
yesterday, he started off a newspaper-boy
in GoulbUrn, at 16 joined the N.S.W.
Railways as an apprentice-fitter, and, a
measure of his competence, was fitter-in-
charge of a large locomotive-shed within
seven years. Although he is best-known as
N.S.W. Railways Commissioner, perhaps
one of his most competent efforts in the
department was as Comptroller of Stores.
Then 35, and having just turned in the
most thorough and forthright report (on
its timber) that the department had ever
received, he set about the reorganisation
of that important branch with such
marked success that the two green-lights
went up for his swift run to the com-
missionership. A man of immense
energy, as just to his staff as he was
sternly insistent on efficiency, he exhibited
a moral courage in sticking to decisions
which sometimes ran counter to cheer-
chasing politicians, which didn’t make
his big job any easier: a fact, however,
for which this straight-shooter cared not
a whit.
“Trinco”: In Vincent Massey, Cana-
dians have as their new Governor-General
a cultured diplomat of the old and tried
school who lifted the Canadian High
Commissionership in London to a digni-
fied, almost courtly elevation. Head of the
world-wide Massey-Harris agricultural-
implement concern, Massey got his arts
degree from Oxford, and for a time lec-
tured in modern history at Toronto Uni-
versity, in which city he was born. On
the diplomatic side Canadian Minister to
the U.S. between 1926-30, and for 11
years from 1935 High Commissioner in
the U.K., in matters cultural (as chair-
man of the Massey Foundation) he has
kept many music, arts and theatre groups
in Canada on their feet, has been a trustee
of the National and Tate Galleries
(London), and is chairman of Canada’s
National Gallery. Also for years active
in amateur theatricals, acting as well as
playwriting. Sixty-four, the new G.-G.
has the same austere cast of features as
his younger brother, film-actor Raymond
Massey.
Passed his 87th milestone and still in
harness, Sir William Angliss, Melbourne's
master-butcher who started in a small
shop in Carlton in 1886, pioneered the
meat-trade to the Westralian goldfields,
and started the frozen-meat traffic to
U.K. during the Boer War. Now a
director of companies of all sorts, he was
at his desk at 8.30 on the morning of his
latest birthday.
“Fitz”: W. J. Walkerden, who has been
writing for The Bulletin for more than 20
years under “Gravelsnatcher” and other nib-
names, has done a bit of knocking-around
in his native Westralia. His childhood and
youth were spent in Belmont, near the Ascot
racecourse, and, like just about every other
kid in the district, he was seldom off a horse’s
back. At 15 he was a telegraph messenger,
later a telephone mechanic, but left the P.M.G.’s
Department to go after big cheques in the
wheatbelt. The big cheques proved a myth;
he struck the depression, and worked as a
teamster, tractor-hand, rouseabout on wheat-
farms and sheep-stations, and swung the banjo
with road-gangs in gravel-pits—hence “Gravel-
snatcher.” He varied farm and road-gang work
with clearing, dam-sinking and fencing con-
tracts, and did a little shearing; has humped
his bluey and jumped the rattler and listened
to thousands of yarns around the campfires.
For some years he toiled in market-gardens,
and considers himself somewhat a champion at
single-farrow ploughing. The outbreak of
War II saw Walkerden driving a truck for a
firm of wood- and coal-merchants, but in no
time he was off to the Middle East with the
6th Division Engineers, transferring later to
the 2/11 Infantry Battalion. After the war a
printer’s machinist, he is now a copyholder
in the proofreaders’ room of a Perth news-
paper office. He still retains his association with
the outback, owning a ten-acre property out-
side the city which carries a larger assortment
of wild bird-life than any similar area he has
seen south of Geraldton, A keen observer and a
shrewd commentator on the passing scene, with
his fund of experiences to draw upon, “Gravel-
snatcher” is typical of the countless contributors
who have helped to make The Bulletin’s
“Aboriginalities” pages a unique feature in
world journalism.
When you’ve made the world’s record
break of 4137 (in 1931 in London), there
is nothing much more to be done and
you fall out of public notice. This is
what happened to Walter Lindrum, the
Adelaide billiardist now residing in Mel-
bourne. But Lindrum has made another
record—raised more money for the Mel-
bourne Lud Mayor’s fund than any other
single person. He also raised £300,000
for patriotic funds in War 11. This month
he has set himself the modest task of a
10,000-break, which he will attempt in an
eight-day round-the-clock demonstration
at the Town Hall, proceeds to go to the
Lud Mayor’s Portsea holiday-camp. It
involves miles of walking round the table.
As well as the world record Walter holds
Australian, Canadian, U.S., S. African,
Irish, Scottish and Indian records.
“W.W.”: In 1917, with the old 3rd
Battalion in France, Roy Laraghy lost a
leg; since then he has spent most of his
time battling doggedly for Diggers
similarly afflicted. Few Australians have
known so many Prime Ministers, Cabinet
Ministers and members so well as
Laraghy—from S. M. Bruce through to
R. G. Menzies they’ve all called him
Roy, and reckon he’s the most persistent
petitioner they’ve struck. Knocked back
today he’d turn up again tomorrow, with
the same request differently worded.
Now, just past the three-scofe mark,
Laraghy has called it a day from his
27-year secretaryship of the Victorian
branch of the Limbless Soldiers’ Associa-
tion, but will retain the Federal secretary-
ship, which he’s held for the same period.
Victorian members took the hat round
and handed him a cheque for £7OO.
Called in to talk poetry (and, one
suspects, to meet the Religious Editor),
Father Reginald McDonnell. Here
Prioried, he came equal second in
the Jubilee Literary Competition with
his long poem, “My People.” Born
at Molong (N.S.W.), whereabouts
another rhymester named Banjo Paterson
first saw the light. Father McDonnell
is a B.A. and B.Ed., of Queens-
land University, and winner, while
there, of the Ford Memorial Medal for
his poem on rehabilitation. Now teach-
ing young hopefuls at St. Stanislaus
College, Bathurst (the oldest Catholic
boarding-school in Australia), the poet-
priest, ordained in 1937, picked up his
early education wherever his father, a
POET-PRIEST.
stationmaster, happened to be stationed.
One of his brothers, a State schoolie,
was a gunner in New Guinea in the
Pacific war; the other was lost in
Malaya, signalman with the Bth Division.
Apart from poesing, when not showing
the spiritual light the priest busies him-
self with maintaining the Edison variety
at St. Stanislaus, where he has been elected
(unopposed) chief electrical-appliance-
fixer. Forty, slight, dark, with a fresh
anecdotal vitality.
The roots of Brisbaneite Edwin Mars-
den Tooth (here pictured by Gordon)
delve deep into Australian history —he’s
a great-grandson of Samuel Marsden, the
second colonial chaplain of N.S.W.
(1794), and a great-great-nephew of
Surveyor-General Oxley, lieutenant, R.N.,
discoverer of the Brisbane River. Tooth
has done a bit of delving on his own
account. As a captain in the Kaiser’s
scrap he won M.C. with the Mining
MINES AND MOTORS.
Corps, and, till recently, he was chairman
of directors of Tableland Tin, which con-
cern dug up a good deal of the com-
modity needed for War 11. In between
these digging interests he became in-
terested in the motor-trade, and is now
an executive of three leading Queensland
motor- and tractor-firms.
“Macnell”: Hundreds of War II
Diggers owe their first appearance in
print to Colonel J. C. Treloar, Director
of the National War Memorial in
Canberra, for whom the Last Post has
sounded in Canberra, at 58. Treloar ran
the series of Digger-written books
( H.M.A.S., Jungle Green, and so on,
combined, after the war, in the annual
As You Were), in which Diggers were
invited to put down their experiences
before time dimmed the memory. A
junior officer when he became 0.c., A.I.F.
War Records in London, Treloar labored
so well there that he won higher rank
and a lien on the War Memorial director-
ship, which he’d held since 1920. First
secretary of the Department of Informa-
tion when it was formed in 1939, a pains-
taking, nuggety chap with a passion for
detail, he was in his element at the War
Memorial, where are stored the yellow-
ing records of just about every Digger of
War I —as well as the relics of both
scraps which make the Memorial a
“must” for Canberra tourists. There he
had for assistants the late Colonel Graham
Butler, writer of the medical section of
the Official War History, and Tom
Hungerford, Bulletin short-story writer
and consistent prize-winner in “S. M.
Herald” novel-competitions.
From kicking-off at football matches,
striking-off at baseball, dropping the flag
for husky derbies, patronising art
festivals, inspecting goldmines, lumber-
camps, hospitals and schools (and,
incidentally, through his solid sterling
qualities, inducing nation-wide pro-
British feelings in Canada), Field-Marshal
Earl Alexander becomes Britain’s
Minister of Defence. His experience
in that sphere needs no further record-
ing here. On the lighter side he
is the first half-colonel to break a mile
record in the British Army ; like his new
boss, likes to dabble at landscaping in
oils; speaks Russian, Italian, German,
French and Urdu; and was such a
dreadful muff at kicking-off at Canadian
football matches that thousands of
dollars regularly changed hands in good-
humored bets on the shortness of his
kicks. Once in Canada his wife attended
a women’s meeting convened to deplore
the horrific effects of comic-strips on the
national mind. She chipped in: “pie
only way I got to hear of these terrible
characters Dick Tracey and Li’l Abner
is because my husband reads them.”
Recently met in Melbourne, the Earl
of Lovelace, a descendant of John Locke,
the philosopher who wrote the classic
essay on “Human Understanding,” in
which he propounded a materialistic and
empirical philosophy which shocked the
conscience of the 17th century. The earl
is more interested in sheep, surfing and
shooting—claiming 106 elephants shot on
a three months’ safari in South Africa.
His title goes with a family seat near
Loch Torridon in the Hielands,
Shared second prize of £5OO apiece in
the Jubilee non-fiction book section (no
first was awarded), Tom Inglis Moore and
John Keith Ewers, both old hands at the
literary game and both Bulletin story-
writers. A genial six-footer, born at
Camden (N.S.W.), Moore has had a busy
and varied scholastic career —Oxford on
a scholarship, the U.S. to instruct in Eng-
lish at a Massachusetts academy and the
University of Iowa; assistant-Professor
of English at the University of the
Philippines, later tutorial lecturer in
literature at his alma mater, Sydney Uni-
versity. When, in War 11, he turned
soldier (starting a gunner in the A.I.F.
and finishing major with Army Educa-
tion), he had just finished six years of
leader-writing on “S. M. Herald.” Ewers,
also a schoolie (27 years with the Wes-
tralian Education Department), was born
at Subiaco, one of Perth’s beaches, and
started scribbling as a hobby while a
trainee-teacher. Scribbling developed
into the production of a sizeable shelf of
novels (one published in the U.S.), a book
of verse and stories in Coast to Coast.
He’s 47, Moore 50.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Pedigree Isn’t All.
“F.H.”: The late Frank Hard-
ing, of Chicago, one of the lead-
ing U.S. Shorthorn-breeders,
told cattlemen to study pedigree
logically. Usually pedigree
students searched a pedigree till
they got back to the last sire in
the fifth generation, and said
“Well, boys, there he is. This
has to be a good bull, because
he traces back to Big John.”
But Big John, who might have
been an all-American fullback,
three or four generations later
might well be found in the
pedigree of a piccolo-player.
Pedigree was the best* indica-
tion of the probable produc-
tivity of an untried animal, but
only when the indication could
be gathered from the close-up
ancestors. Pedigree was very,
very important, but only while
it went with the right kind of
animal,
Harding’s advice to young
breeders buying bulls or cows
was to find the right kind first,
then look at the pedigree. If the
pedigree didn’t suit, leave them.
“If you satisfy yourself with
a pedigree only,” he said, “it is
entirely possible that you will
end up with some wonderful
pedigrees and a bunch of darn
poor cattle.”
Sight for Levelling.
“Ben Acre”: Rifle telescopic-
sights can be used for levelling.
Here’s how to adjust the Field
300 A, the one I have used, but
other makes can be similarly
adjusted.
First take a note of the setting
of the sights so that they can be
reset for shooting. The sights
are not removed from the barrel,
though it is best to remove the
stock. Turn the barrel on its side
so that the unobstructed side of
the sights is upwards. The nor-
mal verticle wire is now hori-
zontal, and is used for levelling.
With the sight on a firm, flat
support and a spirit-level on the
body of the sights, they are set
level and sighted on to an object
at a reasonable distance. Not
too close.
Now take the sight and set it
up at the point and height
sighted on, and, after levelling,
sight back. If the sights happen
to be correct they will be sighted
on to the position you originally
sighted from. If they are in-
correct adjust so as to halve the
error. They should now be
correct. Check by sighting back
and forth several times, and,
when found to be accurate, take
a note of how much they have
been altered from the original
setting. This amount of altera-
tion can be used as a start for
readjusting the sights for levelling
at some future time.
Don’t forget to reset the
sights for shooting.
If, in adjusting the sights for
levelling, you find you cannot get
accurate readings, check the
spirit-level. This is done by
placing in the vice a piece of
timber, the top of which is
smooth and flat. Put the level
on it and set it horizontal. Now,
if the level is reversed, end for
end, the bubble should still be
centre. If this is not so, take a
note of the position of the
bubble and move the timber to
bring the bubble halfway back
to centre. The timber should
now be level. To check this
mark the bubble with pencil or
chalk and reverse the level. The
bubble should still be at the
pencil - mark. When this is
obtained the bulb of the level
can be adjusted to bring the
bubble to the centre. Many
levels have provision for adjust-
ment. Otherwise it is as well to
re-mark the bubble position and
use the level as it is.
Protecting Oil Supplies.
“Ben Acre”: Keep drums
containing fuel or lubricating
oil under a roof. If this can’t
be done, tilt them so that any
water that falls on them will not
lodge round the bung. Other-
wise, unless the bung is screwed
down thoroughly, the contraction
of air and gas in the drum, on
cooling at night, will draw the
water in.
Oil and water will, if left
standing for a time, emulsify,
the resulting mixture being unfit
for lubrication ; and it cannot
be separated without distilling
equipment.
Water can be strained from
fuel. Run the fuel off the top,
or the water from underneath,
and strain the fuel through a
rag dipped in fuel. This will
take off remaining water. Pump-
ing of the fuel and water from
the drum will bring about an
emulsion which can be separated
by allowing it to stand for a day
or more, according to the type
of fuel.
Hypochlorite.
“Myrrhee”: The following
procedure on milking-machines
is recommended by Victorian
Department of Agriculture; As
soon as milking is over draw
lukewarm water through each
unit, then hot water containing
a dairy cleanser, followed by
flushing with boiling water or
passing steam through the
machines for five minutes.
Then leave until just prior to
the next milking, when the
hypochlorite in cold water is run
through the machines. This will
clean up any contamination
which may have occurred since
wash-up and leave the metal
parts cool, clean and ready to
take the milk. Use 12i p.c. of
sodium hypochlorite, 1 fl. oz.
(two tablespoonfuls) in 2gal. of
water.
Wheat Production.
“Grano”: Although there is
room for an increase of the
wheat-acreage, it is not good
that it should be attempted on
land which has been cropped
intensively for many years.
During recent years the
dangers of constant cropping,
from the standpoints of soil-
erosion, weeds (particularly
skeleton-weed), loss of soil-tilth
and -fertility and lower baking
quality of the grain have become
widely apparent. These factors
underline the need for less-
intensive cropping.
For various reasons during
the past two years, including the
easier life and excellent returns
from wool and/or meat instead
of wheat, and shortage of labor,
wheatgrowers have naturally
turned part of their wheat-land
to pasture. From a long-range
view this is one of the best
things which could have hap-
pened for the eventual benefit of
the land. If the change had not
been made now it would have
had to be made later.
Economists, politicians, statis-
ticians and some newspapers
now urging wheatgrowers to
sow a larger area of wheat have
little conception that the land
which is now resting from crop-
ping, not in cultivated fallow
but in pasture, producing meat
and wool, will be so invigorated
that more wheat will eventually
be produced from smaller areas,
with more meat and wool from
the farm at the same time.
Improved Pasture.
“8.N.5.W.”: Though New
England (N.S.W.) had one of the
worst winters for many years.
“Hey! Don't split those logs!"
the N.S.W. Bank manager at
Armidale has discovered a
property of 7000 acres of which
1400 acres are sown with rye,
cocksfoot and clovers. The
other 5600 acres are of natural
pastures.
It is at present stocked with
5876 western wethers, 700 cattle
(400 breeders) and 230 young
calves. Without calves the
equivalent in sheep is about 1.4
to the acre; and the average
yield from the wethers was
10.51 b. of wool.
The property is free of rabbits
and well managed, and the
results show what improved
pastures can do.
Mineral Lack.
“Sundowner”: Where it is of
copper and cobalt correct either
by drenching, topdressing or
treating the drinking-water. In
composing a drench to solve the
immediate problem use lOoz. of
copper sulphate, 2oz. of cobalt
chloride and igal. of water.
Add half a pint of this to 8i pints
of water and administer each
week for a few months at the
rate of i fluid oz. for a sheep
and 4 fl. oz. for a full-
grown cow, with smaller doses
for young animals.
When topdressing to correct
the deficiency over a long period,
use 51b. to 101 b. of copper per
acre and 11b. to 21b. of cobalt,
every five to seven years.
Drinking-water may be treated
with lOoz. of copper, soz. of
cobalt to Igal. of water. Add
half a pint of this solution to
400 gal, of water. Don’t put in
iron tanks or troughs because of
the effect of the iron on the solu-
tion.
Zebu Crosses.
“H.G.”: The Zebu is not the
answer to increased beef-pro-
duction in the north, but Zebu
crosses could help considerably
and at the same time pave the
way for better-quality cattle.
Transportation, pasturing and
fencing, in that order, are the
three most important things to
the north. Air-lifting of beef
is going well, and may provide
the answer in the long run, but
it is not being developed fast
enough to carry the added pro-
duction required. As to pastur-
ing, sorghum is grown success-
fully in the Kimberleys, and,
with irrigation and modern
equipment, seems promising.
Fencing would follow these two
as a matter of course, but all
three require capital.
The properly domesticated
Zebu is not as leggy as claimed,
and the crosses are even less so.
The breed is renowned for its
foraging ability, and has one
decided advantage over the
British breeds —it can be over-
landed for long distances with-
THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
Appearance of a new sunspot group and a study of
the cycles, showing heavy rain north of the Tropic and
moderate over most of Eastern Australia, make the prospects
fairly good.
Against this, however, is the combination of three
years of deficient rainfall, which meet in this year owing
to their cyclical periods. It is in this way that flood years
and drought years come to pass; at least that is the con-
clusion reached from the work at Crohamhurst.
Though an exact repetition of seasons is practically
impossible, it is true that the 1868 and 1914 droughts broke
in the winter time, and 1952 could be similar.

Pig-feeding.
“My”: Pigs need plenty of
fat-producing foods, rich in
protein, vitamins and minerals.
Grain, pollard and other grain
by-products and potatoes will
provide the energy for fattening.
The larger the pig the more fat-
tening food it requires. The
piglet will commence by eating
a mouthful or two a day, gradu-
ally increasing its intake until,
as a heavy baconer, it is eating
61b. to 81b. a day. A sow suck-
ling a large litter may eat 151 b.
to 181 b. (dry basis) of these fat-
tening foods daily.
Young pigs need more protein
in proportion to fattening food
because they are growing and
putting on flesh. When the
youngsters learn to drink from
a trough allow them as much
skim-milk as they’ll drink, up
to half a gallon a day, or |lb.
of meatmeal if there’s no milk.
Handy Booklet.
“C.S.”: The International
Harvester people have issued
“Hay Is How You Make It,” the
third in a special series, others
of which were entitled “Let’s
Improve Our Pastures” and “Are
We Soil Managers?”
The booklet covers every
aspect of hay-making—standard
practices and improved methods,
ranging from soil-management
to the consumption and conser-
vation of nutritious fodders,
plant-life from seed-germination
in fertile soil, growth of healthy
grass, legume and cereal plants-;
processing of fodders by grind-
ing, using feed-grinders and
hammer-mills for both rough-
ages and concentrates; hay-
making practices in Australia,
together with improved methods,
using systems of equipment for
hay-making; labor efficiency
involved in the use of haying
machinery and so on.
Onions.
“Big Billy”: Onions are best
grown in rotation, for by fol-
lowing a row-grown crop the
weeds are easier to keep down.
A soil of fine tilth to a depth of
at least 6in. is required, with
heavy applications of stable-,
sheep- or fowl-manure, and
compost for extra enrichment.
A balanced artificial fertiliser
would comprise 7 p.c. to 9 p.c.
of potash, 6 p.c. to 7 p.c. of
phosphoric acid and 5 p.c. of
nitrogen. Use at 12cwt. to
15cwt. an acre.
Autumn-sown crops should
get half the artificials at sowing
and the other half as a spring
dressing. Distance between the
rows will depend on the type of
cultivation. With a small area
the usual distance is 12in. to
16in. When horse or mechani-
cal implements are used the
distance would be 21 in. to 36in.
Seeding-rate per acre varies
according to row distances. At
16in. apart about 41b. of first-
grade seed is required. This will
be reduced to Hlb. at 36in.
Spacing is important to bulb
development, and five to seven
plants to the foot is a safe
margin.
Ringworm.
“M.” Clip the hair closely
around the affected parts and
soften the crusts and scales with
olive-oil. Wash off with warm
soapy water to which a little
washing-soda has been added,
clean and dry the parts and
apply 2i per cent, tincture of
iodine twice a day until the bare
patches become covered with a
healthy growth of young hair.
All debris and washing cloths
should be burnt and receptacles
sterilised after use. Calves and
yearlings low in condition fall
ready victims.
Hints for the Farm.
“C.A.A.”: When sending pigs
to market or shows bruising will
be avoided if bags of straw are
hung on the sides of crates or
trucks. Separate boars and sows
of different ages by hurdles.
“Big Billy”: Celery leaf-spot,
late blight of tomatoes and
potatoes and downy mildew on
onions may be prevented by
spraying at about 10-day inter-
vals with Bordeaux mixture
(4oz. of bluestone and sioz. of
hydrated lime in 4gal. of water)
or with copper oxychloride (3oz.
to 4gal. of water).
“Big Billy”: If swedes won’t
get going an ounce of complete
fertiliser per square yard on
each side of drill will help. They
do best in acid soils with a good
humus content. Thin them to
6in. apart at an early stage.
“My”: Vitamin A in the
poultry diet is necessary for
both growth and egg-produc-
tion and for resistance to
diseases. The vitamin is most
easily supplied by greenstuff. If
this is not available fish-oil
should be mixed with the mash.
“A-Jay”: Heavy losses from
sleepy-sickness in ewes carrying
twins or heavy single lambs may
be prevented by seeing that ewes
don’t suffer a check just before
lambing. If necessary, they
should be divided into early- and
late-lambers and drafted on to
the best feed available three to
four weeks before lambing.
Poor feed for five weeks before
lambing can take over half-a-
pound off the fleece.
“Jonax”; Veranda - fllooring
laid parallel to the wall collects
water in the grooves, causing
rapid deterioration. Laid at
right-angles to the wall, water
follows the grooves and is dis-
charged over the edge of the
veranda. Necessity for renewal
under this method is consider-
ably delayed, and when the time
does come it is only necessary to
renew back to the first joist
with short lengths.
“Dot”: An amateur car-
penter, my hubby finds a spent
ball-point pen excellent for
marking softwoods. More
accurate than a pencil, it doesn’t
need sharpening.
“Ethel M.”: How long will
mixed mash retain its
good quality? When food
is unpalatable there is
a lower consumption of it,
loss of bodily condition and, as
a result, with fowls, fewer and
smaller eggs. Stale feed, how-
ever, will not cause disease in
fowls, though caked and mouldy
stuff may cause digestive upsets.
Freshly-milled mash, well stored,
will keep for a month without
deterioration.
“Girrawheen”: One cannot
wait to cull sometimes until
fowls, finishing their season’s
laying, show all the signs of the
typical non-layer. There is
often considerable lapse of time
from the laying of the last egg
and the shrivelling of comb and
abdomen, which are unmistak-
able signs. As a rule,
immediately the comb starts to
lose its bright color and to
shrink ever so slightly it is safe
to conclude the egg-production
season has stopped, and culling
can then be safely done.

How to Become a
Lion-tamer.
Whilst it is true that the
popularity of this profession has
lately led to fears that it may
become an overcrowded one,
those who intend adopting it
may be reassured by the know-
ledge that the high incidence of
expendability among top
trainers, who are sometimes
called upon to handle a whole
pride of lions, some of whom
may get behind him while he is
rebuking a recalcitrant in front,
will always ensure that some
vacancies exist.
One of the first essentials is
the selection of appropriate
clothes. The traditional military-
type mess-jacket with its strands
of white braid across the chest,
jodhpurs and knee-boots, may be
right enough for the actual per-
formance, but not for training
and rehearsals —lions like to see
something unusual. A suitable
ensemble would be a straw-hat
<S\j)
“ Ladies! Ladies! Please keep to the Marquess of
Queensberry rules.”
(clipped by cord to the lapel in
case it is blown off your head
by the draught created when all
the lions roar simultaneously), a
singlet with a batswing collar,
but no tie, green velvet knicker-
bockers and a pair of diver’s
boots.
As thus you enter their cage
for the first time the lion’s faces
will fall open in astonishment at
the spectacle you present and
then they will cock their heads
on one side in puzzlement as
they try to work out why there
is no bow-tie with the batswing
collar. This will divert them
from the realisation, which must
be patent to them were they not
otherwise engaged, that you are
a tyro at the game. When their
initial surprise starts to wear
off, pull out a clay pipe, jam a
cigar into it and light up. Again
they will be diverted from nasty
thoughts by this sacrilegious way
of treating an aristocratic smoke,
and thus you will get a breath-
ing-space to sum them up.
You will find that simulating
a noise like an African veldt at
sunrise will greatly help in bring-
ing your charges to a degree of
nostalgic contentment and
placidity that will render your
coming tasks the easier. On the
other hand, never make a noise
like a lioness.
The reason for wearing
divers’ boot is obvious. Whilst
they have a certain disadvantage
in that they render you slightly
less mobile than would a pair of
running shoes, it will pay divi-
dends in case the lions’ realisa-
tion of your potentiality as a
meal becomes stronger than their
interest in their work. In con-
tradistinction to the pelican, the
cormorant and the python,
which swallow their prey head-
first, lions prefer to start on
their human victims from the
feet and work up towards the
neck. The irresistible attraction
of tanned leather as an hors
d’oeuvre as well as a natural
digestion aid (like stones are to
the crocodile) is said to be re-
sponsible for this inversion of
the usual method of mastication.
Should you happen to slip over
while at work in the cage and a
king of beasts starts in to gnaw
you, he will soon be compelled
to regard with some dismay and
no little chagrin the heap of his
teeth that will be lying around
as the result of his clashing
them on to the leaden boots.
This must inevitably discourage
him from using further intimi-
datory tactics and make him
realise the futility of further
fury, unless he is prepared for
the rest of his life to eat stew,
tripe and other such dishes in
which no chewing is required.
Never depend, as some reck-
less professionals do, on holding
in the left hand, as protection,
an Austrian chair, a leg of
which, poked down the open maw
of an infuriated lion, will reach
no further than halfway down
to his gullet, and will therefore
cause him no more inconveni-
ence than the snapping-off of the
chair-leg. Imagine your pre-
dicament should the four legs
go and you are left holding a
smooth round seat! You might
as well wave an ice-cream wafer
at him.
Do the job properly and step
boldly into the cage holding in
the left hand a settee, in the right
a Sten-gun to the barrel of which
is fastened a stockwhip. The
settee will keep the animals at
a greater distance than an
Austrian chair, though the slight
tendency to arm-tiredness will
require shorter sessions ; this can
be made up by having more of
them.
Above all, remember that
once you have given a lion an
order to do something you must
be firm. Should he sulkily refuse
to leap through the blazing hoop
or stand on his head, stride up
to him resolutely, seize his front
paw and squeeze hard. (Or is
this what you do to a bulldog to
make him let go his grip?) Any-
way, it is worth trying, for bold
measures will arouse a lion’s
admiration and respect. Pulling
a whisker out will quickly put
an obstreperous lion in his place.
Once will be enough—it is bad
animal psychology to humiliate
him more than necessary to
ensure strict obedience and
show him who is the master.
Many untamed lions are given
to roaring defiantly when they
are being “broken-in.” As this
would prevent your hearing what
orders you are shouting, thus
confusing you, steps must be
taken to quieten any lion indulg-
ing in this. This is best done by
conducting a domestic argument
with your wife, whom you will
station outside the cage. When
she roars back at you the lion,
a sagacious animal, will quickly
realise the futility of trying to
compete against that, and will
forthwith desist.
Teaching a lion to do a back-
somersault is quite a simple
matter. Stand him on an elevated
platform, put your settee and
Sten-gun down within easy
reach and start juggling four
balls. The lion will naturally
follow the balls round with his
eyes, which will start to revolve,
rendering him giddy. A quick
push in the chest then and he
will execute a perfect somersault,
and after repeating this several
times he will do it automatically
to orders.
Bo.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The People’s Conscience
Why is it that, over the last few years,
one is so often confronted with Govern-
ment actions which fill one with a sense
of shame? Is it because of a growing con-
tempt for individual rights caused by
war-time economy?
These misdeeds are not confined to any
political group, and are performed
equally by Federal and State authorities.
Here are some typical instances:
The taking-over for settlement pur-
poses of country acres and homes at pro-
foundly unfair valuations, and with a
lack of consideration that Bulletin
articles have noted.
Similar acquisitions near towns for
housing projects; in these cases the
sweeping acquisitorfal actions seem calcu-
lated to upset and rob the maximum
possible number of private individuals
trying to build their own homes.
The contemptible handling methods
used on people such as old Mrs.
Murphy, whose only crime was to own
a home where the community interests
called for an extension to Essendon air-
port, and whom the community there-
fore surely desired should merely be
placed with gentleness and respect for
her age in another equivalent home.
The pushing-round of Australia’s
“Manila girls” and the Indonesian
O'Connells.
The suggestion of Governmental
searching for a means whereby a grab
could be made at the copper
ingots lately won outside Australian
waters by intrepid salvage, but tempor-
arily deposited at an Australian port.
The abominable operations in the
name of “provisional tax” by which
individuals are mulcted, no matter on
what excuse, of a larger sum than has
been earned in that year.
The very thought of taxing such
individuals as Dr. Bowen, awarded a tax-
free £12,000 by the British Government
for his war-time country-saving work on
radar, but from whom the Federal
authorities would like to drag £BOOO in
tax, despite their holding as tax-free any
similar amount won in a lottery.
Is any one of us happy to be regarded
as an individual giving his full consent
and approval to these actions allegedly
done in our collective community
interest? How to prevent these happen-
ings is another matter. As the per-
petrators are supposed to be people who
notoriously keep one ear carefully to the
ground, it seems fairly obvious that the
first line of action is to make a noise,
voicing our contempt for un-British con-
duct of any description whereve'r it
occurs. We should at least make it plain
that those officials who mishandle
individuals are not going to shelter
behind any spurious assertion that they
are carrying out the will of the com-
munity.—H. B. B. (Vic,).
Road Dangers
Just how much do plumbers and
drainers, including employees of the
Water and Sewerage Board, gas com-
panies and similar bodies, contribute to
the toll of the road by the dangerous
condition in which they often leave public
streets after opening up a channel to
repair or renew service pipes? Driving
at night, particularly in wet weather, the
motorist is often confronted with a deep
channel left across an asphalt road. It
is not uncommon to see these channels
many inches deep, but some employees
go to the other extreme and leave a
ridge many inches higher than the road-
level, which is just as dangerous as the
channel. —W. P. T. (N.S.W.),
Wars
There was something curiously
ingenuous about the statement by Gordon
Dean, chairman of the United States
Atomic Energy Commission, that it is a
pity mankind cannot go back to the days
of the bow and arrow. Apparently the
assumption is that war was a less frightful
business in ancient times than it is today.
But war and its restriction has always
been a pathological problem, and its
frightfulness and savagery, viewed

historically, only differ in scale. The
odd delusion persists that the bow and
arrow wpre a sort of child’s toy in the
kindergarten of Mars. Actually, the long-
bow was one of the deadliest weapons of
history. The clouds of 3ft. arrows fired
from 6ft. bows of yew by the bowmen
of Edward 111 at Crecy in 1346 cut
down the charging French knights with
the same terrible effectiveness as massed
machine-gun fire.
The longbow arrow could pierce two
layers of mail. In a trial made before
Edward VI in 1550, arrows were shot
through a lin. board of well-seasoned
timber at an effective range of 250yds.
Its use in medieval times inspired the
same abhorrence as the atom-bomb
today. It was regarded as a scoundrel’s
weapon and an invention of the devil.
Use of the crossbow, the most deadly
missile-thrower before the introduction
of the longbow, was forbidden—except
against infidels —in 1139 by the Second
Lateran Council under penalty of
anathema, “as a weapon hateful to God
and unfit for Christians.”
As for large-scale massacre, the atom-
bombing of Hiroshima was not more
frightful than the storming of Magdeburg
by Tilly during the ferocious Thirty
Years’ War in 1631, when 30,000 inhabi-
tants were put to the sword.
One of the deadliest weapons of ail
time was Greek-fire, or “sea-fire,” the
secret of which perished with the
Byzantines. It was an oleaginous, inflam-
mable mixture which ignited on contact
with water and thus could not be
extinguished. It was fired like a pro-
jectile, and its use enabled the Byzantines
to destroy the Moslem fleets at the first
and second sieges of Constantinople. In
941 and 1043 two Russian fleets were
similarly destroyed.
Siege-engines of classical and medieval
times were weapons of frightful ingenuity.
Cowper, in The Art of Attack, describes
how mangonels and trebuchets in the
Middle Ages threw millstones, flaming
projectiles, putrid corpses and live men
into besieged towns. A dead horse,
bundled up and shot by the trebuchet
into a town in which the defenders were
half-dead with starvation, started a
pestilence.
William of Malmesbury describes the
Turks at Antioch throwing from their
petraries (catapults) the heads of towns-
men into the Frankish camp. Worse than
all, an envoy or messenger was sometimes
tied up alive and cast back into the
town. Froissart actually describes such
an act at the siege of Auberoche. — Glem
Lack (Q.).
Port of Newcastle
Over the best part of a century genera-
tions of officials and others interested in
the Hunter Valley have been making plans
and shelving them in departmental pigeon-
holes. The report of the Hunter River
Flood Mitigation Committee is the result,
and it, too, has become stale with age.
Every time the question has been
resurrected the situation has become more
difficult and the remedies more costly,
until now nothing but a major operation
.will serve even to ameliorate the mass
of accumulated problems.
But it should not be necessary to scrap
the port of Newcastle as suggested by
“Arbee” (B. 9/I/’52), for Newcastle
harbor could be quite happy as a tidal
port if relieved of its silt. Far better
surely to separate Newcastle from the
Hunter River.
After all, the port does not depend
upon water from the Hunter to maintain
its water-levels. All the Hunter contri-
butes to the port is silt, and there is
probably enough of that to reclaim the
whole area of creeks and waterways in
the bottled-up delta.
In these days of modern river-training
methods and modern dredging machinery,
it is possible to visualise Newcastle
harbor as a tidal harbor extending up
South Channel as far as the apex of the
delta above Hexham and down to the
Stockton bank. That would mean
diversion of the Hunter to the North
Channel and out to sea via Fullarton
cove and Tilligerry Creek, with perhaps a
cut through the narrow neck north of
Stockton. A major reclamation scheme
as well as harbor-clearance.
The Nobby’s entrance to the Hunter
is not a natural entrance, but Newcastle
is there because it is on ground too hard
to be scoured out by jdoodwaters. A new
exit is certainly necessary if the port is
to remain open to large shipping, for silt-
ing will get worse. With the blocking-
up of the river channels floodwaters will
rise ever higher, and despite levee banks
and bunds the river will always win, as
it did on the Mississippi, where it swept
through bunds over 60ft. high.
But the silt deposits can be useful if
helped and directed. In the Irrawaddy
delta, where annual floods are the rule,
large areas have been reclaimed by block-
ing an outlet and dumping trees or brush-
wood to assist settlement of the silt. The
same can be done in the bottled-up delta
of the Hunter. — Irrawaddy (N.S.W.).
Fire-fighting
Australian States need not go to
George R. Stewart’s documentary novel
Fire (B. 2/1/ ’52) for an up-to-date bush-
fire-fighting organisation. The Victorian
set-up, despite the recent serious out-
break, is considered by fire-fighting
experts as good as any in the world.
Already in the last decade 8500 miles
of road have been built into the Victorian
forests to allow fire-fighting crews to
reach an outbreak before it spreads too
far. Add also 110 observation-points,
mainly high towers, scattered throughout
the forest areas, and two R.A.A.F. air-
craft on immediate stand-by ready to
patrol the State. All taking part are
members of one big team and all are in
radio or telephonic communication.
As in America, modern equipment has
been bought. Many bulldozers are in use
to clear brakes, there’s ample water either
laid on, carried or available through
mobile pumps, and an abundance of saws
to fell heavy burning timber.
A helicopter is also on stand-by in
Victoria to take fighters to isolated spots,
but the Forestry Commission and the
Country Fire Authority insist that no
parachutes be used. Explosions are too
frequent among the tips of the burning
gums in the southern State.
In many respects Victoria is ahead of
America, particularly with its campaign
to educate the public. More than 99 per
cent, of fires today are man-made, and
the Victorian Forestry Commission has
spent much time teaching the public the
danger of bushfire peril.
Since Victoria’s disastrous fires in
January, 1939, when 72 people lost their
lives, “Prevent Bushfire” signs have been
hung everywhere. They stress the danger
of leaving burning fires or throwing away
lighted cigarettes. Others remind
passers-by of the ’39 tragedy. Special
pictures are shown in theatres, and
schoolchildren are educated to be careful
with fire at all times.
Other States could well take a page
from the Victorian bushfire-fighting
book. Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.).
