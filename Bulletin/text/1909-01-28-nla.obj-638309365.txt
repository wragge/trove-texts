The RED PAGE
Some Remarks About Remarks
IjINGLAND is a paradise for the
y people who write about what othe
people have written. Literature
to most of the dull reviews, consists o:
criticism of literature. It is easier to
geiMnto a magazine with Remarks about
Matthew Arnold’s Remarks about other
people’s Remarks than with an opinion
of one’s own about life. Consequently, it
is an impertinence and an excrescence
and an unnecessary bunion for a critic to
criticise R. A. Scott-James’ criticism oi
other writers’ criticism of life ; but as it
has been adequately explained upon this
page that nobody by any chance can be
original, this critic cannot be restrained
from making a few remarks about Scott-
James’ remarks upon Modernism ancl
Romance (John Lane).
W
Scott-James writes well, and is lazily
readable. He takes for his subject only
living writers, anu contrives to find 42
of them worth discussing at length. 'His
range is from Correlli to Galsworthy, but
careful search reveals no trace of Snaith.
(This seems to lend credence to the
accusation hurled at the writer of this
page that he invented Snaith. But,
with so many wearisome novelists to re-
view, why invent another ?) And in all
his studies Scott-James seeks to discover
some guiding principle in modern litera-
ture, some indication of the manner, the
speed, and the direction of its going.
And (at first) he sees in science the mur-
der of romance.
If we had knowledge and absolute certainty
there could be no such thing as romance for
us. If science held absolute sway we should
never be disappointed and we should never
hope.
So he finds that science has united
itself to the study of nature and given
birth to the psychological novel.
Literature has been democratised; it has
been disseminated among widely differing
classes of the community, the majority of
which care for books just as far as they prove
agreeable to the individual tastes of them-
selves, the readers. The literary values have
altered, so that most people no longer ask
whether this or that work conforms to the
standards set up by the classics of the
language, but whether it stimulates them as
individuals, whether it finds a response in
their own possibly mis-shapen emotional
fabric—whether, in fact, it matters to them.
Scott-James states this fact with a
sigh, yet is it not—in this modern world
—the sole literary criterion ? Books are
of value only in so far as they interest
their readers ; and the “ classics of the
language ” become classics only because
they interested their readers. They re-
main classics only so long as they interest
us. All of which is heresy.
vl/
The chief discovery of R. A. Scott-
James is that the age, and therefore its
literature, has become self-conscious :
The great evil of our age is that we are
constantly and terribly aware of evil.
This is an age in which, and in whose
literature, the intellect has triumphed
over the heart. In Meredith we see
thought and heart almost evenly balanced,
the overweight being on the side of thought.
11l his books the emotions are always
subordinated to a theory of character.
And in this rising tide of the scientific
spirit what has become of the poet ?
Necessarily he has had to become self-
conscious. Scott-James, in an interesting
chapter, discloses the self-consciousness
of Yeats, Phillips and Davidson. The
modern poet has a hard row to hoe.
His theme must somehow be made to
interpret the concrete realities of life, and
the modern poet must face the difficulty of
making beauty out of the unbeautiful,
imagination out of the insolently practical,
meaning and truth out of the prosaic corre-
lation of facts given in the self-subsistent
universe of science.
As “ Dante made poetry out of Hell,”
the modern poet must make verses out of
Us.
The author, at the end, finds a way out
of this self-conscious, pseudo-scientific
age. It is the New Romance personified
by Stevenson, W. J. Locke, and Conrad.
Here, he says, we have stumbled upon a
literature which gives us the old thrill of
romance without seeking to wean us from
the modern habit of mind.
\l/
Some acute criticisms of living writers
are to be found in this book. He ana-
lyses the pessimism of Thomas Hardy :
He does not deny God ; but he asserts
that if there is a God, He is not a good or a
beneficent ruler in the sense that we under-
stand goodness and beneficence, and that
men, judged from our own human stand-
point, are, on the whole better, kinder, more
merciful, and more sympathetic than the
Being who created them.
And of Corelli he has the just word :
Her success is, perhaps, like that of the
Hyde Park orator. She pronounces t autJis
which it would be folly not to know, and she
pronounces them truculently. Many pe<> >le
necessarily applaud, because they are grati-
fied to find that their own intellectual stock-
in-trade is shouted out by a distinguished
writer as if it constituted a great and novel
discovery. To state the obvious violently,
to attack public scandals with clear and
fluent invective, to say what the man in the
street says, but to say it a little more rhe-
torically—that is her art.
He omits Kipling because he speaks
“of authors who are not only, as Mr.
Kipling once was, a vital, moving force
among us, but who are themselves
moved, as he is not, by the spirit opera-
tive among us to this day. Young as he
is, he has done his work.”
Like Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, he lived
as a force among us in the ’nineties; he
belonged to the restless, ambitious, im-
perial age which flung us with exultation
into the South African War. . . . The man
belongs to the moment, and the moment has
passed for Mr. Kipling, whose magic seems
to have rested on a faculty for apprehending
one, and only one, phase of the national
temper.
Shaw, too, is omitted, for a converse
reason.
Sometimes he seems to be the living em-
bodiment of the present age’s vast pseudo-
scientific, self-conscious Interrogatory, in
that sense he is the very spirit and essence
of the early twentieth century sublimed into
its own reductio ad absurdu/m ; whence it
follows that he is the subject of three-fourths
of this book, though his name may not be
mentioned twice. Has he not himself con-
fessed that his life is the history of the last
century ?
o—-—
It’s all very well (writes “ Inky Roo ”) for
“P. Winkle” to say the London papers
may keep you waiting for your cash, once
they accept your stuff, but the Australian
ink-slinger ought to be used to that little
game. The Bulletin and The Lone Hand , bless
their little hearts, can’t be expected to print
all the yarns of all the scribes available.
And look at the manners and customs of the
other papers that pay at all. The
Sydney Mail accepts your stuff with
beautiful alacrity, in a fortnight at most,
but there the fun ends. They ac-
cepted a yarn of mine in April, 1907,
and I’ve been waiting, and watching
lovingly for it ever since. When I
write and inquire after its health
they either ignore the question, or say it is
waiting for a special number, which never
comes. The same thing has happened with
other yarns in the same quarter. Then there
is The Australasian l I’m firmly convinced
that rag pays its staff’s salaries out of the
stamps sent by unwary contributors. I sent
’em two MSS. at the beginning of 1907, and
waited with the patience of Job’s grand-
mother for an answer. When nothing hap-
pened in a few months I wrote and enclosed
a second batch of stamps for their return.
Nothing came of it. I did ditto with ditto
result, and finally, in a frenzy, I sent both
MSS. elsewhere, and they were accepted and
published. To-day , 9th January, 1909,
both came home to roost, with “ Declined
with thanks, The Australasian,” neatly
pinned to their little tails.
C. E. W. Bean, who voyaged in the
Powerful as special correspondent of the
Herald to meet the American Fleet at Auck-
land, writes picturesquely and well of naval
matters. His republished articles, With the
Flagship of the South (W. Brooks, Sydney),
are stirring reading, and the illustrations are
artistic. He describes the working of a war-
ship as if he knew his subject; and the book
deserves a wide Australasian public. He is
insistent upon the need of an Australian
Navy. “The Australian Navy must come
whether or no.”
Empty Australia
A book that emphasises the emptiness of
our North is Lonely Lands, the account of
Francis E. Birtles’ courageous bicycle ride
through the heart of Australia (N.S.W.
Bookstall Co.). Birtles is no writer; but
his narrative gives a graphic picture of the
hardships that await the explorer of our own
continent, and the determination necessary
to carry through a tremendous undertaking.
Starting from Sydney, Birtles rode north to
Bowen, thence north-west, via .the head of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Darwin, return-
ing along the overland telegraph line to
Adelaide, and so back—thirteen months
later, after having covered 8300 miles—to
Sydney. The stamina required for such a
trip need not be emphasised. He had
to “plug” through sand and mud, over
creeping vines and through scrub, through
cane grass three times his height, assailed by
swarms of flies, black beetles, ants, and mos-
quitoes ; and more than once he was in danger
of his life from hostile blacks. Often he
was stuck up by floods, and several times
had to hang his machine on a tree and
trudge back for stores. He got fever and
).11 >st r.of the* other diseases of the desert.
Avd yet he came through, and contrived to
bring back a valuable series of photographs.
His aim, beyond the itch for exploration,
was the practical one of “finding out the
possibilities of planting a white population
in the northern lands that lie between us and
those Asiatic hordes that might at any
moment swarm across the. Torre s Straits and
invade our unguarded shores.” He did a
practical service in charting the dis-
tances between waterholes by means of
the cyclometer. It is intended to
publish these records in the Queens-
land papers for the benefit of stock-
travellers. And the appalling emptiness of
these spaces ! Between Daly and the
Catherine River he went a whole week’s
journey without meeting a single soul. But
at that river he went boating two hundred
nfiles inland, in a country which, but a few
years ago, was popularly supposed to be a
desert. But the Asiatic was there—in force.
“There are many mines about the country
absolutely controlled by the Chinese, though
popularly believed to be white men’s pro-
perty. Indeed, there is scarcely a paying
business of any kind but what has Chinese
capital behind it, and this will be a serious
factor in the future development of the
country.” But Birtles has no doubts abo'ut
the suitability of the White Man for the
occupation of the North, though apparently
he favors “ some form of cheap labor,”
which, of course, stultifies his conception of
a White Australia.
Hewlett’s Halfway House.
At last Maurice Hewlett has caught up to
his age. He began with The Forest Lovers,
a medieval romance; he ventured into his-
torical times with Richard Yea-and-Nay,
and The Queen’s Quair, lingering a while in
bygone Italy with his Little Novels, hm Fond
Adventures, and his Fool Errant, came nearer
with his Stooping Lady, flitted for a holiday
to Spain with The Spanish Jade, and has
now caught up to the twentieth century with
his charming Halfway House (Chapman and
Hall, per Roycroft Library, Sydney).
In his Stooping Lady and this latest work
Hewlett has assumed the robe relinquished
by Meredith. This in a .writer less indi-
vidual would be an impertinence ; in Hew-
lett it is but the possibly unconscious
absorption of the method of a master,
due to the probability that the modern
psychological novel requires for its full
development the Meredithian manner and
the style of Henry James. For it is
almost impossible now for a modern novelist
to escape the dominance of these two mas-
ters. May Sinclair, Galsworthy, Snaith,
have all succumbed to the subtle influence of
Henry James ; and many of the younger
novelists have paid the tribute of imitation
to George Meredith. It is, however, a
tribute that Meredith would not carp at, for
it is rather a saturation of his method, with-
out the strangeness of his style, than a ser-
vile copying of his technique. And in
Hewlett’s case, in acquiring the Meredithian
precision he has not lost the Hewlett
charm. For it is apparent in his latest
book that Hewlett wears his rue with
a difference. Meredith peers benignly down
from his eminence at these poor fools of
mortals ; Hewlett stands at their side,
friendlily. He has more of the lover in him,
less of the philosopher. Yet he has boldly
adopted one of Meredith’s most characteristic
idiosyncrasies. This is the character of the
philosopher Senhouse, the candid, uncon-
ventional young man who voices the private
sentiments of the novelist, and in return
for his consideration, at the end is given the
heroine. And in the scheme of the book,
the marriage of a poor young girl, with
nothing but her youth and her looks, to a
charming old gentleman, with nothing but
his wealth and his desire to play the part of
a genial providence, the reader recognises a
subject made to Meredith’s hand. And even
in his dialogue he recalls his master.
Hewlett makes his characters speak like this:
“ I shall see you to-morrow, perhaps. I
play cricket forSoames.” Now, .do English-
men use the locution “I play,” instead of
the more colloquial “ I’m playing”? Cer-
tainly it is rarely used in Australasia. Is it
merely a crick of Meredith’s style, caught
unawares by his too enthusiastic disciple ?
W
However, we find enough of Hewlett to
condone his borrowings. He contrives to
make those borrowings his own—even to
make them seem inevitable. There is Hew-
lett, and only Hewlett, in his opening sen-
tences, perusing which what reader would
not be lured to read on ?
“It was when Mr. John Germain, a gen-
tleman of fifty, was paying one of his yearly
visits to his brother James . . . that an
adventure of a sentimental kind presented
itself to him, engaged him, carried him into
mid-air upon a winged horse, and set him
treading clouds and suchlike filmy footing.
Chance-caught combinations, associations
tenderly touched—what do I know ? He
had a vision, and located it; he dreamed a
dream, and began to live it out ; into a sim-
ple maid he read a young goddess, into a
lover’s ardent form lie pressed his leanness
and grey hairs.”
And the girl has all the lush freshness,
the tremendous femininity, of the Hewlett
heroine. She had ‘* a dewy freshness upon
her—rather the appearance of having been
newly kissed,” “hot eyes,” and so forth.
“She was very woman to the extremities.
Nothing more feminine than she had ever
been taken from the side of man, or been
more strongly inclined to go back again.”
So in his Other characters lie makes many
an apt stroke of humorous delineation :
“ Mrs. Duplessis had been handsome, and
remembered it. Everything about her
person reminded her of that—her langor,
her elegance, her thin hands, her fine com-
plexion, her tall son. ‘ How I survived the
birth of. that great boy passes my compre-
hension. My nerves, you know ! My dear
Hector, all fire as he was, had the tact of a
woman. “Ma mie,” he said, “ never again ;
or I accuse myself of murder. Henceforward
lam a monk.” He kept his word, but it
killed him. Do not men die for women ?
My poor, brave Hector ! ’ ”
The character of the elderly lover is an
exquisite cameo, cunningly and painstak-
ingly drawn. It will live with the best of
Hewlett’s characterisations. And the woman
is alive. But the philosopher Seehouse is
too obviously a bookish invention. He
poses, he is not sound flesh and blood. He
is the sort of hero a sentimental Miss would
have drawn. He is nothing but an echo of
Meredithian whimsicality. But the book
will repay reading. Hewlett is finding his
foothold in modern life. He has arrived at
his halfway house.
The Maoriland Attorney-General, J. C.
Findlay, has a Maoriland reputation as a
lecturer, and in Humbugs and Homilies
(Whitcombe and Tombs, M.L.) he has col-
lected a series of his public deliverances upon
subjects that include such miscellaneous
matter as, “ Respectability—its Rise and
Remedy,” “Woman as a Poet, ” “The Shake-
speare Enigma,” and “ The Decline of
Political Economy.” The essays are scholarly,
witty and genial. Perhaps the most interest-
ing is an account of a voyage with R. L.
Stevenson.
For the curious, W. P. Courtney’s Secrets
of our National Literature (Constable) is
possibly worth reading. The author sets
forth the history of the books which have
been publishted in England without the
author’s name or with some disguise. The
result is an interesting account of anon-
ymity, but, owing to the scope of the sub-
ject, it is admittedly incomplete.
The seeker after sensation will find a
plethora of it in Bushmen All, by Giles
Seagram (Cole, Melb.). There are enough
fights in it to compensate for any lack of
literary style.

A WONDERFUL CURE
FOR INDIGESTION
REDFERN TESTIMONY.
“Each morning I woke with the consciousness
that something was not right,” remarked Mr.
William Johnston, of No. 127 Eveleigh Street,
Redfern, to a newspaper representative, who was
making some enquiries. Continuing he said :“I
felt as if I was in for a spell of sickness, and, sure
enough, those misgivings foretold what afterwards
happened. You see, the heat was pretty consider-
able where I was, up at Mole, seventy miles from
Warren, 115 deg. in the shade for a week at a
stretch being regarded as only a fleabite to what
could happen when the sun was in good form, and
too much of that sort of business gets on a man’s
nerves, and runs him down a bit, I tell you, and
I think I ought to know.”
“Of course, because you are speaking from ex-
perience,” interrupted the scribe.
4 ‘ Exactly. There were a good few of us working
at an artesian bore, which ejected soda water—
without. I need scarcely remark, any whisky in it
—and too much soda straight is not good. In-
deed, it proved very bad for us, and as we never
got within reach of anything in the way of vege-
tables, it is only to be expected that the conse-
quences were very bad for the blood. Mine, like
the rest, was in a terrible state, sores breaking out
in all directions, and the flies were so troublesome
that we had to go away and sit in the dark to get
a little peace. The remedies I tried to put myself
in order with were of no avail, and my sufferings
became unbearable. When I sat down to a meal
I would get half way through when an attack of
retching always occurred, so no wonder my strength
fell off like it did. I became as weak as a kitten,
and, the work being laborious, I could not keep
going. Matters were about at their worst, when
the overseer went over to Bourke, and returned
with some Clements Tonic for the men, and I give
you my word as an honorable man, that after I had
taken but one bottle I felt a different being en-
tirely. The headaches that I had beforehand
were enough to destroy one’s happiness, without
anything else; but, besides, I had most of those
wretched symptoms which usually accompany in-
digestion. To begin with, my chest felt quite )
clogged up, as though I had swallowed a lump of
dough that was clogging the breathing passages
and about my loins. I felt as if I had been beaten
with a stick—sore and aching. Again, under the
blades of my shoulders there were shap, pricking
sensations as if a needle were at work, and in
addition to all else, there was a perpetual feeling
of weariness as if I had run myself to death.
When getting out of bed of a morning, I would
have to hold on to it to steady myself, the dizzi-
ness being so great that I would have overbalanced,
and all the time I was going down-hill fast. My
weight was disappearing in a most alarming man-
ner, and I dread to think of what would have
happened had not Clements Tonic made its timely
appearance, through the kindness of our overseer.”
“ He had probably used it himself on some pre-
vious occasion ? ” hazarded the writer.
“Hesaid so, and swore by it. Thereisnomed-
icine in the world to equal Clements Tonic, he
used to say, and, my word, he was right, for it
fixed us up splendidly. Its purifying effects on
my blood cannot be too highly spoken of. Enough
to say that the sores soon disappeared, after which
I rested better. I began to eat more freely and
regularly under Clements Tonic’s influence, and
the retching after meals became a thing of the
past. And if Clements Tonic cannot cure indi-
[ gestion quicker than anything else, I’m a Dutch-
man. It put me right out of touch with each
symptom belonging to that complaint in no time;
then it added to its wonderful work by steadying
my nerves, and giving me as much strength as a
man could wish for. Whenever I meet a person,
either man or woman, suffering in any particular
like I did myself, I just tell them what I know
Clements Tonic can do, as in my case, and if they
don’t go and get a bottle or two of that remedy,
then all I can say is, they deserve to suffer. Pub-
lish this any way you please.”

We live on a Pie
You and I!
We love and we marry,
We trust and we pay,
We go to Old Harry—
Or don’t. It’s the way
Of the World —
(And the World is a Pie !)
O ! we live and we die,
And we cherish and trust,
And we smile and we sigh,
As we dote on the crust —
On the crust of this wonderful Pie !
( You and I
On the Crust of a Pie /)
Oh, ask me not why
This Great Pie
Is swinging and winging
Its wonderful way,
Whilst angels are bringing
The Night and the Day
To the World
(Which, of course, is the Pie).
Oh, we rush and fly
At a terrible pace
Thro’ the waste of the Sky,
And it leaves not a trace
Does our very reliable Pie —
Good old Pie l
There’s no aeroplane like our old Pie !
This singular Pie
The Sun’s eye,
So red and suspicious,
Discovers each day
In slumber delicious;
It was made the wrong way—
Underdone !
It’s an Underdone Pie
We are on—you and I.
And the oven wherein
The Great Cook used to pry,
• Was it steel ? Was it tin ?
Did it blow up one day ? Did the Pie
Fall from high ?
(Oh! the Cook staring after His Pie !)
This Excellent Pie
You and I
Have newly discovered
Was made for us two;
It whirled and it hovered
The long ages thro’,
Waiting there like a good, patient Pie
In the Dish of the Sky,
Whilst we wandered about,
Knowing not whence or why
Thro’ the great noisy rout
That is wandering loose on the Pie.
(You and I,
We inherit the Pie!)
As it flies thro’ the Sky,
This tender old Pie,
As it wings,
As it swings
In the Sun’s jovial eye;
As it sweeps with delight
Thro’ the well of the Night,
As it rolls
On its poles,
Do I look
In two beautiful eyes
That are tender and wise,
And I thank that Incompetent Cook.

The Shadow-Third.
The sun was hot on the street outside ; a thunder-
cloud in the west hung grey ;
We heard the roll of the city carts; a band where
some men made holiday ;
And you and I, in a darkened room, were face to
face by a window screen.
Did you see, with angry eyes on mine, the slim,
white figure that stood between ?
Someone, who silently entered in, to join us there
in that quiet spot;
Someone who, twining wreaths of flowers, our
poppy-scarlets—you had forgot.
Mad musics, breaking thro’ leafage green, had
drowned the voice that is cold and thin,
The voice that stirred in the dusk to-day, like
prisoned sobs in a violin ;
Tho’ the swelling note of your passion’s call had
stilled that cry in the first, wild days,
As flaring lights in a perfumed room will kill a
filter of pale moon-rays,
To-day you sat with your eyes on mine ; the Hate
of a wearied man was there,
Because of a slender shape that came, to take,
unquestioned, the vacant chair.
X was the woman of Yesterday; there are To-
morrows ... for life is long;
A man must weary of hackneyed tunes —a man
must sing him a newer song ;
Much is to do in this busy world—you frowned on
me, and you wished me gone,
And, far away in the sun-gold street, with flying
banners, the band played 0n....
50... I said gpod-bye... the tears were mine—
the day seemed dark with my heart’s
despair....
You sighed relief... but, I wonder now, does
Truth still sit in that other chair ?

THE GENTLE ART OF BUYING
POLITICAL SUPPORT.
A great art is the art of buying political support.
It may be done coarsely and crudely, and then it
is plain bribery. It may bo done artistically, and
then it is also bribery, but it isn’t called by that
name. The late Duncan Gillies, of Victoria,
did a gigantic system of bribery with his octopus
railway schemes. He proposed to secure the con-
tinued support of a majority of the members
of the Victorian Assembly by giving a little
railway apiece to a majority of the con-
stituencies. Of course, this killed off any pos-
sibility of making great trunk lines where they
were really wanted. It also necessitated the
making of the most railways where there were
already most railways, and, consequently, most
population, because where constituencies were
small three of them might be bribed with
a bit of line which would be lost in one
corner of a big, unpeopled, outlying electorate;
and Duncan loved to make a short railway go a
long way. One great reason why the Victorian
railway system looks like an insane cobweb or
maze instead of a carefully-planned arrangement
for opening up the country is the Gillies idea of
building lines to buy votes instead of to develop
the State. Bent bought support and goodwill
with road and bridge grants, and allowances to
agricultural societies, and such like. The Aus-
tralian Government is in the happy position of
having a Federal capital to give away as a means
of purchasing support, and the capital is appar-
ently to be fixed on exactly the same principle as
Duncan Gillies’ railways or Bent’s road grants.
The construction of a railway through an empty
region may be of immense advantage to the coun-
try by opening up waste places for settle-
ment, but it doesn’t buy many votes for
the moment, for there are not many votes
in the waste places; certainly it doesn’t
buy so many immediate votes as a superfluous
line built in a crowded and already well-railwayed
region. Similarly a Federal capital, if built in a
fertile yet almost empty country where there is
great need to attract population, may be of im-
mense benefit to Australia in the way of pro-
moting settlement (in that way it ranks with a
graduated land-tax). But immediate votes arc
ecarce in such a region, and if the capital is put
on a much inferior site ip a comparatively well-
Se -n u localit y w hich doesn’t need population, it
will buy far more votes at the moment. In this
matter Gillies and Bknt and the Yassberra poli-
ticians are alike. They are—or were—equally
engaged in the game of selling the interests of
Australia for all time in order that a handful of
transient politicians might secure a little tem-
porary advantage.
* * * *
Every State except N.S.W. being disqualified
as a possible site for the capital, most of the repre-
sentatives from the other States could afford to be
fairly honest. As a matter of fact, they weren’t
fairly honest, but they could have been if
honesty had been in them. Some of them
cheerfully voted to throw away all chances of
having a great and prosperous capital which
would bring population to one of the fertile
waste places of Australia, because they
reckoned that Monaro wouldn’t be so easy
to reach as Yassberra during the first year or two,
and therefore the placing of the capital there
would put them to a trifle of inconvenience if
they happened to be still in politics when
Parliament removed to its new quarters.
Some preferred Yassberra as being neater,
for their own convenience, to the Sydney
theatres and more adjacent to Williamson’s
opera show. Others voted for the hopeless place to
preserve the solidarity of the Foreign-trade party
which has its headquarters in Sydney. The
N.S.W. members started on the simple plan that
each one who had a possible site in his own elec-
torate should vote first for that site. So Foster
of New England was simply filled with admira-
tion for Armidale in his own electorate, though
Armidale, being on the roof of things thereabouts,
and having no great overshadowing mountains to
catch the rainfall, couldn’t supply water for a big
city unless by an enormously costly pumping
scheme. Similarly Brown, of Calare, had a holy
reverence for Lyndhurst, on the border of his
electorate; and Eyne was almost struck dumb
with amazement at the advantages of Tumut and
Tooma, in his electorate; and David Hall was
staggered at the advantages of Yassberra, in his
electorate. As a rule, when one of these men
found the site in his own electorate knocked out
he immediately became deeply impressed with the
advantages of the site nearest to his own elec-
torate which still remained in the running.
The natural result was that the site nearest to
the largest number of electorates had great popu-
larity. A profound conviction that there is money
to be made out of the capital, and that even a.
darned poor capital close at hand is better than a
splendid city a long way off, seemed to pervade all
the interested parties. Even State Premier
Wade and the State members from Sydney and
its environs wanted the Australian capital close
to their electorates. And the Herald and Tele-
graph and Evening News wanted the Aus-
tralian metropolis close to their electorates
—these being the localities where their circu-
lation mostly lies. (Monaro isn’t definitely in
the electorate of either the Sydney or Melbourne
papers, and a capital there would almost in-
evitably develop a press of its own, so Monaro has
few friends. And for the same reason a capital
beside the great Katharine River in the Northern
Territory, which might be the best site of all, has
only one friend—the local member.) It naturally
followed that an unconditional surrender to the
Yassberra party was calculated to buy more
friends for ’ the Government than any other
move that could be made. They might not
be very good friends, but they were at least
good enough to enable a Ministry with a weak
following to last a while longer. The Monaro capi-
tal site had acquired, on its merits, many friends
in the States outside N.S.W., but the friendship
—and also the enmity—of the man who has
only the interests of Australia to consider is often
a very pale emotion compared with the frenzy of
the man who has the supposed interests of his
constituency and his chances of re-election to
think of. There are 27 Federal electorates in
N.S.W., and a Yassberra-Jervis Bay Federal
territory is about the nearest possible thing to
14 of them. Also it is nearer to almost
all of them than Monaro is. Then there are
90 State electorates in N.S.W., and Yassberra is
about the nearest possible thing to over 50 of
them. Further, it is the nearest available site to
Gregory Wade’s electorate, and it is far more
within the range of the Wade influence than
Monaro; and, as already mentioned, it is
within the circulation and business constitu-
ency of the Sydney Telegraph and Herald
and Evening News, An unconditional climb
down and an enthusiastic acceptance of Yass-
berra was calculated to make more friends,
of a kind, and to disarm a larger number
of very bitter enemies, than any other possible
move. It is perfectly well known that a great
majority of the Labor caucus regarded Monaro as
being, on its merits, far the best of the proposed
sites in the interests of Australia, for the Labor
party has at least a wider outlook than the Con-
servative push and has something resembling a
conscience. If the Labor party had not been in
office and yearning to retain office it would pro-
bably have kept to its opinion. Being in office,
and anxious to retain office, it threw its con-
victions overboard.
* * * *
The whole business was, as already men-
tioned, Duncan Gillies’ octopus railway de-
vice with variations. Gillies believed in
buying the temporary support of the largest
possible number of constituencies with a
little bit of railway—a branch or cockspur—
apiece. A Federal capital can’t be cut up and
distributed, but the Fisher Government buys the
support of the largest possible number of consti-
tuencies by agreeing to place the capital where it is
supposed these constituencies will make a profit by
it. In one case, the permanent interests of Vic-
toria, as a whole, were sacrificed to the supposed
separate interests of separate bits of Victoria ; in
the other case, the interests of Australia, as a
whole, are sacrificed to the supposed interests
of separate bits of Australia. In one case,
the people whom he fancied he had bought
turned on Gillies, and politically rent him
for the very acts which were intended to
make his position secure; and there, also, the
parallel may hold good. There are two possi-
bilities ahead of an Australian capital at Yass-
berra. If it remains a small town—“a mere
country town,” as the Sydney Telegraph once
put it—it will be of no profit worth mention-
ing to the Telegraph and Herald and Evening
News, and to the Sydney traders, and to the
greedy, short-sighted politicians who clamored
for a place right against their own political
doors ; and they will have degraded Australia to
no purpose. And if it beqomes a great city, then
it will be Sydney’s rival and competitor, right at
Sydney’s own door ; and the Sydney parochialists
willraveathavingtheirsouthern trade intercepted,
and will make Australia a misery with schemes for
restricting the growth of the new competitor.
The nation which urges any foreigner to come and
build a fortress right alongside its own capital
would be regarded as a loony institution ; and a
commercial ,city which urges an authority which
is mostly outside its control to come and build
another city as near as possible to its gate is, in a’
commercial sense, taking just the same sort of
chances. At present it is assumed, in a large,
off-hand way, that Sydney will live on the federal
city, but in the long procession of events the
position may be reversed —the federal pity may
live on Sydney,
THE ALLEGEDLY FREETRADE “S. M.
HERALD” CALLING OUT WILDLY
FOR PROTECTION.
The visit last week of the Minister for Customs and his
party to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation’s works in
the Wolg-an Valley served the good purpose of bringing
under the notice of Federal politicians a monumental
enterprise. ... Upwards of ±400,000 has been actually
expended upon development work, and at the present
moment about 1700 men are on the pay roll, which
accounts for a distribution in wages alone at the rate of
between ±lOO,OOO arid ±120,000 a year. “We have spent
the best part of half a million sterling,” the works
manager told his political visitors, “ and we are prepared
to spend the other half.” If the liberal spending of money
in the development of an industry is to be taken as an
earnest of bona fide intentions, the Commonwealth Oil
Corporation could not well have given any more satisfac-
tory assurances than it has done. To this State at least
its operations so far have been all gain, and if the industrial
expectations are realised, THE COMMONWEALTH AS A
WHOLE MUST BE A GAINER. This being so, it becomes
all the more remarkable that an industry of this extent and
character should have received such scant consideration
from Mr. Deakin and his all-wool Protectionist followers
when the tariff was undergoing revision. It was about
on a par with the treatment of the iron industry
of the same neighborhood, which would most assuredly
have been leftrto its fate had not the shameful inconsist-
ency of such a proceeding been forced upon the attention
of those who were so solicitous of the welfare of so many
trifling “industries” in the favored centres of Protec-
tionist influence. The refusal of even the Labor parti’ to
give this Commonwealth company some counter-weight
against the competition of two huge Trusts, one of which,
at least, represents certainly the most aggressive, if not
also the most powerful, financial combination of the
generation, is one of those eccentricities of politics which
become the more difficult of satisfactory explanation the
more they are looked into. If we are to acquiesce in the
Protectionist principle at all, we utterly fail to under-
stand why an industry which already gives such large
employment, and which gives fair promise of being able
to afford very much more, should be excluded from THE
BENEFITS OF A TARIFF while other industries of
no present or probable future importance receive the
cover of duties. In these circumstances, it is not at all
to be wondered at that the Commonwealth Oil Corpora-
tion should still be agitating for a duty on kerosene.
Along with Mr. Tudor, we quite see the risks of reopening
the fiscal question, even to remedy AN UNPARDONABLE
OVERSIGHT ; but, at the same time, it can hardly be
allowed that the last word has been said on this question.
—S. M. Herald leading article ( W/11’09 ).
* * * *
The S. M. He RALD is an alleged Freetrade
paper, and is proud of the fact. There is no fact
under Heaven of which it is prouder. Therefore
it is quite in the nature of things that it should
call out at the top of its voice for the “ benefits ”
of a Protective tariff for a N.S.W. indus-
try like that of the Commonwealth Oil Cor-
poration or the Lithgow iron works; in
Sydney the alleged Freetrade paper is always
shouting for Protection for N.S.W. industries.
Almost the first act of the Australian Parliament
was to grant, with the support of the N.S.W.
Freetrade members, large and enthusiastic Pro-
tection to the N.S.W. sugar industry (there is no
sugar industry in Victoria, Tasmania, orS.A.);
and almost its last act was to provide, with the
enthusiastic support of the N.S.W. Freetrade
members, for the taxing of Queensland, Victoria,
S.A., Tasmania and Westraliairi order to pay a
bonus in aid of the N.S.W. iron industry. The
Sydney alleged Freetrade papers cordially ap-
proved of these doings, yet at the same time they
denounced Protection as the visionary belief of
persons of poor intellect, and also as a deep con-
spiracy to benefit Victoria and S. A. at the expense
of the Ma State. The declaration that the benefits
of Protection have been conferred specially on the
industries of Victoria doesn’t hang together any
too well with the other declaration that Protection
isn’t a benefit, but a curse ; still, no one expects
consistency from the Freetrade press. It isn’t
built that way.
• * •* *
So it is quite natural to find the S. M. Herald
demanding the “benefits” of Protection for the
N.S.W. oil industry. In that respect The Bulle-
tin cordially agrees with the S. M. Herald. But
The Bulletin has a right to clamor for Protection
for N.S.W. oil; the Herald has no such right,
and, by its clamor, it proves itself a liar, a hypo-
crite, and a fool. The Bulletin says Protection is
an advantage, therefore it demands that N.S.W.
oil should have that advantage ; the S. M. Herald,
during all its long career of foolish and time-
serving stodge, has declared that Protection is a
curse, and when it demands that the blessing of
the alleged curse should be bestowed on the N.S.W.
oil trade, it brands itself as either a scoundrel or
an ass. The Bulletin has always demanded
Protection for the industries of every State of the
Commonwealth, N.S.W. included; the S. M.
Herald has always complained bitterly about
“robbery” when a Victorian or S.A. industry
received a measure of Protection; consequently the
Herald’s demand for Protection for a N.S.W. in-
dustry is a lopsided, narrow-minded, parish-souled
affair. The Bulletin insists on Protection for the
N.S.W. oil industry because it holds that Pro-
tection is good. The S. M. Herald has declared
for something like half a century that Protection
is bad and ruinous and disastrous, and that
industries get on far better without it; therefore,
when it claims Protection for N.S.W. oil
it is confronted by two alternatives —either
it has been lying most of its life when it
declared Protection to be injurious, or else
Protection is injurious, and the Herald knows
that it is so, and that paper deliberately recom-
mends Protection for a big N.S.W. industry in
order to injure, damage and impoverish its native
State. In the former case one naturally asks why
the old paper perjured itself all these years, and
the only possible assumption appears to be that it
clamored for Freetrade because, for the moment,
Freetrade is an English idea, and the Herald
would rather be dead than not be English. In the
latter case, one naturally asks whether some
foreign enemy has paid the Herald to promote
the damage of N.S.W., or whether the Herald is
doing it out of innate malice—the same emotion
which made Daniel Quilp leave all the pieces of
loose wood in the path of Sampson Brass, with
the nails pointing upwards, so that Sampson
Brass might come to grief thereon.
* * * *
There is no excuse to be found in the S. M.
Herald’s saving clause—“lf we are to acquiesce
in the Protectionist principle.” The sham Free-
trader who has realised, but won’t admit, the
utter futility of his joss, is fond of hiding himself
behind a feeble statement to the effect that he
doesn’t believe in Protection, and that he still
regards it as an evil thing, but if we are to have
the curse his particular industry should have a full
share in any curse that is going. That kind of
narrative doesn’t hold water ; it is hardly even
calculated to contain mud. If there is a shred of
truth in the tales which the S. M. Herald has
been disseminating for something like half a .cen-
tury, the fact that the mainly Victorian w.poheji
business is protected, and must consequently
(ac,cording fo the Herald) be going to ruin, is
in itself a yeason why the JN.S.W. oil industry
should not be protected, so that its vast prosperity
under Freetrade .conditions qiay vindicate .ttfe
Herald’s political doctrines, apd shine o,uf like a
good man in Sodom, or a good deed in an evil land,
or an oasis in a desert, or something like that. The
fact that the oil industry is a purely N.S.W.
concern, and that N.S.W. is the alleged Freetrade
State of the Commonwealth, and that the S. M.
Herald is the alleged representative of the alleged
Freetrade principles of N.S.W., are three extra
special reasons why the S. M. Herald, if it has a
shred of faith in its professed principles, should cry
aloud like Jeremiah for Freetrade in oil. The oil
business gives it a unique opportunity to prove
that it believes in its professed principles, and it
deliberately throws the opportunity away.
* » * *
The Herald makes a faint excuse for playing
the part of Gehazi, or any other traitor, with the
statement that 1700 men are dependent for their
wages on the N.S.W. oil industry. As an excuse
that remark seems about the poorest on record.
Certainly 1700 men are a large number, and Pro-
tectionlias been granted to industries which employ
only a tenth as many. But the fact that 1700 men
are a large number is all the more reason why the
Herald should demand the inestimable of
Freetrade for the oil industry (if the Herald
really believes its own assertion that Freetrade is
a blessing), for the spectacle of a great industry
flourishing under Freetrade is much more inspirit-
ing than the spectacle of a small one doing the
same thing, and the joy of making 1700 men in
the oil business rich and prosperous and happy
under Freetrade should be much more attractive
than the sight of the same happiness falling on a
mere 178 persons engaged in making scientific in-
struments. The larger the industry the more
reason, if the Herald believes in its alleged creed,
to demand that it should have unadulterated
Freetrade, so that the beautiful doctrine may
have a big stage, illuminated by plenty of
limelight, whereon to demonstrate its ad-
vantages. But as a mere commonplace matter
of figures the S. M. Herald’s implied theory
that the N.S.W. oil industry should enjoy the
so-called curse of Protection, instead of the pro-
fessed advantages of Cobden’s creed, because of
its great and remarkable size, is mere fool-
ishness. The N.S.W. oil industry is a
very big affair, but because it is concen-
trated in one place it looks much more over-
whelming than it is. As regards the number of its
employees, it is a mere fraction as compared with
the boot, or shirt, or tailoring, or dressmaking, or
tanning industries. It ranks about level with
soap and candles. It isn’t a patch on the stone
and glass, or wood, or agricultural implement
trade. It is less than one-twentieth of the
metal-working job. It doesn’t even approach
the butter, or biscuit, or pickles and sauce, or
confectionery, or flour trade, or a whole lot of
other trades, as a means of employment. Yet
when Protection for those other industries was
suggested the S. M. Herald had, and still has, a
curious habit of denouncing the idea as a dis-
reputable scheme to coddle a few feeble Vic-
torian jobs or trades at the public expense. There
is something pathetic about the Herald’s honest
indignation at the temporary failure to supply
Protection to the oil works which employ 1700
people in N.S.W., and its blank disgust at any
proposal to give Protection to (say) the plain old
boot industry, which employs nearly 14,000 people
scattered over all Australia. A boot duty is an
aid to all the other States, as well as to bf.S.W.,
and when it is a question of helping all the States
the S. M. Herald’s Freetrade sentiments are
very powerful. An oil duty would help N.S.W.
almost exclusively, and when it is a question of
helping N.S.W. exclusively, the S. M. Herald is
Protectionist to the backbone. In a faint sort of
way the allegedly Freetrade Herald excuses itself
for demanding that the exclusively N.S.W. oil
industry or iron industry should be blessed into a
state of prosperity by means of the curse of Pro-
tection, by saying that, though the oil industry
(or iron industry) belongs wholly to N.S.W., its
success will be a gain to “the Commonwealth as a
whole.” Unfortunately the same wretched, illogi-
cal and selfish old rag never realises that Protec-
tion for an industry like clothes or boots, in which
all the States have a share, will benefit “the
Commonwealth as a whole.” That view of “the
Commonwealth as a whole” only strikes it when
a purely N.S.W. trade is under consideration. In
other cases it denounces Protection as a scheme to
prop up “a few Melbourne factories.”
• * * «
Under the misfortunate guidance of papers like
the S. M. Herald N.S.W. has drifted into a
curious political backwash. It has become the
disturbing element and the disreputable anomaly
of the Commonwealth. In former days it was the
old Freetrade State which protected, directly or
indirectly, every important industry which it
possessed. It supports to this day a herd of
alleged Freetrade papers which declare that Pro-
tection is a curse, and also that there is a con-
spiracy to reserve that damage for Victoria and
S.A., and to prevent N.S.W. getting its proper
share of the injury. It elects a solid band of alleged
Freetrade Senators, and a considerable number of
alleged Freetrade Representatives, who denounce
Protection, and vote against it when it applies to
the industries of any other State, and vote for it
like one man when it applies to the industries
of their own State. It returns Bowden, in whose
electorate are the Commonwealth Oil Works—
Bowden, who was a staunch Freetrader till
he saw that his own electorate wanted Protection,
and who is still a Freetrader, except as regards
the big industry in his own electorate. It is re-
sponsible for Senator Walker, who holds that
N.S.W. should have special rights and privileges
and consideration in the matter of the Federal
capital, by reason of the alleged fact that it
gave up the Freetrade which it never possessed
for the sake of union ; and who thinks so little of
Freetrade that he voted, along with N.S.W.’s other
five alleged Freetrade Senators, to tax all Australia
for the benefit of the N.S.W. iron industry. All
these papers and politicians put N.S.W. in a
false position. In fact, N.S.W. seems almost due,
for the sake of its own self-respect, to get a per-
fectly new lot of papers and politicians.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A British Viewpoint.
The recently-expressed view of N.S.W. Actuary
Teece, that the old folks at ’Ome know little and
care less about Australian ideals and conditions,
was buttressed in striking fashion by a Reuter’s
message, which the dailies printed last Friday.
The message ran
Discussing the issues raised by the speeches at the
Northcote banquet, the Daily News this morning tenta-
tively suggests the admission of Chinese within certain
districts of tropical North Australia.


The Daily News is the leading Liberal organ in
the United Kingdom. It advocates Freetrade,
reels with horror whenever Lord Roberts’ uni-
versal-service proposals are mentioned in its
hearing, and is in other respects an enlight-
ened journal after British and foreign importer-
dom’s own heart. Yet either (l) it hasn’t
begun to grasp the vital urgency of the White
Australia doctrine in the eyes of Australians
living in Australia, or (2) it is wholly indifferent
on the matter. It considers that there is nothing
objectionable about the idea of a skewbald Com-
monwealth. So long as the sub-tropical seaboard
of Australia is peopled with Caucasians it can’t
see that there is any valid argument against the,
at present, almost empty Northern seaboard being
settled with Mongols. That frankly-expressed
opinion is significant in many ways. It is unques-
tionably the opinion of a considerable section
of Britons. The home-staying Briton finds
it impossible to understand the Australian’s
abhorrence of association with Asiatics. He
waves the prejudice impatiently aside, treat-
ing it either as a “colonial fad,” or as an
instance of Trades Union bigotry. In some
cases he delves deeper into the question, and then
it occasions him anger and alarm. He foresees
the likelihood of “ trouble in the East ” over the
Commonwealth’s, as it appears to him, senseless
policy of alien exclusion. He pictures, in his
mind’s eye, British battleships (his battleships)
engaging the vessels of China or Japan, or both,
in defence of a policy with which he has not the
remotest sympathy, and which he does not even
comprehend. He reflects bitterly that the very
people who set up this tremendous ideal of an all-
white continent are themselves taking no steps
whatever to preserve it, but are relying
wholly on him to do the difficult job for
them. And the reflection makes him a very
wild Briton indeed. R. Teece never spoke a
truer word than he did the other day when he told
the S. M. Herald and Telegraph reporters that
the British were “ as often as not hostile to the
colonies.” The convinced Freetrader, the reduc-
tion-of-armaments enthusiast, the Peace Society
Briton, the hugely numerous Nonconformist who
(across 12,000 miles of ocean) regards the Chow as
a man and a brother, and repeatedly (across 12,000
miles of ocean) strains his dreadful relation to his
breast, all find Australia’s legislative conduct
during recent years utterly revolting to their
convictions. The Daily News suggestion that
Australia should forthwith drop its nonsense
about shutting Chinese, etc., from its untenanted
wastes expresses their sentiments absolutely.
No country in the world’s history has ever fought
well for a cause which, to the majority of the in-
habitants, was either unjust or inexplicable. To
the majority of residents in the United Kingdom
the exclusion of the colored races from the
Northern parts of the Commonwealth is inexplic-
able. As Australia is now situated, it has no one
but Britain to fight for it if the Chow decides to
take the hint of the British newspapers and start
admitting himself to these parts. If the Daily
News’ nod on this subject isn’t as good as a
whole fusillade of winks to the local anti-
defenceites, they deserve all the trouble that
is coming to them in the near future.
And the fact that it is coming admits of no
doubt whatever. The Australian Parliament
hasn’t even cared yet to take over the Northern
Territory and make it legally and permanently a
part of the Commonwealth. It is still a British
Crown colony, administered on sufferance by S. A.,
and liable, if the Australian Parliament doesn’t
promptly abandon the job of throwing out Minis-
tries and devote a little time to looking after the
interests of Australia, to ,be resumed at any
moment by Britain and filled with Chinese and
Hindu settlers. Yet the already shut-up Parlia-
ment has just been further shut up for two
months, and is liable, when its opening becomes
due, to be shut up some more, while every hour
brings the danger nearer. To a nation which
fools away time and opportunity in that fashion
trouble always comes.
♦
The Advantage of “Getting There” Yourself.
One of the least cheerful features of the trouble at
Broken Hill is the dead-set made against the
police. Locally, in the alliterative language of
the moment, they are “the pimps of the plunder-
ing plutocrats.” Withoutashadowofdoubtastrong
case has been made out against their methods.
Men who have, or had, no sympathy with the
miners—who condemned them for not accepting
the offer made by the mine-owners to continue
Work on the understanding that the award of the
Court should be retrospective—have bubbled over
with indignation. Presbyterian parson Paterson,
a man whose buttered toast certainly doesn’t
come mainly from the miner section, says,
referring to the alleged riot—“ Throughout the
whole episode, there was one thing that struck
ihe, ana that was the deliberately organised
provocation extended by the police. . . The men,
in my opinion, have been wilfully, wickedly, and
wahtonly provoked.” John Murray, the senior
Baptist parson—a man who isn’t given to
hysterics—said, “It was a case of deliberate
provocation.” W. R. Nairn, who is, or was,
president of the local Chamber of Commerce,
declares it “an organised attempt at provocation.”
And so through a long catalogue. Under the
circumstances it isn’t surprising that the local
Labor leaders throw heavy chunks of alliterative
language at the police, while the miner’s daughter
in the cook-shop is violently engaged about some-
thing else when the hungry imported Constable
A 9653 calls for ham and eggs. That is the sort
of thing that is happening in N.S.W. Across
the border, in S. Australia, where a greater pro-
portion of the men at the Port Pirie works are
having exactly the same trouble with the co.,
there have been no ructions at all. Gamboni, the
miners’ president, returning from Port Pirie,
said:—
The good common sense of the S. Aus. Government,
which I have sometimes called the Shandygaff Govern-
ment, is strongly evidenced by the fact that it is showing
implicit confidence in the workers, and it is not abused.
There is no talk or suggestion of augmenting the local
police, the universal feeling in the town being that, de-
spite the lockout, there is no fear of disorder or riot. If
the same common sense had only been shown by the
Wade Government, we would have been much nearer an
amicable settlement than we are to-day.
There have been no bombs at Port Pirie, no
arrests, and only a very faint, and then promptly
repressed, outbreak of turbulence. From the
newspaper point of view the trouble at Port Pirie
isn’t worth six coppers ; thousands of people
don’t, in fact, know that Port Pirie is practically
an idle town. What, then, is the difference?
Simply this —while Wade is Premier of N. S.
Wales, there is, as Gamboni puts it, a “Shandy-
gaff” Government in office in S. Aus. The S.
Australian Labor party, in order to get the execu-
tive power, has not been above making alliances
with the sympathetic Radicals. Furthermore,
instead of screeching for “ Socialism in our time,”
and talking wildly about clanking chains and the
like, the South Australian Laborites have taken
up an intensely practical attitude. They
have thus got into their own ranks a
very large proportion of the farmers of
S. Aus.; and the Adelaide man who works with
his brain isn’t stared at when he says that he goes
with the Labor party. They are, in some of the
other States, held up to scorn as “Shandygaff ”
Laborites; but when there is trouble they are in
power, and the people who scorn them are not —
occasionally they are in prison. There always
will be some men who are ahead of the crowd,
and those men always, of course, will be a small
minority. But the Labor party doesn’t want to
be always that little crowd away in the front, and
away in the minority. It wants occasionally
to have a chance to do things itself, to
put its principles into practice, and to
prevent the other fellow putting his want
of principle into practice. For that reason
it doesn’t desire to reconsider its platform
every 12 months, and allow the few extreme men
in the front of the movement to nail on another
plank or two, which it will take another six or
eight years of hard battling to get even a fair pro-
portion of the public to accept, and which will
meantime keep the party in the minority, where
it can do nothing much, except get itself arrested
and made to appear in the wrong. It needn’t be
a stagnant party ; if it were it would soon die.
But there is a difference between being a stagnant
party and a party which insists upon always being
so far ahead of the crowd in the matter of theory
and “principles ” and “objectives” that it never
has a chance to score anything practical off its
own bat.
The Bogus Rainbow.
Some eminently true words from Victoria :
In Premier Murray’s promise of a graduated land-tax
for Victoria, which appears to guileless democrats as a
rainbow in the sky, I can see only the evidence of strange
political ignorance or ordinary Ministerial insincerity.
Why, even the unspeakable ex-Premier started his auto-
cratic Government with a similar promise, knowing it to
be impossible of fuliilment under existing conditions; and
though we may credit Murray with a real desire
to do what Bent never dreamed of doing, the
fact that the new promise is as worthless as
the old one suggests that it may be equally intended to
deceive. Nothing but further waste of time can result
from the introduction in the Vic. Legislative Assembly of
any such measure of land law reform as the State needs.
The Legislative Council bars the way in these days of
Murray not less strongly than it obstructed the efforts
of Berry more than 30 years ago. The existing abortive
land-tax in Victoria was the outcome of the long
struggle between Berry (backed by a tremendous
Assembly majority) and the Tories of the late
seventies of last century. Immediately the land
question was “disposed of,” the Berry Government
essayed the reform of the Council by taking from it the
old power of continuous veto. This vain struggle ex-
tended over several years, involved several general elec-
tions, and led to the historical “embassy ” to the British
Government. Three different Reform Bills were brought
in by Berry. The first two were unceremoniously re-
jected by the House of Fat. The third was passed, after
being so amended by the Tories in the Assembly that it
made the House of Fat more powerful than ever.
Before Premier Murray can expect his talk of a gradu-
ated land-tax to be taken seriously by students of the
State’s political history, he must proclaim vehemently
the facts of the situation, and call upon the people to
back him up with insurrectionary force in a plan to effect
a real radical reconstruction of the Upper House. Were
his Government as strongly democratic as Graham
Berry’s was in 1877, instead of the weak composite body
that it is, he could only carry a Land Bill as far as the solid
wall of the Fat Man’s domain. He cannot scale the wall
which stands between him and the accomplishment of a
new land law. He must break it down. Only with the
active, aggressive aid of the people can he do this
breakage. But the people will never be moved to action
until a Premier tells them in blunt terms that, under the
existing Constitution, he has no chance of “ bursting up
the big estates,” or “unlocking the lands,” or doing
aught that the lords of the earth would describe as
“ ruining the country.”
A pertinent question was fired at Watt, the Treasurer
in the new Ministry, at one of his re-election meetings
last week. He was asked what steps the new Ministers
would take to force their proposed Land Bill through the
Council, presuming that they carried it in the Assembly.
He replied that “ the usual constitutional plan of a dis-
solution would be adopted.” Which reply looked like a
lie on the face of it. But if it were not a lie,
what could be more absurd than the dissolution
of a new Assembly which had passed a Land
Bill because the undissolvable Council had rejected
it ? Here was a question which invited an explanation
of the Ministry’s inability to overcome the inevitable
opposition of the Council in a constitutional manner, yet
the disingenuous Mr. Watt gave the meeting to suppose
that an “ appeal to the country,” resulting in the return
of the Ministry with an increased majority and a renewed
“ mandate from the People,” would, in some vague con-
stitutional manner, force the same old Council to pass
the Bill it had rejected.
Supposing, for the sake of argument, that the present
Victorian Legislative Assembly were a body of unselfish
patriots, prepared to stand the racket of a general election
three times a year for the next five years, their goings-
out and comings-back wouldn’t matter a row of pins to
the Councillors who read the reports of their proceedings
in the Argus. As long as the present Constitution exists
no satisfactory reform of the land laws can be accom-
plished by constitutional means. Premier Murray is a
wild optimist if he doesn’t realise the truth, or an un-
blushing bunkumist if he does realise it. Seemingly
Murray’s land-taxation pretences are fraudulent. Trea-
surer Watt’s dishonest reply to the question aforesaid
indicates a settled Government policy of fooling the
public. More significant even than Watt’s evasion of the
all-important point was the fact that neither the Argus
nor the Age reported the question and answer.
The Age —as the recognised opponent of the organ of
the Fat Man —should at least have published the
Treasurer’s statement of what the Ministry would do to
“ force ” the Council to subjection. The question of how to
deal with the House of Fat Landlords is the one pre-
eminently great question in Victorian politics, and the
one from which Parliament and Press—joined in a
damnable conspiracy of silence —are endeavoring to dis-
tract public attention.

Tlie Hard Sayings of John Darling.
John Darling, wheat-buyer, chairman of the
Broken Hill Proprietary Mine, and fat man
generally, seems to have a gift for saying
things that rankle. After the present trouble
started he announced that, in his opinion,
7s. 6d. a day was a full and sufficient
wage for a miner at Broken Hill; and he rubbed
the dreary statement in by adding that if the
miners drank and gambled less they could live all
right on it. John himself, of course, doesn’t live
at Broken Hill. His home is at Adelaide, in
sight of the sea. But he knows Broken Hill well
enough to be fully aware of the fact that it is
easily the most miserable town of any size in Aus-
tralia in which to live. It is very hot, dry, water-
less, and dusty, and there is nothing picturesque
or pleasing about it. And, on top of this, there
are the fumes of the silver-lead mines, poisoning
the air day and night. Underground, of course,
things are much worse; and the miner, in
addition to the ordinary discomforts of a dusty,
treeless existence, runs the risk of getting
* ‘ leaded ” or poisoned by gas from the
fires that smoulder among the timber.
As all food and other necessaries have
to be dragged up from Adelaide, living is
dearer than usual—considerably dearer than it is
where John Darling lives himself. Railway
charges are high, for you can only reach or get away
from Broken Hill per medium of a Private Enter-
prise railway ; and water is costly because Private
Enterprise supplies the water. So that, which
ever way you look at it, the fat exporter’s wage
suggestion is an amazing slab of cruelty and
ignorance and coarse brutality. As for the
men doing without liquor, this paper doesn’t
know if Darling is a teetotaler himself.
Probably he isn’t; and, anyway, nearly all men
of his class have well-stocked cellars. At a meet-
ing where Darling’s heartless and ridiculous
wage-suggestion was criticised, one of the speakers
said that, some time ago, the same Darling had
declared that there should be a distinctive dress
for the working class. Up to date, John has not
denied this, and it is just the sort of thing he
would say. For John, the wheat man, is one of
those typical supporters of Anti-Sosh who really
believe that working men are not exactly human
beings. They have also gradually acquired the
notion that it is the rich dealer, trader, and
middleman who makes the work and keeps things
going generally. Some of them (like Darling)
fancy that if there were no rich middlemen the
world would stop revolving, and everything
would become Chaos and Old Scratch, The
amazing contempt of the useless parasite for the
real producer is an interesting circumstance at all
times.
Comic Opera in Prison.
Victoria has an Indeterminate Sentences Act, a
piece of legislation about which this paper has
mixed hopes and doubts—an Act which may be
all right, but which certainly won’t be all right
unless it is well administered. And its adminis-
tration, so far, is a trenchant essay on the stupidity
and laziness of the average Tory Government,
as well as upon the folly of democrats, like the
Labor party, in standing aloof, and so allowing the
Tories to administer legislation, and especially
democratic legislation. Bent, having found it
necessary to do something, passed the Act. Then
he sat down and slept. He provided for six months
in which to get matters ready ; and, assuming that
matters would be ready, various Judges ordered a
few prisoners into indefinite retirement after the
expiration of definite terms. That didn’t neces-
sarily hurry Bent, for these prisoners had to work
out their definite sentences in the ordinary gaols,
and by the time they were ready to be removed to
the special gaol set apart for prisoners doing inde-
terminate sentences, Bent hoped to have that
special gaol ready for them. Still he recognised
that he couldn’t slumber for ever, so he appointed
a Board of three persons. Just then other Judges
happened across three young men who, they
thought, needed no drastic punishment, but
would be the better of detention till they had
made up their minds to behave themselves. So
the Judges ordered them to be reformed inde-
finitely, as provided by the Act. Bent then had
to find the special accommodation at once, so he
hastily proclaimed Castlemaine gaol a “ reforma-
tory.” The three youths were accordingly sent
to Castlemaine, whither also three others have
since gone. The six had a 70-cell gaol to them-
selves, with two warders and a governor. One of
the three youths cooked for the others; another
was storeman, and the third cleaned up the corridor
and carried round the tucker to himself and the
other two and the second three. Possibly these
latter three did some useful, productive work ; but,
if so, there is no evidence on the point. They were
there indeterminately, and, being there, every-
body seems to have forgotten all about them.
Just here the story becomes somewhat dim and
jerky ; but in some way the first three, whose ages
were 26, 20, and 10, learned that Bent was Broke,
that Murray was boss, and that Parliament was
out of session. Apparently they had a suspicion
that the Indeterminate Sentences Board was sus-
pended or had fallen along with Adolphus ; so
they decided to go out and see, and on Monday
morning, January 18, there were only three con-
finees in Castlemaine Gaol where there should
have been six. Investigation showed that the
three cell doors were open and the locks unin-
jured, thatthe three interesting youths had entered
the store-room (per key, of course), secured their
civilian clothes, taken the lever from the gallows
and prized open the door into the yard, and then
passed placidly through the governor’s house into
the open air and freedom. When Inspector-
General O’Connor came along and exonerated the
officials, everybody felt willing to let the matter
drop and proceed just as though nothing had
happened. But, next day, the youngest escaper,
having returned to his home in Melbourne, lost
heart and gave himself up; and that incon-
siderate proceeding necessitates a reconsideration
of the whole subject. The trouble is that it is no
use making sensible laws unless you administer
them sensibly. It is no use putting a man in gaol
indefinitely and letting him rip ; neither is it any
use putting a lad of 19, who threatens to take the
criminal path, to scrubbing gaol corridors or
cooking meals for himself and a few other
youths, under his own supervision. If the
Indeterminate Sentences Act is to be of any
value, especially as applied to youthful culprits,
they must be kept steadily employed, under com-
petent supervision, at interesting, useful work;
if possible at some trade that they can follow so
soon as regular, industrious habits and a sense of
self-control and responsibility justify their dis-
charge from such supervision. The Victorian
fashion of administering the I.S. Act is merely a
cheap modification of the same State’s penal
system —the system which, to a large extent, keeps
prisoners toiling gently for about six hours daily
at monotonous tasks which are of no value to the
man who performs them and very little to any-
body else.

A bitter letter from a man who says he has a
relative in the business :
Just when a truck-weary N.S.W. was inclined to ease
off the subject for a while, until it saw what Commis-
sioner Johnson’s testament that “ stock-trucks are being
constructed as fast as possible” was worth, it got another
shock. It discovered that Johnson hadn’t enough chaff-
trucks either. Chaff, it seems, has been a rather scarce
article in Sydney lately. Large quantities of the edible
have been brought by sea at stiff prices from Victoria and
S.A.; and a lot of innocent people had a hazy notion that
the shortage was due to “ the drought in many parts of
the country, you know.” Few people—outside the
“ trade ” anyway, and the “trade’’has been amazingly
patient on the subject—seemed to know that there was
chaff galore in N.S. W., and that hundreds of tons of the
stuff were getting mildewy and musty at country stations
and sidings because Johnson’s railways couldn’t bring it
to market. And while the simple chaff-consumer was
buying dear chaff and waiting reverently for the drought
to break, “ Sussex-street" was tearing its dusty hair over
correspondence like this
“ West Maitland,
January 14.
One truck of chaff arrived yesterday, and we have been
put to very serious trouble, as we were trusting to these
trucks coming forward promptly after the Christmas holi-
days to keep us going. We have been right out of chaff,
and have had to curtail orders. ... If we are ever so
placed again we will reluctantly go eisew '..ere for chaff
supplies.”
Then another wail
“ Coolamon.
We are doing our best. There are only three trucks
here, so you see there is no hope to do anything better,
unless you can help us by stirring the Commissioners or
somebody else up. The yards are in a disgraceful condi-
tion—chaff everywhere—and if we get any rain there will
be some pretty severe losses through this treatment.”
Also an additional sob :
“Ganmain.
“ We have not been able to procure any trucks yester-
day or to-day, and have had to stack the chaff on the
bank of the railway yard.”
And a prayer, by telegraph, from the same place :
“No trucks again to-day. Can you do anything your
end ? ”
It’s a fair thing, however, to admit that Johnson’s rail-
ways are apparently able to transport some chaff. For
instance, it is alleged on fair authority that recently they
took two truck-loads from Coolamon to West Maitland in
ten days ; and that at another time they carried a load
all the way from Boggabri to Brewarrina in a fortnight.
So perhaps, after all, this carping at Johnson’s infrequent
truck is mere captiousness, and ought to stop.
The Need for Ships.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Australia’s fleet consists of a few obsolescent gunboats
and one fifty-year-old battleship.— Disturbing fact.
Themistocles proposed that, instead of dividing
amongst themselves the revenues derived from the silver
mines at Laurium, they should use that fund for the con-
struction of ships of war. With the fleet thus obtained,
Greece was saved at the battle of Salamis. — Plutarch,
abridged.
Broken Hill, one of the richest mineral-producing cities
in the Commonwealth, has its biggest mine closed down.
—News item.
Athens in the long ago —ere the Asiatic foe
Laid the Spartan legion low—drifted thus ;
Wasted time in revelry, launched no ships upon
the sea—
Drowsed along quite carelessly—
Same as us !
From her mines at Laurium, ere the Persian beat
his drum,
Lo, she raised a mighty sum every year ;
But that foolish land afar threw its coin across
the bar,
Bought with it the brown cigar,
Likewise beer !
But Themistocles, the wise, gazed with grim,
prophetic eyes—
Whilst the crowd swapped jokes and lies ; saw
the need ;
Fought the ancient Tory crew—fool Athenian
leaders who
Saw no need for measures new—
(Cook and Reid)
And he beat them, so it seems —bright to-day his
action gleams—
Built one hundred big triremes speedily ;
Aristides and his gang grieved to hear his ham-
mers clang—
Yea, they felt the Tory pang
Inwardly !
Came King Xerxes, hight the Proud, with his
monstrous fighting crowd—
Blared his trumpets long and loud as they came;
On that ancient land at last burst the Asiatic
blast,
And the Tories stood aghast
At the same !
With twelve hundred fighting ships came the
Persian —’neath his whips
Marched the millions—in eclipse sank the star
(So opined the Tory crew) of the land that Homer
knew—
Land of heroes brave and true
In times afar.
Some observed, “’Tis best to run—Greece, it
seems, is clearly done.”
But their leader bade them shun such a crime ;
“ Here be ships wherewith to fight—grasp your
swords,” said he, “and smite ;
Let us keep our country White —
This land sublime !
“ Brave Leonidas is dead—yea, Thermopylae
runs red
With the blood his heroes shed for this land ;
Athens burns—our city dear; but our fighting
ships are here,
Greece is safe —ye need not fear,
Let us stand ! ’’
Blaring loud did echoes come—echoes of the
Persian drum ;
Crouched the Tories pale and numb on the shore ;
But the men who manned the fleet raised no wail
of dread defeat —
Resolute each seaman beat
With his oar !
Where the Isle of Salamis lifts, the lips of Greece
to kiss,
Lo, they made their galleys hiss through the
swell;
Xerxes proud, upon his throne, thought the
victory his own;
Soon he raised a bitter groan,
Then a yell!
For behold ! with iron beaks drave the warships
of the Greeks —
The Athenian proudly speaks of that day ;
Shining yet across the years see their swords,
their shields and spears,
Hear the ringing Grecian cheers
Far away !
Turned the Persian ships and fled —in the sea
their floating dead
Dyed the blue Aegean red with their blood ;
Xerxes proud in anguish rose, quit his large, all-
conquering pose,
For his name, as history shows,
Was Plain Mud !
He who came two millions strong tore with
whirlwind speed along—
Came no glad, triumphant song from his lips ;
Thus Themistocles the grim, in those days long
dead and dim,
Spoilt the Asiatic hymn
With his ships !
Heed ye then this tale of Greece. These be days
of seeming peace,
But across the centuries sounds a cry ;
And Themistocles I hear : “ Build Your Ships!”
—his voice comes clear;
“ Train your men to fight and steer,
Lest ye die !
“ Towns may fall and cities burn, still your foe-
man ye may spurn—
Athens’ glory did return; her eclipse
Lasted only for an hour, soon she rose in pride
and power;
To the Monkey would ye cower ?
Build Your Ships!
“ Build your beaked ships of steel, lest one day
ye beaten reel—
Heavy falls the victor’s heel on Defeat;
I, the Greek, who saved my land, give to you this
grim Command —
Lest ye fall ’neath Asia’s hand,
Build Your Fleet ! ”

To the least observant citizen it must be
obvious—even without the inspiring influence of
D.O.L. Whisky—that Australia's great need, if
for defence purposes only, is a large and im-
mediate increase of population. But the stimu-
lating influence of D.C.L. seems much needed to
hasten the land law reforms necessary to support
a large increase in population. D.C.L. is the
chief defence against the neglect of defence.*
Transferred Properties and State Frights.
At last the State and Federal authorities have
agreed as to the value of the State properties
Handed over to the Commonwealth, and now the
question of payment will have to be wrestled
with. Of course payment, except in so far as it
is required to equalise things, is a mere matter of
* orn ‘- That is to say, if States Nos. 1 to 3 have
handed over to the Commonwealth properties
worth £5 per inhabitant, and States Nos. 4 to 6
“ ave handed over properties worth £5 10s. per
inhabitant, it is obvious that States 4 to 6 should
be paid sufficient to compensate them for the
extra 10s. worth of property per inhabitant that
they have contributed to the common stock. But
the payment of the whole value in cash would be
r>,i S n absurdity. If N.S.W. transferred
£4,000,000 worth of property to the Com-
monwealth, and the Commonwealth taxed the
-iN.S. W. people in their Federal capacity to
the extent of £4,000,000 in order that it
might hand back the same money to the same
people in their State capacity as payment for the
property which they used to own in their State
capacity, but which they now own in their Federal
capacity, the proceeding would be the jest of the
century. Also it would involve great expense in
collecting the money. Still, there are State
1 right persons who can’t, or won’t, see that the
transaction would be simply a useless shifting of
money from the right-hand pocket to the left, and
there are reasons why the Commonwealth should
come down to the mental level of these foolish
an d shift the money from one pocket to the
°ther. Any cash payment is, of course, out
of the question; the operation of raising about
£10,000,000 by extra Federal taxation on the
people of the six States and then handing it over to
the State Governments to spend in riot is beyond
consideration. But the Commonwealth can
easily take over sufficient of the State debts to
represent the amount it nominally owes to
the States ; it is merely a matter of announcing
in London that the Australian Government is
prepared to issue its own 3or per cent, stock
in exchange for £3,674,048 worth of N.S.W. stock,
£384,751 of Tasmania stock, and so on, and in-
viting tenders from holders willing to exchange.
This would leave the Commonwealth with a debt
of about £10,000,000, which, it is to be hoped,
would carry a sinking fund to provide for the
earliest possible repayment. Later on, probably,
the State Fright crowd, which insists on a formal
act of payment, would repent and tear its hair,
but that is a mere detail. Said crowd would
realise (1) that the payment only signified that
the people of N.S.W. owed £3,670,000 or so in a
Federal sense instead of owing the same amount
in a State sense; (2) that the transfer of this small
part of the State debt had put new life into the
movement for taking over all the State
debts: and (3) that file Commonwealth’s
need to find between £300,000 and £400,000
more per annum for interest and sinking
fund had driven it with a rush to the Federal
graduated land-tax which might otherwise have
been postponed for some years yet. But the
wrath of the State Fright person at the results of
his demand for a specific act of payment would be
rather interesting than otherwise. The State
Fright person is always tearing his hair over
something.
Mahon, the Apologist.
The humility, not to say abjectness, of Federal
Minister Hugh Mahon to N.S.W. State
Premier Wade, in the course of last week’s
fish function at Manly, left a bad taste in the
mouth. There was a good deal of it, but these
few samples from the daily paper report show the
general tendency of the painfully apologetic
Minister
He could say that during the time Mr. Wade had been
in office he had shown a great desire to work
harmoniously with the Federal Government, and he (Mr.
Mahon) was pleased to be able to acknowledge that there
had been a distinct change in what he might
call the diplomatic relations between New South
Wales and the Federal Government since Mr.
Wade had been in power. (Applause.) That was a
consummation not only to be desired, but one that
should be welcomed by the people of Australia. What-
ever some people might say or think, the Federation
could not afford to ignore the opinion ot a State that had
37 per cent, of the population of the whole of the Com-
monwealth. There would have been no Federation at all
had it not been for New South Wales originally. (Hear,
hear.) He was glad big States like New South Wales and
Victoria were show'ing a disposition to recognise the new
national Government, and to work in harmony with those
who had charge of national affairs. ... What he wished
to emphasise was his main contention—that there was a
very strong and overwhelming reason why State and
Federal politicians should work harmoniously together.
(Applause.) °
That sort of thing may be a profitable pandering
to the State Frights vote, but it is mighty poor
Australian sentiment. Things certainly have
been smoother between the Australian and
N.S.W. State Governments of late —for the
simple reason that the feeble Fisher Ministry
abandoned its convictions as to what should be
done in the best interests of Australia, and voted
as one man to put the capital where Wade de-
manded. Further it seems to have decided to for-
get, as far as possible, any needless violence done
by Wade s policemen on the locked-out miners at
Broken Hill. As regards the assurance that the
Federation can t afford to ignore the opinion of a
State which contains 37 per cent, of the Common-
wealth s population—that is absolutely true., But
the opinion of N.S.W. in Federal matters is ex-
pressed by its 27 Representatives and its six
Senators, and it is to them that any remarks
about the feeling of N.S.W. on Federal matters
should be addressed. Wade isn’tone of N.S.W.’s
members—not even the least of them.
N.S.W. hires him to look after small State jobs
only, but he has the ineffable cheek to assume
an attitude which _ almost amounts to appoint-
ing himself and his Ministry and his party as
F ederal Ministers and members, and he and his
party have interfered so outrageously and illegally
m purely Federal affairs that at last N.S.W. was
fined £5 in the law courts like a common drunk
over the Carruthers-Wade wire-netting steal.
Wade is oven now striking large attitudes
about the area he will or will not allow Australia
to have for a capital site; about the access to
the sea that he may or may not permit; in short,
he is still posing as an important Federal
authority, which he isn’t. Mahon’s humble and
pathetic, not to say abject, desire to be “har-
monious which in Wade’s case can only be
done by sacrificing the Federal rights of the Aus-
tralian people in order to placate Gregory W.
anc the Sydney Tory papers which support him—
isn t the pose of a strong man. It is rather the
attitude of a streak of wet blotting paper.

Sydney Telegraph, discussing (6/l/’O9) the trouble
between Germany and the United Kingdom over
the latter s highly protective new Patents Act,
makes this (for a Freetrade paper) extraordinary
admission:—
As a matter of fact the result of the Act has been to in-
duce several European manufacturers to start branch
works in England, and therefore to tend to cheapen the
commodity by eliminating the cost of transit.
So the forcible dragging, by means of protective
legislation, of industries to a country is not the
extravagant foolishness the Telegraph used to
think it was, after all. It doesn’t hit the con-
sumer violently in the pocket. It doesn’t chip
half-crowns off every sovereign that he earns. On
the contrary, it actually saves the consumer
money. Ihe admission amounts to a voluntary
abandonment by the Telegraph of one of the few
likely-looking weapons in its fiscal armory.
“ Grand Slam ” writes :
Recent proceedings under N.S.W. Gaming and Liquor
Acts show how the N.S.W. police and the Law Depart-
ment can be depended upon to pervert an Act passed
in all good faith into a measure of oppression. The mea-
sures in question were passed to stop gambling and some
obvious bad practices in the liquor business, etc., but
Parliament surely did not mean to countenance proceed-
ings such as took place at Goulburn lately, when a pub-
lican and three friends were prosecuted for playing
euchre for drinks on Saturday, December 21, at the
former’s hotel. Mr. Publichouse was find £3 for allowing
“ gaming ” on his licensed premises, while the other three
escaped because the P. M. decided that they weren’t gaming
but playing a game of skill. The publican was fined before
this definition was given, otherwise he must have escaped
too. As the case now stands, four men were playing
the same game, and one of them was fined ‘ for
allowing the others to do what the law says they
weren’t doing at all. The Law is appealing to a
higher authority to decide the difficulty, and the case
will probably be dragged, at great expense, through
many courts, for as a protracted dragger of cases Gre-
gory Wadb has no equal. All this is'to decide whether or
not people can play cards for drinks at a pub. Now, I
belong to a cheap club in the city. At the club is a
nightly poker school. Does the Crown Law Office shud-
der because any night jmung Jones, of the Grand
National Bank, may, with three twos in his
hand, open a jack pot containing £3 or more?
Over at the Union Club old White Waistcoat, on his way
home from a vestry meeting, will take a hand at bridge
for 10s. a hundred, and £1 on the rubber. Policeman X 5
is on the beat taking care that the seedy-looking partv
opposite won’t get a chance to ask old W. Waistcoat for
6d. when he comes out. W. Waistcoat has probably
doubled no trumps up to the highest limit allowed
by the rules, yet does Policeman X 5 trouble his
head about “gaming on the premises”? Not he.
And why, I ask, can old White Waistcoat play the secre-
tary of the Union Club (if he chooses) ecartb for drinks
on the licensed premises of the Union Club while Billjim
and the publican aren’t allowed to play euchre for a
threepenny beer without the machinery of the Law start-
ing to walk over them with all its innumerable hoof ?
+
The law is a fearful and wonderful thing. The
other day the Broken Hill unions decided that
they would try Justice Higgins with a motion
against the B. H. Prop. Co. for doing something
in the nature of a lockout,” and one lawyer
went from Broken Hill and another from Sydney
to argue the matter. Justice Higgins at once
quoted the section prohibiting “any person or
organisation” doing “anything in the nature
of a lockout,” “on account of an industrial
dispute.” “Where is the industrial dis-
pute?” asked his Honor. “The lockout
must be ‘on account of an industrial dispute.’”
The lawyers pointed out that the co. said that
(say) 10s. was a fair wage, while the unions said it
ought to be 11s. ; and if that wasn’t an industrial
dispute, what was?' Then the Judge remarked that
what happened was that the mine put up a notice
that it was going to close down for a fortnight, but
that if anybody wanted work at the end of the
fortnight he could get it at less wages; and he
wasn’t sure that that was either an industrial
dispute or a lockout. Still he would let the parties
come along and argue the point if they wanted
to, though naturally under the circumstances the
unions decided that it wasn’t worth while. This
matter raises the question whether there ever is
such a thing as a strike or a lockout. Men never
strike, probably—they simply say that the wages
don t suit them, so they’ll take a spell to-morrow ;
and employers don’t have a lockout—they simply
say that they’ll shut the works down to-night,
and if anybody wants a job in the morning
he can have it at lower wages. In NT. S.
Wales—even under the Industrial Disputes Act—
things seem to be different; anyway, Justice
Cohen, when he was President of the Arbitration
Court, laid it down that it was “ something in the
nature of a lockout” when an employer said,
“You must accept a reduction on existing condi-
tions or else give up your work.” Of course, in
the Broken Hill case there may be other points—
as, for instance, whether the men didn’t put
themselves out of court when they were offered
and refused work at whatever wages the Arbitra-
tion Court might subsequently lay down. But
that is apart from the other question—“ When is
a lockout not a lockout ? ” Or, almost, in fact, is
a lockout ever a lockout in the cold eye of the
law?
♦
The action of the Sydney Labor Council in
assuming to itself, by 51 votes against 50, the power
to order a general strike whether individual
unions consent or not, looked very fine and large
at the moment, but when regarded later on in
cold blood it seemed very wild and wholly
ridiculous. A real general strike would hang up all
the means of transport, and would stop the work of
unionist bakers and butchers, and thus leave good
unionists dependent on “blacklegs” for their
bread and beef and sundries. That would be
distinctly awkward, yet it would be only one item
among many. The rich man would still be able
to drive wherever he wanted to go; the poorer one,
with railways and tramways tied up, would have
to walk incredible distances. Then a general
strike would necessarily include the Typographical
Union. Therefore it would shut up the offices of
the weekly Labor paper and the proposed new
Labor daily. Now a paper has to come out in
some shape or form in order to preserve its copy-
right. The Tory papers would struggle out in
some abbreviated condition, and full of curses
directed against the strikers and bogus tales of
outrage charged against them ; they would have
no scruples about the employment of blackleg
labor. But the Labor paper couldn’t employ
blackleg labor, therefore if a general strike were
ordered it wouldn’t come out, its valuable copy-
right would be lost, and the workers would have
silenced their own organ just when it was most
needed. The general strike is a very large and
imposing theory, but some large ideas are like
George Reid’s waistcoat region—more bulky than
useful.

N.S.W. State Premier Wade has had a heap of
explaining to do re the 12 months’ leave of ab-
sence on full pay given to Chief Justice Darley,
who, it is well known, is never coming back ; and
re the appointment of Darley’s learned brother,
Simpson, as Acting-Chief Justice for a year.
Wade says that there is precedent for giving the
C. J. a year’s leave, with full salary and full use
of the title, before he drops out, but the precedent
is hard to find. Chief Justice Alfred Stephen
resigned straight out, with no leave of absence,
and at once commenced to draw his pension. His
successor, Martin, died in harness, and so he had
no special leave. Then came the very temporary
Salomons, who lasted a week, and Salomons had
sufficient of the Jewish sense of humor not to ask
for a year’s leave when he gave up his week-old
job. So far as Chief Justices are concerned the
precedent that Wade is looking for is very scarce
in N.S.W. Justice Windeyer isn’t a case in
point. He had six months’ leave, and at
the end of that time he applied for another
six months. Then Premier Reid angrily
projected his stomach into the controversy
with a firm refusal, and Windeyer resigned.
So, as far as precedents go, it seems that Mr.
Harley should have done a definite resignation,
and his successor should have been appointed im-
mediately, instead of the matter being hung up
far a year. One theory is that Premier Wade
wants 12 months in which to make up his mind
whether he will take the billet or not. Another
is that he has already made up his mind, but wants
to give the public time to accustom itself to the
idea of Wade as Chief Justice. A third proposi-
tion is that he has made up his mind, and doesn’t
care twopence about the public, but that he wants
to use the interval in brushing up his law on the
subject qf stolen wire-netting.
“ Starboard ” writes :
N.S.W. Marine Court has given its decision re the col-
lision of the Dunmore and the Encounter’s pinnace,
which resulted in the drowning of 15 bluejackets ; and, as
in every other case of recent date, has blamed both sides.
The Buningyong-Criffel collision, the Mintaro-Wairuna,
Suva-Hero, and Colac-Pareora smashes—in all these im-
portant collision cases recently decided the result was
that the Marine Court impartially blamed everyone con-
cerned, probably in the hope that by blaming everyone it
would manage to blame the right person amid the general
rush. In the civil cases which arose out of these
decisions the blame has been given to one side only.
And it is certain that if another Court were to hear
the Dunmore case its verdict would blame the only
party liable for the accident. And that party is the
naval launch. It is a commonplace matter of knowledge
among merchant sailors that on Sydney harbor the naval
pinnaces are a rule of the road unto themselves. The
coxswain of the launch almost blurted out as much in his
evidence, though his lawyer cleverly tried to cover his
tracks.
Look at the facts. The launch was a crossing ship (not
denied). The launch tried to cross in front of the Dun-
more (not denied). The rules plainly lay down that a
vessel having another on its starboard hand must give
way (not denied). The luckless pinnace has a gaping
hole on its starboard side (too plain to be denied). Evi-
dently, then, the naval launch threw the rules to the
winds, and the Marine Court found it so, and gave judg-
ment accordingly.
Then why drag in the unfortunate Dunmore? It
seemed from the first that the Court, with some idea of
softening the blow to the naval authorities—for the
guilt of the navy launch was obvious from the 'commence-
ment —was anxious to find contributory negligence on the
steamer’s part. And the point the Court hit on was that
the master of the Dunmore did not keep a proper look
out. The evidence showed that the master of the Dun-
more saw the launch as soon as it was possible to see it,
but never dreamed it was mad enough to cross his bows
with a pinnace towing behind. Secondly, his mate was
stationed by the master on the forecastle head. It was
his business to look out, and he, in fact, saw the launch
and warned the master of its approach. The accident
occurred on a fine, calm morning, and should, of course,
not have happened. How the master of the Dunmore
should have avoided it the Court apparently couldn’t say.
The way he was dragged into the matter doesn’t cause
the seafaring community to have much respect for the
N.S.W. Marine Court. It holds the very existence of
master mariners in the hollow of its hand ; and most of
those who have to appear before it have an impression
that they are not going to get a fair deal. This last de-
cision will increase the impression.

“The Broken Home ” continues at Sydney
Palace with the assistance of Harry Diver as the
hero, vice Jefferson Taite, ill. The author of the
poetrj' which brightens the synopsis of scenery
has not yet transpired, but his work continues to
interest. Consider it
Act II. —Scene 3.. .. The Heart of a Metropolis.
There is no wife left to cheer
In the trouble to be near.
What was Paradise—is now
A BROKEN HOME.
And this is an example of pathos in capitals •

A Millionaire’s Mansion. Gathered Fragments.
He mourns for her in silence
With shame his heart has burned
Why did she leave her loved ones
Is his cry.
Oh, why do women falter
And lose all self-respect
For vows made at the altar
And make their lives a wreck.
As a matter of fact, she didn’t lose any sell
respect at all.
Act IV. —Scene 3. .. .. The Old Home Again
Broken Lives Re-united.
For baby’s sake he’d forgive all
If she’d come back again.
Of course she came back in this act; and every
body lived happily till Act I. on the following
evening, when she fled again. The persistent
tragedy will happen nightly for some time yet.

“The Duchess of Dantzic,” at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney), got a reviver this week, when
the beauteous Andrew Higginson had sufficiently
nursed his damaged foot to take up the part of
Adhemar, the young man who breaks his sword
and throws the pieces adjacent to Napoleon’s corn.
D. B. O’Connor, who has been playing the part
very well indeed, putting a muffle on some of his
piercing notes, goes back to the single part of
Captain Regnier, the gentleman of the National
Guard who can go out and play skittles, if he
wants to, every evening after 9 o’clock.
On Saturday evening next Sydney’s ‘ ‘ Won-
derland City ” is to be given up to the promoters
of the Encounter Memorial Fund. Every shilling
taken at the gate and every sixpence garnered by
the various side shows will accrue to the widows,
orphans and indigent relatives of the tars who
died untimely three weeks ago. There will be a
huge Naval Display, a Vaudeville and Bioscope
show, and half a hundred other attractions. The
Bulletin strongly urges every citizen who hath
music and sympathy in his soul to abandon all
other stratagems on the 30th of this month, and
trek, family in tow, for Bondi.

Julius, the incomparable (almost we had
written the incroyable), continues to demonstrate
nightly that “The Breed of the Treshams” is
not the atavistic stock the majority of the mimes
at Sydney Royal strive so persistently to repre-
sent it. The onslaught of an entire army still
fails to reveal any sign of the yellow streak in
Reresby. This so-called degenerate is as tender
and considerate as a Parliamentary candidate on
polling-day. His skill with the broadsword is
like unto that of brother Johnson with the 4oz.
“mitt.” Eor all his alleged blackness of heart
“The Rat” is a truly magnificent vindication of the
moral qualities of the Tresham family. Would
that several shiploads of him were heading this
way to people and defend Australia’s Empty
North !

Man desists not from facing Man at Sydney
Criterion these nights ; and bi-weekly he does it
at matinbes. He performs the act in all known
sartorial styles, from frock coat to convict suiting;
in all varieties of face-expression, from the lugubri-
ous to the triumphant; in every tone of voice in
the human register, from a persuasive whisper to
an infuriated howl; and in all conceivable locali-
ties, from the Village Kirk to Portland Prison.
“Man to Man ” will rage wildly for another ten
days, and then the management intends to give
Sydney what The Bulletin can at present only
adumbrate darkly in the words “A rousing
surprise.”

Sydney Tivoli has nothing new this week
except a Baby. (The Stork seems to have
gone in for the theatrical agent business of recent
years.) The new Baby’s name is Jackson, and it’s
a girl ; also it skates beautifully. The rest of the
bill is the same old handspring and double somer-
sault document of last week. Besides Lawson
and Namon, Amalia and Leonora and Cristofolo,
there are Goodfellow and Gregson, Mackinnon’s
Scottish Meisters, Charles Faning and Tom
Dawson. The time is now ripe for some new
turns, or revolutions, or something. Possibly
T. Mann might be induced to turn for a brief
season ; he doesn’t appear to revolushe with much
success.

Adelaide amusements have narrowed down
to the mostly-picture Olympia and Pavilion, the
open-air Continental Gardens, and the Tivoli,
Rickards’ own house, now re-opened for him by
Manager Marcus, with a good all-round show.
The Barnards have something new in the marion-
ette line, and Duncan’s collies seem really to
enjoy the fine work they put in. Epecially choice
is the motor-dog who dives under the car when-
ever anything goes wrong, and (after the final
burst-up and break-down) the lady dog who sits
by her deceased relative and buries her face in her
front feet.

“Sailor Jack,” the latest Andersonian
production at the King’s Theatre (Melb.), is one
of those simple, savory sausage melodramas that
any intelligent actor should be able to concoct.
The recipe is written on the tablets of his memory.
Walter Baker is credited with the authorship in
this case—he takes the sausage, so to speak—and
seeing that his own part of it is not conspicuously
fat, and the inhuman interest of the story is about
equally divided among six or seven characters,
Baker deserves to be highly commended for his
moderation. He stage-manages the piece, with
the result that the company gives a more than
merely respectable display of acting. In fact,
there is a lot of go in the performance, and a lot of
merit in the scenery, and a great display of mental
enjoyment by a crowded audience. “ Sailor Jack”
has a few flagrant absurdities in its situations,
especially in the last act—author Walter Baker
and Miss Ross being the chief sufferers —
but Edmund Duggan, Campbell, Vivian Edwards
and Miss Kate Gair get good chances to
achieve some showy surface effects, and
whereas Duggan and Campbell slap the color on
too heavily, the lady’s method is a little too quiet
and natural. Indeed Miss Gair strikes one on
this occasion as being two-thirds, or even five-
sixths, of a capital artist for easy, emotional act-
ing. Bert Bailey, with the assistance of Miss
Maggie Knight, wins roars of applause for the
‘ * comic relief. ” He is there to make ’em larf, and
he makes ’em larf. It is a terrible duty that falls
to Bailey’s lot in Andersonian plays— yet he
never flinches from it. The present writer heard
an enthusiastic admirer declare that “ Bert alone
is worth all the money ”; therefore one may
assume that Bert’s comic relief covers a multitude
of “bobs,” as it were.

So far as The Bulletin can see, W. Cos-
grove’s latest trifle at Melbourne Bijou, “The
Great Redemption ” to wit, is in danger of
nothing but amused disapprobation. It is faintly
atrocious, like a strident picture hat, but its
author is more to be pitied than blamed. Seem-
ingly the manufacturer has borrowed some of his
material from’All Caine’s “Prodigal Son.” As
for the actors, they are for the most part so
unconsciously humorous that this paper can
only think of them as the delusions of a
gin-sodden imagination. One of the gentlemen,
who professes to be a leader of Icelandic society,
is reminiscent of a comic poster picture.
Again, to add to the play’s misfortunes, the older
characters are mostly perpetrated by youthful
persons whose voices, not having lost the fresh
chirpiness of juvenility, fail to blend, as it were,
with the extreme frostiness of their pretended
years. John Cosgrove and Miss Irene Davies,
however, save the outrageous production from
utter badness. The former, in the character of
Magnus Stephensson, acts with a candid robust-
ness that looks like astounding art in such deplor-
able surroundings. During the last act he is
especially convincing in the expression of some
frank blasphemies, in which he appears to regard
The Almighty as One whose forte should have
been something harmless and peaceable like bee
culture, rather than the jerry building of sadly
neglected universes. Miss Davies doubles the
parts of Thora and her daughter Elin, and is un-
undoubtedly the most attractive and pleasing lady
in the piece. As regards the very worst actors in
the co., some of the staring gaps in the stage fur-
niture might be filled by chopping them up. They
are so wooden.

The matinees and the evenings are the
sixth week of the Melbourne pantomimes, and
they are still competing on the question as to
which panto, can turn away the larger amount of
money on Saturday night. Everybody concerned
in these gratifying successes has been mentioned
in previous notices, with the exception, perhaps,
of the demon kings. At both theatres the baffled
potentate is keeping as well as can be expected.
And in both cases he suggests the same idea.
Whether one considers him as the tinted monarch
who fails to blight the effect of “Jack and Gill”
at Her Majesty’s, or the other fellow who has a
“down” on Cinderella at the Royal, one is
surprised that he doesn’t settle the difficulty at
the outset by marrying the Good Fairy. She is a
nice girl in both instances. And, after all, many
good fairies do marry perfect demons.

Tait’s programme at Melbourne Glaciarium
was concerned on Saturday with the portrayal of
a Red Indian hero, among other things. This
Indian, who is sufficiently civilised to realise the
potent splendor of a pretence of chivalry, roams
about, waiting to rescue beautiful white
females in distress. Naturally at this game, in
which he has no superior, he soon becomes the
adored of all the girls and the envied of all the
boys. Yet, with Fate’s tragic inevitableness, he
dies from poison in the last act. and expires with
picturesque abandon in his torn shirt, what time
his grief-stricken donah buries her superb stub
nose in the grease of his raven locks. It is an
affecting picture.

T. J. West entertained a packed house at
Melbourne Olympia on Saturday with about a
dozen tableaux of unusual vividness. The series
was entitled “ The Red Hand,” and depicted a
tidily-planned homicide and sundries. Appar-
ently the subterranean millionth of Paris con-
ducts itself with Bohemian indifference to con-
ventions, for the ladies (or tarts) smoked and
drank with the gentlemen (or blokes) with mag-
nificent negligence. One damsel, partly hidden
in a livid complexion and a tightly-fitting frock,
indulged in a rather Frenchily sensual dance with
a male partner. This was called “The Apache
Dance,” and, considering its bizarrerie and gen-
eral freshness, should be popular as an indoor
pastime before a select attendance of old gentle-
men filled with wine.

On Monday next the A.N.A. Exhibition
of Australian Manufactures opens at the Exhibi-
tion Building. Time was when Melbourne
needed considerable urging to visit its big in-
dustrial show, but its annual arrival is now re-
garded as an Event, and a bare announcement of
the fact clothes itself with dignity.
MELBOURNE OPERA HOUSE.

Rickards.
GUEST or NEWLYN,
of Guest and Newlyn.
At Melbourne Opera House the pro-
gramme has lost Burns and gained a novel form of
entertainment. Yeotha, described as “The In-
dian Red Bird,” was to make her first appearance
on Monday night, assisted by Captain Grade.
Also a pair of acrobats were understood to be
coming due on Wednesday. For the rest there
are Rickaby, the Latonas and a liberal assortment
of other people whose names are more or less
favorably known to the Rickards public.

“ Snell ” : Have attended both Melbourne pantomimes,
and watched and waited, and now record with bitter
regret that every joke that raised a laugh was at least 10
years old. There were some quite new jokes—two-year-
olds—but they passed unseen. In the case of some stars
it takes us years to see their light; in the case of others it
takes as long to see their jokes.
SAILOR JACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When a farmer has two daughters in a 4- or G-act
play,
And Mary lives at home with Dad, but Mabel is
away,
You can bet your bottom dollar that poor Mabel s
“ gone astray.”
If the young Squire wears an eyeglass and is apt
to put on style,
And his dandy cousin Richard has a cold, incisive
smile.
Then you know the Squire’s a “rotter,” and his
relative is vile.
Did you ever meet a Richard (near related to the
Squire),
Who could gaze on any Mabel, clad in picturesque
attire,
And not take certain measures to —well, “ drag
her through the mire ? ”
If the funny man is Bowser, and Bert Bailey
plays the part,
And he rallies round the hero when the trouble
makes a start.
Then we recognise his Virtue and we bless his
honest heart.
These folk are in the drama new of which the
poet sings—
The pie that Walter Baker baked to set before the
King’s—
The drama new, wherein they d.o and say the old,
old things.
Miss Ross is robed in muslin white, for she’s the
spotless maid;
And Baker is brave Sailor Jack who rushes to her
aid;
But poor Miss Gair is doomed to wear the gown
of the Betrayed.
Her heavy father casts her off (he’s very much to
blame)
Because she’s loyal to her toff, and will not tell
liis name—
The dandy cousin toff who was the author of her
Shame.
Poor trustful Mabel hopes to be her lover’s lawful
wife; •
The heavy father swears to take his gal’s be-
trayer's life,
And straightway kills the “rotter” Squire with
Walter Baker’s knife.
A thirst for the seducer’s blud no father ought to
slake;
And wdien he kills the wrong young man he makes
a great mistake.
But hearts must break in five-act plays, or, any-
how, must ache.
Now, all this time one Jabez Slouch is hiding in a
tree
Or dodging round the coiner dark to hear what he
can see.
His name betrays his crooked ways—a base black-
mailer he..
Suspicion falls on Sailor Jack, who seeks a foreign
clime; ■
The heavy father lets it fall; ; he don’t confess his
crime,
But Jabez Slouch gets very drunk and tells the
truth—in time.
And when at last the murder’s out, the heavy
father dies ;
The wicked cousin, he gets hanged for telling
wicked lies ;
And with our ’ard, rough ’and we wipes the tear
drop from our eyes.
For, though the Sailor wins his lass, and Bowser’s
blithe and gay,
And Mrs. Bowser waves her hat and Jabez croaks
“ Hooray ! ’’
The ending seems not happy for the girl who went
astray.
VIO.
E.F.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ Ancient Inhabitant ”: Apropos the Youngs and “Jim
the Penman” (B. 21/l/’09). The author of the play was
Sir Charles Young, a knight or a baronet. Charles
Young, the comedian, never had a handle to his name,
which, in full, was Charles Horace Frisbee Young. When
he retired from the stage Charley Young’s ambition did
not soar beyond a pub. He died (January '29, 1874) as
landlord of the Museum Hotel, which stood at the foot of
William-street (Sydney) at its junction with Boomerang-
street.
“K.”: Mrs. Melba put the Melbourne G.P.O. to a lot o
trouble when she sent a Christmas-box to thesmallest news-
boy in the city. The post authorities had to go to the ex-
pense and weariness of rounding up all the boys with any
shadow of a title to the prize, and claimants had to be
weighed and measured. The City Newsboys’ Society
assisted in yarding the smaller boys, but would not
take the responsibility of picking the winner. And when
the Post and Telegraph Department had drafted the
applicants and awarded the Melba Christmas gift, the
stunted but grateful recipient said, “Yah! cud yer
spare it?”
“ 10-2.4 ” : I note that “ Kodak ” uses these wild
words(B. 24-12-’08) concerning the stage ancient:—“I hate
the stage ancient; I hate his bad grammar and his
stagger, and I am infuriated by his diabolical slowness.
Some night I will rise up and throw a brick at him. I
would have done so before but for the fact that I rarely
take a brick with me to the theatre.” Knowing “ Kodak,”
I am unwilling that he should propel bricks in our Halls
of Glee, and so I will indite a true tale that he may nail
the same over the soap-dish in his bedroom, and study it
when he feels rage stirring within him against the oldster
of drama. A decade ago I was a gay and unpromising
lad. I was living in London at the time. A friend
attained the age of 21 and signalised the event by giving a
large dinner to the males of his acquaintance. Also he
hired boxes at various music halls for our diversion when
the meal was over. I proceeded in due course with three
others to the dress-circle box (O.P. side) of the Tivoli, in
the Strand. It were canting hypocrisy for me to pretend
that I was not “ loaded ” to the muzzle. Nor were my
companions in one whit better case. We lit cigars and
shouted lustily for long whiskies and sodas (these things
are permitted in London), and settled back cheerfully to
enjoy the show. Through a mist of alcohol I scanned the
programme. Suddenly a spasm of rage shook me like a
reed. I had encountered the name of Chirgwin, the
White-Eyed Kaffir. Why it was I know not, but in those
days the sight or thought of Chirgwin always—if I had
been dining—exasperated me beyond endurance. The
more I had dined the more I loathed Chirgwin. Fasting,
I applauded Chirgwin and esteemed him as a sound and
diverting artist. After a heavy meal I could
see no merit in him; he made me feel like a
homicidal maniac. On this occasion, all the joyous
abandon that had marked my conduct during the previous
three hours vanished. I became morose, gloomy, intro-
spective. I pondered on the possibility of “ sticking up ”
Chirgwin in his four-wheeled cab after his turn, and
treating him despitefully. I thought of ascertaining his
private address from some menial about the theatre, and
lying in wait at his front door with a cask of dynamite.
In the midst of my broodings the man himself strode on.
With his own long shadow for vis-a-vis he began a fan-
tastic rigadoon. I gazed dully at his immense tall hat, at
his hateful white eye, at his spider-like legs. Hate
surged in my breast. Rising to my feet I seized someone
else’s whisky-and-soda tumbler and hurled it, contents
and all, at the player’s right eye. He executed a smart
skip and received the missile on the knee instead of on the
skull. My companions were overcome with pleasure at my
spirited action. They cheered me warmly. Chirgwin, I
noted, was essaying, by many a hastily-improvised gag,
to arouse the feeling of the house against me. However,
he failed. Withal a presentiment of something unplea-
sant about to happen oppressed me. Furtively I peered
round the corner of the box. Yes, sure enough, weighty
solemn policemen were massing in clouds at the back of
the dress-circle. I venture to think that my next move
was somewhat Machiavelian. Even as the officers of the
law surged in on us, I rose calmly and entered into
friendly chat with their leader. He was impressed. His
subordinates scragged my friends mosr. brutally, and ran
them with violence towards an exit. Their leader and I
followed like two old friends. In the privacy of the police-
station I frankly owned up to my guilt. There were indi-
cations that if I didn’t my outraged companions would do
it for me. I thought my policeman friend would have fallen
dead. However, he didn’t. Instead he said that I was liable
to six months, and that I would have to wait till Mr.
Asher (the then manager of the Tivoli) arrived to charge
me. When Mr. Asher appeared I fell upon him with
affable words, so that he wrung my hand and said nothing
would induce him to have me gaoled. So I escaped. But
things might well have been otherwise. It may go ill
with “ Kodak ” if he lets his aesthetic sense get out of
hand in this country. I don’t think any local impresario
would readily forgive a patron who criticised his artists
(howsoever doddering) with the offscourings of a brick
foundry. Let “ Kodak ” take warning, and bridle—yea !
even as the striped zebra of the savannah—his baked
earth what time the baldhead quavers vain things across
the footlights.
“M.L.” writes: Is it correct that the late “Widow
O’Brien ” Sheridan was a Dublin Jew? I am inclined to
doubt both the Dublin and the Hebrew. I had some
business with Sheridan, and he told me that he came
from Strabane. County Tyrone, in the North of Ireland,
and thathis parents emigrated and settled in New York.
He mentioned to me either that his family name was
Carlin, or that he had relatives in Strabane named Carlin.
I come from Strabane, and knew there an elderly, sharp-
nosed Irishman named Dan Carlin, who was the very
image of Sheridan. Sheridan also told me, quite cor-
rectly, the names of other families in this small town.
Further he used occasionally to gag about Strabane in
“Fun on the Bristol.” The Carlins were not Jews. In
fact, in the North of Ireland Jews are as scarce as they
are in Scotland.
“N.”: The third instalment of the Life of Richard
Mansfield, in Scribner, improves in interest. Margaret
Anglin appears on the scene. She was the original
Roxane to his Cyrano de Bergerac. Mansfield had an
average of three new plays daily submitted to him.
Somebody forwarded “ Cyrano de Bergerac ” from Paris,
with the remark “Just the part you are looking for.”
“ Oh yes,” said Mansfield, “ I’ve heard that before,” and
he tossed the MSS. aside. Casually taking it up on a
Sunday, he became absorbed, and almost frantic with
delight. He rushed to his manager, Palmer, and gave
an impromptu performance of the character. Hurried
preparations were made to produce it. One can well
understand how Palmer wanted to be in advance of all
the other managers with such booty. However, the
douche of cold water came from Mansfield. He had a
shoal of letters from Paris about this jewel worthy of
Molibre. He mused “ The people who have seen Coquelin
will see Me.” Almost at a moment’s notice he went off
to Paris to see Coquelin, who had been acting Cyrano for
six months. Coquelin had gone to London. Mansfield
fled after him, and saw him act Cyrano at the Lyceum.
After the first act, Mansfield’s heart sank into his hoof-
gear. He said, “Only a Frenchman can perform it, and
Coquelin is the only Frenchman.” Then when the pathos
came in, Mansfield plucked up. He said, “ Coquelin is
the matchless comedian, but this is not all comedy.”
Returning to New York, he went ahead with the rehear-
sals. The actress engaged for Roxane had nerves, and
shrank before the ordeal of rehearsing with Mansfield.
Margaret Anglin was little more than a super. She had
only one line to speak, as the Orange Girl. Mansfield
said, “ Can you make yourself pretty enough for
Roxane?” Margaret, with her ready wit, answered,
“ Yes, if you can make yourself ugly enough for Cyrano.”
After every rehearsal she was in tears because of Mans-
field’s cruelty. Time after time she said to manager
Palmer, “ I won't act with him.” Palmer remonstrated
with Mansfield. Said Mansfield, “ All that girl wants is
suffering. She will come out all right.” The joke was
that he sacked every member of the cast at one time or
another, and the cast is very long. On the first night
Margaret was unmistakably better than the star in their
scenes together : but his was the difficult task. Wynd-
ham’s Cyrano, in London, was good playing, but in-
finitely short of the impersonations by Mansfield and
Coquelin.
From Oamaru (M.L.) comes the news that Sydney’s old
pal, Blandolt, has been nearly killed in a stage motor
smash. The villain was fleeing in his superb 90 H.P.
Singemoine from Max Maxwell (Hero) and Bland (Comic
Chauffeur with a Good Heart) in their gorgeous triple-
expansion Maraud-Safran. All was going well, and the
excitement of the audience was such that it had tempor-
arily given over both orange-sucking and peanut-gnawing,
when suddenly something happened to the peerless
steering-gear of the Maraud-Safran car. In rather less
time than it takes to run over a dog, Bland, Maxwell and
juggernaut sped wildly into the orchestra. Bland was
stunned, much damage was done to the car and to the
musician-corral, and several harmless necessary exploiters
of bassoons and the like received severe jolts. If we did
not like Bland passing well we should say, “ Serve him
right.” It is not seemly for a stage hero and his chauffeur
to motor-hog even for the purpose of overhauling a
levanting villain.
“ Eja.vem ” : A well-preserved, keen-witted man looked
Henry Davenport (cetat 63) as he toed the mark at North
Sydney Police Court last week to defend a charge of
fortune-telling by palmistry. He is the surviving half of
the once world-famed Davenport Bros, combination.
Between 30 and 40 years ago the Davenports were the
greatest rope-tieing tricksters and illusionists in the
world. They were introduced to the Australian public at
the Melbourne Town Hall in 1877 in conjunction with
Professor Fay. The Davenports were rolling in boodle
at the time, and they met bumper houses everywhere.
A decade later Ira Davenport—a fine, handsome fellow,
and a great “pace’’-maker—died wi\le touring in
Maoriland. Henry “rested” for a t.me after that.
Financial exigencies forced him into the show business
again, but he did little good. Since then he has at differ-
ent times had small shows in Australian provincial towns,
has run a sawmill, and taken charge of machinery and
steam and gas engines. As a palmist and phrenologist
he was moderately successful, in a financial sense. He
claims to believe implicitly in palmistry. It is cheering,
for the sake of lang syne, etc., to know that Magistrate
King dismissed the charge against the veteran, and that
he is off with a companion-in-buskins for the country with
a variety combination.
“D.”: What a painfully unlikely fellow the stage
wrong-’un or “rip” of the “Rat” Reresby description
(vide him at Sydney Royal any night) is in appearance !
He is ashen pale always. Lines of sorrow corrugate his
worn, unshaven countenance. He has not a laugh in his
repertory. The nearest he gets to cheerfulness is an
occasional mirthless “ Ha ! Ha ! ” accompanied by a jaw-
distortion effect that may equally signify that the dis-
torter is amused or that he has been served with a ca sa
order. His dominant characteristics seem to be dirt,
depression, and dyspepsia. How different from the real
thing! The most infernal scoundrel I ever knew was an
Irishman of a well-known family. He was never pale.
The glow of health beamed from his smooth, brown
cheeks. He was always cheery, and always carefully shaved
and brushed and tailored. His blue eyes met those of
the person he was taking down with the mild, trusting
candor of a little child. The haunted look of his stage
prototype was absent from him. He was devoid, as to
his open brow, of any line of care, anxiety, or remorse.
Withal his doings during the previous decade had been
such as to put Reresby’s paltry “ copine ” transaction in
connection with that sorrel horse right into the dark.
He was a notorious card-sharper, a pigeon-shot who
killed for himself or missed for the “ books ” with absolute
impartiality, a stiffener of innocent racehorses, and a
heap of other things that, as I think of his charming
manners, I try always to put behind me. And so with
others of his kind whom I have bumped against on life’s
weary round. They were never self-conscious re-
garding their moral turpitude. The degradation of it
did not make them dreary or dusty or insanitary looking.
It is with a throb of sadness —an involuntary temptation
to get up and rail against Fate—that I recall one of the
most afflicted-looking humans I have ever met. He was
in a railway carriage. His face-scorings betokened the
ravages of moral weakness, vice—aye ! —crime. Deathless
regret for his wasted past, for his pure boyhood’s days,
and the ethical might-have-beens in general, crouched
moaning, as it were, behind his hopeless eyes. His nose
was crimson—presumably from drink. His hand shook.
I diagnosed (a) morphine, (b) nicotine poisoning. He
could have gone on to any stage as a horrible example of
the results of a gay life without troubling to make up for
the turn. On inquiry I learned that he was alocal preacher,
a teetotaler, a non-smoker, and a passionate supporter of
anti-gaming legislation. In the matter of dispensing
faces appropriate to the way and habit of life of the
owners, it seems to me that Providence might well take
a hint from the wielders of the hare’s foot.
AN ALLURING PROGRAMME: CHEAP, YET
THRILLING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We spent a Sunday in Naples, and visited the Cathedral
and several chapels, and also the chamber of the Inquisi-
tion, where the iron which held the guillotine in its place,
the block on which the head was laid, and the hole in the
floor through which the head fell after decapitation, were
still showing. But of this I will speak next week.—
Parson Dill Macky, of Sydney.
Brethren, roll up and hear me talk of Blood
Next week. I shall unloose a perfect flood
Of evidence against the Church of Rome
And those who dwell ’neath Peter’s wicked dome ;
Yea, I shall cause your marrow-bones to freeze
As though some icy Cold World winter’s breeze
Had breathed on them. Of racks I shall discourse
And of that engine hight the Spikfed Horse,
Whereon the Derry Boy is ridden till
He yelps with anguish. Hast heard of the Hill,
The barrel filled with nails, the bloque inside
And what he looks like when his mile-long ride
Or roll (which term you will) is over ? No?
Nor of those cells, described by E. A. Poe,
Whose walls close on the Protestant within,
And squelch him while monks rub their hands and grin?
Ah, ’bis a gracious thing to chat about,
The Scarlet Wummun’s crimes ; I love to flout
Pius the Tenth and myrmidons. (I learn
On good authority that ev’ry spurn
I hurl at Pius makes him writhe with pain,
And vow he will not misbehave again.)
Again I say, step up and help the cause
Of Rome-reform. Don’t, I implore you, pause
Or hesitate. You’ll get your money’s worth.
In fancy’s eye you’ll see this dull old earth
One mass of gore ; imaginary yells,
Such as men give who taste the sev’ral hells
Of boiling, shall assail your list’ning ears,
And fill your mind with weird, delicious fears.
By patronising me, you’ll boost the Crown
And Bible. The show’s cheap at thrippence down.

TROUBLE AHEAD.
THE POLICEMAN'S SON : “ Them Broken Hill
blokes are goitern’ter cop out. Me old man’s
gone up there, an’ ’e’s took ’is belt.”
Ifc leaked out a few days ago that Sun-
shine (Vic.) has been doing things again. About
a month ago several goods trains (luckily the pas-
senger traffic had stopped for the night) found
themselves held up at two o’clock in the morning
at the stations on either side of the place where
the still-unexplained butchery happened, because
they couldn’t get the “line clear” signal. Re-
peated telegraph calls to Sunshine evoked no
response, and at last the officer-in-charge at West
Footscray chanced it, and sent a train on slowly
to investigate. As an extra precaution he sent a
policeman along with the train. The explorers
found the Sunshine officer-in-charge, porter, sig-
nalman and telegraphist—in fact, the whole staff
—lying unconscious on the station floor. When
the man revived sufficiently he explained that
he had been taken suddenly ill, and that was all
he knew about it. He is now on sick-leave. Com-
missioner Fitzpatrick explained later that the
affair was quite unavoidable, because “you can’t
eliminate the human element from precautions
taken to prevent accident.” Which is quite
true ; yet if the precaution takes the form of one
man to do the work of five men and three horses,
it is quite in accordance with human nature that
the precaution shall be found lying unconscious
on the floor. Thk Bulletin doesn’t say that
there was the work of five men to do in this case ;
it only remarks that things in Victoria seem to
have a general tendency that way.
* * * *
There is scarcely a dull moment now on
the Victorian railways; when it isn’t tragedy
that’s happening, it is farce. On Saturday even-
ing, Jan. 16, a goods train collided with a pas-
senger train near Ballarat; but as only an engine
was damaged, everybody concerned is saying
nothing with much spirit. The same night part
of a mixed train broke away from the engine on
the gradient between Broadmeadows and Essen-
don, and threatened to smash right down into
Spencer-street; but a plucky gateman managed
to drop some of the truck brakes as the riot passed,
and so enabled the guard to pull up the jugger-
naut with his hand-brake. Apparently there
wasn’t any Westinghouse brake on this outfit; if
there was, it is up to somebody to explain exactly
why it didn’t act. That contrivance is supposed to
hold a carriage dead once the pipe is broken or dis-
connected from the engine in any way, and the
idea that it could possibly fail was scouted when
the Sunshine disaster was being talked about.
* * * *
A turgid stream of rubbish flows nowadays
from Broken Hill. The limit was reached when
one “special reporter” wired down the wild yarn
that a pile of bricks at a new building had been
stolen, “ evidently to be used as ammunition ” by
the miners. Heaven only knows why a man
would cart around bricks in a place like
Broken Hill, even supposing he did want
to throw something hard at somebody; for
you can’t move 4ft. in “ the silver city ”
without tripping over a stone. Every few
hundred yards there is an outcrop of rocks. Some
streets don’t have to be metalled at all; the
council just cuts down the rock as far as it wants
to go; and when the council does put road-metal
on a street no rain falls on it for months at a time,
so the stones work up. Every horse in Broken
Hill picks up so many gibbers in its hoofs that
even if it is only a half-educated horse, it knows
when to stop and hold up an appealing paw.
Moreover, as if there weren’t enough stones on the
spot, about two-thirds of Broken Hill has at some
time or other been interested in a “show ” (which
is the raw product out of which mines and wild
cats are made), and everybody who is interested in
a “show.” makes it a point of honor to “ bring in a
few specimens,” and dump them in his back yard.
You simply can’t dodge stones at Broken Hill.
You are even in danger of having one drop
through the roof on to your best crockery on ac-
count of some extra-energetic blast from some
mine, or open cut, or mullock quarry or other.
And now, when the miners won’t supply the
special reporters with any real news, the reporters
struggle to earn their fabulous salaries and ex-
penses by pulling a confiding public’s leg with
yarns concerning desperate fellows getting up in
the dead of night to steal bricks, “evidently for
ammunition.” It would have been a very good
yarn if it had come from some places—from an
iceberg, for instance—but it’s a shocking waste of
ingenious lie to send it from the Barrier.
The importation into Australia of the
often-infected “old do’ ” of commerce is now
forbidden, and it is well that this should be so.
At one time, when Australia was overflowing
with loose gold, curious old clo’ advertisements
were published in the leading London papers.
Here is one from the Illustkated London News
18/12/’5B
W ANTED left-off clothes for Australia, in good or
inferior condition. Mr. and Mrs. John Isaacs,
319 and 320 Strand, opposite Somerset House, con-
tinue to give the highest prices in cash for ladies’,
gentlemen’s and children’s clothes, regimentals,
underclothing, boots, books, jewellery and all mis-
cellaneous property. Letters for any day or distance
punctually attended to. Parcels sent from the
country either large or small, the utmost value re-
turned by post-office order the same day. Reference,
London and Westminister Bank. Established 49 years.
In return, Robert Hyde and Co., the pioneer rag
merchant of Melbourne, sent bales of old clo’ to
the English paper mills—clothes which the
Johnnies, who thought that the streets of Mel-
bourne were paved with gold, sold cheaply when
their cash gave out. Hyde made a fortune out of
the export of broken glass, metals and old clo’.

SIS: "Yes, sir. Which’ll yer have —white or red!"
BAGMAN: “ Haven’t they got names?”
SIS: “Not till they go sour. Then dad calls ’em hock and claret.”
A young Melbourne man has been relating
some disconcerting experiences. He alleges that
he is persistently accosted by a pugnacious, but
lugubrious old party who insists on being his
father. Three times the old boy has met the
young man, and three times has asked him to
produce his birth certificate. Twice the ancient
has belted him with his fist because he didn’t tear
the document from its concealment, and once the
aged one upset him, knelt on his chest, and
emptied some irritant poison into his interior.
There is no doubt about the irritant poison,
because a doctor extracted it with a stomach-
pump. But what the community is trying to
explain is the aged and eccentric parent. A
detective who took the mystery of the aged parent
in hand seems to have abandoned the job with
scorn and alacrity.

In a sale of property at Portland ('Vic.)
the other day, the Richmond Hotel was dis-
posed of. It claims the distinction of being
the oldest surviving building in Victoria. It
belonged to the estate of the late Mrs. S. G.
Henty, so was probably occupied by one of the
family in the early days.

Talking of pugilism, and the “splendid
courage ” said to be characteristic of its exponents,
a Melbourne stockbroker spins a little yarn.
Not long ago he was invited by another
patron of sport to hold the watch at what
was expected to be a merry meeting. Two
fishermen of the Brighton district were
going to settle their difference. A fiver
had been put up, and a desperate encounter
was promised. The broker tore down to
Brighton, and, finding the engagement
ring accurately designed and the general
appearance of things thoroughly business-
like, consented to watch the proceedings.
The result was disappointing. The more
willing combatant had all the best of it
from the start, and the other fellow would,
seemingly, have been counted out in the
second round if the timekeeper hadn’t
cut it unduly short. Time-keeper had
counted on an interesting performance,
and he meant to keep the curtain up for
fully half-an-hour, if possible. But early
in the third round the unwilling fisher-
man dropped himself down and lay as
one dead. Timekeeper counted the seconds
on a lengthening scale. The pause between
“five” and “six” was long and significant.
When he got to “seven” he leaned down and
shouted in the ear of the recumbent figure.
Another quarter of a minute ebbed away
ere he bellowed “eight.” The fallen pugilist,
who had been lying with his back towards the
watchman, turned slowly round and said : “You
can count a blanky thousand if you like—but I
shan’t get up."

The restaurant employees’ claim for better
conditions is now before the N.S.W. Arbitration
Court. According to the evidence given by the
manager of a fashionable Sydney tea-house the
waitresses are employed for 50 hours a week, and
the wages vary from 13s. to 17s. Tips are extra
when there are any, but the tips from Sydney’s
afternoon tea-ites are practically an invisible item.
So a waitress’s job is plainly not worth a fortune,
yet the billets are rushed. A waitress in a fashion-
able restaurant is certainly “moving in society
circles,” and she gets a fairly good back view of
the clothes of the local peerage as she passes the
bun over its shoulder. Also, there is always the
possibility of marriage with a customer ; but while
this is not a remote contingency, even the boss
hasn’t the cheek to ask that it be set off against
the poverty of the wages.
An occasional sailorman’s theory, that
accidents are most difficult to avoid in fine
weather, is propped up with a certain quantity of
prop by recent happenings. The running down
of a man-o’-war’s boat by the Dunmore in Sydney
harbor seemed an impossibility as far as weather
and atmospheric conditions went; and the acci-
dent to the coasting passenger steamer Karuah
on Stockton beach looks equally unexplainable.
The night was clear, and as calm as Ton* Mann
when he was arrested. The sea was a liquid
billiard-table. The winds had all died and been
buried. The moon shone like a new threepenny
piece on a dark blue plate. Yet the vessel ran
full tilt on to Stockton beach nearly at right
angles to its course, with two lighthouses in full
view, and not a soul knew until it was actually in
the breakers. The Karuah was the latest impor-
tation in steamers ; it was brand new, and the
only satisfactory-looking explanation yet given ia
that, being so new, it had not learnt the way.
For educated coasting vessels often come along on
their own, though that sort of thing brings the
raw, ignorant ship to grief. It is only recently
that a collier which left Wollongong for Sydney
at 11 p.m. ran on the rocks two hours afterwards,
and at the time it was going full speed apparently
back to Wollongong. Someone went to sleep
with the helm over, and the collier might have
gone round and round in a big circle only for a
foolish old coast getting in the way.
THE TEST OF FRIENDSHIP.
BIGGS: “ What makes everybody avoid Jenkinson
nowadays? He used to be such a popular
fellow."
JIGGS: “O don'cherno', he’s trying to publish
his poems by subscription."
The Melbourne police have at last taken
an interest in the city’s fortune-telling fakirs. A
first round-up brought in 14 dabblers in the dark
and devious arts of making easy money. For
once there was some originality about the police
methods. One detective disguised himself as a
drover in a red beard and a beery breath, and
went round with a dog-collar looking for a mythi-
cal pup that had disappeared like G. Reid’s
dog. He was positively informed by different
“ futurists ” that the dog was (1) an Irish setter,
(2) a water spaniel, (3) a Smithfield collie, (4) a
crossbred bullpup, and (5) that it wasn’t a dog
at all, but a dingo. Also, it had been stolen by
27 different dog-fanciers. The only point of re-
semblance was that the information was worth
five bob—the fortune fakirs were quite unanimous
on that. Another ’tec had an exciting chase after
a wife who doesn’t exist. He discovered that she
had cleared to Sydney with the lodger, was pro-
viding divorce material in the Exhibition Gardens,
and was dead in seven different styles.
OUR LADY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
After four years, executions have been revived in
France. On Honda}', four men were publicly guillotined
in Paris, and four at Bethune, near Calais. An enormous
crowd treated the occasion as a popular ffite.
Our Lady wakes; while Paris throng's
Her court in humor gay,
And comes with laughter and with songs
To make a holiday.
Golden the happy morning breaks
Across the sky serene ;
Old love will be renewed ; she wakes—
Our Lady Guillotine.
Years in cold slumber she has lain,
While Paris grieved to miss
So long the gushing scarlet stain
That follows on her kiss.
Now, shake the basket free from dust,
For heads are hers in store ;
And let her teeth put off their rust—
Our Lady wakes once more.
A day of ffite ! We travel fast,
And travel many a mile :
Our Lady Guillotine at last
Will show her flashing smile.
So necks will stoop and heads will fall
Beneath her stroke serene,
And Paris will be, after all,
The city she has been.
Our Lady’s lovers once could count
Through many a daily score :
One would descend, another mount,
So hot a love they bore.
The proud and poor together stepped,
They came from north and south.
Our Lady kissed them, till they slept,
With her warm, dripping mouth.
Then fill the Paris roads again
With holiday delight;
Our Lady’s lips a cup will drain
Before she sleeps to-night 1
Red is the wine her henchmen pour
To sate her longing keen ;
She wakes again: Ma’mselle La Mort,
Our Lady Guillotine 1

“GiSilti' 1 : The news of the destruction
by fire of the Tower of Babel at Broken Hill is
regrettable, for the late demented Structure Was a
rarity. It stood Gsft. high, atld Was octagonal in
shape* The base was about 18ft, through; the
whole narrowihg at the top to a balcony Bft. in
width. There Were five rooms ih the building;
otte on top of the other. Access Was gained to
these rooms by means of a spiral olitside stairway.
The framework was of timber and lattice with
iron bands aroUnd each floor, and the whole was
lined with ruberoid. Large cable ropes served as sup-
ports; and likewise as firc-e3Capes. The vibration
of the flimsy structure Was so great as to render it
impossible to take a photograph from the summit
on a windy day. This building was erected in
the owner’s back-yard; he let the “flats” to
miners; and thus made even his yard a source of

“ I\S.P.” S Boh monumental patience;
lead me to the gentry who fish off St* Kilda pier.
Seven months ago 1 left Melbourne; and a few
days back returned. 1 found the same old
anglers on the same old jetty. From them I
learned that the total catch of all hands per week
(there are 15 of them Usually) averages as follows :
Eatable fish—mine flathead, five barracoota, three
sand-mullet. Uneatable fish —four gummy sharks,
four pigfish, five fish that blow themselves out
like footballs when landed and are liable to
damage people when they burst (their name is
unknown to me), and 346 starfish. The normal
still-life, catch Consists of nine pieces of scrap-iron,
64 dead marines, 33 Old boots, and 568 bunches of
seaweed, The haul per man per day may, there-
fore, be estimated at two-sevenths of a fish, the
rest marine dust-heapproduce. Verily, the piet
fisherman reposes arm-in-arm with patience.

Another sizeable hole gaped in the Vic.
Licensing Act at Geelong lately, when a Bavarian
or Magyar person named Michael O’Callaghan
was charged with entering a hotel and becoming
an active swallower of the goods there on sale,
although he was under' a prohibition order.
Michael was observed by a constable at the usual
little passage window in the act of hiding beer
down his throat. It'looked as though a fine were
certain, until his lawyer casually remarked that,
according to the Act, it was necessary for Mr.
0 Callaghan to have consumed the prohibited
liquor in the bar, and as he had . merely stood at
the side window he was obviously as innocent as
if he had never looked at a pub in his life. Then
the Court nodded to the prosecuting inspector,
and that person withdrew the charge in a great
hurry.
“Common Law Side”: The S. M.
Herald published (22/l/’09) what it termed a
“disclaimer” by Wade of any designs upon the
N.S.W. Chief Justiceship. Here it is in its
entirety:—
Why my name should be mentioned in this connection
I do not know. I have never at any time expressed by
word or by deed the least desire to receive the office of
Chief Justice, and, indeed, if I had been influenced by
selfish considerations, I could easily have refused the
application of the Chief Justice for leave to have climbed
into office myself, and to have left the question of a vote
in his favor to be scrambled for by Parliament. Perhaps,
after all, I may apply a more crucial standard of fitness
in my ease than many of those who expected that I would
take the position of Chief Justice.
Where is the “disclaimer ” in the above ? Rather
it strikes me as a deliberate avoidance of any-
thing of the sort. Wade’s Parliamentary sup-
porters (I don’t talk of the Havid Storey brand,
but of the true-blue, disinterested Deformers), the
daily press of N.S.W., the Bench and the Bar are
all hankering to hear him say definitely that he
does not purpose to create the scandal that his
own appointment as C. J. would involve. And
none knows it better than Wade. He has but to
say, “ I shall never make myself Chief Justice,”
and several hundred tons of prominent citizens
will fall on his neck, figuratively speaking, with
relieved sighs. Why doesn’t he do it! Where-
fore does he maunde;r about “not knowing why
his name should be mentioned in this connection.”
Why make the futile and unnecessary statement
that he “has never by word or deed,” etc., etc. ?
Such palpable hedging may “ g® ” in a Liberal and
Deform committee-room, but it is far too thin for
print. Thinner still is Wade’s claim that he could
have climbed into the office of Chief Justice straight
away had he liked. Theoretically he could ; in
practice he couldn’t. There are some things that
common decency forbids a man to do. This is one
of them. Wade’s party is in bad odor throughout
the State. His Industrial Disputes Act has
proved worse than a failure. His social legis-
lation is unpopular in the soft-drinks-vending
and lolly-retailing circles where it is effective.
As to the real evils aimed at by it, the
police already recognise that it is not going
to check them in any degree, and the pietists rage
accordingly. The Parliamentary WaDE-ites don’t
conceal the fact that they are hopelessly divided
amongst themselves. That the leader of so
riddled and disorganised a band should bolt for
safety in the black hour is incredible. Wade has
been careful to say nothing to debar him from dis-
placing G. B. Simpson when the clouds that are
now darkening Deform shall have rolled by some-
what ; and, if I know C. G. Wade, he doesn’t
mean to say anything.

One of the reasons why Bull has to be so
polite to foreigners nowadays is that he is the
general sea-carrier to the nations of the earth.
The man who toils till 11 o’clock at night with
his horse and waggon, and waits patiently whilst
the sleepy householder examines the parcel and
signs the book with a chewed stub of pencil, can-
not afford to offend his customers, even if they
keep him up late. Bull is in much the same posi-
tion. However, all the courtesy and considera-
tion on the sea won’t avail against cut-throat com-
petition, and poor old “John Bull, Licensed
Carrier and Freetrader,” has whole docks and
rivers full of his sea waggons laid up this winter.
In England, at the present time, nearly 2,000,000
tons of shipping are lying idle, and every day
more and more ships come in, and, after paving
off their crews, tie up in the most sheltered spot
available. Last month some 80 steamers were
floating, cold and empty, on the Tyne, and five
South Wales ports mustered among them 51 un-
employed tanks.
“G.S.K.” writes :—
The news comes from Goulburn (N.S.W.) that Bishop-
thorpe is again to be the home of Bishop Barlow. Pro-
bably wiser councils have prevailed in view of the con-
tinued threats of the Countess Rossi, that she will carry
into effect the old condition of the deed of gift of Count
Rossi that the Bishop must reside at Bishopthorpe, other-
wise the grant of the grounds on which the Cathedral
stands, and likewise the Bishopthorpe grant, will be void.
This reminds me of the old incident, when the late Count
Rossi insisted on the return of the then Bishop to Bishop-
thorpe, which he had vacated because he preferred a town
house. The Count demanded the Gaitered One’s re-ap-
pearance, and took possession of the Cathedral for some
days. Whilst locked in he was fed by means of a rubber
tube inserted through the keyhole, and there he remained
till the Bishop returned to Bishopthorpe. Probably it is
the dread of a repetition of this incident, with the
Countess as the chief character, that has caused Bishop
Barlow to return to his country residence.
Anent Sydney’s red-roofed suburb of
Mosman, E. J. Martin writes :—
“Paddy” Leahy, Mayor of Mosman, passed out last
week. He was one of those men who achieve success
by happening upon a locality at the psychological
moment and sharing in its growing prosperity.
“ Paddy ” went to Mosman some 15 or 16 years ago, and
started without a “ bean.” But the little township soon
after began to feel itself, and to realise that it had that
future which its founder and exploiter, old Dick Harnett,
saw when he commenced the conquest and annexation
of the gem harbor suburb in the early ’70’s. The late
Mr. Leahy began an auctioneering and estate
agency in time to catch a big share of the boom.
If he didn’t die rich it was because he was a pretty liberal
spender in the district which he idolised and in which he
spent the best years of his life.
The history of the great Harnett estate is the history of
Mosman’s creation. In 1839 Richard Hayes Harnett arrived
from Cork. He was of a Kentish family which had
settled in Ireland for a generation or so. Harnett,
instead of spending his boodle like most new arrivals,
looked round for graft, and walked to Wellington to get
a billet. The job didn’t suit, so he laid out £200 in
cattle. The deal wasn’t a success, and Dick sold out
mostly on tick, and some of the cattle remained on
tick for about 16 years. Anyhow he then settled down
to his real vocation as a Sydney commercial giant. He
was for a while connected with the firm of Rowan, McNab
and Co., and as soon as he was financially strong he
started the siege of Mosman. He saw a golden future
in the scrubby wilderness where, early last century, the
whaler Archibald Mosman obtained his grants, so that he
might have a bit of shore whereon to boil down blubber.
In 1873 Mr. Harnett built a house at Mosman. At that
time there were not 20 houses on the bay. He established
ferry services and ran a line of ’buses so as to establish
communication with Sydney by Milson’s Point.
The Harnett estate at one time totalled close on a square
mile of Mosman land. The construction of the Military-
road in 1874 considerably helped on the sale and sub-
division of land into building allotments. Harnett estab-
lished a quarry at Mosman, which supplied all the stone
required to build the Wilson Hall of the Melbourne Uni-
versity, the late Samuel Wilson having donated £30,000
for that purpose.
Young Dick Harnett, now a pretty old veteran, occu-
pied the first mayoral chair of the municipality, and his
father lived to see Mosman arrive at a respectable glory
in 1902. Then he died. Mosman of to-day has a popula-
tion of 13,000 people, occupying 2486 houses in 57 miles
of streets. Like most rapidly-built towns, it is defective
in its public buildings, and one of the last mayoral
minutes penned by Paddy Leahy was to point out the
necessity of reconstructing the town hall.
A letter from Melbourne : .
In the numerous newspaper explanations of why the
most respected French citizen of Melbourne has been
summoned to Paris there is more than meets the eye and
less than should have been stated. The facts are of posi-
tively imperial significance. About a year ago it hap-
pened as a matter of course that the recently-arrived
manager of the French Bank (Comptoir d’Escompte) in
Melbourne was nominated for membership of the local
Alliance Frangaise. Also his wife was nominated, the
Alliance being a society formed for the purpose of pro-
moting the study of French language and literature
among both sexes and all classes of the community. The
Alliance Franchise, in fact, is so essentially different from
a social club in its professed objects that the mere desire
for membership is practically a guarantee of the appli-
cant’s fitness. A Shakspeare, Browning or Dickens society
is open to any shabby scholar who can borrow the
amount of his annual subscription, or to any servant girl
with poetry in her soul. Therefore, when the manager of
the French bank and his wife became candidates for admis-
sion to the Alliance Frangaise, they should have been wel-
comed as new lights to lighten the darkness. Their know-
ledge of French literature was somewhat more advanced
than that of Mrs. Holroyd, the president of the Alliance,
or of Mrs. Cave, the treasurer, or even, perhaps, of Mrs.
Crevelli, who called herself “ The French President ” of
the pretentious organisation.
Nevertheless, the new French bank manager was black-
balled, and his wife also had to suffer the same social in-
dignity. The reason for this petty outrage was known
to many members at the time. It was a small, private
matter, arising out of somebody’s injured feelings. The
name of the somebody is well enough known.
There was naturally a disturbance in the Alliance
Frangaise when this insult to the d’Argevals came to be
t ilked of. An attempt was made to get the black-
balled parties properly elected, but the opposition of
the little hostile faction proved too strong. Then the
majority of the members appealed to Mr. Maistre, the
Consul for France in Melbourne, who, by virtue of his
position, is “president d’honneur” of the Literary
Society. Maistre was asked to say whether the black-
balling of the banker and his wife was justifiable. He
politely informed Mrs. Holroyd, the president, Mrs. Cave,
the treasurer, and Mrs. Crevelli, the “ French President,”
that the unfortunate incident ought not to have occurred,
or words to that effect.
Whereupon the unabashed females above-mentioned
wrote to the headquarters of the Alliance Frangaise, in
Paris, asking for Maistre’s decision to be overruled. But the
parent society formally and emphatically said “ ditto ” to
Maistre, and wrote to him to thank him for his action in
the matter. Consequently the old government of the
Vic. branch of the Alliance Frangaise resigned its three
portfolios. Mrs. Holroyd relapsed into obscurity. Mrs.
Cave’s books were handed over to her successor, and Mrs.
Crevelli ceased to be “French President.” Then the
little society started to prosper as it had never prospered
before, and the “ blackball ” incident was thought to have
died a natural death.
Seemingly, however, the blackballing faction couldn’t
sit quiet under its discomfiture. It must have pitched a
yarn, and pitched it often, to the vice-regal Talbots, who
were then getting near the end of their costly engage-
ment in Melbourne. As the result of this playing on the
awful vice-regal ignorance of the late Gov. of Vic., a mild
complaint against Maistre —of all people ! —was made to
the French Government through the British Ambassador
in Paris. The gentleman who for 25 years has been the
esteemed French Consul in Melbourne, and whose only con-
nection with the wretched Alliance Frangaise scandal was
that of arbitrator and peacemaker, has been represented
to the Government of France as a danger to the blessed
Entente Cordiale. Mrs. Holroyd figures in the British
Ambassador’s reports as a sort of Australian Queen who
laid down her sceptre because Mr. Maistre had plunged
the French and English sections of Melbourne into civil
war. Therefore the Consul has been summoned to Paris
to explain to the French Minister exactly what the row
was all about. Meanwhile, the small dissenting faction
is chuckling over the success of its scheming, but it goes
without saying that its chuckles will presently fade aw y
into a painful silence. \

Sydney ’Varsity is again in the throes of a
Senate election, the vacant seat being that of the
late Arthur Renwick. Previous occasions have
seen fierce combats between Law and Medicine.
Law won last time and this time has allowed
two medicos—Purser and Camac Wilkinson—to
squabble for the seat. Sydney ’Varsity Senate
elections are all alike. When they are on, the
“alumni” (which is ’Varsity slang for “push”)
holler out loud for University reform. When
over, the alumni resume the shoving of their in-
dividual barrow until next election. There never
are any reforms.

There have been changes in this bank besides those shown
in the accounts. For 20 years—Thk Bulletin files go
back that far—one entry ran, “ Assistant Manager and
Chief Inspector, T. B. Gaden.” That pillar of the bank’s
service retired last year, and with these accounts appears
for the first time, “ Assistant General Manager and Chief
Inspector, H. H. Massie.” General-manager Dihbs has
scored 41 not out in his office ; and 11. 11. Massie, who
has played many a fine innings in the past, can scarcely
wish for anything better than to do as well as the veteran
who is at the other end of the wicket. During the half-
year, the second recent increase of capital took place ;
this time, 20,000 shares were issued at par. All, of
course, were applied for, and practically all have been
paid up ; £248,591 out of the quarter-million has been
received. Practically all of it has carried the dividend as
from Oct. 1. Therefore, in the following comparison,
showing profit earned on the basis of capital and reserves,
it is assumed that the new capital was available on Oct.

This return is not very high compared with that of some
other prosperous banks; but, as against that, one has to
take into account the very large proportion of funds kept
in a liquid state. The bank owes in all £17,499,728 ; and
the liquid assets represent over 49 per cent., orpractically
half of that total—an exceedingly strong position.
In the past 12 months the movements have
been as follows :

Deposits have shrunk a little, as they have with almost
every Australian bank. Advances have, however, in-
creased substantially ; and the bank, on account of the
strength of its cash position, is very well placed to
pursue that policy still further. A great deal of this
money has, no doubt, gone into country lands and the
improvements thereon—a branch of the business to which
the Commercial of Sydney has given a lot of attention.
As shown just now, the total debt to the public is
£17,499,728. The bank’s own capital and reserves total
£2,790,043 ; so the proportion of shareholders’ funds to
the public’s is £1 to £6 ss. A while ago the proportion
was £1 to £7: the recent large increase of capital,
amounting to £488,591 in two vears, has thus given de-
positors more security. On the'other hand, the bank has
set itself a big task. Its capital is now 50 per cent, more
than it was two years ago ; and it is a big undertaking to
pay a 10 per cent, dividend on so large an amount of new
capital raised within so short a period. Cert airily the
first of the new issues was at a premium of £2 10s.; but
allowing for that, the 10 per cent, dividend is equivalent
to £9 2s. per cent, on all the capital raised during the
past two years. Only the big additions previously made
to reserves, and the capacity of the bank to do a bigger
business, could enable the management to face such a
dividend payment without anxiety.

Though the profits are a shade less in proportion to earn-
ings, and though there are one or two other movements
which, under ordinary circumstances, wouldn’t be re-
garded as pleasant, yet this present balance-sheet is, on
the whole, more satisfactory than the one that was issued
six months ago. At that time liquid assets had been
reduced to 23 per cent, of the total debt to the
public; and that was considerably below a fair thing.
Apparently advances have been called in, or have come
in without being called ; so that now, as deposits have
kept steady, the liquid reserves represent 31 per cent, of
the debt. Still, compared with 12 months ago, the
figures are nothing to be enthusiastic about:—

Under ordinary conditions those figures don’t spell larger
profits. Nevertheless the Victorian outlook is no doubt
better now than it was 12 months ago ; harvest prospects
are better, and so is the outlook for wool.
Calculated on the basis of shareholders’ funds
(capital and reserves combined), the profits are on the
small side:—
June, 1905 .. £4 3 1 p.c. June, 1907 .. £5 5 4 p.c.

Dec., 1906 .. 5 3 6 „ Dec., 1908 .. 518 9 ~
But, though that is a very different thing from
the £l3 14s. lOd. per cent, shown by the last
accounts of the Bank of Australasia, the difference
doesn’t all arise from a difference in the quality
and earning capacity of the assets. For every £1
of its own funds the Bank of Australasia has the use of
about £6 Is. of the public’s, while the Bank of Victoria
has only £3 18s.; and if the bank can only average lj per
cent, of profit on public money, the difference between
the two means about £2 12s. 6d. per cent, in
favor of the ’Asia. Yet, if the Bank of Victoria hasn’t
got that profit, it hasn’t got the risk which a bank
must take when it borrows other people’s money and
invests it. And, given equally good management, the
depositors’ risk is also less, for obviously there isn’t as
much hazard in lending to a bank which has borrowed
little in proportion to its own capital as to one which has
borrowed a great deal. Another reason why one bank
can earn £l3 14s. lOd. per cent, on its capital and reserves
while another shows only £5 18s. 9d. per cent, is that one
bank’s reserves are not necessarily the same as another
bank’s: one bank may show all it has, while another may
write its assets down ; or the latter may have acquired
assets out of undisclosed profits, in which case its reserves
are really larger than they are represented. The Bank of
Victoria’s premises, for instance, stand in the books
at £263,762, equal to £4 13s. per cent, of the
advances; while the ’Asia’s premises stand at
£220,222, or £1 7s. per cent, of the advances. If the
’Asia’s premises were valued on the same scale as the
Bank of Victoria’s in proportion to advances, they would
stand in the books at about £780,000, instead of £220,222.
Quite likely they are worth not far short of the former
amount; if so, that bank has reserves of over £500,000
which it doesn’t mention. Still the Bank of Victoria has
only been travelling 56 years, while the other one has
been on the track for 73 years ; and quite apart from the
trouble into which the Victorian madness of the early
’nineties plunged the Bank of Victoria, a bank can go a
long way in 17 years.

As mentioned last week, this bank, which smashed on a
magnificent scale in 1893, has this half-year presented its
accounts on a different plan ; in fact, it has done very
like what for years past The Bulletin has been doing in
the course of its post-mortem, examination. In 1893 the
bank handed over its wreckage to an Assets Trust, and
made itself responsible for the latter’s debts, represented
by deposit receipts. The bank now shows on the one
side its own capital less the Trust’s estimated deficiency ;
on the other side, the Trust’s assets at valuation. This
allows the old comparison to be continued as follows :
Dec., ’Ol. June, ’OB. Dec., ’OB.
Liabilities of Trust .. £3,334,903 £2,382,172 £2,256,508
Assets of Trust .. 1,800,000 995,000 870,000
Deficit of Trust .. £1,534,903 £1,387,172 £1,386,508
Less Bank Reserves.. 27,619 282,661 306,118
Net Deficit .. ..£1,507,284 £1,104,511 £1,080,390
So we get this :
Capital.—Preference .. £2,117,350
Ordinary .. 95,544
£2,212,894
Net deficit .. 1,080,390
Capital intact .. .. .. £1,132,504
The pref. shares (£10) are limited to 4 per cent., and now
carry 3 per cent. ; the intact capital is, therefore, equal
to £5 7s. per pref. share. In other words, the deficit
still to be made good represents all the ordinary capital
and £4 13s. per share of the pref. capital. The directors
do not, however, propose to write this off; instead, they
intend to fill up the huge cavern hy pouring profits into
it; and, going on past records, they reckon that by 1916,
when the old deposits will be due for payment, another
£400,000 will have been available. This will reduce the
shortage to less than £700,000: and possibly something
may also be got for the assets in excess of the present
valuation.
Seven years ago the directors issued a circular
giving their reasons for not writing off more capital:
“Time is an important element in the settlement. To
provide in 1902 for a liability which is due in 1916 [when
the last of the old deposits fall due] would be to ignore
this element; and to do so at the expense of the Pref.
shareholders, who were originally creditors, would be
inequitable and open to grave objection. It would also
be unjust to the Ordinary shareholders who have paid up
their calls, and whose interest in the bank would be swept
away.” So the directors decide (l)tokeepsome fictitious
figures in the balance-sheet; (2) to keep on drawing
attention to the fact that they are fictitious, and keep on
advertising the old smash ; and (3) presumably to pay no
dividend whatever on ordinary shares and only a
poor 3 per cent, (with a possible 4 per cent, later
on) on pref. shares. It is no doubt out of considera-
tion for the shareholders that they have come
to the decision just announced ; but they will never do
the business which they ought to do, and they never will
be able to earn the profits for shareholders which they
ought to earn, by persisting in this policy. In banking
(which is largely a matter of trust) nothing succeeds like
success ; and, by refraining from having a clean-up, this
bank every half-year is going to recall past failure, and
the low rate of dividend won’t suggest present success.
Yet the C. B. of A. has fine possibilities ; and
in spite of its handicap, its recent progress has been
excellent:—

The “ aid to Trust ” is presumably the amount by which
the Trust has not been able to earn interest on its capital
(the old deposits) after paying expenses. The shortage is
diminishing ; but it diminishes slowly. The Trust’s debt
is £2,256,508. At 3 per cent, that calls for £67,680 a year.
The assets are valued at £870,000. If they returned only
4 per cent, net on that they would bring in £34,800 a
year, leaving £32,880 to be made up by the bank. The
fact that over £50,000 a year is paid to the Trust, there-
fore, signifies either that the Trust’s assets are not earning
4 per cent, net on the valuation, or that the whole of the
amount paid by the bank to the Trust is not required to
pay interest, but that some is being used for writing-
down purposes. An explanation on this point is very
desirable.
In the past 12 months things in the bank (as
separate from the Trust) have moved like this :

The position as to liquid assets, already strong, has been
strengthened; the bank’s liabilities (apart from the
Trust’s) are £4,725,148, and no less than 51 per cent, of
that is kept in liquid form. Further, the debt represents
only £3 18s. for every £1 of the capital intact. The
Trust’s debt ranks as a liability after the deposits and all
other liabilities of the bank ; so, from the depositors’
point of view, the bank’s position is uncommonly strong 1 .

After 15 years the management is still trembling on the
brink ; yet there are signs that it has now plucked up
almost enough courage to plunge in. Six months ago the
chairman said that “ the directors had had under con-
sideration a proposal which they hoped would be unani-
mously accepted, because it would be for the benefit of
all concerned.” This time the chairman gets no forrarder ;
he merely recalls that he made that remark six months
ago, adding to it a reference to the fine outlook for Aus-
tralian banking. The object of the last perfectly sound
remark is fairly obvious. The position is that there are
155,790 live shares of £3 10s., paid now generally to £1
per share. Deducting the few calls in arrears, the share-
holders’paid capital is £154,570. The old depositors’ in-
terest in the concern is, however, represented by £797,755
of inscribed deposit stock and £2,953,218 of fixed deposits
of the “B ” series (the “A ” series has been repaid). The
“ B ” deposits are repayable in two instalments, in 1912
and 1917. If the bank is to continue in business it must
have more capital; and the most obvious way to raise
capital is to convert some of the old deposits into prefer-
ence shares, as was done with the Commercial of Aus-
tralia and other banks 15 years ago. Hence, no doubt,
the suggestion regarding the excellent outlook for Aus-
tralian banking, and the good thing in store for old
depositors if they agree to the conversion. One trouble,
no doubt, is with regard to the present share capital,
called and uncalled. How much of this ought to be
written off? Theoretically, so long as any share capital
remains, every creditor ought to be paid in full ; and
unless a re-valuation of the assets gives wholly unexpected
results, it looks impossible for the old depositors to get £
for £. If they get a share in the business, they will
no doubt have to put up with some writing down of
principal. In fact, it seems pretty certain that they will
have to put up with that in any case. If, however, they
make enough sacrifice to re-establish the bank, they wiil
get the advantage of the business connection, which is still
valuable, and they will alsofind a use for assets—bank pre-
mises, etc.—which would otherwise in many cases be
worth very little. It may be accepted, then, as certain
that it will pay the old depositors to make some sacrifice
of principal ; the thing that will need careful handling
relates to the amount of interest which the present share-
holders will be permitted to keep hold of. Something
more definite can be said about that when the assets have
been revalued and the results made known.
Since General Manager Stewart took charge,
the old and the new business has been distinguished ; and
the figures show, not only how well worth saving the
business is, but how it is extending

It is cheerful to know that £111,471 of old advances have
been realised without drawing upon the visible reserves ;
in fact, there have been larger additions to these reserves
lately than for many years past. Possibly some of the
loss, if any, on the sales has been made good out of the
purchase of old deposits at a discount (they are worth
about 11s. in the market). Down to the end of 1903 the
profit made on the repurchase of old deposits used to be
shown ; since then this profit has been treated as an in-
ternal reserve. Since Dec., 1903, this progress has been
made :

Total £4,698,626 £3,750,973 Dec. £947,653
What amount of old advances has been got rid of in the
same period there is no way of ascertaining ; but, though
portion of the old deposits in 1903 were the higher-
priced “ A ” series, still there has been a large reduction
of the other debt, and from the discounts thus earned
probably a good-sized contingency fund has been built
up. The new advances total nearly 2£ millions, which will
be a fine start for the new bank when the long-delayed
cleaning-up takes place. And it is quite possible that
some of the old advances are by no means to be despised
either ; for Australia in 1909 isn’t what Australia was in,
say, 1895, thanks to Federation, Protection, the establish-
ment of new industries, and the increase of settlement,
which is largely due to the fear of a graduated land-tax in
the future.

This bank has had bad luck or something. Even some of
the things that have looked like good luck have turned
out otherwise. It looked like good luck when the bank
didn’t have to reconstruct, baclj in the early ’nineties;
and yet, as things turn out, it would no doubt have been
a good deal better off if it had done what wouldn’t have
attracted much attention then, being the season’s
fashion. However, it missed the opportunity to have a
general cleaning-up, and it has been oppressed ever since
with a lot of dead weight in the shape of depreciated
securities. Yet how much dead weight it has there is no
way of telling. Instead of filling up the hole at one opera-
tion, it has been emptying in undisclosed profits;
and the public has never been given an idea
of the size either of the hole or of the profits.
The consequence is that the investing public has
been suspicious, so that shares which, 10 years ago, stood
at 82s. 6d. (old) and 725. 6d. (new), have' been sold, this
month, at 575. 6d. and 50s.—a very bad record, consider-
ing the movements there have been in other banks’ stock.
And when the investor stands off a bank’s shares, the
public is apt to stand off it for general business purposes,
passing it by when there is anything good to offer, and
rushing it when it has some business about which it
doesn’t think the prosperous, vigorous concern would be
at all enthusiastic. It is a shockingly heavy price to pay
for not having kept in the fashion and had a reconstruc-
tion and a cleaning-up when those things were almost too
usual to call for comment.
Lately, no doubt, there have been special
troubles, chiefly on account of the Farmers and Settlers'
Co-op. Society—which wasn’t co-operative to any extent
worth mentioning’. This illustrates what was said just
now; it was business which somehow got to the City
Bank after it had been waved past one or two other
doors. Somebody asked at the meeting whether the loss
will amount to £40,000, supposing the appeals go against
the bank. In reply, the idea is understood to have been
conveyed that the loss might be half £40,000, but that
the internal reserves will suffice to make the loss good.
Doubtless it was for this reason that the div. was paid as
usual—the city had had doubts about it for some time.
This is satisfactory as far as it goes ; stilTwhen a bank
which only professes to have reserves of £12,500 and an
undivided balance of £1993, can make good a loss of
£20,000 or £30,000 out of reserves which are not shown at
all, then the public can be forgiven for refusing to take
the balance-sheet very seriously. In fact, it is simplv
this doubt and uncertainty which handicaps the bank.
The majority of the public during business hours has no
time for riddles or missing-word competitions.
At 575. 6d. and 50s. for the shares, the paid
capital has been written down by the market from
£400,000 to £136,250. (The shares are paid to £B. On
30,000 there is a liability of £lO, and on 20,000 an addi-
tional liability of £2. The latter liability accounts for the
lower quotation for the “ new ’’ shares.) Thus the market
has written off all the reserves and £263,750 of capital.
Things may not be as bad as that; judging by the way
both the bank and the shares are recommended (directly
and indirectly) in certain responsible quarters, things
certainly should not be as bad as that. But nothing but
full publicity will get over the suspicion, which has been
born of the long delay in taking the public or even the
shareholders into the management’s confidence. Recent
movements have been as follows

The liabilities are £1,325,922 ; the liquid assets on Dec.
31 were £290,073, or about 22 per cent, of the liabilities,
which isn’t too strong a proportion. Yet, owing to the
heavy proportion of fixed deposits, 22 per cent, is better
than it would be in some banks. Assuming that £7030,
as shown by the published accounts, is the fair profit for
the half-year, then that return is at the rate of £3 Bs.
per cent, per annum on capital and reserves combined—
a figure which suggests either that the profit was larger,
or that much of the capital has been lost. Or it may be
some of both.

This co. was in the thick of the Melbourne boom. It
borrowed mainly on debentures from J. Bull and Alex-
ander McßuU. When it wanted money it raised £lOO by
issuing 100 more £5 shares paid up to £l, and then bor-
rowed £4OO on the security of the uncalled £4 per share.
By the beginning of 1893 it had a paid capital of £250,000,
an uncalled capital of £1,000,000, and a debenture debt
of £994,764, so that the shareholders had put their necks
in the noose up to within about £5OOO of the possible.
When these figures were presented a 10 per cent. div. was
declared, and the chairman said he was proud to know
that the bank had stuck to a legitimate business. Things
began to break shortly after that; and the fracture of
the Land Mortgage Bank was worse than the average. To
make up the appalling difference between what the co.
had lent on land and what it could get for the assets
as it sold them, calls were made. But many
people couldn’t keep going; so to-day only 146,215
shares are alive, and only 30s. remains uncalled on them.
When the last call was made, in March, 1907, it was de-
cided to give the weary shareholders five years in which
to pay up ; so £23,808 is still due on that call. If a share-
holder can pay up in advance he gets a discount. £5lO
was charged against profits last half-year on this account.
As calls have been made the capital has been written
down ; nominally the 146,215 shares that remain are
now of £2 10s., paid to £l. Thus in all £2 10s. has been
called up and then been wiped out to equalise losses on the
other side. As properties are sold and calls are got in,
the debenture-holders are paid off. The next list shows,
among other things, what has been done in that way
lately :

At one time the debentures could be bought up cheap ;
in 1904 they were down to 86J per cent. But they have
kept close to par lately, so not much profit can be made
by repurchase, and nowadays they have to be redeemed
by ballot. At the last writing-down a contingency
fund was formed out of the wreck of the reserves:
and the excess realised over the written-down value is
added to this fund, and shown in the first table above as
“profit on sales.” If the record of the last two years is
any criterion, and if the sales on time-payment pan out
all right, then obviously there is still £120,000-odd of
capital intact. Unfortunately, there is too much ex-
pensive debenture debt on one side and still too much
unproductive assets on the other side to think of a divi-
dend until the reserve fund has been made much stronger
than it is. The bank also pledged itself to the deben-
ture-holders in 1906-7 to call up another 10s. per share ;
the first of these calls is referred to above.

While things are on the bubble at Broken Hill these
accounts would be more interesting if they came down
later than June 30; but the figures have to be first col-
lected in Australia, and then sent to J. Bull; and, after
J. Bull has perused them in a leisurely fashion, they have
to come back to Australia before we can get a look at
them. Still it is admitted that matters have improved
lately. It cost £7 6s. Id. to produce a ton
of lead concentrates in the first half of the year,
only £5 16s. 6d. to do it in the second half, and
£5 6s. lid. in the 20 weeks subsequently. In the same
way the cost of zinc concentrates has been cut down from
£1 ss. lOd. to 19s. 2d. Much of the Corporation’s plant
is new, and 18 months ago the co. was just feeling its way

with it; as things were adjusted, costs fell. Also Manager
Hebbard alleges that, owing to the fall in metals and the
heavy reduction of hands at the Hill, it became possible
to replace poor workmen with good ones. Apart from
zinc tailings and purchased ore, the co. in the previous
year treated 75,800 tons ore; the gross profit was
therefore £llos. lid. per ton. For the past year, when
191,594 tons were treated, the gross profit was 4s. 2d. per
ton. From that in both cases has to be written off an
allowance for depreciation. In the previous year the
amount was very large owing to movements under-
ground having rendered most of the old mill plant
valueless. It is not, however, much use calcu-
lating what this co. earns per ton of ore mined
because it does so much work besides. Thus not only
did it treat the whole of the 191,594 tons for both silver-
lead and zinc, but it treated 124,408 tons of old tailings
to get a zinc product, and it also treated a quantity of
purchased ore (exact quantity unstated, but apparently
in excess of 40,000 tons) at the Cockle Creek smelting
works.
The interesting question is : What profit is the
co. making now? The Sulphide Corporation was one of
the cos. that agreed to go on paying the men the old rate
of wages, which the B. H. Prop, says it can’t afford.
What is this co.’s position ? In the past year it pro-
duced from the new mill 33,674 tons concen-
trates. The average cost works out at £6 9s. 9d.
per ton. For the 20 weeks after the year closed the
average cost was £5 6s. lid. Therefore had the co. worked
at the lower rate last year the profit from this branch
alone would have been £l2s. lOd. per ton of concentrates,
or altogether £38,751, more. Then there is the output of
zinc concentrates. A saving of ss. 2d. per ton in costs has
been made, equal to about £14,150 more. On the working of
the old tailings there has been a saving of about 4s. Bd.
per ton on last year’s average, or £10,312 on the output
of 44,197 tons from that plant. Thus, had the costs for
the year been only as much as they are shown to have
been for'the 20 weeks from July 1 to November 14, they
would have been £63,213 less; which is to say.that the
profits for the year would have been that much
more. Nor has there been any falling off in
the quality of the work. As against 42 - 5 per
cent.. of the silver and 66’8 per cent, of the lead
recovered in the lead concentrates at the new mill in the
first half of the year, 47"2 per cent, of the silver and 76 - 0
per cent, of the lead have been recovered in the past 20
weeks ; and the recoveries in the zinc concentrates have
gone up from 61-8 per cent, to 85‘0 per cent. Why the
Sulphide Corporation agreed to continue work on the old
rates is therefore quite obvious. It is equally obvious
that it is most misleading to judge what the B. H. Prop,
is capable of paying on the figures for the half-year to
May, 1908—the last which the B. H. Prop, has issued, and
which have lately been much quoted.
• * * #
So far the only Broken Hill mines which are
closed down owing to the lockout, or whatever it is, are
the B. H. Prop, and its neighbor, Block 10. The British
and Block 14 are almost at a standstill; but it isn’t called
a lockout in their case—they have simply knocked off
work because it doesn’t pay them to keep on at it. The
South Blocks Co. has a contract with the B. H. Prop.,
but while the B. H. Prop, works are closed down it is
tipping its concentrates into the bins ; the Sulphide Cor-
poration has works of its own ; and the others are either
storing, or selling to other buyers. Meantime people
who remember how closely the Broken Hill cos. used to
stick together are amazed at the majority of the cos.
keeping at work, though they know that their men
are mostly paying ss. a week towards the keep of the
other men who are struggling with the B. H. Prop,
and Block 10. Things, however, are not what they used
to be. The B. H. Prop, did nothing to make itself popu-
lar with its mates. There was a time when no dog was
expected to bark when the B. H. Prop, opened its mouth.
The arrangement fixed up a bit over two years ago, by
which the advance of 12£ per cent, was granted, was the
B. H. Prop.’s arrangement. Some of the others didn’t
like it, especially as it was pretty well understood that it
was more than the men would have accepted ; but the
others didn’t count. Now the B. H. Prop, isn’t quite so
happily situated as it was ) and the others are just letting
it stew in its own gravy—it and its faithful ally, Block 10.

Great Cobar (N. S. W. ) has been down on its luck
lately, and the furnaces have been running matte of lower
grade than usual. Magnesite bricks are to be imported to
withstand the great heat, and this is another indication
of trouble with the furnaces. These latter are of a
Yankee pattern ; ’ wherefore an American metallurgist,
Herman Bellinger, of Ohio, is being brought out to take
charge. His first job will be to demonstrate, if he can,
that the Cobar ore isn’t too heavy for this type of fur-
nace. The aim is to get a fair grade matte at a single
fusion, and to leave a tolerably clean slag. A glance at
the Chesney ore shows how silicious it is, and there is
a strong suspicion that sections of the big mine contain
more silica and zinc blende than the management likes
the public to believe. Metal recoveries have been low,
and on a2£ per cent, basis it takes 40 tons of ore to pro-
duce a ton of copper, which contains about £l3 or £l4
worth of gold and silver. At present prices Great Cobar
doesn’t extract anything like £2 worth of metals per ton
of ore, and everything has to be run on a very economical
basis, or profits drop out of sight. Two objects are
aimed at in blending the silicious ore from the Chesney
with the low-grade basic stuff out of the big mine—one is
to comply with a smelting formula, and secure a mixture
that will flux easily; the other is to secure an average
extraction of about 2J per cent, copper. But the latter
object is necessarily subordinate to the former, and it
is the endeavor to secure both objectives that causes
trouble.

Mount Boppy Copper mine, one of the best of
the outside shows in the Cobar district (N.S.W.), has got
into financial difficulties, out of which calls haven’t been
able tc lift it; and it looks as though there will have to
be either an auction sale or a reconstruction. For a good
while a small quantity of rich ore was hand-picked and
sent away ; hut Mt. Boppy is essentially a concentrating
proposition, and so far the co. hasn’t been successful in
its concentrating work. Besides copper values there is
close-up ldwt. of gold in the ore. Capital will, however,
have to be got in ; the want of enough of it has been a
handicap all along. “ With a fair amount expended on
this mine,” Mines-inspector Polkinghorne reported 12
months ago, “ I think it should prove to be a payable one
at an early date.” But the capital wasn’t forthcoming,
so the bank shut down, and work had to be stopped;
and the mine will how first have to be unwatered.
* * * *
Grafton copper mine (N.S.W.) looked a big
thing to theboomsters in 1907 ; but it got down closer to
average conditions in 1908, and then there was a great
shrivelling. In 1907 the profit and loss account showed a
profit of £14,252, out of which £ll,OOO was paid in divi-
dends. Last year, though much less development work
was done, the co. was only £4553 on the right side, and
no dividend was declared at all. On the contrary, £505
was paid as interest on overdraft, etc. Further, £2530
spent on plant and £1127 on road-making during the
year has been charged to capital, and not to working ex-
penses ; and nothing appears to have been written off to
cover depreciation. Twelve months ago the sur-
plus of liquid assets over liabilities was £1615;
now, in spite of the profit of £4553, and in
spite of the fact that no dividend has been paid mean-
time, the surplus is only £2724. So far as cash and liquid
resources go, the co. is therefore only £llO9 to the good
on the year’s operations. At the end of the year 207 tons
of matte (presumably about 40 per cent.) remained on
hand ; and it is not mentioned at what price this is taken
into account. Manager Mulligan reports that the year’s
output was 4885 tons ore, producing 1311 tons matte,
containing 513 tons copper, 2490 z. gold, and 39940 z.
silver. Even allowing that the profit was £4553 (though,
as mentioned above, nothing appears to have been
written off that for depreciation, while even road-
making was not charged up to expenses), the pro-
fit was only £8 17s. 6d. per ton of copper; so the
working expenses were high, particularly as the ore
averaged nearly 11 per cent. The manager estimates that
he has reserves of 24,554 tons “ similar to that treated,”
besides seconds and thirds ; but, unless copper jumps
considerably, something severe will have to be done in
the way of cutting down costs before the seconds and
thirds are of any value ; and, from all accounts, it isn’t
high wages that give the co. any trouble. As to the
reserves, the manager’s estimate may be well within the
mark. If it is, the Grafton, which was at one time
talked of as a second Mt. Morgan, is still only a small
show. As a matter of fact, however, owing to the irregu-
lar nature of the ore occurrences, it is exceedingly diffi-
cult to make a true estimate of reserves.

Kyloe, a copper mine in Monaro (N.S.W)., is
owned by a co. which was floated in Sydney and
Adelaide; the office and directors are in S. Aus.
Gradually, as the outlook has improved, shares have been
mopped up by Sydney ; and arrangements are now just
about completed for the transfer of the office to Sydney.
The course to be adopted will be the registration of a
nominally-new co. and the winding-up of the old one.
Above the 200 ft. level there are probably 10,000 tons of
ore, of from four up to as much as 20 per cent. ; the rich
ore is the core of a lens. At 300 ft. apparently the same
body has been found ; so there are good prospects
between the two levels—much better than the mine
offered until lately. There is a small furnace on the
mine ; but it will probably be scrapped, and a mill put
up to reduce the poorer ore, and the whole product will
be sent away from the mine ; the new works at Kembla
will take most of it.

Lionel Robinson and a few kindred spirits in
London have got hold of the Kalgoorlie Amalgamated,
and are now floating it into a new co. of 400,000 4s.
shares. The old co. gets £4OOO and 120,000 paid-up
shares as its whack, but out of this the promoters receive
£5OO and 15,000 shares for their trouble. 100,000 shares
are offered to the public at 25., with calls when required ;
and, as an inducement to come in, 80 fully paid shares
are given as a bonus for every 100 taken up. This
accounts for 300,000 shares. The remaining 100,000 are
to be kept in reserve. The property, which is of big area,
includes the old Block 45 and Croesus; but its chief
speculative value lies in the fact that it is next-door
neighbor on three sides to the Golden Links’ Eclipse lease.

Hooper and Speak, of London, have secured
the management of the Boulder Perseverance (W.A.),
and have induced Ernest Williams, who once bossed
8., M. and Co.’s business in the West, to return to Kal-
goorlie as resident partner. The manager’s billet has
been offered to the youthful Hogan Taylor, who has had
charge since Borrowes’ departure in July last, but Taylor
has pluckily elected to tackle the Lancefield for 8., M.
and Co. instead.
Boreholes don’t always go the way they’re
wanted to. About five years ago one was put down
1500 ft. from the surface of the Central Boulder ; and, as
some rich seams of telluride were said to have been struck
near the end of the bore, shareholders, then on the verge
of despondency, bucked up a bit. Shortly afterwards,
however, they were knocked out by the announcement
that the drill had deflected, and that the Oroya South,
and not the Central Boulder, had the values. Some time
last year the vagrant hole was picked up at the 7th and
9th levels of the Oroya block, and subsequently the Kal-
goorlie Mint, which lies still further east of the Central
Boulder, was quietly collared for next to nothing by the
Oroya-Brown Hill. Now comes the news that the bore
hole has been struck at 1300 ft. in that property. In order
to test the alleged values, the remainder of the bore hole
(about 70ft.) is now being sunk on, though not without
some misgivings.

A few lucky persons still do well out of the
White Feather Main Reefs (W.A.), but the end is not far
off. Last year’s income, made up of royalties and rent,
ran out at £631; but £1319 went in local expenses and
£lO6B in directors’ fees, London office upkeep, etc., so
that the co. had to reduce its fast disappearing bank
balance by £1756 to square things. The co. is now on
its uppers', and at the annual meeting held in London,
the other day, the chairman reckoned that the only hope
left was to trust in Providence, and pray that the tribu-
tors would find something. The eight shareholders ex-
clusive of the six directors who attended the gathering
thought otherwise, however, and carried a motion for
adjournment against the members of the board, where-
upon the latter flourished a bundle of proxies, and the
eight shareholders then left the room in disgust. The
rest of the business was transacted by the directors, who
adopted their own report and elected some auditors.

Golden Ridge’s capacity for paying dividends
has been getting a little limelight in the West. Last
year £23,947 (about 75 per cent, of the nominal capital)
found its way into shareholders’ pockets, and even richer
distributions are hinted at for this year. Despite this,
however, few people have any time for the stock, and the
fact that shares are almost as hard to get rid of as a
broken window pane doesn’t improve matters.

Murchison Associated (W.A.) is run by a
resourceful lot. Latest report, which dates from the
last reconstruction and deals with the Day Dawn pro-
perty and other delusions, is, like its predecessors, chock
full of promises and visions. The diamond drill, lent free
of charge by the benevolent Moore Government, failed to
reveal anything of practical value ; but that fact is made
light of, and shareholders are buoyed up with the plau-
sible assertion that “ boring is not an exhaustive and con-
clusive test.” True ; but as every other test applied to
the property has met with the same fate, this argument
is as hollow as a drum. The co. now’ relies on some
dredging proposition near Cape Horn to pull it out of the
mud : but its chances of rescue are not good.
* * * *
Associated Northern still has the Harbor
Lights, at Leonora (W.A.), in tow ; but, until the work
in hand is finished, it refuses to tell how developments
are shaping. Some of the boreholes are alleged tohave
struck something, but the nature of that something is
being kept a close secret. The fact, however, of the show
having previously been turned down by option-holders
doesn’t augur well for it going off this season.

The report for the year ended June last, which
has just wandered out from England, shows that Phillips
River (W. A.) went back a bit during that term. After
being debited with £8791 depreciation, £1548 London
office expenses, and £625 income tax reserve, the ac-
counts show a debit balance of £19,641, reducing the
credit balance brought in to £26,569, which is carried for-
ward. Prior to the smelters closing down in September
of the previous year, 5629 tons of ore and 830 tons of old
slag were treated for 417 tons copper, 23810 z. gold, and
39610 z. silver.
Break o’ Day, a recent Norseman (W.A.) flota-
tion, is being asked after in the West. The co. started
with very little cash, and has to rely upon calls to keep
going. It may have prospects, but is in danger of being
choked through want of funds before this point can be
determined.

The accounts of Star of the East, Sebastopol
(Vic.), show how nicely even a no-liability show in Bal-
larat can get into the good books of a bank :
Due bank, old account .. .. £9705
No. 2 account 3367
Unpresented cheques 1176
£14,248
Less credit at bank, new account .. 689
Net total £13,559
That £13,559 of debt stands as a wall between share-
holders and divs. Income for the last half-year was £2500,
expenses £4900, shortage £2400. Still the dead weight of
£13,550 does not press heavily on the directors. They
chirrup out that, owing to the discovery of the Albion
lode beyond the slide, “ the prospects of the mine are far
more encouraging than for many years past.” In such a
case as this the best thing a wearied public can do is to
sharpen its best hatchet and set out after the man who
talks more prospects. The last div. for the co. came from
’Enery Edwards’ mineral reef six years ago, About all
that is left of it is the sparkle of the diamond ring which
Edwards got from a grateful crowd. The co. should try
the same old mascotte again.

A “slim ” crowd wants Prof. Nanson and party,
of the Burnt Creek, Maryborough (Vic.), to crack ahead
faster. The Professor is not a mining man, and is more
concerned over the proportional vote and the set of his
spats than he is about catching sprats on a dull market.
So he sits tight and pays calls. True, the mine is drain-
ing, but the market is rocking. And yet Nanson, un-
wittingly perhaps, is doing right. Opening drives are
proving nearly oz. dirt, and when the gutter drains and
the mine is opened, then it will be time to pitch in
panellers.

Lord Nelson, St. Arnaud (Vic.), was to have been
on the wrong side of Styx long ere this, and the North
was to have been in possession, but seemingly it takes
as long to kill the old show as it has taken for the North
to get on to the Nelson shoot. The worst feature is that
Manager Nichol says that values at the 1930 ft. level are
disappointing, and that portions of the reef overhead are
too poor to stope. This dwindling of values has been per-
sistent for the last level or two, so there isn’t any call to
make a song about any other show on the field until
better stone turns up. Lord Nelson directors expect the
quartz above 1930 ft. level to make better. That is not
the same as the gold making down. Until that happens
the deduction is that the Nelson proves what other mines
have found, that gold peters with depth. Meanwhile the
scraping .together of gold stone in the upper levels can be
heard nearly as far away as the shire hall.

Speckers have ceased to worry South German,
and Maldon (Vic.) is content. For every 20s. won out of
the old mine 10s. has gone to shareholders, and it came
hard to believe that the fault nipped the gold out com-
pletely on the Deep lease boundary. But below the fault
the gold is patchy. Even though stone goes lldwt., only
Is. flows back in the half-year to shareholders. At 2000 ft.
the shoot of stone is 400 ft. long and 7Aft. wide in parts,
but with a lot of mullock and poor quartz there is little
profit to play with.

The Queensland Copper Co. is the English con-
cern which owns Mt. Perry—for its size the best and
most consistent copper mine in the State. Its year
ended on July 31. For the last term £9130 profit was
made on working account; but against that there was
£8739 to write off for development previously charged to
capital account ; and a further £4183 for depreciation
turns the profit into a loss of £3792. Further writing-off
is recommended ; so altogether the £26,945 brought for-
ward from the previous year is reduced to £18,840. There
are 80,000 cumulative pref. (6 per cent.) shares and about
140,000 ordinaries. The pref. shares rank for dividend
with ordinaries after the latter have also got 6 per cent. ;
but hitherto, though the pref. people have had their 6
per cent., they have never got any more.

New Brilliant Freehold continues to hold its
end up in the sharemarket with more success than most
other Charters Towers mines. No. 7 level is out 717 ft.,
and has been following 6in. of rubbly stone with fair
mineral contents. A slight improvement in this direc-
tion, and a leader passed through in sinking the main
shaft, account for the market firmness. A diorite bar
crosses the shaft diagonally about 260 ft. below the
Brilliant formation, and the mineral leader referred to
makes larger and carries more mineral on the western
side of the shaft near the bar. There is some speculation
as to whether this is the Day Dawn hanging-wall reef.
No. 8 level on the main Day Dawn reef continues on pay-
able stone at 313 ft., and is especially interesting because
it is the deepest level on the N. B. Freehold lease. The
hanging-wall section of the Day Dawn continues to
develop fairly well, and stoping over Nos. 6 and 7 is pro-
viding some good stone for the battery. East Mexicans
are neglected ; the small lot of stone from No. 5 was not
payable, and the prospect of having calls to pay has
frightened contributing shareholders.

that does load the same Brown, obviously the latter
should pay the bigger bonus. Therefore the co. that

Capt. “ Teddy ” Miles’s Tongkah tm venture, in
Siam or thereabouts, sent along a refreshing wire as a New
Year cake for the Tasmanian shareholders. (The office is
in Tasmania, where the co. was formed.) Working only
18 days in Dec., the dredge, which is scooping up the
Tongkah Harbor bottom, won 30£tons of tm—apparently
black tin, worth 74 per cent. Up to date 1,200,000 cubic
yds. have averaged 21b. to the 3 T ard, and that is better
than the estimates. As mentioned when the co. s ac-
counts were overhauled a few weeks ago, there are only
three things which cloud an otherwise beautiful out-
look—management expenses are high; there is the
probability of trouble from clay ; and the future of tin is
very uncertain. The tin market is, in fact, apparently
weakening now, judging by the slack quotations for for-
ward delivery.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

South Melbourne, who have this work in hand. These
engines are the heaviest and largest traction engines in
the Commonwealth. They are fitted with vertical water-
tube-boilers, built on the modem sectional method for a
pressure of 2001 b., and capable of developing 100-h.p.
The wheels are chain driven, and are each 7ft. in diameter

“ Cicfc” learns new things anent frogs : I
was, up to and until the last day of rest as ever
was, under the delusion that dampness was abso-
lutely necessary to the several breeds of frog.
But on the above-quoted day, I stumbled on
three fat brown members of the species, who.
though far from moisture of any description, were
none the less lively. If proof were needed of
their energy their frantically vivacious leave-
taking of me supplied it. ’Twas on the summit
of a bare brown hill that I unearthed them. The
Riverina thermometer halted at 103° in the back
verandah, and the nearest water simmered at the
toot ot a hill just five furlongs distant. A slab of
granite formed the frogs’ gunyah, and the atmo-
sphere was apparently their sole source of susten-
ance. It hadn’t rained for three weeks. Yet

they presented all the frownless, gay, and clammv
aspect of their relatives who dwell in pools and
surface tanks. Since then, in various discussions
anent the croakers, I have learnt that the green
variety of them are also wont to wander long dis-
tances from water hereabouts. They invariably
ambte back to wetness, however, when the spirit
moves them to deposit their spawn. This feat—
I refer to the discovery of the water, and not to
the spawning—is worthy of profound remark
inasmuch as the local liquid is stored in tanks’
which are scattered promiscuously over the maD
at irregular intervals. Yerily, the squat, beady-
eyed hoppers know things.
Snakebite : “The Dodger” says, in

him a liar, but what he says is all bunkum, so he
is a bunkumer. I was fencing up north of Port
Augusta in the early ’nineties and again in 1903.
odger is quite accurate in his facts with
regard to some insect spinning a silken web on
the bushes, and tne contents thereof turning into
grubs. But as this thing takes place, year after
year, be it wet or dry, I quite fail to see how it
can he a sign of any coming weather. Of course,
it is a proof that there will be weather ; but then

is always weather immediately after a coal-

you know about a bunch of seaweed hung up in-
side the house ; when the seaweed becomes moist
and soft, rain has got a good outside chance. It
must be the brown algse seaweed. The water-
bottle and the jar make a popular weather-tipping
instrument. Fill a jar half full of water; then
invert the water bottle into the jar, allowing the
mouth of the bottle to dip below the water. The
rise or fall of the water in the neck will indicate a
thirsty or damp kind of weather. Another : Put
a frog in a big glass jar half filled with water.
Cover over with a bit of cloth gauze. Leave a
pronged piece of wood in the jar. When the frog
remains out of water things are going to be hot.
When he bobs underneath look out for squalls.
Next: Tie a piece of ordinary catgut between two

“Kola”: One of the chief troubles of
the bush-worker who is camped out is the raids
made upon his tucker-box by all sorts of travellers.
The worker often has to be out of sight of his
camp all day; and when he gets home at sun-
down, tired and hungry, he feels annoyed when
he finds his lump of cooked corned-beef gone, and
the last bit of brownie departed with it. So, in
desperation, the camper pins up threatening
notices, and uses drastic methods to protect his
commissariat. One day I and another drover
were travelling light, to take over some sheep,
and accidentally found ourselves without tucker
at midday, and with no chance of any till late at
night. Then we struck a rabbiters’ camp of three
tents. There was no one at home, or in sight;
but this truculent warning was tacked to a tree : *
SPECIAL NOTICE.
Anyone interfering in any way with these tents or
their contents will be severely kicked by the under-

Lach man had signed his name in a firm manner
that showed he was in earnest. But we were
hungry. So we broached the tucker-boxes, in a
reasonable way, and had a fair feed and a drink
of tea, one watching while the other ate. Then
we passed on, unkicked.

According to G-. F. Bennett, of Northgate
(Q.), his father, Dr. George Bennett, was the first
to observe the habits of the platypus, which he
saw for the first time in 1829 when on a visit to
N.S. W. with a scientific party. .He was so inter-
ested in duckbills that he returned to Australia in
1832 to study its habits. The results of his re-
searches were published in the Transactions of the
Zoological Society (1834). He got several full-
grown live specimens, but they soon died in cap-
tivity. On December 28, 1832, however, with the
help of some blacks, he captured a mother platy-
pus and her two young ones. The old lady died
four days after. The young ones were taken to
Sydney, and lived for six or seven weeks. During
that time they were fed upon bread soaked in
water, chopped egg, and finely-minced meat.
Dusk was their feeding-time. At first their liquor
was milk, but as they showed a preference for
water, they were given it instead. They were
captured at Lansdown Park, near Goulburn
(N.S.W.). Dr. Bennett sent many anatomical
specimens to Sir Bichard Owen, which were very
useful to that scientist in determining the fre-
quently-argued question as to whether or not
Mrs. Ornithorhynchus lays eggs.
‘ Silas Snell ” : It is a true story of
Hagan and Ragan. Hagan was the man who
wanted to sell the land to Tom Bent’s Govern-
ment at an immense sacrifice, and Ragan was the
official valuer. Hagan was driving Ragan out to
the magnificent estate, and endeavoring by the
way to discover means of propitiating the respon-
sible person. If he was only certain of Ragan’s
religion he thought he might reckon on winning
his good graces, but he didn’t regard it as safe to
ask straight out. He drove past three churches,
an -i ff aVe guarded praise to each, but Ragan was
mildly appreciative and non-committal. At dinner
Hagan thought to get something definite, for it
was Friday. He lay back, carefully waiting
for the valuer to give his order. Ragan took
soup. Hagan took soup. The next course was
corned beef, cabbage, and potatoes. Ragan set the
meat aside on the edge of his plate, and started
on the vegetables. Now Hagan had his cue.
Landlord !” he yelled. “Here, take this meat
A BUSH SYMPHONY.
away. How dar’ you serve me with meat on a
1* rtday ? ” Ragan said nothing, but composedly
ate his vegetables, and then ate the meat. Hagan
was horribly mortified, and when the valuer’s
decision was given strongly against his hopes he
wrote angrily to the powers, declaring that it was
a bitter bad thing to find sectarian influences
directing matters of public policy. But the true
joke lies in the fact that Hagan is a Wesleyan
and Ragan a Presbyterian. And if Ragan, who
dislikes Roman Catholics, had known that Hagan
was a Wesleyan, things might have been differ-
ent ; also if Hagan hadn’t bellowed about the
meat, Ragan wouldn’t have got the mistaken im-
pression that Hagan was a pursuer of the Scarlet
Woman.

“Itan” : No land for settlement in New
South Wales ? What about the attractive province
lying on the North Coast, between Kyogle and
Acacia Creek ? The State holds a million acres
thereabouts, indefinitely known as forest reserves.
The Lands Department knows as little about this
country as it did about the Dorrigoand Comboyne
before outsiders talked themselves hoarse in advo-
cacy of settlement in those parts. The Depart-
ment has maps, of course, but the only details
available are those provided by surveyors’
scrappy note-books, a perusal of which suggests
that the author must have met a teamster
a long way from the centre point and yarned.
About 100,000 acres of this land are
volcanic, as rich as the Big Scrub, on the Ather-
ton (Q.), to which so many land-hungry men are
undertaking the 1000-mile trip. Much of this
new land is well designed for timber conservation,
but great areas are eminently fitted for the cow-
puncher and the farmer. When the inept folk at
“ the Lands ” discover this sweep of territory they
will probably rush it off, like the profligate young
man who vets his second windfall.
EASY.

“ Dunno yet. But it’s jist er matter of sittin'

“Janor” : I knew the growth of euca-
lypts is remarkably rapid, but until the other day
had no data on which to estimate the haste of the
great Australian vegetable. ‘Was poking about
one of the has-been auriferous creeks of Gippsland
in company with the oldest inhabitant wh'o had
come in with the first rush some 42 years ago.
As we struggled on, the ancient emptied his
stores of memory over me, pointing out the spots
where big nuggets and rich dabs had been gouged
out. At last we came to his old claim, on the
nose of a spur; and, as he piloted me over the
uneven surface, I noticed a huge, dead stringy-
bark tree lying prone. It had fallen with one
root-prong in the soil in such a way that a living,
vigorous tree towered skyward, firmly rooted to its
dead progenitor. Called the old chap’s attention to
this, and he remarked that he “ minded the dead
tree well.” He had grubbed it himself 41 years
ago. The growing tree was, of course, not over
that age. We spanned it 4ft. from the ground,
and found it about 6ft. 6in. in circumference. We
estimated the length of the straight, symmetrical
barrel at 80ft. Timber that grows like that cries
aloud for conservation.
“Dandalup”: Be E. J. Brady’s verse,
entitled “ A Northern Night ” (B. 7/l/’09).
Brady referred (verse three) to “poor
Mimosa San,” who has been “brought
down” from by Mandarin Ah Fan
“to glad the liriart of man,” etc. It isn’t
always Ah Fan and Co. who pursue this
nefarious trade, arid import bunches of Mi-
mosa Sans from .Japan, Singapore, and
elsewhere. In* the early ’nineties, when
the Westralian goldfields broke out, a
well-known resident of that State con-
ceived the brilliant idea of “importing
from Japan.” The first consignment of
about 10 charmers from Geisha Land took
up its abode in the t.own where I resided.
Others were distributed among the other
goldfields centres. Money was plentiful,
business boomed, and soon the “ im-
porter” in question was drawing large
dividends from his little shows. "With
the aid of lucky mining speculations his
banking account soon swelled to bursting
point, and society received him with open
arms, while white damselsgurgled love-
songs what time they reclined at his feet.
Money talks; Society asks no questions.
He is still a prominent citizen of the
Western State, and a leader in the Hupper
Circles. Lately I visited the old town.
All that remains of the first blushing con-
signment are two grizzled, monkey-faced
old hags, who still hang out the same
old sign at the same old galvanised ad-
dress. They’ve become an institution,
but the shanty stands the wean, and tear
best. It isn’t always Ah Fan wherein ports,
I’m very sorry to say !

“ Don Q.” sends a yarn that doesn’t
look so authentic as it might do :
The Northern Territory nigger is an ardent believer in
the Alien Restriction Act. About 12 months back great
heaps of yellow agony were landing at the Roper. Mid-
night arrivals were frequent, and Australia threatened to
be anything but white. The pagans would land and then
march into the scrub and camp. Here the nigs would
meet them. After a lot of “baal," “no savee,” and
“boori,"a deal would be struck. The niggers were to
pilot the heathen to Borroloola (Australia’s only serious
rival of Woolloomooloo) and to receive in return a smoke
or two of opium. Trade was good, and the niggers pros-
pered ; still, there was nary a Chinaman arrived at Bor-
roloola. But' even the best of things must end one day.
Some drovers came upon the main camp of niggers. It
must have been Christmas time at that camp. The
niggers were all in an opium sleep, while the remains of
the last two Chinamen were scattered round. This may
be printed as a cookery item in the ladies’ page.
“ Gr.S.K.” : Be “ Moreover’s ” charge
against my veracity regarding the existence of a
true billabong at Bourke (N.S.W.). I hereby
give “ Moreover ” the lie direct, and again assert
that in the proper season the true billabong may
be found at the place mentioned. When the flood
waters are coming down the Darling then does the
billabong aforesaid exist in its proper form. Owing
to the adverse action of the last 20 years this
billabong has somewhat lost its old shape, but in
flood and semi-flood seasons the aged conditions
prevail. Since writing my original article on this
subject I have had the truth thereof confirmed by
several old hands who, I am sure, are more
confirmed dwellers in those parts than “More-
over ” is.
“ Chink ” : “ Agricola ” (B. 19/11/’08) re-
fers to the numerousness of nesting parrots in
various parts of N.S.W. In certain parts of
Victoria the nests of the smaller parrots (or lories)
are still fairly plentiful, but if many of the larger
species are not looked after, they will soon be as
scarce as moas are in M.L. Foremost among those
requiring protection are the handsome rock
pebble and ring-necked parrots and the Major
Mitchell cockatoo. A few years ago the rock pebble
(or smoker) parrot used to breed in great numbers
around the Hopetoun and Lake Hindmarsh
districts, but the nests were so persistently
robbed that the birds were finally driven further
back to the less-settled districts of Wonga Lake
and Black Flat. There they bred in peace for a
couple of seasons, but now they are being fol-
lowed up again, and so keen are the
nest-robbers—mostly professionals—that the
new nesting-trees have, for the last two
seasons, been hacked and chopped about beyond
all further use. There is little suitable timber
further back, so the next move of the birds will be
across the Murray into N.S.W. The outrageous
nest-raiders know that it is a case of first come
first served, so the nests are frequently robbed
while the young birds are still in the down, with
the result that—on an outside estimate—probably
75 per cent, of the helpless youngsters die.
The rebuke of “ Starfish ” :
“ Moorabinda ” and others have recently been writing
disparagingly about Darling River shipping. Permit me
to push a dissenting paw into the discussion. Built for
a pleasure yacht some years ago, the steamboat Marion
(Captain Hart) was soon afterwards sold into the Darling
River trade. She is a fine fast boat, with good accommo-
dation for passengers, and possesses a splendid set of
powerful engines. During October, 1908, on a medium
to low river, and towing a huge barge (empty), she
travelled from Wentworth to Tolarno Station, a distance
of 420 miles by river, in 59 hours. This was against the
stream, and 'included halts for wood and rounding
of bends. Another fine boat is the Tarella (Captain
Grundy). Writer has seen her whizzing down stream at
quite 10 knots an hour. The Enterprise (Captain New-
man), carrying freight only, is not so big as the Marion,
but she is a glutton for work, and is one of the most
powerful draggers on the river. She sometimes hauls
along two heavily-laden barges, each twice her own size,
and never a wheeze or cough comes from her. Other good
clean boats plying their trade on the Darling, and mostly
fitted with accommodation for passengers, are the Merle,
the Ventura, the Florence Annie, the Emma (hawkers),
and the Murrumbidgee, the William Randell, the Roth-
sprey, and the Tolarno (freight boats). All these steamers
do a regular business when the river is up. The skippers
are all men who hustle and waste no time. The Darling
River shipping trade, with its freight and hawking boats
(not to mention its fishing skiffs), is a thing of no small
importance, and I’d like “Moorabinda” and his friends
to grasp the fact, and stow it away in a portion of their
brain receptacles where it won’t dissolve.
STRAGGLERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m goin’ West, away to the West,
The sunset plains, the great grey sea,
And the Mulga Land, they are callin’ me,
An’ my ship sails in the mornin’.
Fagged out, I tramp down the long drear street,
No space to breathe, and no mate to meet,
But with driven mobs I’d scorn to stay.
Trouble I’ve struck, and I’m old an’ gray,
But at break o’ dawn I’ll be up an’ away,
I’m travellin’ West in the mornin’.
Out in the West, at the sunset’s back,
The junibucks take to the Outer Track.
Though the desert’s breath blow furnace hot
And wasters are torn by scab and rot,
My mates are a mad and merry lot;
Grafters an’ growlers, bent an’ bold ;
Battlers an’ boozers, young an’ old ;
But stragglers all in the rush for gold,
Who take no thought of the mornin’.
Their hearts expand, their pulses throb.
Away from the schemes of th’ city mob ;
Like men they grope for the golden ore,
Drive camel teams from shore to shore,
Prospect gold sands, and battle forth
To best the Japs round the pearlin’ North. . ~
A mirage gleams, and out one goes ;
And nobody cares, for nobody knows.
It’s not a life nor a death for men
To fatten like sheep in a stifling pen.
It’s not a death, and it’s not a life
To wait for the stab of a butcher’s knife.
For this are fat sheep fed and fenced,
And thus is meekness recompensed.
But we find, where rebel stars have birth,
The stragglers spread to the ends of earth.
Out in the wastes of the spacious West
His aches an’ griefs can a man forget,
And small and mean looks the city’s fret,
For a man may rise or a man may fall,
But those silent sands have room for all—
Out in the West, in the desert West,
Boom for the damned, an’ room for the blest.
Aye, those big, bare plains are far the best,
An’ I’ll hump my drum in the mornin’.

JACKEROO'S LOVE SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The first, lone thruppence in the plate of night—
A far, faint moon—lies on the evening blue
As I come down the shed-track, dusty-white,
To dress and dine—and write my love to you !
The scent of yolky wool hangs in my hair,
And, marching with a grey and grimy crew,
I am a prince of filth —but I don’t care !
I’ll clean up soon, and drop a line to you !
This morn I hauled red sheepskins from the fence,
Whence angry crows, with bitter verbiage, flew,
Leaving a fearsome trail of odors dense—
But I’d cart sheepskins every day ... for you !
The sound of pent sheep wavers in the South ;
The early stars go circling through the blue,
And, there 1 The soup-smell and a watering mouth !
Food first—and then, sweet Maud, my love to you 1

STRIKING RECOGNITION.
A MONUMENTAL EXPEBIENCE.
“ What’s this ? ” he exclaimed, stopping abruptly, and gazing interestedly
upon the subject before him. “ A new kind of monument! Surely this is no
unfamiliar shape ! Where, when, and how has it appeared to me before ?
Let me think. Ah, I have it. Yes, of course—the form is that of my old
friend Odol—my night comforter and my morning refresher. But this is a
monument!
Oh, I see, it s a new idea in monuments. They are putting them up
now, I presume, to commemorate present, living, active, beneficent forces as
'well as. to celebrate departed worth. And very sensible too. Now there’s
something in that. It is not only a monument but a guide ; not only a guide
but an object lesson in health. Ah, well, it’s been a good lesson to me. My
teeth were going—Odol saved them. My mouth was invaded by microbes I
don’t know how many million strong—Odol drove them out to the last gasp-
mg, clinging germ. 1 had pains in my gums, pains in my teeth, pains in the
oral orifice generally, and Odol quickly substituted pleasures for those pains
Yes, Odol deserves a monument. I’m a living, walking monument to Odol
myself Odol, I salute you ! Odol, I honour you ! I wonder who put this
up > Perhaps the ladies of the stage, for none know the value of Odol better
than they. Perhaps the Dentists of the United Kingdom, for it is the one
dentifrice that they use themselves. Perhaps—oh, well, here it is. That’s
enough. I haven’t seen such an appealing monument for a long time.”

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Admitting there is a majesty doth
hedge a king, or even a vice-regal per-
sonage, in the same degree that an
aroma of moneyed influence attaches
to a millionaire, it seems unaccountable
that enthusiastic monarchists the
world over neglect the fact that their
idol s majesty is not a fixed family
possession. There are royal-blooded
people in Australia/ who get no rever-
enee whatever. The majesty which
hedged their ancestor, James 11., is
not worth twopence to these distant
relations of his royal nibs. Tor in-
stance, there is Erskine Scott, who
acts as press representative of West’s
Pictures in Melbourne, and some-
times '‘announces” them to the audi-
ence. He’s a bit of a royal Stuart, on
the evidence of his family tree. The
blood of kings is concealed about his
person, but the last of them was chucked
out, and Scott’s branch of the family
has lost all social c onnection with the
Unnatural Anthem. Yet it is a branch
specially remarkable for its toughness.
The ancestry of Erskine Scott was
regal in longevity. His father lived
to be 88 only, but his grandmother on
the Stuart side lasted 95 years; one of
his aunts ‘talked of Bonnie Prince
Charlie until she was 94 (her sister is
flourishing at the early age of 85) ; and
his cousin, Mrs. Christian Drummond,
is one of Sydney’s oldest inhabitants.
This Mrs. Drummond, widow of the
Rector of the High School at Dalkeith
(Scotland), was 94 last birthday, and
her faculties are still going strong.
She represents Scotland’s royal Stuarts
in direct descent. Tier portrait ought to be pub-
lished in the Town and Country Journal once a
fortnight at least.
Between them the two Simpsons, father and
son, have been on all the Benches that there are
mN. S. Wales. “ G.B.’s ” father, Captain Percv
—he, by the way, was both a naval and a military
officer was appointed Police Magistrate at
bingleton, after coming to N. S. Wales. The
son, “ G. 8.,” started on the District Court Bench,
but retired from that and went back to the Bar
and politics. The very rare thing happened, and
the man who had been a District Court Judge
became a Supreme Court Judge. And now he is
Acting Chief Justice. Fortunately, he is holiday-
ing in Tasmania, or his tremendous dignity would
simply have burst upon seeing himself called a
' seat-warmer ” in the daily papers.
‘ ‘ Dandalup ” writes :
“ A Man Who Knew Him ” (B. 14/l/’O9) omits one or two
interesting items from his par re Dr. William Bichard
Ooi tis, who died recently in Westralia. Being a wanderer
. was naturally well-liked by the cosmopolitan populace
where for several years he acted as
Chief Medical Officer and Resident Magistrate. During
the final year of his “reign” there (he was practically
Kmperor and “ boss-cocky” in that district) he was com-
mitted, on three occasions, to appear on trial before the
Court for alleged unlawful killing of a man named Gerald
Ascoine. The prosecution contended that Cortis had
caused the man’s death by a mistake in dispensing a
iv. in le case or the Crown failed lamentably,
and the herculean medico was acquitted, and received an
ovation from his friends. After leaving the nor’-west
town, some six months ago, he was appointed Resident
n ij? j er at Kookynie, on the North Coolgnrdie
Goldfield. Towards the end, it is said, he was addicted
to morphia. He was of fine physique and mighty
strength. He was also a man of many parts, having been
in his time politician, soldier, surgeon, magistrate and
sportsman. He was a brilliant raconteur, a large-hearted
wanderer, and a good Australian.
Jack Johnson was a patient at Melbourne
Hospital the other day. He was suffering from
boils (the temptation to say that he wasn’t suffer-
ing from Burns has been killed dead). Mbtoring
up, he had the thing attended to two or three
times und then the usual difference of opinion
arose. It was reported on one side that he didn’t
pay anything, while poor people who were out-
patients had to undertake to scrape up some-
thing; and this yarn held good until Johnson
came along with an explanation from Perth that
he went to the Hospital because he has found that
you get the best treatment there, and that when
he offered to pay what the Hospital liked, the
Hospital said it was sufficiently honored, or words
to that effect. And apparently Johnson didn’t
feel strong enough to argue the point.
EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR.
Mr. G. H. Reid arrived in Adelaide from Westralia
yesterday in the Orient, and continued the voyage
in the steamer. He said he had had a delightful trip,
and stated that although there seems to be a slight de-
pression in the West, the future of the State is so assured
that it causes no anxiety. —Daily Paper.
In fact, the depression disappeared directly after
George left.
JAMES ASHTON, OF N.S.W. STATE
PARLIAMENT.
Francis Villeneuve Smith, the third Chief
Justice of Tasmania, died in London last week in
his 90th year. He was a Sussex man, and was
called to the English Bar in 1842. He shifted to
Van Diemen’s Land in 1844, and ten years after-
wards became Attorney-General under Governor
Denison. When self-government came along in
1856 he was still Attorney-General under the
Premiership of Colonel Champ (who had come to
Sydney as an ensign in the 63rd Regiment in
1828, and was stationed in Van Diemen’s Land
the following year). The Champ Ministry held
office for barely 17 weeks, and was succeeded by
the Gregson Ministry, which was eight weeks in
harness. Weston, with E. V. Smith again Attor-
ney-General, succeeded ; Weston being Premier
without office. Seventeen days satisfied that
team. Ihen Francis Smith—he hyphened the
V llleneuve afterwards—became Attorney-General
and Premier, and held office for 3£ years. When
his Ministry came to an end, he took a seat on
the Bench, and after 10 years’ service as a puisne
Judge he became Chief J ustice in succession to
Valentine Fleming. His Chief Justiceship lasted
15 years, and then he retired and went to
London to enjoy his pension. He was the only
Smith who was ever a Premier in Australasia.
Dr. Sydney Jones, who has just been
appointed President of N.S.W. Medical Board,
trudged to school in Sydney when the city’s popu-
lation was under 30,000. He started practice
there nearly half a century ago. A hobby of his
has been the founding of a consumptives’ sana-
torium at Wentworth Falls. He is now well over
70, but as curious about new medical wrinkles as
he was in the early days.
According to London Daily Telegraph
tiie father of the medical profession lives at
Glenelg (S.A.). He is Surgeon-Major Henry
Benjamin Hinton, who was born in Portsmouth
on March 7, 1813. He became a member of the
College of Surgeons in May, 1835. In 1838 he
joined the Bengal Medical Staff, and served as
surgeon in the 32nd Native Infantry for 30 years.
He has been on the retired list since 1868.
The surgeon-major believes the Australian climate
to be conducive to long life, and he hopes to reach
the century'. He takes a five miles’ walk dailv as
an aid to youth and digestion.
L. G. Madley, Adelaide’s Commissioner of
Police, who will probably be retiring' shortly,
came as near as a man could come
to bringing off a “double” that is,
in the nature of things, impossible.
He was head of a training college
for teachers and also an active
colonel in S.A.’s military force. On
the latter ground he was made
Police-Commissioner on the death
of Peterswald, 13 years ago. Just
afterwards. Hartley, head of the
Education Department, was thrown
from his bicycle and killed. It
at once became evident that Madley
would have been the best man in
sight for that billet, too. But
Peterswald happened to die before
Hartley, so Madley is a policeman
to this day. He has been a very ill
man of late, and walks the streets with difficulty.
Therefore a member of the S.A. Assembly lately
fancied the thing that is not, and remarked
bluntly in the House that a Licensing Act cannot
be enforced by a Commissioner who is not sober
himself. Then everyone who knew Madley rose
to explain that he was a most temperate man,
crippled by illness ; and there were ructions and
questions and withdrawals.
“Brother Chip ” writes :
J. L. Forde, well known as a journalist in Melbourne,
Sydney, and Hobart, has visited London, and placed two
books on the stocks—“ History of the Australian Bar”
and “Irish Exiles in Tasmania.” Having' coursed over
them in serial publication, I think the Irish book will be
the more profitable, although the other is more to my
taste. It will be deficient in the matter of the Sydney
Bar (what a field is there !); but the Melbourne side will
be found done to rights. Forde is diffusive, but, of
course, specialists will gloat over that. He has his
memories of that quartette of Judges, who so long ruled
the roost: Stawell, Barry, Williams, senior, and Moles-
worth, senior—good old Moley, best of the lot. Flies
crawled out of the ink-bottle and wrote his judgments,
comps, got a twicer for setting them. Moley was a legal
statesman in settling mining law. What fights there used
to be over mines, squattages, and banks in the yellow
old court, now about to disappear to make room for the
new police-court! Half Melbourne Gaol, next door, is
already gone, and the land is being re-built upon. Forde
digs down about Fellows, Michie, Aspinall, Dick Ireland,
Dawson, and all those celebrities. Yet he will reap more
dollars out of Smith O’Brien, Mitchell, Meagher, and the
Tassy rebels. They interest Australia, Ireland, and
America.
The death of Francis Smith, of Tas-
mania—the only Smith who was ever a Premier in
Australasia —recalls the fact that the numerous
family to which he belongs has cut only a
moderate figure in politics. Reid's short-lived
Federal Ministry included one Smith—Pumpkin
of that ilk—in a subordinate capacity. In 52
years of Responsible Government N.S.W. has
had two Ministerial Smiths—Bruce and Pump-
kin -the same Pumpkin. Queensland never had
one. S.A. has had 47 Ministries, and Edwin
Thomas Smith of the Bray Cabinet was the only
Smith among them all. He was the tail of the
Ministry and it lasted only 54 days. In Victoria,
two Smiths —George Paton S. and George Verney
y.—held office under McCulloch, and John
Thomas Smith was Mines Minister under Mac-
pherson. Then there was also the really amazing
Smith—William Collard Smith, to wit, the huge-
booted Colonel from Ballarat, the Treasurer who
was once in the midst of announcing a splendid sur-
plus when he found that he had forgotten to include
in his expenditure the interest on the public
debt. William Collard held office in three
or four Ministries, and was a durable Smith.
Furthermore, Victoria had L. L. Smith, who
used to appeal to the young man that didn’t feel
well. Westralia never had a Smith. Tasmania
had Premier Smith already mentioned, but it had
no other Ministerial Smith. The Smiths being
exhausted, it is pertinent to mention that there
was never an Australian Premier named Brown,
Jones or A.* ; nor was there a Federal
Minister of any of those names. Richard
Jones held office in N.S.W. under Cowper.
William Henry Browne was a big man in Queens-
land politics and died when the Premiership was
almost within his grasp. Nicholas Brown was a
Minister of long standing in Tasmania. Charles
Edwin Jones held a paid job in Victoria under
Premier McCulloch. There were two Smiths and
a Jones in that Ministry, and Joseph Jones had a
portfolio in another McCulloch Ministry; and
Frederick Brown was an honorary Minister in
the Shiels Government. That about ends the
list, and through it all the conspicuous and glaring
absence of , 1 " is a deplorable circumstance.
A SUCK AT THE BOTTLE FIRST.
The Government will ask Parliament for additional
borrowing powers so that a loan may be floated at the
first opportunity.— Premier Murray, of Victoria.
The death of F. V. Smith, ex-C.J. of
Tasmania, at the age of 90, recalls the longevity
of some Australian Judges. Burton (N.S.W.)
died at 94 ; Alfred Stephen (N.S.W.) at 92 ; W.
M. Manning (N.S.W.) at 84; Peter Faucett
(N.S.W.), 82; John Kinchella (N.S.W.),.about
80 ; Roger Therry (N.S.W.), 74 ; Robert Moles-
worth (Vic.), 84. Still living are M. H. Stephen
(N.S.W.), past 80 and retired; F. M. Darley
(N.S.W.), 78 past and retiring; J. P. Boucaut
(S.A.), 77 and retired.; S. J. Way (S. A.), 75 and
in harness.
W. A. Murphy, who went into the N.S.W.
Assembly with the first flood of Labor men, after
the maritime and shearers’ strike, is nowadays
Mayor of Fremantle (W.A.), and isn’t a Labor
man any more. Just at present Murphy has
visions of a cotton industry in north-west Wes-
tralia, and is heading a movement to give the
scheme a trial. Derby or its neighborhood will
be the scene of the experiment.
THE LEADER OF MEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Tom Mann writes in the Barrier Daily Truth : “ I
heard the question brought forward in all seriousness
that if the time for real fig'llt sets in, then the men must
certainly secure Spion Kop, otherwise known as the tail-
ings dump, near Weatherley’s shaft, and place their
Maxims there, and if need be a ‘ Long Tom.’ ’’—News item.
I preach the doctrine of social revolution. I declare
myself a rebel against the capitalistic state of society
Tom Mann. j
Mr. Tom Mann said extra police had left Sydney for
Broken Hill. He would say, “ Let’em all come." Four
days in the train and they would see sognemore “ fatties.”
They had shown no fear of the “ fatties ” that day. That
showed plainly what they were prepared to do. “ But if
Roche starts that,” exclaimed Mr. Mann, “by , thev
will find others can play the same game."
Mr. Tom Mann was in the very forefront, marching
with his head thrown back, and now and anon waving his
hat to friends in the crowd.—S. M. Herald.
Mr. Mann was arrested without difficulty. He was
ghastly pale.— Sydney Telegraph.
Included in the programme at B. H. Theatre Royal has
been a speech by Tom Mann. Another star item has now
been added, called the “Bill Bailey Cakewalk.” The
Mayor (Aid. Ivey) and Mann both take a prominent part
in this nightly prance round the stage, with members of
the company.— Sydney Telegraph.
Lo ! it is Thomas
The Leader,
Or False-Alarm Desperado,
Aggressively reckless is he ;
None more so.
See ! He mounts upon a stump
And addresses the people.
(Addressing the people is his strong, in fact, his only,
suit)
He talks of Blood
Gore
Battle
And sudden Insurrection.
(Observe that he talks ; it is about all he ever does.)
He tells how the Capitalist hates him
(Whioh is not strictly true,
The fact being that the Capitalist highly approves of him
As a horrible and idiotic Example,
And would not be without him
For anything).
He talks of mounting cannon on dust-heaps.
Again observe that he only talks.
Thomas, as a hard, cold fact, knows nothing of cannon.
He might fall dead of heart-failure if a cannon went off
in his vicinity.
Nevertheless he spouts,
Blows,
Froths
And brags about cannon,
Till the daily paper young men get writer’s cramp report-
ing him.
Behold ! his orgy of skite has temporarily concluded.
He prepares for one of his favorite “ turns,”
1.e., police-defying.
He advances on Muldoon, P.O.
(On Muldoon of the outsize feet, and the bullet-head)
He observes 1 ‘ ‘ Booh ! ” Likewise ‘ ‘ Bah ! ”
Muldoon replies, “Arrah! Getonwidger,” and relapses
into slumber.
The incident ends.
Thomas scales yet another stump,
He refers acidly to Muldoon as “Fatty.”
(Cheers.)
He spurns Muldoon.
He warns Muldoon of the hideous peril of provoking him
(Thomas).
He screams at Muldoon.
There is no answer.
Muldoon is tired of Thomas, and very, very bored.
And now the hour of Eight strikes
Eight p.m.—
The time that the Vaudeville Show is billed to start.
Thomas hurries to his dressing-room.
His eyes gleam.
He is hoarse, hut happy.
Is he not about to strike a smashing - blow for Labor
And the Dignity thereof ?
In the wings lurks Brother Ivey—
Ivey, who offered to bail Thomas with his (Ivey’s) own
che-ild.
The twain clasp hands,
Protrude waists,
Hurl back their heads,
And, with considerable gravity,
Hop briskly
Round and round the stage.
Cheers fracture the welkin.
There is but one hoot :
It emanates from Edward Savral, Colored Cakewalk
Champion of the Universe,
And is ascribed by Thomas to grinding jealousy,
Plus capitalistic gold.
The curtain falls :
The day’s work is done.
Thomas dons his goloshes, adjusts his comforter, and
returns to bed,
Having shed no blood,
Exploded no firearms,
Started no revolution,
Nor done the slightest damage to anything,
Except to such reputation as he ever owned for having
a sense of humor.

*e
S’*
Eczema is one of the most
torturing forms of Skin Dis-
order. The burning, itching,
prickling sensation is often
maddening. Sometimes per-
sons apparently healthy in
every other way are attacked.
Often it is a symptom in stom-
ach trouble, rheumatism, gout,
or a generally low state of
health. Lotions and ointments
are only of value to allay the
itching sensation. They do not
cure. All the highest medical
authorities agree that a tonic is
necessary to drive the com-
plaint from the system.
Amongst tonics Dr. Williams
Pink Pills stand alone. TheL
twelve years’ record of cures
in Australia proves that there
is nothing nearly so good.
They cured Mr. Walter A. Pickford, of 247
Grenfell Street, Adelaide, who was so bad with
eczema for fifteen years that he despaired of ever
getting his skin clear. In his case he was also a
sufferer from rheumatism.
“In 1895 I got a bad attack of eczema, brought
on by neglected prickly heat, ” said Mr. Pickford
to a reporter. “ I went to a chemist, who gave me
some medicine, but it did no good. It gradually
got worse and the pimples came out in heads and
blotches, and the itching was, something awful.
No amount of scratching gave me any relief.
Very often I would be awake for a couple of hours
at night unable to sleep for the terrible itching.
In the summer the perspiration would get into
the blotches on my back and made it worse. I
had an awful time for years and years. During
all this time I had rheumatism, and this made
matters worse. It was mostly in my knees and
shoulders. Very often I could not get my hand
up to brush my hair on account of the dull, gnaw-
ing pain in my shoulder. My knees had the same
dull, gnawing aching and they swelled up a lot,
and walking was often a positive pain to me. I
lost my appetite. I could not eat much, and got
thin and pale and weak.
“ One doctor told me I had eczema, and that there
was no cure for it. Nothing did me any good at all.
But onee when reading Lloyds Weekly I saw
in an article how a man had been cured of eczema
by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. The same night I
got a box of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills from Court,
the chemist, in Rundle Street. I took this box,
and got some from my grocer, and by the time I
had finished the third box I felt some benefit.
The itching was not so bad. After that I felt my-
self getting better with each box, the itching get-
ting less and the blotches on my back were going
away. I noticed the rheumatic pains were leav-
ing me, and now they are completely gone. Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills did for me what the doctor
said nothing would, do, they cured me of eczema.
Now l am in really good health.”
Insist on getting Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
They are sold by most chemists and storekeepers,
or if not locally obtainable will be sent direct by
the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. of Australasia
Ltd., Sydney, for 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes 15s. 3d.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Though Victoria can find little or no land
for the settler, it can embark upon a huge drunk
in the disposal of grazing lands to rich squatters
at an almost imperceptible rental. Labor-leader
Prendergast lately drew attention to this form of
debauch, and instanced the case of the Victoria
Valley, in the Grampians, where a total area of
184,500 acres is leased for the flyspeek rent of
£237 per annum, or at the rate of a little over
per acre per annum. The land is by no means
leased in small lots to small beef-raisers. The
184,500-acre space is cut into only five tracts—of
20,000, 18,500, 60,000, 55,000 and 31,000 acres re-
spectively. It seemed to Prendergast that the
land might be made available in smaller areas.
So it might, but who wants to do it? Bent
certainly didn’t.
The N.S.W. Parliament House is again
due for repairs, and the N.S.W. Public Works
Committee is deliberating over a scheme for the
spending of £75,000 loan money in titivating it
up. This time the old place is to be practically
rebuilt, and the whole front will be remodelled.
Most of the money to be spent on improvements
inside will be lavished on the rebuilding of the
rooms of the Leg. Council; rooms for the Presi-
dent of the House of Dodder, the Ministers,
officials and attendants on Dodder, and for the
stray, who rarely gazes on assembled Dodder.
And as N.S.W. will one day be goaded into
sweeping Dodder clean off the slate, much money
seems going to waste.
We still see in
the papers occa-
sional headlines
such as “ Italians
for the Northern
Territory” or
“ Russian Jew's
as Immigrants,”
all based on the
theory that immi-
grants of our own
race and language
can’t be got, and
that we must
needs rush, in our
despair, for any-
thing caaual on
tw'o legs. The
theory is absurd.
Some of the Aus-
tralian States
have just breath-
ed a whisper in
England that they
are willing to
supply cheap pas-
sages to good
male and female
settlers, and the
Agents - General
are being rushed.
It is reckoned
that already some
20,000 suitable
immigrants have
been rejected be-
cause Australia
didn’t know what
it could do with
so many. Any
Australian Gov-
ernment which
would get a move
on it in the mat-
ter of the gradu-
ated land-tax and the taking over of the Northern
Territory would have no need to look for Italian
or Russian Hebrew immigrants, and no reason
to take anything casual on two legs. It could
get the country population of the British isles
almost in a mass.
Premier Murray has a fine chance to bring
in a solid practical reform by agreeing with the
Commonwealth authorities to make one set of
electoral rolls do for Vic. State as well as Federal
elections. The tortuous and wasteful Bent
wouldn’t agree to it, his idea being to force every-
one who was not on the ratepayers’ rolls to take
out an electoral right. As there is only one rate-
payer for each inhabited dwelling, this meant
that most women must go to the trouble of get-
ting a right, or be disfranchised. Bent, of course,
perceived that his plan would suit Fat all right,
as that individual could get a vote for himself at
his office, and have his wife’s name on the rate-
payers’ roll for his private house. The women’s
vote, however, wasn’t intended to be a present to
Mr. and Mrs. Fat. Besides, the Federal plan of
getting the names is cheaper, simpler and far
more thorough.
THE CHIEF JUSTICESHIP.
WADE (to temporary Chief Justice): “ Here, just
hold that wig for a minute while I settle this
matter with McGowen. After that you can go.”
Premier Ward, of Maoriland, is still seeing
bright-hued financial snakes in his boots. This
item from Melbourne Age shows that the loan
jag is progressing favorably
The Maoriland Government is negotiating for a 4 per
cent, loan in Melbourne. The amount, it is stated, is
£250,000.
It is certainly only a paltry quarter of a million,
but every paltry quarter of a million means at
least another reptile, and Joe can’t afford to amass
reptiles. His boots are full. And on almost the
same day Ward borrowed £600,000 in London at
4 per cent. He will have to keep that serpent in
the washhouse or else buy a dozen fresh boots.
The Grave, great teacher, to a level
brings
Hero, and beggar, galley slave and
kings.
WILLIS’S BOOK, “ The Life of Crick,
with Reminiscences of A. G. Taylor,” is now
definitely promised to see the light in March next.
Much interest is taken in Willis’s effort to vindi-
cate his dead friend before the bar of public
opipion. Willis knew Crick for more than 30
years, and for many a long day was his close con-
fidant, so he should be able to speak with some
certainty and authority. He promises strong
censure and extra strong denunciation of some
persons sitting in high places.
Willis pledges the book to be readable from
cover to cover ; therefore many Australians are bn
the tiptoe of expectancy to secure a first issue
volume. This can be done effectually by sending
5/- direct to W. N. Willis, Rand wick, Sydney, and
he will see that a first volume is posted in Aus-
tralia to South Africa, New Zealand or England.
Those who believe that Crick was badly treated
by a mob of political pigmies should order the
book of his vindication without delay.
The reminiscenses of the brilliant A. G. Taylor
should be highly interesting reading and food for
the mind pf the present day generation. On the
platform, in politics, on the press, or fighting alone
his case against the New South Wales Government,
before the Privy Council, Taylor had no equal in
his time. Willis romped and scampered over the
fields at Mudgee, robbed orchards, played marbles,
and was generally a boy mate of Taylor’s. In
after life they were associated on the press and in
Parliament together, consequently much interest
is added to the work by the inclusion of some
memoirs of Taylor’s life.
OUR PATCHWORK PRECAUTIONS.
THE BOY PROM MANLY: “ It is just dawning
upon me that there is no great wisdom in
building a magnificent gate in a bad fence.”
Be Bent’s financial antics prior to the late
dissolution of the Yic. Assembly. It turns out
now that the last supply warrant had been signed
by the Governor on 21st October, and that the
same made money available for November ex-
penditure. But for the December expenditure
there was no warrant, and,'constitutionally speak-
ing, no money. Yet a trifle like that didn’t worry
Bent. In response to a memo, from the perma-
nent head of the Treasury setting forth the posi-
tion, the large, loud, and impossible autocrat
framed a blunt minute to this effect: “In reply
whether you should make payments, I say pay.
The public creditor must be met. Go on paying.”
That document ought to be preserved as a curio.
The “ I say pay ” fairly reeks with arrogance.
When Parliament closed up, this notice
was still on the business paper of the Reps.—put
there by Dr. Maloney, from Melbourne—he of the
wild hair and the large heart: —
In view of the fact that in ordinary years no farmer or
grazier regrets or bemoans the fact that his cattle have
calves, his sheep have lambs, his horses have foals, or his
pigs have litters—it is the opinion of this House that it is
neither civilised nor Christian in our present society that
unfortunate parents too frequently are known to bewail
the advent of a newly-born Australian babe, and that in
order to prevent the terrible and God-hating death roll of
children in Australia, and to make each father and
mother rejoice that none of their offspring may want the
necessaries of life, viz., food, shelter and clothing, it
should be the duty of the Old Age Pension authorities
that whenever requested by any reputable person to
make inquiries into such cases brought before them, and if
on full inquiry it is found that any Australian-born
children are without such necessities of life, then such
authorities shall make the necessary provision for such
children.
The Treasurer of the Commonwealth shall provide the
required funds.
The idea has a mighty lot to recommend it, even
if the Treasurer of the Commonwealth is already
bald through worry.
In the old days the tallest poppies in the
public service engineered a lot of pretty schemes
for adding to the salaries which the country
thought it was paying them; but one by one
those pretty schemes are being spoiled. A
“ Tender Board ” was one way by which N. S.
Wales used to pay six or eight men a guinea a
week each. At first they used to sit in office
hours, during the time they were supposed to be
earning their salaries. Then Premier See saved
the guinea pigs for a year or two by having the
sittings after office hours. Finally, however, they
lost their guineas, and they do the work as part of
their regular duties. Now the Westralian Par-
liament, prodded by the Labor party, has decided
that the backstairs bonus must stop there, too,
and in future the Tender Board in Perth is to
work on the same basis as in the Ma community.
A recent daily paper item :—
YASS, Friday.
The arrival of Mr. Scrivener to enter upon the survey of
the capital territory is awaited with interest because of
the uncertainty as to the exact location of the city site.
It is recognised that the water supply must necessarily
largely influence that question, and just now the Murrum-
bidgee and some of its important tributaries traversing
the area are either stationary or muddy streams. Indeed
it is a long time since the former river has been so low,
and the disastrous effects of the silting process are
apparent. Many who have watched the influence of this
silting upon the bed of the river are of opinion that it has
never received the consideration due as a factor to be
dealt with in the future of the Barren Jack Reservoir.
The Minister for Home Affairs was recently reported as
mentioning the possibilities of Bungendore, a small town
on Lake George, as the site for the Federal capital.
Lake George, of course, is a magnificent sheet of water
when full. But it has twice been empty within modern
recollection, and a couple of years ago the bed was quite
dry, and it looked as though the largest inland sea in
New South Wales was doomed to disappear. Latterly,
however, a considerable volume of water has found its
way into the basin.
The new Victorian Government proposes
to appoint a royal commission to investigate the
land transactions of the recent Bent Ministry.
Premier Murray doesn’t state whether the com-
mission will be supplied with a keg of disin-
fectants, or whether it will simply hold its nose.

By “Timber-hacker” :
Premier Wade’s brother has made his report on the
wholesale rejection of 11,000 N.S.W. sleepers shipped to
S’Africa with a Government certificate declaring them up
to specification. Brother Wade personally examined
4000 sleepers out of a huge pile now rotting in Africa,
and he agreed with the party who rejected them. He had
then to ascertain how the condemned timber came to get
a Government certificate of approval on its departure
from N.S.W., and he learned that certain sleepers had
been inspected and passed in the forest primeval about a
year before shipment. When they were actually ready
for shipment the}' were formally identified by the De-
partment as sleepers which had already inspected, and
the approving certificate was issued. The total number
was 30,000, and Brother Wade argues that it would be a
cute inspector who could see through a stack of that size
and see the Government stamp on each sleeper. Wade
further states that many of the sleepers he saw were
inherently bad and must have been faulty when sawn.
But he declined to expressly state whether the original
inspection was weak or whether the bad ones were “ rung
in ” later on. Anyhow the Ma State gave a certificate
that the sleepers were all good, and the event seriously
depreciates the value of the Ma State’s certificate.
Geelong (Vic.), the town that is squeezed
in by big landlords, is proud of some recent
figures. Of 440 people who died there last year
more than half were over 60 years of ag6. Geelong
carefully doesn’t remember that the young men
are quitting the country of bloated estates and
undersized sheep, leaving few besides the very
young or the old to either live or die there.
And it’s quite easy for 220 people to put up a fine
average record in the matter of the age at which
they die if they happen to have passed out in an
old people’s refuge.
GUNS VERSUS BEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Even though we credit the American Republic with all
the sincere good will and sympathy for us which the
recent Fleet visit to our shores seemed to designate, it is
now obvious that we have not much cause to plume
ourselves thereabouts. The agreement between America
and Japan makes that very plain to us. It was arranged
in November last—the baked meats of the Australian
celebrations in honor of the Fleet hardly cold, at all
events in the memory of the participants. And the
agreement is not a thing to give Australians any satis-
faction. ... It contains not one word about preserving
the status quo in the South Pacific, and is completely
silent on the question of colored immigration. —Daily
■paper.
Oh 1 a battleship will hold a lot o’ beer,
An’ there’s nothin’ left o’ beer when it’s been drunk ;
There was sixteen of them fightin’ tanks down ’ere.
An’ we sent each Jackie dizzy to 'is bunk.
But w r e’d nothin’much in battleships t’ show,
An’ our cruisers they was jokes upon the W’ave,
We could only give ’em pap,
So they fixed up with th’ Jap
That’s a feather in our cap
(Gor’ Save !).
Oh ! a battleship’s an’ ’ard and solid fact,
But our arguments was made o’ flags an’ fizz
(Which ain’t sense within th’ meanin’ of th’ Act),
So we wasn’t up t’ talkin’ straight-out biz ;
But they drank th’ pints we ’anded, thankful-like,
For they’d marched for us upon th’ bloomin’ pave,
Just t’ show ’ow fightin’ men
Landed—marched about, and then
Went aboard their fightin’ pen
(Gor save !).
Yes, a battleship’s an ’andy thing t’ own.
Oh 1 but we was out of battleships, y’ see,
The old Powerful that is painted like a stone,
She amused them while th’ launches to th’ Quay,
With th’ shore-leave men in pinnaces be’ind—
Who’d been cautioned by their captains to be’ave —
Puffed an’ screeched all night and day,
As they ’urried on their way
From th’ big ships in th’ bay
(Gor save!).
Ah, a battleship’s a comfort when it’s there,
When it’s absent it’s a ’orrid, achin’ blank ;
It’s th’ nation’s only kettle, an’ its chair,
An’ its double-bed, its cradle, and its tank ;
It’s th’ bit of furniture yer never lend
An’ yer couldn’t borrer if it was t’ save
Yer immortal, bloomin’ soul
From th’ Devil’s flamin’ coal
In ’is 'orrible stoke-’ole
(Cor' Save ! )
Oh ! a battleship’s a Reason f’r all things,
It’s a Statement that nobody will deny,
An’ it swaggers past th’ emperors and kings,
As it looks th’ King o’ Battles in th’ eye ;
It takes th’ beer and cheering as its right,
Jus’ as any man who know’s ’e’s big an’ brave
Takes th’ liklcer an’ th’ noise
Of th’ little, drinkin’ boys—
Tho’ it ain’t what he enjoys,
(Gor’ save ! )
Oh ! a battleship can hold a lot o’ swill,
But th’ show is over when th’ bottle’s dry ;
But cheer up and pass along a liver pill,
For this lesson we’ll remember by-and-bye ;
There was flags an’ beer an’ cheerin’ to no end,
But our navy was a thing t’ make yer yelp ;
We ’ad nothin’ we could show,
So we ’ad t’ let ’em go,
An’ they fixed up with th’ foe !

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, January 26, 1909.
My Dear Arini
This is the season of the year wherein the mem-
bers of our old nobility order the Saratogas to be
from the lumber room and freed from
dust, lay in a keg or two of “Sea-joi,” make
inquiries concerning the latest things in deck-
furniture, and in general prepare for the exodus
London-wards. The Walter Allens are said to
be certain starters, and Mrs. Burdekin and her
fair daughters leave these shores in time to strike
the beginning of the London season. Also the
Oswald Watts are understood to be meditating
another flit shortly. The Darley family leaves
several of this State’s financi-
ally desirable bachelors will be in the murky old
Thames-side village ere the winter fog lifts.
You won’t hear directly from your Akenehi for
another few weeks. Presently she starts to
elude February, which is made up of the weather
that Satan threw out of his realm because it was
too disagreeable for his home consumption. She —
that is I intends to pervade Dalgety (and fish
with a bent pin) and to pounce bn Cooma. Is
there anything to be done at Cooma except
breathe ?
At the end of this month Mrs. (Dr.) Weston is
to start to be a homing pigeon. She has been
ruffling it on the ice near the head of Lake
Lucerne, in Switzerland. In Paris, she says, the
women were small-hatted, but a revival of the
leviathan hat is to occur in the Spring. Coming
through the Froggy capital Mrs. Weston saw
Mrs. Lachlan Beaton looking almost as slender as
Miss Ruby Adams. The Ruby’s voice soars
now like the notes of a trained seraph.
Mrs. Beaton complained humorously of the
annoyance caused in Paris by the multitude of
dirigible balloons and flying machines. They
are so uncomfortably suggestive of “the War in
the Air,” and make a fearful buzz. One huge
thing like a flying fish, carrying eight people,
hurtles over her flat daily, The Degens were
radiant as and the travelling Australians
seem to have jfcjieir share of the world’s highways.
A string of! diamonds is what report says the
committee of,the Miss Rawson Presentation Fund
will decide upon as the “remembrance” to the
Excellencette. Most of the persons who are sub-
scribing to the testimonial hope the report will
prove incorrect, and ask why not give Miss
Rawson the farewell gift in cheque form" to invest
as she pleases. She appears to have a fair num-
ber of glittering gauds already, including her
mother’s jewels, and she might fancy something
of her own choosing. A diamond is a very cold,
hard substance even if it is very valuable. Miss
Rawson might like to furnish a lair of her own in
a flat when she gets back to her native land. Or
she might like to keep kangaroos or do a little
travel. Of course, if the committee’s idea is that
the girl shall have a permanent reminder of
Australia, something that won’t wear or wash
out, then the string of cold, hard substances
is what it will decide upon. Mrs. Allen Taylor
is president of the committee, Mrs. Hugh Dixson
and Miss Harris are hon. treasurers, and Mrs.
Suttor, Mrs. H. C. Dangar and Mrs. S. W.
Moore are hon. secs. As the list of subscribers’
names will not be published, you may send in
your abject shilling without fear of seeing it
blazoned below Mrs. Buster-Cross’ ten guineas.
Said that the youthful Manuel of Portugal,
whose luckless dad and brother were slaughtered
last year, is about to take up the matrimonial
burden. Rumor credits him with strictly honor-
able intentions in regard to the Kaiser’s only
daughter, and it is understood that the family at
Potsdam is only too willing to anchor the house
dog in a remote paddock, vacate the front parlor,
and in other respect make things comfortable for
him when he calls. If the match eventuates, Miss
Hohenzollern will have to experience a sudden
spiritual “call” in.the direction of Rome. In
anticipation of this the Imperial family has
dropped its subscription to the Sydney Watchman.
The Girls’ Realm Guild has opened a depot for
the sale of work at 76 Pitt-street, same floor as
the Art Society. The Guild secretary says :
Any kind of work will be received for Sale provided it
reaches a certain standard, and workers will not be re-
stricted to any particular kind of work as hitherto. Jams
preserves, savories, and sweets (in boxes) will be taken
but at present no cakes or scones, though orders may be
taken for these.
When Miss Rawson returns from her rest cure
at Sutton. Forest she will visit the depbt.
“Cynthia,” in the Melbourne Leader, has writ-
ten some wise words to women exhibitors, and
these are some of them :
If women, before they set out to indulge in art needle-
work, will resolve to ascertain the commercial value of
the result, it might have a salutary effect on them. It is
actually bad art to put weeks of work into a cushion
cover, for instance. A cushion cover, properly speakino-
is something designed to stand wear and tear and plenty
of washing. They should not be made of material that
will not stand washing. The same applies to curtains
sofa-spreads and bed-spreads. The mantel drape, which
evidently still appeals with much force to the exhibiting
needle-worker, is extinct as the dodo in the modern
room. It was never anything much better than a
dust trap, and the mantel runner that has fol-
lowed it—a runner that only shows at the ends
is always made of washing material. It is kinder
to state emphatically that plush, satin and silk, either
painted or embroidered, are as far out of fashion as they
deserve to be. In the real living rooms at Government
House, cushion slips, sofa, and chair spreads are all white.
Many of these are exquisitely embroidered, and many are
inlet with lace and decorated with drawn-thread work.
The effect of them is delightful. White linen slips, de-
corated with cross stitch in Turkey red and blue, are the
sort of things the modern housew’ife is always ready to
buy—plain things well made and simply decorated. ‘ To
find these things in the average, indeed in the excep-
tional, shop is practically impossible. It is the same
with plain linen bed-spreads, showing a very little good
hand-done embroidery. You can get elaborate linen
work and machine-done linen W’ork, but the sort of work
’t would pay needle-workers quite well to do is unbuyable.
It is here that exhibitions really come in.
Mrs. Asquith, wife of the Prime Minister of
Britain, recently broke a bottle of Australian
wine over the bows of £2,000,000 worth of battle-
ship. She named it the Collingwood, and the
christening hymn (sung by 1000 voices) was
Internal Father, Strong to Save.” The infer-
e?ce * s Lord could save England, but,
atter deep consideration, He won’t, so England has
on kh Q job itself. Then the vessel glode
into the w ater, and at the same moment the band
struck up, ‘ Here’ a Health to all Good Lasses.”
ihe sonorous, reverential quality of the hymn,
ana the frank, jolly materialism of the band’s
choice ! For the rest, Mrs. Asquith, it is gravely
chronicled, wore two hats at the ceremony. She
was decked out in a a big one when she was on
the christening platform. The wind buffeted it
oadly, and from a hat case, carried by an Asquith
minion, a snug toque was produced, and that was
what the lady wore when she came at the critical
moment with a “carved mallet ” and small chisel,
and shoved the ship into the water. The two
musical selections, the two hats, and our contribu-
tion, the bottle of Australian wine, are guffy little
items that lighten the grimness of the £2,000,000
worth of battleship.
Miss Helena Rubinstein, the Venus of Valaze,
who hasbeen putting back the hand of time for
elderly English peeresses, and making them look
as they did 25 years ago, is a return passenger to
this country by the Mooltan. She will be in
oydnev about the end of this week, but will only
stop a poor seven days or so. The 500-guinea fee
sits upon her mat and doorstep at 24 Grafton-
street, Mayfair, in Bullopolis, awaiting her return.
Another returner by the Mooltan is Miss Lay-
cock, the talented miniature painter, who has
been a year studying in Paris. The Kenneth
Andersens are back by the Orient. They are a
most-travelled brace of Australians, and might
give their address as The Cradle of the Deep.
Menu of a farewell dinner given to two Sydney
men at the Cafb Monico in London in November
reaches me just before lunch, and spoils the antici-
patmn of my corned beef. Mr. George Bloxham
and Mr. Willie Franks were the Sydneysiders for
whom the Elegant Repast was spread. One of
the courses was golden pheasant with truffles and
salad. Who’d look at corned beef and carrots after
that ? An amazing kangaroo, evidently drawn by
the r rench chef, sits on his tail in a corner of the
menu, and watches through a telescope a liner dis-
appearing off the other corner of the document.
If sj’mpathy made for consolation, Mrs. Leahy,
W 'i khe Mayor of Mosman, would be con-
soled by the flood of condolences poured in her
direction. Mr. Leahy died suddenly last week.
The visiting Batthyany-Strattmann nobleman,
who turns out to be not the younger hummer of
that name, but an older member of the line, has
Maoriland to shoot the deer and deceive
the fish with a treacherous offer of refreshment.
(Come to think of it, fishing is a low down game ;
you ask the fish to a worm lunch and then
murder your guest.) Whilst in Sydney Batthyany
successfully lay low and said nuffin to attract
attention.
Mr. Walter Marks’s yacht, the Culwulla, has
gone into the possession of another Sydney
yachtsman, and its former owner will be back
here presently with the plans of the very latest
thing in white wings in his suit-case.
The sheath skirt we know ; the tube skirt we
may know, as it has come into the open in Paris
and London. Probably its successor will be the
pipe skirt. Dress creators (or destroyers) seem to
be on the hunt for names that will justify and
differentiate the skinny, tight skirt. Pictures of
the tube dresses show them to be very like those
worn by Napoleon’s sisters in “The Duchess of
Dantzic, ’ now at Her Majesty’s. They are narrow
and quite plain clothes, with a trained frontage as
well as a tail, and very long hideous swallow-tailed
coats. The coat is so tight and plain in the matter
j ou “ er an d sleeve that, when the wearer ex-
tends an arm, she looks like a semaphore—-or,
worse still, a finger-post. Pauline and Caroline
Bonaparte, at Her Majesty’s, are dressed with
historical exactitude, but the female Bonaparte
with the emerald-green skirt and the brownish
swallow-tail coat must wish that history hadn’t
cut away the front of her top garment with such
disastrous results to her figure. The vast expanse
of shining green satin below the dull waist-line of
coat makes her look all tummy and hips.
If you mean to be quite correctly dressed pre-
sently, you will not be able to lift your hand to
your head to straighten your hat, or to put back
the escaping hairpin. Apparently, no allowance
is made for elbow-joints, and for the last lap or
two the sleeve is fastened with loops and buttons.
A hatpin, the size of a small plaque, is making
its way amongst Sydney women. Saw two (in
one hat) lately. They were the size of an after-
noon tea saucer, and were apparently of hand-
painted china. If war comes whilst this brand of
hatpin is in vogue the wearer may use it as a com-
bined shield and sticker.
This phrase leapt gratefully out of my morning
paper at me on Thursday last
The Morea provides an admirably-equipped laundry.
If the P. and O. people realised all the cuss-words,
male and female, they will prevent by this move,
they would become over-righteous to' an insuffer-
able extent. Hitherto the P. and O. voyager’s
laundering has been done at Colombo. There is
no other laundering like it on the face of this
earth. .It is as well; for were things
otherwise the world’s suicide tally would
swell. The Cingalee’s idea of fulfilling a
washing contract is to arrive in your cabin
the moment the ship drops anchor—to arrive
in a profuse state of perspiration, accom-
panied by an acquaintance, also in a profuse state
of perspiration, and to begin a mad three-handed
argument (you are dragged into it whether you
like it or no) as to who is to have the laving of
your garments. The noisier of the two savages
wins, and departs at break-neck speed for the
shore under a load of fine linen. Hours after-
wards, perchance, you are driving to the Cinna-
mon Gardens, or the native quarter, or Mount
Lavinia, when you pass an insanitary, biblical-
looking pool—the ideal place, you muse, to “dip”
a leper or possessor of devils. Bashing a frail
white garment on a flat stone by the margin of
the slimy flood is an inadequately-clothed nig.
You look closer. He rubs the filmy thing with
immense energy on the stone. A thrill of rage
shakes you. Sure enough, it is yours! The identical
one you paid three guineas for six weeks ago, or
six guineas three weeks ago —it doesn’t matter to
the nigger. Your nigger isn’t alone ; all round
the little lake there are hundreds like him, all
dashing clothes against rocks. When you get
back to the ship you are presented by your clothes-
dasher with a number of ruined and partially-
ruined goods, and a preposterous bill. Later you
acquire “ dhoby plague ” —an appalling complaint
that suggests prickly heat multiplied by 1,957,403.
It is about this time that you resolve to dress in
sackcloth and buy a fresh sack each day rather
than let a Colombo native wash for you again.
The Darling Pointers have had a little break in
the silliness of the silly season, and are feeling
quite tally-ho-ish over the same. A full-grown
fox was shot in the chicken yard of a villa of the
Pointed neighborhood last week. The animal
that is disrespectfully mentioned in the Scriptures
had got away with ten baby chickens from the
hen-house of Pa Smith (of the Australia), and
other winged gear from his next-door neigh-
bor, before a man behind a gun ended
the pretty red animal’s life and stopped
the waving of his elegant tail. The Darl-
ing Pointers are wondering where the fox
came from, and are feeling worthy of an extra
ruffle that he should have selected their Point for
a hunting country. Perhaps he came from Point
Piper. Two years ago I used to nuzzle two baby
foxes, to which a friend there had given the run
of a grassy enclosed area. Quite a number of
persons have adopted infant foxes, only to let
them go free when nearly full grown, because
they proved untameable and would bite humans,
and had a taste for poultry. One of the Pipers of
Bathurst, so a friend tells me, rides into town
witli a full-grown tame fox trotting at his steed’s
heels, but such conquests are rare. This fox-
lover has to carry a stockwhip with which to belt
off dogs that want to bite his property.
The bride-elect of the entrepreneur (that’s a
good word, and hard to spell) of whom I wrote
last week without mentioning his name is in
Sydney, and last week he took her to see “The
Broken Home” at the Palace. It is a Warning
to Women, no doubt, but what courage to take
your bride-elect to such an antithesis of Home,
Sweet, Sweet Unbroken Home !
An understudy of Miss Florence Gleeson is
acting Batty (to the audience it sounds Betty), the
only true friend of the “Rat” in “The Breed of
the Treshams.” Miss Gleeson’s sister died in
Melbourne last week, and the clever little Florry
is out for lamentation, not merry-making.
Mrs. Doubleday writes from Vienna of her
daughter Leila’s successful appearance at an
Anglo-American Club evening. The festival
was given to inaugurate the opening of the club’s
new rooms. Leila was personally congratulated
by the Duchess of Teck, and an impresario present
straightway offered the youngster an engage-
ment. Her tyrant professor, however, will not
yet hearken to a word of her playing in public.
Andrew Black, the distinguished Scottish
singer, is out for a second crop of bridal blossoms !
He is to marry a comely widow, Mrs. Licht-
scKeindl, of Pfahlert’s Hotel.
Another singer of note —a soprano in this case,
Miss Fiorelli—is engaged to Mr. Hooper, an
assistant-inspector in the Union Bank.
The soulful-eyed, inspired-looking Greder, who
came here with Musgrove’s German opera birds,
and did not go back to watch on the Rhine, is
teaching and singing his way into fame in Sydney.
He has deserted his Mosman’s water frontage,
and taken that little, cheese-colored, old stone
cottage in Wyuna-road, that used to be the head-
gardener’s cottage of Woollahra House when the
Martins (C. J.) inhabited the historic mansion.
Mrs. Minna Fischer, Herbert Flemming’s
widow, was married early in December in Lon-
don. Her new venture is Mr. George Olutsam,
late of this city, a pianist and composer of some
ability.
From “Rosna,” who is wintering in Adelaide :
The Excellent Dudleys have begun to pervade the
scene. They came in by the Victoria on Thursday, and
the Outer Harbor waved flags and shot guns at them ;
and the Adelaide station was splendid with red carpets,
green palms, and members of Parliament. There
were rafts of officials on the platform—enough
to reach from here to Sydney, some of them,
however, being only of the acting or plated
variety. The leaning army formed a guard of honor on
North Terrace, and his Ex. examined it and said it was a
very good army as far as it went, which was only up to
the corner of King William-street or so. Three motors
carted their Exes, and co. to Marble Hill, and Mr. Owen
Smyth went with them to show them the cella* and the
linen press, and divulge the hiding place of the plate
basket. His Dudleyship came down on Friday for a game
of cricket on the Oval and a mote round town.
The Waratah carried the Professor Braggs off to
Britain’s isle on Thursday, and loud and long was the
lamenting thereat, particularly among the young Uni-
versity fry. Himself has carried round the chair of
science at the ’Varsity for something like a quarter of a
century, and there’s no one to touch him for popularity
among the young strugglers who have shinned np Par-
nassus under his direction. He has done much for that
same chair (which has been gradually converted,
under his care, from a cheap kitchen article
into a gorgeous throne-room affair), and now
Leeds has stolen him from us,' wherefore we weep
and pipe our eye. Mrs. Bragg was one of ex-Postmaster
Charles Todd’s daughters, and there are several children.
The eldest boy snatched an honors degree in Arts at the
recent Commem. The Outer Harbor was completely con-
cealed by the crowd of frilly folk who tore down to the
Waratah to wave a damp hanky at the departing family.
By the same boat went the David Tweedies and their
daughter, who have been out from Scotland, ye ken,
visitin’ this wee sma’ toon.
Wine-monarch P. B.tßurgoyne, who slid over S.A.’s
landscape the other day, has been patting our little wine-
industry on the cask and telling us Omar would be proud
of it. In a brief week he and his motor managed to
scour the State from north to south and east to west,
looking in at a few hundred vineyards on the way. He
flung sundry pearls of wisdom at the few thousand vine-
yards, and here and there purchased a trifle of 70,000 or
80,000 gallons of wine to take to Britain in his little car-
pet bag. Then he waved farewell to the few million vine-
yards and slipped unobserved into Melbourne.
Port Pirie has lately established a Pioneers’ Society, for
the ostensible purpose of giving itself an annual dinner
and generally throwing bouquets at itself. January (18th)
was called Pioneers’ Day, and the town wore itshair in
curling pins for a week beforehand. The excitement on the
auspicious day was quite intense to behold. Every
pioneer cow in the district wore the South Australian flag
floating from her left horn, and every horse that had lived
in the town for 50 years or more was given a pension for
life, payable when the animal called for it and put his
hoof to the receipt. At the dinner there were 50 pioneers
to be fed. S.A. would be lost if it couldn’t have these
celebrations, you know. It is its one way of reminding
the world at large that it began life as a province not a
colony ; also that it wasn’t sent out lor its country’s good
like some other States we are too polite to mention. * ’
We are still electric tramless, though nearly all the
lines are ready for use, and are being fled over by the
ancient nag-cars. One of the electric poles got so
annoyed about it the other day that it swooped down
tore the covering off the top of the car, and banged an
unoffending passenger vindictively on the head. The
residents of Norwood have had to fall back on the awful
penny 'buses ; also some of them have fallen off these
same. The other morning a boy jumped from the ’bus
and was killed. He was the son of Christian Urhlaub a
great authority on Esperanto, and correspondent in dead
languages or something of the sort at the Observatory.
The other eve, about midnight or 2 a.m., the Trust
suddenly took it into its cranium to run the electric
trams up and down the street for a joke or trial or some-
thing. An excited populace immediately arose from its
bed and dashed out in a partially dressed state to have a
free ride. Comic opera isn’t in it with our Tramways
Trust.
Artist Mabel Boothby scores a compliment in David
Gordon’s Handbook of S.A., just published. The
book has been issued by our Government to scatter in
thousands at an ignorant world, and show it what a mar-
vellous country we’ve got concealed about us. There are
800 photos, to illustrate this same, and among them one
of Miss Boothoy’s “ South Australian Eleven,” a charm-
ing picture of 11 giddy kookaburras.
The south-east, which comprises Mount Gambier, the
place of the dead and gone volcano, and the surrounding
country is exciting itself over the ancient vexed question
of draining its swamp lands. The local aristocracy had
a conference about it, the other day, and a luncheon
after the conference. (It’s wonderful how many excuses
you can find to have a luncheon.) And every one but-
tered his neighbor up and then slithered him down, as
Charles Lever’s Irish lawyer put it; and all spoke kindly
about the dear, good Government, which is going to pay
half the cost if the scheme is ever definitely decided
upon. It will only run to £300,000, which is nothing !
Yours Affectionately,
AKRNEHI.

“ W. Court ” writes :
I grow somewhat tired of the ravings of the daily papers
regarding 0. J. Barley’s astounding services to the Ma
State. He has been a moderate-to-bad C. J.—no more, no
less. Of late years his deafness has handicapped him and
litigants in an equal degree. At his best, he was never
in the class of men like Martin or Stephen. Not only did
he lack their mentality, but he lacked in an even greater
degree their unbiassed and judicial minds. Asa barrister
in big practice put it to the writer, some years ago:
“ When the Chief’s with you, it’s all delightful" harmony ;
when he’s against you, it’s one long, horrible jangle.”
Which was a true word. Darley’s most valuable asset has
ever been his imposing figure, appearance and manner.
He looks, and has always looked, almost incredibly wise.
For this, plus moderate ability and a goodly term of
honest work, punctuated with lengthy vacations, he has
been extremely well paid. He has held two billets, and
has drawn double pay, between the following dates :
Nov. 2, ’oo—May 27, ’O2
March 2—May 29, ’93
March 16—Nov. 22, ’95
March 5, ’99 —May 18, ’99
June 7, ’05 —Dec. 29, ’O5
He has enjoyed at least one year’s leave of absence on full
pay, and he now begins another. He draws a fat pension
till he dies, and will spend it in the Cold Old Country.
To sum up, the State which Darley doesn’t consider gtiod
enough to pass his declining days in has been worth about
£lOO,OOO to him. In the circumstances the wild splurge
that is being made in his regard strikes me as unseemly.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 25, 1909.
My Dear Yarrie,—
This is a private paragraph—j ust a wireless
, whisper into the left wing of every lyre-bird in
Australia—a warning to “ lie low and say nuffin.”
The Women of Paris have fancied lyre-birds to
decorate their winter fur toques, and there is no
hunter so ruthless or cruel as a Fashionable
Woman when her mind is set on a new feather or
fur.
It is most presumptuous to warn lyre-birds—
they are, perhaps, the most exclusive and retiring
of feathery beings. They nest in cool, damp
depths of ferny gullies, with hundreds of perpen-
dicular feet between them and the sunlight that
cirips through the shining crowns of the big gums,
and miles of horizontal bush and falien trees
between them and even the most lonely bush
track. They scent a man afar off, and fly from
him, but their very isolation prevents them know-
ing what a crafty, ravaging vandal is a
daughter of Eye looking for a fanciful new fig-
leaf to wear in her ear. The lyre-bird has one
vanity that bewrayeth him. As he struts deli-
cately or dances solemnly on the moss in the
hidden depths he imitates other birds and animals.
The imitations follow in quick succession like the
lightning changes of a vaudeville artist, and
through all there is a subtle note that belongs
only to himself. And this note a real bushman’s
ear can usually detect.
The Dudleys departed last week for Adelaide
by the good ship Victoria, and carried a complete
hospital outfit with them. The Countess is look-
ing peaked and wan, and the Lady Honor of
the appendicitis had just reached the stage of
being trundled gently about with many pillows in
a carriage behind the most reliable Patrick.
Georgiana, grandmother of the Dudleys, is
coming to this country. She arrives in the spring,
tra-la, and brings the godchildren of the King—
the Dudley twins, who were too unseasoned to
this world last year to be exposed to the perils of
a voyage to an unknown climate.
Governor Carmichael, who apparently is as
learned in marbles as he is in beetles, recently
made a visit to Summers’ studio, and took a prac-
tical interest in his collection. Summers is the man
who burrows in remote and unreachable places for
marbles, ‘and battles for an Australian market.
In his studio he has dinky little ton-weight samples
of twenty or more varieties dug out of Australia,
and polished by himself and his son. He has
colored marbles that are excellent for building
and invaluable for interiors. There is a pink as
clear and delicate as the blushes of an Aphrodite—
a color that is scarce in markets abroad.
There are some pieces as pure white and as work-
able as the famous Carrara, though this has not
yet been found in payable quantities. It is essen-
tially statuary marble. The other varieties are
of excellent building value and in great quanti-
ties, while some of the stones have the special
advantage of being scarce in European markets.
Perverse local powers labor under the delusion
that Australian marbles yield reluctantly to good
surface polish. The blocks Carmichael was look-
ing at had been polished by sheer elbow grease
with the most primitive tools and within the
limitations of a suburban studio, yet their surface
gleam impressed this connoisseur considerably.
He has promised to “ keep his eye ” on the marble
quarrying and polishing business, also to back
things up in a chairman-like way at certain pro-
posed meetings which are intended to prod into
life the idea of a school of sculpture. At
present there is no school of sculpture in Mel-
bourne. The antique is a recognised founda-
tion for an art school, nevertheless, some
time ago certain short-sighted trustees of
our gallery deliberately cast their antiques adrift.
In a fervor of spring cleaning they put all the
3opies of casts of old masterpieces in a heap, and,
before advertising a sale, offered the suburban
municipalities the first chance of securing the
statues for their parks and gardens. There was
some delay, as the aforesaid municipalities were
shy of anything thrown out so generously. North
Melbourne sent the first delegates, who were
warned impressively to “avoid the naked ones.”
In the demur and wrangling interval Dr. L. L.
Smith stepped in and saved the collection. It is
still owned by the State, and is hidden somewhere
in the vast wastes of the Exhibition Building.
Chamberlain Lord Dick had a birthday on the
12th, and presents rolled in from all and sundry.
Richard, the man of length, gathered his gift
givers in small lots to thanksgiving teas and
tiffins, making sure to separate the alls from the
sundries. But I haven’t heard that he told them
his age last birthday. However, there is a printed
book from which they can glean that historic de-
tail if they wish. It is the sad privilege of a
marquis’ younger son to have the date of his
earthly beginning recorded in a book.
A male person writes from Queenscliff :
After the Christmas and New Year vacations, Queens-
cliff relapses into slumber. Two or three weeks ago
there were moderate festivals—thin, morbid routs and
fancy-dress upheavals—but now the only sounds of ani-
mation are the feeding gongs of the various hostelries,
and the reckless laughter of a “blazered” youth crink-
ling the monkish silence between meals. In these “ off”
times the 'Cliff is mostly the haunt of stout and Chosen
people, gawky girls, dames of extinct beauty, and tall
spinsters gazing at man with the acerbity of embittered
cranes.
The Hugo Wertheim family still adheres to the village.
Hugo is an amateur angler, and is declared to utter fish
lore and shrewd wisdom on schnapper bait even in his
sleep.
An occasional visitor is Alfred Deakin, who destroys his
semi-deity by the restful tone values of his lower hosiery.
Alfte might have been seen, t’other day, upon the local
pier, sitting with the exclusiveness of the mighty—ter-
rible and alone ! His grey-suited frame was hunched
over the English Review, and he was absorbing informa-
tion in large clods. Moreover, Alfie had drawn up his un-
questionable®, disclosing socks that were melodramas in
lurid tan. The top floor of the gentleman—where his in-
tellectuality sizzles on the hob, as it were—was crowned
by a jaunty tuck hat, the hue whereof was the sweet shy
green of pale decomposition. Compared to his socks and
music hiS SUit ° f STey S6rge was like a burst of church
°vz at which is divided from the ’Cliff by a
• f . 0I f, ea ■'hat ls sapphire in sunshine and grey-gloomy
th c summer school is studying nature in all its
a " d manifestations. Excellency Carmichael
ered down in the defence tub Childers one solemn
evemnss and was received by a scratch guard of honor
. jhsed on the spot. He stayed the night, poor man,
?" L earn , fc n ? u< * of the structure of the bark of boot-
t ees and similar arboraceous growths, and was even
s own an opossum that had nested handily for his con-
venience. J
’now art nf™ nl i !i ho , s ? things, there is little doing at the
; 1 ™ bathing is seemingly demodi, and has given
'y a ; v , to Paddling by kids and plump matrons at the fall of
dusk. Also, the frocks that leave dents upon the memory
ay be counted on the fingers of one hand of an armless
man.
w^ ne e ]bourne’s beauty girls, Miss Olive
Witowski, a dewy-eyed brunette, has consented
Mare . meagre ctnst with a London billionaire.
Ine gilded youth is the Son of Tuck and Son, the
P®. opI ® , who Print Christmas cards and things.
Miss Witowski, with her mother and sister, leave
by the Bremen next month, and stay at Bourne-
mouth. Then they go to London to glean the
final trousseau in the fields of fashion. The
maiden is taking Australian-grown fig leaves
mostly, but the dream of a wedding gown is to be
built in Bull parts.
Miss Freda Sternberg, a niece of the gilded
member of the House of Hich Landlords who
bears the same name, travels with the Witowskis.
She is by way of being a brilliant student among
medical people, and will spend some solid time at
the new London Laboratory with a view tostudy-
uuF- ways and means of the alien microbe,
ihis Australian girl should strike London scien-
tists as a particularly youthful and clever recruit.
She is in her early twenties, and was for some
years the right hand man of poor dead Dr.
MMnerney, who put his very soul into experi-
ments in bacteriology.
Dr. Freddie Bird, honorary surgeon to Mel-
bourne Hospital and head surgeon of his own
spic and span private storage place for invalids,
mis gone globe-circling in search of rest and new
ideas. He left by the Marama last week. Bird
is adored by his women patients, and the Mel-
bourne Hospital nurses would let him walk over
their reserve supply of starched caps. He has a
‘way wid him” at an operation, and treats his
assistant nurse to the Glad Eye of thanks as she
hands up the cutlery with which he carves the
sufferer. There are many surgeons who almost
throw the sponge and antiseptics at the young
woman, or treat her like the mechanical thing she
isn’t.
Cameo Mrs. Cornish has returned to her in-
tense, serious spouse after a two years’ stay in
furrin parts. She has developed a Cockney
accent and a rather unbecoming shade of golden
hair, combined with the correct English expression
of countenance. The lady is living up at the
Grand, and tells her friends that only the prospect
of a further trip enables her to withstand the
boredom of Melbourne.
Miss Ethel Bloustein, a St. Kilda smart frocker,
not long out of the flapper stage, lately galvanised
her girl chums into an ecstasy of telephoning and
gush by rushing into a romantic marriage on a
nine hours’ engagement. The girl and her fianci,
one George Josephs of Westralia, had spent much
time in an earlier existence making mud pies
together, or planning the torture of the family cat.
Then the swain departed on a distant wander.
He returned last week, and was so bowled over by
the girl’s grown-up loveliness that he hauled her
along to say ‘ ‘ I will ” in the presence of witnesses
before she had time to mention the suddenness of
the proceeding.
Teddy Bear foolishness grows apace, and
Mrs. Willie Motor Kelly is the latest victim to
the craze. The apathetic post-card beauty fondles
a large brown Bruin with a large green bow as
tenderly as though it were a child. One wishes
for the sake of womanhood that babies would come
into fashion for a change. They can sqeak much
more loudly than the most expensive Teddy, and
their legs and arms move without any outside
assistance. It is a significant fact that the Teddy
Bear craze comes from the United States, where
the human nurseling is a diminishing quantity
among the most dollared classes.
In wanderings for s’mother summer air, our
exalted ones sometimes get to the N.W. Coast of
Tasmania. On the adorable, white-curved
beach of Burnie (or else Devonport) one of our
ones gave lately a convincing act as
Mr. Godiva. He indulged in a canter—then
a bath in the surf. Anon he mounted
his neddy and gave it a swim. A medi-
tating shark came browsing near and scared
the horse, and the steed bolted wildly along
the beach and into the town. Mr. Godiva on its
back was mother-naked, and his military mous-
tache and close-cropped hair offered little cover.
His blushes were also inadequate clothing. At
that fearful moment he would have sold all his
future prospects for a cotton umbrella.
On 27th of next month the Voice is booked to
breathe over Titian-thatched Zephyr Evans—the
lissome Terpsichore of a couple of J.C.W.’s panto-
mimes. The damsel is gorgeously 18, and her
future lord has reached the mature age of 20—
and he is big and strong and wealthy, so it
looks as though Zephyr were still the darling of
the gods.
The food offered to the nurses of a certain hos-
pital continues to be no better than beforehand
by way of expressing their feelings on the subject
several of the girls have had more or less severe
attacks of gastritis. A doctor, incensed at the
state of affairs, described one nurse’s illness as
due to “inadequate hospital food.” The usual
casual inquiry was held into the matter, and just
as casually it dropped into silence and the waste
paper basket; but it is more than time this scandal
was remedied. A girl who has worked in a tone-
lowering, depressing atmosphere for 10 hours at a
stretch needs something more appetising than
tainted mutton. If it were anything but a public
institution the Board of Health would have in-
tervened long ago. There is ample scope for its
interference right now.
Mrs. Fisher follows up “Arcadian Adel-
aide,” the booklet which greatly incensed
those Adelaideians whom it did not amuse, with
another volume entitled “ Dives’ Wife, and Other
Stories.” Melbourne remembers Mrs. Fisher
better as Thistle Anderson —a large, assertive
blonde, who dabbled in journalism and the stage.
The new book is merely “ Thistle ” under various
colored limelights—the lurid scarlet of reckless-
ness, the sombre grey of remorse, the faint maize
of pathetic, injured innocence, with the soft
shadow of “Thistle misunderstood” permeat-
ing everything. At latest, Mrs. Fisher was living
the Simple Life in Kent.
The Glassy Harem, that is wont to moulder in
dim desertion and silence during the Dog Days,
has resolved into a unique show place. The Taits,
who never do things by halves, have invaded it,
and their audiences almost fill its vast wastes day
and night. One end of the structure is built up
as a stage, framed in half-an-acre of conserva-
tory vegetable, and footed with a fifty-power
orchestra. From this background appear theatri-
cal representations of clever mummers in vivid
plays. It is the most modern form of cinemato-
graph film ever seen in Australia. The figures and
scenes are absolutely life size, and the acting is so
good that words are scarcely missed. That master
in staging, Bland Holt, once argued in The Lone
Hand that theatres should depend on early-
time pantomime, and that that which strikes the
eye and conveys sense without words is the prime
necessity of di-ama. Blan’ ’ol’, when choosing
“furrin” productions, would seat himself in the
farthest-back gallery, where it was difficult to
hear, and if that satisfied, he bought the' piece.
In these new films there is no flutter, nor flicker,
nor sense of “moving pictures ” —the movement is
practically on the stage before you. With phono-
graphic attachments, it will soon be quite un-
necessary to rush to London or Paris to see the
Great Ones, or for the Great Ones to straggle
away from their European engagements. This
new departure in films is startling. Modern
moving pictures have been clever, but these are
many strides ahead.
The Glaciarium has the benefit of being com-
fortably big and cool. Tan takes the place where
the ice was wont to be, and the gloom of the high
roof is veiled in stretched tinted muslin, through
which electrics shine softly. One corner of the
vastness has cunning Continental tables for coffee
or cools, and the orchestra discourses sweetly
through a place built for well-balanced sound.
Her Majesty’s pantomime holds its own to the
uttermost breathing space in spite of holidays and
stewing weather, and the panto, principals are
already perking themselves out in new toggery.
Stella Gastelle has cast her tomato-colored abbrevi-
ations for a dinky-dandy, grey rig with a rear coat
basque to “ help out ” the tights. Then in later
life she adds a giddy blue scarf to her silver and
white fittings. Fan Dango Jill shimmers in the
gorgeousness of new silver tissue and brief
drapery. Bert Gilbert seems to have got his
second wind—it might be called his second gale—
after his heat collapse. Widow Campbell gets in
an extra Harry Lauder song that can’t stand
straight, and his-her dress is appreciably added to
by a hatpin that is carried with all the ceremony
of a House mace for wedging on her 15ft.-diameter
hat.
At the other panto., the original Ruth Lincoln
Cinderella has returned to her field and put sister
Tina back in the ballet. The reinvigorated
“ Cinder ” has discarded her short-long party
dress for a magnificent trained thing all satin and
jewels and pages—thereby satisfying the soul and
dramatic instincts of the Small Girl in the house.
The beauteous Bottomley warbles soulfully about
his new girl—or if she be the same old girl she’s
at least in a new song. The Meredro swathes her
supple legs in new wine-color tights and fresh
decoration. Essie Perrin dances a new dance in
the same fascinating cherry toggery.
Hugh Ward and Grace Palotta coo-ee from
India’s nigger strand. The whole company has
been taking turns on the sick list, and its mem-
bers yearn for Australia and more comforting
travelling conditions. They intend to strike
Perth at the end of May and Melbourne some few
weeks later.
Those gentle females, the Besses o’ th’ Barn, are
breathing brazen whispers of another trip to this
land of big booking and triumphal blow. In the
meantime the principal cities might reinforce
their buildings with wire-netted, earthquake-
proof bricks, lest the fate of Jericho, which the
Besses’ forefathers blew down, should fall upon
them.
“Jimmie” Watt, a Melbourne tenor of am-
bitions, who rushed to London for study some time
ago, is making some small clatter in the Fog. It ap-
pears that Jimmie’s legs show as marked flexi-
bility as his throat, and he has been capering
successfully in an old-woman part at Drury Lane
pantomime.
Another local tenor is showing his mettle. Hal
Cohen, big, fat, and fair, throws up a hat that has
grown too small for him in exultation. He joins
a company in Vienna, with Destin as leading man.
Plump Hal is likewise agile and flexible in his
flabby style. He danced not badly for an amateur
when he descended from the lofty heights of
grand ppera to play the giddy old duke of “In
Town at the Princess’s. But Hal’s weakness
was for decorative art in his gentle gambols. He
wanted to wave his fat, white hands heavenwards,
and flutter around, like a premiere danseuse. The
stage manager had to be always imploring him to
remember that he was not a young lady.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

GEORGE J. COHEN, Chairman.
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
W. R. SAYERS, Accountant.
Sydney, 11th'January, 1909.
We hereby certify that we have examined the bills, compared the balances, and counted the coin in the Head
Office of THE COMMERCIAL BANKING COMPANY OF SYDNEY, LIMITED, and have compared the returns of
the branches, and have found the same as specified in the foregoing Balance Sheet.
F. W. HIXSON,
W. L. DOCKER,
j- Auditors.
The following resolutions were carried unanimously.:—
“ That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated among
ttie Proprietors.”
“That the thanks of the Shareholders be presented to the Directors, General Manager, and Officers of the
Bank for their very satisfactory management of the affairs of the institution.”
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
In moving- the adoption of the Report, the Chairman
(Mr. 6. J. Cohen) said :
“ I am pleased to be able to present to you a very satis-
factory Balance Sheet for the half-year just ended, and to
report that the business of the Bank still continues to
show satisfactory expansion.
“ On comparing the figures with those of twelve months
ago, as is customary, it will be seen that our Paid-up
Capital has been increased £242,000 —and I may remark,
in connection with this, that the option of prepayment
has been so largely availed of by the Shareholders that
nearly the whole of the £250,000 fresh Capital authorised
in July last has been paid, although only two instalments
have fallen due.
“ Reserve Fund has been further augmented during the
period by £40,000.
“ Our Note issue is practically unchanged, generally
reaching its maximum at this period of the year, and
Bills in Circulation, a fluctuating item, have gone up
£139,000 ; while our other liabilities to the Public show a
diminution of a little over a quarter of a million.
“ Profit and Loss account shows a gratifying increase of
£19,568.
“The total figures have expanded £173,000.
“ Turning to the credit side, I may point out that,
although our Short Loans in London and holding of
Government Securities have respectively increased in the
period £137,000 and £155,000, our Liquid Assets show a
reduction of £s4s,ooo—which is caused by our having-
more profitably employed our funds in this State by ex-
tending our Advances £728,000.
“ During the last twelve months new banking premises
have been built, or largely extended in seventeen places.
Our Premises Account in the Balance Sheet, however,
shows a reduction of £9ooo—large provisions having been
made for depreciation and repairs.
“ Reserve Funds, with the present appropriation, will
now stand at £1,301,000.
“The proportion of Liquid Assets to our total liabilities
to the Public stands at 9s. lOd. in the £.
“The Unallotted Fractional New Shares, 317 in number,
have been sold as from the Ist instant, and the proceeds
are being divided among the Shareholders interested.
“As stated in the report.it is my sorrowful, duty to
announce the death, in the prime of life, of Mr. Benn
Wolfe Levy, one of the Directors on the London Board.
His loss will be felt by the Bank, as his services were
highly valued.
“ I now move the Report and Statement of Account be
received and adopted and ordered to be circulated among
the Proprietors.”

“Orpheus” writes :
The various subscription-lists that are floating about
the country-side at the present time suggest to me the
Delany memorial list, and the belatedness and general
unsatisfactoriness of it. The attempt to raise a sum
wherewith to perpetuate the memory of the late John Albert
Delany of Sydney, organist, has been in existence now for
over 18 months, and about £BO has been garnered in.
The question of expenditure splits on a rock of contro-
versy as to how the cash is to be laid out. What is
known darkly as “ the St. Mary’s faction ” clamors for a
“ Memorial Pulpit in Gothic brass with canopy resonator
and tablet” in St. Mary’s Cathedral. A big section de-
mands the erection of a marble monument over the dead
musician’s grave at Waverley Cemetery. And there are
those who talk largely of “ establishing a musical scholar-
ship’’with the £BO. To the unbiassed mind the monu-
ment idea seems the most suitable, and if the subscribers
were given an opportunity of voting in some Hall other
than that owned by him who is the Bane of Dill, they
might decide that way. Anyhow, they should be given a
chance to do something in the matter.
The awful London Graphic surely reached
the apex and pinnacle of snobbishness in its issue
of November 28, wherein is printed a huge
double-paged drawing of a Cabinet Minister’s
“reception.” The dreadful picture is labelled,
“ All sorts and conditions of men : a Cabinet
Minister’s wife ‘at home ’ to supporters of the
Government.” And it shows what is supposed
to be a Labor member (but is more like an orang-
outang or the missing link in evening clothes) and
his wife shaking hands with the hostess. ~The
Labor member’s wife is a coarse, fat, double-
chinned monstrosity, with big earrings ; and they
both look as much out of place as a butcher in a
beehive. The Cabinet Minister’s wife is, of
course, a dream of beauty, and all around are the
Hite (as the Graphic loves to call them) of the
land. One haughty dame is regarding the Labor
pair very disdainfully through an eyeglass, and
at the door stands one of the buttresses of Old
England’s greatness, a powdered footman in knee-
breeches. .To make the insult quite complete,
and to give it a final polish, as it were, the
Graphic writes underneath :
Such an event as the arrival of the Labor member and
his wife, shown in our illustration, has become a more
and more frequent one, though smiles and upliftings of
eyebrows may still greet their entry into a company with
whom they cut a somewhat incongruous figure.
And the long-suffering British working class
didn’t break the Graphic’s windows.
Only lately, says Adelaide Register
(21/l/’O9), one of the Sydney dailies was writing of
marvellous escapes, and wondering if a certain
baby was still alive—the one who, in March 1874,
was picked up out of a smashed buggy by a train
at Alberton (S. A.) and carried half a mile on the
cow-catcher without being injured. He was alive
when inquired for, but he isn’t now. He was the
J. A. Crocker who was killed at Mount Magnet
(W. A.) on December 26. Fate missed him before
he had scored, so to speak, but waited patiently
and caught him out —again in a carriage accident
after an interval of nearly 35 years.
“Boswell” on a joint in “ Bloggs’”
armor :
With reference to the N.S.W. Chief Justiceship and
Premier Wade’s aspirations, I feel aggrieved at one
admission by “ Bloggs” in his otherwise admirable sum-
mary of the position. He states that "as a puisne Judge
Wade may pass, because there he could concur,” etc.
Surely “ Bloggs” is aware that a puisne Judge sits oftener
in solitary grandeur than in the full-wigged assembly,
and the issues put before him are often as great as any
that the C. J. is called upon to unravel. Take the records
of Owen, Cohen, and Pring, for instance. Not only is
Wade totally unfit to be a puisne Judge, but a District
Court appointment would be far too high for a person
who has proved himself over and over again to be an
absurd adviser, a man Of violent prejudices, narrow and
bitter, and of hideous temper and crude manners. The
State has found his office as Attorney-General an expen-
sive failure, the pathway thereto being littered with the
grinning skeletons of what no doubt appeared to him at
their inception as healthy, robust infants, certain to come
into their own. The suggestion of a puisne judgeship
sounds like the voice of Balaam, or Holman, but quite un-
like the voice of “ Bloggs.” A person of the Wade stamp
—big in little things, and little in big things—is far
better in private life than elsewhere. Therefore, let us
pray—“ That the Wade Government be defeated by hook
or by crook within twelve calendar months.” Amen.
Yic. Premier Murray, in his policy state-
ment at Warrnambool, was very indefinite upon
the all-important subject of graduated land taxa-
tion, but he was mightily frank upon his intention
to borrow money. He was going to Cohen at the
“first favorable opportunity,” he said, and prob-
ably would go to Cohen for a substantial amount.
It’s wonderful how the Murray type of politician
can hurry to Cohen at “the first favorable
opportunity,” and it’s more wonderful how soon
the opportunity becomes favorable.

At a dinner at the opening of the first Inter-
national Rubber Exhibition in London lately, it was
seated that 520,000 acres have been planted with rubber
trees in “ the East,” and that the output from them will
within seven years equal the whole world’s present pro-
duction. Then there will be a glut of the article, it will
come down to 2s. per lb.—and will pay at that—and
streets may advantageously and economically be paved
with it! Meanwhile, Dr. Doeherty, an English chemist,
is producing an artificial substance that seems to have
“ all the elements and qualities of rubber.” The chief
objection to it is the appalling smell given off when it is
in process of manufacture ; but Doeherty has hopes of
slaving even that enemy.

“ J.G.” : Isn’t it up to somebody to advocate
bringing “ the backbone of the country ” under the Pure
Poods or some other Act, such as the one which compels
grocers to show how much ground brick is in their coffee ?
At the present time lots of Victorian cookies are busy
ramming wild oats, wheat husks and other rubbish into
wheat bags along w-ith some wheat, and selling the whole
lot as wheat of fair average quality. Most of the w'heat
cookies can produce a good, clean sample if they want
to, as the harvesting machines have devices for clean-
ing the grain and rejecting wild oats and other rubbish,
and a few of the farmers do try to produce a good sample.
But the miserable part of “the backbone’’covers over
the cleaning screens, etc., so that the weed seeds and so
on cannot get through! and the whole lot goes into the
bags with the clean wheat. These dirty cookies say that,
as wheat is worth 3s. 6d. per bushel, and the rubbish is
worth nothing-, they would be tools to chuck the rubbish
away when they can get 3s. 6d. per bushel for it by merely
letting it get into the bags with the good grain. Vet
they would be quite insulting if you said they were as bad
as the alleged gold thieves who, according to Worrvall
infest Bendigo. J *

“ Quan ” : Re Australian arrowroot cultivation.
Some years ago the white variety (Maranta arundinacea)
was extensively grown at Norfolk Island ; but as the
grinding had to be done by hand, the area under cultiva.
tion has got down to something only a little above zero.
The Melanesian Mission on the Island is, however, giving
the business a fresh start. A few weeks ago it dug its
crop, which filled nearly 70 sacks. From this, slightly
over half a ton of arrowroot was made in a few hours in
the Mission’s new mill, driven by an oilengine. The Nor-
folkers were given the use of the mill to grind their little
bit, and the rapidity of the manufacturing process im.
pressed them so much that they say they will plant a
great deal for next year’s harvest. The Norfolk product
is as good as the best Bermuda baby-food.

“U.”: I was giving a pal a hand in opening
his new- ham-and-beef business in a Melbourne suburb!
and was temporarily left in charge, when a man arrived
from a pickle-factory. “ What sort o’ pickles shall we
send?” he inquired. “Factory or home-made?”
“ Why,” I said, “ I thought yours was purely a fac-
tory business. Do you get supplies of home-made
from distressed gentlewomen, or what?” “Oh,
no,” he replied. “ It’s merely a matter of leaving
off the labels. Less trouble for us, and often
helps a retailer to sell more than he otherwise would.
To add realistic detail you can cut strips out of old exer-
cise books of the kiddies, and paste them on the bottles
with ‘Real Home-made’ written on them in faint ink.
If you want to be extra convincing, it’s best to leave
little bits of the parsing and analysis or compound long
division showing.” This advice was followed, with the
result that my friend has done a roaring business in
“ Real Home-made ” ever since, and has often been com-
plimented on its superiority to “ that factory stuff."

“Spring ”: Have you ever felt yourself shrewd,
calm, contented, a cut above the usual unthinking fellow,
a perfect tin god, also a devil in a white vest and
fashionable belltopper, hose, and a fragrant blucher cigar,
turning up your nose at Ways and means, living in the
present, and romancing on the past? Did you ever feel
that you could gaze upon and sneer at the
bustle, hurry-scurry, tremendous worry, stampede,
riot, fluster, anxiety, alarm, consternation, sweat,
heat, dismay, and collapse of the inadequately
remunerated, wretched, flabby, discontented, obfus-
cated, sodden, wife-and-kid-haunted multitude ? Did
you ever stand at the bar and inwardly scorn
the customers, stale, beery, verbose, unending, meander-
ing, side-tracked, uncouth, humorless, time-absorbing,
unpayable, silly, rotten, high-strung, gin-inspired and
damnable, and listen to their yarns anent everything and
nothing, what time the publican, boss, serang, tyrant or
pasha, glowered, sniffed, scoffed, and rang the cow-bell at
the cash-register, profit-teller, typewriter affair or infernal
machine? Have you ever felt in that pink, red, tomato-
colored or sunset condition, and suddenly realised that
you were only a plain, common, garden-stuff mug, fool,
idiot, ass, caterpillar, or lost, stolen or strayed? I went
to the flat at Randwick t’other day, and invested
profitably on the first race. I put down the necessary
small coin at the bar for a drink to celebrate the victory.
To my amazement, the flustered barman soon after
slapped 9s. 6d. in silver alongside my beer. I pityingly
let it lie there. An old sport with a lot of whiskers in
his beard turned pale and bis pockets out to see whether
he bad given 10s. for a sixpence. An unkempt, bright-
eyed devil alongside told me to grab it and get, and mur-
mured that he’d share alike. Him I resisted, for the
copybook told me not to be dishonest.* After some dis-
pute, the flustered barman slapped the change back on the
cash-record. The unkempt one whispered that he would
claim, and in an authoritative tone demanded his change.
It was forthcoming to him. As we both turned away he
held a half-dollar to me. The Devil tempted me and I
fell, or dropped, or did a thud. I felt a cowardly thief and
foolish, because I could have had the greater, and I took
the less. Soon after I burst into an exhaustive fit of blue
profanity and red curses, for I discovered it was my 10s.
that I had presented in mistake for a sixpence. I thought
the 10s. was in another pocket, and it wasn’t.
THE MONUMENTAL MASON’S.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
There’s a monumental mason’s round the corner of the
street—
You’ll know it by the trolley-rails that span it—
Where I’ve often stopped and listened to the clinking
music sweet,
Of the hammers and the chisels on the granite.
There I’ve watched the pinioned angel-shapes emerging
from the stone,
And the emblems of the souls for ever winging—
The wreathfed urns, symbolic of the spirits that have
flown —
And the cherubs in the frozen act of singing.
The monumental mason is a cheery little chap,
And he whistles as he chisels in inscriptions ;
lie is versed in “ In Memoriams ” for Mussulman or Jap,
And the formulas for Germans or Egyptians.
“ Hie jacet, Andrew Johnson, cetat X.” his steel in-
scribes,
Or “ In Memoriam, Bedelia Clancy
From “ llequiescat in Pace ” quite a humor he imbibes,
But mostly “ 1.H.5." belikes his fancy.
But the music—it’s the music that I like to stop and
hear,
“ Tinka tinka, chunka chunka, tonk 1 ” it warbles ;
And the tenors of the basalts strike like liquid to the ear
With the basses of the freestones and the marbles.
The mendacious hands of kindred in theirgilded, bevelled
scripts,
Make the deeds of Tom or Bill extremely solemn ;
And the dear departed scamps await out yonder in their
crypts
While the mason scrolls their fame upon a column.
“Ohinka chinka, tinkle tinkle, tunka tonk!” I hear it
go—
Whether you be shabby Jack or splendid Jason,
You will slumber all the sounder in your little crib below
For the music of the monumental mason 1

NOTIONS
N.S.W. Cricket Association has not reaped
much of a harvest from inter-State cricket this year.
The S.A. visit panned out a profit of £386, and that
against Bananaland yielded £B7 10s.; so unless the cur-
rent match pays up handsomely the prospect is far from
financially gay 7. The Association has a balance of only
£639 9s. 7d., and that includes the grant of £5OO made by
the bloated Cricket Ground Trustees early in the season.
It is the awful crowd of deadhead members that is killing
the N.S.W. Cricket Association, and that body 7 should
represent to the Cricket Ground people the advisability—
the urgent necessity 7, in fact—of the Association receiving
a portion of the revenue from season tickets. Till it does
that it will continue to struggle in a financial bog.

The cricket mutineers threw in the towel of
defeat on Friday night last. “The Players” held their
last meeting, and although all official communications
are refused, it is understood that one prominent
ringleader spoke very bitterly. He admitted that they
were “up against it,” and the time had come to get in
out of the wet. Unless something like a general sur-
render took place, and quickly at that, another crowd of
“ players ” would be chosen, and their own names would
be Mud. Then they surrendered en masse.
* * » *
“B.” : Victor Trumper, who has been given a
safe seat in the next Australian XI., did not play in one
Sheffield Shield match during the season, and did but
little in Sydney grade cricket. On what performances,
then, was he chosen? Trumper was a great cricketer
years ago ; and if, as The Bulletin alleges (21/l/’O9), he
has not been ill, then the Australian selection committee
deserves to be soundly kicked for selecting Trumper at
all. Trumper’s selection isn’t justice to the y'ounger
men who are battling for a position, and cricket is
certain to suffer if players are chosen on past perform-
ances—as Trumper has been on this occasion.
Bananaland cricketer C. Simpson, who is well
up in the running for a place in the Australian XL, raised
a respectable total of 150 not out in Brisbane on Satur-
day. Roger Hartigan (of the XI.) also made 113. Simpson
will play with the Rest of Australia against the Chosen
before the final team is plucked from the garden of Aus-
tralian cricket.

The final inter-State cricket match between
N. S. Wales and Victoria commenced at Sydney Cricket
Ground on Saturday, and the remarkable features of the
show were Bardsley’s performances. He smashed and
wore out four bats, and piled up 192. He only gave one
chance, and then Ransford, who had bowled, caught him
slickly. His innings lasted 4hrs. 26min., and his score
included one sixer and 29 fours. Hopkins vanished for
21, and Cotter made 13. Noble, imagining the ball was
McElhone and the Board of Control, smote furiously, and
smashed and drove till 127 stood to his credit, and the
first day ended with N.S.W. 365 for the loss of three
wickets. On Monday Noble continued and when Saunders
bowled him had accumulated 213. Sydney Gregory came
on the scene and also went baresark, leaving 179 behind
him, when Ransford disposed of him with a clean fast one.
Gregory lasted 3hr. 22min. and hit 26 fours. It was a
terrible day for the Victorian bowlers. Evidently they
were still feeling lightheaded over the loss of Bent. At
the close of play the Walers were still going strong, and
had made 811 for the loss of nine wickets. Next morning
they brought the score up to 815, and at that point things
finished. Among the Victorian bowlers who took wickets
the average number of runs per wicket captured were :
Ransford, 30£ ; Armstrong, 52 ; Laver, 113 ; Hazlitt, 129 ;
Vernon, 154 ; and Saunders, 178. They were all costly.
Then Victoria borrowed the hat and started to shake
things up in its turn. When this paper went to press on
Tuesday night the men from Murray 7 ’s State had scored
169, and only one wicket—Carroll’s—was down.
* * * *
Owing to the neglected state of the weather,
which was extremely ragged and disreputable on Satur-
day, most of the contests for the Melbourne cricket
pennant had to be abandoned. This robbed one or two
teams of fairly certain victories on the first innings, but
made no difference to Fitzroy and Northcote, which had
already defeated their opponents, Collingwood and Uni-
versity respectively, on the previous Saturday. The only
match to be resumed was that between P’ran and Stoush
Melbourne. P’ran, with 338 for live wickets down, de-
clared its innings closed when the struggle was continued
at 4.45 p.m., and rocked down nine of Stoush’s sticks for
82. Stoush thus avoided the ignominy of a first innings
defeat with a wicket to spare.
Melbourne Age— acting possibly in the interests
of its noble “sportsman ” friend, Jack Wren—is making
a considerable noise about “the recrudescence of the
betting evil” in Melbourne, an evil that never caused the
virtuous newspaper any sleepless nights what time the
Collingwood Tote and other pestilent gambling shops
were defying the Law. The evil which has recrudesced is
the same old private and confidential s.p. betting that
tends to keep inveterate punters from attending Wren’s
racecourses and paying for the privilege of eye-
witnessing the lovely “sport” on which they risk
their money in town. These infatuated speculators
have some reason for supposing that they reduce
their losses by not going down to the course,
and undoubtedly 7 they spare themselves a lot of incidental
expenses and a good deal of close contact with rascality.
As far as it concerns only the punters, who would attend
the petty pony and “mixed” race meetings if they
couldn’t “ get their money on ” at certain places in town,
the evil is not a matter for national regret. Regarded as
an inducement to betting on the part of less inveterate
punters, these city shops—or offices, as they mostly ap-
pear to he—deserve all the suppression they can get.
The police are not dishonest in saying that some of the
offices are practically self-protected from the Law.
The bookmaker bets only with people whom he knows
as bona - fide customers. If the would-be in-
former comes to him with money in his hand
the proffered investment is refused. The gambling is
almost as private as a game of poker in the house of a
learned Judge. All that the police can do in the matter
is to lodge a complaint with the Government Department
that supplies telephone service for the convenience of the
s.p. bookmaker, if the Department hasn’t already done
its duty to the Law by cutting the subscriber off. The
Age seems to have forced the ’Phone Department
into mild action, anyway 7 . The shops have been
cut off the service in some cases, though the Depart-
ment might more easily 7 have dismissed the Age’s grievance
by refusing a ’phone to Wren’s racecourses, whence
the information as to “ scratchings,” starters, and latest
betting is persistently issued. But it was not against
Wren’s racecourses the Age felt aggrieved, notwithstand-
ing the fact that they 7 are the most frequent sources of
the betting evil in Melbourne. Its indignation turned in
the direction of the V.R.0., whose management has often
suffered (in the Age columns) by 7 indirect comparison
with the keen, enterprising, vigilant, and altogether beau-
tiful administration of Wren’s pony 7 meetings. “Any
stay-at-home bettor has only to do the Block on any
afternoon of a suburban race day 7, and he can
put on his fiver or tenner with bookmakers who
are conspicuous figures at headquarters. And yet the
V.R.C. looks on passively and complacently. . . . This
is another example of the masterful inertia observed by
the governing body in controlling the affairs of the Turf
generally.” To the uninformed public this and similar
stuff may be acceptable reading, but it makes this writer
very sick. The V.R.C. has no more authority to interfere
with the town betting transactions of the bookmakers it
licenses than the Age has. If these men who law-
fully bet (under the Act) on licensed racecourses are
betting unlawfully in town, it is the Law’s busi-
ness to put a stop to their law-breaking.
There are two Acts of Parliament for the
control of gambling in Victoria, so the Law is double
barrelled. The Postal Department can refuse to deliver
letters and telegrams addressed to the offices of recog-
nisedlay 7 ers of the odds, and what is sauce for Tattersalls,
the biggest odds-layer of them all, should be sauce for
bookmakers. The police can prosecute a man for keep-
ing a gaming-house, or booking ready-money wagers in
the street, and if he be convicted it is presumably “up
against” his license, but in the meantime the V.R.C. is not
supposed to put detectives on his track to discover his
alleged offences against the Law. For that matter, the
V.R.O. management is no longer in favor of the
system of licensing bookmakers. The club would
prefer that the totalisator should be legalised on its race-
course, and Ikey 7 Mo illegalised—but the Government
thus far has refused this reform.
* * * *
The undoubted increase in starting-price bet-
ting and in other and shadier forms of gambling led
Melbourne Age to speak severely thereon on 19th
January. Commenting on the growth of betting shops,
it said:—
“We are assured that a very substantial business is
being done, and that the Gambling Act is being evaded in
a most flagrant manner.”
It is. On the following day (20th January) this advertise-
ment crept into a back page of the same paper :
TO-NIGHT.
Flemington Running Grounds,
The Home of Good, Clean Sport.
Sheffield Handicap, of £6 10s. 67 Entries.
Boxing Competition, of £25, etc.
Admission Is. Open Betting. North Melbourne
trams. *
Advertisements of “open betting” constitute just as
flagrant a breach of the Gambling Act as the betting does.
That hardened and incurable dodger of the law at whom
the Age hinted is evidently 7 the Age itself.
Neith’s success in the Challenge Stakes at the
A.J.O. meeting on Saturday 7 brought her record up to
six wins and a second in seven starts, and stamps the
Holbrook-Cleopatra mare a high-class animal indeed.
She topped the weight list with lOst. 21b., and the next
starter to her had a stone less, while some of the field
were £cwt. lower down. It is told that Neith’s dam was
put to a coach horse once, and threw a filly 7 to him, but
more aristocratic mating resulted in first-class progeny.
Cleopatra was sold at the break-up of the Tocal stud
in 1901, and bought for 60gns. by Neith’s breeder
and owner, Mr. T. A. Harris. Queenie’s Court, who won
the same race two .years ago, was a well-backed starter
for Saturday’s Challenge Stakes, and when leading the
field to the distance looked a certainty, but she couldn’t
see the pace out. Betting on the race was peculiar, and
should have attracted official attention. The night before
Lord Beauchamp was at 3 and Neith4tol, but on the
course, while Neith shortened to 7 to 4, Lord Beauchamp
lengthened to 10 to 1, and had the race been delayed a
while longer Christian Moses, in a paroxysm of liberality,
might have allowed t he fatuous punter to write any odds
he liked on his ticket.
ALEC WICKHAM'S BIRD-LIKE FLIGHT
FROM A HEIGHT OF 60ft.
Another whilom Australian top-notch nag has
almost been given away in England. F.J.A., winner of
the V.R.C. 1903 Derby, was sold, the other da3 7 , for 50gs.,
and ex-Australian trainer, J. G. Brewer, loaded himself
with the cast-off. Yet they say there’s no sentiment
in a horsey man’s make.

Young Gray began badly in his Melbourne
match with Lindrum at Alcock’s Room. Their form for
the first four da3 r s showed the elder boy to be fully 35 in
100 better than his recent conqueror. Even on the fourth
day, when Gray put up a break of 339 (making 321 off the
red ball), he scored only 1135 points in all against Lin-
drum’s 1332. Judging from the champion’s steady dis-
play of superiority up to then, anyone would just now
back him to give Gray a start of 3000 in 16,000. In the
Melbourne game he is conceding only 2000 points, and,
unless he goes off in the same degree that Gray 1 comes on,
during the present week, he should win easily.

The S. M. Herald has found a new use for the
State. It points out that the citizen of over 40 who
wants to play bowls can only do so by joining the local
bowling club. Now (1) he can’t perhaps afford to join ;
(2) he mightn’t like the crowd at the club ; and (3) there
mightn’t be any 7 club. So the Herald looks with favor
on a scheme whereby the municipal councils should lay
out bowling greens on which the ratepayer could have a
game whenever he felt disposed to part up 2d. The
paper reckons that there would not be much money
made out of the scheme ; more probably there would be
a considerable loss. Which is the Herald’s reason for
urging that Socialism and' not Private Enterprise should
take on the job.

The Dunlop Rubber Co. has definitely decided
upon the course of the Adelaide to S.ydney relay 7 cycle ride.
Leaving. Adelaide the couriers will strike for Wellington,
via Aldgate and Strathalbyn, cross the Murray per punt,
and make for Meningie. The Coorong Desert will be
entered at McGrath’s Flat, and the 78 miles of sandhills
between the Flat and Kingston constitute the worst part
of the journey. This dreary stretch will be negotiated by
several members of the Mount Gambier cycle club, and
they will spend the previous week exploring for the
best track. Special gold medals will be awarded
the Coorong riders on account of the extra-long spell
between drinks. Thence through Mount Gambier into
Victoria and away to Casterton, where Grant Hervey
writes poetry about stars and battleships. After that,
the cyclists take the shortest cut to Melbourne and then
light out for Albury, thence to Germanton, Adelong and
Gundagai to Yass, over the Razorback to Camden, and
through Liverpool to Sydney. Harry James starts out
next month in his trusty old De Dion to erect sign-
boards along the various tracks, so that riders shall not by
any chance miss each other.

Paul Guignard, the French cycling pace follower
whose record was wiped out by Boj'-of-the-Bulldog-Breed
Willis at Munich last year, is. coming again. Willis’s
61 miles 905yds. for the hour is a dizzy thing to attack,
but the beating of it means so many fat bonuses from
manufacturers and others that Guignard will balance his
life on his handle bars and take the risks. He and Hoff-
man, his pacemaker, have gone to Munich to attack the
record on the fastest track in the world for pace-making.
F. S. Hagney, a mighty wheeler before the
Lord, is out after the scalp of Arnst, and proposes sooner
or later to trim his garment with the beard of Barry and
any other old sculler who may get in the road. Hagney
can see no reason why he should not do even as Dick
Arnst has. He is of similar build and about equal
muscular strength. He has started rowing under the
supervision of Harry Pearce, and at present is to be seen
every morning propelling the thing for six or eight miles.
More unlikely things than Hagney will yet shine in the
sculling world. It is his ambition to bring the cham-
pionship back to Australia—a very laudable desire.
Next month will—provided A. H. Shepherd,
the man who mopped most of the Austral meeting prize-
money, keeps his word—see pace-following revived in
N.S.W. Shepherd proposes to chase De Fraga’s 7-h.p.
racing motor round Sydney Cricket Ground till he breaks
either his neck or sundry Australasian paced track
records. The particular times he is said to have his eye
on are W. McDonald’s 20sec. for the quarter-mile, and
42sec. for the half-mile ; and Py r e’s lmin. 25sec. for the
mile—all made from flying starts. There are several
others from the standing start, but the aforementioned
will take the most beating. De Fraga can pace up to 55
miles an hour, so, if Shepherd can keep up to him, the
job is done.

The motor record between Adelaide and Mel-
bourne is 38 hours’ actual running time for the 584 miles,
three days gross, and was accomplished by Mr. R. A.
Duncan, of Adelaide, in April, 1904. These figures Mr.
Barr Smith, a well-known Adelaide whizzer, proposes to
reduce by means of a 60-h.p. six-cylinder Napier early in
February. Unless the sand-drifts of the infernal Coorong
Waste interfere, Mr. Smith should do the trip in about
30 hours. He will be accompanied by Murray Aunger,
the Adelaide-Port Darwin motorist.

The most amazing feature of the last day of the
Australasian Swimming Championships meeting, which
concluded in Sydney on Saturday last, was the excite-
ment of the officials. They fixed tables for the press, and
then crowded in front of the writers, so that the press could
see nothing. Scribes and photographers had to fight like
wild beasts with officials and non-participating swimmers
to get a view or a snap. During the four years that will
elapse before the championships are decided in Sydney
again, the Association should make its officials study the
art of being calm, and instruct them in the serenity of
Vere de Vere and the indifference of Johnson. This bad
management accounts for the dreary accounts of the
proceedings in the local press. Reporters can’t write
decently and at the same time claw officials and raving
swimmers out of their way.
On the previous Saturday Cecil Healy won the
100yds. blue ribbon of Australasia in 58Jsec. This was
dead slow. Apparently Healy, who won by 3yds., found
he was doing the trick easily 7, and did not attempt to
break any times. It was IJsec. slower than Healv’s own
time in 1907, when he did the same distance in 57sec. in
Rushcutters Bay 7 ,; and it was a snail’s pace compared
to Daniels’ 55 2-ssec. at Manchester in September, 1907.
Beaurepaire won the half-mile, paddling home with
40 ghastly yards to spare in l'lmin. 36 2-ssec. Kieran’s
time for the distance was llmin. 2 l-ssec., put up at Bel-
fast (Ireland) in 1905. On the evening of Wednesday
following Cecil Healy came out to defend his 220yds.
championship. But he was up against Beaurepaire and
never had a hope. The youthful Victorian glode away
from him, and won by 4Jyds. in 2min. 30 3-ssec. Like the
rest of the times at this degenerate meeting this was also
dead slow. Kieran, at Brisbane in 1905, did it in
2min. 28 2-ssee. Fred Lane did it in a fifth of a
second more at Weston super Mare, which curiously
named place is in Bull-land. On Saturday last
the interest, of course, circled round the 440yds.
championship. This Beaurepaire already held, having
won it at Perth at the last meeting in sm. 28 2-ssec. This
time he again won it, but it was dead slow compared to his
Perth victory. On Saturday he took smin. 33sec. to tra-
verse the distance, with Hardwicke and Cecil Heal} 7 , of
N.S.W., second and third in that order. The world’s
record for the same distance is still the smin. 19sec. put
up by the mighty dead Kieran, on April 1, 1905, at
Lavender Bay, Sydney.
The result of the scramble is that the Kieran
Shield remains with Victoria, that distressful State hav-
ing secured it through Beaurepaire winning the 220, 440,
880, and mile. The 220yds. breaststroke went to West-
ralia through the agency of E. Finlay, who won by a
yard in 3min. 17 l-sth sec. P. Matson, of Westralia, the
holder of the title, did not compete.
“Bogey’s” victories were far from popular
among swimmers. They declare that “ Bogey ” is suffer-
ing from an affection that is likely to cause "an increase
in his expenditure for hats. But if it is true, “Bogey”
has really nothing to feel particularly elated over. He is
the best of the bunch, but compared to those that have
gone before it is an inferior bunch. The swimming part
of the business was not in it compared with the diving,
and Alec Wickham’s bird-like flight from the 60ft. plat-
form of the tower was a great and gorgeous performance
worth going far to see. He swooped down like a bird,
entered the water clean as an arrow, and covered himself
with glory.
* * * *
Thoroughgood’s backers are a most objectionable
crowd. As long as big Benjamin rows on the Raymiond
Terrace course he can get hacking, but when he proposes
to make his going on the Parramatta, his hackers refer
him to “the Sydney push ” for his stake. And at pre-
sent big Ben is having a hard time collecting the stake of
£lOO for the match with Harry Pearce. The Raymond
Terrace crowd is not in sport for the love of athletics,
but merely for the sake of pushing business in its own
little backyard.

Saturday was a fearsome day on Port Jackson.
A nasty succession of violent squalls from west-sOuth-
west ploughed up the water and got lots of small craft
under the furrows thereof. And, curiously enough, the
local skippers had the most trouble ; the visitors came
through comparatively unscathed. It was the deciding
day of the Australasian Dingh3 7 Championship, and the
visiting boats annexed all the money and the honors.
Roche’s Elma, representing Westralia, beautifully rigged
and splendidly handled, romped home an easy winner
with over a minute to spare against the Botany boat,
Air Motor. The other placed boats were Euchre,
also of Botany (third), and Emelene, of Queens-
land. The Port Jackson boats were mostly under water.
The Queenslanders made a good show, and would probably
have done better had their craft not been over-canvased.
This deprived them of a lot of elbow-room. St. George,
winner of Botany the week before, turned turtle off
Bradley’s Head. Then Vega, Ida, and Violet did likewise,
so that out of a flotilla of 14 four went under during the
run. W. M. Ford, in his motor launch, was the boss saver
of the day. He careered round the harbor at a great
pace, hauling the swamped mariners out of the wet. But
it was not only the racing boats that went under. Al\
over the water steamers were seen suddenly altering their
courses and bearing down on shipwrecked boatmen" some
of whom were in a very exhausted state when fished out.
Yankee bruise promoters have a little way of
stealing one another’s matches by the simple expedient
of raising the price to both men. 'Coffroth grabbed the
Ketchel-Papke third scrap from his brother Gleason
And great was the fall of Coffroth. He hung up a purse
worth 20,000 dollars, paid away 800 dollars advertising
and some hundreds more in incidental exes, and took
18,321 dollars at the gates.

the spectator.” It
does. But what is
the matter with a
simple regulation
making the (inten-
tional) clinch as
dead as the spot-
stroke, or as—to
come nearer home
—the wrestle-and-
throw? Clinching
is either (1) a relic
of the wrestle-and-
throw, and should
have perished with
it ; or (2) a rather
ridiculous way of
evading punish-
ment. Either way
it is a thing to be
wiped out by box-
ing- law. Without it, fights would not last nearly as
long, but they would be infinitely better worth watching
while they lasted. I can foresee a time when the wilful
hugging of one’s opponent will be thought as foolish as
kissing him, and as unlawful as biting him.
* * * *
.Johnson is the first colored bruiser to hold the
championship of the world, and already they are talking
of his wiping out. Kaufmann is looked upon as the man
who will wreck Johnson’s halo, and the Yankees give the
colored gen’lman about a year or so in which to accumu-
late dollars with his championship. Kaufmann is aged
just 23, and in another year will be in his fighting
prime. Already he is a bigger, heavier and tallerman than
Johnson, and when the eminent black Methodist meets
that white giant we shall see what sort of a losing fight he
can put up. In the meanwhile Johnson, as soon as his
theatrical engagement is over, will leave here for Van-
couver and proceed to London, where he fights Langford at
the National Sporting Club on Derby Day. If Lang, who is
now busy training at Botany, should down Boshter Bill
on February 3, manager Kirkpatrick will take him to the
U.S.A. and pit him against Kaufmann. Manager Kirk-
patrick is not impressed with the present stock of bruis-
ing Australians, and picks out Thorne as about the only
one who would do really well if he went to the States,
the place where the working pug can always make a
decent living. When Johnson arrives in England we
shall hear something more about that possible second
engagement with Burns. Johnson hates Burns, but the
purse that will be put up will probably make him forget
his dislike.

It is now said that Ketehel lost his second
fight with William Papke, “ the Illinois Thunderbolt,”
through over-indulgence in pleasure and neglect of train-
ing. In fact, he is said to have trained mostly on
sparkling wine and dull female society ; and when he got
into the ring Papke rushed him and smote so hard and
often that Ketehel was beaten before be' knew exactly
that the. scrap had started. When they met the third
time Ketehel was in splendid condition. He had been
training most religiously, sleeping in the open air, and
before his well-planned, deliberate and sustained attack
William Papke simply withered out. It was Ketehel all
the way, and when Papke tried to hug, Ketehel pushed
him off and banged him all round the ship.
The Maoriland amateur athletic world is seeth-
ing with sedition, untrustworthiness. and secession.
Everybody has resigned from everyone else, and all is
chaos and curse. An attempt is being, made to patch
up a new Maoriland Amateur Athletic Council of
Otago, Southland and Wellington, and as the three pro-
vinces have agreed for a few days, there is a possibility of
success for the new body. In fact, in all branches of
amateur sport in Maoriland there is little animation ; and
the absence of Maoriland athletes from the Australian
swimming championships at Sydney is attributed to this
decadence. Maoriland is about ripe for a general sport
reformation.

There’s coin in the show horse business. Mr.
0. McColl, of Wangaratta(Vic.), has had representativesat
35 New South Wales and Victorian shows. With Highland
Laddie he gathered 51 firsts and 41 second prizes, totalling
£4Ol 18s. Fairfield’s 29 firsts and 21 seconds swelled the
McColl banking account by £135 155.; and Bonnie Doon,
Heather Bell and Lady Francis (together) got away with
91 prizes, representing £316 in good current coin of the
realm. Atop of all that Mr. McColl gazes upon a side-
board ornamented by £5O worth of trophies collected
through the same agency.
COSTIVENESS.
THE CAUSE OF MUCH SUFFERING.
To maintain a healthy system the bowels should
operate at least once every 24 hours. This is one of
Nature’s provisions which is too often ignored, and
the result is untold suffering. Women are the
greatest offenders, but sooner or later they must
pay the penalty. Many women’s ailments are due
to the straining and purging, following upon habit-
ual constipation, and in many cases displacement
of the pelvic organs may be attributed to the same
cause.

“I have used Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills for some
considerable time for con-
stipation and headaches,
and found great relief.
They are our family medi-
cine, and I recommend
them to my friends. You
have my sanction to use
this testimony in what-
ever way you please.”
Nature often requires a
little assistance, and if this
assistance is given at the
first indication much dis-
tress and suffering mav
be averted. Mothers, especially, should guard the
health of their children, and inculcate regular
habits from infancy.
As a family remedy for costiveness Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills have a wide reputation. They
are mild in their action, causing neither weakness
or sickness, and do not gripe.

G. B. Simpson is, in one sense, the last man
in N.S.W. who should have undertaken the chair-
warming job of a year’s Acting-Chief Justiceship.
He has ever been a finicking stickler for the
doing of the correct thing. When at the Bar he
repeatedly declined to accept an acting position,
even when Chief Justice Martin, suddenly
stricken with illness, begged him to take his
place. “G. B. ”is recognised by the profession
to be the arbiter in all matters pertaining to right
and proper conduct in manner, attitude, dress, etc.
He has hardly ever done “the wrong thing.”
He resigned a District Court Judgeship in the long
ago because the salary then was only £lOOO per
annum, without pension; and when, largely
through his advocaev. the salary was increased bv
Parliament to £l5OO (plus a pension), and the
Stuart Government again offered him the same
billet, he declined it. His ground was that,
having been instrumental in producing the good
thing, it would be indecent for him to seize it. A
Crown Prosecutor once told “G. 8.” while Attor-
ney-General that he “ got five convictions out of
six ”at a certain assizes. “ I never employed him
again,” said the Judge years after, “because I
thought a man who could speak so was unfit for
the position/’ That humane viewpoint revolted
the Windeyers of those days, but it was the equit-
able and sane one all the same.
The lawyer gets increasingly scarce in Vic.
Assembly. Besides Speaker Madden, who only
saved his seat by 11 votes, but four members—
Lawson, Mackinnon, Mackey and Norman Bayles
—belong to the shark tribe, and are scavengers in
the sea of Costs, and two out of the five have
never practised.
Did any man ever like going to a barber ? This
writer is not a sporting man, so the hair expert invariably
talks sport—if he were a sporting man, the expert would
undoubtedly talk politics as lengthily as he now talks sport.
Will some kind inventor produce a patent self-acting hair-
trimmer, and earn the everlasting gratitude of a long-suf-
fering community? The shaving difficulty, by the way, is
already solved bv the Auto-Strop Safety Razor—a most in-
genious little machine, which gives a good, clean, pleasant
shave every time, can be stropped by a non-expert, and
has no screws to undo every time it is to be stropped or
cleaned. The razor has two strong guarantees—both
Lord Dudley and this writer use it.*
Probably in recent years the world never
was fooled so completely over anything as it was
over the results of the Bear and Monkey disturb-
ance. The one idea allowed to go out was that
there was only one party in it, which party was
Japan. The idea has had many spots
knocked off it “ since then—a whole side
fell out of it when the Bear didn’t allow
himself to be squeezed of even a penn’orth of
indemnity—and other spots still continue to drop
out of tlie bottom of it. The German Kriegs I
Akademie, or Staff College, has accordingly come |
to this official conclusion
In the late war Japan defeated Russia on land with i
enormous difficulty and indecisively. It is doubtful if
Japan could have won another battle. The one thing
Russia needed for certain victory was better transport
from Europe. |

IN BANA ALAND
Gone to his long home, Bananaland’s
Speaker, John Leahy, who has represented
Bu] loo, the constituency with the smallest
electoral roll in the State, since ’93. Although
he set foot in Australia as far back as ’74, his rich
Irish brogue hung to him just as persistently as
does Kidston’s Scottish lingo. Once during the
Morgan-Browne regime a Fogland visitor listened
to Kidston defending the Government, and
Leahy attacking it, and Joey Bell throwing his
Oxford bleat (although he is a native Queenslander)
into the discussion, and the amazed Londoner in
the gallery inquired if there were no Australians
at all in the House—he called it “’Owse.”
Leahy joined the profligate Philp Government as
Minister for Railways in 01, but the team was
soon on the financial rocks. Leahy’s methods of
administration didn’t tend to make the rocks any
softer. All along he was Phil p’s right-hand
man, his philosopher and, until recently, his
subterranean engineer. He was a great fighter,
and a strategist of no mean order. Also, he was
the most specious of reasoners when in Opposition,
and the most plausible explainer-away of things
when in office. When his mission was to
waste time he used to sail so close to
the line of privilege that the Speaker
was continually on the point of pulling him up,
but Leahy generally dodged the Speaker. Very
few experienced members cared to interject while
Janny ’ had the floor, and new members soon
learned this point. Leahy’s replies were swift,
usually vulgar, always merciless, often exceed-
mgly satirical, and never, even by mistake,
courteous. Courtesy was left out of Leahy’s com-
position. Ihe Speakership fell into his hands
two years ago; the three parties in the House had

The Question of a Port.
Broadmount” writes from Rockhampton (Q.)
in a spirit of violent contradiction : —
/o" iSkt' w b° writes about the Port Alma Railway
(B. 14/1/09), would lead a stranger to believe that
the people of Rockhampton were in favor of that railway,
but, as a matter of fact, the great majority of the people
of Rockhampton are deadly opposed to it. In support of
this, I will refer to the Harbor Board election in June
last, when the candidate advocating Port Alma was badly
defeated. I also refer to the petition, with over 2500
signatures, which was recently sent down to Parliament
by the people of Rockhampton, strongly protesting
against the railway. I also refer to a large public meet-
ing recently called by the Mayor of Rockhampton, at
which resolutions were adopted almost unanimously pro-
testing against the railway.
It is true Kidston introduced the Port Alma Railway
Bill under pressure from Rockhampton, but the “pres-
sure ” was confined almost entirely to the editor of the
Morning Bulletin, who, as everyone knows, is the real
Premier of Queensland. It is difficult to say what are
Kidston’s views on the question. He has hesitated at
times, but he has to do whatever the said editor bids him.
Then let me say- that Denham never told a deputation
that if he could have his way he would tear up the rails
of the Broadmount line and build the Port Alma line with
the material. Then the Harbor Board did not secure
from Philp the Broadmount line. The Philp Government
built the line, but certainly not at the request of the
Harbor Board. “Several hundreds of thousands” have
not been sunk in dredging, wharfage and railway con-
struction. Port Alma wharf has not yet been handed
over to the Harbor Board. The Harbor Board did not
enter into an agreement with the shipping companies to
use Port Alma wharf, resulting in 90 per cent, of the ship-
ping being done at Port Alma. I am not aware that a
single boat belonging to the inter-State shipping com-
panies has ever moored to the Port Alma wharf. What
did happen about 20 years ago was that some 1100 bales
of wool were taken down to Port Alma in punts and
stacked on that wharf for shipment per the B.I.S.N. Oo.’s
Taroba. The Taroba called in and moored to the wharf,
THE PRECIPITATE PATIENT.
THE PATIENT : “Let, things have, gone from bud to worse, and Pec no’art left. Air partner
scooted off, and I was sold up last week, Then I broke me leg and had to go in
'ospital. Then this ’ere complaint came on, and now they say I can't last more'n two dags."
RAY (OF SUNSHINE) JONES : “ Come, conic, old fellow! Don’t meet trouble half-wag."
but when it had got 200 bales on board, it was found that
to remain there any longer would mean damage to the
wharf and perhaps to the ship. Therefore it let loose and
steamed out to the bay', and the balance of the wool was
taken out in punts. This is about all the shipping that
has taken place at Port Alma wharf. Your correspondent
is apparently not aware that when it is stated that a boat
has gone into Port Alma it means that it has gone into
the Port Alma lead, and such boats, when anchored, are
two miles from Port Alma wharf.
I do not agree with .your correspondent that Broad-
mount has been such a great failure. I enclose a list of
vessels that have visited that port during the past ten
years, and this year the number will probably' be double
that of any other .year. A reference to the cargoes of these
vessels will show that they come there chiefly to take
awa.v frozen beef, which is carried by rail from Lake’s
Creek to Broadmount, and so the statement of y r our cor-
respondent that the Lake’s Creek Company continues to
send its produce to the bay' in punts requires much modi-
fication. Then to say that if the Broadmount railway
secured all the trade it would not pay is simply rot.
What 1 object to most, however, is not what your cor-
respondent says, but what he neglects to say. Why does
he not say that the non-success of Broadmount is due to
the boy'cott of that port in the interests of the punts and
tenders that ply in the Fitzroy River? Owing to the
rotten franchise of the Harbor Board, the owners of
these punts and tenders have been able to entirely
control the Board. As a result, the Board has
never spent one shilling in endeavoring to perma-
nently improve the entrance to Broadmount, which is also
the entrance to the river. But worse still is the boycott
that is kept up against that port. Even the inter-State
shipping companies and the Railway Department have
been “got at” to take a hand in this boycott. Under
the circumstances, it is a marvel that so much shipping
has been done at Broadmount.
Your correspondent refers to Mr. R. S. Archer’s position
in connection with the matter. It is a sweet and wholes
some position compared with that of the owners of the
punts and tenders. When the full light is turned on to
the Rockhampton deep-water port question it will be
found associated with some of the worst corruption ever
heard of in Australia.

“ Boro-Belle ” : Another church squabble
is looming up in Brisbane —this time amongst the
Anglicans of Kangaroo Point. Some of the
•devout worshippers take exception to the use of
•candles on the altar, and a much thumb-marked
petition to the Bishop is being circulated, full of
•denunciation of this sloping towards the church
that Dill Macky can’t sleep for thinking of. A
wide-awake preacher—what time he is not collect-
ing his stipend—is actively engaged getting up a
counterblast for the worried and dazed Bishop,
and his document is being freely signed by those
who approve of burnt tallow in the tabernacle.
The two petitions are to strike the Bishop simul-
taneously, and that prelate, weakened by the heat,
is expected to capsize backwards under the shock.

“ C.” writes :—
John Leahy, the just-deceased Speaker of Queensland
Assembly, was in many respects a remarkable man. ’Tis
said that before coming' to Australia he was a gravedigger
in Dublin ; anyhow, he came out young enough to learn
things, and at the time of his death he was reputedly one
of the wealthiest men in Bananaland. In 1893 he
arrived in Brisbane as member for Bulloo, where
he had kept a store and a pub, and, although
his outward appearance and manner were rugged
and his brogue farcical, he had a brain well stored
with the world’s literature. Leahy then looked a Western
bushman from top to toe —bell-bottomed trousers, slouch
hat, soft shirt, etc. But a change was soon noticeable
when the man from the West began to mix with city
financiers, brokers and politicians. Leahy was out to
make money' and a warm political nest for himself, so he
sought the company of those who could be of use to him,
and struck the political attitude that pays. His blunt
address and stubborn determination won him a place as a
dangerous enemy, if not as a loy'al friend. It was he
who aided Dawson and Drake to hurst up the Dick-
son Ministry, and who deserted the Labor Ministry as
soon as it was formed, although he nearly enrolled him-
self in a contemplated Dawson-Drake Cabinet. But he
didn’t want a change of Government so much as a change
of Premier, and when he got Dickson reduced to a sub-
ordinate position, and Philp in the chair, he was satisfied.
He could alway'S do what he liked with Philp, and was
’cute enough to see that his own unpopularity precluded
him from any chance of leadership. His acceptance of
the Speakership at a time when his party badly needed
him on the floor of the House—when Philp was the
only ex-Minister left to struggle with a strong
Treasury bench*-was the subject of much sub-
dued comment, and, to many, was inexplicable.
However, he made a sound, if far from prepossessing
Speaker, and his shrill call to “ Orther ! orther ! ” was a
thing never to be forgotten. Leahy may he summed up
in one word—thorough. Some years ago a feud sprang up
between him and present Home Secretary' Bell, then a
private member, and the brogue of the one and the haw-
haw of the other used to fill the galleries with amused
spectators. As an underground engineer Leahy' recog-
nised only one peer—Kidston.
What is the Phidston Government of
Queensland going to do about the leasing of land
by white men to the heathen Chow? When Kid-
ston was sitting in the Democratic front row, he
was often harrowed in his soul because of the
existence of so many Yellow tenants at Atherton.
Now the Mongolian evil is left to rage as it pleases
at Atherton, and is taking root in the splendid
Daintree district, where the soil is as rich as Dives
and prospects of rapid development are bright. A
big Chow syndicate is already past the negotiation
stage for a great area of country at a rental of £1
per acre. There is no part of North Queensland
which has greater dairying possibilities. It is a
case of so many beasts to the acre all the year
round, instead of so many acres to the beast. The
river, which is navigable by fair-sized steam-cnift
for 12 miles, is reckoned to be the best waterway
north of the Eitzroy. Yet through the apathy of
the Government this region promises to go over
to the tenant Chow, who will proceed forthwith
to drag all he can out of the soil at the quickest
possible rate, and so impoverish it as he has done
the Johnstone banana farms, and leave it a
beggared territory.
“ Flinderino ” An acquaintance of mine,
doing casual labor on the Cairns to Chillagoe (Q.)
railway, recently bought a small allotment near
the scene of his labor and built thereon a humpy.
At the side of this slab mansion he successfully
cultivated a patch of cabbages. Now, good cab-
bages in the north of Queensland are an expensive
luxury. Knowing that the local Chinamen were
getting Is. 6d. each for cabbages, my Australian
friend saw no reason why he should not get the
same figure for his vegetables, which were at least
as good. Putting a dozen prime cabbages in a
sack, he set off along the line for Mareeba, where
he was Well known. On the way he met a China-
man, who looked at the cabbages and offered
Is, 6d. each for them. But my friend is a
firm believer in a White Australia. He
reasoned that if a Chow could pay Is. 6d. for
a cabbage and afterwards sell it at a profit,
a white man would pay as much, if not
more. So, telling the Mongolian to go to blazes —-
or words to that effect—he shouldered the veget-
ables and continued his journey to Mareeba.
First house he called at the housewife admitted
that they were very good cabbages, (and Is. 6d.
each was very cheap, but she would not buy any
because she expected a Chinaman to call. The
next-door lady offered Is. each, and was quite
surprised when the offer was not accepted. From
door to door he hawked the vegetables, but nobody
would buy, and in disgust he gave the lot to a pub-
keeper for ss. Next morning a string of China-
men came trotting into town, each with two
loaded baskets, carried on a shoulder pole. Be-
tween them all over five dozen cabbages were dis-
posed of without difficulty at from Is. 6d. to 2s.
each. The residents of the North are unanimous
in the opinion that aliens are undesirables, and
that the Chinese especially should
be kept in And this is how they are
checked. ' ' A'/’

“Cynicus”: While admitting that the C.S.R.
is a blight and an incubus, still the cane grower
up north is responsible to some extent for the
position he generally finds himself in—stone-bust.
I have had a great deal to do with him, so I speak
from experience. A lot of him won’t work. He
hates the very name of toil. In the past the
Kanaka and the Chow did the necessary planting,
cultivating, chipping and cutting. Ergo it
is still Chows’ or Kanakas’ work, and the
mostly anti-Sosh folk who dwell year by
year on their mortgaged farms have a sort
of contempt for the low whites who, having
no notion of what’s infra dig., condescend
to take it on, and presently get away home with
big cheques. Around the Mossman (Q.) the cocky
cultivates “horse.” He scorns to walk. If he
did that he might be taken for a cane-slasher or a
mill-hand. He has his pickles and jam, also
corned cow, booked up at the local store till the
“crushin’.” When the crushing’s over and the
storeman lifts the boodle for the crop, the debit
balance is carried on to the next season. If he'
can’t afford men to tend the young cane properly
—let ’er rip ! He’s damned if he’ll do it himself !
Therefore he owns not anything but mortgage
parchment. This brand never lias any cash. I
know of a case where one wanted to go to a flash
darnce (they’re death on darnces), and he had to
borrow the half-crown admission money from the
Chow storekeeper, who weighed out the flour and
other necessaries weekly. He is eternally in a
quagmire of debt. In good seasons he keeps
afloat; one bad season, and there’s a dead horse
that takes four or five years to work off. Instead
of being a “plantab,” therefore, he is merely the'
unpaid servant of the local storekeepers, and
draws his rations for roosting on the premises,
chasing the flies away, and watching the ratoons
emerge from Mother Earth in their duly-appointed
seasons.

People are reminiscing at Brisbane just
now in celebration of the jubilee of Responsible
Government. The first building built by free
labor was piled up by John Williams, and opened
as the Captain Piper Hotel. The spot is now
occupied by the Meibourne-street railway station.
Williams’ life was associated with some ro-
mance. As a young man be went to sea, and
when he returned home to Somerset (England)
he was staggered by the news that his very best
girl was doing time for larceny, and had been
deported to Australia. It took him three years
to find her out. When he had ascertained the
address of his best girl he succeeded in getting
her assigned to him as a servant, and married her.
Williams sank the first trial shaft for coal in
Queensland. This was at Fairfield. He was the
first to manufacture lime from oyster shells and
coral. As a reward for his pioneering work the
Government offered him a grant of land (they
threw land about in those days as if it were
orange-peel), but he replied that he wanted
nothing from the State but that which he paid
for. In this respect, Williams seems to have
been the only pioneer whose memory deserves
honor.
“Han”: Surely the loneliest, and the
longest, and the most monotonous mail-coach
drive in Australia is that between Birdsville
(Q.) and Hergott (S.A.), 320 miles, which Ted
Steers has been doing regularly for the past
20 years ? Seldom a passenger accompanies him,
for there is a drought of white population over the
Edge, and when people take the trip they mostly
travel with a team, or punch cattle before them,
or do something in the business line. Over the
other long routes the drivers are changed every
50 or 100 miles, but Ted Steers goes the whole
jaunt on his own, and brings back the next mail.
The horses are, of course, changed about every 35
miles'. Once Ted was thrown off the box in a
waterhole, and the steeds trotted along uncon-
cernedly on their own account. There was no grass
on the route to attract them, so they made at their
regular pace for the changing station. The man
in charge could hardly help noticing the absence
of the driver ; in fact, he became so sure that Ted
wasn’t there that he went back to look for him.
He was pleased to find that Ted had got out of the
waterhole, and was hoofing it along at a great
pace. This lonesome charioteer is one of the best
known men in the great Far West, and his fame
grows with the years.
The Ranges.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
LED by chance and many changes,
Rode a horseman through the ranges.
Through the purple Queensland
ranges piled against the western
skies;
Loud he sang, and to his singing
Time his horse’s hoofs were ringing,
Beating out a time, and ringing into blended
melodies.
High, uplifted into Heaven,
Hung the huge escarpments riven—
Worn and rugged, rough and riven—vvith the
wear of many rains ;
Far, from round the steep hill-shoulders,
Through the clefts of mighty boulders,
Saw he, ’twixt the massy boulders, pictures of the
nether plains ;
Saw he scope of lands extending
From the foothills out, and ending
In a long perspective, ending in a line of sapphire
sea.
As the day’s exalted story
Ended in a blaze of glory,
Saw he such a blaze of glory as belongs to
Faerie!
And thereafter, in the tender
Death of daj', arose a splendor—
Rose the silver eastern splendor, crowning all the
peaks with white ;
Evening star and bright star-cluster
Faded, fainting in her lustre ;
As she lifted, in her lustre, into spacious fields of
night.
Ever through succeeding changes
Rode the horseman in the ranges
Lonely, in the Queensland ranges, as the mists
enwrapt him round.
In the chilly winds uplifting,
Fogs came up the valleys drifting,
Seas of misty vapors, drifting shrouds across
familiar ground.
Now no longer rode he singing
To the horse-shoes’ wonted ringing ;
Sounded hollow now the ringing hoofs in dim
recesses vast.
Walls of granite rose and bound him ;
Silent shadows closed around him ;
Vague dark shapes were all around him, and the
horseman rode aghast.
For, from out the chaos sweeping,
Came a sombre presence creeping.
Out of misty chaos creeping, stole the phantom
hand of Death.
Reaching up with icy fingers
At whose beckon no man lingers,
Neither horse nor horseman lingers, save to draw
one shuddering breath.
Oft at night through passes riding
Men still see a phantom gliding ;
See a phantom horseman gliding high on crags
against the skies;
While a faint song ebbs and changes
Through the chaos of the ranges,
Floating, through the lonely ranges, dim-re-
membered melodies.

THE BOGY OF CLIMATE.
BY J. D. FITZGERALD.
When one remembers the
free conditions of Queens-
land referred to in previous
chapters—conditions politi-
cal, social, industrial and
religious—one has presented
the perfect sphere in which
the young, strong, vigorous,
aspiring man of every white
nationality can fearlessly
essay the betterment of his
condition and the expansion
of his true self. The in-
tending settler, having
grasped the idea ,of the
meaning which attaches to
Democracy in Queensland —
having realised that it means
not only political liberty, but organised aid
on strict business lines, so that public and
individual wealth may advance pari passu —must
proceed to rid himself of many preconceived
notions. In the first place, he has probably gained
the impression that the State of Queensland is a
land of unendurable tropical heat, which cannot;
he regarded as “a white man's country.” He may
reassure himself. The writer of this has been in
COCOANUT PALMS AT PORT DOUGLAS.—PICTURESQUE AND
COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE.
every part of Queensland, from the N.S. W. border
round to Burketown. He has lived for several
years in Brisbane and Rockhampton, having gone
to the latter place an invalid and left it restored
to health. He is therefore in the position of a
willing witness to the truth about the climate of
the Northern Giant.
The most delightful winters
in the world are to be found
in Queensland, and the sum-
mers, though hot, are endur-
able. In the coastal towns
the heat is relieved by the
balmy breezes from the
Pacific Ocean and the Coral
Sea; away from the coast
there are high tablelands,
on which a mild temperature
and cool evenings may be
found even in the middle of
summer. In the Western dis-
tricts, the dry heat is endur-
able, and does not enervate.
Man has vigor for his work.
The coastal towns right
north as far as Thursday
Island are no less endurable
than the Riviera, south of
Europe, or North Africa—
Morocco, Tunis, Tripoli, or
Egypt—to which thousands
of Europeans resort both in
summer and winter for
health reasons. It can
safely be said that in no part of Queens-
land, in the hottest months of January and
February, will you have to endure and live
through such days as you will get in London in
August, or in Rome in July. And in those
cities, and others like New York, the dweller
has to endure the opposite extreme of intense
cold, frost and snow. In Shanghai I have seen
people in white duck suits in the morning,
and in fur coats in the afternoon—in the
month of September. There is something
bracing and aromatic in the air of Queensland
which can well be contrasted with the stagnant
air of Rome or London in summer. It may be
that the great eucalyptus forests have something
balsamic in their resins and in the aromatic odors
which they exhale.
But the best test of the climate is furnished by
the class of men and women bred in the Northern
State. In all manly sports the young Queens-
lander excels. Football and cricket are played
from Cape York to the borders of N.S. W. In
football—a game requiring speed, stamina, and
strength—the Queenslanders hold their own with
the Southerners. That, surely, is a tribute to the
mildness of the winter climate and to the non-
enervating qualities of summer temperatures.
Cricket has not yet made such rapid pro-
gress ; but of recent years the quality or
STRAWBERRIES AT WELLINGTON POINT (Q.). —THE TEST OF A
BENIGNANT CLIMATE.
the game has improved, and now there are
several top-notchers from the Northern State,
and some who will yet acquire international
fame. A Queenslander will be in the Australian
Eleven this year to visit England. The compara-
tive backwardness of cricket as a sport, compared
with the advanced position of football, is accounted
for by the fact that so far the match wickets have
not been brought to that pitch of perfection which
enables the young player to get experience of the
best kind ; nor is there that perfect organisation
and grade matches which enable the rising young-
sters in the Southern States to push through to
the top of the ladder from the lowest rung. But
all that will come with time. Queensland is but
a giant baby as yet.
2.—PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT.—A SELECTOR'S HOUSE LATER ON.
Another test of the climatic effects upon-the
people is to be found in a study of the children.
Nowhere in the world could you find a happier,
cleaner, handsomer, healthier lot of children than
in Queensland. It is often said that Japan is the
happiest land for children. But the rigors of the
Japanese winter, and the relatively low state of
comfort in so poor a country, take largely from the
happiness of the Japanese child ; while certain
barbaric superstitions often render the •’Mid a
victim. No visitor can fail to notice the hideous
eczema which afflicts so many children in Japan ;
in many cases their eyes and part of their heads
are eaten away by this disease. Superstition steps
in to avert a cure, it being a Japanese belief that
a child afflicted in this hideous manner will grow
up both lucky and strong. In the healthy air of
Queensland the children live out of doors in the
freest manner, sandalled or barefooted (rich and
poor alike); and in summer the school classes are
held on the broad school verandahs. Besides this,
the houses in Queensland are built for the climate,
and to enable the people to live as much out of
doors as possible, and in the urban and suburban
areas the pressure of population is not yet great
enough to have brought into permanent use the
terrace or the tenement house. Everyone has
ample room to play, to live, to cultivate a garden,
to expand physically and mentally.
Moreover, the children are not subject to the
diseases which are known in Europe to be peculiar
to the slum. The pathology of the slum has been
the subject of a minute examination and a con-
stant and vigilant study of late years ; and certain
diseases have been diagnosed as appertaining
especially to the conditions existing in every
European and British city, conditions caused by
the pressure of population and poverty. But in
Queensland pressure of population is non-exist-
ent; poverty is unknown. Overcrowding, with its
attendant diseases, may be discoverable in Queens-
land cities fifty years hence ; but probably then a
progressive and efficient Democracy will have pro-
1.—THE PIONEER'S BEGINNING.—SELECTOR'S HUT AT WARRA (Q.).
vided a remedy which has not yet been found in
the slum centres of the Old World. Consequently
child life in Queensland has not to suffer the risks
which, unhappily, the children of England and
the continent of Europe are exposed to ; nor take
chances of diseases which rack the bodies, distort
the minds, and stunt the souls of slum children in
Britain.
To realise the difference between child life in the
Old World and in Queensland, take up H. G.
Wells’thoughtful book, .“Old Worlds for New,
and read therefrom the official records of such
towns as York—which may be regarded as a
typical instance of the poverty, had housing, bad
air and rigorous climate of England, causing the
diseases which decimate the slum dwellers, and
exposing children to conditions which the horrors
depicted in the “Inferno” of Dante cannot
exceed. Physical suffering in a child makes it a
backward and an unwilling scholar (dunces are
invariably diseased and suffering); the children’s
minds are incapable of grasping their tasks ; their
bodies grow up weedy and diseased. -Their fate
is to become inmates of gaols or premature graves.
This is no fancy sketch, if the official statistics
and the descriptions given in Wells’ book are re-
liable—and they cannot be challenged. What
happiness it would be could these unfortunate
victims of an accident of birth be transferred to a
climate like that of Queensland, where no grim
fogs choke them or weaken their lungs in
winter ; where life is free, where the glorious
sunshine is perennial and the skies are clear and
blue. The nights, resplendent with stars, in-
vite the European, who now gazes upwards for
six months of the year to black, bat-like fogs
which hide the sun by day and the stars by night;
from which emerge miasmas, disease and pre-
mature death ! From such
conditions, as—
Of blackest midnight born
In Stygian caves forlorn ;
Where brooding' darkness
spreads her jealous wings,
And the night raven sings,.
the dweller in European
climes may turn without
apprehension to the tropic
and temperate zones of
Queensland, to her great
tablelands and western
plains, to her sea coasts,
and her coral Barrier Reefs,
swept with
The long wash of Australasian
seas,
and cooled with breezes
from spice islands —breezes
laden with magnolia, orange
flowers, and chain paca.
The difference in the fate
of a British child from that
of the young Queenslander
is almost the measure of
the chasm between Heaven
and Hades. The class of
agricultural immigrant who
would turn his steps towards
Queensland would be little
better off in his old home
in the rural districts than
tlieslum-dwellerinthetown.
Already many horrible ex-
posures have been made by
philanthropists of the condition of housing in the
rural districts in England and Scotland. Ireland
is better, because its legislation is more drastic
and up-to-date ; and its needs probably greater,
calling more loudly for immediate improvement.
But many of the rural districts in England were
long known as fever swamps as bad as Africa.
To transport his family from an overcrowded
country, where hundreds and even thousands of
persons inhabit every square mile of territory, to
a vast country with about one person to every
mile, would seem a boon to the inhabitant of
Britain—an unimaginable happiness, a rescue of
himself, his wife and children from despair, a
transportation to Heaven by comparison with
what he had to endure. Given the worst which
he could be told, or with vivid imagination
could conjure up, of the climate of Queensland,
still there is the sunshine in lieu of fog, there is
the whole year to cultivate his farm with
successive crops, instead of being idle for six
months through the rigors of his Northern
climate. And when he reaches Queensland, and
begins to nerve himself to endure the frightful
heat of which he had heard so muoh, he will soon
experience a surprise that
the hottest days are nod
less endurable than the hot-
test days which he had ex-
perienced in England, while,
as he becomes acclimatised,
he wonders that he could
ever have hesitated in
changing his hemisphere, or
halted so long before reliev-
ing himself of those harsh
climatic, social, and politi-
cal conditions to which he
had been horn.
In the next issue this sub-
ject of climate will be pur-
sued further. Much de-
pends upon a thorough ap-
preciation of the fact that
in the vast expanse of
Queensland's territory you
may find all climates except
that of the frigid and its
neighboring zones. Torrid
and temperate you have-
little of the former, much of
the latter. The main point
for the prospective settler
to consider is—What effect
is it likely to have upon
himself, his wife and his
children ? —Are there any
drawbacks in it. and, if
so, are these sufficient to counterbalance the
advantages of freedom and prospective wealth
which are open to him ? The answer to this may
be shown in a reference to the physique of the
men and women, the health and beauty of the off-
spring ; and in the fact that art, literature and
music flourish side by side with material prosperity
from North to South.

Intense Itching Eczema Drove Him
Nearly to Despair—Chief Surgeon
of a London Hospital Called It
Worst Case He Had Ever Seen
Got Little or No Relief Until
CUTICURA STOPPED HIS
UNBEARABLE TORTURE
“About four years ago, in London, I
was troubled by a severe itching and
°Oo
dry, scurfy skin
on my ankles and
feet. The same,
in a few days,
was the case with
my arms and
scalp. I could
hardly keep from
scratching,which,
I need hardly
say, made it
worse. Then
large red patches
appeared, with
inflammation
and soreness.
After ten days,
thousands of small red pimples formed.
On becoming dry, these caused intense
itching. I was advised to go to the
hospital for diseases of the skin. I did
so and was an out-patient for a month
or more, the chief surgeon saying: ‘I
never saw such a bad case of eczema.’
But I got little or no relief. Then I
tried many so-called remedies, but I be-
came so bad that I almost gave up in
despair. On coming to this country I
heard so many accounts of cures by Cuti-
cura Remedies that I resolved, as a
last resource, to give them a trial. This
was after suffering agonies for twelve
months, and right glad am I that I did
so, for I was relieved of the almost un-
bearable itching after two or three
applications of Guticura Ointment. I
continued its use, combined with a
liberal use of Cuticura Soap and Cuti-
cura Resolvent Pills and am more than
thankful to say that after using three
sets of the Remedies, I was completely
cured. I can only add that, should any
one. be suffering as I did, I hope that
they will do as I did, and I am sure of
the results. Henry Searle, Cross St.,

A GENIUS, SOME HIGH FINANCE, AND POSTERITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Perth, Tuesday.—Mr.G. H. Reid was asked to say some-
thing: in regard to the future financial requirements of the
Commonwealth. He said: “There is no doubt the
financial question is full of difficulties. This idea of not
borrowing for necessary and reproductive works is the
silliest, crudest idea of national finance that ever came to
the surface in any country in the world. It is worthy of
a community of blackfellows. The secret of the dis-
graceful chaos which exists at present in the Post and
Telegraph Department lies just in that one piece of
idiocy.”—S. M. Herald, 13/lfo9.
They broke the noble statesman’s rest
And shattered his seclusion—
They cried, “ Please tell us what is best
To end our sad confusion !
We need your views—we do indeed !
Pray help us, Mr. 6. H. Reid ! ”
That noble statesman straight awoke
And banished his annoyance,
And long and eloquently spoke
With hauteur and flamboyance ,
And much superior tone and pride—
Yea, he was highly doghified !
“ You see,” he said, “ my dear young friend,
Who represents the Press,
These wretched fellows have to send
To me to know—yes, yes !
And would you have them vainly plead
In their distress to G. H. Reid?
“ Ah, no ! I’ll give to them my plan—
And, really, it immense is !
Tell them to borrow all they can,
And blow the consequences !
They owe three hundred millions, true —
But what is that to me or you l
“Three hundred millons —Pooh ! Finance
Just shakes its sides with laughter 1
Australia’s motto is Advance !
No matter wiiat comes after !
So let the Hebrews— that’s my plan—
Advance Australia all they can !
“ If we are rich and prosperous
With those three hundred millions,
What riches would accrue to us
If we owed, say, three billions !
The nation would have no more cares ;
We’d all be blessed millionaires !
“ You borrow, say, at four per cent.
For rabbit conservation
In country nobody will rent ;
Or build a mighty station
At Dingo Flat, at Back-o’-Bourke —
And there’s your reproductive work!
“ Eh ! What ? Oh ! Ah ! Yes-no ! Of course !
Your intellect obtuse is :
Why, surely you can see the force
Of what it reproduces'?
It pays at least one-half per cent.,
So surely we should be content?
“ You place that loan upon the shelf,
Yqu learn to love it dearly ;
Although it won’t pay for itself,
You pay the interest yearly.
You die ; the great work disappears,
The loan lives on for years and years !
“ Ah, now I see you see the force
Of what I closely reason !
Who pays ? Posterity, of course !
At some convenient season.
And let them pay ! And blow the fuss !
Posterity's done naught for us !”
N.S.W.
O. C. CABOT.
“ Oculeus ” : I was greatly interested in
Bulletin par. of 7th January regarding the old
cannon at Portland (Vic.). I think, however,
that “ 0.K.” guessed wrong. The brand “ Car-
ron ” goes to show the gun is not of French origin,
but hails from Scotland. The Carron Co., whose
mark it bears, is a famous old foundry and ship-
ping co. near Falkirk (where Philp’s chum Kid-
ston was born). The date (1811) was not the
time of day when the French importer would be
allowed to buy that class of goods in the Cold
Country ; although the implement may possibly
have been captured by the French from one of
the Carron fleet. Last time I was in Scotland I
saw an old shipping advt. of the above firm in
which was inserted a clause stating that each ship
carried a certain number of the firm’s own make
of cannon, and that able-bodied passengers would
be accepted at half fare on condition that they
undertook to help in the defence of the ship
should it be attacked—a not altogether remote
contingency in those times. Unlike many old
firms the Carron Co. has not gone under in the
modern rush, but still runs steamers from the
Forth to London. As for the foundry depart-
ment-well, “O.K.’s” missus will tell him that
Carron makes good stoves nowadays.
The taxi-cab has only just made its Aus-
tralian debut in Melbourne, and already the
haughty moke-flogging Jehu is an alarmed man.
Four cabs initiated the service, but 10 others will
be put on within a week or two, and 12 more are
under order. The cabs, built by the big Renault
Co., look smart and business-like; their general
nattiness being enhanced by their guiding
geniuses’ uniforms of khaki, with green facings,
tanned leather putties and caps. Each taxi is of
nine h.p., can slither you 30 miles within the hour
(when the law isn’t handy), and has a cpllapsible
hood—a sensible innovation for Australian sum-
mer nights. Other things apart, the taxi’s pro-
posed charges are going to make the chronic
wrangler behind the ’orse chronically ill. Two
persons are carried a mile for a shilling,
and each quarter-mile extra is charged
thrippence. There are no disputes. The taxi-
meter ticks off the shillings and odd pence under
your eye as you go along ; when you stop, the
meter stops, and the hand points to the exact
penny, like the inexorable finger of Fate. Yarra-
dom’s alarmed cabbies are endeavoring to cir-
cumvent the horror by petitioning the City Council
to compel the taxies to take the rank with them.
This means that if you want a taxi, and the taxi
is tenth on the rank, you can take a prolonged
seat and wait till somebody else absorbs the nine
preceding hansoms. Probably the authorities
won’t entertain the idea. The taxi has come to
stay, and, as elsewhere, changed conditions will
have to make room for it. In London, each class
of vehicle has its separate rank, and the hirer is
free to choose which he pleases. One whistle
brings the taxi, two the hansom, and three the
four-wheeler. These are the new police regula-
tions, made necessary by the taxi’s advent, and
some similar arrangement will have to be made
here.

TO KEEP YOU SICK!
THE first impulse of persons who find that they are ailing in any way is to
plunge into a chemist’s and purchase a box of pills or a bottle of some patent
medicine. . . Failing to get more than temporary relief from this they then
consult a doctor, and he writes a prescription which more than likely calls for the
same medicine, only in a different form from what the patient has already taken.
The same result, generally. Next, the patient comes to the conclusion that this
doctor didn’t diagnose the case right, and then goes to another, with the same
result. And so on.
Our modern medical system is a foolish system. We practically pay
m™ heep us ill. Their prosperity depends not on our health,
OUR SICKNESS ! . . . To-day very little is known of medicine
use * The wisest doctor can do taut little more than clear out
the system or accelerate the action of the heart. When he has done these
thing's he has reached the end. MEDICINE CANNOT MAKE STRENGTH.
Now, just study yourself for a moment. The failure or breaking down of any
organic function means that it has not strength to do its work. If there was any
nourishment in medicine it might bring about a healthy change, but you know there
is not. Drugs, medicines, stimulants, narcotics and antidotes are POISONS, not
food. Food is needed to build up new energy. Electricity is nerve food, nerve life.
No pain or debility can exist in a body charged with Electric Life; you can have
no WeaKness, no Inactive Parts, no Rheumatism, Indi-
gestion, Constipation or Kidney Trouble, if you fill your
body with it, because the life generated by this grand force gives health and

“Growler,” from Tasmania: —
That plenty ot practice does not always make perfect
was exemplified by the fate of Alfred Dobson, late Agent-
General of Tasmania in London. While crossing the
Channel in December last he sat on a rail, and, losing his
balance, he fell overboard and was seen no more. Up to
about a dozen years ago Alfred Dobson was in politics,
ever sitting on a rail and looking out for the good things
which might be offered to him as an inducement to come
off the unsteady position. And he did come down when
the game was worth the candle. The first political prize
that fell to his share was the Attorney-Generalship in a
short-lived Ministry. Then came the Speakership, and,
finally, the Solicitor-Generalship. Yet he ended by falling
off a ship and being drowned. The Solicitor-General-
ship in those days was a good thing, for it
included the right to private practice, a chance
which Alfred Dobson never lost sight of. There are
cases on record where private barrister Alfred Dobson
gained a verdict for his clients in a civil case, and subse-
quently appeared on the scene as Solicitor-General Dob-
son threatening a criminal prosecution if the cash value
of the verdict wasn’t forthcoming. Dobson might relent
in respect to the failings of an Upper Davey-street black
sheep, but to shut one eye to the shortcomings of the
lower orders would have been committing sacrilege in his
eyes. He was the true type of old Van Dobson Land.
He was a half-brother of Senator Dobson, but he had
higher ambitions than a senatorship. His eyes rested on
a judgeship, yet when the chance came a certain part}' in
the House would have no more of the Dobson
family. A. I. Clark was appointed, and the better
man got in for once. Alfred Dobson never got quite
over this blow. He went, later on, to London,
shaking the dust of an ungrateful country off his feet.
He was appointed Agent-General at £4OO per annum, and
the position suited him. The Tasmanian Agent-General
is merely an official kept in London to show the
Upper Davey-streeters round. His business is practically
nil. Alfred made the most of his job. When a Dobson,
a Cameron, a Butler, or other Upper Davey-streeter hap-
pened along he was duly shown round among the crested
crowd. The Mercury would subsequently publish these
exploits, which gave much satisfaction to the crime de la
crime of Hobart society. It was Charlie Davies, boss of
the Mercury, who moved in the Upper House recently to
the effect that the third judgeship, made vacant by the
death of A. I. Clark, should be open to non-residents.
The object became plain enough when it leaked out that
the billet had been offered to Alfred Dobson. Presum-
ably the Labor party knew nothing of this move, which
was, no doubt, hatched in society circles. Now that the
Labor party i 8 getting a bit more wind into its sails, a
Judge of the Van Dobson brand is practically impossible
even in Tasmania.

SORE, ACHING FEET
Zam-Buk is Soothing and Healing.
n
Few escape the discomfort of undue perspira=
tion of the feet in Summer, and fewer still are
they who do not know the torture of blistered,
sore, and tender feet. Zam=Buk should be
applied to the feet night and morning, rubbing
it in gently for. a few minutes in order to pro=
mote greater circulation. This treatment will
be found delightfully cooling and pleasant, and
Zam=Buk will regulate perspiration, cleanse the
pores, soften hard corns, and absolutely abolish
all soreness.
“ Being an insurance traveller,” says Mr. W. Sims, of 139
Tynte Street, North Adelaide, “I am a lot on my feet, and very
often suffer from sore heels. Upon the application of Zam-Buk
Healing Balm the soothing effect is wonderful, and in a short
time my heels are quite sound again. I always keep Zam-Buk in
the house for the use of my wife and children in cases of burns,
scalds, etc. I have pleasure in recommending Zam-Buk to
fellow-sufferers.”
SUN-BURN,
Prickly Heat, etc.
Summer’s heat and glare is told in all sorts
of skin troubles, from sunburn and prickly
heat to more serious disorders, caused by
excessive perspiration or dryness, such as Irritation
and Rashes. The hands, face and neck are the
parts liable to suffer from disfiguring sun=burn and
smarting patches. In the armpits and other joints,
sores may arise from chafing and excessive per=
spiration. Regular anointings with Zam=Buk— the
balm that just suits the season and the skin—are
absolutely essential to skin=health just now.
Mr. J. Parker, of 145 Alice Street, Newtown, Sydney, says;—
“Last summer a rash broke out all over my body, and the irritation
caused me to be constantly scratching- it. I bathed my body with '
different solutions, but could gain no relief. Remembering I had
Zam-Buk in the house, I applied it to the rash, and, to my surprise,
after two applications all the fire and irritation disappeared. I continued the
treatment for two or three days, by which time the rash was completely cured.”
sfn^-ui^
Zam-Buk is invaluable for
sun-burn, prickly heat,
rash, sore feet, smarting:
patches, cuts, bruises,
and all injuries to the
skin. Of all chemists and

The Man Who Raised
Charlestown.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Suggested by an incident in the “ Devil’s Disciple, but
the name “Buckland” is fictitious here, and so also
is “ Charlestown,” and the quiet man may represent an
original character for any time.
THEY were hanging men in Buckland who
would not cheer King George—
The parson from his pulpit and the black-
smith from his forge;
They were hanging men and brothers, and the
stoutest heart was down,
When a quiet man from Buckland rode at dusk to
Charlestown.
Not a young man in his glory filled with patriotic
fire,
Not an orator nor soldier, nor a known man in his
shire;
But he was the Unexpected—one of Danger’s
Volunteers,
At a time for which he’d waited, all unheard of,
many years.
And Charlestown met in council, the quiet man
to hear—
The town was large and wealthy, but the folks
were filled with fear :
The fear of death and plunder—and none to lead
had they—
And Self fought Patriotism as ’twill always be the
way.
The man turned to the people, and he spoke in
anger then,
And crooked his finger here and there to those he
marked as men.
And many gathered round him to see what they
could do—
For men know men in danger, as they know the
cowards too.
He chose his men and captains, and sent them
here and there.
The arms and ammunition were gathered in the
square;
While peaceful folk were praying or croaking,
every one,
He was working with his blacksmiths at- the
carriage of a gun.
While the Council sat on Sunday, and the church
bells rang their peal,
The quiet man was mending a broken waggon
wheel;
While they passed their resolution on his doings
(and the likes).
From a pile his men brought to him he was
choosing poles for pikes.
(They were hanging men in Buckland who would
not cheer King George ;
They were making pikes in Charlestown at every
blacksmith’s forge.
While the Council sat in session, and the same
old song they sang,
They heard the horsemen gallop out, and the
blacksmiths’ hammers clang.)
And a thrill went through the city ere the drums
began to roll.
And the coward found his courage, and the
drunkard found his soul.
So a thrill went through the city that would go
through all the land,
For the quiet man from Buckland held men’s
hearts in his right hand.
And he caught a Charlestown poet (there are many
tell the tale),
And he took him by the collar when he’d filled
him up with ale :
“Now, then, write a song for Charlestown that
shall lift her on her way,
For she’s marching out to Buckland and to Death
at break o’ day.”
And he set the silenced women tearing sheet and
shift and shirt
To make bandages and roll them for the men that
would get hurt.
And he called out his musicians and he told them
what to play :
“ For I want my men excited when they march
at break o’ day.”
And he set the women cooking—with a wood-and-
water crew—
“ For I want no empty stomachs for the work we
have to do.”
Then he said to his new soldiers : “ Eat your fill
while yet you may ;
’Tis a heavy road to Buckland that we’ll march at
break o’ day.”
And a shout went through the city when the
drums began to roll
(And the coward was a brave man and the beggar
had a soul),
And the drunken Charlestown poet cared no more
if he should hang,
For his song of “ Charlestown’s Coming ” was the
song the soldiers sang.
And they cursed the King of England, and they
shouted in their glee,
And they swore to drive the British and their
friends into the sea;
But when they’d quite finished swearing, said
their leader “ Let us pray,
For we march to Death and Freedom, and it’s
nearly dawn of day.”
There were marching feet at daybreak, and close
upon their heels
Came the scuffling tread of horses and the heavy
crunch of wheels;
So they took the road to Buckland, with their
scouts out to take heed,
And a quiet man of fifty on a grey horse in the
lead.
There was silence in the city, there was silence as
of night—
Women in the ghostly daylight, kneeling, pray-
ing, deathly white,
As their mothers knelt before them, as their
daughters knelt since then,
And as ours shall, in the future, kneel and pray
for fighting men.
For their men had gone to battle, as our sons and
grandsons too
Must go out, for Life and Freedom, as all nations
have to do.
And the Charlestown women waited for the sounds
that came too soon—
Though they listened, almost,breathless, till the
early afternoon.
Then they heard the tones of danger for their
husbands, sweethearts, sons,
And they stopped their ears in terror, crying,
“Oh,'my God! The guns!”
Then they strained their ears to listen through
the church-bells’ startled chime—
Far along the road to Buckland, Charlestown’s
guns were marking time.
“They advance!” “They halt!” “Retreat-
ing!” “They come back!” “The guns
are done!”
But the calmer spirits, listening, said “Our guns
are going on.”
And the friend and foe in Buckland felt two
different kinds of thrills
When they heard the Charlestown cannon talking
on the Buckland hills.
And the quiet man of Buckland sent a message in
that day,
And he gave the British soldiers just two hours to
march away.
And they hang men there no longer, there is
peace on land and wave ;
On the sunny hills of Buckland there is many a
quiet grave.
There is peace upon the land, and there is
friendship on the waves —
On the sunny hills of Buckland there are rows of
quiet graves.
And an ancient man in Buckland may be seen in
sunny hours.
Pottering round about his garden, and his kitchen
stuff and flowers.
N.S.W.
HENRY LAWSON.
A Street Incident.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
MEN who slink along close to the street
windows are the man-eaters. Men who
keep furtively to the middle of the street
are the eaten. Men who walk squarely down the
centre of the pavement with gaze fixed ahead are
hunters of big game. The man who shuffles along
the gutters is a hunter too, but he looks for small
game.
Willy is a hunter of small game. He hunches
his shoulders and his head leans at an acute angle
forward, and his hands are dug down deep into
his trousers pockets. He does not lift his feet
much. In the dark he looks like a lad of 18,
but by sunlight he is clearly 45. He has watery
eyes and seems short-sighted, and he is not
particular about his beard. In fact, it is not a
beard, yet it is not a scrub. He also has a
disregard for the bottoms of his trousers, which
have become fringed by constant dragging at the
heels. He would far rather wear comfortable old
cracked, soleless boots two sizes too big for him
than the best boots made to order in the city.
He pins his coat-collar up under his chin for
obvious reasons. Willy walks rather rapidly,
sometimes on the pavement, mostly in the gutter,
but sometimes a few yards into the roadway,
always with his head leaned forward at an acute
angle.
On this particular day he turned out of King-
street, and kept to the gutter on the busy side
of Pitt-street. Near the Strand he suddenly
quickened his pace.
There was another man of Willy’s type, only
fatter and greasier-looking, coming directly
towards him at an accelerated walk. Willy sud-
denly stopped, planting one foot down very
firmly. Then he gave one glance at the stranger,
and diverted his attention to the passing faces on
the footpath. The fat stranger looked hard at
Willy’s boots, and then his eyes rose slowly till
they reached Willy’s indifferent-looking face.
Next his gaze fell rapidly to Willy’s feet again.
Finally he took a deep breath and leaned against
a post, and thrust his hands deeper into his
trousers pockets. His gaze never left Willy’s
boots. In a lull the post-office clock boomed 10
strokes. People passed by the score, by the
hundred. A thousand faces passed them in the
street, but neither stirred. Bikes brushed past
wildly, startlingly close, but Willy never budged
an inch. Carriages drove up to the door of the
drapers, but had to get a little past the entrance
to avoid the Hunter of Small Game.
Eleven o’clock boomed, and the greasy up-
holder of the post said :
“ Waitin’ fer someone ?”
Willy glanced round carelessly.
“ Naw.”
“ Wot yer waitin’ fer ? ”
“ Nuthin’.”
“ W’y don’t yer lean against er post ? ”
“Not takin’ on enny posts, thank yer.”
“ Must be tirin’, I think ? ”
“ I likes it,” said Willy, indifferently.
At twelve o’clock the stranger said :
“ Yer’ll excuse me addressin’ yer, won’t yer ? ”
“ Suttinly.”
“Yer missin’ ther counter lunches.”
“I’ve lost me appetite.”
“ Fer beer ? ”
“Fer beer, too.”
Half-an-hour later the man who was lounging
said:
“Yer fice seems familiar ter me. W’ere yer
dossin’ ? ”
“ Dawn at ther Bay Mansions.”
“ Yer knaw Stinker Williams dawn there ? ”
“ Yes, friend er mine.”
A gentleman came down the street smoking a
choice cigar. Its fragrant breath was wafted into
their nostrils, and both pairs of eyes looked
hungrily after him. A few paces away the gentle-
man carelessly threw away the half-smoked cigar.
Both hunters looked at it as it lay with a little
blue wreath of smoke rising upwards, but neither
stirred.
. “ There’s a cigar fer yer,” said the greasy man.
“ Thank yer ; but yer kin ’ev it. I’ve give up
smokin’.”
The fat man did not leave his post, however.
He looked at the cigar a good deal, and its sug-
gestiveness caused him to say :
“ Got a bumper on yer ? I've got a match.”
(Continued on next page.)


THAT ONE WEAK SPOT !
Right in the Small of the Back.
A bad back is Nature’s signal of distress, a call for help from the
kidneys. The aching tells of dangerous congestion that robs the
kidneys of their blood-filtering power, or painful, wasting inflamma-
tions. There is immediate need for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
to relieve the pain and heal the diseased kidneys, to ward off more
fatal and painful disorders. Learn to keep the kidneys well, Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills will do it for you. Grateful residents of
this city testify. Their statements prove it to you.
SYDNEY PROOF.
Every picture
tells a story.’ 1
FROM SURRY HILLS.
Mr. James Higgins, 15 Terry Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, says Some time ago I
was taken very badly with kidney trouble. I consulted three doctors, and underwent
treatment, and each one failing to do me good advised me to go into the hospital for an
operation. They said my case was almost hopeless, and that an operation was my only
chance, as one of the kidneys was diseased. I took medicines of all sorts; everything
failed, and I was in such pain that I did not care if I died. I had severe backache, giddi-
ness, headaches, and scalding urine. The day was appointed for the operation when a
friend asked me if I had yet tried Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. He told me he knew of
a man who was as bad as I was, and had been cured completely by these pills. I postponed
the operation, and commenced using Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. A fortnignt later I
returned to work, and the men there could not believe that the change they saw in me
would ever have been possible. There is no doubt it is wonderful. lam as fit for work as
raa Fi C v°e U y d ears later Mrs. Higgins saysMy husband has been free of every symptom
of kidney trouble ever since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him, fi y S •
FROM BALMAIN.
Mr. P. Smith, 1 Cheltenham Street, Balmain, Sydney, says“ I used Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills for kidney trouble, and they worked a miracle in my case. I had been under
three doctors at different times, but their treatment did me no good. I used to be so bad
that I would have to be carried home on a cart if an attack came on when working in the
street. Sometimes I have been taken to the hospital when one of these bad attacks came on. I
suffered with a kind of biliousness and vomiting, my secretions were very bad ; I could never
bend my back or move at all when I had a bad turn. The people at the hospital gave me
medicines and recommended rubbing in liniments, but it was of no use, they did not benefit
me. I saw an advertisement for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and procured this remedy.
I only took one box, and was cured. When I finished them I started work, and have worked
ever since. These Pills cured me after years of suffering, and the relief was instantaneous.”
Mrs. Smith says, nine years later : —“My husband has had wonderful health since he
used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. lam convinced that he owes his life to this remedy.
He is now so well, thanks to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”

76 Pitt Street, Sydney, N.S.W.
Willy put his fingers into his ticket pocket and
reached out an end of a cigarette. The stranger
was a little too far to get it without a slight effort
away from the post, and he said :
‘ ‘ Can’t yer come a bit closer with it ? ”
Willy put the bumper back into his ticket
pocket, and the fat man returned the match to his,
and conversation flagged.
Another hunter came shuffling along, and
passed them without recognition. A few paces
on he rapidly stooped and picked up the half
cigar and then disappeared among the crowd.
Both men watched him intently, then the fat man
said :
“ Stinker Williams.”
“ I see’d him.” said Willy.
At three o’clock the greasy man showed signs
of impatience.
“ Yer a Weedin’ nark, that’s wot yer are.”
Willy paid no attention.
“ I knowed yer soon’s I seen yer this
mornin’. Yer ther bloke wot’s cruelled me heaps
o’ times, and I’ve got me knife inter yer.”
“ Yer makin’ a mistake. It wasn’t me.”
“ Yes, it was. I knowed yer by yer ugly mo.
Yer a nark, so there.”
He left his post and came close by Willy,
shoulder touching shoulder.
“W’y can’t yer leave me alone ?” whined
Willy. “ I never did yer enny ’arm. I never
did nobody enny ’arm. ”
The stranger gave a slight shove, looking hard
at Willy’s left foot.
“ If yer don’t leave me alone, I’ll give yer in
charge. ’Ere’s a slop cornin’ now.”
The greasy one looked sharply down the foot-
path, and then went back to his post.
“I’ll make it ’ot fer you some day, sonny, see
if I don’t. I’ll make yer sorry yer was ever born,
yer nark—yer ugly son of a cow. ”
Willy paled perceptibly, but kept his ground.
“ I’ll give yer two minutes ter get out of this
quick and lively. I’m not goin’ ter waste me day
waitin’ here, I can tell yer. Yer a blessed nark,
that’s wot yer are. ”
“ I kin stan’ ’ere if I like. It’s nuthin’ ter do
with you. I kin stan’ ’ere till ter-morrer mornin’
and nobody’s got enny call to interfere with me.”
“ Yer can stan’ ’ere till a earthquake shifts yer,
as far as I’m concerned, but I wanter see wot’s
there under yer left foot, and I means ter see if I
stays ’ere a week. I means ter see in five minutes,
so there.”
“ There’s nothin’ under me foot.”
“ Oh, don't talk ter me.”
“ I’m tellin’yer the trewf. I alius speaks the
trewf. I wuz well brought up, and taught ter
speak the trewf.”
The man who had secured the half-cigar in the
morning again came shuffling quickly down the
gutter.
“ Hullo ! ” he said, when he came abreast of
them. “ Yous two ’ere still ?”
Receiving no answer, he asked, “ Wot’s ther
game, ennyhow?”
“ Nuthin’, Stinker,” said Willy.
The fat hunter made no comment, but kept his
eyes on Willy’s left foot. Stinker looked at the
greasy man, and followed the direction of his
gaze to Willy’s left foot.
“ Wot’s wrong wif yer foot, Willy?’’
“Nuthin’.”
“Ye’re a liar. Ye’ve got somefing under it.”
He gave Willy a mighty shove, and picked up
a round yellow object.
“ A bit of cardboard,” he said.
The two men crowded up to him and examined
it closely.
“ I thought it was a sov’ring,” said the greasy
man.
“ It looks like a sov’ring,” said Willy.
“ It’s meant to look like a sov’ring,” said
Stinker. “ Wot’s ther writin’ on the back of it ?
‘ Save er pound by buyin’ yer clo’s at Smif’s,
tailor.’”
The greasy man snorted. "■*
“He can keep his blasted clo’s. I won’t
patronise him.”
“Nor me neither,” said Willy. “So long.”
“ Or rewore.”
“ Ta-ta,” said Stinker.
And the Hunters of Small Game passed on
their several quests.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
"WyERA was a vegetarian diamond of the

there was a secluded corner in which George
might sit with her and acquire knowledge con-

“Er—tea?” demanded George, eyeing the
aproned spinster who approached.
“Oh, yes—tea, please,” answered Yera, coyly,
“Tea?” echoed the spinster-waitress. “We
don’t provide tea ! ”
«. o h,” murmured George, faintly, “ I—er—oh,

an( j looked appealingly at Vera,
“P’r’aps there’s something else we can get?”
said Vera, brightly.
“Nut broth,” said the waitress, “mineral

George under his breath]-“ lemon squash, hop
beer, carrot claret—any of those we have.

“I think I’ll take some nut broth,” she purred.
“Nut broth for two,” ordered George, as though
to the manner born, and smiled at Vera. “What
’ll you take with it ? ”
“We have raisin croquettes,” broke in the
waitress, with catlike eagerness, “raisin cro-
“Well, I think I’ll take—l’ll take a whole-
wheat waffle,” decided Vera. “What are you
going to have? ”
George was owlishly solemn,
“Why—er—” he hesitated, and flushed, “I
er—l’ll take a—er—a husky hunk, I think . and
he fidgeted uncomfortably with his collar.
“Nut broth two,” checked the waitress, glibly.
“ Whole-wheat waffles and husky hunks, and she
departed in prim haste. , ,
In due course the nut broth arrived, and was
slowly despatched between compliments.
“Tastes like oatmeal,” suggested George, with
a twinkle, lapping at his glass.
“ They say it’s very nourishing, said Vera.
Vera was plump and sizeable. George regarded
her figure with a roving eye, and Vera, caught
him doing it. George flushed, and Vera kept
him company.
The waitress descended upon them witn the
waffles and husky hunks.
“ Like anything more ? ” she asked.
“Yes, take something else,” urged George,
politely.
The waitress came to the rescue.
“We have beans in apple jelly,” she advised,
“cabbage cake, gluten sticks —gluten sticks are
nice.” , , ...
“I’ll try a gluten stick,’ agreed Yera, with
courage.
“ Gluten sticks for two, said George.
“Two gluten sticks,” said the waitress.
“ Thank you ! ”
“Funny names they give ’em,” said George,
cheerfully. “S’pose lamb chops and tomato
sauce’d sound just as funny if we were all vege-
tarians.”
“ You’ll get used to them,” said Vera, warmly,
with a glance of gentle confidence that smote
George’s soul with alternate pangs of pleasure
and foreboding. It is one thing to pursue a
beautiful maiden for herself alone, and quite
another to land oneself in a life wherein love and
green-stuffs are inextricably mingled.
The gluten sticks were presently served, and
with their arrival the conversation began to lan-
guish. Shortly it received a blow from which it
never recovered.
“A nice, quiet place down here,” murmured
Vera.
George was occupied with his glutinous refresh-
ment.
“Ye—m!” he replied, and struggled fora
moment, and then swallowed with apparent diffi-
culty. “ Yes ! ”
He took another gnaw- at the gluten stick.
“Yes, it’s quite close to Corrorrorr —” he began,
in a moment; and then stopped, and swallowed
again with difficulty. “ So close to Collins-street,”
he went on, having conquered his piece of gluten-
stick, “and yet as quiet as—as you’d like !”
Vera was approaching her latest vegetable with
a cautious mien, and had lost her interest in
George’s appetite. She nibbled a very small
piece, and looked up in time to see George duti-
fully take a further good-sized bite at his fodder.
“We’ll come down here again, one day,” she
cooed kindly.
“Gr-rmph!” answered George, nodding ami-
ably, with a wan smile. ‘ ‘ Shafoo whurr— rrmph! ”
At his last examination he turned suddenly
serious, and his complexion changed to a painful
crimson. George’s teeth were not all his own,
and the gluten had done its deadly work only too
well. George pulled out his handkerchief.
“ Berrer go wow ? ” George glared agonisingly
across at the door.
Vera gathered in her sunshade. It was an
occasion for womanly tact.
“I think I’d better be. . . ” she sighed, and
rose, with a swish of silken skirts.
“Hahoo!” said George, and seized his hat,
masticating hurriedly. He went bitterly up to
the cash-register.
When the change was given him, “ Hanksh ! ”
he groaned from ampng the gluten, “Hanksh ! ”
and they went silently out into the street together,
George still fumbling with his handkerchief.

Dead March.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
SAID the Gun Wheels, turning slow:
“We have carried many so,
And this simple truth we know—
‘ Life is short ’ ;
Though it be his turn to-day,
Ere another month you may
Take the slow and lonely way
To Death’s port.’’
( Well he slept upon the sand
With his rifle in his hand !)
Said the Gun Wheels, turn by turn :
“ You are ever slow to learn,
Elemental truths you spurn
With disdain ;
Death is next you while you brag
Of your strength—your trade—your flag—
(With a patriotic tag);
It is vain ! ”
(Will the fool unarmed remain
When the warrior lies slam 1)
Said the Gun Wheels, wise and old,
As they slowly onward rolled :
“ Shall we mourn him that lies cold
On the gun ?
Shall we grieve that he has passed
To the Silence, splendid, vast,
Of God’s mercies best and last ?
He has won
Where the armed archangels keep
Watch and ward upon his sleep.”
Said the Gun Wheels on the grass :
“ Men and nations thus shall pass
When the sands in God’s hour-glass
Have run out;
But they rest within the Lord
Who have girded on the sword,
By their strength are they restored.”
(Do you doubt
That God watches well the sands
That you stand with empty hands ?)
Gray and silent on the lea
Stood the Wheels of Destiny,
While close by Eternity
Ope’d its breast,
And the bugle’s mourning note
Seemed the Future’s voice, remote,
Sobbing—sobbing in its throat
Without rest.
(And the setting sun sank red
On the silent, shrouded dead.)

Mr. J. Williams, of Northern Sta-
tion, N. E. Port Augusta, sends his
photo and writes that he has been a
sufferer from impure blood and indi-
gestion, with pimples on his face, and
blackheads. He was always taking
medicines of some kind, with no re-
lief until he began with Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla and Ayer’s Pills. He took
in all three bottles of the Sarsaparilla
"and two bottles of the Pills, with the
result that the pimples and black-
heads disappeared and he was relieved
entirely of his indigestion.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
acts directly upon the blood-forming glands of the body, stimulating them to
produce healthy, rich, red blood ; the kind of blood that brings a good whole-
some color to the lips and cheeks, clearing away pimples and blackheads.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol. Be
sure that you get “AYER’S,” not some worthless imitation.
Take Ayer’s Pills with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. One aids the other

You will look like yourself again
when you get rid of that muddy complexion, when the whites of your eyes
lose that yellowish tinge, when a touch o£ Nature's carmine tints your cheeks,
vnen your step is firm and your general appearance suggests that you are not
doubled with “nerves,” when you are able to take a ten-mile walk or tackle an
extra turn of hard work without undue fatigue, when you enjoy your food
suffer no uneasy sensations
after taking
your meals, when you sleep soundly and look life gladly in the face, ready to
encounter its inevitable difficulties, your mind free from gloomy forebodings.
And all this will happen directly you start taking Bee chant's Pills. To be
in health your liver must be doing its work thoroughly, your stomach free from
dyspeptic weakness, your blood flowing pure and life-giving through your veins.
These essential conditions to physical well-being are undoubtedly to be secured
by an intelligent use of
