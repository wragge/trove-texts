KALCOLOR really started something
Since we introduced Kalcolor aluminium finishes to
Australian architects, the fade-resistant colours of the
unique Kalcolor range have become the hallmark
of an ever-growing list of major city buildings.
In Sydney, buildings like Carlton Centre, Associated
National House, British Tobacco House, Dalgety &
New Zealand Loan, Lasalle and the Water Board build-
ing are being joined by the Australia Square Tower,
Qantas-Wentworth Hotel and others. In Melbourne the
Cultural Centre and S.E.C. Building, Adelaide’s
Reserve Bank and Brisbane’s Manufacturers Mutual
Insurance Building have been specified with a
Kalcolor finish from Comalco.
Now, with years of successful experience in Kalcolor
application working closely with the sole licensed
processor, Aluminium Anodisers Pty.Ltd. we have
added two colours to the range: statuary bronze
and grey.
More and more architects are specifying this
revolutionary anodising process with its extra
resistance to abrasion and corrosion and improved
fade-resistance. In doing so, they are drawing on
Comalco’s practical experience in Kalcolor aluminium.
If it’s a question of architectural aluminium and
Kalcolor in particular contact a Comalco Sales
Manager in any capital city.
Kalcolor aluminium is available in the
following range of colours: Gold, Light Bronze,
Bronze, Statuary Bronze, Grey, Black.

Here's a typical deadwood jungle! An eyesore in anybody's
language. Overhead wires, poles and pylons in an endless
profusion of ugliness that belongs in another age. Traffic
hazards, footpath clutterers. Is this the way we want to build for
our world of tomorrow? Is this the promise in our future? And
it’s all so unnecessary. The answer is simple. Underground Cable.
Let’s follow the lead of other modern progressive cities
throughout the world and ask our local authorities for Copper
Underground Cables. Copper means less maintenance; is
everlasting. Copper means an end to deadwood and overhead wires!

Indonesian Massacre
Sir,,
In the past few weeks there has been
-correspondence, including last week’s
Bulletin article, drawing attention to the
massacres in Indonesia—virtually one
of the century’s most terrible massacres.
During the first part of the Army’s
actions in Indonesia in September and
October of last year, attempts were
made by unions to contact the Indone-
sian national trade union organisation,
SOBSI, without success. The Indo-
nesian trade union movement in
1962 was reported by Australian ob-
servers to number some four million,
of which three million were unions
affiliated with SOBSI, the rest be-
ing affiliated with ten other trade union
centres, all of whom co-operated in a
joint secretariat.
Reports in the daily Press indicated
that the trade union organisations were
under attack and many trade union
leaders had been massacred and a num-
ber of workers jailed. In the following
months unions continued to try to make
contact with the Indonesian trade
unions and were completely unsuccess-
ful. On May 26, a deputation of five
Federal Union officials representing
nineteen unions met Major General
Kosasih, Indonesian Ambassador, and
presented him with a letter of protest
signed by 18 unions.
The Ambassador assured the dele-
gation he would convey to his govern-
ment the terms of the letter and spoke
of the appreciation of the support given
by the Australian trade unions in the
Indonesian struggle for independence
in 1945-46.
The delegation, however, pressed for
names and addresses of the unions to
make their own individual contact in
the normal manner as had been the
case prior to the army takeover. To
this date there has been no reply or
any information from the Indo-
nesian Government, the Ambassador, or
from the Indonesian trade unions. This
is a matter of international significance
and one which the Australian Govern-
ment and the international labor organ-
isations must immediately pay attention
to and register their protests and de-

Night at the P. & C .
Sir,
In THE BULLETIN of August 6
your correspondent Jean Tierney regrets
that in my short sketch “A Night at
the P. & C.” (8., June 25) no ack-
nowledgement was made to a novel,
“Hopeton High,” written by her father,
Brian James. My answer is simply that
I have never heard of her father, nor
have I heard of or read his book. Your
correspondent will just have to find
such solace as she can in the reflection
that the long arm of coincidence is
longer than she thought it was.

The Orr Case
Sir,
While no one wishes to take advan-
tage of a man’s death to state a case,
I feel compelled to reply to the cur-
rent spate of rather sickening eulogies
of Sydney Sparkes Orr. Admittedly
this is not the most tactful time to
raise my voice on the other side of
the fence, but then critics of Orr have
always been labelled as vicious pervert-
ers of the truth.
The simplest way to cope with the
type of obituary I have mentioned
(which just falls short of canonisation)
is to prepare a glossary of terms. For
“philosophical idealist” read “wishful
thinker,” for “struggle for justice” read
“aggressive evasion of the point,”
“uncompromising honesty” becomes
“that’s my story and I’m sticking to it,”
and so on. I have always envied people
who have been able to rationalise
“truth” as something they want to be-
lieve irrespective of what really hap-
pened.
Orr, I suppose, will become a kind
of folk hero, the little man who fought
against the system for the principles
of truth, justice, honor, etc. I
don’t suppose anybody ever spares a
thought for the Kemp family, or won-
ders what became of them. Suffice to
say that Reg Kemp died several years
ago and the family has never recovered
from the shock of “The Orr Case.”
But, of course, that is irrelevant to the
canonisers.
Those who were in Tasmania at the
time, and knew the people concerned,
have always found it difficult to come
to terms with “mainland experts”
chanting the gospel of the “Divine
Right of the Academic.” It is a pity
that the University mishandled the
manner of Orr’s dismissal.
Wouldn’t it have been so much better
if Orr had accepted his dismissal and
retired gracefully from the scene? (I
can hear in my ears the wild screams
of the Orr supporters.) At least the
Philosophy Department of the Univer-
sity of Tasmania would have been able
to attract a first-rate professor who
would have been able to teach philo-
sophy to students denied the privi-
lege of studying the subject through
the efforts of the man who claimed to
the last to have their interests at heart.

packaging materials that meet modern requirements.
It looks as though this man is using a weighing
machine and in a sense it is. He’s using a
carton board testing instrument designed to help
weigh up an A.P.M. product’s qualities as efficient
packaging material. That’s his job . . . helping to
raise the standards of A.P.M. papers and paperboards
to meet the special requirements of modern pack-
aging. A.P.M.’s printing and packaging laboratories

orphans or abandoned children. Some
are suffering from physical disabilities;
they are blind, deaf, dumb, or crippled;
all are very poor; all are desperately
in need of someone to take an interest
in them and love them.
The association helps such children
by arranging for a sponsor to “adopt”
a child in an orphanage or similar in-
stitution. Sponsors may be individuals
or groups of people.
The sponsor or group pays $37.00 a
year toward the care and education of
a child, chosen by him, and he cor-
responds with the child. This last is most
important. The child, even the youngest,
seems to improve remarkably with the
knowledge of someone’s interest out-
side his environment. The association
has collected numerous case histories
and photographs from four Asian coun-
tries India, Korea, Hong Kong, and
Japan. Recently we have added South
Africa and South Vietnam to the grow-
ing list of institutions requesting aid.
From the original 13 children spon-
sored we now have 129, and the number
waiting for sponsors is 120. The list
grows daily. I am a sponsor and can
assure readers the need for more is very
great.

Foreign Investment
Sir,
It was interesting to read “J. C.
Horsfall’s Melbourne” (8., July 30).
The implied assumptions that when
overseas companies come to Australia
they necessarily bring with them
superior management schools plus
technical knowhow is typical of the
approach to overseas investment in
this country.
The particular case of the motor and
motor spares industries demonstrates
that if they are so efficient, then the
large companies must be remitting
enormous undisclosed profits overseas
in the form of over-priced purchases
or licence fees, or that there is just
not the much-vaunted efficiency.
Manufacture of cars has been
carried on here for 18 years. All the
setting up and initial training prob-
lems have been overcome by now. Our
industry has developed to become one
of the top seven of the world in
volume. The output rate of our largest
producer is similar to the output of
the fourth biggest producer in the low-
price field in the United States. Thus
we cannot say any more that we have
not got sufficient volume to get eco-
nomic production rates.
In spite of all this, an Australian has
to work more than twice as long as
an equivalent American to earn enough
money to buy a new car, even allow-
ing for our higher taxation.
Again, compare production costs. A
typical American assembly-line worker

earns more than Aust. $2.50 per hour,
whereas for the same job the earning-
rate in Australia is about $l.lO, again
allowing for differences in fringe bene-
fits.
Thus for a large manufacturer in
Australia, who is as efficient as an
American manufacturer of the same
size, the produced cost of a car should
be about Aust. $9OO for a Chevrolet or
Ford Galaxie sized car. The ex-factory
price of a popular car in Australia is
about $l5OO and this is a smaller
car which would be easier to make
than the bigger vehicle.
The car manufacturing business in
Australia is totally dominated by
foreign capital, and we can ask what
benefits we have, or are going to re-
ceive, from this capital. It has been
demonstrated above that we have not
been given an efficient car industry, or,
if we have, the eventual buyer of the
car is not getting any benefits from
the efficiency.
R. J. HILL
Artarmon (N.SAV.)
Sir,
“Is this the kiss of death?” asks
J. C. Horsfall in his article “Hold Back
the Yankee Hordes” (8., July 7). Take
the N.S.W. Railways, who last year, on
paper, showed a profit of $l6 million,
but after interest and sinking-fund com-
mitments had been met ended up with
a deficit of $l2 million, showing the
patrons of the Railways supplied out-
side interests with $2B million.
The Victorian Railways are in much
the same plight, and in this State we
have a crisis in education and hos-
pitals, all due to an antiquated system
of debt finance which is costing the
nation $lO million per week in interest
payments to institutions who contribute
nothing to our welfare.
I would like to quote from a speech
made by the first Governor of the Com-
monwealth Bank when it opened for
business on January 20, 1913. “This
bank is being started without capital,
as none is required, as it is backed by
the entire wealth and credit of the
whole of the Commonwealth.”
When World War I started 20 months
later the bank floated ten internal loans
producing, at that time, the huge total
of £275 million for war purposes at a
cost of 5-7th percent. We are now
being told that if money comes from
overseas everything is dandy, but if
we produce it ourselves it causes in-
flation.

Immediate action must be taken to

It is in this latter aspect that the
Commonwealth Government could play
a valuable role by advancing a grant

N. W. Crisis
Sir,
Your correspondent (J. S. Parsons)
in Letters July 30, 1966, in his
second sentence extolls the historical
virtues of the record of Concrete In-
dustries (Monier) Ltd.
In reaching this conclusion, and pre-
sumably in acquiring the shares, he has
obviously over-looked the overall de-
cline in earnings since 1961 (down
25 percent), a similar reversal in in-
ternal strength, and an increase in the
gearing of the company.
By historical effort, the company’s
“fine record of past achievements”
has hardly been exemplified in the
financial arena. His present individual
plight is due to whom?
JOHN W. KENNEDY
Kew (Vic.)
[Air. Kennedy has done his sums
on the basis of the Australian Stock
Factograph, a publication of Cowan
Investment Services Pty. Ltd., of which
he is an assistant to the editor, and
which recently suggested that its clients
sell their shares. His own publica-
tion indicates the company had at least
a respectable record up to 1960 and
that its 1964 results (and market per-
formance) indicated it was recovering
from the 1961 recession. The subse-
quent fall in earnings and market
price appears due in the main to the
North West Cape situation, particularly
as the involvement of huge sums of
company money at North West Cape
has severely limited its other oper-
ations and forced the sale of some
profitable assets of the group. —•

THE JEWS IN AUSTRALIA
86 Years Ago: August 21, 1880
A BOUT a third of the current issue
x of the WITNESS is set apart for
the special edification of the Jews.
The front page is addressed to the
Jewish laity, to whom it indicates “the
probable date of their spiritual restor-
ation.” By whom are our prisons
filled - by those who call themselves
Christians or by Jews? Do we Aus-
tralians ever hear of a Jew deserting
his wife and leaving her and her
children to die in the gutter, or live
in misery and shame? Is it not a fact
that the average Jew is every whit as
charitable in purse and much more
charitable in speech than are such
“Christians” as those who, caricatur-
ing the writers of the Apostles, scribble
absurd letters to those whom they
think heathen? Does the Jew ever in-
sultingly obtrude his religious belief
on his fellow-man? Judaism, in the
light of its results, means, in Australia
at any rate, morality, happiness, and
opulence. The social condition of the
Hebrews of Sydney affords a strange
and unpalatable satire on our boasted
Christianity. The editor of the WIT-
NESS, in lecturing the Jews, is guilty
of a gross impertinence.

What a wine label tells you about
the wine it labels
the year the wine was made, allowing
you to judge the 'age' that the wine
has achieved. In Australia, nearly every
year is a 'good' year for wine so
you don't have to memorise a long list
of 'special' years.
Dalwood is the name of the historic
Penfolds vineyard and winery in the
eart of the Hunter Valley birthplace of
many of Australia's finest table wines.
Here is your assurance that there are
at least five or six'wineglassfulis
the exact number depends on the
size of your wineglass.

CLARET
•ve Bottling
Wt. BFL.OZ&-
This is the name of the Vintner (the
man, family or firm that made the wine).
When the label of your wine reads
Penfoids, you know that the wine you
are about to enjoy is the product
of 122 years experience in winemaking.
Here you discover the character of
the wine. Hermitage is a variety
of grape, and Claret denotes a red wine
dry and light in body. It's especially
suitable for meals, particularly barbecues
and good traditional English Roast Beef.
However, don't feel that red wines
must be served only with red meats
a claret can be equally delicious
with chicken or fish.
That's how easy and informative
reading a wine label can be.
Tonight, spend a couple of minutes
reading the label on the wine
you serve. In fact, why not start a
collection of wine labels.

No News from Townsville!
THE Federal Treasurer, Mr. W.
McMahon, cleared up at
least one point in his Townsville
interview last week: he confirmed
THE BULLETIN’S guess a
guess which had to be made be-
cause the authorities conceal the
actual figures that Australia
holds about $B5O million in sterling
(about two-thirds of our overseas
reserves) and therefore had been
risking the loss of $l3O million in
the event of devaluation during the
recent sterling crisis.
It is good to have the Treasurer’s
authority for the seriousness of our
risk, but in his criticism of
THE BULLETIN he did not
answer the basic questions why we
are running this risk at all and
whether or not we intend to con-
tinue doing so. He even introduced
two fresh arguments into the
matter, one quite new but unreal
and the other quite irrelevant. The
new one is that Australia’s risk is
offset by the $750 million which
Australia owes Britain in long-
term obligations. The point is that
private British institutions have
placed this money in Australian
Government loans as a normal
risk-taking investment, it is not a
deposit of uncertain amount made
by one Government in another
country for non - commercial
reasons. The irrelevant argument is
that since we are the greatest
holders of sterling, it would not
be in our interest to crash out
now, since this would precipitate
devaluation, the risk of which we
want to avoid, and produce a
slump in commodity prices which
must damage our export trade.
This is perfectly true, but no one
suggests this should be done. The
real questions are why such a large
proportion of our overseas reserves
have been allowed to rest for so
long in London; why there has
not been a steady diversification
into other currencies in keeping
with Australia’s lessening depen-
dence on trade with Britain; and
what is to be our future policy.
The reason why so much money
has been kept in London is the
primary mystery. It cannot be as
a reward for Britain’s East of Suez
policy, for in that case the amount
of money in London should be go-
ing down fast. It cannot be to
keep the Commonwealth as a
strong trading unit, for in that case
the Common Market negotiations
alone should have prompted a dis-
posal sale of sterling securities. It
cannot be a quid pro quo for such
economic concessions as British
preferential tariffs, for Britain gets
far more out of our preferential
tariff situation than Australia does
in Britain. It cannot be because,
as Mr. McMahon claimed, we are
earning an interest rate as high as
six percent (“Nowhere else in the
world can you get an interest rate
as high as six percent”), because
this does not justify the risk of a
loss of 15 to 20 percent. It can
only be because of old loyalties
and of unthinking and unenter-
prising habits loyalties which
Britain does not let interfere with
her self-interest and habits which
we can no longer afford and which
should be broken, not dramatically
but gradually. Sterling is still not
safe, $l3O million is still at risk,
our trading pattern does not justify
it. These are the issues to which
one would like to see Mr.
McMahon address himself.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Living with Dr. Cairns
AS a result of the Surfers Paradise Federal Conference decision, the ALP is
probably out of the electoral woods on the State Aid issue. But it is
still not completely in the clear. It still has foreign affairs and Vietnam
to get over before it can face the forthcoming Federal elections with confidence.
An increasing number of Labor Par-
liamentarians have been visiting South-
East Asia in recent times. An increas-
ing number of these Asian sojourners
are returning with doubts about the
wisdom or practicality of Labor’s policy
in this area. So far the line has been
held. The ALP machine, which feder-
ally has been Left-wing dominated
(though this domination was shaken a
little by events at Surfers Paradise),
has imposed its views upon the Par-
liamentarians. They have been told to
toe the machine line on foreign affairs
and Vietnam and generally they have
toed it.
But the number of those Labor Par-
liamentarians uneasy about these policies
appears to be growing. As they return
to Australia from their overseas studies,
they are increasingly bolder in indicat-
ing views which, if they do not differ
greatly from the ALP machine view-
point, at least suggest concern about
issues on which the Opposition Leader,
Mr. Calwell, and the ALP machine have
stated they want the forthcoming Fed-
eral election fought.
Oddly, the person who first shook
Labor Parliamentarians most was an
Asian, Lee Kuan-yew, the Socialist
Prime Minister of Singapore. Lee Kuan-
yew sometime ago invited two Aus-
tralian Labor delegations to Singapore,
one consisting of Labor Parliamen-
tarians and the other ALP officials.
According to what Captain Sam Ben-
son, Victorian MHR and Labor’s Par-
liamentary defence expert, has been
telling a series of Victorian ALP meet-
ings, Lee told the Parliamentarians,
with Deputy Opposition Leader Gough
Whitlam present, that the struggle in
Vietnam was not only not “unwinnable”
but had to be won in the interests of
the smaller nations of Asia; but for the
American presence in Vietnam, Singa-
pore would fall under Chinese domina-
tion within a very brief time, though it,
like the other smaller Asian nations, had
no wish to fall under such domination;
rather than producing dislike of Aus-
tralia among Asian nations, Australia’s
assistance in Vietnam was being
applauded; and, finally, he (Lee)
wanted the ALP to know the realities of
the situation and to appreciate it and
not to proceed upon mistaken assump-
tions.
Now, of all people, Dr. Jim Cairns,
the Victorian MHR, who has been an
implacable Labor opponent of the Holt
Government’s policy in Vietnam and
who is currently on his first trip to
Asia, is apparently moderating his
views. On page 94 of his book “Living
with Asia” Cairns wrote, “Intervention
(in Vietnam) harms Australia’s rela-
tions with most Asians . . .”
Last week he was reported as having
said in Saigon, after visiting Djakarta,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok,
and Vietnam, “There is no antagonism
against Australia for her commitment
in the Vietnam war. It is simply re-
garded as our own business and not a
topic for discussion.” Even more
amusing, Dr. Cairns is also credited
with taking a view not wholly dis*
similar with that of Prime Minister
Holt, who said during his recent trip
abroad there were significant moves
... 8 r . .
taking place among the non-Communut
countries of Ana that could improve
considerably the economic well - being
and living standards of the inhabitants
ot the aiea.
Cairns is reported as saying the
countries of the area were making
genuine efforts to solve their economic
problems. I admit you cannot rely en-
tirely upon a second-hand report, par-
ticularly from somebody not accustomed
to reporting Cairns, who, despite his
seeming precision of speech, is often
ambiguous. But even if Cairns said
something only approximating this it
represents quite an important shift in
outlook.
Cairns’ shift may be only marginal.
But there has been nothing marginal
about the attitudes of some of his
colleagues on their return from Asia.
Len Reynolds (N.S.W.) and Manfred
Cross (Qld.), who recently visited Viet-
nam with Senator Joe Fitzgerald
(N.S.W.), publicly expressed uneasiness
about the practicability of bringing
home National Servicemen integrated
in permanent army units.
They were merely continuing the
pattern of doubt existing within the
ranks of Labor Parliamentarians, par-
ticularly those who have visited Asia,
on Labor’s foreign affairs and Viet-
nam policies. Calwell has brushed off
these misgivings with a declaration that
Labor will face the forthcoming Federal
election without a comma in its Viet-
nam policy changed.
But if Whitlam (who according to
Benson already knows Lee’s views)
returns on August 16 from his South-
East Asian trip and publicly expresses
views similar to those expressed by
Cross, Reynolds, and others this could
be the catalyst which would produce
another internal argument within the
Labor party almost on the eve of the
Federal elections. It will be interest-
ing to see whether Whitlam speaks up
or shuts up.
ALAN REID
. . . and Allan Fraser
WHILE even Dr. Cairns seems to be having second thoughts about what is
happening in Asia after actually going there, one of Labor’s stay at homes
was last week taking a familiar line on Vietnam to even greater extremes
than before.
With emotion in his voice the speaker
summed up his position: “The Viet-
namese people have been striving for a
hundred years to throw off a foreign
yoke and to achieve independence.” He
paused, and wrapped it up with a
quiet, simple declaration: “They are
still doing so.”
It might have been a speaker at a
peace-front rally. But it was not. It
was so-called “moderate Labor” Par-
liamentarian and party frontbencher
Mr. Allan Fraser speaking in the refec-
tory of the Australian National Uni-
versity last week. “For the people of
Vietnam the war was then (in the
19405) and is today a war against
foreign invaders and interventionists,”
he said.
“Leaders of the fight for indepen-
dence came from all sections of the
people, although in more recent years,
largely through Ho Chi Minh, the
Communists have been foremost in the
independence movement.” He went on:
“The war was recognised as a war for
independence of colonial people, and
Ho Chi Minh was recognised by the
non-Communist nationalists of Vietnam
and still is as leader of their in-
dependence movement. South Viet-
nam is not now and never has been
a separate nation. If there is any
national South Vietnamese leader his
name is Ho Chi Minh.”
On the basis that Vietnam is one
country Mr. Fraser said: “No foreign
troops have been introduced into Viet-
nam since the Geneva agreement except
the troops of America, Australia, and
associated countries fighting the in-
dependence forces.”
Whatever the Viet Cong might have
done and Mr. Fraser did not bore
his listeners with the details “the sur-
reptitious introduction into South Viet-
nam in defiance of the Geneva Agree-
ment of immense amounts of Ameri-
can arms and war materials constituted
a far more serious violation.”


Adelaide’s Long Hard Winter
LABOR in South Australia misses the sun. There is a wintry dampness about
the Walsh Government in its second year that makes last summer, full of
breathless energy and the crack of change (97 Bills in a single session)
look already like a first fine careless rapture that has unaccountably subsided.
The unemployment ratio, 18 months
ago the second lowest in the Com-
monwealth, has become the second
highest; the Budget is $8 million in the
red; and the Opposition, in the act of
changing its leaders, has found a new-
line of attack and its marching orders
for next year’s elections.
The first Labor Government in 33
years began in a hurry with a social-
reform program, written or prompted
mainly by Mr. Don Dunstan, the
Attorney-General. Mr. Dunstan was -
and to many people still is the pace-
setter and direction finder. He is in the
legend the young, charismatic figure
slicing his way through the social back-
wardness left by a generation of Liberal
rule before he yields to the admiration
of his Sydney admirers and the beat
of his inner drum and departs reluc-
tantly, but blazingly, for Canberra. He
is certainly the Government’s main
source of ideas, and there is no sign
that he is anywhere near the bottom of
a prolific barrel.
But South Australia has an infinite
capacity for not being surprised, and
it has not taken long to learn to live
with Mr. Dunstan. Partly the reason
is that he is careful, as a rule, to avoid
a head-on attack against the backwoods-
men; partly this is a State literally
far more interested in minding its busi-
ness than in ideas.
In the Playford years it became so
used to having its politics translated into
new industry, new housing sprawls, or
some other form of development
usually with a fanfare on television
that it is genuinely at a loss to know
how to treat the sort of legislation that
this Government is bringing down as
anything but the trimmings.
This explains the Government’s
present unhappiness. Because it is not
producing new' industries in anything
like the Playford style, it is losing touch.
It hopes, of course, that the spring
will see a change, an upturn in em-
ployment, more hopeful-looking in-
quiries from visiting industrialists, and
some relief from the Treasury over-
draft. But, meanwhile, the Liberals,
under their new young leader, Mr.
Steele Hall, are making the best of
the contrast between the time the Gov-
ernment spends on its social program
from off-course betting to raising the
status of Aborigines and the slow-
down in development.
The Premier, always slow on his feet,
has shuffled round the ring without
knowing exactly how to hit back. He
blames the credit squeeze and the state
of the loan market even the Warden
of the Cinque Ports. He asked plain-
tively the other day if he expected
to provide a new industry every week.
(He is.) He has been weaving his way
out of range of the charge of being
unenterprising by appointing two public-
relations men (one from Mr. Dunstan’s
.office) to whip up new business. But
he is now taking a hammering for his
supposed selling-out of one of the only-
two advantages that South Australia
had in bidding for new industries. This
was that it was a low-cost-of-living
State.
The other was a good immunity from
strikes or, to. put it another way, the
possession of an extraordinarily docile
labor force. The punches are that
by handing out from $2 million to $4
million inservice pay, by increasing
teachers' salaries, particularly for
Don Dunstan - missing the sun.
women, and a few other such
“extravagances,” he is having to in-
crease things like water rates, land
tax, and wharfage dues, and so
surrendering a precious asset.
Again, the hope is that everything
will look better as the year warms up;
and if Mr. Walsh can promise natural
gas from Gidgeal, in the not too distant
future he should not have to worry
over-much about a new industrial mo-
mentum. For the moment there is Noth-
ing more startling in sight than his
intention to set up a State Insurance
Office in South Australia. State in-
surance has the double attraction for
the Government of being a money-
earner (unless it has been misled) and
the sort of “progressive” measure that
should put a new' polish on its record
provided its public relations are work-
ing better than they were when the
Legislative Council massacred its Suc-
cession Duties Bill.
The Government is also looking to
its TAB Bill to take some of its worries
off its mind; and before long no doubt
it will be able to bring in 10 o’clock
closing and also the lottery for which
we voted with both hands so that we
might be like the other big boys.
Meanwhile, Mr. Dunstan has
launched his two Aboriginal Bills. The
Opposition does not like either, but is
finding it difficult to say so. One is
a Bill to prevent discrimination, not
only against Aborigines, but against
anyone on the ground of color, race, or
national origin. It is obviously a well-
intentioned Bill and has won dutiful
applause. But it says almost as much
about Donald Dunstan as it does the
Aborigines.
Mr. Dunstan is giving Mr. Holt a
lesson. When he introduced the Bill he
said, as blandly as you like, that its
purpose was “to give effect to the Gov-
ernment’s intimation to the Common-
wealth Government that the Govern-
ment of South Australia believes that
the whole of the UN Draft Convention
on Racial Discrimination should be
ratified by the Commonwealth of Aus-
tralia.” Not that we practise discrim-
ination in South Australia, mark you.
Here “happily we have a community
that clearly disapproves of discrim-
ination.” What Mr. Dunstan wants is
to give a lead to Canberra and even,
he hinted, to Britain.
There is some discrimination in the
northern towns, and Mr. Dunstan him-
self has fought with his usual courage
to break down one of them by in-
sisting that all Aborigines shall have
the right to drink. The trouble is that
until this Bill appeared very few people
thought of discrimination. About a
quarter of the State’s Aborigines live
in Adelaide, and so do 70 percent of
the rest of us. No doubt there is some
discrimination, but not one person in
100 would come across it. Now it be-
comes a punishable offence. It might
have been better to have said nothing
about it.
Otherwise, the Bill is interesting for
two reasons. One is that it could be
invoked by New Australians and is in-
tended also to smooth our relations
with Asians. The other is that though it
is modelled on the American Civil
Rights Bill, it omits any mention of dis-
crimination on the grounds of sex. For
a Minister who was responsible for
the appointment of Australia’s only
woman judge, that seems an odd over-
sight.
The other Bill, which provides for
the setting up of a Trust of Aborigines
to administer the Aboriginal reserves,
shows another of Mr. Dunstan’s several
sides. He sees this as a belated act of
justice. When he brought the Bill in he
unearthed the Letters Patent under
which South Australia was settled in
1836 to show that the commissioners
laid it down that there was to be no
interference with the occupation of any

Wonderful way
to find a new
export market!
Far-seeing (and sight-seeing) business men are
flocking to South Africa these days. Each year,
South Africa’s imports exceed $2,177 million,
including goods from scores of progressive
Australian firms. In this immensely prosperous
land, the market is wide open for quality goods
the same kind of goods we make here in Australia.
In fact, South Africa is one of the few overseas
countries where all-Australian firms have estab-
lished their own manufacturing subsidiaries.
As part of a world trip, visiting South Africa
costs very little in extra air fares. You’re in
Johannesburg overnight with South African
Airways. Within South Africa, fast, frequent
S.A.A. Boeing 727 services cover the country.
Daily S.A.A. jet services take you on to Europe
and the U.K.
N.B. Whilst in South Africa, surely you want to take a few days to
visit one of the fabulous wild game reserves, enjoy the big-city sights
and nights, explore Zululand, the Drakensberg Mountains, the
Kimberley diamond mines? This is one of the few hospitable
countries where a successful business trip can become a memorable
holiday. Your travel agent will welcome your enquiry.

lands enjoyed or occupied by Aborigines.
But, of course, the Aborigines might
“cede” their land, and where they did
the Commissioners directed that of
every 80 acres taken up by the settlers
16 should be reserved for the Aborigines.
Mr. Dunstan cannot see that the
commissioners’ good intentions are
finally carried out, but he feels he is
doing the next best thing by letting
them control the lands now set aside
for them and giving them both security
and the benefit of any oil gas or
mineral bonanzas that may come to
light.
When he first introduced the Bill last
session he was unaware that oil ex-
ploration leases had been granted to
cover most of the reserves. He has had
to let the leases stand, but there is a
provision that should oil be discovered
the royalties will go to the Trust—not
to the Government. He has made one
other retreat. If the Trust should play
dog in the manger to a promising
mineral find or, as the Bill puts it,
should the Trust be “unreasonable,”
then Parliament can insist that the Min-
ing Act shall apply. Which suggests that
the Trust’s independence is not going to
be quite as strong as even Mr. Dun-
stan’s intentions.
The cheapest thing said so far about
him is that he is out to break records
(as a reformer) with these two Bills. It
came from the former Liberal Minister
for Agriculture, Mr. Brookman, who was
lucky to escape as lightly as he did.
Tangling with the extremely articulate
Mr. Dunstan has its hazards even for
the quick-witted—and Mr. Brookman is
hardly that. True, it also has the relish
of being a match with the most likely
successor to Mr. Walsh as the next
Labor Premier; but that is a taste that
has to be acquired.
Mr. Walsh must stand down next
year under Labor’s local retirement
rule. The Attorney-General would make
a brilliant successor and, at 40, a youth-
ful one —if brilliance and youth are what
the Party is looking for. The Liberals’
choice of the 3 7-year-old Steele Hall to
follow Sir Thomas Playford and a
deliberate search for young men to
fill three coming vacancies may be
forcing Labor to move the same way,
though the Party has seldom shown a
fondness for young faces in the past
J. EDGECOMBE
Sex and the
Prisoner
A PROPOSAL in the journal of the
British Marriage Guidance Coun-
cil that the wives of prisoners
should be allowed to meet their hus-
bands in private in order to deal with
sexual needs received a remarkably
tolerant reception in Sydney last week.
Although the New South Wales re-
formist Minister of Justice, John Mad-
dison, was for once “unavailable for
comment,” there were others prepared
to move into the breach. Thus the Rev.
W. G. Coughlan, outspoken director
of the Marriage Guidance Council of
N.S.W. (and a former president of the
Prison Reform League), said he had
long favored the introduction of this
system in N.S.W. prisons. It would, he
said, both help to keep families together
and also counteract homosexuality in
jails. And an editorial in “The Sun”
headed PRISON AND SEX, after re-
ferring to the proposal as “bold but
thorny,” stated that both “mercy and
reason” supported the argument that a
man’s sentence should not sexually
deprive his wife and threaten to smash
his marriage. A somewhat opaque pas-
sage about prisons being “unnatural
and sex-haunted. No man should be
sentenced to what goes on in them,”
was presumably intended to refer to the
problem of homosexuality,
It may well be that the novel source
of the proposal together with the
emphasis on the needs of the wife and
the desirability of keeping families to-
gether were responsible for its
singularly calm acceptance. In the
past penal reformers have tended to
emphasise the sexual needs of the

prisoner himself and the prevalence of
homosexuality in jails. And although the
idea of conjugal visits has been endorsed
by innumerable penal conferences, the
authorities in England, America, and
Australia have so far refused to adopt
this method of dealing with what all
prison administrators acknowledge
privately if not publicly to be a
major problem.
Elsewhere things are different. A
recent international survey of current
correctional practices conducted by the
American (Ford Foundation financed)
Institute for the Study of Crime and
Delinquency reported very favorably
on the way in which the sexual drives
of prisoners are “realistically respected”
both in the U.S.S.R. and Sweden.
“An occasional interlude with a wife in
a dismal little guesthouse,” says the
report, in reference to Soviet practices,
“scarcely meets the conditions of
romance or even dignity, but as main-
tenance of marital realities and as
relief of sexual tensions it makes more
sense than the cat-and-mouse homo-
sexuality so common in Western
prisons.”
Swedish prisoners are allowed to
receive unsupervised visits in their
rooms every fortnight. No measures are
taken to prevent or discourage sexual
intercourse. Moreover verification of

GORDON HAWKINS
Electing Headmasters
SHOULD committees of interested parents appoint High School principals?
The Reader in Chemistry at Melbourne University, Dr. Peter Fensham, made
this suggestion recently to the University’s Graduate Union.
Predictably it was rubbished by the
authorities. However, it is difficult to
see any equivalent step which could go
so far toward freeing State education
from the Straitjacket to which it has
become accustomed.
The standard objection to the pro-
posal is that it would introduce one of
the worst features of American educa-
tion, where the standard of education
depends on the wealth of the neighbor-
hood, and the curriculum on the whims
of the local governors. Consequently,
there are plenty of examples of
incredibly bad teaching to be found in
various places in the United States,
but all of them could be paralleled
within Australia, although we might
not be able to match any of their
better schools.
It is difficult to understand, how-
ever, why the adoption of one feature
of a system should be presumed to
lead inevitably to the wholesale intro-
duction of all the worst characteristics
of that system. Thus, even if a local
committee chose the headmaster, his
salary would still be fixed and met by
the State. Wealthier areas would have
no greater advantage over others than
they derive at present from the more
pleasant living environment they are
able to offer. On the other hand, schools
in poorer areas might be able to find
teachers willing to accept the challenge
they offer, rather than to merely use
them as a stopping-place on the way
toward ease in the affluent suburbs.
The fear of inequality, however,
which is at the root of all our central-
ised educational systems, stems from the
completely unjustified assumption that
there is a real degree of equality under
the present scheme. It is true that a
State-wide system of promotions and
appointments by seniority prevents
many schools rising far above medi-
ocrity, but it does not prevent large
numbers falling well below this level.
These schools are to be found in the
decaying inner suburbs, in the new,
sprawling industrial suburbs, and in
the remoter country towns. In all these
circumstances the needs are likely to
outpace the means. The most success-
ful schools, on the other hand, are
likely to be found in the reasonably
well-established cream-brick and nature-
strip suburbs, where the combination of
a stable staff, keen parents, and suffi-
cient finance is most likely to be found.
At the same time, these schools are
likely to have the least pressing social
problems among their students.
As long as schools have to depend
on their parents’ committees for every-
thing beyond the bare classrooms, for
needs ranging from library books to
assembly halls, from footballs to film-
projectors, so long will inequality be-
tween different areas obtain. A kind of
Rostow’s law of nations applies,
whereby the individual schools go
through a process of depression, take-
off, rapid development, and settled
prosperity. Immediately after estab-
lishment, the school has a battle to
provide its most elementary needs. If
its population is expanding rapidly, or
its parents are poor or uninterested, it
may never get beyond this stage. If
all goes well, however, it will gradually
be able to put a little money aside for
bigger projects. Then, one day, it will
build a canteen, and its income will
double. Eventually it has all its sports
equipment, the basic stocks for the
library, the necessary projectors and
television sets, and it can look ahead to
the major projects.
is the situation which enables
administrators to claim that any
troubles are merely temporary. Every
school is somewhere along this path,
and given the time and energy it must
reach the end. Unfortunately, this end
will not come in time for the students
who are now spending their fourth year
in unheated portable classrooms or
jammed into the spare rooms of a
neighboring primary school.
Unfortunately, also, the educational
results parallel the economic. Just as
the newly established school has the
lowest income, it has the poorest educa-
tional facilities. The school which has
a well-established library is also likely
to have the resources to meet demands
for new and esoteric books from stu-
dents whose interests have been culti-
vated in a stimulating environment,
whereas the school in makeshift accom-
modation, which more than any other
needs to provide stimulation for the
children outside the classroom, will
have both less chance of encouraging
the children to visit its library shelves
and less possibility of persuading those


who do inspect its meagre stocks to
linger among them.
But inequality between schools is not
confined to material facilities. Teachers
like to live and work in the most
pleasing atmosphere, and even a cen-
tralised department cannot force its
best staff into the schools which most
need them. Some teachers may be
forced into the poorer schools on their
first appointment or when they are
seeking promotion, but if the conditions
are too oppressive they will seek the
first opportunity to transfer, or, if there
is no other way out and they hold a
marketable qualification in science or
commerce, they will resign. Staff in-
stability and staff losses impose further
burdens on the remaining teachers, and
the vicious circle continues.
The idea of appointing a head to a
school on the grounds of his suitability
to that particular school, rather than
his general readiness for promotion,
would break this circle in a number of
ways. Not the least of these would be
the opportunity for younger head-
masters to move into demanding posi-
tions while they still have the initiative
and enthusiasm to cope with them. The
example of Dr. Wyndham as Director-
General in N.S.W. is an indication of
what this can mean at the top of a
department; there is no reason why
equally important results should not
flow from instituting a similar prac-
tice at lower levels. A headmaster,
moreover, has a greater chance of put-
ting his ideas into practice than does
a director, who has politicians immedi-
ately over him and long chains of
underlings below coming between his
plans and the children in the class-
rooms.
, . .
JJOWLVER, y° uth alone ,s not a
sufficient or even a necessary factor
in progress. What is required to develop
a particular school is an agreed policy
or action, secure tenure of office among
the senior staff, and co-operation from
the parents and community. Such prim
eiples of action could be worked out
by the committee. with the man (or
woman) they appoint as principal, and
be would then be able to carry out his

interference possible under the Amen-
can system or the parental apathy or
resistance ltkriy under the

when good university professors attract
the bright young graduates.
This scheme would not overcome the
fundamental disadvantages of starting
a new school off without the facilities
expected in a longer-established insti-
tution, but it should at least provide a
staff prepared to cope as well as pos-
sible with this situation, and offer the
promise that such circumstances will be
overcome within the career of one
school generation. Furthermore, once
each school is conceived of as a co-
operative enterprise between a particu-
lar headmaster and his staff on the one
hand and a particular group of parents
on the other, the possibility arises of a
school developing its own individuality,
and so a real freedom of choice would
be given to parents who at present are
limited to choosing between church and
State schools, which differ only in the
abundance of their facilities.
Naturally, any change of this kind
bristles with difficulties, and it would
be unreasonable to expect it to be
introduced overnight. However, it is
surely not unreasonable to hope that
at least one State education department
should have the imagination to set up
a couple of experimental schools as a
pilot scheme to test these ideals. At
least they could not make the situation
worse than it is now, and they might be
able to take a few steps toward making
educational equality, based on the
recognition of differences between
communities as well as individuals, a
reality instead of a myth.

"Fascist!"


Tuesday’s Child...
By PETER SAMUEL
IF you happen to go into drear West
Block these days in Canberra and
call on a Treasury official you will
find his desk bare. It will not be because
he is one of these tidy people, and not
because he hasn’t enough work to do.
It is simply that he is careful about
what he leaves around at this time of
the year.
But in any case he is unlikely to have
anything very sensational in the De-
partmental Minute or Memorandum
papers in the safe. The forthcoming
Budget will most probably be a pretty
ordinary one. One thing is certain. It
will not be an Election Budget, even
though, there is an election this year.
The Government is so sure of its poll
prospects that it will not be going out
of its way to make itself popular. There
will be no sweetening of the Budget
pill.
The belief in Canberra is that pen-
sioners will get another five bob and
children will be made slightly more
valuable as income tax deductions. But
my guess is that this is about all that
the proverbial man-in-the-street can
expect. Mr. W. McMahon is not out to
establish a bright new image for the
figure of the Treasurer by dispensing
largesse. He just wants to do what will
in the longer term be regarded as a
good job.
B Y all accounts, Mr. McMahon is more
- expansionist and less conservative
in economic temperament than some
of his colleagues, more inclined to
say let things fly, let’s take the risks.
This would lead him to sanction
policies which took the economy to a
higher pitch of activity, running with
the smallest margin of unused resources
and not being overfearful of balance
of payments problems. It is said that in
Menzies cabinets he often spoke vigor-
ously in favor of a radical economic
line in opposition to the caution of
the then Treasurer Mr. Holt or his
powerful advisers from West Block. For
instance, it has been claimed that the
1965 Budget would have been some-
what more deflationary than it was
had it not been for McMahon’s
advocacy. He argued that the Budget
proposed by Mr. Holt and the Treasury
was unnecessarily dampening. He got
some concessions, but not as much as he
would have liked.
But it would be wrong to expect
Mr. McMahon’s first Budget to be
shaped entirely according to our pre-
conceptions of his past economic think-
ing. For a variety of reasons it may be
more cautious than we might expect.
It is easy to see the reasons which may
be advanced for a sit-pat stance. There
are more than the usual number of
uncertainties in our immediate economic
future and there are a fairly equally
balanced number of bull and bear
points. But to be more precise about
the context in which the Budget is
being framed and the prospects ahead
it is necessary to look at various aspects
of the economic scene in a little detail.
(All figures are adjusted to discount
purely seasonal factors.)
The best single indicator to look at
is unemployment, since it reflects the
extent to which the most important
resource is not being used. At the
close of the financial year on the 30th
June there were 57,000 people on the
books of the Commonwealth Employ-
ment Service looking for work in a
workforce estimated at 4,600,000
1.24 percent. It is fair to assume that
there are about as many people look-
ing for work of their own accord, so
the overall proportion is around 2.5
percent. This is right in the middle of
the range which the Vernon Committee
of Economic Enquiry specified as the
ideal. Above this level there is an un-
necessary waste with people willing and
able to work not being able to get
jobs. And below 2.5 percent there is
an undue degree of labor shortage and
consequent pressures on the cost and
price levels and on the balance of
payments.
Treasury officials are reluctant to
be pinned to any figure, but my im-
pression is that most of them would
go along with this 2.5 percent as the
ideal pitch of economic activity, about
the figure to which their policies are
generally geared. Some officials might
feel more comfortable with 3.0 to 3.5
percent, though these people are
definitely to the right of Mr. McMahon
on the economic ideology spectrum.
A confessed economic radical, my
personal preference would be for a
more radical unemployment target of
2.0 percent or below and I think in
this I would have most trade union
leaders and manufacturing executives
with me. For the first two-thirds of
1965 the economy managed with un-
employment down in the range 1.7 to
1.9 percent, and I guess that for union-
ists and factory bosses this was fine.
It is worth pointing out that for the
Government this represented too hot a
pace and therein lies one of the main
sources of dispute about what budgetary
policy should be. It is a dispute which
exists independently of differing assess-
ments of economic trends or arguments
about who should get what.
This means that the Government
will be aiming at engineering a financial
year in which the increase in the work-
force is just about taken up into employ-
ment, leaving unemployment and over-
time about the same as now. Manu-
facturers and other economic radicals
on the other hand would like to see
some slack taken up as well, so that
unemployment tends to decrease a little
and overtime working rise.
1. Government spending
What of the Government’s own bal-
ance sheet this year? Briefly the position
is as follows. It is already committed
through the Premiers Conference and
Loan Council meetings to paying out
$1463 million to the State Governments,
a little over sloom. more than last year.
Under the 1964 Act slsom. (slom.
extra) must be found for State roads, and
the Treasurer has already said that total
specific purpose capital grants for
rail standardisation, universities, beef
roads, and the like will rise by
s3om. to $265m., and current payments
will probably go up slom. to s9om.
So as far as the States are concerned
the Commonwealth is up for an extra
sl4om. (9.4 percent).
Cash social service benefits are the
next item in the Commonwealth Bud-
get. Together with a 50c a week rise
in pensions, these look like growing to
$ 1230 m., up s9om. Defence, last year
$750m., is scheduled under the Novem-
ber 1964 program to rise to $844m.,
but there is talk in Canberra of it
reaching the billion-dollar mark for
the first time. A more conservative
estimate is that it will be in the range
s9oom. to s9som.
Beyond this there are various smaller
bits and pieces of Government spending,
capital and current, which last year
summed to $2180m., and unless there is
extraordinary restraint they will grow
by their usual six percent to $2310m.
Totalling up all these items it looks
like a Budget of about $6.3 billion, an
increase of over ssoom. or 9 percent.
When you consider that the total value
of production of the motor industry is
about s3som. a year, the injection of
extra spending of over ssoom. is
obviously of immense importance.
OF.0 F . course, offsetting this expansionary
influence is the amount by which
tax revenues will rise. This is far more
hazardous to guess at, though it seems
reasonable to suppose that actual taxa-
tion rates will not rise significantly in
the Budget. The Treasurer will be rely-
ing mainly on the “natural” growth of
revenues as higher incomes, sales, and
company profits yield larger amounts of
taxation. The outcome depends very
largely on how the economy fares dur-
ing the year.
But assuming growth is just a little
better than in the past year revenue
would scarcely grow by more than
s4oom. This has to be set against the


McMahons
FIRST BUDGET
addition of at least ssoom. in Govern-
ment spending.
Obviously the foregoing arithmetic is
rough and speculative—and having com-
mitted myself to figures I await Mr.
McMahon’s speech on Tuesday with
some trepidation but it does suggest
very strongly that the Budget will be
an expansionary one, in the sense that
it will pump more new spending into
the economy than it will take out of
it.
The Government sector will be a
solid bull point in the coming year. But
there will be other divergent forces
operating and it is necessary to analyse
them one by one.
2. Consumer spending
Personal consumer spending is by far
the most important single item in the
health of the economy, since it provides
directly about two-thirds of the total
market for goods and services produced.
It also has obvious indirect effects on
other important forms of spending
on inventories held by manufacturers
and traders, and in the longer term on
capital spending on plant, equipment,
and buildings. Last financial year’s con-
sumption spending rose by only $600m.,
from $ll.B billion. Discounting for the
3.3 percent price rise, this amounts to
an increase of a mere 1.8 percent, a little
less than the population rise. The slack-
ness here, as much as the more spectacu-
lar falls in car sales and housing con-
struction, has been responsible for the
recent slowdown in the economy.
theory has it that consumer
spending will remain a constant
proportion of people’s after-tax incomes,
but in practice, looking at the statistics
quarter by quarter through the year, this
does not work. It is easy to see why.
Many people are able to ride out short-
term fluctuations in their income, par-
ticularly farmers, professional people,
and businessmen, and on the spending
side there is hire purchase which enables
people to buy gadgetry beyond their
immediate means. It does make sense,
however, to look at the relation between
wage and salary earners’ paypackets and
non-durable consumer spending, and
this reveals an interesting trend. In
1959 and 1960 the relation was steady
between 91.5 and 92.5 percent, rising
during the 1961-1962 recession to 93.0
percent as people understandably drew
on savings, or ran up bills. But from
the beginning of 1963 onwards there
has been a continuing steady fall, with
the figure now down to a shade below
90 percent.
No one seems sure of the reason
for this steady slide, though it is
obviously of great importance to assess-
ments of future trends. Some people
in the Treasury think it is accounted
for by a rising burden of what they
call “contractual commitments” • re-
Federal Treasurer McMahon: aiming to do a good job on his first Budget?
payments on hire-purchase or housing
loans, superannuation payments, life-
assurance policies and the like. But
statistics on these things are scrappy
and so the theory is not put forward
with any conviction. If it is correct it
would suggest there may be a hope of
an increase in consumer spending as
the growth of commitments deceler-
ates, following last year’s slumps in
housing and new HP agreements. The
slide could also be explained by the
recent “younging” of the workforce
and the influx of housewives. It could
simply reflect greater thriftiness.
The simple fact is that there have not
been the surveys or the statistics col-
lected to explain past and present
trends. And unlike a number of other
countries we do not have regular sur-
veys of consumer-spending intentions,
and therefore our estimates have to be
very rough indeed. I get the impression
from Treasury people that they expect
consumer spending this financial year
to be up just a little. The figure of an
extra sloom. (over last year’s s6oom.
increase) is suggested as likely to result
from the big basic wage rise of this
year. Farmers’ prosperity is bound to
improve and so they should push things
along a bit more, and there is the com-
pletely unpredictable margins judg-
ment to come.
All this adds up to only a slight im-
provement in general business for those
who service consumer needs. But their
prosperity will also depend heavily on
the next important item of spending.
3. Stocks
At any time there are usually about
$3 billion worth of stocks of raw
materials, semi-processed and finished
goods in the hands of manufacturers,
wholesalers and retailers. Any addition
to or diminishment of this huge volume
of goods in the economic pipeline is
obviously of great importance to how
industry fares. From the middle of
1964 to the end of last year no less
than s7som. more went into.the pipe-
line than came out, and so much of
the prosperity of that period was built
on stock accumulation. The value of
manufacturing and commercial stocks
rose by 35 percent in eighteen months.
Now it is possible that 15 and per-
haps even 20 percent growth was war-
ranted by the expansion of the economy
and by rising prices, but that leaves a
very solid s3som. of stocks which have
been built up in excess of requirements.
These have to be run down.
It is not quite clear yet what has
been happening so far this year. The
March quarter showed a small rundown
—of the order of s3om. —but a large
proportion of this was in the motor
industry. And this industry has evidently
done so much worse than it expected
in the latest quarter (for which
figures are not yet available) that it

margarine
WSiMlliF
If Mrs. Jones wants
margarine made only from
Australian raw materials...
the Quota System
has no right
to deny her
In 1960 the Dairy Industry Committee of Enquiry acknow-
ledged that Mrs. Jones had the right to buy, without res-
triction, margarine made from Australian raw material.
This is how they put it:
*“The industry acknowledged that if margarine were a
wholly Australian product it would have no grounds for op-
posing the lifting of restrictions.”
But now that Australia can grow the vegetable oils needed
to produce a wholly Australian table margarine the same
Dairy Industry is fighting to keep the quota restrictions.
Earlier in the same year the President of the Australian
Dairy Farmers’ Federation in giving evidence before the
same Committee of Enquiry stated:
**“From a dairy farmer's point of view the manufacture
of a substitute for any dairy product should be banned
unless it is made entirely from Australian primary prod-
ucts and manufactured under Australian conditions, or
recommended on medical advice for special diets as may
be the case for some 'filled milks'.”
Here again we see a spokesman for the Dairy Industry
acknowledging the right of one primary industry to live
freely with another.
For over 17 years the Queensland Dairy Act which carried
the restrictions against free manufacture of margarine in-
eluded in its definition section on table margarine, the
following statement:
“Any margarine prepared or manufactured wholly or in
part from any fats or oils mentioned in the definition of
the term margarine which, or the products containing
which, have been imported into Australia; the term does
not include any margarine prepared or manufactured
wholly from fats or oils, which have been derived from a
source within Australia.”
In the new Act passed in 1958 this clause is missing. Now,
when we have a vigorous edible oil seeds industry to create
the raw material needed for .wholly Australian production
of margarine, the clause is missing!
The men who plant Safflower, Cotton and Peanuts and
the men who can use these raw materials to make mar-
garine are not .asking for special considerations, they ask
only that the sentiments expressed so emphatically in
1960 be re-affirmed —and that State Legislation once more
include the missing clause, so they can get on with the job
of creating a new, vital and dynamic primary industry.

ment to “de-stocking” has yet to be
made, and so this constitutes a major
bear point for the future.
4. Business capital expenditure
This item which in 1964 was running
at a little over $2 billion, has recently
been at the $3 hfillion level, and with
sales sluggish it seems impossible to
expect businessmen to keep on adding
to their capacity at this high rate. The
Treasury certainly does not, as it in-
dicated in its June survey of the
economy, and no doubt the possibility
of a fall here figured prominently in
budget discussions.
I T is, interestingly, here rather than at
the balance of payments that the
Government is feeling most concern
with the British Government’s restric-
tions on foreign investment. For at least
a year ahead there is no anxiety about
the level of our foreign reserves.
Exports and imports are now healthily
back in balance, and as long as we get
normal winter and spring rains there
will be a strong upsurge in farm pro-
duction and a surplus on our trading.
The smaller capital inflow will not
really matter.
But the effect on local office building
and factory expansion may be worri-
some.
5. Housing
This has come reasonably well out
of the mini-recession of late last year,
and can expect to get further smallish
boosts. The level of housing activity is
controlled mainly through banking
policy, and this can be left to month
by month variations. The Budget will
not hold much importance for this
sector.
To sum up then, without govern-
mental stimulus, the economy looks like
slowing down further in the year ahead,
with unemployment continuing to rise
and utilisation of factory plant declin-
ing. Mr. McMahon, the Treasurer, is
well aware of these possibilities.
Evidently, too, he has expressed the
hunch that there may be more in
economic trends than presently available
cold statistics show. He is more of an
expansionist than other people around
him in the Government, and so there is
a good chance that he may come up
with a Budget which tackles the pro-
spective problems w'hich have been out-
lined here.
It is possible though that he has
underestimated the strength of reces-
sional forces.
Only now are many businesses begin-
ning to realise the full effect which the
past 18 months’ stagnation in spending
has had on their profitability, and only
now are they finding they do not really
need extra plant capacity or office
space. So, instead of a levelling off in
capital expenditures, there could well
be a sharp fall, unless the Budget pro-
mises a resumption of general growth.
In that case quick extra stimulation
will be needed. Under the new Treasurer
we are more likely to get this.

The Rating Game
Dizzy blondes and a fish
By SAM LIPSKI
JUST ten years after the introduction
of television to Australia an Aus-
tralian program, Homicide, has
demonstrated again what has always
been true —that TV is a mass medium,
that there is no necessary relation be-
tween the quality of a program on tele-
vision and its mass appeal, and that for
an Australian program to succeed on
commercial television it must win the
ratings. The success of Homicide is
welcome not because it is a good
production I think it is only barely
average —but because it is getting into
the Top Ten programs consistently.
For instance the latest Anderson TV
Ratings for Sydney listed the follow-
ing programs in the Top Ten: I
Love Lucy, Perry Mason, The Dick
Van Dyke Show, Sound of Music,
Homicide, TCN 9 News (Tuesday
night), Bandstand, The Man From
UNCLE, Adults Only Movie, and
Flipper.
In Melbourne the latest McNair
Survey listed the Top Ten programs as
follows: Homicide, Steptoe and Son,
Movie, Movie, Bob Hope Show, The
Saint, Coronation Street, The Beverly
Hillbillies, Peyton Place, Movie.
But a mere listing of the Top Ten
programs is not a complete guide to
their real popularity. Flipper may be
tenth on the ratings list with a 31,
but it has a larger audience than I
Love Lucy with a rating of 38. Be-
cause it is a program with wide chil-
dren’s appeal on a Sunday evening it
has an audience of 600,000 compared
with 540,000 for Lucy. It may be dis-
concerting to have to admit that a
dizzy middle-aged blonde, a fish, and
slow-speaking Melbourne policemen
can command the largest TV audiences,
but that is what the ratings tell us, and
when it comes to counting heads
there is no other way available.
If Homicide is the precursor of
more Australian-produced series it will
be because of the ratings. Thus ten
years after the first TV programs went
on the air the übiquitous ratings are
still important determinants of the kind
of television available.
Why the need for ratings? A com-
mercial television station, runs the
familiar litany, has nothing to sell an
advertiser except the size of its audi-
ence. Some measure of audience size
is obviously indispensable to both
advertisers and stations —hence the
ratings. As one station executive put it:
“Ratings are the circulation figures, the
box office receipts, the gate returns of
the industry. We couldn’t function with-
out them.”
What is a rating and where does it
come from? In Australia it comes from
two organisations based in Sydney, The
Anderson Analysis Pty. Ltd. and
McNair Surveys Pty. Ltd. Of the two
companies, Anderson have much the
larger clientele among television
stations and advertising agencies,
who form the bulk of rating service sub-
scribers. This has been largely due to
the greater frequency of Anderson sur-
veys in the big centres. In Sydney and
Melbourne Anderson are now carrying
out surveys over 39 weeks in a 44-
week period from February to Nov-
ember. In Brisbane, Newcastle, Ade-
laide, and Perth the frequency is less.
Anderson use the “Diary-Personal
Interview” method to get the infor-
mation which provides the basis for the
ratings. After selecting a sample of
about 500 TV households, a team of
part-time female interviewers, usually
in the 30-50 age group, is sent to ex-
plain the survey to selected families.
In practice this usually means that the
housewife gets a diary which she is
asked to place on the television set and
to fill in every time the set is switched
on or the channel is changed. The
diary is divided into quarter-hour seg-
ments and diary holders are asked to
fill in every segment giving the channel
being watched, the number of the
people viewing, their age and sex. The
interviewers return after two or three
days to make sure that the diary is
being kept correctly. Anderson claim
that 87 percent of the households
approached return usable diaries. Those
who show discrepancies between what
they have entered in the diary and what
they tell the interviewer are not counted
in the final results.
300 TV Homes
UNTIL July of this year McNair used
the recall method, sending inter-
viewers to selected households as a
sample to ask what was viewed the
night before. In practice this again
usually meant interviewing the house-
wife and checking her replies. In this
method a different sample was used
each day. Now McNair have changed
to a diary method using the same people
over a two-week period as Anderson
do. Although similar to Anderson now
in many ways, the new McNair method
differs in some important respects.
McNair are using a sample of 300
TV homes, all of which have phones,
so that interviewers can check every few
days on whether the diary is being kept
correctly, and also ask about viewing
information for an advance-ratings ser-
vice which McNair claim will give their
clients ratings on programs as soon as
four days after the program goes on
the air. At present it can sometimes
be weeks before ratings are known. The
diary also differs from the Anderson

possible bias. Recognising this, McNair
have gone to some lengths in their
sales information to defend their
choice. McNair admit that only 66 per-
cent of TV homes in Melbourne and
only 56 percent in Sydney have tele-
phones, but they claim that if selected
correctly among all grades of homes
there is not likely to be any effect on
TV-audience results.
The aim of the new method is the
same as the old and the same as Ander-
son —to tell clients how many people
were viewing for each quarter of an
hour that the stations were on the air,
what the viewers’ age distribution was,
and how many males and females were
watching.
How accurate and reliable are the
ratings? It is often forgotten that the
rating organisations themselves never
claim absolute accuracy. Every rating
survey includes the degree of statistical
error involved. Thus when Anderson say
that a program has a rating of 25 they
mean that 25 percent of the TV house-
holds (in Sydney 25 percent of 625,000)
have sets tuned to the program. When
translated into the number of people
viewing, this figure will vary according
to such things as whether the program
is an adult or children’s one. But assum-
ing .that a rating of 25 was translated
into an audience of 500,000, what
Anderson would really be saying is that
there are two chances in three that
their estimate is within 25,000 of the
true value, i.e., the audience is some-
where between 475,000 and 525,000.
Or, put another way, they are really
saying that there are nine chances in
ten that their estimate is within 40,000
of the real value, i.e., the audience is
somewhere between 460,000 and
540,000.
The Doubters
even with this admission of prob-
able error, the ratings find them-
selves under criticism. Some of it
comes from people- who have not both-
ered to investigate the differences be-
tween Australian and American systems,
and vaguely recalling that ratings were
investigated in the United States they
conclude that there must be something
wrong with them here. There are
others who cannot accept that 250 or
300 or 500 households can be used to
draw conclusions about 625,000 house-
holds. For this kind of doubter
one can only point out that mathe-
matical statistics is widely used
and accepted as an “exact” science.
There is a third kind of doubter, and he
can be found among some advertising
agencies, even among some of the
stations, and certainly among statistic-
ians and social scientists, who accepts
the logical assumptions of statistics but
says that these are predicated on careful
sampling techniques and methods of
obtaining data which the local rating
organisations cannot afford to use.
The managing director of Anderson,
Mr. K. R. Sievers, rejects these critic-
isms and says that the question of re-
liability is no longer a relevant one for
his firm because it has been settled.
“Ten years ago we had to face up to
this question. But not any more today.
We have been audited by the industry,
and our sampling, methodology and
analysis are reliable. While this might
loom large in some people’s mind, in
reality it is a very minor issue. It is
not what we say but what has been
established by audit. Our methods
would pass in any statistical court.”
Mr. Sievers was referring to a recent
independent assessment of the reliability
of the Anderson system undertaken by
Professor Meadows of the Department
of Psychology at the University of
New South Wales. In a report com-
missioned by the Federation of Aus-
tralian Commercial Television Stations,
Professor Meadows concluded that in
the survey which he inspected the people
associated with it had done their work
“faithfully and well.” He noted some
“minor, but not material” discrepancies
in some of the diaries, but overalL his
audit was very favorable.
This was the first time in ten years
that any independent assessment of
either of the two firms had been under-
taken. Professor Meadows has discussed
the new McNair Survey with the
McNair management but no full in-
spection has yet been undertaken.
One way to get an idea of the sig-
nificance of ratings is to see how they
have affected a new channel like Syd-
ney’s Channel 10. During the hearings
for the third commercial TV licence
in Sydney a large number of groups
and individuals gave evidence which
suggested that they were deeply dis-
satisfied with the programming of the
existing commercial channels and that
the people of Sydney would welcome a
fresh new approach. This evidence
weighed deeply with the Channel 10
management and the station went on
the air determined to woo the middle-
of-the-road viewer. Unfortunately that
determination did not survive the first
two surveys. After the first two sets of
ratings showed that the “fresh approach”
was getting nowhere the station switched
to the same sort of programming as its
commercial competitors.
Channel 10 probably contributed to
its own disillusionment by program-
ming in a way which puzzled the in-
dustry even if it was going for the
middle-of-therroad viewer there are
doubts whether it went about it in the
right way.
Yet, Channel 10’s experience does
not mean that ratings are always used
to kill good programs. Sometimes they
kill bad ones, and deservedly so. But
the most successful stations are usually
those who have used the ratings as
tools and not as a crutch.
The advertising industry generally
regards the ratings as an acceptable
guide to the size of TV audiences, but
the initiative for programming origin-
ates within the stations rather than the
agencies. The tendency today is for

agencies to buy “spots” throughout
the night rather than sponsorship of a
particular program, and so stations are
anxious to keep their ratings at their
highest in prime viewing time between
7 and 10 p.m. when advertising rates
are greatest.
While the advertising agencies accept
the ratings for what they are, they are
not necessarily satisfied that things
should remain as they are. One media
executive summed it up this way:
“Generally, agencies feel that we are
not provided with enough qualitative
information. We do not know enough
about the kind of people we are reach-
ing—their age, sex, income, size of
family, buying habits, product usage,
etc. This tends to make TV buying
somewhat hit and miss; like firing a
shotgun rather than a fine rifle. This is
one of the unfortunate things about out-
industry, because it tends to take sup-
port away from a program which might
enhance the medium and which might
actually deliver an audience better
suited to a particular product’s specific
need. Consider the difference between
programs such as Homicide with its
vast audience and Project ’66 with a
much smaller but probably better edu-
cated, more affluent audience.”
It would be over-optimistic to expect
that the argument of a “quality” over
a “quantity” audience would carry very
much weight with the majority of adver-
tisers who use television. But if there is
to be a development which will lessen
the dependence on ratings it will come
in the area of research into the kind of
audiences watching television and more
particularly their reaction to commer-
cial messages. For the time being, how-
ever, the ratings remain the “currency”
of commercial television.
All this leads to the obvious con-
elusion that with rare exceptions com-
mercial channels cannot be expected to
program for minority audiences, whether
i n the fields of drama, public affairs,
the arts, or education. What then of the
ABC’s attitude to ratings? How seri-
ously are they taken by ABC planners?
Sad to say the ABC is currently the
victim of programming schizophrenia,
Quite clearly it is going for ratings with
some programs like The Dean Martin
Show, The Danny Kaye Show, more
films, and other popular programs. Yet
it has to satisfy the “minorities” at the
same time, which prevents it from going
all the way with ratings. In the words
of one of its senior executives “it is
trying to satisfy all of the people at
least some of the time, whereas the
commercial channels are trying to
satisfy most of the people most of the
time.” The ABC makes use of ratings
but does not depend on them,
This leaves an unsatisfied “minority”
who want the sort of television where
ratings do not matter at all. If the
reaction of the Postmaster-General to
recommendations for an educational TV
network are any indication, then the
minority will remain unsatisfied.
Lullaby Lads and Lasses
The Australian Dissenters of 1966
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
YOU ask: what are they dissenting
from? But first you should know
who they are.
Some are simple “Utopians,” genteel
liberals who feel that somewhere over
the rainbow or even the Iron Curtain
lies a secular paradise; or, at least, the
possibility of the land that they’ve
dreamed of once in a lullaby; or they
are middlecclass boys and girls pro-
jecting their revolt against their parents
into the dimension of politics, less in-
terested in politics than their own late-
adolescent emancipation; or they are
Christian or other kinds of humani-
tarians with a deep concern for econ-
omic and or social reform.
Some are aggressive working class
or lower middle class lads with an in-
herited hatred of capitalism, a concern
for social justice, and a strong will to
storm the commanding heights occupied,
so they believe, by the Australian
Establishment
Others are not much more than
mindless drop-outs with the scent of
nihilism in their nostrils, attracted by
what they imagine is the libertarianism
of the Left.
Still others are simple leftist
ideologues parading their substitute
religious creed and values; a few are
basically aesthetic revolutionaries with
a violent distaste for Admass, Popcult,
Hollywood, and Madison Avenue; a
more timorous petition signers
“d magazine readers scared into con-
f°"™ty by loud-mouthed leftists of
ca "’P us and the . or ?> Professions;
and others are just the tired old rump
°* the Stalinist ett.
They do not like President Johnson
(both for policy and “style”), Dr. Knop-
felmacher, Harold Wilson (who has
“sold out”), “Time,” anti-Communism
(which is always “negative”), B. A.
Santamaria, Western military defence
almost anything, and Coca-Cola,

seen in different ways in “The Aus-
tralian Left Review” (formerly the
“Communist Review”), “Nation,” and
“Labor Comment.” Some support politi-
cal and military revolutionaries, others
are pragmatic reformers, but they are
all “dissenters.” From what?
“Dissent,” circulation 5000 quarterly,
first produced in 1961, which is the
most competently edited, the most in-
telligent, and the least compulsively
leftist, should provide some clues.
One of the first two editors was a
Catholic, the other an English agnostic.
The present editor is Jewish and also
an academic. In the spring 1965 issue
of “Dissent” he asks what the content
of radicalism must be today: “A vision
of society qualitatively better than the
one in which we live. It is a utopian
and idealistic vision of decency and
community and equality.” What does
this mean concretely? “Thete is much
to be done in areas like corporate
wealth, poverty, housing and town plan-
ning, workers’ participation in man-
agement, advertising, economic ration-
alisation, individual freedom in public
and private bureaucracies, foreign aid,
support for the arts . . .”
The DLP would go along with all
of the above, so would quite a number
of the younger generation Liberals.
So this does not get us very far. A
better clue may be the dissenters’
attitudes to Communist China. Curiously
enough, whilst there is something of an
open season on some of the more
obvious failures and brutalities of the
Soviet Union, the magazines of Marx-
ism, Socialism, and Dissent are almost
reverent in their treatment of Com-
munist China, where the ruling caste is
positively and purposefully more ruth-
less, repressive, and intolerant. More
curiously, these magazines are heavily
scornful, even resentful, of the Peking-
oriented Communist faction in Aus-
tralia. Mao may be Allah, but Ted
Hill, his appointed prophet, remains
without honor.
China
jy/JORE important is the misty film
of sentiment which spreads from
“Australian Left Review” to even the
staples of ’’Dissent” whenever the poli-
cies of Red China are raised in public
debate. First some samples of evidence.
• “The Chinese support disarma-
ment, but they do not believe the Im-
perialists will ever disarm” (Arena 64).
• “The Chinese revolution was not
only the birth of a new China, it was
also a great rebirth” (Arena ’64).
• “Edgar Snow interviewed Mao Tse-
tung in February of this year, a short
time before U.S. planes carried out
their raid on North Vietnam. The
aging, but not senile, Chinese leader
took a benign and philosophic view of
the world” (Outlook, ’65).
• “Regarding the Chinese absorption of
Tibet, he (Dr. J. F. Cairns) points out
that when Chiang ruled China, no-
body disputed Chinese claims to Tibet”
(Melbourne Partisan, ’65).
• “Mr. Hasluck is to be commended
for his statement that the establishment
of peaceful relations between China and
her neighbors should represent a key
aspect of Australian foreign policy.
However, it is difficult to reconcile the
Minister’s continued vilification of China
with the pursuit of this worthwhile
objective” (Dissent, ’66).
The above quotations, taken out of
context, do not fully picture the atti-
tudes of their authors or the magazines
in which they appear, and one or two
were in articles which provoked replies:
however, they are symptomatic of a
weakness in the whole of the radical
and dissenting Press. The dissenters
cannot face the problems of modern
totalitarianism in China for a com-
bination of the following reasons:
An understandable feeling of guilt at
Western economic depredations in
China since the great age of European
imperialism; strong feelings of remorse
against Western racism, past and present
(Chinese manifestations of racial sup-
eriority are ignored or treated as a
joke after all, who could take a
Chinese claim of racial aristocracy
seriously?); loss of political will when
confronted by the huge economic and
political problems of Asia, Africa, and
the rest of the underdeveloped world;
the pious hope that Communism may-
be the solution to the economic prob-
lems of some of the continents or their
countries; the quiet hope that Socialism,
even in an extreme form, will work
properly somewhere; a liberal inability
to take ideology seriously as a com-
prehensive political and motive force
of China’s ruling apparatus.
The inability of the Left fipart from
present and former Communist oper-
ators to understand the Chinese regime,
its aims, actions, and ideology, indicates
a serious deficiency in their intellectual
and emotional equipment and destroys
much of the credibility of their claims
to be “radical,” “independent,” and
culturally significant. This deficiency is
also displayed by their response to the
war in Vietnam.
Compare the posturings, evasions,
and culpable betrayals of the Australian
dissenters with the position taken by
Irving Howe, editor of the American
Socialist “Dissent”:
When Professor Staughton Lynd
asked recently in the “New York Review
of Books,” “May I inquire why it is
immoral to desire a Viet Cong vic-
tory?” Howe replied: “Because, Mr.
L' d, a victory for a Communist or
Communist - dominated movement
means another totalitarian dictatorship
suppressing human freedom.”
Back in sunny Australia, the Left
has different notions: “Outlook” says:
“The Vietnamese war has revealed to
the rest of the world the senseless and
power-crazed barbarism of which the
United States military planners are cap-
able when confronted by a virtually
defenceless peasant people. It has also
finally dissipated the smoke-screen
of hypocrisy, double-talk, and lies be-
hind which the American power ite
have elaborated their program of global
domination.”
A writer in “Comment” says: “I
also know that if I were in South Viet-
nam, while I might not be a member
of the Communist party, I would almost
certainly be a member of the National
Liberation Front,” and “Arena” says:
“The struggle for markets and the
capturing of markets has become even
more acute under the impact of mass-
production techniques, leading to
political interference and aggressive
military action against national liber-
ation fronts everywhere.”
“Dissent” demurs: “The rationale for
continued involvement and prolonga-
tion of the war decreases every day.
Apart from bashing the Viet Cong and
mindlessly bombing North Vietnam
there appears to be no policy.”
Arrogance
'J'HE wilful misunderstanding of
frequently repeated American objec-
tives in Vietnam, the mindless accep-
tance of Communist propaganda, the
refusal to look at the multiple evidence
of the ambitions and methods of the
Indo-Chinese Communist Party, and a
totality of half-suggestions which all
point to capitulation to the pressure of
totalitarian terror, all demonstrate a
radical collapse at the centre of the
Australian Left: A collapse of both
political imagination and will; a failure
to radically respond to the great chal-
lenges of modern totalitarianism.
Confronted by this moral and intel-
lectual disgrace one could be forgiven
for replying who cares? The Australian
Left, whether pro-Communist, Fabian,
or social reformist (it is surprising how
many of the same names keep appear-
ing in the whole spread of the maga-
zines), claims to inherit a tradition of
radical, moral and political virtue: it is
an arrogant claim.
Yet it is not altogether untrue: on
domestic issues they often raise, even
discover, important problems and dis-
cuss them with intelligence and
authority: in education, migration, social
welfare and security, cultural barbar-
isms, economic injustices, foreign aid,
to name only some. Since the days of
the French Revolution, when the Radi-
cals sat on the left of the President’s
chair in the Legislative chamber, and
the Conservatives on the right, the his-
tory of the Left is not without sub-
stantial claims to honor.
But the Australian heroes of this
tradition now seem tired. Their maga-
zines come and go, but their basic politi-
cal influence in the country has never
been smaller, and the only party which
might receive their suggestions has never
been further from office. Their publica-
tions now have the flavor of house or
club magazines. Until they learn to
honestly face the challenges of modern
totalitarianism the dissenters and their
writings will become more and more
irrelevant: political zealots, with highly
domesticated guts and imagination, who,
in the words of Adlai Stevenson, have
to be dragged kicking and screaming
into the twentieth century.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Under the influence
“MY NAME’S McGOOLEY, WHAT’S
YOURS?” the new television series
made by Channel 7, Sydney, and star-
ring Gordon Chater, will have its first
showing this month in all capital cities
and several country centres. The first
episode is called “The Vacation.”
Of course, back in the days before
we came so much under the influence
of America, through constant exposure
to their films and television programs,
it would have been called “The Holi-
day.”
For Art's Soke
A FAIR IDEA of what art might be
like if artists didn’t have to make
money, didn’t read what critics write,
or listen to what other artists say comes
from the exhibition by boys of Gran-
ville Boys’ High School, Sydney, cur-
rently at the Clune Galleries.
Granville is an old, fairly ugly suburb
on the Main Western Line near Parra-
matta. It is unlikely that there are many
Friends or Lymburners on the walls out
there, much less Olsens on the ceiling.
Last week while the high-school boys
were preparing their exhibition there
was a tragic, pointless outbreak of gang
warfare at Granville in which one boy
was shot dead and another wounded,
but it would be far-fetched to draw any
sociological lessons from the contrast in
activities or make any optimistic pre-
dictions for the future.
The exhibition (a similar one from
this school was held at the Clune
Galleries last year) is also a striking,
and to some, perhaps, an alarming
answer to that perennial question from
parents: What is the Wyndham Plan all
about?
The paintings, sculptures, and
assemblages have been done by boys
in the senior school. Style is catholic
but with a leaning toward geometric
forms and assemblages which require
electrical wiring or other ingenious con-
struction work. One moulded figure
of extremely perceptive wickedness
a fat lady enthroned on a chair
is the work of boys of 13 and 14. All
the exhibits are done within the school
art syllabus, although many of the boys
spend a fair amount of their own spare
time on them.
Although Granville Boys’ High has
gained a reputation in New South Wales
for art, the art teachers at the school
feel that at this stage of the Wyndham
Plan other schools in New South Wales
could mount similar exhibitions. Where
Granville gained a small start is that
it was originally one of that slightly
underprivileged class, the Junior Tech,
but it did teach art. Now 800 out of
the 1000 boys at the school learn art,
and there are four art teachers, more
than at any boys’ school in the State,
although some girls’ schools have as
many.
What comes out of all this? Not
professional painters, if the school’s
art teachers have their way. “We hope
we encourage an adventurous attitude,”
one of them, Ken Reinhard, said. “And
we hope that later the boys will retain
some interest in creativity.” “Even if
when they get married they take an
interest in what their homes look like
instead of leaving it to their wives it
will be something,” another teacher,
John Seivl, added.
Most of the exhibition are the
students’ “major work” for examination
and so are not for sale. “Once you put
a price on one, then most of the boys
would tend to paint in that way, feel-
ing that that style has a value while
their own has not,” Reinhard said. “As
it is, each boy works in the style which
seems right to him and that is the way
it should be.”
Freeway or Freedom
DAVID BRAND was a country store-
keeper before he went into politics and
became Western Australia’s Liberal
Premier. His ability to keep his of-
the-people charm has been a big factor
in his Government’s success, particularly
in balancing the big-business, big-State
image projected by his right-hand man,
Charles Court.
But Brand may be losing his special
touch and an imminent testing-ground
could be when the Government makes
its decision on the Old Barracks arch-
way. The archway now stands feebly
in the midst of demolition for a new
freeway system. To the Government
it is an eyesore, retention of which has
been campaigned for vigorously by
radical heritage-lovers at the expense
of a magnificent view of newly reno-
vated Parliament House.
To most people it doesn’t matter
much, except as a symbol, not of West-
ern heritage, as the vocal minority
would say, but of Government power.
This power has been used ruthlessly
against the City of Perth’s only real
natural asset, the Swan River, and most
people feel the archway is a good place
to draw the line. In fact, it’s far too
late. The old archway would look for-
lorn and ridiculous, in the middle of a
bitumen maze. But if it does go, the
clear view of Parliament House will
become a reminder of who it was who
knocked it down.
Lady at a Loom
THE NEW QANTAS HOTEL in Syd-
ney, which may or may not in our life-
time get its proper name the Went-
worth for everyday purposes, seems
behind its scaffolding to be a building
of quite staggering ugliness, even by
current Sydney standards. However,
the hotel when it is opened in Novem-
ber may have some elements of charm.
Included among these would be the
banners, one for each State of the Com-
monwealth, which will be used in the
reception rooms. The heraldic designs
are the work of artist Harry William-
son, but the banners are being woven
by Margaret Grafton, of East Sydney.
Lesser weavers who manage an
occasional scarf might look with awe
at Miss Grafton, completely dwarfed
by her loom. She fills a large room,
once the “best” room of the old Pres-
byterian rectory in Palmer Street, with
her looms and threads. The Church
authorities allowed her to work in the
then deserted rectory when she was
producing a huge Biblical tapestry, now
in the G. B. Alexander College, near
Maitland, N.S.W.
Although Miss Grafton is following
a design for the banners she prefers to
weave as other artists paint, working
freely with color. Months, sometimes
years, go into a large tapestry.

seems a fine bit of banner-carrying by

east as “exciting as a trip abroad.’*
It was wonderful, he said, to soak
up theatrical atmosphere. This was at
a stage when the company had pre-
sented its “Altona” in only Brisbane
and Canberra and had just reached
Sydney. Mr. Metcalfe’s enthusiasm for
the limited delights of Canberra and
Brisbane make it vividly clear what it
is like to work in a professional theatre
in Perth, providing theatrical atmos-
phere for Perth but rarely seeing any
theatre yourself.
This is, of course, the greatest limi-
tation about working for the Perth
Playhouse (as the National Theatre
generally is still known). But there
are advantages, Mr. Metcalfe is
quick to point out. The company pre-
sents a wider variety of plays than
companies in larger cities often can.
It recently did “Richard II” for mati-
nees and “Dear Delinquent” for even-
ing performances. His players, Mr.
Metcalfe feels, get varied experience.
“So many actors finish their training
knowing how to recite verse and fence,
but they have no idea of how to feed
a comedy line,” he said.
Playhouse, which does 12 to 14
plays a year for an average
season in a theatre seating 720, has
six players under contract, whereas,
for example, Sydney’s Old Tote has
none. “The players do work in
ensemble,” Mr. Metcalfe said. “You
can mould your production around
them. The danger is, of course, becom-
ing so friendly that it is difficult to
be critical.” The Playhouse is absolved
from the disadvantage of players .miss-
ing rehearsals or arriving exhausted
for performances because they are busy
with television or radio. There is no
television and little radio in Perth.
But Perth’s isolation is the reason
why Mr. Metcalfe next year must with
reluctance leave the Playhouse. He will
return to his native England for a time,
then hopes to come back to the eastern
States of Australia. “I haven’t seen
any theatre for four years,” he said.
“For a director it’s madness. But I
have become much more wrapped up
in the Playhouse than I ever thought I
could be.”
Mr. Metcalfe’s concern for the Play-
house’s future means that he would
like to see it get more money, even a
little more, so that the permanent com-
pany could be bigger and the bank bal-
ance healthier. “We have just finished
our most successful production in the
theatre’s 10 years’ history,” he said. “It
was ‘Fings Ain’t What They Used to
Be’ someone is missing a fortune
not doing it here and all we achieved
is that our overdraft is now where it
should be and not way over.”

AROUND MELBOURNE
Conquering the impossible cowlick
THE sad truth is that the noble
word “bar” has been shock-
ingly profaned. In the great
days of Melbourne we averaged at
least 20 bars to the block. Splendid
little hostelries, they were, with
cheap beer and free counter lunches.
We still have 20 bars to the block,
but practically none of them are
hostelries. The pubs couldn’t stand
the high rates. Instead we have
record bars, lingerie bars, doughnut
bars, crunchie bars, and I regret to
say an “uplift bar.” The latest ad-
dition to the bar trade is the “male
toiletry bar.” Just as an aside, at
this point could I ask a question?
Do the young ladies who work at.
male toiletry bars call themselves
male toiletry barmaids?
We talk of male toiletries because
rugged Melbourne is still not ready
for the name “male cosmetics,” just
as we are not ready for the term
“male perfume.” You must appreci-
ate always we refer to grooming aids
as male “fragrances.” The truth is
that the male toiletry trade is very-
big business in the U.S., and now
half a dozen cosmetic firms are
hoping to do the same here. In the
U.S., 60 million men make them-
selves fragrant with some kind of
fragrance, and according to the
Lauder’s people four out of five use
some kind of after-shave lotion and
“the sixth occasionally drinks it.”
The correspondent is a great
authority on this subject, and for
some time he has been collecting
male toiletry advertisements. To
overcome the terrible fear that there
might be something queer in all
this, the word has gone out to copy-
writers to stress the husky, tough,
male image and male conquest of
the female. So at our bars you see
male cologne in whisky-type bottles,
in decanters, in basket-weave kegs
that quite clearly have been salvaged
from pirate schooners, there’s a
cologne which is labelled “Moon-
shine X” and comes in “genuine
crockery jug . . . whimsical, habit-
forming.”
Another comes in a shotgun cart-
ridge case and has the slogan “for
men of high calibre.” However, my
favorite selections of copywriting
have been taken from “Esquire.”
This one is for “Pub cologne for
men” . . . “The lusty life is back
and it starts at the sign of the pub.
Uncork a flask of Pub cologne. If
you hear tankards clash and songs
turn bawdy, if the torches flare and
the innkeeper locks up his daughter
for the night . . . it’s because you’ve
been into the Pub and unloosed the
lusty life.” Another goes, “Inferno
brings out the devil in a man.”
The best of them all is more
subtle. It shows a blonde, more
gorgeous than Josephine, stretched
out on a chaise - longue looking
languid, dreamy her eyes closed.
Cast on the floor is a pair of
Napoleonic boots and cap. The cap-
tion reads: “Was Napoleon’s favorite
cologne responsible for this con-
quest? It’s no secret. Napoleon used
a litre a day. Napoleon liked its
cheeriness . . . that cool, crisp, spicy
fragrance.” The ad did not mention
that considering Napoleon’s bathing
habits he may have needed some-
thing cheery, cool, and crisp.
The toiletry bars are well scat-
tered around town. For example, at
Myers you will discover that all the
big names are now in the male
toiletry business, Elizabeth Arden,
Chanel, Guerlain. They have zesty
virile fragrances like Russian
Leather, English Leather, Sandal-
wood, Pine, Cedar Wood, fresh
fragrances of the hayfield, and, of
course, Citrus is the “in” odor for
this year.
One of the most costly lines is
Jade East from the U.S. Always it is
advertised with a Chinese girl who
looks more feline than Suzy Wong
with the line: “It’s something about
you that excites her. Perhaps it is
the Jade East you use.” You can pay
$l5 for Jade East cologne, which
comes in a package the shape of a
jade Buddha. You may be com-
"...and we call this ‘perspiration’
the boss will think you’re
working!”
forted to know that it is also pos-
sible to get junior-size Buddhas for
$5.
The variety, of course, is remark-
able. There is a male bubble bath
from Italy which smells divinely of
crushed lemons. The blurb reads:
“After a bath or shower you will
feel younger, your skin will be really
clean, smooth, fresh, and scented.
Together with a youthful sensation
of well-being it will also give you
joy of living.”
But wait. The climax of my in-
vestigations was the opening of the
Aramis Bar at Georges and there I
met Norma Vaughan, general mana-
ger for Estee Lauder in Australia.
She pointed out that Aramis was
the most exclusive of American male
grooming aids. It was all very good
fun. She demonstrated to me Aramis
pre-shave lotion, Aramis after-shave
lotion, and applied to my hand Ara-
mis gloriously fragrant all-weather
male hand cream for my poor
chapped hands. There were delight-
fully smelling roll-on male deodor-
ants, and aerosol male deodorants.
Then there was an Aramis male in-
visible net. “Very sensible
really,” said Mrs. Vaughan. “It
conquers the impossible cowlick all
day.”
Next she brought out the Aramis
mark-out. This was a skin-colored
paste for marking out blemishes to
the skin and/or for covering up
razor nicks. I tried a little of that,
too. Next there was the Aramis pick-
up mask ... “a ten-minute cocktail
for the skin that refreshes, relaxes,
stimulates. A special silicone gel
gives your face that firm, alert tone
it needs after a hard day’s work.” I
tried some of that, too.
Finally Mrs. Vaughan took out a
box of Aramis eye pads . . . “The
antidote for smoke-filled rooms and
late nights.” She placed one over
either eye they were wet, antisep-
tic, and utterly fragrant. “The idea,”
she said, “is to tell your secretary
that you are not to be disturbed
for 15 minutes, lie back in your
chair with pads on your eyes, and
then wake up ready to scintillate.”
After all these preparations I
went out into Collins Street scintil-
lating, alert, smelling like the
casualty ward at the Royal Mel-
bourne. Only one thing disturbed
me. I had thought that Aramis was
merely that fine member of the
Three Musketeers, but in a pamphlet
I read: “Aramis is an exotic root
originally used by the Turks as an
aphrodisiac.” It’s not good to feel
like that at 10 a.m.

Thea Proctor: a memoir
Miss Thea Proctor, by George Lambert. Art Gallery of N.S.W.
From BARRY HUMPHRIES in London
THEA PROCTOR is dead. She was
86, and I was privileged to know
her in what proved to be the last
few months of a long and creative life.
The very first picture I ever bought
was a design for a fan, painted on silk
by Thea Proctor. Only a schoolboy, I
carried it proudly home from Leonard
Joel’s auction rooms in Melbourne, and
it is still me, hanging on the wall
of my study in London. The pre-
dominant influence in the picture is
Conder, an artist whom Miss Proctor
knew personally, and who had a strong
influence on her early work. In the
’thirties, I think she came to regret this
influence a little, but although her
decorations owed a great deal to the
spirit of Conder’s ornamental panels
and fans, I have always felt that they
had an individuality and strength of
their own. There was a crisp joie de
vivre about them quite different in feel-
ing from the languorous caprices of
Conder. Then again, Thea Proctor
could draw superbly.
When I returned to Sydney last year
I saw several of her recent drawings
in the Macquarie Galleries. They were
nude studies of an astonishing brilliance.
The draughtsmanship was sure and
subtle, and it was incredible to think
that they had been executed by an artist
in the 86th year of her life.
I longed to meet her, and an intro-
duction was arranged by a mutual
friend, Mr. Patrick White.
At the time I r was performing at the
Theatre Royal in Sydney, and Thea
Proctor attended a matinee, it having
been arranged that she should come
backstage after the show for a cup of
lapsang soochong, her favorite tea.
She was still very beautiful, and look-
ing at this extremely tall, exquisitely
groomed old lady one recognised, with-
out difficulty, the striking young woman
who appears in more than one of
George Lambert’s most celebrated
paintings. Then, and at many other
meetings, she talked vividly about the
Lamberts, whom she had known inti-
mately, but always when she spoke of
George it was with a peculiar passion
and enthusiasm. She was quite right in
believing that his talent was one of the
most shining in the brief but rich canon
of Australian art, though one couldn’t
help wondering how she felt about so
many modern painters who have utterly
lost touch with the consummate pro-
fessionalism which Lambert stood for,
a professionalism which always distin-
guished her own work.
Another of her great enthusiasms was
for the work of her cousin John Rus-
sell, the Australian impressionist and
friend of Monet and Van Gogh. She
worked for a number of years, in vain
as it turned out, to secure a represen-
tative collection of this important artist’s
work for the Art Gallery of N.S.W.
Her championship of other artists was
always generous and unerring. In 1923
it was her vote, and Lambert’s, which
won the Society of Artists’ travelling
scholarship for Roi de Mestre, and
only a few short months ago she was
urging me to visit a gallery in order
to see the remarkable and imaginative
etchings of Elizabeth Rooney, whom she
rightly felt to be very gifted.
Earlier this year I had an opportunity
to visit Thea Proctor daily in the
charming flat in Double Bay which she
has lived in, I think, since her return
from Europe in 1921. She was painting
my wife’s portrait, and I believe the
task gave her a special pleasure.
At such times it was extraordinary to
hear her speak of fancy dress parties in
the London of 1904, parties attended
by Conder and Lambert, Steer and
Orpen, and the young Augustus John.
Her powers of recollection and descrip-
tion were amazing, and she could evoke
these far-off gatherings in the most pre-
cise detail, right down to the attire of
the guests and the color of the wall-
paper. She was able to convey the exact
atmosphere and excitement of that
vanished period.
It was extraordinary, also, to imagine
this alert, articulate woman over half a
century ago reading bedtime stories
from Beatrix Potter to the late Constant
Lambert.
Yet at no time in her company did
one feel that Thea Proctor had outlived
her time. In no sense whatever was
she faintly out of place in present-day
Sydney. Always impeccably dressed in
lavender or violet, she regularly
attended art openings of the most for-
midable modernity, she who was her-
self one of the first “moderns” to
exhibit in Australia.
I hope that our national galleries will
honor her memory with a large retro-
spective exhibition. It would be a
memorial to her achievement which
one might have hoped, rather wistfully,
had been unveiled in her lifetime.

Pilgrimage To Vence
By VAL WAKE
I WAS 20 and I was making a pil-
grimage. The critic Kenneth Tynan
said the old man was available and
would be pleased to see me. With that
and a hurriedly scrawled note from
the man himself, telling me his phone
number, I left London for Vence.
E. Gordon Craig to me was some-
thing of an oracle. His temple was
theatre and he had lived it all his
life. Now he was living in exile like his
friend Max Beerbohm, sitting in the
Mediterranean sun, being very avail-
able but with nobody to talk to.
But before going to Vence we went
to Sabionetta, a small walled town,
once a seat of the Medici government
and now at the end of a hot dirt road
north of Florence. It was at Sabionetta
that Gordon Craig found what he glee-
fully called his “missing link.” This
discovery was made in the early 19205.
Even then Craig was something of a
legend. Some of his work had been
accepted, but there were others, par-
ticularly the West End managements,
who thought his ideas were not commer-
cial. What Craig wanted to do with
sets was something which would look
to us today like highly stylised tele-
vision production and what he wanted
to do with lights would today be con-
sidered very orthodox by the average
television producer.
Craig went to Sabionetta to work
on another book. The subject, of course,
was theatre, as it had been since the
late 1890 s when his provocative and
breezy style had provided much debate
at the tables of the Cafe Royal. There
was Shaw and Beerbohm and one or two
others. It was said that Shaw was in
love with Craig’s mother, Ellen Terry.
It was a very wordy affair, for this was
the time for words, and the fact that
Craig was the illegitimate issue of one
of his mother’s affairs didn’t seem to
have much bearing on the Cafe Royal
debating group.
He went to Sabionetta to find a
theatre: the first theatre where a pro-
scenium arch was used in what we
know today as Western Theatre. But
what had been the gay and cultured
centre of the Medici court, with bril-
liant murals and delicately carved
statues, was now a picture theatre. The
owner had punched some holes in the
wall to accommodate the projector,
and around the semi-circle, with its
wooden tiers, where once the court sat,
Sabionetta’s citizenry sat and ate while
the silver screen flickered with its
images.
Even then, in the early 19205, Craig
was a voice; and when he wrote to
Rome, telling the authorities of this sad
omission, the people of Sabionetta got
a new picture theatre and the old stage
was declared a national monument.
When we went to Sabionetta in 1957,
the Government had not yet got around
to its renovation program. The front
door was almost off its hinges, but the
walls had been cleaned, and beneath
the whitewash which the picture-
theatre proprietor had had splashed
about the interior were some of the
faded colors of the old theatre.
Was Craig fading away or vegetating
in his pension in the Alpes Maritimes?
He wasn’t. He was not in his room
when we called. The concierge wasn’t
too sure where he was. “He’ll be down
in the village,” she said. “He usually
eats in such-and-such cafe.” When we
got back on the street we found him.
He was a big man with a wide brim
straw hat, a black cape, and a string
around his neck with a small bag at
the end in which he held his pencils.
He strode as no man of 85 might be
expected to stride, and there was a
definite theatrical air about the man.
I had been prepared to see a man
defeated, not this free-wheeling extro-
vert who seemed to accept the town as
his kingdom. He was certainly lonely,
lonely for recognition, but he was still
fighting for his cause and he kept his
pencils with him so he could record
each worthwhile idea as it came to him.
“You know those people in London
won’t buy my books,” he said. It was
his library, an incomparable collection
of books on theatre which were now
scattered about his room. Craig knew
that if they weren’t sent to some insti-
tute before he died they would be lost.
“You know the fools won’t accept my
price,” he said. He was not going to
give the,m away. Craig was, as ever, a
professional, the theatre was as much
a business as a love affair.
I told him I had seen a Peter Brook
production of “Hamlet” which appar-
ently employed some of the techniques
shown in the Victoria and Albert exhi-
bition.
“You know Max Reinhart used to
pinch my ideas,” he said. “He used to
come and see my stuff and then run
over to his place and do the same
thing. At one stage when I was pub-
lishing the ‘Mask’ I had to print rail-
way time-tables to stay in business,”
and so it went on, picking pieces out
of the past, not letting them fall
together, for that would make it too
simple. There was a lot of mischief in
Craig.
Had he seen much theatre lately?
No, there wasn’t the opportunity any-
more, but he regularly heard from
Tynan at the London “Observer.” “A
bright lad,” he said.
He was not unhappy in Vence, he
had time to work out his ideas; and
although to my knowledge he never
went back to England, there were a
number of theatre people who made
that pilgrimage to Vence. They came
to listen, and Craig, as always, had a
lot to say.

Taronga Park: Who’s Zoo?
The lifetime love-affair of the far-from-silent Knight
By A. H. CHISHOLM
“fTIHE best view at Taronga is to be
I gained by standing at the lower
entrance and gazing resolutely
out over the harbor.”
There you have an assured opinion,
recorded by that alert and indestructible
commentator on the social scene, Leon
Gellert, after he had, on the impulse of
“a sudden temptation,” surprised him-
self by wandering into Sydney’s Zoo.
The occasion of Leon’s lapse was
about fifteen years ago I have just
come upon his narrative in an old
folder. But age has not withered nor
action staled the soundness of the
comment, since the conduct of Taronga
today is little better than it ever was.
I would not say that there is still “a
black despondency” over the whole
outfit. Yet it remains true that some
of the captives those penned in
small cages or in Pseudo-Silurian con-
crete dens appear to be rather less
happy than are their inanimate coun-
terparts in cases at Sydney’s Museum.
I call as witnesses on the general
subject two pairs of observers of the
Taronga scene during recent weeks.
First: a young woman and another
not so young. They ranged alongside
me when, in the course of one of my
occasional Zoo checks, I was com-
miserating with a tiger that was eddy-
ing about in a dog-box arrangement
that gave it little more than room to
turn.
“Oooo!” the girl said, “I think it’s
real cruel to have a tiger in a cage
like that.”
“So it is,” the older woman agreed.
“He needs more room and something
softer for his feet. What’s more,” she
added, after a glance skyward, “he
gets very little sun here.”
Clearly, those two casual observers
had more vision, or at least more feel-
ing for animal welfare, than the Zoo
controllers, trustees, and staff combined.
Next witnesses: two Public Service
Board officials, Messrs. N. Thompson
and J. T. Quinn, who were appointed
at the behest of the N.S.W. Lands
Minister, Mr. T. Lewis, to make a
detailed review of Taronga and its
affairs: this consequent upon frequent
public impeachments of the place. The
job was done with a considerable degree
of thoroughness.
Essentially, the two investigators
appear to have been required to make
their inquiry from the angles of finance
and administration. But, of course, each
of those factors blends into matters
touching the display and welfare of the
Zoo’s inmates, and therefore the
probers found themselves obliged, not
as zoologists but as reasonable observers,
to make certain general comments.
It would, in fact, have been surpris-
ing if they had failed to do so. That
is to say, after finding that finances
had deteriorated and that administra-
tion was soggy in various respects, the
investigators were bound to remark,
if only in consideration of the food
bill, on the blatant over-stocking that
has caused Taronga in recent years
to suggest the crowded desperation of
a human slum area.
The Thompson-Quinn duo gave some
figures on the point. They cited, for
example, the Zoo’s possession of 66 red
kangaroos, and they went on to list
58 red deer, 44 fallow deer, 15 giraffes,
17 New Guinea dogs, 15 lions, 12 tigers,
and 11 elephants. Here, obviously,
was a stark example of inefficiency on
the food front overfeeding of the
public in the matter of display and
needless expense entailed by the feed-
ing of so many animals.
Conglomerating of this nature (which
extends also to birds) has long been a
sore subject with Sydney naturalists,
and with general observers as well.
Many detailed and pungent criticisms
have been published. Yet none of them,
however well-intentioned, has ever dis-
turbed the curious smugness of Tar-
onga’s Establishment.
Zoo controllers were not, it appears,
unduly concerned by a newspaper cor-
respondent’s charge of “needless
cruelty” to the captives, supported by
another visitor’s complaint that the area
was “filthy and smelly.” Nor, appar-
ently, did they allow their slumbers to
be disturbed by a columnist’s sage obser-
vation, bearing on ‘roos and wallabies,
“If Taronga crams any more of them
into that grim, concrete enclosure,
they’ll have to breathe alternately.”
The Overall Pooh-Bah
JNDEED, as an almost incredible fact,
in a comment on the report of
the Public Service investigators, much
of it devastating and very little appreci-
ative, the former controller of the in-
stitution, Sir Edward Hallstrom, pro-
claimed that he regarded the report as
“very complimentary.” As a further
comment in kind, he is credited with
having said, “I do not like animals
being cooped up” a remark which
a disrespectful Sydney columnist listed
among his Laughs of the Week.
In point of fact, he never should
have been permitted to exercise full
control. The Zoo should have had, as
the Thompson-Quinn report now
recommends, a trained zoologist as
director, plus an assistant skilled in
public relations, with the chairman’s
activity directed simply to finance and
business administration.
Hallstrom’s enthusiasm in relation
to Taronga has never been in doubt.
It, as much as the manufacture of
refrigerators, has long been his obses-
sion: his plaything in the view of
some critics. Much of his own money,
no doubt, has gone into the place.
Its overall Pooh-Bah, he has also been
its only official publicist, always willing
to provide newspapers with “news” of
sorts, and always willing and even
eager to pose for photographs with
anything from a parrot to a python
and that in spite of any indignity that
the exhibit might commit upon him.
He has also kept in close touch with
most zoos in other countries. Indeed,
his over-generous supplying of them
with Australian and New Guinea fauna
has been a chief complaint next
to the mixed conditions in Taronga
on the part of conservation bodies.
They have claimed that this would
not have been permitted to any person
or body of lesser influence.
They have argued the same thing in
respect of the Hallstrom tenancy of a
trusteeship. Under legislation enacted
a good many years ago all trustees of
reservations in N.S.W. are required to
vanish the scene at the age of 70.
(This had the effect of getting rid of
some duds, mainly ex-politicians, and
some useful fellows as well.) But when
Hallstrom reached 70 he was sur-
prisingly permitted, with the blessing
of a Labor Government, to carry on
for another three years; and when that
period expired he still continued to do
the Big Boss act, this time under the
title of “hon. life director” or some-
thing similar it varied in various
newspapers.
That development annoyed certain
oldtimers who had lost their agreeable
jobs as trustees of other reservations.
Pointing out that they too were “hon.”,
they wanted to know why only one of
their ilk should be allowed to continue
as a “life director.”
Since the tide of time washed Sir
Edward out of the trust chairmanship,
that position has been filled by his son,
John. But, true to filial tradition, the
new boy has been going very quietly.
All Taronga tattle (not to mention
photographic poses) has continued to
emanate from the old source. And, even
now, with the odd position of “hon. life
director” in the discard, it seems un-
likely that the chairman will get a
clear run at any early date.
The point here is that Sir Edward
has lately acquired yet another quaint
title, that of “Director Emeritus of
the Zoo.” Superficially, the label of

Emeritus enables its holder to cease
active operations and rest on whatever
laurels he may possess. But whether
the senior Hallstrom will do this appears
doubtful. Certainly his long-standing
i a • foctn
love affair wtth Taronga plus h.s aste
for authority, will make it difficult
for him to forsake the stage.
In fact, he “retired” on July 17 and
yet on August 4 radio listeners were
informed that a large batch of Aus-
tralian mammals and birds was being
shipped to California, and, although an
American keeper was at hand, ship-
ment was being supervised by Sir
Edward Hallstrom.” _
At events, it is reasonab e to
? u PP“ e “ a of . tha Le™
inquiry both the exhibits at Taronga
y nd the blic who patronise ,| e
. wm p TOmeth ing in the nature
0 f a new at n 0 distant date.
As remarked earlier, the Thompson-
Quinn report was restricted largely to
finance and administration. On the
zoological side, the Minister had hoped
for advice from an English expert. He
has, at time of writing, failed to get
his man, wherefore he may have to be
content with an Australian source. And
why not? Alternatively, he may let the
matter rest temporarily if he meditates
adopting the recommendation for the
appointment of a qualified director.
By and large, therefore, the situation
in regard to Taronga Park, Australia’s
largest and best-sited zoo, is full of
possibilities. Here are some of the de-
velopments which zoologists hope to
see brought about:
1. Restriction on overcrowding,
abolition of small cages, less use of
concrete (particularly broken portions)
for creatures accustomed to earth, and
generally more informative displays of
the exhibits.
2. Provision for research, perhaps
in association with the zoology depart-
ments of the universities, and the
issuing of printed annual reports giv-
ing informative details, as is the case
with London’s Regent’s Park, regard-
ing zoological developments, including
deaths and their causes. (Taronga has
always neglected its obligations to both
science and schools.)
3. The establishing, at no distance
from Sydney, of a large reservation
where native mammals and birds could
be bred freely and displayed well, as is
the case with England’s Whipsnade in
relation to Regent’s Park. Most other
Australian cities have small public
sanctuaries of the kind fairly close at
hand, with the highly popular Mac-
kenzie Sanctuary at Healesville, 40
miles east of Melbourne, as the chief
example. All such spots have sound
tourism value. (The Healesville enter-
prise, by the way, has been well sup-
ported by private firms.)
Conniving at Law-breaking
QNE other reflection: Taronga Park
needs to be told, quite clearly, that it
must cease encouraging those people
who say “Let’s take it to the
zoo” whenever they come upon a
young or disabled creature in the bush.
A year or two ago there were two
heavy disturbances over this kind of
thing, one involving young platypuses
and the other young jabirus, both
strictly protected fauna. And in another
case a Sydney police sergeant had to
be told in newspaper correspondence
that he was conniving at law-breaking
by advising an inquirer to send a wan-
dering spiny anteater to Taronga.
As the responsible Minister pointed
out, the zoo has no more right to
receive protected fauna without official
permission than is the case with any
private person.
In brief, Taronga has been its own
authority and its own preserve in
regard to both home-kept and traded
fauna far too long. And it remains
true, as a BULLETIN commentator
observed a couple of years ago, that
“the whole question of the administra-
tion of the export of fauna and the
role of some zoos seems a question for
very close Government scrutiny.”


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
A Very English Occasion
From PAUL FROLICH in London
WHEN the British proceeded to
give independence to their far-
flung possessions, they lost most
of their opportunities for eccentricity.
But not all. I’ve just spent two after-
noons and evenings at Glyndebourne
and am tempted to describe the experi-
ence as “improbable” even allowing
for the changes that have befallen this
fine institution since the 19305, when
it was run by its founders, owner, John
Christie, and musical director, Fritz
Busch.
Where else in the world could you
see an earnest elite, in full evening
dress, descend on a city’s main railway
station immediately after lunch,
assemble varied hampers, baskets, and
rugs and set off into the green country-
side for an evening of opera? Perform-
ances start between 5.30 and 6 p.m.,
but audiences for the fully booked-out
season start to arrive by four o’clock.
The women, apart from the rare dowdy
one, wear the most startling creations
and ample jewellery; the men are all
in evening dress, but not necessarily
conventional (I spotted a green velvet
smoking jacket). They deposit their
loads in sheltered corners and proceed
to stroll about the acres of, often drip-
ping, lawns and colorful formal gardens,
through shrubberies, across crocquet
lawns, and along the banks of slumber-
ing ponds in bright sunlight and
drizzling rain, occasionally stopping by
their hampers for a glass of champagne
or a sticky cake. Their conversation is
startling to the casual listener: it is
almost exclusively of music, specifically
of opera.
JQURING my weeks in Britain, I dis-
covered that music has indeed be-
come respectable and now forms part
of the life to which the socially select
subscribe. This extends even to patron-
age. It is good to learn that wealthy in-
dividuals, as well as numerous corpora-
tions, now subsidise institutions such
as the Bath and Glyndebourne Festivals.
Commercial sponsorship is well estab-
lished and I found, for instance, that
the concert deficits inevitably incurred
by the New Philharmonia are covered
by grants from big business.
Although music has become part of
the Establishment, this does not always
result in high standards of performance
or in an informed critical attitude. No-
where was this more painfully apparent
than at Glyndebourne. As attendance
at a performance here costs an average
of at least £stg.lo allowing for cost
of ticket, fares, dinner, and incidentals
such as a very lavishly printed book
of programs people are clearly de-
termined to convince themselves of
having had their money’s worth! I
heard Mozart’s “Magic Flute,” which
has been in the repertoire for several
seasons, and Massenet’s “Werther,” a
new production added this year. The
remainder of the 1966 season, not heard
by me, was made up of Purcell’s “Dido
and Aeneas” coupled with Ravel’s
“L’Heure Espagnole” and Handel’s
“Jephtha” which, at its recent premiere,
had a very mixed reception from the
Press, mainly because of its obvious
unsuitability for the stage.
The “Magic Flute,” sung in German,
coincided with a new production of this
opera, in English and directed by Solti,
at Covent Garden and I rather wished
I had selected the latter. Glynde-
bourne’s production was certainly lavish
and colorful enough and the play’s
masonic significance was adequately
brought out; but the London Phil-
harmonic Orchestra, conducted by
Hans Gierster, was of a severely pro-
vincial standard and made a dreadful
mess of much of the lovely music,
particularly in the grand overture. The
performance moved with good pace
and there was the right blend of fun
and gravity, but one’s dramatic enjoy-
ment was marred by very inadequate
German from most of the singers, pain-
fully apparent in spoken dialogue.
Massenet’s “Werther” is so definitely
a period piece that I rather admire
the management’s courage in putting
it on. It had charming sets and was
produced by Michael Redgrave, who
Jean Brazzi as Werther and Helia
T’Hezan as Charlotte in Massenet’s
“Werther” at Glyndebourne, Sussex,
England.
had labored to create dramatically con-
vincing action from a libretto in which
every character is virtuous, sympathetic
and a trifle insipid. Although there is
much fine music in the opera, the or-
chestra is given more scope for y shin-
ing than are the singers. The orchestra,
conducted by Carlo Felice Cillario,
was very much better this time and
made the most of the lush score, with
considerable success. With the limited
material available to them, the principal
singers did remarkably well. Helia
T’Hezan as Charlotte, Francoise Doue
as Sophie, Jean Brazzi as Werther, and
Pierre Le Hemonet as Albert were
vocally excellent and histrionically did
all that one could reasonably expect.
rpHE Glyndebourne Theatre, with all
that goes with it, is beautifully de-
signed, spacious, and agreeable; the
seats are comfortable, the acoustics ex-
cellent. Purely musical questions apart,
it seems to me to be both a success
and a failure. It succeeds brilliantly as
a grand social event. It fails as a
“Festival” by my reckoning because of
a total lack of communication between
audience and artists; its rigid social
conventions, peculiar to Glyndebourne,
make a proper mixing even among
members of the audience rather dif-
ficult. To a visitor from overseas and
there were many such present no
opportunity is offered for meeting
others at some informal talking place
and I suspect that the “informal”
formality of the event will make it few
friends outside the English “in” set. The
dinner intervals, lasting up to hours,
can seem very long to a visitor from
outside.
After Glyndebourne there was yet
another festival, the one at Chelten-
ham. The 22nd of its kind, lasting two
weeks, it offered varied fare to those
visiting the Georgian Spa, situated in
the lovely Cotswolds. More than
30 composers, including Egon Wellesz,
Richard Rodney Bennett, Gordon
Crosse, Elizabeth Lutyens, John
Ogdon, Alun Hodinott, and Alexander
Goehr, had new work performed
here. -Among notable performers
at the festival were Barbirolli, Ger-
vase de Peyer, Hugo Rignold,
Vladimir Ashkenazy, John Ogdon,
Norman del Mar, the Czech Nonet, and
several of Britain’s leading regional
orchestras.
In addition to enjoying Chelten-
ham’s architecture, hospitality, and the
lovely surrounding scenery, I attended
two concerts and entered into the fes-
tival spirit, which was enhanced by the
presence of a great many young com-
posers and their lively discussions. The
Prague Chamber Orchestra suffered
from the same trouble as their
“Czech” colleagues had at Bath; they,
too, play without conductor and this
tends to .mask the true quality of their
performance. A rather large group, of
22 strings plus winds and percussion,
they cannot make the music live by
merely staying together and splendid
attack. Between a lukewarm “Don
Giovanni” overture and a lively per-

formance of Mozart’s “Prague” sym-
phony marred by the absence of
any finer nuances they played three
works new to me, two of them
Czech. A Suite for String Orchestra,
written by Jindrich Feld in 1961, dis-
closed considerable charm and, with
its limited scoring, came off quite
well; the music is not unlike early
Britten and includes some fine rhyth-
mic sections. Jiri Jaroch’s Symphony
No. 2, written for this ensemble in
1960 and with a very exciting featured
horn part, is a thoroughly attractive
work and could be quite lively; in the
event, for the reasons mentioned, it
did not come to life and merely im-
pressed as a work of potential interest
which needs strong direction for its
full emergence.
The most interesting work was
“Litany, op. 26,” for double string
orchestra, by Peter Racine Fricker.
The music dates from 1956, is lucidly
and cleanly scored, and the perform-
ance succeeded quite brilliantly. It
is a lovely work, particularly in the
last two of its six sections, and,
although there is a flavor of Vaughan
Williams in it, the music is thoroughly
original and workmanlike and worth
hearing again.
In a lunch-hour recital I heard
Cheltenham sisters Felicity and
Antonietta Notariello in a challenging
program for piano and violin duo.
Felicity, a pupil of Robert Masters,
Menuhin, and Tibor Varga, proved a
convincing interpreter of uncommonly
difficult music. An interesting premiere
was “Improvisations I and II” by
Robert Sherlaw Johnson; the music, as
is decreed by current fad, is played in
any order decided by the performers,
but the material itself proved to be
far from dry or disjointed, but rather
rhapsodic in character and lucidly
agreeable. “Six Epigrams” by Derek
Healey was less exciting; here, too, the
sisters played exceedingly well, but the
material was fairly common, late
expressionistic music, attractive enough
but quickly forgotten. Very fine, and
worthy of being in any duo’s reper-
toire, was a violin sonata of 1943 by
Elizabeth Maconchy who, as all the
composers concerned, was present.
Allowing her sister a rest, Antonietta
Notariello gave a brilliant reading of
a new work by Australian-born Mal-
colm Williamson a pleasant young
man with a great dislike for Austra-
lian newspaper critics. Five pieces for
piano solo, titled “Ships, Towers,
Domes, Theatres, and Temples,”
I found this music greatly superior to
the composer’s third concerto, which
flopped in Sydney and was again aired
at Cheltenham by faithful John Ogdon.
The pieces are atmospheric, in a direct
line from late Debussy; they are
wholly interesting and, however diffi-
cult to play, easy to listen to. Much of
Williamson’s material is of folk origin,
used in a great variety of ways, includ-
ing jazzy ones. Though this is not very
important music, I enjoyed it and the
indication that Williamson is looking
for new directions.

BALLET
Completely Immersed
Les Ballets Africains. Comedy, Mel-
bourne.
THE return visit of Les Ballets
Africains provides an interesting
comparison with the Ballet Folk-
lorico of Mexico. While the latter con-
sists of fully trained professionals in-
terpreting various folk themes, the
former is an attempt to impose pro-
fessionalism on the genuine article. For-
tunately, it does not succeed; the
authentic ethnic values completely
swamp the Western veneer, which be-
comes evident only rarely.
Australian critics have studiously
ignored the bare-breast angle. But to
ignore the whole controversial matter
is doing the public and the ballet a
disservice. The promoters are cashing
in handsomely and, let us be honest,
mainly on the strength of bosoms. De-
termined to give value for money, the
printed program starts with a full-page
close-up of the best available bust in
the cast and the stage action com-
mences with a fertility rite which fully
exploits the mobility the static photo-
graph cannot supply. Built around an
utterly talentless lady whose mammary
activities are tasteless rather than
obscene, this makes a mockery of the
very thing which, elsewhere in the
same program, is clearly a justifiable
part of the whole and could not con-
ceivably give offence to anyone.
The most successful item of the
evening is a ballet entitled simply “The
Forest.” This alone more than justifies
the whole venture. It contains a mag-
nificent collection of African masques
of all shapes and sizes, from gigantic
stilt dancers to miniature hobgoblins
which will haunt my dreams for
months to come. There is a legitimate
story of love, seduction, and punish-
ment which, to the accompaniment of
brilliantly persistent drums, is gory
enough to satisfy the most sadistic
spectator. Yet here there is no feeling
of sensationalism being imposed for
box-office purposes. The male lead,
Italo Zambo, and his victim, Touguia-
tou Camarav (legitimately and inoffen-
sively bare-top after the seduction
scene), act, dance, and moan their
parts to perfection. This ballet com-
bines the best of all the other items
and would be a sensation by itself.
Musicians will be fascinated by an
incredible instrument, the cora, which
is described as an African guitar with
21 strings; it resembles a guitar about
as ,much as I resemble an elephant.
Sissoko Bakary (described delightfully
in the program as “commissionaire”)
is the virtuoso who starts by making us
believe that the instrument is only cap-
able of variations on one note. Then
suddenly there are subtle overtones and
in no time at all this cumbersome mon-
strosity is producing sounds reminis-
cent of delicate harp arpeggios. I was
persistently unsuccessful in determin-
ing how this primitive assembly can
possibly be tuned by any but hit-and-
miss methods.
The dancers possess more energy than
skill and the choreographer (unnamed)
is severely limited by this. There are
a few, a very few, acrobatics which
are primitive imitations of stunts we
have seen performed better. However,
the childish pleasure the artists get
from this form of non-authentic in-
trusion extends itself across the foot-
lights. In fact, this complete immersion
in all they do is the greatest asset the
dancers possess. The real stars of the
show are, however, the costumes, which
are often quite stunning. Unfortunately,
every item suffers from the bane of in-
experienced production, excessive length.

Frail Flower
A Lily in Little India. Donald Howarth.
St. Martin’s, Melbourne.
“T ITTLE INDIA” is a slummy
| j suburb in an English North
Country town, with Raj road
names like Bombay Road and Calcutta
Street. And the lily is one nurtured in
a flower pot by Alvin Hanker, a weedy,
lonely, and stupid teenager.
Alvin sought solace in horticulture
when his widowed mother shamelessly
seduced the boarder, a self-esteeming
postman. Locked in his upstairs room
with a bulb, gardening book, and a
gumboot full of loam, Alvin ceases to
feel inadequate and rejected, and be-
comes just a tiny bit god-like, thrilling
with creative power as the tiny green
spear grows tall and strong.
His mother, guilty and angry, is
“I wish you’d teach me yoga, then
we could contemplate together”
determined to find out what unspeak-
able activity is going on behind the
locked door. So she and the postman
mount a ladder and discover the poig-
nant lily. But Alvin returns and dis-
covers them, and when his mother
threatens the life of his beloved plant,
he calmly topples the ladder, mother
and all, into the back garden.
Alvin moves in with a lonely girl
who is nursing her elderly, ailing father,
while his now bed-ridden mother grows
fat and bitter. Suddenly finding himself
with a husband’s responsibilities and
denied any sexual reward, the postman
goes seeking fresh landladies, and Alvin
is persuaded to return home. The lily
finishes its life on the grave of the
girl’s father, having served its purpose
well. For while Alvin is still weedy and
stupid, he has become serene.
As you’ve gathered, it’s a slight,
charging little play. The stage is cram-
med with seven acting areas, a kitchen,
a' stairway, four bedrooms, and a couple
of streets. The dialogue is made up
of Pinteresque inanities, with an occa-
sional self-conscious soliloquy to explain
motivations. Howarth’s style has been
heavily influenced by TV drama, and
the play would probably be more at
home in that medium. But Irene Mit-
chell’s production is well worth a visit,
if only to see Paul Karo’s performance
as Alvin. Karo plays the role with a
Stan Laurel dead-pan, a Ringo Starr
voice, and slow-motion movements. Yet
without facial expressions, vocal modu-
lation, or changes of pace, he expresses
a remarkable range of semi-emotions.
Dorothy Bradley is fine as his Mum,
particularly when she’s busy seducing
the smug Sydney Conabere with heavy
innuendo and cups of tea. Diana Green-
tree played the melancholy girlfriend
with sensitivity, and John Paton was
excellent as her querulous old father.

Monogamy without
Monotony
The Lover. Pinter. Q Lunch-hour
Theatre, Sydney.
IN “The Lover,” Pinter points out a
way to overcome the monotony of
monogamy, which is both ingenious
and tidy, and, outwardly at least,
perfectly respectable. How can a wife
have a lover without being unfaithful
to her husband and a husband a mis-
tress without being unfaithful to his
wife?
The key to this riddle lies in the
realm of fantasy, a country Pinter’s
couple, Richard and Sarah, have col-
onised together for their own pleasure.
This is a land where it is always after-
noon the stretch between lunch and
afternoon tea. Until Richard decides to
make a change, a development which
frightens Sarah until she realises that it
is still the same game.

they make every effort to create the
illusion of reality and strict rules are
observed. Richard, dressed in suit and
tie, goes off to his business in the city,
promising not to return too early be-
cause Sarah’s lover is coming in the
afternoon. When he reappears in the
afternoon under the name of Max, he
is dressed in sports clothes while Sarah
has changed to tight dress and high
heels. When he arrives home for dinner
he is again wearing his suit and frowns
on Sarah’s high heels, which she has
forgotten to change for comfortable
housewife’s shoes.
“The Lover,” like Pinter’s other
plays, is a mixture of the comic, verg-
ing on the absurd, and the sinister,
although the comedy predominates. It
is a far cry from the traditional comic
or farcical complications involving hus-
bands, mistresses, wives, and lovers and
cupboards, screens, back stairs, and de-
ception. With the emancipation of
women and democracy in the home,
old-fashioned deception is out. Pinter’s
vision of the perfectly self-sufficient,
completely democratic modern sub-
urban couple for whom not even fan-
tasy is private is both amusing and a
little frightening.
Jim Sharman has produced this neat
comedy with a light touch. Anne Haddy
is very seductive as Sarah the mistress,
while Max Meldrum gives an excellent
performance as Richard the husband
and Max the lover.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
FILMS
Modern myths
Modesty Blaise. Director, Joseph Losey.
The Chase. Director, Arthur Penn.
Stagecoach. Director, Gordon Douglas.
THOUGH Joseph Losey has never
been a humorless director, his
films so far have been completely
serious in intention. But he abandons
himself completely to frivolity in
“Modesty Blaise,” a decadent, sophis-
ticated fantasy-thriller that makes
James Bond look as solemn as a socio-
logical treatise.
Comic strips, with their rigid con-
ventions of unreality, their built-in wish
fulfilment, are the mythology of
today; and this film, based on comic-
strip characters, goes even beyond the
newspaper cartoon in extravagance.
Here is a heroine, an imperfectly re-
formed jewel-thief of unlimited wealth,
initiative, beauty, and guile, who can
change her clothes and her hair color
in the twinkling of an eye, and who
can subdue any man either by karate
or sexual attraction, which ever takes
her fancy. What woman could resist
this unadmirable daydream? Pitted
against her is Gabriel, a remarkably
engaging arch villain, also possessed
of unlimited wealth, initiative, beauty,
and guile.
The set designs, carrying op and
pop art to their most weirdly remote
conclusion, are in themselves worth
study. Monica Vitti, elegantly effete,
is a fine choice for Modesty, with
Terence Stamp as her devoted, virile
(and very funny) henchman.
But the film is effortlessly stolen by
Dirk Bogarde, who, as Gabriel, has a
high old time camping it up in plat-
inum-colored wig and pastel parasols,
sipping blue drinks containing lazily
finning goldfish.
Described as a Western, “The
Chase” is certainly set in Texas and
the sheriff wears a funny hat, but this
is about his only likeness to the old-
style, outdoorsy Western. Although set
in a community where farming and oil-
drilling provide most of the money, it
is almost claustrophobically urban in
atmosphere a powerful study of
violence and depravity in a prosperous
town where the ritualistic Saturday-
night booze-up is rendered dangerously
explosive by the return of an escaped
convict whom many of the locals
have reason to hate and fear.
Arthur Penn exposes the steamy, un-
healthy reality of the picture-postcard
town by starting his film slowly and
building up tension to the climactic
holocaust; Joseph La Shelle’s color
photography is beautiful and imagin-
ative. A remarkably high-class cast
headed by Marlon Brando, Robert
Redford, Jane Fonda, and James Fox
gives extremely satisfactory perfor-
mances.
Back to the standard Western with
“Stagecoach,” a new version of John
Ford’s classic. It would surely have
been better to re-issue the original than
to waste money on this deadly remake.
The color photography slips queasily
in and out of focus, and the players
with the saving exception of Bing
Crosby, skittish and diverting as the
bibulous doctor give uniformly poor
performances.

Strong Attack
Daniel Shafran. Direction, ABC. Town

THE most striking feature of visiting
Russian cellist Daniel Shafran’s
recital was the amount of sheer
physical energy expended. His attack
is almost one of violence, and the con-
siderable number of bow hairs demol-
ished during the evening were the
material evidence of his powerful
playing style. Although the major part
of his program was drawn from the
traditional cello repertoire, Shafran’s
selections within this field were wisely
in sympathy with the strengths of his
technical equipment an enormous
tone and dazzling left-hand agility.

Bach around 1720 have been the un-
disputed cellist’s Bible. Shafran played
the last (and most difficult) of the set,
No. 6 in D major, with characteristic
brilliance and strength. His thumb
position work (fully tested by the
rambling Prelude) is exceptionally
accurate and was delivered without the
customary strain or tone distortion. In
the interpretation of both the violin
artitas and the cello Suites a flexible
approach to tempi has become the
modern practice. Shafran handled this
device quite well, only the Allemande
suffering from an overindulgence in
melodramatic rubati.
When a cellist really wants to make
a noise, he plays either of the two
sonatas by Brahms. Of these, the
second in F major (Opus 99) is the
later, grander, and, consequently, more
impressive work. With a vigor border-
ing on ferocity, Shafran attacked the
first movement, transforming its Vivace
into a full-blown Appassionato. Even
the curiously blues-like Adagio was
deftly stage managed to fit into Shaf-
ran’s broadly dramatic conception of
the sonata.
As tailpiece to the recital, Shafran
and his accompanist, his wife, Nina
Musinian, presented the intricate and
lyrical Debussy Sonata in D minor.
With the exception of some rather
harsh pizzicato passages, Shafran des-
patched the work in an attractively
spirited manner.

Human Sexual Response. William H.
Masters and Virginia E. Johnson.
Little, Brown and Company. $12.50.
J ONCE had a football coach who
used to gather all the players to-
gether in the centre of the ground on
Thursday nights and caution us “to
keep off sex between now and the
game on Saturday.” Whether the players
took this caution seriously once they
had been rubbed with eucalyptus, had
showered, and driven off into the dark
may be discovered only by some latter-
day Australian Kinsey, but it
was always surprising to see how earn-
estly this commission was received at
the time. It seemed that whatever the
kind and nature of individual practice
all were agreed that “pervicacious
gonadal activity” (to use the Masters-
Johnson words) robbed footballers of
vital match-winning energy.
History is, of course, full of sexual
fads and fallacies and eleven years ago
and a bit, William and Virginia decided
that sex had been going on far too long
without thorough scientific investigation;
they decided to set up the Reproductive
Biology Research Foundation in St.
Louis and look into things in a properly
quantified way.
They probed, they looked, they re-
corded, and they looked again; at most
imaginable varieties of sexual activity.
The result of these eleven hard years
of looking and measuring and looking
again is “Human Sexual Response,” a
solidly scientific work written only for
physiologists engaged in advanced re-
search, a work that has climbed to the
top of the American best-seller chart
in faster time than it takes to say:
“Therefore, the possibility of a pure
reflex-arc response to apparent stimula-
tion is reduced with the realisation
that psychogenic stimulation of the
higher cortical centres and the resultant
direct, efferent, transformer response in
the clitoris is an undeniable factor in
the sexual response of the human
female.”
The first problem the investigators
faced was that of procuring. Where
could they get subjects willing to re-
veal all and to perform in the labora-
tory? At first they thought that only
prostitutes would be willing and in the
20 months of research 118 female and
27 male prostitutes contributed “their
sociosexual, occupational, and medical
histories to the investigation.” But as
word went out about what mysteries
were being delved, and secrets probed,
in the Masters-Johnson laboratories
“volunteers of all ages came from all
social strata and from a wide variety
of education backgrounds.” So that over
the past seven years over 75 percent
of male and female study subjects
volunteered their services. The glory of
it all, as the authors explain to those
of us who read the book purely for
scientific purposes, is that “overt ex-
hibitionism” appeared to be an in-
significant factor in the motivation of
those who volunteered.
The measurements of true science,
like the path of true love, are not, alas,
always straight: and the reference to
love reminds me of something. No
doubt a book on human sexuality should
say something about such things as “the
labial response patterns for both nulli-
parous and multiparous women” even
if not in that kind of language; and
certainly “the observation of the pheno-
menon of preefaculatory testicular ele-
vation finally has provided adequate
explanation of the physiologic intent of
the well-established clinical entity of the
cremasteric reflex”; but running through
the chapters from “female extragenital
response” to “the scrotum” and “myo-
tonia” I felt that something had been
left out. Perhaps it’s not very im-
portant to science, but human beings
have feelings like tenderness, affection,
concern, pity, loyalty, infatuation, and
even love, as well as excitement phases,
sex-skin color changes, sweating pheno-
mena, second trimester responses, and
factile sensitivity of the perineum.
In other words for most of us
sexual activity involves our whole char-
acter and the attempt to isolate the
narrowly physical and sensate areas is
a distortion in both scientific and moral
terms. If it is to be done at all it
should be accompanied by constant
references to the inaccuracy and un-
wholesomeness of the process. Men
are not bundles of chemical reactions
and sexuality is not just a matter of a
stimulus - response pattern in nerve
endings.
Perhaps one could excuse the Masters-
Johnson approach if it actually dis-
covered much about its own highly
abstracted (that is the word) subject
matter. Unfortunately, after eleven
years probing and measuring, they have
come up with almost nothing that
probably all physiologists and most
adults knew anyway. The only finding
of much consequence is on page 57, if
you must read the book.
My advice is, .if you want to learn
about sex, learn it anywhere. But don’t
learn it in here. Perhaps this book is
for your physician; he may find it use-
ful. If he does, change your physician.

Britten’s Backwardness
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Britten. Imogen Holst. Faber. $3.60.
IMOGEN HOLST has been Benja-
min Britten’s assistant since 1952;
not surprisingly, this is a eulogy
rather than a biography. Regrettably,
she has felt it necessary to omit many
relevant facts of his life and work.
The Earl of Harewood goes unmen-
tioned here, although his assistance and
patronage, especially with Britten’s own
English Opera Group (formed to stage
Britten’s works) may be considered to
have changed the whole course of the
composer’s career, particularly after the
death of publisher Ralph Hawkes.
(There was even a ru,mor at one time
that Lord Harewood had sold an early
El Greco to continue financing the
Group.)
Similarly, the influence of Hawkes,
who, as he once told me personally,
actually “discovered” Britten and im-
mediately put Boosey and Hawkes be-
hind the young unknown, is barely
hinted at, while the uninitiated would
never guess the important part Britten’s
alter ego, Peter Pears, has played in his
life. The disaster of the Coronation
Opera “Gloriana” is passed over in
silence, and whatever happened to “Billy
Budd”? It does not even appear in the
index.
But, despite these flaws, I found the
book valuable for the few missing links
it supplies in the composer’s early stu-
dent days. Almost by default, Imogen
Holst uncovers a tragedy not simply of
Britten but of Britain, which the Euro-
peans of those days used to call the
“land without music.” If the establish-
ment of the ’thirties had deliberately
set out to clip the wings of genius before
it could fly, they could not have done
better. But, this was not their intention.
According to Imogen Holst’s account,
they did not even recognise that they
had anything outstanding on their
hands.
Britten studied composition at the
Royal College of Music under John
Ireland, who found his work no more
than “very industrious” and set him
elementary lessons at a standard which
Britten had passed years before as a
schoolboy under Frank Bridge. Not one
of his compositions was considered
worthy of being played by the Royal
College’s full student orchestra. This
was not a matter of finance; there was
a special fund to encourage young com-
posers of promise, and the works of
many mediocrities were performed.
The root of the tragedy was, of
course, that the Establishment was in-
capable of appreciating Britten’s talent
because England had for so long been
without internationally substantial com-
posers. Despite this, the nabobs seem to
have gone to some lengths to guard
him from “subversive” musical con-
tamination. Britten knew that vital
changes were going on in Europe and
seemed to feel instinctively that he
needed to learn more about them for
his own development, and so he tried
to get hold of a score of Schoenberg’s
“Pierrot Lunaire.” Although it was
written 20 years before, and was already
a classic of new music, it was not in the
college library and his request in the
suggestions book was turned down.
Every other attempt he made to dis-
cover more about contemporary music
was also scotched.
In his final year, Britten won a
scholarship to study abroad. Now his
chance seemed to have come and he
chose to take it up in Vienna with the
foremost contemporary composer, Alban
Berg. “But,” writes Imogen Holst, “for
some reason the authorities were against
it,” and again Britten was prevented
from going to Berg. The exact dates
are not given here, but this seems to
have been about 1933-34, which was the
time of the first British concert perfor-
mance of Berg’s shattering opera
“Wozzeck” by the BBC, which prob-
ably influenced Britten’s choice and
the others’ veto.
These few sentences, which the aver-
age reader might pass over without
realising their significance, reveal a
melancholy story. Britten put English
music back on the international map
for the first time since Purcell; but it is
still English music which is accepted
internationally as such, rather than in-
ternational music that happens to be
English. There is a world of difference
here, and that difference is probably the
result of the fact that in those impor-
tant formative years Britten was artifi-
cially kept away from what was to prove
the decisive mainstream of this century’s
composing: the twelve-tone system.
The young man, so uncompromising,
was forced to compromise. Instead of
writing “before his time” in the sense
of Debussy or Schoenberg, he only high-
lighted British music from ever differ-
ent angles. He tried to “turn the screw,”
but this very English implement refused
to turn full circle.
The key to the personality and there-
fore to the music of Britten lies in this
duality. He is a born nonconformist, a
fearless conscientious objector; he is not
Magic Carpet
Marvelling at what men crave, and the craft of men,
Myself no saint I watch their wiles begin
To weave a baseless carpet for their feet.
They want to fly, but, grounded in deceit,
Do not believe in magic; never dare trust
Truth will put them swiftly uppermost.
In the name of such succeeding, what, then, shall?
The clever tested scheming, casual,
Some violent variation of the theme
Composed for strings of getting-on: which seem,
For all attained tomorrows, precepts for today?
‘Life was like this before we came its way.’
And they rise, they rise, to the carpet wall-to-wall
Which, woven with guile and the fear of fall,
Sinks underfoot as anything shallow shall,
Not worth, because not even magical,
Their best self’s scrutiny too close or long;
They feel proud, and, ruthless, they feel wrong.
Somewhere they ceased to dream as once they did
And seized on circling middle plots instead,
The mean they spelled around themselves to screen
The dark ambition. What, then, would have been
Their end without the devious? Higher? Great?
Or gross among the powerless who hate?

afraid to speak out against cruelty to
animals where hunting is a sacred rite,
and was one of the first to see the bar-
barism of systematic bullying in English
boys’ schools. Yet his music, judged by
the standards of our time, has remained
conformist. The young composer who
was once burning to use today’s atonal
language has come to terms with yester-
day’s harmonies. Like Brahms, he is
not an innovator but a supplementer of
the past. The frustrated Berg disciple
now cries out against the modern artist
who writes “impractical” music which
is “only usable by highly skilled perfor-
mers and only understandable by the
most erudite.” (Britten’s “Cello Sym-
phony” and Stockhausen’s “Momente”
are approximately contemporary, but
50 years apart in style.) Yet he is also
quoted as stating that “great artists
have an uncomfortable habit of being
right about many things, long before
their time . . .” Britten, unfortunately,
has been looking backward; and he is
wrong.
Out of
the Box
By FRANK ROBERTS
Royal Foundation. Simon Raven. Blond.
$5.30.
“TT7HO wants to read?” the BBC
YY magazine “The Listener” asked
during Britain’s National Library
Week in March, noting that 26,000
titles were published each year in Eng-
land, but that many were instructional
and text books, and that the demand
for fiction continues to decline. “It may
well be that the middle class, which
used to sustain fiction writers, is be-
coming eroded between the tycoons who
still buy books to decorate their draw-
ing rooms and the television-viewing
masses.”
Further question: Who wants to read
a volume of eight TV and radio plays
by one man who has turned out nine
(one is left out, although listed on the
back cover) of Britain’s hundreds dur-
ing the past five years, and who is
partly damned in Maurice Richardson’s
introduction, in terms such as “his
construction is not very strong, as yet”?
Simon Raven’s five novels would have
shown “who” in their sales figures, but
as for who might want to read the
television plays, he has to beg the
question. In a preface to “Royal Foun-
dation” he says, “A Television Play is
liable to be seen, we are told, by more
people than ever witnessed a stage play
of Shakespeare’s during his entire life-
time. Even the audience for a Radio
Play can run into millions. Misleading
statistics, of course. All they mean is
that such and such a number of sets
were switched on; the audience might
have been occupied with anything from
tatting to copulation. And the next
morning the play is dead. Critics will
write it off in an easy paragraph, a few
letters, usually of ill-informed com-
plaint, will be received; even if people
have enjoyed the play, few of them will
trouble to say so, and even if they do,
the chances of its being repeated are
negligible, as the Unions will not allow
the recordings to be long preserved. The
fate of a Television Play is to be at
once forgotten—and for the most part
rightly so.”
All of this is worth quoting, for prob-
ably it expresses the feelings of many
television dramatists. Raven continues,
“No doubt this dictum (‘rightly so’)
applies to the plays in this volume as
much as to any others. And yet there
was a lot of work involved, a lot of
excitement at one time, a lot . . . even
... of love. Surely, one thinks, there
may be some insight here to please a
casual reader, some lessons to be learned
by an aspirant playwright, some felici-
ties of plot, character, or language that
may be worth preserving.”
I must disagree. Many writers of

ephemera must yearn to see it em-
balmed between hard covers, but few
TV writers have seen that happen, and
rightly so. Raven’s yearning ignores the
great advantage that a good play, acted
well enough to bring out those plot
felicities, character, or language, will
be at least partly preserved in some
viewers’ minds. In more, probably, than
will buy the book to remind them of
these plays, or to meet the author in
cold print without benefit of the powers
which helped him bring ideas and
dialogue to fruition in the television
medium.
So I wonder, not only who wants to
read a book of television and radio plays
from a very occasional playwright, but
will its publication add any lustre to
the list of 26,000 titles? Should anyone
bother to read “Royal Foundation and
other plays”? Raven’s aspirant play-
wright should, lacking an annual
Best TV Plays in Britain, as they have
in the U.S.A., in which a diversity of
dramatic thought and approach is on
tap. As far as I can recall only one
of the plays in Raven’s volume has been
seen in Australia, and that was “The
Scapegoat,” which was typical enough
of his work.
It is about the self-contained world
of the professional Army, as are four
of the eight plays. In this instance “a
quite ordinary revelation, that the regi-
mental goat has had its throat cut,
leads to a mildly scandalous discovery,
then in turn to another and even less
agreeable, and this in turn . . .” well,
to a Court of Inquiry presided over by
a Major, who at the end explains to
fellow officers that it “must find out
the facts, certainly; but for this reason
. . . that only when fully known can
they be effectively suppressed.”
Raven’s “let’s see what’s under the
stones” attitude runs through all but
one of the plays, “The High King’s
Tomb,” which he describes as “along
the lines of Buchan or Dornford Yates,”
and which was broadcast by BBC Sound.
The stones looked under include poli-
tics, politics in cricket, and society after
a nuclear war.
In summary, Raven’s laconic dialogue
and tight construction are admirably
suited to the times. His old-fashioned
principles and outlook, and his addiction
to “closed and snobbish communities,”
are less so. If you are interested in
reading plays, and plays laden with old
British atmosphere, Raven’s 445-page
book would be worth the money. Other-
wise the question, “Who wants to read?”
is well taken in this instance, when we
are threatened with a possible invasion
of hard-cover aspirants from another
dimension.
Solitary and Summer-dazed
Solitary and summer-dazed,
It seemed to us as children that
Our world was endlessly inland,
Locked up between the earth and sky
Drugged timeless by cicada sound.
The heat, that pressed us down to circle
Round the thirst of blazing days,
Spread sheep out straggling upon
The even bum of plains, and brought
A twist of snaking river through
The whispering and withered grass.
In bowls of sun we were contained,
Hemmed in by drought and fiercely
naked
Skies, so that the sea, whose deep
And soothing body we remembered
Seeing once and longed to sight
Again, we found we might discover
In the rusty yard, with tins
Of water ferried for the tides:
An ancient bath to keep the shores.
All day we worked at pouring oceans
Till we made a giant tide
Which overflowed the sides and spilled
out
Wide against the land that held us,
Crusoes, at the centre of
A continent of summer haze,
On which we floated, drifting raft-wise
Over paddocks with the backs
Of shorn white ewes for waves.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The Wrong Time
RIGHT now is the time for immediate stimulatory action
by the monetary authorities. But because it is August,
and therefore Budget time, we are going to get fiscal
measures instead. The sort of logic that prevents fiscal
measures like sales tax changes from taking place in mid-
term because of the calendar, and so often forces inappropri-
ate monetary solutions to fiscal problems, is now working
in the opposite direction.
It is true that the fiscal measures likely to be taken
in the coming Budget will help the economy along; but
it was the monetary brake that slowed the economy down
and it is the monetary brake that should be eased to get
it rolling again.
Mr. McMahon is being told what to do in next Tuesday’s
Budget by everyone from the ANZ Bank to the WWF and
most agree that some sort of stimulus through lower taxes
and higher pensions is needed. A case can be made out for
some social services increases, on economic as well as
humanitarian grounds, in an attempt to encourage the
flagging consumption levels that have been so dramatically
shown in falling retail sales and lower HP figures.
There also seems a case for chopping the extra 2£ percent
company tax that was added a couple of Budgets ago,
and increasing investment allowances, and there is scope
for some sales tax reductions on goods like motor-cars,
which have been suffering from sharply reduced sales. But
there are also good cases against these fiscal methods of
solving what looks at the present to be largely a monetary
problem, especially as fiscal measures must generally remain
in force for a year and the economic situation could
change in a much shorter time than that.
In a modern economy, it is the level of credit that
matters more than the supply of cash in spenders’ hands.
And monetary policy aims first at the level of credit,
while fiscal policy, through taxes and so on, affects the
amount of cash that people have or what things cost.
Businessmen make expansion decisions not so much on the
basis of the cash they have but more on what they can
raise and their prospects of servicing it—provided the
expansion is worth while in the first place. It is true that
lower company tax would in most instances mean higher
company plough-backs rather than higher dividends and
that, therefore, there would be more cash available for
restoring the flagging rate of private capital expenditure.
But companies will not invest in plant unless they can see
some use for it, so the first need is for some general stimulus
to the level of demand.
It is also true that sales tax reductions would stimulate
consumption to some extent by making things cheaper to
buy. But sales tax cuts would only chop 5 to 10 percent
off prices at the most and it seems unlikely that the reasons
for the fall in car sales are very closely related to the last
5 or 10 percent of their cost.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the main prob-
lem facing the Australian economy at present is not one
that should primarily be solved by fiscal measures. It is
a problem that is largely due to the successful use of
monetary policy as a dampening factor when it looked as if
the economy could get overheated. One of the monetary
measures used to slow it down was the high interest rate
policy, as part of a tighter-money situation, that diverted
more money out of private expenditure into governmental
MEN AND MATTERS
SIXTY - EIGHT - YEAR - OLD Sir
Isaac Wolfson and 65-year-old Sir
Frank Richardson have more in
common than a hope that the Ralli
Brothers “rescue operation” for the Cox
Bros, group will succeed, despite the
strong (and, it seems, very sensible)
opposition already aroused. Apart from
being good friends, these two retail
knights both began work in humble jobs
in the furniture trade, and both have
devoted a lot of their energies to
activities outside their businesses.
Sir Frank’s “outside” hobby for the
past 25 years or so seems to have been
advising the Government and sitting
on its commissions. Twenty years ago
he was the second-top man at the Dis-
posals Commission an experience
that cynics say has come in useful ever
since Cox Bros, began to contract its
operations by selling off Foy and Gib-
sons in Western Australia and disposing
of stores in N.S.W. and Victoria.
Probably his best-known govern-
mental job was as chairman of the
committee that produced the Richard-
son Report in 1959, recommending sub-
stantial salary and pension increases to
Members of Federal Parliament. Sir
Frank had a lot of political friends
even before that report he numbers
Sir Robert, Sir Artie, Harold, Arthur,
and the late Ben Chifley among his
friends. Schooled
at Kerang State
and High Schools
and All Saints
Grammar in Mel-
bourne and later
the University of
Tasmania, this
self-styled “self-
m a d e man”
started off as a
schoolteacher. But
in the 1920 s he
moved out into the business world
by entering the little Cox Bros.
Fitzroy store as a furniture salesman.
the depression came, Tie took
over its management and built
up what, by the end of the 19505, had
become one of Australia’s major retail
groups.
But times have changed in the 10
years since Sir Frank could spurn a $l4
million takeover offer for his group by
Waltons as “frivolous and vexatious”;
now he is urging support for a scheme
that will give 60 percent control of
Cox to Sir Isaac Wolfson’s Ralli mer-
chant banking group for only $2 mil-
lion and will involve a write-down
of $23.8 million in the face value of
Cox shares and debentures.
Sir I. Wolfson
Sir F. Richardson
J. Walton
Apart from being chairman of the
Great Universal Stores Ltd., Sir Isaac
(created a baronet in 1962) is known
for his philanthropy to the National
Playing Fields Fund, for cancer research
(he has huge “No Smoking” notices in
his office), for scientific research in
(and his general support for) Israel,
establishment of a chair of metallurgy
at Oxford University, and the Wolfson
foundation for the advancement of
health, education, and youth activities
in the U.K. and Commonwealth.
And what is Mr. John Walton saying
about it? Now relieved of most of
his refinancing problems by his partner-
ship with the First National City Bank
of New York in Waltons Credit Cor-
poration, Mr. Walton admits that there
are a few Cox-Foys stores he would like
to own; but only a few.


hands and helped keep the stock exchanges in the doldrums
because of comparable yield considerations.
There is no justification for the continuation of a high
interest rate policy. When this policy was developed, the
balance of payments position looked bad and the economy
was running at such a pitch that there were good arguments
for restraint. Now the trade balance is 'well-righted again
and should turn into a big surplus unless the spring rains
fail. Against this is the uncertainty of capital inflow, but
this should not be a factor in favor of continued restraint.
Indeed, internal restraint might perversely worsen our exter-
nal payments position. Capital inflow is attracted mostly
by the prospect of profitable business ventures, and high
interest rates contribute to the stagnation of business gener-
ally. In particular they threaten an already weak sector
of the economy business capital expenditure.
The economy has grown used over the past two years
to an extremely high level of spending on factories, offices,
plant and equipment. And this is healthy, for it is one
of the main bases for economic growth. But increasingly
there is not the market for extra capacity and so there
is the possibility of a major downturn. Lower interest
rates would help toward preventing this eventuality; though,
as Peter Samuel says on page 20, there is scope for the
Government to take budgetary action too. The Reserve
Bank has demonstrated its ability to operate flexibly on
the upswing. We now need a similar demonstration for
the downswing.
Drought Fears Again
WE could be in for another round of serious drought.
Unless a lot of urgently needed rain falls over most
of the N.S.W. wheat belt this month, the situation
will be desperate once again, the Department of Agriculture
told THE BULLETIN last week.
Hopes of a quick cash crop to solve their borrowing
problems prompted drought-stricken farmers to sow a record
acreage of wheat in New South Wales after rain came earlier
this year. But there have been hardly any falls since early
June and the crop, which has germinated well, urgently
needs rain this month.
The only wheat-growing areas which are in a reasonably
good position are in the south-east corner around Wagga,
Temora, and Albury.
Cumulative totals of the rainfall received since the
drought began in November, 1964, up to July, 1966, show
the western upper (Cobar) district as the worst-off area
of N.S.W., with rain only 43 percent of normal. In the wheat
country, the central western plains (Narromine, Warren)
have had only 54 percent of normal rainfall, north-western
plains (Moree, Walgett) 55 percent, north-western slopes
(Nundle, Tamworth) 56 percent, the northern tablelands
(Inverell, Glen Innes) and the central tablelands (Cowra,
Orange) both 62 percent, and the central western slopes
(Dubbo, Parkes) 63 percent of normal.
Productivity Teams
CONSIDERING our pressing need to thicken industrial
know-how, we seem to have been very slow in adopting
the idea of sending productivity teams to more
advanced industrialised countries. Even Britain, which has
always been way ahead of us on productivity, has exploited
it to great advantage since the war by sending productivity
teams to the United States. Up to now the importation
of industrial know-how into Australia has largely been an
individual effort by separate companies. So the com-
ing visit to Japan by what is to be called an industrial
audit team of fifteen company directors, under the auspices
of Industrial Audit Teams Ltd. which was formed last
year as a non-profit company, will be something of an
event.
Industrial auditing has nothing to do with financial
auditing. Its object is to evaluate what is happening
“on the spot” overseas by reviewing and appraising products,
processes and organisational procedures.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy S The Australian Copper Pro-
ducers’ Association jumped the domestic copper price
from $B7O to $1250 a ton, expressing concern “at the
continuous excessive exports of fabricated goods con-
taining copper.” The attraction of exporting “has arisen
from the substantial differential between the Association
price of $B7O a ton and the price on the London Metal
Exchange” ... Two days earlier, Mount Lyell Mining
had announced that its domestic copper sales would be
based on three months’ forward LME prices.
The six Australian motor-tyre makers increased tyre
prices by 5| percent, restoring them “to their 1955
level”; retreads go up by the same amount.
At June 30 the U.S. and Canadian dollar content
in Australia’s $1375m. overseas reserves comprised
$197m., or 14.3 percent, compared with $156.2m. or
11.5 percent at June 30, 1965 . . . The trading banks’
new and increased overdraft commitments averaged
s27m. a week in the five weeks to July 13, against
$23.6m. a week in the June period . . . Three months’
operations of the Farm Development Loan Fund saw
approved loans reach $4.2m.
Of the 4.6 m work force, about 146,500 have second
jobs.
For the marketsi Industrials are presenting a
rather drab front on Australian share markets, although
the week-by-week retreat is not particularly marked.
Leaders have become variable again, so do nothing very
positive to influence other stocks. A few of the latest
profits furnish a stimulus to action. Metals and oils
draw the limelight, yet trading among these sections
is quite selective.
Some observers believe London ready for a technical
rally, but a quiet drift continues on reduced volumes.
Retailers and papers have been strong . . . Extreme
caution distinguishes Wall Street. Buying disinterest has
spread through most of the list. Mild profit-taking
occurred after two days of advance.
For companies i A strong stomach is needed to
digest the latest proposals for saving retailer Cox Bros.
(Australia). If ordinary and preference shareholders and
debenture holders can be induced to approve a write-
down of their respective securities totalling $23.8m.,
London merchant banker Ralli Bros. (Bankers) Ltd.
will feed in s2m. equity capital, thus securing a post-
write-down 60 percent ordinary share interest to “exer-
cise only financial and advisory control.” Debenture
holders are being asked to wait up to 16 years for re-
payment of their reduced principal.
The climate for other overseas partnerships looked
variable . . . International monetary uncertainties per-
suaded Overseas Corporation (Aust.) and UK’s Midland
Aluminium to dispose of the nine percent interest they
obtained in each other in September, 1964 . . . Thomas
Nationwide Transport (TNT) and Transport Develop-
ment Group, of England, broke off takeover discussions
following repeated Reserve Bank disapproval . . . Success
came to The East Asiatic Co., of Denmark, which
secured a half interest in and board control of Harvest
Foods . . . Britain’s quality cigarette maker Alfred
Dunhill proposes to manufacture and market in Aus-
tralia through Rothmans (Aust.).
BHP’s debenture issue to share and debenture holders
will ask for a minimum s3om. and also accept slom.
oversubscription; interest rates are 6f percent for 10
years and seven percent for both 15 and 25 years . . .
In a further development BHP joins with Canada’s
Patino Mining (through Sydney Smelting Co.) and
O. T. Lempriere to link all Australia’s existing tin-
smelting operations together . . . On the fixed-interest
line once more, Australian Paper Manufacturers offers a


slom. issue of unsecured notes to its
share, note, and debenture holders
. . . An unspecified amount of deben-
tures is being raised by Lend Lease
Corporation from share and deben-
ture holders.
A prospectus for the long-expected
Cleveland Tin float should be avail-
able shortly . . . Stainless steel fabri-
cator Bell Bryant plans a two-for-
five issue of 50c ordinaries at par,
to raise $252,000.
Results from finance houses of
one form or another remain prom-
inent . . . The centenary year of the
Commercial Bank of Australia
yielded a 5 percent earnings advance
to $2,123,117 (helped by its 40 per-
cent holding in General Credits) and
a bonus two percent addition to the
ordinary dividend . . . Hire-purchase
house Custom Credit showed a 24.2
percent leap in profit to $2,991,386,
comfortably holding a 10 percent
dividend; receivables moved up
nearly s6m. to $ 178.3 m. . . . The
latest half-year of Lombard Aust.
gave a 50 percent profit improve-
ment, to $276,996 . . . Adelaide’s
Lensworth Finance pushed the year’s
earnings from $383,010 to $460,850,
retaining a 15 percent payout.
A day after fluttering the copper
price dovecotes (see For the Econ-
omy, above), Mount Lyell came to
light with a 165 percent profit jump
and dividend lifted all the way from
10 to 18 percent; earnings went from
$892,030 to $2,328,189 on top of
much higher tax . . . Not to be out-
done, tin miner Renison sent its
dividend from 10 to 15 percent on
profit up from $245,451 to $299,087
. . . On a foreshadowed profit de-
cline (in the event, by 24 percent to
$720,238), beach sand miner Associ-
ated Minerals put dividend up by 1
percent to 16 percent.
Hotelier Federal Hotels announced
2| percent dividend, the first since
1962-63, on a trading profit, to be
disclosed, in excess of last year’s . . .
Motelier Moteliers Ltd. overcame
competition and drought, advancing
profit by 23 percent to $145,073 and
holding the 11 percent dividend . . .
Food processor Consolidated Milk
Industries necessarily suffered from
the drought, as well as competition
in ice-cream; profit slipped to
$622,168, earning rate 11.5 percent,
the lowest since 1960-61 . . . Mel-
bourne cake maker Herbert Adams
increased profit slightly, by $2184 to
a peak $324,648; directors require
sl.Bm. for the new factory and will
soon anounce how they will raise
the funds.
Cotton spinner and weaver Davies,
Coop managed its first dividend for
seven years 4 percent; earnings
at $641,103, after tax up from
$36,400 to $552,625, represented 5.4
percent on capital . . . Wangaratta
Woollens’ profit moved up from
$256,014 to $388,189 and dividend
from 12i to 15 percent.

"If I had another feather I'd fly."
Ralli round the Flag
IT may be difficult even to imagine,
but if the Cox Bros, group were now
in a position where it was making
huge profits and shareholders were wax-
ing fat on 25 percent dividends, there
seems little likelihood of Sir Frank
Richardson and his share-holding fel-
low directors turning to debenture
holders and saying: “You people pro-
vided the company with almost double
the amount of money we shareholders
put in, and you have been content
with earning only 8 percent while we
have been getting 25 percent in divi-
dends. So we directors will hereby re-
ward you by doubling the face value
of your debentures, increasing your
interest rate by one percent, and giving
you the opportunity of cashing in your
stock in half the time you are com-
mitted for.”
It would not happen because it
could not happen. When people buy
debentures they are lending money at
fixed rates for fixed times on stated
security. They recognise that the price
of that security is in foregoing any
right to share in the profitability of the
company.
But having foregone that right to
make money, Cox debenture holders are
now being asked to give up their right
not to lose it. Now that things are bad
they are being asked to accept exactly
the opposite of the sort of situation
they would not have been invited to
enjoy in good times. This, even more
than the sale of a 60 percent interest
in the group for $2 million, is the most
staggering aspect of the arrangements
agreed between the board of Cox and
the U.K. merchant banker Ralli Bros.,
which Cox’s chairman, Sir Frank
Richardson, last week upgraded from
a “merciful deliverance” to “a miracle.”
W.A.'s Growth Demands
WESTERN AUSTRALIA’S gal-
loping growth must not be
allowed to slow down, despite
the threat of inflation, according to
economists at the University of Western
Australia. “Any such pause in the
State’s economic development would
not merely mean a postponement in
some rate of growth,” they say. “It
would be quite likely to set off a chain
reaction leading to temporary depres-
sion and reversal of growth. Continu-
ing annual inflow of capital seems to be
essential.”
With little likelihood of the Com-
monwealth providing this inflow, the
economists, in their latest “Economic
Activity” survey, conclude, “More and
more reliance for economic resources is
likely to be placed upon private enter-
prise.” But they also point to the in-
flationary problems. “Wage increases
appear now to be quite markedly out-
running increases in productivity. Their
future effect depends therefore upon
how far better methods of production
and organisation can be found that will
offset the consequences on wages of
pressure in the labor market.”

TRAVEL
How to Bring in Tourists
THE blunt statement made by Mr.
A. M. Wilson recently that “Aus-
tralia has developed a reputation
for treating tourists as ‘yet another evil
in a long working day’,” sums up many
of the points made very much more
politely by the report prepared recently
ior the Australian National Travel Asso-
ciation. Mr. Wilson, president of the
Australian Federation of Travel Agents,
made his comments at the Federation’s
annual conference at Surfers Paradise
and subsequently elaborated on them at
a Press conference in Sydney.
The ANTA report, prepared by
Harris, Kerr, Forster & Company and
Stanton Robbins & Co. Inc., of the
United States, was very polite in its
statements on how Australia treated its
tourists. But what many of the recom-
mendations made in the report boil
down to is that Australia must develop
a national consciousness of the value
and importance of the tourist trade and
must learn to treat tourism as a major
industry.
“Fet’s get our own house in order
first to welcome and cater for tourists
and at the same time promote strongly
overseas according to a carefully pre-
pared marketing plan,” is, in effect, what
the report said. The report adversely
commented on the national organisation
of the Australian tourist industry but
praised the efforts of individual State
and territory government tourist pro-
motion offices. It also recommended
higher commissions for travel agents.
is a long way from be-
ing a cheap tourist country. The
domestic airlines and coach companies
have failed so far to strike any special
rates for sightseeing tourists. Our
domestic airline fares are certainly lower
than those in the United States, but be-
cause of our vast distances the cost of
flying from Sydney to the Barrier Reef
and to Alice Springs is considerable.
The HKF report commented on the
need to make special provision for
fares for tourists. In the United States,
a number of airlines have created
special fares for overseas tourists which
enable travellers to see a large part of
the United States for some $U.5.250.
And both Greyhound and Continental
Trailways, the leading coach companies
in the United States, book overseas
tourists on their coaches for $99 for
99 days and they may travel anywdiere
on their network. Tourists must, of
Course, find their own accommodation
and meals.
But this is the kind of support which
the United States Travel Service has
been getting in its drive throughout
the world to attract more tourists.
The HKF report rightly stated that
the Commonwealth Government must
of necessity fulfil a major role in the
development of tourism for Australia.
It recommended various taxation con-
cessions, eligibility of the tourist indus-
try for Commonwealth Development
Bank loans, and that the travel and
tourist industry should be officially
recognised as qualified for the market
development allowances relating to
overseas promotion. This latter pro-
vision wmuld be welcomed by some of
the larger wholesale travel agencies
w-ith taxation problems and the kind
of experience and drive to promote
tourism overseas.
The tourist industry generally feels
the report was a careful study of the
problems Australia faces in bringing
more tourists here. It is obviously a
matter for the Federal Government
what practical effect the report will
have on the Australian tourist industry.
And the coming Budget, containing
as it will the current year’s subsidy for
the Australian National Tourist Asso-

So one of our passengers told us.
Of course, it’s all a matter of
taste. And taste is important.
Sufficiently important enough
for us to now serve Foster’s lager
on all BOAC flights out of
Australia. Cold. Along with the
best British beers. For those
who have a taste for them.
Which goes to prove a point.

ciation, which is expected to be higher,
will disclose the Government’s reaction
to the report. The Budget session will
also give Parliament its first oppor-
tunity to debate tourism.
One last point: There is going to
be a scramble if the report’s recom-
mendation that “Walkabout” magazine
should be published by an independ-
ent publishing company is imple-
mented. The question must be: Should
it go to the highest bidder or to the
company likely to produce the best
publication?
See India Cheaply
Devaluation of the Indian
rupee has made India a cheap
tourist country and this is the
flag India’s tourist promoters are now
flying high. The Indians are making
the most of this situation to bring in
foreign currency and are speeding up
their hotel building program to cater
for the expected greater number of
tourists.
A leading Indian travel agent, Mr.
Som Madhok, regional manager of
Mercury Travel (India) in Delhi, said
in Sydney last month that, for an out-
lay of $lOOO, an Australian could have
a three-week holiday, one week in
Singapore and Bangkok, and two weeks
in India with de-luxe accommodation.
Full board at a five-star, air-conditioned
hotel will now cost Australians $B.OO
a day with second-class hotels costing
$4.00.
Mr. Madhok said that he had left
sample itineraries for Australians for
stays of four days to two weeks with
an Australian tour wholesaler.
Mr. K. N. Kudesia, director of the
Indian Government Tourist Office in
Sydney, said the Indian Government
had started further development of five
tourist areas at Kovalam Beach, South
India; Goa, West India; Iljulmarg,
Kashmir, for winter sports; Ajanta-
Ellora (1000-year-old caves); and
Khajuraho (temples from 11th to 13th
century 8.C.). He added that 12 hotels
with a capacity of 1512 beds in 895
moms were now under construction in
various parts of India.
Red China Still Open
RED CHINA is not closed to
tourists after all. A report of
the closure of its frontier to
tourists hit last month’s travel agents
convention at Surfers Paradise and in-
terrupted some agents’ enjoyment of
extra convention proceedings. Reassur-
ance came from Mr. Neil Peters-Snow,
general sales manager of World Travel
Service, Melbourne, which is general
agent for Luxingshe, China’s inter-
national tourist service. He said that,
because of the shortage of guides, the
“go it alone” tourist has been banned
during the peak of the season but
scheduled tours are unaffected.
Three hundred tourists will visit
China this year. Foreign exchange is
obviously too important to the Chinese
Communists to ring down the Bamboo
Curtain on all its visitors.


WILD CAT
PAGES
With Plenty of Money and...
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
THE money hunt is on again. The
amount of new share, debenture,
and note issues coming up in the
next few months is getting pretty large
once more and should provide some
attractive opportunities for investment.
So far the list is not anything like
as big as last year’s, and is not enough
to limit the scope for a general market
rise by syphoning off too much inves-
tors’ money. But some of these issues
are big and appealing. BHP deben-
tures, APM notes, share issues from
Coles, Permewan Wright, Peters W.A.,
Goliath Cement, Allied Mills, Swift,
and Associated Securities should arouse
plenty of investment interest, and for
those with older-fashioned tastes in
security there is the large Woolworths
Properties preference issue.
This is one instance where it may
suit the market that private capital in-
vestment is being held back, otherwise
investors would be inundated with
opportunities to spend their limited
funds and prices could well suffer. And
at present the indications seem to be
that things are picking up a little in
the markets and not only in oil.
THERE are certain to be more com-
panics added to the already im-
pressive list of money-raisers.
One of them is Schweppes, whose
directors are still deciding how to
raise the cash they need.
The local chairman, Sir Rupert
Clark, and the managing director, Mr.
R. A. Delohery, have not commented
since their recent return from Britain
0 n the U.K. Government’s refusal to
allow the Schweppes U.K. parent com-
pany to take up its entitlement to a
proposed (but unspecified) rights issue
by the Australian company. There is
plenty of room in the accounts for a
“domestic” loan raising from share-
holders along the lines of BHP’s, but
there is also plenty of scope for the
U.K. company to allow its rights en-
titlement to a share issue to be taken up
by the local market on the CRA pat-
tern, as the U.K. parent owns 68 per-
cent of the capital,
i n any event) nex t month’s inevit-
ably higher profit announcement should
be accompanied by a further dividend
r i se to at least 12 percent (if only for
decimal reasons) to maintain the pat-
tern 0 f one percent rises in recent
years
'VTOT all new issues prospects are
finding market favor. Despite the
new issue which Herbert Adams’
*?- 8 million expansion program implies,
the market is ta tng t e cen s ares
f Jpfi n P ncm S em
around $l.lO to yield 6 percent,
Last week’s steady profit, following
rises in sales and capacity (as a result
of expansion), does not augur very well
for the future.
In addition, last week’s profit state-
ment made little mention of the prob-
lems which the company is fighting in
N.S.W.; the interim report had said
N.S.W. development was continuing
slowly and there were certain un-
resolved problems. The annual report
may provide more information.
With earning rate now only 17.4
percent and dividend at 12| percent,
a dividend cut to around the 10 percent
level seems possible in the event of
any new capital raising, unless earnings
improve significantly.
THE BHP-Patino-Lempriere tin-
smelting proposal is excellent
news for O. T. Lempriere share-
holders, who had faced a profit down-
turn this year due to lower tin prices
and the prospect of possible mounting
competition in tin smelting if one were
put in at Renison.
The plan for Lempriere to sell its
recently modernised Alexandria tin
smelter to the new partnership still
leaves it in a strong position in metals,
as the company has long been an alloy
producer, is an antimony miner and
refiner, is in lead, diamond core bits,
and has recently been expanding sig-
nificantly into the scrap-metal business.
Lempriere’s rival, Sydney Smelting, is
owned by the Patino group and the new
company will apparently no longer use
this works for tin, for it plans to buy
only “certain” of its plant, although it
proposes that additional smelting
capacity will be installed at Lemprieres.
The merits of linking users, smelters,
and refiners of tin in one operation
have clear benefits all around. The
sooner the market knows the price
Lempriere gets for its tin smelter and
its capital contribution to the partner-
ship the better; whatever it is, the
shares have taken on a much greater
appeal.
THE British Tobacco investigation
into the possibility of opening up
a brewery in competition with
the monopolistic Carlton and United
group in Melbourne is not the first
time this tobacco and food company
has considered adding the third part
of its statistical subsection to its
activities.
Soon after the tobacco group began
its splashy diversification into food, the
possibility of challenging the Swan
Brewery’s mighty position in Western
Australia was investigated. At that
stage one of British Tobacco’s sub-
sidiaries was the State’s oldest trading
concern, Lionel Samson and Sons,
wholesale grocers, wines and spirits
The Chartist says:
COLONIAL SUGAR REFINING could be considered by both medium and
long term investors. The chart on this particular stock from 1960 suggests
a cyclical rather than a growth situation. It can be readily seen that an
upward trend at a rate of approximately 30 percent per annum was achieved
for nearly two years, culminating in a top formation in 1964. A subsequent fall
to a low point of $2.58 was recorded in September, 1965. A substantial base
pattern has now formed and investors could expect the stock to rise to about the
$4,20 level eventually. Considerable resistance selling would be encountered here
from the previous top formations of 1961 and 1964. A strong rise would be
likely once the resistance level at $3.25 is broken on high volume. Last sale
price on 5/8/66 —■ $3.00.

Hotels owmer of four hotels. This
company’s managing director, Tony
Samson, had strengthened rumors by
visiting a number of the world’s lead-
ing breweries. However, this line of
speculation petered out with the recent
re-acquisition by the Samson family of
their old firm, severing the British To-
bacco cord.
Whether or not British Tobacco have
abandoned, with the Lionel Samson
shareholding, any plans to brew their
own lager in the West is certainly up
in the air at the moment. Ken Dick-
son, president of the State’s Soft Drink
Manufacturers’ Association and man-
aging director of AFD subsidiary Coca
Cola Bottlers (Perth) Pty. Ltd., says he
thought the parent company was in-
terested at one time, “but it was hit on
the head, as far as I know, for the
whole of Australia.”
But perhaps not, for a British
Tobacco spokesman has confirmed that
a Victorian survey had been under-
taken into the beer business, with no
decision yet made.
BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
When to Buy Prestige
THIS year is likely to see the fourth
consecutive fall in earning rate
by the Prestige group, yet there
is plenty to suggest that the 50 cent
shares in Prestige Ltd. look worth buy-
ing; the question is “when”? With
profits “significantly” down so far this
year, “unbridled” competition, and
consumer demand “at a low ebb,” the
stockmarket is being very cautious in-
deed about Prestige.
But for all the gloom spread by the
chairman at last month’s annual meet-
ing, one vital point emerged; even if
the company continues to do as badly
for the rest of the year to March 31,
1967, as it did in the three months to
June 30, 1966, it would still earn more
than enough to cover dividend require-
ments. And while things are still very
tough in this trade (and in most that
depend on consumer spending) the
prospects are that business should get
better.
In the meantime there is an eight
percent dividend yield and a price
earnings ratio of less than seven is
available from Prestige at prices
around 78c, which seems near the bot-
tom of their cycle.
Last December’s purchase of two
clothing companies, Heathermoor and
Brandella, of Carlton, Victoria, follow-
ing the Holeproof purchase two years
before, has brought Prestige’s manufac-
turing strength to nine mills in and
around Melbourne, the major decen-
tralised weaving mill at Ararat, a
lingerie factory at Horsham, and a
small clothing factory in rented
premises in Sydney. For management
and marketing purposes, Prestige and
Holeproof are still separate entities.
In addition, the Holeproof merger,
which almost doubled Prestige’s scale
of operations, has broadened its posi-
tion in the textile trade. Holeproof’s
emphasis on the consumer-goods mar-
ket has reduced the relative significance
of the semi-raw material and servicing
divisions (commission dyeing, finishing,
knitting, and processing), which make
up more than 60 percent of Prestige’s
own turnover and which have been
subject to some pressure from imports.
But this now appears to be the major
growth area, particularly if the group
can capture more end-users.
Things have been very tough in
hosiery lately, but, to some extent,
Prestige’s problem is that it is simply
being beaten in a straight-out fight
for the female market by Kolotex and
the rejuvenated Kayser group, who,
between them, now seem to have close
to half the female stocking business
in Australia.
The volume increase in group sales
in 1965-66 was much greater than
indicated by the 1.3 percent increase to
$29.7 million in sales value (excluding
the newly acquired Heathermoor/
Brandella companies and Victoria Knit-
wear in N.Z.), as selling prices were
materially lower on average. Also ex-
penses rose by almost $2 million, and
this year wages alone are expected to
rise by $300,000.
Last year working profit slipped 6
percent, but slightly higher depreciation
and tax (after investment allowance of
$100,000) meant an 18 percent slide
in net profit from $ 1,153,000 to
$945,000. Average capital was increased
by the one-for-five issue of 50c shares
at 30c premium in September, 1965.
The new shares ranked for half the
final dividend, so the dividend com-
mitment (including preference divi-
dend) went up from $516,000 to
$540,000. This year it will be $601,000'
if the percent dividend (paid for
the last four years) is maintained, as
directors confidently expect.
Prestige has been spending heavily
on expansion, the net expenditure on
fixed assets was $2,280,000, compared
with $574,000 in the preceding year.
This covered installation of new spin-
ning equipment to enable Johnson
Bros, to offer a needed service in spun
acrylics. (In 1964-65 Johnson’s profit
was down because the local market for
processed continuous filament yarn was
over-supplied.) The company is anxious
to exploit opportunities for expansion
provided by the growing demand for
synthetics.
There was an increase in the pro-
prietorship ratio in 1965-66, due to the-
share issue, plough-back of profits, and
sale of N.Z. shares and Holeproof’s-

Last year’s interest burden of
$344,000 (1965 $313,000) will not be
affected much by the company’s cur-
rently raising sl.2m. in 7f percent un-

maturing. This will improve the current
ratio.
Accounts receivable were up by
$1,235,000 to ssm. Excluding debtors
of new subsidiaries, the increase is 10
percent, which has necessitated a con-
siderable increase in provision for bad
and doubtful debts (unspecified in
amount) and is a commentary on the
lengths to which Prestige must go to
hold custom at the present time. Like-
wise group stocks have increased 10
percent to sB.3m. but, excluding the new
subsidiaries again, the ratio between
stocks and sales is the same, so there is
no cause for concern.
Holeproof’s contribution to group
profit was smaller than in 1964-65,
despite the inclusion of three months'
profits from Heathermoor/Brandella.
Operations profit after tax was $706,000,
7 percent down on the $759,000 in 1965.
Holeproof accounted for 43 percent of
group sales with a record sl3m. Sales
and selling prices on women’s hosiery
were lower and so were sales of men’s
shirts. Concentration of hosiery produc-
tion in Melbourne, following the sale of
the Rydalmere outfit, should produce
economies this year.
A fresh departure will be Holeproof's
launching of men’s grooming aids
(shaving lotions, etc.) under the Raft
brand. These will bt made in Mel-
bourne. The new subsidiaries, Heather-
moor and Brandella, have already added
ladies’ knitwear, school socks and pull-
overs, and children’s fashion outerwear
to the product range.

COMMODITIES
Copper Supplies Easier
COPPER’S troubles are far from
over, but at least one old-
established bugbear of the industry
—Chilean strikes—appears to have lost
some of its former potency.
Admittedly, the 35 percent wage lift
reported to be the basis of Anaconda
Co.’s counter-offer to its miners may
appear sufficient to win any union to a
peaceable line. But, allowing for Chile’s
high rate of inflation, the increase is
much less in real terms.
And, more important, in the past,
union leaders have been more interested
in overthrowing the moderate-socialist
Government than in being “reasonable.’’
More wage contracts have yet to be
negotiated and while, so far, all is going
considerably better than in the past, a
strike at some stage is not unlikely.
Meanwhile, the Rhodesian situation
is the main short-term factor for copper.
There much depends on the U.K.
Government’s decision on requests by
U.K. fabricators to pay hard currency
to the rebel regime. For the Zambians
have neatly passed the problem to Mr.
Wilson by allowing their copper pro-
ducers to ship through Rhodesia—-pro-
vided that the customer pays all freight
costs from the Zambian border.
British users are the main market for
Zambian metal. LME traders have evi-
dently decided that Britain’s need for
copper will outweigh other considera-
tions in the Government’s decision.
Once again, however, the calm view
taken of events that would at one time
have led to near-hysteria on the floor
of the London Metal Exchange under-
lines the basic supply situation. Here,,
too, a long-term factor is involved, not
merely the temporary U.K. economic
squeeze.
Not only in Europe is the supply
position easier but even in the U.S.,
with Vietnam soaking up output, some
are now forecasting an improvement in
the near future. The latest figures show
that in June the U.S. fabricating in-
dustry’s deficit the amount of extra
copper needed to meet working stocks
and sales contracts on hand fell,
The gap for the month was down 6000
tons to 176,000 tons. This is still very
large, and compares with 94,000 tons
a year earlier.
The trend is important especially
for markets, and more especially if
current supplies are not as tight as some
observers have said. The deficit has risen
steadily for most of this year. In
January it stood at 92,000 tons. It then
rose by between 20,000 and 30,000 tons
in the following months. The rise
slowed, only gaining 3000 tons in May.
Then in June the gap actually narrowed,
Substitution continues rapidly, with
the domestic electric wiring field being
rapidly penetrated by aluminium in the
U.K. The aluminium and plastics pro-
ducers must have been gratified to see
the break in the Australian producers’
ranks last week, involving as it does
not only higher prices but a two-price
market. However justified on the
grounds of high mining costs, such a
move must add to the pressures for sub-
stitution, and when supply and demand
return to balance the lost consumption
will be missed. It will be missed especi-
ally by those miners who have neither
long-term contracts nor a degree or
customer goodwill.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Drought Clearly Hits Profits
Winchcombe Carson's variable dividends
IN terms of wool sales and capital
employed, Elder Smith and Dalgety
& N.Z. Loan are very much larger
than any of the other listed pastoral
finance companies. Winchcombe Carson
Ltd. is probably the next largest, but
its wool sales in 1964/5 were only one-
third of Dalgetys’ Australian sales and
its capital employed was only just over
one-tenth of Dalgetys’. The shares are
selling below par ($0.92) to give a divi-
dend yield of 6.5 percent and an earn-
ings yield based on 1964/5 earnings of
10.9 percent (price/earnings multiple
9.2).
Probably this price means that the
shares are not priced very differently
from the two leaders. This can only be
described as surprising since, from
Winchcombe’s geographical distribution
of activities, it is likely that it will be
affected far more than the leaders by
the current drought.
The price of Winchcombe’s shares has
varied between 96 cents and 72 cents
during 1966 and the interim report did
little to increase confidence. That por-
tion of the report dealing with the com-
pany’s profit reads as follows: “The
severe conditions of drought throughout
New South Wales and Queensland dur-
ing the past six months are reflected in
greatly reduced sales of wool and live-
stock, and a corresponding reduction in
profit compared with the similar period
the previous year.” The words which
are the most discouraging are “greatly
reduced” in relation to sales of wool
and livestock and “corresponding re-
duction” in reference to the net profit.
Last year, earnings (after adjustment
for convertible notes) represented a re-
turn of only ten percent on capital—a
fall of 18 percent on the previous year —
and one must assume that a similar
decline could occur again this 1965/6
year. In this event the earning rate
will be only 8.2 percent and this would
mean that the market is prepared to
pay 11.2 times earnings for the shares.
The published accounts give fair de-
tail, but the profit on trading is shown
“after allowing for bad debts.” It
must be assumed that bad debts are
written off as they occur and that the
“provision against advances” is more
of a reserve than a provision. While
this does not affect the amount of the
disclosed profit, it would suggest that
shareholders’ funds should have totalled
$12,772,000 at June 30, 1965, rather
than the $12,112,000 shown in the pub-
lished accounts.
The anual report does, however, lack
the great detail of the annual reports
of Elders and Dalgetys. Each year, the
number of bales of wool and the
numbers of sheep and lambs and cattle
and calves sold are quoted in the direc-
tor’s report, but, so far as I can see,
monetary values have been given in one
year only. This was the 75th anni-
versary year, 1964, and it is possible to
build up some figures in much the same
form as those given by Dalgetys and
Elders:
Per £ of Total Assets
(Liabilities)
Advances and other debtors 12/5
Premises, plant, etc. 6/3
Shareholders' funds (including
convertible notes) 10/7
Secured loans
Bank credit 5/8
Clients' accounts, deposits and
trade creditors 3/3
Provisions 6d.
It is rather interesting to note that
over a three-year period to June 30,
1965, “advances” have increased by
20 percent, but it is quite likely that
the value of wool sold over the same
period increased by almost exactly the
same percentage. In the three-year
period to June 30, 1964, the value of
wool sold could have increased by over
54 percent, but it seems that “advances”
only increased by about 24 per-
cent. It is apparent that the level
of advances has little to do with the
value of wool sold.
'YyiNCHCOMBE achieved the peak
of its profitability (according to
published figures) in 1963/4, when
earnings increased at the annual average
rate of 30 percent per annum.
One could have thought that this sort
of growth rate might have produced
rather higher share prices in 1963/4, but
it is fairly apparent that the shares have
never sold at better than 14 times earn-
ings, whereas Dalgetys sold at one time
at nearly 18 times earnings, although
Elders never seem to have sold at more
than 12J times earnings.
The analysis of the balance sheet
structure shows that Winchcombe is
very heavily invested in “premises,
plant, etc.,” in comparison with the
two leaders and also that it has about
the same percentage in “advances” as
has Elders. On the liabilities side, the
bank seems to have been rather kinder
to Winchcombe than it has been to the
two larger companies. The figures are
as follows:
$ MILLION
1960/1 1963/4
Wool n.a. n.a.
Produce n.a. n.a.
Livestock and land n.a. 33 0
Merchandise 1.2 4.9
Insurance n.a. n.a.
These figures are too sparse to be of
much value from an analytical view-
point. They were apparently quoted in
the annual report for 1963/4 to give
some idea of the growth that has taken
place in the various departments. For
example, merchandise sales seem to
have increased from £618,381 to
£2,455,986 in the three years from
1960/1 to 1963/4 — an annual growth
rate of over 100 percent per annum!
Sales of properties increased at an
average annual rate of 32 percent over
the same period and it would seem that,
over a five-year period, sales of live-
stock at auction increased at an average
annual rate of about nine percent. Over
the three-year period (1960/1 to
1963/4) net profit before tax, deprecia-
tion, and interest on long-term debt
were close to $760,000; unfortunately,
we cannot tell whether this figure was
exceeded prior to 1961/2 because details
of profit were not given in the same
form. All that can be noted is that the
dividend rate reached its peak in 1959/
60, when the ten percent rate was main-
tained after a one-for-four bonus issue
as at July 1, 1959. Since this time the
dividend rate has fluctuated between
six percent and nine percent; con-
sequently even the dividend yield must
be regarded as variable.
Nevertheless, it is perhaps worth
noting that the company has never paid
less than six percent in the past 37
years, so it may well be that, while an
improvement in the rate cannot be ex-
pected this year, the company will make
every effort to increase the rate as soon
as conditions in the country areas of
New South Wales return to normal.

MINING
Growth in the Coal Industry
DESPITE the growing public
awareness of the value to the
Australian economy of the tre-
mendous developments in the mineral
industry, coupled with commercial dis-
coveries of oil and natural gas, it seems
that the by no means unspectacular
developments in the coal industry in
recent years have tended to be over-
looked. Black coal remains the prin-
cipal primary source of energy in Aus-
tralia and the latest review of the
Australian mineral industry by the
Bureau of Mineral Resources puts into
perspective its contribution to the
mineral industry as a whole.
The BMR figures show that the
ex-mine value of coal production in
1965 exceeded that of any other
mineral or fuel, amounting to $162
million or 30 percent of the total Aus-
tralian mine output worth $538 million.
In 1964 the value of coal production
was $146 million out of a total mine
output of $492 million. Black coal
production, which accounts for over
four-fifths of this total, recorded an
increase from 27.4 million tons to
around 31 million tons over the same
period. This compares with levels of
around 20 million tons per annum ten
years ago. Production figures in 1966
are running at even higher levels.
These increases in production have
been brought about partly by intensive
mechanisation of the industry, thereby
reducing operating costs, improving the
quality of the end product and lower-
ing prices. At the same time, profound
changes in the structure of the industry
have occurred with the closing of many
small, inefficient mines and the open-
ing of new large-scale, highly
mechanised underground and open-cut
mines, together with changes in owner-
ship, resulting in the emergence of
new powerful groups such as the U.S.-
owned Ludwig group.
ir pHIS increase in productivity has fol-
lowed a general world pattern of
development in the coal industry. It
has been essential in the face of grow-
ing competition from other sources of
primary energy, principally petroleum
products, which have made heavy in-
roads into traditional coal markets,
especially the railways, town gas pro-
ducers, ships’ bunkers, and the general
industrial fuel market. Since 1954,
black coal’s share of the primary energy
market has decreased from 54 percent
to approximately 37 percent in 1965.
However, in terms of overall pro-
duction, the decreasing demand from
the above-mentioned markets has been
more than offset by increased demand
from the iron and steel industries, for
electricity generation and more recently
by rapidly growing export markets,
principally in Japan. Further growth in
these markets seems assured at least in
the foreseeable future.
The demand for coke from the iron
and steel industry has increased more
than 40 percent over the past decade
and further increases have been fore-
cast. Consumption of coking coal for
the iron and steel industry in New
South Wales amounted to 5.9 million
tons in 1964/65 (almost all supplies
being met by the “captive” mines
owned by the BHP group). The,Coal
Utilisation Research Committee has
estimated that this figure will rise to
7.8 million tons by 1970/71; further
estimates have been made that the 1975
demand will be in the order of 10
million tons.
These trends seem even more prob-
able in view of increasing future demand
from the new Whyalla and Kwinana
steelworks. In actual fact BHP has ex-
pressed concern at the ability of the
black coal industry to supply future
requirements. Fuel oil is already be-
ing used to supplement coke in blast
furnaces, but in the absence of some
future fundamental technological
change, it seems unlikely that the
demand for coking coal from this in-
dustry will be supplanted.
The second growing market for black
coal is in the field of electricity gener-
ation. In fact, in the country as a
whole, it consumes more coal than any
other market. It is estimated that the
demand for electric power is growing
at the rate of 10 percent per annum
and the Coal Utilisation Research Com-
mittee has estimated that coal con-
sumption by this market will amount
to nearly 11 million tons by 1970/71.
Coal’s position as a source of power
for electricity generation has been
strengthened by the siting of new large
power stations on coalfields to elimin-
ate transport costs and make coal the
cheapest source of fuel on a cost per
therm basis. In New South Wales
power stations have been built on the
southern coalfield (Tallawarra), western
coalfield (Wallerawang), and northern
coalfield (Wangi and Vales Point, with
two further stations, Munmorah and
Liddell, scheduled for completion in
1967 and 1971 respectively). In Queens-
land, the Swanbank, Collinsville, and
Calcap power stations are all being-
built on coalfields. Liddell will be
the largest power station in Australia
and it alone will consume about 5 mil-
lion tons of coal per annum when fully
operative.
Judging by world experience, it
seems likely that black coal at the
pithead will remain the cheapest form
of thermal energy available in Aus-
tralia. Competition could come from
hydro-electric power (but this is neces-
sarily limited by rainfall and geography)
or by discoveries of large quantities of
natural gas close to centres of popula-
tion. Further into the future, nuclear
power could pose a serious threat, but
experience so far in Britain and the
U.S.A. has shown that coal is still the
leader in power generation. The Joint
Coal Board has said that it does not
anticipate a threat from nuclear power
to coalfields-sited power stations.
The third major source of growth in
black coal consumption has been in
overseas export markets, which have ex-
panded rapidly in recent years. Since
1961, when exports totalled 2.85 mil-
lion tons (f.o.b. value, $23 million), the
total tonnage exported has risen to 6.06
million (f.o.b. value, $51.2 million) in
1964/65 and 7.6 million (f.o.b. value
nearly $63 million) in 1965/66.
The Bureau of Mineral Resources
has estimated that by 1970 black coal
exports will be earning some $lOO mil-
lion for Australia. On the basis of
1965 prices this will represent the third
highest source of mineral export earn-
ings; only exports of iron ore estimated
at $l5O million and combined export
earnings of lead, zinc, and silver at $l4O
million being higher.
'J'HE most significant factor in the
growth in coal exports has been the
increasing demand from the Japanese
iron and steel industries, which are
undergoing expansion plans involving a
200 percent increase in steel output and
a 250 percent increase in pig iron pro-
duction between 1960 and 1970. The
Japanese iron and steel industry is
dependent on imports for over 50 per-
cent of its requirements.
The Japan Iron and Steel Federation
has estimated that imports of coking
coal will rise from 14.7 million tons
in 1965 to 22.6 million tons in 1970,
of which it estimates that Australia
will supply some 12.2 million tons. Aus-
tralian producers in New South Wales
and Queensland have already con-
tracted to sell some 60 million tons of
coking coal to Japan over the next 13
years. As forecast, exports will in-
crease as certain of these projects come
into full operation within the next
couple of years.
On the basis of the above discus-
sion, it seems that the position of the
black coal industry in the primary
energy market is likely to meet further
challenges from petroleum products and
probably natural gas in certain tradi-
tional markets, mainly the railways, ship-
ping, town gas manufacture, and the
general industrial market. Its prospects
in the foreseeable future are assured in
view of the highly competitive position
it holds in the growing iron and steel
industries and in the field of electricity
generation. A further boost to pros-
pects will be provided by growing
exports, but the inherent dangers of
reliance on virtually a single market
are obvious.
(Next week prospects of some of the
major listed companies in the industry
will be discussed.)

The Re-equipment Race
UP 'DOWN, FLYING AROUND
By MICHAEL BAUME
The Short Skyvan
ERAS are always ending in the air-
lines business; it is part of the
public relations image of “new”
“fast” “jet” flying, where it takes
longer to drive 10 miles to the airport
than to fly 600 miles interstate. But
next week an Australian era is quietly
ending when the last piston engine
makes a regular flight on a passenger
route for the interstate operators,
Ansett-ANA and TAA.
After sixty years of service, pistons
have already departed from most major
passenger airlines around the world,
and the propellers on prop-jets (that
were so new only a decade or so ago)
are also on the way out. Australian air-
lines are set to go all jet (even though
there is some disagreement about the
speed of the change) and they are
spending millions of dollars doing so.
But it is money well spent. Not only
do jets encourage more business by
moving more people more quietly,
more comfortably and far more
quickly but each jet aircraft can do
many more income-earning trips per
day because of their speed.
So buying all these new aircraft does
not explain the latest pressure from
the airlines for a three percent rise in
fares. The bigger jet planes and their
greater efficiencies have in fact enabled
the airlines to absorb most of the rises
in operating costs that have followed
increased wages and taxes, particularly
on aviation fuel, and changed deprecia-
tion allowances, about which Mr.
Ansett is none too pleased.
r pHERE will still be propellers around
for a few years in Australia, but
mainly on freight runs. And then, when
the local airlines are all jet, there will
come another round of re-equipment
with the Jumbo Jets and supersonics to
maintain the pattern of dramatic change
in airline equipment that makes this
industry such a competitive one and
which explains much of the thinking
behind the Australian two-airline
system which, by its orderly buying
arrangements, prevents the sort of re-
equipment races that could send one
operator to the brink of bankruptcy—
again.
Next week in a carefully planned
coincidence, the two rival interstate
operators will at the same time on the
same day introduce their fourth (and
final) Boeing 727 on to their main
routes, increasing the number of pure
jet flights between Sydney and Mel-
bourne to eight a day from each line,
with the remainder being serviced by
the prop-jet Electras that had been the
frontline plane before the Boeing. These
Electras are quite a bit faster than the
Viscount 800 s they are replacing as
“second liners.”
The Viscount 800 s will move down to
nudge the older and slower Viscount
700 s either to the saleroom or to replace
the few DC6B piston engine passenger
aircraft that are still around —and which
are being completely phased out of ser-
vice over the next six weeks.
The changes will mean that this
month the Perth service will become
the first pure jet one in Australia. But
it will take another two years before
there won’t be a propeller on a passen-
ger plane doing the Sydney-Melbourne
run. This delay in going pure jet is
due to changed delivery times for the
DC9s that are on order, as the Ansett
group has succeeded in defeating TAA’s
move to have the last three planes that
each operator ordered delivered, as
originally agreed, in August, October,
and November, 1967. Instead, their de-
livery date has been put off to Novem-
ber, 1967, November, 1968, and August,
1969—the last one almost two years
later than TAA would like.
Nevertheless, the coming into service
here next January of the first two of
the six 90-seater DC9 jets each operator
has ordered will still be a major step
toward getting rid of propellers. This
will spark off another aircraft disposal
sale that will be climaxed in 1969-70
with the departure of the Electras after
ten years’ service, during six of which
they were the main passenger-carrying
vehicle on the trunk routes.
The first of these DC9/30s, which
have shorter take-offs and more power-
ful engines than the DC9/10s now in
service, will come off production lines
this month. Ansett will get the second
and TAA the third. Naturally they will
both start work on the same day and
at the same time and on the same
route, but in the meantime will be
used for pilot training in the U.S.
All this means that the local air-
lines are in the midst of a colossal
spending spree. Each Boeing 727 costs
about $6.5 million with spares, which
cost millions; each DC9 costs about
$3.7 million.
In addition, the Ansett group are
getting another seven Fokker Friend-
ships for intrastate routes, of which
five will be QCs, “Quick Change” air-
craft, that can be converted into freight
carriers in 30 minutes. This is one
instance of Ansetts stealing a march
on TAA, whose first QC will not be
delivered until next year.
TAA is also adding a Boeing, six
DC9s, and some Fokkers to its fleet,
and next month it will introduce two
new De Havilland Twin Otters as a
first phase of a “comprehensive re-
equipment program” for Papua-New
Guinea. The Ansett Skyvan versus
TAA Twin Otter is the only example
of competitive aircraft on similar
routes in the two airlines system, which
stipulates similar equipment, so that
competition does not usually extend to
aircraft types.
In any event, both operators appear
to agree in broad terms about the way
their equipment hierarchy should stand.
The pattern as outlined by Ansett is
a three-tiered one of Boeing 727 s cap-
able of flying 2000 miles in one hop;
DC9s with a 500 to 700 mile range;
and Fokker Friendships on the shorter
routes. Eventually the Fokkers will give
way to pure jets on some services
where either a shorter version of a
BACIII or a Fokker F2B may be
used.
The British had hoped to sell their
BACIII for the interstate routes, but
the American DC9s were preferred by
the local airlines for the job mainly
because they also have Pratt and
Whitney jet engines, and this makes
for substantial economies in servicing.
This question of engine uniformity is
a major one in re-equipment decisions,
as the capital costs of holding spares
(let alone training technicians) are
enormous.
There are more changes looming.
Long term, TAA is looking at such
possibilities as a “stretched” 727, adding
another 20 feet and an extra 30 passen-

carry three times as many pas-
sengers as the 707.

a cruising speed around the 550 mph

the top surfaces of specially built-up
structures within cities, over such areas
as railway marshalling yards.
Qantas is in the midst of a series of
significant re-equipment decisions which
are among the most important in its

history; even more so than its excellent
decision ten years ago to order smaller,
quicker-delivered Boeing 707 s to get it
a 12-month jet advantage on Australian
routes over its rivals.
It faces the problems of mounting
international competition and de-
cisions on supersonics. But Qantas has
a long way to go before it moves into'
supersonics. There are still five of the
present series of the 140-seater Boeing
707/338c aircraft to be delivered, and
a further six are planned to lift the
Qantas Boeing fleet to 30. After 1968
the airline will probably decide on its
attitude to the “Jumbo” jets that are
planned to carry up to 500 passengers
and which could be flying in four
years’ time.
On the supersonic question, Oantas
has ordered the British-French Con-
corde and also reserved places for the
.yet unnamed U.S. aircraft. So far, 54
Concordes have been ordered by 12
airlines, including Qantas, although
Captain R. J. Ritchie, the deputy
general manager of Qantas, said last
month that airline opinion had not
been consistently favorable toward the
Concorde. Some, including several who
placed orders, consider it too small and
its operating economics doubtful; there
is little space for mail and freight and
fares would have to rise about ten per-
cent, although the greatly reduced
flight time could be worth it.
rpHE Concorde is a fairly small plane
by modern standards, carrying only
120 passengers over 3500 miles at 1200
mph (M 2.2) and having a total pay-
load of about 25,0001 b. The first pro-
totype is due to fly in about 18 months,
and will cost about $l7 million. First
deliveries are planned for 1971.
The U.S. Government has not yet
decided which of two companies
Lockheed or Boeing will get the
contract to build an American super-
sonic jet, nor which engine maker
General Electric or Pratt and Whitney
will power it. Development so far
has cost more than $2OO million, of
which the Government has paid out
75 percent, which it expects to get back
from sales. Next month the U.S.
authorities begin to evaluate the con-
tenders and expect to make a decision
in January. So first prototypes could be
flying by 1970, with deliveries in 1974
three to four years after the Con-
corde. But it will carry twice as many
passengers, will be 400 mph faster, have
a range 500 miles more, a payload
15,0001 b. greater, giving it greater mail
and freight carrying potential and
will cost twice as much.
The Boeing and Lockheed designs
are radically different, with the Lock-
heed looking like a bigger version of
the Concorde, but the Boeing having a
“variable geometry” or moving wing
design which changes for take-off and
cruising. All will have sound problems
breaking the sound barrier is a noisy,
business for people nearby and these
aircraft will have to travel where this
does not matter.


REPLY ON MARGARINE
The Place of Local Edible Oils
By R. C. CREBBIN
IN his article on'“The New Margarine-
Butter War” (8., July 30), Mr.
Peter Samuel concluded that “the
(table margarine) quotas will have to
be increased quickly to the present level
of margarine sales, or else an intoler-
able wartime-like situation will arise.”
He also said that “there is something
distinctly authoritarian about the pro-
duction restrictions to which margarine
producers are subjected.”
I would agree with the latter state-
ment entirely, while reaffirming my
company’s belief that the principles of
the freedom of choice for Australian
consumers and of the need for freedom
for Australian edible oilseeds growers
to sell their products to one of their
biggest potential markets in the
manufacture of margarine demand
not an extension of the quotas but their
abolition, in respect of table margarine
made from entirely Australian raw
materials. This is now an entirely
practical aim, which my company
would fully accept and which had al-
ready been accepted in the old Queens-
land Dairy Industry Act between 1940
and 1957.
On the basis of the statements quoted
above from his article, I would conclude
that Mr. Samuel has reached reason-
able conclusions but in so far as he
is correct in them he is right for the
wrong reasons.
ir pHESE are some of the points made
in his article which surely cannot
go unchallenged:
1. Mr. Samuel talks of “the injection
of huge . amounts of money and the
full-scale mobilisation of the heavy
public relations industry.”
The truth is that my company is not
spending substantially in excess of
budgeted amounts for advertising. In-
stead, there has been a diversion of
advertising budgets from consumer
budgets to our current “Mrs. Jones”
messages, which are, after all, concerned
with the whole future of our company
and the whole future of its 3000
employees. Virtually the entire load
of public relations works, such as it is,
has been handled by the executives of
my company.
2. Mr. Samuel says that: “The impli-
cation that the raw materials for
margarine are now predominantly Aus-
tralian is quite mistaken.”
Speaking for my own company, I
repeat that until the end of June this
year all margarines manufactured by
Marrickville Margarine Pty. Ltd. con-
tained an average content of Australian
raw materials in excess of 90 percent.
“Miracle” poly-unsaturated table mar-
garine contained 100 percent Australian
raw materials. Since the end of June
the average Australian content has
fallen away, as a result of the exhaus-
tion of local supplies of safflower oil,
hit by the last year’s drought, which
also hit hard many other grain crops.
However, my company has placed an
order for 1,500,000 gallons of safflower
oil for delivery from the forthcoming
safflower crop due November of this
year, and this will enable us to return
to earlier high levels of Australian con-
tent and possibly even to exceed them
over the whole range of our margarines.
In his article it seemed to me that
Mr. Samuel may have been assuming
that the only Australian raw materials
used in margarine manufactured by my
company are edible vegetable oils. The
truth is, of course, that a most important
locally produced raw material, in terms
of volume, in the manufacture of the
whole range of our margarines is beef
oleo. That is why the large volume of
imports of vegetable oils, as compared
with production of locally grown edible
vegetable oils, in 1964-65 was no true
indication of the average Australian
content of margarines manufactured by
my company.
3. Mr. Samuel says that “the pro-
duction of cottonseed oil is therefore
obviously controlled by the market for
lint, and will not be influenced one way
or the other by the demands of the
margarine industry.” He also says that
within three or four ye-ars cotton pro-
duction is expected to reach self-
sufficiency.
(As Mr. Samuel says, we are
currently at about two-thirds self-
sufficiency, so that a rise of some 50
percent in output is in prospect, on his
calculations, over the next three or four
years.)
During 1966 there will be harvested
in Australia sufficient cotton to yield an
oil equivalent of approximately 6500
tons. A rise of 50 percent in cotton pro-
duction over the next three or four
years will, therefore, bring cotton pro-
duction up to a level sufficient to yield
a volume of cottonseed oil of the order
of 9000-10,000 tons. As for the import-
ance of outlets for this great volume of
cottonseed oil in margarine production,
I believe that these outlets will prove
very much more important than Mr.
Samuel conceded. The decline in the
level of subsidy per bale of cotton lint
will make the money they will receive
from the sale of the by-product cotton-
seed more and more important to the
growers of cotton.
As Mr. B. G. Dawson, the chairman
of the Namoi Cotton Co-operative and
managing director of the Australian and
American Development Co. Pty. Ltd.,
of Merah North, New South Wales, and
himself an important leader in the cot-
ton industry, said in a statement on
June 8 this year:
“Public statements have been made
by Federal Ministers that from the end
of the current bounty period in 1968
cotton growers cannot expect to receive
such (bounty) assistance in the domestic
market —Sve must be prepared to pro-
duce raw cotton at the then existing
level of world prices, whatever that
may be. If this is indeed to be the case,
then Governments, both State and
Federal, should remove the restrictions
on the domestic demand for an im-
portant by-product, cottonseed oil, at
present imposed by quota restrictions
on the production of table margarine.
“If these quotas were removed, cotton
growers would feel confident that they
could plan to develop their own cotton-
seed crushing industry in the certain
knowledge that they had before them
the prospect of expanding sales to a
rapidly growing table margarine in-
dustry.”
4. Talking of the safflower industry,
Mr. Samuel says that “there can
justifiably be a deal of scepticism about
how long production (of safflower)
will last at this (the present) level.”
Mr. Samuel’s figures of safflower pro-
duction and acreage have mystified
me. In a table in his article, he
quotes 1966-67 safflower oil produc-
tion as only 4000 tons but gives an
acreage estimate of 150,000 acres for the
forthcoming safflower crop. I can only
believe he thinks there is going to be a
disastrously low yield from this year’s
safflower crop. Reliable trade sources
estimate the likely yield from the
100,000 acres or more to be planted
this season at some 10,000 tons of
safflower oil equivalent.
M r. SAMUEL goes on to quote Pro-
fessor J. R. McMillan in support of
his scepticism about the future of saf-
flower as a crop. May I also quote
from a recent public statement, in re-
buttal of Professor McMillan, made
by Mr. Peter Leech, general manager of
Pacific Safflower (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.,
which company has pioneered the grow-
ing of safflower in this country. In
his statement of July 21, Mr. Leech
said, inter alia:
“Growers should not be misled by
Professor McMillan’s warning about
safflower growing. The professor said
that three factors limited the develop-
ment of this crop: sensitivity to frost,
the yield and oil content are greatly
affected by lack of rainfall at a critical
period, and under irrigation it is liable
to phytophthera root-rot. I am at a
loss to understand why Professor Mc-
Millan feels obliged to warn growers.
“Nobody is bullying them into grow-
ing safflower. Every one of the points
he makes is made known to growers in
our company’s technical booklet, which
is given to all growers interested in
this crop.
“The professor is actually quoting
yields of bushels per acre without giving
the acreage planted in each year. His

“ASK YOUR

The Federated Pharmaceutical Service Guild of Australia
uses this phrase to promote Pharmacy and its services.
It’s a simple and reasonable idea: that your family chemist
is the logical person from whom to buy medicines, cosmetics
and similar items.
Guild TV commercials are as simple and reasonable as this
idea.
They begin with John Royle announcing that “This is a
community service announcement” and end with “ask your
family chemist he knows”.
That’s been the message for the last two years.
How effective are Guild commercials?

19.6 bushels/acre in 1961-62 were actu-
ally 9.6 bushels/acre, jumping to 15.8
bushels with the advent of the Gila
variety in 1962-63, 15.2 bushels,' in
1963-64, 14.8 bushels in 1964-65.
“Alongside these increases in yields
were the fantastic growth of acreages
planted: in 1961-62, 8952 acres; in
1962-63, 5694 acres; in 1963-64, 18,730
acres; in 1964-65, 49,498 acres; and in
1965- 72,719 acres. The figures speak
for themselves.”
Mr. Samuel also went on to say, in
respect of safflower, that: “People in
Primary Industry in Canberra (presum-
ably he does mean the Department of
Primary Industry) also speak of it
(safflower) as an experimental crop, not
established as a plant that pays.”
This report by Mr. Samuel of the
views of the Department of Primary
Industry in Canberra is difficult to
square with the statement made in
publication of the same Department of
Primary Industry, “Report on the Vege-
table Oilseeds Industry in Australia
(1964),” in which it was said that:
“The increased acreage planted to
safflower in Queensland during the
last two seasons indicated growing
popularity of the crop, and provided
the prices are at least maintained and
research and varietal development con-
tinue prospects for further substantial
expansion appear very good.”
In sum, we can look to a rise in
domestic production of edible vege-
table oils to some 20,000 tons a year in
a very short period of time. During
1966- the availability of locally
grown edible oils will rise to more
than 18,000 tons as against the 1965
availability of some 5000 tons. There
is only limited scope for this growth
of domestic output to replace imports.
Of the 37,000 tons of imports of vege-
table oils currently entering the
country, only some 24,000 tons are in
any real technical or economic sense
replaceable by domestic supplies. What
is more, the figure of 24,000 tons in-
cludes some 5000 tons of mandatory
imports of peanut oil. Hence, the true
figure of “replaceable” imports of
edible vegetable oils is less than 20,000
tons. This is very close to the 1966-67
expected availability of oils from dom-
estic output.
5. Mr. Samuel says that: “Another
unjustified claim by margarine pro-
ducers is that regulations on the com-
position of cooking and industrial mar-
garines hold back the use of vegetable
oils r
Surely an economist of Mr. Samuel’s
standing would not deny margarine
manufacturers the opportunity of mak-
ing an attempt to develop a market for
industrial and cooking margarines con-
taining higher proportions of vegetable
oils than is presently permitted by law.
Does Mr. Samuel believe that we should
not, in a competitive economy, be
allowed at least the right to develop
this market? There must be few other
products in the Australian market today
whose ingredients are controlled by
law, simply for the purpose of protect-
ing one set of producers against another.
6. Mr. Samuel says that: “The
dairying industry gets protection of the
order of 15 percent through subsidy and
about the same amount through the
two-price scheme ■, so it is fair to say
heaVily p, °-
This issue of «he relative degree of
S ,1 ,h Se< ? aS C -° m '
pared with the dairy industry is a
complicated one as Mr. Samuel would
no doubt agree. The effective protection
to safflower growers is probably no
more than the ad valorem duty of
nornont Tkn *• * **
33 percent. The protection to cotton
growers m so far as that protection
extends to cottonseed, is probably con-
siderably greater than the ad valorem
duty of about 25 percent on imported
cottonseed oil. In fact, the effective
protection to cottonseed oil, after tak-
ing account of the subsidy on cotton
lint, may be in the range 60-70 per-
cent. As for the effective protection on
peanut oil, made from local culls, that
is also probably markedly higher than
the ad valorem duty of 25 percent on
imported peanut oil would suggest. It
may also be of the order of 70 percent.
As for butter, it has been calculated
by the Deputy Director of the Bureau
of Agricultural Economics, Mr. S. F.
Harris, in an article in the December
1964, issue of the Australian Journal
of Agricultural Economics, that the
effective rate of protection on butter
is about 73 percent
. In “ “ ** benefits

most highly protected, indeed
coddled, primary industry in Australia
today. It is all the more disappointing,
therefore, that an economist of Mr.
Samuel’s standing should lend his name
to arguments which must hinder the
necessary process of reform and in-
crease in competition for the dairy-
ing industry.
AGRISEARCH
The Proper Use of "Super"
TO reduce costs, more and more
farmers are buying their super-
phosphate in bulk and having it
spread by contractors. Most of these
operators use “spinner” machines,
which function best when the super
being fed into them is relatively coarse-
grained. To satisfy the contractors’
requirements, the manfacturers of
superphosphate are making a coarser
product. Unfortunately, this does rtot
coincide with the farmers’ best interests.
Mr. B. C. Muir, the agricultural
officer at Ballarat, Victoria, has
announced the results of an experiment
in which he compared the effect of
fine- and coarse-grained super on the
growth of annual pasture. He found
that after an autumn topdressing the
pasture made better early growth when
fine rather than coarse super had been
applied. The difference in yield dis-
appeared during the spring flush, but,
of course, it is in late autumn and
winter that animal production is
limited by the feed supply and greater
pasture growth at this time of the year
has a premium value.
The quicker response from fine
super is due to its greater number of
particles, and hence there is a higher
concentration of them per square unit
of soil surface when the fertiliser has
been broadcast. In other words, the
average distance between a plant and
a grain of super is less than when the
fertiliser is in a relatively granular
form. There is strong evidence from
other studies that the phosphorus
absorbed by plants when they are very-
young has a much greater effect on
total yield than phosphorus taken up
later. Mr. Muir considers that the best
compromise between the farmers*
interests and the contractors’ would be
reached if the average particle of super-
phosphate measured one-tenth of an
inch in diameter. Using material of this
dimension, the spreader truck should
make traverses of the paddock no
wider than twelve yards apart.
With the price of phosphatic fertiliser
rising up $7.50 per ton within the
last year and likely to go much higher
yet as the deposits on the Pacific
islands peter out —its rough and ready
use in Australian agriculture will have
to give way to more precise and selec-
tive methods of application. But studies
on the practical use of fertiliser do not
win Ph.D.s these days, nor do scientists
get paid for doing such work at any-
thing like the earnings drawn by those
who engage in the more fanciful flights
or “pure science.” This is a pity, be-
cause applied research on this subject
could still win for the farmer magnifi-
cent economic benefits.
In the U.S.A., where intellectual
snobbery is not such a cult as it is
here, plant nutritionists have found that
considerable savings on the fertiliser
bill can be made in certain circum-
stances by such practices as soaking the
seed in a phosphorus solution before
planting. Farmers over there on soils

may be distributed at relatively wide
spacing. Cereal and horticultural crop-
pers also need a great deal more infor-
mation about the best ways of apply-
ing fertilisers. Again, overseas farmers
can be much better advised. They know
whether to apply the fertiliser with the
seed, beside it, or below it, depending
on the crop being sown, the time of
the year, and the type of soil.
And they have machines which per-
mit the accurate placement and frugal
use of fertiliser. Perhaps our modern
drills have improved, but the combines
of thirty years ago delivered fertiliser
with a variation of up to 11 percent
between the individual hoes. Moreover,
the variation along any individual row
was shockingly high. Thus, in one
recorded trial when the machine was
set to deliver 931 b. per acre, the actual
rate of application along the row varied
from as little as 171 b. to 3221 b. per acre.
Clearly, some of the seed planted along
this row would have fallen where there
was no fertiliser and other seed would
have dropped where there was so much
that the tender seedling would prob-
ably have been damaged by the high
concentration of phosphorus.
JN view of the pervading importance
of phosphatic fertiliser in Aus-
tralian agriculture, it is amazing that
not a single, comprehensive booklet
setting out our present state of know-
ledge of the subject exists for farmers.
Quite by chance your writer came
across a recent CSIRO Bulletin (No.
284) entitled, “Phosphorus Fertiliser
Research in Australia.” It is a most im-
pressive work, and it would scarcely be
an extravagance to remark that it could
be the most valuable statement about
practical agriculture ever published by
that august organisation.
Unfortunately, it is not written or
published in a style that would appeal
to many farmers, and is apparently
intended for digestion by agricultural
specialists. Its author is E. A. Jack-
son, of the Agricultural Liaison Unit,
CSIRO. However, his present address
is given as the International Rice Re-
search Institute, Manila Hotel, Manila,
The Philippines. It is to be hoped that
Jackson has been sent on a well-earned
vacation and not that he has joined
the “brain drain,” down which float
those more competent scientists who
become fed up with their circum-
stances here. Farmers prepared to
tackle some moderately heavy read-
ing should write for a copy. They will
be well rewarded.
Guide to Weeds
EASILY the best book about weeds
to be published in this country is
now available. Its author is
G. R. W. Meadly, M.Sc., who has
entitled the book “Weeds of Western
Australia.” However, all or almost all
of the weeds discussed occur in the
eastern States also. Besides, chapters
are included which deal with the
general principles and methods of weed
control. The Western Australia Depart-

A total of 37 major weeds is des-
cribed in non-technical language with
brief, but adequate, notes on their
occurrence, significance, and control.
Good botanical drawings and a full-
color photograph complete the descrip-
tion of each weed, so that no one need
have any difficulty in identifying a sus-
pect plant. The reproduction of the
color photographs, incidentally, is a
tribute to the Western Australia
Government Printer. His standard is
one that other State printers could emu-
late.
The annual economic loss due to
weeds reaches almost mythical propor-
tions. For instance, it was estimated
recently that weeds cost the animal
industries of Australia at least $lOO mil-
lion each year. The charge against
crop farmers could easily be greater.
But while farmers and graziers are
most concerned by weeds, home gar-
deners, curators of parks and playing
fields, and the custodians of public
lands and waterways are also seriously
troubled by the weed problem. All
these people would also find this a
helpful book which would equip them
to enter the war against weeds more
effectively.

What About Dual Listing?
A difference between minings and industrials
MOST Australians know of the P.' & O. Company, with its big, booming
ships, yet very few would realise that its shares are listed on the Sydney
Stock Exchange. And what’s more, with a paid capital of $46m., it’s
one of the largest companies on the list. Mind you, there’s been no sale of the
preference shares for the last couple of years and a sale in the deferred shares
has yet to be notched up in 1966.
While laboring this subject of listed
companies, I have some difficulty un-
derstanding why Peko Wallsend is stuck
in the middle of the industrial market.
If this company can be construed as
an industrial stock (it does have a
road transport subsidiary), then where
does New Guinea Goldfields stand?
Its timber and trading activities are as
important as the gold-mining side of
the business. The optimist who has
been taking out all those call options
on New Guinea Goldfields probably
thinks they also own Goldfields House
down at Circular Quay!
The solution to the listing problem
is, of course, to list this stock in both
the mining and the industrial markets.
That would be a real challenge to the
arbitrage men.
One way you can tell the difference
between a mining share and an industrial
share is that one shoots up in price
while the other struggles to hold its
own. Peko and New Guinea Gold fall
into the first group.
So does Western Titanium. From a
low of 95 cents this year, the contribut-
ing shares are now selling at $1.30. This
may seem an abnormal rise, but com-
pare it with the share prices of some
other beach-sands producers Consoli-
dated Rutile from a low of 75c to $1.55
now and Westraiian from 30c to 47c.
A planned expansion program is
classically illustrated by the increase in
production of salable minerals
1964, 113,000 tons; 1965, 153,000 tons;
1966, 184,000 tons. Helped by firm
prices, profits have shown an even more
spectacular rise— 1964, $196,000; 1965,
$396,00*0; 1966, $645,000. Although the
dividend per share in 1966 of 7.5 cents
was double that in 1965, the dividend
commitment represented less than half
of the profit. With this impressive
array of past figures, you can add the
prospect of production capacity rising
to 250,000 tons this year.
It would be wrong to pass over
Western Titanium without mentioning
the research program the company has
been conducting in conjunction with
the Laporte Company. The CSIRO
and the Western Australian Government
Chemical Laboratories have also lent
their assistance. If successful, their
combined efforts will result in a superior
grade beneficiated ilmenite being pro-
duced that will meet the demands of a
- very much wider market.
If there is anything holding back
the Western Titanium market, it is
the large parcel of shares held by Aber-
foyle. Ever since Aberfoyle directors
refused to pay a dividend last year, I’ve
been wary of their actions. Even tak-
ing this into consideration, I’m happy
to buy back into Western Titanium at
$1.30.
Despite what I said earlier about
industrial shares, there are always some
opportunities in that side of the market.
Steel Mills would seem to be a case.
After a testing time in 1962, when
BHP barged in and cruelled their
business, Steel Mills’ directors had to
look around for something else to do.
Best thing that ever happened to the
company!
T OW it’s one of the major manufac-
turers of steel mesh in N.S.W. In
achieving this position, profits have
been steadily increased to the point
where earning rate last year was up to
18 percent. With profits up “substan-
tially” in the first half of the 1965-66
year, earning rate looks like exceeding
20 percent this time.
In view of this, why were the shares
suddenly knocked down from 80c to
72c? My answer to this situation was
to buy 500 shares. Even a pick-up to
last week’s price would mean a $25
profit.
So much for the profits one hopes
to make. Much more to the point is
to look at actual profits and the one
this week was $65 on Western Mining.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
200 Western Mining $5.08 $995
BOUGHT
400 Western Titanium $1.30 $531
500 Steel Mills .72 $369
The account still shows a debit of
$356.

But the middle-price 125 makes business sense
The more closely you look into it, the more clearly you see
that the Hawker Siddeley 125 is the business jet that strikes a
realistic balance between speed, size and price.
The 125’s more expensive competitors can give superfluous
passenger accommodation and entail considerably higher
operating costs. Less expensive business jets have either
lower performance or lack passenger comfort.
The 125 is a jet airliner in miniature, seating six to eight
passengers in comfort, and carrying them over 1,000-mile
stages in little over two hours. Designed to take a full range
of modern navigational aids, the 125 can operate from small
airfields or the world’s busiest airports. It gives you complete
freedom from airline timetables, and flies at jet speeds high
above the weather.
The 125 is built by Hawker Siddeley—the only manufacturer
with experience of building both business aircraft and pure
jet airliners. Its Viper engines, built by Bristol Siddeley, are
backed by ten years’ solid experience gained in military training
aircraft —acknowledged to be the toughest proving ground
for any power plant.
An appraisal of all business jets will show you that the 125
makes the best business sense. If you would like to study its
finer points in more detail, please write for the brochure that
takes you on a conducted tour of the 125.

Omega Seamaster de Ville: the elegant, slender timepiece that is also a high-preciston-sports watch. Movement winds itself. Case seals out water
and dust. Calendar changes automatically at midnight. As illustrated? In iS ct. gold, $290 (£145). 14 ct. gold capped, $l6O (£80).
Stainless steel, $l3O (£65). Other Seamaster de Ville models from $B5 (£42.10.0).
This Omega Seamaster de Ville is actually four watches in one,
outmoding ordinary, single-function watches
1. A sturdy sports watch, for outdoor and beach wear
2. A dependable calendar watch, for up-to-date accuracy in business
3. A slim, elegant dress watch, for formal occasions
4. A self-winding precision watch . . . you set it and forget it
Omega has designed the Seamaster de
Ville specially for the man who leads
a full, active life. By using new tech-
niques it has been possible to combine
the rugged dependability of a sports
watch with the slim elegance of a watch-
about-town. And this has been done
without sacrificing one precious second of
fabulous Omega accuracy.
So now, with the Seamaster de Ville,
you have a watch that is right for every
occasion.
This great advance is due to a remark-
able new, one-piece watch-case, which
has no detachable back and is therefore
much slimmer. Inside it Omega crafts-
men have been able to place not only
the strong, shock-protected, high-
precision movement, but also a self-
winding mechanism and automatic
calendar.
The elegant Seamaster de Ville is a
triumph of watchmaking ingenuity, a
worthy addition to the renowned range
of accurate Omega timepieces. It will
keep good time in each of your three
busy lives and it may well stay with you
for all of them.
And, wherever you may live, wherever
you may travel, you will find Omega
Service close at hand.
The Omega Service Network, staffed by
factory-trained experts, is spread over
156 countries. The Omega one-year
International Guarantee is honoured in
all of these countries, regardless of where
you bought your watch.
Some day you, too, will own an Omega.
