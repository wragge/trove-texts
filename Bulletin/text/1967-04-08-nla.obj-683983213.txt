are regular customers. This is why Carrier packaged air conditioning units
find their way into so many shops, offices, restaurants and work rooms.
Here’s why!
A Carrier packaged unit is big enough to control temperature and humidity
in places too large for a small air conditioner. Yet it’s compact so you
can tuck it discreetly away in a corner, standing on its own base. One of
the Carrier range of packaged units the 50K8, 50K10, the new 50K14 or
the 50K16 is exactly right for your premises. It will run so quietly
you’ll never know it's there. And in winter it looks after heating too . . .

Multi-purpose
THE MOST LUDICROUS episode in
the long and painful history of the
Sydney Opera House is surely the confi-
dent announcement by the chairman of
the N.S.W. Milk Board that a “firm
booking” had been made of the whole
place Major Hall, Minor Hall,
Drama Theatre, Chamber Music
Theatre, and Cinema for a dairy
conference in 1970.
As there is as yet no manager for
the Opera House, we assume the “firm
booking,” if it exists, is an arrange-
ment between the dairymen and the
Country Party Minister for Works,
Mr. Davis Hughes.
We don’t know how the ABC feels
at the prospect of losing the Main Hall,
so recently gained, in mid-season dur-
ing what may be the Opera House’s
first year in operation. Perhaps the
ABC, recalling the ease with which the
butter interests have defeated the claims
of the margarine people, might now
study the reverberation times for milk
bottles.
Development
IT IS to be hoped that the first step
taken by the Federal Treasurer’s new
baby, the Bankers Development Re-
finance Corporation, aimed to secure
more Australian equity in Australian
development, will not be to fling up
20-storey buildings in each of the capi-
tal cities. Putting up expensive office
buildings seems to be about the limit
of development thinking for some local
lending bodies.
Rich and poor
POPE PAUL’S Easter encyclical on
poverty was a moving and interesting
document, interesting partly because he
constantly stressed the obligations of
rich nations to poor rather than the
random benevolence of the rich man
to the poor. It rejected completely the
comfortable theory that “charity be-
gins at home,” that our obligations
to humanity are fulfilled by buying an
occasional button at the bus stopi, or,
in the case of the Pope’s co-religion-
ists, perhaps by doing a little to help
the local parish school.
Taking care of everything
WHILE hunting for an address re-
cently, we read down the list of ten-
ants of a small near-city building. It
ran, Foldaboat Company of Australia,
Gala Garage Company, Viceroy Vaults
(N.S.W.) Pty. Ltd., and seems to just
about sum up the Australian aspiration.

Low fuel costs, too, and all fully automatic,
even the economical oil burner—that’s what
Gilbarco Central “Whole House” Heating means

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Doing the
right thing
by Ned
EVEN IF IT sounded like a gathering
of the Ned Kelly Fan Club it was
a most fascinating get-together. This
Ned Kelly school, right in the heart of
the Kelly country, was the child of the
Wangaratta Adult Education Centre.
We had such distinguished historians
as Professor Manning Clark and Weston
Bate. We had Professor Louis Waller
from Monash, Glen Tomasetti, the folk
singer, and, of course, we had lan Jones.
Utterly devoted Kelly enthusiasts came
all the way from Kings Cross, from
Melbourne, and from the very heart
of Glenrowan.
One would hear little bits of Kelly-
upmanship, which went something like
this:
First expert: I don’t think you are
right. In point of fact, this is clearly
laid down in the Kelly Royal Commis-
sion report of 1881, clause 10218.
Second expert: Maybe, but then you
would surely know that was very nicely
answered in Clause 1082.
Oh yes, one needed to be nimble on
one’s feet.
First expert: Kelly’s favorite drink
was whisky or perhaps an occasional
porter.
Second expert: Ah, yes, but it was
very interesting that he requested a
bottle of claret with his last meal.
Wine-lovers everywhere appreciated
this information. We were utterly
steeped in Kelly lore. We inspected the
Kelly country, we stood in the dock
at Beechworth Court House, where he
was sentenced several times, gazed upon
his old habitat, Beechworth Gaol, looked
at the Kelly musical, “The Long Drop,”
by Peter Clarke, and attended the
launching of “Plundering Sons,” by
Tom Prior, Bill Wannan, and H. Nunn.
The Adult Education Centre arranged
a magnificent collection of Kelly relics,
including two suits of Kelly armor and
Ned’s original .31 cal. cap and ball
pistol. An American has offered $2OOO
for it. It is so precious that Sgt. Keith
Holland, of the Victorian Police Public
Relations, slept with it every night
under his pillow.
Then there were all sorts of original
documents on display. Your correspon-
dent liked the one from the Burke
Museum at Beechworth. This was a
telegram to the Commissioner of Police
on June 29, 1880, the fatal day at Glen-
rowan when Ned was captured. It
asked for a suit of Kelly armor. The
Burke Museum, splendidly, was first
in.
It happens that this week, 87 years
later, there’s a letter on the Chief Com-
missioner’s table, and the Burke
Museum is still pleading for a suit of
that armor. After all, the north-east is
terribly proud that it was capable of
producing Edward Kelly. However, the
answer in 1967 is sure to be the same
as it was in 1880.
At the school, the most knowledge-
able and faithful student of Kelly was
lan Jones. The bearded Mr. Jones, now
a TV film director for Crawford Pro-
ductions, has been indefatigable in his
Kelly researching for 25 years. Could
one give a few excerpts from his
address?
“Kelly had an enormous impact on
everyone he met. Physically, he was
almost superhuman. Unofficially, he was
heavyweight boxing champion of the
north-east. He was one of the finest
trick riders of the district. He was a
crack shot. Instead of being a bully and
a braggart he was surprisingly quiet
and gentle. There are lots of references
to this.”
Like Manning Clark, Jones thought
Kelly had remarkable literary gifts, and
we noted a little extract concerning the
police, which was quoted from the Jeril-
derie letter by Professor Clark. The
police were “. . . a parcel of bug-ugly,
fat-necked, wombat-headed, big-bellied
magpie-legged, narrow-hipped, splay-
footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English
landlords.”
What else did we hear of his bril-
liance? He was a fine blacksmith, an
excellent stonemason, a good manager
of a timbermill, and as an organiser
and leader, superb. The bank robberies
at Euroa and Jerilderie were the most
brilliant, the most immaculately con-
ducted in the history of Australian bush-
ranging. Nor was anybody harmed. The
ladies afterward spoke of his great
courtesy.
We heard a lot about the “Gentle-
man Ned.” One lady asked was it
gentlemanly to shoot dead three police-
men at Stringy Bark Creek. Mr. Weston
Bate explained that this was war and
the police were given their chance to
shoot first.
However, what we waited for was
lan Jones’ fascinating theory that Kelly
wasn’t just a bushranger, he was to be
the leader of a great uprising in the
north-east.
We would have been forgiven for con-
cluding that the police were the “bads”
and the Kellys were the “goods,” and
we heard a great deal at the conference
about police persecution of the Kellys
and how Kelly’s mother was sent to
jail for three years on the evidence of
a lying constable named Fitzpatrick,
who was subsequently drummed out of
the force.
lan Jones explained all this and dealt
further with the property laws and the
miserable deal being received by the
battling selectors. In early 1880 Kelly
had a considerable number of “sym-
pathisers.”
Yes, Kelly was building an army and
the men in armor were to be his shock
troops. What was his aim? According
to lan Jones, it was to hold the Govern-
ment to ransom and, perhaps, as some
suggested, establish a republic in the
north-east of Victoria. That night in
Glenrowan, Kelly had a plan. After the
police train had crashed, the idea was
to fire two Chinese rockets, which would
bring down the sympathisers from the
hills. The plan went haywire. The sym-
pathiser in charge of the rockets
panicked and fired them too soon.
This, says lan Jones, is why Kelly,
already wounded, left the inn. He went
out to warn the sympathisers. There
were enough of them to overwhelm the
police, but Kelly knew it was now too
late and he didn’t want any more
bloodshed. He voluntarily sacrificed
himself.
He wound up with these words: “Ned
Kelly the man is infinitely greater than
his legend: a man of greater stature
and nobility than anything we have
even hinted at.”
Another intriguing address came from
Professor Louis Waller, the Sir Leo
Cussen Professor of Law at Monash.
The professor, clearly, was unimpressed
by the defence put up for Kelly at his
two-day trial in 1880. If Mr. Bindon,
the barrister, had gone about it just a
little differently it might have been
possible to gain an acquittal or perhaps
a reduction of the charge to man-
slaughter, although Sir Redmond Barry
did tell the jury manslaughter was out
of the question.
This is a frightful over-simplification
of the professor’s case, but it will give
you a rough idea. He would bring
evidence that the police had no inten-
tion of capturing Kelly. They wanted
to kill him. The constables were travel-
ling in plain clothes and they had huge
quantities of ammunition.
Kelly, however, saw them first from
hiding and could have killed them with-
out risk. Yet he chose to step forward
and bail them up. Constable Mclntyre
obeyed Kelly’s commands, but Con-
stable Lonigan jumped for cover to fire
back from behind a log. It was only
then that Kelly shot and killed him.
The specific charge that hanged Kelly
was that that he did with malice afore-
thought kill and murder Lonigan. As
the professor said, getting him off the
murders of Constables Kennedy and
Scanlon might be more difficult.
Naturally, we were all agog to know
if we could have a retrial. The pro-
fessor pointed out that recently in
London the late Timothy Evans was
cleared of murder in the Christie affair.
But he felt the Government would need
an awful lot of goading before it would
stage a trial to clear Kelly.
I think you would agree also that
there would be difficulties in this, but
we could at least set things moving in
the right direction by giving him an
honorary doctorate at Monash.

Keeping up with
the jet
travel set
WITH THE OPENING of Qantas’
Wentworth Hotel, no other hotel is
prepared to admit that they have lost
any business except the Metropole,
where Mr. W. M. B. Small is having
a little trouble with the Club Bar,
which was originally put in for the
thirsty Qantas men. “However, when
the State Office Block is filled in a
month’s time,” he said, “I don’t think
either the Wentworth or ourselves will
be able to handle the business.” Which
speaks well for the Public Service.
The Metropole has wisely retained
its air of gracious living and old patrons
can still find all the familiar public
rooms, while the money has been
poured into updating the apartments
and adding bathrooms.
Something of the same picture can
be seen at the Australia, where Frank
Christie, until last December manager
of the Chevron, has started streamlin-
ing management and cutting costs in
order to bring the old lady of Rowe
Street up to the 1967 competition. A
spokesman for the Australia said they
hoped to get a “Grand Hotel” feeling,
directed toward interstate and intra-
state clients. They want to keep the
“landed gentry” (and they were all
there in droves during Show Week),
but they want to attract a younger
crowd as well - people who will
appreciate the fact that the Australia
is about as conveniently placed as a
hotel can be in Sydney, within walking
distance of main department stores,
restaurants, and theatres.
Free parking for house guests has
now been arranged, and a general air
of bustle and liveliness is apparent in
the old hotel. Many of the key execu-
tives from the old Chevron came with
Christie to the Australia and their
effect is being felt. Things seem to be
just slightly more efficient. Have they
lost business because of the Wentworth?
Certainly not. “Would the Savoy Hotel
in London suffer if a Hilton Hotel
opened nearby?” my informant said
passionately. “We offer a different
service.”
One of the persisting myths is that
American tourists abroad want to stay
at American-style hotels. Often they
want something that is different; this
should enable the Australia to hold its
ground comfortably.
Obviously Menzies Hotel has lost no
ground. When I visited it, top execu-
tives were too involved coping with an
influx of visitors to talk to me
coherently. Menzies has a reputation
for good food and general comfort, and
it is well placed to handle interstate
and international visitors alike. They
are reported to send scouts overseas to
keep in touch with what a hotel should
provide to get its share of the overseas
money and the success of their cut-
down musicals has stirred the Chevron
into entertainment action.
After a cooling-off period while the
“big name” era was being forgotten,
chorus girls have now been hired for
the Chevron’s Silver Spade Room to
back up overseas and local artists. The
people at the Chevron deny that the
Wentworth is making any difference to
life at the Cross, though it would
appear that the hotel is attracting a
different clientele. There is a younger,
slightly more suburban feeling in the
air. It is as if the acme of Sydney
poker-machine clubland will be the
Chevron. If an event is considered too
glamorous to be staged at the local RSL
or Leagues Club, then the committee
will book the Chevron. The entertain-
ment planned chorus girls, comics,
and the lesser known overseas artists
fit into this milieu. But business is boom-
ing. The ballroom is booked for Satur-
day evenings until 1968. And there are
banquets, weddings, sales conferences,
and an 88 to 100 percent booking rate
for the apartments. “The Chevron,”
said the lady in charge of the Banquet
Room feelingly, “is frantic.”
Business is bright at the Carlton-Rex,
too, and steady at the Town House. In
fact most of the top names in hotel and
motel accommodation are receiving
more and more visitors.
DISCOVERY
The answer, according to the Went-
worth executives, is that Australia is
being discovered again. Not only are
international conventions booking the
Wentworth (which accounts for many
of the extra visitors pouring into other
city hotels, since only a percentage can
be accommodated at Phillip Street) but
business people are coming in hundreds
to see what investments are offering in
Australia.
It isn’t only curiosity that is filling
the Wentworth. The apartments are
getting heavy traffic; so are the restaur-
ants. It is now almost impossible to get
a table without booking, particularly
since most of the businessmen in the
area have taken out credit cards. Balls
scheduled for the hall of mirrors include
the Peter Pan Ball, the Wool Ball, the
Pied Piper Ball, the Cruising Yacht
Club Ball, and the Ball of the Aus-
tralian-American Association.
“It is a feature of Sydney’s adult-
hood,” one executive said, “that the
public can be provided with what they
want. Jet travel is getting so fast both
internationally and between States that
no one can afford to be complacent.
The business is there we have to
keep up with it.” That’s good for the
locals!

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Making the
most of those
delightful greens
“EAT YOUR GREENS!” I am almost
convinced are the first words that any
child really recognises. For many, such
vegetables are forever associated with
unpleasant flavor, a mushy consistency,
and the knowledge that if you don’t
eat them you will surely get all kinds
of terrible illnesses.
I must have had an unusually good
cook for a mother, because I cannot
recall ever having to sit and face a
plate of cold, flavorless vegetables. To
this day I love nothing better than
really fresh, lightly cooked, aqd well-
flavored green vegetables.
I must confess that mushy cabbage
(unless it’s bubble-and-squeak) leaves
me feeling unenthusiastic. Brussels
sprouts need to be bright green and
crisp on the palate.
But spinach—how superb this can be.
But not the way it’s dished up in most
restaurants and in too many homes —a
squashy pile of limp leaves, dirty green
in color, gummed together by a pale
green liquid which resembles the water
it was cooked in.
Green vegetables are not only a
necessity to a well-balanced diet but
can be a gastronomic delight. If they
are badly cooked you might just as well
sit down and eat a vitamin pill—it’s less
painful.
In Europe, vegetables are served as
an accompaniment to meat rather than
piled all over the plate. In restaurants
you will find the main courses listed in
one place and a choice of vegetables in
another. In fact, in France the vege-
tables are often served after the main
course rather than with your meal,
which really makes the most of them.
Spinach is worth taking a little
trouble "with. It comes in two varieties:
the huge bundles of dark green leaves
with thick white stalks, and the delicate
small leaves with slim, tender stalks. For
straight-out cooking I would never use
any but the latter.
Strip the stalks off, wash the leaves
thoroughly, immerse in boiling salt
water, and cook until just tender (a
matter of minutes). Drain thoroughly
and put through a moule or blender.
Return to the stove with a nut of butter,
a sprinkle of nutmeg, and you have a
vegetable you can eat.
Personally, I like to make a little
roux of the butter in a saucepan, then
adding the spinach and stirring in suffi-
cient cream to make a smooth con-

from the trading center of North America
sistency. But it depends on what I
want to serve the spinach with.
The large, unwieldy spinach has its
uses, too. In fact, I think it makes
the best vegetable soup of all. Strip
and cook in boiling salt water as be-
fore, drain and run through the blender.
For a large bundle of spinach, pre-
pare in a separate saucepan a pint
of good chicken stock water and two
chicken-stock cubes will do. Add a
whole onion, a clove of garlic, a dash
of nutmeg, and some ground black
pepper. (Cubes are salted, so you won’t
need any more of that.)
Bring the stock to the boil, add your
spinach, and simmer briefly. Remove
onion and garlic. Stir in J pint of
cream and serve immediately. Little
sippets fried in butter and served
separately are a very pleasant accom-
paniment or a sprinkle of parmesan
cheese.
A delicious luncheon, or a superb
entree for a dinner, can be a Spinach
Souffle. If you’ve never made a souffle
before, you don’t know what you've
missed.
However, make sure that your oven
is airtight and reliable, then heat it to
400 degrees. First butter a souffle dish
and sprinkle it lightly with parmesan
cheese. Melt a tablespoon of butter in
a heavy saucepan and briefly saute 3
shallots finely chopped. Add 1 package
of frozen spinach (defrosted) and stir
over a low heat until all the water has
evaporated (approximately 5 minutes).
Set aside.
Now make the roux for your souffle.
Melt 6 tablespoons of butter over a low
heat and stir in 5 tablespoons of flour,
beating briskly all the time until smooth.
Add a teaspoon of salt, some freshly
ground black pepper, and let the roux
cool a little while you beat up 7 egg-
whites. Very stiff.
Add the spinach to your roux and
stir in, one at a time, 6 egg-yolks. Then
fold in the egg-whites. Pour the mix-
ture into your prepared souffle dish and
sprinkle again with parmesan cheese.
Bake for 40 minutes, until the top is
well puffed and lightly browned. Bring
to the table and serve immediately. This
quantity is enough for six as an entree,
or four for lunch.
Another excellent way to eat spinach
—perhaps as a separate vegetable if
you’ve decided to go Continental are
Spinach Patties. Cook a pound of
spinach and drain well. (Or use a
frozen package.) Soak 1 breadroll in
milk and squeeze out well. Add a pinch
of salt, grated nutmeg, 1 tablespoon of
flour, and 1 egg.
Mix together with spinach and shape
your mixture into small rissoles. Roll in
flour, dip in well-beaten egg, then in
toasted breadcrumbs. Shape into thick
fingers and fry quickly in deep fat.
Serve with a mushroom or cheese sauce.
One thing you have to remember is
that spinach needs lots of washing be-
fore you cook it. In fact, I dunk the
whole lot in the sink and squeeze it up
and down several times, changing the
water constantly to remove any grit.

thoughts on
open tennis
THE LAWN TENNIS Association of
Australia proposes to vote for open
tennis, or tournaments at which pro-
fessionals and amateurs can compete.
A few officials are against that, and
so is this column, but for different
reasons. Ours are related to
amateurism.
Most people in sport have a high
regard for amateurs, although many
think that some of the lilywhite rules
on expenses and the value of awards
are anachronistic. But when the people
of a world-famous athlete’s hometown
cannot give him a car, say, because
that would make him (or her) a pro-
fessional, we can understand the dis-
tinction.
Amateur rules vary a little, sport to
sport, but most are explicit that no
amateur should gain largely from his
efforts, nor accept employment which
capitalises on his prowess. So the
public does not understand how
tennis players can be “employed” to
play tennis full-time, can spend year
after year touring the world’s pleasure
resorts like young millionaires, and still
call themselves amateurs.
The only other sportsmen who have
it one-tenth as good are a few pro-
fessionals in a very few other sports.
So our sense of fairness rebels against
the ways of “amateur” tennis, some of
whose players can turn down huge
sums offered by the professionals be-
cause philanthropic employers offer
them more to stay amateur.
We can accept the idea that such
employers are genuine enthusiasts doing
their bit to see that Australia retains
the Davis Cup. But the player they
pay is still capitalising on prowess, and
is not an amateur. Even if he did not
also demand and receive extortionate
expenses from overseas tournament
committees for appearing, he would be
a professional.
All of the tennis associations know
the game is strictly a business. Some
countries turn the blind eye because
they want the internationals at their
tournaments. Their finances and local
interest in the game depend on it.
Other countries simply covet that Davis
Cup. To be charitable, the motives are
better than many in a venal age. They
may easily have kept tennis alive as a
sport. Without the sham, it might have
gone the way of royal tennis long ago.
But in the end, which seems to be
now, public disgust at the sham over-
comes any national pride in winning
the Davis Cup. The guilt-by-association
becomes a little too much to bear, and
a serious reaction sets in, one that
might be very harmful to the subject.
To translate that, we are presuming
tennis’ officials are ordinary men to
whom living a lie has some moral sig-
nificance, which their consciences will
not bear for ever.
Hence, we say, the vote for open
tennis; which any four out of any six
Australians might have made at this
time. The other two, we suggest, would
be those who realise what harm this
could do to tennis. Opens will do
nothing for the game. The fallacies are
based on the success of golf’s Opens. In
golf, the best professionals play not only
against one another but against the
course, with the outcome influenced by
weather, preparation of the greens,
choices of clubs, etc. There is nothing
like that in singles tennis, and very little
in doubles.
The intangibles occasionally allow an
amateur to break through a professional
field in a golf Open. It will not happen
as often, if ever, in tennis Opens, at
-Wimbledon or anywhere else. After
tennis followers have seen how the
amateurs fare against the professionals,
where will the interest lie? Where the
top pros compete they will generally be
the best men.
Golf Opens
More, the professionals will be able
to exert undue influence, because the
sponsors will want them, and they will
not be likely to assent to playing their
way right through a tournament draw.
So, in some ways, tennis Opens will be
conducted differently from golf Opens,
in which the best players are against
the course in each round, and waste no
time or effort playing without reward
against amateurs.
The professionals will seek to estab-
lish a circuit, as in golf, which will not
take in all nations that want them to
play in local tournaments. There will
still be large circuits for the
“shamateurs”; nothing will be changed.
It might be much better for Australian
tennis to jump the other way, and
insist that its amateurs stay amateurs.
Naturally, it will lose many to the
professionals, and now and then -we
might lose the Davis Cup when the
“shamateurs” would have held it. We
will not perish as a nation from that.
A future Davis Cup winner will be
Russia, with its State tennis players,
but Russian State athletes will be a
common problem to all sports.
We hope that this looming threat will
not panic future tennis administrators
into taking further wrong steps. They
should have taken a hard line with
their amateurs years ago. It is not too
late to do so now. At the very least they
should tighten the rules, not relax them
in fear.

Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for

tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia’s

AUSTRALIA
A step back towards
the political wilderness
MR. CYRIL WYNDHAM made a
great effort to be friendly and helpful
to the journalists who gathered in ihe
ALP Federal secretariat offices on the
top floor of the AWU building last
Thursday afternoon.
He had to make the effort because
he was obviously fed up —testy and
tired. He’d been called back from
holidays to handle the special .meeting
called by president Keeffe to consider
Left-wing appeals against the N.S.W.
executive action in proscribing the
Communist-front Association for Inter-
national Co-operation and Disarma-
ment.
As a supporter of Mr. Whitlam, and
vigorous opponent of the ALP being
associated with pro-Communist organi-
sations, he was also obviously upset by
the outcome. It was a crushing victory
for Chamberlain and the Left Wing.
N.S.W. had every other delegate vote
against them, including the so-called
Right-wing deputy leader of the Parlia-
mentary Party, Mr. L. Barnard, as a
Tasmanian representative, and his col-
league Mr. Williams. The South Aus-
tralians, regarded as possible supporters,
also deserted to the Left.
Cyril Wyndham told newsmen that
“he had been asked” to refer them to
the 1963 Federal conference decision
which says that State branches should
watch any bodies which are dominated
by the Communist Party, and that the
Federal executive will take action
which in its opinion is warranted. Mr.
Wyndham had not seen this decision
as preventing State branches from act-
ing on their own. As recently as
August last year, he wrote in the
Federal secretariat’s speaker’s notes:
“Organisations can be proscribed by
any State branch or by the Federal
executive and Federal conference.”
He obviously interpreted the Party’s
rules to allow the N.S.W. action. Indeed
it has been common for individual State
branches to proscribe organisations on
their own initiative. In 1964, the
N.S.W. executive instructed its mem-
bers not to participate in the Australian
Congress for International Co-opera-
tion and Disarmament and to form a
peace organisation of their own.
The AICD is, in the words of its
constitution, intended to continue and
extend the work of the Sydney Congress
of 1964. That was quite clearly, like
four other major congresses before it,
dominated by pro-Communist elements,
and was a similar propaganda circus.
The Federal executive decision must
be judged very humiliating to the
N.S.W. branch. It was bluntly told it
had no jurisdiction to determine
whether any relationship between ALP
.members and the AICD was detri-
mental to ALP interests, and, by impli-
cation, that its order to members to
resign or be expelled was null and
void. Condescendingly, it also informed
the N.S.W. branch that “it has a right
to place before the Federal executive
any complaint it may have against the
AICD.”
They know well its complaints: that
the AICD is a Communist front, that
it supported Liberal Reform Group
rather than ALP candidates in the last
elections, that it was responsible for
many of the violent demonstrations
during the Johnson visit and the elec-
tion campaign, and that generally it is
the sort of group which will keep Labor
in the political wilderness for years.
Western Australia
Rottnest ferries
IF IT WERE an Eric Ambler novel,
the story of the Rottnest ferries could
hardly be more vivid. These little boats
ply between Fremantle and the beauti-
ful island resort across one of the
nation’s windiest waterways, slogging
through or planing home on tricky seas
whipped up quickly by strong breezes.
To this the skippers have added the
hazards of a competition so bitter and
fierce it often seems that the Rottnest
run is being used simply to act out this
long feud of fists and boats.
Until a few weeks ago the three
boats left within minutes of each other,
and fought it out, often literally, for
the two berths left for them at Fre-
mantle; recently, following an inquiry,
the ferry-owners were ordered to stagger
their schedules and not one another.
So far, it has not stopped their feud-
ing, nor the incidental danger to pas-
sengers.

Adult education
Cut back
UNIVERSITY - SPONSORED adult
education in N.S.W. is beginning to
feel the crunch of the Third Report of
the Australian Universities Commission
last September. This recommended that
Australian adult education be largely
unconnected with the universities and
that “support from commission sources
will terminate from the end of the 1967-
69 triennium.”
This month the Sydney University
Department of Adult Education has
terminated “kit courses,” educational
programs in which the student learns,
through action rather than discussion,
about such topics as astronomy, oil
painting, writing, and town planning.
They are primarily for country people,
were basically an experiment, and have
proved highly popular. At present there
are some 94 groups involving 1200
members. Mrs. Bye, of the Coonamble-
Art Society, last week complained to
THE BULLETIN that cultural bene-
fits of the courses outweigh the financial
saving in terminating them. This cry
is likely to be the first of many in simi-
lar vein.
Also this month Dr. Desmond
Crowley, Director of the Department,
is issuing the bulk of copies of a
pamphlet entitled “The Challenge to
University Adult Education.” It pre-
sents a case for significant University
participation in adult education.
The pamphlet concludes: “The atti-
tude of Sydney University is clear. I
have been assured that there will be no
question of the University closing down


the Department of Adult Education. It
would be unjustifiable ... to deprive
the University of Commonwealth
assistance for this important part of its
teaching function, catering for more
than 10,000 adult students.”
Aborigines
Emerging
“WHAT ABORIGINES NEED is to
be brought out of themselves and en-
couraged and taught to take their place
in society,” a Victorian Aborigines’ rep-
resentative, Mrs. Joyce Johnson, said
recently; and last weekend there were
clear indications that on some levels
Australia’s Aborigines were emerging,
stepping willingly into the spotlight
thrown on to their race by the Com-
monwealth’s May 27 Referendum pro-
posals, and by separate moves within
some of the States.
Most of the action was centred on
the Aborigines’ own committees, which
were making plans to support the “Yes”
campaign in May. These committees
were formed during the 10th annual
conference of the Federal Council for
the Advancement of Aborigines and
Torres Strait Islanders in Canberra
during Easter. The organisation has
been working quietly since 1958 to
have Section 127 eliminated from the
Australian Constitution, and Section 51
(XXVI) altered. The first says that
Aborigines should not be included in
'the Census, and the second gives the
Commonwealth power “to enact special
laws for any race other than the Abor-
iginal race in any State.” The words
following “other than” will be elimin-
ated by a “Yes” vote, enabling co-
operation between the Commonwealth
and States on Aboriginal matters.
This will not necessarily follow, of
course. Recently Western Australia’s
Native Welfare Minister, Mr. Logan,
said his Department did not agree with
the Section 51 proposal, because W.A.
would be in danger of losing its sov-
ereignty over Aborigines and could be
forced into policies inappropriate to
local conditions. And last week a
Queensland action in assuming control
of three Anglican missions on Cape
York could be viewed two ways as a
measure solely for the welfare of 1000
Aborigines, or as that of a State prov-
ing it could handle such matters (how-
ever late) without Commonwealth help
or interference. Victoria is also very
sensitive in the same area.
Victoria’s Minister in Charge of
Aboriginal Affairs, Mr. Thompson, has
weathered many recent attacks over
conduct of the Lake Tyers settlement in
that State, the strongest of them from
Victoria’s Aborigines’ Advancement
League through its field officer, Pastor
Doug Nicholls. Last week Mrs. Johnson
was appointed to the management com-
mittee of the settlement during an
upheaval in which the League asked
for a reconstructed Aborigines’ Welfare
Board, and Mr. Thompson agreed to
refer this to State Cabinet after April
29, “if we are re-elected.”
Of Lake Tyers, Mrs. Johnson, an
Aborigine who “could remember being
timid and afraid myself,” said such
settlements should be used to build a
better life for their people, who “need
to be trained to adapt to a higher
standard of living.” Of the troublesome
Welfare Board, Mr. Thompson said,
“We just want a more co-operative atti-
tude between the organisations adminis-
tering Aboriginal affairs.” The Com-
monwealth may have to look at it
similarly, adding “including the States.”
The Aborigines know that the two
items of the Referendum affecting them
will have no support from State Gov-
ernments. They also know how im-
portant a “Yes” vote is, and have
organised as never before to influence
the Australian people in its favor. From
this week on, Aboriginal committees will
begin to issue articles, pamphlets, and
“how to vote” cards. Their leaders will
appear and speak as often as possible,
wherever possible. More than ever be-
fore Australia’s Aborigines will be seen
and heard through the land includ-
ing many unable to vote themselves, not
because they are Aborigines but because
the Northern Territory does not vote in
a Referendum.
As one speaker told their Easter con-
ference, “effective leadership does not
grow overnight, it comes from effective
organisation. Every organisation begin-
ning to act as a pressure group must
be able to think how it can increase its
hitting power within the law.”
It looks like the beginning of the end
of the timid era for the Aboriginal race.
Agriculture
Strange syllabus
COUNTRY PARTY stalwarts are
likely to shudder at the following (taken
from recently printed notes on the
Syllabus in Agriculture, Form VI, Ist,
2nd, and 3rd levels, N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Education):
“Sometimes agricultural protection or
price supports are based on false or
outmoded reasoning; e.g., that agri-
culture is peculiarly basic to the
economy and that general prosperity
depends on a prosperous farm com-
munity or that farmers should receive


a price covering unit costs of produc-
tion plus a reasonable margin of profit.
“Where a country is chronically short
of foreign exchange it may consider it
worth while buying overseas earnings by
subsidising agricultural production for
export. The degree of price support so
justified is often less than that actually
provided and rationalised by appeal to
this argument.”
There is much more besides this, of
course, and not all in the same vein.
However, the farmers’ skins are pretty
thin on the subsidy question and it will
not be surprising if someone wants to
know who is teaching what, and why.
Radio
Beep, beep
THERE’S ANOTHER new sound com-
ing to Australian radio and, possibly,
your own telephone a distinctive beep
beep, beep beep every 15 seconds,
which means this conversation is being
recorded.
You may hear it first on radio. Every
broadcasting station which wanted one
is being issued with a recorder-con-
nector unit, easily attached to any tele-
phone. The Postmaster-General has
announced that several hundreds of
them will be available later, in July.
With these units, and their distinctive
signal, any phone subscriber can record
his conversation legally.
This is good news for radio stations,
which are about to follow the American
swing to “talk-back programs.” Almost
every one of the 5000 radio stations in
America not devoted wholly to music
has at least one such program, and
some talk to listeners virtually all day.
The astonishing success of this format
has caught the attention of Australian
radio stations, which already had some-
thing like it. But because it has been
illegal to record phone conversations,
programs like “At Your Service” (2GB,
Terry Dear and an auctioneer answer telephoned questions on 2GB’s afternoon
“talk” program “Hold The Line”
Federal Treasurer McMahon
Sydney) have been “faked” by very
tedious procedures. When listeners
phoned in questions, staff members had
to record them in their own voices be-
fore they went on the air.
Now that listeners can talk “voice
to voice,” more gripping questions and
answers can ensue. There are plans for
current-affairs programs in which the
commentator will invite listeners to air
their views on everything from Vietnam
to our immigration policy.
We may have similar debates to the
American one which recently occurred
in a program called “Conversation
Please.” A marathon discussion was
triggered off when a woman asked
“should underpants be ironed?” The
lines were jammed for hours.
Perhaps Australian radio hosts will
become experts at vivid repartee. We
may find the Australian counterpart of
American radio man Joe Payne, who
told one of his listeners. “Lady, I’d like
to paste a stamp on the end of your
nose and mail you to a forest fire.”
Stations throughout Australia will
deal only with local inquiries. None is
likely to emulate the Washington radio
station with a program called “World
Wide Conference,” which answers
verbal or written questions from any
English-speaking country in the world.
But Australian housewives dissatisfied
with their own radio-discussion group
can always try Washington.
Farm loans
Few borrowers
IT SOUNDED odd from the outset
$5O million to lend and few takers. This
was the amount made available to
farmers through trading banks under
the year-old Farm Development Loan
Fund. Last month Federal Treasurer
McMahon explained in Parliament, “I
can assure the House the money is
available. The banks have informed us
they are willing to lend, but potential
borrowers do not appear anxious to
take the money.” In fact, during the
past year of drought conditions in
many country areas, only $l7 million
has been committed in loans by the
banks. The puzzled tone of Mr.
McMahon’s recent statement compared
with his estimate last October that $25
million of the FDLF funds would be
committed by January 1, 1967, seemed
to indicate a slip-up somewhere.
Mr. R. B. Cameron, of the Australian
Bankers’ Association, told THE
BULLETIN last week that there was an
explanation for farmer reluctance.
Banks were anxious to lend for any
farm buildings which would make for
more efficient handling of stock (fenc-
ing, branding yards, bale-sheds,
fodder barns, and so on), but rejected
proposals by farmers to build items
which were non-productive social
amenities (workers’ cottages, home im-
provements), etc.
However, farmers’ organisations gen-
erally deny any widespread dissatisfac-
tion with the FDLF scheme. They stress
that the farmers likely to borrow from
the fund are the smaller landholders,
younger men with security, who are
instinctively conservative and reluctant
to take out large sums over a lengthy
period.
But there are other reasons. One is
the inexperience of the farmers in secur-
ing loans from banks: they tend to pro-
pose impractical schemes or ones which
are not specific and detailed enough to
convince bank managers. Sometimes it
is simply that farmers feel “developed”
enough already and are not willing to
undertake any new projects.
Others appear to be caught between
the effects of the drought and their
own misgivings about how to cope with
them. Drought recovery has not been
effective in many areas (some sections
missed both the August and December
rains), resulting in no restoration of
pastures and hence insufficient supplies
of stock to undertake “development.”
Again, farmers are not willing to borrow
heavily yet, because of the high prices


of the limited stock available at the
moment.
But this is likely to change soon.
Both the banks and farmer groups pre-
dict that the next few months should
see a gradual rise in amounts borrowed,
particularly from the south-western
Queensland and north-western New
South Wales areas, which have only
recently begun to recover from the
drought. Mr. McMahon’s next an-
nouncement should be a happier one.
Margarine
A new miracle
MARRICKVILLE HOLDING’S invi-
tation to an “Announcement of Great
Importance” had Sydney all agog last
week. Rumor was that a new product
was about to burst on to the market,
something which would irritate Mr.
Chaffey, N.S.W. Minister for Agricul-
ture, and put Marrickville Holdings
ahead in their battle with the bother-
some quota restrictions. (Marrickville’s
“Miracle” table margarine, 100 percent
polyunsaturated, had its production
quota reduced to almost 4000 tons last
November. Demand throughout Aus-
tralia was said to be 12,000 tons.)
The invited gathered in a hotel re-
ception-room, clutching drinks and hors-
d'oeuvre (spread with marge, of
course), and waited for Mr. Crebbin,
managing director of Marrickville, to
Managing director Crebbin relaxing
on the old spread
draw aside some black curtains. What
would he reveal? A radiant, happier
Mrs. Jones demonstrating a 100 per-
cent polyunsaturated face cream, just
as excellent on your bread as on your
face?
Zip! went the curtains, showing a
new-type margarine, labelled “cooking,”
but destined for the table; encased in
a gold box very much like the famous
“Miracle” margarine wrapping.
“Mrs. Jones” was displayed (in pic-
ture, not in person) spearheading a
lavish campaign to explain to house-
wives why this margarine is mislead-
ingly labelled “cooking.” “The quota
restrictions won’t allow us to label it
t e margarine,” she explained,
but it “belongs on a loaf as naturally
as the crust.”
Press, radio, and TV ads are working
entertainingly and hard to sell this new
margarine image. It seems quite natural
that the frustrated housewife who can’t
get her “Miracle” will take the next
best thing, which looks and tastes just
like the spread she wants and costs
about 12 cents less.
Marrickville Holdings say the new
spread conforms explicitly to N.S.W.
law, which places no restrictions on the
production of cooking margarine pro-
vided the product contains no more
than 10 percent of vegetable oils.
Mr. Chaffey was not slow to comment
on the exciting news. He said that the
new product seemed to be a subterfuge,
and that it would be examined to see
to what extent it conformed to the law.
“People should,” he said, “consult
their doctors as to whether this new
product is virtually different to the old
bread and dripping with pepper and
salt which I and many other con-
freres were reared on to the high state
of physical perfection that we have
attained during our lifetime.”
Hire Purchase
Dos and don'ts
IF AUSTRALIA’S children are wise
they will snatch a pamphlet to be
offered to them in schools throughout
Australia in coming months. It tells
them what credit is all about and is
being issued by the Australian Finance
Conference Ltd. not with the idea
of creating young J. P. Morgans but to
try to prevent future adults from join-
ing the thousands of often unwitting de-
faulters in Australia. With, as the
pamphlet says, more than If million
hire-purchase agreements being signed
every year, this seems a necessary part
of any child’s education.
The idea is not for children only.
Smaller folders, “Credit care or credit
cares?”, will be slipped into one mil-
lion Australian pay envelopes. And if
everyone reads his or hers carefully
there will be fewer people accepting
contracts without careful reading.
Darcy Niland
Obituary
Darcy Niland
DARCY NILAND died last week,
aged 48, and Australasia lost one of its
better writers and, more important, one
of its best storytellers. Darcy wrote his
stories from a breadth of experience as
a young knockabout worker around
Australia and in New Zealand, where
he met his future wife and writing part-
ner, Ruth Park. The determination
which enabled him to make a living as
a freelance writer from young man-
hood, in a time when few could, was in
his face and even deeper in his charac-
ter. He looked a fighter but was aggres-
sive only toward the challenges of his
craft. Such a man could not have been
“old world literary” any more than
Henry Lawson or Gavin Casey, and he
was of their kind, a keen observer with
a flash of humor, essentially Australian,
that illuminated his work and speech.
As a storyteller in the oldest tradi-
tion of mankind, Darcy Niland was
second to none. He never told a bad
story, knew all the skills that went
into a good one, and was writing very
good stories many years before his
first, novel.
Darcy may have been the last of
those who wrote first-hand about the
unsophisticated non-automated Aus-
tralian who worked with his hands and
often thought with them, who believed
religiously in mateship and was at his
best in hard times. Like that Australian,
“Ni” had few idols, liked a battler,
followed no fashion, but was true to
his own experiences.


Man on the Land
Feeding the sacred cow
of rural research
AS A CANDIDATE for sacred -cow
status we hereby nominate agricultural
research and extension. As a disbeliever
we must accept the risk of being stoned.
Therefore, before discussing the classic
example of sacred-cowdom which has
come to our notice, we hasten to add
that the story is not all bad. The good,
probably, far outweighs the bad. But
the bad is bad enough and people
ought to know about it particularly
as people are jaxpayers, and taxpayers
are footing most of the agricultural re-
search and extension bill.
The Australian Wool Board, which
derives half its income from taxpayers
and half from woolgrowers (except that
the growers’ share is a legitimate per-
sonal income-tax deduction), is a gen-
erous donor of funds for research and
extension. The Wool Board chairman.
Sir William Gunn, has just announced
that $190,000 has been allocated for
special research projects this financial
year. Of this amount, $122,000, to uni-
versities, is accounted for by some 39
postgraduate and eight undergraduate
studies; $68,000, to State Departments
of Agriculture, is spread over 27 post-
graduate projects.
Approximately half of these projects
will result in Ph.D.s for individual re-
searchers, and from this we may deduce
that the Ph.D. is a much sought-after
accolade. Nine will result in over-
seas experience for individual research-
ers, and presumably the overseas ex-
perience is a valued item also. No
one, in the research and extension
field, is ever going to blow the whistle
on this system. If your colleague is
able to convince the Wool Board that
his project is deserving of an allocation,
then good luck to him. It is the way
the system goes.
But the point which needs to be
raised is this: Is the Wool Board quali-
fied to do this sort of thing? If there
are extra funds available, could not the
universities and the State Departments
of Agriculture themselves make the
allocations?
In the very same week that he
announced the Wool Board alloca-
tions, Sir William Gunn issued a warn-
ing to woolgrowers to be careful about
costing new techniques. He said: “There
has always been a certain amount of
risk in woolgrowing, but there is
absolutely no reason why growers should
be pressured into risking money on
any new or altered practices which
might be uneconomic or unprofitable.”
This is the best thing Sir William
Gunn has ever said. It is just a pity
the sentiment contained in it is not
applied to the wool promotion pur-
sued with such vigor by the same board
under the same chairman. Sir
William, unfortunately, was not refer-
ring to himself or the board. He was
referring to a new breeding technique
which, according to some growers, costs
more than it is worth.
The very same technique was
derived, originally, from work in
breeding matters generally sponsored by
funds supplied by the same Wool Board
and the same chairman. If not directly
responsible, the Wool Board was cer-
Research? And who pays?
tainly indirectly responsible for the
technique which Sir William Gunn
now tells growers to cost with care.
He said: “The board’s advice on this
matter is that growers should sit down
with a pencil and paper and carefully
cost any new technique, and its likely
return, before adopting it. If the
slightest doubt exists about the econ-
omics of the technique, then growers
should seek the advice of their State
Department of Agriculture sheep and
wool officer.”
This would seem to indicate that
Sir William will go to great lengths
to get out from under on this one.
But the particular research, in this par-
ticular instance, is part of the vast
chain reaction begun when the Wool
Board was reorganised and recon-
structed, largely by Gunn. To attack
the growth of this bureaucratic organis-
ation and its ill-defined, yet enormously
powerful, role in the allocation of tax-
payers’ money is not in any way an
anti-education, anti-research, anti-
extension exercise. It is, however, an
exercise in anti-sacred-cowdom.
We do not propose here to go into
the merits or otherwise of the particular
controlled breeding technique referred
to by Gunn. We are concerned with the
great dispenser role adopted by the
Wool Board. In complaining about this
particular technique, Sir William
clearly had only a vague idea of what
research is supposed to be. It is never
a slot machine into which you put
money and get something, necessarily,
in return.
From what we read about the breed-
ing technique, the costs side was never
hidden and no one ever pretended that
it would be as cheap as normal pad-
dock mating. However, there is some-
thing in the farmer’s nature which
assumes that any new development will
not cost him, personally, anything. If
there is a cost, then the Government
exists to pay it.
The money allocated for scholarships
is but a fraction of the total at the Wool
Board’s disposal. In all, these funds
come to about $4 million a year. The
CSIRO, the holiest of all the cows,
gets the biggest share. It, too, recently
came up with another technique which
is costly the antibiotic control of
footrot.
The CSIRO, itself, never did hide
the fact that this method would be
costly. However, the farmers, on hear-
ing about it, made submissions to at
least two State Governments to have
antibiotics removed from the restricted
list and reduced in price by means of a
subsidy. There are any number of pre-
cedents for this kind of thing (for
example, the superphosphate and
nitrogenous fertilisers bounty). So why
not another one?

How to quadruple
wool output
MEDALS AND AWARDS are usually
bestowed in professional agriculture on
old people for having spent many years
in administration and/or for having
published, often in erudite foreign
journals. However, there are a few
instances of relatively young people hav-
ing been honored for doing something
that directly benefits the man on the
land. Messrs G. E. Robards and G. R.
Peart, of the Agricultural Research
Station at Trangie, N.S.W., would
appear to qualify for admission to this
short roll. They have at once recog-
nised how lucerne may be used as a
pasture plant and demonstrated how to
quadruple wool production per acre.

“What’s Brahms doing
on a dictating
machine?”
Most dictating machines don't reproduce
music too well because they have 1 speed
only, for words.
The National RQISBS has a 17/sl 7 /s i.p.s.
speed for dictation, plus a faster 3% speed
for finer musical effects.
And when headphones aren’t being used,
sound pours forth from a large 6" cabinet
speaker, not a tiny one in the mike. The
National plays longer, too. Its “auto-
reverse” gives 3 hours’ playing time, so it’s
ideal for meetings or long play classics
sessions at home. And when you’re dictat-
ing, you can switch to “auto-voice” to
capture your words and not your pauses.
So why lavish more on a 1-speed dictating
machine? $189.95 buys you a National 2-
speed, 9 transistor RQISBS tape recorder,
that does much more.

has been by “The Agricultural Gazette
of New South Wales.” It has published
postage-size mug shots of the pair and
permitted them a half dozen pages to
tell their story. Briefly this is it:
Lucerne should be rotationally grazed.
By adopting this principle at Trangie,
four sheep per acre were maintained
throughout the year. They cut an
average of 10.81 b. of greasy wool per
head. During spring, the luxuriant
growth of lucerne allowed another 2.5
sheep per acre to be carried for 14
weeks. Total wool production for the
year amounted to 521 b. per acre. In the
same year the flock mates of these
sheep, grazed nearby on native pasture,
yielded only 11.81 b. of wool per acre.
Though run at less than one per acre,
the carrying capacity of this country
was exceeded and the sheep had to be
hand-fed for three months to ensure
their survival.
Nothing more need be said, really.
These facts speak for themselves. They
are even more compelling when it is
recalled that Robards and Peart con-
ducted their experiment during the
recent severe drought. Only 14.4 inches
of rain fell at Trangie in that year. The
lucerne, which was not watered, had
been established for two years. It was
not, however, an impressive stand when
the rotational grazing experiment began
and was described as average for the
district. The sheep involved were three-
year-old dry merino ewes. There were a
total of ten paddocks and the whole
flock was put to graze on each in turn
for one week. This meant that in winter,
when the lucerne was making scarcely
any growth, the sheep consumed every-
thing that was edible in the first three
or four days and spent the rest of the
week on bare ground. Nevertheless,
their average bodyweight did not fall
below 851 b.
Even more surprising was the fact
that not a single lucerne plant died out.
On the contrary, the plant population
increased by 60 percent. The heavy
stocking for short periods obviously did
not damage the stand and may even
have been beneficial. In the past,
lucerne has been grazed continuously
for relatively long periods. Under these
conditions it soon dies out, because the
sheep nibble off the new shoots as they
appear and leave the mature stalks un-
eaten. A great search and crossbreeding
program has been conducted by CSIRO
to obtain a variety of lucerne that will
withstand this treatment. By what seems
to be an obvious tactic, Robards and
Peart have largely removed the need
for this research project. Basically, their
simple idea is to employ the sheep like
mowers to harvest the lucerne, because
it has long been recognised that fre-
quent, close mowing does not harm
lucerne.
The dramatic results of their pilot-
scale experiment quickly prompted
some large area trials, both on the
Experiment Station and on private
properties in the district. It is too soon
yet to appraise the commercial success
of these ventures, but the early indica-
tions are go-go. For instance, one
farmer has 1500 sheep on 300 acres of
lucerne sub-divided into ten paddocks.
He moves the mob the day after it has
reduced each field to bare ground. This
program has gone on now for nearly a
year without striking trouble.
That this is no odd finding applicable
only to the central-western plains of
New South Wales seems to be borne
out by somewhat similar work being
done in southern Queensland by Messrs.
G. R. Lee and W. E. M. Rothwell, of
the Department of Primary Industries.
They have been striving to find a way
of increasing the carrying capacity of
the notoriously poor traprock country
which extends over some 2000 square
miles, running up on to the Northern
Tablelands of N.S.W. They have a
grazing experiment going on an area
which consists of one-sixth lucerne and
the remainder native pasture. The sheep
are run continuously on the native
pasture but given access to the lucerne
paddock for one week in every six.
G. R. Peart
(j. E. Robards
This plan is being implemented on
several areas, using different stocking
rates. At one sheep per acre, wool yield
has been increased by an average of
16 percent over the past three years
where lucerne has been available to
supplement the native grazing. Another
comparison between the productivity
of the sheep getting lucerne occasionally
and those denied it shows nearly a
threefold increase in wool yield per
acre.
The Queensland study is being sup-
ported financially by the Wool Research
Fund. The Trangie study apparently
isn’t, which seems rather odd in view
of the fact that a great number of pro-
jects are getting this support, but are
unlikely ever to put a dollar in a wool-
grower’s hand. Sometimes one wonders
what has become of good old-fashioned
agricultural research of the sort pursued
by Robards and Peart. Maybe R. and
P. will discover the facts of academic
life soon and get with the ivory tower
boys before they find themselves too
old to join the club.

"Better not cut Defence too much —we
might have to fight another oil slick."
COMMENT
Can Mr. Holt be a diplomat?
WHILE SIR ROBERT MENZIES
used to be criticised for not visiting
Asia, Mr. Holt is now being criticised
for visiting it too much. The criticism,
which has been moderate and reasoned,
raises doubts about whether “personal
diplomacy” is the way to do things and
suggests that diplomacy is a somewhat
technical affair that may be beyond
the capacity of Mr. Holt. In a perfect
world this might he so. But there can
be also a slapdash, even a tragi-comic
quality about foreign policy (of which
diplomacy is merely the instrument)
that can sometimes be as effective as
expertness.
For one thing, Mr. Holt’s imagina-
tion has obviously been aroused by some
vision of Australia playing a role in
the Indo-Pacific area that goes beyond
(even though it must still include)
supporting its principal ally. It is good
that he should go to these nations, meet
their leaders for himself, get the “feel”
of them, so that they cease to be, in
his mind, mere abstractions on a map,
or in a departmental report. A quick
official visit, with its physical pressures,
distractions, and trivialities, is not the
best way to do this. But it is the only
way available to a Prime Minister. And
what an extraordinary tour it is! Mr.
Holt is probably the first person in the
world to sit down with Chiang Kai-shek
a few days after sitting down with
Sihanouk.
One of the important roles of foreign
policy is that it can be one of the
means by which a people ennobles
itself, raises itself above day-to-day
considerations to take up more general
interests. A tour such as Mr. Holt’s
can dramatise to the Australian people
where they stand in the world, the kind
of people they are. As it turns out,
this particular tour shows us to be
better than we sometimes imagine our-
selves to be—staunchly supporting our
allies, but also tolerant and capable of
co-existence with those who disagree
with that support.
To inform himself of what other
nations are and to inform us of what
we ourselves are, Mr. Holt runs the
risk of disturbing those who see foreign
relations as a matter of privately exer-
cised skills. He may even upset some
of the pieces. Does this matter? Living
on the edge of an area where the
rhetorical and the heroic play a large
part in foreign policy, Australia some-
times projects a strangely timid and
cautious image. Perhaps a little more
dash might do us good as a nation—
and, in the irony of events, it is as likely
to serve self-interest as planning.
Where the critics of Mr Holt are
clearly wrong is in the suggestion that
policy-making is not his business. The
External Affairs Department can
recommend its own policies or evaluate
other people’s policies, but it cannot
make final decisions about what Aus-
tralian policy is to be. According to
our theory of government this must
finally be a matter not between experts
but between the Prime Minister and the
Australian people. That Mr. Holt may
be the first Prime Minister since John
Curtin to try to make it so is to his
credit.
Meanwhile, in Japan, Mr. Hasluck is
engaged in a more active diplomacy,
perhaps taking the first steps in an
association in which Japan may assume
some of those political responsibilities
in the Indo-Pacific area that, for a
generation, have seemed unpalatable.
In Tokyo, as in other foreign cities,
Mr. Hasluck has spoken well. It is
only in Australia that he loses the power
of speech.
When Mr. Holt and Mr. Hasluck
return from their valuable tours, is it
too much to hope that the two of them
will work out some way of informing
the Australian people, with imagina-
tion and clarity, of the role they see for
Australia in the area in which we live?




BRITAIN-Theend of the affair
THIRTY YEARS AGO in Sydney
there was an English Governor-General
in Admiralty House, an English Gov-
ernor in Government House, and an
English Archbishop in Bishopscourt.
Now there is an Australian Governor-
General, an Australian Governor, and
an Australian Archbishop . . . Thirty
years ago all but one of our Church of
England diocesan bishops were English.
Now there are only eight English
bishops left in what has become the
“Church of England in Australia” . . .
Thirty years ago the emphasis in
primary-school geography was on the
theme of “Australia and The Empire,”
and schoolchildren were given an image
of the world in which what mattered
most were the famous cities of the
Empire, its great Naval Stations, and
the shipping routes that connected
them. Now a big part is played by the
theme of “Our Neighbors to the Near
North.” The Commonwealth of Nations
is still in the syllabus as a theme, but
of equal importance is the theme of
“World Leaders.” According to the
syllabus, the world leaders are the
U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R
Thirty years ago almost all of the
main foreign news stories in our news-
papers were about Britain and Europe.
A survey of the Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph” and the Melbourne “Age” over
December and January last compared
with the London “Times” and “Daily
Express” shows that while the two Aus-
tralian papers averaged 80 percent of
their attention in their principal foreign
news stories on Asia, the two Lon-
don papers gave Asian topics only 40
percent of their main attention. In
London, Africa gained twice the atten-
tion it gained in Australia. The London
papers gave Europe 17 percent of their
main foreign news stories; the Aus-
tralian papers gave it none of their main
foreign news stories. While the Aus-
tralians averaged 15 percent on Indo-
nesia, the London papers did not make
one major story out of Indonesia. It
may also mean something that the
London newspapers gave China almost
twice the importance the Australian
newspapers gave it . . .
In other ways, given the cataclysms
of the past thirty years, Australia is
still unexpectedly close to Britain.
Whereas the Canadians many years ago
passed out of the sterling area and gave
no strategic regard to Britain, Australia
still banks with Britain and is still con-
cerned with what is left of the British
presence in South-East Asia. The
Canadians have their own highest court
of appeal; Australians still go to Lon-
don. The Canadians have their own
national emblems and their own
national flag; Australians still stand to
“God Save The Queen” and content
themselves with an ensign.
What are to be the future relations
between Britain and Australia? Will
the present gentle decline continue? Or
will the adjustments to a world without
British power finally lose their gentle-
ness and become more bumpy? On the
other hand, is it possible that
could be some kind of increase in re-
lationship between the two nations? Is
this possible at a time when Britain
is pulling out east of Suez and con-
templating entry into the European
Common Market?
So far as trade is concerned, Britain
is now like a card player who can’t
decide how to build up his hand. It’s
time to discard and try to collect
something that might win a game. The
solitary ace kept on for old times’
sake as a relic of world power might
as well be discarded at once. The two
main players already hold all of the
rest of the aces, face up on the table
for everyone to see. The cards that
were saved for a partnership with
America can also be discarded. America
is too big for a special partnership. The
few diamonds should be held on to for
a while, because a country that is still
a world power, however inadequate at
its job, has to keep all the diamonds it
can lay its hand on. And the royal
cards remain—although it has broken
down from its own expansion, the
Commonwealth still adds a little color
to the hand. But the big question for
Britain is whether to discard everything
else and build up on the Common
Market cards or to go on holding a bit
of this and that and see what happens.
This month, next month, Britain will
decide whether or not to try for the
Common Market. Then de Gaulle may
have to decide whether or not to let
Britain in. If both decisions are “yes”
the effects on Australia, however ready
we might think we are for them, might
nevertheless produce the greatest single
concentrated shock in relations between
Australia and Britain since the fall of
Singapore in 1942. This is not to say
that the British should not go into the
Common Market. They have their own
economic problems to solve, and these
problems are much greater than ours.
But whereas when they last tried for
entry some Australians engaged in ex-
cesses of abuse, this time we are engag-
ing in excesses of indifference.
The fact remains that British entry
is likely to put a question mark against
15 percent of our total world exports,
and we are not likely to be so lucky
as to get out of it without considerable
tension and perhaps some hardship. In
the interests of good relations between
Britain and Australia, it is better to
talk about such things now than to
run the risk of being unnecessarily taken
by surprise. Although disposing of the
750,000 tons of wheat that Britain now
buys from us cannot be done overnight,
some of our exports would be relatively
easy to switch to other countries if we
were given time to phase out as we
are likely to be. Others, particularly
sugar, dairy products, and fruit, are
going to be hard to sell elsewhere.
At present we sell about two-fifths
(in value) of our total sugar exports
to Britain, and we sell at the highly
favorable rate of £stg.43 a ton, com-
pared with a world price of £stg.l6.
If the Common Market countries force
Britain into substituting their beet
sugar for our cane sugar this is going
to produce great alarm in Queensland.
More than half of our total dairy
exports go to Britain, and it may be
impossible, for a while at least, to sell
most of these anywhere else and
this in the dairy industry, beset by
problems, hypersensitive and with a


"The Dominions sprang to the defence of the Mother Country..."
tough lobby entrenched in the Country
Party. Of all of our exports of fruits,
more than half go to Britain and it is
quite likely that replacement markets
will not be found. If Britain went into
the Common Market on terms that
were unfavorable to these exports we
might have to adjust ourselves in Aus-
tralia to what economists coolly call a
“reallocation of resources”; that is to
say, a number of our farmers would
have to change what they produced, or
sell out.
In addition to these direct shocks in
areas of high political sensitivity, an
even more significant shudder might
come from across the Tasman. If no
special arrangements were made for
New Zealand it would be in the appall-
ing position that about half of its
exports would be threatened by the
Common Market. It seems unlikely that
Australia would be indifferent to such
a predicament, but we could not assist
New Zealand only by joint marketing
schemes. We would also have to buy
more goods from New Zealand,
especially those such as dairy products
at which the New Zealanders are more
efficient than we are. And this would
further threaten politically sensitive
Australian farmers.
Even if Harold Wilson says “no” to
the Common Market, or Wilson says
“yes” and de Gaulle says “no,” our
trading connection with Britain is still
likely to grow less, although more
peacefully. The British long since
started cutting down on the proportion
of their purchases from Australia
(although we have not cut down so
rapidly). Sixteen years ago we spent
a bit less on British imports than they
spent on Australian exports: now we
spend $250 million a year more on
British goods than they spend on ours,
and Japan is now replacing Britain as
our main customer.
Some of this has happened because
Bradford no longer dominates the
world wool trade and the Japanese
have become big wool importers. But
much of the rest of it has happened
because the British have been more
realistic than we have been. We still
go on buying British goods from force
of habit or because preferential tariffs
give them an edge on their competition,
or because British-owned firms in Aus-
tralia buy British. The British do not
give many of our exports the same pro-
tection and their purchasing impulses do
not rely so strongly on convention or
sentiment.
No one has been the villain here
(although Australia has been some-
thing of a clown). The old arrange-
ments worked when the British needed
our raw materials and we needed their
manufactures. That situation is ending,
and both countries are moving toward
new arrangements, with Australia mov-
ing more slowly than Britain. As things
stand now we give a preference of 10J
percent on almost all of the goods we
buy from Britain: in return the British
give a preference of only 9 percent
on only about half the goods they buy
from us.
In investment, Britain no longer pro-
vides most of our foreign capital, as it
used to, and the new double tax agree-
ment may restrict it even further if, as
reported, the British intend to tax in
Britain income that has already been
taxed in Australia. The Americans alone
now provide almost three-quarters as
much as Britain, and other countries
about two-fifths. But the decline in the
importance of British investment in
Australia has not been of the same
order as the decline in importance of
British trade, for the very sensible
reason that Australia is a better bargain
in investment than it is in trade. Britain
is still our main single source of foreign
capital providing about $250 million
out of a total $530 million last year
and, while British influence declines in
so many other ways, British investors
in Australia show more signs of alert-
ness than they used to, in projects such
as the Consolidated Goldfields move
into iron ore at Mt. Goldsworthy, the
Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation’s move
into Hamersley, and the recent burst of
British investment in the road trans-
port industry.
Until recently, more often than not,
British investment here was stodgy, pro-
tecting established positions rather than
moving into new opportunities, while
the Americans took more initiative,
dominating whole industries, such as
the motor-car industry, the chemical
and pharmaceutical industries, the food
industries, and pushing more aggres-
sively into other fields such as mineral
development and the search for oil. It
may be for this reason that, while much
more of Australian enterprise is owned
by the British than by the Americans,
the Americans are more obvious, be-
cause they have been more innovatory.
There have also been more of them
around. While the British have got into
the habit of letting Australian opera-
tions run themselves with Australian
management, many top American com-
panies send out Americans to provide
top management. Even when they let
Australians run their firms they usually
keep a very tight control on them from
America.
The result has been that almost all
of what are taken to be progressive
business methods in Australia are
American. Almost any ambitious Aus-
tralian executive, working his way up
through a firm even if it is not an
American firm draws his inspiration
from American organisational methods.
Even progressive British firms are seen
in terms of American influence. It is
probably this drawing of business
inspiration from America rather than
Britain that (a long way after the
ANZUS Treaty) marks one of the
main ways in which we are substitut-
ing America for Britain, a process
otherwise much exaggerated because
many other British influences, as they
decline, are not replaced by any one
country in particular.
What of our habit of banking with
Britain, of keeping most of our foreign
exchange in sterling? At present we
keep about two-thirds of our foreign
exchange this way, less than it used to
be, but high when you consider that
only two-fifths of our trade is in the
sterling area. Unless Britain devalues,
we make money out of this arrange-
ment from the high interest we can
earn as Britain desperately fights to
save sterling by making it unusually
profitable to hold funds in London. In
the long run? No one knows. The whole
future of sterling is in question, as is
the future of the dollar for that matter,
as experts try to work out new ways
of making international payments.
As a strategic power east of Suez,
Britain has not been of decisive import-
ance to Australia for more than a
generation. With the fall of Singapore
it was all over. It is more extraordinary
that the British should still be in South-
East Asia at all than that they are now
phasing themselves out. The extremely
well - conducted counter - insurgency
against the Communists in Malaya at
first kept them there, then the desire
to appear to be playing some part by
maintaining a strategic reserve, then
the counter-confrontation of Sukarno.
This has been the only part of the
world since the war where the British
have won their battles. They have done
a good job. But it is hard to see how
the demands of politics at home will
allow them to continue to commit
troops to an area in which home
opinion is not interested. In a country
where newspapers give no particular
treatment to Indonesia, who really
cares about South-East Asia? American
pressure is the only question of real-
politik still affecting the British
presence in Malaysia and Singapore, but
the British may finally be able to satisfy
the Americans by making a commit-
ment to fly troops back if required


"...then we were fighting for ourselves."
"...Now, in Vietnam, we are fighting without the British
and by spending on aid in South-East
Asia some of the money they will save
on defence. If France allows Britain
into the Common Market, Britain may
become less interested in satisfying
America.
THERE IS SOME British talk of “fall-
back bases” in Australia, but some of
it is double-talk. If the British are not
wanted in any of the nations of South-
East Asia they are of no use in Aus-
tralia. “Fail-back bases” in Australia
would be merely a propaganda device,
a face-saver, with no result except to
give South-East Asian nations a false
view of Australia’s relations with
Britain. What would make more sense
would be a specific military treaty, with
joint guarantees, a British version of the
ANZUS pact.
It is not yet sufficiently realised here
how far apart Britain and Australia
could split on foreign policy if some
future British Government ceases to
care about British relationships with
America. The fissure is already greater
than many Australians realise, and it
has been for a generation. In World
War II the Indo-Pacific area, including
Australia itself, was, of necessity, unim-
portant to the British compared with
the battle for Europe. The Japanese
segment of World War II was Aus-
tralia’s first patriotic war, the first in
which Australia’s interests were directly
and clearly involved. Our earlier con-
tingents, to the Anglo-Sudan War, the
Boer War, and even, to some extent,
World War I, were participating in an
imperial war, not a patriotic war. In
the jargon of the time, “The dominions
sprang to the defence of the Mother
Country.” In the Japanese war we were
fighting for ourselves. Although, in-
directly, this was also the case in the
Korean War, the Malay Insurgency,
and the Indonesian Confrontation, we
were also part of a Commonwealth
force. In the Vietnam War we are fight-
ing without the British. In the foresee-
able future it is unlikely that we shall
fight alongside the British again.
The Queen’s picture hangs on the
wall in the messes of the Australian
forces in Vietnam, but it hangs there
as the image of the Queen of Australia,
not of the Queen of Great Britain.
In the troubled affairs of the Indo-
Pacific area it is likely that, in some
future time, we shall find ourselves
clearly opposed to British policy on
some matters of great importance and
that this will lead to considerable ten-
sion between our two countries. This
tension would flow from the utterly dif-
ferent geo-political considerations that
must perplex the relations between us.
To Australia, the Indo-Pacific area is
where we live. To the British it is just
another part of the world. Already
there is more criticism of Australia in
Britain than most Australians under-
stand. To a certain kind of Englishman
Australia is a poor man’s South Africa:
in itself provincially insignificant, but
given importance as a racialist-
apartheid country, and disgustingly pro-
American.
The Department of Trade, the De-
partment of External Affairs, and the
Department of Immigration have been
the three main Government instruments
in the revolution of Australia’s attitude
to the world. While the Department of
Trade tries to bully the British into
keeping for Australia the trading bene-
fits it still enjoys with Britain, in a
sensible hedge on its bets it also pro-
vides a strong impetus to diversifica-
tion, helping to push Australia’s in-
terests wherever in the world they might
be found, sometimes with a ruthless dis-
regard for old sentiment, or even for
the policies of other departments. The
Department of External Affairs, in its
Dr. Evatt period, was a vehicle of Aus-
tralianism, sometimes admirable, especi-
ally in the push Evatt gave to Aus-
tralian relations with America, some-
times —at the end—somewhat bizarrely,
when Australia’s voice insisted on being
heard on every conceivable interna-
tional issue. There was a reaction
against these policies in the early Men-
zies period, within the Department as
well as in the new Government, but the
Department has come through strongly
now for many years as the sponsor of
policies that have been more inde-
pendent and distinctive than some of
its political spokesmen have been able
to explain, or even understand. In this,
as in other ways, events have moved
far ahead of the politicians’ ability to
describe them. Although the Depart-
ment of Trade and the Department of
External Affairs have been the very
spearheads of Australia’s growing in-
volvement in the Indo-Pacific area, the
Department of Immigration, because of
our immigration policy, has necessarily
played an opposite role.
So far as relations with Britain are
concerned, however, immigration has
also been a weakening factor. Almost
one in ten of the present Australians was
born in continental Europe and, while
before World War II about eight out
of ten immigrants were British, since
the war the average figure is only about
five out of ten. That “New Australians”
are changing the Australian community
is generally recognised, but that the in-
creasing proportion of non-British immi-
grants is changing Australian attitudes
to Britain is not so widely accepted, yet
there is already evidence that second-
generation immigrants are adopting a
kind of nationalism similar to that fos-
tered by many immigrant families at
the same kind of stage in America.
Will these changes in trade, invest-
ment, strategy, diplomacy, immigration,
and general world-view lead finally to
constitutional changes in Australia’s
relations with Britain, at first of the
order of those that have already-
occurred in Canada and later to a
severing of the link with the Crown
(although not necessarily with what will
be left of the Commonwealth, if any)?
While it would be a bold prophet who
would give an answer of “yes” in terms
of timetables, it would be an even
bolder prophet who gave a flat and
final “no.” By the latest Gallup Poll
figures only 28 percent of Australians
are declared republicans, a proportion
that is probably less than it was in the
1890 s, but there is plenty of evidence
that active support and interest in the
monarchy have fallen dramatically in
the past few years and that its principal
support may now lie in the very lack
of interest, in feelings of acceptance
rather than positive support, in the
strength of apathy, the lack of a suffi-
ciently strong reason to change. The
answer to the question is probably that
if a strong reason for change occurs,
apathy, which may by then have grown
even stronger, would, with leadership,,
allow change to occur.
There still seems to be a strong, if
minority, support for the idea of Aus-
tralia as a uniquely British society, in
some ways perhaps now more British
than the swinging image of contempor-
ary with-it London. Although even
some of the Queen’s in
Australia stress that it is the Queen of
Australia, not the Queen of Great
Britain, whom they represent, to some
of their most devoted servants, especi-
ally in the Royal Commonwealth
Society, it is Britain itself that the
Governors represent, and to them
loyalty is not just a matter of loyalty
to the Queen of Australia, or to Aus-
tralia, but to the Queen of England
and to the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.
In the twilight of British power,
Right-wing and Left-wing Australians
do some complicated double-shuffling
on such questions. Among some con-
servatives there is a revolt against
carrying the sentimentalism of our
relationship with Britain into fields of
practical policy. Some of the kind of
men who started life British to the


bootstraps are now unfairly scathing of
the British, exaggerating their decline,
and more pro-American than the
Americans, treating attitudes to
America as tests of complete loyalty.
At the same time some Left-wingers
have swung toward Britain, as an anti-
dote to what they see as the perils of
Americanism. Men who in their
younger days drew part of their radical-
ism from a nationalist anti-Britishry
now proclaim their radicalism by
proudly toasting the Queen as a symbol
of anti-Americanism. Both these ex-
tremes seem to smack of a certain in-
fantile colonialism.
Other subtleties remain. English
immigrants sometimes attack Aus-
tralians for maintaining all kinds of
English attitudes, manners, and snob-
beries, as if Australia had sprung out of
the void, with no previous history, and
they attribute much of the quality of
Australian life (especially those parts
of it they were trying to get away from)
to a continuing British influence. It
might be a more balanced view to
accept Australian society as being one
example of British civilisation and con-
temporary English society as another.
The Australian variety was put together
in its own way, with local variants, but
it claims the history of Great Britain
and Ireland as its own history with as
much right as the present inhabitants
of those two islands. It is no more
absurd that there are “British” charac-
teristics in Australia than that there are
“British” characteristics in America. In
talking about declining relations be-
tween Australia and Britain, one is not
talking about Australia’s relationship
to its own social history but to the
present relations existing between two
independent nations.
Being part of the English-speaking
world, Australia is influenced by world
vogues that emanate from Britain, just
as America is. There are London plays
on Broadway, usually sooner than they
appear in Australia; and the Beatles
went over just as big in America as
they did in Australia. American tourists
flock to Britain, as Australian tourists
do. Australia and Britain could be
further apart than they now are, and
all this would still happen. The Beatles
went over big even in the countries in
which they were banned as examples of
Western decadence. And those for
whom there seem to be better markets
for their talents in Britain migrate
there.
But what of Earl’s Court? Why do
so many young Australians who want
to see the world also want to see it
from the Australian ghetto in London?
It is not all Britishry. While some fall
overboard on the starboard side, despis-
ing everything Australian, glorifying
everything British, others fall overboard
on the port side, growing to hate Britain
so much that they become aggressively
nationalist, sometimes in a strangely
old-hat way. Unless it happens that
British immigration regulations finally
restrict these visits, precipitating a
diaspora of expatriate Australians, Aus-
tralians are still likely to go to Earl’s
Court—because they feel at home there.
Although many young Australians now
seek adventure in countries in Asia and
many would go to America if they
could get in, there is still a sense of
familiarity in London.
There is, it must also be admitted,
the illusion that London is the world’s
cultural centre. People with talents
believe they may be at the centre of
things there, and so for each painter
who finds a good market in London or
each writer who finds a publisher
dozens of others migrate to London
merely to carry with them their failure,
moving their despair from one country
to another, sometimes even blunting
their native wits by aping London’s
virulent provincialisms. In the mean-
time, in the academic world in par-
ticular, other countries now also attract
talent. The habit grows for academics
to pick up a lot of dollars in the first
part of their sabbatical leave by lectur-
ing in America so that they can spend
them later in Britain and Europe. When
the American immigration laws relax
we may see our talent drain more to the
east than to the west.
"...world vogues from Britain."
Most Australian writers are caught
in the cross-currents. If they publish
in England they run the risk of being
published by one of the firms that
market badly in Australia. Shops may
be under-supplied and new supplies
arrive too late. If they publish in Aus-
tralia their books may be lost in the
wash in England. It is extraordinary
how many low-selling authors who pro-
duce books with a predominantly Aus-
tralian appeal still prefer to publish in
England even when their main sales
would be in Australia.
So far as theatre is concerned, there
is some irony in the fact that if it had
not been for British influence there
would have been even less Australian
theatre than there is.
British theatre people of solid experi-
ence coming here find it hard to get
used to this once-removed quality of
Australian commercial theatre and to
the idea that they are expected to do
carbon copies, the more exact the better.
And now that the British seem entirely
committed to fashion, the production
schedules for the Old Tote and the
Union Repertory always seem a year
or so behind the vogue. We are still
at the kitchen sink when they have
moved on to the theatre of cruelty. We
are doing the theatre of cruelty when
they are immersed in the theatre of
fact.
In spite of our talk of exporting
talent to Britain the net gain in the
performing arts seems to be Australia’s.
As fast as Australians go to London, the
British come here and they are often
better trained and more experienced
than our exports. When William Orr
and Eric Duckworth, both British,
began the Phillip Street revues in Syd-
ney with local material and local
players, it might have been because they
couldn’t afford the air fares William-
son’s could, but it was in fact because
this was the sort of theatre they were
used to. And although local little
theatres have at times tried hard to
give some encouragement to local
writers, the two most consistent efforts
have probably been by John Sumner
at the Union Repertory and Robert
Quentin at the University of N.S.W.,
both British-born. Sumner has found
and produced Australian plays, notably
those of Alan Hopgood, and Quentin
was the moving spirit behind last year’s
Jane Street Theatre season of Aus-
tralian plays, the largest single gesture
so far in this direction.
Even if Quentin and Sumner with
their Australian colleagues have done
what must be their conscientious best
for Australian playwriting, the Eliza-
bethan has tended to look toward
Britain. Hugh Hunt, the first artistic
director, an Englishman, was followed
by Neil Hutchison, another Englishman.
In drama, Quentin and Sumner hold
the top jobs in N.S.W. and Victoria.
However, it would be hard to say who
in Australia would have been qualified
for these jobs when they were filled, or
that Englishmen should now move aside
for Australians, particularly Englishmen
who are English only in the sense that,
say, Coral Browne after a lifetime on
the English stage is Australian.
As in the theatre, so generally,
British people will continue to come
to Australia and Australians will con-
tinue to go to Britain. While, as a
whole, British society is different from
Australian society, some individual parts
of the two societies are almost inter-
changeable. It is as nations that we
draw apart, not as individuals, and we
draw apart not because anyone wills it
but because we live at different ends of
the world and the links of self-interest
that have united us are weakening. Aus-
tralia’s interests become more poly-
centric . . . London is one place; Wash-
ington, Tokyo, Singapore, Djakarta,
Saigon are others, and wherever else it
is that our interests take us. In this
greater independence we may acquire a
sense of identity and self-confidence
that marks the best kind of nationalism,
not the nationalism of bags-I and
anxious boasting, but an acceptance of
self-definition. As we drift apart from
Britain, will there be recriminations?
That is largely up to the British. It is
they who, of necessity, have been doing
most of the drifting.

Being Sold
on Death
By JANE RANDOLPH
Gardens at Pine Grove Lawn Cemetery, near Blacktown, N.S.W.,
with a discreet sales-message plaque in foreground
THE INEVITABILITY OF DEATH
has long supported undertakers, but
the real estate involved, usually the
property of the church or a council,
only became a primary consideration
for Australians after 1962 when the
first of the lawn cemeteries was estab-
lished at Eastern Creek, beyond Black-
town. Now there are many such ceme-
teries. In fact, older cemeteries like
Rookwood have had to include lawn
areas for those who prefer the new
style of interment.
The idea of a lawn cemetery seems
to have been invented in Hollywood in
1917, when Forest Lawn, the subject of
much satirical prose, had, as it were,
its premiere.
Mr. A 1 Mclntyre, an American who
came to Australia in 1962 to offer us
'"a public service in bereavement,” was
I[?] graves at Pine Grove
The mobile chapel at Pine Grove
Niches in the crematorium at Pine
Grove
a master salesman in this mini real-
estate game, though he had rather a
hard time selling some Australian coun-
cils on the idea. Finally he achieved
his 170 acres at Eastern Creek, where
Pine Grove Park was established.
According to the rather aptly named
company secretary, Mr. H. Dusting, it
was “a little hard to get off the ground.”
Consequently, five years later, when the
very trees should be exuding music, if
Mr. Mclntyre was to be believed, the
landscaping is only at the halfway
mark.
Mr. Mclntyre’s plans promised
“landscaped lawns, and lakes with
swans, and shrubs, fountains, paved
roads and paths, a mortuary and a
mausoleum, and eventually chapels in
which marriages and christenings will
be celebrated.” What they have at this
time is a very beautiful, well-run
cemetery, flat and green, with only
discreet plaques marking the “sites,”
and apparently an Australian variation
on mausoleums a crematorium. Mr.
Dusting does not consider this some-
thing of an anachronism in a cemetery.
“It is all part of the concept of com-
plete service,” he said. “Some people
prefer to be cremated.” So far 488 have
preferred to be buried.
The actual committal at the “com-
mittal site” is managed with a dis-
cretion which sounds almost slick but
is in actual fact probably preferable to
the sight of the gravediggers standing
by like characters from a medieval
play. To begin with, there is no dirt
showing. This is all spirited away and
replaced long after the mourners have
gone. An automatic lowering device is
used instead of human hands, and the
bereaved are sheltered throughout
under a mobile chapel which is
wheeled out to the site.
Once “committed,” the deceased, who
has invested in the “site,” is assured
of perpetual care. A percentage of the
cost of the site goes into a trust fund,
so that neither the grass growing nor
the dust blowing will ever be a prob-
lem to the family.
Getting used to the idea of being
“sold” on death is the hardest thing to
accept about these cemeteries. It was
genuinely startling to see Pine Grove’s
illuminated Christmas nativity scene
when it was presented for several
seasons. Traffic on the Great Western
Highway slowed to an amazed crawl
when life-sized camels appeared to be
trampling the developing lawns. But
this is part and parcel of the selling
game and it drew many people into the
cemetery area, which was what the pro-
moters wanted.
Now, Mr. Dusting said, many people
like to come and wander round the
grounds, particularly old people. I felt
this was morbid curiosity and surely
something to be discouraged, but Mr.
Dusting was adamant that his cemetery
is not depressing and that old people
get some satisfaction at looking the
place over “before they end up here.”
No amount of delicate juggling can
get rid of the awkward words “death,”
“burial,” and “grave,” though every
effort is made to gloss over them.
“Sites,” “committal,” “lawn parks,”
“pre-need,” and “at need” are used
instead. The sites are sold not door-to-
door but “by contact,” which is exactly
the same thing. Salesmen who will “not
upset people” are chosen and trained
to be perceptive, though many a sales
pitch ends up with everyone but the
salesman sobbing, particularly when it
is stressed that they should arrange “it”
while they all have each other, rather
than alone.
The Associated Forest Lawn
Memorial Gardens at Liverpool have
only 140 permanent residents yet on the
350 acres which, according to one of
their representatives, is “getting like
the Botanic Gardens.” He was quick
to assure me that the percentage of
money taken for perpetual care was
administered by a trust fund and that
additionally there was protection for
the buyer in a clause of the agreement
which automatically gave the deeds of
the “property” to any woman widowed
while paying off the “site” and no fur-
ther payments would be exacted, adding
“though God forbid that anything
should happen” which, under the cir-
cumstances, was probably not so
hypocritical as it sounded.
Costs vary a little between “lawns,”
but you can be assured that, atom
bombs excluded, everything will be the
same at the “committal point” for ever
for $224, plus $25 perpetual care, cash
or terms. And you can expect a highly
trained staff to smooth the way. When
making inquiries at Liverpool I
announced that I was Jane Randolph
from THE BULLETIN and a warm,
masculine voice came through the
phone with deepest sympathy.
“Yes, dear,” he said.

The 10
problems
of TAB
By PETER MANNING
“ONCE WE HAVE established the tote
in an area there will be no difficulty in
getting rid of SP operators.” So pre-
dicted Mr. J. R. Reeves, the N.S.W.
Trotting Club’s nominee on the newly
formed Totalisator Agency Board some
months before N.S.W.’s TAB began
operations in 1964. Three years later
this TAB admitted that SP remained
dominant in most major country towns
and that the SP phone service has
grown rather than diminished. The
small operators had felt the pinch, but
SP far and away was conducting the
greater proportion of the State’s off-
course betting.
Now that South Australia’s TAB has
begun its official operations, the
Premier, Mr. Walsh, has prophesied
that the effects of TAB will include the
extinction of SP. In the light of the
experience of Victoria, Queensland,
Western Australia, and N.S.W., is this
likely to happen? What problems is
South Australia likely to meet? How
will the introduction of TAB affect
racing, Government, and punters?
Collating the experiences of other
Australian TABs reveals at least ten
problem zones for unwary beginners.
Four are problems of the administra-
tive machine:
The problem of
overcrowded shops
Very few expected the Victorian TAB
to work as productively as it has. Its
example inspired other State Govern-
ments, but none of them has found the
going as steady as Victoria. New South
Wales’ immediate discovery, for in-
stance, was that TAB shops over-
crowded quickly. The N.S.W. general
manager, Mr. J. P. Robertson, stated
clearly in November last year: “We
underestimated the demand.”
The problem of
closing time
One of the key SP advantages in this
racing civil war is its ability to receive
bets right up to the race. Hence TABs
have desperately been attempting to
reduce the restrictions on this subject.
Until 1966, N.S.W. closing time was
40 minutes before the race, as was Vic-
toria’s. That year N.S.W., with a
streamlining of clerical processes, re-
duced it to 30 minutes, while the Vic-
torian and Queensland TABs retain the
40-minute period.
The problem of
filling in forms
A related question to this is TAB’s
methods of receiving bets and paying
the dividends.
In Victoria, one sheet is used for all
races, horses, and tracks and is received
and handled by the counter-girl at 250
forms per hour. In N.S.W., the system
is harder on the punter; he must fill
in different forms for every bet, race,
and track, but his forms are handled by
machines at 400 per hour. The N.S.W.
method has resulted in long queues and
has, according to reports, substantially
aided SP. The new $2 million com-
puters to commence operation in Vic-
toria soon will speed up both the
method of receiving bets and of paying
after the race. The Canberra TAB, the
chairman of the A.C.T. Advisory
Council stated bluntly in late 1965,
was “not providing the services which
were provided by the illegal SP and
the main reason for this is that it does
not pay out immediately.” Computer-
isation of pay-out would reduce times
from days (in some cases) or hours (in
others) to 10 to 15 minutes after the
race. This would enable punters to bet
with winnings received the same day.
The problem of
unpaid dividends
The N.S.W. TAB, up till September
last year, was holding some 685,000
tickets worth $630,000 in unclaimed
dividends since the beginning of the
N.S.W. tote in December, 1964. The
question of distribution of this amount
remains open and there seems no way of
ensuring that winning punters are not
cheated of their rewards.
In addition to these there are three
problems from eternal enemies:
The problem of
the churches
Protestant Church opposition to TAB
has varied with district and State. It
has been more effective in upper-
income suburbs than others. In N.S.W.
this opposition was well organised, in
some areas combining with local coun-
cils (as in Waverley) to disrupt TAB
plans and in others appealing above
council heads (as in Manly) to push
TAB offices out of sight of hotels,
churches, and banks. In most cases it
has failed dismally. In Adelaide, how-


ever, the Churches are stronger and the
Government has shown its sensitivity to
their interests by carefully selecting
TAB shop sites.
The problem of
suburban councils
Suburban council objections to TAB
offices have been of two types: from
the established prestige suburbs there
have been moral cries about lowering
the tone and quality of the area; and
from the young “working-class” suburbs
have come practical protests about the
effects on commerce in their suburb.
In Sydney, councils have been, to a
large degree, successful in slowing TAB
growth, bogging the TAB people down
in endless discussions over sites, rents,
and sizes of branches. In the first three
years in Sydney, TAB received 400
council protests and paid out $7OOO in
rent for premises which it had bought
but could not occupy because of coun-
cil obstruction tactics.
The problem of
robberies
Since its inception in 1961, Victorian
TAB has lost over $70,000 in robberies.
In early 1966 it hired a former Homi-
cide Squad authority to organise a new
svstem of security for TAB offices. Some
days later, despite new warning systems
and other paraphernalia, another rob-
bery occurred, almost in mockery.
Armed hold-ups have not significantly
decreased since the introduction of the
new system and the problem remains.
As well as these, a third set of prob-
lems has come from internal wrangles.
The problem
of profits
There is no doubt that TAB is in-
variably a financial boon for racing in-
terests. It follows that distribution of
profits provokes power struggles. The
usual method is for TAB and the Gov-
ernment to work out classifications
within which certain racing clubs may
receive portions of the profits and this
then passes into the hands of the gal-
loping, greyhound, and trotting authori-
ties to administer each year. In N.S.W.,
the classifications were for the inclusion
of all except “picnic and charity clubs.”
The distinctions become sticky in the
case of tiny country galloping clubs.
N.S.W.’s Wallabadah Jockey Club
recently became newsworthy when it
looked as though the Australian Jockey
Club would not recommend to TAB
that it receive its former share of profits
($271 for 1965-66) this year. Specific
details are needed for an unambiguous
distribution system.
The problem of
on-course bets
Rumors have it that the racing clubs
are concerned that continued steady
growth by TAB will begin to diminish
the size of the on-course betting in-
dustry. As in South Australia for the
past four years, it is the racing clubs
which are the prime pushers for TAB
it inevitably means for them huge
increases in prizemoney, an expanded
breeding industry, and attractive
amenities for the punting public. Thus
Tony Kennedy in the Melbourne “Age”
assumes to speak for many when he
speaks of TAB’s “avaricious bid for all
punters”: racing clubs must remain
on dictating terms to TAB and not vice-
versa. TAB services were designed to
eat into SP territory, not into on-course
betting. Similarly, racing clubs rightly
become fearful when they see TAB
operating costs climbing and club
profits dwindling Victoria being the
startling example.
The problem
of SP
The anti-SP war has not always been
carried out with fervor and attrition. In
Queensland, each annual TAB report
highlights the extent of its strength as
an impediment to TAB growth. The
same with N.S.W. There have been in-
numerable reports of SP plots and, even
where these have been verified by TAB
agents, M.P.s, and police, as in Wol-
longong (N.S.W.), neither the Govern-
ment nor the police have been able to
crack the network. In Wollongong,
N.S.W., TAB manager Robertson re-
ported: “You can go to certain sites in
the Wollongong area just after a race
and see men streaming out like ants.”
In Sydney suburbs SP shops thrive only
60 feet away from TAB shops. It is
plainly a myth that the convenience of
TAB shops spells death for the SP
bookie.
Basically, the continued success of
SP has been due to the unplanned
nature of the TAB struggle against it.
TAB has not been structurally designed
to replace SP. Anti-SP forays are
threatened now and again, police blitzes
occur immediately after the setting-up
of a TAB office in an area, and then
there is a clear stretch of relatively un-
restricted competition between TAB
and SP. In this situation, the SP, mainly
through its phone service, comes out
on top. As one prominent interstate
bookmaker put it last July: “The TAB
cannot compete with the facilities
offered by its illegal counterparts”
starting-price bets, commissions on
wagers, no queues or forms, phone
credits, personal contact, and tips.
The manifest advantages of TAB to
all to the Government in revenue, to
the racegoer in amenities, to the owners
in studs, training, and prizemoney, to
the off-course punter in higher divi-
dends make it a necessity. There is,
however, little to be gained by inflating
the abilities and role of TAB in regard
to SP betting unless, of course, the
Walsh Government is simply attempting
to do a sleight-of-hand with the influ-
ential Adelaide religious establishment.


Western Australia: SYMPTOM
OF A NATIONAL DISEASE
By DON LIPSCOMBE
DISENCHANTMENT with Canberra
in the West is getting worse. For the
moment it is still partly a war of nerves.
But it could become a political, econ-
omic, and constitutional crisis. So far,
it is rather like a vague itch that has
barely been scratched, let alone located
or diagnosed. To the State’s political
leaders, however, this Western Aus-
tralian itch is part of a national disease
which breaks out in different States in
different ways, but always starting in
Canberra.
Charles Court has said that the Com-
monwealth doctrine of the status quo
will force Western Australia to drag its
feet to keep back with the field. He said
this in the West, then he repeated it in
a swing through eastern States’ captials,
and specifically to the American
Chamber of Commerce in Australia. He
says: “We are making the cash registers
in the eastern States tinkle . . . and
$4OO million isn’t a bad tinkle in one
year, either . . . but, without our rate
of development, much of the develop-
ment now taking place in N.S.W. and
Victoria would have been impossible.
There’s been a lot of cockeyed thinking
about the so-called assistance to Western
Industrial Development Minister
Charles Court
Australia. The boot is on the other foot.
We carry a good proportion of the
eastern States on our back.”
Premier David Brand brought the
same message back from the last Loan
Council meeting, when he told 'his
political colleagues that the whole of the
Federal-State scheme needed a severe
shake-out; the alternative was to retard
development that benefits the whole
nation.
State leaders blame Western Aus-
tralian parliamentary representatives in
Canberra for this. They can point out
that, since the death of Sir Shane Palt-
ridge, none of their Canberra men has
been willing to stand up and be counted
as a Western Australian. But Charles
Court takes the issue further than this,
finding a parallel to the problems of the
West in the troubles of Victoria and
N.S.W., and all from the same cause
■ — a choking-off of Federal develop-
ment funds. “Theirs is a problem of
congestion, ours is of dispersion and
belated development. While we have
development pressure, Victoria and
N.S.W. also suffer very real budgetary
plights. This is a national problem.”
Politicians have done remarkably
little to let Western Australians know
how they see things. Sir Henry Bolte
has managed to regain stature by
letting his Victorian electors know
exactly what he thinks of Canberra, but
Western Australian bitterness is being
bottled up at a time when the ruling
Liberal Party is being plagued by
“image meetings,” with several branches
so concerned with the Party’s slipping
image that they have called meetings
specifically to explore the problem.
It is part of the Western Australian
dilemma that this entails some delicate
manoeuvring. Leaders of this adolescent
State can whisper that Canberra, not
Perth, is to blame. But they don’t yell.
Canberra still pays their allowance.
Federal Members keep silent. Mr.
Brand is not anxious for this to become
a public dispute. It is largely Mr. Court
who gets the blame in Liberal circles for
spreading the word. Backed by a 'Sub-
stantial private practice, he is making
less as a professional politician than he
could as a chartered accountant. He
can afford to give free rein to his
natural aggression. But he is handi-
capped by having spoken out many
times against what he sees as an anti-
West bias in Canberra.
State thinking at present is that the
financial apron strings can be cut far
sooner than expected, even within five
years. If the word “secession” did not
have such emotive and slightly comical
overtones, there is no doubt that it
would now be heard more often in
Perth. Dr. Guy Henn, MLA, opening
the Young Liberal Movement confer-
ence, spoke kindly of the secession con-
cept (before he made his bring-back-
the-brothels call). As Mr. Court says:
“The feeling here is not exactly the
same as just before we started talking
secession, but it has many of the
same ingredients. We are more sophis-
ticated than we were in the wild
colonial days. Perhaps we wouldn’t go
throwing tomatoes at a Prime Minister
as we did then. The modern ground-
Premier David Brand
swell of discontent is not so brash or so
blatant . . . but it’s there nonetheless,
and strong. It may even be proved to
be more dangerous and insidious.”
To Mr. Court in public and Mr.
Brand in private, the dilemma boils
down to a simple alternative —a
rejuvenated Federal system, or unifica-
tion with all power centred on Can-
berra. “We are at a crossroads,” Mr.
Court says, “so let’s make it clear which
way we are heading. There has been
more watering-down of the Federal
system in the past 16 years than ever
before. I believe it would be a tragedy
to weaken the system further. This
State finds it difficult enough under
the Federal system, but the Lord help
us if it ever came to unification.
Western Australia would become an
outpost, a milch cow.”
It has been pointed out in other
States that the Federal loan debt has
been diminishing while the States’ loan
debt has been rising, pointing up the
inequity of the present system and the
increasing encroachment of Canberra.
“The problem came to a head when
Western Australia was forced to impose
a new stamp duty,” Mr. Court says.
“The people have had enough of this
kind of thing.” A Western Australian
industrialist has warned: “With another
dose like the stamp-duty medicine, the
Commonwealth can expect sharper
public reaction. It won’t only be from
the Labor States. They can’t go on
producing new irritants.” Some rather
hope that the Western Australian des-
peration measure will be challenged and
found to be ultra vires; such a constitu-
tional showdown would light up the
gap in development financing, and per-
haps fire the conservatives who prefer
not to embarrass the Federal Govern-
ment.
Mr. Court does not go this far, but
he maintains that it would be more
simple and honest to renegotiate the
whole formula of Federal-State financial
arrangements. This, he says, would be
welcomed by all States and would
benefit the nation. Mr. Holt has
rejected a plea from the States for
extended taxing rights. This leaves
Western Australia the alternative of new
sorties into the doubtful fringe areas
of taxation, or a call for a slow-down
at a time when expansion is not only
beneficial but vital. There must be some
other way out of this dilemma.


OVERSEAS
Trading with our neighbors:
Singapore and Malaysia
By PETER SAMUEL
MALAYSIA AND SINGAPORE are
an exception to almost every rule con-
ventionally held to apply to the econ-
omies of underdeveloped countries.
They are run by scrupulously honest
administrations and well organised
along the best British lines unlike
many other former British colonies. The
difficult process of diverting the essen-
tially negative energies of the nation-
alist and anticolonialist movements into
the quite different work of nation-
building and economic development
seems to be succeeding. Both stand out
as islands of economic liberalism in an
underdeveloped world which lurches
toward the autarchic attempt to build
the whole range of modern industries
behind walls of high tariffs. And their
concern with planning does not limit
the role of private business.
Singapore is, of course, the most
avowedly democratic-socialist country
of Asia. Its architectural efforts and
budgetary funds are lavished on multi-
storeyed workers’ housing blocks, while
Malaysia has put its prestige money
into a magnificent airport, expressways,
a war memorial, parliament buildings,
and a national mosque. The Singapore
Government provided most of the
money for the recently completed trade
union confederation headquarters, sym-
bolically one of the city-state’s largest
office blocks. Malaysia stresses social
welfare and harmony between its
various groups and classes, rather than
selecting organised labor for special
patronage. But in the case of both,
whether it be Singapore socialism or
Malaysian welfarism, there are no
Marxian obsessions with government
ownership. Private business, foreign as
well as local, is to provide the basis for
economic development.
The two countries also have, in the
jargon, an excellent infrastructure
roads, railways, communications. Ports
are the complication, of course. Singa-
pore’s, one of the world’s busiest, is
hardly infrastructure; it is more in the
nature of basic industry. Malaysia,
partly out of silly nationalism, but with
a degree of economic sense, is develop-
ing three ports down the coast of the
peninsula. But transport and communi-
cations are generally so well developed
that it has been found possible to reduce
expenditure drastically on new projects,
so that funds will be available for more
directly productive fields like land de-
velopment.
Australian trade with the two
countries is already relatively high and
it has been growing steadily. Exports
to both countries have risen from about
ssom. in 1960 to around s9om. this
year. Together they are easily our
iargest market in Asia after the two
giants, Japan and China. The 12 mil-
lion people in Singapore and Malaysia
buy more than India with its 500 mil-
lion people, and ten times as much as
Indonesia with its 110 million. Our
sales are a fairly typical cross-section
of our overall export list, with the un-
derstandable exception being that we do
not sell them much wool. Wheat and
flour are the biggest item, our meats,
sugar, and fruit also being important;
among manufactured items, refined
oils, a few Holdens, and a small miscel-
lany of industrial products from Victa
motor-mowers to copies of THE
BULLETIN. Every now and then an
Australian firm manages to pick up a
machinery contract. For instance, the
Alexandria firrp Mathieson and
Waters Pty. has sold sets of automatic
steam boilers to two hospitals in
Malaysia recently.
Together with imports of ssom. —-
consisting of rubber, timber, spices, and
crude oil -- we are Malaysia-
Singapore’s fourth trading partner, after
Britain, U.S., and Japan. We are ahead
of big world traders like Germany,
Italy, and France.
This is largely a heritage of the past,
of links through common Britishness,
excellent communications, a common
language and institutions. Several Aus-
tralian firms have manufactured there
for three decades now and many Aus-
tralian traders have agencies there.
Given a relatively strong present trad-
ing position, we are unlikely to make
any great breakthroughs. Our trade
will depend on the competitiveness of
our industries and their ability to adapt
to changes in the market.
With living standards the highest in
Asia outside Japan, the two countries
are a worthwhile market. Income per
capita is $5OO a head in Singapore and
$3OO in Malaysia, against the $l2O
average for all Asia, Japan excluded.
With the two economies growing at be-
tween five and seven percent a year
and intending to expand on the basis
SINGAPORE... “multi-storeyed
workers’ housing blocks ”
MALAYSIA... “prestige buildings”
of international trade, they offer sound
prospects for growth.
Both countries are taking strong
measures to maintain the momentum
of national development. From an in-
vestment ratio to GNP of nine percent
in colonial times, Malaysia is now
ploughing back some 20 percent of its
production. A s6oom. a year develop-
ment plan is now in its second year.
Its main emphasis is on expanding and
making more competitive its great ex-
port product, rubber, through a vigor-
ous program of replanting with high-
yielding trees. One hundred and fifty
thousand acres of jungle will be cleared
for settlement, a third for rubber, and
two-thirds for oil palm, the big new
export product. Fertiliser consumption
is still very low and Australia might be
able to sell this.
Timber production is to be expanded
and there is great potential for pro-
cessing of pulp and paper, plywood and
furniture. Therefore for the sale of all


the machinery which this requires.
Singapore has a $160m.-a-year develop-
ment program, designed to generate a
growth of five percent in the economy.
At present both countries are under-
developed in their industry, even by
the standards of the underdeveloped
countries. They have nothing to com-
pare with the range of manufacturing
which has been built up in the past
decade in Taiwan, South Korea, and
Hong Kong, or even the Philippines
and Thailand. In both, only ten per-
cent are employed in secondary in-
dustry. Singapore is now going in for
industrialisation in a big way, because
it has no alternative. At present, ten
percent of its workers are employed in
support of the British military base,
whose future is as uncertain as Britain’s
balance of payments. The other sixty
percent are employed in the complex
of services which support the city’s
entrepot trading functions.
Lee’s Government is taking no risks
with this aspect of the small nation’s
economic life, spending a great deal
on modernising the harbor to adapt it
to containerisation. But as they develop
independently, Malaysia, Indonesia,
and Singapore’s other neighbors are
likely to develop their own trading and
commercial institutions and facilities.
Being needed less for its entrepot func-
tions, Singapore will have to go in for
industrialisation. That, of course, is
started. At Jurong, to the west of the
city, mile after mile of jungle is being
cleared and red hills levelled by bull-
dozers to provide sites.
The causeway confrontation, as the
dispute with Malaysia has been called,
has cast a shadow of doubt over the
future of Singapore’s industrialisation
plans just at a time when they were
approaching the testing stage. Jurong
is still mainly factory sites rather than
factories. Tariff barriers, plus Malay-
sia’s determination to develop industry
of its own, mean that this market of
ten million is no longer available as
a secure proposition. On this basis
many a pessimistic tale of woe has been
told, and a grim future for Singapore
predicted. But it is arguable that, even
within Malaysia, Singapore would not
have been able to have all the market.
Such is the determination of Malays to
nurture their own business, and such is
the strength of mainland regional
political pressures, that significant in-
dustrialisation on the mainland of
Malaysia would almost inevitably have
been encouraged and protected from
Singapore’s efforts.
So, on any realistic assessment, Singa-
pore has always had to build its future
on international trade, going well be-
yond Malaysia for its markets. Like
Britain and Japan in their phases of
rapid expansion on the basis of trade,
Singapore will industrialise as fast as
the skill of its innovators, the initiative
of its businessmen, and the general
world market for manufactured exports.
This last item is raised as the great
question mark. It is quite possible that
the present Kennedy Round of tariff-
cutting talks will fail completely; the
European Community and the U.S. may
become increasingly introverted, and
schemes for helping the underdeveloped
in their trade may fall through.
But, historically, trade in manufac-
tured goods has shown itself remark-
ably capable of overcoming protective
barriers, and it is arguable that if even
the worst of economic illiberalism
eventuates, trade in manufactures will
continue to grow, if at a slower rate
than otherwise.
So the suggestion that Singapore may
somehow collapse into poverty and mass
unemployment seems to be vastly ex-
aggerated, even as a statement of the
worst eventualities. The small nation’s
purposeful administration and business
skills are well proven, and so it should
be able to adapt and make a living
even in a difficult environment.
Australia should be able to share in
this, provided we accept that Singa-
pore may have to resort to hard
bilateral bargaining and insisting on re-
ciprocal concessions to provide access
for its products into Australia. Our
trade will grow if we encourage Austra-
lian business to invest in Singapore
industry. ACI, Humes, Kiwi Polish,
Brady’s Plasterboard, and ARC are
Australian firms who successfully manu-
facture there already, and provide
markets for Australian equipment, parts,
and semi-processed materials. More
would ensure that trade developed
further.
Malaysia is in less of a hurry to
industrialise. Its Government spokes-
men are liable to statements like: “In-
dustrial development will be left en-
tirely to private enterprise” and “we
are not pushing industrialisation at any
cost.” They hardly indicate any great
urgency. A perspective plan for the
development of the economy shows in-
dustry growing from 16 percent of the
economy now to 22 percent in 1975,
stabilising at this relatively low pro-
portion. So Malaysia should con-
tinue to provide an excellent market
for finished manufactures. Its emphasis,
on agriculture may, however, reduce its
importance as a market for our food
products. Recently its food production
has been rising by six percent annually,
the highest rate in Asia.
Elections in Vietnam
IF AUSTRALIANS reckon they pay
dearly for democracy in many tiresome
trips to the polling booths each year,
they might reflect on the voting de-
mands which now face the South Viet-
namese people. Some of them will have
as many as seven sets of elections this
year for village councils, province
councils, mayors, province chiefs, and
now three sets of national elections. On
September 3 they will vote for a Presi-
dent, the next day for 60 members
of a senate, and a month later for 200
representatives in the lower house of
the National Assembly.
When the present Prime Minister,
Nguyen Cao Ky, announced last spring
that there would be elections for an
assembly to draft a constitution, fol-
lowed quickly by democratic elections,
there was considerable scepticism—and
not only from those who make it their
business to belittle the South Viet-
namese. Things went unexpectedly well
from the beginning, with the elections
conducted very successfully, 70 percent
of the population participating in what
were generally regarded as fair and
honest voting arrangements. The
elected members proved independent
and determined that their constitution
drafting should not allow the military
to dictate the form of government
which would develop.
Points of dispute quickly became
apparent, and as recently as a month
ago it was being said that the ruling
directory would try to use its limited
veto powers to get the constitution it
wanted. The pessimists were proved
wrong by several weeks of private
bargaining between the military and
the assembly-men, which resulted in the
constitution promulgated last week. The
document is a triumph for the drafters,
since it is clear that most of the con-
cessions were made by the directory.
The executive is to be much more
directly responsible to the legislature
than the directory had proposed: it caa
be dismissed at any time by a two-thirds
majority of the Parliament. The dir-
ectory’s demand for a 12-month period
of immunity, to promote stronger gov-
ernment and greater stability, was
dropped.
Military men are not permitted to
participate in party politics and on
appointment to public office must either
be demobilised or take leave, relinquish-
ing their field office and their salary.
The directory had wanted the Gov-
ernment to retain power to appoint
province chiefs, the assembly insisting
on popular elections. The outcome is
that, in all but insecure areas, there
will be a vote, and where the war
makes this impossible Government
appointments will be subject to parlia-
mentary approval.
In all, it is a thoroughly representa-
tive set-up with a complex of checks
and balances. The deficiencies may in
practice prove to be that, in striving
to make the system fully representative
and responsible, risks may be taken
with the continuity of government.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Very replete with fixtures
By A. McKEE-WRIGHT
THE CLUNE GALLERIES have
moved to 171 Macquarie Street, Syd-
ney, to what w r as described in 1839 as
“a very pleasant and healthy residence
. . . very replete with fixtures, being
hung with bells, fitted up with side-
boards . . . and commanding a most
delightful view.”
In the ensuing 128 years, Horbury
Terrace, of which it is part, went
through many vicissitudes, including the
demise of the Spanish Consul in 1869,
who for reasons unknown hurled him-
self out of a side window. In its best
days Viscount Sherbrooke lived there
for a while, and later Sir John Frank-
lin’s widow waited for news in the
sunny rooms. In its “going down” days
rather blowsy ladies were reputed to
live there, but respectability returned to
it when it became a nurses’ club.
Other sections of the terrace were
gradually sold off. Three houses were
removed to give way to the building
called “Wyoming,” and the Australian
Club Annexe took over another. Finally,
only the two central ones were left, one
of them housing a bank, and the other
bought years ago by newspaper owner
the late Ezra Norton for the nucleus
of some dream of skyscrapers which
never eventuated. This was good luck
for Frank McDonald of Clune Galleries,
who fell under the spell of the old
[?] Aboil Kuslnuthrs Hay. 1846, by Conrad Martens
house as soon as he saw it. He had
always felt that the suburban Australian
gallery must in time give way to the
more sophisticated central city gallery,
close to the source of money and just
a step away from the big hotels, since
this is the pattern everywhere else in
the world.
Now he has four storeys as close to
the heart of the city as possible. The
gallery is on the ground-floor level with
a smaller gallery below, a third-floor
sitting-room provides an elegant setting
for discussing large sums of money
and there is still room for a private
flat right at the top.
“I had all sorts of ideas for doing
up the gallery cheaply when I started,”
McDonald said. “You know, polished
floors and stripped back walls and so
forth. But the interior of the building
was in bad shape, and I saved nothing
on polishing the floors, because I had
to lay down new floors in order to
polish them! New walls, too,” he added
gloomily.
Despite the cost, which was obviously
Australian Landscape with Cattle and
Stockman at a Creek, 1839, also by
Conrad Martens
considerable, the Clune Galleries were
worth doing up. McDonald followed an
old drawing of the original terrace in
order to get back the 1839 feeling, and
this meant that all but one of the win-
dows had to be replaced.
He contrived the main gallery by
removing a wall and fireplace from the
usual twin living-room arrangement of
the terrace period, and this produced
a long room about 35ft. x 13ft. The
walls are covered in beige linen and
will be “replete with fixtures” of metal
rods and hooks so that the pictures
can be arranged anywhere very simply.
A trapdoor in the floor pertnits paint-
ings to be dropped down directly to the
rack-room below. The office is painted
a rich green to give the effect of a cave
away from all the lighting in the main
gallery.
The little gallery is below street level


and will probably be used for small
showings or less important exhibitions.
Behind it is the rack-room and
kitchen.
. The third-floor sitting-room has a
wonderful view out across the Botanic
Gardens and the Harbor, and by cran-
ing slightly from the minute balconies
the Opera House can be seen at the
end of the street. This room, which has
a marble mantel brought from England,
could be used for large-scale entertain-
ing as well as giving VIP treatment to
important clients.
Frank McDonald’s own small flat has
a pitched roof with the beams showing,
which gives it an A-frame feeling high
above Macquarie Street.
A few days before the scheduled first
show, which was of eight paintings by
19th-century artist Conrad Martens,
McDonald was still surrounded by
chaos, and every inch of the building
seemed filled with pots of paint, bolts of
linen, paste, timber, tools, and methodi-
cally active workmen, dedicated to the
“she’ll be right, mate” theory. Though
wild-eyed with nerves, Frank McDonald
clung to his opening date and “she was
right.” On the day the gallery doors
opened to the serenity of “that very
pleasant and healthy residence” and
Macquarie Street seemed to be a very
good place indeed for a gallery.
Music
Festival formula
By PAUL FROLICH
A YEAR AGO when I reported on the
Easter Chamber Music Festival at
Mittagong, N.S.W., I wasn’t quite sure
what a festival was; since then Fve
attended over a dozen music festivals,
and now I am sure: I don’t know what
a festival should be. However, I know
a few of the things that a festival
should not be. It should not be in a
large city; it should not be completely
exhausting; it should not be limited to
just one kind of entertainment; it
should not have too much social status,
and it should not be above self-
criticism.
The Musica Viva Society’s 1967
effort generally observed all these
maxims, although some, even including
listeners who like Mozart, may consider
the inclusion of five of his works among
a total of 22 rather excessive. Apart
from this, and the scarcity of recent
works, the fare was varied enough, and
it was purveyed by a record number of
performers of high standard.
Once again, some 200 music-lovers
of all ages and from many parts
crowded into the Frensham College
dormitories and dining hall and filled
Lauris Elms
the splendid Clubbe Hall. This fine
concert hall, which was not quite com-
pleted a year ago, has now proved its
worth; it is comfortable, well heated,
and provides agreeable enough acous-
tics. The hall has a small organ, especi-
ally built by Walcker of Germany; of
only seven stops and equipped with
attractive wooden Bft. pipes, it is cap-
able of producing a true baroque sound,
and was put through some splendid
tests in a Mass by Victoria, a Requiem
by Schutz, and works by Corelli,
Mozart, and Bach. Organists Leon
Stemler and Werner Baer proved the
instrument’s versatility, and Fve no
doubt that greater familiarity with its
range will enable them and others to
give listeners many happy hours of
authentically played baroque music.
The core of the Mittagong festival
is, of course, chamber music in the form
of trios, quartets, quintets, but this
year’s entertainment went beyond this
frame. Participating performers includ-
ed the highly accomplished Leonine
Consort led by Charles Colman and
including the redoubtable voice of
recently returned Marilyn Richardson.
Their performance of Schutz’s “Ger-
man Requiem” of 1636, a human,
warm, and earthly humorous work
despite its title, was quite splendid, and
also drew attention to yet another gifted
young musician, cellist Nathan Waks,
who contributed the continuo.
Equally welcome was the participa-
tion of contralto Lauris Elms. With
Margaret Schofield as competent
accompanist, she sang Schumann’s
“Frauenliebe” cycle and, on the final
morning of the festival, gave me my
first hearing of Lennox Berkeley’s
“Four Poems of St. Teresa of Avila,”
yet another English masterpiece of great
beauty; in this she was accompanied by
a scratch string orchestra conducted by
Robert Pikler, an ensemble which
acquitted itself most creditably.
Other events outside the usual cham-
ber music routine included an un-
rehearsed performance of Haydn’s
“Toy” symphony, conducted by Ernest
Llewellyn, the players in which in-
eluded Frensham girls and staff and
anyone who could be drafted to bang,
blow, or ring something, and a panel
discussion on the subject “What do we
want from a hall?” The panel consisted
of two acousticians and three musicians,
and the discussion, in which the audi-
ence took part, suggested that a hall to
satisfy everyone may never be built.
The real business of the Festival,
chamber music, occupied the greater
part of our four days at Mittagong. The
ensembles taking part were the Czech
Smetana Quartet, in Australia for the
third time, the N.S.W. Conservatorium’s
Sydney String Quartet, the Austral
Quartet from Sydney, the Cremona
String Quartet from Melbourne, the
Tonalwood Trio from New Zealand,
and a number of individual players in-
cluding oboists Jiri Tancibudek and
Claire Fox, cellist Lois Simpson, viol-
inists Robert Davidovici and John
Harding among others.
The Smetana Quartet, rightly re-
garded as one of the world’s finest
groups, are known for their unique
ensemble work, playing the whole of
their repertoire from memory. On this
occasion, they afforded us the oppor-
tunity of hearing Beethoven’s Opus 130
with the “Grosse Fugue,” the original
final quartet movement. They succeeded
in this gigantic enterprise beyond all
expectation; even more enchanting was
their superb reading of Haydn’s “Lark”
Quartet, the adagio of which breathed
so perfectly as to leave the audience
motionless. Joined by four of our
players, they gave an excellent account
of the rarely heard Mendelssohn Octet,
a delightful work; also, with Tanci-
budek, they gave a fine performance of
Mozart’s Oboe Quartet, with Robert
Pikler they played the testing and beau-
tiful Mozart String Quintet K. 593 and,
not satisfied with all that, they led a
group of young Sydney players through
a workshop performance of Mozart’s
Dissonant Quartet, an experience which
the youngsters will not soon forget and
from which they are bound to have
benefited immeasurably.
The Sydney String Quartet showed
that they have truly come of age.
Every bit as good as the world-famous
Smetana, they gave wholly enthralling
readings of Beethoven’s Second
Rasoumovsky and Bartok’s Fifth
Quartet. There might still be some
argument on minor questions of
interpretation, but I am prepared to
accept their performance of the
Beethoven as one of the very finest I
have heard.
The Cremona Quartet our old
friends, the Glickman Trio, with
violinist Leonard Dommett as their
new leader -- contributed a very
beautiful reading of Schubert’s “Death
and the Maiden” Quartet in a wholly
committed performance of great taste.
With Margaret Schofield, they played
Shostakovich’s Piano Quintet, long a
favorite of mine and rarely heard to
greater advantage.
The Austral Quartet, members of
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, con-


tributed a breath of modernity. Intro-
duced by leader Donald flazelwood,
they demonstrated and played Elliot
Carter’s 2nd String Quartet. Not so
much a quartet as a dramatic con-
versation between the four instruments,
this difficult work proved dramatically
convincing.
New Zealand’s Tonalwood Trio
consists of three youngsters who won
the trip to Mittagong as prize in a
chamber-ensembles competition; they
proved to be talented and sensitive
players of great promise.
The final “surprise” concert, to
which I have already referred, also
included the first Australian perform-
ance of a piano quartet written by
Gustav Mahler as a 16-year-old
student. Though wholly Brahmsian in
character and not at all revealing as
a proof of Mahler’s latent greatness,
it was a curio of some interest.
Television
Deep confusion
By FRANK ROBERTS
AS REPORTED BY one of THE
BULLETIN’S columnists a few weeks
ago, Pierre Cardin’s visit was no ordin-
ary affair, involving a good deal of con-
fusion all round. The impression was
confirmed and the confusion deepened
by an item which reached our television
last week called “Cardin in
Australia.” This report of that event
will not reduce the confusion one bit.
Visually, it was good, on a par with
French television’s “Festival” on ABC-
TV. Director Peter Thompson and
cameraman Bill Constable caught the
mood and conveyed it well; but it was
the hectic mood of fashion being
squired by a talented, skittery gentle-
man under the auspices of the dizzy side
of the Australian Wool Board, the
branch concerned with promotion,
which it sees only in terms (to close
the circle) of Fashion.
If I catch their mood correctly, the
men who own the sheep which produce
the wool are sold on research, to a
point, but are as bemused as anyone
when confronted with some of the ex-
travaganzas of models, million-
candlepower lights, society, costly gar-
ments, pop music, and canapes which
Nan Sanders and her retinue conjure
up for them, with repeated assurances
that this sells their wool to us.
“Cardin in Australia” was probably
the conjuring to end them all,
because it not only presented the whole
of the parts of one long act down
eastern Australia but also involved the
further magic of talking the ABC into
filming the whooptedo at great expense,
with a cast of thousands, if one includes
the sheep.
At a guess, the basis for the magic
was explained by one of the retinue,
Terry O’Keefe, soon after Pierre hit
Longreach. Mr. O’K. said the idea was
to explain to the growers how and why
the promoters were spending their
funds. One could imagine the ABC
accepting that as a matter of intense
national interest, even though it did
not fulfil that other concern of the
Commission, to present both sides of
every question - which I feel it must
now be obliged to do, if only in the
manner of the “Omo” man: “Mrs.
Smith, what do you think of wool?”
In the Cardin epic we saw him in
Sydney looking at the Opera House,
shots from his appearance on Hazel
Phillips’ “Girl Talk,” at a Sydney
reception surrounded by belles dames
and designers (“Did you understand
that, boy?”), shots of sheep with the
debatable comment, behind, that “a
substantial amount of wool goes into
clothes ... if there wasn’t fashion we
couldn’t sell the huge amounts we do”;
and more shots of Cardin in a wool
store, at another dinner; of models in
slow motion; of Cardin landing by
plane; a flash of couturier Zara Holt;
and finally of sheep dogs and more
sheep.
All of this failed to convince me that
it was worthwhile television, proper
ABC material, or anything better than
a long and flashy free ad. for the wool
promoters. Certainly it would be proper
for ABC-TV to look into this fascinat-
ing aspect of a great industry, but not
this way, with uncritical adulation.
Art
Shadowed World
By ELWYN LYNN
Fred Williams, Etchings. Rudy Komon
Gallery, Sydney.
John Dallwitz. Barry Stein Galleries,
Sydney.
Donald Brook. Gallery A, Melbourne.
LONG BEFORE the recent brouhaha
about printmaking with its concomitant
errors that artists should be able to do
everything and that any real artist can
produce miracles (cheap, too) on his
first encounter with a lithographic
block, Fred Williams of Victoria was
etching, engraving, and aquatinting
with singular conviction. The 100
etchings at Komon’s, each a dark and
distant delight, trace his two-steps-
forward-and-one-back progress from
1954 to 1965, and though in black,
white, grey, and some warm bistre,
reveal a lot about the way he deploys
and marshals color in his paintings.
Why do etchings (apart from the
ease of accurate repetition they allow)
when one can astonish with large oils?
Even when the line in an etching is
tense, crisp, and sharp, and the masses
are solid, the etching evokes a unique,
slightly shadowed, world as though seen
through a glass darkly; it has a remote
immediacy, like an antique that was
never old.
It is the slightly blotted and eroded
line that Williams excels in, but it took
time for him to achieve it. His London
etchings of 1954-56 of Windmill girls,
acrobats, a mad pianist, and actors were
easy with light arabesques, and even
when shapes became more formidable
in “Pregnant Woman” and “The Hair-
cut,” both of 1954, the delineation of a
face had the occasional topicality of a
Toulouse-Lautrec. In a fine work like
“Midget” (1954), where he seeks a
Goyaesque universality, some feet, a la
Degas, intrude at the top an intrusion
he does not allow in the more single-
minded ’sixties.
In rejecting ecole-de-Paris topicality
for universal themes, Williams mastered
his eclecticism with considerable skill:
in “The Metropolitan” (1955-56)
Sickert and Goya blend with surprising
ease; English vaudeville figures in
Goyaesque poses dance with Picasso’s
saltimbanque, but it is rare that the
theme goes beyond mere passing com-
ment as it does with the “Dancer”
(1955-56), whose outstretched arms
held back a black void.
Not until he turned to the landscape
in 1961 did Williams find a vehicle
for his universal themes; without diver-
sion and redundant reportage, from
1961 to 1965 he presented forests and
bushlands, at first as austere verticals
and later as casual, unpremeditated
notations. In 1961-62 he was tracing
vertical trunks, with that occasional
diagonal so revered by Ruisdael and
Corot, stimulated by the trees of
Echuca and Sherbrooke Forest; “State
15, Number 1” of the latter series has
a set of verticals as spare and as tense
as a Mondrian. It was, however, the
forest, that led him to mottle the back-
grounds, like foliage turning to moss.
The obvious kinship with Japanese
landscape influenced his painting not
always happily at the same time.
These etchings had been organised in
an overall pattern like floating soap-
suds, but by 1965 he was seeing the
landscape in another oriental manner:
as dispersed and repetitive. “Circle
Landscape, Upweys” is almost purely
Eastern with its scattered tree nota-
tions beneath a diagonal-diameter
horizon; “Hillside” (1964) has a few
islands of white in black.
They have much of the remoteness
and universality of Eastern art and
something, too, of the single-minded
simplicity of Western miniatures that
always bear detailed examination.
The shapes and colors by John Dall-
witz, of Adelaide, don’t invite scrutiny;
they come out to .meet you. Over
masonite boards with areas like sunken
gardens he paints uniformly colored
circles, squares, oblongs, and u-turns
in bright, sour, or dun hues. A band
is arrested by a sudden hollow and
traverses it, sometimes shifting its direc-
tion actually and sometimes only by an
optical illusion. Sometimes shapes con-


tinue around the painting, but wherever
they go they do so with a Gestaltian
inevitability that is rare in local hard-
edge efforts. These works are more like
flags and unfamiliar highway codes than
symbols. Oddly enough, though Dall-
witz employs the public means of mass
communication, his meaning is private;
Williams inhabits an intensely private
world, but his themes are universal.
That art rises above not what is being
used in the pop-environment but above
what has been discarded is part of
Donald Brook’s thesis in his best work
to date; he uses pieces of discarded
machinery, wheels, rods, and cogs in a
set of dark, welded works, with some
cast figures, in which bodies and forms
and space itself are transfixed by spears
of steel. There is little attempt, in these
highly cerebral works, to enclose, in-
habit, or humanise space; fugitive space
is temporarily captured by rods and
wires. They are crisp, dynamic works,
leaning so far away from a Klippelian
whimsy that they approach macabre
weaponry. Brook, who works in Can-
berra, must be the most unsensuous,
good sculptor around.
Films
Hawaiian slice
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Hawaii. Director, George Roy Hill.
Gone With the Wind. Director, Victor
Fleming.
I GATHER that James Michener’s
novel I never did get round to tack-
ling it deals with the history of
Hawaii from the dawn of time until
the present. The screen version is less
ambitious. When John Huston found it
impossible to present the Scriptures in
one film he called it “The Bible . . .
In The Beginning.” Perhaps George
Roy Hill should have called this
“Hawaii ... In The Middle.”
It deals with the days when the white
man, having discovered the existence
of the islands, introduce the islanders
to religion, venereal disease, Mother
Hubbards, and measles. The dubious
blessings of God and Mammon, it seems,
were almost the ruination of the
islanders, w'ho, until then, had lived
in a state of idyllic, innocent virtue
apart from a slight tendency to marry
their own brothers and sisters, murder
unwanted babies, and, in moments of
stress, gouge out their own eyes and
teeth.
In particular we hear the story of a
fire-and-brimstone missionary who goes
to Hawaii with his bride and has to
live through what seems like centuries
of misfortunes and the deaths of prac-
tically everyone else in the picture be-
fore coming to belated recognition of
a God of love, rather than wrath. The
character is so unsympathetically con-
ceived that it’s not fair to blame Max
von Sydow for not making it more en-
gaging. Julie Andrews fares little better
as the subdued, devoted wife; it’s a dull
role for any actress, and she’s even
denied an on-screen death scene.
That old chestnut “GWTW” is being
presented on a great big screen and with
a newly recorded soundtrack. An
alarming number of years have passed
since I first saw' it, at an age when I
was more romantically inclined, but
even then I strongly suspected that it
was a fine load of codsw'allop. Seen
blown up to several times its original
size which doesn’t do the photog-
raphy any good, incidentally the
enormous triviality of the story is even
more apparent. It was ahvays hard
and is now impossible to feel sentimental
about the “gallantry” of the old South,
its actual preference for lost causes, the
assumption that Negroes at their very
best are lovable, feckless dimwits.
There’s some interest in seeing how'
the acting has stood up to the years.
Vivien Leigh gives a showy, shallow'
performance in a role w'hich after all
is only that of a spoilt, ill-mannered
chit, whose vaunted vitality and
“passion for life” seem to boil down
to rejecting Rhett Butler’s advances;
Clark Gable’s personality still bursts
from the screen with explosive force
they don’t make them like that any
more; and Olivia de Havilland astonish-
ingly brings glowing sincerity to the
unrewarding part of the goody-goody
Melanie. Somehow she makes this
sugary creature warm and alive, which
Julie Andrew's totally fails to do with
a character of similarly unremitting
virtue in “Hawaii”; and since the writ-
ing in both films is pretty terrible, the
difference must come from the actress.
Of course, Olivia de Havilland is
better-looking, which never hurt any-
body; in fact, while Vivien Leigh, as the
irresistible Southern belle, looks noth-
ing more than a pretty little woman,
Miss de Havilland still shines as that
rare thing, an authentic beauty.
Records
A further Falstaff
By JOHN CARGHER
Falstaff (Verdi) Fischer-Dieskau, Liga-
bue, Resnik, Sciutti, Oncina, Kunz,
etc. Viena Philharmonic conducted
by Bernstein; CBS SBR 235186/8.
FOR AN “UNPOPULAR” opera
Falstaff is not doing so badly; this is
the sixth complete recording of the
work. It is also marginally the best yet
and is monumentally rewarding to any-
one w'illing to sit down and listen to
it with a score, or at least the ex-
cellent libretto which is supplied by
the makers, “Falstaff," with one minor
exception, Nanetta’s fairy song, con-
tains none of •.he tunes which make a
popular box-office opera. Instead it is
one of those masterpieces which grow
on one with repeated hearing.
To write a work like Falstaff while
nearing his eightieth birthday was noth-
ing short of miraculous. But the aging
Verdi had a collaborator to whom must
go a large share of the credit. Arrigo
Boito was a major composer in his
own right and therefore understood the
problems of composition as no other
non-musical librettist could. ‘‘Falstaff."
and even more so ‘‘Otello,” remain and
always wall remain the supreme ex-
amples of perfect collaboration between
composer and librettist. Both are based
on Shakespeare originals, but the com-
plexities of extracting Falstaff from the
several Henrys forbade the use of long
passages of literal translation from the
original which made “Otello” a miracle
of almost pure Shakespeare in spite of
the drastic abridgement. Boito may have
improved on Shakespeare by bringing
humanity into the old reprobate knight
in Falstaff but it can be argued that the
Bard should not be “improved.” Never-
theless, purists could not possibly find
fault with Boito’s magnificent theatrical
flair nor Verdi’s un-Verdian interpreta-
tion of the period.
The cast in the new recording is uni-
formly good with Ilva Ligabue’s Mis-
tress Ford and Regina Resnik’s Mistress
Quickly outstanding. But the great sur-
prises of the set are Dietrich Fischer-
Dieskau and Leonard Bernstein. I am
not convincing that the current fashion
of criticising Dieskau is fair. The only
charge which can be made against him
is that he is annoyingly übiquitous.
No matter which way one turns, no
matter which period, no matter which
style or medium, there is that infernal
name again and again and again.
We can tire of even the best artist.
But it is useless to deny that the man
is first-class in anything he tackles. His
fat knight sounds fat, sounds jolly and.
most important in an Italian opera, he
sounds at home in the language he
sings. The only comparable perform-
ance was Gobbi’s and that singer’s
shortcoming was the same as Dieskau’s:
both lack the power for the great
climaxes. Until the day that an artist
of their calibre with an enormous voice
arrives, let us be thankful for the
Gobbis and Dieskaus; I strongly suspect
that both are better than Maurel,
Verdi’s own choice.
As for Mr. Bernstein, the incredible
precision which can be irritating in his
super-American interpretation of the
older classics becomes a positive virtue
in the case of Falstaff,” for this is by
far the most intricate of all Verdi
scores and only attention to the
minutest detail tan bring it to life. Mr.
Bernstein succeeds beyond one’s wildest
expectations. CBS should be con-
gratulated for gambling this set on the
limited Australian market. If their
gamble fails it will be a terrible re-
flection on our musical tastes. I believe
it will not fail.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Bank controls in the melting pot
TRUE, THERE ARE important implications for the de-
velopment of our natural resources in the new Bankers’
Development Refinance Corporation. But that is only part
of the message. The self-congratulatory statements about the
corporation and its role in the “development of Australia’s
vast natural resources” have not mentioned implications of
at least equal importance that have to do with the very
nature of the Australian banking system and the whole basis
of Reserve Bank controls over the banks.
Recent changes in Reserve Bank attitudes to the trading
banks represent some sort of rethinking of the whole system
of controls of the banking system; a rethinking that may not
have ended with the latest arrangements. These appear to he
part of a clearly defined policy of lessening restraint, not just
an ad hoc way of solving the immediate problem of a
shortage of development funds. True, the timing of the
latest arrangements, that will provide so much more local
money for developmental projects, may have been influ-
enced by the U.K. Government’s measures and by the U.S.
Government’s refusal to allow Australia the same “preferred
loan” exemptions from her restrictions on capital exports that
have been granted to Japan and Canada. But this does not
alter the principle behind the decision.
The implications of these latest moves on the matter of
variable lending rates and terms for industrial borrowers
(still not permitted by the Reserve Bank) are not yet clear,
but it seems as if the authorities are moving toward some-
thing of the sort even if they are doing it by other
methods than simply removing direct restraints. In any event,
the authorities at last appear to have realised that it is
clearly in the Reserve Bank’s interests to allow the banking
system to spread back into the areas from which they have
expelled the banks for so many years. For recent history
has so clearly shown that the Reserve Bank managed to
achieve very little in terms of monetary policy by restraining
the activities of the banks while so many non-bank finance
houses could operate in the monetary area completely un-
hampered by official controls.
And the flood of foreign bftnks into Australia through their
taking up large positions in the Australian hire-purchase
industry, where they have been carrying on quasi-banking
operations, meant that the Reserve Bank had cut its own
throat; its tight control of the banks was giving it an ever-
decreasing control of the monetary system as a whole as it
kept the screws of restraint on the banks, this left the other,
uncontrolled, financiers more and more scope for action.
The next step in this drama is to see to what extent the
banks can now win back those sections of the finance area
that have been taken over so thoroughly by the hire-purchase
companies (who now prefer to call themselves finance com-
panies) during the period when the banks could not compete
because the Reserve Bank was so absurdly pretending that
if it stopped a bank from lending money then no one else
would do so. It seems no coincidence that the pace of this
relaxation of controls has speeded up since Mr. William

MEN AND MATTERS
IN THE GOOD OLD days, when any
stockbroker could make a handsome liv-
ing and the price of Sydney seats was
up around the $35,000 mark (instead
of today’s $24,000 or so), favored
clients, investment officers of the big
life assurance companies, and finance
journalists used to eat very well indeed;
even the smallest broker would have a
healthy expense account at a good
restaurant. But most of the brokers’
lunches cut out some time ago; now
only the bigger boys (or some of the
smaller boys pretending they are doing
well) are still such frequent luncheon
hosts. Business is certainly not what it
was and some of the smaller firms have
been feeling it where it hurts.
And now the chairman of the London
Stock Exchange, Mr. R. F. M. Wilkin-
son, has come to Australia to let the
smaller brokers know that, if the Brit-
ish experience is repeated here, their
days are numbered, that their present
difficulties are not just passing ones
but part of a trend away from smaller,
less efficient units in the industry.
Martin Wilkinson, a partner in one of
London’s bigger fir.ms, is all for the
move from smaller to larger broking
units and forecasts that in 10 years the
number of member firms in London will
have fallen from the present 220 to
only 60 or 70.
(They have al-
ready fallen by 50
or so in the past
ten years and sole
traders were abol-
ished three years
ago. In Austra-
lian Exchanges
there are still
plenty of sole
traders, including
the present chair-
man of the Syd-
ney Stock Ex-
change, Mr. K. J. Polkinghorne.) A
man born into the City, 55-year-old
Martin Wilkinson has been a partner
in de Zoete and Gorton for the past 31
years, having entered into partnership
at only 25 three years after becom-
ing a .member.
THERE IS STILL the old family
tradition in most of the big retail stores
around Australia the Lloyd Jones,
the Myers, the Grace brothers, the
Coles, the Haywards, the Marcus
Clarks (oops, sorry), and so on. But
in the old-established Perth store of
Bairds Ltd. the family succession has
been broken by the appointment of one
of Perth’s most successful and little-
known businessmen to the chairman-
ship of the company.
R. F. M. Wilkinson
K. J. Polkinghorne
Peter Reynolds
Last week, when Mr. Neil Baird
resigned the chairmanship of Bairds
Ltd., his place was taken by manag-
ing director Mr. Peter Reynolds. Born
and educated in England, Mr. Reynolds
was a British Army captain, returning
to manage his family’s retailing busi-
ness. He was later a business consultant,
working throughout Europe, before;,
coming to Australia only 10 years ago
on a most modest level in the retailing
world, working with Foy’s. He changed
over in 1959 to the old-fashioned-
family-draper type of store, Bairds
and then came the quick rises.
Mr. Reynolds has piloted the com-
pany through the tricky waters of going
public, and now is continuing a modern-
isation program in both Perth and Fre-
mantle stores.


McMahon became Federal Treasurer. He has some strong
views about banking. But Mr. McMahon’s role should not be
overstated. The Reserve Bank has been moving toward a
more liberal approach to the banks in the past five years,
starting with the term loan arrangements and mounting to
a climax, in recent weeks, of variable interest rates for per-
sonal lending and, now, financing for development.
It is nevertheless important to consider Mr. McMahon’s
role in the latest statement, particularly in view of the
clear impression that comes through from Canberra that
some Treasury people do not like all that their Treasurer
had to say about the scheme one little bit. Some senior
officials take the view that the Treasurer was simply wrong
in one of his statements about the operation of the new
institution. He said the Reserve Bank would “lend to the
corporation amounts proportionate to the loans the corpora-
tion receives from the trading banks.” Since the Reserve
Bank is not to be a shareholder, and therefore to have no
direct control over its operations, such a commitment, they
say, would be an open-ended one. The Reserve Bank would
have to provide matching finance to whatever the trading
banks decided they wanted to lend. Central control over
bank credit would be lost, and monetary policy would go to
pot, they say. But the Reserve Bank would still exercise its
normal supervising role.
These officials have thought it likely that the Reserve Bank
will not enter into a commitment to make matching loans.
They also take the line (and quite properly) that it is a
misconception that the Reserve Bank will relend Statutory
Reserve Deposits to the corporation. These are Reserve Bank
liabilities to the trading banks, money in fact owned by the
banks, and so the Reserve Bank has no power to “lend”
them. The Reserve Bank will, having agreed on the terms
of its lending to the Refinance Corporation, simply allow it
to draw central bank credit, as any other banking institution
does. Statutory Reserve Deposits do not come into the
arrangement.
In a way, this seems a pity. As they now stand, SRDs are
an absurd and inefficient method of controlling the level of
monetary activity in a country where foreign capital is
freely allowed to come and go. There is a case, nevertheless,
for SRDs being used as a technique for redirecting the flow
of money within the community in addition to fulfilling
their normal monetary policy role. No matter what the
purists say, there is no difference between the inflationary
impact of a dollar spent on an Australian developmental
project that comes from “frozen funds” in Australia that were
not being used for anything else and a dollar brought here
as a foreign investment. If SRDs were the funnel through
which excess personal and industrial spending were directed
out of the system and into the projects that would go ahead
anyway (and probably on borrowed funds from abroad),
then the saving on forward commitments to service that
foreign capital would be immense. And at the times when
extra liquidity was needed to stimulate the personal and
industrial sectors, then the Reserve Bank could itself make
direct loans to the banks for on-lending.
In any event, the latest corporation is a good move; it
has always been silly that the banking system has not been
used to support the financing of development projects (con-
tributions so far have been from banks’ own capital funds).
Foreign firms have had an artificial advantage over Australian
firms in having available to them medium- and long-term
bank finance for development projects. The Refinance
Corporation should enable Australian investors to compete
on equal terms at long last. The development of natural
resources is often a predictable investment. Contracts are
negotiated which specify price and quantity, so there is an
assured market; costs are readily determined. Huge amounts
of capital are, of course, required, but the operation is ideally
suited to high-gearing ratio financing a small equity
supported by large lumps of fixed-interest money. This
corporation should have been set up years ago, but better
now than never. Let us hope that Mr. McMahon can get it
working as soon as possible.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Federal Government is
beginning to get its Bankers’ Development Refinance
Corporation off the ground (see the leading article on
page 39).
The public’s Easter spending will probably turn out to
be at the highest level for four years.
New life insurance in 1966 totalled $2807m., a 6.6
percent rise on 1965, which had yielded a 9.5 percent
increase on 1964.
For the markets: Post-Easter trading among in-
vestment sections on Australian share markets lacked
any real bite and the overall index position slipped a
fraction once more; a drooping leader section does not
furnish any direction.
Minor gains among industrials brightened London’s
drabness toward the close; volumes are unremarkable
. . . Glamor issues took the brunt of Wall Street’s end-
of-week decline.
For companies: Apart from B.H.P.’s dividend,
which has been inched up to 9.3333 percent (previously
9.1666 percent) by a 4.75 percent final, it seemed a
retailers’ week . . . Capping the lot, Woolworths pro-
claimed a 1966-67 turnover up by 11 percent to $350.1m.
producing the earlier-announced 6.7 percent profit
advance; net profit as percentage of sales drifts from
2.4 to 2.3 percent . . . On better sales, David Jones
maintained its earnings over seven months to February
and lent unusual lustre to the scene by remarking that
“Easter trading figures have been phenomenal” . . .
Myer Emporium’s N.S.W. subsidiary Farmer’s brought
profit for the half-year to January up by $331,370 to
$1,278,006; the Western Stores offshoot achieved “sub-
stantial” gains in both sales and profits . . . The country’s
largest removalist, Grace Bros., paid cash to acquire
Bullochs Removals and Storage Pty. Ltd., of Perth.
Drink of various degrees didn’t have it quite so uni-
formly . . . Swan Brewery, with a steady 13 percent,
gave preliminary advice of higher 1966-67 results . . .
More diverse R. W. Miller discloses “somewhat lower”
earnings for the December half; trouble came from coal
and tankers, beer is “up to expectations” . . . On the
softer side, Schweppes (Australia) found a 14 percent
sales increase almost offset by rising costs . . . Mel-
bourne’s Tarax had to cut the interim from 6 to 5
percent; “adverse seasonal conditions” struck at both
sales and profit.
Confectioner Life Savers is repeating last year’s buoy-
ancy, practically word for word . . . British Tobacco,
through its Associated Products and Distribution, has
obtained control of Devondale Cream.
Motor dealers are not out in the clear . . . Nissan and
Datsun (Queensland) and Ford (Sydney) distributor
Ira L. & A. C. Berk won’t pay any interim but cherishes
hopes of a final; December’s pre-ta'x profit dropped
“substantially” on 3.03 percent lower sales . . . Preston
Motors, in Melbourne, lost $213,674 in 1966, following
the previous $369,312 profit . . . Sydney’s Hunt Bros, is
to return 10 cents of each 50 cent share as a consequence
of selling the Canberra Ford dealership.
A Roma-Brisbane natural gas contract will bring the
Associated Australian Oilfields group nearly s4om. over
the next 15 years; shareholders .must wait “several years”
for their cut . . . Magellan Petroleum Australia, U.S.-
controlled, intends to create a 15.8 percent local equity
by a further issue of 350,000 50 cent shares at par.
A comforting first-interim report arrives from Con-
solidated Gold Fields Australia; the half-year’s
$2,090,000 earnings are expected to blossom into a full
year of more than s4m.
Industrial Engineering lifted earnings by $36,619 to
$560,770 for the December half; the interim was sent
from 5 to 6 percent . . . Engineer A. G. Healing suffered

Painful
Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors —including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief—invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets—now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved —even with sufferers
of over 20 years. A week’s course

Investigators’ reports
The force of official frowns
By CROESUS
WHEN A SOLICITOR-GENERAL
mounts a rostrum to ventilate sugges-
tions for company-law reform, presum-
ably his line won’t be far out of plumb
with the Government he repiesents.
Possibly even such a tireless tiller in this
field as Mr. A. G. Rylah would, at this
stage, consider some of the ideas put up
by Mr. B. L. Murray, QC, in a recent
address to chartered accountants in Vic-
toria on the futuristic side. But at least
in respect of Murray’s remarks on the
practice of making public the reports
of investigators into companies declared
under the Companies Acts, the Victoria
A-G would probably agree with his
Solicitor-General, even if the Australian
Law Council’s sub-committee, which
has reported on the subject, would not.
As we shall see, Mr. Murray had
some reservations to his view that these
reports should be published, yet he
leaves us in no doubt where he stands
on the matter. He pointed out the con-
flict involved between the desirability
of protecting people against attacks on
their integrity and the need of making
public reports which might help to pre-
vent future company failures. He
thought the latter was paramount.
A starting point for a discussion of
the pros and cons of publishing such
reports can be the undoubted fact that
much unwarranted damage has been
done both to individuals and companies
by the publication of a good many of
them to date. The Law Council spelled
this out in no uncertain terms. On the
one hand it stated that it recognised the
public interest in disclosure; on the
other, it said that neither the satisfac-
tion of public curiosity and popular
indignation, nor the identification of
individuals against whom parliamentary
or popular censure could be directed,
could be regarded as ends justifying the
publication of reports.
To my knowledge the personal dis-
tress caused by the publication of some
of these reports, which have not hesi-
tated to rub the noses of a lot of
innocent people and their families in
the dust, has been considerable around
Melbourne and one can only deplore
it. Who is to know that an investigator
won’t go off at half cock in his enthu-
siasm to unravel the skein of a possible
manipulation? Surely the main object
of investigators’ exercises is to deter-
mine whether prima facie cases exist
for action by the authorities.
If one is looking for a deterrent to
stop future failures by publicising bad
examples, surely it should be left to
the courts to throw them up by success-
fully prosecuted cases and not to either
the Crown or non-judicial people like
investigators who, after all, can only
report facts as they see them and
venture their own opinions on them.
I would go as far as to say that in
its hue and cry after distressed com-
panies and their directors following the
1960 boom, the Victorian Government
has at times been just a bit too en-
thusiastic, especially as it is the
authority, responsible for leaving so
many loopholes in the Companies Acts.
Some of its repairing legislation has
been precipitate, to say the least. So
has its use of investigators, not only
in allowing their unedited reports to be
published but also even in the declar-
ing of companies. Whether Mr. Justice
Sholl was right or not three years ago
when he said in the Supreme Court
that the biggest disaster to hit Testro
Bros, was the putting of a receiver into
the company, the instrument has some-
times been used injudicially.
With the reservation that there is
very much less to be said for publication
in cases where the question of fraud
and possible proceedings are involved,
Mr. Murray is all for it because those
affected by company failures should, in
his view, be entitled to study the facts
and because it might help to prevent
future failures. If, as has been argued,
the reports are simply only the opinion
of the investigators who compile them
and have no legal authority as such,
his rejoinder is that investigators
“should be cautious and restrained and
do their utmost to observe the principles
of justice and fair play.” I must say
that in some of the reports of Victorian
investigations I have read (and I’ve
studied most of them pretty closely in
the past few years), I haven’t noticed
that caution or even discretion has been
all that apparent.
Given the enormous public appetite
for scandal, muckraking, and rubbing
reputations in the dust in this country
(this is not unique to us, though), it
has to be proved that publication of
the reports is justifiable on grounds
other than what might seem on the
face of it the desirable one of keeping
the public and even shareholders in
the declared companies in the picture.
The foremost of grounds to be con-
sidered is certainly the legal one; but
it is difficult to see how the legal pro-
cess is assisted, if only because juries as
yet unsworn have access to investigators’
reports or the information in them be-
fore being empanelled to adjudicate on
actions brought on the evidence in the
reports. That would seem to be a
decisive enough consideration to bar
the publication of the reports on legal
grounds.
Mr. Murphy, in fact, sees this point
and makes the suggestion that consider-
ation be given to the withholding of

reports or sections of them which might
give rise to criminal proceedings, at
least until such proceedings are com-
pleted. Also, he thinks reports could be
prepared in such a way as to omit
matter relevant to possible criminal pro-
ceedings. Surely, however, diluted
reports, which he believes would deter
individuals from continuing their pre-
vious ways, would be entirely unsatis-
factory. If the public is to be told the
story, or at least the investigators’ view
of it, it should be told all of it. In any
case, as we have seen on numerous
occasions, even the publication of the
most damaging reports against them
hasn’t deterred sorpe of the people in-
vestigated from their previous paths.
I should say that one reason for this
is that, although investigators’ reports
have come thick and fast these past
three years, prosecutions arising from
them have not. The Crown has been
more timid than one would have be-
lieved from the welter of evidence
thrown up by the reports, which
prompts the thought that despite the
accusations it is in most cases dubious
whether it can make the charges stick.
If this is so, surely it has been wrong
to bandy the accusations about in public
in the first place. It is all very well
for Mr. Murray to say that most re-
ports have done much to exonerate
many former directors even if the
exonerations have been welcomed by
them, a certain stigma has remained.
For those who’ve not been exonerated
by the reports, and still have not had
the satisfaction of having charges tested
in the courts, the position is so much
worse, impossible in fact.
What appals me more than anything
else is that the investigators have left
so many directors and company officers
wandering in the twilight zone of sus-
picion and they will never get the
chance to emerge from it one way or
the other. It is much worse for them,
even than for those who have charges
proved against them in the courts. In
my view their position nails the case for
not publishing investigators’ reports.
It is quite true, of course, that a lot
of these people, in fact most of them,
will have been shown up by the reports
as merely incompetent as directors or
officials and that this has brought their
companies down. Mr. Murray takes the
view that at least the publication of the
reports throws their names up and thus
puts people on their guard against them.
It would be incongruous, he suggests,
that a Minister of the Crown should
have in his hands a report showing a
director or directors had been incompet-
ent and yet these same people could be
at large forming new companies or re-
constructing old ones and calling for
public subscriptions. But, possibly, if all
the incompetents in the community were
debarred from continuing their chosen
employments because some government
investigator had frowned at them, Aus-
tralia would be much closer to being a
police State than most of us would pre-
fer it to be.

Mount Newman on the move
By JASON in Sydney
MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
CSR IS NOT the only participant
whose share of the Mt. Newman iron-
ore project is how being substantially
changed. A new series of financing-
arrangements likely to be announced in
the next few weeks will give the Mt.
Newman scheme a different and far
more “international” appearance. The
new breakdown of holdings soon to be
announced will be a 30 percent interest
each to Dampier Mining (a BHP sub-
sidiary) and Pilbara Iron (a CSR sub-
sidiary), 25 percent to America’s Amax,
10 percent to the Japanese consortium
of Mitsui and C. Itoh, and 5 percent
to the Selection Trust, of London.
These arrangements confirm that the
Australian holding in this venture will
certainly be a majority one of 60 per-
cent.
Monday’s news that the AMP Society
was to take up a 23.8 percent equity
holding in Pilbara Iron’s $16.8 million
ordinary capital as well as making a
“large” subscription to a debenture
issue puts CSR’s role (and financial
obligations) in this venture in much
better perspective. For it seems quite
likely that, if the AMP Society is to
take an equity position as w'ell as its
debenture one, then other institutional
investors who are likely to come to the
debenture party will no doubt also be
applying for some shares in Pilbara
Iron (but not anything like the AMP's
holding). As it is, the latest news
reduces CSR’s stake in the venture (and
its capital commitment) even further.
It had already been chopped from 50
percent (Amax then held the other
half) when the project was first mooted
(and before the cost of it doubled) to
30 percent before the latest reduction.
CSR’s share now seems to be likely to
end up at only around one-fifth, with
an equity commitment probably
between $lO and $l2 million.
Equity capital will probably make
up something like one-third of the
funds raised by Pilbara Iron to contri-
bute its one-third share of the Mt.
Newman project, but details of the
fixed-interest contribution have not yet
been released, even though they are
believed to have been settled in outline
last year (following initial agreements
about intent back in 1965). Because
of the early high cash flow likely from
the project (at least judging from the
Hamersley experience), medium-term
fixed-interest raising could presumably
be even greater than the long-term
institutional fixed-interest borrowing,
particulars of which are to be
announced soon and to which most of
the major life offices are understood
to have agreed to contribute. And
medium- to short-term lending on a
project like this would suit a consor-
tium of local banks.
There have been suggestions that the
new Bankers’ Development Refinancing
Corporation was announced at just the
right time to allow banks to participate
in the Mt. Newman scheme and so get
CSR off the financial hook. But there
does seem some evidence that a con-
sortium of Australian banks had in-
tended making substantial medium-
term contributions to the scheme even
before the new corporation formalised
what will be a far more satisfactory
technique. If this is so, then CSR may
not have needed this sort of help. But
it will be welcome none the less.
Mt. Newman is the biggest of W.A.’s
five mammoth iron-ore concerns, with
100,000,000 tons of high-grade ore con-
tracted for sale to the Japanese steel
makers shipped from Mt. Whaleback
northward along a 265-mile line to Port
Hedland. After a doubling of costs
forced the two original partners to look
for other participants, the first re-
arrangement was a four-way affair with
the original partners plus BHP and
Cliffs Western Australian Mining Co.,
two groups who had planned to work in
co-operation on developing the lower-
grade deposits along the Robe River.
Cliffs pulled out to go it alone on their
finds when cost-trimming eliminated a
pellet plant for the Mt. Newman group;
they specialise in pellets. Part of the
next deal was that BHP should manage
the consortium, and Amax soon started
offloading its shareholding. So far,
Selection Trust have taken five percent
and negotiations are close to complete
for the Japanese pair to come in and
make it truly an international concern.
All that await signing and sealing are
the joint-venture agreement and ratifica-
tion by the State Government. But the
deal is all ready to go, within the next
few weeks, and a number of suppliers
have letters of intent giving them the
right to supply big quantities of the
materials that will be needed on this
s2oom. job. One of these will marshal
virtually the whole of the Western Aus-
tralian timber industry to supply the
sleepers for the long, heavy haulage line.
At last the Newman project is on the
move.
ON THE SUBJECT of iron ore, the
whole question of Hamersley Holdings’
issue of 10 million shares is one that
shareholders in CRA have every right
to get quite cross about. This is the
sort of placement of capital that
appears to be quite wrong in principle,
particularly when shareholders of CRA
(and RTZ) are giving up far more
than they are receiving in this deal.
Until the issue, CRA owned 60 per-
cent of Hamersley; after it, CRA’s pro-
portion of the 100 million 50 cent share
capital will fall to 54 percent. In other
words, CRA shareholders should, in
reality, be entitled to the right to take
up six million of the 10 million shares
now being issued in order to retain
as a group their stake in Hamersley.
In fact, the Australian shareholders in
CRA have a priority of application to
The Chartist says:
NEW BROKEN HILL is showing very “bearish” tendencies and appears to be
settling into a downward trend where much lower prices could be expected. The
steep intermediate uptrend, commenced towards the end of 1962 and continued
at a rate of approximately 80 percent appreciation per annum until April, 1965,
was penetrated with a sharp decline to $3.35. However, the upward movement
was resumed at an overall lower rate of appreciation and a peak of $5.50 was
subsequently recorded about the middle of 1966. There is a distinct possibility of
a fall to $3.40, which would coincide with a strong support level and an extreme
downside target of approximately $2.00 must also be considered. A sharp fall
could follow any break in the support level at $4.00. Last sale price on 31/3/67

2,342,190 shares in the issue, and this
right (at the rate of one-for-five CRA
shares held) will not be renounceable
or transferable. Why not? The ques-
tion certainly needs answering. In
addition, the broking firm of lan Potter
and Co., which is underwriting the
issue, is to obtain the considerable good-
will of its clients by having the right
to allot as it sees fit 3,660,000 shares
that should belong to CRA share-
holders—as well as four million that
Kaiser Steel shareholders should be
entitled to.
For, let’s face it, the issue will be
rushed and the shares, being placed at
$2.50, will probably come on at any-
thing over $3. This means that CRA
shareholders (and that includes share-
holders in RTZ who also have more
right than the clients of a Melbourne
stockbroker to share in this) are being
deprived of their proper entitlement to
the cash value of something they have
given up - the difference between $2.50
and market value of a Hamersley share.
It is also intriguing to note that the
Sydney broking firm of Patrick and
Co., that played such a large part in
placing CRA’s at-the-time unpopular
large issue of shares in 1965, has this
time not been rewarded for its efforts
with a joint stake in the Hamersley
issue.
WE’VE BEEN PLUGGING away
recommending retail stores quite
strongly in recent months and it is
nice to see that business does appear
to be improving, according to the latest
reports from the companies themselves.
The news during the week from
David Jones, Woolworths, and
Farmer’s was heartening for those inves-
tors who, like us, take the view that the
retail trade is at last on the upswing.
The brightest thing about the DJs
result was the statement that Easter
trading had been phenomenal. But in
profit terms the half-yearly report still
seemed to justify a cautious approach
to this company, which has yet to prove
that its expansion in trading is leading
to commensurate rises in earnings.
Nevertheless, current prices around
the $1.32 mark take this caution suffi-
ciently into account, for it takes time
for new stores (and DJs has several)
to pull their weight in profit terms.
When they do, earning rates should
eventually start to look better again.
And the same goes for Woolworths.
The really significant thing about its
six percent profit rise for 1966-67 was
that it came despite (budgeted) losses
from the Big W retail stores, which are
an expensive addition to the group's
operations and which are not expected
to pay off for two years.
Woolworths has been chasing its own
tail in recent years; so rapid has been
its expansion that it has not yet had a
result in which all its assets have’been
fully up to their profit potential.
BHP’s SLIGHTLY higher dividend of
4.75 percent (to make 9 l-3rd percent
for tbe year) certainly indicates a divi-
dend rate of at least 94 percent next
year and possibly one of 10 percent, as
so .many things start to look up for the
company particularly local steel de-
mand in the short term and oil and gas
in the longer term.
Next week THE BULLETIN will
publish a major profile of the company
“BHP, the Seventh State.”

Mixing it with Henry Berry
By PELIAS in Melbourne
THE STOCKMARKET does not like
Henry Berry and Co. Ltd., and no
wonder. It has been involved in too
many unsuccessful ventures (like
Marchants) and has had to sell too
many of its other operations (like
Socomin and Southern Cross Manu-
facturing, and now, most of Red Tulip)
to give investors much cause for con-
fidence about its future. But the mish-
mash of remaining interests in the food
machinery, plastics, confectionery, and
electronics industries could conceivably
do better than they have in the past.
At current prices, the cost of finding out
is not too great —and the rewards couid
be reasonable.
In any event, the high dividend yield
while waiting should offset most of the
nervousness that investors may quite
properly feel about this group, pro-
vided the dividend is maintained in
what could be a difficult year. The
chances are that it will be: last week’s
interim report indicated that last year’s
8 percent dividend may be repeated for
1966-67, giving the shares a 9.8 percent
dividend yield at the current prices of
41 cents.
For a company which appears to have
just overcome the major part of its
liquidity and loan problems and is set to
expand its remaining interests, such a
low price and high yield has some sort
of appeal. The recent link with the
large Chicago-based Beatrice confec-
tionery group has certainly made a sig-
nificant change to the company that
could have beneficial impact on profits.
The lack of liquidity has been a big
thorn in the company’s side over recent
years. The sale of some of its assets at
various times has alleviated the problem
but robbed the group of earning power.
Two of the most recent sales were the
Socomin group of food importing and
wholesaling companies to Petersville in
1964, and a 26 percent interest in
Southern Cross Manufacturing (paper-
bag maker) to Reed Paper Products in
1965.
In 1964-65 the company managed to
lift earning rate from 5.6 to 8.5 percent
but dividend was cut from the previous
year’s uncovered nine to five percent.
In 1965-66 earning rate climbed to 12.6
percent and dividend became 8 percent.
Higher profits and sales were reported
for the first six months of the current
year, so dividends should be maintained
for the full 12 months even though the
interim was a steady percent instead
of a “confirming” 4 percent. But there
is doubt about profit performance for
the full year following the sale of the
Red Tulip subsidiary to Beatrice.
On the surface, the sale of the Red
Tulip interests appeared to be just
another attempt to raise working capital
at the expense of an earning asset. But
the deal will provide Henry Berry with
about $l.B million cash (the Socomin
deal returned, it is believed, only about
$500,000 and the transaction with Reed
Paper probably returned even less, so
that their effect was merely to give the
group cash to go on with). However,
the Red Tulip arrangement, potentially
at least, can substantially lighten the
burden of the group’s whole debt struc-
ture.
Last year the company paid $247,000
in interest a little more than the
actual profit of $244,000. Hence, any
reduction in the interest bill could
result in a handy increase in profits.
As total borrowed moneys were about
$4.1 million at last balance date, the
$l.B million from Beatrice could pro-
vide a 40 percent cut in the interest
bill, and a similar boost to profits.
The Red Tulip sale was also dis-
tinct from others in that Henry Berry
did not completely abandon its interest.
It still retains a 39 percent holding,
which will be producing income.
Although this will be substantially less
than returns from its original 90 per-
cent holding, the difference could prob-
ably be more than offset by a reduction
in the whole group’s annual interest
bill. Moreover, in tbe medium to long
term, the return from the investment
is likely to go back to its original level
because of the expansion which is
planned by the two partners.
“Partner” is probably the best de-
scription of the relationship with
Beatrice. Although the U.S. group
holds the controlling interest, Red
Tulip is to continue under Australian
management. Beatrice and Henry
Berry plan to jointly finance expansion
of the subsidiary (but it will cost Henry
Berry only 2-sth of the total), its pro-
duction facilities are to be extended
and its product range expanded. Ex-
port markets to the U.S. and the Far
East are to be explored (Beatrice has
well-established distribution outlets in
these areas). Red Tulip will also make
certain Beatrice lines of confectionery
in Australia and there are plans to
move into gourmet foods, too. Beatrice
may make Red Tulip lines under
licence in the U.S.

operations with Henry Berry in Aus-
tralia.
But there seems no need to rush into
Henry Berry shares. It will take some
time for a lot of the recent changes in
the company to bear fruit. The Red
Tulip accounts may not be consoli-
dated in 1966-67 and there will have
been little time to reduce the interest
bill. However, the prospect of a steady
dividend could bring a return of the
share price to par (50 cents) and the
risk does not appear too depressing.
NO MATTER WHAT happens to
earnings, the only real “growth” stocks
are those that continue to increase the
amount of money paid out to share-
holders. On this criterion, Alfred
Lawrence Holdings Ltd., the Mel-
bourne-based flavoring company, is a
real growth stock. It is steadily increas-
ing its payout (last month it lifted its
interim dividend to six percent, indicat-
ing 12 percent for the year against last
year's 11 percent), even though its
annual payout always takes the great
bulk of each year’s declared profit.
Current prices of $l.lO for the 50
cent shares return 5.5 percent. As
directors continue to lean toward a
fairly full distribution of earnings and
the company is growing steadily, the
annual dividend rate will probably be
further increased in future years. The
company has never reduced its divi-
dend during its 30 years on the public
lists, and seems to have increased pay-
out wherever possible. The distribution
was percent in 1962-63, when earn-
ing rate 11.3 percent, 10 percent
in 1963-64 and 1964-65, when earning
rate rose to 12.2 and 12.3 percent, and
11 percent last year, when earnings
touched 13.9 percent.
In the current year, sales and profits
were reported higher for the December
six months and the interim payout was
raised from five to six percent. The
group is never likely to do anything
spectacular, but it seems well placed
for growth over the next few years and
shareholders will benefit accordingly.
The main line of business is the dis-
tilling and marketing of flavors to food
and beverage manufacturers through-
out Australia. This sector has seen
strong growth over the past few years
and Alfred Lawrence has shared in
this, as it will in the promised future
growth. The group also makes standard-
formula pharmaceutical lines such as
zinc cream and calamine lotion for
chemists. The third main interest is in
publishing. This produces several well-
known trade journals and only recently
started publishing “The Epicurean,"
which appears to be gaining circulation
in the food industry.

Eglo is not
the ideal
for grandma
FOR THOSE ALERT investors who
quite rightly look to earnings rather
than assets as the key to investment
decisions, Sydney’s small ($500,000 paid
capital) Eglo Engineering (Services)
Ltd. represents an interesting example
of the merit of this sort of approach.
The company has more intangibles than
reserves, more aspirations than assets,
and more prospects than past perform-
ances.
It is not the ideal sort of stock for
grandma or for investors who think
like grandma. Its shareholders’ funds
are lower than its paid capital, its net
tangible assets backing for each 50 cent
share is only 34 cents. But it pays a
very well-covered 12 percent dividend,
its business looks to be well and truly
on the way up, and last month it came
out with a rise in interim dividend from
five to six percent along with a report
of higher contract revenue and profits
in the December half-year.
Eglo provides highly specialised
engineering services for the design and
fabrication of chemical plant, and the
installation and maintenance of special-
ised plants and pipelines for the rubber,
plastic, and petroleum industries. Each
of these industries has lately been re-
stricted in profitmaking by economic
conditions, yet they all continue to ex-
pand their activities and erect new
plants, and Eglo has participated in
engineering contracts for them. It is
well placed, in Silverwater (N.S.W.)
and Williamstown, to serve many
nearby refineries and chemical com-
panies. Eglo says it serves major cus-
tomers, including all the oil companies,
who are of such standing that bad
debts are not known.
There is plenty of business about (and
the company is getting an increasing
proportion of it, according to the
chairman at last year’s annual meet-
ing). The latest chemical tariff should
ensure there will continue to be strong
demand for expansion in the Australian
industry, and this should bring more
business to Eglo. But probably the most
interesting prospect is the coming of
natural gas for industrial uses.
Eglo relies on its skills for its profit-
ability, so there is no doubt that its high
earnings may be vulnerable if it is un-
able to retain its position in this field.
This also means that it has relatively
few assets employed in its operations
and relatively few costly fixed over-
heads. Much of the equipment it uses
(usually on the site of its customers’
works) is hired for the period of the
installation or servicing job (explaining
its very low depreciation charge).
More cautious investors may never-
theless be alarmed at the company’s
methods of bookkeeping in handling its
incomplete contracts but it seems
that the company’s criteria are fairly
conservative.
Debtors rose 86 percent from
$257,000 to $473,000 over the last trad-
ing year, an indication of possible turn-
over growth, though turnover is not
divulged. Debtors seem enormous in
relation to stock and work in progress,
which rose from $38,000 to $51,000.
The explanation from the company is
that it is extremely conservative in its
evaluation of work in progress and its
stocks are mainly steels. With large
contracts, at the end of each month
customers are invoiced with the exact
percentage of the job complete, enab-
ling the company to avoid carrying a
large work-in-progress figure.
Trade creditors likewise rose dramat-
ically from $44,000 to $199,000. The
company at last balance date had no
overdraft, nor any long-term liabilities.
Eglo’s volume of contracts undertaken
in 1965-66 demanded more workshop
space, so suitable premises were
acquired on lease near the company’s
main centralised works at Silverwater.
The company also announced its first
interstate move. A Melbourne factory
was established at Williamstown in free-
hold premises, starting business on
December 1, 1966. This should bring
considerable benefits to the company
in 1967/68. No fresh interstate expan-
sion is contemplated at the moment and
present premises are adequate for
immediate needs. Recent expansive
moves have been financed internally,
but if this rate of development con-
tinues, a call on shareholders for fresh
capital would be on the cards.
The company’s earning rate on total
funds has been over 32 percent for the
two years of public life, higher than
earning rate on capital because of huge
intangibles, $221,000.
From a maiden 10 percent dividend,
as forecast in the prospectus, the com-
pany has graduated to 11 percent in
1966; an interim six percent payable this
month gives every indication of a 12
percent rate for this full year, which
would have about 200 percent earnings
cover if last year’s profit progress is
any guide.
The 50 cent shares, floated at par
and first listed in June, 1965, are now
available at around 87 cents, where
yield on last year’s earnings is 12.9 per-
cent and income return 6.9 percent.

Security Analysis
Earnings growth is crucial
for David Jones
THE “LEADER RETAILERS” are
being considered in alphabetical order,
but some might think that it would
have been best to compare Coles and
Woolworths apart from David Jones,
Myers, and Waltons. Certainly there
are good reasons for such distinction;
the main one would be the different
types of merchandise sold. Although
David Jones and Myers would sell
food lines, they would not be so heavily
involved as Coles and Woolworths;
despite Woolworths recent entry into
department-store trading through its
Big W stores, Coles and Woolworths
would not be as heavily involved in
white goods and furniture as are the
other three.
As has already been pointed out,
retail sales of food seem to be rather
more stable than other classifications,
although the mark-up is much lower
and it is doubtful today whether any
retailer of food could make much
profit if he did not run his store
on self-service lines.
David Jones Ltd.’s vital statistics are
as follows:

During 1966, the share price fell
down to $1.19 and that was the lowest
price since 1959. Of course this com-
parison is not valid, because there have
been two issues to shareholders in the
interim and I estimate that these issues
were equivalent to a bonus issue of
about one-for-five. To put it another
way, if a shareholder had on the occa-
sion of each issue sold enough rights to
provide cash to take up the balance of
his entitlement, so that he did not have
to put up any new money, then his
holding of ordinary shares in David
Jones today would be twenty percent
greater than it was in 1959. This means
that the share which sold at $1.19 in
1966 would have had a price of $1.42
before the issues; even on this basis the
shares have not been lower since 1959.
In the current year (since January
1), the shares have fallen fairly steadily.
After starting the year at a peak of
$1.51 they have fallen to $1.22, and
over the past few days before Easter
they have recovered to $1.27, which
was the price when this series of articles
began. On the basis of historical price
levels, one would think that the shares
are cheap at this price.
David Jones started its history in
Sydney. Today it is established in four
States of Australia, the exceptions being
Victoria and Tasmania. The interstate
expansion started in Western Australia
with the acquisition of Bon Marche
Limited in 1953/54, and in the follow-
ing year Charles Birks & Co., of Ade-
laide, was acquired. Queensland came
next with the takeover of Finney Isles.
So within a period of about two years,
David Jones had become nearly Austra-
lia - wide. Other retailers were then
acquired at Newcastle and Wollongong
and new stores were developed ab initio
at Parramatta and Brookvale. Further
acquisitions were made in Queensland
and also in Western Australia and a
store was leased in the Monaro Shop-
ping Centre at Canberra in 1963. It is
possible that this venture into a shop-
ping centre developed by Lend Lease
Corporation paved the way for the
later venture into the Bankstown Square
centre, also developed by Lend Lease
Corporation.
David Jones does not appear to have
any set pattern regarding its selling
locations—that is, it sometimes buys
the premises but on other occasions it
has taken leased premises. Probably the
main determinant is the location of a
store; it can be assumed that the David
Jones’ operation, which seems to be
solely in the department store area,
requires that every store is located in
an area with a substantial surrounding
population, and preferably with a grow-
ing population.
It is also apparent that, in recent
years, David Jones has spent consider-
able sums in remodelling its stores.
The Adelaide store (previously Charles
Birks) was almost completely rebuilt
between 1960 and 1962. About $5 mil-
lion appears to have been spent on this
venture and the result was that the
new store had nearly three times the
trading area of the old. The old George
Street store (Sydney) was also re-
modelled during 1963-64 and the Wol-
longong store has also been completely
rebuilt so that it is now nearly five
times the size of the original. The
leased store at Brookvale has increased
in size by about 33 percent recently.
Early last July, it was announced
that David Jones would build the
largest shopping centre in Queensland
at Mount Gravatt, a Brisbane suburb.
It seems that this project is still in

the planning stage and the opening
date in unlikely to be earlier than
1970.
On the face of it, the future looks
pretty good. The new stores at Banks-
town and Wollongong should start to
contribute to profits at least from
1967/8 onwards and the benefits from
the extended selling area at Brook-
vale should be felt during the current
year.
Unfortunately, when we look at the
past five years, we notice that the record
of earnings per share has been quite flat.
During this period the group earnings
should have been increased by the fol-
lowing:
1. The acquisition of T. C. Beirne,
Queensland, in January, 1962.
2. The completion of the Adelaide
store in September, 1962.
3. The opening of Monaro Mall,
Canberra, in March, 1963.
4. The opening of Brookvale in April,
1963.
5. The acquisition of March &
Webster, Mackay, Queensland, in July,
1963.
6. The acquisition of Bolands, Cairns,
Queensland, in September, 1963.
7. The acquisition of Foy & Gibson,
Perth, in March, 1964.
Mainly as a result of the various
acquisitions, equity capital has increased
by about 48 percent over this period,
but the percentage increase in selling
floor area is not known. It does not
seem that any further increases in
capital will occur in the near future
unless some attractive takeover propo-
sition comes up. However, the Mount
Gravatt project will cost about $lO
million. It is therefore possible that out-
side finance will be required, although
David Jones has a fairly substantial cash
flow per annum.
The present proprietorship ratio and
the high interest cover on present bor-
rowings would indicate that any outside
finance for Mount Gravatt could be
supplied by further borrowings, in
much the same way as Grace Bros,
financed the Roselands development.
The interim report for the 1966/7
year and its implications will be dealt
with in the concluding article. One
would have expected an improvement
in sales and profits over the previous
corresponding period. It is also to be
expected that the upward trend should
be continued for some while into the
future.
Clearly the question of future growth
in earnings is all-important in the case
of David Jones. If one could feel con-
fident that growth would be at the rate
of only, say, two percent per annum
in earnings per share in the future, then
the shares should be priced about 15
percent higher than they are at the
moment.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Western Mining Corporation kept on keeping on; after some
early backsliding, London pressures evidently reasserted them-
selves, so the shares gained a net 28 cents to close at $8.34.
Another glamor miner, C.R.A., saw demand, reaching $5.22 by
a 12 cents rise. Two clear retreats were provided by Broken
Hill South (down 10 rents to $2.76) and Mount Isa (down
12 cents to $3.61). B.H.P. couldn't do much for the industrials,
finishing steady at $6.40. On its report, David Jones added a
clear 6 cents to touch $1.33; contrariwise, R. W. Miller lost 10
cents and finished at $1.45. Millaquin slipped a total 15 cents.

Joy Push-Button Miner sends its 60-car conveyor train into a
hard-to-reach seam at the Peabody Mine in southern Ohio.
Newest thing in coal miners - -
Timken bearings make it jump for Joy
The modern miner sits in an air-conditioned control
cab, pushing buttons that send a boring machine
1,000 feet into a coal seam. Built by Joy Manufac-
turing Company, the Push-Button mining machine
brings out the coal on its own train of cars.
The 3-storey unit works smoothly, because Timken
tapered roller bearings are everywhere: mounted on
the rotor drive, drum, disc cutter, track drive, con-
veyor drive, gear cases, cutter heads, and a dozen
other places. Timken bearings roll true and last
longer because they are precision-made of tough,
quality steel, case-carburized for long life. Their
tapered design handles both thrust and radial loads
best.

Mining
Broken Hill South and
its phosphate
NOW THAT Mr. Lindesay Clark has
stated that his company, Broken Hill
South Ltd., has reserves of phosphate
rock running into thousands of millions
of tons, the gap between imports of
minerals and their local production
has been made even smaller. The
remaining minerals of significance for
which Australia still relies on imports
are asbestos (imports in 1964 were
42,900 tons valued at $5 million),
potassium (96,000 tons worth $2.8
million), and sulphur (376,600 tons
worth $6.5 million). A year ago this
list included nickel and phosphate.
Should the price of elemental sulphur
continue to increase, a point will be
reached at which local users will find
domestic supplies of pyrites attractive.
Certainly the Broken Hill South de-
posits at Duchess, about 50 miles south
of Cloncurry, will be of considerable
significance both to the company itself
as well as Australia, even though
development will probably be a long-
term project. Although only general
indications of the size of tire deposit
are available, it is obviously large
enough to replace our present imports
of 2.5 million tons (worth $lB million)
per annum. A question of considerable
significance for the development of the
deposits is whether the existing Mount
Isa railway would be suitable for
transporting the phosphate rock to the
coast. If the existing Mount Isa rail-
way, which passes through Duchess,
could be utilised, the company would
be in the enviable position of having
a substantial deposit of mineral which
would be salable almost as mined,
and situated quite close to bulk trans-
port facilities.
Ironically, Queensland, the State in
which the deposit has been found,
uses less than two percent of total
Australian consumption, and process-
ing plants are located in the southern
States. It could well be more attract-
ive for a venture of the magnitude
necessary to develop the deposits to
construct its own railway and save
freight costs. Such a railway would
be either to the east coast (500 miles
away) for shipment to southern States
or to the Gulf of Carpentaria (300
miles away), to meet export markets.
Should either of these courses be fol-
lowed, the capital requirement for
development would be considerably
increased, because the deposits as they
stand could be worked by relatively
cheap open-cut methods.
Australian usage of phosphate rock is
almost entirely for the manufacture of
superphosphate, made by decomposing
phosphate rock with sulphuric acid.
Queensland's major mining centres,
Mount Isa and Mount Morgan, are
both sources of sulphuric acid, con-
tained in pyrites produced as a by-
product of copper smelting. Mount Isa’s
pyrites are burnt away, while Mount
Morgan has been accumulating pyrites
for many years and has for some time
been negotiating with the American
chemical concern of W. R. Grace to
develop a superphosphate complex at
Gladstone, using its accumulated pyrites
as a source of sulphur. The increased
price of imported elemental sulphur will
in time make the use of these pyrites
more attractive; this is likely to be too
far in the future to have any immediate
bearing on the assessment of the value
of the deposit to Broken Hill South
Ltd.
Phosphate rock is marketed in accord-
ance with a “B.P.L.” (bone phosphate
of lime) standard and Australia draws
most of its supplies from Nauru and
Ocean Islands in the Pacific Ocean,
and from Christmas Island in the Indian
Ocean. Prices for these imports vary
in accordance with the B.P.L. content,
but average around $7 per ton, on to
which freight is added, amounting to
about $10 per ton. Bearing in mind the
simplicity of large-scale, open-cut min-
ing methods, the cost involved in ship-
ping from Duchess would be very easily
borne Hamersley Holdings Ltd,
receives $8 per ton and rails its iron ore j
182 miles to the coast on its own rail-
way, and Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui Pty.j
Ltd. has been shipping Q million tons
of coal, also worth about $8 per top
198 miles from Moura to Gladstone. >
It is very obvious that the exploita-
tion of this deposit will be very profit-
able for Broken Hill South Ltd. Never-
theless it is unlikely to be anything but
a long-term venture. The actual size and
grade of the deposit have yet to be
determined. In addition to this and
other technical aspects, there may be
substantial political problems involved,
These arise from Australia’s positionl
as a member of the British Phosphate)
Commission, which controls our exist-i
ing supplies, in particular those from!
Nauru. Deposits on this island have a
limited life (about 25 years) and the
mining of phosphate rock is the main-
stay of the island’s economy.
In preparation for the time when
Nauru’s reserves would be exhausted,
the Australian Government has been
active in seeking suitable arrangements
for the resettlement of the Nauruans.
Consequently, it is unlikely that it would
encourage the rapid development of
local phosphate deposits if this led to
a withdrawal of Nauru’s principal
source of livelihood. Nauru is adminis-
tered as a United Nations trust territory
by the Governments of Australia, New
Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
These difficulties notwithstanding, an
annual output of 2i million tons selling
for, say, $7 per ton ex mine and mining
costs of $3 per ton would give a con-
siderable boost (of up to a possible $5
million) to Broken Hill South’s earnings
(currently $3.2 million) once the ven-
ture is under way.
Commodities
Zinc producers cut output
A LEADING US miner and smelter
has lent support to the world zinc pro-
ducers’ output-reduction program. St.
Joseph Lead Co. produced 10 percent
less zinc in the first quarter of this year
than a year earlier, and plans to oper-
ate 13 percent below year-ago levels in
the second quarter.
Other U.S. producers have indicated
that they are studying the situation.
Government controls prevent any overt
trade agreement to hold down produc-
tion in support of markets.
Leading world producers outside
the U.S. (including local E.Z. Indus-
tries) agreed on a 10 percent produc-
tion cut late last year. As well as the
need to support this operation, U.S. pro-
ducers have been spurred by a weaker
domestic market, particularly in the car
industry.
America’s zinc and lead producers
have also been mounting opposition to
the quota-free entry of foreign metal
(including Australia’s). St. Joe’s move
adds to producers’ chances of holding
their £stg.lo2 a ton selling price for
some time yet.
ABOUT THE ONLY hope for a re-
covery by rubber prices from present
18-year-low levels would be a cut in
U.S. stockpile sales. The U.S. sales pro-
gram is 120,000 tons a year—compared
with a monthly production in Malaysia
of 80,000 tons. Production has been ex-
panding, partly because of the efforts of
the Malaysian Government, but con-

sumption is under pressure from syn-
thetics.
The U.S. has modified stockpile re-
leases in the past but has been reluctant
to make drastic cuts in the quota. On
the face of it, whatever Washington’s
decision, the less efficient producers of
rubber face an unhappy future. London
prices have slumped from a range of
20 to 22 pence stg. a lb. a year ago to
16 or 17 pence at present, with little
indication of any important recovery.
Prices could regain some lost ground,
however, as industrial activity returns
to its former high levels. The extent of
such a recovery would be an indication
to rubber’s future.
THE OUTLOOK for Comalco’s
planned aluminium smelter in New
Zealand continues to be obscure—partly
because of the cloud of rumors sur-
rounding the venture. The smelter, to
use cheap New Zealand hydro-electric
power, would produce 100,000 tons of
aluminium a year.
The latest reports from Japan say
that Comalco’s efforts to interest
aluminium consumers from that country
have involved offering a 70 percent
farm-out of capital. The latest news
from New Zealand is that the cost of
the Manapouri power project will be
substantially above original estimates,
and that the N.Z. Government and
Comalco have reached a fresh agree-
ment said to involve “savings for both.”
NOT UNEXPECTEDLY, the London
wolfram market has come back a few
shillings as traders await some more
hard news. Consumers are showing little
interest at present, and in this thin
market prices can swing 20/- or 30/-
with little (or no) cause.
The longer-run outlook is still for
prices averaging around 360/-, the
ceiling set by U.S. sales.
Meanwhile in China, preparations
are in hand for the Canton Trade Fair.
Probably wolfram and scheelite will be
little traded until more information is
available on Chinese supplies.
ON THE SIDE of copper’s bears is
Dr. Joseph Zimmerman, doyen of U.S.
metals commentator, who emphasises
the probability that the time is nearing
when “prices will suffer a slump that
is likely to be as sensational as were the
advances.”
Production should rise about 425,000
short tons this year and, with consump-
tion far from buoyant, a surplus will
be faced, Dr. Zimmerman says. The
U.S. producer price, equivalent to about
£stg.3oo a ton, is not likely to be
affected, in the doctor’s view.
LAST YEAR sales of U.S. titanium mill
products increased by more than 50
percent to 28,000,0001 b. Consumption
of the hard metal in ingot form was
44,000,0001 b., against 29,000,000 in
1965. The leading producers are, as
already reported, expanding capacity to
over 60,000,0001 b., with a further target
of 70,000,0001 b. by the early 19705.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
What it means
to become
non-popular
SOME YEARS AGO, Dr. Scott
Bauman, of the University of Toledo,
wrote an article titled “Investment Ex-
perience with Less Popular Common
Stocks.” Although the study was based
on the performance of U.S. stocks, its
conclusions would appear to have
equal application here.
The study disclosed that the overall
performance of the “non-popular”
group of stocks was superior to the
“popular” group of stocks in six of the
eight years under review. (Non-popular
stocks are the younger, lesser-known
companies with specialised product
lines.) In fact, on the basis of average
annual return, the non-popular group
showed a 20 percent appreciation,
whereas the popular group of stocks
was only able to muster a 16 percent
appreciation. Understandably, the in-
dividual stocks comprising the non-
popular group showed a much wider
divergence of performance than those
stocks in the popular group.
Shortly before Dr. Bauman’s article
was published, a portfolio of 32 stocks
was prepared by one of our own lead-
ing finance newspapers. Apart from the
number of stocks, the most remarkable
feature was its concentration on appar-
ently safe investments (8.H.P., Bank of
N.S.W., Woolworths, Boral, and so on).
In other words, it was a group of stocks
that Dr. Baumann would have had no
hesitation in classifying as “popular.”
Four years afterwards we find that 27
of the 32 stocks in the portfolio are at
a lower price level.
Two of the remaining five stocks were
the subjects of successful takeover
offers in the interim. As this was not
the reason for their inclusion in the
portfolio, they should not be taken into
consideration in determining the per-
formance of the portfolio. Therefore,
only three of the 30 stocks have risen
in price. Expressed another way, for
every one rise there have been nine
falls. Considering that the market is at
about the same level as it was four years
ago, the inference must be that one way
to a fortune in Australia is not through
holding a portfolio of popular stocks.
More by accident than by design, very
few of the stocks in my own portfolio
could be classified as popular. Mt. Mor-
gan certainly is not by the way it has
been behaving in the past month. At the
moment, the market is preoccupied with
the possibility of a further fall in the
price of copper. In this mood, it is
overlooking developments in the sulphur
industry. Increasing demand by fer-
tiliser manufacturers has upset the bal-
ance between world production and
world consumption of sulphur. As a
result, the sulphur price has been
steadily rising to a point where pyrites
(an impure form of sulphur) is close
to being an economic proposition. With
reserves of at least eight million tons
of pyrites, Mt. Morgan would receive
a sizable boost to profits from this side
of operations.
The only stock added to the portfolio
this week is a non-popular stock.
Evidence of Larke Consolidated’s lack
of popularity is the very high dividend
yield of 8.6 percent. In pricing the
shares at 85 cents, the market is paying
little heed to the consistently sound
results since 1960, more important, the
prospects over the next year or so.
While Larke is basically dependent
on the motor-car industry (being both
a manufacturer and a distributor), it
has been progressively moving into other
fields. Hence we now have one sub-
sidiary making industrial chain and
conveyers, another ladders, and a third
plastics.
The depressed motor-car industry
was the main reason for the 30 percent
fall in profits last year.
The only sale this week was 200
W. J. Manufacturing. They refused to
budge off the $1.15 mark, so I had to
settle for this price.
Transactions this week were:

500 Larke Consolidated .85 $435

A man can erect an
18ft.x9ft. carport in
less than a day
and have it last
a lifetime
with Alcan's G.P 22
Building Sheet.
One ingot of aluminium is much the
same as another. It's what you make
of it that counts. And that's where the
power of ideas comes in.
Take Alcan Building Sheet. We made
it thicker and wider than competitive
sheets so that the job can go up
faster with fewer laps and fastenings.
Tradesmen and handymen reckon
that was a pretty good idea.
Alcan Building Sheet goes through a
cladding process, which is a sort of
alloy lamination that gives the surface
maximum corrosion resistance.
That's not a bad idea either.
Incorporated into the design of the
sheet is a sure weatherproof device
for the side laps which has been
tested against the most adverse
weather conditions. The sheet's dis-
tinctive embossed pattern is featured
on all accessories—right down to the
washers. Maybe that's not a big deal,
but it does make the finished job look
neater and more professional. You can
see Alcan Building Sheet on display
at your builders supplier and hard-
ware store. He'll be only too happy
to give you a copy of the brochure
which explains all about the product.
Build a carport or a patio with Alcan

Dizzy on the slippery pole
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Disraeli. Robert Blake. Eyre and Spot-
tiswoode. $l4.
THE MORE ONE considers the career
of Benjamin Disraeli the more in-
credible the story becomes. That such
a figure should have emerged at all
in the context of Victorian politics is
extraordinary; that he should have be-
come Chancellor of the Exchequer and
finally Prime Minister of a Tory Govern-
ment is little short of fantastic. Dis-
raeli was everything that we imagine
a typical Victorian statesman not to
have been romantic, irreverent,
eccentric, totally deficient in the moral
earnestness the age prized so highly, an
exotic alien dancing impudently round
the sturdy, time-honored oak of the
British Constitution.
To his great antagonist, Gladstone,
politics were a crusade, a business of
deadly seriousness, a wrestling with
devils for the country’s salvation. To
Disraeli politics were an entrancing
game, the only game worth playing for
a man of intelligence and enterprise,
with power as the glittering prize. No
politician ever manipulated people and
passions with more dazzling virtuosity.
Almost single-handed he created a new
Conservative Party out of the inarticu-
late backwoods squires, the handful of
magnificoes, and the jealous rivals who
had refused to follow Peel when the
old Tory Party fell to pieces over the
repeal of the Corn Laws.
Only when he had reached the top
of the slippery pole did Disraeli really
begin casting around for a policy as
a substitute for verbal pyrotechnics.
Few Prime Ministers ever came to
office with less solid administrative ex-
perience. So compelling was his person-
ality, so rich and various his talents,
that it comes as something of a shock
to realise how little he actually con-
tributed to Britain’s political or econ-
omic development. During the 44
years of his parliamentary career the
Tories had a majority for little more
than a decade. It was not until the
last years of his life, 1874-80, after three
previous Tory Governments had each
collapsed within a few months, that
Britain was ruled by a relatively stable
and effective Disraeli administration.
Even then, compared with the tor-
rent of legislation that poured from
the Gladstonian fonts, Disraeli’s achieve-
ments were modest. He stole some of
the Liberals’ thunder with a new fran-
chise reform, and trade union, factory,
health, and education Acts. But these
were mostly the work of conscientious
subordinates who took seriously Dis-
raeli’s romantic fancies about a Tory
Democracy that would wean the work-
ing-class vote away from Gladstone.
The Prime Minister himself took little
interest in them. Perhaps his instinct
was surer when he conjured up the
title of Empress of India for Queen
Victoria, to the enormous gratifica-
tion of the masses who felt that gener-
ations of material progress were now
suitably capped by their monarch hold-
ing the gorgeous East in fee.
“Lord Beaconsfield is very peculiar,
but he will be particularly loyal and
anxious to please me,” wrote the Queen
when Disraeli took office in 1874. He
was indeed. It is possible that historians
still underestimate the pervasive power
of royal influence nearly half a century
after the Reform Bill. Certainly Dis-
raeli did not underestimate it. Within
all the devotion and flattery which he
laid at the feet of the “Faery”
adulation sometimes so grotesque that
a more sensitive soul than the Good
Queen would have felt her flesh creep
there was a wide streak of pure
hard-headed calculation. It took Dis-
raeli quite a while to get the Queen
on his side. The Prince Consort had
detested him. “There is not a par-
ticle of the gentleman in him,” Albert
once said disdainfully, in the days
when Dizzy still oiled his ringlets, and
affected bizarre opinions about religion
and outrageous waistcoats. But, once
Disraeli had wooed and won her,
Victoria’s loyalty never wavered.
It is time we had a new biography
of Disraeli, and Robert Blake’s 800-
page volume is likely to remain the final
word on the subject for years to come.
Nothing, I suppose, will entirely replace
the six dutiful volumes of Monypenny
and Buckle, whose one-and-a-quarter
million words rolled remorselessly from
the press between 1910 and 1920.
M. & B. was a gigantic quarry in which
students of the period have been,
fossicking ever since, but it is daunt-
ing reading even to Disraeli’s most
devoted admirers. Blake’s book is a
work of art, the finest piece of
biographical writing to appear for a
very long time, and, more than that,
a splendidly sweeping picture of the
whole of Victorian politics and society.
Apart from the enormous hoard of
Disraeli papers at Hughenden (which
were also available to M. & B. and
Benjamin Disraeli
are now in the custody of the National
Trust), Blake has drawn heavily on
the royal archives at Windsor, hitherto
unpublished letters and other material
not accessible when Monypenny and
Buckle were writing.
Disraeli made four attempts to get
into Parliament before he was elected
for Maidstone, where the voters
howled “Old Clothes” and “Shylock”
when he appeared on the hustings. He
was then 33 years old, a debt-loaded
dandy, diner-out, incorrigible poseur,
and moderately successful novelist. His
father, Isaac D’lsraeli, author of
“Curiosities of Literature” (itself a
curiosity), had become a converted
Christian, but Benjamin deliberately
cultivated a sort of freakish exoticism in
dress and manners. (He once said that
Christianity was “completed jdaism”).
Everyone knows how his maiaen speech
in the Commons was extinguished in
jeers and laughter, id how he retorted
in the memorable words: “I will sit
down now, but the time will come
when you will hear me.”
Peel refused him office, and how
much of Disraeli’s role in smashing the
Tory Party was due to political con-
viction and how much to personal mal-
ice is hard to say. But, when Peel
fell in 1846 after sweeping away the.
archaic Corn Laws, Disraeli eagerly
seized at the chance of leading the
Tory protectionist rebels. For years
he had to play second fiddle to Lord
Derby, the official chief, but in the
Commons there was no one to rival
him in the Tory ranks. Few of his
colleagues liked or trusted him when
he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in
Derby’s three short-lived governments.
His Budgets were quite undistinguished
and Gladstone made hay of them in
debate.
But behind him a new Conservative


Party was slowly coalescing, gathering
to it all the forces that opposed Glad-
stonian reforms. When it came to
power in 1874 Disraeli was the only
possible Prime Minister. By then his
raffish past was far behind him. He
had married a rich widow who paid
his debts; aristocratic admirers had set
him up on the landed estate of
Hughenden; he was the Queen’s dear
Dizzy. In 1876 the man who had always
loved lords accepted a peerage and
entered the House of Lords as the
Earl of Beaconsfield. “I am dead, but
dead in the Elysian fields,” he said.
To the end he never really measured
the effect of Gladstone’s moralising
thunders on the British conscience. To
dismiss the Bulgarian atrocities as
“coffee house babble” was typical of
Disraeli. There were sound strategic
reasons for bolstering up Turkey
against the Russians, but flippancy was
a dangerous weapon to wield against
Gladstone. In 1880 the Tories went
down again and Disraeli survived the
defeat by only a year. On his death-
bed his inextinguishable wit and gaiety
still flickered up. He corrected his last
speech for Hansard, saying: “I will not
go down to posterity talking bad
grammar.” When it was suggested that
he might like to be visited by the
Queen, he said: “No, better not, she
would only ask me to take a message
to Albert.”

Art. $6.60.
THE MEMOIRS of film people seldom
live up to the expectations aroused by
the cinematic personalities of their
writers. Even through the ghost-writer’s
polish there is visible a gleam of the
fanatical egotism which all people in
the cinema must possess if they are to
survive. A work conceived in the spirit
of self-justification must inevitably fail
because of its own top-heavy tendency
to depend on what it is rather than
what it says. “Fun In A Chinese
Laundry” is, however, an exception to
this rule, perhaps because the author
himself is an exception to most of the
rules that guide the cinema and its
inhabitants.
Josef von Sternberg, due here in May
as guest-of-honor of the Sydney Film
Festival, went to America from Vienna
in the days before many of the basic
cinematic techniques had been formu-
lated. Few attempts had been made to
explore the possibilities of the camera
or of screen acting. From 1924 to the
begininng of World War II he directed
a series of films which are among the
most beautiful, strange, and individual
ever produced. These films, “Morocco,”
“Shanghai Express,” and “The Scarlet
Empress” among them, made Marlene
Dietrich a star and established von
Sternberg as one of the greatest direc-
tors of all time. Since the ’thirties,
however, he has made few films, and
almost none that even hint at the beauty
of his early works. The fact that he
considers the last of them, a cheap and
almost forgotten production made
wholly in a Tokyo studio, his greatest
work is an index to his perverse and
individual nature.
“He buys his suits to fit the man
he’d like to be, about three sizes too
large. He gets in his pants with a step-
ladder and takes three steps before the
suit moves.” Seeing this remark (attri-
buted to Joseph L. Mankiewicz) and a
number of other similarly ambiguous
tributes quoted on the wrapper of this
autobiography, one senses immediately
the response expected by the publisher,
a sort of affectionate outrage. Like von
Stroheim, von Sternberg is to be “the
jnan you love to hate,” somebody for-
given his many sins only because of a
vaguely apprehended “genius.”
Von Sternberg lives up to his Press.
His reminiscences, arrogant and libel-
lous by turns, are seldom without some
degree of offensiveness, either to the
reputation of a movie personality or to
the film historian’s sense of the past. If
much of what he says is true, the book
is both personally insulting and a
historic statement on the nature of
film, but as few of the victims are
mentioned by name and the critical
pronouncements are infuriatingly vague,
the reader’s response is a confused one.
In the end, “Fun In A Chinese Laun-
dry” seems unsatisfactory on every
level, but it is a book that must be read
by everybody interested in the cinema.
Confusing or not, von Sternberg’s
style is overpowering, as strange and
eccentric as any of his films. His stories
of life in Hollywood, of the arguments
and scandals that punctuated his life
there, are supported by capsule com-
ments, too oddly phrased and waspish
to be called anecdotes, on some of the
people with whom he has worked.
Charles Laughton is characterised as a
masochist, while another actress (Char-
lie Chaplin’s star, Edna Purviance?)
appears as a hopeless alcoholic. Even if
the book does raise more questions than
it answers, the little light it does shed
is valuable.
A little light, however, is not enough,
and the book leaves most of the basic
critical questions about von Sternberg
unanswered. For the film historian, he
is one of the directors most impossible
of categorisation. Hollywood in the
’thirties was totally dominated by the
conventions of the stage. Directors were
almost without exception trained in the
theatre, either as actors, producers, or
vaudeville performers. Still tied to the
concept of cinema as filmed theatre,
the studios produced little that had not
already been tried and found successful
on Broadway. Lighting, make-up, act-
ing, direction, distribution all were
constructed on the patterns found suc-
cessful for decades with the drama.
Von Sternberg was a rarity, a director
with no theatrical associations at all.
Artist, sculptor, litterateur, he came to
the cinema via a job mending film in a
repair shop, and his approach to direc-
tion appears to have been a combina-
tion of a highly developed visual imag-
ination and a sense of the physical
nature of film itself, the effects that can
be induced by editing, the diffusion of
light, the use of film’s drawbacks as
qualities. His films, luminous and com-
plex, bear as a result little similarity to
the static dramas whch comprised most
of Hollywood’s output at the time. All
are unmistakably marked with the
director’s personal touch.
The impression von Sternberg gives
us in his book is that of the lone
creator completely in control of every
aspect of his films. “The director is
the chief author of a film,” he says,
“and in many countries this is legally
acknowledged. I myself attach little if
any importance to the plethora of
other credits that precede a film.” Yet
to believe this is to ignore the con-
tributions of a dozen other major
artists: Hans Dreier, art director on
many of his films, Lee Garmes, camera-
man on the best of them, the script-
writer the late Jules Furthman (dis-
missed here as “a friend I had trained
to be a scenario writer”), and his star,
Dietrich, whose films since those with
von Sternberg have proved her a great
enough actress in her own right. She
continues, however, to contend at every
opportunity that she owes everything
to him, and the riddle remains
unanswered.
Mr. Sards’ book, for all its hand-
some stills and elegant presentation, has
the same emptiness as von Sternberg’s
more disastrous films. A representative
of “New” film criticism, in which facts
are considered subordinate to specula-
tion on symbolism and the evocation
of mood unimportant beside considera-
tions of social importance, Sards has
perversely devoted himself to excluding
from this book anything either new or
worth while on the subject. The contri-
bution to von Sternberg’s films of
Dreier, Garmes, Furthman et al is
ignored to a greater extent than even
the director himself was capable, but
where he made up for his omissions
with an excess of anecdote and detail
Sards offers us some of the most
illogical and unlikely theories ever put
to paper. His attempt to present “The
Scarlet Empress,” a film bearing the
same relation to real places and people
as “Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs,” as an exercise in character
development and “period re-creation” is
arguably the craziest judgment in


cinema history, comparable to the esti-
mate offered of Cocteau’s “Orpheus”
that, because a character falls during
the action into what is apparently a
pool, that the whole film is about fish.

German Writing Today. Editor, Chris-
topher Middleton.
Italian Writing Today. Editor, Raleigh
Trevelyan. Penguin Books. $1 each.
I WELCOME this interesting new
series, which presents in one volume the
translated works of writers in various
foreign countries.
Gunter Grass is, of course, to be
found in “German Writing Today.”
We are given not some leaden chunk
of prose from “The Tin Drum” or
“Dog Years” but a feeble poem and a
silly short play. I should have liked to
see instead a short play such as “Über
den Gartenzaun” by that sprightly
writer of poetic comedy Konrad
Wunsche, whose “Der Unbelehrbare
und Andere Stucke” can be found in
the excellent Suhrkamp series called
“Im Dialog.”
The aim of the Penguin series is to
present writers who have been suc-
cessful in their own lands but who are
little known by English readers. One
can hardly call “little known” Gunter
Grass, Ingeborg Bachmann, Gunter
Eich, and Peter Weiss—all represented
here. But it is good to bring to the
attention of British readers the work
of the fine poet Karl Krolow (also
published in paperback by Suhrkamp).
A small selection of Krolow’s work was
excellently translated into verse by
Michael Bullock and published last
year in his little magazine “Expression.”
Johannes Bobrowski (grand-nephew of
Joseph Conrad) is another good poet,
an East German whose selected poems,
under the title “Shadow Land,” were
issued in London in 1966 in English
translation. His death in 1965 was a
cruel loss to modern German poetry.
The translations, particularly those
of poetry by the volume’s editor, Chris-
topher Middleton, and by Michael
Hamburger, are of rare quality and
precision. I would single out especially
Hamburger’s renderings of the thrill-
ingly indignant Hans Magnus Enzen-
berger and Middleton’s of Krolow,
Christa Reinig, Helmut Heissenbuttel,
and Erich Fried. I was disappointed
not to find some of the last-named
writer’s prose. Of course, a translator
ought to be able to translate the un-
translatable. But Fried’s work is
atrociously difficult to put into compre-
hensible English, as I discovered to my
cost when I made a version of his
remarkable novel, “Ein Soldat und Ein
Madchen,” written in a complex, pun-
ning, allusive style that is densely
poetic and in fact untranslatable. (The
translation was never published.) On
this point I thoroughly agree with what
Middleton says in his Introduction:
Some of the most significant experi-
mental texts in German do not work out
in English, not because they are empty
formalistic exercises, but because they
explore linguistic behaviour - patterns
which are uniquely German and cannot
be adequately re-created in any other
idiom.
“Italian Writing Today” is equally
interesting, though it includes things
that hardly seemed worth translating,
mostly critical essays: Paolo Milano
says nothing noteworthy about Dosto-
evsky, nor does Franco Fortini illumin-
ate the work of Luzi and Sereni, while
Alberto Arbasino and Umberto Eco are
essentially journalistic a quality that
vitiates much modern Italian writing,
based on an ingrown dependence on
newspapers.
Another complaint I have about this
volume is that poets are meanly dis-
played, though what we do have
especially the poems by Sereni, Luzi,
and Pasolini (a versatile virtuoso if
ever there was one!) are brilliantly
transmuted into English by Gavin
Ewart, himself (like Middleton and
Hamburger) a poet in his own right.
The editor of the volume, Raleigh
Trevelyan, is also a good translator, as
can be seen in his fascinating extract
from Luigi Meneghello’s “Libera nos a
malo.”
I am sorry not to see any poems by
Edoardo Sanguineti (also a gifted trans-
lator of English poetry), who is, how-
ever, well represented by extracts from
his highly original anti-novel “Cap-
riccio Italiano.” Dacia Maraini, who
so dazzled us with her two novels “Age
of Discontent” and “The Holiday,” is
disappointingly revealed here in a weak
•short story written in horribly phony
“avant-garde” style. I wish, too, we
could have had some of her poems
from “Crudelta all’ aria aperta.” She
is certainly one of Italy’s most promis-
ing women writers, but quite over-
shadowed here by two wonderful
stylists, Natalia Ginzburg and the lum-
inous, visionary, utterly unique and
enchanting Anna Maria Ortese. These
two women writers’ contributions would
alone make this excellent selection
worth buying.
Transubstantiation
We were listening to the reed pipe
of some ancestral province, but it did not stop,
even when it sounded like an orchestra, and was;
nor when the violins and oboes
grew to be a single human voice,
then many voices. And the days of ice
fell clattering across the continent.
We began to know what these happenings meant:
that all this planet-load of molecules
was changing form: from plants and soils,
from ice, air and livestock, into human flesh
so even mountains, to accommodate our needs, began to vanish.
There came a time when the old
inhuman melodies seemed to offer wild
glimpses of our prehistory, something pure.
For then the breathings of people
had swelled so loud we could not hear
our voices, nor think for fright, nor dare make music.
Later the day did come when someone sang. And singing broke
like a fresh contagion on the world and spored.
When every voice had set the atmosphere
in motion, it came alive. We in turn
had been relegated to the function
of nourishing another order of the universe.
The singing has begun devouring US.

Senate Trouble
The insinuations of your writer Alan
Reid are about on a level with his politi-
cal thinking. First he criticises me (8.,
March 18) without mentioning any
issue upon which my stand is in dispute.
Upon Repatriation in respect of the dis-
abled and dependants of the dead in
Vietnam I have frequently stressed the
deficiencies of present compensation.
To mention only one aspect, insur-
ance. In the U.S.A. each soldier can
take a life policy not less than $12,000
nor more than $30,000, paying a meagre
$1 per week premium, the Army paying
the rest. In Australia, companies are
allowed to refuse policies except on a
special loading. Mr. Alan Reid would
give the impression that Party direction
should supersede one’s judgment on this
issue.
Secondly, his statement, “but Sena-
tors with rare exceptions (Turnbull is
one) are elected not because they are
Wright or some other individual but
because they are No. 1 or No. 2 on their
Party’s ticket. They enter the Senate
almost anonymously,” is a cheap half
truth. I entered the Senate in 1949 at
the top of the Liberal Poll, although I
was bottom, No. 4 (in alphabetical
order), of the Party list.
Thirdly, at every application for en-
dorsement, before our Party Committee,
I have clearly stated that my view of a
Senator’s duty is to vote independently
according to one’s judgment of policy.
That has been made emphatic and
clear. In my opinion a collection of
“Yes” men directed by a Cabinet is a
negation of Parliament. In the words
of Churchill we “are spokesmen not of
governments but of the people.”
Alan Reid’s only experience is of a
Labor Caucus, which, more than any-
thing else, has undermined the genuine-
ness of Parliament in one generation.

Getting into Print
Mr. Elwyn Lynn, in his article on the
graphic arts (8., March 4), mentions
that Gallery A and the South Yarra Gal-
lery are, to quote, “soon to implement
print-making projects.”
To my knowledge, Gallery A has
been doing this for some time and, if
I am informed correctly, might have
shut down its presses.
He failed to mention the Crossley
Gallery, 4 Crossley Street, Melbourne,
under the direction of Tate Adams, as
a gallery interested in the graphic arts.
The Crossley Gallery is the only
Gallery in Australia that shows graphics
exclusively, and it is Mr. Adams’ in-
tention to set up a lithographic work-
shop there in the near future. This
Gallery has already gained excellent re-
views for its shows, and important over-
seas artists will exhibit there.

The anti-Glossies
I really must protest. How young is
old?
In his otherwise excellent article on
the rise of the “Anti-Glossies” (8.,
March 25), David Salter uses these
words about “Censor” “By using the
old technique of having overseas litera-
ture mailed to him page by page in
sealed envelopes, Graham has been
able, etc.”
But Graham has admitted that he
copies this from my ploy with “Trial of
Lady Chatterley.” I am of the opinion
that this was the first time it was done;
in other words, it is about two and a
half years old.
By a Freudian slip one might call
it a lusty infant; but infant it is. Inci-
dentally, Salter might have carried the
matter a little further by posing the
question as to whether these nudist
magazines really help in the fight
against over-censorship in Australia.
For myself, I am open to argument,
but at the moment I think they do the
cause more harm than good.

A Finer State
I must hasten to correct the statement
made by Batman (8., March 18) in
which he compares Toowoomba with
Melbourne. Admittedly, Toowoomba
has a deep affinity with Melbourne. We
can both claim many beautiful parks
and gardens, but to compare the climate
of the two cities is stretching a point
to say the least. “Toowoomba too
hot in summer and too cold in winter”!
Never! Here we enjoy pleasant sum-
mers during which the temperature
rarely rises above 90 degrees, and our
winters are cool at night but with
beautiful sunny days. Can Melbourne
boast such a climate? And, incidentally,
Toowoomba is over 2000 feet high and
not 1000 feet.

Your do-it-yourself piece (8., March
18) on the Prime Minister’s latest
appointments to his personal staff
impels me to offer the following on an
even lower intellectual level:
So I’ll leave all those files
And impose go-go styles
And Mags looks after the clobber;
While Members draw out
Intellectuals: Stout,
Knopfelmacher, T. Dum Dum, and
Slobber.
And we’ll now give some whacks
To those leaden-foot hacks
Adorning my Treasury benches,
Redressing the balance of deathly
dull talents
With luminous outsider stenches:
Korman at Treasury, Palmer at
Trade
Oops, dear, I pressed the wrong
button.
This perilous system is clearly dis-
played:
I give you for President Dutton.

The Critics' Beards
It was interesting to read Geoffrey
Lehmann’s article “Singeing the
Critics’ Beards” (8., Feb. 2). Interest-
ing, too, to know that in the Writers’
Retreat so much poetry could be read.
It would indeed be more interesting to
know whether any of it could be
remembered. Surely that is the test.
Strange that the only remembered
poetry —that is to say, remembered
among the people came from our
crop of “minor” poets, Kendall, Gor-
don, Paterson, Lawson, and the rest.
We read lots of alleged poetry today,
but who among us student, artist,
actor, writer, or just mere ordinary
chap would want to remember any
of it?
