Baffled Bigots.
The Education Act is endangered by its own
creators. There is an epidemic quality pertain-
ing to theological excitements. People in one
quarter of the world no sooner abandon their
sanity, or work up their morbid emotions, than
symptoms of infection become apparent elsewhere.
The apparition at Lourdes, in France, was quickly
followed by the miracles at Knock, in Ireland,
Moody and Sankeyism spread with amazing
rapidity from America to England, and even
affected Australia with an eruption, not yet quite
subsided, of sacred Christy-minstrel psalmody.
The Salvation Army spread its feverish contagion
over England with choleraic celerity, has affected
the United States, and is producing its grotesque
symptoms of holy -trut, of a saintly-military blend
of gibberish, and of imbecile paradings in fantas-
tic trappings, among ourselves. In Victoria a
certain class of light-headed individuals, who, in a
former ooniition of exaltation, were instrumental
in secularizing Public Schools, have discovered
that the work which, when finished, they pro-
nounced to be very good, is not good at all, bat
deplorable and insupportable.
• # "
Accepting the theory of epidemics in relation to
emotional crazes, there seems reason to presume
that a similar discovery will very shortly be
announced in New South Wales. Theta are
besides other reasons which indicate the immi-
nence of a Bible-in-Stato-schools agitation. The
extreme sectarians, to carry their chief object in
connection with the relation of the State to the
schools, entered into an unholy alliance, and made
a compact; with iniquity. They permitted the
passion of hatred so far to carry them away, as to
induce them to deny the very name of religion and
to fight a campaign under the banners, disguised
in the uniform, and shouting the watchwords, of
downright Secularism. It is true that, as
generally happens when particular circumstances
throw natural adversaries into the field together
to make common cause against a common adver-
sary, victory was followed by an adj of
results, each of the allied conquerors conceding
something to the requirements of the other.
• * •
The present Education Act, embodying the one
distinguishing principle of eliminating the recog-
nition or support of the State from schools _ in
which sectarian dogmas are taught, _ but which
has been so administered as to permit covert in-
struction in what has been euphuistically termed
“common Christianity,” conveyed by means of
Bible lessons and narratives embodied in the
class books, contains an apparent concession to
the pure Secularists and a much more real gain
to the “ Evangelical ” school of Protestants.
Nominally secular, the curriculum in our Public
Schools is substantially Protestant. The Secu-
larists are fairly content, taken all round. But,
under the head of ‘'Secularists,” there are com-
prised persons of very diverse views. There are
the downright Rationalists who do not admit the
inspiration of the Bible, and who would prefer
that their children should be educated to govern
their lives by the principles of abstract morality.
These really constitute a sect, and have no more
right to demand a school-system adapted to their
requirements than any other sect, except on the
ground—a tolerably strong position, by the bye—
that, as their code of morality underlies and is a
component and essential part of every dogmatic
religion, tuition on their lines must be serviceable
to pupils of every denomination and can be offen-
sive to none. That is, of course, on the pre-
sumption that their system of negations, which is
directly antagonistic to and destructive of super-
natural religions, is not intruded in the cur-
riculum. All that the moat devout Evangeli-
cal can urge against the strictly secular or
rational system of instruction is that, from their
standpoint, it is incomplete—a foundation with-
out a superstructure. But this is an objection
which the Evangelicals cannot conveniently urge :
for three reasons.
• • •
The first is that, when agitating to breakup the
system of State-aided Denominational schools,
they professed themselves apostles of unseotarian
(which is a oonvertable term for secular) educa-
tion, and cannot decently repudiate their declara-
tions now. The second is that, as a matter of
fact, their influence has bean effectual in main-
taining a considerable degree of evangelical teach-
ing in our so-called unseotarian schools. And
the third is that, if they raise the cry that Scrip-
ture lessons do not carry religious teaching in the
schools far enough te satisfy their consciences,
they give a tremendous endorsement to the
Homan Catholics, who have been perpetually
urging the same plea ever since the present Edu-
cation Act came into operation.
m • *
There are, nevertheless, abundant symptoms
that here, as in Victoria, a Bible-in-State-sohools
agitation is fermenting. Several causes operate
together to render such a movement probable.
The extreme hatred which the Methodist sects
nourish against the Roman Catholics carried them
away during the last agitation, to which the
present Education Act is due. In ordor to strike
a blow at the rival sect they overreached them-
selves and played the game of the Rationalists
much more effectively than their own. They were
so eager to use against the object of their detesta-
tion any effective weapon which was offered to
their hand, that they rashly employed logic,
and found themselves under the necessity of
accepting the conclusions of that uncompromising
science. Having adopted the premises that it
was no part of the duty of the State to contribute
towards the inculcation of sectarian dogmas, they
succeeded in driving their theological hetes noirs
outside the pale within which public moneys arc
applied, altogether. But they utterly failed to
coerce the Roman Catholics into submitting their
children to a secular system qualified by a small
infusion of Biblical reading ; and they have now
awakened to tho fact that while one result of their
action has been to place the children of Roman
Catholics more completely than before under the
tutelage of the clergy of that Church, sm-Lber
has been to rerhove their own young people, fur Lher
than they like, from the influence of their own
special theology.
e m • •
They have thus realized a defeat all along the
line, except in the one particular that they have
inflicted upon the objects of their antagonism a
pecuniary penalty, by driving them to the only
acceptable alternative of abandoning the Public
Schools altogether, and substituting others main-
tained at their own expense. The Public Schools,
as at present conducted, have a proselytizing tone
with reference to Roman Catholic children ; but
the preponderance of secular over biblical teach-
ing in them, which was a necessary outcome of
the heated and insincere declarations of the
Methodist leaders of the last agitation, renders
them much more tolerable to genuine Secularists
than to those who merely pretended seoul *r oon-
viotiens for a dishonest purpose, and concealed
behind an appearance of candour and logical
demonstration as ardent a desire for dogmatic
teaching as the most artful Jesuit. The dismissal
from political power of several of the moat noted
and fussy agitators, is another reason why a sec-
tarian cry is likely to be made before long. These
individuals save themselves from insignificance
only by playing upon the excitements and fermen-
tations of tbe ignorant and prejudiced. Wher-
ever two or three are joined together, with their
blood in a ferment and their wits a wool-gathering,
there do the professional agitators pat in an ap-
pearance as ready-made leaders; fired with a con-
suming zeal for the selector overburdened with a
weight of interest—the artizan tainting under
eight and a half hours' work, with only twenty
holidays in the year—the Holy Protestant re-
ligion—the sacred rights of free bread and beer—
the Temperance uause —the liberty of the op-
pressed publican—or any other subject which
occupies for the time a sufficient number of fools
or zealots to be useful as followers, dupes, and
catspaws.
• • •
It is not at all likely that the threatened agita-
tion will succeed. The Education Act in running
successfully enough in the direction in which it
was deliberately set going. That its operation is
grossly unfair to Roman Catholios, every disin-
terested observer will admit. That it is destruo-
tive to dogmatic Protestantism, is also true in a
degree. But it is precisely what dogmatic Pro-
testants made it, and declared themselves
desirous that it should be, rather than
that the State should contribute to the
teaching of other dogmas. They declared them-
selves perfectly capable of taking care of their own
young outside the Public Schools, and demanded
that other sects should do the same. They delibe-
rately consented to out off their own noses in order
to spite the faces of their Roman Catholic neigh-
bours. And now that the spiting process has
succeeded in one way and failed in another, they
want to clap on their noses again without undoing
the work of their malice. They will find the
attempt harder than they reckon. They will not
this time have the support of the genuine
secularists. They had beat leave the Education
Act alone, lest a worse thing befall them, blioula
they disturb existing arrangements, the proba-
bilities lie two ways. One, towards a return to
the status quo ante helium —to the conditions which
preceded the passing of the Act; the other, to a
more complete seaularization of the curriculum.
The Secularists will not consent to assist the
accomplishment of so distasteful and dishonest a
chimera as the open conversion of State-aided
schools into the seminaries of one sect, after
another sect has been driven out of them by pre-
tences that State-aid to dogmatic teaching is
repugnant to principle. And the Roman Catholics
will not stand by and see the assailants who treated
them so hardly profit by coolly introducing into
the non-sectarian schools they called into existence
a factor which would simply place them on the foot-
ing of exclusively State-aided Protestant schools.
If the extreme bigots repent, now that they realize
that the scourge they knotted for the backs of
their adversaries swings heavily upon their own
shoulders, they will find few to pity them. They
have so well and forcibly argued on the propriety
and justice of a secular system of teaching in
State-aided schools that they cannot hark back.
No human gullet could avail to swallow so great a
mass of excellent argument as the promoters of
our present Public school system piled up. If
they dislike the dose of their own mixing, but one
decent course remains to them. They can follow
the example of the adversaries they overcame.
They can provide and maintain at their own cost
schools in which the dogmas of Protestant Chris-
tianity shall be fully instilled into the minds of
their young, and abandon the State-aided schools
to those who honestly accept and appreciate those
principles of unseotarian and non-dogmatio teach-
ing which they themselves made so remarkable a
pretence of holding, but a few years back, when it
seemed to suit their purpose.
The Verdict of Posterity.
Thb overwhelming defeat and determined repudia*
tion of the Pabkes-Bobebtson coalition Cabinet,
and the peremptory refusal by all the principal
constituencies to have anything to say to the
leaders and several of the subordinates in that
Administration, has evoked a good deal of aston-
ished comment from the Press of the neighbour-
ing colonies. The Queenslander is quite bewil-
dered to perceive the man, who to all outward
seeming was but yesterday the Haman of New
South Wales, cast out as was the earlier Haman.
Our Northern contemporary moralizes on the
catastrophe, and remarks, very justly, that violent
impulses are frequently succeeded by abiding
reactions. It reasons that if Sir Henry Pabkes
has been merely the victim of spasmodic impulse,
time may yet bring healing. The probabilities may
best be examined by taking as text the bitterest
and at the same time most concrete expression of
the popular sentiment, as given voice by Mr.
M'Elhone on the hustings. With a character-
istic vehemence of language that politician, the
true representative of all that is uncompromising
and trenchant in the public temperament, heaped
upon Sir Henry Pabkes a mountain of obloquy,
and, plunging into prophecy, predicted for
the falling leader a future of shifts as
painful as have marked his past, and
a climax of penury and degradation which
would be sufficient expiation for a life of the
deepest iniquity. We believe in the doctrine of
averages and reactions. A man’s career is made
up of episodes. Aristides was, as the Queens-
lander reminds us, driven from his eminent state
with cries of rage by the unreasonable fury of the
populace ho had nobly served. Posterity has
avenged him. The shame of the incident rests
for ever not on the memory or character of Aris-
tides but on the howling mob who, thinking to
dishonour him, disgraced themselves. The like
case may be the lot of Parkes. Posterity will
average his services, his merits, and his faults;
and his character will brighten or soil the pages of
our history according to a calm and dispassionate
judgment which the animosities of individuals, the
prejudices of journalists, and the interested par-
tiality of sycophants or public plunderers will be
equally impotent to affect.
• • •
It may be Sir Henry Parkes’ misfortune that
the appearances surrounding hia life have afflicted
a host of the most independent and reputable
among his contemporaries with a strong convic-
tion of his self-seeking and unworthiness. It may
be a malign f *te which has pushed into antagonism
with his system and individuality almost every
man who has obviously nothin tr to expect from
him, nothing to seek from him, and nothing to
fear from him, and has at the same time associated
most prominently with him a band of persons
whose personal gain, in substance, social advance-
ment, or corrupt profit, is obviously dependent
upon his countenance and upon his being main-
tained in a position to give potency to his favour-
able disposition. These may bo accidental cir-
cumstances of transitory significance. Viewed
by broader lights than are possible to contempor-
aries, at any rate at the present time, a hundred
qualifying facts may come into the field of vision
and entirely change the relative aspect of the
facts now apparent to all who have mental “ eyes
to see.”
• *
•
If such prove to be the case, it will come to pass
that it has not been Sir Henry Pabkes who has
been covered with disgrace, but those who
maliciously or ignorantly condemned his proceed-
ings and denounced his principles. If posterity

or even the constituencies within a short space
should decide that the fallen minister and dis-
graced man has on the whole exercised his talents
to noble purpose, how great will be our condem-
nation ! If on a review of his career, such as can
only be made when that career shall have been
closed for ever, and all whose interest it is to
smirch its episodes or extenuate its incidents
shall have passed away, posterity shall decide
that Sir Henry Parkes lived, on the whole, a
elean life, and was governed by principles of
integrity and honour, what a posthumous shame
must fall upon the detractors of to-day! When
M’Elhone pronounced that Henry Parkes
would yet die beggared in a gutter, what a eulo-
giutn did he pronounce on the object of his scorn
if it be proved—not that the man had tried to
enrich himself by corrupt and secret courses and
had miserably failed ; not that his whole system
of dealings with his fellowmen had justified the
taunt that he was one who habitually violated the
obligations of honest dealing and yet could not
prosper—but that he was a beggar because it was
foreign to his nature to trick a trusting friend, to
diddle a creditor, to evade a just debt, to exist by
degrading dexterities, and, inferentially, to dabble
in any advantages derived from accidents of posi-
tion or immunities secured by dexterous avoid-
ance of legal penalties. If it were possible to
leave Sir Henry Parkes in the hands of pos-
terity, every honest and conscientious opponent
of his apparent principles and conduct would
gladly relegate him to that tribunal. But, while
he remains an active participator in current
affairs, such a course is impracticable. By the
men of to-day, he must be judged by the know-
ledge and impressions of to-day, and must take such
chances as he has by hia past career stored up, of
benefiting by the operation of the law of reac-
tions. It is almost certain that the speediness of
the operation of that law, and the intensity of the
recoil, will bear an accurate proportion to any
excess of severity which may have been dealt
out.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Blackbirding.
According to Mr. Morrison, a medical student and
son of the well-known Dr. Morrison, Principal of the
Scotch College, Melbourne, the Polynesian labour
trade is as sickeningly revolting as ever. Under
Governmental protection and supposed supervision,
the most horrible atrocities are perpetrated. The
kanaka is not even regarded with the reverence be-
stowed upon a valuable chattel, and in this respect is
worse off than if he were a veritable avowed slave. Mr.
Morrison gives his statements the widespread pub-
licity which the columns of the Melbourne Age afford,
so that these are no charges made in the dark. The
labour-vessels are spoken of as so many floating charnel*
houses, their filthy over-crowded condition, the
diseases they breed, Ac. &c., being graphically do-
gcribed. One illustration will be sufficient to quote, in
order to show the kind of tale Mr. Morrison has to
tell: — 11 On 12th June the sick Aoba boy, whom I had
been attending since he came on board sick with the
dysentery, died. It was my forenoon watch, and
about 11 o’clock it was reported to the mate that he
was dead, so a sennit was made fast round his neck,
and another round his ankles, and he was hauled out
of th© hold. The mate was greatly excited, and told
Joe to sew him up at once and chuck him ever. But I
suggested that it might be more humane to first wait
till the bpy was dead. I observed a slight heaving of
his chest, and on uncovering his face he slowly opened
his eyes, showing the death film upon them. The rope
round the neck nearly stranged him. Shame to tell,
that boy was roughly laid in the weather scuppers, and
there, in sight of all on board, he gasped in his death
throes for four hours. I was below when he was
thrown overboard, so can merely say that the opinion
was freely expressed in the forecastle that the man
was not dead even then.” Is this anything short of
trafficking in human flesh ? And will it not, for cold-
blooded atrocity, bear comparison with the marrow-
freezing deeds of pirate Cap win Kidd, or any other
historic bold buccaneer P Will the Queensland Govern-
ment inquire right into the heart of this ?
Bowelless.
Yon can’t get blood out of a stone.” The despised
Cabbage-Garden of Sir Rip Van Winklk Robertson
has, in a few days, raised something like £20,000 in aid
of the living sufferers by the Creswick mining accident.
New South Wales has done nothing towards this de-
serving object. With the exception of the sparse pro-
ceeds of a few amateur dramatic performances at Hay,
and perhaps one or two ether up-country towns, N.8.
Wales doesn’t figure at all in this benevolence. Bat our
neighbours’ sorrows are nothing to us, because even
our own are forgotten with indifference as soon as the
first thrill of surprise has evanished. Thera was the
Woniora disaster. Sixteen lives lost, and hardly a
shilling—with the exception of £250 from the N.S.W.
National Shipwreck Relief Society, and £205 from the
Bulli Co. —was raised to soften the adverse stroke of
fate to the families of the perished ones. There are
the struggling female operatives of Beath, Schxess,
and Co, fighting against the tyranny of money-grub-
bing; and all our trades—though quick to strike on
their own accounts, and to receive outside assistance
themselves—are sluggish in aiding these helpless girls
to fight an unequal combat. But what does this
question involve ? We have previously shown, by aid
of the frequently-reduced scale of payments, that these
female employes of Beath, Schiess, and Co. cannot
(honestly) earn a fair living. And they must live I How
are they to make up the difference P Has the Rev.
J. C. Kirby’s Social Purity Society ever calculated
this element ? Remember, a member of the firm of
B. S. & Co. is President of the Melbourne Y.M.C.A.!
We wink at the oppression of these girls. Our souls
are absorbed in money-getting, and money-keeping. If
it were a testimonial to a political fraud, we would
subscribe fast enough, as a sort of cast-thy-bread-npon-
the-waters venture for future returns. But we have no
bowels for real suffering. There is the New England
shipwreck. We will probably talk with uplifted palms
and eyebrows for nine days about this; but pray do
not ask us to disturb our pockets.
Only a Blackfellow.
Out West, in a town which we may indicate by saying
that it is famous for its Returning Officer, a tragedy
has just occurred. But, as it only concerns a black-
fellow, it hasn’t in the least marred the excessive jollity
pf the present festive season. Besides, he was a deaf
and dumb blackfellow at that—a black mute, and of no
account amongst civilised Australians. His name was
“ Dummy," and he was a station hand. On Saturday,
he got his cheque, rigged himself out in spotless white,
aud went t© this pleasant little western town. On
Monday his body was at the bottom of the Lachlan
river, behaving previously lost his cash and his spotless
white suit. An inquest was held by a Corener, who is
also a Eeturning Officer, and a plain verdict of “ death
by drowning” was returned. Yet “Dummy” was one
of the finest swimmers in the district. But, then, he
was only a blackfellow. The Coroner —who is also a
smart Returning Officer, mark you —ordered his bunal,
and “Dummy’s” corpse was hidden away under a few
feet of the river bank. This spot was within a mile of
a cemetery; so that you see, for a deaf and dumb black-
fellow, his remains were highly honoured. When the
wind blows in the right direction, the ghost of
“Dummy” will perhaps get the tail-end of a sniff of
the consecrated ground, which is as much as any well-
regulated blackfellow ought to expect. Now, let us
leave the dead “ Dummy,” and speak about his cheque.
That cheque went through a rum-shop. So did the
eqaivalent for the spotless white suit. So did
“Dummy," for that matter. Of course, no free-born
haughty Colonial or Britisher would dream of asking
that the law should be swung into operation concerning
the barter of the cheque and suit, on account of the
death of a miserable mute of a blackfellow. Oh, no ;
we’re too enlightened for that.
Leon Gambetta.
The death of Leon Gambetta alters the complexion of
European affairs in a greater degree probably than
would the decease of any other uncrowned man of
the time. It is impressive to observe that Gambetta
perished the victim of his sole backsliding from the
principles of his earlier years. Prom the sternness of
his democratic ideas ho had never diverged in his
public life. The conceptions which made of him a n
Irreconcileable of the most determined type during the
Empire, when to be an Irreconcileable exposed an able
man to the prospect of marred fortunes and a blighted
career, ho retained unaltered when the revolution of
events heaved him up to power and influence. But he
succumbed privately, even while he maintained the
vigour of his public attitude. His convictions which
continued to dominate his political attitude proved
ineffectual to control his selfish appetites. The man who
had while poor inculcated a system of socialistic self-
denial for the individual, swelled into a self-indulgent
voluptuary at the touch of wealth. Like Mirabeau,
he was a mere sensualist where women were concerned.
To the severe doctrines of a St. Simon he joined the
luxurious indulgencies of a Lucullus, Had Gambetta s
private practice been in keeping with his convictions,
he would have been alive now. He died, killed by his
women and his cooks. He was about to be married.
A jealous wench, resenting this supercessiou, attacked
and wounded him. His injuries were slight, but his
gross flesh, a morbid growth due to excessive indul-
gence at table, refused to heal. His over-rieh blood
corrupted, and he died, in one death, the deaths of John
of England, a surfeit, and of Marat, a woman’s stabs.
It is remarkable that two of the greatest men in
Europe in recent times have died victims to them
selves and jealous women— Skobeloff and Gambetta,
A Portrait in Petto.
We exaggerate the ambition of great men; we mistake
what the nature of it is. Great men are not ambitious
merely to hold office; infinitely less are they ambitious
to cling to it when, by the action of public opinion,
they have been stripped of every vestige of power and
consequence. He is a small, poor contemptible man
that is ambitious so. Examine such a man for a single
second. You see him living in misery because he does
not shine above other men; he goes about producing
himself, pruriently anxious about his gifts and claims ;
struggling to force everybody, as it were begging
everybody, for God’s sake, to acknowledge him a great
man, and set him over the heads of men! Such a
creature is among the wretchedest sights seen under
the sun. A great man? A poor, morbid, prurient,
empty man ; fitter for the ward of a hospital than for
a throne among men. A shallow, hypocritical false
creature, with hollow, whining voice and watery eyes
he is sustained by empty, windy vanity, and a talent for
deception. I advise you to keep out of his way. He
cannot walk on quiet paths; unless you will look at
him, wonder at him, write paragraphs about him,
he cannot live. It is the emptiness of the man,
not his greatness. Because there is nothing
in himself, he hungers and thirsts that you
will find something in him. He generally asso-
ciates with coarse, ignorant, illiterate people, who
are easily persuaded into the operation of swallowing
their own notion of his greatness, which is the con-
stant theme ©f his conversation night and day. In
good truth, I believe no great man, not so much as an
ordinary genuine man who had health and real sud-
stance in him of whatever magnitude, was ever much
tormented in this way. Oh, Heavens! From the
statesmanship of Oliver Cromwell wrestling in grim
fight with Satan and his incarnate blackguardisms
hypocrisies, injustices, and legion of human and in-
fernal angels, to that of the inflated Premier of New
South Wales denouncing 1 he opening of Museums on
Sundays and inculcating a spurious religion in Parlia-
meat, what a road have we travelled 1 You have at
least one inveterate sham in your midst. Bless God
that you have discovered him to be a sham, and have
done with him for ever. And try for the future to
walk in the company of realities. It will be well with
you if you do so; ill with you if you do otherwise.
Accept this word from a wellwisher, a hater of all
hypocrisy, sham semblance, falsehood, false men, and
every phase of double-dealing and pretence, and rest
under the blessing of one who is still interested in you.
—Thomas Carlyle.
A Degrading Business.
Exit Arabi Fasha 1 On Christmas Day the Khedive
publicly—that is to say, kept in countenance by British
officials, and surrounded by his own hangers-on—de-
graded Arabi from his dignities. So runs the message
by cable. This leaves something to be explained. The
Khedive could not deprive Arabi of dignities he had
not conferred. He could deprive Arabi of his military
raak, as conferred by the commission signed by the
Khedive. He could strip Arabi of his title as Bey,
which was derived from himself. But he was obviously
powerless to deprive him of the dignity of Pasha, con-
ferred by the Sultan. As well might the Lord Lieu-
tenant of Ireland pretend to deprive an Irish Peer of
the title of nobility conferred by Her Majesty the
But, after all, It would have mattered little
had Tewfik’s power covered all his pretensions as to
these technical degradations. “The rank is but the
guinea stamp; the man’s the gold for a’ that." The
whole combined power of the paltry Tewfik and his
foreign upholders is impotent to affect any true dignity
which “Arabi the Egyptian,” as he proudly signs
himself, has acquired by his patriotic struggles.
William Wallace suffered forms of degradation
compared with which those inflicted upon Arabi
were child’s-play. He was hanged and disem-
bowelled, and his limbs gibbetted. Conceive John
Balliol — the Tewfik of Scotland — while upheld
in his spurious state as King of Scotland, by the arms
of Edward of England, to whom he did homage—de-
priving Robert Bruce of his rank as Earl of Carrick !
The cases would be parallel. The course of events has
rendered quite incontrovertible the position we main-
tained from the outset cf the trouble in Egypt. Even
the S. M. Herald, which early developed a Jingo
spirit, and referred to Arabi as a rebel, traitor, and
ruffian, and ridiculed his pretensions to be regarded as
representing a national sentiment, finds itself now
c unstrained by the force of events to publish such
statements as the following, which we quote from its
English letter: —“ The popular sympathy with Arabi
Pasha, except among the sycophants now in office at
Cairo, is almost as great as it was before the fall of the
the rebel leader, and Mr, Gladstone may well ask
himself, ‘ To whom can the administration of Egypt
be entrusted when it is found that almost every public
man was in favour of Arabi’s movement, and that the
mass of the population were in sympathy with it ? ’ ”
Arabi was, then, a national leader all the time! The
Bulletin stood almost alone in deducing from the
first that obvious truth from the accessible facts of the
situation. But, again, he was a rebel. The Herald
never mentioned him except as the rebel Arabi. He
instigated the massacres at Alexandria. The Jingo
Press, both here and in England, constantly reiterated
that assertion, despite the circumstance that the few pri-
soners who fell into his hands were treated with remark-
able humanity. He is brought to trial, and his doom at
first seems sealed. But no sooner does his son produce
from their hiding-place the documentary evidence for
the defence than the whole proceedings collapse.
Arabi has proved—for no one has lately ventured to
controvert his proofs and assertions —that, to quote
his own letter to the Times, “ The war was in accord-
ance with the laws of God and man, consonant to a
solemn decree of a Council under the presidency of the
Khedive and Dervish Pasha, the Envoy of the Sultan.
And after the soldieis and inhabitants had left Alexan-
dria, the Khedive returned and went over to those who
were fighting against his country—a thing prohibited
by every law. The entire Egyptian nation was unani-
mous as to the necessity of suspending Tewfik Pasha
for having transgressed the prescription of the Divine
and highest law, and demanded the continuation of the
defence of the country by a decree which was made
known to his Majesty the Sultan After that, are we
rebels ? I say that we were defending our country in a
way approved by the laws of God and man, and who-
ever says the contrary does not speak the truth, but,
on the contrary, is a slave to passion and money."
After that, who is disgraced by this “ degrading busi-
ness ” ? Is it the defeated Patriot, or the miserable
Bailiff in possession, styled the Khedive, or the foreign
intruders who have crushed the germ of national
aspirations, and pinion the Patriot while the Traitor
spits in his face ? Exit Arabi ! To Ceylon; anywhere,
so that he may be forgotten, it that be possible, and the
recollection of our national shame be huddled away with
him to the ends of the earth.

There is only one paper in the whole world which would
stoop to publish any report emanating from such a
body of men. That paper is the S.M. Herald. Just
cast your eye over the names printed above. As well
t have a report signed by eleven crayfish, or bullfrogs, or
I conger-eels. The report has cost thousands of pounds,
f and its value is of the kind which is guaged by the
{ amount of butter which can be wrapped in a page. It
is one of the legacies of the Parses Ministry, and has
J served no other purpose than to provide fees for a lot
| of people who might be useful or dangerous according
to their disposition towards the Government.
The letter of Dr. Pickburn with respect to the death
of the late Mr. Bardwell would be entirely satisfactory
but for one circumstance. The doctor states as a
matter of fact a circumstance regarding which he can
have no direct knowledge. It will alleviate the force of
prevailing doubts and rumours relative to the cause of
Mr. Bardwell s death to know on Dr. Pickburn's
authority that the deceased gentleman was suffering
from dropsy coupled with angina pectoris. The agonies
inflicted by the species of heart disease mentioned by
Dr. Pickburn are undeistood to be such as to excite a
predisposition to suicide. And it seems very likely,
therefore, that Mr. Bardwell's wound was inflicted by
his own hand. If that were unmistakeably demon-
strated no one would blame Dr. Pick burn for stretching
a point and giving a certificate ascribing the cause of
death to the organic disease of the patient, without
mentioning the self-inflicted wound which possibly
accelerated the death of the deceased by shock, even
although it reached no vital part. But when Dr. Pick,
burn writes, “ I was sure that the wound he had
inflicted upon himself in no way contributed to or even
hastened his death,” he goes far beyond his province
Dr. Pickburn did not see Mr. Bardwell inflict the
wound upon himself. With all deference to the doctor’s
professional knowledge, it seems more than probable
that a scissors stab inflicted upon an aged man in very
precarious health would accelerate his death even
although self-inflicted, and although the sufferer from
heart-disease had suffered no agitation such as a
murderous assault would occasion. The case is
certainly one for searching inquiry.
The Hospital Committee has not yet made public the
result of the investigation held by its own members on
its own alleged shortcomings. But an inquiry so con-
ducted can scarcely have any other but a farcical
result. A capital letter signed “ Nous Vkrrons," in

THEGREAT
ONE OP THE WORLD'S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
T N& reoent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Trickett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as hig opinion,
«I have found St, JACOB’S OIL a sure and certain
Onre, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on by ovor-ex-
ertlon In rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble."
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who know what he was talking about; and now he pays
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

VISITORS TO SYDNEY, before returning home,
take a walk through the Showrooms of the Royal Fur-
nishing Arcade not necessarily to buy,|but to see what
the place is really like.
MANY PERSONS
feel n delicacy about entering a place of business merely
to have a look, without any intention of buying j but
these are the very visitors we like to see. We have
made a great effort to make our house of business
specially attractive at this seasou, and we welcome
every one to whom our Exhibition is interesting.
OUR NEW BOOK,
the Economical House Furnishing Guide, is freely dis.
tributed daily, every visitor is entitled to a copy, also
to one of our little Toilet Table Almanac for 1883.
THE TELEPHONE.
Numbers of persons, especially those living in tho
country who have heard and read so much about the
wonders of the Telephene, have never had an oppor-
tunity of seeing one. Our city is at the present time
full of visitors, and we shall be glad indeed if we can
add oven in a small measure to their enjoyment. Tele-
phones are not altogether scarce in the city, but much
as our country friends would like to see one, they would
not know where to go to see it. We therefore issue a
free invitation to one and all to come and see ours. It
connects our office with the factory at Woolloomooloo
Bay, through it we can pass all orders, and converse
with the foreman or any of out assistants in the easiest
manner possible.
This week we wish to bring prominently forward our
£70 House list. It is one of the most carefully com-
piled, and as an example of good value will doubtless
receive a good deal of attention.

A banquet was given by the the literati of New
Vork to Herbert Spencer on his leaving for England.
Ho v Ward Beecher said the distinguished sociologist
attempting a greater w..rk than any other man in
this aee had accomplished, and hoped that, in spite of
detractors, Spencer would live to hear one unbroken
testimony from all America to the immense value of the
services he had rendered humanity.
The Mayor of Rockhampton wants the Corpo-
ration to pay for the banquet given by him in honour
of the visit of the Premier (Sir Thomas M'llwraith) to
the City of Sin, Sweat, and Sorrow, but tbe rest of the
aldermen don't seem to “ see ’’ it. One alderman, who
was very enthnsias'ie and quite indefatigable before the
banquet, has since the advent of the financial crisis,
dropped quietly out and taken a back seat.
Mortimer Franklyn has suddenly appeared in

The Club fellows there are mad with jealousy whenever
they view his elaborate watch-chain, his lovely “ mwj-
taohe ’’ his elegant clothes, and the total genteel com-
pleteness of the man. And yet this ethereal being is
only a newspaper editor and proprietor I Some moral
reflections should come in about here, but we have no
time to waste just now.
The Rev. Dr. Bleasdale, once a shining light at
St. Francis’ E. C. Cathedral at Melbourne, and even
better known as the chief wine-expert of Australia, is
at present resident in San Francisco. The Eev. Dr.
has subdued the clerical cut of his garments, and
looks like a Congregational lay preacher. He is on the
stiff of the San Francisco News Letter, as a oontri.
hntor cf scientific jottings, and has done some service
by making and publishing analyses of the liquors served
out to the public in the “ dives " and saloons of the
city.
Mr. Abbey went to Pope’s Villa, to engage
Mrs. Langtry for America, on the 25ch June. Mr. and
Mrs. Labouohera were there, and, as the contract was
being concluded, the Prince of Wales was announced,
with some companions. He talked all round, was
introduced to Abbey by the Lilv. and regretted that
England was being robbed. Miss Braddon. the novelist,
was also present. The Prince is not affected, as might
be imagined from the manners of foolish fops who are
supposed to ape him. and the lah-di-dah lisp is not
traceable in his words at all. It is principally confined
to upstarts.
The breach of promise action pending against
Mr. Joa Biggar, M P., member (or Cavan, is causing a
good deal of amusement. Egan, the Land Lsague
secretary, is a witness for the lady, whom Joseph
eoooantersd in Paris, aad the promise is not to be
denied, though Mr. B. pleads that he is hard up. Egan,
on the other hand, disputes this, yelling derisively in
Joe’s ear that‘‘pigs’s riz." Biggar’s chance with a
Saxon jury is thought by Truth to be very green. Thus,
it seems, if we are to believe recent cables, Joseph is
just about getting it all round. Well, well: let him
cheer up. He has at least one sympathiser in Sydney.
Eh, Dan., dear ?
The Nihilistic Prince Krapotkinc, who, the
cable tells us, has just got into trouble ia France, is
one of the most uuprinceliko princes it ia possible to
imagine. His bald head, shaped like a ooooanut, has a
fringe of long greasy hair, covering the nape of his
neck; a stiff beard covering his chin, and a slight
bristly moustache being all the hair on his face. Ho
wears spectacles with vary thin wires, which are
twisted round his oars to secure the glasses in their
place oa his decidedly snub and plebeian nose. He is
much more like a broken down secularist lecturer, who
has taken under the stress of events to soiling coals
on commission, than anybody else.
Lord Napier, of Magdala, has been made a

the Gat Old Girl of Hunter-street, in

scion of the old French nobility. It ia a small circular

Thus the World “ Everybody is happy to
know that ‘Fred’ Archer is completely above the
world, and has, from hie own investments, or rather
those which Lord Falmouth has counselled him to
make, an independent income which would enable
him to retire to-morrow, and live handsomely ever
after. The famous jockey’s marriage with pretty Miss
Nellie Dawson is to take place about Christmas. The
new house tor the happy pair ia neatly furnished. It is
beyond * the Duchess’s,’ on the same side of the road
as Hammond’s, and is of red brick with stone dressing,
a handsome dwelling, with conservatory, kitchen-
garden, hothouses, walls for fruit, shrubbery, lawn, and
stables, all complete, even to the mastiff. There is,
however, a skeleton in a oloset, or rather there will be,
for there is now fitting up a perfect Turkish bath for
Archer to reduce himself to as nearly a perfect skeleton
as may be.”
Why is the latest valuable addition to colonial
literature entitled “ Some names written in a birthday
book the property of Sir Henry Parkes ?” Perhaps it
is that Sir Henry wished to most emphatically impress
upon his unfortunate admirers that the book has
actually been paid for, and is therefore the lawful
property of tho distinguished Premier. We are now
informed that the favoured "three hundred” whose
names are >ept dark, do not include the late Mr.
O’Farrell, Francis Christie, Esq . alias Gardiner, or
Black Alfred, who was hanged at Madgee. Dean Swift
told us some time ago that "Vain men delight in telling
what honors have been done them, what great company
they have kept, and the like; by which they plainly
confess that their honors were more than their due,
and each as their friends would not believe it they had
been told; whereas a man truly proud, thinks tho
greatest honors below his merit, and consequently
acorns to boast.”
Mrs. Langtry, it is said on good authority, has
not produced so favourable an impression in New York
society as might have been expected. Tho chief cause
of this is that she was not properly introduced; for
amongst the crowd of persons who went to meet her
down the bay there was not a single prominent name in
the social world. She was gua-t at a grand dinner of
Dr. Phelps, the day before her ddbut, at which all the
professionals were present, and in the evening went to
a reception at Mrs. Oroly’s (wife of editor, Dailt
Graphic) j but the crime seemed undecided how to
taka the beauty. However, she is doing well, both off
and on the stage. She sat for her photo at Sarony’s,
and, on returning to her carriage, the manager banded
har “ a little cheque” for her trouble. It was lor
£150. The Americans don’t consider Lily paid them
any compliment by saying they “are as polite as French-
men :” they already consider themselves a little above
the French veneer. Mrs. Langtry has been ofl<red£600
a week to play in Australia and N.Z. when her six
months* American engagement is ended.
The Express “ is authorised to state that his
Grace the Archbishop of Sydney will temporarily leave
ns, in April next, on a visit to the Eternal City. Much
as the Catholics of the Archdiocese will feel the de-
partme of the illnstrions prelate, who has laboured so
energetically but lovingly for them, and with them,
during a decade et years, they must not forget that his
projected visit is one of his episcopal duties, and one
likely to be fraught with much spiritual good to the
Church in Australia. His Grace will lay at the shrine
of the Apostles, S3. Peter and Panl, his fervent prayers
for the temporal and eternal welfare of hie flock, and
perhaps solace the afflicted heart of the Holy Father,
Leo XlIL, by strong assurances of their loyalty to the
Hely See and the sincerity of their faith. We shall, of
course, supply our readers with details of his Grace’s
movements previously to his departure. He will, we
are informed, make a visitation of the Archdiocese
before that (in one sense regretful) event occurs. It ia
satisfactory to learn that he will be accompanied on his
long journey ‘by sea and land' by the Very Eev. Dr.
Gillett, Sector of St. John's College, University.” His
Eminence tbe Cardinal Archbishop, eh ?
Messrs. Hunt and Bowman, members of the
Victorian Assembly, hate " pizen strong” J. B. Patter,
son, also one of the popular idols of the Cabbage Garden.
J. B. P. is the Assembly's fiery Protestant, who is
always discovering “Popish plots,” and trying the
sectarian war-cry. He is deolamativo, passionate, and
vindictive He has even been known to cry with rage
during a Parliamentary speech, when he was baited by
David Gaunaon. Hunt and Bowman are, of course,
holy Eomans, and they retort vigorously upon the
opponent, whom they ate pleased to designate a
" cattle-duffer ’’ —a reference to some obsoura scandal
of former times. A Parliamentary rhymester has im-
mortalised Hunt and Patterson’s attitude in the follow-
ing doggerel
“ Ireland was old Ireland
When England was a pnp,
And Ireland will be Ireland
When England’s bursted up.
“ I am a pious Catholic,
And hope to join the blest.
And Mr. J. B. Patterson
Can do his level best.”
Again, Mia. Langtry. Only a few words. The
Earl of Dnoie. though a married man, is what is known
in common parlance as a “ woman-hater.” When Mrs
Langtry's fame as a popular beauty was at its height
in London, and her name and doings were on every
tongue, he went so far in bis expressions of disapproval
of what he termed the popular craze as to declare ne
would neither willingly go to a ball where she was te
be present, nor be introduced to her should chance
throw him into her company. The week after, the
high-toned misogynist was at Lord Sherbarne’s to
dinner, and, coming into the the drawing-room, sud-
denly found himself face to face with the Lily. With
a start he was turning to go, when Lady Sherborne,
who saw the aotien and determined to punish him for
his all but rudeness, quickly advanced, and, ere his
lordship oould realize what she was doing, introdaeed
him. Of course, he had to stop and say something,
He had intended to slip away after a minute or two.
But he didn’t. People who knew his opinions were
surprised to see him linger on and on, and, in short, he
never loft the dreaded beauty’s aide all the evening,
looking positively impatient when any one diverted her
attention for a moment. And yet she didn’t go out of
her way to be agreeable to him, but just looked at and
talked to him as she does to everybody else.
It isn’t often, even after dinner, that speakers
utter snch bosh as did Mr. Richardson-Garner member
of the House of Comu.oHS, at the dinner given to tbe
Life Guards on their return from Egypt. Said he:—
" The brilliant charge at Kassassin, the aseault-at-
nrais at Tcl-el- Kebir, the march to Cairo, remind ns of
the great heroes of old. It reminds us of Miltiades,
who on the field of Marathon overthrew the Persian
hosts. It reminds us of the navy of Themistooles,
which, at Salamis, conquered tbe great fleet opposed to
him. It reminds ns of Leonidas, who, at the pass of
Thermopylae with three hundred Spartans at his back,
opposed a Rost of thousands of Persians, who tried to
get through. It reminds ns of Alexander the Great
and his Macedonian army who fonght Darina and
resisted his hordes, and sent them, as you did the Egyp-
tians, like chaff before the wind. I was for many years
in command of the Volunteers, and I oould take my 760
men to the Brighton Review, and every one of them
only envies you the success yon have attained, and
wonld have been glad to have stood by your side.”
This is indeed praise I The Life Gaards mast have been
proud to think that their deeds oonld have sailed into
the mind of a Commander of Volunteers snch a pano-
rama of glory—Marathon, Salamis, Thermopylae, Alex,
ander, Darius, and (let the martial music shriek its
loudest at the name)) Eiohardson-Oorner, with 700
Volunteers at Brighton Review 1
That dismal donkey, Martin Tapper, has leaned
“ Dramatis Pieces, with an Exterior Illustration
designed by the Author." A London paper, reviewing
this publication, speaks of Mr. Toppers monstrous
se'f-oomplaoenoy, his grotesque vanity, and his magni-
ficent stupidity, which if not utterly sublime is at least
quite too all but. “ The speciality of this theatrical
volume of mine,” writes our groat philososher, " is its
historic truthfulness ;’’ another still more prominent
feature is its abysmal dullness. " The directly comic
element," he proceeds, “is by intention not prominently
represented ;” this is “ dreadful true}” but when he
adds that “ a due amount of cheerful humour will be
found in its fit place, as well as pathos elsewhere,” we
cannot quite follow him. Perhaps by elsewhere he means
in other books, in which case we agree with him ; bnt
so far as this book is concerned, in spite of a good deal
of unintentional comicality of a true though negative
kind, we have found it as hard to force a smile as to
shed a tear over these pages. The book, however, con-
tains some valuable information ; we learn, for instance,
that Mr. Tappet’s ooat-of-arms consists (we are not
sure of the proper heraldic terms) of three pigs and
three oyster shells ; we learn also that the poet’s name
was formerly spelt Toupard, and is derived from Topp
Herr; also that the poet tried to get the name into
Macaulay’s history, but that his lordship insolently
refused it admission ; and last, not least, we learn from
the “ exterior illustration" that Mr. Tapper is, if
possible, a worse artist than he is poet.
Where ia Langtry ? There arrived in New
York a few days ago, observes the Wasp, a lady known
as Mrs. Langtry, who ia said to be good-looking, and
who aots on the stage. Oscar Wilde went down to meet
her, and her arrival set a theatre on fire. These cir-
cumstances induced some people to take an interest in
her, and—in Langtry. Assuming she would be sure to be
taken care of, they set ont to hunt up Mr, Langtry.
They went to her hotel; he hadn’t been heard of. By
and bye, a gaunt, hnngry-looking man came up and
asked if he might come in P The footman threw him
out; burglar, no donbt. The committee looked over
heaps of newspapers, and made exhaustive inquiries;
they found references to the beautiful Mrs. Langlry,
bnt nothing about any beantifnl Mr. Langtry, nor any
evidence to show that-,anyone had ever seen him, or even
desired to sea him. Seeing no other chance of eliciting
information, they then went to tbe lady herself, and
inquired if she knew a Mr. Langtry. She thought a
few minutes, and then said she believed she had known
snob a man once, but wasn’t sure. Was he toll and
thin ? Oh, yes, then, she knew him, if she remembered
correctly; bnt it was a long time ago. and really her

pressed further, however, Mrs. Langtry said she could
not be certain of him ; it was merely possible he had
been an old friend onee. The committee concluded
that the existence et an individual named Langtry is
dnlious, and, further, that, it he does exist, it is so
evident he has outlived bis usefulness that his fate is
too densely uninteresting to the general pnblio to ren-
der it worth while bothering about him.

From our Adelaide correspondent ; —* Mr.
Grattan Riggs is accounted by pressmen over here the
histrionic wonder of this century. He is the only actor
who has ever been known to lake advice. The dramatic
critics of this city ventured timorously to suggest that
he should keep the ‘ Shaughran' on the board i as long
as it would run, it being the only decent drama in his
repertoire. Well, he did. But even this phenomenal
complaisance was not sufficient to make his show a
success. The fact is we are dead tired of him, and of
all the other monotonies who visit this oily as regularly
as the measles We are not infants or idiots to be
s mused with the same threadbare stuff for ever.
Besides, Mr. Riggs is getting so fat that timid people
don’t oa r o to see him dance a jig now. They don’t
owe to run the risk of having their bodies dug out of
the debris of the theatre. And also once to see him as
an Irishman is to see him for all time. He even hannts
von in your dreams. It would seem that there is no
possible stage Irishman but one. Perhaps, however,
this is just as well. When this single type is so
wearisome we hardly think we could stand a whole
fount. We have fallen upon evil dramatic days. There
are mntterings and vague assertions that ‘ there is a
big row on,’ but we can’t find out for certain whether
it is a European complication, a dog-fight, or a disagree-
ment between our corps dramatique and their boss. And
we don’t care much ; though we would rather it was a
dog-fight, for the sake of the superior fun. And, by the
way, this brings to my jaded recollection the fact that
the Lynch Family are to appear for a few days at the
Town Hall. Also that a Variety company, known as
Lyons’s Tourists, aro billed to show in the Academy
shortly Of course, at this season, charity concerts by
amateurs abound, and afford immense gratification—to
the amateurs. Taking all these troubles into account,
isn’t it a blessed miracle that there are enough people
left alive here to makeup an andieace P And, speaking
of this, Adelaide is to he know in future as “ Riggs’s
Befnge, or the Gravediggers’ Paradise.”
* * * *
This is what the manager of the Surrey Theatre
says of his new play “For Ever.” It is is the most
ultra-sensational play ever written or conceived. (Are
yon listening to this, George Darrell P): “ Seven acts
of realism and emotion.” (Fancy, all that, George—
for a shilling). “It is the most fantastic, inhuman,
human, horrible, blood-curdling, terrible, savage,
weird, revolting, fascinating, and attractive play ever
produced. Nothing like this dramatic creation has
ever been seen upon the stage. It has no prototype.
It is the quintessence of grotesqneness. It is a mar-
vellous physiological and psychological study, marked
by the purest originality of conception and power of
execution.” Of course, the adjectives are a bit mixed
here and there; hut then, the butcher who wrapped onr
tripe in the paper from which we culled that critieism
says he always buys his “waste” at the Bum em-
porium.
* * * *
Kellar and Cunard, the Illusionists, after a good
season in Auckland, N. Z., opened in Napier on Boxing
Night. They play in the latter town for ten nights,
end then in all probability will return to Sydney. As
Kellar is very clever in his line, and did not get a good
reception when he was here last time, in consequence
no doubt of the number of tea-meetings and sandwich
shivoos that were going on just then, we hope the
public will give him a fair show when he comes back
here. We don’t know why we are so good-natured as
to hope all this, but probably it is because we have
nothing else to do just now. And speaking of Auck-
land, Stanley and Darbyshire’s youngsters are playing
there in the Pantomime.

The dear old party who does those funny

Joe Brown, of Melbourne, lineal descendant of
the immortal John of that name, whose soul ever goes
marching on, is in a state of jubilate over his panto-
mime. The only thing ho isn't perfectly satisfied with
is the length of the dresses of the virgins who perform
in it. Joe is an admirer of nature, and has got his stage
Venus in a dress as nearly resembling that of her proto-
type as oironmstances will permit. “Maecotte” will
go for a while, though the Aoe gives it a terrible dress-
ing down—says Maggie Moore is absolutely vulgar,
Verdi out of tune, and so on. The Opera House people
at sixes and sevens—why, will be known ere long. The
big musical festival has been more than big enough for
the pookets of the guarantors. Eeason : Too much edu-
cation in the opera-bonffe and dancing-fairy business.

A few foreign items. The divine Sarah has been
engaged for fifty representations in South American
theatres, chiefly in Brazil, and is to receive £30,000
A drama entitled “La Dame an Domino Rose” has
been hissed in Paris for its obscenity. People can
amuse themselves by trying to imagine how mneh
obscenity should be required to turn up the noses of
the fair creatures who gloated over “Nana” and
** L’Assommoir." Miss Lila Clay’s Ladies’ Orches-
tra has been a great novelty in London, and a great
success. Seventy “ picked pretty girls ” sitting in
rows, the first all red, next all yellow, then blue, the
last fading away into lilac and primrose. The dresses
of the damsels descend to the knee when they stand,
but when seated the hoseal display is more extensive.

The people like the pantomime. They crow at
Mr. Gordon's scenery —the like has certainly never been
seen at any Australian theatre—they " rise” at Johnny
Hall, they jell at Harry Leston, and they shriek at
Maggie Knight. All this is very well. But critically
noticing these pretty players in the cool of a breezy
morning is a different thing to critically reviewing them
from either a pit stand-point or a dross circle coign of
vantage. It is necessary to say, then, that the best
performer in the whole piece is Miss Dooy Stewart, and
it is to be greatly regretted that she was not oast for a
more prominent character. It’s Stewart on Dooy that
she hasn’t a better show, but this little matter will ha
remedied tantot. It is only then that the harassed
author will be enabled to indulge in the Docy far nienfa.
s ♦ ♦
Johnny Hall is funny, of course, but he would
be fnnnior if you oonld hear all he says and something
of what he sings. And you can sometimes often —or,
rather let ns say, often sometimes. Miss Jessie Grey is
as pretty as a picture, and as she has only just—(“no
cakes, no cards," Ac.,) we should not expect that—at the
same time when —not that we have the slightest int —
Just so 1 Well, Maggie Knight is a very clover little
woman, indeed—in comedy ; but unfortunately the
Theatre Royal is not quite large enough to enable the
timbre of her voice to be fully appreciated. What Miss
M Knight could fill effectually would he—Wynyard
Square.

Mr, Sam. Poole is good ; but, not playing an
ho lacked light and shade—especially shade!
Harry Lesion’s Wee-ping is a very fine performance. It
!s only second, indeed, to the Shi-ning of «iiss Stewart,
whose fine ringing voice does justice to every line
entrusted to her. And how does she look ?—
How does she look ? You’ve seen the sun
Soft fllt’ring through clouds breezy;
You’ve seen—but, hang it— there I —we’ve done.
Just ask us something easy.
The greatest draw in the pantomime is, perhaps, the
Mathews Family. These acrobats are very great,
indeed. Nothing like their performance has ever been
seen in Sydney. la the Magic Cave scene they are here,
there, and everywhere. It is rather fortunate for us.
though, that they are here. Theodore, who's the boys’
. a . has a dawg (an Italian greyhound) which performs
i® the harlequinade The intelligence of this animal
will be a fatal impediment to its ever entering Parlla-
ment. The Mathews Family are exceedingly daring.
r|°thing, it seems, in the way of acrobatism, ean any of
them injure. This leads people to the conclusion that
they a re made 0 f injure-rubber.
The piece has been excellently staged, and the
actors have been very finely coached—we can't help this
—by Mr. Harry Vincent, and a young person by the
name of Grace Henriqnes leads the Amazons, and is
thrown bonqnets. People are outside the theatre on
camp stools at 7.

Mr. Mngrave gave a picnic last Sunday. He
only invited one pressman, and he didn't come. The
disappointment caused Maggie Knight to sprain her
ankle.

Millis has left with his new entertainment —
“ Mr. Poppinjay’s Picnic." The author has received a
very complimentary letter about it from little
Frederick. We won’t say who the author is, or when
the “ King of Ventriloquists" plays here—some side-of-
bacon critics might be Millicious.

Duncan Maoallum’s “ Tambour Major ” is at
Nelson, and tho success of the crowd continues.
Liddiard (Fanny) it> doing great things. All the swells
are dead gene on her. But then, yon see, she is so
cemeterycal. And let ns state that Milner Stephen’s
healing circus is at Napier. He cured a boy there of
dumbness, but it was subsequently discovered that the
boy couldn’t speak. Jennie Lee seems to be at Dnne-
din, albeit her “Jo” hasn’t particularly got ’em; but
Macoaba is scooping it in wholesale. The Derbyshire
kids are doing “Jack the Giant Killer ” at the Thames
Goldfields; and Kellar and Canard are playing to
several relations of the hall-keeper at Auckland. And,
finally, Tennyson’s play, “ The Promise of May," at
the London Globe, is a fearful failure. Anent it, Teddy
Oxentord writes in Society : —
“ So let me give a little bit of counsel to the Laureate,
His knowledge of the stage and world is not exactly
aureate.
When next he writes a play, he should not deal with
creeds heretical,
Bat make the piece more practical, and not quite so
poetical.”
Very neat, eh ?
** * *
It is a pleasing instance of the ** eternal fitness
of things " that what the Rum— the poor old Rum—
carps at, is sure t-i succeed. For instance in point,
is the Theatre Royal pantomime, which has, np to the
present time, drawn more money than any piece that
has ever been produced at the T.R. Thus the manage-
ment have good reason if) be thankful to the little
Melbourne Flicker ; and they also ewa a debt of
gratitude to the Mail. In that jonrnal, the nice clean
old lady who “does” the critical part of the paper says
that Mr. Reece’s burlesque has been “ vulgarised,” and
thus essays to throw “reticule" on the unfortunate
colonial anther. On the sub j ect of 11 Aladdin " the Echo
is sombre—not to say mournful. It considers that a
pantomime ought not to be localised at all—except, of
course, by such alabaster-browed geniuses as do congre-
gate in Hunter-street. Now, when Mr Williamson
was casting about far a local author—for “ locals," the
paying portion of the audience will have, despite the
indignation of tha bread-and-butter bards who do not
write them—he endeavoured to secure the man who
wrote editorials for the Rum. Failing in discovering
this genius (whe, perhaps, has no fixed place of abode),
he was interviewed by another gifted journalist who
proposed to undertake the work for—well, a really verv
moderate sum, Knt, blind to his own interests, Mr. W
declined. He didn't consider that a succession of
assured good notices would make the success of the piece.
His experience, he said, taught him otherwise. An
average of £349 a night at the Royal is " otherwise.”
* * * *
Mrs. W. E. Chapman (Misa Kate Thayer) has
been giving some concerts at the Masonic Hall, and
several people, including the melodious Kate, have
been doing various things. Of Miss Kate Thayer, (N.Y.)
Music and Drama says she has been “an enormous
snccef s in Australia.” We know this to be true, became
Miss T. is so charming. Mrs. Harry Woods didn’t
show, being indisposed, and the concerts suffered some-
what thereby. But though Thayer showed at the
Masonio, thore were many other attractions at each
otherThayerter. However, wa heard William read, so
we are happy Wa advise W. E. to read again. He is
almost as good as a circus,
** * *
By the way, it turns ont that Vincent Wallace,
who composed “ Maritana,” had two wives during his
life, and divorced one of them. Now the kids of both
are fighting for the legitimacy—and canvassing for
subscriptions. One son hangs ont in New Mexico.
Public opinion is also suspended. And this reminds
us that Charles Wyndham, of the Criterion, is to visit
Australia, and play “ Brighton," and “ Little Miss
Muffet,” for the benefit of the clergy. And let us fit in
the item that Mrs. Langtry changes her hair in every
scene.” This is written seriously—not halronically.
Oh, and poor Chiarini has gone blind. This comes ef
trying to read the Evunooze by twilight. This natu-
rally suggests the fact, that at the Protestant Hall,
Newcastle, the amateurs have been rehearsing
“ Patience.” The local Fletcher “ congratulates onr
amateurs npon their success, so far.” This is good.
* * * *
“ Sinbad,” at the Gaiety, has been drawing good
houses. When you go the Gaiety now, you ean take off
your overcoat and muffler. There is not much chance
of catching a cold. The burlesque is a lively affair,
because Mr. Towers, who really has quite a great talent
for that sort of thing, extracts a very good deal of fun
ont of the part of Ally Sloper—which he makes up after
the well-known pictures in Judy. But Mr. Towers, like
Mr. Dampier (and Don Bolero), is “ a happy father,”
and therefore he insists in putting up his “kids” in
good parts—which we suppose is only natural. We were
on deeply affectionate terms with Dampier before we
pointed ont gently that the public was getting " Jack ’’
about the “ kid" characters, and then he hated ns
“with a hate known only on the stage.” We were
unhappy at first, but we bore np. When Alfred used to

“ Sinbad ’ was originally written by Mr. Frank
W. Green, a Londonjauthor, who, if Mr. Towers's copy
can be believed in, either has a contempt for the
mechanism of heroics—or no knowledge of it. Let us say
the former. Mr. Green’s piece has been peppered with
locals, and has been enriched (thisisa good word) with
a patriotic song, written for the fair Rosa by Mr. Grey.
This song is about the Egyptian war, and cricket and
several things. The only thing, we think, it does net
contain, is a recipe for making salad, or a suggestion
how to make a Shroud reporter’s bluchers watertight.
Rosa plays Sinbad, and she certainly looks very charm,
ing, and acts, as the Rum hath it, with a large amount
of “nerve"—which, of coarse, is Dubbo for verve. But
Miss Towers is not very strong “on the sing.” Still,
her performance is very clever withal, and she is sur-
passingly (we may say this, being excessively wedded)
symmetrical.

Mias May Vivian plays Abdallah, the captain of
the ship, and, though she is quite dazzling in appear-
ance, one feels, whilst she is on, that she requires a
larger theatre. Three Miss Vivians standing in a row
would shut out all chance of seeing the transformation
scene. But Miss V. is very pleasant, all things con-
sidered, and so is Miss Vergie Vivian, a child actress
who is fast Vergie-ing on womanhood This is an ex-
ceedingly promising young lady, and, unless wo are
greatly mistaken, will do great things shortly, and con-
siderably exorcise the minds (shall we say minds ?) of
the young men with the. high shirt collars and low fore-
heads. Etnah is played by Miss Harriet Tulloch (who
is Mrs. Seagkave when she is at home P) and she does a
song and dance, with more dance than song in it. About
this Princess, Frank Towers makes an outrageous joke.
He says, speaking of his daughter,
“ Her name is Etnah—how I lava,"
which would be the best of all Frank Green's jokes if
he wrote it— only he didn’t, Johnny O’Neil is very
funny as an old woman; and Tom Buokloy gets some
chances ont of Cetewayo, some of which he misses, and
some of which he makes. We like Tom always, and
we like him almost better in burlesque than when
getting all the fat in Shakesperian pieces. Then there
is little Katie, who, as we have gently hinted, is a bore.
Frank, with a father’s fondness, has given her a lot of
local lines (instead of taking them himself, or giving
them to Rosa), and the effect of her elocution on the
audience is depressing. No one can make ont what in
sulphur it’s all about: whether she is reciting the Boy
upon the Burning Deck, or worrying the story of
Joseph and his brethren. But Frank is tip-top, and
the boys that form Rosa’s regiment don’t smell very
bad; therefore the thing, all said, is quite satisfactory.

Miss Emelie Melville produced “Fantinitza”
on Boxing Night, and the people didn’t seem to like it
much—but that was their bad taste. We saw it, and
liked it a great deal. This opera of Von Suppd’s has
been given before at the Opera House, with Kollv as
the General, and la diva Wangenheim in the title-role.
But the general impression was that Emma opened her
month too wide, and people, who couldn't lash capstan-
bars to their hicks, were afraid to go. So it didn't
“catch on." This is the same “Fatinitza,” but a
different crowd. Emelie can’t open her month too
wide for us. Tha wider she opens it, the more chance
we have of —now this is qnite new—reading her heart.
Miss Melville, as Fatinitza, was particularly great;
sad so was Cassell! as Julian Hardy, the war corres-
pondent : and so was Parley as Count Timofey Gavri-

The Rev. Charles Strong.
The vigorous writer, and leader of the advanced
school of religious thought in the Presbyterian
circles of Australia, whose portrait we present to-
day, is minister of the Soots’ Church, Melbourne,
a position from which, about eighteen months
ago, a determined effort was made to oust him, by
dogmatists of the old Cameronian type. The
cause was an article contributed by Mr. Strong to
the Yictobian Review, in which the modified
views respecting the atonement now commonly
held by broad churchmen were discussed with ap-
parent complacency, or, at any rate, without any
expression of dissent. For this article Mr. Strong
was fiercely assailed by a section in the Presby-
tery"; but, suppported by the secular press, and
by a preponderating majority of his own_co»gre-
gation, who threatened to secede with him were
he displaced, he prevailed over his assailants.
Mr. Strong continues his ministrations with suc-
cess and aoceptableness, and without having in
any way diverged from the line of candid inquiry
which drew upon him the anathemas of his older
brethren in the ministry. There is a general
expectation that, from the pronounced character
of Mr. Strong’s teachings, a fresh effort to separ-
ate him from the Presbyterian communion will,
ere long, be commenced.
The Election of Speaker.
The Hon, Edmund Barton, whose portrait
again give in this issue, is Speaker of the Legisla-
tive Assembly of New South Wales. This fact is
a distinct sign of the times. Mr. Barton has dis-
placed a gentleman who had occupied the position
for so long, that not only he himself but many
persons not in the habit of striking out lines of
thought for themselves, had regarded the office as
Sir George’s prescriptive right. Sir George
Wigram Allen had been enabled, by the possession
of great wealth, to bring to the post those out-
ward semblances of dignity and state which look
so very like the real article. An habitual ponder-
ousness of demeanour was not readily distinguish-
able from the gravity which is popularly, but
erroneously, supposed to indicate a weight of wis-
dom. He had been charged with evincing
partiality, but the indications of his pre-
ferences had been so veiled in a conventional
decorum of address and deportment that it
had been difficult to fasten definite accusations
upon him. Sir George was moreover a representa-
tive Speaker—the representative of a long stand-
ing system of preference for appearances over
realities —the representative, moreover, of the
old school of legislators, now happily falling into
disregard. This class were habitually professors
of liberalism, but their liberalism was superanu-
ated, and hardly distinguishable from the con-
servatism of to-day. The world of thought, of
ideas, and of systems have moved rapidly onward
sinoe their conceptions were fully formed and
definitely fixed; but they have remained sta-
tionary, hugging the theories of twenty years
ago, and fondly conceiving that what was
reckoned advanced liberalism then, remains ac-
knowledged liberalism to-day. Sir George
Allen represents the school of politicians which
studied to rule Australia by imported and
adapted methods. But the day has dawned
when Australia shall be governed by Aus-
tralians, and the preference shown by a
majority of the present Assembly for Mr.
Edmund Barton is the first gun which
marks the commencement of the war be-
tween the new system and the old. Mr. Barton
represents the Young Australian party—the party
of progress, of downright plain-speaking, of
vigour preferred to fuss, of talent respected
before wealth, o f energy before conventional im-
mobility. Mr. Stuart, the leader of the Opposi-
tion, declined to vote in this division. If this be
an indication that Mr. Stuart, having put his
hand to the plough, is disposed to falter or turn
back, let him do so. He may return to the arms
of his early political associates, or find consolation
in the sympathy of bishops and deacons. Hia
defection might restore for a time the regime of
self-seeking and corruption, but the triumph of
Young Australia in its own House cannot be long
postponed.

At Adelaide it is generally considered that the

prisoners of his own nationality, but without influenc-
ing his hearers in the slightest degree.
Australia won the great cricket match —by good
luok. Our men won the toss, and, the wicket being
grand, gave the Englishmen the field. The Anglo-
Saxons batted at a wet wicket, made a small score, and
followed their innings. The luok was against them.
Massie wanted to do wonders, and the Englishmen put
him out with a duck-egg in each innings, which was
curried gruel for ns. Bannerman, Murdoch, and Bon-
ner wit h the bat, and Spefforth and Palmer with the
ball, pulled us through. The British Lion, conse-
quently, takes a little of the gruel he mixed for the
Kangaroo. Australia won by two runs and nine
wickets—in other words, by two runs and dry wickets.

PEPPER AND SALT.
We learn several things from the New Tear’s
number of the Morning Bum. Imprimis, that the Hon.
Stephen Campbell (I), Postmaster-General, aged 52,
is dead, and also that on New Year’s Eve, at the
pubs., the ” Tantorio (sic) race were not by any means
conspicuous by their absence in the more reputable of
the many hostelries the city boasts.” Why not
” Tartaric?” This reminds us of the never-to-be-
forgotten Sarsaparilla Troupe 1 But how can people
compose their ideas with a side of baeon under one
arm and a jug of beer under the other, both accepted
under the category of “ homage to genius ” and ” New
Teat’s gifts.” Ahem 1
He was a strict Israelite, and had just sat down
to the boarding-house goose, when he suddenly dis-
covered some “ Boar’s head ” porter on the table. He
then turned livid, and hurriedly rose from the table
with horror depicted in his countenance. ... It
transpired later, not only that he was a devout Hebrew,
bnt that he—ah—was interested in another Irani.
WLast [Friday, Policeman Vincenzio Amadia de
Flaherty picked up an elector on Hyde Park who had
evidently seen tetter days—about the time of the
Norman conquest. His hat was “ oonoertinaed,”
the tops of hia boots had dissolved partnership with the
soles, and his pants ware split from Dan to Bersheba.
One of hia arms were bent back at the elbow, his right
eye had crawled down to see if there was any loose
change in his waistcoat pockets, both his ears were
absent, the roof of his head was lying abont twent y
yards away, his face looked like a Christmas padding
after’an interview with a navvy, and his general ap-
pearance would lead an unprejudiced observer to believe
he had just been “tramoar’d.” Upon being ques-
tioned, he said he thought he had been too roughly
used, and all ha had done to deserve it was that ha
simply asked Mickey Eyan, of the ” Harp of Erin,”
to sign a ” spontaneous ’’ petition, requesting John
Davies to stand for East Sydney. The friends of the
deceased planted him out at Eookweod on the following

Now, would you have the latest bit of scandal,
Or weuld you have a sermon of John Banyan’s ;
Or eke a critique on the songs of Handel,
Or snake yarn, or a startling growth of onions.
Or Pastor Allen’s prose, or Sladen’s rhymes ?
Why, then, just buy and read the Camden Times.
The last startler in that amusing rag is on onions. The
enraptured editor declares that he has been “ shown a
very large onion grown on Mr. Arnold’s farm at Bazor-
back. It turned the scale at 2\ lb.” We arc not sur-
prised at that. Only fancy the luxury of meet-
ing the Camden Times man, in company with the
regulation country-editor’s allowance of rum, jnst after
he had interviewed that 2|ft. onion 1
No end to the vagaries of fashion. Nobody
dares guess how (ar they’ll go, and nobody has yet been
able to say whence they come. We hear of a princess
at a French watering place who wore a costume covered
with crawling crabs and prawns, with earrings of a
crustaceous character, and for a brooch a tiny limpet
cut from stone of the precise greyish tint of its proto-
type. There is much appropriateness in a fish costume
like this if worn by a husband-huntress, and as it takes
very little to influence some men, such a trifle might
turn'the scales!
A King-street Poet.
We have received a four-page pamphlet of poetry,
printed on paper the hue of which is suggestive of
pink tights. At the top of the title-page there is a
blotch of ink smeared over with little white spots. These
are supposed to be stars, and one larger than the others
is intended to represent the comet of 1882. The poem
is modestly entitled ” Lines written on first seeing the
Comet,” and is the work of a bard who with far-seeing
bashf ulness prefers to be known by the initials ” H J.C.”
It begins with the splendid assertive burst ” ’Tis Dawn.”
The bard draws breath here for a moment, and then
launches out the awfal query “What is yon streak
across the horizon’s edge?” As the immensities to
which he pieftrs to address himself teem to indicate
by their sites oe that they would rather be asked some-
thing easy, he doesn't wait for a reply, bnt knocks the
stuffing out of the “ streak ’’ with this sublime apos-
trophe—
11 Stranger I
Art thou a herald of some dire portent.
Or oomest thou with tidings glad,
Graciously to greet this staff of onrs ?
Wherefore comest—whither goest thou ? ”
As this noble poem first appeared in the D.T., it might
be imagined that we would suggest the gifted author
had “ got ’em again,’’ and was apostrophizing the comet
in the mad belief that it was a new subscriber for tha
Sheodd, but any person who would think so is but
little acquainted with the magnanimity of our nature.
No, we consider the production to be the herald of a
new school o f poetry, combining the lyrical larksinging
of a Shelley with the ecstatic raptures of a Novalis.
Oh, yes; and there is a refinement of thought about it
whioh is only obtained by the constant concentration of
the mind on the speculation as to which time is best te
go into the bar to catch the first instalment of the
corned beef and onion dole. Farther on, the bard evi-
dently loses his head—found since and discovered to be a
won of ordinary Shroud staff typo—and rashly indites
the comet to “ stay with us, stay.” Who knows what
might have happened if “The Intelligent Vagrant’’
had not rushed out of the backyard, where he had been
lying with a wet stone on his abdomen, trying to gene-
rate humour, and broke the spell f The comet, looking
at his frowzy head and rheumy eye, seemed to have
concluded that it would keep clear aa long as it could,
and so slid with almost ungraceful abruptness, leaving
the *• Vagrant” and the bard on the kerbstone alone in
the gray and saveloyless morning. By the way, this
pamphlet is published at a shilling, “ the proceeds to
be applied as an addition to the Kendall Fund." As
the paper on which it is printed is of rather a superior
kind, we reckon that it ought to fetch at least twopence
s pound at any respectable butcher’s. We congratulate
the trustees of the Kendall Fund ©n the prospective
one and fourpence to na added to their present total of
subscriptions. But what would the dead poet himself
think of this degradation ? Poor Henry may be riding
on the comet, and if ever the “ Stranger, herald of some
dire portent," dois run into this earth, the very first
crowd grilled by it will be the Shroud staff.
TEMORA.
Temora Bailey loud does shriek—
” The Stab but comes out once a week,
While still in is my mozzle;
On two days weekly I appear.
So now I need no longer fear
The Wizzle Wozzle.”
What warlike Wehr, though, does express.
We know not up to going to press ;
It’s surely something, we opine.
That’s in the extra classic line.

A nasty coffin the last time.

Who’s known to ns and you 5
He tootles on the cornet, and
His name is Joseph Drew.

Had sworn to e’er be true.
When Jessie came, and straightway she
From Adelaide Joseph drew.
It came to pass that later on
A. met them in a stroll.
Then kicking him she cried, “Ton said
I’d music in my sole!”
“ Come on I” she to her rival cried ;
Come, Jess, to fight, my dear.’’
“ No—ere you hit me in the chest,
I’m chest agoin’ to clear.”
“We were but going to church,” cried Joe,
“ Oh, please don’t with me grapple ”
“ Oh, church, indeed,” cried Adelaide;
“ Well, she shan’t have my chap all/”
Next day a summons Joe took out
(That law 'tis an infection!)
And though he liked free-trade in love.
He begged to have “ protection.”
The magistrate said—” Bah, pooh, pooh 1”
Directly Joe had sworn it;
And he’s been striving ever since
To creep inside his cornet.

Bather than never speak of you at all.
You’d have us say some little evil of you—

And ne'er forgive who dares not covet yon.
You’re made of tongue, as fox is made of tail.
And those who speak well of you always, know
You not enough; but those whose always ill
Koport yon, they do know you not at all.
’Tis only what you know not you conceal;
Tour conversation is like packing straw—
'Tis nothing, but, without it, broken all.
Friendship ’tween two of you is but a plot
Against another woman that you hate.
Too much in general yon distrust men.
But not as you should in particular.
And ask of those yen know " Is he discreet ? ”
As men of yon ask " Is she beautiful ? ”

And ne’er more bitterly you weep than when
By spite your tearful short-lived grief is caused.

Murdoch's gentle breast;
We can cheer against the loudest at a gallant
triumph gained,
But our theme is manlier conquest, struck for well,
and well attained.
Year! to us who steel to steel with Fraud and
Superstition stand,
Fronting golden-mailed Apollyons, David-fhrce or
Davies-bland,
Rooting from this new land’s heart the poison-
growth of Old World weeds,
Bashing in with Reason’s fist the mummy face of
Christless creeds.
Us, who saw Gomorrah orgies whirling on and
whelming in.
Youth and maid to one mad Maelstrom-ring of
drunkenness and sin,
And unshrinking from all consequence spoke
words that then and there
Plucked from Vice’s gorgoa visage all the veils
and left it bare —
Us, who, seeing legs and raffles worked to build a
shrine to God,
Flagellated portly prelates with Satire’s afflicting
rod,
Whipping each full-blooded Father, by his mam-
mon-heart enticed
To take up his cross and follow (in a brougham)
Jesus Christ—
Gasping for one breath of truth when all the air
was clogged with bosh,
Seeking for the stainless white ’mid peacock dyes
that will not wash,
Seeing clearly, speaking sternly, when the rest
were blind and dumb,
Plucking off the samite robes of the Mokannaa of
The Rum—
Us, who never blenched or faltered, but in Saxon
said our say,
When the Press was wildly toiling at deodorising
Day—
Us, who having for our toilworn statesmen some-
thing of a care,
Made John Lucas see the benefits derived from
change ©f air—
Us, who saw a lithe Uriah, oleaginous with grace,
Writhing up, while Worth stood hungry, to the
pride of power and place ;
Saw the land grow thin and hopeless while the
hypocrites waxed fat,
And collecting for the people, passed the Coonan-
bara Hat —
Us, who saw a senate’s vultures wheeling o’er the
bleeding frame
Of a slowly dying country, while no voice was
raised to blame,
And whose clarion cry of warning startled many a
whetted beak
Which was hovering above some unaccomplished
Milburn Creek—
Us, who saw a people tired with anti-Babylonian
groans,
Prom the merciless expounders of the Valley of
Dry Bones,
And demanding something higher, wrought to
lift the mind and heart,
Till Religion became nobler in the Gallery of
Art—
Us, who fought a nostriled Corcoran—an anti-
Roman Pope,
Till we saw him crushed and cursing at the limit
of his rope—
Thou hast borne a wage surpassing all we dared
in hopes and prayers,
Showing all Corruption’s horde they are not ours —
wo are not theirs —
Showing that no outworn ritual—no mechanism
of Gain—
Round the vital heart of Freedom can retwist its
rusted chain;
Showing that no blaze of office, nought of pretext
or display,
Can put back the clock for ever, or avert the
judgment-day.

Told the planetary ether that the Great KIAM

heard that ohorio yell.

Shylock was a harmless, benevolent old gentle-
man compared to a financier-down South, who bids fair
to soon be a member of Parliament and a C.M.G. This
is the actual form of promissory note which a hard-
pushed selector on the Murray was persuaded by this
murderous-minded land-shark to sign the other day:
“ Within one year from date, for value received, 1
promise to pay (say Mr. Smith) £75 on demand, and in
case that amount be not paid by the of next,
1883, I agree that anything and everything in my pos-
session shall be levied npon and sold, including clothes,
school-books, and food of the children) and in case
after that everything is sold, there remain anything due
on this note, I further agree that the services of myself
and my family shall be sold to (Mr. Smith) until the
demands of this note are satisfied." Whether anoh a
note could be legally used, we do not know. Whether
Mr. " Smith " intends to push it to its extremity, wo
do not know. Bnt it is certainly gennine in that it is
held in terrorem over the selector who signed it, and
who believed it at the time to be legally enforoable.
The dates and the true ameunt we de not give. And,
we need scarcely add, that Sir James’s masterly inter-
pretation of “ the journalist’s duty to the public Act ’*
precludes our even hinting at the name of the land,

A prominent Good Templar of New Plymouth,
N Z., incautiously went to sleep in the Public Institute
the other day. A malicious wag, thinking this a good
opportunity for a practical joke, placed a bottle of
schnapps and a glass in front of the unconscious
sleepar A large number ef people visited the Insti-
tute, and the spent,aole’there presented excited much
scandal among the virtuous. The sleeper doesn’t
know whether to take an action for insulting behaviour
or for libel.
Thus a home paper: — “ Sub-Inspector Stritoh,
of the Irish Constabulary, having been found guilty of
non-attendance at any plaos of worship for seven
months, and of being invariably in bod until midday,
and not available for official duty, has been reduced ten
degrees, and removed to another district. The latter
charge I can comprehend, though according to Mr,
Joynes it, would be bettor for Ireland if her policemen
spent all their time in bed ; but I did not know that
regular church-going was included, even by Mr. Jnstice
Hawkins, among the essential duties of the force.
Perhaps, however, it may bo necessary that Irish
pMioetnen, being the vio'ims of so many accusations,
should, at any rate, be free from a suspicion of
impiety."
Second in pathos to the fact that such a paper
as the D.T. exists at all is the fact that it should even
attempt to deal with such a foreign subject as educa-
tion. Yet it does—it dismally does. Last week it had
an article about the Public Instruction Act, in which
it stated that the University return "does not givetho
total number of candidates from each school, nor does
it mention the ages of the scholars, whioh we know
vary almost from 14 to 40 ” The confidence with whioh
this apparently absurd assertion is made would incline
us to believe that, the scholars whoso ages range up to
the second period are in the D T. office were it not for
t-be absence of anything in its columns approaching a
suggestion of even rudimentary knowledge.
The sailors of the “ Diamond ” have started a
Good Templar Lodge, and we read that the initiation
of the candidates was performed in a most impressive
manner. We expect that it was the gentleman who is
advertised as having been restored to health by a patent
medicine made near Adelaide that wrote this. From
the use of the word " impressive,” though, in connec-
tion with ceremony, we are inclined to think his stock
has run out, and that salts doesn’t agree with him.
There ienothing " impressive" about GoodTemplarism
except the ghostlike and stealthy way in whioh the
novice, after he has been " made,” creeps round to a
pub. where he is not known, and gargles down a rum

This is a Scotch paragraph. Therefore, we’ve
carefully left ont all attempts at jokes. Well, the
Arabs were greatly puzzled by the dress of the High-
landers in Egypt; and as their faces were veiled
(against insects), and they displayed bare legs, the
innocent Bedouins concluded that the gallant Cale-
donians were women. They also noticed that the
"women” camped by themselves, and they fancied
they’d got on a soft thing, and determined to capture
the whole barem It was a brilliant idea, and they
thought they’d be-douin quite a stroke. Bo they bore
down, fall of amorous ideas; but when the “ women "
opened a volley that rubbed out about forty of them,
the Arabs found thav’rt been hallucinated. They
didn’t go on any more harem soar’em expeditions.
As little truths keep coming' out, we begin to
see that there was some funny soldiering in
Egypt. At the first of Kassassin, the Household
Cavalry—it. ’-eing dark—didn’t verv clearly know what
thev were doing. After charging through the enemy
and back again, they seem to have got a little mixed
up At any rate, when it was all over, onr gallant
cavalry were found to have received a good many
sword outs, and—ffie enemy had no swords. Having thus
sabred their opponents—and themselves—they rode
back exultingly to the British lines and then —it being
still dark—they were very nearly killed by their
friends. A regiment had actually deployed on purpose
to fire, and was on the point of doing so, when the
mistake was found out. Glory ! glory 11
The Campbelltown Herald, under the new
editor, is to band. That gentleman is decidedly original.
While admitting in his trader that he is “a trifle too
democratic,” he says : “ Wo once Anew two doge—a
retriever and a greyhound—that would go Out every
night and kill a two-yesr-old calf; and there is no
gammon (!) about the size and strength of a station
beast at that age.” And there is no gammon, either,
about this being undoubtedly a pleasing departure from
the stylo of the stereotyped " editorial." There is a
omiae-Christmassy tone abont it that possesses a
peculiar fa°oination for the literary student. It is a
matter of regret, however, to us that the editor speaks
of the dogs he onoe knew in the past tense. It would
be a pity if they were dead. It would have come in
hr.ndy for them to write a "leader” turn about with
the editor, so as to give him time to worry the sub-
scribers and get those nice little items about the Court-
house clock and the saveloy supper to our esteemed
townsman. We would offer him the loan of our dingo
with pleasure, only we hear that there is a man in
Camden who has a male.
Two brothers who had not seen each other for
over twenty years, met accidentally in Ballarat the
other night. The natural thing, of course, under such
circumstances, is to go and have a drink. Blood is
thicker than water, but beer is better than both. So
they went and drank, and one drink being natural, it
follows that two are twice as natural, and so on. This
is a simple matter of logic. The end was that the
brethren became enpernaturally drunk, and lay down
side by side, like S ,nl and Jonathan, in the gutter.
Hera the police found them, and carted them off to the
lock-up Next morning when they were brought into
Court, the magistrates, "taking all the circumstances
of the case into consideration, discharged them ” We
should think so. If drunkenness isn’t justifiable in
such a case, we don’t know where it is.

Newcastle is a nice place—a nice place to die
in. A lady mat with a fatal accident up there, the
other day, and her body was laid out in the dead-
house. When the bereaved husband with the coroner
and twelve jurymen came at the appointed hour to
view the body, the dead-house door was locked, and no
person on the premises knew where the key was. After
waiting a while, the deputation prew tired and then
tried to force the lock with an axe. As this didn’t
succeed, three of the strongest pnt their backs against
the door and kicked it in with their heels so forcibly
that it very nearly knocked over the corpse. The
question now is—where was that key? But a light
breaks upon ns. Lha Shroud representative must
have been up in Newcastle, and the dead-house keeper,
hearing of his arrival, must have looked the door and
hidden the key to prevent him from worrying the
corpses for subscriptions.
The amenities of life are nowhere so well under-
stood as at a place called Buckley’s, in Monaro. A mm
dating from there writes to a Cooma paper gently de-
precating the literary style and personal virtues of its
correspondent. After starting with the decisive, if
somewhat tautological, affirmation that the correspon-
dent was a “ vilifying libeller," this bush Juvenal goes
on to say:—"When he attempts to drag in the mad the
fair name and reputation of the good folk of Dalgetty,
and leaves the slime of his vituperation—as dees the
loathsome snail that crawls the chamber at night—on
the coat tails of honest men; when he attempts to daub
his blotch-brand of infamy—an imitation of the cattle
thief—over the name of good and true residents; when
this aspen-tongued churl endeavours to sting his fellow,
beings with his poisoned fangs, or, assassin-like, makes
a stab in the dark; then it is time for the lash to be
laid on hot and sweet." Now, this is what wo call
steep writing. If this man isn’t a bullock-puncher, he
must write auti-Popish articles for the Protestant
Standard. Such a command of vituperative epithet
could be obtained in no other way.
Cardinal Manning stated recently that the
soldiers in the army commauded by Sir Garnet Wolsoley
in the late Egyptian expedition were the first who ever
carried tea in their bottles to assault an intrenched
camp. His Eminence infers from this and the result of
the expedition that men fight better on tea than on any
other tipple. Of course they get mad on it—mad that
they can’t get anything bettor to drink. Besides, they
might have wanted to tantalize their thirsty enemies.
By a parity of reasoning. If we had a quarrel with the
8 hbodd people—which we couldn't, because we never
fight with the dead—we sh' aid storm their office with
exp oeive saveloys. We would choose saveloys, because
we reckon that none of them wonld miss fire. We
aren’t a bit proud of our Egyptian victory. On one side
were men who, whether they oa'ried tea in their bottles
or not, had at home lived on the reast beef and plum
pudding and beer of old England. Buoh men “ trinm-
phjd" over and slaughtered a horde of Jew-racked
wretches who had all their lives existed on sherbet and
water-melons. Bah to yonr victories I what
the Morning Rum calls "thinly-veiled treason.” Bat
it's true, nevertheless.
The boss astronomer of the colony is np at
Sprirg Ridge. He has furnished the Mubbubundi
Times with the result of his observations. His first
information is that "our celestial visitor is altering its
position,” which will be staitling news to the world at
large. Then he tells how the comet passed perihelion :
“It was a close shave, as the comet went within a
couple of thousand miles of the great luminary. If onr
erratic visitor had collided with the bright orb of day,
it is awfnl to contemplate what might have been.”
Yes, dear boy; and it’s awful to contemplate the para-
bolic carve of yonr ears, and the point of aphelion of
the same. The genius of Spring Ridge next proceeds:
“ The comet is now ‘ broadside on,’ so we have a better
view of its immense proportions. The nucleus or head
is decreasing in brilliancy, bat the tail ie lengthening in
proportion. It rises later every morning." We like to
admire true genius. Very few astronomers could put
their giant thoughts into such simple language as the
above. Any child could swallow that paragraph. We
must secure this philosopher, at all cost.

Aud why ? You see onr office " Jim ”
Wants you to " sweep his chimley."
Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. The fun-
niest reading we have bad for a 1-mg while is in the
ao cunts given by the English papers of how a young
patrician the otVer night harangued a policeman from
the top of a lam'.post, and read to that puzzled official
entrants from the instruction-book recently issued by
Mr. Howard Viromt, Director of Criminal Investiga-
tion*, oa ‘ the Duties of the Force." Lord Screens-
field once wrote, that the ** country would be sived by
its youth," and every day that passes proves that Lord
Beaconsfield's prophecies have a way of coming true.
In this particular instance much would evidently de-
pend on the youths themselves, their habits, and their
stadias. Cavendish on Whist, Boil’s Guide to the Tnrf,
and a pocket dictionary, once formed the library of an
average young man of the period. All this is changed.
Two yonng gentlemen, Mr. M. Sandys and Mr. Charles
Browne, were called npoa to explain certain conduct of
theirs which had been unfavourably regarded by Con-
stable 63 C. These yonng men, it appears, had, on
leaving their club, observed a policeman evidently in
want of distraction. Him Mr. Sandys invited to waltz.
The policeman was cross, and didn’t want to waltz ;
but iusteal of saying that he was engaged for the next
dance, or hinting at an ice, be proceeded to argue.
From that moment he was doomed. Mr. Sandys seized
the occasion, climbed the lamp-post, hung on to the
cross-pies*, palled a book out of his pocket with a red
civer entit'ed the "Police Code," and addressed the
ideal functionary as follows :—“ Bobby ! You have been
calking to people in the street; hear what your goveraor
says on page 78 of jour Bible:— 1 There is no practice
more pernicious to the police service than gossiping to
strasgers. The police on duty should net gossip.’ I
agree with your governor, Bab by. Ho knows what he,
is about, wench is more than you do. You have bean
gossiping with me, and you shouldn’t lave done it.
That is not all; you have lost your temper, and by
doing bo you have been guilty of contempt of Court,
for Mr. Justice Hawkins, in a preface to the Cede, says,
* Whatever duty yon may be called upon to perform,
keep a curb on your temper.’ Have yon kept a curb on
your temper ? You have not —not even a snaffle. The
duty you were invited to perform was to waltx with
me, instead of which you swore. Now Mr. Justiee
Hawkins ” “ 'Grains b» blowod ! ’’ here broke in
the constable; “you come along with me." Mr.
Sandys, still reading from the Code, did go along with
the policeman, and the interview with Mr. Newt m was
the result. Of c urse the case was discharged, and Mr.
Newton took the opportunity of observing that it was
a hopeful sign of the times that young gentlemen
really knew mere of the Police Code than the police
themselves. He complimented the accnsed on the
nature of their studies, and suggest 3d that just a little
less disposition to waltz—at any rate until the police
become better instructed as to their duties—might per-
haps be desirable.

AN AUSTRALLAN STORY.
CA[?] I. (Continued.)
CXLIII.
Sslina, thinking that the Resurrection
justbrokejloose, rushed wildly from her room-
And tearing off in search of male protection, ’
Met the strong barman (who was also groom),
Who came, with many a wicked interjection.
Armed with a shove and a stable broom.
And she—forgetting she wore but her " shimmy"—
Started for Susan's door, along with Jimmy.
CXLIV.
As they passed back, upon the kitchen floor they
Saw Mary lying stretched in deathlike trance.
And sought to rouse her, but it seemed the more
they
Strove to do this, the smaller seemed their chance
To get her round ; so, quickly giving o’er, they
In Indian file commenced to re-advanoe
Along the passage to where Susan’s room was—
Selina was behind, and in the van the groom was.
CXLV.
When Susan screamed, the shearer had upstarted
And glared around as
The o lour from his face had quite departed.
And all his mien was that of one who tries
In some sad morning tick and heavy-hearted
To bi iog to mind eventualities,
Which brought him to an unwished consummation—
To wit, apartments at the police sta'ioH.
CXLVI.
This she observed as, moved with frantic terror.
She pulled the knob from off the fast locked dcor.
And understood at onoe that all was error—
She’d seen men make mistakes through drink
before,
And thought at once, “ Be careful, Susan, there are
Some chances yet to tide this scandal o’er,"
And so with her cheeks’ redness highly heiehtemd,
And quivering heart all tremulous and frightened,
CXLVII.
She oped the door enough to got her head ont,
And said, “ O Lena I I’ve had such a fright—
I dreamed that from beneath this very bed out
There crept a snake —I almost felt it bite—
But there—get dressed and help the girl to spread
-out
The breakfast—don’t you look a pretty sight ?
With but yonr nightdress on before a Man—you
Bold, brazen bnssey, 30a, however can yon?"
CXLVIII.
Selina fled, thus sharply reprimanded.
And Jimmy very sulkily withdrew;
Then Susan locked the door —she just bad planned it,
The very course she purposed to pursue
•' So, Henry Nelson, I must go forth branded
To life-long misery, and all throng . yon—
You drunken, sneaking, mean, degraded sot, yon,
Your Jenny Masons must be proud they’ve got yon.’
CXLIX.
“What brought you here? You shameless wretch,
how dare yon ,
Come near this house when everybody knows
You court that Mason girl ? I’d like to tear you.
You horrid monster 1 Did yon onoe suppose
I’d have you if yon asked ? You needn’t stare, yen
Low beast ([ wish I could get on mv clothes)
Throw me that drees beside you—can’t yon hear m« ?
There—that one. Now then, don’t you dare loos
near me.
CL.
*• Oh I don’t I wish that I had ne’er been bor-', or
Had died in teething, anything but this —
To live and feel a honest people's scorn, or
Be pointed ont by every stuck-up Miss-
Give me that shawl that's hanging in the corner.
Don’t look this way—Yes, Death would be a bliss,
Compared to what I’ll innocently suffer.
And ail through you, you miserable naffer.
ELI.
“ (Throw me that hair—you needn’t try to hand it—
1T1 scream for help if you attempt to stir);
Bat don't you think a moment that I’ll stand it.
I’ll see your Mason girl and tell to her
This tale, and she can see at once you planned it.
And soon will bnnt yon like a frightened cur.
(If you but move to reach your coat or hat, you
Bad wretch, I swear I’ll throw the hair-brush at
you )
cm.
11 How did you get in here ? Oh ! if I’d known you
Were in my room, 1 would have paid you out;
The shearers would have tied you up and thrown you
In Bailey’s dam—(and I’d have had to shout),
I like your Mason’s taste 1 I wouldn’t own you.
You greasy, tumbled, wretched-looking lout.
And now I m going to take out every garment
Of yours, and look you in, you low-lived varmint.
, CLIII.
“ And then I’ll go up straight to Mr. Mason,
And bring him here and show him what you’ve
done;
I know he’ll put a very pleasant face on
When I have introduced his future son.
(T wo boots, one trousers, with one bush-made brace
on)—
There now, I’ve got year clothes and yon are done,
I’ll station Jimmy at the door, you brnte, you,
And tell him if you break it down to shoot you I"
CL1V.
My hero, as you’ve seen before, was soft—he
Could not withstand the subtle female charm;
Bis moral standard was not coldly lofty,
Nor yet too low— not quite too chill or warm—
He’d rent no hearts as yet, though very oft he
Had kissed a tempting mouth, and meant no barm.
He was a partisan of playful larking.
But quite a stranger to the role of Tarquin.
CLV.
So when he saw that this was all his doing,
A keen compnnotion stung his honest breast,
How could he shield this pretty girl from ruin.
What could he do—ho wished to do the best.
He saw that something desperate was brewing,
And screwed his courage up and thus addressed
The furious-spoken and indignant maiden.
Who stood there with his Sunday raiment laden:
CLVI.
** I’m very sorry for it all. Miss Lacey,
I never was so sorry in nsy life,
I can’t abear to look you in the fooe, I
Feel so ashamed; but if you’ll be my wife
- I’ll marry you before I leave the place. I
Think that the wisest way to end this strife—
The block I’ve pegged out on old Foley’s ran, I
Can sell him back and get a little money.

stay’s Herald, exposes the absurdity of the whole
I usiness very trenchantly, and shows with logical con-
lusiveness that no real reform can be expected without
° ri( jj ca i change in the management of the institution :
because, under existing conditions, the Hospital physi-
c-ians cannot but fall foul of police, repotters, and
blic • the Board cannot but make unsuitable appoint-
! aents ; the appointment of a resident Medical Super,
intendent cannot be expected (although formally
r t commended by the Baard); lady nurses of a superior
class cannot be got to accept positions in the Hospital;
■iud poli ical influences cannot be expelled from the
conduct of affairs Everyone should read the reasoning
bv which “Nous Verrons” supports these allegations.
The difficulty in dealing with the Board is that stopping
subscriptions seems the only way of getting rid of
them, and by such an expedient the patients would
suffer first and most severely.
-♦
Xx would be interesting to learn by tirtua of what
authority Mr. 'James Watson, the Parliamentary repre-
sentative for Noplace Nowhere, and, in that respect, a
sorb of political Alfred Jingle, ordered the discon-
tinuance cf wharfage rates at Wollongong. It would
likewise be of interest to learn upon what principle Mr.
James Watson appointed to a place in the Colonial
Stores, at a salary of £200 per i mum, a Mr. Wilkin*
son, whose predecessor had been drawing only £180 per
annum. Mr. Watson might with advantage (to the
public, not to himself) explain how it happened that
this protege only made his appearance at the scene of
his labours after Mr. Watson had ceased to represent
any constituency in Parliament. He might also state
explicitly whether the appointment of the clerk in
question, bearing date the 22udNov. —that is to say.
prior to Mr. Watson’s dismissal by his constituents—
was not actually made subsequent to that dismissal’
and ante-dated. While Mr. Watson s hand is in, he
might extend his explanations by stating how it came
to pass that, while he was Treasurer, every vacancy
that occurred in the Colonial Stores was filled by a
pro teg of Mr. Watson’s from his late electorate. Does
the Young district produce a special breed of men
peculiarly fitted to ft 1 billets in the Colonial Stores P
Otherwise, how came it that Mr. Hopkins, of the firm
of Hopkins and Co , the only business rivals of
Messrs. Watson Brothers In that place, was appointed
Superintendent of Stores at a salary of £500 per annum,
whereas the officer he succeeded only received £400 per
annum? Likewise, how it was that Mr. Harper,
another of Mr. Watson’s Young men, was appointed
accountant in the same office over the heads of officers
a 1 ready in the service and of long standing. Mr«
Watson is not generally considered an able
man. Here is a chance to show that he is, at
any rate, able to explain these singular circumstances.
+
Perhaps Fir Henry Parkes could also find it conve-
nient to offer a few explanations. He might state, for
instance, bj whose authority seventy printers in
the Government Printing Office were forced to accept
a holiday on the morning of the East Sydney election,
and bjr whose authority—these men having almost to a
man preferred work—they were refused recompense.
He might further elucidate whether the employes of
other departments were or were not granted, without
any request being made, a holiday at the several elec,
tions, and afterwards paid for their services.
he might enlighten the public as to whether a certain
officer of the Colonial Treasurer’s department was
granted leave of absence to canvass the Young elec-
torate for Mr. Watson, and whether this officer is the
same about whose conduct a similar complaint was
made at the time of the last general cleat ion. And,
finally, he might afford information as to the employ,
ment of a special train to convey to Faulconbridge a
newly-arrived schoolmistress, whose services he had
engaged, while in England, for the public service.
Whispers that the formation of aThirdPirty is al-
ready in contemplation have been current during the
past week. The lines upon which the Third Party is
to be constructed, are, according to rumour, the pre-
servation of Eing interests. Sir Henry Parkes is to
discover that he has been victimised by Sir John
Bobertson. His grand loyalty to his associates and
personal connections, so long celebrated, impelled him
to sacrifice himself to a sense of fidelity to his col-
league by accepting the Land Bill of the latter, repug-
nant as that system has ever been to his convictions
and his principles. But now that the sacrifice has been
made, and made in vain, he will be himself again,
resume the virginity of his principles, and, throwing
Sir John over, compete with Mr Stuart for the honour
of framing a complete code of reformed Land law
directly antagonistic to that which his late Cabinet
had endeavoured to give effect to. Such is the drift of
the rumour. Sir John is to be thrown overboard, and
the principles of the majority are to he resumed hy
Sir Henry. The story is probably suited for the
marines : but its currency serves to indicate the esti-
mation in which Sir Henry Parkes is held as a politi-
cian of dignified and consistent principle. _____
The third concert of a series by well-known
Sydney artists took place at the Masonic Hall on Satur-
day evening. Mr. S. Hodge gave capital performances
on the clarionet and saxophone,
plause Miss Lydia Hastings recited The Creed of
Bella,'* excelling, if anything, her previous eSorts,
showing a range and cultivation of voice qnite phei o-
menal. Her clear articulation and enunciation, and the
entire absence of mouthing (which m »K h t well be
copied), brought a prolonged encore; and a response
from her of Mark Twain’s humorous sketch, s&oaga-
ing It," was loudly applauded In the second part she
recited "Uncle Reuben’s Baptism, * an amusing and
vivid representation of one . base of Negro character,
this was also loudly encored. Mr. F Uall 8 well was
encored for his rendering Benedicts " Ka?^.^ h °“
Ktorm,” and Sullivan's " I would I were a King. Miss
Kate Thayer sang, in artistic style, a selection from
Verdi’s “I Lombardi”; and, in response to an en-
core. “The Old Folks at Home.” which was qnite
successful. And other items in the programme
were equally well rendered. Miss Verona Hil-
mano sang well “The Kerry Dance ’
Fred Le ton, two comic so-ga. with good tnect.
Mr W. E. Chapman gave “Poor Littie doe, tne
audience receiving him with slaps. Mr. cnar os
Huenerbein presided at the piano in his W
style. The fourth of the series was given on Monday
night by the same artists Miss Lydia Hastingsi re-
cited Browning’s “Hervc Biel,” which gave the giftid
elocutionist an opportunity to show some of ner are-
matic fire, and every point was well taken advantage oi ,
an encore was responded to in the amusing
sale of “ Forty Old Bachelers,” giving another evidence
of her marked ability to step from grave to gay . in
the second part, she gave a most successful rendition
of “L ve in a Balloon,” and received a hearty encore.
Miss Kite Thayer’s rendering of the “Swiss Kabo,
was very artistic; securing an encore. she sang ' Robin
Adair;” and an encore to “A Dream,” by Bobjn, was
answered by “Coming through the Bye Mr. Mai-
Jewell went ** Down Among tko Dead IVIqh in an
effective .» anner, the audience applauding; and The
Fine Old English Gentleman ’’was brought out by an
encore from “ Soots wba haa.” M ss ualmane and Mr.
Letton rendered good service. Mr Chapman told
“The Blacksmith’s Story" very well ; and read’ Oyer
the Hill to the Poorhouse.” and “Oyer the Hill from
the Poorhouse,” though the road was rather too long.
Altogether, the concert was very successful.

Lately, in Wales, a waiter pretending to swallow
a spoon, actually did so. Special instruments were
made, and, by an operation lasting forty-five minutes,
performed under chloroform, the spoon was extr ojed.
It measured inches long Jerry Cox, as Ameiican
nigger, who was under sentence of death in Nashville
gaol for killing his mistress, set tire to his cell. Ab ut
midnight people were awakened by the roar of the
flames, and many hasten'd to the gaol, but on their
arrival they found the walls and bars glowing red with
heat, while) the murderer within was screaming in his
death agony. In less than an hour the gaol was a mass
of ruins A mob of lynchers in America took Andrew
Elliott out ef gaol to lynch him. With the rope round
his neck, he suggested that he haln’t teen so bad as
they seemed to imagine, and that hanging was rather
severe, and a coat of tar and feathers would be a fair
thing. His Tom Garrett style of eloquence was so
persuasive that be escaped the hanging, a»d was treated

Mr. Morrison (son of the Principal of Geelong

Daring a year’s holiday, he toured New South Wales,
went from Maokay (Q ) to the South'Seas, on to New
Guinea, and then to China. He proposes to travel
thenae to Borneo, and back to N. Queensland, finally to
make a journey on foot from Normanton right through
to Melbourne, Bravo, bold athlete!
Cambridge University has acquired a magni-
ficent distance runner in W. D Latouche, Pembroke,
at a time when the going down of their old champion
and president. Hough, makes such a prize of especial
value A freshman who oau make his own running,
and yet accomplish 4 31, as Latoucbo did at his college
sports, promises to develop into something superior to
anything that has hitherto been seen at either Univer-
sity.
Fifteen hundred head to seven guns is slanght er
indeed. This scene of blood was enacted on Mr. C. J.
H. Tower’s Essex preserves at South Weald Park.
The party, which consisted of Lord Waldegrave, Lord
St. John, Sir Robert Harvev, Mr. Wynne, Mr. Gill,
Mr. Brownlow Tower, and Mr. Egerton Tower, killed
417 pheasants, 1081 rabbits, and four hares. What a
saving of cartridges could have been effected by knock-
ing them on the head with sticks !
Parramatta races last Saturday afternoon ; poor
attendance. Trial Stakes—Wallangra 1, Albert Victor
2, Hilltop 3. Won by a head. Sailing Stakes—Boni-
face 1, Cadet 2, Chance 3. Won by a neck. Shorts

Tout Cela” gives the following interesting
memoranda respecting the 26 Champion races run
throughout the colonies. The owners who have won

James Wilson, three times ; and Messrs. Keighran and
W. Field, each twice. The only horses wno have been
twice successful are Zoe, Strop, and First King, The
jockeys who have the highest record are Hales 4, Ath-
worth 3, and Simpson, Carter, Davis, and Murphy 2
each.
The race, in outriggers, for .£50 a side, between
H. Pearce and J. Largan, was rowed over the champion
course, Parramatta River, on Saturday afternoon. The
men got away to a good start, and rowed passed Uhr’s
Point together, Tearce evidently waiting an the
Englishman. At Qladesville, Largan was completely
played out, and stoppad pulling, allowing Pearce to
anish the course alone. This is the first time Pearce
has bean in anything like condition since he returned
from England. He rowed about 12st. 5’.b.
What the’sedate foreigner thinks of the sporting
proclivities of middle-aged Englishmen, and their addic-
tion to youthful pastimes, is no secret; but he would
probably consider the climax as being reached were he
informed of the fact that, of eight men who took part
in the most recent paper chase of the oldest of the clubs
of that ilk, the Thames Hare and Hounds, the average
ages were thirty-three years, atill this is quite over-
tapped by the veterans’ handicap at the Civil Service
uotiletic meeting, the winner ot which told fitty-six years
nnd the fourth man seventy.two 1
The worst fears about Captain Webb are being
realised—he is sinking into a regular music-hall swim-
ming artiste. His latest feat has been to remain

At the Canadian Athletic Championship meeting
some consciwcaless wag introduced Mr. Q. M. L Sachs,
the genial First Lieutenant of the Manhattan Athletic
Club, as W. G. George, the English champion. Mr.
S&ohs-Gsorge was the recipient of much courteous
attention, was filled with good wine, and made the
blushing listener of several hundred complimentary
remarks, many of which asserted that “anybody could
sae he is a great runcer by the shape of his legs, and the
way he carries himself." During the afternoon and
evening Mr. faohs-Qeorga was forced to answer a
thousand questions about English persons and places,
and his own athletic career j and it is to be hoped that
the many falsehoods ho told may not be charged against
him at the Judgment Day.
An eye-witness, who was present at the Bane-
lagh Clnb to test the advantages ot the Ligowsky flying
clay pigeons, and who witnessed some shooting at
them, says they are, no doubt, a marvellous invention,
and likely to try the very best shwts very highly. The
pigeon is made ot thin baked olay, in chape like a deep
saucer. It is fixed into a kind of catapult or trap,
which can be regulated to send the pigeon in any
direction; so that out of five traps no two are adjusted
to send the bird in the same line. The traps are palled
in the same way pigeon traps were pnlled in old days,
and great skill is required to hit the mark pigeon or clay
dish (call it as yon like). It hit, the pigeon breaks to
pieces, so there can be no doubt as to a hit or miss.
'Phis invention will go a long way to supersede the live
bird, as it is much cheaper in all ways, and can be avail-
able at any moment for the amusement of a country-
house party or club, and affords just as good sport as
the live bird.
The old-time trotter, Cooley, died in October
last at Chicago, U.S., but his name will live in American
tnrf history, not so much because of his performances
as of his connection with the tragedy in 1866, in which
William M'Eeever lost his life. The race in which it
occurred was run at Dexter Park, Chicago, between
General Butler and Cooley. The 'attar, a local favourite,
was freely backed. Butler was brought over from New
York under M'Keever's care, who, not being satisfied
with the way in which he was driven in the first two
heats won by Cooley in very poor time, determined to
go behind the horse himself. He won the third and
fourth heats easily. When the fifth heat started it was
dark, the only light beisg from a moon just risen.
General Butler took the lead at once, and at iho back of
the course the horses disappeared behind a large shed.
Nothing more was seen of them till General Butler
dashed down the homestretch and finished in
without a driver. A rush was made for the back of the
course, where poor M'Keever was found, with his skull
split in twain, beside a piece of the guard-rail of the
fenco. which some ruffians had evidently held out for
the ill-fated driver to dash his head against. All bats
were declared off.
The performances of our footballers look very
small beside those of the Freshmen and Sophomores of
Columbia College, N.Y., U.8. At their annual cane-
rush at the New York Athletic Club Grounds, fifty
Fre-hmen and sixty Sophomores stripped off for the
fight—many of them to the bail. Whan the referee
shouted “ rush ’’ th a Freshmen closed around the cane-
holders, and the Sophomores threw themselves against
them. A dozen men fell and were trampled on in the
rush. One fainted, and many retired exhausted. One
young fellow was taken from the struggle as limp as a
rag, and with a livid face and body. Whisky, dashes of
cold water, and brisk rubbing revived him, and he
rushed back to the fight like a mad dog. After the
referee had shouted “time" until he was hoarse, the
straggle continued as fiercely as ever. Sophomores
and Freshmen launched themselves bodily upon each
other, and the wrestling, kicking, scratching, and
throttling were kept up. A doxan youths acting as
policemen, the judges, and the re'ereo finally dragged
the battling classes apart. At the finish the Freshmen
were comparatively “freshmen" compared with the
Sophomores, who seemed to “ suffer more " than their
antagonists.
We went to see the Largan-Pearoe race, and,
till the time Largan gave up, it was the best thing
we have seen on the course for a long time. For a
considerable time you couldn't see Largan’s boat for his
feet, but, getting a glimpse now and then over the tops
of bis shoes, he seemed, to the spectator, to be pulliug
very grandly, indeed. There was a great deal of whan
an elevated party on board called “exciseman"
amongst the spectators, and, when Largan ceased row-
ing, there were a good many curses floating away on
the Summer breezes. There was also considerable
whisky. Either whisky or sculling will produce curses
at any time of groat weight and volume. This, by the
way. Largan attributes his want of stamina to the
relaxing influence ot the climate. Why not ? Trickett
attributed his want of success in England to the cold to
which he was not aconstomed. Both men had good
reason for this, we suppose. Or they had not. Either
will suit us. Or both On Saturday, Largan is to row
Trickett. If he doesn’t show better form than ho did
with Pearce, Edward ought to beat him. We saw
Largan after the race, and he said be was quite rowed
out. Perkins said so also. And we think, really, he
was licked on his merits, that time. But a week may
make a lot of diffarenoe. Wise surmise this—after the
style of Alfred a sporting prophets. Eh bien, nous
verrons.
Such a scene as that which happened in the
“ Birdcage ’’ at Newmarket, previous to the commence-
ment of a reoent day's racing was never before witnessed
on a racecourse. Martini and Narctssa were tele-
graphed as starters for the Subscription Stakes, and
Wood, the jockey, was, in his scarlet jacket and cap,
ready for orders. But he came in for a “wigging"
instead, from the Dowager Duchess of Montrose, who
followed him across the enclosure, ejaculating in a
loud voice. “ How dare you weigh, contrary to my
orders ? Yon knew that wa had decided not to run any
horses to-day I We will not endure suoh abuse as we
have been subjected to in the papers 1” Turning npon
Sherrard, her trainer, who came up at the moment,
the Duchess “read the Biot Act" to him in similar
terms, and, bursting into a paroxysm of tears, fairly
broke down. Leaning forward on the rail which pro-
vides a passage for the jockeys and trainers to the
weighing-room, her Grace cried piteously; whereupon
Sir George Chetwynd came to the rescue, and con-
duoted the Duchess into one of the opsn saddling-
stalls, away from the public gaze. On reoovering
composure, the lady insisted on Martini’s number
being taken down; but, on being informed by one of
the stewards that snob a step would necessitate their
fining Mr. Crawford (her husband) £50, the horse was
allowed to start. His success added fuel to the flame,
as did the subsequent defeat of other Bedford Lodge
favourites that day. When, on Friday, Maoheath was
bowled over by Adriana, the contrast in Mr. Crawfurd’s
and Mr. Houldsworth’s popularity was shown by suoh
a hurricane ot cheering as nrght have been heard at
Befton Lodge, on the other side ot Newmarket, where
the Duchess of Montrose passed that day in retirement
instead of visiting the Heath. The Daohejs’ favouri.e
tipple, by the way, is—soda.

The alps have been crossed by bioyole-riders on their

. Mrs. Stow, a San Francisco drees reformer, has
informed the police that on January 1st she will begin
to wear trousers In public, and she demands protection
in case street crowds insult her. But the chief of
police seems to think it will be his duty to arrest he**
on the ground that her conduct would bo disorderly.
As to the form of the proposed garment, Mrs. Stow
says, " My trousers are made with a plait, and descend
just to the line of beauty in the calf of the log, just
where the dresses of young girls come; and if young
girls wear their dresses there, why should not old girls
adopt the same fashion?’* She is advised by a lawyer
that there is no law under which the can be pr vented
from dressing in that fashion.

Those who liked could get a sufficient luncheon, pro-

banding him the sufficient sum of two and sixpence

t.ho plaids and silts and tunics ware very gav. Con.

'Rand wick saw one of its largest crowds on New
Tear’s Day, the Grand-stand being nearly foil, while
the L igir-st and at.d enclosure ware closely packed, and
au n iusual number of vehicles lined the fence inside
the ’•nuuing.gr mud. All events started punctually s
tho Volunteer Artillery Band played on the lawn; and
His Excellency the Governor, Lady Loftus, and a party
from Government House, as well as many members of
Parliament, were present. Pew novelties in ladies’
attire wore seen, neither was there much richness dis-
played. Of the full-coloured drosses, richest was a
myrtle greon satin, beautifully paaaementeried 1b green
and silver beads to match the dress, and a darker green
bonnet was shaded by white satin parasol. A very
florid costume was rubv plush bodice with gilt buttons,
ruby satin skirt puffed to a marvel and trimmed
with white lace, parasol to match beaded in the
same colour. An olive green of satin and watered
mrird was not far off the ruby. The dross of the day
was a pure white lawn, worn by a married lady, fair and
short of stature, whose cheery face is seldom missing
from a mooting. The dress was set off with wide
bishop sleeves, embroidered flounces, and broohd trim-
ming ; a close-fitting bonnet with ribbons under the chin
completed a costume absolutely devoid of colour, and as
dainty and charming as a summer dress oonld be. Prom
tns belt hung a little betting book, bound in silver
sides with monogram, and silver pencil, all on a massive
silver chain. Another handsome blonde, taller and
fail of figure, wore a beautiful yellow cream cashmere
and satin, sash, lace aud gloves, all en suite A flash
pink satin had its fliunoas edged with ficelle lace,
shaded b? a lace parasol quite smoke-hned —a tint

Wynyard Square were two sisters in satins—one in a
sort of redaish brown, the other a kind of brownish
rod, but both stylish and handsome. Several cream
nun’s veiling and broehe toilets were rich, especially
soma with fruit and flower hats over Eastern faces.
One sateen was all sunflowers, with a draping of lace
on the skirt for them to peep through. No one mate-
rial, colour, or style was particularly prominent. The
gold oup given by Mr. E. E, Jones was exhibited, and a
good deal coveted. Of course, the trams were crowded,
bat not uab'srablv so, for the useful Peeler stalked on
the platform iu a body of six, and some of tho’e very
hasty people who walked into the oars on top of other
people were made to walk out again.

—a black satin trimmed with laoe was muoh admired
on a married lady ; and several cream and cardinal
drasse* were noticed. A dark-eyed damsel (we believe
from Tasmania) was voted belle. Dancing was spun out

The breaking-up fete at Charlton House, Wool-

First cams a mixed musical entertainment, of which
“ Flear-do-Lys” was vary attractive; then a humorous
musical acrostic in ten aoenas. Father Christmas
appeared with snowy beard, crown and sceptre, accom-
panied by the twelve months of the old year represented
by tw dve elder pupils revolving round him to an appro-
priate chant. Then tho New Year came in glittering
white, encircled by hey twelve months, portrayed by
twelve juniors chanting a welcome. Father Christmas

the latter in a suit of clarat velvet. A lady from Hay,
in pearl satin, richly trimmed with pearl and gold

from Glebe Point mad, in cream satin. Very beauti
fully dressed were five little damsels, the Misses Baps-
ford, Slattery, Cary, Horn and Anderson. Tho graceful

known eoutloiuen also showed they could du-et well.
From Marlborough-street came a brilliant brunette in

There was great rejoicing in Sydney on Friday
afternoon, when the news arrived that Binaer-mau
had, with “flying colours,” carried out his bat for
102, and that our boys had won the Intercolonial - iatch
with seven wickets to spare However, the match
fades into significance beside the International contest
decided on Tuesday afternoon, and will ie ob efiy
memorable for the de ormintd stand made by the Vic-
torians (especially Horan) in the sec nd innings. In
an account of the match in Thursdi,' 4.M. Herald,
their own reporter ” says: -‘TbeN .-V. team fielded
grandly, with the exception of Murdoon, whose wicket-
keeping would < isgrace a third-rate eleven playing in
Moore Park.” There is no doubt Murdoch was not up
to his usual form —every man and beast has off-days,
and Wednesday week was evidently one of Murdoch's
—but under the circumstances the abovc.quoted rr-

Bulletin, Sydney, — Sir, You published in last issue
a par. to the f fleet that I (if elected in the recent con-
test for Gundagsi) intended to resign in favour of Mr.
John Davies, C M.G. This report was raised hero by
the Opposition local paper on the morning of the poll-

beg to assure you—if you really do believe the report to
which you gave circulation—that there was no founda-
tion whatever for it. You may have seen a correction
of the report published in my own paper last weak. In
fairness to a brother journalist, who does not want his
name and character damned tor ever, yon should die*

resigned mv seat for another person, and especially for

the meanwhile, believe from me that he is not a Spiritual-
ist. (I hope tdat. yon-most of you growing up with him

shew or express indifference to you, or your good-will,

needles ” as Josh Billings would say. Ladies are indeed
oomi g to the front n N S W. politics. Bat at election
time 3 ladies shouldn't write. They should simply loiter
round the hustings, and wear election card.*-, and look
pretty—just as a lady who espoused the cause of a certain

Old men of the sea are not extinct evon in this
year of erace. South Australia is sorely bestridden by
»no. When the colony started, the South Australian
Company came into existence and invented money in
what then seemed a possibly dubious undertaking.
The representatives of that Company were instructed to
choose land along the water-courses, and picked out
the eyes of the country. Time went on ; roads were
made, bridges built, railways introduced, District
Councils and Corporations formed, and in every possible
manner the colony progressed from sickly infancy to
promising youth. The South Australian Company
retain their grip on the land, and now, in many places,
are seriously retarding anything which approaches r
beneficially advancing policy. The shareholders are
absentees. They toil not neither do they spin, jet
Solomon in all his glory did not draw a bigger income
than do these They pay no rates or
taxes; their tenants are saddled with all charges ; they
are arbitrary and inconsiderate landlords; in some dig.
tricts they will only grant a year’s lease; out of the
millions of acres held they will only give raining rights
over one thousand ; and they wring out the fat of the
land for the benefit of people who are not colonists If
the colony is tooonfiana to progress suoh a monopoly
cannot much longer be Buffered The South Australian
Company may have been useful in the old times;
now the Company are simply an incubus. They are a
deadly parasite delays settlement, civilization,
and enterprise. Measures are sought whereby the
hold this Company have attained may bo utterly
abolished, for no land tax can be passed sufficient to
make their grip unclasp. Good colonists are getting
impatient of the baleful influence of the South Aus-
tralian Company, and begin to see that the welfare of
the many must not be sacrificed for the benefit of the
few. It ia proposed that the country shall buy the
estate of the South Australian Company, endeavouring
to obtain what Parliamentary sanction and authority
may bo necessary. It the price be fixed at a fair current
valuation no loss will be occasioned the Company, while
the purchasing colony need not even be one penny out
of picket. Thou rands of private purchasers would
con e fo ward anxious and prepared to buy at such a
price. The proposed proceeding, though entirely uncon-
ventional, would only amount to forcing the South
Australian Company to sell for value. At present they
refuse to do so. Vested interests are strong; but the
people are stronger, and their will cannot go contemp-
tuously unheeded for any length of time. Unless the
manager and shareholders suddenly become entirely
amenable to public opinion, the South Australian Com-
pany is doomed.

Said that Henry Harry Cooke’s party intend dis-
puting the Forbes election on the ground that non-

A certain Orange Lodge out West has tried a member,

A correspondent of the Bourke Watchman objected to
Mr. T. A. Mathews as a candidate on the ground that
— from a schoolmaster’s point of view—he was totally
unfit to represent that great electoiate.” Mr. J. G.

Queensland gives away ten million acres At the
Bogan nomination, an aboriginal asked Mr. Cass if it

that they voted the usual ticket R. Murray Smith,

Over 800 births were registered in this city alone

The Northern Miner “ hopes that the

quarrel was begotten of bear, and in beer it should be
buried.”
A nice-looking woman carrying a “ property ”
infant is making a tour of the Queensland towns just
n«w. on the cli eruelly-deoeived-and-deserted-clergy,
rwan’s-daughter basis, an'? is said to be making a com-
fortable thing out of it. Sho tells the same old yarn we
have heard so often, witn hardly the variation of a
word. She is +he daughter of a well-known Anglican
clergyman in Brisbane—has incurred her father’s dis-
pleasure by marrying beneath her station—has been
deserted by her husband—a little assistance to get to
Brisbane would be, &o. Her address is said to b« cap-
tivating, and they say she tells her story “ with remark-
able cleverness and circumstantiality. ’’ We have seen
ladies of this kind before. They usually dress in black,
are mostly tall, and have pale faces, with shifty eyes
that seem, while the owner is talking to you, to be
rolling round in search of the spoon-basket. * Their
manner is pseudo lady-like, but they are, as a rale, the
daughters of midwives or wet-nurses. And they always
carry a reticule This contains a smelling-bottle and a
handkerchief—the latter they cry in when necessary,
the former you hold to their, noses when they begin to
faint. Your wife comes in just then, and there is a
tableau Being a man of tho world, of course yo -i don’t
do anything so foolish as to attempt to explain away
your embarrassment by saying that you never saw the
woman in your life before. You simply give her what
she asks, let her go, and thank your stars that she did
not leave her baby with you. This is a nice way of
settinir a living. But politics is better—-n this country.
